Preface
The purpose of ESSENTIALS OF STATISTICS FOR BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS is
to give students, primarily those in the fields of business administration and economics,
a conceptual introduction to the field of statistics and its many applications. The text is
applications oriented and written with the needs of the nonmathematician in mind; the math-
ematical prerequisite is knowledge of algebra.
Applications of data analysis and statistical methodology are an integral part of the or-
ganization and presentation of the text material. The discussion and development of each
technique is presented in an application setting, with the statistical results providing insights
to decisions and solutions to problems. 
Although the book is applications oriented, we have taken care to provide sound
methodological development and to use notation that is generally accepted for the topic be-
ing covered. Hence, students will find that this text provides good preparation for the study
of more advanced statistical material. A bibliography to guide further study is included as
an appendix.
The text introduces the student to the software packages of Minitab 15 and Microsoft®
Office Excel® 2007 and emphasizes the role of computer software in the application of
statistical analysis. Minitab is illustrated as it is one of the leading statistical software
packages for both education and statistical practice. Excel is not a statistical software pack-
age, but the wide availability and use of Excel make it important for students to understand
the statistical capabilities of this package. With this edition, we are making available a
commercial Excel add-in, StatTools, that extends the range of statistical options for Excel
users. Minitab, Excel, and StatTools procedures are provided in chapter appendixes so that
instructors have the flexibility of using as much computer emphasis as desired for the
course.
It is likely there will be users of both Excel 2007 and Excel 2010 using this text. To
accommodate both groups of users, the step-by-step procedures and the worksheets pre-
sented in our Excel appendixes were developed and tested using both Excel 2007 and the
public beta versions of Excel 2010. For Excel 2007 users we have included on the website
that accompanies the text a primer entitled Microsoft Excel 2007 and Tools for Statistical
Analysis. A similar primer entitled Microsoft Excel 2010 and Tools for Statistical Analy-
sis is provided on the website for Excel 2010 users.

Preface
Changes in the Sixth Edition
We appreciate the acceptance and positive response to the previous editions of
ESSENTIALS OF STATISTICS FOR BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS. Accordingly, in mak-
ing modifications for this new edition, we have maintained the presentation style and read-
ability of those editions. The significant changes in the new edition are summarized here.
Content Revisions
•
StatTools Add-In for Excel. Excel 2007 does not contain statistical functions or
data analysis tools to perform all the statistical procedures discussed in the text.
StatTools is a commercial Excel 2007 add-in, developed by Palisade Corporation,
that provides additional statistical options for Excel users. In an appendix to 
Chapter 1 we show how to download and install StatTools, and most chapters 
include a chapter appendix that shows the steps required to implement a statistical
procedure using StatTools.
We have been very careful to make the use of StatTools completely optional so
that instructors who want to teach using the standard tools available in Excel 2007
can continue to do so. But users who want additional statistical capabilities not
available in standard Excel 2007 now have access to an industry standard statistics
add-in that students will be able to continue to use in the workplace.
•
Change in Terminology for Data. In the previous edition, nominal and ordinal data
were classified as qualitative; interval and ratio data were classified as quantitative.
In this edition, nominal and ordinal data are referred to as categorical data. Nomi-
nal and ordinal data use labels or names to identify categories of like items. Thus,
we believe that the term categorical is more descriptive of this type of data.
•
Introducing Data Mining. A new section in Chapter 1 introduces the relatively new
field of data mining. We provide a brief overview of data mining and the concept of
a data warehouse. We also describe how the fields of statistics and computer science
join to make data mining operational and valuable. 
•
Ethical Issues in Statistics. Another new section in Chapter 1 provides a discus-
sion of ethical issues when presenting and interpreting statistical information. 
•
Updated Excel Appendix for Tabular and Graphical Descriptive Statistics. The
chapter-ending Excel appendix for Chapter 2 shows how the Chart Tools, PivotTable
Report, and PivotChart Report can be used to enhance the capabilities for displaying
tabular and graphical descriptive statistics. 
•
Comparative Analysis with Box Plots. The treatment of box plots in Chapter 2 has
been expanded to include relatively quick and easy comparisons of two or more data
sets. Typical starting salary data for accounting, finance, management, and market-
ing majors are used to illustrate box plot multigroup comparisons.
•
Revised Sampling Material. The introduction of Chapter 7 has been revised and now
includes the concepts of a sampled population and a frame. The distinction between
sampling from a finite population and an infinite population has been clarified, with
sampling from a process used to illustrate the selection of a random sample from an
infinite population. A practical advice section stresses the importance of obtaining
close correspondence between the sampled population and the target population.

•
Revised Introduction to Hypothesis Testing. Section 9.1, Developing Null and 
Alternative Hypotheses, has been revised. A better set of guidelines has been de-
veloped for identifying the null and alternative hypotheses. The context of the sit-
uation and the purpose for taking the sample are key. In situations in which the
focus is on finding evidence to support a research finding, the research hypothesis
is the alternative hypothesis. In situations where the focus is on challenging an as-
sumption, the assumption is the null hypothesis.
•
New Case Problems. We have added 5 new case problems to this edition, bringing
the total number of case problems to 31. A new case problem on descriptive statis-
tics appears in Chapter 3 and a new case problem on hypothesis testing appears in
Chapter 9. Two new case problems have been added to regression in Chapters 12
and 13. These case problems provide students with the opportunity to analyze larger
data sets and prepare managerial reports based on the results of the analysis.
•
New Statistics in Practice Application. Each chapter begins with a Statistics in
Practice vignette that describes an application of the statistical methodology to be
covered in the chapter. New to this edition is the Statistics in Practice article for
Oceanwide Seafood in Chapter 4.
•
New Examples and Exercises Based on Real Data. We continue to make a
significant effort to update our text examples and exercises with the most current
real data and referenced sources of statistical information. In this edition, we have
added approximately 140 new examples and exercises based on real data and refer-
enced sources. Using data from sources also used by The Wall Street Journal, USA
Today, Barron’s, and others, we have drawn from actual studies to develop expla-
nations and to create exercises that demonstrate the many uses of statistics in busi-
ness and economics. We believe that the use of real data helps generate more student
interest in the material and enables the student to learn about both the statistical
methodology and its application. The sixth edition of the text contains over 300 ex-
amples and exercises based on real data.

Preface
Features and Pedagogy
Authors Anderson, Sweeney, and Williams have continued many of the features that
appeared in previous editions. Important ones for students are noted here.
Methods Exercises and Applications Exercises
The end-of-section exercises are split into two parts, Methods and Applications. The Meth-
ods exercises require students to use the formulas and make the necessary computations.
The Applications exercises require students to use the chapter material in real-world situa-
tions. Thus, students first focus on the computational “nuts and bolts” and then move on to
the subtleties of statistical application and interpretation.
Self-Test Exercises
Certain exercises are identified as “Self-Test Exercises.” Completely worked-out solutions
for these exercises are provided in Appendix D at the back of the book. Students can at-
tempt the Self-Test Exercises and immediately check the solution to evaluate their under-
standing of the concepts presented in the chapter.
Margin Annotations and Notes and Comments
Margin annotations that highlight key points and provide additional insights for the student
are a key feature of this text. These annotations are designed to emphasize and enhance
understanding of the terms and concepts being presented in the text. 
At the end of many sections, we provide Notes and Comments designed to give the stu-
dent additional insights about the statistical methodology and its application. Notes and
Comments include warnings about or limitations of the methodology, recommendations for
application, brief descriptions of additional technical considerations, and other matters.
Data Files Accompany the Text
Approximately 250 data files are available on the website that accompanies the text. The
data sets are available in both Minitab and Excel formats. File logos are used in the text to
identify the data sets that are available on the website. Data sets for all case problems as
well as data sets for larger exercises are included.

Chapter 1
Data and Statistics
With a global circulation of more than 1 million, Busi-
nessWeek is the most widely read business magazine in
the world. More than 200 dedicated reporters and editors
in 26 bureaus worldwide deliver a variety of articles of 
interest to the business and economic community. Along
with feature articles on current topics, the magazine
contains regular sections on International Business, Eco-
nomic Analysis, Information Processing, and Science &
Technology. Information in the feature articles and the
regular sections helps readers stay abreast of current de-
velopments and assess the impact of those developments
on business and economic conditions.
Most issues of BusinessWeek provide an in-depth
report on a topic of current interest. Often, the in-depth re-
ports contain statistical facts and summaries that help the
reader understand the business and economic information.
For example, the March 17, 2009 issue included a discus-
sion of when the stock market would begin to recover, the
May 4, 2009 issue had a special report on how to make pay
cuts less painful, and the January 18, 2010 issue contained
an article on the permanent temporary workforce. In
addition, the weekly BusinessWeek Investor provides sta-
tisticsaboutthestateoftheeconomy,includingproduction
indexes, stock prices, mutual funds, and interest rates.
BusinessWeek also uses statistics and statistical in-
formation in managing its own business. For example, an
annual survey of subscribers helps the company learn
about subscriber demographics, reading habits, likely
purchases, lifestyles, and so on. BusinessWeek managers
usestatisticalsummariesfromthesurveytoprovidebetter
services to subscribers and advertisers. One recent North
American subscriber survey indicated that 90% of
BusinessWeek subscribers use a personal computer at
home and that 64% of BusinessWeek subscribers are
involvedwithcomputerpurchasesatwork.Suchstatistics
alert BusinessWeek managers to subscriber interest in
articles about new developments in computers. The
results of the survey are also made available to potential
advertisers.Thehighpercentageofsubscribersusingper-
sonal computers at home and the high percentage of sub-
scribersinvolvedwithcomputerpurchasesatworkwould
be an incentive for a computer manufacturer to consider
advertising in BusinessWeek.
In this chapter, we discuss the types of data available
for statistical analysis and describe how the data are ob-
tained. We introduce descriptive statistics and statistical
inference as ways of converting data into meaningful and
easily interpreted statistical information.
BusinessWeek uses statistical facts and summaries 
in many of its articles.

STATISTICS in PRACTICE
*The authors are indebted to Charlene Trentham, Research Manager at
BusinessWeek, for providing this Statistics in Practice.
Frequently, we see the following types of statements in newspapers and magazines: 
•
The National Association of Realtors reported that the median price paid by first-
time home buyers is $165,000 (The Wall Street Journal, February 11, 2009).
•
The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) reported that college athletes are
earning degrees at record rates. Latest figures show that 79% of all men and women
student-athletes graduate (Associated Press, October 15, 2008).
•
The average one-way travel time to work is 25.3 minutes (U.S. Census Bureau,
March 2009).

•
A poll showed that 73% of the individuals surveyed expected the Dow Jones
Industrial Average to gain 10% or more during the coming year (Money Investor’s
Guide, February 2010).
•
The national average price for regular gasoline reached $4.00 per gallon for the first
time in history (Cable News Network website, June 8, 2008).
•
The New York Yankees have the highest salaries in major league baseball. The total
payroll is $201,449,289 with a median salary of $5,000,000 (USA Today Salary
Data Base, September 2009).
•
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 10,664 (The Wall Street Journal,
January 12, 2010).
The numerical facts in the preceding statements ($165,000, 79%, 25.3, 73%, $4.00,
$201,449,289, $5,000,000, and 10,664) are called statistics. In this usage, the term statistics
refers to numerical facts such as averages, medians, percents, and index numbers that help
us understand a variety of business and economic situations. However, as you will see, the
field, or subject, of statistics involves much more than numerical facts. In a broader sense,
statistics is defined as the art and science of collecting, analyzing, presenting, and inter-
preting data. Particularly in business and economics, the information provided by collect-
ing, analyzing, presenting, and interpreting data gives managers and decision makers a
better understanding of the business and economic environment and thus enables them to
make more informed and better decisions. In this text, we emphasize the use of statistics 
for business and economic decision making.
Chapter 1 begins with some illustrations of the applications of statistics in business and
economics. In Section 1.2 we define the term data and introduce the concept of a data set.
This section also introduces key terms such as variables and observations, discusses the dif-
ference between quantitative and categorical data, and illustrates the uses of cross-sectional
and time series data. Section 1.3 discusses how data can be obtained from existing sources or
through survey and experimental studies designed to obtain new data. The important role that
the Internet now plays in obtaining data is also highlighted. The uses of data in developing
descriptive statistics and in making statistical inferences are described in Sections 1.4 and 1.5.
The last three sections of Chapter 1 provide the role of the computer in statistical analysis, an
introduction to the relative new field of data mining, and a discussion of ethical guidelines for
statistical practice. Achapter-ending appendix includes an introduction to the add-in StatTools
which can be used to extend the statistical options for users of Microsoft Excel.
1.1
Applications in Business and Economics
In today’s global business and economic environment, anyone can access vast amounts of
statistical information. The most successful managers and decision makers understand the
information and know how to use it effectively. In this section, we provide examples that 
illustrate some of the uses of statistics in business and economics.
Accounting
Public accounting firms use statistical sampling procedures when conducting audits for their
clients. For instance, suppose an accounting firm wants to determine whether the amount of
accounts receivable shown on a client’s balance sheet fairly represents the actual amount
of accounts receivable. Usually the large number of individual accounts receivable makes
reviewing and validating every account too time-consuming and expensive. As common
practice in such situations, the audit staff selects a subset of the accounts called a sample.
After reviewing the accuracy of the sampled accounts, the auditors draw a conclusion as to
whether the accounts receivable amount shown on the client’s balance sheet is acceptable.

Finance
Financial analysts use a variety of statistical information to guide their investment recom-
mendations. In the case of stocks, the analysts review a variety of financial data including
price/earnings ratios and dividend yields. By comparing the information for an individual
stock with information about the stock market averages, a financial analyst can begin to
draw a conclusion as to whether an individual stock is over- or underpriced. For example,
Barron’s (February 18, 2008) reported that the average dividend yield for the 30 stocks in
the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 2.45%. Altria Group showed a dividend yield of
3.05%. In this case, the statistical information on dividend yield indicates a higher dividend
yield for Altria Group than the average for the Dow Jones stocks. Therefore, a financial an-
alyst might conclude that Altria Group was underpriced. This and other information about
Altria Group would help the analyst make a buy, sell, or hold recommendation for the stock.
Marketing
Electronic scanners at retail checkout counters collect data for a variety of marketing re-
search applications. For example, data suppliers such as ACNielsen and Information Re-
sources, Inc., purchase point-of-sale scanner data from grocery stores, process the data, and
then sell statistical summaries of the data to manufacturers. Manufacturers spend hundreds
of thousands of dollars per product category to obtain this type of scanner data. Manufac-
turers also purchase data and statistical summaries on promotional activities such as spe-
cial pricing and the use of in-store displays. Brand managers can review the scanner
statistics and the promotional activity statistics to gain a better understanding of the rela-
tionship between promotional activities and sales. Such analyses often prove helpful in
establishing future marketing strategies for the various products.
Production
Today’s emphasis on quality makes quality control an important application of statistics 
in production. A variety of statistical quality control charts are used to monitor the out-
put of a production process. In particular, an x-bar chart can be used to monitor the average
output. Suppose, for example, that a machine fills containers with 12 ounces of a soft drink.
Periodically, a production worker selects a sample of containers and computes the average
number of ounces in the sample. This average, or x-bar value, is plotted on an x-bar chart. A
plotted value above the chart’s upper control limit indicates overfilling, and a plotted value
below the chart’s lower control limit indicates underfilling. The process is termed “in con-
trol” and allowed to continue as long as the plotted x-bar values fall between the chart’s upper
and lower control limits. Properly interpreted, an x-bar chart can help determine when
adjustments are necessary to correct a production process.
Economics
Economists frequently provide forecasts about the future of the economy or some aspect of it.
They use a variety of statistical information in making such forecasts. For instance, in fore-
casting inflation rates, economists use statistical information on such indicators as the Producer
Price Index, the unemployment rate, and manufacturing capacity utilization. Often these sta-
tistical indicators are entered into computerized forecasting models that predict inflation rates.
Applications of statistics such as those described in this section are an integral part of
this text. Such examples provide an overview of the breadth of statistical applications. To
supplement these examples, practitioners in the fields of business and economics provided
chapter-opening Statistics in Practice articles that introduce the material covered in each
chapter. The Statistics in Practice applications show the importance of statistics in a wide
variety of business and economic situations.

Data
Data are the facts and figures collected, analyzed, and summarized for presentation and in-
terpretation. All the data collected in a particular study are referred to as the data set for the
study. Table 1.1 shows a data set containing information for 25 mutual funds that are part
of the Morningstar Funds 500 for 2008. Morningstar is a company that tracks over 7000
mutual funds and prepares in-depth analyses of 2000 of these. Its recommendations are fol-
lowed closely by financial analysts and individual investors.
Elements, Variables, and Observations
Elements are the entities on which data are collected. For the data set in Table 1.1, each in-
dividual mutual fund is an element: The element names appear in the first column. With 25
mutual funds, the data set contains 25 elements.
A variable is a characteristic of interest for the elements. The data set in Table 1.1 in-
cludes the following five variables:
•
Fund Type: The type of mutual fund, labeled DE (Domestic Equity), IE (Interna-
tional Equity), and FI (Fixed Income)
•
Net Asset Value ($): The closing price per share on December 31, 2007

•
5-Year Average Return (%): The average annual return for the fund over the past
5 years
•
Expense Ratio: The percentage of assets deducted each fiscal year for fund expenses
•
Morningstar Rank: The overall risk-adjusted star rating for each fund; Morningstar
ranks go from a low of 1-Star to a high of 5-Stars
Measurements collected on each variable for every element in a study provide the data. The
set of measurements obtained for a particular element is called an observation. Referring
to Table 1.1, we see that the set of measurements for the first observation (American Cen-
tury Intl. Disc) is IE, 14.37, 30.53, 1.41, and 3-Star. The set of measurements for the sec-
ond observation (American Century Tax-Free Bond) is FI, 10.73, 3.34, 0.49, and 4-Star, and
so on. A data set with 25 elements contains 25 observations.
Scales of Measurement
Data collection requires one of the following scales of measurement: nominal, ordinal,
interval, or ratio. The scale of measurement determines the amount of information con-
tained in the data and indicates the most appropriate data summarization and statistical
analyses.
When the data for a variable consist of labels or names used to identify an attribute of
the element, the scale of measurement is considered a nominal scale. For example, refer-
ring to the data in Table 1.1, we see that the scale of measurement for the Fund Type vari-
able is nominal because DE, IE, and FI are labels used to identify the category or type of
fund. In cases where the scale of measurement is nominal, a numerical code as well as non-
numerical labels may be used. For example, to facilitate data collection and to prepare the
data for entry into a computer database, we might use a numerical code by letting 1 denote
Domestic Equity, 2 denote International Equity, and 3 denote Fixed Income. In this case the
numerical values 1, 2, and 3 identify the category of fund. The scale of measurement is nomi-
nal even though the data appear as numerical values.
The scale of measurement for a variable is called an ordinal scale if the data ex-
hibit the properties of nominal data and the order or rank of the data is meaningful. For
example, Eastside Automotive sends customers a questionnaire designed to obtain data 
on the quality of its automotive repair service. Each customer provides a repair service
rating of excellent, good, or poor. Because the data obtained are the labels—excellent,
good, or poor—the data have the properties of nominal data. In addition, the data can be
ranked, or ordered, with respect to the service quality. Data recorded as excellent indi-
cate the best service, followed by good and then poor. Thus, the scale of measurement 
is ordinal. As another example, note that the Morningstar Rank for the data in Table 1.1 is
ordinal data. It provides a rank from 1 to 5-Stars based on Morningstar’s assessment of the
fund’s risk-adjusted return. Ordinal data can also be provided using a numerical code, for
example, your class rank in school.
The scale of measurement for a variable is an interval scale if the data have all the
properties of ordinal data and the interval between values is expressed in terms of a fixed
unit of measure. Interval data are always numerical. College admission SAT scores are an ex-
ample of interval-scaled data. For example, three students with SAT math scores of 620, 550,
and 470 can be ranked or ordered in terms of best performance to poorest performance in
math. In addition, the differences between the scores are meaningful. For instance, student 1
scored 620  550  70 points more than student 2, while student 2 scored 550  470  80
points more than student 3.
The scale of measurement for a variable is a ratio scale if the data have all the prop-
erties of interval data and the ratio of two values is meaningful. Variables such as dis-
tance, height, weight, and time use the ratio scale of measurement. This scale requires that
a zero value be included to indicate that nothing exists for the variable at the zero point.

For example, consider the cost of an automobile. A zero value for the cost would indicate
that the automobile has no cost and is free. In addition, if we compare the cost of $30,000
for one automobile to the cost of $15,000 for a second automobile, the ratio property
shows that the first automobile is $30,000/$15,000  2 times, or twice, the cost of the
second automobile.
Categorical and Quantitative Data
Data can be classified as either categorical or quantitative. Data that can be grouped by
specific categories are referred to as categorical data. Categorical data use either the nom-
inal or ordinal scale of measurement. Data that use numerical values to indicate how much 
or how many are referred to as quantitative data. Quantitative data are obtained using
either the interval or ratio scale of measurement.
A categorical variable is a variable with categorical data, and a quantitative variable
is a variable with quantitative data. The statistical analysis appropriate for a particular vari-
able depends upon whether the variable is categorical or quantitative. If the variable is
categorical, the statistical analysis is limited. We can summarize categorical data by count-
ing the number of observations in each category or by computing the proportion of the
observations in each category. However, even when the categorical data are identified by a
numerical code, arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
division do not provide meaningful results. Section 2.1 discusses ways for summarizing
categorical data.
Arithmetic operations provide meaningful results for quantitative variables. For exam-
ple, quantitative data may be added and then divided by the number of observations to
compute the average value. This average is usually meaningful and easily interpreted. In
general, more alternatives for statistical analysis are possible when data are quantitative.
Section 2.2 and Chapter 3 provide ways of summarizing quantitative data.
Cross-Sectional and Time Series Data
For purposes of statistical analysis, distinguishing between cross-sectional data and time
series data is important. Cross-sectional data are data collected at the same or approxi-
mately the same point in time. The data in Table 1.1 are cross-sectional because they de-
scribe the five variables for the 25 mutual funds at the same point in time. Time series
data are data collected over several time periods. For example, the time series in 
Figure 1.1 shows the U.S. average price per gallon of conventional regular gasoline be-
tween 2006 and 2009. Note that higher gasoline prices have tended to occur in the sum-
mer months, with the all-time-high average of $4.05 per gallon occurring in July 2008. 
By January 2009, gasoline prices had taken a steep decline to a three-year low of $1.65 
per gallon.
Graphs of time series data are frequently found in business and economic publications.
Such graphs help analysts understand what happened in the past, identify any trends over
time, and project future levels for the time series. The graphs of time series data can take
on a variety of forms, as shown in Figure 1.2. With a little study, these graphs are usually
easy to understand and interpret.
For example, Panel (A) in Figure 1.2 is a graph that shows the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average Index from 1997 to 2010. In April 1997, the popular stock market index was near
7000. Over the next 10 years the index rose to over 14,000 in July 2007. However, notice
the sharp decline in the time series after the all-time high in 2007. By March 2009, poor
economic conditions had caused the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index to return to the
7000 level of 1997. This was a scary and discouraging period for investors. By January
2010, the index was showing a recovery by reaching 10,600.

The graph in Panel (B) shows the net income of McDonald’s Inc. from 2003 to 2009. The
declining economic conditions in 2008 and 2009 were actually beneficial to McDonald’s as
the company’s net income rose to an all-time high. The growth in McDonald’s net income
showed that the company was thriving during the economic downturn as people were cutting
back on the more expensive sit-down restaurants and seeking less-expensive alternatives
offered by McDonald’s.
Panel (C) shows the time series for the occupancy rate of hotels in South Florida over
a one-year period. The highest occupancy rates, 95% and 98%, occur during the months
of February and March when the climate of South Florida is attractive to tourists. In fact,
January to April of each year is typically the high-occupancy season for South Florida
hotels. On the other hand, note the low occupancy rates during the months of August to
October, with the lowest occupancy rate of 50% occurring in September. High tempera-
tures and the hurricane season are the primary reasons for the drop in hotel occupancy
during this period.

NOTES AND COMMENTS
1. An observation is the set of measurements ob-
tained for each element in a data set. Hence, the
number of observations is always the same as the
number of elements. The number of measure-
ments obtained for each element equals the num-
ber of variables. Hence, the total number of data
items can be determined by multiplying the num-
ber of observations by the number of variables.
2. Quantitative data may be discrete or continuous.
Quantitative data that measure how many (e.g.,
number of telephone calls received in 15 min-
utes) are discrete. Quantitative data that measure
how much (e.g., weight or time) are continuous
because no separation occurs between the possi-
ble data values.

Data Sources
Data can be obtained from existing sources or from surveys and experimental studies
designed to collect new data.
Existing Sources
In some cases, data needed for a particular application already exist. Companies maintain a
variety of databases about their employees, customers, and business operations. Data on
employee salaries, ages, and years of experience can usually be obtained from internal per-
sonnel records. Other internal records contain data on sales, advertising expenditures, distri-
bution costs, inventory levels, and production quantities. Most companies also maintain
detailed data about their customers. Table 1.2 shows some of the data commonly available
from internal company records.
Organizations that specialize in collecting and maintaining data make available sub-
stantial amounts of business and economic data. Companies access these external data
sources through leasing arrangements or by purchase. Dun & Bradstreet, Bloomberg, and
Dow Jones & Company are three firms that provide extensive business database services
to clients. ACNielsen and Information Resources, Inc., built successful businesses collecting
and processing data that it sells to advertisers and product manufacturers.
Data are also available from a variety of industry associations and special interest or-
ganizations. The Travel Industry Association of America maintains travel-related informa-
tion such as the number of tourists and travel expenditures by states. Such data would be of
interest to firms and individuals in the travel industry. The Graduate Management
Admission Council maintains data on test scores, student characteristics, and graduate man-
agement education programs. Most of the data from these types of sources are available to
qualified users at a modest cost.
The Internet continues to grow as an important source of data and statistical informa-
tion. Almost all companies maintain websites that provide general information about the
company as well as data on sales, number of employees, number of products, product prices,
and product specifications. In addition, a number of companies now specialize in making
information available over the Internet. As a result, one can obtain access to stock quotes,
meal prices at restaurants, salary data, and an almost infinite variety of information.
Government agencies are another important source of existing data. For instance, the
U.S. Department of Labor maintains considerable data on employment rates, wage rates,
size of the labor force, and union membership. Table 1.3 lists selected governmental agencies

and some of the data they provide. Most government agencies that collect and process data
also make the results available through a website. Figure 1.3 shows the homepage for the
U.S. Census Bureau website.
Statistical Studies
Sometimes the data needed for a particular application are not available through existing
sources. In such cases, the data can often be obtained by conducting a statistical study. Sta-
tistical studies can be classified as either experimental or observational.
In an experimental study, a variable of interest is first identified. Then one or more other
variables are identified and controlled so that data can be obtained about how they influence
the variable of interest. For example, a pharmaceutical firm might be interested in conducting
an experiment to learn about how a new drug affects blood pressure. Blood pressure is the
variable of interest in the study. The dosage level of the new drug is another variable that
is hoped to have a causal effect on blood pressure. To obtain data about the effect of the

new drug, researchers select a sample of individuals. The dosage level of the new drug is
controlled, as different groups of individuals are given different dosage levels. Before and
after data on blood pressure are collected for each group. Statistical analysis of the experi-
mental data can help determine how the new drug affects blood pressure.
Nonexperimental, or observational, statistical studies make no attempt to control the
variables of interest. A survey is perhaps the most common type of observational study. For
instance, in a personal interview survey, research questions are first identified. Then a ques-
tionnaire is designed and administered to a sample of individuals. Some restaurants use ob-
servational studies to obtain data about customer opinions on the quality of food, quality of
service, atmosphere, and so on. A customer opinion questionnaire used by Chops City Grill
in Naples, Florida, is shown in Figure 1.4. Note that the customers who fill out the ques-
tionnaire are asked to provide ratings for 12 variables, including overall experience, greet-
ing by hostess, manager (table visit), overall service, and so on. The response categories of
excellent, good, average, fair, and poor provide categorical data that enable Chops City Grill
management to maintain high standards for the restaurant’s food and service.
Anyone wanting to use data and statistical analysis as aids to decision making must be
aware of the time and cost required to obtain the data. The use of existing data sources is
desirable when data must be obtained in a relatively short period of time. If important data
are not readily available from an existing source, the additional time and cost involved in
obtaining the data must be taken into account. In all cases, the decision maker should

consider the contribution of the statistical analysis to the decision-making process. The cost
of data acquisition and the subsequent statistical analysis should not exceed the savings
generated by using the information to make a better decision.
Data Acquisition Errors
Managers should always be aware of the possibility of data errors in statistical studies. Using
erroneous data can be worse than not using any data at all. An error in data acquisition occurs
whenever the data value obtained is not equal to the true or actual value that would be ob-
tained with a correct procedure. Such errors can occur in a number of ways. For example, an
interviewer might make a recording error, such as a transposition in writing the age of a 
24-year-old person as 42, or the person answering an interview question might misinterpret
the question and provide an incorrect response.
Experienced data analysts take great care in collecting and recording data to ensure that
errors are not made. Special procedures can be used to check for internal consistency of the
data. For instance, such procedures would indicate that the analyst should review the accu-
racy of data for a respondent shown to be 22 years of age but reporting 20 years of work
experience. Data analysts also review data with unusually large and small values, called
outliers, which are candidates for possible data errors. In Chapter 3 we present some of the
methods statisticians use to identify outliers.
Errors often occur during data acquisition. Blindly using any data that happen to be
available or using data that were acquired with little care can result in misleading informa-
tion and bad decisions. Thus, taking steps to acquire accurate data can help ensure reliable
and valuable decision-making information.
1.4
Descriptive Statistics
Most of the statistical information in newspapers, magazines, company reports, and other
publications consists of data that are summarized and presented in a form that is easy for
the reader to understand. Such summaries of data, which may be tabular, graphical, or
numerical, are referred to as descriptive statistics.
Refer again to the data set in Table 1.1 showing data on 25 mutual funds. Methods of
descriptive statistics can be used to provide summaries of the information in this data set.
For example, a tabular summary of the data for the categorical variable Fund Type is
shown in Table 1.4. A graphical summary of the same data, called a bar chart, is shown
in Figure 1.5. These types of tabular and graphical summaries generally make the data eas-
ier to interpret. Referring to Table 1.4 and Figure 1.5, we can see easily that the majority
of the mutual funds are of the Domestic Equity type. On a percentage basis, 64% are of
the Domestic Equity type, 16% are of the International Equity type, and 20% are of the
Fixed Income type.

A graphical summary of the data for the quantitative variable Net Asset Value, called

set values range from $0 to $75, with the highest concentration between $15 and $30. Only
one of the net asset values is greater than $60.
In addition to tabular and graphical displays, numerical descriptive statistics are used
to summarize data. The most common numerical descriptive statistic is the average, or

mean. Using the data on 5-Year Average Return for the mutual funds in Table 1.1, we can
compute the average by adding the returns for all 25 mutual funds and dividing the sum
by 25. Doing so provides a 5-year average return of 16.50%. This average demonstrates a
measure of the central tendency, or central location, of the data for that variable.
There is a great deal of interest in effective methods for developing and presenting de-
scriptive statistics. Chapters 2 and 3 devote attention to the tabular, graphical, and numerical
methods of descriptive statistics.
1.5
Statistical Inference
Many situations require information about a large group of elements (individuals, compa-
nies, voters, households, products, customers, and so on). But, because of time, cost, and
other considerations, data can be collected from only a small portion of the group. The larger
group of elements in a particular study is called the population, and the smaller group is
called the sample. Formally, we use the following definitions.
1.5
Statistical Inference
15
POPULATION
A population is the set of all elements of interest in a particular study.
SAMPLE
A sample is a subset of the population.
The process of conducting a survey to collect data for the entire population is called a
census. The process of conducting a survey to collect data for a sample is called a sample
survey. As one of its major contributions, statistics uses data from a sample to make esti-
mates and test hypotheses about the characteristics of a population through a process
referred to as statistical inference.
As an example of statistical inference, let us consider the study conducted by Norris
Electronics. Norris manufactures a high-intensity lightbulb used in a variety of electrical
products. In an attempt to increase the useful life of the lightbulb, the product design group
developed a new lightbulb filament. In this case, the population is defined as all lightbulbs
that could be produced with the new filament. To evaluate the advantages of the new fila-
ment, 200 bulbs with the new filament were manufactured and tested. Data collected from
this sample showed the number of hours each lightbulb operated before filament burnout.
See Table 1.5.
Suppose Norris wants to use the sample data to make an inference about the average
hours of useful life for the population of all lightbulbs that could be produced with the
new filament. Adding the 200 values in Table 1.5 and dividing the total by 200 provides
the sample average lifetime for the lightbulbs: 76 hours. We can use this sample result
to estimate that the average lifetime for the lightbulbs in the population is 76 hours.
Figure 1.7 provides a graphical summary of the statistical inference process for Norris
Electronics.
Whenever statisticians use a sample to estimate a population characteristic of inter-
est, they usually provide a statement of the quality, or precision, associated with the estimate.
The U.S. government
conducts a census every 
10 years. Market research
firms conduct sample
surveys every day.

For the Norris example, the statistician might state that the point estimate of the average life-
time for the population of new lightbulbs is 76 hours with a margin of error of 4 hours.
Thus, an interval estimate of the average lifetime for all lightbulbs produced with the new
filament is 72 hours to 80 hours. The statistician can also state how confident he or she is
that the interval from 72 hours to 80 hours contains the population average.

Computers and Statistical Analysis
Statisticians frequently use computer software to perform the statistical computations re-
quired with large amounts of data. For example, computing the average lifetime for the 200
lightbulbs in the Norris Electronics example (see Table 1.5) would be quite tedious without a
computer. To facilitate computer usage, many of the data sets in this book are available on the
website that accompanies the text. The data files may be downloaded in either Minitab or 
Excel formats. In addition, the Excel add-in StatTools can be downloaded from the website.
End-of-chapter appendixes cover the step-by-step procedures for using Minitab, Excel, and
the Excel add-in StatTools to implement the statistical techniques presented in the chapter.
1.7
Data Mining
With the aid of magnetic card readers, bar code scanners, and point-of-sale terminals, most
organizations obtain large amounts of data on a daily basis. And, even for a small local
restaurant that uses touch screen monitors to enter orders and handle billing, the amount of
data collected can be significant. For large retail companies, the sheer volume of data col-
lected is hard to conceptualize, and figuring out how to effectively use these data to improve
profitability is a challenge. For example, mass retailers such as Walmart capture data on 20
to 30 million transactions every day, telecommunication companies such as France Tele-
com and AT&T generate over 300 million call records per day, and Visa processes 6800
payment transactions per second or approximately 600 million transactions per day. Stor-
ing and managing the transaction data is a significant undertaking.
The term data warehousing is used to refer to the process of capturing, storing, and
maintaining the data. Computing power and data collection tools have reached the point
where it is now feasible to store and retrieve extremely large quantities of data in seconds.
Analysis of the data in the warehouse may result in decisions that will lead to new strate-
gies and higher profits for the organization.
The subject of data mining deals with methods for developing useful decision-making
information from large data bases. Using a combination of procedures from statistics, math-
ematics, and computer science, analysts “mine the data” in the warehouse to convert it into
useful information, hence the name data mining. Dr. Kurt Thearling, a leading practitioner
in the field, defines data mining as “the automated extraction of predictive information from
large databases.” The two key words in Dr. Thearling’s definition are “automated” and “pre-
dictive.” Data mining systems that are the most effective use automated procedures to ex-
tract information from the data using only the most general or even vague queries by the
user. And data mining software automates the process of uncovering hidden predictive in-
formation that in the past required hands-on analysis.
The major applications of data mining have been made by companies with a strong con-
sumer focus, such as retail businesses, financial organizations, and communication compa-
nies. Data mining has been successfully used to help retailers such as Amazon and Barnes &
Noble determine one or more related products that customers who have already purchased a
specific product are also likely to purchase. Then, when a customer logs on to the company’s
website and purchases a product, the website uses pop-ups to alert the customer about addi-
tional products that the customer is likely to purchase. In another application, data mining may
be used to identify customers who are likely to spend more than $20 on a particular shopping
trip. These customers may then be identified as the ones to receive special e-mail or regular
mail discount offers to encourage them to make their next shopping trip before the discount
termination date.
Data mining is a technology that relies heavily on statistical methodology such as mul-
tiple regression, logistic regression, and correlation. But it takes a creative integration of all

Chapter 1
Data and Statistics
Statistical methods play an
important role in data
mining, both in terms of
discovering relationships in
the data and predicting
future outcomes. However,
a thorough coverage of
data mining and the use of
statistics in data mining is
outside the scope of this
text.
these methods and computer science technologies involving artificial intelligence and ma-
chine learning to make data mining effective. A significant investment in time and money
is required to implement commercial data mining software packages developed by firms
such as Oracle, Teradata, and SAS. The statistical concepts introduced in this text will be
helpful in understanding the statistical methodology used by data mining software pack-
ages and enable you to better understand the statistical information that is developed.
Because statistical models play an important role in developing predictive models in
data mining, many of the concerns that statisticians deal with in developing statistical mod-
els are also applicable. For instance, a concern in any statistical study involves the issue of
model reliability. Finding a statistical model that works well for a particular sample of data
does not necessarily mean that it can be reliably applied to other data. One of the common
statistical approaches to evaluating model reliability is to divide the sample data set into
two parts: a training data set and a test data set. If the model developed using the training
data is able to accurately predict values in the test data, we say that the model is reliable.
One advantage that data mining has over classical statistics is that the enormous amount of
data available allows the data mining software to partition the data set so that a model de-
veloped for the training data set may be tested for reliability on other data. In this sense, the
partitioning of the data set allows data mining to develop models and relationships and then
quickly observe if they are repeatable and valid with new and different data. On the other
hand, a warning for data mining applications is that with so much data available, there is a
danger of overfitting the model to the point that misleading associations and cause/effect
conclusions appear to exist. Careful interpretation of data mining results and additional test-
ing will help avoid this pitfall.
1.8
Ethical Guidelines for Statistical Practice
Ethical behavior is something we should strive for in all that we do. Ethical issues arise in
statistics because of the important role statistics plays in the collection, analysis, presenta-
tion, and interpretation of data. In a statistical study, unethical behavior can take a variety
of forms including improper sampling, inappropriate analysis of the data, development of
misleading graphs, use of inappropriate summary statistics, and/or a biased interpretation
of the statistical results.
As you begin to do your own statistical work, we encourage you to be fair, thorough,
objective, and neutral as you collect data, conduct analyses, make oral presentations, and
present written reports containing information developed. As a consumer of statistics, you
should also be aware of the possibility of unethical statistical behavior by others. When you
see statistics in newspapers, on television, on the Internet, and so on, it is a good idea to
view the information with some skepticism, always being aware of the source as well as the
purpose and objectivity of the statistics provided.
The American Statistical Association, the nation’s leading professional organization for
statistics and statisticians, developed the report “Ethical Guidelines for Statistical Practice”1
to help statistical practitioners make and communicate ethical decisions and assist students
in learning how to perform statistical work responsibly. The report contains 67 guidelines
organized into eight topic areas: Professionalism; Responsibilities to Funders, Clients, and
Employers; Responsibilities in Publications and Testimony; Responsibilities to Research
Subjects; Responsibilities to Research Team Colleagues; Responsibilities to Other Statisti-
cians or Statistical Practitioners; Responsibilities Regarding Allegations of Misconduct;
and Responsibilities of Employers Including Organizations, Individuals, Attorneys, or
Other Clients Employing Statistical Practitioners.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

One of the ethical guidelines in the professionalism area addresses the issue of running
multiple tests until a desired result is obtained. Let us consider an example. In Section 1.5 we
discussed a statistical study conducted by Norris Electronics involving a sample of 200 high-
intensity lightbulbs manufactured with a new filament. The average lifetime for the sample,
76 hours, provided an estimate of the average lifetime for all lightbulbs produced with the new
filament. However, consider this. Because Norris selected a sample of bulbs, it is reasonable
to assume that another sample would have provided a different average lifetime.
Suppose Norris’s management had hoped the sample results would enable it to claim
that the average lifetime for the new lightbulbs was 80 hours or more. Suppose further that
Norris’s management decides to continue the study by manufacturing and testing repeated
samples of 200 lightbulbs with the new filament until a sample mean of 80 hours or more
is obtained. If the study is repeated enough times, a sample may eventually be obtained—
by chance alone—that would provide the desired result and enable Norris to make such a
claim. In this case, consumers would be misled into thinking the new product is better than
it actually is. Clearly, this type of behavior is unethical and represents a gross misuse of sta-
tistics in practice.
Several ethical guidelines in the responsibilities and publications and testimony area deal
with issues involving the handling of data. For instance, a statistician must account for all data
considered in a study and explain the sample(s) actually used. In the Norris Electronics study
the average lifetime for the 200 bulbs in the original sample is 76 hours; this is considerably
less than the 80 hours or more that management hoped to obtain. Suppose now that after re-
viewing the results showing a 76 hour average lifetime, Norris discards all the observations
with 70 or fewer hours until burnout, allegedly because these bulbs contain imperfections
caused by startup problems in the manufacturing process. After discarding these lightbulbs,
the average lifetime for the remaining lightbulbs in the sample turns out to be 82 hours.Would
you be suspicious of Norris’s claim that the lifetime for its lightbulbs is 82 hours?
If the Norris lightbulbs showing 70 or fewer hours until burnout were discarded to sim-
ply provide an average lifetime of 82 hours, there is no question that discarding the lightbulbs
with 70 or fewer hours until burnout is unethical. But, even if the discarded lightbulbs con-
tain imperfections due to startup problems in the manufacturing process—and, as a result,
should not have been included in the analysis—the statistician who conducted the study
must account for all the data that were considered and explain how the sample actually used
was obtained. To do otherwise is potentially misleading and would constitute unethical
behavior on the part of both the company and the statistician.
A guideline in the shared values section of the American Statistical Association report
states that statistical practitioners should avoid any tendency to slant statistical work toward
predetermined outcomes. This type of unethical practice is often observed when unrepre-
sentative samples are used to make claims. For instance, in many areas of the country smok-
ing is not permitted in restaurants. Suppose, however, a lobbyist for the tobacco industry
interviews people in restaurants where smoking is permitted in order to estimate the per-
centage of people who are in favor of allowing smoking in restaurants. The sample results
show that 90% of the people interviewed are in favor of allowing smoking in restaurants.
Based upon these sample results, the lobbyist claims that 90% of all people who eat in restau-
rants are in favor of permitting smoking in restaurants. In this case we would argue that only
sampling persons eating in restaurants that allow smoking has biased the results. If only the
final results of such a study are reported, readers unfamiliar with the details of the study (i.e.,
that the sample was collected only in restaurants allowing smoking) can be misled.
The scope of the American Statistical Association’s report is broad and includes ethical
guidelines that are appropriate not only for a statistician, but also for consumers of statistical
information. We encourage you to read the report to obtain a better perspective of ethical is-
sues as you continue your study of statistics and to gain the background for determining how
to ensure that ethical standards are met when you start to use statistics in practice.

Summary
Statistics is the art and science of collecting, analyzing, presenting, and interpreting data.
Nearly every college student majoring in business or economics is required to take a course
in statistics. We began the chapter by describing typical statistical applications for business
and economics.
Data consist of the facts and figures that are collected and analyzed. Four scales of mea-
surement used to obtain data on a particular variable include nominal, ordinal, interval, and
ratio. The scale of measurement for a variable is nominal when the data are labels or names
used to identify an attribute of an element. The scale is ordinal if the data demonstrate the
properties of nominal data and the order or rank of the data is meaningful. The scale is inter-
val if the data demonstrate the properties of ordinal data and the interval between values is
expressed in terms of a fixed unit of measure. Finally, the scale of measurement is ratio if the
data show all the properties of interval data and the ratio of two values is meaningful.
For purposes of statistical analysis, data can be classified as categorical or quantitative.
Categorical data use labels or names to identify an attribute of each element. Categorical
data use either the nominal or ordinal scale of measurement and may be nonnumerical or
numerical. Quantitative data are numerical values that indicate how much or how many.
Quantitative data use either the interval or ratio scale of measurement. Ordinary arithmetic
operations are meaningful only if the data are quantitative. Therefore, statistical computa-
tions used for quantitative data are not always appropriate for categorical data.
In Sections 1.4 and 1.5 we introduced the topics of descriptive statistics and statistical
inference. Descriptive statistics are the tabular, graphical, and numerical methods used to
summarize data. The process of statistical inference uses data obtained from a sample
to make estimates or test hypotheses about the characteristics of a population. The last three
sections of the chapter provide information on the role of computers in statistical analysis,
an introduction to the relative new field of data mining, and a summary of ethical guide-
lines for statistical practice.

The Nielsen Company surveyed consumers in 47 markets from Europe, Asia-Pacific, the
Americas, and the Middle East to determine which factors are most important in deter-
mining where they buy groceries. Using a scale of 1 (low) to 5 (high), the highest rated
factor was good value for money, with an average point score of 4.32. The second highest
rated factor was better selection of high-quality brands and products, with an average point
score of 3.78, and the lowest rated factor was uses recyclable bags and packaging, with an
average point score of 2.71 (Nielsen website, February 24, 2008). Suppose that you have
been hired by a grocery store chain to conduct a similar study to determine what factors
customers at the chain’s stores in Charlotte, North Carolina, think are most important in
determining where they buy groceries.

Nielsen Media Research conducts weekly surveys of television viewing throughout the
United States, publishing both rating and market share data. The Nielsen rating is the
percentage of households with televisions watching a program, while the Nielsen share
is the percentage of households watching a program among those households with tele-
visions in use. For example, Nielsen Media Research results for the 2003 Baseball
World Series between the New York Yankees and the Florida Marlins showed a rating
of 12.8% and a share of 22% (Associated Press, October 27, 2003). Thus, 12.8% of
households with televisions were watching the World Series and 22% of households
with televisions in use were watching the World Series. Based on the rating and share
data for major television programs, Nielsen publishes a weekly ranking of television
programs as well as a weekly ranking of the four major networks: ABC, CBS, NBC,
and Fox.

Appendix An Introduction to StatTools
Excel does not contain statistical functions or data analysis tools to perform all the statisti-
cal procedures discussed in the text. StatTools is a Microsoft Excel statistics add-in that ex-
tends the range of statistical and graphical options for Excel users. Most chapters include a
chapter appendix that shows the steps required to accomplish a statistical procedure using
StatTools. For those students who want to make more extensive use of the software, Stat-
Tools offers an excellent Help facility. The StatTools Help system includes detailed expla-
nations of the statistical and data analysis options available, as well as descriptions and
definitions of the types of output provided.
Getting Started with StatTools
StatTools software may be downloaded and installed on your computer by accessing the
website that accompanies this text. After downloading and installing the software, perform
the following steps to use StatTools as an Excel add-in.
Step 1. Click the Start button on the taskbar and then point to All Programs
Step 2. Point to the folder entitled Palisade Decision Tools
Step 3. Click StatTools for Excel
These steps will open Excel and add the StatTools tab next to the Add-Ins tab on the
Excel Ribbon. Alternately, if you are already working in Excel, these steps will make 
StatTools available.
Using StatTools
Before conducting any statistical analysis, we must create a StatTools data set using the
StatTools Data Set Manager. Let us use the Excel worksheet for the mutual funds data set
in Table 1.1 to show how this is done. The following steps show how to create a StatTools
data set for the mutual funds data.
Step 1. Open the Excel file named Morningstar
Step 2. Select any cell in the data set (for example, cell A1)
Step 3. Click the StatTools tab on the Ribbon
Step 4. In the Data group, click Data Set Manager
Step 5. When StatTools asks if you want to add the range $A$1:$F$26 as a new
StatTools data set, click Yes
Step 6. When the StatTools—Data Set Manager dialog box appears, click OK
Figure 1.10 shows the StatTools—Data Set Manager dialog box that appears in step 6.
By default, the name of the new StatTools data set is Data Set #1. You can replace the name
Data Set #1 in step 6 with a more descriptive name. And, if you select the Apply Cell Format
option, the column labels will be highlighted in blue and the entire data set will have out-
side and inside borders. You can always select the Data Set Manager at any time in your
analysis to make these types of changes.
Recommended Application Settings
StatTools allows the user to specify some of the application settings that control such things
as where statistical output is displayed and how calculations are performed. The following
steps show how to access the StatTools—Application Settings dialog box.
Step 1. Click the StatTools tab on the Ribbon
Step 2. In the Tools Group, click Utilities 
Step 3. Choose Application Settings from the list of options

Descriptive Statistics: Tabular and Graphical Presentations
The Colgate-Palmolive Company started as a small soap 
and candle shop in New York City in 1806. Today, Colgate-
Palmolive employs more than 40,000 people working in
more than 200 countries and territories around the world.
Although best known for its brand names of Colgate,
Palmolive, Ajax, and Fab, the company also markets
Mennen, Hill’s Science Diet, and Hill’s Prescription Diet
products.
The Colgate-Palmolive Company uses statistics in its
quality assurance program for home laundry detergent
products. One concern is customer satisfaction with the
quantity of detergent powder in a carton. Every carton
in each size category is filled with the same amount of
detergent by weight, but the volume of detergent is
affected by the density of the detergent powder. For
instance, if the powder density is on the heavy side, a
smaller volume of detergent is needed to reach the car-
ton’s specified weight. As a result, the carton may appear
to be underfilled when opened by the consumer.
To control the problem of heavy detergent powder,
limits are placed on the acceptable range of powder
density. Statistical samples are taken periodically, and
the density of each powder sample is measured. Data
summaries are then provided for operating personnel so
that corrective action can be taken if necessary to keep
the density within the desired quality specifications.
A frequency distribution for the densities of 150
samples taken over a one-week period and a histogram
are shown in the accompanying table and figure. Density
levels above .40 are unacceptably high. The frequency
distribution and histogram show that the operation is
meeting its quality guidelines with all of the densities
less than or equal to .40. Managers viewing these statis-
tical summaries would be pleased with the quality of the
detergent production process.
In this chapter, you will learn about tabular and
graphical methods of descriptive statistics such as fre-
quency distributions, bar charts, histograms, stem-and-
leaf displays, crosstabulations, and others. The goal of
these methods is to summarize data so that the data can
be easily understood and interpreted.

As indicated in Chapter 1, data can be classified as either categorical or quantitative.
Categorical data use labels or names to identify categories of like items. Quantitative
data are numerical values that indicate how much or how many.
This chapter introduces tabular and graphical methods commonly used to summarize
both categorical and quantitative data. Tabular and graphical summaries of data can be
found in annual reports, newspaper articles, and research studies. Everyone is exposed to
these types of presentations. Hence, it is important to understand how they are prepared and
how they should be interpreted. We begin with tabular and graphical methods for summa-
rizing data concerning a single variable. The last section introduces methods for summa-
rizing data when the relationship between two variables is of interest.
Modern statistical software packages provide extensive capabilities for summarizing
data and preparing graphical presentations. Minitab and Excel are two packages that are
widely available. In the chapter appendixes, we show some of their capabilities.
2.1
Summarizing Categorical Data
Frequency Distribution
We begin the discussion of how tabular and graphical methods can be used to summarize
categorical data with the definition of a frequency distribution.
2.1
Summarizing Categorical Data
33
Let us use the following example to demonstrate the construction and interpretation of
a frequency distribution for categorical data. Coke Classic, Diet Coke, Dr. Pepper, Pepsi,
and Sprite are five popular soft drinks. Assume that the data in Table 2.1 show the soft drink
selected in a sample of 50 soft drink purchases.
FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION
A frequency distribution is a tabular summary of data showing the number (fre-
quency) of items in each of several nonoverlapping classes.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

To develop a frequency distribution for these data, we count the number of times each
soft drink appears in Table 2.1. Coke Classic appears 19 times, Diet Coke appears 8 times,
Dr. Pepper appears 5 times, Pepsi appears 13 times, and Sprite appears 5 times. These counts
are summarized in the frequency distribution in Table 2.2.
This frequency distribution provides a summary of how the 50 soft drink purchases are dis-
tributed across the five soft drinks. This summary offers more insight than the original data shown
in Table 2.1. Viewing the frequency distribution, we see that Coke Classic is the leader, Pepsi is
second, Diet Coke is third, and Sprite and Dr. Pepper are tied for fourth. The frequency distribu-
tion summarizes information about the popularity of the five soft drinks.
Relative Frequency and Percent Frequency Distributions
Afrequency distribution shows the number (frequency) of items in each of several nonover-
lapping classes. However, we are often interested in the proportion, or percentage, of items
in each class. The relative frequency of a class equals the fraction or proportion of items
belonging to a class. For a data set with n observations, the relative frequency of each class
can be determined as follows:

The percent frequency of a class is the relative frequency multiplied by 100.
Arelative frequency distribution gives a tabular summary of data showing the relative
frequency for each class. A percent frequency distribution summarizes the percent fre-
quency of the data for each class. Table 2.3 shows a relative frequency distribution and a per-
cent frequency distribution for the soft drink data. In Table 2.3 we see that the relative
frequency for Coke Classic is 19/50  .38, the relative frequency for Diet Coke is 8/50 
.16, and so on. From the percent frequency distribution, we see that 38% of the purchases
were Coke Classic, 16% of the purchases were Diet Coke, and so on. We can also note that
38%  26%  16%  80% of the purchases were the top three soft drinks.
Bar Charts and Pie Charts
Abar chart is a graphical device for depicting categorical data summarized in a frequency,
relative frequency, or percent frequency distribution. On one axis of the graph (usually the
horizontal axis), we specify the labels that are used for the classes (categories).Afrequency,
relative frequency, or percent frequency scale can be used for the other axis of the chart

(usually the vertical axis). Then, using a bar of fixed width drawn above each class label,
we extend the length of the bar until we reach the frequency, relative frequency, or percent
frequency of the class. For categorical data, the bars should be separated to emphasize the
fact that each class is separate. Figure 2.1 shows a bar chart of the frequency distribution
for the 50 soft drink purchases. Note how the graphical presentation shows Coke Classic,
Pepsi, and Diet Coke to be the most preferred brands.
The pie chart provides another graphical device for presenting relative frequency and
percent frequency distributions for categorical data. To construct a pie chart, we first draw
a circle to represent all the data. Then we use the relative frequencies to subdivide the
circle into sectors, or parts, that correspond to the relative frequency for each class. For
example, because a circle contains 360 degrees and Coke Classic shows a relative
frequency of .38, the sector of the pie chart labeled Coke Classic consists of .38(360) 
136.8 degrees. The sector of the pie chart labeled Diet Coke consists of .16(360)  57.6 
degrees. Similar calculations for the other classes yield the pie chart in Figure 2.2. The

The top four prime-time television shows were Law & Order, CSI, Without a Trace, and
Desperate Housewives (Nielsen Media Research, January 1, 2007). Data indicating the
preferred shows for a sample of 50 viewers follow.
NOTES AND COMMENTS
1. Often the number of classes in a frequency dis-
tribution is the same as the number of categories
found in the data, as is the case for the soft drink
purchase data in this section. The data involve
only five soft drinks, and a separate frequency
distribution class was defined for each one. Data
that included all soft drinks would require many
categories, most of which would have a small
number of purchases. Most statisticians recom-
mend that classes with smaller frequencies be
grouped into an aggregate class called “other.”
Classes with frequencies of 5% or less would
most often be treated in this fashion.
2. The sum of the frequencies in any frequency dis-
tribution always equals the number of observa-
tions. The sum of the relative frequencies in any
relative frequency distribution always equals
1.00, and the sum of the percentages in a percent
frequency distribution always equals 100.

The Canmark Research Center Airport Customer Satisfaction Survey uses an online
questionnaire to provide airlines and airports with customer satisfaction ratings for all
aspects of the customers’ flight experience (Airport Survey website, January 2010).
After completing a flight, customers receive an e-mail asking them to go to the website
and rate a variety of factors including the reservation process, the check-in process, lug-
gage policy, cleanliness of gate area, service by flight attendants, food/beverage selec-
tion, on-time arrival, and so on.  A five-point scale with Excellent (E), Very Good (V),
Good (G), Fair (F), and Poor (P) is used to record the customer ratings for each survey
question.  Assume that passengers on a Delta Airlines flight from Myrtle Beach, South
Carolina, to Atlanta, Georgia, provided the following ratings for the question, “Please
rate the airline based on your overall experience with this flight.”  The sample ratings
follow.

The Pew Research Center’s Social & Demographic Trends project found that 46% of U.S.
adults would rather live in a different type of community than the one where they are liv-
ing now (Pew Research Center, January 29, 2009). The national survey of 2260 adults
asked, “Where do you live now?” and “What do you consider to be the ideal community?”
Response options were City (C), Suburb (S), Small Town (T), or Rural (R). A representa-
tive portion of this survey for a sample of 100 respondents is as follows.

Summarizing Quantitative Data
Frequency Distribution
As defined in Section 2.1, a frequency distribution is a tabular summary of data showing the
number (frequency) of items in each of several nonoverlapping classes.This definition holds
for quantitative as well as categorical data. However, with quantitative data we must be more
careful in defining the nonoverlapping classes to be used in the frequency distribution.
For example, consider the quantitative data in Table 2.4. These data show the time in
days required to complete year-end audits for a sample of 20 clients of Sanderson and
Clifford, a small public accounting firm. The three steps necessary to define the classes for
a frequency distribution with quantitative data are
1. Determine the number of nonoverlapping classes.
2. Determine the width of each class.
3. Determine the class limits.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

Let us demonstrate these steps by developing a frequency distribution for the audit time data
in Table 2.4.
Number of classes Classes are formed by specifying ranges that will be used to group
the data. As a general guideline, we recommend using between 5 and 20 classes. For a small
number of data items, as few as five or six classes may be used to summarize the data. For
a larger number of data items, a larger number of classes is usually required. The goal is to
use enough classes to show the variation in the data, but not so many classes that some con-
tain only a few data items. Because the number of data items in Table 2.4 is relatively small
(n  20), we chose to develop a frequency distribution with five classes.
Width of the classes The second step in constructing a frequency distribution for quan-
titative data is to choose a width for the classes. As a general guideline, we recommend that
the width be the same for each class. Thus the choices of the number of classes and the width
of classes are not independent decisions. A larger number of classes means a smaller class
width, and vice versa. To determine an approximate class width, we begin by identifying
the largest and smallest data values. Then, with the desired number of classes specified, we
can use the following expression to determine the approximate class width.

Making the classes the
same width reduces the
chance of inappropriate
interpretations by the user.

Audit
(2.2)
Approximate class width  Largest data value  Smallest data value
Number of classes
The approximate class width given by equation (2.2) can be rounded to a more convenient
value based on the preference of the person developing the frequency distribution. For ex-
ample, an approximate class width of 9.28 might be rounded to 10 simply because 10 is a
more convenient class width to use in presenting a frequency distribution.
For the data involving the year-end audit times, the largest data value is 33 and the
smallest data value is 12. Because we decided to summarize the data with five classes,
using equation (2.2) provides an approximate class width of (33  12)/5  4.2. We there-
fore decided to round up and use a class width of five days in the frequency distribution.
In practice, the number of classes and the appropriate class width are determined by trial
and error. Once a possible number of classes is chosen, equation (2.2) is used to find the ap-
proximate class width. The process can be repeated for a different number of classes. Ulti-
mately, the analyst uses judgment to determine the combination of the number of classes and
class width that provides the best frequency distribution for summarizing the data.
For the audit time data in Table 2.4, after deciding to use five classes, each with a width
of five days, the next task is to specify the class limits for each of the classes.
Class limits Class limits must be chosen so that each data item belongs to one and only one
class. The lower class limit identifies the smallest possible data value assigned to the class. The
upper class limit identifies the largest possible data value assigned to the class. In developing
frequency distributions for qualitative data, we did not need to specify class limits because each
data item naturally fell into a separate class. But with quantitative data, such as the audit times
in Table 2.4, class limits are necessary to determine where each data value belongs.
Using the audit time data in Table 2.4, we selected 10 days as the lower class limit and
14 days as the upper class limit for the first class. This class is denoted 10–14 in Table 2.5.
The smallest data value, 12, is included in the 10–14 class. We then selected 15 days as the
lower class limit and 19 days as the upper class limit of the next class. We continued
defining the lower and upper class limits to obtain a total of five classes: 10–14, 15–19,
20–24, 25–29, and 30–34. The largest data value, 33, is included in the 30–34 class. The
difference between the lower class limits of adjacent classes is the class width. Using the
first two lower class limits of 10 and 15, we see that the class width is 15  10  5.
With the number of classes, class width, and class limits determined, a frequency dis-
tribution can be obtained by counting the number of data values belonging to each class.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

For example, the data in Table 2.4 show that four values—12, 14, 14, and 13—belong to
the 10–14 class. Thus, the frequency for the 10–14 class is 4. Continuing this counting
process for the 15–19, 20–24, 25–29, and 30–34 classes provides the frequency distribu-
tion in Table 2.5. Using this frequency distribution, we can observe the following:
1. The most frequently occurring audit times are in the class of 15–19 days. Eight of
the twenty audit times belong to this class.
2. Only one audit required 30 or more days.
Other conclusions are possible, depending on the interests of the person viewing the
frequency distribution. The value of a frequency distribution is that it provides insights
about the data that are not easily obtained by viewing the data in their original
unorganized form.
Class midpoint In some applications, we want to know the midpoints of the classes in a
frequency distribution for quantitative data. The class midpoint is the value halfway
between the lower and upper class limits. For the audit time data, the five class midpoints
are 12, 17, 22, 27, and 32.
Relative Frequency and Percent Frequency Distributions
We define the relative frequency and percent frequency distributions for quantitative data in the
same manner as for qualitative data. First, recall that the relative frequency is the proportion of
the observations belonging to a class. With n observations,
The percent frequency of a class is the relative frequency multiplied by 100.
Based on the class frequencies in Table 2.5 and with n  20, Table 2.6 shows the rela-
tive frequency distribution and percent frequency distribution for the audit time data. Note
that .40 of the audits, or 40%, required from 15 to 19 days. Only .05 of the audits, or 5%,
required 30 or more days. Again, additional interpretations and insights can be obtained by
using Table 2.6.
Dot Plot
One of the simplest graphical summaries of data is a dot plot. A horizontal axis shows the
range for the data. Each data value is represented by a dot placed above the axis. Figure 2.3
is the dot plot for the audit time data in Table 2.4. The three dots located above 18 on the hor-
izontal axis indicate that an audit time of 18 days occurred three times. Dot plots show the
details of the data and are useful for comparing the distribution of the data for two or more
variables.

Histogram
A common graphical presentation of quantitative data is a histogram. This graphical sum-
mary can be prepared for data previously summarized in either a frequency, relative 
frequency, or percent frequency distribution. A histogram is constructed by placing the 
variable of interest on the horizontal axis and the frequency, relative frequency, or percent
frequency on the vertical axis. The frequency, relative frequency, or percent frequency of
each class is shown by drawing a rectangle whose base is determined by the class limits on
the horizontal axis and whose height is the corresponding frequency, relative frequency, or
percent frequency.
Figure 2.4 is a histogram for the audit time data. Note that the class with the greatest
frequency is shown by the rectangle appearing above the class of 15–19 days. The height
of the rectangle shows that the frequency of this class is 8. A histogram for the relative or
percent frequency distribution of these data would look the same as the histogram in
Figure 2.4 with the exception that the vertical axis would be labeled with relative or percent
frequency values.
As Figure 2.4 shows, the adjacent rectangles of a histogram touch one another. Unlike
a bar graph, a histogram contains no natural separation between the rectangles of adjacent
classes. This format is the usual convention for histograms. Because the classes for the audit
time data are stated as 10–14, 15–19, 20–24, 25–29, and 30–34, one-unit spaces of 
14 to 15, 19 to 20, 24 to 25, and 29 to 30 would seem to be needed between the classes.
These spaces are eliminated when constructing a histogram. Eliminating the spaces
between classes in a histogram for the audit time data helps show that all values between
the lower limit of the first class and the upper limit of the last class are possible.

One of the most important uses of a histogram is to provide information about the
shape, or form, of a distribution. Figure 2.5 contains four histograms constructed from
relative frequency distributions. Panel A shows the histogram for a set of data moder-
ately skewed to the left. A histogram is said to be skewed to the left if its tail extends
farther to the left. This histogram is typical for exam scores, with no scores above 100%,
most of the scores above 70%, and only a few really low scores. Panel B shows the his-
togram for a set of data moderately skewed to the right. A histogram is said to be skewed
to the right if its tail extends farther to the right. An example of this type of histogram
would be for data such as housing prices; a few expensive houses create the skewness
in the right tail.
Panel C shows a symmetric histogram. In a symmetric histogram, the left tail mirrors
the shape of the right tail. Histograms for data found in applications are never perfectly sym-
metric, but the histogram for many applications may be roughly symmetric. Data for SAT
scores, heights and weights of people, and so on lead to histograms that are roughly sym-
metric. Panel D shows a histogram highly skewed to the right. This histogram was con-
structed from data on the amount of customer purchases over one day at a women’s apparel
store. Data from applications in business and economics often lead to histograms that 
are skewed to the right. For instance, data on housing prices, salaries, purchase amounts,
and so on often result in histograms skewed to the right.

Cumulative Distributions
A variation of the frequency distribution that provides another tabular summary of quanti-
tative data is the cumulative frequency distribution. The cumulative frequency distribu-
tion uses the number of classes, class widths, and class limits developed for the frequency
distribution. However, rather than showing the frequency of each class, the cumulative fre-
quency distribution shows the number of data items with values less than or equal to the
upper class limit of each class. The first two columns of Table 2.7 provide the cumulative
frequency distribution for the audit time data.
To understand how the cumulative frequencies are determined, consider the class with
the description “less than or equal to 24.” The cumulative frequency for this class is simply
the sum of the frequencies for all classes with data values less than or equal to 24. For the
frequency distribution in Table 2.5, the sum of the frequencies for classes 10–14, 15–19, and
20–24 indicates that 4  8  5  17 data values are less than or equal to 24. Hence, the cu-
mulative frequency for this class is 17. In addition, the cumulative frequency distribution in
Table 2.7 shows that four audits were completed in 14 days or less and 19 audits were com-
pleted in 29 days or less.
As a final point, we note that a cumulative relative frequency distribution shows the
proportion of data items, and a cumulative percent frequency distribution shows the per-
centage of data items with values less than or equal to the upper limit of each class. The cu-
mulative relative frequency distribution can be computed either by summing the relative
frequencies in the relative frequency distribution or by dividing the cumulative frequencies
by the total number of items. Using the latter approach, we found the cumulative relative
frequencies in column 3 of Table 2.7 by dividing the cumulative frequencies in column 2
by the total number of items (n  20). The cumulative percent frequencies were again com-
puted by multiplying the relative frequencies by 100. The cumulative relative and percent
frequency distributions show that .85 of the audits, or 85%, were completed in 24 days or
less, .95 of the audits, or 95%, were completed in 29 days or less, and so on.
Ogive
A graph of a cumulative distribution, called an ogive, shows data values on the horizontal
axis and either the cumulative frequencies, the cumulative relative frequencies, or the cu-
mulative percent frequencies on the vertical axis. Figure 2.6 illustrates an ogive for the cu-
mulative frequencies of the audit time data in Table 2.7.
The ogive is constructed by plotting a point corresponding to the cumulative frequency
of each class. Because the classes for the audit time data are 10–14, 15–19, 20–24, and so
on, one-unit gaps appear from 14 to 15, 19 to 20, and so on. These gaps are eliminated by
plotting points halfway between the class limits. Thus, 14.5 is used for the 10–14 class, 19.5

OGIVE FOR THE AUDIT TIME DATA
NOTES AND COMMENTS
1. A bar chart and a histogram are essentially the
same thing; both are graphical presentations of
the data in a frequency distribution. Ahistogram
is just a bar chart with no separation between
bars. For some discrete quantitative data, a sep-
aration between bars is also appropriate. Con-
sider, for example, the number of classes in
which a college student is enrolled. The data
may only assume integer values. Intermediate
values such as 1.5, 2.73, and so on are not pos-
sible. With continuous quantitative data, how-
ever, such as the audit times in Table 2.4, a
separation between bars is not appropriate.
2. The appropriate values for the class limits with
quantitative data depend on the level of accu-
racy of the data. For instance, with the audit time
data of Table 2.4 the limits used were integer
values. If the data were rounded to the nearest
tenth of a day (e.g., 12.3, 14.4, and so on), then
the limits would be stated in tenths of days. For
instance, the first class would be 10.0–14.9. If
the data were recorded to the nearest hundredth
of a day (e.g., 12.34, 14.45, and so on), the lim-
its would be stated in hundredths of days. For 
instance, the first class would be 10.00–14.99.
3. An open-ended class requires only a lower class
limit or an upper class limit. For example, in the
audit time data of Table 2.4, suppose two of the
audits had taken 58 and 65 days. Rather than
continue with the classes of width 5 with classes
35–39, 40–44, 45–49, and so on, we could sim-
plify the frequency distribution to show an
open-end class of “35 or more.” This class
would have a frequency of 2. Most often the
open-end class appears at the upper end of the
distribution. Sometimes an open-end class ap-
pears at the lower end of the distribution, and
occasionally such classes appear at both ends.
4. The last entry in a cumulative frequency distri-
bution always equals the total number of obser-
vations. The last entry in a cumulative relative
frequency distribution always equals 1.00 and
the last entry in a cumulative percent frequency
distribution always equals 100.
is used for the 15–19 class, and so on. The “less than or equal to 14” class with a cumula-
tive frequency of 4 is shown on the ogive in Figure 2.6 by the point located at 14.5 on the
horizontal axis and 4 on the vertical axis. The “less than or equal to 19” class with a cumu-
lative frequency of 12 is shown by the point located at 19.5 on the horizontal axis and 12
on the vertical axis. Note that one additional point is plotted at the left end of the ogive. This
point starts the ogive by showing that no data values fall below the 10–14 class. It is plot-
ted at 9.5 on the horizontal axis and 0 on the vertical axis. The plotted points are connected
by straight lines to complete the ogive.

The Golf Digest 50 lists the 50 professional golfers with the highest total annual income.
Total income is the sum of both on-course and off-course earnings. Tiger Woods ranked
first with a total annual income of $122 million. However, almost $100 million of this to-
tal was from off-course activities such as product endorsements and personal appearances.
The 10 professional golfers with the highest off-course income are shown in the following
table (Golf Digest website, February 2008).

Exploratory Data Analysis: 
The Stem-and-Leaf Display
The techniques of exploratory data analysis consist of simple arithmetic and easy-to-draw
graphs that can be used to summarize data quickly. One technique—referred to as a
stem-and-leaf display—can be used to show both the rank order and shape of a data set
simultaneously.
To illustrate the use of a stem-and-leaf display, consider the data in Table 2.8. These
data result from a 150-question aptitude test given to 50 individuals recently interviewed

for a position at Haskens Manufacturing. The data indicate the number of questions an-
swered correctly.
To develop a stem-and-leaf display, we first arrange the leading digits of each data value
to the left of a vertical line. To the right of the vertical line, we record the last digit for each
data value. Based on the top row of data in Table 2.8 (112, 72, 69, 97, and 107), the first
five entries in constructing a stem-and-leaf display would be as follows:

last digit 2 to the right of the line. Similarly, the data value 72 shows the leading digit 7
to the left of the line and last digit 2 to the right of the line. Continuing to place the last
digit of each data value on the line corresponding to its leading digit(s) provides the

With this organization of the data, sorting the digits on each line into rank order is sim-
ple. Doing so provides the stem-and-leaf display shown here.

The numbers to the left of the vertical line (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14) form the stem,
and each digit to the right of the vertical line is a leaf. For example, consider the first row
with a stem value of 6 and leaves of 8 and 9.

This row indicates that two data values have a first digit of 6. The leaves show that the data
values are 68 and 69. Similarly, the second row

To focus on the shape indicated by the stem-and-leaf display, let us use a rectangle to
contain the leaves of each stem. Doing so, we obtain the following:

Rotating this page counterclockwise onto its side provides a picture of the data that is simi-
lar to a histogram with classes of 60–69, 70–79, 80–89, and so on.
Although the stem-and-leaf display may appear to offer the same information as a his-
togram, it has two primary advantages.
1. The stem-and-leaf display is easier to construct by hand.
2. Within a class interval, the stem-and-leaf display provides more information than
the histogram because the stem-and-leaf shows the actual data.
Just as a frequency distribution or histogram has no absolute number of classes, neither does
a stem-and-leaf display have an absolute number of rows or stems. If we believe that our original
stem-and-leaf display condensed the data too much, we can easily stretch the display by using
two or more stems for each leading digit. For example, to use two stems for each leading digit,

we would place all data values ending in 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 in one row and all values ending in 5, 6,
7, 8, and 9 in a second row. The following stretched stem-and-leaf display illustrates this approach.

Note that values 72, 73, and 73 have leaves in the 0–4 range and are shown with the first
stem value of 7. The values 75, 76, and 76 have leaves in the 5–9 range and are shown with
the second stem value of 7. This stretched stem-and-leaf display is similar to a frequency
distribution with intervals of 65–69, 70–74, 75–79, and so on.
The preceding example showed a stem-and-leaf display for data with as many as three
digits. Stem-and-leaf displays for data with more than three digits are possible. For ex-
ample, consider the following data on the number of hamburgers sold by a fast-food restau-
rant for each of 15 weeks.

Note that a single digit is used to define each leaf and that only the first three digits of each
data value have been used to construct the display. At the top of the display we have speci-
fied Leaf unit  10. To illustrate how to interpret the values in the display, consider the first
stem, 15, and its associated leaf, 6. Combining these numbers, we obtain 156. To recon-
struct an approximation of the original data value, we must multiply this number by 10, the
value of the leaf unit. Thus, 156  10  1560 is an approximation of the original data value
used to construct the stem-and-leaf display. Although it is not possible to reconstruct the
exact data value from this stem-and-leaf display, the convention of using a single digit for
each leaf enables stem-and-leaf displays to be constructed for data having a large number
of digits. For stem-and-leaf displays where the leaf unit is not shown, the leaf unit is
assumed to equal 1.

In a stretched stem-and-leaf
display, whenever a stem
value is stated twice, the
first value corresponds to
leaf values of 0–4, and the
second value corresponds
to leaf values of 5–9.
A single digit is used to
define each leaf in a stem-
and-leaf display. The leaf
unit indicates how to
multiply the stem-and-leaf
numbers in order to
approximate the original
data. Leaf units may be
100, 10, 1, 0.1, and so on.

Crosstabulations and Scatter Diagrams
Thus far in this chapter, we have focused on tabular and graphical methods used to summarize
the data for one variable at a time. Often a manager or decision maker requires tabular and
graphical methods that will assist in the understanding of the relationship between two vari-
ables. Crosstabulation and scatter diagrams are two such methods.
Crosstabulation
A crosstabulation is a tabular summary of data for two variables. Let us illustrate the use
of a crosstabulation by considering the following application based on data from Zagat’s
Restaurant Review. The quality rating and the meal price data were collected for a sample
of 300 restaurants located in the Los Angeles area. Table 2.9 shows the data for the first 10
restaurants. Data on a restaurant’s quality rating and typical meal price are reported. Qual-
ity rating is a categorical variable with rating categories of good, very good, and excellent.
Meal price is a quantitative variable that ranges from $10 to $49.
A crosstabulation of the data for this application is shown in Table 2.10. The left 
and top margin labels define the classes for the two variables. In the left margin, the row labels
(good, very good, and excellent) correspond to the three classes of the quality rating variable.
In the top margin, the column labels ($10–19, $20–29, $30–39, and $40–49) correspond to

Restaurant
the four classes of the meal price variable. Each restaurant in the sample provides a quality
rating and a meal price. Thus, each restaurant in the sample is associated with a cell appearing
in one of the rows and one of the columns of the crosstabulation. For example, restaurant 5 is
identified as having a very good quality rating and a meal price of $33. This restaurant belongs
to the cell in row 2 and column 3 of Table 2.10. In constructing a crosstabulation, we simply
count the number of restaurants that belong to each of the cells in the crosstabulation table.
In reviewing Table 2.10, we see that the greatest number of restaurants in the sample
(64) have a very good rating and a meal price in the $20–29 range. Only two restaurants have
an excellent rating and a meal price in the $10–19 range. Similar interpretations of the other
frequencies can be made. In addition, note that the right and bottom margins of the crosstab-
ulation provide the frequency distributions for quality rating and meal price separately. From
the frequency distribution in the right margin, we see that data on quality ratings show 84
good restaurants, 150 very good restaurants, and 66 excellent restaurants. Similarly, the bot-
tom margin shows the frequency distribution for the meal price variable.
Dividing the totals in the right margin of the crosstabulation by the total for that column
provides a relative and percent frequency distribution for the quality rating variable.

From the percent frequency distribution we see that 28% of the restaurants were rated good,
50% were rated very good, and 22% were rated excellent.
Dividing the totals in the bottom row of the crosstabulation by the total for that row pro-
vides a relative and percent frequency distribution for the meal price variable.
56
Chapter 2
Descriptive Statistics: Tabular and Graphical Presentations
Note that the sum of the values in each column does not add exactly to the column total,
because the values being summed are rounded. From the percent frequency distribution we
see that 26% of the meal prices are in the lowest price class ($10–19), 39% are in the next
higher class, and so on.
The frequency and relative frequency distributions constructed from the margins of a
crosstabulation provide information about each of the variables individually, but they do not
shed any light on the relationship between the variables. The primary value of a crosstabula-
tion lies in the insight it offers about the relationship between the variables. A review of the
crosstabulation in Table 2.10 reveals that higher meal prices are associated with the higher
quality restaurants, and the lower meal prices are associated with the lower quality restaurants.
Converting the entries in a crosstabulation into row percentages or column percentages
can provide more insight into the relationship between the two variables. For row percentages,
the results of dividing each frequency in Table 2.10 by its corresponding row total are shown
in Table 2.11. Each row of Table 2.11 is a percent frequency distribution of meal price for one
of the quality rating categories. Of the restaurants with the lowest quality rating (good), we see
that the greatest percentages are for the less expensive restaurants (50% have $10–19 meal
prices and 47.6% have $20–29 meal prices). Of the restaurants with the highest quality rating
(excellent), we see that the greatest percentages are for the more expensive restaurants (42.4%
have $30–39 meal prices and 33.4% have $40–49 meal prices). Thus, we continue to see that
the more expensive meals are associated with the higher quality restaurants.
Crosstabulation is widely used for examining the relationship between two vari-
ables. In practice, the final reports for many statistical studies include a large number of 
crosstabulation tables. In the Los Angeles restaurant survey, the crosstabulation is based on
one qualitative variable (quality rating) and one quantitative variable (meal price).
Crosstabulations can also be developed when both variables are qualitative and when both
variables are quantitative. When quantitative variables are used, however, we must first cre-
ate classes for the values of the variable. For instance, in the restaurant example we grouped
the meal prices into four classes ($10–19, $20–29, $30–39, and $40–49).

Simpson’s Paradox
The data in two or more crosstabulations are often combined or aggregated to produce a
summary crosstabulation showing how two variables are related. In such cases, we must be
careful in drawing a conclusion because a conclusion based upon aggregate data can be re-
versed if we look at the unaggregated data. The reversal of conclusions based on aggregate
and unaggregated data is called Simpson’s paradox. To provide an illustration of Simp-
son’s paradox, we consider an example involving the analysis of verdicts for two judges in
two different courts.
Judges Ron Luckett and Dennis Kendall presided over cases in Common Pleas Court
and Municipal Court during the past three years. Some of the verdicts they rendered were
appealed. In most of these cases the appeals court upheld the original verdicts, but in some
cases those verdicts were reversed. For each judge a crosstabulation was developed based
upon two variables: Verdict (upheld or reversed) and Type of Court (Common Pleas and
Municipal). Suppose that the two crosstabulations were then combined by aggregating the
type of court data. The resulting aggregated crosstabulation contains two variables: Verdict
(upheld or reversed) and Judge (Luckett or Kendall). This crosstabulation shows the num-
ber of appeals in which the verdict was upheld and the number in which the verdict was re-
versed for both judges. The following crosstabulation shows these results along with the
column percentages in parentheses next to each value.

A review of the column percentages shows that 86% of the verdicts were upheld for Judge
Luckett, while 88% of the verdicts were upheld for Judge Kendall. From this aggregated
crosstabulation, we conclude that Judge Kendall is doing the better job because a greater
percentage of Judge Kendall’s verdicts are being upheld.
The following unaggregated crosstabulations show the cases tried by Judge Luckett and
Judge Kendall in each court; column percentages are shown in parentheses next to each value.
From the crosstabulation and column percentages for Judge Luckett, we see that the verdicts
were upheld in 91% of the Common Pleas Court cases and in 85% of the Municipal Court
cases. From the crosstabulation and column percentages for Judge Kendall, we see that the ver-
dicts were upheld in 90% of the Common Pleas Court cases and in 80% of the Municipal Court
cases. Thus, when we unaggregate the data, we see that Judge Luckett has a better record be-
cause a greater percentage of Judge Luckett’s verdicts are being upheld in both courts. This re-
sult contradicts the conclusion we reached with the aggregated data crosstabulation, which
showed Judge Kendall had the better record. This reversal of conclusions based on aggregated
and unaggregated data illustrates Simpson’s paradox.

Descriptive Statistics: Tabular and Graphical Presentations
The original crosstabulation was obtained by aggregating the data in the separate
crosstabulations for the two courts. Note that for both judges the percentage of appeals that
resulted in reversals was much higher in Municipal Court than in Common Pleas Court.
Because Judge Luckett tried a much higher percentage of his cases in Municipal Court, the
aggregated data favored Judge Kendall. When we look at the crosstabulations for the two
courts separately, however, Judge Luckett shows the better record. Thus, for the original
crosstabulation, we see that the type of court is a hidden variable that cannot be ignored
when evaluating the records of the two judges.
Because of the possibility of Simpson’s paradox, realize that the conclusion or interpre-
tation may be reversed depending upon whether you are viewing unaggregated or aggregate
crosstabulation data. Before drawing a conclusion, you may want to investigate whether the
aggregate or unaggregate form of the crosstabulation provides the better insight and conclu-
sion. Especially when the crosstabulation involves aggreagrated data, you should investigate
whether a hidden variable could affect the results such that separate or unaggregated
crosstabulations provide a different and possibly better insight and conclusion.
Scatter Diagram and Trendline
Ascatter diagram is a graphical presentation of the relationship between two quantitative vari-
ables, and a trendline is a line that provides an approximation of the relationship. As an illus-
tration, consider the advertising/sales relationship for a stereo and sound equipment store in San
Francisco. On 10 occasions during the past three months, the store used weekend television com-
mercials to promote sales at its stores. The managers want to investigate whether a relationship
exists between the number of commercials shown and sales at the store during the following
week. Sample data for the 10 weeks with sales in hundreds of dollars are shown in Table 2.12.
Figure 2.7 shows the scatter diagram and the trendline1 for the data in Table 2.12. The num-
ber of commercials (x) is shown on the horizontal axis and the sales (y) are shown on the ver-
tical axis. For week 1, x  2 and y  50. Apoint with those coordinates is plotted on the scatter
diagram. Similar points are plotted for the other nine weeks. Note that during two of the weeks
one commercial was shown, during two of the weeks two commercials were shown, and so on.
The completed scatter diagram in Figure 2.7 indicates a positive relationship between the
number of commercials and sales. Higher sales are associated with a higher number of com-
mercials. The relationship is not perfect in that all points are not on a straight line. However, the
general pattern of the points and the trendline suggest that the overall relationship is positive.

the line intersects the y-axis) is 36.15. We will discuss in detail the interpretation of the slope and y-intercept for a linear
trendline in Chapter 14 when we study simple linear regression.

Some general scatter diagram patterns and the types of relationships they suggest are
shown in Figure 2.8. The top left panel depicts a positive relationship similar to the one for
the number of commercials and sales example. In the top right panel, the scatter diagram
shows no apparent relationship between the variables. The bottom panel depicts a negative
relationship where y tends to decrease as x increases.

Recently, management at Oak Tree Golf Course received a few complaints about the con-
dition of the greens. Several players complained that the greens are too fast. Rather than
react to the comments of just a few, the Golf Association conducted a survey of 100 male
and 100 female golfers. The survey results are summarized here.

Summary
Aset of data, even if modest in size, is often difficult to interpret directly in the form in which
it is gathered. Tabular and graphical methods provide procedures for organizing and sum-
marizing data so that patterns are revealed and the data are more easily interpreted. Fre-
quency distributions, relative frequency distributions, percent frequency distributions, bar
charts, and pie charts were presented as tabular and graphical procedures for summarizing
qualitative data. Frequency distributions, relative frequency distributions, percent frequency
distributions, histograms, cumulative frequency distributions, cumulative relative frequency
distributions, cumulative percent frequency distributions, and ogives were presented as
ways of summarizing quantitative data. A stem-and-leaf display provides an exploratory
data analysis technique that can be used to summarize quantitative data. Crosstabulation was
presented as a tabular method for summarizing data for two variables. The scatter diagram
was introduced as a graphical method for showing the relationship between two quantitative
variables. Figure 2.9 shows the tabular and graphical methods presented in this chapter.

With large data sets, computer software packages are essential in constructing tabular
and graphical summaries of data. In the chapter appendixes, we show how Minitab, Excel,
and StatTools can be used for this purpose.
Glossary
Categorical data Labels or names used to identify categories of like items.
Quantitative data Numerical values that indicate how much or how many.
Frequency distribution A tabular summary of data showing the number (frequency) of
data values in each of several nonoverlapping classes.
Relative frequency distribution A tabular summary of data showing the fraction or pro-
portion of data values in each of several nonoverlapping classes.
Percent frequency distributionAtabular summary of data showing the percentage of data
values in each of several nonoverlapping classes.
Bar chart A graphical device for depicting qualitative data that have been summarized in
a frequency, relative frequency, or percent frequency distribution.
Pie chart A graphical device for presenting data summaries based on subdivision of a cir-
cle into sectors that correspond to the relative frequency for each class.
Class midpoint The value halfway between the lower and upper class limits.
Dot plot A graphical device that summarizes data by the number of dots above each data
value on the horizontal axis.

Descriptive Statistics: Tabular and Graphical Presentations
Histogram A graphical presentation of a frequency distribution, relative frequency distri-
bution, or percent frequency distribution of quantitative data constructed by placing the
class intervals on the horizontal axis and the frequencies, relative frequencies, or percent
frequencies on the vertical axis.
Cumulative frequency distribution A tabular summary of quantitative data showing the
number of data values that are less than or equal to the upper class limit of each class.
Cumulative relative frequency distribution A tabular summary of quantitative data
showing the fraction or proportion of data values that are less than or equal to the upper
class limit of each class.
Cumulative percent frequency distribution A tabular summary of quantitative data show-
ingthepercentageofdatavaluesthatarelessthanorequaltotheupperclasslimitofeachclass.
Ogive A graph of a cumulative distribution.
Exploratory data analysis Methods that use simple arithmetic and easy-to-draw graphs to
summarize data quickly.
Stem-and-leaf display An exploratory data analysis technique that simultaneously rank
orders quantitative data and provides insight about the shape of the distribution.
Crosstabulation A tabular summary of data for two variables. The classes for one variable
are represented by the rows; the classes for the other variable are represented by the columns.
Simpson’s paradox Conclusions drawn from two or more separate crosstabulations that
can be reversed when the data are aggregated into a single crosstabulation.
Scatterdiagram Agraphical presentation of the relationship between two quantitative variables.
One variable is shown on the horizontal axis and the other variable is shown on the vertical axis.
Trendline A line that provides an approximation of the relationship between two variables.

Western University has only one women’s softball scholarship remaining for the coming
year. The final two players that Western is considering are Allison Fealey and Emily 
Janson. The coaching staff has concluded that the speed and defensive skills are virtually
identical for the two players, and that the final decision will be based on which player
has the best batting average. Crosstabulations of each player’s batting performance in
their junior and senior years of high school are as follows:
A player’s batting average is computed by dividing the number of hits a player has by the
total number of at-bats. Batting averages are represented as a decimal number with three
places after the decimal.
a.
Calculate the batting average for each player in her junior year. Then calculate the bat-
ting average of each player in her senior year. Using this analysis, which player should
be awarded the scholarship? Explain.

Case Problem 1 Pelican Stores
Pelican Stores, a division of National Clothing, is a chain of women’s apparel stores oper-
ating throughout the country. The chain recently ran a promotion in which discount
coupons were sent to customers of other National Clothing stores. Data collected for a
sample of 100 in-store credit card transactions at Pelican Stores during one day while the
promotion was running are contained in the file named PelicanStores. Table 2.17 shows a
portion of the data set. The Proprietary Card method of payment refers to charges made
using a National Clothing charge card. Customers who made a purchase using a discount
coupon are referred to as promotional customers and customers who made a purchase but
did not use a discount coupon are referred to as regular customers. Because the promo-
tional coupons were not sent to regular Pelican Stores customers, management considers
the sales made to people presenting the promotional coupons as sales it would not other-
wise make. Of course, Pelican also hopes that the promotional customers will continue to
shop at its stores.

The total number of items purchased
Net Sales
The total amount ($) charged to the credit card
Pelican’s management would like to use this sample data to learn about its customer
base and to evaluate the promotion involving discount coupons.
Managerial Report
Use the tabular and graphical methods of descriptive statistics to help management develop
a customer profile and to evaluate the promotional campaign. At a minimum, your report
should include the following:
1. Percent frequency distribution for key variables
2. A bar chart or pie chart showing the number of customer purchases attributable to
the method of payment
3. A crosstabulation of type of customer (regular or promotional) versus net sales.
Comment on any similarities or differences present
4. A scatter diagram to explore the relationship between net sales and customer age
Case Problem 2 Motion Picture Industry
The motion picture industry is a competitive business. More than 50 studios produce a total
of 300 to 400 new motion pictures each year, and the financial success of each motion
picture varies considerably. The opening weekend gross sales ($ millions), the total gross
sales ($ millions), the number of theaters the movie was shown in, and the number of weeks
the motion picture was in the top 60 for gross sales are common variables used to measure
the success of a motion picture. Data collected for a sample of 100 motion pictures pro-
duced in 2005 are contained in the file named Movies. Table 2.18 shows the data for the
first 10 motion pictures in this file.

Appendix 2.1 Tabular and Graphical Presentations 
Using Minitab 
Minitab offers extensive capabilities for constructing tabular and graphical summaries of
data. In this appendix we show how Minitab can be used to construct several graphical sum-
maries and the tabular summary of a crosstabulation. The graphical methods presented
include the dot plot, the histogram, the stem-and-leaf display, and the scatter diagram.
Dot Plot
We use the audit time data in Table 2.4 to demonstrate. The data are in column C1 of a
Minitab worksheet. The following steps will generate a dot plot.
Step 1. Select the Graph menu and choose Dotplot
Step 2. Select One Y, Simple and click OK
Step 3. When the Dotplot-One Y, Simple dialog box appears:
Enter C1 in the Graph Variables box
Click OK
Histogram
We show how to construct a histogram with frequencies on the vertical axis using the audit
time data in Table 2.4. The data are in column C1 of a Minitab worksheet. The following
steps will generate a histogram for audit times.
Step 1. Select the Graph menu
Step 2. Choose Histogram
Step 3. Select Simple and click OK
Step 4. When the Histogram-Simple dialog box appears:
Enter C1 in the Graph Variables box
Click OK
Step 5. When the Histogram appears:
Position the mouse pointer over any one of the bars
Double-click
Step 6. When the Edit Bars dialog box appears:
Click on the Binning tab
Select Cutpoint for Interval Type
Select Midpoint/Cutpoint positions for Interval Definition
Enter 10:35/5 in the Midpoint/Cutpoint positions box*
Click OK

Note that Minitab also provides the option of scaling the x-axis so that the numerical
values appear at the midpoints of the histogram rectangles. If this option is desired,
modify step 6 to include Select Midpoint for Interval Type and Enter 12:32/5 in the
Midpoint/Cutpoint positions box. These steps provide the same histogram with the
midpoints of the histogram rectangles labeled 12, 17, 22, 27, and 32.
Stem-and-Leaf Display
We use the aptitude test data in Table 2.8 to demonstrate the construction of a stem-and-leaf
display. The data are in column C1 of a Minitab worksheet. The following steps will gen-
erate the stretched stem-and-leaf display shown in Section 2.3.
Step 1. Select the Graph menu
Step 2. Choose Stem-and-Leaf
Step 3. When the Stem-and-Leaf dialog box appears:
Enter C1 in the Graph Variables box
Click OK
Scatter Diagram
We use the stereo and sound equipment store data in Table 2.12 to demonstrate the con-
struction of a scatter diagram. The weeks are numbered from 1 to 10 in column C1, the 
data for number of commercials are in column C2, and the data for sales are in column C3
of a Minitab worksheet. The following steps will generate the scatter diagram shown in
Figure 2.7.
Step 1. Select the Graph menu
Step 2. Choose Scatterplot
Step 3. Select Simple and click OK
Step 4. When the Scatterplot-Simple dialog box appears:
Enter C3 under Y variables and C2 under X variables
Click OK
Crosstabulation
We use the data from Zagat’s Restaurant Review, part of which is shown in Table 2.9, to
demonstrate. The restaurants are numbered from 1 to 300 in column C1 of the Minitab
worksheet. The quality ratings are in column C2, and the meal prices are in column C3.
Minitab can only create a crosstabulation for qualitative variables and meal price is a
quantitative variable. So we need to first code the meal price data by specifying the class to
which each meal price belongs. The following steps will code the meal price data to create
four classes of meal price in column C4: $10–19, $20–29, $30–39, and $40–49.
Step 1. Select the Data menu
Step 2. Choose Code
Step 3. Choose Numerical to Text
Step 4. When the Code-Numerical to Text dialog box appears:
Enter C3 in the Code data from columns box
Enter C4 in the Store coded data in columns box
Enter 10:19 in the first Original values box and $10–19 in the adjacent 
New box
Enter 20:29 in the second Original values box and $20–29 in the adjacent 
New box

For each meal price in column C3, the associated meal price category will now appear
in column C4. We can now develop a crosstabulation for quality rating and the meal price
categories by using the data in columns C2 and C4. The following steps will create a
crosstabulation containing the same information as shown in Table 2.10.
Step 1. Select the Stat menu

Appendix 2.2 Tabular and Graphical Presentations
Using Excel 
Excel offers extensive capabilities for constructing tabular and graphical summaries of
data. In this appendix, we show how Excel can be used to construct a frequency distribu-
tion, bar chart, pie chart, histogram, scatter diagram, and crosstabulation. We will demon-
strate three of Excel’s most powerful tools for data analysis: chart tools, PivotChart Report,
and PivotTable Report.
Frequency Distribution and Bar Chart 
for Categorical Data
In this section we show how Excel can be used to construct a frequency distribution and a
bar chart for categorical data. We illustrate each using the data on soft drink purchases in
Table 2.1.
Frequency distribution We begin by showing how the COUNTIF function can be used
to construct a frequency distribution for the data in Table 2.1. Refer to Figure 2.10 as we
describe the steps involved. The formula worksheet (showing the functions and formulas
used) is set in the background, and the value worksheet (showing the results obtained using
the functions and formulas) appears in the foreground.
The label “Brand Purchased” and the data for the 50 soft drink purchases are in cells
A1:A51. We also entered the labels “Soft Drink” and “Frequency” in cells C1:D1. The five
soft drink names are entered into cells C2:C6. Excel’s COUNTIF function can now be used
to count the number of times each soft drink appears in cells A2:A51. The following steps
are used.
Step 1. Select cell D2
Step 2. Enter =COUNTIF($A$2:$A$51,C2)
Step 3. Copy cell D2 to cells D3:D6
The formula worksheet in Figure 2.10 shows the cell formulas inserted by applying
these steps. The value worksheet shows the values computed by the cell formulas. This
worksheet shows the same frequency distribution that we developed in Table 2.2.

Go to the Axis Options section
Select Fixed for Major Unit and enter 5.0 in the corresponding box
Click Close
The resulting bar chart is shown in Figure 2.11.*
Excel can produce a pie chart for the soft drink data in a similar fashion. The major dif-
ference is that in step 3 we would click Pie in the Charts group. Several style pie charts are
available.
Frequency Distribution and Histogram 
for Quantitative Data
Excel’s PivotTable Report is an interactive tool that allows you to quickly summarize data
in a variety of ways, including developing a frequency distribution for quantitative data.
Once a frequency distribution is created using the PivotTable Report, Excel’s chart tools can
thenbeusedtoconstructthecorrespondinghistogram.But,usingExcel’sPivotChartReport,
we can construct a frequency distribution and a histogram simultaneously. We will illustrate
this procedure using the audit time data in Table 2.4. The label “Audit Time” and the 20 au-
dit time values are entered into cellsA1:A21 of an Excel worksheet. The following steps de-
scribe how to use Excel’s PivotChart Report to construct a frequency distribution and a
histogram for the audit time data. Refer to Figure 2.12 as we describe the steps involved.

Crosstabulation
Excel’s PivotTable Report provides an excellent way to summarize the data for two or more
variables simultaneously. We will illustrate the use of Excel’s PivotTable Report by show-
ing how to develop a crosstabulation of quality ratings and meal prices for the sample of
300 Los Angeles restaurants. We will use the data in the file named Restaurant; the labels
“Restaurant,” “Quality Rating,” and “Meal Price ($)” have been entered into cells A1:C1
of the worksheet as shown in Figure 2.13. The data for each of the restaurants in the sam-
ple have been entered into cells B2:C301.

In order to use the Pivot Table report to create a crosstabulation, we need to perform three
tasks: Display the Initial PivotTable Field List and PivotTable Report; Set Up the PivotTable
Field List; and Finalize the PivotTable Report. These tasks are described as follows.
Display the Initial PivotTable Field List and PivotTable Report:
The following steps
will display the initial PivotTable Field List and PivotTable report.
Step 1. Click the Insert tab on the Ribbon
Step 2. In the Tables group, click the icon above the word PivotTable
Step 3. When the Create PivotTable dialog box appears:
Choose Select a table or range
Enter A1:C301 in the Table/Range box
Choose New Worksheet as the location for the PivotTable Report
Click OK
The resulting initial PivotTable Field List and PivotTable Report are shown in Figure 2.14.
Set Up the PivotTable Field List:
Each of the three columns in Figure 2.13 (labeled
Restaurant, Quality Rating, and Meal Price ($)) is considered a field by Excel. Fields may
be chosen to represent rows, columns, or values in the body of the PivotTable Report. The
following steps show how to use Excel’s PivotTable Field List to assign the Quality Rating
field to the rows, the Meal Price ($) field to the columns, and the Restaurant field to the
body of the PivotTable report.
Step 1. In the PivotTable Field List, go to Choose Fields to add to report
Drag the Quality Rating field to the Row Labels area
Drag the Meal Price ($) field to the Column Labels area
Drag the Restaurant field to the Values area

Appendix 2.3 Tabular and Graphical Presentations 
Using StatTools
In this appendix we show how StatTools can be used to construct a histogram and a scatter
diagram.
Histogram
We use the audit time data in Table 2.4 to illustrate. Begin by using the Data Set Manager
to create a StatTools data set for these data using the procedure described in the appendix
in Chapter 1. The following steps will generate a histogram.
Step 1. Click the StatTools tab on the Ribbon
Step 2. In the Analyses Group, click Summary Graphs
Step 3. Choose the Histogram option
Step 4. When the StatTools—Histogram dialog box appears:
In the Variables section, select Audit Time
In the Options section,
Enter 5 in the Number of Bins box
Enter 9.5 in the Histogram Minimum box
Enter 34.5 in the Histogram Maximum box
Choose Categorical in the X-Axis box
Choose Frequency in the Y-Axis box
Click OK
A histogram for the audit time data similar to the histogram shown in Figure 2.12 will
appear. The only difference is the histogram developed using StatTools shows the class mid-
points on the horizontal axis.
Scatter Diagram
We use the stereo and sound equipment data in Table 2.12 to demonstrate the construction
of a scatter diagram. Begin by using the Data Set Manager to create a StatTools data set for
these data using the procedure described in the appendix in Chapter 1. The following steps
will generate a scatter diagram.
Step 1. Click the StatTools tab on the Ribbon
Step 2. In the Analyses Group, click Summary Graphs
Step 3. Choose the Scatterplot option
Step 4. When the StatTools—Scatterplot dialog box appears:
In the Variables section,
In the column labeled X, select No. of Commercials
In the column labeled Y, select Sales Volume
Click OK
A scatter diagram similar to the one shown in Figure 2.17 will appear.

STATISTICS in PRACTICE
Founded in 1997, Small Fry Design is a toy and acces-
sory company that designs and imports products for in-
fants. The company’s product line includes teddy bears,
mobiles, musical toys, rattles, and security blankets and
features high-quality soft toy designs with an emphasis
on color, texture, and sound. The products are designed
in the United States and manufactured in China.
Small Fry Design uses independent representatives
to sell the products to infant furnishing retailers, chil-
dren’s accessory and apparel stores, gift shops, upscale
department stores, and major catalog companies. Cur-
rently, Small Fry Design products are distributed in more
than 1000 retail outlets throughout the United States.
Cash flow management is one of the most critical ac-
tivities in the day-to-day operation of this company. En-
suring sufficient incoming cash to meet both current and
ongoing debt obligations can mean the difference between
business success and failure. A critical factor in cash flow
management is the analysis and control of accounts re-
ceivable. By measuring the average age and dollar value
of outstanding invoices, management can predict cash
availability and monitor changes in the status of accounts
receivable. The company set the following goals: the av-
erage age for outstanding invoices should not exceed 45
days, and the dollar value of invoices more than 60 days
old should not exceed 5% of the dollar value of all ac-
counts receivable.
In a recent summary of accounts receivable status,
the following descriptive statistics were provided for the
age of outstanding invoices:
Mean
40 days
Median
35 days
Mode
31 days
Interpretation of these statistics shows that the mean or
average age of an invoice is 40 days. The median shows
that half of the invoices remain outstanding 35 days or
more. The mode of 31 days, the most frequent invoice
age, indicates that the most common length of time an in-
voice is outstanding is 31 days. The statistical summary
also showed that only 3% of the dollar value of all ac-
counts receivable was more than 60 days old. Based on
the statistical information, management was satisfied
that accounts receivable and incoming cash flow were
under control.
In this chapter, you will learn how to compute and
interpret some of the statistical measures used by Small
Fry Design. In addition to the mean, median, and mode,
you will learn about other descriptive statistics such as
the range, variance, standard deviation, percentiles, and
correlation. These numerical measures will assist in the
understanding and interpretation of data.
Small Fry Design uses descriptive statistics to
monitor its accounts receivable and incoming 
cash flow.

*The authors are indebted to John A. McCarthy, President of Small Fry
Design, for providing this Statistics in Practice.
In Chapter 2 we discussed tabular and graphical presentations used to summarize data. In
this chapter, we present several numerical measures that provide additional alternatives for
summarizing data.
We start by developing numerical summary measures for data sets consisting of a sin-
gle variable. When a data set contains more than one variable, the same numerical measures
can be computed separately for each variable. However, in the two-variable case, we will
also develop measures of the relationship between the variables.

Descriptive Statistics: Numerical Measures
SAMPLE MEAN
(3.1)
x¯  xi
n
The sample mean is a
sample statistic.
x¯
Numerical measures of location, dispersion, shape, and association are introduced. If
the measures are computed for data from a sample, they are called sample statistics. If the
measures are computed for data from a population, they are called population parameters.
In statistical inference, a sample statistic is referred to as the point estimator of the corre-
sponding population parameter. In Chapter 7 we will discuss in more detail the process of
point estimation.
In the three chapter appendixes we show how Minitab, Excel, and StatTools can be used
to compute the numerical measures described in the chapter.
3.1
Measures of Location
Mean
Perhaps the most important measure of location is the mean, or average value, for a vari-
able. The mean provides a measure of central location for the data. If the data are for a
sample, the mean is denoted by ; if the data are for a population, the mean is denoted by
the Greek letter μ.
In statistical formulas, it is customary to denote the value of variable x for the first ob-
servation by x1, the value of variable x for the second observation by x2, and so on. In gen-
eral, the value of variable x for the ith observation is denoted by xi. For a sample with n
observations, the formula for the sample mean is as follows.
x¯
In the preceding formula, the numerator is the sum of the values of the n observations. That is,
The Greek letter  is the summation sign.
To illustrate the computation of a sample mean, let us consider the following class size
data for a sample of five college classes.
We use the notation x1, x2, x3, x4, x5 to represent the number of students in each of the 
five classes.
Hence, to compute the sample mean, we can write
The sample mean class size is 44 students.
Another illustration of the computation of a sample mean is given in the following situ-
ation. Suppose that a college placement office sent a questionnaire to a sample of business
school graduates requesting information on monthly starting salaries. Table 3.1 shows the

formula for computing the mean of a population remains the same, but we use different

vations in a population is denoted by N and the symbol for a population mean is μ.

Median
The median is another measure of central location. The median is the value in the middle
when the data are arranged in ascending order (smallest value to largest value). With an odd
number of observations, the median is the middle value. An even number of observations
has no single middle value. In this case, we follow convention and define the median as the
average of the values for the middle two observations. For convenience the definition of the
median is restated as follows.

Chapter 3
Descriptive Statistics: Numerical Measures
Let us apply this definition to compute the median class size for the sample of five college
classes. Arranging the data in ascending order provides the following list:
Because n  5 is odd, the median is the middle value. Thus the median class size is 46 stu-
dents. Even though this data set contains two observations with values of 46, each obser-
vation is treated separately when we arrange the data in ascending order.
Suppose we also compute the median starting salary for the 12 business college gradu-
ates in Table 3.1. We first arrange the data in ascending order:
3310
3355
3450
3480
3480
3490
3520
3540
3550
3650
3730
3925
14243
Middle Two Values
Because n  12 is even, we identify the middle two values: 3490 and 3520. The median is
the average of these values.
Although the mean is the more commonly used measure of central location, in some
situations the median is preferred. The mean is influenced by extremely small and large data
values. For instance, suppose that one of the graduates (see Table 3.1) had a starting salary
of $10,000 per month (maybe the individual’s family owns the company). If we change the
highest monthly starting salary in Table 3.1 from $3925 to $10,000 and recompute the
mean, the sample mean changes from $3540 to $4046. The median of $3505, however, is
unchanged, because $3490 and $3520 are still the middle two values. With the extremely
high starting salary included, the median provides a better measure of central location than
the mean. We can generalize to say that whenever a data set contains extreme values, the
median is often the preferred measure of central location.
Mode
A third measure of location is the mode. The mode is defined as follows.
Median  3490  3520
2
 3505
32  42  46  46  54
To illustrate the identification of the mode, consider the sample of five class sizes. The
only value that occurs more than once is 46. Because this value, occurring with a fre-
quency of 2, has the greatest frequency, it is the mode. As another illustration, consider the
sample of starting salaries for the business school graduates. The only monthly starting
salary that occurs more than once is $3480. Because this value has the greatest frequency, it
is the mode.
Situations can arise for which the greatest frequency occurs at two or more different
values. In these instances more than one mode exists. If the data contain exactly two modes,
we say that the data are bimodal. If data contain more than two modes, we say that the data
are multimodal. In multimodal cases the mode is almost never reported because listing three
or more modes would not be particularly helpful in describing a location for the data.
The median is the measure
of location most often
reported for annual income
and property value data
because a few extremely
large incomes or property
values can inflate the mean.
In such cases, the median is
the preferred measure of
central location.
MODE
The mode is the value that occurs with greatest frequency.

Percentiles
A percentile provides information about how the data are spread over the interval from the
smallest value to the largest value. For data that do not contain numerous repeated values,
the pth percentile divides the data into two parts. Approximately p percent of the observa-
tions have values less than the pth percentile; approximately (100  p) percent of the ob-
servations have values greater than the pth percentile. The pth percentile is formally defined
as follows.
Colleges and universities frequently report admission test scores in terms of percentiles.
For instance, suppose an applicant obtains a raw score of 54 on the verbal portion of an ad-
mission test. How this student performed in relation to other students taking the same test
may not be readily apparent. However, if the raw score of 54 corresponds to the 70th per-
centile, we know that approximately 70% of the students scored lower than this individual
and approximately 30% of the students scored higher than this individual.
The following procedure can be used to compute the pth percentile.
PERCENTILE
The pth percentile is a value such that at least p percent of the observations are less
than or equal to this value and at least (100  p) percent of the observations are
greater than or equal to this value.
CALCULATING THE pTH PERCENTILE
Step 1. Arrange the data in ascending order (smallest value to largest value).
Step 2. Compute an index i
where p is the percentile of interest and n is the number of observations.
Step 3. (a) If i is not an integer, round up. The next integer greater than i denotes
the position of the pth percentile.
(b) If i is an integer, the pth percentile is the average of the values in po-
sitions i and i  1.
i  
p
100n
Following these steps
makes it easy to calculate
percentiles.
As an illustration of this procedure, let us determine the 85th percentile for the starting
salary data in Table 3.1.
Step 1. Arrange the data in ascending order.
Step 2.
Step 3. Because i is not an integer, round up. The position of the 85th percentile is the
next integer greater than 10.2, the 11th position.
Returning to the data, we see that the 85th percentile is the data value in the 11th position,
or 3730.

LOCATION OF THE QUARTILES
As another illustration of this procedure, let us consider the calculation of the 50th per-
centile for the starting salary data. Applying step 2, we obtain
Because i is an integer, step 3(b) states that the 50th percentile is the average of the sixth
and seventh data values; thus the 50th percentile is (3490  3520)/2  3505. Note that the
50th percentile is also the median.
Quartiles
It is often desirable to divide data into four parts, with each part containing approximately
one-fourth, or 25% of the observations. Figure 3.1 shows a data distribution divided into
four parts. The division points are referred to as the quartiles and are defined as
The starting salary data are again arranged in ascending order. We already identified Q2,
the second quartile (median), as 3505.
The computations of quartiles Q1 and Q3 require the use of the rule for finding the 25th and
75th percentiles. These calculations follow.
For Q1,
Because i is an integer, step 3(b) indicates that the first quartile, or 25th percentile, is the
average of the third and fourth data values; thus, Q1  (3450  3480)/2  3465.
For Q3,
Again, because i is an integer, step 3(b) indicates that the third quartile, or 75th percentile,
is the average of the ninth and tenth data values; thus, Q3  (3550  3650)/2  3600.

We defined the quartiles as the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles. Thus, we computed the
quartiles in the same way as percentiles. However, other conventions are sometimes used
to compute quartiles, and the actual values reported for quartiles may vary slightly de-
pending on the convention used. Nevertheless, the objective of all procedures for comput-
ing quartiles is to divide the data into four equal parts.

maining observations is 3524.50.
NOTES AND COMMENTS
It is better to use the median than the mean as a
measure of central location when a data set con-
tains extreme values. Another measure, sometimes
used when extreme values are present, is the trimmed
mean. It is obtained by deleting a percentage of the
smallest and largest values from a data set and then
computing the mean of the remaining values. For
example, the 5% trimmed mean is obtained by re-

During the 2007–2008 NCAAcollege basketball season, men’s basketball teams attempted
an all-time high number of 3-point shots, averaging 19.07 shots per game (Associated
Press Sports, January 24, 2009). In an attempt to discourage so many 3-point shots and 
encourage more inside play, the NCAA rules committee moved the 3-point line back from
19 feet, 9 inches to 20 feet, 9 inches at the beginning of the 2008–2009 basketball season.
Shown in the following table are the 3-point shots taken and the 3-point shots made for a

Measures of Variability
In addition to measures of location, it is often desirable to consider measures of vari-
ability, or dispersion. For example, suppose that you are a purchasing agent for a large
manufacturing firm and that you regularly place orders with two different suppliers.
After several months of operation, you find that the mean number of days required to fill
orders is 10 days for both of the suppliers. The histograms summarizing the number of
working days required to fill orders from the suppliers are shown in Figure 3.2. Although
the mean number of days is 10 for both suppliers, do the two suppliers demonstrate the
same degree of reliability in terms of making deliveries on schedule? Note the disper-
sion, or variability, in delivery times indicated by the histograms. Which supplier would
you prefer?
For most firms, receiving materials and supplies on schedule is important. The 7- or 8-
day deliveries shown for J.C. Clark Distributors might be viewed favorably; however, a few
of the slow 13- to 15-day deliveries could be disastrous in terms of keeping a workforce busy
The variability in the
delivery time creates
uncertainty for production
scheduling. Methods in this
section help measure and
understand variability.

and production on schedule. This example illustrates a situation in which the variability in
the delivery times may be an overriding consideration in selecting a supplier. For most pur-
chasing agents, the lower variability shown for Dawson Supply, Inc., would make Dawson
the preferred supplier.
We turn now to a discussion of some commonly used measures of variability.

HISTORICAL DATA SHOWING THE NUMBER OF DAYS REQUIRED TO FILL ORDERS
RANGE
Range  Largest value  Smallest value
Let us refer to the data on starting salaries for business school graduates in Table 3.1. The
largest starting salary is $3925 and the smallest is $3310. The range is 3925  3310  615.
Although the range is the easiest of the measures of variability to compute, it is seldom
used as the only measure. The reason is that the range is based on only two of the observa-
tions and thus is highly influenced by extreme values. Suppose one of the graduates 
received a starting salary of $10,000 per month. In this case, the range would be
10,000  3310  6690 rather than 615. This large value for the range would not be espe-
cially descriptive of the variability in the data because 11 of the 12 starting salaries are
closely grouped between 3310 and 3730.
Interquartile Range
A measure of variability that overcomes the dependency on extreme values is the inter-
quartile range (IQR). This measure of variability is the difference between the third quar-
tile, Q3, and the first quartile, Q1. In other words, the interquartile range is the range for the
middle 50% of the data.

Chapter 3
Descriptive Statistics: Numerical Measures
For the data on monthly starting salaries, the quartiles are Q3  3600 and Q1  3465. Thus,
the interquartile range is 3600  3465  135.
Variance
The variance is a measure of variability that utilizes all the data. The variance is based on the
difference between the value of each observation (xi) and the mean. The difference between
each xi and the mean ( for a sample, μ for a population) is called a deviation about the mean.
For a sample, a deviation about the mean is written (xi 
); for a population, it is written
(xi  μ). In the computation of the variance, the deviations about the mean are squared.
If the data are for a population, the average of the squared deviations is called the 
population variance. The population variance is denoted by the Greek symbol σ 2. For a
population of N observations and with μ denoting the population mean, the definition of the
population variance is as follows.

The sample variance s2 is
the estimator of the
population variance σ 2.
In most statistical applications, the data being analyzed are for a sample. When we com-
pute a sample variance, we are often interested in using it to estimate the population vari-
ance σ 2. Although a detailed explanation is beyond the scope of this text, it can be shown
that if the sum of the squared deviations about the sample mean is divided by n  1, and
not n, the resulting sample variance provides an unbiased estimate of the population vari-
ance. For this reason, the sample variance, denoted by s2, is defined as follows.
To illustrate the computation of the sample variance, we will use the data on class size
for the sample of five college classes as presented in Section 3.1. A summary of the data,
including the computation of the deviations about the mean and the squared deviations
about the mean, is shown in Table 3.2. The sum of squared deviations about the mean is
(xi 
)2  256. Hence, with n  1  4, the sample variance is
Before moving on, let us note that the units associated with the sample variance often
cause confusion. Because the values being summed in the variance calculation, (xi 
)2, are
squared, the units associated with the sample variance are also squared. For instance, the

Measures of Variability
99
sample variance for the class size data is s2  64 (students)2. The squared units associated
with variance make it difficult to obtain an intuitive understanding and interpretation of the
numerical value of the variance. We recommend that you think of the variance as a measure
useful in comparing the amount of variability for two or more variables. In a comparison of
the variables, the one with the largest variance shows the most variability. Further interpre-
tation of the value of the variance may not be necessary.
As another illustration of computing a sample variance, consider the starting salaries
listed in Table 3.1 for the 12 business school graduates. In Section 3.1, we showed that the
sample mean starting salary was $3540. The computation of the sample variance
(s2  27,440.91) is shown in Table 3.3.

Chapter 3
Descriptive Statistics: Numerical Measures
In Tables 3.2 and 3.3 we show both the sum of the deviations about the mean and the
sum of the squared deviations about the mean. For any data set, the sum of the deviations
about the mean will always equal zero. Note that in Tables 3.2 and 3.3, (xi 
)  0. The
positive deviations and negative deviations cancel each other, causing the sum of the devi-
ations about the mean to equal zero.
Standard Deviation
The standard deviation is defined to be the positive square root of the variance. Follow-
ing the notation we adopted for a sample variance and a population variance, we use s to
denote the sample standard deviation and σ to denote the population standard deviation. The
standard deviation is derived from the variance in the following way.
x¯
Recall that the sample variance for the sample of class sizes in five college classes is
s2  64. Thus, the sample standard deviation is 
For the data on starting
salaries, the sample standard deviation is 
What is gained by converting the variance to its corresponding standard deviation? Re-
call that the units associated with the variance are squared. For example, the sample vari-
ance for the starting salary data of business school graduates is s2  27,440.91 (dollars)2.
Because the standard deviation is the square root of the variance, the units of the variance,
dollars squared, are converted to dollars in the standard deviation. Thus, the standard devia-
tion of the starting salary data is $165.65. In other words, the standard deviation is mea-
sured in the same units as the original data. For this reason the standard deviation is more
easily compared to the mean and other statistics that are measured in the same units as the
original data.
Coefficient of Variation
In some situations we may be interested in a descriptive statistic that indicates how large
the standard deviation is relative to the mean. This measure is called the coefficient of
variation and is usually expressed as a percentage.
s  27,440.91  165.65.
s  64  8.
For the class size data, we found a sample mean of 44 and a sample standard deviation
of 8. The coefficient of variation is [(8/44)  100]%  18.2%. In words, the coefficient of
variation tells us that the sample standard deviation is 18.2% of the value of the sample
mean. For the starting salary data with a sample mean of 3540 and a sample standard devi-
ation of 165.65, the coefficient of variation, [(165.65/3540)  100]%  4.7%, tells us the
sample standard deviation is only 4.7% of the value of the sample mean. In general, the co-
efficient of variation is a useful statistic for comparing the variability of variables that have
different standard deviations and different means.

NOTES AND COMMENTS
1. Statistical software packages and spreadsheets
can be used to develop the descriptive statistics
presented in this chapter. After the data are 
entered into a worksheet, a few simple com-
mands can be used to generate the desired out-
put. In three chapter-ending appendixes we
show how Minitab, Excel, and StatTools can be
used to develop descriptive statistics.
2. The standard deviation is a commonly used
measure of the risk associated with investing in
stock and stock funds (BusinessWeek, January 17,
2000). It provides a measure of how monthly re-
turns fluctuate around the long-run average return.
3. Rounding the value of the sample mean x¯ and
the values of the squared deviations (xi 
)2
x¯
may introduce errors when a calculator is used
in the computation of the variance and standard
deviation. To reduce rounding errors, we rec-
ommend carrying at least six significant digits
during intermediate calculations. The result-
ing variance or standard deviation can then be
rounded to fewer digits.

the sample variance is

Measures of Distribution Shape, Relative
Location, and Detection of Outliers
We have described several measures of location and variability for data. In addition, it is
often important to have a measure of the shape of a distribution. In Chapter 2 we noted that
a histogram provides a graphical display showing the shape of a distribution. An important
numerical measure of the shape of a distribution is called skewness.
Distribution Shape
Shown in Figure 3.3 are four histograms constructed from relative frequency distribu-
tions. The histograms in Panels A and B are moderately skewed. The one in Panel A is
skewed to the left; its skewness is .85. The histogram in Panel B is skewed to the right;
its skewness is .85. The histogram in Panel C is symmetric; its skewness is zero. 
The histogram in Panel D is highly skewed to the right; its skewness is 1.62. The formula
used to compute skewness is somewhat complex.1 However, the skewness can easily be

computed using statistical software. For data skewed to the left, the skewness is negative;
for data skewed to the right, the skewness is positive. If the data are symmetric, the skew-
ness is zero.
For a symmetric distribution, the mean and the median are equal. When the data are
positively skewed, the mean will usually be greater than the median; when the data are nega-
tively skewed, the mean will usually be less than the median. The data used to construct the
histogram in Panel D are customer purchases at a women’s apparel store. The mean pur-
chase amount is $77.60 and the median purchase amount is $59.70. The relatively few large
purchase amounts tend to increase the mean, while the median remains unaffected by the
large purchase amounts. The median provides the preferred measure of location when
the data are highly skewed.
z-Scores
In addition to measures of location, variability, and shape, we are also interested in the relative
location of values within a data set. Measures of relative location help us determine how far a
particular value is from the mean.
By using both the mean and standard deviation, we can determine the relative location
of any observation. Suppose we have a sample of n observations, with the values denoted

by x1, x2, . . . , xn. In addition, assume that the sample mean, , and the sample standard
deviation, s, are already computed. Associated with each value, xi, is another value called
its z-score. Equation (3.9) shows how the z-score is computed for each xi.
x¯
The z-score is often called the standardized value. The z-score, zi, can be interpreted as
the number of standard deviations xi is from the mean . For example, z1  1.2 would indi-
cate that x1 is 1.2 standard deviations greater than the sample mean. Similarly, z 2  .5
would indicate that x 2 is .5, or 1/2, standard deviation less than the sample mean. A z-score
greater than zero occurs for observations with a value greater than the mean, and a z-score
less than zero occurs for observations with a value less than the mean. A z-score of zero in-
dicates that the value of the observation is equal to the mean.
The z-score for any observation can be interpreted as a measure of the relative location
of the observation in a data set. Thus, observations in two different data sets with the same
z-score can be said to have the same relative location in terms of being the same number of
standard deviations from the mean.
The z-scores for the class size data are computed in Table 3.4. Recall the previously
computed sample mean, 
 44, and sample standard deviation, s  8. The z-score of
1.50 for the fifth observation shows it is farthest from the mean; it is 1.50 standard devi-
ations below the mean.

that must be within a specified number of standard deviations of the mean.

CHEBYSHEV’S THEOREM
At least (1  1/z 2) of the data values must be within z standard deviations of the mean,
where z is any value greater than 1.
Some of the implications of this theorem, with z  2, 3, and 4 standard deviations, follow.
•
At least .75, or 75%, of the data values must be within z  2 standard deviations
of the mean.
•
At least .89, or 89%, of the data values must be within z  3 standard deviations
of the mean.
•
At least .94, or 94%, of the data values must be within z  4 standard deviations
of the mean.
For an example using Chebyshev’s theorem, suppose that the midterm test scores for
100 students in a college business statistics course had a mean of 70 and a standard devia-
tion of 5. How many students had test scores between 60 and 80? How many students had
test scores between 58 and 82?
For the test scores between 60 and 80, we note that 60 is two standard deviations below
the mean and 80 is two standard deviations above the mean. Using Chebyshev’s theorem,
we see that at least .75, or at least 75%, of the observations must have values within two
standard deviations of the mean. Thus, at least 75% of the students must have scored
between 60 and 80.
For the test scores between 58 and 82, we see that (58  70)/5  2.4 indicates 58 is
2.4 standard deviations below the mean and that (82  70)/5  2.4 indicates 82 is 2.4
standard deviations above the mean. Applying Chebyshev’s theorem with z  2.4, we have
At least 82.6% of the students must have test scores between 58 and 82.
Empirical Rule
One of the advantages of Chebyshev’s theorem is that it applies to any data set regardless of
the shape of the distribution of the data. Indeed, it could be used with any of the distributions
in Figure 3.3. In many practical applications, however, data sets exhibit a symmetric mound-
shaped or bell-shaped distribution like the one shown in Figure 3.4. When the data are believed
to approximate this distribution, the empirical rule can be used to determine the percentage of
data values that must be within a specified number of standard deviations of the mean.

EMPIRICAL RULE
For data having a bell-shaped distribution:
•
Approximately 68% of the data values will be within one standard deviation
of the mean.
•
Approximately 95% of the data values will be within two standard deviations
of the mean.
•
Almost all the data values will be within three standard deviations of the mean.
Chebyshev’s theorem
requires z  1; but z need
not be an integer.
The empirical rule is based
on the normal probability
distribution, which will be
discussed in Chapter 6. 
The normal distribution 
is used extensively
throughout the text.

Measures of Distribution Shape, Relative Location, and Detection of Outliers

For example, liquid detergent bottles are filled automatically on a production line. Filling
weights frequently have a bell-shaped distribution. If the mean filling weight is 16 ounces and the
standard deviation is .25 ounce, we can use the empirical rule to draw the following conclusions.
•
Approximately 68% of the filled cartons will have weights between 15.75 and 
16.25 ounces (within one standard deviation of the mean).
•
Approximately 95% of the filled cartons will have weights between 15.50 and 
16.50 ounces (within two standard deviations of the mean).
•
Almost all filled cartons will have weights between 15.25 and 16.75 ounces (within
three standard deviations of the mean).
Detection of Outliers
Sometimes a data set will have one or more observations with unusually large or unusually
small values. These extreme values are called outliers. Experienced statisticians take steps
to identify outliers and then review each one carefully. An outlier may be a data value that
has been incorrectly recorded. If so, it can be corrected before further analysis. An outlier
may also be from an observation that was incorrectly included in the data set; if so, it can
be removed. Finally, an outlier may be an unusual data value that has been recorded cor-
rectly and belongs in the data set. In such cases it should remain.
Standardized values (z-scores) can be used to identify outliers. Recall that the empiri-
cal rule allows us to conclude that for data with a bell-shaped distribution, almost all the
data values will be within three standard deviations of the mean. Hence, in using z-scores
to identify outliers, we recommend treating any data value with a z-score less than 3 or
greater than 3 as an outlier. Such data values can then be reviewed for accuracy and to
determine whether they belong in the data set.
Refer to the z-scores for the class size data in Table 3.4. The z-score of 1.50 shows
that the fifth class size is farthest from the mean. However, this standardized value is well
within the 3 to 3 guideline for outliers. Thus, the z-scores do not indicate that outliers
are present in the class size data.

NOTES AND COMMENTS
1. Chebyshev’s theorem is applicable for any data
set and can be used to state the minimum num-
ber of data values that will be within a certain
number of standard deviations of the mean. If
the data are known to be approximately bell-
shaped, more can be said. For instance, the
It is a good idea to check
for outliers before making
decisions based on data
analysis. Errors are often
made in recording data 
and entering data into the
computer. Outliers should
not necessarily be deleted,
but their accuracy and
appropriateness should 
be verified.

shaped distribution and the empirical rule for the math test scores.
empirical rule allows us to say that approxi-
mately 95% of the data values will be within two
standard deviations of the mean; Chebyshev’s
theorem allows us to conclude only that at least
75% of the data values will be in that interval.
2. Before analyzing a data set, statisticians usually
make a variety of checks to ensure the validity
of data. In a large study it is not uncommon for
errors to be made in recording data values or in
entering the values into a computer. Identifying
outliers is one tool used to check the validity of
the data.

repairs was no longer good enough (The Wall Street Journal, January 16, 2006). Data
showing the days required to restore electric service after seven hurricanes during 2004
and 2005 follow.

Exploratory Data Analysis
In Chapter 2 we introduced the stem-and-leaf display as a technique of exploratory data
analysis. Recall that exploratory data analysis enables us to use simple arithmetic and easy-
to-draw pictures to summarize data. In this section we continue exploratory data analysis
by considering five-number summaries and box plots.
Five-Number Summary
In a five-number summary, the following five numbers are used to summarize the data:
1. Smallest value
2. First quartile (Q1)
3. Median (Q2)
4. Third quartile (Q3)
5. Largest value

Exploratory Data Analysis

The easiest way to develop a five-number summary is to first place the data in ascend-
ing order. Then it is easy to identify the smallest value, the three quartiles, and the largest
value. The monthly starting salaries shown in Table 3.1 for a sample of 12 business school
graduates are repeated here in ascending order.
3310 3355 3450
3480 3480 3490
3520 3540 3550
3650 3730 3925
The median of 3505 and the quartiles Q1  3465 and Q3  3600 were computed in Sec-
tion 3.1. Reviewing the data shows a smallest value of 3310 and a largest value of 3925.
Thus the five-number summary for the salary data is 3310, 3465, 3505, 3600, 3925. Ap-
proximately one-fourth, or 25%, of the observations are between adjacent numbers in a
five-number summary.
Box Plot
A box plot is a graphical summary of data that is based on a five-number summary. A key
to the development of a box plot is the computation of the median and the quartiles, Q1 and
Q3. The interquartile range, IQR  Q3  Q1, is also used. Figure 3.5 is the box plot for the
monthly starting salary data. The steps used to construct the box plot follow.
1. Abox is drawn with the ends of the box located at the first and third quartiles. For the
salarydata,Q1  3465andQ3  3600.Thisboxcontainsthemiddle50%ofthedata.
2. A vertical line is drawn in the box at the location of the median (3505 for the 
salary data).
3. By using the interquartile range, IQR  Q3  Q1, limits are located. The limits for the
box plot are 1.5(IQR) below Q1 and 1.5(IQR) above Q3. For the salary data, IQR 
Q3  Q1  3600  3465  135. Thus, the limits are 3465  1.5(135)  3262.5 and
3600  1.5(135)  3802.5. Data outside these limits are considered outliers.
4. The dashed lines in Figure 3.5 are called whiskers. The whiskers are drawn from the
ends of the box to the smallest and largest values inside the limits computed in step 3.
Thus, the whiskers end at salary values of 3310 and 3730.
5. Finally, the location of each outlier is shown with the symbol *. In Figure 3.5 we
see one outlier, 3925.
In Figure 3.5 we included lines showing the location of the upper and lower limits.
These lines were drawn to show how the limits are computed and where they are located.

Box plots provide another
way to identify outliers. But
they do not necessarily
identify the same values 
as those with a z-score 
less than 3 or greater
than 3. Either or both
procedures may be used.

FIGURE 3.6
BOX PLOT OF MONTHLY STARTING SALARY DATA
Although the limits are always computed, generally they are not drawn on the box plots.
Figure 3.6 shows the usual appearance of a box plot for the salary data.
In order to compare monthly starting salaries for business school graduates by major, a
sample of 111 recent graduates was selected. The major and the monthly starting salary
were recorded for each graduate. Figure 3.7 shows the Minitab box plots for accounting, fi-
nance, information systems, management, and marketing majors. Note that the major is
shown on the horizontal axis and each box plot is shown vertically above the correspond-
ing major. Displaying box plots in this manner is an excellent graphical technique for mak-
ing comparisons among two or more groups.
What observations can you make about monthly starting salaries by major using the box
plots in Figured 3.7? Specifically, we note the following:
•
The higher salaries are in accounting; the lower salaries are in management and 
marketing.
•
Based on the medians, accounting and information systems have similar and higher
median salaries. Finance is next with management and marketing showing lower
median salaries.
•
High salary outliers exist for accounting, finance, and marketing majors.
•
Finance salaries appear to have the least variation, while accounting salaries appear
to have the most variation.
Perhaps you can see additional interpretations based on these box plots.

Some of the best-known food franchises and the number of retail locations for each are
shown in the following table (The New York Times Almanac, 2010).
NOTES AND COMMENTS
1. An advantage of the exploratory data analysis
procedures is that they are easy to use; few nu-
merical calculations are necessary. We simply
sort the data values into ascending order and
identify the five-number summary. The box plot
can then be constructed. It is not necessary to
compute the mean and the standard deviation
for the data.
2. In Appendix 3.1, we show how to construct a
box plot for the starting salary data using Minitab.
The box plot obtained looks just like the one in
Figure 3.6, but turned on its side.

Consumer Reports provided overall customer satisfaction scores for AT&T, Sprint, T-Mo-
bile, and Verizon cell-phone services in major metropolitan areas throughout the United
States. The rating for each service reflects the overall customer satisfaction considering a
variety of factors such as cost, connectivity problems, dropped calls, static interference,
and customer support. A satisfaction scale from 0 to 100 was used with 0 indicating com-
pletely dissatisfied and 100 indicating completely satisfied. The ratings for the four cell-
phone services in 20 metropolitan areas are as shown (Consumer Reports, January 2009).

Measures of Association Between 
Two Variables
Thus far we have examined numerical methods used to summarize the data for one variable
at a time. Often a manager or decision maker is interested in the relationship between two
variables. In this section we present covariance and correlation as descriptive measures of
the relationship between two variables.
We begin by reconsidering the application concerning a stereo and sound equipment
store in San Francisco as presented in Section 2.4. The store’s manager wants to determine
the relationship between the number of weekend television commercials shown and the
sales at the store during the following week. Sample data with sales expressed in hundreds
of dollars are provided in Table 3.6. It shows 10 observations (n  10), one for each week.
The scatter diagram in Figure 3.8 shows a positive relationship, with higher sales (y) asso-
ciated with a greater number of commercials (x). In fact, the scatter diagram suggests that
a straight line could be used as an approximation of the relationship. In the following dis-
cussion, we introduce covariance as a descriptive measure of the linear association between
two variables.
Covariance
For a sample of size n with the observations (x1, y1), (x2, y2), and so on, the sample covari-
ance is defined as follows:
Number of Commercials
Sales Volume ($100s)

To measure the strength of the linear relationship between the number of commercials
x and the sales volume y in the stereo and sound equipment store problem, we use equa-
tion (3.10) to compute the sample covariance. The calculations in Table 3.7 show the
computation of (xi 

Descriptive Statistics: Numerical Measures
In equation (3.11) we use the notation μx for the population mean of the variable x and μy
for the population mean of the variable y. The population covariance σxy is defined for a
population of size N.
Interpretation of the Covariance
To aid in the interpretation of the sample covariance, consider Figure 3.9. It is the same as
the scatter diagram of Figure 3.7 with a vertical dashed line at  3 and a horizontal dashed
line at  51. The lines divide the graph into four quadrants. Points in quadrant I corre-
spond to xi greater than 
and yi greater than , points in quadrant II correspond to xi less
than 
and yi greater than , and so on. Thus, the value of (xi 
)(yi 
) must be posi-
tive for points in quadrant I, negative for points in quadrant II, positive for points in quad-
rant III, and negative for points in quadrant IV.
If the value of sxy is positive, the points with the greatest influence on sxy must be in
quadrants I and III. Hence, a positive value for sxy indicates a positive linear association be-
tween x and y; that is, as the value of x increases, the value of y increases. If the value of sxy
is negative, however, the points with the greatest influence on sxy are in quadrants II and IV.
Hence, a negative value for sxy indicates a negative linear association between x and y; that
is, as the value of x increases, the value of y decreases. Finally, if the points are evenly dis-
tributed across all four quadrants, the value of sxy will be close to zero, indicating no linear
association between x and y. Figure 3.10 shows the values of sxy that can be expected with
three different types of scatter diagrams.

Descriptive Statistics: Numerical Measures
Referring again to Figure 3.9, we see that the scatter diagram for the stereo and sound
equipment store follows the pattern in the top panel of Figure 3.10. As we should expect,
the value of the sample covariance indicates a positive linear relationship with sxy  11.
From the preceding discussion, it might appear that a large positive value for the co-
variance indicates a strong positive linear relationship and that a large negative value indi-
cates a strong negative linear relationship. However, one problem with using covariance as
a measure of the strength of the linear relationship is that the value of the covariance de-
pends on the units of measurement for x and y. For example, suppose we are interested in
the relationship between height x and weight y for individuals. Clearly the strength of the
relationship should be the same whether we measure height in feet or inches. Measuring
the height in inches, however, gives us much larger numerical values for (xi 
) than
when we measure height in feet. Thus, with height measured in inches, we would obtain a
larger value for the numerator (xi 
)(yi 
) in equation (3.10)—and hence a larger
covariance—when in fact the relationship does not change. A measure of the relationship
between two variables that is not affected by the units of measurement for x and y is the
correlation coefficient.
Correlation Coefficient
For sample data, the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient is defined as follows.

Equation (3.12) shows that the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient for
sample data (commonly referred to more simply as the sample correlation coefficient) is
computed by dividing the sample covariance by the product of the sample standard devia-
tion of x and the sample standard deviation of y.
Let us now compute the sample correlation coefficient for the stereo and sound equip-
ment store. Using the data in Table 3.7, we can compute the sample standard deviations for
the two variables:

Chapter 3
Descriptive Statistics: Numerical Measures
The straight line drawn through each of the three points shows a perfect linear rela-
tionship between x and y. In order to apply equation (3.12) to compute the sample correla-
tion, we must first compute sxy, sx, and sy. Some of the computations are shown in Table
3.8. Using the results in this table, we find
Thus, we see that the value of the sample correlation coefficient is 1.
In general, it can be shown that if all the points in a data set fall on a positively sloped
straight line, the value of the sample correlation coefficient is 1; that is, a sample corre-
lation coefficient of 1 corresponds to a perfect positive linear relationship between x and
y. Moreover, if the points in the data set fall on a straight line having negative slope, the
value of the sample correlation coefficient is 1; that is, a sample correlation coefficient
of 1 corresponds to a perfect negative linear relationship between x and y.
Let us now suppose that a certain data set indicates a positive linear relationship be-
tween x and y but that the relationship is not perfect. The value of rxy will be less than 1,
indicating that the points in the scatter diagram are not all on a straight line. As the points
deviate more and more from a perfect positive linear relationship, the value of rxy becomes
smaller and smaller. A value of rxy equal to zero indicates no linear relationship between x
and y, and values of rxy near zero indicate a weak linear relationship.
For the data involving the stereo and sound equipment store, rxy  .93. Therefore, we
conclude that a strong positive linear relationship occurs between the number of commer-
cials and sales. More specifically, an increase in the number of commercials is associated
with an increase in sales.
In closing, we note that correlation provides a measure of linear association and not
necessarily causation. A high correlation between two variables does not mean that
changes in one variable will cause changes in the other variable. For example, we may
find that the quality rating and the typical meal price of restaurants are positively corre-
lated. However, simply increasing the meal price at a restaurant will not cause the quality
rating to increase.

Ten major college football bowl games were played in January 2010 with the University of
Alabama beating the University of Texas 37 to 21 to become the national champion of college
football.  The results of the 10 bowl games are shown in the following table (USA Today,
January 8, 2010).  The predicted winning point margin was based on Las Vegas betting odds
approximately one week before the bowl games were played.  For example, Auburn was
predicted to beat Northwestern in the Outback Bowl by 5 points.  The actual winning point
margin for Auburn was 3 points.  A negative predicted winning point margin means that the
team that won the bowl game was an underdog and expected to lose.  For example, in the
Rose Bowl, Ohio State was a 2-point underdog to Oregon and ended up winning by 9 points.

At the beginning of 2009, the economic downturn resulted in the loss of jobs and an in-
crease in delinquent loans for housing. The national unemployment rate was 6.5% and the
percentage of delinquent loans was 6.12% (The Wall Street Journal, January 27, 2009). In
projecting where the real estate market was headed in the coming year, economists stud-
ied the relationship between the jobless rate and the percentage of delinquent loans. 
The expectation was that if the jobless rate continued to increase, there would also be an
increase in the percentage of delinquent loans. The following data show the jobless rate
and the delinquent loan percentage for 27 major real estate markets.

companies. If both the DJIA and S&P 500 measure the performance of the stock market,
how are they correlated? The following data show the daily percent increase or daily

In this formula, each xi is given equal importance or weight. Although this practice is most
common, in some instances, the mean is computed by giving each observation a weight that
reflects its importance. A mean computed in this manner is referred to as a weighted mean.
Weighted Mean
The weighted mean is computed as follows:
When the data are from a sample, equation (3.15) provides the weighted sample mean.
When the data are from a population, μ replaces and equation (3.15) provides the weighted
population mean.
As an example of the need for a weighted mean, consider the following sample of five

Note that the cost per pound varies from $2.80 to $3.40, and the quantity purchased varies
from 500 to 2750 pounds. Suppose that a manager asked for information about the mean cost
per pound of the raw material. Because the quantities ordered vary, we must use the formula
for a weighted mean. The five cost-per-pound data values are x1  3.00, x2  3.40, x3  2.80,
x4  2.90, and x5  3.25. The weighted mean cost per pound is found by weighting each cost
by its corresponding quantity. For this example, the weights are w1  1200, w2  500,
w3  2750, w4  1000, and w5  800. Based on equation (3.15), the weighted mean is
calculated as follows:
Thus, the weighted mean computation shows that the mean cost per pound for the raw ma-
terial is $2.96. Note that using equation (3.14) rather than the weighted mean formula would
have provided misleading results. In this case, the mean of the five cost-per-pound values
is (3.00  3.40  2.80  2.90  3.25)/5  15.35/5  $3.07, which overstates the actual
mean cost per pound purchased.
The choice of weights for a particular weighted mean computation depends upon the ap-
plication. An example that is well known to college students is the computation of a grade
point average (GPA). In this computation, the data values generally used are 4 for an Agrade,
3 for a B grade, 2 for a C grade, 1 for a D grade, and 0 for an F grade. The weights are the
number of credits hours earned for each grade. Exercise 54 at the end of this section pro-
vides an example of this weighted mean computation. In other weighted mean computa-
tions, quantities such as pounds, dollars, or volume are frequently used as weights. In any
case, when observations vary in importance, the analyst must choose the weight that best
reflects the importance of each observation in the determination of the mean.
Grouped Data
In most cases, measures of location and variability are computed by using the individual data
values. Sometimes, however, data are available only in a grouped or frequency distribution
form. In the following discussion, we show how the weighted mean formula can be used to
obtain approximations of the mean, variance, and standard deviation for grouped data.
In Section 2.2 we provided a frequency distribution of the time in days required to
complete year-end audits for the public accounting firm of Sanderson and Clifford. The
frequency distribution of audit times is shown in Table 3.9. Based on this frequency distri-
bution, what is the sample mean audit time?
To compute the mean using only the grouped data, we treat the midpoint of each 
class as being representative of the items in the class. Let Mi denote the midpoint for 
class i and let fi denote the frequency of class i. The weighted mean formula (3.15) is then
used with the data values denoted as Mi and the weights given by the frequencies fi. In 
this case, the denominator of equation (3.15) is the sum of the frequencies, which is the

Computing a grade point
average is a good example of
the use of a weighted mean.

With the class midpoints, Mi, halfway between the class limits, the first class of 10–14 in
Table 3.9 has a midpoint at (10  14)/2  12. The five class midpoints and the weighted
mean computation for the audit time data are summarized in Table 3.10. As can be seen, the
sample mean audit time is 19 days.
To compute the variance for grouped data, we use a slightly altered version of the for-
mula for the variance provided in equation (3.5). In equation (3.5), the squared deviations
of the data about the sample mean were written (xi 
)2. However, with grouped data,
the values are not known. In this case, we treat the class midpoint, Mi, as being represen-
tative of the xi values in the corresponding class. Thus, the squared deviations about the
sample mean, (xi 
)2, are replaced by (Mi 
)2. Then, just as we did with the sample
mean calculations for grouped data, we weight each value by the frequency of the class, fi.
The sum of the squared deviations about the mean for all the data is approximated by
fi(Mi 
)2. The term n  1 rather than n appears in the denominator in order to make the
sample variance the estimate of the population variance. Thus, the following formula is
used to obtain the sample variance for grouped data.

The calculation of the sample variance for audit times based on the grouped data is shown
in Table 3.11. The sample variance is 30.
The standard deviation for grouped data is simply the square root of the variance for
grouped data. For the audit time data, the sample standard deviation is 
Before closing this section on computing measures of location and dispersion for grouped
data, we note that formulas (3.16) and (3.17) are for a sample. Population summary measures
are computed similarly. The grouped data formulas for a population mean and variance follow.

NOTES AND COMMENTS
In computing descriptive statistics for grouped data,
the class midpoints are used to approximate the data
values in each class. As a result, the descriptive sta-
tistics for grouped data approximate the descriptive
statistics that would result from using the original
data directly. We therefore recommend computing
descriptive statistics from the original data rather
than from grouped data whenever possible.

Glossary

As measures of central location, we defined the mean, median, and mode. Then the con-
cept of percentiles was used to describe other locations in the data set. Next, we presented
the range, interquartile range, variance, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation as
measures of variability or dispersion. Our primary measure of the shape of a data distribu-
tion was the skewness. Negative values indicate a data distribution skewed to the left. Posi-
tive values indicate a data distribution skewed to the right. We then described how the mean
and standard deviation could be used, applying Chebyshev’s theorem and the empirical
rule, to provide more information about the distribution of data and to identify outliers.
In Section 3.4 we showed how to develop a five-number summary and a box plot to
provide simultaneous information about the location, variability, and shape of the dis-
tribution. In Section 3.5 we introduced covariance and the correlation coefficient as
measures of association between two variables. In the final section, we showed how to
compute a weighted mean and how to calculate a mean, variance, and standard deviation
for grouped data.
The descriptive statistics we discussed can be developed using statistical software pack-
ages and spreadsheets. In the chapter-ending appendixes we show how to use Minitab, Ex-
cel, and StatTools to develop the descriptive statistics introduced in this chapter.
Glossary
Sample statistic A numerical value used as a summary measure for a sample (e.g., the
sample mean, , the sample variance, s2, and the sample standard deviation, s).
Population parameter A numerical value used as a summary measure for a population
(e.g., the population mean, μ, the population variance, σ 2, and the population standard de-
viation, σ).

Summary
In this chapter we introduced several descriptive statistics that can be used to summarize the lo-
cation, variability, and shape of a data distribution. Unlike the tabular and graphical procedures
introduced in Chapter 2, the measures introduced in this chapter summarize the data in terms of
numerical values. When the numerical values obtained are for a sample, they are called sample
statistics. When the numerical values obtained are for a population, they are called population
parameters. Some of the notation used for sample statistics and population parameters follow.

Chapter 3
Descriptive Statistics: Numerical Measures
Point estimator The sample statistic, such as , s2, and s, when used to estimate the corre-
sponding population parameter.
Mean A measure of central location computed by summing the data values and dividing by
the number of observations.
Median A measure of central location provided by the value in the middle when the data
are arranged in ascending order.
Mode A measure of location, defined as the value that occurs with greatest frequency.
Percentile A value such that at least p percent of the observations are less than or equal to
this value and at least (100  p) percent of the observations are greater than or equal to this
value. The 50th percentile is the median.
Quartiles The 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles, referred to as the first quartile, the
second quartile (median), and third quartile, respectively. The quartiles can be used to
divide a data set into four parts, with each part containing approximately 25% of the
data.
Range A measure of variability, defined to be the largest value minus the smallest 
value.
Interquartile range (IQR) A measure of variability, defined to be the difference between
the third and first quartiles.
Variance A measure of variability based on the squared deviations of the data values about
the mean.
Standard deviation A measure of variability computed by taking the positive square root
of the variance.
Coefficient of variation A measure of relative variability computed by dividing the
standard deviation by the mean and multiplying by 100.
Skewness A measure of the shape of a data distribution. Data skewed to the left result in
negative skewness; a symmetric data distribution results in zero skewness; and data skewed
to the right result in positive skewness.
z-scoreAvalue computed by dividing the deviation about the mean (xi 
) by the standard
deviation s. A z-score is referred to as a standardized value and denotes the number of stan-
dard deviations xi is from the mean.
Chebyshev’s theorem A theorem that can be used to make statements about the
proportion of data values that must be within a specified number of standard deviations
of the mean.
Empirical rule A rule that can be used to compute the percentage of data values that
must be within one, two, and three standard deviations of the mean for data that exhibit a
bell-shaped distribution.
Outlier An unusually small or unusually large data value.
Five-number summary An exploratory data analysis technique that uses five numbers
to summarize the data: smallest value, first quartile, median, third quartile, and largest
value.
Box plot A graphical summary of data based on a five-number summary.
Covariance A measure of linear association between two variables. Positive values indi-
cate a positive relationship; negative values indicate a negative relationship.
Correlation coefficient A measure of linear association between two variables that takes
on values between 1 and 1. Values near 1 indicate a strong positive linear relation-
ship; values near 1 indicate a strong negative linear relationship; and values near zero
indicate the lack of a linear relationship.
Weighted mean The mean obtained by assigning each observation a weight that reflects its
importance.
Grouped data Data available in class intervals as summarized by a frequency distribution.
Individual values of the original data are not available.

coupons were sent to customers of other National Clothing stores. Data collected for a
sample of 100 in-store credit card transactions at Pelican Stores during one day while the
promotion was running are contained in the file named PelicanStores. Table 3.12 shows a
portion of the data set. The proprietary card method of payment refers to charges made us-
ing a National Clothing charge card. Customers who made a purchase using a discount
coupon are referred to as promotional customers and customers who made a purchase but
did not use a discount coupon are referred to as regular customers. Because the promo-
tional coupons were not sent to regular Pelican Stores customers, management considers
the sales made to people presenting the promotional coupons as sales it would not other-
wise make. Of course, Pelican also hopes that the promotional customers will continue to
shop at its stores.
Most of the variables shown in Table 3.12 are self-explanatory, but two of the variables
require some clarification.

The total number of items purchased

TABLE 3.13
PERFORMANCE DATA FOR 10 MOTION PICTURES
Case Problem 2 Motion Picture Industry
The motion picture industry is a competitive business. More than 50 studios produce a total
of 300 to 400 new motion pictures each year, and the financial success of each motion pic-
ture varies considerably. The opening weekend gross sales, the total gross sales, the number
of theaters the movie was shown in, and the number of weeks the motion picture was in the
top 60 for gross sales are common variables used to measure the success of a motion picture.
Data collected for a sample of 100 motion pictures produced in 2005 are contained in the file
named Movies. Table 3.13 shows the data for the first 10 motion pictures in the file.

the other variables. Discuss.
Case Problem 3 Heavenly Chocolates Website Transactions
Heavenly Chocolates manufactures and sells quality chocolate products at its plant and retail
store located in Saratoga Springs, New York. Two years ago the company developed a web-
site and began selling its products over the Internet. Website sales have exceeded the com-
pany’s expectations, and mangement is now considering stragegies to increase sales even
further. To learn more about the website customers, a sample of 50 Heavenly Chocolate
transactions was selected from the previous month’s sales. Data showing the day of the week
each transaction was made, the type of browser the customer used, the time spent on the web-
site, the number of website pages viewed, and the amount spent by each of the 50 customers
are contained in the file named Shoppers. A portion of the data are shown in Table 3.14.
Heavenly Chocolates would like to use the sample data to determine if online shoppers
who spend more time and view more pages also spend more money during their visit to the

Descriptive Statistics: Numerical Measures
†With the n observations arranged in ascending order (smallest value to largest value), Minitab uses the positions given by
(n  1)/4 and 3(n  1)/4 to locate Q1 and Q3, respectively. When a position is fractional, Minitab interpolates between the
two adjacent ordered data values to determine the corresponding quartile.
Descriptive Statistics
Table 3.1 provided the starting salaries for 12 business school graduates.  These data are

The label SE Mean refers to the standard error of the mean. It is computed by divid-

are discussed in Chapter 7 when we introduce the topics of sampling and sampling
distributions.
Note that Minitab’s quartiles Q1  3457.5 and Q3  3625 are slightly different from
the quartiles Q1  3465 and Q3  3600 computed in Section 3.1. The different
conventions† used to identify the quartiles explain this variation. Hence, the values of Q1
and Q3 provided by one convention may not be identical to the values of Q1 and Q3 provided
by another convention. Any differences tend to be negligible, however, and the results
provided should not mislead the user in making the usual interpretations associated with
quartiles.

Covariance and Correlation
Table 3.6 provided for the number of commercials and the sales volume for a stereo and
sound equipment store. These data are available in the file Stereo, with the number of com-
mercials in column C2 and the sales volume in column C3. The following steps show how
Minitab can be used to compute the covariance for the two variables.
Step 1. Select the Stat menu
Step 2. Choose Basic Statistics
Step 3. Choose Covariance
Step 4. When the Covariance dialog box appears:
Enter C2 C3 in the Variables box
Click OK
The Minitab output provides the variance of each variable in addition to the covariance.
To obtain the correlation coefficient for the number of commercials and the sales vol-
ume, only one change is necessary in the preceding procedure. In step 3, choose the
Correlation option.

association between two variables.
Using Excel Functions
Excel provides functions for computing the mean, median, mode, sample variance, and sample
standard deviation. We illustrate the use of these Excel functions by computing the mean, median,
mode, sample variance, and sample standard deviation for the starting salary data in Table 3.1.
Refer to Figure 3.13 as we describe the steps involved. The data are entered in column B.
Excel’s AVERAGE function can be used to compute the mean by entering the follow-
ing formula into cell E1:
Similarly, the formulas MEDIAN(B2:B13), MODE(B2:B13), VAR(B2:B13), and 
STDEV(B2:B13) are entered into cells E2:E5, respectively, to compute the median, 
mode, variance, and standard deviation. The worksheet in the foreground shows that 
the values computed using the Excel functions are the same as we computed earlier in 
the chapter.
Excel also provides functions that can be used to compute the covariance and correla-
tion coefficient. You must be careful when using these functions because the covariance
function treats the data as a population and the correlation function treats the data as a sam-
ple. Thus, the result obtained using Excel’s covariance function must be adjusted to provide
the sample covariance. We show here how these functions can be used to compute the sam-
ple covariance and the sample correlation coefficient for the stereo and sound equipment
store data in Table 3.7. Refer to Figure 3.14 as we present the steps involved.

Excel’s covariance function, COVAR, can be used to compute the population covari-
ance by entering the following formula into cell F1:
Similarly, the formula CORREL(B2:B11,C2:C11) is entered into cell F2 to compute the
sample correlation coefficient. The worksheet in the foreground shows the values computed
using the Excel functions. Note that the value of the sample correlation coefficient (.93) is
the same as computed using equation (3.12). However, the result provided by the Excel
COVAR function, 9.9, was obtained by treating the data as a population. Thus, we must ad-
just the Excel result of 9.9 to obtain the sample covariance. The adjustment is rather sim-
ple. First, note that the formula for the population covariance, equation (3.11), requires
dividing by the total number of observations in the data set. But the formula for the sample
covariance, equation (3.10), requires dividing by the total number of observations minus 1.
So, to use the Excel result of 9.9 to compute the sample covariance, we simply multiply 9.9
by n/(n  1). Because n  10, we obtain
Thus, the sample covariance for the stereo and sound equipment data is 11.
Using Excel’s Descriptive Statistics Tool
As we already demonstrated, Excel provides statistical functions to compute descriptive
statistics for a data set. These functions can be used to compute one statistic at a time 
(e.g., mean, variance, etc.). Excel also provides a variety of Data Analysis Tools. One
of these tools, called Descriptive Statistics, allows the user to compute a variety of 
descriptive statistics at once. We show here how it can be used to compute descriptive sta-
tistics for the starting salary data in Table 3.1.

Managers often base their decisions on an analysis of uncertainties such as the following:
1. What are the chances that sales will decrease if we increase prices?
2. What is the likelihood a new assembly method will increase productivity?
3. How likely is it that the project will be finished on time?
4. What is the chance that a new investment will be profitable?
Oceanwide Seafood is the leading provider of quality
seafood in southwestern Ohio. The company stocks
over 90 varieties of fresh and frozen seafood products
from around the world and prepares specialty cuts
according to customer specifications. Customers in-
clude major restaurants and retail food stores in Ohio,
Kentucky, and Indiana. Established in 2005, the com-
pany has become successful by providing superior
customer service and exceptional quality seafood.
Probability and statistical information are used for
both operational and marketing decisions. For in-
stance, a time series showing monthly sales is used to
track the company’s growth and to set future target
sales levels. Statistics such as the mean customer order
size and the mean number of days a customer takes to
make payments help identify the firm’s best customers
as well as provide benchmarks for handling accounts
receivable issues. In addition, data on monthly inven-
tory levels are used in the analysis of operating profits
and trends in product sales.
Probability analysis has helped Oceanwide deter-
mine reasonable and profitable prices for its products.
For example, when Oceanwide receives a whole fresh
fish from one of its suppliers, the fish must be
processed and cut to fill individual customer orders. A
fresh 100-pound whole tuna packed in ice might cost
Oceanwide $500. At first glance, the company’s cost
for tuna appears to be $500/100  $5 per pound. How-
ever, due to the loss in the processing and cutting op-
eration, a 100-pound whole tuna will not provide 100
pounds of finished product. If the processing and cut-
ting operation yields 75% of the whole tuna, the num-
ber of pounds of finished product available for sale to
customers would be .75(100)  75 pounds, not 100
pounds. In this case, the company’s actual cost of tuna
would be $500/75  $6.67 per pound. Thus, Ocean-
wide would need to use a cost of $6.67 per pound to
determine a profitable price to charge its customers.
To help determine the yield percentage that is
likely for processing and cutting whole tuna, data were
collected on the yields from a sample of whole tunas.
Let Y denote the yield percentage for whole tuna. Using
the data, Oceanwide was able to determine that 5% of
the time the yield for whole tuna was at least 90%. In
conditional probability notation, this probability is
written P(Y  90% | Tuna)  .05; in other words, the
probability that the yield will be at least 90% given that
the fish is a tuna is .05. If Oceanwide established the
selling price for tuna based on a 90% yield, 95% of the
time the company would realize a yield less than
expected. As a result, the company would be under-
stating its cost per pound and also understating the
price of tuna for its customers. Additional conditional
probability information for other yield percentages
helped management select a 70% yield as the basis for
determining the cost of tuna and the price to charge its
customers. Similar conditional probabilities for other
seafood products helped management establish pricing
yield percentages for each type of seafood product. In
this chapter, you will learn how to compute and inter-
pret conditional probabilities and other probabilities
that are helpful in the decision-making process.
Oceanwide Seafood uses probability analysis to help
determine reasonable and profitable prices for its
products.

Chapter 4
Introduction to Probability
Some of the earliest work
on probability originated in
a series of letters between
Pierre de Fermat and
Blaise Pascal in the 1650s.
SAMPLE SPACE
The sample space for an experiment is the set of all experimental outcomes.
Experimental outcomes are
also called sample points.
Probability is a numerical measure of the likelihood that an event will occur. Thus,
probabilities can be used as measures of the degree of uncertainty associated with the four
events previously listed. If probabilities are available, we can determine the likelihood of
each event occurring.
Probability values are always assigned on a scale from 0 to 1. A probability near zero
indicates an event is unlikely to occur; a probability near 1 indicates an event is almost
certain to occur. Other probabilities between 0 and 1 represent degrees of likelihood that an
event will occur. For example, if we consider the event “rain tomorrow,” we understand that
when the weather report indicates “a near-zero probability of rain,” it means almost no chance
of rain. However, if a .90 probability of rain is reported, we know that rain is likely to occur.
A.50 probability indicates that rain is just as likely to occur as not. Figure 4.1 depicts the view
of probability as a numerical measure of the likelihood of an event occurring.
4.1
Experiments, Counting Rules, 
and Assigning Probabilities
In discussing probability, we define an experiment as a process that generates well-defined
outcomes. On any single repetition of an experiment, one and only one of the possible
experimental outcomes will occur. Several examples of experiments and their associated
outcomes follow.
By specifying all possible experimental outcomes, we identify the sample space for an
experiment.
An experimental outcome is also called a sample point to identify it as an element of the
sample space.

Experiments, Counting Rules, and Assigning Probabilities 
151
COUNTING RULE FOR MULTIPLE-STEP EXPERIMENTS
If an experiment can be described as a sequence of k steps with n1 possible outcomes
on the first step, n2 possible outcomes on the second step, and so on, then the total
number of experimental outcomes is given by (n1) (n2) . . . (nk).
Consider the first experiment in the preceding table—tossing a coin. The upward face
of the coin—a head or a tail—determines the experimental outcomes (sample points). If we
let S denotethesamplespace,wecanusethefollowingnotationtodescribethesamplespace.
The sample space for the second experiment in the table—selecting a part for inspection—
can be described as follows:
Both of the experiments just described have two experimental outcomes (sample points).
However, suppose we consider the fourth experiment listed in the table—rolling a die. The
possible experimental outcomes, defined as the number of dots appearing on the upward
face of the die, are the six points in the sample space for this experiment.
Counting Rules, Combinations, and Permutations
Being able to identify and count the experimental outcomes is a necessary step in assigning
probabilities. We now discuss three useful counting rules.
Multiple-step experiments The first counting rule applies to multiple-step experi-
ments. Consider the experiment of tossing two coins. Let the experimental outcomes be
defined in terms of the pattern of heads and tails appearing on the upward faces of the two
coins. How many experimental outcomes are possible for this experiment? The experiment
of tossing two coins can be thought of as a two-step experiment in which step 1 is the toss-
ing of the first coin and step 2 is the tossing of the second coin. If we use H to denote a head
and T to denote a tail, (H, H) indicates the experimental outcome with a head on the first
coin and a head on the second coin. Continuing this notation, we can describe the sample
space (S) for this coin-tossing experiment as follows:
Thus, we see that four experimental outcomes are possible. In this case, we can easily list
all the experimental outcomes.
The counting rule for multiple-step experiments makes it possible to determine the
number of experimental outcomes without listing them.
S = {(H, H
 ), (H, T
 ), (T, H
 ), (T, T
 )}
S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
S = {Defective, Nondefective}
S = {Head, Tail}
Viewing the experiment of tossing two coins as a sequence of first tossing one coin
(n1  2) and then tossing the other coin (n2  2), we can see from the counting rule that
(2)(2)  4 distinct experimental outcomes are possible. As shown, they are S  {(H, H),
(H, T), (T, H), (T, T)}. The number of experimental outcomes in an experiment involving
tossing six coins is (2)(2)(2)(2)(2)(2)  64.

Chapter 4
Introduction to Probability
A tree diagram is a graphical representation that helps in visualizing a multiple-step
experiment. Figure 4.2 shows a tree diagram for the experiment of tossing two coins. The
sequence of steps moves from left to right through the tree. Step 1 corresponds to tossing
the first coin, and step 2 corresponds to tossing the second coin. For each step, the two pos-
sible outcomes are head or tail. Note that for each possible outcome at step 1 two branches
correspond to the two possible outcomes at step 2. Each of the points on the right end of
the tree corresponds to an experimental outcome. Each path through the tree from the
leftmost node to one of the nodes at the right side of the tree corresponds to a unique
sequence of outcomes.
Let us now see how the counting rule for multiple-step experiments can be used in the
analysis of a capacity expansion project for the Kentucky Power & Light Company
(KP&L). KP&L is starting a project designed to increase the generating capacity of one of
its plants in northern Kentucky. The project is divided into two sequential stages or steps:
stage 1 (design) and stage 2 (construction). Even though each stage will be scheduled and
controlled as closely as possible, management cannot predict beforehand the exact time re-
quired to complete each stage of the project. An analysis of similar construction projects re-
vealed possible completion times for the design stage of 2, 3, or 4 months and possible
completion times for the construction stage of 6, 7, or 8 months. In addition, because of the
critical need for additional electrical power, management set a goal of 10 months for the
completion of the entire project.
Because this project has three possible completion times for the design stage (step 1)
and three possible completion times for the construction stage (step 2), the counting rule
for multiple-step experiments can be applied here to determine a total of (3)(3)  9 experi-
mental outcomes. To describe the experimental outcomes, we use a two-number notation;
for instance, (2, 6) indicates that the design stage is completed in 2 months and the con-
struction stage is completed in 6 months. This experimental outcome results in a total of
2  6  8 months to complete the entire project. Table 4.1 summarizes the nine experi-
mental outcomes for the KP&L problem. The tree diagram in Figure 4.3 shows how the nine
outcomes (sample points) occur.
The counting rule and tree diagram help the project manager identify the experimental
outcomes and determine the possible project completion times. From the information in
Without the tree diagram,
one might think only three
experimental outcomes are
possible for two tosses of a
coin: 0 heads, 1 head, and
2 heads.

Chapter 4
Introduction to Probability
Figure 4.3, we see that the project will be completed in 8 to 12 months, with six of the nine
experimental outcomes providing the desired completion time of 10 months or less. Even
though identifying the experimental outcomes may be helpful, we need to consider how
probability values can be assigned to the experimental outcomes before making an assess-
ment of the probability that the project will be completed within the desired 10 months.
Combinations A second useful counting rule allows one to count the number of experi-
mental outcomes when the experiment involves selecting n objects from a (usually larger)
set of N objects. It is called the counting rule for combinations.
In sampling from a finite
population of size N, the
counting rule for
combinations is used to find
the number of different
samples of size n that can
be selected.
COUNTING RULE FOR COMBINATIONS
The number of combinations of N objects taken n at a time is
(4.1)
and, by definition,
0!  1
N! 
n! 

  
N!
n!(N  n)!
The notation ! means factorial; for example, 5 factorial is 5!  (5)(4)(3)(2)(1)  120.
As an illustration of the counting rule for combinations, consider a quality control pro-
cedure in which an inspector randomly selects two of five parts to test for defects. In a group
of five parts, how many combinations of two parts can be selected? The counting rule in
equation (4.1) shows that with N  5 and n  2, we have
Thus, 10 outcomes are possible for the experiment of randomly selecting two parts from a
group of five. If we label the five parts as A, B, C, D, and E, the 10 combinations or experi-
mental outcomes can be identified as AB, AC, AD, AE, BC, BD, BE, CD, CE, and DE.
As another example, consider that the Florida lottery system uses the random selection
of six integers from a group of 53 to determine the weekly winner. The counting rule for
combinations, equation (4.1), can be used to determine the number of ways six different
integers can be selected from a group of 53.
The counting rule for combinations tells us that almost 23 million experimental outcomes
are possible in the lottery drawing. An individual who buys a lottery ticket has 1 chance in
22,957,480 of winning.
Permutations A third counting rule that is sometimes useful is the counting rule for
permutations. It allows one to compute the number of experimental outcomes when 
n objects are to be selected from a set of N objects where the order of selection is 


The counting rule for

the chance of winning the
lottery is very unlikely.

important. The same n objects selected in a different order are considered a different experi-
mental outcome.
The counting rule for permutations closely relates to the one for combinations; how-
ever, an experiment results in more permutations than combinations for the same number
of objects because every selection of n objects can be ordered in n! different ways.
As an example, consider again the quality control process in which an inspector selects
two of five parts to inspect for defects. How many permutations may be selected? The
counting rule in equation (4.2) shows that with N  5 and n  2, we have
Thus, 20 outcomes are possible for the experiment of randomly selecting two parts from a
group of five when the order of selection must be taken into account. If we label the parts
A, B, C, D, and E, the 20 permutations are AB, BA, AC, CA, AD, DA, AE, EA, BC, CB,
BD, DB, BE, EB, CD, DC, CE, EC, DE, and ED.

BASIC REQUIREMENTS FOR ASSIGNING PROBABILITIES
1. The probability assigned to each experimental outcome must be between 0
and 1, inclusively. If we let Ei denote the ith experimental outcome and P(Ei)
its probability, then this requirement can be written as
(4.3)
2. The sum of the probabilities for all the experimental outcomes must equal 1.0.
For n experimental outcomes, this requirement can be written as
(4.4)
P(E1)  P(E2 )  . . .  P(En)  1
0  P(Ei)  1 for all i
The classical method of assigning probabilities is appropriate when all the experi-
mental outcomes are equally likely. If n experimental outcomes are possible, a probability
of 1/n is assigned to each experimental outcome. When using this approach, the two basic
requirements for assigning probabilities are automatically satisfied.

Chapter 4
Introduction to Probability
For an example, consider the experiment of tossing a fair coin; the two experimental
outcomes—head and tail—are equally likely. Because one of the two equally likely out-
comes is a head, the probability of observing a head is 1/2, or .50. Similarly, the proba-
bility of observing a tail is also 1/2, or .50.
As another example, consider the experiment of rolling a die. It would seem reasonable to
conclude that the six possible outcomes are equally likely, and hence each outcome is assigned
a probability of 1/6. If P(1) denotes the probability that one dot appears on the upward face of
the die, then P(1)  1/6. Similarly, P(2)  1/6, P(3)  1/6, P(4)  1/6, P(5)  1/6, and
P(6)  1/6. Note that these probabilities satisfy the two basic requirements of equations (4.3)
and (4.4) because each of the probabilities is greater than or equal to zero and they sum to 1.0.
The relative frequency method of assigning probabilities is appropriate when data are
available to estimate the proportion of the time the experimental outcome will occur if the
experiment is repeated a large number of times. As an example, consider a study of waiting
times in the X-ray department for a local hospital. A clerk recorded the number of patients
waiting for service at 9:00 a.m. on 20 successive days and obtained the following results.
These data show that on 2 of the 20 days, zero patients were waiting for service; on 5
of the days, one patient was waiting for service; and so on. Using the relative frequency
method, we would assign a probability of 2/20  .10 to the experimental outcome of zero
patients waiting for service, 5/20  .25 to the experimental outcome of one patient waiting,
6/20  .30 to two patients waiting, 4/20  .20 to three patients waiting, and 3/20  .15 to
four patients waiting. As with the classical method, using the relative frequency method
automatically satisfies the two basic requirements of equations (4.3) and (4.4).
The subjective method of assigning probabilities is most appropriate when one cannot
realistically assume that the experimental outcomes are equally likely and when little rele-
vant data are available. When the subjective method is used to assign probabilities to the
experimental outcomes, we may use any information available, such as our experience or
intuition. After considering all available information, a probability value that expresses our
degree of belief (on a scale from 0 to 1) that the experimental outcome will occur is speci-
fied. Because subjective probability expresses a person’s degree of belief, it is personal.
Using the subjective method, different people can be expected to assign different proba-
bilities to the same experimental outcome.
The subjective method requires extra care to ensure that the two basic requirements of
equations (4.3) and (4.4) are satisfied. Regardless of a person’s degree of belief, the proba-
bility value assigned to each experimental outcome must be between 0 and 1, inclusive, and
the sum of all the probabilities for the experimental outcomes must equal 1.0.
Consider the case in which Tom and Judy Elsbernd make an offer to purchase a house.
Two outcomes are possible:
E1  their offer is accepted

Judy believes that the probability that their offer will be accepted is .8; thus, Judy would set
P(E1)  .8 and P(E2)  .2. Tom, however, believes that the probability that their offer will
be accepted is .6; hence, Tom would set P(E1)  .6 and P(E2)  .4. Note that Tom’s prob-
ability estimate for E1 reflects a greater pessimism that their offer will be accepted.
Both Judy and Tom assigned probabilities that satisfy the two basic requirements. The
fact that their probability estimates are different emphasizes the personal nature of the
subjective method.
Even in business situations where either the classical or the relative frequency approach
can be applied, managers may want to provide subjective probability estimates. In such
cases, the best probability estimates often are obtained by combining the estimates from the
classical or relative frequency approach with subjective probability estimates.
Probabilities for the KP&L Project
To perform further analysis on the KP&L project, we must develop probabilities for each of
the nine experimental outcomes listed in Table 4.1. On the basis of experience and judg-
ment, management concluded that the experimental outcomes were not equally likely.
Hence, the classical method of assigning probabilities could not be used. Management then
decided to conduct a study of the completion times for similar projects undertaken by KP&L
over the past three years. The results of a study of 40 similar projects are summarized in
Table 4.2.
After reviewing the results of the study, management decided to employ the relative fre-
quency method of assigning probabilities. Management could have provided subjective
probability estimates but felt that the current project was quite similar to the 40 previous
projects. Thus, the relative frequency method was judged best.
In using the data in Table 4.2 to compute probabilities, we note that outcome (2, 6)—
stage 1 completed in 2 months and stage 2 completed in 6 months—occurred six times in
the 40 projects. We can use the relative frequency method to assign a probability of
6/40  .15 to this outcome. Similarly, outcome (2, 7) also occurred in six of the 40 projects,
providing a 6/40  .15 probability. Continuing in this manner, we obtain the probability as-
signments for the sample points of the KP&L project shown in Table 4.3. Note that P(2, 6)
represents the probability of the sample point (2, 6), P(2, 7) represents the probability of
the sample point (2, 7), and so on.
Bayes’theorem (see 
Section 4.5) provides a
means for combining
subjectively determined
prior probabilities with
probabilities obtained by
other means to obtain
revised, or posterior,
probabilities.

NOTES AND COMMENTS
In statistics, the notion of an experiment differs
somewhat from the notion of an experiment in the
physical sciences. In the physical sciences, re-
searchers usually conduct an experiment in 
a laboratory or a controlled environment in order to
learn about cause and effect. In statistical experi-
ments, probability determines outcomes. Even
though the experiment is repeated in exactly the
same way, an entirely different outcome may occur.
Because of this influence of probability on the out-
come, the experiments of statistics are sometimes
called random experiments.

The Powerball lottery is played twice each week in 28 states, the Virgin Islands, and the
District of Columbia. To play Powerball a participant must purchase a ticket and then select
five numbers from the digits 1 through 55 and a Powerball number from the digits 1 through
42. To determine the winning numbers for each game, lottery officials draw 5 white balls
out of a drum with 55 white balls, and 1 red ball out of a drum with 42 red balls. To win the
jackpot, a participant’s numbers must match the numbers on the 5 white balls in any order
and the number on the red Powerball. Eight coworkers at the ConAgra Foods plant in
Lincoln, Nebraska, claimed the record $365 million jackpot on February 18, 2006, by
matching the numbers 15–17–43–44–49 and the Powerball number 29. A variety of other

Events and Their Probabilities
In the introduction to this chapter we used the term event much as it would be used in every-
day language. Then, in Section 4.1 we introduced the concept of an experiment and its
associated experimental outcomes or sample points. Sample points and events provide the
foundation for the study of probability. As a result, we must now introduce the formal defi-
nition of an event as it relates to sample points. Doing so will provide the basis for deter-
mining the probability of an event.

Events and Their Probabilities
161
For an example, let us return to the KP&L project and assume that the project manager
is interested in the event that the entire project can be completed in 10 months or less.
Referring to Table 4.3, we see that six sample points—(2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 6), (3, 7), and
(4, 6)—provide a project completion time of 10 months or less. Let C denote the event that
the project is completed in 10 months or less; we write
C  {(2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 6)}
Event C is said to occur if any one of these six sample points appears as the experimental
outcome.
Other events that might be of interest to KP&L management include the following.
Using the information in Table 4.3, we see that these events consist of the following sample
points.
L  {(2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 6)}
M  {(3, 8), (4, 7), (4, 8)}
A variety of additional events can be defined for the KP&L project, but in each case the
event must be identified as a collection of sample points for the experiment.
Given the probabilities of the sample points shown in Table 4.3, we can use the follow-
ing definition to compute the probability of any event that KP&L management might want
to consider.
L 
M 
The event that the project is completed in less than 10 months
The event that the project is completed in more than 10 months
Using this definition, we calculate the probability of a particular event by adding the
probabilities of the sample points (experimental outcomes) that make up the event. We can
now compute the probability that the project will take 10 months or less to complete. Be-
cause this event is given by C  {(2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 6)}, the probability
of event C, denoted P(C), is given by
Refer to the sample point probabilities in Table 4.3; we have
Similarly, because the event that the project is completed in less than 10 months is given
by L  {(2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 6)}, the probability of this event is given by
Finally, for the event that the project is completed in more than 10 months, we have
M  {(3, 8), (4, 7), (4, 8)} and thus

The probability of any event is equal to the sum of the probabilities of the sample
points in the event.

Chapter 4
Introduction to Probability
Using these probability results, we can now tell KP&L management that there is a .70
probability that the project will be completed in 10 months or less, a .40 probability that the
project will be completed in less than 10 months, and a .30 probability that the project will
be completed in more than 10 months. This procedure of computing event probabilities can
be repeated for any event of interest to the KP&L management.
Any time that we can identify all the sample points of an experiment and assign proba-
bilities to each, we can compute the probability of an event using the definition. However,
in many experiments the large number of sample points makes the identification of the
sample points, as well as the determination of their associated probabilities, extremely
cumbersome, if not impossible. In the remaining sections of this chapter, we present some
basic probability relationships that can be used to compute the probability of an event with-
out knowledge of all the sample point probabilities.

NOTES AND COMMENTS
1. The sample space, S, is an event. Because it con-
tains all the experimental outcomes, it has a
probability of 1; that is, P(S)  1.
2. When the classical method is used to assign
probabilities, the assumption is that the ex-
perimental outcomes are equally likely. In 
such cases, the probability of an event can be
computed by counting the number of experi-
mental outcomes in the event and dividing the
result by the total number of experimental
outcomes.

Some Basic Relationships of Probability
Complement of an Event
Given an event A, the complement of A is defined to be the event consisting of all sample
points that are not in A. The complement of A is denoted by Ac. Figure 4.4 is a diagram,
known as a Venn diagram, which illustrates the concept of a complement. The rectangu-
lar area represents the sample space for the experiment and as such contains all possible
sample points. The circle represents event A and contains only the sample points that be-
long to A. The shaded region of the rectangle contains all sample points not in event A and
is by definition the complement of A.
In any probability application, either event A or its complement Ac must occur. There-
fore, we have

The Venn diagram in Figure 4.5 depicts the union of events A and B. Note that the two
circles contain all the sample points in event A as well as all the sample points in event B.

The union of A and B is the event containing all sample points belonging to A or B
or both. The union is denoted by A  B.

FIGURE 4.4
COMPLEMENT OF EVENT A IS SHADED
Solving for P(A), we obtain the following result.
Equation (4.5) shows that the probability of an event A can be computed easily if the proba-
bility of its complement, P(Ac), is known.
As an example, consider the case of a sales manager who, after reviewing sales reports,
states that 80% of new customer contacts result in no sale. By allowing A to denote the event
of a sale and Ac to denote the event of no sale, the manager is stating that P(Ac)  .80. Using
equation (4.5), we see that
We can conclude that a new customer contact has a .20 probability of resulting in a sale.
In another example, a purchasing agent states a .90 probability that a supplier will send
a shipment that is free of defective parts. Using the complement, we can conclude that there
is a 1  .90  .10 probability that the shipment will contain defective parts.
Addition Law
The addition law is helpful when we are interested in knowing the probability that at least
one of two events occurs. That is, with events A and B we are interested in knowing the
probability that event A or event B or both occur.
Before we present the addition law, we need to discuss two concepts related to the com-
bination of events: the union of events and the intersection of events. Given two events 
A and B, the union of A and B is defined as follows.
P(A)  1  P(Ac

INTERSECTION OF TWO EVENTS
Given two events A and B, the intersection of A and B is the event containing the
sample points belonging to both A and B. The intersection is denoted by A  B.
The Venn diagram depicting the intersection of events A and B is shown in Figure 4.6. The
area where the two circles overlap is the intersection; it contains the sample points that are
in both A and B.
Let us now continue with a discussion of the addition law. The addition law provides
a way to compute the probability that event A or event B or both occur. In other words, the
addition law is used to compute the probability of the union of two events. The addition law
is written as follows.

To understand the addition law intuitively, note that the first two terms in the addition
law, P(A)  P(B), account for all the sample points in A  B. However, because the sam-
ple points in the intersection A  B are in both A and B, when we compute P(A)  P(B),
we are in effect counting each of the sample points in A  B twice. We correct for this over-
counting by subtracting P(A  B).
As an example of an application of the addition law, let us consider the case of a small
assembly plant with 50 employees. Each worker is expected to complete work assignments
on time and in such a way that the assembled product will pass a final inspection. On oc-
casion, some of the workers fail to meet the performance standards by completing work late
or assembling a defective product. At the end of a performance evaluation period, the pro-
duction manager found that 5 of the 50 workers completed work late, 6 of the 50 workers
assembled a defective product, and 2 of the 50 workers both completed work late and as-
sembled a defective product.
Let
The relative frequency information leads to the following probabilities.
After reviewing the performance data, the production manager decided to assign a poor
performance rating to any employee whose work was either late or defective; thus the event
of interest is L  D. What is the probability that the production manager assigned an em-
ployee a poor performance rating?
Note that the probability question is about the union of two events. Specifically, we
want to know P(L  D). Using equation (4.6), we have
Knowing values for the three probabilities on the right side of this expression, we can write
This calculation tells us that there is a .18 probability that a randomly selected employee
received a poor performance rating.
As another example of the addition law, consider a recent study conducted by the
personnel manager of a major computer software company. The study showed that 30% of
the employees who left the firm within two years did so primarily because they were dis-
satisfied with their salary, 20% left because they were dissatisfied with their work assign-
ments, and 12% of the former employees indicated dissatisfaction with both their salary
and their work assignments. What is the probability that an employee who leaves within

Let
We have P(S)  .30, P(W)  .20, and P(S  W)  .12. Using equation (4.6), the addition
law, we have
We find a .38 probability that an employee leaves for salary or work assignment reasons.
Before we conclude our discussion of the addition law, let us consider a special case
that arises for mutually exclusive events.

Events A and B are mutually exclusive if, when one event occurs, the other cannot oc-
cur. Thus, a requirement for A and B to be mutually exclusive is that their intersection must
contain no sample points. The Venn diagram depicting two mutually exclusive events A and
B is shown in Figure 4.7. In this case P(A  B)  0 and the addition law can be written as

High school seniors with strong academic records apply to the nation’s most selective
colleges in greater numbers each year. Because the number of slots remains relatively sta-

an Ivy League college received 2851 applications for early admission. Of this group, it ad-
mitted 1033 students early, rejected 854 outright, and deferred 964 to the regular admis-
sion pool for further consideration. In the past, this school has admitted 18% of the deferred
early admission applicants during the regular admission process. Counting the students ad-
mitted early and the students admitted during the regular admission process, the total class
size was 2375. Let E, R, and D represent the events that a student who applies for early
admission is admitted early, rejected outright, or deferred to the regular admissions pool.

Conditional Probability
Often, the probability of an event is influenced by whether a related event already occurred.
Suppose we have an event A with probability P(A). If we obtain new information and learn
that a related event, denoted by B, already occurred, we will want to take advantage of this
information by calculating a new probability for event A. This new probability of event A
is called a conditional probability and is written P(A  B). We use the notation  to indicate
that we are considering the probability of event A given the condition that event B has
occurred. Hence, the notation P(A  B) reads “the probability of A given B.”
As an illustration of the application of conditional probability, consider the situation of
the promotion status of male and female officers of a major metropolitan police force in the
eastern United States. The police force consists of 1200 officers, 960 men and 240 women.
Over the past two years, 324 officers on the police force received promotions. The specific
breakdown of promotions for male and female officers is shown in Table 4.4.
After reviewing the promotion record, a committee of female officers raised a discrimi-
nation case on the basis that 288 male officers had received promotions but only 36 female
officers had received promotions. The police administration argued that the relatively low
number of promotions for female officers was due not to discrimination, but to the fact that
relatively few females are members of the police force. Let us show how conditional proba-
bility could be used to analyze the discrimination charge.
Let
Dividing the data values in Table 4.4 by the total of 1200 officers enables us to summarize
the available information with the following probability values.

Chapter 4
Introduction to Probability
Because each of these values gives the probability of the intersection of two events, the
probabilities are called joint probabilities. Table 4.5, which provides a summary of the
probability information for the police officer promotion situation, is referred to as a joint
probability table.
The values in the margins of the joint probability table provide the probabilities of each
event separately. That is, P(M)  .80, P(W)  .20, P(A)  .27, and P(Ac)  .73. These
probabilities are referred to as marginal probabilities because of their location in the mar-
gins of the joint probability table. We note that the marginal probabilities are found by sum-
ming the joint probabilities in the corresponding row or column of the joint probability
table. For instance, the marginal probability of being promoted is P(A)  P(M  A) 
P(W  A)  .24  .03  .27. From the marginal probabilities, we see that 80% of the
force is male, 20% of the force is female, 27% of all officers received promotions, and 73%
were not promoted.
Let us begin the conditional probability analysis by computing the probability that 
an officer is promoted given that the officer is a man. In conditional probability nota-
tion, we are attempting to determine P(A  M). To calculate P(A  M), we first realize 
that this notation simply means that we are considering the probability of the event A (pro-
motion) given that the condition designated as event M (the officer is a man) is known to
exist. Thus P(A  M) tells us that we are now concerned only with the promotion status of
the 960 male officers. Because 288 of the 960 male officers received promotions, the
probability of being promoted given that the officer is a man is 288/960  .30. In other
words, given that an officer is a man, that officer had a 30% chance of receiving a promo-
tion over the past two years.
This procedure was easy to apply because the values in Table 4.4 show the number of
officers in each category. We now want to demonstrate how conditional probabilities such
as P(A  M) can be computed directly from related event probabilities rather than the fre-
quency data of Table 4.4.
We have shown that P(A  M)  288/960  .30. Let us now divide both the numerator
and denominator of this fraction by 1200, the total number of officers in the study.
We now see that the conditional probability P(A  M) can be computed as .24/.80. Refer
to the joint probability table (Table 4.5). Note in particular that .24 is the joint probability of

A and M; that is, P(A  M)  .24. Also note that .80 is the marginal probability that a ran-
domly selected officer is a man; that is, P(M)  .80. Thus, the conditional probability
P(A  M) can be computed as the ratio of the joint probability P(A  M) to the marginal
probability P(M).
The fact that conditional probabilities can be computed as the ratio of a joint probabil-
ity to a marginal probability provides the following general formula for conditional proba-
bility calculations for two events A and B.

The Venn diagram in Figure 4.8 is helpful in obtaining an intuitive understanding of
conditional probability. The circle on the right shows that event B has occurred; the portion
of the circle that overlaps with event A denotes the event (A  B). We know that once event
B has occurred, the only way that we can also observe event A is for the event (A  B) to
occur. Thus, the ratio P(A  B)/P(B) provides the conditional probability that we will
observe event A given that event B has already occurred.
Let us return to the issue of discrimination against the female officers. The marginal prob-
abilityinrow1of Table4.5showsthattheprobabilityofpromotionofanofficerisP(A)  .27
(regardless of whether that officer is male or female). However, the critical issue in the dis-
crimination case involves the two conditional probabilities P(A  M) and P(A  W). That is,
what is the probability of a promotion given that the officer is a man, and what is the proba-
bility of a promotion given that the officer is a woman? If these two probabilities are equal, a
discrimination argument has no basis because the chances of a promotion are the same for
male and female officers. However, a difference in the two conditional probabilities will sup-
port the position that male and female officers are treated differently in promotion decisions.

Introduction to Probability
We already determined that P(A  M)  .30. Let us now use the probability values in
Table 4.5 and the basic relationship of conditional probability in equation (4.7) to compute
the probability that an officer is promoted given that the officer is a woman; that is,
P(A  W). Using equation (4.7), with W replacing B, we obtain
What conclusion do you draw? The probability of a promotion given that the officer is a
man is .30, twice the .15 probability of a promotion given that the officer is a woman. Although
the use of conditional probability does not in itself prove that discrimination exists in this case,
the conditional probability values support the argument presented by the female officers.
Independent Events
In the preceding illustration, P(A)  .27, P(A  M)  .30, and P(A  W)  .15. We see that
the probability of a promotion (event A) is affected or influenced by whether the officer is
a man or a woman. Particularly, because P(A  M)  P(A), we would say that events A and
M are dependent events. That is, the probability of event A (promotion) is altered or affected
by knowing that event M (the officer is a man) exists. Similarly, with P(A  W)  P(A), 
we would say that events A and W are dependent events. However, if the probability of 
event A is not changed by the existence of event M—that is, P(A  M)  P(A)—we would
say that events A and M are independent events. This situation leads to the following
definition of the independence of two events.

Multiplication Law
Whereas the addition law of probability is used to compute the probability of a union of two
events, the multiplication law is used to compute the probability of the intersection of two
events. The multiplication law is based on the definition of conditional probability. Using
equations (4.7) and (4.8) and solving for P(A  B), we obtain the multiplication law.

where it is known that 84% of the households in a particular neighborhood subscribe to the daily
edition of the paper. If we let D denote the event that a household subscribes to the daily edition,

NOTES AND COMMENTS
Do not confuse the notion of mutually exclusive
events with that of independent events. Two events
with nonzero probabilities cannot be both mutually
exclusiveandindependent.Ifonemutuallyexclusive
event is known to occur, the other cannot occur;
thus, the probability of the other event occurring is
reduced to zero. They are therefore dependent.
daily subscription also subscribes to the Sunday edition (event S) is .75; that is, P(S  D)  .75.
What is the probability that a household subscribes to both the Sunday and daily editions of the
newspaper? Using the multiplication law, we compute the desired P(S  D) as
We now know that 63% of the households subscribe to both the Sunday and daily editions.
Before concluding this section, let us consider the special case of the multiplication law
when the events involved are independent. Recall that events A and B are independent
whenever P(A  B)  P(A) or P(B  A)  P(B). Hence, using equations (4.11) and (4.12) for
the special case of independent events, we obtain the following multiplication law.
P(S  D)  P(D)P(S  D)  .84(.75)  .63
To compute the probability of the intersection of two independent events, we simply mul-
tiply the corresponding probabilities. Note that the multiplication law for independent events
provides another way to determine whether A and B are independent. That is, if P(A  B) 
P(A)P(B), then A and B are independent; if P(A  B)  P(A)P(B), then A and B are dependent.
As an application of the multiplication law for independent events, consider the situa-
tion of a service station manager who knows from past experience that 80% of the cus-
tomers use a credit card when they purchase gasoline. What is the probability that the next
two customers purchasing gasoline will each use a credit card? If we let
then the event of interest is A  B. Given no other information, we can reasonably assume
that A and B are independent events. Thus,
To summarize this section, we note that our interest in conditional probability is moti-
vated by the fact that events are often related. In such cases, we say the events are depen-
dent and the conditional probability formulas in equations (4.7) and (4.8) must be used to
compute the event probabilities. If two events are not related, they are independent; in this
case neither event’s probability is affected by whether the other event occurred.

Bayes’ Theorem
In the discussion of conditional probability, we indicated that revising probabilities when
new information is obtained is an important phase of probability analysis. Often, we begin
the analysis with initial or prior probability estimates for specific events of interest. Then,
from sources such as a sample, a special report, or a product test, we obtain additional
information about the events. Given this new information, we update the prior probability
values by calculating revised probabilities, referred to as posterior probabilities. Bayes’
theorem provides a means for making these probability calculations. The steps in this proba-
bility revision process are shown in Figure 4.9.

PROBABILITY REVISION USING BAYES’ THEOREM
As an application of Bayes’theorem, consider a manufacturing firm that receives ship-
ments of parts from two different suppliers. Let A1 denote the event that a part is from sup-
plier 1 and A2 denote the event that a part is from supplier 2. Currently, 65% of the parts
purchased by the company are from supplier 1 and the remaining 35% are from supplier 2.
Hence, if a part is selected at random, we would assign the prior probabilities P(A1)  .65
and P(A2)  .35.
The quality of the purchased parts varies with the source of supply. Historical data
suggest that the quality ratings of the two suppliers are as shown in Table 4.6. If we let G
denote the event that a part is good and B denote the event that a part is bad, the informa-
tion in Table 4.6 provides the following conditional probability values.
The tree diagram in Figure 4.10 depicts the process of the firm receiving a part from
one of the two suppliers and then discovering that the part is good or bad as a two-step
experiment. We see that four experimental outcomes are possible; two correspond to the
part being good and two correspond to the part being bad.
Each of the experimental outcomes is the intersection of two events, so we can use the
multiplication rule to compute the probabilities. For instance,
The process of computing these joint probabilities can be depicted in what is called 
a probability tree (see Figure 4.11). From left to right through the tree, the probabilities 
for each branch at step 1 are prior probabilities and the probabilities for each branch at 
step 2 are conditional probabilities. To find the probabilities of each experimental outcome,
we simply multiply the probabilities on the branches leading to the outcome. Each of these
joint probabilities is shown in Figure 4.11 along with the known probabilities for each
branch.
Suppose now that the parts from the two suppliers are used in the firm’s manufacturing
process and that a machine breaks down because it attempts to process a bad part. Given
the information that the part is bad, what is the probability that it came from supplier 1 and

To find P(B), we note that event B can occur in only two ways: (A1  B) and (A2  B).
Therefore, we have
(4.16)
Substituting from equations (4.15) and (4.16) into equation (4.14) and writing a similar
result for P(A2  B), we obtain Bayes’ theorem for the case of two events.
P(B)
 
 P(A1  B)  P(A2  B)
 P(A1)P(B  A1)  P(A2)P(B  A2)
Using equation (4.17) and the probability values provided in the example, we have
In addition, using equation (4.18), we find P(A2  B).
Note that in this application we started with a probability of .65 that a part selected at ran-
dom was from supplier 1. However, given information that the part is bad, the probability
that the part is from supplier 1 drops to .4262. In fact, if the part is bad, it has better than a
50–50 chance that it came from supplier 2; that is, P(A2  B)  .5738.
Bayes’ theorem is applicable when the events for which we want to compute posterior
probabilities are mutually exclusive and their union is the entire sample space.2 For the case
of n mutually exclusive events A1, A2, . . . , An, whose union is the entire sample space,
Bayes’ theorem can be used to compute any posterior probability P(Ai  B) as shown here.

Step 2. In column 4, compute the joint probabilities P(Ai  B) for each event and 
the new information B by using the multiplication law. These joint probabili-
ties are found by multiplying the prior probabilities in column 2 by the cor-
responding conditional probabilities in column 3; that is, P(Ai  B) 
P(Ai)P(B  Ai).
Step 3. Sum the joint probabilities in column 4. The sum is the probability of the new
information, P(B). Thus we see in Table 4.7 that there is a .0130 probability
that the part came from supplier 1 and is bad and a .0175 probability that the
part came from supplier 2 and is bad. Because these are the only two ways in
which a bad part can be obtained, the sum .0130  .0175 shows an overall
probability of .0305 of finding a bad part from the combined shipments of the
two suppliers.
Step 4. In column 5, compute the posterior probabilities using the basic relationship of
conditional probability.
Note that the joint probabilities P(Ai  B) are in column 4 and the probability
P(B) is the sum of column 4.

A consulting firm submitted a bid for a large research project. The firm’s management
initially felt they had a 50–50 chance of getting the project. However, the agency to which
the bid was submitted subsequently requested additional information on the bid. Past
experience indicates that for 75% of the successful bids and 40% of the unsuccessful bids,
the agency requested additional information.
a.
What is the prior probability of the bid being successful (that is, prior to the request
for additional information)?
b.
What is the conditional probability of a request for additional information given that
the bid will ultimately be successful?
c.
Compute the posterior probability that the bid will be successful given a request for
additional information.

Alocal bank reviewed its credit card policy with the intention of recalling some of its credit
cards. In the past approximately 5% of cardholders defaulted, leaving the bank unable to
collect the outstanding balance. Hence, management established a prior probability of .05
that any particular cardholder will default. The bank also found that the probability of miss-
ing a monthly payment is .20 for customers who do not default. Of course, the probability
of missing a monthly payment for those who default is 1.
a.
Given that a customer missed one or more monthly payments, compute the posterior
probability that the customer will default.
b.
The bank would like to recall its card if the probability that a customer will default is
greater than .20. Should the bank recall its card if the customer misses a monthly pay-
ment? Why or why not?

NOTES AND COMMENTS
1. Bayes’ theorem is used extensively in decision
analysis. The prior probabilities are often sub-
jective estimates provided by a decision maker.
Sample information is obtained and posterior
probabilities are computed for use in choosing
the best decision.
2. An event and its complement are mutually
exclusive, and their union is the entire sample
space. Thus, Bayes’ theorem is always applica-
ble for computing posterior probabilities of an
event and its complement.

Summary
In this chapter we introduced basic probability concepts and illustrated how probability
analysis can be used to provide helpful information for decision making. We described how
probability can be interpreted as a numerical measure of the likelihood that an event will
occur. In addition, we saw that the probability of an event can be computed either by sum-
ming the probabilities of the experimental outcomes (sample points) comprising the event
or by using the relationships established by the addition, conditional probability, and mul-
tiplication laws of probability. For cases in which additional information is available, we
showed how Bayes’ theorem can be used to obtain revised or posterior probabilities.
Glossary

Key Formulas

Sample point An element of the sample space. A sample point represents an experimental
outcome.
Tree diagramAgraphical representation that helps in visualizing a multiple-step experiment.
Basic requirements for assigning probabilities Two requirements that restrict the man-
ner in which probability assignments can be made: (1) for each experimental outcome Ei
we must have 0  P(Ei)  1; (2) considering all experimental outcomes, we must have
P(E1)  P(E2)  . . .  P(En)  1.0.
Classical method A method of assigning probabilities that is appropriate when all the
experimental outcomes are equally likely.
Relative frequency method A method of assigning probabilities that is appropriate when
data are available to estimate the proportion of the time the experimental outcome will oc-
cur if the experiment is repeated a large number of times.
Subjective method A method of assigning probabilities on the basis of judgment.
Event A collection of sample points.
Complement of A The event consisting of all sample points that are not in A.
Venn diagram A graphical representation for showing symbolically the sample space and
operations involving events in which the sample space is represented by a rectangle and
events are represented as circles within the sample space.
Union of A and B The event containing all sample points belonging to A or B or both. The
union is denoted A  B.
Intersection of A and B The event containing the sample points belonging to both A and
B. The intersection is denoted A  B.
Addition law A probability law used to compute the probability of the union of two events.
It is P(A  B)  P(A)  P(B)  P(A  B). For mutually exclusive events, P(A  B)  0;
in this case the addition law reduces to P(A  B)  P(A)  P(B).
Mutually exclusive events Events that have no sample points in common; that is, A  B
is empty and P(A  B)  0.
Conditional probability The probability of an event given that another event already
occurred. The conditional probability of A given B is P(A  B)  P(A  B)/P(B).
Joint probability The probability of two events both occurring; that is, the probability of
the intersection of two events.
Marginal probability The values in the margins of a joint probability table that provide
the probabilities of each event separately.
Independent events Two events A and B where P(A  B)  P(A) or P(B  A)  P(B); that
is, the events have no influence on each other.
Multiplication law A probability law used to compute the probability of the intersection of
two events. It is P(A  B)  P(B)P(A  B) or P(A  B)  P(A)P(B  A). For independent
events it reduces to P(A  B)  P(A)P(B).
Prior probabilities Initial estimates of the probabilities of events.
Posterior probabilities Revised probabilities of events based on additional information.
Bayes’ theorem A method used to compute posterior probabilities.

Par Fore created a website to market golf equipment and apparel. Management would like
a certain offer to appear for female visitors and a different offer to appear for male visitors.
From a sample of past website visits, management learned that 60% of the visitors to the
website ParFore are male and 40% are female.
a.
What is the prior probability that the next visitor to the website will be female?
b.
Suppose you know that the current visitor to the website ParFore previously visited the
Dillard’s website, and that women are three times as likely to visit the Dillard’s web-
site as men. What is the revised probability that the current visitor to the website Par-
Fore is female? Should you display the offer that appeals more to female visitors or the
one that appeals more to male visitors?
Case Problem Hamilton County Judges
Hamilton County judges try thousands of cases per year. In an overwhelming majority of
the cases disposed, the verdict stands as rendered. However, some cases are appealed,
and of those appealed, some of the cases are reversed. Kristen DelGuzzi of The Cincinnati
Enquirer conducted a study of cases handled by Hamilton County judges over a three-
year period. Shown in Table 4.8 are the results for 182,908 cases handled (disposed) by
38 judges in Common Pleas Court, Domestic Relations Court, and Municipal Court. Two
of the judges (Dinkelacker and Hogan) did not serve in the same court for the entire three-
year period.
The purpose of the newspaper’s study was to evaluate the performance of the judges.
Appeals are often the result of mistakes made by judges, and the newspaper wanted to know
which judges were doing a good job and which were making too many mistakes. You are

Discrete Probability Distributions
Citibank, the retail banking division of Citigroup, offers
a wide range of financial services including checking
and saving accounts, loans and mortgages, insurance,
and investment services. It delivers these services
through a unique system referred to as Citibanking.
Citibank was one of the first banks in the United
States to introduce automatic teller machines (ATMs).
Citibank’s ATMs, located in Citicard Banking Centers
(CBCs), let customers do all of their banking in one
place with the touch of a finger, 24 hours a day, 7 days a
week. More than 150 different banking functions—from
deposits to managing investments—can be performed
with ease. Citibank customers use ATMs for 80% of their
transactions.
Each Citibank CBC operates as a waiting line system
with randomly arriving customers seeking service at one
of the ATMs. If all ATMs are busy, the arriving customers
wait in line. Periodic CBC capacity studies are used to an-
alyze customer waiting times and to determine whether
additional ATMs are needed.
Data collected by Citibank showed that the random
customer arrivals followed a probability distribution
known as the Poisson distribution. Using the Poisson
distribution, Citibank can compute probabilities for the
number of customers arriving at a CBC during any time
period and make decisions concerning the number of
ATMs needed. For example, let x  the number of
customers arriving during a one-minute period. Assum-
ing that a particular CBC has a mean arrival rate of two
customersperminute,thefollowingtableshowstheprob-
abilities for the number of customers arriving during a

Discrete probability distributions, such as the one
used by Citibank, are the topic of this chapter. In addi-
tion to the Poisson distribution, you will learn about the
binomial and hypergeometric distributions and how they
can be used to provide helpful probability information.
Periodic capacity studies are used to analyze customer
waiting times and determine if additional ATMS are
needed.

In this chapter we continue the study of probability by introducing the concepts of random
variables and probability distributions. The focus of this chapter is discrete probability
distributions. Three special discrete probability distributions—the binomial, Poisson, and
hypergeometric—are covered.
5.1
Random Variables
In Chapter 4 we defined the concept of an experiment and its associated experimental out-
comes. A random variable provides a means for describing experimental outcomes using
numerical values. Random variables must assume numerical values.

5.1
Random Variables
195
In effect, a random variable associates a numerical value with each possible experimental
outcome. The particular numerical value of the random variable depends on the outcome of
the experiment. A random variable can be classified as being either discrete or continuous
depending on the numerical values it assumes.
Discrete Random Variables
A random variable that may assume either a finite number of values or an infinite sequence
of values such as 0, 1, 2, . . . is referred to as a discrete random variable. For example,
consider the experiment of an accountant taking the certified public accountant (CPA) ex-
amination. The examination has four parts. We can define a random variable as x  the
number of parts of the CPA examination passed. It is a discrete random variable because it
may assume the finite number of values 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.
As another example of a discrete random variable, consider the experiment of cars ar-
riving at a tollbooth. The random variable of interest is x  the number of cars arriving dur-
ing a one-day period. The possible values for x come from the sequence of integers 0, 1, 2,
and so on. Hence, x is a discrete random variable assuming one of the values in this infi-
nite sequence.
Although the outcomes of many experiments can naturally be described by numerical
values, others cannot. For example, a survey question might ask an individual to recall the
message in a recent television commercial. This experiment would have two possible out-
comes: The individual cannot recall the message and the individual can recall the message.
We can still describe these experimental outcomes numerically by defining the discrete ran-
dom variable x as follows: let x  0 if the individual cannot recall the message and x  1
if the individual can recall the message. The numerical values for this random variable are
arbitrary (we could use 5 and 10), but they are acceptable in terms of the definition of a ran-
dom variable—namely, x is a random variable because it provides a numerical description
of the outcome of the experiment.
Table 5.1 provides some additional examples of discrete random variables. Note that in
each example the discrete random variable assumes a finite number of values or an infinite
sequence of values such as 0, 1, 2, . . . . These types of discrete random variables are dis-
cussed in detail in this chapter.

Chapter 5
Discrete Probability Distributions
NOTES AND COMMENTS
One way to determine whether a random variable
is discrete or continuous is to think of the values of
the random variable as points on a line segment.
Choose two points representing values of the ran-
dom variable. If the entire line segment between
the two points also represents possible values for
the random variable, then the random variable is
continuous.
Continuous Random Variables
A random variable that may assume any numerical value in an interval or collection of in-
tervals is called a continuous random variable. Experimental outcomes based on mea-
surement scales such as time, weight, distance, and temperature can be described by
continuous random variables. For example, consider an experiment of monitoring incom-
ing telephone calls to the claims office of a major insurance company. Suppose the random
variable of interest is x  the time between consecutive incoming calls in minutes. This ran-
dom variable may assume any value in the interval x  0. Actually, an infinite number of
values are possible for x, including values such as 1.26 minutes, 2.751 minutes, 4.3333 min-
utes, and so on. As another example, consider a 90-mile section of interstate highway I-75
north of Atlanta, Georgia. For an emergency ambulance service located in Atlanta, we might
define the random variable as x  number of miles to the location of the next traffic acci-
dent along this section of I-75. In this case, x would be a continuous random variable as-
suming any value in the interval 0  x  90. Additional examples of continuous random
variables are listed in Table 5.2. Note that each example describes a random variable that
may assume any value in an interval of values. Continuous random variables and their
probability distributions will be the topic of Chapter 6.

Discrete Probability Distributions
The probability distribution for a random variable describes how probabilities are dis-
tributed over the values of the random variable. For a discrete random variable x, the proba-
bility distribution is defined by a probability function, denoted by f(x). The probability
function provides the probability for each value of the random variable.
As an illustration of a discrete random variable and its probability distribution, consider
the sales of automobiles at DiCarlo Motors in Saratoga, New York. Over the past 300 days
of operation, sales data show 54 days with no automobiles sold, 117 days with 1 automo-
bile sold, 72 days with 2 automobiles sold, 42 days with 3 automobiles sold, 12 days with
4 automobiles sold, and 3 days with 5 automobiles sold. Suppose we consider the experi-
ment of selecting a day of operation at DiCarlo Motors and define the random variable of
interest as x  the number of automobiles sold during a day. From historical data, we know

REQUIRED CONDITIONS FOR A DISCRETE PROBABILITY FUNCTION
(5.1)
(5.2)
 f (x)  1
f (x)  0
These conditions are the
analogs to the two basic
requirements for assigning
probabilities to
experimental outcomes
presented in Chapter 4.
x is a discrete random variable that can assume the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. In probability
function notation, f(0) provides the probability of 0 automobiles sold, f(1) provides the
probability of 1 automobile sold, and so on. Because historical data show 54 of 300 days
with 0 automobiles sold, we assign the value 54/300  .18 to f(0), indicating that the proba-
bility of 0 automobiles being sold during a day is .18. Similarly, because 117 of 300 days
had 1 automobile sold, we assign the value 117/300  .39 to f(1), indicating that the proba-
bility of exactly 1 automobile being sold during a day is .39. Continuing in this way for the
other values of the random variable, we compute the values for f(2), f(3), f(4), and f(5) as
shown in Table 5.3, the probability distribution for the number of automobiles sold during
a day at DiCarlo Motors.
A primary advantage of defining a random variable and its probability distribution is
that once the probability distribution is known, it is relatively easy to determine the proba-
bility of a variety of events that may be of interest to a decision maker. For example, using
the probability distribution for DiCarlo Motors as shown in Table 5.3, we see that the most
probable number of automobiles sold during a day is 1 with a probability of f(1)  .39. In
addition, there is an f(3)  f(4)  f(5)  .14  .04  .01  .19 probability of selling 3 or
more automobiles during a day. These probabilities, plus others the decision maker may ask
about, provide information that can help the decision maker understand the process of
selling automobiles at DiCarlo Motors.
In the development of a probability function for any discrete random variable, the fol-
lowing two conditions must be satisfied.
Table 5.3 shows that the probabilities for the random variable x satisfy equation (5.1); f(x)
is greater than or equal to 0 for all values of x. In addition, because the probabilities sum to
1, equation (5.2) is satisfied. Thus, the DiCarlo Motors probability function is a valid dis-
crete probability function.
We can also present probability distributions graphically. In Figure 5.1 the values of the
random variable x for DiCarlo Motors are shown on the horizontal axis and the probability
associated with these values is shown on the vertical axis.
In addition to tables and graphs, a formula that gives the probability function, f(x), for
every value of x is often used to describe probability distributions. The simplest example of

a discrete probability distribution given by a formula is the discrete uniform probability
distribution. Its probability function is defined by equation (5.3).
For example, suppose that for the experiment of rolling a die we define the random
variable x to be the number of dots on the upward face. For this experiment, n  6 values
are possible for the random variable; x  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Thus, the probability function for
this discrete uniform random variable is

provides the probability that the random variable assumes a value of 2.
The more widely used discrete probability distributions generally are specified by for-
mulas. Three important cases are the binomial, Poisson, and hypergeometric distributions;
these distributions are discussed later in the chapter.

Expected Value and Variance
Expected Value
The expected value, or mean, of a random variable is a measure of the central location for the
random variable. The formula for the expected value of a discrete random variable x follows.

Expected Value and Variance
203
Both the notations E(x) and μ are used to denote the expected value of a random variable.
Equation (5.4) shows that to compute the expected value of a discrete random variable,
we must multiply each value of the random variable by the corresponding probability f(x) and
then add the resulting products. Using the DiCarlo Motors automobile sales example from
Section 5.2, we show the calculation of the expected value for the number of automobiles sold
during a day in Table 5.4. The sum of the entries in the xf(x) column shows that the expected
value is 1.50 automobiles per day. We therefore know that although sales of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5
automobiles are possible on any one day, over time DiCarlo can anticipate selling an average
of 1.50 automobiles per day. Assuming 30 days of operation during a month, we can use the
expected value of 1.50 to forecast average monthly sales of 30(1.50)  45 automobiles.
Variance
Even though the expected value provides the mean value for the random variable, we often
need a measure of variability, or dispersion. Just as we used the variance in Chapter 3 to
summarize the variability in data, we now use variance to summarize the variability in the
values of a random variable. The formula for the variance of a discrete random variable
follows.

VARIANCE OF A DISCRETE RANDOM VARIABLE
(5.5)
Var(x)  σ 2  (x  μ)2f(x)
The variance is a weighted
average of the squared
deviations of a random
variable from its mean. The
weights are the probabilities.
As equation (5.5) shows, an essential part of the variance formula is the deviation, x  μ,
which measures how far a particular value of the random variable is from the expected
value, or mean, μ. In computing the variance of a random variable, the deviations are
squared and then weighted by the corresponding value of the probability function. The sum
of these weighted squared deviations for all values of the random variable is referred to as
the variance. The notations Var(x) and σ 2 are both used to denote the variance of a random
variable.

The calculation of the variance for the probability distribution of the number of 
automobiles sold during a day at DiCarlo Motors is summarized in Table 5.5. We see 
that the variance is 1.25. The standard deviation, σ, is defined as the positive square root of
the variance. Thus, the standard deviation for the number of automobiles sold during a day is
The standard deviation is measured in the same units as the random variable (σ  1.118 auto-
mobiles) and therefore is often preferred in describing the variability of a random variable.
The variance σ 2 is measured in squared units and is thus more difficult to interpret.

Chapter 5
Discrete Probability Distributions
A Binomial Experiment
A binomial experiment exhibits the following four properties.
If properties 2, 3, and 4 are present, we say the trials are generated by a Bernoulli process.
If, in addition, property 1 is present, we say we have a binomial experiment. Figure 5.2 de-
picts one possible sequence of successes and failures for a binomial experiment involving
eight trials.
In a binomial experiment, our interest is in the number of successes occurring in the n
trials. If we let x denote the number of successes occurring in the n trials, we see that x can
assume the values of 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . , n. Because the number of values is finite, x is a discrete
random variable. The probability distribution associated with this random variable is called
the binomial probability distribution. For example, consider the experiment of tossing a
coin five times and on each toss observing whether the coin lands with a head or a tail on
its upward face. Suppose we want to count the number of heads appearing over the five
tosses. Does this experiment show the properties of a binomial experiment? What is the ran-
dom variable of interest? Note that
1. The experiment consists of five identical trials; each trial involves the tossing of 
one coin.
2. Two outcomes are possible for each trial: a head or a tail. We can designate head a
success and tail a failure.
3. The probability of a head and the probability of a tail are the same for each trial,
with p  .5 and 1  p  .5.
4. The trials or tosses are independent because the outcome on any one trial is not
affected by what happens on other trials or tosses.
PROPERTIES OF A BINOMIAL EXPERIMENT
1. The experiment consists of a sequence of n identical trials.
2. Two outcomes are possible on each trial. We refer to one outcome as a suc-
cess and the other outcome as a failure.
3. The probability of a success, denoted by p, does not change from trial to trial.
Consequently, the probability of a failure, denoted by 1  p, does not change
from trial to trial.
4. The trials are independent.
Property 1:
The experiment consists of
n  8 identical trials.
Property 2:
Each trial results in either
success (S) or failure (F).

Binomial Probability Distribution

Thus, the properties of a binomial experiment are satisfied. The random variable of inter-
est is x  the number of heads appearing in the five trials. In this case, x can assume the
values of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
As another example, consider an insurance salesperson who visits 10 randomly selected
families. The outcome associated with each visit is classified as a success if the family pur-
chases an insurance policy and a failure if the family does not. From past experience, the
salesperson knows the probability that a randomly selected family will purchase an insur-
ance policy is .10. Checking the properties of a binomial experiment, we observe that
1. The experiment consists of 10 identical trials; each trial involves contacting one family.
2. Two outcomes are possible on each trial: the family purchases a policy (success) or
the family does not purchase a policy (failure).
3. The probabilities of a purchase and a nonpurchase are assumed to be the same for
each sales call, with p  .10 and 1  p  .90.
4. The trials are independent because the families are randomly selected.
Because the four assumptions are satisfied, this example is a binomial experiment. The
random variable of interest is the number of sales obtained in contacting the 10 families. In
this case, x can assume the values of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.
Property 3 of the binomial experiment is called the stationarity assumption and is
sometimes confused with property 4, independence of trials. To see how they differ, consider
again the case of the salesperson calling on families to sell insurance policies. If, as the day
wore on, the salesperson got tired and lost enthusiasm, the probability of success (selling a
policy) might drop to .05, for example, by the tenth call. In such a case, property 3 (station-
arity) would not be satisfied, and we would not have a binomial experiment. Even if prop-
erty 4 held—that is, the purchase decisions of each family were made independently—it
would not be a binomial experiment if property 3 was not satisfied.
In applications involving binomial experiments, a special mathematical formula, called
the binomial probability function, can be used to compute the probability of x successes
in the n trials. Using probability concepts introduced in Chapter 4, we will show in the
context of an illustrative problem how the formula can be developed.
Martin Clothing Store Problem
Let us consider the purchase decisions of the next three customers who enter the Martin
Clothing Store. On the basis of past experience, the store manager estimates the probability
that any one customer will make a purchase is .30. What is the probability that two of the
next three customers will make a purchase?
Using a tree diagram (Figure 5.3), we can see that the experiment of observing the three
customers each making a purchase decision has eight possible outcomes. Using S to denote
success (a purchase) and F to denote failure (no purchase), we are interested in experi-
mental outcomes involving two successes in the three trials (purchase decisions). Next, let
us verify that the experiment involving the sequence of three purchase decisions can be
viewed as a binomial experiment. Checking the four requirements for a binomial experi-
ment, we note that:
1. The experiment can be described as a sequence of three identical trials, one trial for
each of the three customers who will enter the store.
2. Two outcomes—the customer makes a purchase (success) or the customer does not
make a purchase (failure)—are possible for each trial.
3. The probability that the customer will make a purchase (.30) or will not make a pur-
chase (.70) is assumed to be the same for all customers.
4. The purchase decision of each customer is independent of the decisions of the
other customers.

outcomes involving two purchases; that is, the number of ways of obtaining x  2 successes
in the n  3 trials. From equation (5.6) we have
Equation (5.6) shows that three of the experimental outcomes yield two successes. From
Figure 5.3 we see that these three outcomes are denoted by (S, S, F), (S, F, S), and (F, S, S).
Using equation (5.6) to determine how many experimental outcomes have three
successes (purchases) in the three trials, we obtain
From Figure 5.3 we see that the one experimental outcome with three successes is identi-
fied by (S, S, S).
We know that equation (5.6) can be used to determine the number of experimental out-
comes that result in x successes. If we are to determine the probability of x successes in 
n trials, however, we must also know the probability associated with each of these experi-
mental outcomes. Because the trials of a binomial experiment are independent, we can sim-
ply multiply the probabilities associated with each trial outcome to find the probability of
a particular sequence of successes and failures.
The probability of purchases by the first two customers and no purchase by the third
customer, denoted (S, S, F), is given by
With a .30 probability of a purchase on any one trial, the probability of a purchase on the
first two trials and no purchase on the third is given by
Two other experimental outcomes also result in two successes and one failure. The proba-
bilities for all three experimental outcomes involving two successes follow.

Observe that all three experimental outcomes with two successes have exactly the same
probability. This observation holds in general. In any binomial experiment, all sequences
of trial outcomes yielding x successes in n trials have the same probability of occurrence.
The probability of each sequence of trials yielding x successes in n trials follows.

Discrete Probability Distributions

For the Martin Clothing Store, this formula shows that any experimental outcome with two
successes has a probability of p2(1  p)(32)  p2(1  p)1  (.30)2(.70)1  .063.
Because equation (5.6) shows the number of outcomes in a binomial experiment with x
successes and equation (5.7) gives the probability for each sequence involving x successes,
we combine equations (5.6) and (5.7) to obtain the following binomial probability function.
Probability of a particular
sequence of trial outcomes
with x successes in n trials
 p x(1  p)(nx)
For the binomial probability distribution, x is a discrete random variable with the probabil-
ity function f(x) applicable for values of x  0, 1, 2, . . ., n. 
In the Martin Clothing Store example, let us use equation (5.8) to compute the proba-
bility that no customer makes a purchase, exactly one customer makes a purchase, exactly
two customers make a purchase, and all three customers make a purchase. The calculations
are summarized in Table 5.6, which gives the probability distribution of the number of cus-
tomers making a purchase. Figure 5.4 is a graph of this probability distribution.
The binomial probability function can be applied to any binomial experiment. If we are
satisfied that a situation demonstrates the properties of a binomial experiment and if we
know the values of n and p, we can use equation (5.8) to compute the probability of x suc-
cesses in the n trials.

If we consider variations of the Martin experiment, such as 10 customers rather than 3
entering the store, the binomial probability function given by equation (5.8) is still applic-
able. Suppose we have a binomial experiment with n  10, x  4, and p  .30. The prob-
ability of making exactly four sales to 10 customers entering the store is
Using Tables of Binomial Probabilities
Tables have been developed that give the probability of x successes in n trials for a binomial
experiment. The tables are generally easy to use and quicker than equation (5.8). Table 5 of
Appendix B provides such a table of binomial probabilities. A portion of this table appears
in Table 5.7. To use this table, we must specify the values of n, p, and x for the binomial ex-
periment of interest. In the example at the top of Table 5.7, we see that the probability of
x  3 successes in a binomial experiment with n  10 and p  .40 is .2150. You can use
equation (5.8) to verify that you would obtain the same answer if you used the binomial
probability function directly.
Now let us use Table 5.7 to verify the probability of four successes in 10 trials for the
Martin Clothing Store problem. Note that the value of f(4)  .2001 can be read directly
from the table of binomial probabilities, with n  10, x  4, and p  .30.
Even though the tables of binomial probabilities are relatively easy to use, it is im-
possible to have tables that show all possible values of n and p that might be encountered
in a binomial experiment. However, with today’s calculators, using equation (5.8) to
calculate the desired probability is not difficult, especially if the number of trials is not 
large. In the exercises, you should practice using equation (5.8) to compute the binomial
probabilities unless the problem specifically requests that you use the binomial proba-
bility table.

Chapter 5
Discrete Probability Distributions
Statistical software packages such as Minitab and spreadsheet packages such as Excel
also provide a capability for computing binomial probabilities. Consider the Martin Cloth-
ing Store example with n  10 and p  .30. Figure 5.5 shows the binomial probabilities
generated by Minitab for all possible values of x. Note that these values are the same as
those found in the p  .30 column of Table 5.7. Appendix 5.1 gives the step-by-step pro-
cedure for using Minitab to generate the output in Figure 5.5. Appendix 5.2 describes how
Excel can be used to compute binomial probabilities.
Expected Value and Variance for the 
Binomial Distribution
In Section 5.3 we provided formulas for computing the expected value and variance 
of a discrete random variable. In the special case where the random variable has a bi-
nomial distribution with a known number of trials n and a known probability of success p,
the general formulas for the expected value and variance can be simplified. The results
follow.

For the Martin Clothing Store problem with three customers, we can use equation (5.9)
to compute the expected number of customers who will make a purchase.
Suppose that for the next month the Martin Clothing Store forecasts that 1000 cus-
tomers will enter the store. What is the expected number of customers who will make a pur-
chase? The answer is μ  np  (1000)(.3)  300. Thus, to increase the expected number
of purchases, Martin’s must induce more customers to enter the store and/or somehow in-
crease the probability that any individual customer will make a purchase after entering.
For the Martin Clothing Store problem with three customers, we see that the variance
and standard deviation for the number of customers who will make a purchase are

NOTES AND COMMENTS
1. The binomial table in Appendix B shows values
of p up to and including p  .95. Some sources
of the binomial table only show values of p up to
and including p  .50. It would appear that such
a table cannot be used when the probability of
success exceeds p  .50. However, the table can
be used by noting that the probability of n  x
failures is also the probability of x successes.
Thus, when the probability of success is greater
than p  .50, we can compute the probability of
n  x failures instead. The probability of failure,
1  p, will be less than .50 when p  .50.
2. Some sources present the binomial table in a cu-
mulative form. In using such a table, one must
subtract entries in the table to find the probabil-
ity of exactly x success in n trials. For example,
f(2)  P(x  2)  P(x  1). The binomial table
we provide in Appendix B provides f(2) directly.
To compute cumulative probabilities using the
binomial table in Appendix B, sum the entries in
the table. For example, to determine the cumu-
lative probability P(x  2), compute the sum
f(0)  f(1)  f(2).

Siméon Poisson taught
mathematics at the École
Polytechnique in Paris
from 1802 to 1808. In 1837,
he published a work
entitled, “Researches on
the Probability of Criminal
and Civil Verdicts,” which
includes a discussion of
what later became known
as the Poisson distribution.
The Poisson probability function is defined by equation (5.11).
For the Poisson probability distribution, x is a discrete random variable indicating the num-
ber of occurrences in the interval. Since there is no stated upper limit for the number of oc-
currences, the probability function f(x) is applicable for values x  0, 1, 2, . . . without
limit. In practical applications, x will eventually become large enough so that f (x) is ap-
proximately zero and the probability of any larger values of x becomes negligible.
An Example Involving Time Intervals
Suppose that we are interested in the number of arrivals at the drive-up teller window of a
bank during a 15-minute period on weekday mornings. If we can assume that the probability
of a car arriving is the same for any two time periods of equal length and that the arrival or
nonarrival of a car in any time period is independent of the arrival or nonarrival in any other
time period, the Poisson probability function is applicable. Suppose these assumptions are
satisfied and an analysis of historical data shows that the average number of cars arriving in
a 15-minute period of time is 10; in this case, the following probability function applies.

Bell Labs used the Poisson
distribution to model the
arrival of telephone calls.

Poisson Probability Distribution
In this section we consider a discrete random variable that is often useful in estimating the
number of occurrences over a specified interval of time or space. For example, the random
variable of interest might be the number of arrivals at a car wash in one hour, the number
of repairs needed in 10 miles of highway, or the number of leaks in 100 miles of pipeline.
If the following two properties are satisfied, the number of occurrences is a random vari-
able described by the Poisson probability distribution.

TABLE 5.8
SELECTED VALUES FROM THE POISSON PROBABILITY TABLES 
EXAMPLE: μ  10, x  5; f(5)  .0378
The random variable here is x  number of cars arriving in any 15-minute period.
If management wanted to know the probability of exactly five arrivals in 15 minutes,
we would set x  5 and thus obtain
Although this probability was determined by evaluating the probability function with μ  10
and x  5, it is often easier to refer to a table for the Poisson distribution. The table provides
probabilities for specific values of x and μ. We included such a table as Table 7 of Appen-
dix B. For convenience, we reproduced a portion of this table as Table 5.8. Note that to use
the table of Poisson probabilities, we need know only the values of x and μ. From Table 5.8 
we see that the probability of five arrivals in a 15-minute period is found by locating the value
in the row of the table corresponding to x  5 and the column of the table corresponding to
μ  10. Hence, we obtain f(5)  .0378.
In the preceding example, the mean of the Poisson distribution is μ  10 arrivals per 
15-minute period. A property of the Poisson distribution is that the mean of the distribution
and the variance of the distribution are equal. Thus, the variance for the number of arrivals
during 15-minute periods is σ 2  10. The standard deviation is σ 
Our illustration involves a 15-minute period, but other time periods can be used.
Suppose we want to compute the probability of one arrival in a 3-minute period. Because

Chapter 5
Discrete Probability Distributions
10 is the expected number of arrivals in a 15-minute period, we see that 10/15  2/3 
is the expected number of arrivals in a 1-minute period and that (2/3)(3 minutes)  2 
is the expected number of arrivals in a 3-minute period. Thus, the probability of x
arrivals in a 3-minute time period with μ  2 is given by the following Poisson
probability function.
The probability of one arrival in a 3-minute period is calculated as follows:
Earlier we computed the probability of five arrivals in a 15-minute period; it was .0378.
Note that the probability of one arrival in a 3-minute period (.2707) is not the same. When
computing a Poisson probability for a different time interval, we must first convert the mean
arrival rate to the time period of interest and then compute the probability.
An Example Involving Length or Distance Intervals
Let us illustrate an application not involving time intervals in which the Poisson
distribution is useful. Suppose we are concerned with the occurrence of major defects
in a highway one month after resurfacing. We will assume that the probability of a 
defect is the same for any two highway intervals of equal length and that the occurrence
or nonoccurrence of a defect in any one interval is independent of the occurrence or
nonoccurrence of a defect in any other interval. Hence, the Poisson distribution can be
applied.
Suppose we learn that major defects one month after resurfacing occur at the average
rate of two per mile. Let us find the probability of no major defects in a particular 3-mile
section of the highway. Because we are interested in an interval with a length of 3 miles,
μ  (2 defects/mile)(3 miles)  6 represents the expected number of major defects over the
3-mile section of highway. Using equation (5.11), the probability of no major defects is
f(0)  60e6/0!  .0025. Thus, it is unlikely that no major defects will occur in the 3-mile
section. In fact, this example indicates a 1  .0025  .9975 probability of at least one major
defect in the 3-mile highway section.

represents the number of ways that x successes can be selected 
from a total of r successes in the population; and 
represents the number of ways 
that n  x failures can be selected from a total of N  r failures in the population.
For the hypergeometric probability distribution, x is a discrete random variable and the
probability function f (x) given by equation (5.12) is usually applicable for values of x  0,
1, 2, . . ., n. However, only values of x where the number of observed successes is less than
or equal to the number of successes in the population (x  r) and where the number of
observed failures is less than or equal to the number of failures in the population
(n  x  N  r) are valid. If these two conditions do not hold for one or more values of x,
the corresponding value of  f(x)  0, indicating that the probability of this value of x is zero.

aged in boxes of 12 units each. Suppose an inspector randomly selects 3 of the 12 fuses

In the usual notation for the hypergeometric distribution, r denotes the number of
elements in the population of size N labeled success, and N  r denotes the number of
elements in the population labeled failure. The hypergeometric probability function
is used to compute the probability that in a random selection of n elements, selected
without replacement, we obtain x elements labeled success and n  x elements labeled
failure. For this outcome to occur, we must obtain x successes from the r successes in
the population and n  x failures from the N  r failures. The following hypergeo-
metric probability function provides f(x), the probability of obtaining x successes in
n trials.

NOTES AND COMMENTS
Consider a hypergeometric distribution with n trials.
Let p  (r/N) denote the probability of a success on
the first trial. If the population size is large, the term 
(N  n)/(N  1) in equation (5.14) approaches 1. As 
a result, the expected value and variance can be writ-
ten E(x)  np and Var(x)  np(1  p). Note that these
expressions are the same as the expressions used to
compute the expected value and variance of a binomial
distribution, as in equations (5.9) and (5.10). When the
population size is large, a hypergeometric distribu-
tion can be approximated by a binomial distribution
with n trials and a probability of success p  (r/N).

The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), passed by the U.S. Congress in October

crease in lending to help jump-start the economy. But three months later, a Federal
Reserve survey found that two-thirds of the banks that had received TARP funds had
tightened terms for business loans (The Wall Street Journal, February 3, 2009). Of the 10
banks that were the biggest recipients of TARP funds, only 3 had actually increased lend-
ing during this period.

the study that had increased lending. What value of x has the highest probability?
d.
What is the probability that the study will have at least one bank that had increased
lending?
e.
Compute the expected value, variance, and standard deviation for the random variable. 
Summary
A random variable provides a numerical description of the outcome of an experiment. The
probability distribution for a random variable describes how the probabilities are distrib-
uted over the values the random variable can assume. For any discrete random variable 
x, the probability distribution is defined by a probability function, denoted by f(x), which
provides the probability associated with each value of the random variable. Once the
probability function is defined, we can compute the expected value, variance, and standard
deviation for the random variable.
The binomial distribution can be used to determine the probability of x successes in n
trials whenever the experiment has the following properties:
1. The experiment consists of a sequence of n identical trials.
2. Two outcomes are possible on each trial, one called success and the other failure.
3. The probability of a success p does not change from trial to trial. Consequently, the
probability of failure, 1  p, does not change from trial to trial.
4. The trials are independent.
When the four properties hold, the binomial probability function can be used to determine
the probability of obtaining x successes in n trials. Formulas were also presented for the
mean and variance of the binomial distribution.
The Poisson distribution is used when it is desirable to determine the probability of ob-
taining x occurrences over an interval of time or space. The following assumptions are nec-
essary for the Poisson distribution to be applicable.
1. The probability of an occurrence of the event is the same for any two intervals of
equal length.
2. The occurrence or nonoccurrence of the event in any interval is independent of the
occurrence or nonoccurrence of the event in any other interval.
A third discrete probability distribution, the hypergeometric, was introduced in Sec-
tion 5.6. Like the binomial, it is used to compute the probability of x successes in n trials.
But, in contrast to the binomial, the probability of success changes from trial to trial.

Many companies use a quality control technique called acceptance sampling to monitor in-
coming shipments of parts, raw materials, and so on. In the electronics industry, component
parts are commonly shipped from suppliers in large lots. Inspection of a sample of n com-
ponents can be viewed as the n trials of a binomial experiment. The outcome for each com-
ponent tested (trial) will be that the component is classified as good or defective. Reynolds
Electronics accepts a lot from a particular supplier if the defective components in the lot do
not exceed 1%. Suppose a random sample of five items from a recent shipment is tested.
a.
Assume that 1% of the shipment is defective. Compute the probability that no items
in the sample are defective.
b.
Assume that 1% of the shipment is defective. Compute the probability that exactly one
item in the sample is defective.

Discrete Probability Distributions
Appendix 5.1 Discrete Probability Distributions Using Minitab
Statistical packages such as Minitab offer a relatively easy and efficient procedure for com-
puting binomial probabilities. In this appendix, we show the step-by-step procedure for
determining the binomial probabilities for the Martin Clothing Store problem in Section 5.4.
Recall that the desired binomial probabilities are based on n  10 and p  .30. Before
beginning the Minitab routine, the user must enter the desired values of the random variable
x into a column of the worksheet. We entered the values 0, 1, 2, . . . , 10 in column 1 (see
Figure 5.5) to generate the entire binomial probability distribution. The Minitab steps to ob-
tain the desired binomial probabilities follow.
Step 1. Select the Calc menu
Step 2. Choose Probability Distributions
Step 3. Choose Binomial
Step 4. When the Binomial Distribution dialog box appears:
Select Probability
Enter 10 in the Number of trials box
Enter .3 in the Event probability box
Enter C1 in the Input column box
Click OK
The Minitab output with the binomial probabilities will appear as shown in Figure 5.5.
Minitab provides Poisson and hypergeometric probabilities in a similar manner. For in-
stance, to compute Poisson probabilities the only differences are in step 3, where the Pois-
son option would be selected, and step 4, where the Mean would be entered rather than the
number of trials and the probability of success.
Appendix 5.2 Discrete Probability Distributions Using Excel
Excel provides functions for computing probabilities for the binomial, Poisson, and hypergeo-
metric distributions introduced in this chapter. The Excel function for computing binomial proba-
bilities is BINOMDIST. It has four arguments: x(the number of successes), n(the number of trials),
p(the probability of success), and cumulative. FALSEis used for the fourth argument (cumulative)
if we want the probability of x successes, and TRUE is used for the fourth argument if we want the
cumulative probability of xor fewer successes. Here we show how to compute the probabilities of
0 through 10 successes for the Martin Clothing Store problem in Section 5.4 (see Figure 5.5).
As we describe the worksheet development, refer to Figure 5.6; the formula worksheet
is set in the background, and the value worksheet appears in the foreground. We entered the
number of trials (10) into cell B1, the probability of success into cell B2, and the values
for the random variable into cells B5:B15. The following steps will generate the desired
probabilities:
Step 1. Use the BINOMDIST function to compute the probability of x  0 by entering
the following formula into cell C5:
Step 2. Copy the formula in cell C5 into cells C6:C15.

The value worksheet in Figure 5.6 shows that the probabilities obtained are the same
as in Figure 5.5. Poisson and hypergeometric probabilities can be computed in a similar
fashion. The POISSON and HYPGEOMDIST functions are used. Excel’s Insert Function
dialog box can help the user in entering the proper arguments for these functions (see
Appendix E).

Procter & Gamble (P&G) produces and markets
such products as detergents, disposable diapers, over-the-
counter pharmaceuticals, dentifrices, bar soaps, mouth-
washes, and paper towels. Worldwide, it has the leading
brand in more categories than any other consumer prod-
ucts company. Since its merger with Gillette, P&G also
produces and markets razors, blades, and many other 
personal care products.
As a leader in the application of statistical methods
in decision making, P&G employs people with diverse
academic backgrounds: engineering, statistics, opera-
tions research, and business. The major quantitative
technologies for which these people provide support are
probabilistic decision and risk analysis, advanced simu-
lation, quality improvement, and quantitative methods
(e.g., linear programming, regression analysis, probabil-
ity analysis).
The Industrial Chemicals Division of P&G is a ma-
jor supplier of fatty alcohols derived from natural sub-
stances such as coconut oil and from petroleum-based
derivatives. The division wanted to know the economic
risks and opportunities of expanding its fatty-alcohol
production facilities, so it called in P&G’s experts in
probabilistic decision and risk analysis to help. After
structuring and modeling the problem, they determined
that the key to profitability was the cost difference
between the petroleum- and coconut-based raw materi-
als. Future costs were unknown, but the analysts were
able to approximate them with the following continuous
random variables.
x  the coconut oil price per pound of fatty alcohol
and
y  the petroleum raw material price per pound 
of fatty alcohol
Because the key to profitability was the difference
between these two random variables, a third random
variable, d  x  y, was used in the analysis. Experts
were interviewed to determine the probability distribu-
tions for x and y. In turn, this information was used to de-
velop a probability distribution for the difference in
prices d. This continuous probability distribution
showed a .90 probability that the price difference would
be $.0655 or less and a .50 probability that the price dif-
ference would be $.035 or less. In addition, there was
only a .10 probability that the price difference would be
$.0045 or less.†
The Industrial Chemicals Division thought that
being able to quantify the impact of raw material price
differences was key to reaching a consensus. The proba-
bilities obtained were used in a sensitivity analysis of the
raw material price difference. The analysis yielded
sufficient insight to form the basis for a recommendation
to management.
The use of continuous random variables and their
probability distributions was helpful to P&G in analyz-
ing the economic risks associated with its fatty-alcohol
production. In this chapter, you will gain an under-
standing of continuous random variables and their
probability distributions, including one of the most
important probability distributions in statistics, the
normal distribution.

Chapter 6
Continuous Probability Distributions
In the preceding chapter we discussed discrete random variables and their probability dis-
tributions. In this chapter we turn to the study of continuous random variables. Specifi-
cally, we discuss three continuous probability distributions: the uniform, the normal, and
the exponential.
Afundamental difference separates discrete and continuous random variables in terms of
how probabilities are computed. For a discrete random variable, the probability function f(x)
provides the probability that the random variable assumes a particular value. With continuous
random variables, the counterpart of the probability function is the probability density func-
tion, also denoted by f(x). The difference is that the probability density function does not
directly provide probabilities. However, the area under the graph of f(x) corresponding to a
given interval does provide the probability that the continuous random variable x assumes a
value in that interval. So when we compute probabilities for continuous random variables, we
are computing the probability that the random variable assumes any value in an interval.
Because the area under the graph of f(x) at any particular point is zero, one of the im-
plications of the definition of probability for continuous random variables is that the proba-
bility of any particular value of the random variable is zero. In Section 6.1 we demonstrate
these concepts for a continuous random variable that has a uniform distribution.
Much of the chapter is devoted to describing and showing applications of the normal
distribution. The normal distribution is of major importance because of its wide applica-
bility and its extensive use in statistical inference. The chapter closes with a discussion of
the exponential distribution. The exponential distribution is useful in applications involv-
ing such factors as waiting times and service times.
6.1
Uniform Probability Distribution
Consider the random variable x representing the flight time of an airplane traveling from
Chicago to New York. Suppose the flight time can be any value in the interval from 120 min-
utes to 140 minutes. Because the random variable x can assume any value in that interval,
x is a continuous rather than a discrete random variable. Let us assume that sufficient actual
flight data are available to conclude that the probability of a flight time within any 1-minute
interval is the same as the probability of a flight time within any other 1-minute interval
contained in the larger interval from 120 to 140 minutes. With every 1-minute interval be-
ing equally likely, the random variable x is said to have a uniform probability distribu-
tion. The probability density function, which defines the uniform distribution for the
flight-time random variable, is
Figure 6.1 is a graph of this probability density function. In general, the uniform proba-
bility density function for a random variable x is defined by the following formula.

Uniform Probability Distribution

As noted in the introduction, for a continuous random variable, we consider proba-
bility only in terms of the likelihood that a random variable assumes a value within a
specified interval. In the flight-time example, an acceptable probability question is: 
What is the probability that the flight time is between 120 and 130 minutes? That is, what
is P(120  x  130)? Because the flight time must be between 120 and 140 minutes 
and because the probability is described as being uniform over this interval, we feel
comfortable saying P(120  x  130)  .50. In the following subsection we show that
this probability can be computed as the area under the graph of f(x) from 120 to 130 
(see Figure 6.2).
Area as a Measure of Probability
Let us make an observation about the graph in Figure 6.2. Consider the area under the graph
of f(x) in the interval from 120 to 130. The area is rectangular, and the area of a rectangle
is simply the width multiplied by the height. With the width of the interval equal to 130 
120  10 and the height equal to the value of the probability density function f(x)  1/20,
we have area  width  height  10(1/20)  10/20  .50.

What observation can you make about the area under the graph of f(x) and probability?
They are identical! Indeed, this observation is valid for all continuous random variables.
Once a probability density function f(x) is identified, the probability that x takes a value be-
tween some lower value x1 and some higher value x2 can be found by computing the area
under the graph of f(x) over the interval from x1 to x2.
Given the uniform distribution for flight time and using the interpretation of area as
probability, we can answer any number of probability questions about flight times. For
example, what is the probability of a flight time between 128 and 136 minutes? The width
of the interval is 136  128  8. With the uniform height of f(x)  1/20, we see that
P(128  x  136)  8(1/20)  .40.
Note that P(120  x  140)  20(1/20)  1; that is, the total area under the graph of
f(x) is equal to 1. This property holds for all continuous probability distributions and is the
analog of the condition that the sum of the probabilities must equal 1 for a discrete proba-
bility function. For a continuous probability density function, we must also require that
f(x)  0 for all values of x. This requirement is the analog of the requirement that f(x)  0
for discrete probability functions.
Two major differences stand out between the treatment of continuous random variables
and the treatment of their discrete counterparts.
1. We no longer talk about the probability of the random variable assuming a particu-
lar value. Instead, we talk about the probability of the random variable assuming a
value within some given interval.
2. The probability of a continuous random variable assuming a value within some
given interval from x1 to x2 is defined to be the area under the graph of the proba-
bility density function between x1 and x2. Because a single point is an interval of
zero width, this implies that the probability of a continuous random variable as-
suming any particular value exactly is zero. It also means that the probability of a
continuous random variable assuming a value in any interval is the same whether or 
not the endpoints are included.
The calculation of the expected value and variance for a continuous random variable is anal-
ogous to that for a discrete random variable. However, because the computational proce-
dure involves integral calculus, we leave the derivation of the appropriate formulas to more
advanced texts.
For the uniform continuous probability distribution introduced in this section, the for-
mulas for the expected value and variance are
In these formulas, a is the smallest value and b is the largest value that the random variable
may assume.
Applying these formulas to the uniform distribution for flight times from Chicago to
New York, we obtain
The standard deviation of flight times can be found by taking the square root of the vari-
ance. Thus, σ  5.77 minutes.

NOTES AND COMMENTS
To see more clearly why the height of a probability
density function is not a probability, think about a
random variable with the following uniform proba-
bility distribution.
f (x) 
2
0    for 0  x  .5
elsewhere
The height of the probability density function, f(x),
is 2 for values of x between 0 and .5. However, we
know probabilities can never be greater than 1.
Thus, we see that f(x) cannot be interpreted as the
probability of x.

Normal Probability Distribution
The most important probability distribution for describing a continuous random variable is
the normal probability distribution. The normal distribution has been used in a wide va-
riety of practical applications in which the random variables are heights and weights of
people, test scores, scientific measurements, amounts of rainfall, and other similar values.
It is also widely used in statistical inference, which is the major topic of the remainder of
this book. In such applications, the normal distribution provides a description of the likely
results obtained through sampling.
Normal Curve
The form, or shape, of the normal distribution is illustrated by the bell-shaped normal curve
in Figure 6.3. The probability density function that defines the bell-shaped curve of the nor-
mal distribution follows.
Abraham de Moivre, a
French mathematician,
published The Doctrine of
Chances in 1733. He
derived the normal
distribution.

We make several observations about the characteristics of the normal distribution.
1. The entire family of normal distributions is differentiated by two parameters: the
mean μ and the standard deviation σ.
2. The highest point on the normal curve is at the mean, which is also the median and
mode of the distribution.
3. The mean of the distribution can be any numerical value: negative, zero, or positive.
Three normal distributions with the same standard deviation but three different
means (10, 0, and 20) are shown here.
The normal curve has two
parameters, μ and σ. They
determine the location and
shape of the normal
distribution.

4. The normal distribution is symmetric, with the shape of the normal curve to the left
of the mean a mirror image of the shape of the normal curve to the right of the mean.
The tails of the normal curve extend to infinity in both directions and theoretically
never touch the horizontal axis. Because it is symmetric, the normal distribution is
not skewed; its skewness measure is zero.
5. The standard deviation determines how flat and wide the normal curve is. Larger
values of the standard deviation result in wider, flatter curves, showing more vari-
ability in the data. Two normal distributions with the same mean but with different
standard deviations are shown here.
6. Probabilities for the normal random variable are given by areas under the normal
curve. The total area under the curve for the normal distribution is 1. Because the
distribution is symmetric, the area under the curve to the left of the mean is .50 and
the area under the curve to the right of the mean is .50.
7. The percentage of values in some commonly used intervals are
a. 68.3% of the values of a normal random variable are within plus or minus one
standard deviation of its mean.
b. 95.4% of the values of a normal random variable are within plus or minus two
standard deviations of its mean.
c. 99.7% of the values of a normal random variable are within plus or minus three
standard deviations of its mean.
Figure 6.4 shows properties (a), (b), and (c) graphically.
Standard Normal Probability Distribution
A random variable that has a normal distribution with a mean of zero and a standard devi-
ation of one is said to have a standard normal probability distribution. The letter z is
commonly used to designate this particular normal random variable. Figure 6.5 is the graph
of the standard normal distribution. It has the same general appearance as other normal dis-
tributions, but with the special properties of μ  0 and σ  1.
These percentages are the
basis for the empirical rule
introduced in Section 3.3.

6.2
Normal Probability Distribution
241
As with other continuous random variables, probability calculations with any normal
distribution are made by computing areas under the graph of the probability density func-
tion. Thus, to find the probability that a normal random variable is within any specific 
interval, we must compute the area under the normal curve over that interval. 
For the standard normal distribution, areas under the normal curve have been computed
and are available in tables that can be used to compute probabilities. Such a table appears on
the two pages inside the front cover of the text. The table on the left-hand page contains areas,
or cumulative probabilities, for z values less than or equal to the mean of zero. The table on
the right-hand page contains areas, or cumulative probabilities, for z values greater than or
equal to the mean of zero.
Because μ  0 and σ  1, the formula for the standard normal probability density func-
tion is a simpler version of equation (6.2).

Chapter 6
Continuous Probability Distributions
The three types of probabilities we need to compute include (1) the probability that the
standard normal random variable z will be less than or equal to a given value; (2) the proba-
bility that z will be between two given values; and (3) the probability that z will be greater
than or equal to a given value. To see how the cumulative probability table for the standard
normal distribution can be used to compute these three types of probabilities, let us consider
some examples.
We start by showing how to compute the probability that z is less than or equal to 1.00;
that is, P(z  1.00). This cumulative probability is the area under the normal curve to the left
of z  1.00 in the following graph.
Because the standard
normal random variable is
continuous, P(z  1.00) 
P(z  1.00).
Refer to the right-hand page of the standard normal probability table inside the front
cover of the text. The cumulative probability corresponding to z  1.00 is the table value
located at the intersection of the row labeled 1.0 and the column labeled .00. First we find
1.0 in the left column of the table and then find .00 in the top row of the table. By look-
ing in the body of the table, we find that the 1.0 row and the .00 column intersect at the 
value of .8413; thus, P(z  1.00)  .8413. The following excerpt from the probability table
shows these steps.

To illustrate the second type of probability calculation, we show how to compute the
probability that z is in the interval between .50 and 1.25; that is, P(.50  z  1.25). The
following graph shows this area, or probability.

Normal Probability Distribution
243
Three steps are required to compute this probability. First, we find the area under the nor-
mal curve to the left of z  1.25. Second, we find the area under the normal curve to the left
of z  .50. Finally, we subtract the area to the left of z  .50 from the area to the left 
of z  1.25 to find P(.50  z  1.25).
To find the area under the normal curve to the left of z  1.25, we first locate the 1.2
row in the standard normal probability table and then move across to the .05 column. Be-
cause the table value in the 1.2 row and the .05 column is .8944, P(z  1.25)  .8944. Simi-
larly, to find the area under the curve to the left of z  .50, we use the left-hand page of
the table to locate the table value in the .5 row and the .00 column; with a table value of
.3085, P(z  .50)  .3085. Thus, P(.50  z  1.25)  P(z  1.25)  P(z  .50) 
.8944  .3085  .5859.
Let us consider another example of computing the probability that z is in the interval
between two given values. Often it is of interest to compute the probability that a nor-
mal random variable assumes a value within a certain number of standard deviations of 
the mean. Suppose we want to compute the probability that the standard normal ran-
dom variable is within one standard deviation of the mean; that is, P(1.00  z  1.00).
To compute this probability we must find the area under the curve between 1.00 
and 1.00. Earlier we found that P(z  1.00)  .8413. Referring again to the table inside 
the front cover of the book, we find that the area under the curve to the left of z  1.00
is .1587, so P(z  1.00)  .1587. Therefore, P(1.00  z  1.00)  P(z  1.00) 
P(z  1.00)  .8413  .1587  .6826. This probability is shown graphically in the
following figure.

Continuous Probability Distributions
To illustrate how to make the third type of probability computation, suppose we want to
compute the probability of obtaining a z value of at least 1.58; that is, P(z  1.58). The value
in the z  1.5 row and the .08 column of the cumulative normal table is .9429; thus, P(z 
1.58)  .9429. However, because the total area under the normal curve is 1, P(z  1.58) 

What is this z value?
In the preceding illustrations, we showed how to compute probabilities given specified
z values. In some situations, we are given a probability and are interested in working back-
ward to find the corresponding z value. Suppose we want to find a z value such that the
probability of obtaining a larger z value is .10. The following figure shows this situation
graphically.
This problem is the inverse of those in the preceding examples. Previously, we specified
the z value of interest and then found the corresponding probability, or area. In this example,
we are given the probability, or area, and asked to find the corresponding z value. To do so,
we use the standard normal probability table somewhat differently.
Recall that the standard normal probability table gives the area under the curve to the
left of a particular z value. We have been given the information that the area in the upper
tail of the curve is .10. Hence, the area under the curve to the left of the unknown z value
must equal .9000. Scanning the body of the table, we find .8997 is the cumulative proba-
bility value closest to .9000. The section of the table providing this result follows.
Given a probability, we can
use the standard normal
table in an inverse fashion
to find the corresponding z
value.

6.2
Normal Probability Distribution
245
Reading the z value from the leftmost column and the top row of the table, we find that
the corresponding z value is 1.28. Thus, an area of approximately .9000 (actually .8997)
will be to the left of z  1.28.2 In terms of the question originally asked, there is an ap-
proximately .10 probability of a z value larger than 1.28.
The examples illustrate that the table of cumulative probabilities for the standard normal
probability distribution can be used to find probabilities associated with values of the standard
normal random variable z. Two types of questions can be asked. The first type of question speci-
fies a value, or values, for z and asks us to use the table to determine the corresponding areas
or probabilities. The second type of question provides an area, or probability, and asks us to
use the table to determine the corresponding z value. Thus, we need to be flexible in using the
standard normal probability table to answer the desired probability question. In most cases,

area will help to visualize the situation and aid in determining the correct answer.
Computing Probabilities for Any Normal 
Probability Distribution
The reason for discussing the standard normal distribution so extensively is that probabili-
ties for all normal distributions are computed by using the standard normal distribution. 
That is, when we have a normal distribution with any mean μ and any standard deviation σ, 
we answer probability questions about the distribution by first converting to the standard
normal distribution. Then we can use the standard normal probability table and the appro-
priate z values to find the desired probabilities. The formula used to convert any normal ran-
dom variable x with mean μ and standard deviation σ to the standard normal random
variable z follows.

2 We could use interpolation in the body of the table to get a better approximation of the z value that corresponds to an area
of .9000. Doing so to provide one more decimal place of accuracy would yield a z value of 1.282. However, in most prac-
tical situations, sufficient accuracy is obtained by simply using the table value closest to the desired probability.

Chapter 6
Continuous Probability Distributions
A value of x equal to its mean μ results in z  (μ  μ)/σ  0. Thus, we see that a value
of x equal to its mean μ corresponds to z  0. Now suppose that x is one standard deviation
above its mean; that is, x  μ  σ. Applying equation (6.3), we see that the corresponding
z value is z  [(μ  σ)  μ]/σ  σ/σ  1. Thus, an x value that is one standard deviation
above its mean corresponds to z  1. In other words, we can interpret z as the number of
standard deviations that the normal random variable x is from its mean μ.
To see how this conversion enables us to compute probabilities for any normal distribu-
tion, suppose we have a normal distribution with μ  10 and σ  2. What is the probability
that the random variable x is between 10 and 14? Using equation (6.3), we see that at x  10,
z  (x  μ)/σ  (10  10)/2  0 and that at x  14, z  (14  10)/2  4/2  2. Thus, the
answer to our question about the probability of x being between 10 and 14 is given by the
equivalent probability that z is between 0 and 2 for the standard normal distribution. In other
words, the probability that we are seeking is the probability that the random variable x is be-
tween its mean and two standard deviations above the mean. Using z  2.00 and the stan-
dard normal probability table inside the front cover of the text, we see that P(z  2)  .9772.
Because P(z  0)  .5000, we can compute P(.00  z  2.00)  P(z  2)  P(z  0) 
.9772  .5000  .4772. Hence the probability that x is between 10 and 14 is .4772.
Grear Tire Company Problem
We turn now to an application of the normal probability distribution. Suppose the Grear Tire
Company developed a new steel-belted radial tire to be sold through a national chain of dis-
count stores. Because the tire is a new product, Grear’s managers believe that the mileage
guarantee offered with the tire will be an important factor in the acceptance of the product.
Before finalizing the tire mileage guarantee policy, Grear’s managers want probability in-
formation about x  number of miles the tires will last.
From actual road tests with the tires, Grear’s engineering group estimated that the mean
tire mileage is μ  36,500 miles and that the standard deviation is σ  5000. In addition,
the data collected indicate that a normal distribution is a reasonable assumption. What per-
centage of the tires can be expected to last more than 40,000 miles? In other words, what is
the probability that the tire mileage, x, will exceed 40,000? This question can be answered
by finding the area of the darkly shaded region in Figure 6.6.

Normal Probability Distribution

At x  40,000, we have
Refer now to the bottom of Figure 6.6. We see that a value of x  40,000 on the Grear
Tire normal distribution corresponds to a value of z  .70 on the standard normal distribu-
tion. Using the standard normal probability table, we see that the area under the standard
normal curve to the left of z  .70 is .7580. Thus, 1.000  .7580  .2420 is the probability
that z will exceed .70 and hence x will exceed 40,000. We can conclude that about 24.2%
of the tires will exceed 40,000 in mileage.
Let us now assume that Grear is considering a guarantee that will provide a discount on
replacement tires if the original tires do not provide the guaranteed mileage. What should
the guarantee mileage be if Grear wants no more than 10% of the tires to be eligible for the
discount guarantee? This question is interpreted graphically in Figure 6.7.
According to Figure 6.7, the area under the curve to the left of the unknown guarantee
mileage must be .10. So, we must first find the z value that cuts off an area of .10 in the left
tail of a standard normal distribution. Using the standard normal probability table, we see that
z  1.28 cuts off an area of .10 in the lower tail. Hence, z  1.28 is the value of the stan-
dard normal random variable corresponding to the desired mileage guarantee on the Grear
Tire normal distribution. To find the value of x corresponding to z  1.28, we have
With μ  36,500 and σ  5000,
Thus, a guarantee of 30,100 miles will meet the requirement that approximately 10%
of the tires will be eligible for the guarantee. Perhaps, with this information, the firm will
set its tire mileage guarantee at 30,000 miles.

Continuous Probability Distributions
Again, we see the important role that probability distributions play in providing decision-
making information. Namely, once a probability distribution is established for a particular ap-
plication, it can be used to obtain probability information about the problem. Probability does
not make a decision recommendation directly, but it provides information that helps the de-
cision maker better understand the risks and uncertainties associated with the problem. Ulti-
mately, this information may assist the decision maker in reaching a good decision.

Normal Approximation of Binomial
Probabilities
In Section 5.4 we presented the discrete binomial distribution. Recall that a binomial experi-
ment consists of a sequence of n identical independent trials with each trial having two pos-
sible outcomes, a success or a failure. The probability of a success on a trial is the same for
all trials and is denoted by p. The binomial random variable is the number of successes in the
n trials, and probability questions pertain to the probability of x successes in the n trials.

NORMAL APPROXIMATION TO A BINOMIAL PROBABILITY
DISTRIBUTION WITH n  100 AND p  .10 SHOWING THE PROBABILITY
OF 12 ERRORS
When the number of trials becomes large, evaluating the binomial probability function
by hand or with a calculator is difficult. In cases where np  5, and n(1  p)  5, the nor-
mal distribution provides an easy-to-use approximation of binomial probabilities. When
using the normal approximation to the binomial, we set μ  np and σ 
in the
definition of the normal curve. 
Let us illustrate the normal approximation to the binomial by supposing that a particu-
lar company has a history of making errors in 10% of its invoices. A sample of 100 in-
voices has been taken, and we want to compute the probability that 12 invoices contain
errors. That is, we want to find the binomial probability of 12 successes in 100 trials. In
applying the normal approximation in this case, we set μ  np  (100)(.1)  10 and σ 

A normal distribution with μ  10 and σ  3 is shown
in Figure 6.8.
Recall that, with a continuous probability distribution, probabilities are computed as
areas under the probability density function. As a result, the probability of any single value 
for the random variable is zero. Thus to approximate the binomial probability of 12 successes,
we compute the area under the corresponding normal curve between 11.5 and 12.5. The .5
that we add to and subtract from 12 is called a continuity correction factor. It is introduced
because a continuous distribution is being used to approximate a discrete distribution. Thus,
P(x  12) for the discrete binomial distribution is approximated by P(11.5  x  12.5) for
the continuous normal distribution.
Converting to the standard normal distribution to compute P(11.5  x  12.5), we have

Using the standard normal probability table, we find that the area under the curve (in 
Figure 6.8) to the left of 12.5 is .7967. Similarly, the area under the curve to the left of 11.5
is .6915. Therefore, the area between 11.5 and 12.5 is .7967  .6915  .1052. The normal
approximation to the probability of 12 successes in 100 trials is .1052.
For another illustration, suppose we want to compute the probability of 13 or fewer er-
rors in the sample of 100 invoices. Figure 6.9 shows the area under the normal curve that
approximates this probability. Note that the use of the continuity correction factor results in
the value of 13.5 being used to compute the desired probability. The z value corresponding
to x  13.5 is

bility of 13 or fewer errors is given by the shaded portion of the graph in Figure 6.9.

As an example of the exponential distribution, suppose that x represents the loading time
for a truck at the Schips loading dock and follows such a distribution. If the mean, or average,
loading time is 15 minutes (μ  15), the appropriate probability density function for x is
Figure 6.10 is the graph of this probability density function.
Computing Probabilities for the Exponential Distribution
As with any continuous probability distribution, the area under the curve corresponding to
an interval provides the probability that the random variable assumes a value in that
interval. In the Schips loading dock example, the probability that loading a truck will take
6 minutes or less P(x  6) is defined to be the area under the curve in Figure 6.10 from
x  0 to x  6. Similarly, the probability that the loading time will be 18 minutes or less
P(x  18) is the area under the curve from x  0 to x  18. Note also that the probability
that the loading time will be between 6 minutes and 18 minutes P(6  x  18) is given by
the area under the curve from x  6 to x  18.

Again using equation (6.5), we calculate the probability of loading a truck in 18 minutes or less.
Thus, the probability that loading a truck will take between 6 minutes and 18 minutes is equal
to .6988  .3297  .3691. Probabilities for any other interval can be computed similarly.
In the preceding example, the mean time it takes to load a truck is μ  15 minutes. A
property of the exponential distribution is that the mean of the distribution and the standard
deviation of the distribution are equal. Thus, the standard deviation for the time it takes to
load a truck is σ  15 minutes. The variance is σ2  (15)2  225.
Relationship Between the Poisson and Exponential
Distributions
In Section 5.5 we introduced the Poisson distribution as a discrete probability distribution
that is often useful in examining the number of occurrences of an event over a specified in-
terval of time or space. Recall that the Poisson probability function is
where
The continuous exponential probability distribution is related to the discrete Poisson distri-
bution. If the Poisson distribution provides an appropriate description of the number of oc-
currences per interval, the exponential distribution provides a description of the length of
the interval between occurrences.
To illustrate this relationship, suppose the number of cars that arrive at a car wash dur-
ing one hour is described by a Poisson probability distribution with a mean of 10 cars per
hour. The Poisson probability function that gives the probability of x arrivals per hour is
f(x)  10 xe10

expected value or mean number of
occurrences over a specified interval
f(x)  μxeμ
x!
P(x  18)  1  e18/15  .6988
A property of the
exponential distribution is
that the mean and standard
deviation are equal.
If arrivals follow a Poisson
distribution, the time
between arrivals must
follow an exponential
distribution.
For the Schips loading dock example, x  loading time in minutes and μ  15 minutes.
Using equation (6.5),
Hence, the probability that loading a truck will take 6 minutes or less is
P(x  6)  1  e6/15  .3297
P(x  x0)  1  ex0 15
To compute exponential probabilities such as those just described, we use the follow-
ing formula. It provides the cumulative probability of obtaining a value for the exponential
random variable of less than or equal to some specific value denoted by x0.

Summary
This chapter extended the discussion of probability distributions to the case of continuous
random variables. The major conceptual difference between discrete and continuous proba-
bility distributions involves the method of computing probabilities. With discrete distribu-
tions, the probability function f(x) provides the probability that the random variable x
assumes various values. With continuous distributions, the probability density function f(x)
does not provide probability values directly. Instead, probabilities are given by areas under

the curve or graph of the probability density function f(x). Because the area under the curve
above a single point is zero, we observe that the probability of any particular value is zero
for a continuous random variable.
Three continuous probability distributions—the uniform, normal, and exponential
distributions—were treated in detail. The normal distribution is used widely in statistical
inference and will be used extensively throughout the remainder of the text.
Glossary
Probability density function A function used to compute probabilities for a continuous
random variable. The area under the graph of a probability density function over an inter-
val represents probability.
Uniform probability distribution A continuous probability distribution for which the
probability that the random variable will assume a value in any interval is the same for each
interval of equal length.
Normal probability distribution A continuous probability distribution. Its probability
density function is bell-shaped and determined by its mean μ and standard deviation σ.
Standard normal probability distribution A normal distribution with a mean of zero and
a standard deviation of one.
Continuity correction factor A value of .5 that is added to or subtracted from a value of x
when the continuous normal distribution is used to approximate the discrete binomial
distribution.
Exponential probability distribution A continuous probability distribution that is useful
in computing probabilities for the time it takes to complete a task.

Case Problem Specialty Toys
Specialty Toys, Inc., sells a variety of new and innovative children’s toys. Management
learned that the preholiday season is the best time to introduce a new toy, because many
families use this time to look for new ideas for December holiday gifts. When Specialty dis-
covers a new toy with good market potential, it chooses an October market entry date.
In order to get toys in its stores by October, Specialty places one-time orders with its
manufacturers in June or July of each year. Demand for children’s toys can be highly volatile.
If a new toy catches on, a sense of shortage in the marketplace often increases the demand
to high levels and large profits can be realized. However, new toys can also flop, leaving 
Specialty stuck with high levels of inventory that must be sold at reduced prices. The most
important question the company faces is deciding how many units of a new toy should be
purchased to meet anticipated sales demand. If too few are purchased, sales will be lost; if too
many are purchased, profits will be reduced because of low prices realized in clearance sales.
For the coming season, Specialty plans to introduce a new product called Weather
Teddy. This variation of a talking teddy bear is made by a company in Taiwan. When a child
presses Teddy’s hand, the bear begins to talk. A built-in barometer selects one of five re-
sponses that predict the weather conditions. The responses range from “It looks to be a very
nice day! Have fun” to “I think it may rain today. Don’t forget your umbrella.” Tests with
the product show that, even though it is not a perfect weather predictor, its predictions are
surprisingly good. Several of Specialty’s managers claimed Teddy gave predictions of the
weather that were as good as many local television weather forecasters.
As with other products, Specialty faces the decision of how many Weather Teddy units
to order for the coming holiday season. Members of the management team suggested or-
der quantities of 15,000, 18,000, 24,000, or 28,000 units. The wide range of order quanti-
ties suggested indicates considerable disagreement concerning the market potential.
The product management team asks you for an analysis of the stock-out probabilities for
various order quantities, an estimate of the profit potential, and to help make an order quan-
tity recommendation. Specialty expects to sell Weather Teddy for $24 based on a cost of 
$16 per unit. If inventory remains after the holiday season, Specialty will sell all surplus in-
ventory for $5 per unit. After reviewing the sales history of similar products, Specialty’s se-
nior sales forecaster predicted an expected demand of 20,000 units with a .95 probability
that demand would be between 10,000 units and 30,000 units.
Managerial Report
Prepare a managerial report that addresses the following issues and recommends an order
quantity for the Weather Teddy product.
1. Use the sales forecaster’s prediction to describe a normal probability distribution
that can be used to approximate the demand distribution. Sketch the distribution and
show its mean and standard deviation.
2. Compute the probability of a stock-out for the order quantities suggested by mem-
bers of the management team.
3. Compute the projected profit for the order quantities suggested by the management
team under three scenarios: worst case in which sales  10,000 units, most likely
case in which sales  20,000 units, and best case in which sales  30,000 units.
4. One of Specialty’s managers felt that the profit potential was so great that the order
quantity should have a 70% chance of meeting demand and only a 30% chance of
any stock-outs. What quantity would be ordered under this policy, and what is the
projected profit under the three sales scenarios?
5. Provide your own recommendation for an order quantity and note the associated
profit projections. Provide a rationale for your recommendation.

Continuous Probability Distributions Using Excel

Appendix 6.1 Continuous Probability Distributions 
Using Minitab
Let us demonstrate the Minitab procedure for computing continuous probabilities by refer-
ring to the Grear Tire Company problem where tire mileage was described by a normal dis-
tribution with μ  36,500 and σ  5000. One question asked was, What is the probability
that the tire mileage will exceed 40,000 miles?
For continuous probability distributions, Minitab provides a cumulative probability;
that is, the probability that the random variable has a value less than or equal to a specified
constant. For the Grear tire mileage question, Minitab can be used to determine the cumu-
lative probability that the tire mileage will be less than or equal to 40,000 miles. After ob-
taining the cumulative probability, we can subtract it from 1 to determine the probability
that the tire mileage will exceed 40,000 miles.
Prior to using Minitab to compute a cumulative probability, we enter the specified con-
stant into a column of the worksheet. For the Grear tire mileage question we entered 40,000
into column C1. The steps in using Minitab to compute the cumulative probability of the
normal random variable having a value less than or equal to 40,000 follow.
Step 1. Select the Calc menu
Step 2. Choose Probability Distributions
Step 3. Choose Normal
Step 4. When the Normal Distribution dialog box appears:
Select Cumulative probability
Enter 36500 in the Mean box
Enter 5000 in the Standard deviation box
Enter C1 in the Input column box (the column containing 40,000)
Click OK
Minitab shows that this probability is .7580. Because we are interested in the probabil-
ity that the tire mileage will be greater than 40,000, the desired probability is 1  .7580 
.2420.
A second question in the Grear Tire Company problem was, What mileage guarantee
should Grear set to ensure that no more than 10% of the tires qualify for the guarantee? 
Here we are given a probability and want to find the corresponding value for the random vari-
able. Minitab uses an inverse calculation routine to find the value of the random variable asso-
ciated with a given cumulative probability. First, we enter the cumulative probability into a
column of the Minitab worksheet. In this case, the desired cumulative probability 
is .10. Then, the first three steps of the Minitab procedure are as shown previously. In step 4,
we select Inverse cumulative probability instead of Cumulative probability and complete
the remaining parts of the step. Minitab then displays the mileage guarantee of 30,092 miles.
Minitab can be used to compute probabilities for other continuous probability distribu-
tions, including the exponential probability distribution. To compute exponential probabili-
ties, follow the procedure shown previously for the normal probability distribution and
choose the Exponential option in step 3. Step 4 is as shown, with the exception that enter-
ing the standard deviation is not required. Output for cumulative probabilities and inverse cu-
mulative probabilities is identical to these described for the normal probability distribution.
Appendix 6.2 Continuous Probability Distributions 
Using Excel
Excel provides the capability for computing probabilities for several continuous probability
distributions, including the normal probability distributions. In this appendix, we describe

how Excel can be used to compute probabilities for any normal distribution. The procedures
for other continuous distributions are similar to the one we describe for the normal
distribution.
Let us return to the Grear Tire Company problem where the tire mileage was described
by a normal distribution with μ  36,500 and σ  5000. Assume we are interested in the
probability that tire mileage will exceed 40,000 miles.
Excel’s NORMDIST function provides cumulative probabilities for a normal distribu-
tion. The general form of the function is NORMDIST (x,μ,σ,cumulative). For the fourth 
argument, TRUE is specified if a cumulative probability is desired. Thus, to compute the
cumulative probability that the tire mileage will be less than or equal to 40,000 miles, we
would enter the following formula into any cell of an Excel worksheet:
At this point, .7580 will appear in the cell where the formula was entered, indicating that
the probability of tire mileage being less than or equal to 40,000 miles is .7580. Therefore,
the probability that tire mileage will exceed 40,000 miles is 1  .7580  .2420.
Excel’s NORMINV function uses an inverse computation to find the x value corre-
sponding to a given cumulative probability. For instance, suppose we want to find the guar-
anteed mileage Grear should offer so that no more than 10% of the tires will be eligible for
the guarantee. We would enter the following formula into any cell of an Excel worksheet:
At this point, 30092 will appear in the cell where the formula was entered, indicating that
the probability of a tire lasting 30,092 miles or less is .10.
The Excel function for computing exponential probabilities is EXPONDIST. This
function requires three arguments: x, the value of the variable; lamda, which is 1/,  and
TRUE if you would like the cumulative probability. For example, consider an exponential
probability distribution with mean   15. The probability that the exponential variable is
less than or equal to 6 can be computed by the Excel function 
EXPONDIST(6,1/15,TRUE). 
If you need help inserting functions in a worksheet, Excel’s Insert Function dialog box may
be used. See Appendix E in the back of the text.

Sampling and Sampling Distributions
MeadWestvaco Corporation, a leading producer of pack-
aging, coated and specialty papers, consumer and office
products, and specialty chemicals, employs more than
30,000 people. It operates worldwide in 29 countries and
serves customers located in approximately 100 countries.
MeadWestvaco holds a leading position in paper produc-
tion, with an annual capacity of 1.8 million tons. The
company’s products include textbook paper, glossy mag-
azine paper, beverage packaging systems, and office
products. MeadWestvaco’s internal consulting group uses
sampling to provide a variety of information that enables
the company to obtain significant productivity benefits
and remain competitive.
For example, MeadWestvaco maintains large wood-
land holdings, which supply the trees, or raw material,
for many of the company’s products. Managers need
reliable and accurate information about the timberlands
and forests to evaluate the company’s ability to meet its
future raw material needs. What is the present volume
in the forests? What is the past growth of the forests?
What is the projected future growth of the forests? With
answers to these important questions MeadWestvaco’s
managers can develop plans for the future, including long-
term planting and harvesting schedules for the trees.
How does MeadWestvaco obtain the information it
needs about its vast forest holdings? Data collected from
sample plots throughout the forests are the basis for
learning about the population of trees owned by the
company. To identify the sample plots, the timberland
holdings are first divided into three sections based on
location and types of trees. Using maps and random
numbers, MeadWestvaco analysts identify random sam-
ples of 1/5- to 1/7-acre plots in each section of the forest.
MeadWestvaco foresters collect data from these sample
plots to learn about the forest population.
Foresters throughout the organization participate
in the field data collection process. Periodically, two-
person teams gather information on each tree in every
sample plot. The sample data are entered into the
company’s continuous forest inventory (CFI) computer
system. Reports from the CFI system include a number
of frequency distribution summaries containing statis-
tics on types of trees, present forest volume, past forest
growth rates, and projected future forest growth and
volume. Sampling and the associated statistical sum-
maries of the sample data provide the reports essential
for the effective management of MeadWestvaco’s
forests and timberlands.
In this chapter you will learn about sampling and the
sample selection process. In addition, you will learn how
statistics such as the sample mean and sample proportion
are used to estimate the population mean and population
proportion. The important concept of a sampling distri-
bution is also introduced.

Statistics in Practice.
In Chapter 1 we presented the following definitions of an element, a population, and a sample.
•
An element is the entity on which data are collected.
•
A population is the collection of all the elements of interest.
•
A sample is a subset of the population.
The reason we select a sample is to collect data to make an inference and/or answer a
research question about a population.
Random sampling of its forest holdings enables
MeadWestvaco Corporation to meet future raw
material needs.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

Let us begin by citing two examples in which sampling was used to answer a research
question about a population.
1. Members of a political party in Texas were considering supporting a particular can-
didate for election to the U.S. Senate, and party leaders wanted to estimate the pro-
portion of registered voters in the state favoring the candidate. A sample of 400
registered voters in Texas was selected and 160 of the 400 voters indicated a pref-
erence for the candidate. Thus, an estimate of the proportion of the population of
registered voters favoring the candidate is 160/400  .40.
2. A tire manufacturer is considering producing a new tire designed to provide an
increase in mileage over the firm’s current line of tires. To estimate the mean useful
life of the new tires, the manufacturer produced a sample of 120 tires for testing. 
The test results provided a sample mean of 36,500 miles. Hence, an estimate of the
mean useful life for the population of new tires was 36,500 miles.
It is important to realize that sample results provide only estimates of the values of the cor-
responding population characteristics. We do not expect exactly .40, or 40%, of the popula-
tion of registered voters to favor the candidate, nor do we expect the sample mean of 36,500
miles to exactly equal the mean mileage for the population of all new tires produced. The rea-
son is simply that the sample contains only a portion of the population. Some sampling error
is to be expected. With proper sampling methods, the sample results will provide “good” es-
timates of the population parameters. But how good can we expect the sample results to be?
Fortunately, statistical procedures are available for answering this question.
Let us define some of the terms used in sampling. The sampled population is the
population from which the sample is drawn, and a frame is a list of the elements that the
sample will be selected from. In the first example, the sampled population is all registered
voters in Texas, and the frame is a list of all the registered voters. Because the number of
registered voters in Texas is a finite number, the first example is an illustration of sampling
from a finite population. In Section 7.2, we discuss how a simple random sample can be
selected when sampling from a finite population.
The sampled population for the tire mileage example is more difficult to define because the
sample of 120 tires was obtained from a production process at a particular point in time. We 
can think of the sampled population as the conceptual population of all the tires that could have
been made by the production process at that particular point in time. In this sense the sampled
population is considered infinite, making it impossible to construct a frame to draw the sample
from. In Section 7.2, we discuss how to select a random sample in such a situation.
In this chapter, we show how simple random sampling can be used to select a sample
from a finite population and describe how a random sample can be taken from an infinite
population that is generated by an ongoing process. We then show how data obtained from
a sample can be used to compute estimates of a population mean, a population standard de-
viation, and a population proportion. In addition, we introduce the important concept of a
sampling distribution. As we will show, knowledge of the appropriate sampling distribution
enables us to make statements about how close the sample estimates are to the correspond-
ing population parameters. The last section discusses some alternatives to simple random
sampling that are often employed in practice.
7.1
The Electronics Associates Sampling Problem
The director of personnel for Electronics Associates, Inc. (EAI) has been assigned the task
of developing a profile of the company’s 2500 managers. The characteristics to be identi-
fied include the mean annual salary for the managers and the proportion of managers hav-
ing completed the company’s management training program.
7.1
The Electronics Associates Sampling Problem

A sample mean provides an
estimate of a population
mean, and a sample
proportion provides an
estimate of a population
proportion. With estimates
such as these, some
estimation error can be
expected. This chapter
provides the basis for
determining how large that
error might be.

Using the 2500 managers as the population for this study, we can find the annual salary
and the training program status for each individual by referring to the firm’s personnel
records. The data set containing this information for all 2500 managers in the population is
in the file named EAI.
Using the EAI data and the formulas presented in Chapter 3, we compute the popula-
tion mean and the population standard deviation for the annual salary data.
The data for the training program status show that 1500 of the 2500 managers completed
the training program. 
Numerical characteristics of a population are called parameters. Letting p denote 
the proportion of the population that completed the training program, we see that
p  1500/2500  .60. The population mean annual salary ( μ  $51,800), the population
standard deviation of annual salary (σ  $4,000), and the population proportion that com-
pleted the training program (p  .60) are parameters of the population of EAI managers.
Now, suppose that the necessary information on all the EAI managers was not readily
available in the company’s database. The question we now consider is how the firm’s di-
rector of personnel can obtain estimates of the population parameters by using a sample of
managers rather than all 2500 managers in the population. Suppose that a sample of 30 man-
agers will be used. Clearly, the time and the cost of developing a profile would be substan-
tially less for 30 managers than for the entire population. If the personnel director could be
assured that a sample of 30 managers would provide adequate information about the popu-
lation of 2500 managers, working with a sample would be preferable to working with the
entire population. Let us explore the possibility of using a sample for the EAI study by first
considering how we can identify a sample of 30 managers.
7.2
Selecting a Sample
In this section we describe how to select a sample. We first describe how to sample from a
finite population and then describe how to select a sample from an infinite population.
Sampling from a Finite Population
Statisticians recommend selecting a probability sample when sampling from a finite popu-
lation because a probability sample allows them to make valid statistical inferences about
the population. The simplest type of probability sample is one in which each sample of size
n has the same probability of being selected. It is called a simple random sample. A simple
random sample of size n from a finite population of size N is defined as follows.
Population mean:  
Population standard deviation:  
μ  $51,800
σ  $4,000
268
Chapter 7
Sampling and Sampling Distributions
Usually the cost of
collecting information from
a sample is substantially
less than from a population,
especially when personal
interviews must be
conducted to collect the
information.
Computer-generated
random numbers can also
be used to implement the
random sample selection
process. Excel provides a
function for generating
random numbers in its
worksheets.
Other methods of
probability sampling are
described in Section 7.8
SIMPLE RANDOM SAMPLE (FINITE POPULATION)
Asimple random sample of size n from a finite population of size N is a sample selected
such that each possible sample of size n has the same probability of being selected.
One procedure for selecting a simple random sample from a finite population is to choose
the elements for the sample one at a time in such a way that, at each step, each of the elements
remaining in the population has the same probability of being selected. Sampling n elements
in this way will satisfy the definition of a simple random sample from a finite population.
To select a simple random sample from the finite population of EAI managers, we first
construct a frame by assigning each manager a number. For example, we can assign the

file. Next, we refer to the table of random numbers shown in Table 7.1. Using the first row of
the table, each digit, 6, 3, 2, . . . , is a random digit having an equal chance of occurring. Be-
cause the largest number in the population list of EAI managers, 2500, has four digits, we
will select random numbers from the table in sets or groups of four digits. Even though we
may start the selection of random numbers anywhere in the table and move systematically
in a direction of our choice, we will use the first row of Table 7.1 and move from left to right.
The first 7 four-digit random numbers are
Because the numbers in the table are random, these four-digit numbers are equally likely.
We can now use these four-digit random numbers to give each manager in the popula-
tion an equal chance of being included in the random sample. The first number, 6327, is
greater than 2500. It does not correspond to one of the numbered managers in the popula-
tion, and hence is discarded. The second number, 1599, is between 1 and 2500. Thus the
first manager selected for the random sample is number 1599 on the list of EAI managers.
Continuing this process, we ignore the numbers 8671 and 7445 before identifying managers
number 1102, 1514, and 1807 to be included in the random sample. This process continues
until the simple random sample of 30 EAI managers has been obtained.
In implementing this simple random sample selection process, it is possible that a ran-
dom number used previously may appear again in the table before the complete sample of
30 EAI managers has been selected. Because we do not want to select a manager more than
one time, any previously used random numbers are ignored because the corresponding man-
ager is already included in the sample. Selecting a sample in this manner is referred to as 
sampling without replacement. If we selected a sample such that previously used random

Care and judgment must be exercised in implementing the selection process for ob-
taining a random sample from an infinite population. Each case may require a different
selection procedure. Let us consider two examples to see what we mean by the conditions
(1) each element selected comes from the same population and (2) each element is se-
lected independently.
A common quality control application involves a production process where there is no
limit on the number of elements that can be produced. The conceptual population we are sam-
pling from is all the elements that could be produced (not just the ones that are produced) by
the ongoing production process. Because we cannot develop a list of all the elements that
could be produced, the population is considered infinite. To be more specific, let us consider a
production line designed to fill boxes of a breakfast cereal with a mean weight of 24 ounces of
breakfast cereal per box. Samples of 12 boxes filled by this process are periodically selected by
a quality control inspector to determine if the process is operating properly or if, perhaps, a 
machine malfunction has caused the process to begin underfilling or overfilling the boxes.
With a production operation such as this, the biggest concern in selecting a random sam-
ple is to make sure that condition 1, the sampled elements are selected from the same pop-
ulation, is satisfied. To ensure that this condition is satisfied, the boxes must be selected at
approximately the same point in time. This way the inspector avoids the possibility of se-
lecting some boxes when the process is operating properly and other boxes when the
process is not operating properly and is underfilling or overfilling the boxes. With a pro-
duction process such as this, the second condition, each element is selected independently,
is satisfied by designing the production process so that each box of cereal is filled inde-
pendently. With this assumption, the quality control inspector only needs to worry about
satisfying the same population condition.
As another example of selecting a random sample from an infinite population, consider
the population of customers arriving at a fast-food restaurant. Suppose an employee is asked
to select and interview a sample of customers in order to develop a profile of customers who
visit the restaurant. The customer arrival process is ongoing and there is no way to obtain a
list of all customers in the population. So, for practical purposes, the population for this 
270
Chapter 7
Sampling and Sampling Distributions
numbers are acceptable and specific managers could be included in the sample two or more
times, we would be sampling with replacement. Sampling with replacement is a valid way
of identifying a simple random sample. However, sampling without replacement is the sam-
pling procedure used most often. When we refer to simple random sampling, we will 
assume the sampling is without replacement.
Sampling from an Infinite Population
Sometimes we want to select a sample from a population, but the population is infinitely
large or the elements of the population are being generated by an ongoing process for
which there is no limit on the number of elements that can be generated. Thus, it is not
possible to develop a list of all the elements in the population. This is considered the infi-
nite population case. With an infinite population, we cannot select a simple random sam-
ple because we cannot construct a frame consisting of all the elements. In the infinite
population case, statisticians recommend selecting what is called a random sample.
RANDOM SAMPLE (INFINITE POPULATION)
A random sample of size n from an infinite population is a sample selected such that
the following conditions are satisfied.
1. Each element selected comes from the same population.
2. Each element is selected independently.

ongoing process is considered infinite. As long as a sampling procedure is designed so that all
the elements in the sample are customers of the restaurant and they are selected independently,
a random sample will be obtained. In this case, the employee collecting the sample needs to
select the sample from people who come into the restaurant and make a purchase to ensure
that the same population condition is satisfied. If, for instance, the employee selected some-
one for the sample who came into the restaurant just to use the restroom, that person would
not be a customer and the same population condition would be violated. So, as long as the in-
terviewer selects the sample from people making a purchase at the restaurant, condition 1 is
satisfied. Ensuring that the customers are selected independently can be more difficult.
The purpose of the second condition of the random sample selection procedure (each
element is selected independently) is to prevent selection bias. In this case, selection bias
would occur if the interviewer were free to select customers for the sample arbitrarily. The
interviewer might feel more comfortable selecting customers in a particular age group and
might avoid customers in other age groups. Selection bias would also occur if the inter-
viewer selected a group of five customers who entered the restaurant together and asked all
of them to participate in the sample. Such a group of customers would be likely to exhibit
similar characteristics, which might provide misleading information about the population
of customers. Selection bias such as this can be avoided by ensuring that the selection of a
particular customer does not influence the selection of any other customer. In other words,
the elements (customers) are selected independently.
McDonald’s, the fast-food restaurant leader, implemented a random sampling proce-
dure for this situation. The sampling procedure was based on the fact that some customers
presented discount coupons. Whenever a customer presented a discount coupon, the next
customer served was asked to complete a customer profile questionnaire. Because arriving
customers presented discount coupons randomly and independently of other customers, this
sampling procedure ensured that customers were selected independently. As a result, the
sample satisfied the requirements of a random sample from an infinite population.
Situations involving sampling from an infinite population are usually associated with a
process that operates over time. Examples include parts being manufactured on a production
line, repeated experimental trials in a laboratory, transactions occurring at a bank, telephone
calls arriving at a technical support center, and customers entering a retail store. In each case,
the situation may be viewed as a process that generates elements from an infinite population.
As long as the sampled elements are selected from the same population and are selected in-
dependently, the sample is considered a random sample from an infinite population.

NOTES AND COMMENTS
1. In this section we have been careful to define
two types of samples: a simple random sample
from a finite population and a random sample
from an infinite population. In the remainder of
the text, we will generally refer to both of these
as either a random sample or simply a sample.
We will not make a distinction of the sample be-
ing a “simple” random sample unless it is nec-
essary for the exercise or discussion.
2. Statisticians who specialize in sample surveys
from finite populations use sampling methods
that provide probability samples. With a proba-
bility sample, each possible sample has a known
probability of selection and a random process is
used to select the elements for the sample. Sim-
ple random sampling is one of these methods. In
Section 7.8, we describe some other probability
sampling methods: stratified random sampling,
cluster sampling, and systematic sampling. We
use the term simple in simple random sampling
to clarify that this is the probability sampling
method that assures each sample of size n has
the same probability of being selected.
3. The number of different simple random samples
of size n that can be selected from a finite popu-
lation of size N is
In this formula, N! and n! are the factorial
formulas discussed in Chapter 4. For the EAI

Point Estimation
Now that we have described how to select a simple random sample, let us return to the EAI
problem. A simple random sample of 30 managers and the corresponding data on annual
salary and management training program participation are as shown in Table 7.2. The nota-
tion x1, x2, and so on is used to denote the annual salary of the first manager in the sample, the
annual salary of the second manager in the sample, and so on. Participation in the manage-
ment training program is indicated by Yes in the management training program column.
To estimate the value of a population parameter, we compute a corresponding charac-
teristic of the sample, referred to as a sample statistic. For example, to estimate the popu-
lation mean μ and the population standard deviation σ for the annual salary of EAI
managers, we use the data in Table 7.2 to calculate the corresponding sample statistics: the

sample mean and the sample standard deviation s. Using the formulas for a sample mean
and a sample standard deviation presented in Chapter 3, the sample mean is
and the sample standard deviation is
To estimate p, the proportion of managers in the population who completed the manage-
ment training program, we use the corresponding sample proportion . Let x denote the num-
ber of managers in the sample who completed the management training program. The data in
Table 7.2 show that x  19. Thus, with a sample size of n  30, the sample proportion is
By making the preceding computations, we perform the statistical procedure called point
estimation. We refer to the sample mean as the point estimator of the population mean μ,
the sample standard deviation s as the point estimator of the population standard deviation σ,
and the sample proportion 
as the point estimator of the population proportion p. The nu-
merical value obtained for , s, or is called the point estimate. Thus, for the simple random
sample of 30 EAI managers shown in Table 7.2, $51,814 is the point estimate of μ, $3,348 is
the point estimate of σ, and .63 is the point estimate of p. Table 7.3 summarizes the sample
results and compares the point estimates to the actual values of the population parameters.
As is evident from Table 7.3, the point estimates differ somewhat from the corre-
sponding population parameters. This difference is to be expected because a sample, and
not a census of the entire population, is being used to develop the point estimates. In the
next chapter, we will show how to construct an interval estimate in order to provide infor-
mation about how close the point estimate is to the population parameter.

Practical Advice
The subject matter of most of the rest of the book is concerned with statistical inference.
Point estimation is a form of statistical inference. We use a sample statistic to make an 
inference about a population parameter. When making inferences about a population
based on a sample, it is important to have a close correspondence between the sampled
population and the target population. The target population is the population we want to
make inferences about, while the sampled population is the population from which the
sample is actually taken. In this section, we have described the process of drawing a sim-
ple random sample from the population of EAI managers and making point estimates of
characteristics of that same population. So the sampled population and the target popula-
tion are identical, which is the desired situation. But in other cases, it is not as easy to 
obtain a close correspondence between the sampled and target populations.
Consider the case of an amusement park selecting a sample of its customers to learn about
characteristics such as age and time spent at the park. Suppose all the sample elements were se-
lected on a day when park attendance was restricted to employees of a large company. Then the
sampled population would be composed of employees of that company and members of their
families. If the target population we wanted to make inferences about were typical park cus-
tomers over a typical summer, then we might encounter a significant difference between the
sampled population and the target population. In such a case, we would question the validity of
the point estimates being made. Park management would be in the best position to know whether
a sample taken on a particular day was likely to be representative of the target population.
In summary, whenever a sample is used to make inferences about a population, we
should make sure that the study is designed so that the sampled population and the target
population are in close agreement. Good judgment is a necessary ingredient of sound sta-
tistical practice.

Note that different values of and were obtained. Indeed, a second simple random sample
of 30 EAI managers cannot be expected to provide the same point estimates as the first sample.
Now, suppose we repeat the process of selecting a simple random sample of 30 EAI
managers over and over again, each time computing the values of and . Table 7.4 con-
tains a portion of the results obtained for 500 simple random samples, and Table 7.5 shows
the frequency and relative frequency distributions for the 500 values. Figure 7.1 shows the
relative frequency histogram for the values.
In Chapter 5 we defined a random variable as a numerical description of the outcome
of an experiment. If we consider the process of selecting a simple random sample as an
experiment, the sample mean is the numerical description of the outcome of the experi-
ment. Thus, the sample mean is a random variable. As a result, just like other random vari-
ables, has a mean or expected value, a standard deviation, and a probability distribution.
Because the various possible values of are the result of different simple random samples,
the probability distribution of is called the sampling distribution of . Knowledge of this
sampling distribution and its properties will enable us to make probability statements about
how close the sample mean is to the population mean μ.
Let us return to Figure 7.1. We would need to enumerate every possible sample of 
30 managers and compute each sample mean to completely determine the sampling dis-
tribution of . However, the histogram of 500 
values gives an approximation of this
sampling distribution. From the approximation we observe the bell-shaped appearance of

In practice, we select only one simple random sample from the population. We repeated
the sampling process 500 times in this section simply to illustrate that many different samples
are possible and that the different samples generate a variety of values for the sample statistics
and . The probability distribution of any particular sample statistic is called the sampling
distribution of the statistic. In Section 7.5 we show the characteristics of the sampling distribu-
tion of . In Section 7.6 we show the characteristics of the sampling distribution of .

This section describes the properties of the sampling distribution of . Just as with other
probability distributions we studied, the sampling distribution of has an expected value or
mean, a standard deviation, and a characteristic shape or form. Let us begin by considering
the mean of all possible values, which is referred to as the expected value of .
Expected Value of 
In the EAI sampling problem we saw that different simple random samples result in a vari-
ety of values for the sample mean . Because many different values of the random variable
are possible, we are often interested in the mean of all possible values of that can be gen-
erated by the various simple random samples. The mean of the 
random variable is the
expected value of . Let E( ) represent the expected value of and μ represent the mean of
the population from which we are selecting a simple random sample. It can be shown that
with simple random sampling, E( ) and μ are equal.

Chapter 7
Sampling and Sampling Distributions
This result shows that with simple random sampling, the expected value or mean of the sam-
pling distribution of is equal to the mean of the population. In Section 7.1 we saw that the
mean annual salary for the population of EAI managers is μ  $51,800. Thus, according to
equation (7.1), the mean of all possible sample means for the EAI study is also $51,800.
When the expected value of a point estimator equals the population parameter, we say
the point estimator is unbiased. Thus, equation (7.1) shows that is an unbiased estimator
of the population mean μ.
Standard Deviation of 
Let us define the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of . We will use the fol-
lowing notation.
It can be shown that the formula for the standard deviation of depends on whether the pop-
ulation is finite or infinite. The two formulas for the standard deviation of follow.

In comparing the two formulas in (7.2), we see that the factor 
is required
for the finite population case but not for the infinite population case. This factor is commonly 
referred to as the finite population correction factor. In many practical sampling situations,
we find that the population involved, although finite, is “large,” whereas the sample size is 
relatively “small.” In such cases the finite population correction factor 
is close to 1. As a result, the difference between the values of the standard deviation of for
the finite and infinite population cases becomes negligible. Then, 
becomes a
good approximation to the standard deviation of even though the population is finite. This
observation leads to the following general guideline, or rule of thumb, for computing the
standard deviation of .x¯

Sampling Distribution of x_
281
CENTRAL LIMIT THEOREM
In selecting random samples of size n from a population, the sampling distribution of
the sample mean can be approximated by a normal distribution as the sample size
becomes large.
x¯
The term standard error is
used throughout statistical
inference to refer to the
standard deviation of a
point estimator.
Figure 7.3 shows how the central limit theorem works for three different populations;
each column refers to one of the populations. The top panel of the figure shows that none of
the populations are normally distributed. Population I follows a uniform distribution. 
Population II is often called the rabbit-eared distribution. It is symmetric, but the more likely
values fall in the tails of the distribution. Population III is shaped like the exponential dis-
tribution; it is skewed to the right.
The bottom three panels of Figure 7.3 show the shape of the sampling distribution for
samples of size n  2, n  5, and n  30. When the sample size is 2, we see that the shape
of each sampling distribution is different from the shape of the corresponding population
In cases where n/N  .05, the finite population version of formula (7.2) should be used in
the computation of 
. Unless otherwise noted, throughout the text we will assume that the
σx¯
population size is “large,” n/N  .05, and expression (7.3) can be used to compute 
.
To compute 
, we need to know σ, the standard deviation of the population. To further
emphasize the difference between 
and σ, we refer to the standard deviation of , 
, as
the standard error of the mean. In general, the term standard error refers to the standard
deviation of a point estimator. Later we will see that the value of the standard error of the
mean is helpful in determining how far the sample mean may be from the population mean.
Let us now return to the EAI example and compute the standard error of the mean associ-
ated with simple random samples of 30 EAI managers.
In Section 7.1 we saw that the standard deviation of annual salary for the population of
2500 EAI managers is σ  4000. In this case, the population is finite, with N  2500. How-
ever, with a sample size of 30, we have n/N  30/2500  .012. Because the sample size is
less than 5% of the population size, we can ignore the finite population correction factor
and use equation (7.3) to compute the standard error.
Form of the Sampling Distribution of 
The preceding results concerning the expected value and standard deviation for the sam-
pling distribution of
are applicable for any population. The final step in identifying the
characteristics of the sampling distribution of
is to determine the form or shape of the
sampling distribution. We will consider two cases: (1) The population has a normal distrib-
ution; and (2) the population does not have a normal distribution.
Population has a normal distribution. In many situations it is reasonable to assume
that the population from which we are selecting a random sample has a normal, or nearly
normal, distribution. When the population has a normal distribution, the sampling distrib-
ution of is normally distributed for any sample size.
Population does not have a normal distribution. When the population from which
we are selecting a random sample does not have a normal distribution, the central limit
theorem is helpful in identifying the shape of the sampling distribution of . A statement
of the central limit theorem as it applies to the sampling distribution of follows.

distribution. For samples of size 5, we see that the shapes of the sampling distributions for
populations I and II begin to look similar to the shape of a normal distribution. Even though
the shape of the sampling distribution for population III begins to look similar to the shape
of a normal distribution, some skewness to the right is still present. Finally, for samples of
size 30, the shapes of each of the three sampling distributions are approximately normal.
From a practitioner standpoint, we often want to know how large the sample size needs
to be before the central limit theorem applies and we can assume that the shape of the sam-
pling distribution is approximately normal. Statistical researchers have investigated this
question by studying the sampling distribution of
for a variety of populations and a vari-
ety of sample sizes. General statistical practice is to assume that, for most applications, the
sampling distribution of
can be approximated by a normal distribution whenever the sample

is size 30 or more. In cases where the population is highly skewed or outliers are present,
samples of size 50 may be needed. Finally, if the population is discrete, the sample size
needed for a normal approximation often depends on the population proportion. We say
more about this issue when we discuss the sampling distribution of 
in Section 7.6.
Sampling Distribution of 
for the EAI Problem
Let us return to the EAI problem where we previously showed that E( )  $51,800 and 
 730.3. At this point, we do not have any information about the population distribution;
it may or may not be normally distributed. If the population has a normal distribution, the
sampling distribution of 
is normally distributed. If the population does not have a nor-
mal distribution, the simple random sample of 30 managers and the central limit theorem
enable us to conclude that the sampling distribution of can be approximated by a normal
distribution. In either case, we are comfortable proceeding with the conclusion that the sam-
pling distribution of can be described by the normal distribution shown in Figure 7.4.
Practical Value of the Sampling Distribution of 
Whenever a simple random sample is selected and the value of the sample mean is used to es-
timate the value of the population mean μ, we cannot expect the sample mean to exactly equal
the population mean. The practical reason we are interested in the sampling distribution of 
is that it can be used to provide probability information about the difference between the sam-
ple mean and the population mean. To demonstrate this use, let us return to the EAI problem.
Suppose the personnel director believes the sample mean will be an acceptable estimate
of the population mean if the sample mean is within $500 of the population mean. How-
ever, it is not possible to guarantee that the sample mean will be within $500 of the popu-
lation mean. Indeed, Table 7.5 and Figure 7.1 show that some of the 500 sample means
differed by more than $2,000 from the population mean. So we must think of the personnel
director’s request in probability terms. That is, the personnel director is concerned with the
following question: What is the probability that the sample mean computed using a simple
random sample of 30 EAI managers will be within $500 of the population mean?

Chapter 7
Sampling and Sampling Distributions
Because we have identified the properties of the sampling distribution of 
(see Fig-
ure 7.4), we will use this distribution to answer the probability question. Refer to the sampling
distribution of shown again in Figure 7.5. With a population mean of $51,800, the personnel
director wants to know the probability that is between $51,300 and $52,300. This probabil-
ity is given by the darkly shaded area of the sampling distribution shown in Figure 7.5. Because
the sampling distribution is normally distributed, with mean 51,800 and standard error of the
mean 730.3, we can use the standard normal probability table to find the area or probability.
We first calculate the z value at the upper endpoint of the interval (52,300) and use the
table to find the area under the curve to the left of that point (left tail area). Then we compute
the z value at the lower endpoint of the interval (51,300) and use the table to find the area un-
der the curve to the left of that point (another left tail area). Subtracting the second tail area
from the first gives us the desired probability.
At  52,300, we have
Referring to the standard normal probability table, we find a cumulative probability (area
to the left of z  .68) of .7517.
At  51,300, we have
The area under the curve to the left of z  .68 is .2483. Therefore, P(51,300 

52,300)  P(z  .68)  P(z  .68)  .7517  .2483  .5034.
The preceding computations show that a simple random sample of 30 EAI managers
has a .5034 probability of providing a sample mean that is within $500 of the population
mean. Thus, there is a 1  .5034  .4966 probability that the difference between 
and
will be more than $500. In other words, a simple random sample of 30 EAI
managers has roughly a 50/50 chance of providing a sample mean within the allowable

$500. Perhaps a larger sample size should be considered. Let us explore this possibility by
considering the relationship between the sample size and the sampling distribution of .
Relationship Between the Sample Size and the Sampling
Distribution of 
Suppose that in the EAI sampling problem we select a simple random sample of 100 EAI man-
agers instead of the 30 originally considered. Intuitively, it would seem that with more data pro-
vided by the larger sample size, the sample mean based on n  100 should provide a better
estimate of the population mean than the sample mean based on n  30. To see how much bet-
ter, let us consider the relationship between the sample size and the sampling distribution of .
First note that E( )  μ regardless of the sample size. Thus, the mean of all possible val-
ues of
is equal to the population mean μ regardless of the sample size n. However, note
that the standard error of the mean,
, is related to the square root of the sample
size. Whenever the sample size is increased, the standard error of the mean 
decreases.

With n  30, the standard error of the mean for the EAI problem is 730.3. However, with
the increase in the sample size to n  100, the standard error of the mean is decreased to
The sampling distributions of with n  30 and n  100 are shown in Figure 7.6. Because
the sampling distribution with n  100 has a smaller standard error, the values of 
have
less variation and tend to be closer to the population mean than the values of with n  30.
We can use the sampling distribution of 
for the case with n  100 to compute the
probability that a simple random sample of 100 EAI managers will provide a sample mean
that is within $500 of the population mean. Because the sampling distribution is normal,
with mean 51,800 and standard error of the mean 400, we can use the standard normal prob-
ability table to find the area or probability.

Sampling and Sampling Distributions
NOTES AND COMMENTS
1. In presenting the sampling distribution of 
for
the EAI problem, we took advantage of the fact
that the population mean μ  51,800 and the
population standard deviation σ  4000 were
known. However, usually the values of the
population mean μ and the population standard
deviation σ that are needed to determine the
sampling distribution of 
will be unknown. In
Chapter 8 we will show how the sample mean 
and the sample standard deviation s are used
when μ and σ are unknown.

2. The theoretical proof of the central limit theo-
rem requires independent observations in the
sample. This condition is met for infinite popu-
lations and for finite populations where sam-
pling is done with replacement. Although the
central limit theorem does not directly address
sampling without replacement from finite popu-
lations, general statistical practice applies the
findings of the central limit theorem when the
population size is large.
Referring to the standard normal probability table, we find a cumulative probability corre-
sponding to z  1.25 of .8944.
At  51,300, we have
The cumulative probability corresponding to z  1.25 is .1056. Therefore, P(51,300  
 52,300)  P(z  1.25)  P(z  1.25)  .8944  .1056  .7888. Thus, by increasing
the sample size from 30 to 100 EAI managers, we increase the probability of obtaining a
sample mean within $500 of the population mean from .5034 to .7888.
The important point in this discussion is that as the sample size is increased, the stan-
dard error of the mean decreases. As a result, the larger sample size provides a higher proba-

Comparing the two formulas in (7.5), we see that the only difference is the use of the finite
population correction factor 
As was the case with the sample mean , the difference between the expressions for the
finite population and the infinite population becomes negligible if the size of the finite popu-
lation is large in comparison to the sample size. We follow the same rule of thumb that we
recommended for the sample mean. That is, if the population is finite with n/N  .05, we 
will use 
. However, if the population is finite with n/N  .05, the fi-
nite population correction factor should be used. Again, unless specifically noted, through-
out the text we will assume that the population size is large in relation to the sample size
and thus the finite population correction factor is unnecessary.
In Section 7.5 we used the term standard error of the mean to refer to the standard devi-
ation of . We stated that in general the term standard error refers to the standard deviation
of a point estimator. Thus, for proportions we use standard error of the proportion to refer to
the standard deviation of
. Let us now return to the EAI example and compute the standard
error of the proportion associated with simple random samples of 30 EAI managers.
For the EAI study we know that the population proportion of managers who participated
in the management training program is p  .60. With n/N  30/2500  .012, we can ig-
nore the finite population correction factor when we compute the standard error of the pro-
portion. For the simple random sample of 30 managers,

Sampling Distribution of p_

Form of the Sampling Distribution of 
Now that we know the mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution of , the
final step is to determine the form or shape of the sampling distribution. The sample pro-
portion is 
 x/n. For a simple random sample from a large population, the value of x is a
binomial random variable indicating the number of elements in the sample with the char-
acteristic of interest. Because n is a constant, the probability of x/n is the same as the 
binomial probability of x, which means that the sampling distribution of is also a discrete
probability distribution and that the probability for each value of x/n is the same as the
probability of x.
In Chapter 6 we also showed that a binomial distribution can be approximated by a
normal distribution whenever the sample size is large enough to satisfy the following two
conditions:
Assuming these two conditions are satisfied, the probability distribution of x in the sample
proportion,  x/n, can be approximated by a normal distribution. And because n is a con-
stant, the sampling distribution of can also be approximated by a normal distribution. This
approximation is stated as follows.

The sampling distribution of 
can be approximated by a normal distribution when-
ever np 	 5 and n(1  p) 	 5.
p¯
In practical applications, when an estimate of a population proportion is desired, we find
that sample sizes are almost always large enough to permit the use of a normal approxima-
tion for the sampling distribution of .
Recall that for the EAI sampling problem we know that the population proportion of
managers who participated in the training program is p  .60. With a simple random sample
of size 30, we have np  30(.60)  18 and n(1  p)  30(.40)  12. Thus, the sampling
distribution of can be approximated by a normal distribution shown in Figure 7.8.
Practical Value of the Sampling Distribution of 
The practical value of the sampling distribution of is that it can be used to provide proba-
bility information about the difference between the sample proportion and the population
proportion. For instance, suppose that in the EAI problem the personnel director wants to
know the probability of obtaining a value of that is within .05 of the population propor-
tion of EAI managers who participated in the training program. That is, what is the proba-
bility of obtaining a sample with a sample proportion 
between .55 and .65? The darkly
shaded area in Figure 7.9 shows this probability. Using the fact that the sampling distribu-
tion of can be approximated by a normal distribution with a mean of .60 and a standard
error of the proportion of 
 .0894, we find that the standard normal random variable

corresponding to  .65 has a value of z  (.65  .60)/.0894  .56. Referring to the stan-

z  .56 is .7123. Similarly, at 
 .55, we find z  (.55  .60)/.0894  .56. From the
standard normal probability table, we find the cumulative probability corresponding to
z  .56 is .2877. Thus, the probability of selecting a sample that provides a sample pro-
portion within .05 of the population proportion p is given by .7123  .2877  .4246.

Other Sampling Methods
We described simple random sampling as a procedure for sampling from a finite popula-
tion and discussed the properties of the sampling distributions of and when simple ran-
dom sampling is used. Other methods such as stratified random sampling, cluster sampling,
and systematic sampling provide advantages over simple random sampling in some of these
situations. In this section we briefly introduce these alternative sampling methods. 
Stratified Random Sampling
In stratified random sampling, the elements in the population are first divided into groups
called strata, such that each element in the population belongs to one and only one stratum.
The basis for forming the strata, such as department, location, age, industry type, and so on,
is at the discretion of the designer of the sample. However, the best results are obtained
when the elements within each stratum are as much alike as possible. Figure 7.10 is a dia-
gram of a population divided into H strata.
After the strata are formed, a simple random sample is taken from each stratum. For-
mulas are available for combining the results for the individual stratum samples into one
estimate of the population parameter of interest. The value of stratified random sampling
depends on how homogeneous the elements are within the strata. If elements within strata
are alike, the strata will have low variances. Thus relatively small sample sizes can be 
used to obtain good estimates of the strata characteristics. If strata are homogeneous, the
stratified random sampling procedure provides results just as precise as those of simple
random sampling by using a smaller total sample size.
Cluster Sampling
In cluster sampling, the elements in the population are first divided into separate groups
called clusters. Each element of the population belongs to one and only one cluster (see
Figure 7.11).Asimple random sample of the clusters is then taken.All elements within each
sampled cluster form the sample. Cluster sampling tends to provide the best results when
the elements within the clusters are not alike. In the ideal case, each cluster is a represen-
tative small-scale version of the entire population. The value of cluster sampling depends
on how representative each cluster is of the entire population. If all clusters are alike in this
regard, sampling a small number of clusters will provide good estimates of the population
parameters.
One of the primary applications of cluster sampling is area sampling, where clusters are
city blocks or other well-defined areas. Cluster sampling generally requires a larger total

Sampling and Sampling Distributions
sample size than either simple random sampling or stratified random sampling. However, it
can result in cost savings because of the fact that when an interviewer is sent to a sampled
cluster (e.g., a city-block location), many sample observations can be obtained in a relatively
short time. Hence, a larger sample size may be obtainable with a significantly lower total cost.
Systematic Sampling
In some sampling situations, especially those with large populations, it is time-consuming
to select a simple random sample by first finding a random number and then counting or 
searching through the list of the population until the corresponding element is found. An
alternative to simple random sampling is systematic sampling. For example, if a sam-
ple size of 50 is desired from a population containing 5000 elements, we will sample one
element for every 5000/50  100 elements in the population. A systematic sample for
this case involves selecting randomly one of the first 100 elements from the population
list. Other sample elements are identified by starting with the first sampled element and
then selecting every 100th element that follows in the population list. In effect, the sam-
ple of 50 is identified by moving systematically through the population and identifying
every 100th element after the first randomly selected element. The sample of 50 usually
will be easier to identify in this way than it would be if simple random sampling were
used. Because the first element selected is a random choice, a systematic sample is usu-
ally assumed to have the properties of a simple random sample. This assumption is 
especially applicable when the list of elements in the population is a random ordering
of the elements.
Convenience Sampling
The sampling methods discussed thus far are referred to as probability sampling techniques.
Elements selected from the population have a known probability of being included in the
sample. The advantage of probability sampling is that the sampling distribution of the
appropriate sample statistic generally can be identified. Formulas such as the ones for sim-
ple random sampling presented in this chapter can be used to determine the properties of
the sampling distribution. Then the sampling distribution can be used to make probability
statements about the error associated with using the sample results to make inferences about
the population.
Convenience sampling is a nonprobability sampling technique. As the name implies,
the sample is identified primarily by convenience. Elements are included in the sample
without prespecified or known probabilities of being selected. For example, a professor
conducting research at a university may use student volunteers to constitute a sample sim-
ply because they are readily available and will participate as subjects for little or no cost.

Summary
297
Similarly, an inspector may sample a shipment of oranges by selecting oranges haphazardly
from among several crates. Labeling each orange and using a probability method of sam-
pling would be impractical. Samples such as wildlife captures and volunteer panels for
consumer research are also convenience samples.
Convenience samples have the advantage of relatively easy sample selection and data
collection; however, it is impossible to evaluate the “goodness” of the sample in terms of
its representativeness of the population. A convenience sample may provide good results or
it may not; no statistically justified procedure allows a probability analysis and inference
about the quality of the sample results. Sometimes researchers apply statistical methods
designed for probability samples to a convenience sample, arguing that the convenience
sample can be treated as though it were a probability sample. However, this argument
cannot be supported, and we should be cautious in interpreting the results of convenience
samples that are used to make inferences about populations.
Judgment Sampling
One additional nonprobability sampling technique is judgment sampling. In this approach,
the person most knowledgeable on the subject of the study selects elements of the popula-
tion that he or she feels are most representative of the population. Often this method is a rel-
atively easy way of selecting a sample. For example, a reporter may sample two or three
senators, judging that those senators reflect the general opinion of all senators. However,
the quality of the sample results depends on the judgment of the person selecting the sample.
Again, great caution is warranted in drawing conclusions based on judgment samples used
to make inferences about populations.
Summary
In this chapter we presented the concepts of sampling and sampling distributions. We
demonstrated how a simple random sample can be selected from a finite population and
discussed how a random sample can be collected from an infinite population. The data col-
lected from such samples can be used to develop point estimates of population parameters.
Because different samples provide different values for the point estimators, point estima-
tors such as 
and 
are random variables. The probability distribution of such a random
variable is called a sampling distribution. In particular, we described the sampling distrib-
utions of the sample mean and the sample proportion .
In considering the characteristics of the sampling distributions of and , we stated that
E( )  μ and E( )  p. After developing the standard deviation or standard error formu-
las for these estimators, we described the conditions necessary for the sampling distribu-
tions of 
and 
to follow a normal distribution. Other sampling methods, including
stratified random sampling, cluster sampling, systematic sampling, convenience sampling,
and judgment sampling, were discussed.

NOTES AND COMMENTS
We recommend using probability sampling meth-
ods when sampling from finite populations: simple
random sampling, stratified random sampling,
cluster sampling, or systematic sampling. For these
methods, formulas are available for evaluating 
the “goodness” of the sample results in terms of the
closeness of the results to the population parame-
ters being estimated. An evaluation of the goodness
cannot be made with convenience or judgment
sampling. Thus, great care should be used in inter-
preting the results based on nonprobability sam-
pling methods.

Sampling and Sampling Distributions
Glossary
Sampled population The population from which the sample is taken.
Frame A listing of the elements the sample will be selected from.
ParameterAnumerical characteristic of a population, such as a population mean μ, a popu-
lation standard deviation σ, a population proportion p, and so on.
Simple random sample A simple random sample of size n from a finite population of size
N is a sample selected such that each possible sample of size n has the same probability of
being selected.
Sampling without replacement Once an element has been included in the sample, it is
removed from the population and cannot be selected a second time.
Sampling with replacement Once an element has been included in the sample, it is
returned to the population. A previously selected element can be selected again and there-
fore may appear in the sample more than once.
Random sample A random sample from an infinite population is a sample selected such
that the following conditions are satisfied: (1) Each element selected comes from the same
population; (2) each element is selected independently.
Sample statistic A sample characteristic, such as a sample mean , a sample standard
deviation s, a sample proportion , and so on. The value of the sample statistic is used to
estimate the value of the corresponding population parameter.
Point estimator The sample statistic, such as , s, or , that provides the point estimate of
the population parameter.
Point estimate The value of a point estimator used in a particular instance as an estimate
of a population parameter.
Target population The population for which statistical inferences such as point estimates
are made. It is important for the target population to correspond as closely as possible to the
sampled population.
Sampling distribution A probability distribution consisting of all possible values of a
sample statistic.
Unbiased A property of a point estimator that is present when the expected value of the
point estimator is equal to the population parameter it estimates.
Finite population correction factor The term 
that is used in the for-
mulas for 
and 
whenever a finite population, rather than an infinite population, is being
sampled. The generally accepted rule of thumb is to ignore the finite population correction
factor whenever n/N  .05.
Standard error The standard deviation of a point estimator.
Central limit theorem A theorem that enables one to use the normal probability distribu-
tion to approximate the sampling distribution of whenever the sample size is large.
Stratified random sampling A probability sampling method in which the population is
first divided into strata and a simple random sample is then taken from each stratum.
Cluster sampling A probability sampling method in which the population is first divided
into clusters and then a simple random sample of the clusters is taken.
Systematic sampling A probability sampling method in which we randomly select one of
the first k elements and then select every kth element thereafter.
Convenience sampling A nonprobability method of sampling whereby elements are
selected for the sample on the basis of convenience.
Judgment sampling A nonprobability method of sampling whereby elements are selected
for the sample based on the judgment of the person doing the study.

Three firms carry inventories that differ in size. Firm A’s inventory contains 2000 items,
firm B’s inventory contains 5000 items, and firm C’s inventory contains 10,000 items. The
population standard deviation for the cost of the items in each firm’s inventory is σ  144.
A statistical consultant recommends that each firm take a sample of 50 items from its
inventory to provide statistically valid estimates of the average cost per item. Managers of
the small firm state that because it has the smallest population, it should be able to make the
estimate from a much smaller sample than that required by the larger firms. However,
the consultant states that to obtain the same standard error and thus the same precision in
the sample results, all firms should use the same sample size regardless of population size.

Founded in 1957 as Food Town, Food Lion is one of the
largest supermarket chains in the United States, with 1300
stores in 11 Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic states. The com-
pany sells more than 24,000 different products and offers
nationally and regionally advertised brand-name merchan-
dise, as well as a growing number of high-quality private 
label products manufactured especially for Food Lion. The
company maintains its low price leadership and quality 
assurance through operating efficiencies such as standard
store formats, innovative warehouse design, energy-
efficient facilities, and data synchronization with suppliers.
Food Lion looks to a future of continued innovation,
growth, price leadership, and service to its customers.
Being in an inventory-intense business, Food Lion
made the decision to adopt the LIFO (last-in, first-out)
method of inventory valuation. This method matches cur-
rent costs against current revenues, which minimizes the
effect of radical price changes on profit and loss results.
In addition, the LIFO method reduces net income thereby
reducing income taxes during periods of inflation.
Food Lion establishes a LIFO index for each of seven
inventory pools: Grocery, Paper/Household, Pet Supplies,
Health & Beauty Aids, Dairy, Cigarette/Tobacco, and
Beer/Wine. For example, a LIFO index of 1.008 for the
Grocery pool would indicate that the company’s grocery
inventory value at current costs reflects a .8% increase due
to inflation over the most recent one-year period.
A LIFO index for each inventory pool requires that
the year-end inventory count for each product be valued
at the current year-end cost and at the preceding year-end
cost. To avoid excessive time and expense associated
with counting the inventory in all 1200 store locations,
Food Lion selects a random sample of 50 stores. Year-
end physical inventories are taken in each of the sample
stores. The current-year and preceding-year costs for
each item are then used to construct the required LIFO
indexes for each inventory pool.
For a recent year, the sample estimate of the LIFO
index for the Health & Beauty Aids inventory pool was
1.015. Using a 95% confidence level, Food Lion com-
puted a margin of error of .006 for the sample estimate.
Thus, the interval from 1.009 to 1.021 provided a 95%
confidence interval estimate of the population LIFO
index. This level of precision was judged to be very good.
In this chapter you will learn how to compute the
margin of error associated with sample estimates. You
will also learn how to use this information to construct
and interpret interval estimates of a population mean
and a population proportion.

In Chapter 7, we stated that a point estimator is a sample statistic used to estimate a popula-
tion parameter. For instance, the sample mean is a point estimator of the population mean
μ and the sample proportion 
is a point estimator of the population proportion p. Because
a point estimator cannot be expected to provide the exact value of the population parameter,
an interval estimate is often computed by adding and subtracting a value, called the mar-
gin of error, to the point estimate. The general form of an interval estimate is as follows:

The purpose of an interval estimate is to provide information about how close the point
estimate, provided by the sample, is to the value of the population parameter.
In this chapter we show how to compute interval estimates of a population mean μ and
a population proportion p. The general form of an interval estimate of a population mean is

Population Mean: σ Known
In order to develop an interval estimate of a population mean, either the population stan-
dard deviation σ or the sample standard deviation s must be used to compute the margin of
error. In most applications σ is not known, and s is used to compute the margin of error. In
some applications, however, large amounts of relevant historical data are available and can
be used to estimate the population standard deviation prior to sampling. Also, in quality con-
trol applications where a process is assumed to be operating correctly, or “in control,” it is
appropriate to treat the population standard deviation as known. We refer to such cases as
the σ known case. In this section we introduce an example in which it is reasonable to treat
σ as known and show how to construct an interval estimate for this case.
Each week Lloyd’s Department Store selects a simple random sample of 100 customers
in order to learn about the amount spent per shopping trip. With x representing the amount
spent per shopping trip, the sample mean provides a point estimate of μ, the mean amount
spent per shopping trip for the population of all Lloyd’s customers. Lloyd’s has been using
the weekly survey for several years. Based on the historical data, Lloyd’s now assumes a
known value of σ  $20 for the population standard deviation. The historical data also in-
dicate that the population follows a normal distribution.
During the most recent week, Lloyd’s surveyed 100 customers (n  100) and obtained
a sample mean of  $82. The sample mean amount spent provides a point estimate of the
population mean amount spent per shopping trip, μ. In the discussion that follows, we show
how to compute the margin of error for this estimate and develop an interval estimate of the
population mean.
Margin of Error and the Interval Estimate
In Chapter 7 we showed that the sampling distribution of 
can be used to compute the
probability that 
will be within a given distance of μ. In the Lloyd’s example, the his-
torical data show that the population of amounts spent is normally distributed with a
standard deviation of σ  20. So, using what we learned in Chapter 7, we can conclude 
that the sampling distribution of 
follows a normal distribution with a standard error of 


 2. This sampling distribution is shown in Figure 8.1.1 Because

x_ has a normal distribution. If the population did not have a normal distribution, we could rely on the central limit theorem
and the sample size of n  100 to conclude that the sampling distribution of x_ is approximately normal. In either case, the
sampling distribution of x_ would appear as shown in Figure 8.1.

In the introduction to this chapter we said that the general form of an interval estimate of
the population mean μ is  margin of error. For the Lloyd’s example, suppose we set the
margin of error equal to 3.92 and compute the interval estimate of μ using  3.92. To pro-
vide an interpretation for this interval estimate, let us consider the values of that could be
obtained if we took three different simple random samples, each consisting of 100 Lloyd’s cus-
tomers. The first sample mean might turn out to have the value shown as 1 in Figure 8.3. In
this case, Figure 8.3 shows that the interval formed by subtracting 3.92 from 1 and adding
3.92 to 1 includes the population mean μ. Now consider what happens if the second sample
mean turns out to have the value shown as 
2 in Figure 8.3. Although this sample mean dif-
fers from the first sample mean, we see that the interval formed by subtracting 3.92 from 2
and adding 3.92 to 2 also includes the population mean μ. However, consider what happens
if the third sample mean turns out to have the value shown as 3 in Figure 8.3. In this case, the
interval formed by subtracting 3.92 from 3 and adding 3.92 to 3 does not include the popu-
lation mean μ. Because 3 falls in the upper tail of the sampling distribution and is farther than
3.92 from μ, subtracting and adding 3.92 to 3 forms an interval that does not include μ.
Any sample mean that is within the darkly shaded region of Figure 8.3 will provide
an interval that contains the population mean μ. Because 95% of all possible sample means
are in the darkly shaded region, 95% of all intervals formed by subtracting 3.92 from and
adding 3.92 to will include the population mean μ.
Recall that during the most recent week, the quality assurance team at Lloyd’s surveyed
100 customers and obtained a sample mean amount spent of

construct the interval estimate, we obtain 82  3.92. Thus, the specific interval estimate of
μ based on the data from the most recent week is 82  3.92  78.08 to 82  3.92  85.92.
Because 95% of all the intervals constructed using 
 3.92 will contain the population
mean, we say that we are 95% confident that the interval 78.08 to 85.92 includes the popu-
lation mean μ. We say that this interval has been established at the 95% confidence level.
The value .95 is referred to as the confidence coefficient, and the interval 78.08 to 85.92
is called the 95% confidence interval.

Let us use expression (8.1) to construct a 95% confidence interval for the Lloyd’s ex-
ample. For a 95% confidence interval, the confidence coefficient is (1  α)  .95 and thus,
α  .05. Using the standard normal probability table, an area of α/2  .05/2  .025 in the
upper tail provides z.025  1.96. With the Lloyd’s sample mean  82, σ  20, and a sam-

Thus, using expression (8.1), the margin of error is 3.92 and the 95% confidence interval is
82  3.92  78.08 to 82  3.92  85.92.
Although a 95% confidence level is frequently used, other confidence levels such as
90% and 99% may be considered. Values of zα/2 for the most commonly used confidence
levels are shown in Table 8.1. Using these values and expression (8.1), the 90% confidence

Thus, at 90% confidence, the margin of error is 3.29 and the confidence interval is
82  3.29  78.71 to 82  3.29  85.29. Similarly, the 99% confidence interval is
Thus, at 99% confidence, the margin of error is 5.15 and the confidence interval is
82  5.15  76.85 to 82  5.15  87.15.
Comparing the results for the 90%, 95%, and 99% confidence levels, we see that in
order to have a higher degree of confidence, the margin of error and thus the width of the
confidence interval must be larger.
Practical Advice
If the population follows a normal distribution, the confidence interval provided by ex-
pression (8.1) is exact. In other words, if expression (8.1) were used repeatedly to generate
95% confidence intervals, exactly 95% of the intervals generated would contain the popu-
lation mean. If the population does not follow a normal distribution, the confidence inter-
val provided by expression (8.1) will be approximate. In this case, the quality of the
approximation depends on both the distribution of the population and the sample size.
In most applications, a sample size of n  30 is adequate when using expression (8.1)
to develop an interval estimate of a population mean. If the population is not normally dis-
tributed but is roughly symmetric, sample sizes as small as 15 can be expected to provide
good approximate confidence intervals. With smaller sample sizes, expression (8.1) should
only be used if the analyst believes, or is willing to assume, that the population distribution
is at least approximately normal.

NOTES AND COMMENTS
1. The interval estimation procedure discussed in
this section is based on the assumption that the
population standard deviation σ is known. By σ
known we mean that historical data or other in-
formation are available that permit us to obtain a
good estimate of the population standard devia-
tion prior to taking the sample that will be used
to develop an estimate of the population mean.
So technically we don’t mean that σ is actually
known with certainty. We just mean that we ob-
tained a good estimate of the standard deviation
prior to sampling and thus we won’t be using the
same sample to estimate both the population
mean and the population standard deviation.
2. The sample size nappears in the denominator of the
interval estimation expression (8.1). Thus, if a par-
ticular sample size provides too wide an interval to
be of any practical use, we may want to consider in-
creasing the sample size. With n in the denomina-
tor, a larger sample size will provide a smaller
margin of error, a narrower interval, and greater
precision. The procedure for determining the size
of a simple random sample necessary to obtain a
desired precision is discussed in Section 8.3.

Population Mean: σ Unknown
When developing an interval estimate of a population mean, we usually do not have a good
estimate of the population standard deviation either. In these cases, we must use the same
sample to estimate both μ and σ. This situation represents the σ unknown case. When s is
used to estimate σ, the margin of error and the interval estimate for the population mean are
based on a probability distribution known as the t distribution. Although the mathematical
development of the t distribution is based on the assumption of a normal distribution for the
population we are sampling from, research shows that the t distribution can be successfully
applied in many situations where the population deviates significantly from normal. Later
in this section we provide guidelines for using the t distribution if the population is not nor-
mally distributed.
The t distribution is a family of similar probability distributions, with a specific t dis-
tribution depending on a parameter known as the degrees of freedom. The t distribution
with one degree of freedom is unique, as is the t distribution with two degrees of free-
dom, with three degrees of freedom, and so on. As the number of degrees of freedom in-
creases, the difference between the t distribution and the standard normal distribution
becomes smaller and smaller. Figure 8.4 shows t distributions with 10 and 20 degrees 
of freedom and their relationship to the standard normal probability distribution. Note
that a t distribution with more degrees of freedom exhibits less variability and more

closely resembles the standard normal distribution. Note also that the mean of the t dis-
tribution is zero.
We place a subscript on t to indicate the area in the upper tail of the t distribution. For
example, just as we used z.025 to indicate the z value providing a .025 area in the upper tail
of a standard normal distribution, we will use t.025 to indicate a .025 area in the upper tail of
a t distribution. In general, we will use the notation tα/2 to represent a t value with an area
of α/2 in the upper tail of the t distribution. See Figure 8.5.
Table 2 in Appendix B contains a table for the t distribution. A portion of this table is
shown in Table 8.2. Each row in the table corresponds to a separate t distribution with the
degrees of freedom shown. For example, for a t distribution with 9 degrees of freedom,
t.025  2.262. Similarly, for a t distribution with 60 degrees of freedom, t.025  2.000. As the
degrees of freedom continue to increase, t.025 approaches z.025  1.96. In fact, the standard
normal distribution z values can be found in the infinite degrees of freedom row (labeled )
of the t distribution table. If the degrees of freedom exceed 100, the infinite degrees of free-
dom row can be used to approximate the actual t value; in other words, for more than 100
degrees of freedom, the standard normal z value provides a good approximation to the 
t value.

of error is then given by tα/2
. With this margin of error, the general expression for an
interval estimate of a population mean when σ is unknown follows.
 sn
The reason the number of degrees of freedom associated with the t value in expression
(8.2) is n  1 concerns the use of s as an estimate of the population standard deviation σ.
The expression for the sample standard deviation is
Degrees of freedom refer to the number of independent pieces of information that go into the
computation of (xi  )2. The n pieces of information involved in computing (xi  )2
are as follows: x1  , x2  , . . . , xn  . In Section 3.2 we indicated that (xi  )  0
for any data set. Thus, only n  1 of the xi 
values are independent; that is, if we know
n  1 of the values, the remaining value can be determined exactly by using the condition
that the sum of the xi 
values must be 0. Thus, n  1 is the number of degrees of freedom
associated with (xi  )2 and hence the number of degrees of freedom for the t distribution
in expression (8.2).
To illustrate the interval estimation procedure for the σ unknown case, we will consider
a study designed to estimate the mean credit card debt for the population of U.S. households.
A sample of n  70 households provided the credit card balances shown in Table 8.3. For
this situation, no previous estimate of the population standard deviation σ is available. Thus,
the sample data must be used to estimate both the population mean and the population stan-
dard deviation. Using the data in Table 8.3, we compute the sample mean  $9312 and the
sample standard deviation s  $4007. With 95% confidence and n  1  69 degrees of

freedom, Table 8.2 can be used to obtain the appropriate value for t.025. We want the t value
in the row with 69 degrees of freedom, and the column corresponding to .025 in the upper
tail. The value shown is t.025  1.995. 
We use expression (8.2) to compute an interval estimate of the population mean credit
card balance.
The point estimate of the population mean is $9312, the margin of error is $955, and the
95% confidence interval is 9312  955  $8357 to 9312  955  $10,267. Thus, we are
95% confident that the mean credit card balance for the population of all households is
between $8357 and $10,267.
The procedures used by Minitab, Excel, and StatTools to develop confidence intervals
for a population mean are described in Appendixes 8.1, 8.2, and 8.3. For the household
credit card balances study, the results of the Minitab interval estimation procedure are
shown in Figure 8.6. The sample of 70 households provides a sample mean credit card bal-
ance of $9312, a sample standard deviation of $4007, a standard error of the mean of $479,
and a 95% confidence interval of $8357 to $10,267.
Practical Advice
If the population follows a normal distribution, the confidence interval provided by ex-
pression (8.2) is exact and can be used for any sample size. If the population does not fol-
low a normal distribution, the confidence interval provided by expression (8.2) will be
approximate. In this case, the quality of the approximation depends on both the distribution
of the population and the sample size.
In most applications, a sample size of n  30 is adequate when using expression (8.2)
to develop an interval estimate of a population mean. However, if the population distribu-
tion is highly skewed or contains outliers, most statisticians would recommend increasing
the sample size to 50 or more. If the population is not normally distributed but is roughly
symmetric, sample sizes as small as 15 can be expected to provide good approximate con-
fidence intervals. With smaller sample sizes, expression (8.2) should be used only if the
analyst believes, or is willing to assume, that the population distribution is at least approxi-
mately normal.
Using a Small Sample
In the following example we develop an interval estimate for a population mean when the
sample size is small. As we already noted, an understanding of the distribution of the popu-
lation becomes a factor in deciding whether the interval estimation procedure provides
acceptable results.

manufacturing requested an estimate of the population mean time required for maintenance
employees to complete the computer-assisted training.
A sample of 20 employees is selected, with each employee in the sample completing
the training program. Data on the training time in days for the 20 employees are shown in
Table 8.4. A histogram of the sample data appears in Figure 8.7. What can we say about the
distribution of the population based on this histogram? First, the sample data do not sup-
port the conclusion that the distribution of the population is normal, yet we do not see any
evidence of skewness or outliers. Therefore, using the guidelines in the previous subsection,
we conclude that an interval estimate based on the t distribution appears acceptable for the
sample of 20 employees.

Chapter 8
Interval Estimation
For a 95% confidence interval, we use Table 2 of Appendix B and n  1  19 degrees of
freedom to obtain t.025  2.093. Expression (8.2) provides the interval estimate of the pop-
ulation mean.
The point estimate of the population mean is 51.5 days. The margin of error is 3.2 days and
the 95% confidence interval is 51.5  3.2  48.3 days to 51.5  3.2  54.7 days.
Using a histogram of the sample data to learn about the distribution of a population is
not always conclusive, but in many cases it provides the only information available. The
histogram, along with judgment on the part of the analyst, can often be used to decide
whether expression (8.2) can be used to develop the interval estimate.
Summary of Interval Estimation Procedures
We provided two approaches to developing an interval estimate of a population mean. For
the σ known case, σ and the standard normal distribution are used in expression (8.1) to
compute the margin of error and to develop the interval estimate. For the σ unknown case,
the sample standard deviation s and the t distribution are used in expression (8.2) to com-
pute the margin of error and to develop the interval estimate.
A summary of the interval estimation procedures for the two cases is shown in 
Figure 8.8. In most applications, a sample size of n  30 is adequate. If the population has
a normal or approximately normal distribution, however, smaller sample sizes may be used.

For the σ unknown case, a sample size of n  50 is recommended if the population dis-

NOTES AND COMMENTS
1. When σ is known, the margin of error, zα/2(
),
is fixed and is the same for all samples of 
size n. When σ is unknown, the margin of error,
tα/2(
), varies from sample to sample. This
variation occurs because the sample standard 
deviation s varies depending upon the sample 
selected. A large value for s provides a larger
margin of error, while a small value for s pro-
vides a smaller margin of error.
2. What happens to confidence interval estimates
when the population is skewed? Consider a
population that is skewed to the right with large
data values stretching the distribution to the
right. When such skewness exists, the sample
mean and the sample standard deviation s are
positively correlated. Larger values of s tend to
x¯
sn
σn
be associated with larger values of . Thus,
when 
is larger than the population mean, s
tends to be larger than σ. This skewness causes
the margin of error, tα/2(
), to be larger than
it would be with σ known. The confidence in-
terval with the larger margin of error tends to
include the population mean μ more often than
it would if the true value of σ were used. But
when is smaller than the population mean, the
correlation between 
and s causes the margin
of error to be small. In this case, the confidence
interval with the smaller margin of error tends
to miss the population mean more than it would
if we knew σ and used it. For this reason, we
recommend using larger sample sizes with
highly skewed population distributions.

Determining the Sample Size
In providing practical advice in the two preceding sections, we commented on the role of
the sample size in providing good approximate confidence intervals when the population is
not normally distributed. In this section, we focus on another aspect of the sample size issue.
We describe how to choose a sample size large enough to provide a desired margin of error.
To understand how this process works, we return to the σ known case presented in Section
8.1. Using expression (8.1), the interval estimate is
x¯  zα/2 σ
n
If a desired margin of error
is selected prior to
sampling, the procedures in
this section can be used to
determine the sample size
necessary to satisfy the
margin of error
requirement.

The quantity zα/2(
) is the margin of error. Thus, we see that zα/2, the population stan-
dard deviation σ, and the sample size n combine to determine the margin of error. Once we
select a confidence coefficient, 1  α, zα/2 can be determined. Then, if we have a value for
σ, we can determine the sample size n needed to provide any desired margin of error. 
Development of the formula used to compute the required sample size n follows.
Let E  the desired margin of error:

Interval Estimation
This sample size provides the desired margin of error at the chosen confidence level.
In equation (8.3), E is the margin of error that the user is willing to accept, and the value
of zα/2 follows directly from the confidence level to be used in developing the interval esti-
mate. Although user preference must be considered, 95% confidence is the most frequently
chosen value (z.025  1.96).
Finally, use of equation (8.3) requires a value for the population standard deviation σ.
However, even if σ is unknown, we can use equation (8.3) provided we have a preliminary
or planning value for σ. In practice, one of the following procedures can be chosen.
1. Use the estimate of the population standard deviation computed from data of previ-
ous studies as the planning value for σ.
2. Use a pilot study to select a preliminary sample. The sample standard deviation from
the preliminary sample can be used as the planning value for σ.
3. Use judgment or a “best guess” for the value of σ. For example, we might begin by
estimating the largest and smallest data values in the population. The difference be-
tween the largest and smallest values provides an estimate of the range for the data.
Finally, the range divided by 4 is often suggested as a rough approximation of the
standard deviation and thus an acceptable planning value for σ.
Let us demonstrate the use of equation (8.3) to determine the sample size by consider-
ing the following example. A previous study that investigated the cost of renting automo-
biles in the United States found a mean cost of approximately $55 per day for renting a
midsize automobile. Suppose that the organization that conducted this study would like to
conduct a new study in order to estimate the population mean daily rental cost for a midsize
automobile in the United States. In designing the new study, the project director specifies
that the population mean daily rental cost be estimated with a margin of error of $2 and a
95% level of confidence.
The project director specified a desired margin of error of E  2, and the 95% level of
confidence indicates z.025  1.96. Thus, we need only a planning value for the population
standard deviation σ in order to compute the required sample size. At this point, an analyst
reviewed the sample data from the previous study and found that the sample standard devia-
tion for the daily rental cost was $9.65. Using 9.65 as the planning value for σ, we obtain

Equation (8.3) can be used
to provide a good sample
size recommendation.
However, judgment on the
part of the analyst should
be used to determine
whether the final sample
size should be adjusted
upward.
A planning value for the
population standard
deviation σ must be
specified before the sample
size can be determined.
Three methods of obtaining
a planning value for σ are
discussed here.

Thus, the sample size for the new study needs to be at least 89.43 midsize automobile rentals
in order to satisfy the project director’s $2 margin-of-error requirement. In cases where the
computed n is not an integer, we round up to the next integer value; hence, the recom-
mended sample size is 90 midsize automobile rentals.

The following example illustrates the computation of the margin of error and interval
estimate for a population proportion. A national survey of 900 women golfers was con-
ducted to learn how women golfers view their treatment at golf courses in the United States.
The survey found that 396 of the women golfers were satisfied with the availability of tee
times. Thus, the point estimate of the proportion of the population of women golfers who
are satisfied with the availability of tee times is 396/900  .44. Using expression (8.6) and
a 95% confidence level,
Thus, the margin of error is .0324 and the 95% confidence interval estimate of the popula-
tion proportion is .4076 to .4724. Using percentages, the survey results enable us to state
with 95% confidence that between 40.76% and 47.24% of all women golfers are satisfied
with the availability of tee times.

Because the sampling distribution of

Chapter 8
Interval Estimation
Determining the Sample Size
Let us consider the question of how large the sample size should be to obtain an estimate
of a population proportion at a specified level of precision. The rationale for the sample size
determination in developing interval estimates of p is similar to the rationale used in Sec-
tion 8.3 to determine the sample size for estimating a population mean.
Previously in this section we said that the margin of error associated with an interval
estimate of a population proportion is zα/2
. The margin of error is based on the 
p¯  (1  p¯)n
In practice, the planning value p* can be chosen by one of the following procedures.
1. Use the sample proportion from a previous sample of the same or similar units.
2. Use a pilot study to select a preliminary sample. The sample proportion from this
sample can be used as the planning value, p*.
3. Use judgment or a “best guess” for the value of p*.
4. If none of the preceding alternatives apply, use a planning value of p*  .50.
Let us return to the survey of women golfers and assume that the company is interested
in conducting a new survey to estimate the current proportion of the population of women
golfers who are satisfied with the availability of tee times. How large should the sample be
if the survey director wants to estimate the population proportion with a margin of error of
.025 at 95% confidence? With E  .025 and zα/2  1.96, we need a planning value p* to
answer the sample size question. Using the previous survey result of 
 .44 as the plan-
ning value p*, equation (8.7) shows that

value of zα/2, the sample proportion , and the sample size n. Larger sample sizes provide
a smaller margin of error and better precision.
Let E denote the desired margin of error.
Solving this equation for n provides a formula for the sample size that will provide a mar-
gin of error of size E.
Note, however, that we cannot use this formula to compute the sample size that will provide
the desired margin of error because 
will not be known until after we select the sample.
What we need, then, is a planning value for 
that can be used to make the computation. 
Using p* to denote the planning value for , the following formula can be used to compute
the sample size that will provide a margin of error of size E.

Thus, the sample size must be at least 1514.5 women golfers to satisfy the margin of error
requirement. Rounding up to the next integer value indicates that a sample of 1515 women
golfers is recommended to satisfy the margin of error requirement.
The fourth alternative suggested for selecting a planning value p* is to use p*  .50. This value
of p* is frequently used when no other information is available. To understand why, note that the
numerator of equation (8.7) shows that the sample size is proportional to the quantity p*(1  p*).
Alarger value for the quantity p*(1  p*) will result in a larger sample size. Table 8.5 gives some
possible values of p*(1  p*). Note that the largest value of p*(1  p*) occurs when p*  .50.
Thus, in case of any uncertainty about an appropriate planning value, we know that p*  .50 will
provide the largest sample size recommendation. In effect, we play it safe by recommending the
largest necessary sample size. If the sample proportion turns out to be different from the .50 plan-
ning value, the margin of error will be smaller than anticipated. Thus, in using p*  .50, we guar-
antee that the sample size will be sufficient to obtain the desired margin of error.
In the survey of women golfers example, a planning value of p*  .50 would have 
provided the sample size
Thus, a slightly larger sample size of 1537 women golfers would be recommended.

Summary
In this chapter we presented methods for developing interval estimates of a population mean
and a population proportion. A point estimator may or may not provide a good estimate of
a population parameter. The use of an interval estimate provides a measure of the precision
of an estimate. Both the interval estimate of the population mean and the population 
proportion are of the form: point estimate  margin of error.

Chapter 8
Interval Estimation
We presented interval estimates for a population mean for two cases. In the σ known
case, historical data or other information is used to develop an estimate of σ prior to taking
a sample. Analysis of new sample data then proceeds based on the assumption that σ is
known. In the σ unknown case, the sample data are used to estimate both the population
mean and the population standard deviation. The final choice of which interval estimation
procedure to use depends upon the analyst’s understanding of which method provides the
best estimate of σ.
In the σ known case, the interval estimation procedure is based on the assumed value
of σ and the use of the standard normal distribution. In the σ unknown case, the interval
estimation procedure uses the sample standard deviation s and the t distribution. In both
cases the quality of the interval estimates obtained depends on the distribution of the
population and the sample size. If the population is normally distributed, the interval
estimates will be exact in both cases, even for small sample sizes. If the population is not
normally distributed, the interval estimates obtained will be approximate. Larger sample
sizes will provide better approximations, but the more highly skewed the population is,
the larger the sample size needs to be to obtain a good approximation. Practical advice
about the sample size necessary to obtain good approximations was included in Sections
8.1 and 8.2. In most cases a sample of size 30 or more will provide good approximate con-
fidence intervals.

In practice the sample sizes used for interval estimates of a population proportion are generally
large. Thus, the interval estimation procedure is based on the standard normal distribution.
Often a desired margin of error is specified prior to developing a sampling plan. We
showed how to choose a sample size large enough to provide the desired precision.
Glossary
Interval estimate An estimate of a population parameter that provides an interval believed
to contain the value of the parameter. For the interval estimates in this chapter, it has the
form: point estimate  margin of error.
Margin of error The  value added to and subtracted from a point estimate in order to 
develop an interval estimate of a population parameter.
σ known The case when historical data or other information provides a good value for the
population standard deviation prior to taking a sample. The interval estimation procedure
uses this known value of σ in computing the margin of error.
Confidence level The confidence associated with an interval estimate. For example, if an
interval estimation procedure provides intervals such that 95% of the intervals formed using
the procedure will include the population parameter, the interval estimate is said to be 
constructed at the 95% confidence level.
Confidence coefficient The confidence level expressed as a decimal value. For example,
.95 is the confidence coefficient for a 95% confidence level.
Confidence interval Another name for an interval estimate.
σ unknown The more common case when no good basis exists for estimating the popula-
tion standard deviation prior to taking the sample. The interval estimation procedure uses
the sample standard deviation s in computing the margin of error.
t distribution A family of probability distributions that can be used to develop an interval
estimate of a population mean whenever the population standard deviation σ is unknown
and is estimated by the sample standard deviation s.
Degrees of freedom A parameter of the t distribution. When the t distribution is used in the
computation of an interval estimate of a population mean, the appropriate t distribution has
n  1 degrees of freedom, where n is the size of the simple random sample.

US Airways conducted a number of studies that indicated a substantial savings could be obtained
by encouraging Dividend Miles frequent flyer customers to redeem miles and schedule award
flights online (US Airways Attaché, February 2003). One study collected data on the amount of
time required to redeem miles and schedule an award flight over the telephone. Asample show-
ing the time in minutes required for each of 150 award flights scheduled by telephone is con-
tained in the data set Flights. Use Minitab or Excel to help answer the following questions.

A recent article reported that there are approximately 11 minutes of actual playing time in
a typical National Football League (NFL) game (The Wall Street Journal, January 15,
2010). The article included information about the amount of time devoted to replays, the
amount of time devoted to commercials, and the amount of time the players spend stand-
ing around between plays. Data consistent with the findings published in The Wall Street
Journal are in the file named Standing. These data provide the amount of time players
spend standing around between plays for a sample of 60 NFL games. 
a.
Use the Standing data set to develop a point estimate of the number of minutes during
an NFL game that players are standing around between plays. Compare this to the ac-
tual playing time reported in the article. Are you surprised?
b.
What is the sample standard deviation?
c.
Develop a 95% confidence interval for the number of minutes players spend standing
around between plays.

Many stock market observers say that when the P/E ratio for stocks gets over 20, the market is
overvalued. The P/E ratio is the stock price divided by the most recent 12 months of earnings.
Suppose you are interested in seeing whether the current market is overvalued and would also
like to know what proportion of companies pay dividends. A random sample of 30 companies
listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is provided (Barron’s, January 19, 2004).

Case Problem 3 Metropolitan Research, Inc.
Metropolitan Research, Inc., a consumer research organization, conducts surveys designed
to evaluate a wide variety of products and services available to consumers. In one particular
study, Metropolitan looked at consumer satisfaction with the performance of automobiles
produced by a major Detroit manufacturer. Aquestionnaire sent to owners of one of the man-
ufacturer’s full-sized cars revealed several complaints about early transmission problems. To
learn more about the transmission failures, Metropolitan used a sample of actual transmis-
sion repairs provided by a transmission repair firm in the Detroit area. The following data
show the actual number of miles driven for 50 vehicles at the time of transmission failure.

Managerial Report
1. Use appropriate descriptive statistics to summarize the transmission failure data.
2. Develop a 95% confidence interval for the mean number of miles driven until trans-
mission failure for the population of automobiles with transmission failure. Provide
a managerial interpretation of the interval estimate.
3. Discuss the implication of your statistical findings in terms of the belief that some
owners of the automobiles experienced early transmission failures.
4. How many repair records should be sampled if the research firm wants the popula-
tion mean number of miles driven until transmission failure to be estimated with a
margin of error of 5000 miles? Use 95% confidence.
5. What other information would you like to gather to evaluate the transmission fail-
ure problem more fully?

Interval Estimation
Appendix 8.1 Interval Estimation Using Minitab
We describe the use of Minitab in constructing confidence intervals for a population mean
and a population proportion.
Population Mean: σ Known
We illustrate interval estimation using the Lloyd’s example in Section 8.1. The amounts
spent per shopping trip for the sample of 100 customers are in column C1 of a Minitab
worksheet. The population standard deviation σ  20 is assumed known. The following
steps can be used to compute a 95% confidence interval estimate of the population mean.
Step 1. Select the Stat menu
Step 2. Choose Basic Statistics
Step 3. Choose 1-Sample Z
Step 4. When the 1-Sample Z (Test and Confidence Interval) dialog box appears:
Enter C1 in the Samples in columns box
Enter 20 in the Standard deviation box
Step 5. Click OK
The Minitab default is a 95% confidence level. In order to specify a different confidence
level such as 90%, add the following to step 4.
Select Options
When the 1-Sample Z-Options dialog box appears:
Enter 90 in the Confidence level box
Click OK
Population Mean: σ Unknown
We illustrate interval estimation using the data in Table 8.3 showing the credit card balances
for a sample of 70 households. The data are in column C1 of a Minitab worksheet. In this
case the population standard deviation σ will be estimated by the sample standard devia-
tion s. The following steps can be used to compute a 95% confidence interval estimate of
the population mean.
Step 1. Select the Stat menu
Step 2. Choose Basic Statistics
Step 3. Choose 1-Sample t
Step 4. When the 1-Sample t (Test and Confidence Interval) dialog box appears:
Enter C1 in the Samples in columns box
Step 5. Click OK
The Minitab default is a 95% confidence level. In order to specify a different confidence
level such as 90%, add the following to step 4.
Select Options
When the 1-Sample t-Options dialog box appears:
Enter 90 in the Confidence level box
Click OK
Population Proportion
We illustrate interval estimation using the survey data for women golfers presented in Sec-
tion 8.4. The data are in column C1 of a Minitab worksheet. Individual responses are re-
corded as Yes if the golfer is satisfied with the availability of tee times and No otherwise.
The following steps can be used to compute a 95% confidence interval estimate of the pro-
portion of women golfers who are satisfied with the availability of tee times.

Step 1. Select the Stat menu
Step 2. Choose Basic Statistics
Step 3. Choose 1 Proportion
Step 4. When the 1 Proportion (Test and Confidence Interval) dialog box appears:
Enter C1 in the Samples in columns box
Step 5. Select Options
Step 6. When the 1 Proportion-Options dialog box appears:
Select Use test and interval based on normal distribution
Click OK
Step 7. Click OK
The Minitab default is a 95% confidence level. In order to specify a different confidence
level such as 90%, enter 90 in the Confidence Level box when the 1 Proportion-Options
dialog box appears in step 6.
Note: Minitab’s 1 Proportion routine uses an alphabetical ordering of the responses and
selects the second response for the population proportion of interest. In the women golfers
example, Minitab used the alphabetical ordering No-Yes and then provided the confi-
dence interval for the proportion of Yes responses. Because Yes was the response of inter-
est, the Minitab output was fine. However, if Minitab’s alphabetical ordering does not
provide the response of interest, select any cell in the column and use the sequence: Editor 
Column Value Order. It will provide you with the option of entering a user-specified order,
but you must list the response of interest second in the define-an-order box.
Appendix 8.2 Interval Estimation Using Excel
We describe the use of Excel in constructing confidence intervals for a population mean and
a population proportion.
Population Mean: σ Known
We illustrate interval estimation using the Lloyd’s example in Section 8.1. The population
standard deviation σ  20 is assumed known. The amounts spent for the sample of 100 cus-
tomers are in column A of an Excel worksheet. The following steps can be used to compute
the margin of error for an estimate of the population mean. We begin by using Excel’s 
Descriptive Statistics Tool described in Chapter 3.
Step 1. Click the Data tab on the Ribbon
Step 2. In the Analysis group, click Data Analysis
Step 3. Choose Descriptive Statistics from the list of Analysis Tools
Step 4. When the Descriptive Statistics dialog box appears:
Enter A1:A101 in the Input Range box
Select Grouped by Columns
Select Labels in First Row
Select Output Range
Enter C1 in the Output Range box
Select Summary Statistics
Click OK
The summary statistics will appear in columns C and D. Continue by computing the mar-
gin of error using Excel’s Confidence function as follows:
Step 5. Select cell C16 and enter the label Margin of Error
Step 6. Select cell D16 and enter the Excel formula CONFIDENCE(.05,20,100)

Interval Estimation
The three parameters of the Confidence function are
Alpha  1  confidence coefficient  1  .95  .05
The population standard deviation  20
The sample size  100 (Note: This parameter appears as Count in cell D15.)
The point estimate of the population mean is in cell D3 and the margin of error is in cell
D16. The point estimate (82) and the margin of error (3.92) allow the confidence interval
for the population mean to be easily computed.
Population Mean: σ Unknown
We illustrate interval estimation using the data in Table 8.2, which show the credit card bal-
ances for a sample of 70 households. The data are in column A of an Excel worksheet. The
following steps can be used to compute the point estimate and the margin of error for an in-
terval estimate of a population mean. We will use Excel’s Descriptive Statistics Tool de-
scribed in Chapter 3.
Step 1. Click the Data tab on the Ribbon
Step 2. In the Analysis group, click Data Analysis
Step 3. Choose Descriptive Statistics from the list of Analysis Tools
Step 4. When the Descriptive Statistics dialog box appears:
Enter A1:A71 in the Input Range box
Select Grouped by Columns
Select Labels in First Row
Select Output Range
Enter C1 in the Output Range box
Select Summary Statistics
Select Confidence Level for Mean
Enter 95 in the Confidence Level for Mean box
Click OK
The summary statistics will appear in columns C and D. The point estimate of the popula-
tion mean appears in cell D3. The margin of error, labeled “Confidence Level(95.0%),” ap-
pears in cell D16. The point estimate ($9312) and the margin of error ($955) allow the
confidence interval for the population mean to be easily computed. The output from this
Excel procedure is shown in Figure 8.10.
Population Proportion
We illustrate interval estimation using the survey data for women golfers presented in Section
8.4. The data are in column Aof an Excel worksheet. Individual responses are recorded as Yes
if the golfer is satisfied with the availability of tee times and No otherwise. Excel does not offer
a built-in routine to handle the estimation of a population proportion; however, it is relatively
easy to develop an Excel template that can be used for this purpose. The template shown in
Figure 8.11 provides the 95% confidence interval estimate of the proportion of women golfers
who are satisfied with the availability of tee times. Note that the background worksheet in Fig-
ure 8.11 shows the cell formulas that provide the interval estimation results shown in the fore-
ground worksheet. The following steps are necessary to use the template for this data set.
Step 1. Enter the data range A2:A901 into the COUNTA cell formula in cell D3
Step 2. Enter Yes as the response of interest in cell D4
Step 3. Enter the data range A2:A901 into the COUNTIF cell formula in cell D5
Step 4. Enter .95 as the confidence coefficient in cell D8

The template automatically provides the confidence interval in cells D15 and D16.
This template can be used to compute the confidence interval for a population propor-
tion for other applications. For instance, to compute the interval estimate for a new data set,
enter the new sample data into column A of the worksheet and then make the changes to the
four cells as shown. If the new sample data have already been summarized, the sample data
do not have to be entered into the worksheet. In this case, enter the sample size into cell D3
and the sample proportion into cell D6; the worksheet template will then provide the con-
fidence interval for the population proportion. The worksheet in Figure 8.11 is available in
the file Interval p on the website that accompanies this book.
Appendix 8.3 Interval Estimation Using StatTools
In this appendix we show how StatTools can be used to develop an interval estimate of a
population mean for the σ unknown case, to select a sample size for the  unknown case,
and to develop an interval estimate of a population proportion.
Population Mean: σ Unknown Case
In this case the population standard deviation σ will be estimated by the sample standard
deviation s. We use the credit card balance data in Table 8.3 to illustrate. Begin by using the
Data Set Manager to create a StatTools data set for these data using the procedure described
in the appendix to Chapter 1. The following steps can be used to compute a 95% confidence
interval estimate of the population mean.

Determining the Sample Size
In Section 8.3 we showed how to determine the sample size needed to provide a desired
margin of error. The example used involved a study designed to estimate the population
mean daily rental cost for a midsize automobile in the United States. The project director
specified that the population mean daily rental cost be estimated with a margin of error of
$2 and a 95% level of confidence. Sample data from a previous study provided a sample
standard deviation of $9.65; this value was used as the planning value for the population
standard deviation. The following steps can be used to compute the recommended sample
size required to provide a 95% confidence interval estimate of the population mean with a
margin of error of $2.
Step 1. Click the StatTools tab on the Ribbon
Step 2. In the Analyses group, click Statistical Inference
Step 3. Choose the Sample Size Selection option
Step 4. When the StatTools—Sample Size Selection dialog box appears:
In the Parameter to Estimate section, select Mean
In the Confidence Interval Specification section:
Select 95% for the Confidence Level
Enter 2 in the Half-Length of Interval box
Enter 9.65 in the Estimated Std Dev box
Click OK
The output showing a recommended sample size of 90 will appear.
Population Proportion
We illustrate using the survey data for women golfers presented in Section 8.4. Begin by
using the Data Set Manager to create a StatTools data set for these data using the procedure
described in the appendix to Chapter 1. The following steps can be used to compute a 95%
confidence interval estimate of the population mean.
Step 1. Click the StatTools tab on the Ribbon
Step 2. In the Analyses group, click Statistical Inference
Step 3. Choose Confidence Interval
Step 4. Choose Proportion
Step 5. When the StatTools—Confidence Interval for Proportion dialog box appears:
For Analysis Type choose One-Sample Analysis
In the Variables section, select Response
In the Categories to Analyze section, select Yes
In the Options section, enter 95% in the Confidence Level box Click OK
Some descriptive statistics and the confidence interval will appear.
StatTools also provides a capability for determining the appropriate sample size to pro-
vide a desired margin of error. The steps are similar to those for determining the sample size
in the previous subsection.
The half-length of interval
is the margin of error.

JOHN MORRELL & COMPANY*
CINCINNATI, OHIO
STATISTICS in PRACTICE
John Morrell & Company, which began in England in
1827, is considered the oldest continuously operating
meat manufacturer in the United States. It is a wholly
owned and independently managed subsidiary of
Smithfield Foods, Smithfield, Virginia. John Morrell &
Company offers an extensive product line of processed
meats and fresh pork to consumers under 13 regional
brands including John Morrell, E-Z-Cut, Tobin’s First
Prize, Dinner Bell, Hunter, Kretschmar, Rath, Rodeo,
Shenson, Farmers Hickory Brand, Iowa Quality, and
Peyton’s. Each regional brand enjoys high brand recog-
nition and loyalty among consumers.
Market research at Morrell provides management with
up-to-date information on the company’s various products
and how the products compare with competing brands of
similar products. Arecent study compared a Beef Pot Roast
made by Morrell to similar beef products from two major
competitors. In the three-product comparison test, a sample
of consumers was used to indicate how the products rated
in terms of taste, appearance, aroma, and overall preference.
One research question concerned whether the Beef
Pot Roast made by Morrell was the preferred choice of
more than 50% of the consumer population. Letting p
indicate the population proportion preferring Morrell’s
product, the hypothesis test for the research question is
as follows:
The null hypothesis H0 indicates the preference for
Morrell’s product is less than or equal to 50%. If the
sample data support rejecting H0 in favor of the alternative
H0:
Ha: p  .50
p  .50
hypothesis Ha, Morrell will draw the research conclusion
that in a three-product comparison, its Beef Pot Roast is
preferred by more than 50% of the consumer population.
In an independent taste test study using a sample
of 224 consumers in Cincinnati, Milwaukee, and Los
Angeles, 150 consumers selected the Beef Pot Roast
made by Morrell as the preferred product. Using statisti-
cal hypothesis testing procedures, the null hypothesis H0
was rejected. The study provided statistical evidence sup-
porting Ha and the conclusion that the Morrell product is
preferred by more than 50% of the consumer population.
The point estimate of the population proportion was
 150/224  .67. Thus, the sample data provided sup-
port for a food magazine advertisement showing that in a
three-product taste comparison, Beef Pot Roast made by
Morrell was “preferred 2 to 1 over the competition.”
In this chapter we will discuss how to formulate hy-
potheses and how to conduct tests like the one used by
Morrell. Through the analysis of sample data, we will be
able to determine whether a hypothesis should or should
not be rejected.

Hypothesis testing helps John Morrell & Company
analyze market research about their products. 
*The authors are indebted to Marty Butler, Vice President of Marketing,
John Morrell, for providing this Statistics in Practice.
In Chapters 7 and 8 we showed how a sample could be used to develop point and interval
estimates of population parameters. In this chapter we continue the discussion of statistical
inference by showing how hypothesis testing can be used to determine whether a statement
about the value of a population parameter should or should not be rejected.
In hypothesis testing we begin by making a tentative assumption about a population
parameter. This tentative assumption is called the null hypothesis and is denoted by H0. 
We then define another hypothesis, called the alternative hypothesis, which is the oppo-
site of what is stated in the null hypothesis. The alternative hypothesis is denoted by Ha.

The hypothesis testing procedure uses data from a sample to test the two competing state-
ments indicated by H0 and Ha.
This chapter shows how hypothesis tests can be conducted about a population mean and
a population proportion. We begin by providing examples that illustrate approaches to
developing null and alternative hypotheses.
9.1
Developing Null and Alternative Hypotheses
It is not always obvious how the null and alternative hypotheses should be formulated. Care
must be taken to structure the hypotheses appropriately so that the hypothesis testing con-
clusion provides the information the researcher or decision maker wants. The context of the
situation is very important in determining how the hypotheses should be stated. All hy-
pothesis testing applications involve collecting a sample and using the sample results to pro-
vide evidence for drawing a conclusion. Good questions to consider when formulating the
null and alternative hypotheses are, What is the purpose of collecting the sample? What con-
clusions are we hoping to make?
In the chapter introduction, we stated that the null hypothesis H0 is a tentative assump-
tion about a population parameter such as a population mean or a population proportion.
The alternative hypothesis Ha is a statement that is the opposite of what is stated in the null
hypothesis. In some situations it is easier to identify the alternative hypothesis first and then
develop the null hypothesis. In other situations it is easier to identify the null hypothesis
first and then develop the alternative hypothesis. We will illustrate these situations in the
following examples.
The Alternative Hypothesis as a Research Hypothesis
Many applications of hypothesis testing involve an attempt to gather evidence in support of
a research hypothesis. In these situations, it is often best to begin with the alternative hy-
pothesis and make it the conclusion that the researcher hopes to support. Consider a partic-
ular automobile that currently attains a fuel efficiency of 24 miles per gallon in city driving.
Aproduct research group has developed a new fuel injection system designed to increase the
miles-per-gallon rating. The group will run controlled tests with the new fuel injection sys-
tem looking for statistical support for the conclusion that the new fuel injection system pro-
vides more miles per gallon than the current system. 
Several new fuel injection units will be manufactured, installed in test automobiles, and
subjected to research-controlled driving conditions. The sample mean miles per gallon for
these automobiles will be computed and used in a hypothesis test to determine if it can be
concluded that the new system provides more than 24 miles per gallon. In terms of the pop-
ulation mean miles per gallon μ, the research hypothesis μ  24 becomes the alternative hy-
pothesis. Since the current system provides an average or mean of 24 miles per gallon, we
will make the tentative assumption that the new system is not any better than the current sys-
tem and choose μ  24 as the null hypothesis. The null and alternative hypotheses are:
If the sample results lead to the conclusion to reject H0, the inference can be made that 
Ha: μ  24 is true. The researchers have the statistical support to state that the new fuel in-
jection system increases the mean number of miles per gallon. The production of automo-
biles with the new fuel injection system should be considered. However, if the sample
results lead to the conclusion that H0 cannot be rejected, the researchers cannot conclude
H0:
Ha: μ  24
μ  24

some initial confusion over
the proper choice of the

hypotheses. The examples
in this section are intended
to provide guidelines.

that the new fuel injection system is better than the current system. Production of automo-
biles with the new fuel injection system on the basis of better gas mileage cannot be justi-
fied. Perhaps more research and further testing can be conducted.
Successful companies stay competitive by developing new products, new methods, new
systems, and the like that are better than what is currently available. Before adopting some-
thing new, it is desirable to conduct research to determine if there is statistical support for
the conclusion that the new approach is indeed better. In such cases, the research hypothe-
sis is stated as the alternative hypothesis. For example, a new teaching method is developed
that is believed to be better than the current method. The alternative hypothesis is that the
new method is better. The null hypothesis is that the new method is no better than the old
method. A new sales force bonus plan is developed in an attempt to increase sales. The al-
ternative hypothesis is that the new bonus plan increases sales. The null hypothesis is that
the new bonus plan does not increase sales. A new drug is developed with the goal of low-
ering blood pressure more than an existing drug. The alternative hypothesis is that the new
drug lowers blood pressure more than the existing drug. The null hypothesis is that the new
drug does not provide lower blood pressure than the existing drug. In each case, rejection
of the null hypothesis H0 provides statistical support for the research hypothesis. We will
see many examples of hypothesis tests in research situations such as these throughout this
chapter and in the remainder of the text.
The Null Hypothesis as an Assumption to Be Challenged
Of course, not all hypothesis tests involve research hypotheses. In the following discussion
we consider applications of hypothesis testing where we begin with a belief or an assumption
that a statement about the value of a population parameter is true. We will then use a hypoth-
esis test to challenge the assumption and determine if there is statistical evidence to conclude
that the assumption is incorrect. In these situations, it is helpful to develop the null hypothe-
sis first. The null hypothesis H0 expresses the belief or assumption about the value of the pop-
ulation parameter. The alternative hypothesis Ha is that the belief or assumption is incorrect.
As an example, consider the situation of a manufacturer of soft drink products. The la-
bel on a soft drink bottle states that it contains 67.6 fluid ounces. We consider the label cor-
rect provided the population mean filling weight for the bottles is at least 67.6 fluid ounces.
Without any reason to believe otherwise, we would give the manufacturer the benefit of the
doubt and assume that the statement provided on the label is correct. Thus, in a hypothesis
test about the population mean fluid weight per bottle, we would begin with the assumption
that the label is correct and state the null hypothesis as μ  67.6. The challenge to this as-
sumption would imply that the label is incorrect and the bottles are being underfilled. This
challenge would be stated as the alternative hypothesis μ  67.6. Thus, the null and alter-
native hypotheses are
A government agency with the responsibility for validating manufacturing labels could
select a sample of soft drink bottles, compute the sample mean filling weight, and use the
sample results to test the preceding hypotheses. If the sample results lead to the conclusion
to reject H0, the inference that Ha: μ  67.6 is true can be made. With this statistical sup-
port, the agency is justified in concluding that the label is incorrect and underfilling of the
bottles is occurring. Appropriate action to force the manufacturer to comply with labeling
standards would be considered. However, if the sample results indicate H0 cannot be re-
jected, the assumption that the manufacturer’s labeling is correct cannot be rejected. With
this conclusion, no action would be taken.
H0:
Ha: μ  67.6
μ  67.6
The conclusion that the
research hypothesis is true
is made if the sample data
provide sufficient evidence
to show that the null
hypothesis can be rejected.
A manufacturer’s product
information is usually
assumed to be true and
stated as the null
hypothesis. The conclusion
that the information is
incorrect can be made if the
null hypothesis is rejected.

Let us now consider a variation of the soft drink bottle filling example by viewing the
same situation from the manufacturer’s point of view. The bottle-filling operation has been
designed to fill soft drink bottles with 67.6 fluid ounces as stated on the label. The company
does not want to underfill the containers because that could result in an underfilling com-
plaint from customers or, perhaps, a government agency. However, the company does not
want to overfill containers either because putting more soft drink than necessary into the
containers would be an unnecessary cost. The company’s goal would be to adjust the bottle-
filling operation so that the population mean filling weight per bottle is 67.6 fluid ounces
as specified on the label.
Although this is the company’s goal, from time to time any production process can get
out of adjustment. If this occurs in our example, underfilling or overfilling of the soft drink
bottles will occur. In either case, the company would like to know about it in order to cor-
rect the situation by readjusting the bottle-filling operation to the designed 67.6 fluid
ounces. In a hypothesis testing application, we would again begin with the assumption that
the production process is operating correctly and state the null hypothesis as μ  67.6 fluid
ounces. The alternative hypothesis that challenges this assumption is that μ  67.6, which
indicates either overfilling or underfilling is occurring. The null and alternative hypotheses
for the manufacturer’s hypothesis test are
Suppose that the soft drink manufacturer uses a quality control procedure to periodically
select a sample of bottles from the filling operation and computes the sample mean filling
weight per bottle. If the sample results lead to the conclusion to reject H0, the inference is made
that Ha: μ  67.6 is true. We conclude that the bottles are not being filled properly and the pro-
duction process should be adjusted to restore the population mean to 67.6 fluid ounces per
bottle. However, if the sample results indicate H0 cannot be rejected, the assumption that the
manufacturer’s bottle filling operation is functioning properly cannot be rejected. In this case,
no further action would be taken and the production operation would continue to run.
The two preceding forms of the soft drink manufacturing hypothesis test show that the
null and alternative hypotheses may vary depending upon the point of view of the researcher
or decision maker. To correctly formulate hypotheses it is important to understand the con-
text of the situation and structure the hypotheses to provide the information the researcher
or decision maker wants.
Summary of Forms for Null and Alternative Hypotheses
The hypothesis tests in this chapter involve two population parameters: the population mean
and the population proportion. Depending on the situation, hypothesis tests about a popu-
lation parameter may take one of three forms: Two use inequalities in the null hypothesis;
the third uses an equality in the null hypothesis. For hypothesis tests involving a population
mean, we let μ0 denote the hypothesized value and we must choose one of the following
three forms for the hypothesis test.
For reasons that will be clear later, the first two forms are called one-tailed tests. The third
form is called a two-tailed test.
In many situations, the choice of H0 and Ha is not obvious and judgment is necessary
to select the proper form. However, as the preceding forms show, the equality part of the

expression (either , , or ) always appears in the null hypothesis. In selecting the proper
form of H0 and Ha, keep in mind that the alternative hypothesis is often what the test is
attempting to establish. Hence, asking whether the user is looking for evidence to support
μ  μ0, μ  μ0, or μ  μ0 will help determine Ha. The following exercises are designed to
provide practice in choosing the proper form for a hypothesis test involving a population mean.

rejection of H0 when Ha is true. Unfortunately, the correct conclusions are not always possible.
Because hypothesis tests are based on sample information, we must allow for the possibility
of errors. Table 9.1 illustrates the two kinds of errors that can be made in hypothesis testing.
The first row of Table 9.1 shows what can happen if the conclusion is to accept H0. If
H0 is true, this conclusion is correct. However, if Ha is true, we make a Type II error; that
is, we accept H0 when it is false. The second row of Table 9.1 shows what can happen if the
conclusion is to reject H0. If H0 is true, we make a Type I error; that is, we reject H0 when
it is true. However, if Ha is true, rejecting H0 is correct.
Recall the hypothesis testing illustration discussed in Section 9.1 in which an automobile
product research group developed a new fuel injection system designed to increase the
miles-per-gallon rating of a particular automobile. With the current model obtaining an
average of 24 miles per gallon, the hypothesis test was formulated as follows.
The alternative hypothesis, Ha: μ  24, indicates that the researchers are looking for sample
evidence to support the conclusion that the population mean miles per gallon with the new
fuel injection system is greater than 24.
In this application, the Type I error of rejecting H0 when it is true corresponds to the
researchers claiming that the new system improves the miles-per-gallon rating (μ  24)
when in fact the new system is not any better than the current system. In contrast, the 
Type II error of accepting H0 when it is false corresponds to the researchers concluding 
that the new system is not any better than the current system ( μ  24) when in fact the new
system improves miles-per-gallon performance.
For the miles-per-gallon rating hypothesis test, the null hypothesis is H0: μ  24. Sup-
pose the null hypothesis is true as an equality; that is, μ  24. The probability of making a
Type I error when the null hypothesis is true as an equality is called the level of signifi-
cance. Thus, for the miles-per-gallon rating hypothesis test, the level of significance is the
probability of rejecting H0: μ  24 when μ  24. Because of the importance of this
concept, we now restate the definition of level of significance.

ERRORS AND CORRECT CONCLUSIONS IN HYPOTHESIS TESTING
LEVEL OF SIGNIFICANCE
The level of significance is the probability of making a Type I error when the null
hypothesis is true as an equality.
The Greek symbol α (alpha) is used to denote the level of significance, and common choices
for α are .05 and .01.

In practice, the person responsible for the hypothesis test specifies the level of signifi-
cance. By selecting α, that person is controlling the probability of making a Type I error.
If the cost of making a Type I error is high, small values of α are preferred. If the cost of
making a Type I error is not too high, larger values of α are typically used. Applications of
hypothesis testing that only control for the Type I error are called significance tests. Many
applications of hypothesis testing are of this type.
Although most applications of hypothesis testing control for the probability of making
a Type I error, they do not always control for the probability of making a Type II error. Hence,
if we decide to accept H0, we cannot determine how confident we can be with that decision.
Because of the uncertainty associated with making a Type II error when conducting signifi-
cance tests, statisticians usually recommend that we use the statement “do not reject H0”
instead of “accept H0.” Using the statement “do not reject H0” carries the recommendation
to withhold both judgment and action. In effect, by not directly accepting H0, the statistician
avoids the risk of making a Type II error. Whenever the probability of making a Type II error
has not been determined and controlled, we will not make the statement “accept H0.” In such
cases, only two conclusions are possible: do not reject H0 or reject H0.
Although controlling for a Type II error in hypothesis testing is not common, it can be
done. More advanced texts describe procedures for determining and controlling the proba-
bility of making a Type II error.* If proper controls have been established for this error, ac-
tion based on the “accept H0” conclusion can be appropriate.

NOTES AND COMMENTS
Walter Williams, syndicated columnist and pro-
fessor of economics at George Mason University,
points out that the possibility of making a Type I
or a Type II error is always present in decision
making (The Cincinnati Enquirer, August 14,
2005). He notes that the Food and Drug Admin-
istration (FDA) runs the risk of making these
errors in its drug approval process. The FDA must
either approve a new drug or not approve it. Thus
the FDA runs the risk of approving a new drug that
is not safe and effective, or failing to approve a
new drug that is safe and effective. Regardless of
the decision made, the possibility of making a
costly error cannot be eliminated.

Population Mean: σ Known
In Chapter 8 we said that the σ known case corresponds to applications in which historical
data and/or other information are available that enable us to obtain a good estimate of the
population standard deviation prior to sampling. In such cases the population standard de-
viation can, for all practical purposes, be considered known. In this section we show how
to conduct a hypothesis test about a population mean for the σ known case.
The methods presented in this section are exact if the sample is selected from a popu-
lation that is normally distributed. In cases where it is not reasonable to assume the popu-
lation is normally distributed, these methods are still applicable if the sample size is large
enough. We provide some practical advice concerning the population distribution and the
sample size at the end of this section.
One-Tailed Test
One-tailed tests about a population mean take one of the following two forms.
Lower Tail Test
Upper Tail Test
Let us consider an example involving a lower tail test.
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) periodically conducts statistical studies designed
to test the claims that manufacturers make about their products. For example, the label on a
large can of Hilltop Coffee states that the can contains 3 pounds of coffee. The FTC knows
that Hilltop’s production process cannot place exactly 3 pounds of coffee in each can, even if
the mean filling weight for the population of all cans filled is 3 pounds per can. However, as
long as the population mean filling weight is at least 3 pounds per can, the rights of consumers
will be protected. Thus, the FTC interprets the label information on a large can of coffee as a
claim by Hilltop that the population mean filling weight is at least 3 pounds per can. We will
show how the FTC can check Hilltop’s claim by conducting a lower tail hypothesis test.
The first step is to develop the null and alternative hypotheses for the test. If the pop-
ulation mean filling weight is at least 3 pounds per can, Hilltop’s claim is correct. This
establishes the null hypothesis for the test. However, if the population mean weight is
less than 3 pounds per can, Hilltop’s claim is incorrect. This establishes the alternative

hypothesis. With μ denoting the population mean filling weight, the null and alternative
hypotheses are as follows:
Note that the hypothesized value of the population mean is μ0  3.
If the sample data indicate that H0 cannot be rejected, the statistical evidence does not
support the conclusion that a label violation has occurred. Hence, no action should be taken
against Hilltop. However, if the sample data indicate H0 can be rejected, we will conclude
that the alternative hypothesis, Ha: μ  3, is true. In this case a conclusion of underfilling
and a charge of a label violation against Hilltop would be justified.
Suppose a sample of 36 cans of coffee is selected and the sample mean is computed as
an estimate of the population mean μ. If the value of the sample mean is less than 3 pounds,
the sample results will cast doubt on the null hypothesis. What we want to know is how
much less than 3 pounds must be before we would be willing to declare the difference sig-
nificant and risk making a Type I error by falsely accusing Hilltop of a label violation. A
key factor in addressing this issue is the value the decision maker selects for the level of
significance.
As noted in the preceding section, the level of significance, denoted by α, is the proba-
bility of making a Type I error by rejecting H0 when the null hypothesis is true as an equality.
The decision maker must specify the level of significance. If the cost of making a Type I er-
ror is high, a small value should be chosen for the level of significance. If the cost is not
high, a larger value is more appropriate. In the Hilltop Coffee study, the director of the
FTC’s testing program made the following statement: “If the company is meeting its weight
specifications at μ  3, I do not want to take action against them. But, I am willing to risk
a 1% chance of making such an error.” From the director’s statement, we set the level of
significance for the hypothesis test at α  .01. Thus, we must design the hypothesis test so
that the probability of making a Type I error when μ  3 is .01.
For the Hilltop Coffee study, by developing the null and alternative hypotheses and
specifying the level of significance for the test, we carry out the first two steps required
in conducting every hypothesis test. We are now ready to perform the third step of
hypothesis testing: collect the sample data and compute the value of what is called a test
statistic.
Test statistic For the Hilltop Coffee study, previous FTC tests show that the population
standard deviation can be assumed known with a value of σ  .18. In addition, these
tests also show that the population of filling weights can be assumed to have a normal dis-
tribution. From the study of sampling distributions in Chapter 7 we know that if the popu-
lation from which we are sampling is normally distributed, the sampling distribution of
will also be normally distributed. Thus, for the Hilltop Coffee study, the sampling distri-
bution of
is normally distributed. With a known value of σ  .18 and a sample size of
n  36, Figure 9.1 shows the sampling distribution of

is a standard normal distribution. A value of z  1 means that the value of is one stan-
dard error below the hypothesized value of the mean, a value of z  2 means that the value
of is two standard errors below the hypothesized value of the mean, and so on. We can use
the standard normal probability table to find the lower tail probability corresponding to any
z value. For instance, the lower tail area at z  3.00 is .0013. Hence, the probability of ob-
taining a value of z that is three or more standard errors below the mean is .0013. As a re-
sult, the probability of obtaining a value of that is three or more standard errors below the
hypothesized population mean μ0  3 is also .0013. Such a result is unlikely if the null hy-
pothesis is true.
For hypothesis tests about a population mean in the σ known case, we use the standard
normal random variable z as a test statistic to determine whether deviates from the hy-
pothesized value of μ enough to justify rejecting the null hypothesis. With

The key question for a lower tail test is, How small must the test statistic z be before we
choose to reject the null hypothesis? Two approaches can be used to answer this question:
the p-value approach and the critical value approach.
p-value approach The p-value approach uses the value of the test statistic z to compute
a probability called a p-value.
The p-value is used to determine whether the null hypothesis should be rejected.

Population Mean: σ Known
355
Let us see how the p-value is computed and used. The value of the test statistic is
used to compute the p-value. The method used depends on whether the test is a lower
tail, an upper tail, or a two-tailed test. For a lower tail test, the p-value is the probability
of obtaining a value for the test statistic as small as or smaller than that provided by the
sample. Thus, to compute the p-value for the lower tail test in the σ known case, we must
find using the standard normal distribution, the probability that z is less than or equal to
the value of the test statistic. After computing the p-value, we must then decide whether
it is small enough to reject the null hypothesis; as we will show, this decision involves
comparing the p-value to the level of significance.
Let us now compute the p-value for the Hilltop Coffee lower tail test. Suppose the sam-
ple of 36 Hilltop coffee cans provides a sample mean of  2.92 pounds. Is  2.92 small
enough to cause us to reject H0? Because this is a lower tail test, the p-value is the area un-
der the standard normal curve for values of z  the value of the test statistic. Using 
 2.92, σ  .18, and n  36, we compute the value of the test statistic z.
Thus, the p-value is the probability that z is less than or equal to 2.67 (the lower tail area
corresponding to the value of the test statistic).
Using the standard normal probability table, we find that the lower tail area at z 
2.67 is .0038. Figure 9.2 shows that  2.92 corresponds to z  2.67 and a p-value 
.0038. This p-value indicates a small probability of obtaining a sample mean of  2.92
(and a test statistic of 2.67) or smaller when sampling from a population with μ  3. This

p-value does not provide much support for the null hypothesis, but is it small enough to
cause us to reject H0? The answer depends upon the level of significance for the test.
As noted previously, the director of the FTC’s testing program selected a value of .01
for the level of significance. The selection of α  .01 means that the director is willing to
tolerate a probability of .01 of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true as an equality
( μ0  3). The sample of 36 coffee cans in the Hilltop Coffee study resulted in a p-value 
.0038, which means that the probability of obtaining a value of  2.92 or less when the
null hypothesis is true as an equality is .0038. Because .0038 is less than or equal to α  .01,
we reject H0. Therefore, we find sufficient statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis
at the .01 level of significance.
We can now state the general rule for determining whether the null hypothesis can be
rejected when using the p-value approach. For a level of significance α, the rejection rule
using the p-value approach is as follows.

Chapter 9
Hypothesis Tests
In the Hilltop Coffee test, the p-value of .0038 resulted in the rejection of the null hy-
pothesis. Although the basis for making the rejection decision involves a comparison of the
p-value to the level of significance specified by the FTC director, the observed p-value of
.0038 means that we would reject H0 for any value of α  .0038. For this reason, the p-value
is also called the observed level of significance.
Different decision makers may express different opinions concerning the cost of mak-
ing a Type I error and may choose a different level of significance. By providing the p-value
as part of the hypothesis testing results, another decision maker can compare the reported
p-value to his or her own level of significance and possibly make a different decision with
respect to rejecting H0.
Critical value approach The critical value approach requires that we first determine a
value for the test statistic called the critical value. For a lower tail test, the critical value
serves as a benchmark for determining whether the value of the test statistic is small enough
to reject the null hypothesis. It is the value of the test statistic that corresponds to an area of
α (the level of significance) in the lower tail of the sampling distribution of the test statis-
tic. In other words, the critical value is the largest value of the test statistic that will result
in the rejection of the null hypothesis. Let us return to the Hilltop Coffee example and see
how this approach works.
In the σ known case, the sampling distribution for the test statistic z is a standard nor-
mal distribution. Therefore, the critical value is the value of the test statistic that corresponds
to an area of α  .01 in the lower tail of a standard normal distribution. Using the standard
normal probability table, we find that z  2.33 provides an area of .01 in the lower tail
(see Figure 9.3). Thus, if the sample results in a value of the test statistic that is less than or
equal to 2.33, the corresponding p-value will be less than or equal to .01; in this case, we
should reject the null hypothesis. Hence, for the Hilltop Coffee study the critical value re-
jection rule for a level of significance of .01 is
In the Hilltop Coffee example,  2.92 and the test statistic is z  2.67. Because z 
2.67  2.33, we can reject H0 and conclude that Hilltop Coffee is underfilling cans.

We can generalize the rejection rule for the critical value approach to handle any level
of significance. The rejection rule for a lower tail test follows.
Summary The p-value approach to hypothesis testing and the critical value approach will
always lead to the same rejection decision; that is, whenever the p-value is less than or equal
to α, the value of the test statistic will be less than or equal to the critical value. The ad-
vantage of the p-value approach is that the p-value tells us how significant the results are
(the observed level of significance). If we use the critical value approach, we only know
that the results are significant at the stated level of significance.
At the beginning of this section, we said that one-tailed tests about a population mean
take one of the following two forms:
Lower Tail Test
Upper Tail Test
We used the Hilltop Coffee study to illustrate how to conduct a lower tail test. We can use
the same general approach to conduct an upper tail test. The test statistic z is still com-
puted using equation (9.1). But, for an upper tail test, the p-value is the probability of ob-
taining a value for the test statistic as large as or larger than that provided by the sample.
Thus, to compute the p-value for the upper tail test in the σ known case, we must find
using the standard normal distribution, the probability that z is greater than or equal to the
value of the test statistic. Using the critical value approach causes us to reject the null hy-
pothesis if the value of the test statistic is greater than or equal to the critical value zα; in
other words, we reject H0 if z  zα.

Hypothesis Tests
COMPUTATION OF p-VALUES FOR ONE-TAILED TESTS
1. Compute the value of the test statistic using equation (9.1).
2. Lower tail test: Using the standard normal distribution, compute the proba-
bility that z is less than or equal to the value of the test statistic (area in the
lower tail).
3. Upper tail test: Using the standard normal distribution, compute the proba-
bility that z is greater than or equal to the value of the test statistic (area in the
upper tail).
Two-Tailed Test
In hypothesis testing, the general form for a two-tailed test about a population mean is
as follows:
In this subsection we show how to conduct a two-tailed test about a population mean for
the σ known case. As an illustration, we consider the hypothesis testing situation facing
MaxFlight, Inc.
The U.S. Golf Association (USGA) establishes rules that manufacturers of golf equipment
must meet if their products are to be acceptable for use in USGA events. MaxFlight uses a 
high-technology manufacturing process to produce golf balls with a mean driving distance of 
295 yards. Sometimes, however, the process gets out of adjustment and produces golf balls 
with a mean driving distance different from 295 yards. When the mean distance falls below 
295 yards, the company worries about losing sales because the golf balls do not provide as much
distance as advertised. When the mean distance passes 295 yards, MaxFlight’s golf balls may 
be rejected by the USGA for exceeding the overall distance standard concerning carry and roll.
MaxFlight’s quality control program involves taking periodic samples of 50 golf balls
to monitor the manufacturing process. For each sample, a hypothesis test is conducted to
determine whether the process has fallen out of adjustment. Let us develop the null and
alternative hypotheses. We begin by assuming that the process is functioning correctly; that
is, the golf balls being produced have a mean distance of 295 yards. This assumption
establishes the null hypothesis. The alternative hypothesis is that the mean distance is not
equal to 295 yards. With a hypothesized value of μ0  295, the null and alternative
hypotheses for the MaxFlight hypothesis test are as follows:
If the sample mean 
is significantly less than 295 yards or significantly greater than
295 yards, we will reject H0. In this case, corrective action will be taken to adjust the manu-
facturing process. On the other hand, if 
does not deviate from the hypothesized mean
μ0  295 by a significant amount, H0 will not be rejected and no action will be taken to
adjust the manufacturing process.
The quality control team selected α  .05 as the level of significance for the test. Data
from previous tests conducted when the process was known to be in adjustment show that

the population standard deviation can be assumed known with a value of σ  12. Thus, with
a sample size of n  50, the standard error of is
Because the sample size is large, the central limit theorem (see Chapter 7) allows us to
conclude that the sampling distribution of can be approximated by a normal distribution.
Figure 9.4 shows the sampling distribution of 
for the MaxFlight hypothesis test with a
hypothesized population mean of μ0  295.
Suppose that a sample of 50 golf balls is selected and that the sample mean is 

297.6 yards. This sample mean provides support for the conclusion that the population
mean is larger than 295 yards. Is this value of enough larger than 295 to cause us to reject
H0 at the .05 level of significance? In the previous section we described two approaches that
can be used to answer this question: the p-value approach and the critical value approach.
p-value approach Recall that the p-value is a probability used to determine whether 
the null hypothesis should be rejected. For a two-tailed test, values of the test statistic in
either tail provide evidence against the null hypothesis. For a two-tailed test, the p-value is

the probability of obtaining a value for the test statistic as unlikely as or more unlikely than
that provided by the sample. Let us see how the p-value is computed for the MaxFlight
hypothesis test.
First we compute the value of the test statistic. For the σ known case, the test statistic z
is a standard normal random variable. Using equation (9.1) with  297.6, the value of the
test statistic is
Now to compute the p-value we must find the probability of obtaining a value for the
test statistic at least as unlikely as z  1.53. Clearly values of z  1.53 are at least as
unlikely. But, because this is a two-tailed test, values of z  1.53 are also at least as
unlikely as the value of the test statistic provided by the sample. In Figure 9.5, we see
that the two-tailed p-value in this case is given by P(z  1.53) 	 P(z  1.53).
Because the normal curve is symmetric, we can compute this probability by finding the
upper tail area at z  1.53 and doubling it. The table for the standard normal distribu-
tion shows that p(z  1.53) is .9370. Thus, p(z  1.53) is 1.0000  .9370  .0630.
Doubling this, we find the p-value for the MaxFlight two-tailed hypothesis test is 
p-value  2(.0630)  .1260.
Next we compare the p-value to the level of significance to see whether the null
hypothesis should be rejected. With a level of significance of α  .05, we do not reject H0
because the p-value  .1260  .05. Because the null hypothesis is not rejected, no action
will be taken to adjust the MaxFlight manufacturing process.
Let us summarize the steps involved in computing p-values for two-tailed hypothesis tests.

Step 4. Use the value of the test statistic to compute the p-value.
Step 5. Reject H0 if the p-value  α.
Critical Value Approach
Step 4. Use the level of significance to determine the critical value and the
rejection rule.
Step 5. Use the value of the test statistic and the rejection rule to determine
whether to reject H0.
Critical value approach Before leaving this section, let us see how the test statistic z can
be compared to a critical value to make the hypothesis testing decision for a two-tailed test.
Figure 9.6 shows that the critical values for the test will occur in both the lower and upper
tails of the standard normal distribution. With a level of significance of α  .05, the area in
each tail corresponding to the critical values is α/2  .05/2  .025. Using the standard nor-
mal probability table, we find the critical values for the test statistic are z.025  1.96 and
z.025  1.96. Thus, using the critical value approach, the two-tailed rejection rule is
Because the value of the test statistic for the MaxFlight study is z  1.53, the statistical
evidence will not permit us to reject the null hypothesis at the .05 level of significance.
Summary and Practical Advice
We presented examples of a lower tail test and a two-tailed test about a population mean.
Based upon these examples, we can now summarize the hypothesis testing procedures
about a population mean for the σ known case as shown in Table 9.2. Note that μ0 is the
hypothesized value of the population mean.
The hypothesis testing steps followed in the two examples presented in this section are
common to every hypothesis test.

Practical advice about the sample size for hypothesis tests is similar to the advice we pro-
vided about the sample size for interval estimation in Chapter 8. In most applications, a sam-
ple size of n  30 is adequate when using the hypothesis testing procedure described in this
section. In cases where the sample size is less than 30, the distribution of the population from
which we are sampling becomes an important consideration. If the population is normally
distributed, the hypothesis testing procedure that we described is exact and can be used for
any sample size. If the population is not normally distributed but is at least roughly sym-
metric, sample sizes as small as 15 can be expected to provide acceptable results.
Relationship Between Interval Estimation 
and Hypothesis Testing
In Chapter 8 we showed how to develop a confidence interval estimate of a population
mean. For the σ known case, the (1  α)% confidence interval estimate of a population
mean is given by
In this section, we showed that a two-tailed hypothesis test about a population mean
takes the following form:
where μ0 is the hypothesized value for the population mean.
Suppose that we follow the procedure described in Chapter 8 for constructing a 
100(1  α)% confidence interval for the population mean.We know that 100(1  α)% of
the confidence intervals generated will contain the population mean and 100α% of the con-
fidence intervals generated will not contain the population mean. Thus, if we reject H0 when-
ever the confidence interval does not contain μ0, we will be rejecting the null hypothesis
when it is true (μ  μ0) with probability α. Recall that the level of significance is the prob-
ability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. So constructing a 100(1  α)% con-
fidence interval and rejecting H0 whenever the interval does not contain μ0 is equivalent to
conducting a two-tailed hypothesis test with α as the level of significance. The procedure for
using a confidence interval to conduct a two-tailed hypothesis test can now be summarized.

Let us illustrate by conducting the MaxFlight hypothesis test using the confidence
interval approach. The MaxFlight hypothesis test takes the following form:
To test these hypotheses with a level of significance of α  .05, we sampled 50 golf balls
and found a sample mean distance of  297.6 yards. Recall that the population standard
deviation is σ  12. Using these results with z.025  1.96, we find that the 95% confidence
interval estimate of the population mean is
or
This finding enables the quality control manager to conclude with 95% confidence that
the mean distance for the population of golf balls is between 294.3 and 300.9 yards.
Because the hypothesized value for the population mean, μ0  295, is in this interval, the
hypothesis testing conclusion is that the null hypothesis, H0: μ  295, cannot be rejected.
Note that this discussion and example pertain to two-tailed hypothesis tests about a
population mean. However, the same confidence interval and two-tailed hypothesis testing
relationship exists for other population parameters. The relationship can also be extended
to one-tailed tests about population parameters. Doing so, however, requires the develop-
ment of one-sided confidence intervals, which are rarely used in practice.

Exercises
Note to Student: Some of the exercises that follow ask you to use the p-value approach 
and others ask you to use the critical value approach. Both methods will provide the same
hypothesis testing conclusion. We provide exercises with both methods to give you prac-
tice using both. In later sections and in following chapters, we will generally emphasize
the p-value approach as the preferred method, but you may select either based on personal
preference.

NOTES AND COMMENTS
We have shown how to use p-values. The smaller
the p-value the greater the evidence against H0 and
the more the evidence in favor of Ha. Here are some
guidelines statisticians suggest for interpreting
small p-values.
•
Less than .01—Overwhelming evidence to
conclude Ha is true.
•
Between .01 and .05—Strong evidence to
conclude Ha is true.
•
Between .05 and .10—Weak evidence to
conclude Ha is true.
•
Greater than .10—Insufficient evidence to
conclude Ha is true.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) provides a toll-free help line for taxpayers to call in
and get answers to questions as they prepare their tax returns. In recent years, the IRS
has been inundated with taxpayer calls and has redesigned its phone service as well as
posted answers to frequently asked questions on its website (The Cincinnati Enquirer,
January 7, 2010). According to a report by a taxpayer advocate, callers using the new
system can expect to wait on hold for an unreasonably long time of 12 minutes before
being able to talk to an IRS employee. Suppose you select a sample of 50 callers after
the new phone service has been implemented; the sample results show a mean waiting
time of 10 minutes before an IRS employee comes on the line. Based upon data from
past years, you decide it is reasonable to assume that the standard deviation of waiting
time is 8 minutes. Using your sample results, can you conclude that the actual mean
waiting time turned out to be significantly less than the 12-minute claim made by the
taxpayer advocate? Use   .05.

9.4
Population Mean: σ Unknown
In this section we describe how to conduct hypothesis tests about a population mean for 
the σ unknown case. Because the σ unknown case corresponds to situations in which an
estimate of the population standard deviation cannot be developed prior to sampling, the
sample must be used to develop an estimate of both μ and σ. Thus, to conduct a hypothesis
test about a population mean for the σ unknown case, the sample mean is used as an es-
timate of μ and the sample standard deviation s is used as an estimate of σ.
The steps of the hypothesis testing procedure for the σ unknown case are the same as
those for the σ known case described in Section 9.3. But, with σ unknown, the computation
of the test statistic and p-value is a bit different. Recall that for the σ known case, the sam-
pling distribution of the test statistic has a standard normal distribution. For the σ unknown
case, however, the sampling distribution of the test statistic follows the t distribution; it has
slightly more variability because the sample is used to develop estimates of both μ and σ.
In Section 8.2 we showed that an interval estimate of a population mean for the σ
unknown case is based on a probability distribution known as the t distribution. Hypothesis
tests about a population mean for the σ unknown case are also based on the t distribution. For
the σ unknown case, the test statistic has a t distribution with n  1 degrees of freedom.
x¯
In Chapter 8 we said that the t distribution is based on an assumption that the popula-
tion from which we are sampling has a normal distribution. However, research shows that
this assumption can be relaxed considerably when the sample size is large enough. We pro-
vide some practical advice concerning the population distribution and sample size at the
end of the section.
One-Tailed Test
Let us consider an example of a one-tailed test about a population mean for the σ unknown
case. A business travel magazine wants to classify transatlantic gateway airports according
to the mean rating for the population of business travelers. A rating scale with a low score
of 0 and a high score of 10 will be used, and airports with a population mean rating greater
than 7 will be designated as superior service airports. The magazine staff surveyed a sample
of 60 business travelers at each airport to obtain the ratings data. The sample for London’s
Heathrow Airport provided a sample mean rating of  7.25 and a sample standard devia-
tion of s  1.052. Do the data indicate that Heathrow should be designated as a superior
service airport?
We want to develop a hypothesis test for which the decision to reject H0 will lead to the
conclusion that the population mean rating for the Heathrow Airport is greater than 7. Thus,
an upper tail test with Ha: μ  7 is required. The null and alternative hypotheses for this up-
per tail test are as follows:
We will use α  .05 as the level of significance for the test.

The sampling distribution of t has n  1  60  1  59 degrees of freedom. Because the

ing to the value of the test statistic.
The t distribution table provided in most textbooks will not contain sufficient detail to
determine the exact p-value, such as the p-value corresponding to t  1.84. For instance,

lowing information.

We see that t  1.84 is between 1.671 and 2.001. Although the table does not provide the
exact p-value, the values in the “Area in Upper Tail” row show that the p-value must be less
than .05 and greater than .025. With a level of significance of α  .05, this placement is all
we need to know to make the decision to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that
Heathrow should be classified as a superior service airport.
Because it is cumbersome to use a t table to compute p-values, and only approximate
values are obtained, we show how to compute the exact p-value using Excel or Minitab. The
directions can be found in Appendix F at the end of this text. Using Excel or Minitab with 
t  1.84 provides the upper tail p-value of .0354 for the Heathrow Airport hypothesis test.
With .0354  .05, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that Heathrow should be clas-
sified as a superior service airport.
Two-Tailed Test
To illustrate how to conduct a two-tailed test about a population mean for the σ unknown
case, let us consider the hypothesis testing situation facing Holiday Toys. The company
manufactures and distributes its products through more than 1000 retail outlets. In planning
production levels for the coming winter season, Holiday must decide how many units of
each product to produce prior to knowing the actual demand at the retail level. For this
year’s most important new toy, Holiday’s marketing director is expecting demand to aver-
age 40 units per retail outlet. Prior to making the final production decision based upon this
estimate, Holiday decided to survey a sample of 25 retailers in order to develop more in-
formation about the demand for the new product. Each retailer was provided with informa-
tion about the features of the new toy along with the cost and the suggested selling price.
Then each retailer was asked to specify an anticipated order quantity.
With μ denoting the population mean order quantity per retail outlet, the sample data
will be used to conduct the following two-tailed hypothesis test:
H0:
Ha: μ  40

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

If H0 cannot be rejected, Holiday will continue its production planning based on the mar-
keting director’s estimate that the population mean order quantity per retail outlet will be
μ  40 units. However, if H0 is rejected, Holiday will immediately reevaluate its produc-
tion plan for the product. A two-tailed hypothesis test is used because Holiday wants to
reevaluate the production plan if the population mean quantity per retail outlet is less than
anticipated or greater than anticipated. Because no historical data are available (it’s a new
product), the population mean μ and the population standard deviation must both be esti-
mated using and s from the sample data.
The sample of 25 retailers provided a mean of  37.4 and a standard deviation of
s  11.79 units. Before going ahead with the use of the t distribution, the analyst con-
structed a histogram of the sample data in order to check on the form of the population dis-
tribution. The histogram of the sample data showed no evidence of skewness or any extreme
outliers, so the analyst concluded that the use of the t distribution with n  1  24 degrees
of freedom was appropriate. Using equation (9.2) with  37.4, μ0  40, s  11.79, and
n  25, the value of the test statistic is
Because we have a two-tailed test, the p-value is two times the area under the curve of
the t distribution for t  1.10. Using Table 2 in Appendix B, we see that the t distribution
table for 24 degrees of freedom provides the following information.

The t distribution table contains only positive t values. Because the t distribution is
symmetric, however, the upper tail area at t  1.10 is the same as the lower tail area at 
t  1.10. We see that t  1.10 is between 0.857 and 1.318. From the “Area in Upper
Tail” row, we see that the area in the tail to the right of t  1.10 is between .20 and .10.
When we double these amounts, we see that the p-value must be between .40 and .20. With
a level of significance of α  .05, we now know that the p-value is greater than α. There-
fore, H0 cannot be rejected. Sufficient evidence is not available to conclude that Holiday
should change its production plan for the coming season.
Appendix F shows how the p-value for this test can be computed using Excel or
Minitab. The p-value obtained is .2822. With a level of significance of α  .05, we cannot
reject H0 because .2822  .05.
The test statistic can also be compared to the critical value to make the two-tailed hy-
pothesis testing decision. With α  .05 and the t distribution with 24 degrees of freedom,
t.025  2.064 and t.025  2.064 are the critical values for the two-tailed test. The rejec-
tion rule using the test statistic is
Based on the test statistic t  1.10, H0 cannot be rejected. This result indicates that Holi-
day should continue its production planning for the coming season based on the expecta-
tion that μ  40.

Summary and Practical Advice
Table 9.3 provides a summary of the hypothesis testing procedures about a population mean
for the σ unknown case. The key difference between these procedures and the ones for the
σ known case is that s is used, instead of σ, in the computation of the test statistic. For this
reason, the test statistic follows the t distribution.
The applicability of the hypothesis testing procedures of this section is dependent on
the distribution of the population being sampled from and the sample size. When the popu-
lation is normally distributed, the hypothesis tests described in this section provide exact
results for any sample size. When the population is not normally distributed, the procedures
are approximations. Nonetheless, we find that sample sizes of 30 or greater will provide
good results in most cases. If the population is approximately normal, small sample sizes
(e.g., n  15) can provide acceptable results. If the population is highly skewed or contains
outliers, sample sizes approaching 50 are recommended.

Population Proportion
In this section we show how to conduct a hypothesis test about a population proportion p.
Using p0 to denote the hypothesized value for the population proportion, the three forms for
a hypothesis test about a population proportion are as follows.
The first form is called a lower tail test, the second form is called an upper tail test, and the
third form is called a two-tailed test.
Hypothesis tests about a population proportion are based on the difference between the
sample proportion 
and the hypothesized population proportion p0. The methods used to
conduct the hypothesis test are similar to those used for hypothesis tests about a population
mean. The only difference is that we use the sample proportion and its standard error to
compute the test statistic. The p-value approach or the critical value approach is then used
to determine whether the null hypothesis should be rejected.
Let us consider an example involving a situation faced by Pine Creek golf course. Over
the past year, 20% of the players at Pine Creek were women. In an effort to increase the
proportion of women players, Pine Creek implemented a special promotion designed to at-
tract women golfers. One month after the promotion was implemented, the course man-
ager requested a statistical study to determine whether the proportion of women players at
Pine Creek had increased. Because the objective of the study is to determine whether the
proportion of women golfers increased, an upper tail test with Ha: p  .20 is appropriate.
The null and alternative hypotheses for the Pine Creek hypothesis test are as follows:
If H0 can be rejected, the test results will give statistical support for the conclusion that the
proportion of women golfers increased and the promotion was beneficial. The course man-
ager specified that a level of significance of α  .05 be used in carrying out this hypoth-
esis test.
The next step of the hypothesis testing procedure is to select a sample and compute 
the value of an appropriate test statistic. To show how this step is done for the Pine Creek upper
tail test, we begin with a general discussion of how to compute the value of the test statistic for
any form of a hypothesis test about a population proportion. The sampling distribution of ,
the point estimator of the population parameter p, is the basis for developing the test statistic.
When the null hypothesis is true as an equality, the expected value of 
equals the hy-
pothesized value p0; that is, E( )  p0. The standard error of 
is given by
In Chapter 7 we said that if np  5 and n(1  p)  5, the sampling distribution of can be
approximated by a normal distribution.3 Under these conditions, which usually apply in
practice, the quantity

3In most applications involving hypothesis tests of a population proportion, sample sizes are large enough to use the nor-
mal approximation. The exact sampling distribution of p_ is discrete, with the probability for each value of p_ given by the
binomial distribution. So hypothesis testing is a bit more complicated for small samples when the normal approximation
cannot be used.

CALCULATION OF THE p-VALUE FOR THE PINE CREEK HYPOTHESIS TEST
We can now compute the test statistic for the Pine Creek hypothesis test. Suppose a ran-
dom sample of 400 players was selected, and that 100 of the players were women. The pro-
portion of women golfers in the sample is
Using equation (9.4), the value of the test statistic is
Because the Pine Creek hypothesis test is an upper tail test, the p-value is the probability
that z is greater than or equal to z  2.50; that is, it is the upper tail area corresponding to
z  2.50. Using the standard normal probability table, we find that the lower tail area for
z  2.50 is .9938. Thus, the p-value for the Pine Creek test is 1.0000  .9938  .0062.
Figure 9.7 shows this p-value calculation.
Recall that the course manager specified a level of significance of α  .05. A p-value 
.0062  .05 gives sufficient statistical evidence to reject H0 at the .05 level of significance.

TABLE 9.4
SUMMARY OF HYPOTHESIS TESTS ABOUT A POPULATION PROPORTION
Thus, the test provides statistical support for the conclusion that the special promotion
increased the proportion of women players at the Pine Creek golf course.
The decision whether to reject the null hypothesis can also be made using the critical
value approach. The critical value corresponding to an area of .05 in the upper tail of a nor-
mal probability distribution is z.05  1.645. Thus, the rejection rule using the critical value
approach is to reject H0 if z  1.645. Because z  2.50  1.645, H0 is rejected.
Again, we see that the p-value approach and the critical value approach lead to the same
hypothesis testing conclusion, but the p-value approach provides more information. With a
p-value  .0062, the null hypothesis would be rejected for any level of significance greater
than or equal to .0062.
Summary
The procedure used to conduct a hypothesis test about a population proportion is similar to
the procedure used to conduct a hypothesis test about a population mean. Although we only
illustrated how to conduct a hypothesis test about a population proportion for an upper tail
test, similar procedures can be used for lower tail and two-tailed tests. Table 9.4 provides a
summary of the hypothesis tests about a population proportion. We assume that np  5 and
n(1  p)  5; thus the normal probability distribution can be used to approximate the sam-
pling distribution of .

Summary
Hypothesis testing is a statistical procedure that uses sample data to determine whether a
statement about the value of a population parameter should or should not be rejected. The
hypotheses are two competing statements about a population parameter. One statement is
called the null hypothesis (H0), and the other statement is called the alternative hypothesis
(Ha). In Section 9.1 we provided guidelines for developing hypotheses for situations fre-
quently encountered in practice.
Whenever historical data or other information provide a basis for assuming that the pop-
ulation standard deviation is known, the hypothesis testing procedure for the population
mean is based on the standard normal distribution. Whenever σ is unknown, the sample
standard deviation s is used to estimate σ and the hypothesis testing procedure is based on
the t distribution. In both cases, the quality of results depends on both the form of the pop-
ulation distribution and the sample size. If the population has a normal distribution, both
hypothesis testing procedures are applicable, even with small sample sizes. If the popula-
tion is not normally distributed, larger sample sizes are needed. General guidelines about
the sample size were provided in Sections 9.3 and 9.4. In the case of hypothesis tests about
a population proportion, the hypothesis testing procedure uses a test statistic based on the
standard normal distribution.
In all cases, the value of the test statistic can be used to compute a p-value for the test.
A p-value is a probability used to determine whether the null hypothesis should be rejected.
If the p-value is less than or equal to the level of significance α, the null hypothesis can be
rejected.
Hypothesis testing conclusions can also be made by comparing the value of the test sta-
tistic to a critical value. For lower tail tests, the null hypothesis is rejected if the value of the
test statistic is less than or equal to the critical value. For upper tail tests, the null hypothe-
sis is rejected if the value of the test statistic is greater than or equal to the critical value.
Two-tailed tests consist of two critical values: one in the lower tail of the sampling distri-
bution and one in the upper tail. In this case, the null hypothesis is rejected if the value of
the test statistic is less than or equal to the critical value in the lower tail or greater than or
equal to the critical value in the upper tail.

Test statistic A statistic whose value helps determine whether a null hypothesis should be
rejected.
p-value A probability that provides a measure of the evidence against the null hypothesis
given by the sample. Smaller p-values indicate more evidence against H0. For a lower tail
test, the p-value is the probability of obtaining a value for the test statistic as small as or
smaller than that provided by the sample. For an upper tail test, the p-value is the probabil-
ity of obtaining a value for the test statistic as large as or larger than that provided by the
sample. For a two-tailed test, the p-value is the probability of obtaining a value for the test
statistic at least as unlikely as or more unlikely than that provided by the sample.

sample of 20 economists taken Thursday afternoon provided a sample mean of 266,000
with a sample standard deviation of 24,000. Financial analysts often call such a sample
mean, based on late-breaking news, the whisper number. Treat the “consensus estimate” as
the population mean. Conduct a hypothesis test to determine whether the whisper number
justifies a conclusion of a statistically significant increase in the consensus estimate of
economists. Use α  .01 as the level of significance.

Suppose the AAII poll used a sample size of 450. Using .39 (the long-term average) as the
population proportion of investors who are bullish, conduct a hypothesis test to determine
if the current proportion of investors who are bullish is significantly greater than the long-
term average proportion.
a.
State the appropriate hypotheses for your significance test.
b.
Use the sample results to compute the test statistic and the p-value.
c.
Using   .10, what is your conclusion?

Virtual call centers are staffed by individuals working out of their homes. Most home
agents earn $10 to $15 per hour without benefits versus $7 to $9 per hour with benefits at
a traditional call center (BusinessWeek, January 23, 2006). Regional Airways is consider-
ing employing home agents, but only if a level of customer satisfaction greater than 80%
can be maintained. Atest was conducted with home service agents. In a sample of 300 cus-
tomers, 252 reported that they were satisfied with service.
a.
Develop hypotheses for a test to determine whether the sample data support the con-
clusion that customer service with home agents meets the Regional Airways criterion.
b.
What is your point estimate of the percentage of satisfied customers?
c.
What is the p-value provided by the sample data?
d.
What is your hypothesis testing conclusion? Use α  .05 as the level of significance.

During the 2004 election year, new polling results were reported daily. In an IBD/TIPP
poll of 910 adults, 503 respondents reported that they were optimistic about the national
outlook, and President Bush’s leadership index jumped 4.7 points to 55.3 (Investor’s Busi-
ness Daily, January 14, 2004).
a.
What is the sample proportion of respondents who are optimistic about the national
outlook?
b.
A campaign manager wants to claim that this poll indicates that the majority of adults
are optimistic about the national outlook. Construct a hypothesis test so that rejection
of the null hypothesis will permit the conclusion that the proportion optimistic is
greater than 50%.
c.
Use the polling data to compute the p-value for the hypothesis test in part (b). 
Explain to the manager what this p-value means about the level of significance of the
results.

Case Problem 1 Quality Associates, Inc.
Quality Associates, Inc., a consulting firm, advises its clients about sampling and statistical
procedures that can be used to control their manufacturing processes. In one particular ap-
plication, a client gave Quality Associates a sample of 800 observations taken during a time
in which that client’s process was operating satisfactorily. The sample standard deviation 
for these data was .21; hence, with so much data, the population standard deviation was as-
sumed to be .21. Quality Associates then suggested that random samples of size 30 be taken
periodically to monitor the process on an ongoing basis. By analyzing the new samples, the
client could quickly learn whether the process was operating satisfactorily. When the
process was not operating satisfactorily, corrective action could be taken to eliminate the
problem. The design specification indicated the mean for the process should be 12. The hy-
pothesis test suggested by Quality Associates follows.
Corrective action will be taken anytime H0 is rejected.
The following samples were collected at hourly intervals during the first day of opera-
tion of the new statistical process control procedure. These data are available in the data set

Managerial Report
1. Conduct a hypothesis test for each sample at the .01 level of significance and de-
termine what action, if any, should be taken. Provide the test statistic and p-value
for each test.
2. Compute the standard deviation for each of the four samples. Does the assumption
of .21 for the population standard deviation appear reasonable?
3. Compute limits for the sample mean 
around μ  12 such that, as long as a new
sample mean is within those limits, the process will be considered to be operating
satisfactorily. If exceeds the upper limit or if is below the lower limit, corrective
action will be taken. These limits are referred to as upper and lower control limits
for quality control purposes.
4. Discuss the implications of changing the level of significance to a larger value. What
mistake or error could increase if the level of significance is increased?
Case Problem 2 Ethical Behavior of Business Students at
Bayview Universtiy
During the global recession of 2008 and 2009, there were many accusations of unethical
behavior by Wall Street executives, financial managers, and other corporate officers. At that
time, an article appeared that suggested that part of the reason for such unethical business
behavior may stem from the fact that cheating has become more prevalent among business
students (Chronicle of Higher Education, February 10, 2009). The article reported that 56%
of business students admitted to cheating at some time during their academic career as com-
pared to 47% of nonbusiness students.
Cheating has been a concern of the dean of the College of Business at Bayview Uni-
versity for several years. Some faculty members in the college believe that cheating is more
widespread at Bayview than at other universities, while other faculty members think that
cheating is not a major problem in the college. To resolve some of these issues, the dean
commissioned a study to assess the current ethical behavior of business students at Bayview.
As part of this study, an anonymous exit survey was administered to a sample of 90 busi-
ness students from this year’s graduating class. Responses to the following questions were
used to obtain data regarding three types of cheating.

Managerial Report
Prepare a report for the dean of the college that summarizes your assessment of the nature
of cheating by business students at Bayview University. Be sure to include the following
items in your report.
1. Use descriptive statistics to summarize the data and comment on your findings.
2. Develop 95% confidence intervals for the proportion of all students, the proportion
of male students, and the proportion of female students who were involved in some
type of cheating.
3. Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the proportion of business students at
Bayview University who were involved in some type of cheating is less than that of
business students at other institutions as reported by the Chronicle of Higher
Education.
4. Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the proportion of business students at
Bayview University who were involved in some form of cheating is less than that
of nonbusiness students at other institutions as reported by the Chronicle of Higher
Education.
5. What advice would you give to the dean based upon your analysis of the data?

Appendix 9.1 Hypothesis Testing Using Minitab
We describe the use of Minitab to conduct hypothesis tests about a population mean and a
population proportion.
Population Mean: σ Known
We illustrate using the MaxFlight golf ball distance example in Section 9.3. The data are in
column C1 of a Minitab worksheet. The population standard deviation σ  12 is assumed
known and the level of significance is α  .05. The following steps can be used to test the
hypothesis H0: μ  295 versus Ha: μ  295.
Step 1. Select the Stat menu
Step 2. Choose Basic Statistics
Step 3. Choose 1-Sample Z
Step 4. When the 1-Sample Z (Test and Confidence Interval) dialog box appears:
Enter C1 in the Samples in columns box
Enter 12 in the Standard deviation box
Select Perform Hypothesis Test
Enter 295 in the Hypothesized mean box
Select Options
Step 5. When the 1-Sample Z-Options dialog box appears:
Enter 95 in the Confidence level box*
Select not equal in the Alternative box
Click OK
Step 6. Click OK
In addition to the hypothesis testing results, Minitab provides a 95% confidence interval for
the population mean.
The procedure can be easily modified for a one-tailed hypothesis test by selecting the
less than or greater than option in the Alternative box in step 5.
Population Mean: σ Unknown
The ratings that 60 business travelers gave for Heathrow Airport are entered in column C1
of a Minitab worksheet. The level of significance for the test is α  .05, and the population
standard deviation σ will be estimated by the sample standard deviation s. The following
steps can be used to test the hypothesis H0: μ  7 against Ha: μ  7.
Step 1. Select the Stat menu
Step 2. Choose Basic Statistics
Step 3. Choose 1-Sample t
Step 4. When the 1-Sample t (Test and Confidence Interval) dialog box appears:
Enter C1 in the Samples in columns box
Select Perform Hypothesis Test
Enter 7 in the Hypothesized mean box
Select Options
Step 5. When the 1-Sample t-options dialog box appears:
Enter 95 in the Confidence level box
Select greater than in the Alternative box
Click OK
Step 6. Click OK
*Minitab provides both hypothesis testing and interval estimation results simultaneously. The user may select any confidence
level for the interval estimate of the population mean: 95% confidence is suggested here.

Chapter 9
Hypothesis Tests
The Heathrow Airport rating study involved a greater than alternative hypothesis. The
preceding steps can be easily modified for other hypothesis tests by selecting the less than
or not equal options in the Alternative box in step 5.
Population Proportion
We illustrate using the Pine Creek golf course example in Section 9.5. The data with re-
sponses Female and Male are in column C1 of a Minitab worksheet. Minitab uses an alpha-
betical ordering of the responses and selects the second response for the population
proportion of interest. In this example, Minitab uses the alphabetical ordering Female-Male
to provide results for the population proportion of Male responses. Because Female is the
response of interest, we change Minitab’s ordering as follows: Select any cell in the column
and use the sequence: Editor  Column  Value Order. Then choose the option of enter-
ing a user-specified order. Enter Male-Female in the Define-an-order box and click OK.
Minitab’s 1 Proportion routine will then provide the hypothesis test results for the popula-
tion proportion of female golfers. We proceed as follows:
Step 1. Select the Stat menu
Step 2. Choose Basic Statistics
Step 3. Choose 1 Proportion
Step 4. When the 1 Proportion (Test and Confidence Interval) dialog box appears:
Enter C1 in the Samples in Columns box
Select Perform Hypothesis Test
Enter .20 in the Hypothesized proportion box
Select Options
Step 5. When the 1 Proportion-Options dialog box appears:
Enter 95 in the Confidence level box
Select greater than in the Alternative box
Select Use test and interval based on normal distribution
Click OK
Step 6. Click OK
Appendix 9.2 Hypothesis Testing Using Excel
Excel does not provide built-in routines for the hypothesis tests presented in this chapter.
To handle these situations, we present Excel worksheets that we designed to use as tem-
plates for testing hypotheses about a population mean and a population proportion. The
worksheets are easy to use and can be modified to handle any sample data. The worksheets
are available on the website that accompanies this book.
Population Mean: σ Known
We illustrate using the MaxFlight golf ball distance example in Section 9.3. The data are in
column A of an Excel worksheet. The population standard deviation σ  12 is assumed
known and the level of significance is α  .05. The following steps can be used to test the
hypothesis H0: μ  295 versus Ha: μ  295.
Refer to Figure 9.8 as we describe the procedure. The worksheet in the background
shows the cell formulas used to compute the results shown in the foreground worksheet.
The data are entered into cells A2:A51. The following steps are necessary to use the tem-
plate for this data set.

Hypothesis Tests
two-tailed test, the p-value (Two Tail) in cell D15 is used to make the rejection decision.
With p-value  .1255  α  .05, the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. The p-values in
cells D13 or D14 would be used if the hypotheses involved a one-tailed test.
This template can be used to make hypothesis testing computations for other applica-
tions. For instance, to conduct a hypothesis test for a new data set, enter the new sample
data into column Aof the worksheet. Modify the formulas in cells D4 and D5 to correspond
to the new data range. Enter the population standard deviation into cell D6 and the hypoth-
esized value for the population mean into cell D8 to obtain the results. If the new sample
data have already been summarized, the new sample data do not have to be entered into the
worksheet. In this case, enter the sample size into cell D4, the sample mean into cell D5,
the population standard deviation into cell D6, and the hypothesized value for the popula-
tion mean into cell D8 to obtain the results. The worksheet in Figure 9.8 is available in the
file Hyp Sigma Known on the website that accompanies this book.
Population Mean: σ Unknown
We illustrate using the Heathrow Airport rating example in Section 9.4. The data are in col-
umn A of an Excel worksheet. The population standard deviation σ is unknown and will be
estimated by the sample standard deviation s. The level of significance is α  .05. The fol-
lowing steps can be used to test the hypothesis H0: μ  7 versus Ha: μ  7.
Refer to Figure 9.9 as we describe the procedure. The background worksheet 
shows the cell formulas used to compute the results shown in the foreground version of 
the worksheet. The data are entered into cells A2:A61. The following steps are necessary to
use the template for this data set.
Step 1. Enter the data range A2:A61 into the COUNT cell formula in cell D4
Step 2. Enter the data range A2:A61 into the AVERAGE cell formula in cell D5
Step 3. Enter the data range A2:A61 into the STDEV cell formula in cell D6
Step 4. Enter the hypothesized value for the population mean 7 into cell D8
The remaining cell formulas automatically provide the standard error, the value of the test sta-
tistic t, the number of degrees of freedom, and three p-values. Because the alternative hypoth-
esis (μ  7) indicates an upper tail test, the p-value (Upper Tail) in cell D15 is used to make
the decision. With p-value  .0353  α  .05, the null hypothesis is rejected. The p-values in
cells D14 or D16 would be used if the hypotheses involved a lower tail test or a two-tailed test.
This template can be used to make hypothesis testing computations for other applications.
For instance, to conduct a hypothesis test for a new data set, enter the new sample data into
column A of the worksheet and modify the formulas in cells D4, D5, and D6 to correspond to
the new data range. Enter the hypothesized value for the population mean into cell D8 to ob-
tain the results. If the new sample data have already been summarized, the new sample data do
not have to be entered into the worksheet. In this case, enter the sample size into cell D4, the
sample mean into cell D5, the sample standard deviation into cell D6, and the hypothesized
value for the population mean into cell D8 to obtain the results. The worksheet in Figure 9.9 is
available in the file Hyp Sigma Unknown on the website that accompanies this book.
Population Proportion
We illustrate using the Pine Creek golf course survey data presented in Section 9.5.
The data of Male or Female golfer are in column A of an Excel worksheet. Refer to
Figure 9.10 as we describe the procedure. The background worksheet shows the cell for-
mulas used to compute the results shown in the foreground worksheet. The data are
entered into cells A2:A401. The following steps can be used to test the hypothesis H0:
p  .20 versus Ha: p  .20.

Appendix 9.3 Hypothesis Testing Using StatTools
In this appendix we show how StatTools can be used to conduct hypothesis tests about a
population mean for the σ unknown case and about a population proportion.
Population Mean: σ Unknown Case
In this case the population standard deviation σ will be estimated by the sample standard
deviation s. We use the example discussed in Section 9.4 involving ratings that 60 business
travelers gave for Heathrow Airport.
Begin by using the Data Set Manager to create a StatTools data set for these data using
the procedure described in the appendix in Chapter 1. The following steps can be used to
test the hypothesis H0: μ  7 against Ha: μ  7.
Step 1. Click the StatTools tab on the Ribbon
Step 2. In the Analyses group, click Statistical Inference
Step 3. Choose the Hypothesis Test option
Step 4. Choose Mean/Std. Deviation
Step 5. When the StatTools—Hypothesis Test for Mean/Std. Deviation dialog box 
appears:
For Analysis Type, choose One-Sample Analysis
In the Variables section, select Rating
In the Hypothesis Tests to Perform section:
Select the Mean option
Enter 7in the Null Hypothesis Value box
Select Greater Than Null Value (One-Tailed Test) in the Alternative 
Hypothesis box
If selected, remove the check in the Standard Deviation box
Click OK
The results from the hypothesis test will appear. They include the p-value and the value of
the test statistic.
Population Proportion
We illustrate using the Pine Creek golf course example in Section 9.5. Begin by using the
Data Set Manager to create a StatTools data set for these data using the procedure described
in the appendix to Chapter 1. The following steps can be used to conduct a hypothesis test
of the population proportion.
Step 1. Click the StatTools tab on the Ribbon
Step 2. In the Analyses group, click Statistical Inference
Step 3. Choose Hypothesis Test 
Step 4. Choose Proportion
Step 5. When the StatTools—Hypothesis Test for Proportion dialog box appears:
For Analysis Type choose One-Sample Analysis
In the Variables section, select Golfer
In the Categories to Analyze section, select Female
In the Hypotheses About Proportion section:
Enter .20 in the Null Hypothesis Value box
In the Alternaive Hypotheses box, choose Greater Than Null 
Value (One-Tailed Test)
Click OK
The results from the hypothesis test will appear.  They include the p-value and the value of
the test statistic.

It is the responsibility of the U.S. Food and Drug Ad-
ministration (FDA), through its Center for Drug Evalua-
tion and Research (CDER), to ensure that drugs are safe
and effective. But CDER does not do the actual testing
of new drugs itself. It is the responsibility of the com-
pany seeking to market a new drug to test it and submit
evidence that it is safe and effective. CDER statisticians
and scientists then review the evidence submitted.
Companies seeking approval of a new drug conduct
extensive statistical studies to support their application.
The testing process in the pharmaceutical industry
usually consists of three stages: (1) preclinical testing,
(2) testing for long-term usage and safety, and (3) clinical
efficacy testing.At each successive stage, the chance that
a drug will pass the rigorous tests decreases; however, the
cost of further testing increases dramatically. Industry
surveys indicate that on average the research and devel-
opment for one new drug costs $250 million and takes 12
years. Hence, it is important to eliminate unsuccessful
newdrugsintheearlystagesofthetestingprocess,aswell
as to identify promising ones for further testing.
Statistics plays a major role in pharmaceutical re-
search, where government regulations are stringent and
rigorously enforced. In preclinical testing, a two- or
three-population statistical study typically is used to de-
termine whether a new drug should continue to be stud-
ied in the long-term usage and safety program. The
populations may consist of the new drug, a control, and a
standard drug. The preclinical testing process begins
when a new drug is sent to the pharmacology group for
evaluation of efficacy—the capacity of the drug to pro-
duce the desired effects. As part of the process, a statisti-
cian is asked to design an experiment that can be used to
test the new drug. The design must specify the sample
size and the statistical methods of analysis. In a two-
population study, one sample is used to obtain data on the
efficacy of the new drug (population 1) and a second sam-
ple is used to obtain data on the efficacy of a standard 
drug (population 2). Depending on the intended use, the
new and standard drugs are tested in such disciplines as
Extensive statistical studies are conducted before a
new drug is approved.

neurology, cardiology, and immunology. In most studies,
the statistical method involves hypothesis testing for the
difference between the means of the new drug population
and the standard drug population. If a new drug lacks ef-
ficacy or produces undesirable effects in comparison with
the standard drug, the new drug is rejected and withdrawn
from further testing. Only new drugs that show promis-
ing comparisons with the standard drugs are forwarded to
the long-term usage and safety testing program.
Further data collection and multipopulation studies
are conducted in the long-term usage and safety testing
program and in the clinical testing programs. The FDA
requires that statistical methods be defined prior to such
testing to avoid data-related biases. In addition, to avoid
human biases, some of the clinical trials are double or
triple blind. That is, neither the subject nor the investi-
gator knows what drug is administered to whom. If the
new drug meets all requirements in relation to the stan-
dard drug, a new drug application (NDA) is filed with the
FDA. The application is rigorously scrutinized by statis-
ticians and scientists at the agency.
In this chapter you will learn how to construct inter-
val estimates and make hypothesis tests about means and
proportions with two populations. Techniques will be
presented for analyzing independent random samples as
well as matched samples.

Chapter 10
Comparisons Involving Means, Experimental Design, and Analysis of Variance
In Chapters 8 and 9 we showed how to develop interval estimates and conduct hypothesis tests
for situations involving a single population mean and a single population proportion.  In Sec-
tions 10.1 to 10.3 we continue our discussion of statistical inference by showing how interval
estimates and hypothesis tests can be developed for situations involving two populations
when the difference between the two population means is of prime importance. For example,
we may want to develop an interval estimate of the difference between the mean starting salary
for a population of men and the mean starting salary for a population of women, or conduct
a hypothesis test to determine whether any difference is present between the two population
means.
In Section 10.4, we introduce the basic principles of an experimental study and show how
they are used in a completely randomized design. We also provide a conceptual overview of
the statistical procedure called analysis of variance (ANOVA). In Section 10.5 we show how
ANOVA can be used to test for the equality of k population means using data obtained from
a completely randomized design as well as data obtained from an observational study. So, in
this sense, ANOVA extends the statistical material in Sections 10.1 to 10.3 from two popula-
tion means to three or more population means.
We begin our discussion of statistical inference about two populations by showing how
to develop interval estimates and conduct hypothesis tests about the difference between the
means of two populations when the standard deviations of the two populations are assumed
known.
10.1
Inferences About the Difference Between Two
Population Means: σ1 and σ2 Known
Letting μ1 denote the mean of population 1 and μ2 denote the mean of population 2, we will
focus on inferences about the difference between the means: μ1  μ2. To make an inference
about this difference, we select a random sample of n1 elements from population 1 and a
second random sample of n2 elements from population 2. The two samples, taken 
separately and independently, are referred to as independent random samples. In this sec-
tion, we assume that information is available such that the two population standard devia-
tions, σ1 and σ2, can be assumed known prior to collecting the samples. We refer to this
situation as the σ1 and σ2 known case. In the following example we show how to compute
a margin of error and develop an interval estimate of the difference between the two popu-
lation means when σ1 and σ2 are known.
Interval Estimation of μ1  μ2
Greystone Department Stores, Inc., operates two stores in Buffalo, New York: One is in the in-
ner city and the other is in a suburban shopping center. The regional manager noticed that prod-
ucts that sell well in one store do not always sell well in the other. The manager believes this
situation may be attributable to differences in customer demographics at the two locations. Cus-
tomers may differ in age, education, income, and so on. Suppose the manager asks us to in-
vestigate the difference between the mean ages of the customers who shop at the two stores.
Let us define population 1 as all customers who shop at the inner-city store and popu-
lation 2 as all customers who shop at the suburban store.
The difference between the two population means is μ1  μ2.

As with other point estimators, the point estimator

Chapter 10
Comparisons Involving Means, Experimental Design, and Analysis of Variance
As we showed in Chapter 8, an interval estimate is given by a point estimate  a mar-
gin of error. In the case of estimation of the difference between two population means, an
interval estimate will take the following form:
With the sampling distribution of 
1 
2 having a normal distribution, we can write the
margin of error as follows:

Let us return to the Greystone example. Based on data from previous customer demo-
graphic studies, the two population standard deviations are known with σ1  9 years and
σ2  10 years. The data collected from the two independent random samples of Greystone
customers provided the following results:
Using expression (10.1), we find that the point estimate of the difference between the
mean ages of the two populations is 1 
2  40  35  5 years. Thus, we estimate that
the customers at the inner-city store have a mean age five years greater than the mean age of
the suburban store customers. We can now use expression (10.4) to compute the margin
of error and provide the interval estimate of μ1  μ2. Using 95% confidence and 
zα/2  z.025  1.96, we have
Thus, the margin of error is 4.06 years and the 95% confidence interval estimate of the
difference between the two population means is 5  4.06  .94 years to 5  4.06 

Hypothesis Tests About μ1  μ2
Let us consider hypothesis tests about the difference between two population means. Using
D0 to denote the hypothesized difference between μ1 and μ2, the three forms for a hypothe-
sis test are as follows:
In many applications, D0  0. Using the two-tailed test as an example, when D0  0 the
null hypothesis is H0: μ1  μ2  0. In this case, the null hypothesis is that μ1 and μ2 are
equal. Rejection of H0 leads to the conclusion that Ha: μ1  μ2  0 is true; that is, μ1 and
μ2 are not equal.
The steps for conducting hypothesis tests presented in Chapter 9 are applicable here.
We must choose a level of significance, compute the value of the test statistic, and find the
p-value to determine whether the null hypothesis should be rejected. With two independent
random samples, we showed that the point estimator 
1 
2 has a standard error 
given by expression (10.2) and, when the sample sizes are large enough, the distribution of
1 
2 can be described by a normal distribution. In this case, the test statistic for the
difference between two population means when σ1 and σ2 are known is as follows.

Let us demonstrate the use of this test statistic in the following hypothesis testing example.
As part of a study to evaluate differences in education quality between two training cen-
ters, a standardized examination is given to individuals who are trained at the centers. The
difference between the mean examination scores is used to assess quality differences 
between the centers. The population means for the two centers are as follows.
We begin with the tentative assumption that no difference exists between the training
quality provided at the two centers. Hence, in terms of the mean examination scores, the
null hypothesis is that μ1  μ2  0. If sample evidence leads to the rejection of this hy-
pothesis, we will conclude that the mean examination scores differ for the two populations.
This conclusion indicates a quality differential between the two centers and suggests that a
follow-up study investigating the reason for the differential may be warranted. The null and
alternative hypotheses for this two-tailed test are written as follows:
H0:
Ha: μ1  μ2  0

of individuals trained at center B

The standardized examination given previously in a variety of settings always resulted in
an examination score standard deviation near 10 points. Thus, we will use this information
to assume that the population standard deviations are known with σ1  10 and σ2  10. An
α  .05 level of significance is specified for the study.
Independent random samples of n1  30 individuals from training center Aand n2  40
individuals from training center B are taken. The respective sample means are 
1  82 and 2  78. Do these data suggest a significant difference between the population
means at the two training centers? To help answer this question, we compute the test sta-
tistic using equation (10.5).
Next let us compute the p-value for this two-tailed test. Because the test statistic z is in the
upper tail, we first compute P(z 	 1.66). Using the standard normal distribution table, the area
to the left of z  1.66 is .9515. Thus, the area in the upper tail of the distribution is
1.0000  .9515  .0485. Because this test is a two-tailed test, we must double the tail area: 
p-value  2(.0485)  .0970. Following the usual rule to reject H0 if p-value  α, we see that
the p-value of .0970 does not allow us to reject H0 at the .05 level of significance. The sample
results do not provide sufficient evidence to conclude the training centers differ in quality.
In this chapter we will use the p-value approach to hypothesis testing as described in
Chapter 9. However, if you prefer, the test statistic and the critical value rejection rule may
be used. With α  .05 and zα/2  z.025  1.96, the rejection rule employing the critical value
approach would be “reject H0 if z  1.96 or if z 	 1.96.” With z  1.66, we reach the
same “do not reject H0” conclusion.
In the preceding example, we demonstrated a two-tailed hypothesis test about the dif-
ference between two population means. Lower tail and upper tail tests can also be consid-
ered. These tests use the same test statistic as given in equation (10.5). The procedure for
computing the p-value and the rejection rules for these one-tailed tests is the same as those
presented in Chapter 9.
Practical Advice
In most applications of the interval estimation and hypothesis testing procedures presented
in this section, random samples with n1 	 30 and n2 	 30 are adequate. In cases where ei-
ther or both sample sizes are less than 30, the distributions of the populations become im-
portant considerations. In general, with smaller sample sizes, it is more important for the
analyst to be satisfied that it is reasonable to assume that the distributions of the two popu-
lations are at least approximately normal.

Condé Nast Traveler conducts an annual survey in which readers rate their favorite cruise ship.
All ships are rated on a 100-point scale, with higher values indicating better service. Asample of
37 ships that carry fewer than 500 passengers resulted in an average rating of 85.36, and a sam-
ple of 44 ships that carry 500 or more passengers provided an average rating of 81.40 (Condé
Nast Traveler, February 2008). Assume that the population standard deviation is 4.55 for ships
that carry fewer than 500 passengers and 3.97 for ships that carry 500 or more passengers.

Suppose that you are responsible for making arrangements for a business convention. Be-
cause of budget cuts due to the recent recession, you have been charged with choosing a
city for the convention that has the least expensive hotel rooms. You have narrowed your
choices to Atlanta and Houston. The file named Hotel contains samples of prices for rooms
in Atlanta and Houston that are consistent with the results reported by Smith Travel Re-
search (SmartMoney, March 2009). Because considerable historical data on the prices of
rooms in both cities are available, the population standard deviations for the prices can be
assumed to be $20 in Atlanta and $25 in Houston. Based on the sample data, can you con-
clude that the mean price of a hotel room in Atlanta is lower than one in Houston?

Will improving customer service result in higher stock prices for the companies providing

results and is above the national average (currently 75.7), studies show its shares have a good
chance of outperforming the broad stock market in the long run” (BusinessWeek, March 2,
2009). The following satisfaction scores of three companies for the 4th quarters of 2007 and
2008 were obtained from the American Customer Satisfaction Index. Assume that the scores
are based on a poll of 60 customers from each company. Because the polling has been done
for several years, the standard deviation can be assumed to equal 6 points in each case.

Inferences About the Difference Between Two
Population Means: σ1 and σ2 Unknown
In this section we extend the discussion of inferences about the difference between two
population means to the case when the two population standard deviations, σ1 and σ2, are
unknown. In this case, we will use the sample standard deviations, s1 and s2, to estimate the
unknown population standard deviations. When we use the sample standard deviations, the
interval estimation and hypothesis testing procedures will be based on the t distribution
rather than the standard normal distribution.
Interval Estimation of μ1  μ2
In the following example we show how to compute a margin of error and develop an inter-
val estimate of the difference between two population means when σ1 and σ2 are unknown.
Clearwater National Bank is conducting a study designed to identify differences between
checking account practices by customers at two of its branch banks. A sample of 28 check-
ing accounts is selected from the Cherry Grove Branch and an independent sample of 22
checking accounts is selected from the Beechmont Branch. The current checking account
balance is recorded for each of the checking accounts. A summary of the account balances

Clearwater National Bank would like to estimate the difference between the mean

population of Beechmont customers. Let us develop the margin of error and an interval es-
timate of the difference between these two population means.

population standard deviations, σ1 and σ2, are known.

In this expression, the use of the t distribution is an approximation, but it provides excellent
results and is relatively easy to use. The only difficulty that we encounter in using expression
(10.6) is determining the appropriate degrees of freedom for tα/2. Statistical software packages
compute the appropriate degrees of freedom automatically. The formula used is as follows.
Let us return to the Clearwater National Bank example and show how to use expression
(10.6) to provide a 95% confidence interval estimate of the difference between the population
mean checking account balances at the two branch banks. The sample data show n1  28,
1 
$1025, and s1  $150 for the Cherry Grove branch, and n2  22,
2  $910, and s2  $125
for the Beechmont branch. The calculation for degrees of freedom for tα/2 is as follows:
We round the noninteger degrees of freedom down to 47 to provide a larger t value and a
more conservative interval estimate. Using the t distribution table with 47 degrees of free-
dom, we find t.025  2.012. Using expression (10.6), we develop the 95% confidence in-
terval estimate of the difference between the two population means as follows.
The point estimate of the difference between the population mean checking account balances
at the two branches is $115. The margin of error is $78, and the 95% confidence interval

With σ1 and σ2 unknown, we will use the sample standard deviations s1 and s2 to estimate

Let us demonstrate the use of this test statistic in the following hypothesis testing example.
Consider a new computer software package developed to help systems analysts reduce
the time required to design, develop, and implement an information system. To evaluate the
benefits of the new software package, a random sample of 24 systems analysts is selected.
Each analyst is given specifications for a hypothetical information system. Then 12 of the
analysts are instructed to produce the information system by using current technology. The
other 12 analysts are trained in the use of the new software package and then instructed to
use it to produce the information system.
This study involves two populations: a population of systems analysts using the current
technology and a population of systems analysts using the new software package. In terms
of the time required to complete the information system design project, the population
means are as follow.
The researcher in charge of the new software evaluation project hopes to show that 
the new software package will provide a shorter mean project completion time. Thus,
the researcher is looking for evidence to conclude that μ2 is less than μ1; in this case, the

estimate of the difference between the two population means is 115  78  $37 to

The computation of the degrees of freedom (equation 10.7) is cumbersome if you are doing
the calculation by hand, but it is easily implemented with a computer software package. However,
note that the expressions 
and 
appear in both expression (10.6) and equation (10.7).
These values only need to be computed once in order to evaluate both (10.6) and (10.7).
Hypothesis Tests About μ1  μ2
Let us now consider hypothesis tests about the difference between the means of two popu-
lations when the population standard deviations σ1 and σ2 are unknown. Letting D0 denote
the hypothesized difference between μ1 and μ2, Section 10.1 showed that the test statistic
used for the case where σ1 and σ2 are known is as follows.
The test statistic, z, follows the standard normal distribution.
When σ1 and σ2 are unknown, we use s1 as an estimator of σ1 and s2 as an estimator of
σ2. Substituting these sample standard deviations for σ1 and σ2 provides the following test
statistic when σ1 and σ2 are unknown.

Inferences About the Difference Between Two Population Means: σ1 and σ2 Unknown
405
With an upper tail test, the p-value is the area in the upper tail corresponding to t  2.27.
From the preceding results, we see that the p-value is between .025 and .01. Thus, the p-
value is less than α  .05 and H0 is rejected. The sample results enable the researcher to
conclude that μ1  μ2  0, or μ1  μ2. Thus, the research study supports the conclusion
that the new software package provides a smaller population mean completion time.
Minitab or Excel can be used to analyze data for testing hypotheses about the differ-
ence between two population means. The Minitab output comparing the current and new
software technology is shown in Figure 10.2. The last line of the output shows t  2.27 and
p-value  .017. Note that Minitab used equation (10.7) to compute 21 degrees of freedom
for this analysis.
Practical Advice
The interval estimation and hypothesis testing procedures presented in this section are
robust and can be used with relatively small sample sizes. In most applications, equal
or nearly equal sample sizes such that the total sample size n1  n2 is at least 20 can be
expected to provide very good results even if the populations are not normal. Larger sam-
ple sizes are recommended if the distributions of the populations are highly skewed or con-
tain outliers. Smaller sample sizes should only be used if the analyst is satisfied that the
distributions of the populations are at least approximately normal.
Using the t distribution table,
we can only determine 
a range for the p-value. Use 
of Excel or Minitab shows
the exact p-value  .017.
NOTES AND COMMENTS
Another approach used to make inferences about
the difference between two population means when
σ1 and σ2 are unknown is based on the assumption
that the two population standard deviations are
equal (σ1  σ2  σ). Under this assumption, the
two sample standard deviations are combined to
provide the following pooled sample variance:
The t test statistic becomes
t  (x¯1  x¯
 2)  D0
sp 1
n1  1
n 2
s2
p  (n1  1)s2
1  (n 2  1)s2
2
n1  n 2  2
and has n1  n2  2 degrees of freedom. At this
point, the computation of the p-value and the inter-
pretation of the sample results are identical to the
procedures discussed earlier in this section.
A difficulty with this procedure is that the as-
sumption
that
the
two
population
standard
deviations are equal is usually difficult to verify.
Unequal
population
standard
deviations
are
frequently encountered. Using the pooled procedure
may not provide satisfactory results, especially if
the sample sizes n1 and n2 are quite different.
The t procedure that we presented in this sec-
tion does not require the assumption of equal 
population standard deviations and can be applied
whether the population standard deviations are
equal or not. It is a more general procedure and is
recommended for most applications.
Whenever possible, equal
sample sizes, n1  n2, are
recommended.

Commercial real estate prices and rental rates suffered substantial declines in the past year
(Newsweek, July 27, 2009). These declines were particularly severe in Asia; annual lease
rates in Tokyo, Hong Kong, and Singapore declined by 40% or more. Even with such large
declines, annual lease rates in Asia were still higher than those in many cities in Europe
and the United States. Annual lease rates for a sample of 30 commercial properties in Hong
Kong showed an average of $1,114 per square meter with a standard deviation of $230.

The College Board provided comparisons of SAT scores based on the highest level of
education attained by the test taker’s parents. A research hypothesis was that students
whose parents had attained a higher level of education would on average score higher on
the SAT. The overall mean SAT math score is 515 (College Board website, November
15, 2009). SAT math scores for independent samples of students follow. The first sam-
ple shows the SAT math test scores for students whose parents are college graduates with
a bachelor’s degree. The second sample shows the SAT math test scores for students
whose parents are high school graduates but do not have a college degree.

Educational testing companies provide tutoring, classroom learning, and practice tests in
an effort to help students perform better on tests such as the SAT. The test preparation com-
panies claim that their courses will improve SAT score performances by an average of 120
points (The Wall Street Journal, January 23, 2003). A researcher is uncertain of this claim
and believes that 120 points may be an overstatement in an effort to encourage students to
take the test preparation course. In an evaluation study of one test preparation service, the
researcher collects SAT score data for 35 students who took the test preparation course and
48 students who did not take the course. The file named SAT contains the scores for this
study.

Inferences About the Difference Between Two
Population Means: Matched Samples
Suppose employees at a manufacturing company can use two different methods to perform
a production task. To maximize production output, the company wants to identify the
method with the smaller population mean completion time. Let μ1 denote the population
mean completion time for production method 1 and μ2 denote the population mean com-
pletion time for production method 2. With no preliminary indication of the preferred pro-
duction method, we begin by tentatively assuming that the two production methods have
the same population mean completion time. Thus, the null hypothesis is H0: μ1  μ2  0.
If this hypothesis is rejected, we can conclude that the population mean completion times
differ. In this case, the method providing the smaller mean completion time would be rec-
ommended. The null and alternative hypotheses are written as follows.
In choosing the sampling procedure that will be used to collect production time data and
test the hypotheses, we consider two alternative designs. One is based on independent sam-
ples and the other is based on matched samples.
1. Independent sample design: A random sample of workers is selected and each
worker in the sample uses method 1. A second independent random sample of
workers is selected and each worker in this sample uses method 2. The test of the
difference between population means is based on the procedures in Section 10.2.
2. Matched sample design: One random sample of workers is selected. Each worker
first uses one method and then uses the other method. The order of the two methods
is assigned randomly to the workers, with some workers performing method 1 first
and others performing method 2 first. Each worker provides a pair of data values,
one value for method 1 and another value for method 2.
In the matched sample design the two production methods are tested under similar con-
ditions (i.e., with the same workers); hence this design often leads to a smaller sampling 
error than the independent sample design. The primary reason is that in a matched sample
design, variation among workers is eliminated because the same workers are used for both
production methods.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

Let us demonstrate the analysis of a matched sample design by assuming it is the
method used to test the difference between population means for the two production methods.
A random sample of six workers is used. The data on completion times for the six workers
are given in Table 10.2. Note that each worker provides a pair of data values, one for each
production method. Also note that the last column contains the difference in completion
times di for each worker in the sample.
The key to the analysis of the matched sample design is to realize that we consider only
the column of differences. Therefore, we have six data values (.6, .2, .5, .3, .0, and .6)
that will be used to analyze the difference between population means of the two production
methods.
Let μd  the mean of the difference in values for the population of workers. With this
notation, the null and alternative hypotheses are rewritten as follows:
If H0 is rejected, we can conclude that the population mean completion times differ.
The d notation is a reminder that the matched sample provides difference data. The
sample mean and sample standard deviation for the six difference values inTable 10.2 follow.
With the small sample of n  6 workers, we need to make the assumption that the popu-
lation of differences has a normal distribution. This assumption is necessary so that we
may use the t distribution for hypothesis testing and interval estimation procedures. Based
on this assumption, the following test statistic has a t distribution with n  1 degrees of
freedom.

Let us use equation (10.9) to test the hypotheses H0: μd  0 and Ha: μd  0, using α  .05.
Substituting the sample results 
 .30, sd  .335, and n  6 into equation (10.9), we com-
pute the value of the test statistic.
Now let us compute the p-value for this two-tailed test. Because t  2.20  0, the test
statistic is in the upper tail of the t distribution. With t  2.20, the area in the upper tail can
be found by using the t distribution table with degrees of freedom  n  1  6  1  5.
Information from the 5 degrees of freedom row of the t distribution table is as follows:

Once the difference data
are computed, the 
t distribution procedure for
matched samples is the
same as the one-population
estimation and hypothesis
testing procedures
described in Chapters 8
and 9.
Thus, we see that the area in the upper tail is between .05 and .025. Because this test is a
two-tailed test, we double these values to conclude that the p-value is between .10 and .05.
This p-value is greater than α  .05. Thus, the null hypothesis H0: μd  0 is not rejected.
Using Excel or Minitab and the data in Table 10.2, we find the exact p-value  .080.
In addition we can obtain an interval estimate of the difference between the two popu-
lation means by using the single population methodology of Chapter 8. At 95% confidence,
the calculation follows.
Thus, the margin of error is .35 and the 95% confidence interval for the difference between
the population means of the two production methods is .05 minute to .65 minute.

NOTES AND COMMENTS
1. In the example presented in this section, work-
ers performed the production task with first one
method and then the other method. This exam-
ple illustrates a matched sample design in which
each sampled element (worker) provides a pair
of data values. It is also possible to use different
but “similar” elements to provide the pair of
data values. For example, a worker at one loca-
tion could be matched with a similar worker at
another location (similarity based on age, edu-
cation, gender, experience, etc.). The pairs of
workers would provide the difference data that
could be used in the matched sample analysis.
2. A matched sample procedure for inferences
about two population means generally provides
better precision than the independent sample ap-
proach; therefore it is the recommended design.
However, in some applications the matching
cannot be achieved, or perhaps the time and cost
associated with matching are excessive. In such
cases, the independent sample design should be
used.

An Introduction to Experimental Design 
and Analysis of Variance
In Chapter 1 we stated that statistical studies can be classified as either experimental or
observational. In an experimental statistical study, an experiment is conducted to generate

the data. An experiment begins with identifying a variable of interest. Then one or more
other variables, thought to be related, are identified and controlled, and data are collected
about how those variables influence the variable of interest. 
In an observational study, data are usually obtained through sample surveys and not a
controlled experiment. Good sample designs are employed, but the rigorous controls asso-
ciated with an experimental statistical study are often not possible. For instance, in a study of
the relationship between smoking and lung cancer the researcher cannot assign a smoking
habit to subjects. The researcher is restricted to simply observing the effects of smoking on
people who already smoke and the effects of not smoking on people who already do not
smoke.
In this section we introduce the basic principles of an experimental study and show how
they are used in a completely randomized design. We also provide a conceptual overview
of the statistical procedure called analysis of variance (ANOVA). In the following section
we show how ANOVA can be used to test for the equality of k population means using data
obtained from a completely randomized design as well as data obtained from an observa-
tional study. So, in this sense, ANOVA extends the statistical material in the preceding sec-
tions from two population means to three or more population means. In later chapters, we
will see that ANOVA plays a key role in analyzing the results of regression studies involv-
ing both experimental and observational data.
As an example of an experimental statistical study, let us consider the problem facing
Chemitech, Inc. Chemitech developed a new filtration system for municipal water supplies.
The components for the new filtration system will be purchased from several suppliers, and
Chemitech will assemble the components at its plant in Columbia, South Carolina. The in-
dustrial engineering group is responsible for determining the best assembly method for the
new filtration system. After considering a variety of possible approaches, the group narrows
the alternatives to three: method A, method B, and method C. These methods differ in the
sequence of steps used to assemble the system. Managers at Chemitech want to determine
which assembly method can produce the greatest number of filtration systems per week.
In the Chemitech experiment, assembly method is the independent variable or factor.
Because three assembly methods correspond to this factor, we say that three treatments are
associated with this factor; each treatment corresponds to one of the three assembly meth-
ods. The Chemitech problem is an example of a single-factor experiment; it involves one
qualitative factor (method of assembly). More complex experiments may consist of multi-
ple factors; some factors may be qualitative and others may be quantitative.
The three assembly methods or treatments define the three populations of interest for
the Chemitech experiment. One population is all Chemitech employees who use assembly
methodA, another is those who use method B, and the third is those who use method C. Note
that for each population the dependent or response variable is the number of filtration sys-
tems assembled per week, and the primary statistical objective of the experiment is to
determine whether the mean number of units produced per week is the same for all three
populations (methods).
Suppose a random sample of three employees is selected from all assembly workers at
the Chemitech production facility. In experimental design terminology, the three randomly
selected workers are the experimental units. The experimental design that we will use for
the Chemitech problem is called a completely randomized design. This type of design
requires that each of the three assembly methods or treatments be assigned randomly to one
of the experimental units or workers. For example, method A might be randomly assigned
to the second worker, method B to the first worker, and method C to the third worker. The
concept of randomization, as illustrated in this example, is an important principle of all
experimental designs.
Note that this experiment would result in only one measurement or number of units
assembled for each treatment. To obtain additional data for each assembly method, we

must repeat or replicate the basic experimental process. Suppose, for example, that instead
of selecting just three workers at random we selected 15 workers and then randomly assigned
each of the three treatments to 5 of the workers. Because each method of assembly is
assigned to 5 workers, we say that five replicates have been obtained. The process of repli-
cation is another important principle of experimental design. Figure 10.3 shows the com-
pletely randomized design for the Chemitech experiment.
Data Collection
Once we are satisfied with the experimental design, we proceed by collecting and analyz-
ing the data. In the Chemitech case, the employees would be instructed in how to per-
form the assembly method assigned to them and then would begin assembling the new
filtration systems using that method. After this assignment and training, the number of
units assembled by each employee during one week is as shown in Table 10.3. The sample
means, sample variances, and sample standard deviations for each assembly method are
also provided. Thus, the sample mean number of units produced using method A is 62; the
sample mean using method B is 66; and the sample mean using method C is 52. From
these data, method B appears to result in higher production rates than either of the other
methods.
The real issue is whether the three sample means observed are different enough for us
to conclude that the means of the populations corresponding to the three methods of as-
sembly are different. To write this question in statistical terms, we introduce the following
notation.

Although we will never know the actual values of μ1, μ2, and μ3, we want to use the sample
means to test the following hypotheses.
As we will demonstrate shortly, analysis of variance (ANOVA) is the statistical procedure
used to determine whether the observed differences in the three sample means are large
enough to reject H0.
Assumptions for Analysis of Variance
Three assumptions are required to use analysis of variance.
1. For each population, the response variable is normally distributed. Implication:
In the Chemitech experiment the number of units produced per week (response variable)
must be normally distributed for each assembly method.
2. The variance of the response variable, denoted σ 2, is the same for all of the pop-
ulations. Implication: In the Chemitech experiment, the variance of the number of
units produced per week must be the same for each assembly method.
3. The observations must be independent. Implication: In the Chemitech experiment,
the number of units produced per week for each employee must be independent of
the number of units produced per week for any other employee.
Analysis of Variance: A Conceptual Overview
If the means for the three populations are equal, we would expect the three sample means
to be close together. In fact, the closer the three sample means are to one another, the
more evidence we have for the conclusion that the population means are equal. Alterna-
tively, the more the sample means differ, the more evidence we have for the conclusion
that the population means are not equal. In other words, if the variability among the sam-
ple means is “small,” it supports H0; if the variability among the sample means is “large,”
it supports Ha.
If the null hypothesis, H0: μ1  μ2  μ3, is true, we can use the variability among the
sample means to develop an estimate of σ 2. First, note that if the assumptions for analysis
of variance are satisfied, each sample will have come from the same normal distribution
with mean μ and variance σ 2. Recall from Chapter 7 that the sampling distribution of the

If H0 is rejected, we cannot
conclude that all
population means are
different. Rejecting H0
means that at least two
population means have
different values.
If the sample sizes are
equal, analysis of variance
is not sensitive to
departures from the

Comparisons Involving Means, Experimental Design, and Analysis of Variance
sample mean for a simple random sample of size n from a normal population will be nor-
mally distributed with mean μ and variance σ 2/n. Figure 10.4 illustrates such a sampling
distribution.
Thus, if the null hypothesis is true, we can think of each of the three sample means, 
1  62, 
2  66, and 3  52 from Table 10.3, as values drawn at random from the sam-
pling distribution shown in Figure 10.4. In this case, the mean and variance of the three 
values can be used to estimate the mean and variance of the sampling distribution. When
the sample sizes are equal, as in the Chemitech experiment, the best estimate of the mean
of the sampling distribution of is the mean or average of the sample means. Thus, in the
Chemitech experiment, an estimate of the mean of the sampling distribution of 
is
(62  66  52)/3  60. We refer to this estimate as the overall sample mean. An estimate
of the variance of the sampling distribution of , 
, is provided by the variance of the three
sample means.
Because 
 σ 2/n, solving for σ 2 gives
Hence,
The result, 
 260, is referred to as the between-treatments estimate of σ 2.
The between-treatments estimate of σ2 is based on the assumption that the null hypoth-
esis is true. In this case, each sample comes from the same population, and there is only
one sampling distribution of . To illustrate what happens when H0 is false, suppose the
population means all differ. Note that because the three samples are from normal popu-
lations with different means, they will result in three different sampling distributions. 
Figure 10.5 shows that in this case, the sample means are not as close together as they were

when H0 was true. Thus, 
will be larger, causing the between-treatments estimate of σ 2
to be larger. In general, when the population means are not equal, the between-treatments
estimate will overestimate the population variance σ 2.
The variation within each of the samples also has an effect on the conclusion we reach
in analysis of variance. When a random sample is selected from each population, each of
the sample variances provides an unbiased estimate of σ 2. Hence, we can combine or pool
the individual estimates of σ 2 into one overall estimate. The estimate of σ 2 obtained in this
way is called the pooled or within-treatments estimate of σ 2. Because each sample
variance provides an estimate of σ 2 based only on the variation within each sample, the
within-treatments estimate of σ 2 is not affected by whether the population means are equal.
When the sample sizes are equal, the within-treatments estimate of σ 2 can be obtained by
computing the average of the individual sample variances. For the Chemitech experiment
we obtain
In the Chemitech experiment, the between-treatments estimate of σ 2 (260) is much
larger than the within-treatments estimate of σ 2 (28.33). In fact, the ratio of these two
estimates is 260/28.33  9.18. Recall, however, that the between-treatments approach
provides a good estimate of σ 2 only if the null hypothesis is true; if the null hypothesis
is false, the between-treatments approach overestimates σ 2. The within-treatments ap-
proach provides a good estimate of σ 2 in either case. Thus, if the null hypothesis is true,
the two estimates will be similar and their ratio will be close to 1. If the null hypothesis
is false, the between-treatments estimate will be larger than the within-treatments estimate,
and their ratio will be large. In the next section we will show how large this ratio must
be to reject H0.
In summary, the logic behind ANOVA is based on the development of two independent
estimates of the common population variance σ 2. One estimate of σ 2 is based on the vari-
ability among the sample means themselves, and the other estimate of σ 2 is based on the
variability of the data within each sample. By comparing these two estimates of σ 2, we will
be able to determine whether the population means are equal.

NOTES AND COMMENTS
1.
Randomization in experimental design is the
analog of probability sampling in an observa-
tional study.
2.
In many medical experiments, potential bias
is eliminated by using a double-blind experi-
mental design. With this design, neither the
physician applying the treatment nor the sub-
ject knows which treatment is being applied.
Many other types of experiments could bene-
fit from this type of design.
3.
In this section we provided a conceptual
overview of how analysis of variance can be
used to test for the equality of k population
means for a completely randomized experi-
mental design. We will see that the same pro-
cedure can also be used to test for the equality
of k population means for an observational or
nonexperimental study.
4.
In Sections 10.1 and 10.2 we presented statis-
tical methods for testing the hypothesis that the
means of two populations are equal. ANOVA
can also be used to test the hypothesis that the
means of two populations are equal. In prac-
tice, however, analysis of variance is usually
not used except when dealing with three or
more population means.

Analysis of Variance and the Completely
Randomized Design
In this section we show how analysis of variance can be used to test for the equality of k
population means for a completely randomized design. The general form of the hypotheses
tested is

We assume that a simple random sample of size nj has been selected from each of the k popu-
lations or treatments. For the resulting sample data, let

The overall sample mean, denoted , is the sum of all the observations divided by the total
number of observations. That is,

where
(10.13)
If the size of each sample is n, nT  kn; in this case equation (10.12) reduces to
(10.14)
In other words, whenever the sample sizes are the same, the overall sample mean is just the
average of the k sample means.
Because each sample in the Chemitech experiment consists of n  5 observations, the
overall sample mean can be computed by using equation (10.14). For the data in Table 10.3
we obtained the following result.
If the null hypothesis is true ( μ1  μ2  μ3  μ), the overall sample mean of 60 is the best
estimate of the population mean μ.
Between-Treatments Estimate of Population Variance
In the preceding section, we introduced the concept of a between-treatments estimate of σ 2
and showed how to compute it when the sample sizes were equal. This estimate of σ 2 is
called the mean square due to treatments and is denoted MSTR. The general formula for
computing MSTR is
(10.15)
The numerator in equation (10.15) is called the sum of squares due to treatments and is
denoted SSTR. The denominator, k  1, represents the degrees of freedom associated with
SSTR. Hence, the mean square due to treatments can be computed using the following
formula.

If H0 is true, MSTR provides an unbiased estimate of σ 2. However, if the means of the k
populations are not equal, MSTR is not an unbiased estimate of σ 2; in fact, in that case,
MSTR should overestimate σ 2.
For the Chemitech data in Table 10.3, we obtain the following results.
Within-Treatments Estimate of Population Variance
Earlier, we introduced the concept of a within-treatments estimate of σ 2 and showed how
to compute it when the sample sizes were equal. This estimate of σ 2 is called the mean
square due to error and is denoted MSE. The general formula for computing MSE is
(10.18)
The numerator in equation (10.18) is called the sum of squares due to error and is denoted
SSE. The denominator of MSE is referred to as the degrees of freedom associated with SSE.
Hence, the formula for MSE can also be stated as follows.

Comparing the Variance Estimates: The F Test
If the null hypothesis is true, MSTR and MSE provide two independent, unbiased estimates
of σ 2. If the ANOVA assumptions are also valid, the sampling distribution of MSTR/MSE
is an F distribution with numerator degrees of freedom equal to k  1 and denominator
degrees of freedom equal to nT  k. The general shape of the F distribution is shown in
Figure 10.6. If the null hypothesis is true, the value of MSTR/MSE should appear to have
been selected from this F distribution.
However, if the null hypothesis is false, the value of MSTR/MSE will be inflated be-
cause MSTR overestimates σ 2. Hence, we will reject H0 if the resulting value of MSTR/MSE
appears to be too large to have been selected from an F distribution with k  1 numerator
degrees of freedom and nT  k denominator degrees of freedom. Because the decision to
reject H0 is based on the value of MSTR/MSE, the test statistic used to test for the equality
of k population means is as follows.
TEST STATISTIC FOR THE EQUALITY OF k POPULATION MEANS
(10.21)
The test statistic follows an F distribution with k  1 degrees of freedom in the
numerator and nT  k degrees of freedom in the denominator.

Let us return to the Chemitech experiment and use a level of significance α  .05 to

freedom is nT  k  15  3  12. Because we will only reject the null hypothesis for large
values of the test statistic, the p-value is the upper tail area of the F distribution corre-
sponding to the value of the test statistic F  9.18. Figure 10.6 shows the sampling distrib-
ution of F  MSTR/ MSE, the value of the test statistic, and the upper tail area that is the

tribution with 2 numerator degrees of freedom and 12 denominator degrees of freedom.

Because F  9.18 is greater than 6.93, the area in the upper tail at F  9.18 is less than .01.
Thus, the p-value is less than .01. Minitab or Excel can be used to show that the exact p-value
is .004. With p-value  α  .05, H0 is rejected. The test provides sufficient evidence to
conclude that the means of the three populations are not equal. In other words, analysis of
variance supports the conclusion that the population mean number of units produced per
week for the three assembly methods are not equal.
As with other hypothesis testing procedures, the critical value approach may also be
used. With α  .05, the critical F value occurs with an area of .05 in the upper tail of
an F distribution with 2 and 12 degrees of freedom. From the F distribution table, we
find F.05  3.89. Hence, the appropriate upper tail rejection rule for the Chemitech
experiment is
With F  9.18, we reject H0 and conclude that the means of the three populations are not
equal. A summary of the overall procedure for testing for the equality of k population means

a completely randomized design is shown in Table 10.4; Table 10.5 is the corresponding
ANOVA table for the Chemitech experiment. The sum of squares associated with the source
of variation referred to as “Total” is called the total sum of squares (SST). Note that the re-

We point out that SST divided by its degrees of freedom nT  1 is nothing more than
the overall sample variance that would be obtained if we treated the entire set of 15 obser-

It can be shown that the results we observed for the analysis of variance table for the
Chemitech experiment also apply to other problems. That is,
(10.23)
In other words, SST can be partitioned into two sums of squares: the sum of squares due to
treatments and the sum of squares due to error. Note also that the degrees of freedom cor-
responding to SST, nT  1, can be partitioned into the degrees of freedom corresponding to
SSTR, k  1, and the degrees of freedom corresponding to SSE, nT  k. The analysis of
variance can be viewed as the process of partitioning the total sum of squares and the de-
grees of freedom into their corresponding sources: treatments and error. Dividing the sum
of squares by the appropriate degrees of freedom provides the variance estimates, the
F value, and the p-value used to test the hypothesis of equal population means.
Computer Results for Analysis of Variance
Using statistical computer packages, analysis of variance computations with large sample
sizes or a large number of populations can be performed easily. Appendixes 10.2, 10.4, and
10.6 show the steps required to use Minitab, Excel, and StatTools to perform the analysis
of variance computations. In Figure 10.7 we show output for the Chemitech experiment

FIGURE 10.7
MINITAB OUTPUT FOR THE CHEMITECH EXPERIMENT ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE
obtained using Minitab. The first part of the computer output contains the familiar ANOVA
table format. Comparing Figure 10.7 with Table 10.5, we see that the same information is
available, although some of the headings are slightly different. The heading Source is used
for the source of variation column, Factor identifies the treatments row, and the sum of
squares and degrees of freedom columns are interchanged.
Note that following the ANOVA table the computer output contains the respective
sample sizes, the sample means, and the standard deviations. In addition, Minitab provides
a figure that shows individual 95% confidence interval estimates of each population mean.
In developing these confidence interval estimates, Minitab uses MSE as the estimate of σ 2.
Thus, the square root of MSE provides the best estimate of the population standard devia-
tion σ. This estimate of σ on the computer output is Pooled StDev; it is equal to 5.323. To
provide an illustration of how these interval estimates are developed, we will compute a
95% confidence interval estimate of the population mean for method A.
From our study of interval estimation in Chapter 8, we know that the general form of
an interval estimate of a population mean is
(10.24)
where s is the estimate of the population standard deviation σ. Because the best estimate of
σ is provided by the Pooled StDev, we use a value of 5.323 for s in expression (10.24). The
degrees of freedom for the t value is 12, the degrees of freedom associated with the error
sum of squares. Hence, with t.025  2.179 we obtain
Thus, the individual 95% confidence interval for method A goes from 62  5.19  56.81
to 62  5.19  67.19. Because the sample sizes are equal for the Chemitech experiment, the
individual confidence intervals for methods B and C are also constructed by adding and sub-
tracting 5.19 from each sample mean. Thus, in the figure provided by Minitab we see that
the widths of the confidence intervals are the same.

Testing for the Equality of k Population Means: 
An Observational Study
We have shown how analysis of variance can be used to test for the equality of k population
means for a completely randomized experimental design. It is important to understand that
ANOVA can also be used to test for the equality of three or more population means using
data obtained from an observational study. As an example, let us consider the situation at
National Computer Products, Inc. (NCP).
NCP manufactures printers and fax machines at plants located in Atlanta, Dallas, and
Seattle. To measure how much employees at these plants know about quality management,
a random sample of six employees was selected from each plant and the employees selected
were given a quality awareness examination. The examination scores for these 18 employ-
ees are shown in Table 10.6. The sample means, sample variances, and sample standard
deviations for each group are also provided. Managers want to use these data to test the
hypothesis that the mean examination score is the same for all three plants.
We define population 1 as all employees at the Atlanta plant, population 2 as all
employees at the Dallas plant, and population 3 as all employees at the Seattle plant. Let
1  mean examination score for population 1
2  mean examination score for population 2
3  mean examination score for population 3
Although we will never know the actual values of 1, 2, and 3, we want to use the sample
results to test the following hypotheses.
H0: 1  2  3
Ha: Not all population means are equal
Note that the hypothesis test for the NCP observational study is exactly the same as the
hypothesis test for the Chemitech experiment. Indeed, the same analysis of variance
methodology we used to analyze the Chemitech experiment can also be used to analyze the
data from the NCP observational study.

employee worked at one of the three plants.All that NCPcould do was to select a random sam-

classified as an experimental study, NCPwould have had to be able to randomly select 18 em-
ployees and then assign the plants to each employee in a random fashion.

Auditors must make judgments about various aspects of an audit on the basis of their own
direct experience, indirect experience, or a combination of the two. In a study, auditors
were asked to make judgments about the frequency of errors to be found in an audit. The
judgments by the auditors were then compared to the actual results. Suppose the follow-
ing data were obtained from a similar study; lower scores indicate better judgments.

The Consumer Reports Restaurant Customer Satisfaction Survey is based upon 148,599
visits to full-service restaurant chains (Consumer Reports website). One of the variables in
the study is meal price, the average amount paid per person for dinner and drinks, minus
the tip. Suppose a reporter for the Sun Coast Times thought that it would be of interest to
her readers to conduct a similar study for restaurants located on the Grand Strand section
in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. The reporter selected a sample of eight seafood restau-
rants, eight Italian restaurants, and eight steakhouses. The following data show the meal
prices ($) obtained for the 24 restaurants sampled. Use α  .05 to test whether there is a
significant difference among the mean meal price for the three types of restaurants.

Summary
In this chapter we discussed procedures for developing interval estimates and conducting
hypothesis tests involving two populations. First, we showed how to make inferences about
the difference between two population means when independent random samples are se-
lected. We first considered the case where the population standard deviations, σ1
and σ2, could be assumed known. The standard normal distribution z was used to develop
the interval estimate and served as the test statistic for hypothesis tests. We then considered
the case where the population standard deviations were unknown and estimated by the 
sample standard deviations s1 and s2. In this case, the t distribution was used to develop the
interval estimate and served as the test statistic for hypothesis tests.
Inferences about the difference between two population means were then discussed for
the matched sample design. In the matched sample design each element provides a pair of
data values, one from each population. The difference between the paired data values is then
used in the statistical analysis. The matched sample design is generally preferred to the in-
dependent sample design because the matched-sample procedure often improves the preci-
sion of the estimate.
In the final two sections we provided an introduction to experimental design and the
analysis of variance (ANOVA). Experimental studies differ from observational studies in
the sense that an experiment is conducted to generate the data. The completely randomized
design was described and the analysis of variance was used to test for a treatment effect.
The same analysis of variance procedure can be used to test for the difference among k pop-
ulation means in an observational study.

Mutual funds are classified as load or no-load funds. Load funds require an investor to pay
an initial fee based on a percentage of the amount invested in the fund. The no-load funds
do not require this initial fee. Some financial advisors argue that the load mutual funds may
be worth the extra fee because these funds provide a higher mean rate of return than the
no-load mutual funds. A sample of 30 load mutual funds and a sample of 30 no-load mu-
tual funds were selected. Data were collected on the annual return for the funds over a five-
year period. The data are contained in the data set Mutual. The data for the first five load

A study reported in the Journal of Small Business Management concluded that self-
employed individuals do not experience higher job satisfaction than individuals who are
not self-employed. In this study, job satisfaction is measured using 18 items, each of which
is rated using a Likert-type scale with 1–5 response options ranging from strong agreement
to strong disagreement. A higher score on this scale indicates a higher degree of job satis-
faction. The sum of the ratings for the 18 items, ranging from 18–90, is used as the mea-
sure of job satisfaction. Suppose that this approach was used to measure the job satisfaction
for lawyers, physical therapists, cabinetmakers, and systems analysts. The results obtained
for a sample of 10 individuals from each profession follow.

Golf
Case Problem 1 Par, Inc.
Par, Inc., is a major manufacturer of golf equipment. Management believes that Par’s mar-
ket share could be increased with the introduction of a cut-resistant, longer-lasting golf
ball. Therefore, the research group at Par has been investigating a new golf ball coating
designed to resist cuts and provide a more durable ball. The tests with the coating have
been promising.
One of the researchers voiced concern about the effect of the new coating on driving
distances. Par would like the new cut-resistant ball to offer driving distances comparable 
to those of the current-model golf ball. To compare the driving distances for the two balls,
40 balls of both the new and current models were subjected to distance tests. The testing
was performed with a mechanical hitting machine so that any difference between the mean
distances for the two models could be attributed to a difference in the two models. The
results of the tests, with distances measured to the nearest yard, follow. These data are avail-
able on the website that accompanies the text.
Managerial Report
1. Formulate and present the rationale for a hypothesis test that Par could use to com-
pare the driving distances of the current and new golf balls.
2. Analyze the data to provide the hypothesis testing conclusion. What is the p-value
for your test? What is your recommendation for Par, Inc.?
3. Provide descriptive statistical summaries of the data for each model.
4. What is the 95% confidence interval for the population mean of each model, and
what is the 95% confidence interval for the difference between the means of the two
populations?
5. Do you see a need for larger sample sizes and more testing with the golf balls? Discuss.
Case Problem 2 Wentworth Medical Center
As part of a long-term study of individuals 65 years of age or older, sociologists and physi-
cians at the Wentworth Medical Center in upstate New York investigated the relationship be-
tween geographic location and depression. Asample of 60 individuals, all in reasonably good
health, was selected; 20 individuals were residents of Florida, 20 were residents of New York,
and 20 were residents of North Carolina. Each of the individuals sampled was given a
standardized test to measure depression. The data collected follow; higher test scores indicate
higher levels of depression. These data are available on the data disk in the file Medical1.

A second part of the study considered the relationship between geographic location
and depression for individuals 65 years of age or older who had a chronic health condi-
tion such as arthritis, hypertension, and/or heart ailment. A sample of 60 individuals with
such conditions was identified. Again, 20 were residents of Florida, 20 were residents of
New York, and 20 were residents of North Carolina. The levels of depression recorded for
this study follow. These data are available on the website accompanying the text in the file

Case Problem 3 Compensation for Sales Professionals
Suppose that a local chapter of sales professionals in the greater San Francisco area
conducted a survey of its membership to study the relationship, if any, between the
years of experience and salary for individuals employed in inside and outside sales
positions. On the survey, respondents were asked to specify one of three levels of years
of experience: low (1–10 years), medium (11–20 years), and high (21 or more years). A
portion of the data obtained follow. The complete data set, consisting of 120 observa-
tions, is available on the website accompanying the text in the file named SalesSalary.

We describe the use of Minitab to develop interval estimates and conduct hypothesis tests
about the difference between two population means and the difference between two popu-
lation proportions. Minitab provides both interval estimation and hypothesis testing results
withinthesamemodule.Thus,theMinitabprocedureisthesameforbothtypesofinferences.
In the examples that follow, we will demonstrate interval estimation and hypothesis testing
for the same two samples. We note that Minitab does not provide a routine for inferences
about the difference between two population means when the population standard deviations
σ1 and σ2 are known.

checking account balances at the Beechmont branch are in column C2. In this example, 
we will use the Minitab 2-Sample t procedure to provide a 95% confidence interval estimate
of the difference between population means for the checking account balances at the two
branch banks. The output of the procedure also provides the p-value for the hypothesis test:
H0: μ1  μ2  0 versus Ha: μ1  μ2  0. The following steps are necessary to execute the
procedure:
Step 1. Select the Stat menu
Step 2. Choose Basic Statistics
Step 3. Choose 2-Sample t
Step 4. When the 2-Sample t (Test and Confidence Interval) dialog box appears:
Select Samples in different columns
Enter C1 in the First box
Enter C2 in the Second box
Select Options
Step 5. When the 2-Sample t—Options dialog box appears:
Enter 95 in the Confidence level box
Enter 0 in the Test difference box
Enter not equal in the Alternative box
Click OK
Step 6. Click OK
The 95% confidence interval estimate is $37 to $193, as described in Section 10.2. The 
p-value  .005 shows the null hypothesis of equal population means can be rejected at
the α  .01 level of significance. In other applications, step 5 may be modified to pro-
vide different confidence levels, different hypothesized values, and different forms of the
hypotheses.
Difference Between Two Population Means 
with Matched Samples
We use the data on production times in Table 10.2 to illustrate the matched-sample proce-
dure. The completion times for method 1 are entered into column C1 and the completion
times for method 2 are entered into column C2. The Minitab steps for a matched sample are
as follows:
Step 1. Select the Stat menu
Step 2. Choose Basic Statistics
Step 3. Choose Paired t
Step 4. When the Paired t (Test and Confidence Interval) dialog box appears:
Select Samples in columns
Enter C1 in the First sample box
Enter C2 in the Second sample box
Select Options
Step 5. When the Paired t—Options dialog box appears:
Enter 95 in the Confidence level
Enter 0 in the Test mean box
Enter not equal in the Alternative box
Click OK
Step 6. Click OK
The 95% confidence interval estimate is .05 to .65, as described in Section 10.3. The 
p-value  .08 shows that the null hypothesis of no difference in completion times cannot be
rejected at α  .05. Step 5 may be modified to provide different confidence levels, different
hypothesized values, and different forms of the hypothesis.

Appendix 10.2 Analysis of Variance Using Minitab
Completely Randomized Design
In Section 10.5 we showed how analysis of variance could be used to test for the equality
of k population means using data from a completely randomized design. To illustrate how
Minitab can be used for this type of experimental design, we show how to test whether the
mean number of units produced per week is the same for each assembly method in
the Chemitech experiment introduced in Section 10.4. The sample data are entered into the
first three columns of a Minitab worksheet; column 1 is labeled A, column 2 is labeled B,
and column 3 is labeled C. The following steps produce the Minitab output in Figure 10.7.
Step 1. Select the Stat menu

Appendix 10.3 Inferences About Two Populations Using Excel
We describe the use of Excel to conduct hypothesis tests about the difference between two
population means.* We begin with inferences about the difference between the means of
two populations when the population standard deviations σ1 and σ2 are known.
Difference Between Two Population Means: 
σ1 and σ2 Known
We will use the examination scores for the two training centers discussed in Section 10.1. The
label Center Ais in cell A1 and the label Center B is in cell B1. The examination scores for Cen-
ter A are in cells A2:A31 and examination scores for Center B are in cells B2:B41. The
population standard deviations are assumed known with σ1  10 and σ2  10. The Excel rou-
tine will request the input of variances which are 
 100 and 
 100. The following steps
can be used to conduct a hypothesis test about the difference between the two population means.
Step 1. Click the Data tab on the Ribbon
Step 2. In the Analysis group, click Data Analysis
Step 3. When the Data Analysis dialog box appears:
Choose z-Test: Two Sample for Means

Difference Between Two Population Means: 
σ1 and σ2 Unknown
We use the data for the software testing study in Table 10.1. The data are already entered
into an Excel worksheet with the label Current in cell A1 and the label New in cell B1. The
completion times for the current technology are in cells A2:A13, and the completion times
for the new software are in cells B2:B13. The following steps can be used to conduct a hy-
pothesis test about the difference between two population means with σ1 and σ2 unknown.

Difference Between Two Population Means 
with Matched Samples
We use the matched-sample completion times in Table 10.2 to illustrate. The data are
entered into a worksheet with the label Method 1 in cell A1 and the label Method 2 in
cell B2. The completion times for method 1 are in cells A2:A7 and the completion times for
method 2 are in cells B2:B7. The Excel procedure uses the steps previously described
for the t-Test except the user chooses the t-Test: Paired Two Sample for Means
data analysis tool in step 3. The variable 1 range is A1:A7 and the variable 2 range is B1:B7.
The appropriate p-value is denoted P(T
t) two-tail. Its value of .08 does not allow us
to reject the null hypothesis at α  .05.
Appendix 10.4 Analysis of Variance Using Excel
Completely Randomized Design
In Section 10.5 we showed how analysis of variance could be used to test for the equal-
ity of k population means using data from a completely randomized design. To illustrate
how Excel can be used to test for the equality of k population means for this type of
experimental design, we show how to test whether the mean number of units produced per
week is the same for each assembly method in the Chemitech experiment introduced in
Section 10.4. The sample data are entered into worksheet rows 2 to 6 of columns A, B, and C

Interval Estimation of μ1 and μ2
We will use the data for the checking account balances example presented in Section 10.2. 
Begin by using the Data Set Manager to create a StatTools data set for these data using the 
procedure described in the appendix in Chapter 1. The following steps can be used to compute
a 95% confidence interval estimate of the difference between the two population means.
Step 1. Click the StatTools tab on the Ribbon
Step 2. In the Analyses group, click Statistical Inference
Step 3. Select the Confidence Interval option
Step 4. Choose Mean/Std. Deviation
Step 5. When the StatTools—Confidence Interval for Mean/Std. Deviation dialog box
appears: 
For Analysis Type, choose Two-Sample Analysis
In the Variables section, 
Select Cherry Grove
Select Beechmont
In the Confidence Intervals to Calculate section,
Select the For the Difference of Means option
Select 95% for the Confidence Level
Click OK
Because the sample size for Cherry Grove (n1  28) differs from the sample size for Beech-
mont (n2  22), StatTools will inform you of this difference after you click OK in step 5. A
dialog box will appear saying “The variable Beechmont contains missing data, which this
analysis will ignore.” Click OK. A Choose Variable Ordering dialog box then appears, indi-
cating that the analysis will compare the difference between the Cherry Grove data set and
the Beechmont data set. Click OK and the StatTools interval estimation output will appear.
Hypothesis Tests About μ1 and μ2
We will use the software evaluation example and the completion time data presented in Table
10.1. Begin by using the Data Set Manager to create a StatTools data set for these data using the
procedure described in the appendix in Chapter 1. The following steps can be used to test the
hypothesis: H0: μ1  μ2  0 against Ha: μ1  μ2  0.
Step 1. Click the StatTools tab on the Ribbon
Step 2. In the Analyses group, click Statistical Inference
Step 3. Select the Hypothesis Test option
Step 4. Choose Mean/Std. Deviation
Step 5. When the StatTools—Hypothesis Test for Mean/Std. Deviation dialog box 
appears: 
For Analysis Type, choose Two-Sample Analysis
In the Variables section,

Inferences About the Difference Between Two 
Population Means: Matched Samples
StatTools can be used to develop interval estimates and conduct hypothesis tests for the differ-
ence between population means for the matched samples case. We will use the matched-sample
completion times in Table 10.2 to illustrate.
Begin by using the Data Set Manager to create a StatTools data set for these data using the
procedure described in the appendix in Chapter 1. The following steps can be used to compute
a 95% confidence interval estimate of the difference between the population mean completion
times.
Step 1. Click the StatTools tab on the Ribbon
Step 2. In the Analyses group, click Statistical Inference
Step 3. Select the Confidence Interval option
Step 4. Choose Mean/Std. Deviation
Step 5. When the StatTools—Confidence Interval for Mean/Std. Deviation dialog box
appears: 
For Analysis Type, choose Paired-Sample Analysis
In the Variables section,

In the Confidence Intervals to Calculate section,
Select the For the Difference of Means option
Select 95% for the Confidence Level
If selected, remove the check in the For the Standard Deviation box
Click OK
When the Choose Variable Ordering dialog box appears, click OK
The confidence interval will appear.
Conducting hypothesis tests for the matched samples case is very similar to conducting
hypothesis tests for the difference in two means shown previously. Choose the Hypothesis
Test option in step 3. Then when the Hypothesis Test for Mean/Std. Deviation dialog box
appears, describe the type of hypothesis test desired.
Appendix 10.6 Analysis of Variance Using StatTools
In this appendix we show how StatTools can be used to test for the equality of k population
means for a completely randomized design. We use the Chemitech data in Table 10.3 to il-
lustrate. Begin by using the Data Set Manager to create a StatTools data set for these data
using the procedure described in the appendix in Chapter 1. The following steps can be used
to test for the equality of the three population means.

Statistics in Practice

United Way of Greater Rochester is a nonprofit organi-
zation dedicated to improving the quality of life for all
people in the seven counties it serves by meeting the
community’s most important human care needs.
The annual United Way/Red Cross fund-raising
campaign, conducted each spring, funds hundreds of
programs offered by more than 200 service providers.
These providers meet a wide variety of human needs—
physical, mental, and social—and serve people of all
ages, backgrounds, and economic means.
Because of enormous volunteer involvement,
United Way of Greater Rochester is able to hold its op-
erating costs at just eight cents of every dollar raised.
The United Way of Greater Rochester decided to
conduct a survey to learn more about community per-
ceptions of charities. Focus-group interviews were held
with professional, service, and general worker groups to
get preliminary information on perceptions. The infor-
mation obtained was then used to help develop the ques-
tionnaire for the survey. The questionnaire was
pretested, modified, and distributed to 440 individuals;
323 completed questionnaires were obtained.
A variety of descriptive statistics, including fre-
quency distributions and crosstabulations, were pro-
vided from the data collected. An important part of the
analysis involved the use of contingency tables and chi-
square tests of independence. One use of such statistical
tests was to determine whether perceptions of adminis-
trative expenses were independent of occupation.
The hypotheses for the test of independence were
H0: Perception of United Way administrative
expenses is independent of the occupation of the
respondent.
STATISTICS in PRACTICE
UNITED WAY*
ROCHESTER, NEW YORK
Ha: Perception of United Way administrative
expenses is not independent of the occupation of
the respondent.
Two questions in the survey provided the data for the sta-
tistical test. One question obtained data on perceptions of
the percentage of funds going to administrative expenses
(up to 10%, 11–20%, and 21% or more). The other ques-
tion asked for the occupation of the respondent.
The chi-square test at a .05 level of significance led
to rejection of the null hypothesis of independence and
to the conclusion that perceptions of United Way’s
administrative expenses did vary by occupation. Actual
administrative expenses were less than 9%, but 35% of
the respondents perceived that administrative expenses
were 21% or more. Hence, many had inaccurate percep-
tions of administrative costs. In this group, production-
line, clerical, sales, and professional-technical employees
had more inaccurate perceptions than other groups.
The community perceptions study helped United
Way of Rochester to develop adjustments to its pro-
grams and fund-raising activities. In this chapter, you
will learn how a statistical test of independence, such as
that described here, is conducted.

Many statistical applications call for a comparison of population proportions. In Section 11.1,
we describe statistical inferences concerning differences in the proportions for two popula-
tions. Two samples are required, one from each population, and the statistical inference is
based on the two sample proportions. The second section looks at a hypothesis test compar-
ing the proportions of a single multinomial population with the proportions stated in a null

hypothesis. One sample from the multinomial population is used, and the hypothesis test is
based on comparing the sample proportions with those stated in the null hypothesis. In the
last section of the chapter, we show how contingency tables can be used to test for the inde-
pendence of two variables. One sample is used for the test of independence, but measures on
two variables are required for each sampled element. Both Sections 11.2 and 11.3 rely on the
use of a chi-square statistical test.
11.1
Inferences About the Difference Between Two
Population Proportions
Letting p1 denote the proportion for population 1 and p2 denote the proportion for popula-
tion 2, we next consider inferences about the difference between the two population pro-
portions: p1  p2. To make an inference about this difference, we will select two
independent random samples consisting of n1 units from population 1 and n2 units from
population 2.
Interval Estimation of p1  p2
In the following example, we show how to compute a margin of error and develop an in-
terval estimate of the difference between two population proportions.
A tax preparation firm is interested in comparing the quality of work at two of its re-
gional offices. By randomly selecting samples of tax returns prepared at each office and
verifying the sample returns’ accuracy, the firm will be able to estimate the proportion of
erroneous returns prepared at each office. Of particular interest is the difference between
these proportions.
The difference between the two population proportions is given by p1  p2. The point esti-
mator of p1  p2 is as follows.
p1 
p2 
p¯1 
p¯2 
proportion of erroneous returns for population 1 (office 1)

Thus, the point estimator of the difference between two population proportions is the dif-
ference between the sample proportions of two independent simple random samples.
As with other point estimators, the point estimator 
1 
2 has a sampling distribution
that reflects the possible values of 
1 
2 if we repeatedly took two independent random
samples. The mean of this sampling distribution is p1  p2 and the standard error of 
1 

If the sample sizes are large enough that n1p1, n1(1  p1), n2p2, and n2(1  p2) are all greater
than or equal to 5, the sampling distribution of 
1 
2 can be approximated by a normal
distribution.
As we showed previously, an interval estimate is given by a point estimate  a margin
of error. In the estimation of the difference between two population proportions, an inter-
val estimate will take the following form:
With the sampling distribution of 
1 
2 approximated by a normal distribution, we
would like to use zα/2
as the margin of error. However, 
given by equation (11.2)
cannot be used directly because the two population proportions, p1 and p2, are unknown.
Using the sample proportion 
1 to estimate p1 and the sample proportion 
2 to estimate p2,
the margin of error is as follows.

The general form of an interval estimate of the difference between two population propor-
tions is as follows.

Returning to the tax preparation example, we find that independent simple random

Number of returns with errors  35

The sample proportions for the two offices follow.
The point estimate of the difference between the proportions of erroneous tax returns for
the two populations is 1 
2  .14  .09  .05. Thus, we estimate that office 1 has a .05,
or 5%, greater error rate than office 2.
Expression (11.4) can now be used to provide a margin of error and interval estimate
of the difference between the two population proportions. Using a 90% confidence interval

Thus, the margin of error is .045, and the 90% confidence interval is .005 to .095.
Hypothesis Tests About p1  p2
Let us now consider hypothesis tests about the difference between the proportions of two
populations. We focus on tests involving no difference between the two population pro-
portions. In this case, the three forms for a hypothesis test are as follows:
When we assume H0 is true as an equality, we have p1  p2  0, which is the same as say-
ing that the population proportions are equal, p1  p2.
We will base the test statistic on the sampling distribution of the point estimator 
1 
2.
In equation (11.2), we showed that the standard error of 
1 
2 is given by
Under the assumption H0 is true as an equality, the population proportions are equal and
p1  p2  p. In this case,

This test statistic applies to large sample situations where n1p1, n1(1  p1), n2p2, and
n2(1  p2) are all greater than or equal to 5.
Let us return to the tax preparation firm example and assume that the firm wants to use
a hypothesis test to determine whether the error proportions differ between the two offices.
A two-tailed test is required. The null and alternative hypotheses are as follows:
If H0 is rejected, the firm can conclude that the error rates at the two offices differ. We will
use α  .10 as the level of significance.
The sample data previously collected showed 1  .14 for the n1  250 returns sampled
at office 1 and 
2  .09 for the n2  300 returns sampled at office 2. We continue by 
computing the pooled estimate of p.
Using this pooled estimate and the difference between the sample proportions, the value of
the test statistic is as follows.
In computing the p-value for this two-tailed test, we first note that z  1.85 is in the upper
tail of the standard normal distribution. Using z  1.85 and the standard normal distribution
table, we find the area in the upper tail is 1.0000  .9678  .0322. Doubling this area for a 
two-tailed test, we find the p-value  2(.0322)  .0644. With the p-value less than α  .10,
H0 is rejected at the .10 level of significance. The firm can conclude that the error rates differ
between the two offices. This hypothesis testing conclusion is consistent with the earlier in-
terval estimation results that showed the interval estimate of the difference between the popu-
lation error rates at the two offices to be .005 to .095, with Office 1 having the higher error rate.

Hypothesis Test for Proportions 
of a Multinomial Population
In this section, we consider hypothesis tests concerning the proportion of elements in a
population belonging to each of several classes or categories. In contrast to the preceding
section, we deal with a single population: a multinomial population. The parameters of
the multinomial population are the proportion of elements belonging to each category; the
hypothesis tests we describe concern the value of those parameters. The multinomial proba-
bility distribution can be thought of as an extension of the binomial distribution to the case
of three or more categories of outcomes. On each trial of a multinomial experiment, one
and only one of the outcomes occurs. Each trial of the experiment is assumed independent,
and the probabilities of the outcomes stay the same for each trial.
As an example, consider the market share study being conducted by Scott Marketing
Research. Over the past year market shares stabilized at 30% for company A, 50% for

During the 2003 Super Bowl, Miller Lite Beer’s commercial referred to as “The Miller Lite
Girls” ranked among the top three most effective advertisements aired during the Super
Bowl (USA Today, December 29, 2003). The survey of advertising effectiveness, con-
ducted by USA Today’s Ad Track poll, reported separate samples by respondent age group
to learn about how the Super Bowl advertisement appealed to different age groups. The
following sample data apply to the “The Miller Lite Girls” commercial.

company B, and 20% for company C. Recently company C developed a “new and im-
proved” product to replace its current entry in the market. Company C retained Scott Mar-
keting Research to determine whether the new product will alter market shares.
In this case, the population of interest is a multinomial population; each customer is clas-
sified as buying from company A, company B, or company C. Thus, we have a multinomial
population with three outcomes. Let us use the following notation for the proportions.
Scott Marketing Research will conduct a sample survey and compute the proportion
preferring each company’s product. Ahypothesis test will then be conducted to see whether
the new product caused a change in market shares. Assuming that company C’s new prod-
uct will not alter the market shares, the null and alternative hypotheses are stated as follows.
If the sample results lead to the rejection of H0, Scott Marketing Research will have evi-
dence that the introduction of the new product affects market shares.
Let us assume that the market research firm has used a consumer panel of 200 customers
for the study. Each individual was asked to specify a purchase preference among the three
alternatives: company A’s product, company B’s product, and company C’s new product.
The 200 responses are summarized here.

Thus, we see that the expected frequency for each category is found by multiplying the 
sample size of 200 by the hypothesized proportion for the category.
The goodness of fit test now focuses on the differences between the observed fre-
quencies and the expected frequencies. Large differences between observed and expected

We now can perform a goodness of fit test that will determine whether the sample
of 200 customer purchase preferences is consistent with the null hypothesis. The goodness
of fit test is based on a comparison of the sample of observed results with the expected
results under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. Hence, the next step is to com-
pute expected purchase preferences for the 200 customers under the assumption that
pA  .30, pB  .50, and pC  .20. Doing so provides the expected results.
The assumptions for the
multinomial experiment
parallel those for the
binomial experiment with
the exception that the
multinomial has three or
more outcomes per trial.

Let us continue with the Scott Market Research example and use the sample data to test
the hypothesis that the multinomial population retains the proportions pA  .30, pB  .50,
and pC  .20. We will use an α  .05 level of significance. We proceed by using the
observed and expected frequencies to compute the value of the test statistic. With the ex-
pected frequencies all 5 or more, the computation of the chi-square test statistic is shown
in Table 11.1. Thus, we have  2  7.34.
We will reject the null hypothesis if the differences between the observed and expected
frequencies are large. Large differences between the observed and expected frequencies
will result in a large value for the test statistic. Thus the test of goodness of fit will always 
be an upper tail test. We can use the upper tail area for the test statistic and the p-value ap-
proach to determine whether the null hypothesis can be rejected. With k  1  3  1  2
degrees of freedom, Table 11.2 shows the following areas in the upper tail and their corre-
sponding chi-square ( 2) values:

Comparisons Involving Proportions and a Test of Independence
The test statistic  2  7.34 is between 5.991 and 7.378. Thus, the corresponding upper 
tail area or p-value must be between .05 and .025. With p-value  α  .05, we reject H0
and conclude that the introduction of the new product by company C will alter the current
market share structure. Minitab or Excel procedures provided in Appendix F at the back of
the book can be used to show that  2  7.34 provides a p-value  .0255.
Instead of using the p-value, we could use the critical value approach to draw the same
conclusion. With α  .05 and 2 degrees of freedom, the critical value for the test statistic
is 
The upper tail rejection rule becomes
With 7.34  5.991, we reject H0. The p-value approach and critical value approach provide
the same hypothesis testing conclusion.
Although no further conclusions can be made as a result of the test, we can compare the
observed and expected frequencies informally to obtain an idea of how the market share
structure may change. Considering company C, we find that the observed frequency of 
54 is larger than the expected frequency of 40. Because the expected frequency was based
on current market shares, the larger observed frequency suggests that the new product will
have a positive effect on company C’s market share. Comparisons of the observed and ex-
pected frequencies for the other two companies indicate that company C’s gain in market
share will hurt company A more than company B.
Let us summarize the general steps that can be used to conduct a goodness of fit test for
a hypothesized multinomial population distribution.

Where do women most often buy casual clothing? Data from the U.S. Shopper Database
provided the following percentages for women shopping at each of the various outlets (The
Wall Street Journal, January 28, 2004).
The other category included outlets such as Target, Kmart, and Sears as well as numerous
smaller specialty outlets. No individual outlet in this group accounted for more than 5% of
the women shoppers. A recent survey using a sample of 140 women shoppers in Atlanta,
Georgia, found 42 Walmart, 20 traditional department store, 8 JC Penney, 10 Kohl’s, 
21 mail order, and 39 other outlet shoppers. Does this sample suggest that women shop-

Test of Independence
Another important application of the chi-square distribution involves using sample data to
test for the independence of two variables. Let us illustrate the test of independence by con-
sidering the study conducted by the Alber’s Brewery of Tucson, Arizona. Alber’s manu-
factures and distributes three types of beer: light, regular, and dark. In an analysis of the
market segments for the three beers, the firm’s market research group raised the question
of whether preferences for the three beers differ among male and female beer drinkers. If
beer preference is independent of the gender of the beer drinker, one advertising campaign
will be initiated for all of Alber’s beers. However, if beer preference depends on the gender
of the beer drinker, the firm will tailor its promotions to different target markets.
A test of independence addresses the question of whether the beer preference (light, 
regular, or dark) is independent of the gender of the beer drinker (male, female). The hy-
potheses for this test of independence are
Table 11.3 can be used to describe the situation being studied.After identification of the pop-
ulation as all male and female beer drinkers, a sample can be selected and each individual
asked to state his or her preference for the three Alber’s beers. Every individual in the sam-
ple will be classified in one of the six cells in the table. For example, an individual may be
a male preferring regular beer [cell (1,2)], a female preferring light beer [cell (2,1)], a female
preferring dark beer [cell (2,3)], and so on. Because we have listed all possible combina-
tions of beer preference and gender or, in other words, listed all possible contingencies,
Table 11.3 is called a contingency table. The test of independence uses the contingency
table format and for that reason is sometimes referred to as a contingency table test.
Suppose a simple random sample of 150 beer drinkers is selected. After tasting each
beer, the individuals in the sample are asked to state their preference or first choice. The
crosstabulation in Table 11.4 summarizes the responses for the study. As we see, the data
for the test of independence are collected in terms of counts or frequencies for each cell or
category. Of the 150 individuals in the sample, 20 were men who favored light beer, 40 were
men who favored regular beer, 20 were men who favored dark beer, and so on.
The data in Table 11.4 are the observed frequencies for the six classes or categories. If
we can determine the expected frequencies under the assumption of independence between

Chapter 11
Comparisons Involving Proportions and a Test of Independence
beer preference and gender of the beer drinker, we can use the chi-square distribution to de-
termine whether there is a significant difference between observed and expected frequencies.
Expected frequencies for the cells of the contingency table are based on the following
rationale. First we assume that the null hypothesis of independence between beer prefer-
ence and gender of the beer drinker is true. Then we note that in the entire sample of 
150 beer drinkers, a total of 50 prefer light beer, 70 prefer regular beer, and 30 prefer dark
beer. In terms of fractions we conclude that ⁵⁰⁄₁₅₀  ¹⁄₃ of the beer drinkers prefer light beer,
⁷⁰⁄₁₅₀  ⁷⁄₁₅ prefer regular beer, and ³⁰⁄₁₅₀  ¹⁄₅ prefer dark beer. If the independence assump-
tion is valid, we argue that these fractions must be applicable to both male and female beer
drinkers. Thus, under the assumption of independence, we would expect the sample of 
80 male beer drinkers to show that (¹⁄₃)80  26.67 prefer light beer, (⁷⁄₁₅)80  37.33 prefer
regular beer, and (¹⁄₅)80  16 prefer dark beer. Application of the same fractions to the 
70 female beer drinkers provides the expected frequencies shown in Table 11.5.
Let eij denote the expected frequency for the contingency table category in row i and col-
umn j. With this notation, let us reconsider the expected frequency calculation for males
(row i  1) who prefer regular beer (column j  2); that is, expected frequency e12. Follow-
ing the preceding argument for the computation of expected frequencies, we can show that
This expression can be written slightly differently as
Note that 80 in the expression is the total number of males (row 1 total), 70 is the total num-
ber of individuals preferring regular beer (column 2 total), and 150 is the total sample size.
Hence, we see that

The double summation in equation (11.10) is used to indicate that the calculation must be
made for all the cells in the contingency table.
By reviewing the expected frequencies in Table 11.5, we see that the expected fre-
quencies are five or more for each category. We therefore proceed with the computation of
the chi-square test statistic. The calculations necessary to compute the chi-square test sta-
tistic for determining whether beer preference is independent of the gender of the beer
drinker are shown in Table 11.6. We see that the value of the test statistic is  2  6.12.
The number of degrees of freedom for the appropriate chi-square distribution is com-
puted by multiplying the number of rows minus 1 by the number of columns minus 1. With
two rows and three columns, we have (2  1)(3  1)  2 degrees of freedom. Just like the
test for goodness of fit, the test for independence rejects H0 if the differences between ob-
served and expected frequencies provide a large value for the test statistic. Thus the test for

The test for independence is
always a one-tailed test
with the rejection region in
the upper tail of the chi-
square distribution.
Using the formula for male beer drinkers who prefer dark beer, we find an expected 
frequency of e13  (80)(30)/150  16.00, as shown in Table 11.5. Use equation (11.9) to
verify the other expected frequencies shown in Table 11.5.
The test procedure for comparing the observed frequencies of Table 11.4 with the ex-
pected frequencies of Table 11.5 is similar to the goodness of fit calculations made in Sec-
tion 11.2. Specifically, the  2 value based on the observed and expected frequencies is
computed as follows.
Generalization of the expression shows that the following formula provides the expected
frequencies for a contingency table in the test of independence.

Computer software packages such as Minitab and Excel can be used to simplify the
computations required for tests of independence. The input to these computer procedures
is the contingency table of observed frequencies shown in Table 11.4. The software then
computes the expected frequencies, the value of the  2 test statistic, and the p-value auto-
matically. The Minitab and Excel procedures that can be used to conduct these tests of
independence are presented in Appendixes 11.1 and 11.2. The Minitab output for the
Alber’s Brewery test of independence is shown in Figure 11.1.

Although no further conclusions can be made as a result of the test, we can compare the
observed and expected frequencies informally to obtain an idea about the dependence
between beer preference and gender. Refer to Tables 11.4 and 11.5. We see that male beer
drinkers have higher observed than expected frequencies for both regular and dark beers,
whereas female beer drinkers have a higher observed than expected frequency only for light
beer. These observations give us insight about the beer preference differences between male
and female beer drinkers.
Let us summarize the steps in a contingency table test of independence.
NOTES AND COMMENTS
The test statistic for the chi-square tests in this
chapter requires an expected frequency of five for
each category. When a category has fewer than
five, it is often appropriate to combine two adjacent
categories to obtain an expected frequency of five
or more in each category.

Consumer Reports measures owner satisfaction of various automobiles by asking the 
survey question, “Considering factors such as price, performance, reliability, comfort 
and enjoyment, would you purchase this automobile if you had it to do all over again?” 
(Consumer Reports website, January 2009).  Sample data for 300 owners of four popular
midsize sedans are as follows.

four automobiles in terms of owner satisfaction.
c.
Twenty-three different automobiles were reviewed in the Consumer Reports midsize
sedan class. The overall owner satisfaction score for all automobiles in this class was
69. How do the United States manufactured automobiles (Impala and Taurus) com-
pare to the Japanese manufactured automobiles (Accord and Camry) in terms of owner
satisfaction? What is the implication of these findings on the future market share for
these  automobiles?

FlightStats, Inc., collects data on the number of flights scheduled and the number of flights
flown at major airports throughout the United States. FlightStats data showed that 56% of
flights scheduled at Newark, La Guardia, and Kennedy airports were flown during a three-
day snowstorm (The Wall Street Journal, February 21, 2006). All airlines say they always
operate within set safety parameters—if conditions are too poor, they don’t fly. The fol-
lowing data show a sample of 400 scheduled flights during the snowstorm.

Summary
In this chapter, we described statistical procedures for comparisons involving proportions
and the contingency table test for independence of two variables. In the first section, we
compared a proportion for one population with the same proportion from another popu-
lation. We described how to construct an interval estimate for the difference between the
proportions and how to conduct a hypothesis test to learn whether the difference between
the proportions was statistically significant.
In the second section, we focused on a single multinomial population. There we saw
how to conduct hypothesis tests to determine whether the sample proportions for the cate-
gories of the multinomial population were significantly different from the hypothesized val-
ues. The chi-square goodness of fit test was used to make the comparison.
The final section was concerned with tests of independence for two variables. A test of
independence for two variables is an extension of the methodology employed in the good-
ness of fit test for a multinomial population. A contingency table is used to determine the
observed and expected frequencies. Then a chi-square value is computed. Large chi-square
values, caused by large differences between observed and expected frequencies, lead to the
rejection of the null hypothesis of independence.
Glossary
Pooled estimator of p An estimator of a population proportion obtained by computing a
weighted average of the sample proportions obtained from two independent samples.
Multinomial population A population in which each element is assigned to one and only
one of several categories. The multinomial distribution extends the binomial distribution
from two to three or more outcomes.
Goodness of fit test A statistical test conducted to determine whether to reject a hypothe-
sized probability distribution for a population.
Contingency table A table used to summarize observed and expected frequencies for a test
of independence.

Case Problem A Bipartisan Agenda for Change
In a study conducted by Zogby International for the Democrat and Chronicle, more than
700 New Yorkers were polled to determine whether the New York state government works.
Respondents surveyed were asked questions involving pay cuts for state legislators,
restrictions on lobbyists, terms limits for legislators, and whether state citizens should be
able to put matters directly on the state ballot for a vote. The results regarding several pro-
posed reforms had broad support, crossing all demographic and political lines.
Suppose that a follow-up survey of 100 individuals who live in the western region of
New York was conducted. The party affiliation (Democrat, Independent, Republican) of
each individual surveyed was recorded, as well as the responses to the following three
questions.
1. Should legislative pay be cut for every day the state budget is late?
Yes ____
No ____
2. Should there be more restrictions on lobbyists?
Yes ____
No ____
3. Should there be term limits requiring that legislators serve a fixed number of years?
Yes ____
No ____
The responses were coded using 1 for a Yes response and 2 for a No response. The com-
plete data set is available on the data disk in the data set named NYReform.

Step 5 may be modified to provide different confidence levels, different hypothesized
values, and different forms of the hypotheses.
In the tax preparation example, the data are qualitative. Yes and No are used to indicate
whether an error is present. In modules involving proportions, Minitab calculates
proportions for the response coming second in alphabetic order. Thus, in the tax preparation
example, Minitab computes the proportion of Yes responses, which is the proportion we
wanted.
If Minitab’s alphabetical ordering does not compute the proportion for the response of
interest, we can fix it. Select any cell in the data column, go to the Minitab menu bar, and
select Editor  Column  Value Order. This sequence will provide the option of entering
a user-specified order. Simply make sure that the response of interest is listed second in the
define-an-order box. Minitab’s 2 Proportion routine will then provide the confidence inter-
val and hypothesis testing results for the population proportion of interest.
Finally, we note that Minitab’s 2 Proportion routine uses a computational procedure
different from the procedure described in the text. Thus, the Minitab output may provide
slightly different interval estimates and slightly different p-values. However, results from
the two methods should be close and are expected to provide the same interpretation and
conclusion.

Simple Linear Regression
Alliance Data Systems (ADS) provides transaction pro-
cessing, credit services, and marketing services for clients
in the rapidly growing customer relationship management
(CRM) industry. ADS clients are concentrated in four
industries: retail, petroleum/convenience stores, utilities,
and transportation. In 1983, Alliance began offering end-
to-end credit processing services to the retail, petroleum,
and casual dining industries; today it employs more than
6500 employees who provide services to clients around
the world. Operating more than 140,000 point-of-sale
terminals in the United States alone, ADS processes in
excess of 2.5 billion transactions annually. The company
ranks second in the United States in private label credit ser-
vices by representing 49 private label programs with nearly
72 million cardholders. In 2001, ADS made an initial pub-
lic offering and is now listed on the New York Stock 
Exchange.
As one of its marketing services, ADS designs direct
mail campaigns and promotions. With its database con-
taining information on the spending habits of more than
100 million consumers, ADS can target those consumers
most likely to benefit from a direct mail promotion. The
Analytical Development Group uses regression analysis to
build models that measure and predict the responsiveness
of consumers to direct market campaigns. Some regression
models predict the probability of purchase for individuals
receiving a promotion, and others predict the amount spent
by those consumers making a purchase.
For one particular campaign, a retail store chain
wanted to attract new customers. To predict the effect of
the campaign, ADS analysts selected a sample from the
consumer database, sent the sampled individuals promo-
tional materials, and then collected transaction data on
the consumers’ response. Sample data were collected on
the amount of purchase made by the consumers respond-
ing to the campaign, as well as a variety of consumer-
specific variables thought to be useful in predicting sales.
The consumer-specific variable that contributed most to
predicting the amount purchased was the total amount of
credit purchases at related stores over the past 39 months.
ADS analysts developed an estimated regression equation
relating the amount of purchase to the amount spent at
related stores:
where
Using this equation, we could predict that someone
spending $10,000 over the past 39 months at related
stores would spend $47.20 when responding to the direct
mail promotion. In this chapter, you will learn how to
develop this type of estimated regression equation.
The final model developed by ADS analysts also
included several other variables that increased the
predictive power of the preceding equation. Some of
these variables included the absence/presence of a bank
credit card, estimated income, and the average amount
spent per trip at a selected store. In Chapter 13 we will
learn how such additional variables can be incorporated
into a multiple regression model.

Managerial decisions often are based on the relationship between two or more variables.
For example, after considering the relationship between advertising expenditures and sales,
a marketing manager might attempt to predict sales for a given level of advertising expen-
ditures. In another case, a public utility might use the relationship between the daily high
temperature and the demand for electricity to predict electricity usage on the basis of next
month’s anticipated daily high temperatures. Sometimes a manager will rely on intuition to
judge how two variables are related. However, if data can be obtained, a statistical proce-
dure called regression analysis can be used to develop an equation showing how the vari-
ables are related.
In regression terminology, the variable being predicted is called the dependent vari-
able. The variable or variables being used to predict the value of the dependent variable are
called the independent variables. For example, in analyzing the effect of advertising ex-
penditures on sales, a marketing manager’s desire to predict sales would suggest making
sales the dependent variable. Advertising expenditure would be the independent variable
used to help predict sales. In statistical notation, y denotes the dependent variable and x
denotes the independent variable.
In this chapter we consider the simplest type of regression analysis involving one in-
dependent variable and one dependent variable in which the relationship between the vari-
ables is approximated by a straight line. It is called simple linear regression. Regression 
analysis involving two or more independent variables is called multiple regression 
analysis; multiple regression is covered in Chapter 13.

Simple Linear Regression Model
Armand’s Pizza Parlors is a chain of Italian-food restaurants located in a five-state area.
Armand’s most successful locations are near college campuses. The managers believe that
quarterly sales for these restaurants (denoted by y) are related positively to the size of the
student population (denoted by x); that is, restaurants near campuses with a large student
population tend to generate more sales than those located near campuses with a small stu-
dent population. Using regression analysis, we can develop an equation showing how the
dependent variable y is related to the independent variable x.
Regression Model and Regression Equation
In the Armand’s Pizza Parlors example, the population consists of all the Armand’s restau-
rants. For every restaurant in the population, there is a value of x (student population) and
a corresponding value of y (quarterly sales). The equation that describes how y is related to
x and an error term is called the regression model. The regression model used in simple
linear regression follows.
0 and 1 are referred to as the parameters of the model, and  (the Greek letter epsilon) is
a random variable referred to as the error term. The error term accounts for the variability
in y that cannot be explained by the linear relationship between x and y.

The statistical methods
used in studying the
relationship between two
variables were first
employed by Sir Francis
Galton (1822–1911).
Galton was interested in
studying the relationship
between a father’s height
and the son’s height.
Galton’s disciple, Karl
Pearson (1857–1936),
analyzed the relationship
between the father’s height
and the son’s height for
1078 pairs of subjects.

The population of all Armand’s restaurants can also be viewed as a collection of sub-
populations, one for each distinct value of x. For example, one subpopulation consists
of all Armand’s restaurants located near college campuses with 8000 students; another
subpopulation consists of all Armand’s restaurants located near college campuses with
9000 students; and so on. Each subpopulation has a corresponding distribution of y values.
Thus, a distribution of y values is associated with restaurants located near campuses with
8000 students; a distribution of y values is associated with restaurants located near cam-
puses with 9000 students; and so on. Each distribution of y values has its own mean or ex-
pected value. The equation that describes how the expected value of y, denoted E(y), is
related to x is called the regression equation. The regression equation for simple linear
regression follows.
The graph of the simple linear regression equation is a straight line; 0 is the y-intercept of
the regression line, 1 is the slope, and E(y) is the mean or expected value of y for a given
value of x.
Examples of possible regression lines are shown in Figure 12.1. The regression line in
Panel A shows that the mean value of y is related positively to x, with larger values of E( y)
associated with larger values of x. The regression line in Panel B shows the mean value of
y is related negatively to x, with smaller values of E( y) associated with larger values of x.
The regression line in Panel C shows the case in which the mean value of y is not related to
x; that is, the mean value of y is the same for every value of x.
Estimated Regression Equation
If the values of the population parameters 0 and 1 were known, we could use equation (12.2)
to compute the mean value of y for a given value of x. In practice, the parameter values are
not known and must be estimated using sample data. Sample statistics (denoted b0 and b1)
are computed as estimates of the population parameters 0 and 1. Substituting the values
of the sample statistics b0 and b1 for 0 and 1 in the regression equation, we obtain the

The graph of the estimated simple linear regression equation is called the estimated re-

least squares method can be used to compute the values of b0 and b1 in the estimated re-
gression equation.
In general, is the point estimator of E( y), the mean value of y for a given value of x.
Thus, to estimate the mean or expected value of quarterly sales for all restaurants located
near campuses with 10,000 students, Armand’s would substitute the value of 10,000 for x
in equation (12.3). In some cases, however, Armand’s may be more interested in predicting
sales for one particular restaurant. For example, suppose Armand’s would like to predict
quarterly sales for the restaurant located near Talbot College, a school with 10,000 students.
As it turns out, the best predictor of y for a given value of x is also provided by . Thus, to
predict quarterly sales for the restaurant located near Talbot College, Armand’s would also
substitute the value of 10,000 for x in equation (12.3).
Because the value of provides both a point estimate of E( y) for a given value of x and
a prediction of the value of y for a given value of x, we will refer to 
simply as the esti-
mated value of y. Figure 12.2 provides a summary of the estimation process for simple lin-
ear regression.

NOTES AND COMMENTS
1. Regression analysis cannot be interpreted as a pro-
cedure for establishing a cause-and-effect relation-
ship between variables. It can only indicate how 
or to what extent variables are associated with each
other. Any conclusions about cause and effect 
must be based upon the judgment of those indi-
viduals most knowledgeable about the application.
2. The regression equation in simple linear regres-
sion is E(y)  0  1x. More advanced texts
in regression analysis often write the regression
equation as E(yx)  0  1x to emphasize that
the regression equation provides the mean value
of y for a given value of x.
12.2
Least Squares Method
The least squares method is a procedure for using sample data to find the estimated re-
gression equation. To illustrate the least squares method, suppose data were collected from
a sample of 10 Armand’s Pizza Parlor restaurants located near college campuses. For the
ith observation or restaurant in the sample, xi is the size of the student population (in thou-
sands) and yi is the quarterly sales (in thousands of dollars). The values of xi and yi for the
10 restaurants in the sample are summarized in Table 12.1. We see that restaurant 1, with
x1  2 and y1  58, is near a campus with 2000 students and has quarterly sales of $58,000.
Restaurant 2, with x2  6 and y2  105, is near a campus with 6000 students and has quar-
terly sales of $105,000. The largest sales value is for restaurant 10, which is near a campus
with 26,000 students and has quarterly sales of $202,000.
Figure 12.3 is a scatter diagram of the data in Table 12.1. Student population is shown
on the horizontal axis and quarterly sales is shown on the vertical axis. Scatter diagrams
for regression analysis are constructed with the independent variable x on the horizontal
axis and the dependent variable y on the vertical axis. The scatter diagram enables us to ob-
serve the data graphically and to draw preliminary conclusions about the possible relation-
ship between the variables.
What preliminary conclusions can be drawn from Figure 12.3? Quarterly sales appear
to be higher at campuses with larger student populations. In addition, for these data the re-
lationship between the size of the student population and quarterly sales appears to be ap-
proximated by a straight line; indeed, a positive linear relationship is indicated between x
In simple linear regression,
each observation consists
of two values: one for the
independent variable and
one for the dependent
variable.

and y. We therefore choose the simple linear regression model to represent the relationship
between quarterly sales and student population. Given that choice, our next task is to use
the sample data in Table 12.1 to determine the values of b0 and b1 in the estimated simple
linear regression equation. For the ith restaurant, the estimated regression equation provides

where
With yi denoting the observed (actual) sales for restaurant i and 
in equation (12.4) repre-
senting the estimated value of sales for restaurant i, every restaurant in the sample will have
an observed value of sales yi and an estimated value of sales 
For the estimated regres-
sion line to provide a good fit to the data, we want the differences between the observed
sales values and the estimated sales values to be small.
The least squares method uses the sample data to provide the values of b0 and b1 that
minimize the sum of the squares of the deviations between the observed values of the de-
pendent variable yi and the estimated values of the dependent variable . The criterion for
the least squares method is given by expression (12.5).

Simple Linear Regression
Differential calculus can be used to show (see Appendix 12.1) that the values of b0 and b1
that minimize expression (12.5) can be found by using equations (12.6) and (12.7).
1An alternate formula for b1 is
This form of equation (12.6) is often recommended when using a calculator to compute b1.

Some of the calculations necessary to develop the least squares estimated regression
equation for Armand’s Pizza Parlors are shown in Table 12.2. With the sample of 10 restau-
rants, we have n  10 observations. Because equations (12.6) and (12.7) require and ,
we begin the calculations by computing and .
Using equations (12.6) and (12.7) and the information in Table 12.2, we can compute the
slope and intercept of the estimated regression equation for Armand’s Pizza Parlors. The
calculation of the slope (b1) proceeds as follows.

TABLE 12.2
CALCULATIONS FOR THE LEAST SQUARES ESTIMATED REGRESSION
EQUATION FOR ARMAND’S PIZZA PARLORS
The calculation of the y-intercept (b0) follows.
Thus, the estimated regression equation is
Figure 12.4 shows the graph of this equation on the scatter diagram.
The slope of the estimated regression equation (b1  5) is positive, implying that as stu-
dent population increases, sales increase. In fact, we can conclude (based on sales measured
in $1000s and student population in 1000s) that an increase in the student population of
1000 is associated with an increase of $5000 in expected sales; that is, quarterly sales are
expected to increase by $5 per student.
If we believe the least squares estimated regression equation adequately describes the
relationship between x and y, it would seem reasonable to use the estimated regression equa-
tion to predict the value of y for a given value of x. For example, if we wanted to predict
quarterly sales for a restaurant to be located near a campus with 16,000 students, we would
compute
Hence, we would predict quarterly sales of $140,000 for this restaurant. In the following
sections we will discuss methods for assessing the appropriateness of using the estimated
regression equation for estimation and prediction.

caution because outside

NOTES AND COMMENTS
The least squares method provides an estimated re-
gression equation that minimizes the sum of squared
deviations between the observed values of the de-
pendent variable yi and the estimated values of the
dependent variable 
This least squares criterion is
yˆi .
used to choose the equation that provides the best fit.
If some other criterion were used, such as minimiz-
ing the sum of the absolute deviations between yi and
a different equation would be obtained. In prac-
tice, the least squares method is the most widely used.

Sporty cars are designed to provide better handling, acceleration, and a more responsive driv-
ing experience than a typical sedan. But, even within this select group of cars, performance
as well as price can vary. Consumer Reports provided road-test scores and prices for the fol-
lowing 12 sporty cars (Consumer Reports website, October 2008). Prices are in thousands
of dollars and road-test scores are based on a 0–100 rating scale, with higher values indi-

To the Internal Revenue Service, the reasonableness of total itemized deductions depends
on the taxpayer’s adjusted gross income. Large deductions, which include charity and
medical deductions, are more reasonable for taxpayers with large adjusted gross incomes.
If a taxpayer claims larger than average itemized deductions for a given level of income,
the chances of an IRS audit are increased. Data (in thousands of dollars) on adjusted gross
income and the average or reasonable amount of itemized deductions follow.

Coefficient of Determination
For the Armand’s Pizza Parlors example, we developed the estimated regression equation
 60  5x to approximate the linear relationship between the size of the student popula-
tion x and quarterly sales y. A question now is, How well does the estimated regression
equation fit the data? In this section, we show that the coefficient of determination pro-
vides a measure of the goodness of fit for the estimated regression equation.
For the ith observation, the difference between the observed value of the dependent 
variable, yi, and the estimated value of the dependent variable, , is called the ith residual.
The ith residual represents the error in using 
to estimate yi. Thus, for the ith observation,

The value of SSE is a measure of the error in using the estimated regression equation to
estimate the values of the dependent variable in the sample.
In Table 12.3 we show the calculations required to compute the sum of squares due to
error for the Armand’s Pizza Parlors example. For instance, for restaurant 1 the values of
the independent and dependent variables are x1  2 and y1  58. Using the estimated
regression equation, we find that the estimated value of quarterly sales for restaurant 1 is 
 60  5(2)  70. Thus, the error in using 
to estimate y1 for restaurant 1 is y1 

use the sample mean as an estimate of quarterly sales at any given restaurant. Table 12.2
showed that for the sales data, yi  1300. Hence, the mean value of quarterly sales for the
sample of 10 Armand’s restaurants is  yi/n  1300/10  130. In Table 12.4 we show
the sum of squared deviations obtained by using the sample mean  130 to estimate the
value of quarterly sales for each restaurant in the sample. For the ith restaurant in the sam-
ple, the difference yi 
provides a measure of the error involved in using 
to estimate
sales. The corresponding sum of squares, called the total sum of squares, is denoted SST.

The sum at the bottom of the last column in Table 12.4 is the total sum of squares for
Armand’s Pizza Parlors; it is SST  15,730.
In Figure 12.5 we show the estimated regression line  60  5x and the line corre-
sponding to 
 130. Note that the points cluster more closely around the estimated re-
gression line than they do about the line  130. For example, for the 10th restaurant in
the sample we see that the error is much larger when  130 is used as an estimate of y10
than when 
 60  5(26)  190 is used. We can think of SST as a measure of how well
the observations cluster about the line and SSE as a measure of how well the observations
cluster about the line.
To measure how much the 
values on the estimated regression line deviate from ,
another sum of squares is computed. This sum of squares, called the sum of squares due to
regression, is denoted SSR.

From the preceding discussion, we should expect that SST, SSR, and SSE are related.
Indeed, the relationship among these three sums of squares provides one of the most im-
portant results in statistics.

SSR can be thought of as

SST, and SSE can be

Equation (12.11) shows that the total sum of squares can be partitioned into two compo-
nents, the sum of squares due to regression and the sum of squares due to error. Hence, if
the values of any two of these sum of squares are known, the third sum of squares can be
computed easily. For instance, in the Armand’s Pizza Parlors example, we already know 
that SSE  1530 and SST  15,730; therefore, solving for SSR in equation (12.11), we find
that the sum of squares due to regression is

Now let us see how the three sums of squares, SST, SSR, and SSE, can be used to pro-
vide a measure of the goodness of fit for the estimated regression equation. The estimated
regression equation would provide a perfect fit if every value of the dependent variable yi
happened to lie on the estimated regression line. In this case, yi 
would be zero for each
yˆi
For the Armand’s Pizza Parlors example, the value of the coefficient of determination is
When we express the coefficient of determination as a percentage, r2 can be interpreted as
the percentage of the total sum of squares that can be explained by using the estimated re-
gression equation. For Armand’s Pizza Parlors, we can conclude that 90.27% of the total
sum of squares can be explained by using the estimated regression equation  60  5x
to predict quarterly sales. In other words, 90.27% of the variability in sales can be explained
by the linear relationship between the size of the student population and sales. We should
be pleased to find such a good fit for the estimated regression equation.
Correlation Coefficient
In Chapter 3 we introduced the correlation coefficient as a descriptive measure of the
strength of linear association between two variables, x and y. Values of the correlation co-
efficient are always between 1 and 1. A value of 1 indicates that the two variables x
and y are perfectly related in a positive linear sense. That is, all data points are on a straight
line that has a positive slope. A value of 1 indicates that x and y are perfectly related in a
negative linear sense, with all data points on a straight line that has a negative slope. Val-
ues of the correlation coefficient close to zero indicate that x and y are not linearly related.
In Section 3.5 we presented the equation for computing the sample correlation coeffi-
cient. If a regression analysis has already been performed and the coefficient of determina-
tion r2 computed, the sample correlation coefficient can be computed as follows.

observation, resulting in SSE  0. Because SST  SSR  SSE, we see that for a perfect fit
SSR must equal SST, and the ratio (SSR/SST) must equal one. Poorer fits will result in larger
values for SSE. Solving for SSE in equation (12.11), we see that SSE  SST  SSR. Hence,
the largest value for SSE (and hence the poorest fit) occurs when SSR  0 and SSE  SST.
The ratio SSR/SST, which will take values between zero and one, is used to evaluate
the goodness of fit for the estimated regression equation. This ratio is called the coefficient
of determination and is denoted by r2.

Coefficient of Determination

where
b1  the slope of the estimated regression equation yˆ  b0  b1x
The sign for the sample correlation coefficient is positive if the estimated regression equa-
tion has a positive slope (b1  0) and negative if the estimated regression equation has a
negative slope (b1  0).
For the Armand’s Pizza Parlor example, the value of the coefficient of determination
corresponding to the estimated regression equation 
 60  5x is .9027. Because the
slope of the estimated regression equation is positive, equation (12.13) shows that the
sample correlation coefficient is 
With a sample correlation co-
efficient of rxy  .9501, we would conclude that a strong positive linear association
exists between x and y.
In the case of a linear relationship between two variables, both the coefficient of deter-
mination and the sample correlation coefficient provide measures of the strength of the re-
lationship. The coefficient of determination provides a measure between zero and one,
whereas the sample correlation coefficient provides a measure between 1 and 1. Al-
though the sample correlation coefficient is restricted to a linear relationship between two
variables, the coefficient of determination can be used for nonlinear relationships and for
relationships that have two or more independent variables. Thus, the coefficient of deter-
mination provides a wider range of applicability.

NOTES AND COMMENTS
1. In developing the least squares estimated re-
gression equation and computing the coefficient
of determination, we made no probabilistic as-
sumptions about the error term , and no statis-
tical tests for significance of the relationship
between x and y were conducted. Larger values
of r2 imply that the least squares line provides a
better fit to the data; that is, the observations are
more closely grouped about the least squares
line. But, using only r2, we can draw no conclu-
sion about whether the relationship between x
and y is statistically significant. Such a conclu-
sion must be based on considerations that in-
volve the sample size and the properties of the
appropriate sampling distributions of the least
squares estimators.
2. As a practical matter, for typical data found in
the social sciences, values of r2 as low as .25 are
often considered useful. For data in the physical
and life sciences, r2 values of .60 or greater are
often found; in fact, in some cases, r2 values
greater than .90 can be found. In business appli-
cations, r2 values vary greatly, depending on the
unique characteristics of each application.

Model Assumptions
In conducting a regression analysis, we begin by making an assumption about the appro-
priate model for the relationship between the dependent and independent variable(s). For
the case of simple linear regression, the assumed regression model is
y  0  1x  
Then the least squares method is used to develop values for b0 and b1, the estimates of the
model parameters 0 and 1, respectively. The resulting estimated regression equation is
We saw that the value of the coefficient of determination (r2) is a measure of the goodness
of fit of the estimated regression equation. However, even with a large value of r2, the es-
timated regression equation should not be used until further analysis of the appropriateness
of the assumed model has been conducted. An important step in determining whether the
assumed model is appropriate involves testing for the significance of the relationship. The
tests of significance in regression analysis are based on the following assumptions about 
the error term .

Figure 12.6 illustrates the model assumptions and their implications; note that in this
graphical interpretation, the value of E(y) changes according to the specific value of x con-
sidered. However, regardless of the x value, the probability distribution of  and hence the
probability distributions of y are normally distributed, each with the same variance. The 
specific value of the error  at any particular point depends on whether the actual value of
y is greater than or less than E(y).
At this point, we must keep in mind that we are also making an assumption or hypothe-
sis about the form of the relationship between x and y. That is, we assume that a straight

As we indicated previously, equation (12.14) is referred to as the regression
equation.
2. The variance of , denoted by σ 2, is the same for all values of x.
Implication: The variance of y about the regression line equals σ 2 and is the
same for all values of x.
3. The values of  are independent.
Implication: The value of  for a particular value of x is not related to the value
of  for any other value of x; thus, the value of y for a particular value of x is
not related to the value of y for any other value of x.
4. The error term  is a normally distributed random variable.
Implication: Because y is a linear function of , y is also a normally distrib-
uted random variable.

line represented by 0  1x is the basis for the relationship between the variables. We must
not lose sight of the fact that some other model, for instance y  0  1x2  , may turn
out to be a better model for the underlying relationship.
12.5
Testing for Significance
In a simple linear regression equation, the mean or expected value of y is a linear function
of x: E(y)  0  1x. If the value of 1 is zero, E(y)  0  (0)x  0. In this case, the
mean value of y does not depend on the value of x and hence we would conclude that x and
y are not linearly related. Alternatively, if the value of 1 is not equal to zero, we would con-
clude that the two variables are related. Thus, to test for a significant regression relationship,
we must conduct a hypothesis test to determine whether the value of 1 is zero. Two tests
are commonly used. Both require an estimate of σ2, the variance of  in the regression model.
Estimate of σ 2
From the regression model and its assumptions we can conclude that σ 2, the variance of ,
also represents the variance of the y values about the regression line. Recall that the devia-
tions of the y values about the estimated regression line are called residuals. Thus, SSE, the
sum of squared residuals, is a measure of the variability of the actual observations about the
estimated regression line. The mean square error (MSE) provides the estimate of σ 2; it is
SSE divided by its degrees of freedom.
With 
 b0  b1xi, SSE can be written as
Every sum of squares has associated with it a number called its degrees of freedom. Statis-
ticians have shown that SSE has n  2 degrees of freedom because two parameters (0 and
1) must be estimated to compute SSE. Thus, the mean square error is computed by divid-
ing SSE by n  2. MSE provides an unbiased estimator of σ 2. Because the value of MSE
provides an estimate of σ 2, the notation s2 is also used.
SSE  ( yi  yˆi )2  ( yi  b0  b1xi )2

In Section 12.3 we showed that for theArmand’s Pizza Parlors example, SSE  1530; hence,
provides an unbiased estimate of σ 2.
To estimate σ we take the square root of s2. The resulting value, s, is referred to as the
standard error of the estimate.

For the Armand’s Pizza Parlors example, 
In the follow-
ing discussion, we use the standard error of the estimate in the tests for a significant rela-
tionship between x and y.
t Test
The simple linear regression model is y  0  1x  . If x and y are linearly related, we
must have 1  0. The purpose of the t test is to see whether we can conclude that 1  0.
We will use the sample data to test the following hypotheses about the parameter 1.
If H0 is rejected, we will conclude that 1  0 and that a statistically significant rela-
tionship exists between the two variables. However, if H0 cannot be rejected, we will have
insufficient evidence to conclude that a significant relationship exists. The properties of
the sampling distribution of b1, the least squares estimator of 1, provide the basis for the
hypothesis test.
First, let us consider what would happen if we used a different random sample for the
same regression study. For example, suppose that Armand’s Pizza Parlors used the sales
records of a different sample of 10 restaurants. A regression analysis of this new sample
might result in an estimated regression equation similar to our previous estimated regres-
sion equation  60  5x. However, it is doubtful that we would obtain exactly the same
equation (with an intercept of exactly 60 and a slope of exactly 5). Indeed, b0 and b1, the
least squares estimators, are sample statistics with their own sampling distributions. The
properties of the sampling distribution of b1 follow.

Note that the expected value of b1 is equal to 1, so b1 is an unbiased estimator of 1.
Because we do not know the value of σ, we develop an estimate of

estimating σ with s in equation (12.17). Thus, we obtain the following estimate of

Let us conduct this test of significance for Armand’s Pizza Parlors at the α  .01 level
of significance. The test statistic is
The t distribution table shows that with n  2  10  2  8 degrees of freedom, t  3.355
provides an area of .005 in the upper tail. Thus, the area in the upper tail of the t distribution
corresponding to the test statistic t  8.62 must be less than .005. Because this test is a two-
tailed test, we double this value to conclude that the p-value associated with t  8.62 must
be less than 2(.005)  .01. Excel or Minitab show the p-value  .000. Because the p-value
is less than α  .01, we reject H0 and conclude that 1 is not equal to zero. This evidence is
sufficient to conclude that a significant relationship exists between student population and
quarterly sales. A summary of the t test for significance in simple linear regression follows.

The point estimator is b1 and the margin of error is tα/2
. The confidence coefficient asso-
sb1
ciated with this interval is 1  α, and tα/2 is the t value providing an area of α/2 in the up-
per tail of a t distribution with n  2 degrees of freedom. For example, suppose that we
wanted to develop a 99% confidence interval estimate of 1 for Armand’s Pizza Parlors.
From Table 2 of Appendix B we find that the t value corresponding to α  .01 and
n  2  10  2  8 degrees of freedom is t.005  3.355. Thus, the 99% confidence interval
estimate of 1 is
or 3.05 to 6.95.
In using the t test for significance, the hypotheses tested were
At the α  .01 level of significance, we can use the 99% confidence interval as an alterna-
tive for drawing the hypothesis testing conclusion for the Armand’s data. Because 0, the hy-
pothesized value of 1, is not included in the confidence interval (3.05 to 6.95), we can reject
H0 and conclude that a significant statistical relationship exists between the size of the stu-
dent population and quarterly sales. In general, a confidence interval can be used to test any
two-sided hypothesis about 1. If the hypothesized value of 1 is contained in the confi-
dence interval, do not reject H0. Otherwise, reject H0.
F Test
An F test, based on the F probability distribution, can also be used to test for significance
in regression. With only one independent variable, the F test will provide the same conclu-
sion as the t test; that is, if the t test indicates 1  0 and hence a significant relationship,
the F test will also indicate a significant relationship. But with more than one independent
variable, only the F test can be used to test for an overall significant relationship.
The logic behind the use of the F test for determining whether the regression relation-
ship is statistically significant is based on the development of two independent estimates of
σ 2. We explained how MSE provides an estimate of σ 2. If the null hypothesis H0: 1  0 is
true, the sum of squares due to regression, SSR, divided by its degrees of freedom provides
another independent estimate of σ 2. This estimate is called the mean square due to regres-
sion, or simply the mean square regression, and is denoted MSR. In general,
For the models we consider in this text, the regression degrees of freedom is always
equal to the number of independent variables in the model:
(12.20)
Because we consider only regression models with one independent variable in this chapter, we
have MSR  SSR/1  SSR. Hence, for Armand’s Pizza Parlors, MSR  SSR  14,200.
If the null hypothesis (H0: 1  0) is true, MSR and MSE are two independent estimates
of σ 2 and the sampling distribution of MSR/MSE follows an F distribution with numerator

degrees of freedom equal to one and denominator degrees of freedom equal to n  2. There-
fore, when 1  0, the value of MSR/MSE should be close to 1. However, if the null hy-
pothesis is false (1  0), MSR will overestimate σ 2 and the value of MSR/MSE will be
inflated; thus, large values of MSR/MSE lead to the rejection of H0 and the conclusion that
the relationship between x and y is statistically significant.
Let us conduct the F test for the Armand’s Pizza Parlors example. The test statistic is
The F distribution table (Table 4 of Appendix B) shows that with one degree of freedom in
the numerator and n  2  10  2  8 degrees of freedom in the denominator, F  11.26
provides an area of .01 in the upper tail. Thus, the area in the upper tail of the F distribution
corresponding to the test statistic F  74.25 must be less than .01. Thus, we conclude that
the p-value must be less than .01. Excel or Minitab show the p-value  .000. Because the
p-value is less than α  .01, we reject H0 and conclude that a significant relationship exists
between the size of the student population and quarterly sales. A summary of the F test for
significance in simple linear regression follows.

In Chapter 10 we covered analysis of variance (ANOVA) and showed how an ANOVA
table could be used to provide a convenient summary of the computational aspects of analy-
sis of variance. A similar ANOVA table can be used to summarize the results of the F test
for significance in regression. Table 12.5 is the general form of the ANOVA table for simple
linear regression. Table 12.6 is the ANOVA table with the F test computations performed
for Armand’s Pizza Parlors. Regression, Error, and Total are the labels for the three sources
of variation, with SSR, SSE, and SST appearing as the corresponding sum of squares in col-
umn 2. The degrees of freedom, 1 for SSR, n  2 for SSE, and n  1 for SST, are shown in
column 3. Column 4 contains the values of MSR and MSE, column 5 contains the value of
F  MSR/MSE, and column 6 contains the p-value corresponding to the F value in column 5.
Almost all computer printouts of regression analysis include an ANOVA table summary of
the F test for significance.
The F test and the t test

Some Cautions About the Interpretation 
of Significance Tests
Rejecting the null hypothesis H0: 1  0 and concluding that the relationship between x and
y is significant do not enable us to conclude that a cause-and-effect relationship is present
between x and y. Concluding a cause-and-effect relationship is warranted only if the ana-
lyst can provide some type of theoretical justification that the relationship is in fact causal.
In the Armand’s Pizza Parlors example, we can conclude that there is a significant rela-
tionship between the size of the student population x and quarterly sales y; moreover, the
estimated regression equation  60  5x provides the least squares estimate of the rela-
tionship. We cannot, however, conclude that changes in student population x cause changes
in quarterly sales y just because we identified a statistically significant relationship. The ap-
propriateness of such a cause-and-effect conclusion is left to supporting theoretical justifi-
cation and to good judgment on the part of the analyst. Armand’s managers felt that
increases in the student population were a likely cause of increased quarterly sales. Thus,
the result of the significance test enabled them to conclude that a cause-and-effect rela-
tionship was present.
In addition, just because we are able to reject H0: 1  0 and demonstrate statistical sig-
nificance does not enable us to conclude that the relationship between x and y is linear. We
can state only that x and y are related and that a linear relationship explains a significant
portion of the variability in y over the range of values for x observed in the sample. Fig-
ure 12.7 illustrates this situation. The test for significance calls for the rejection of the null
hypothesis H0: 1  0 and leads to the conclusion that x and y are significantly related, but
the figure shows that the actual relationship between x and y is not linear. Although the

in the sample, it becomes poor for x values outside that range.
Given a significant relationship, we should feel confident in using the estimated re-
gression equation for predictions corresponding to x values within the range of the x values
observed in the sample. For Armand’s Pizza Parlors, this range corresponds to values of x
between 2 and 26. Unless other reasons indicate that the model is valid beyond this range,
predictions outside the range of the independent variable should be made with caution. For
Armand’s Pizza Parlors, because the regression relationship has been found significant at
the .01 level, we should feel confident using it to predict sales for restaurants where the
associated student population is between 2000 and 26,000.

NOTES AND COMMENTS
1. The assumptions made about the error term
(Section 12.4) are what allow the tests of statis-
tical significance in this section. The properties
of the sampling distribution of b1 and the sub-
sequent t and F tests follow directly from these
assumptions.
2. Do not confuse statistical significance with
practical significance. With very large sample
sizes, statistically significant results can be ob-
tained for small values of b1; in such cases, one
must exercise care in concluding that the rela-
tionship has practical significance.
3. A test of significance for a linear relationship
between x and y can also be performed by using
the sample correlation coefficient rxy. With xy
denoting the population correlation coefficient,
the hypotheses are as follows.
A significant relationship can be concluded if H0
is rejected. The details of this test are provided
in more advanced texts. However, the t and F
tests presented previously in this section give
the same result as the test for significance using 
the correlation coefficient. Conducting a test for
significance using the correlation coefficient
therefore is not necessary if a t or F test has
already been conducted.

Using the Estimated Regression Equation 
for Estimation and Prediction
When using the simple linear regression model we are making an assumption about the re-
lationship between x and y. We then use the least squares method to obtain the estimated
simple linear regression equation. If a significant relationship exists between x and y, and
the coefficient of determination shows that the fit is good, the estimated regression equa-
tion should be useful for estimation and prediction.
Point Estimation
In the Armand’s Pizza Parlors example, the estimated regression equation 
 60  5x
provides an estimate of the relationship between the size of the student population x and
quarterly sales y. We can use the estimated regression equation to develop a point esti-
mate of the mean value of y for a particular value of x or to predict an individual value of
y corresponding to a given value of x. For instance, suppose Armand’s managers want a
point estimate of the mean quarterly sales for all restaurants located near college cam-
puses with 10,000 students. Using the estimated regression equation  60  5x, we see
that for x  10 (or 10,000 students),  60  5(10)  110. Thus, a point estimate of the
mean quarterly sales for all restaurants located near campuses with 10,000 students is
$110,000.
Now suppose Armand’s managers want to predict sales for an individual restaurant lo-
cated near Talbot College, a school with 10,000 students. In this case we are not interested
in the mean value for all restaurants located near campuses with 10,000 students; we are
just interested in predicting quarterly sales for one individual restaurant. As it turns out, the
point estimate for an individual value of y is the same as the point estimate for the mean
value of y. Hence, we would predict quarterly sales of  60  5(10)  110 or $110,000
for this one restaurant.
Interval Estimation
Point estimates do not provide any information about the precision associated with an esti-
mate. For that we must develop interval estimates much like those in Chapters 8, 10, and
11. The first type of interval estimate, a confidence interval, is an interval estimate of the
mean value of y for a given value of x. The second type of interval estimate, a prediction
interval, is used whenever we want an interval estimate of an individual value of y for a
given value of x. The point estimate of the mean value of y is the same as the prediction of
an individual value of y. But the interval estimates we obtain for the two cases are differ-
ent. The margin of error is larger for a prediction interval.

Chapter 12
Simple Linear Regression
Confidence Interval for the Mean Value of y
The estimated regression equation provides a point estimate of the mean value of y for a
given value of x. In developing the confidence interval, we will use the following notation.
Using this notation to estimate the mean sales for all Armand’s restaurants located near a
campus with 10,000 students, we have xp  10, and E(yp) denotes the unknown mean value
of sales for all restaurants where xp  10. The point estimate of E( yp) is provided by 

60  5(10)  110.
In general, we cannot expect 
to equal E( yp) exactly. If we want to make an inference
about how close 
is to the true mean value E( yp), we will have to estimate the variance of
. The formula for estimating the variance of 
given xp, denoted by 
, is
(12.22)
The estimate of the standard deviation of 
is given by the square root of equation (12.22).

CONFIDENCE INTERVALS FOR THE MEAN SALES y AT GIVEN VALUES OF STUDENT

In dollars, the 95% confidence interval for the mean quarterly sales of all restaurants near cam-
puses with 10,000 students is $110,000  $11,415. Therefore, the 95% confidence interval 
for the mean quarterly sales when the student population is 10,000 is $98,585 to $121,415.
Note that the estimated standard deviation of

This result implies that we can make the best or most precise estimate of the mean value 
of y whenever xp  . In fact, the further xp is from the larger xp 
becomes. As a re-
sult, confidence intervals for the mean value of y will become wider as xp deviates more
from . This pattern is shown graphically in Figure 12.8.
Prediction Interval for an Individual Value of y
Suppose that instead of estimating the mean value of sales for all Armand’s restaurants lo-

The 95% prediction interval for quarterly sales at Armand’s Talbot College restaurant can

ror of tα/2sind  2.306(14.69)  33.875, the 95% prediction interval is

that this value is the same as the point estimate of the mean sales for all restaurants 
located near campuses with 10,000 students.
To develop a prediction interval, we must first determine the variance associated with
using 
as a predictor of an individual value of y when x  xp. This variance is made up of
the sum of the following two components.
1. The variance of individual y values about the mean E( yp), an estimate of which is
given by s2
2. The variance associated with using
to estimate E( yp), an estimate of which is
given by
The formula for estimating the variance corresponding to the prediction of an individual

diction of sales for one specific restaurant located near a campus with 10,000 students is

In dollars, this prediction interval is $110,000  $33,875 or $76,125 to $143,875. Note that
the prediction interval for an individual restaurant located near a campus with 10,000 stu-
dents is wider than the confidence interval for the mean sales of all restaurants located near
campuses with 10,000 students. The difference reflects the fact that we are able to estimate
the mean value of y more precisely than we can predict an individual value of y.
Both confidence interval estimates and prediction interval estimates are most precise
when the value of the independent variable is xp  . The general shapes of confidence 
intervals and the wider prediction intervals are shown together in Figure 12.9.

Computer Solution
Performing the regression analysis computations without the help of a computer can be
quite time consuming. In this section we discuss how the computational burden can be min-
imized by using a computer software package such as Minitab.
We entered Armand’s student population and sales data into a Minitab worksheet. The
independent variable was named Pop and the dependent variable was named Sales to assist
with interpretation of the computer output. Using Minitab, we obtained the printout for
Armand’s Pizza Parlors shown in Figure 12.10.2 The interpretation of this printout follows.
1. Minitab prints the estimated regression equation as Sales  60.0  5.00 Pop.
2. A table is printed that shows the values of the coefficients b0 and b1, the standard
deviation of each coefficient, the t value obtained by dividing each coefficient 
value by its standard deviation, and the p-value associated with the t test. Because
the p-value is zero (to three decimal places), the sample results indicate that the null
hypothesis (H0: 1  0) should be rejected. Alternatively, we could compare 8.62
(located in the t-ratio column) to the appropriate critical value. This procedure for
the t test was described in Section 12.5.

the label Residual Error for the error source of variation. Note that DF is an abbre-

The ratio of these two values provides the F value of 74.25 and the corresponding
p-value of 0.000. Because the p-value is zero (to three decimal places), the rela-
tionship between Sales and Pop is judged statistically significant.

Automobile racing, high-performance driving schools, and driver education programs run
by automobile clubs continue to grow in popularity. All these activities require the partic-
ipant to wear a helmet that is certified by the Snell Memorial Foundation, a not-for-profit
organization dedicated to research, education, testing, and development of helmet safety
standards. Snell “SA” (Sports Application) rated professional helmets are designed for
auto racing and provide extreme impact resistance and high fire protection. One of the 
key factors in selecting a helmet is weight, since lower weight helmets tend to place less
stress on the neck. The following data show the weight and price for 18 SA helmets

Simple Linear Regression
In other words, the ith residual is the error resulting from using the estimated regression
equation to predict the value of the dependent variable. The residuals for the Armand’s Pizza
Parlors example are computed in Table 12.7. The observed values of the dependent vari-
able are in the second column and the estimated values of the dependent variable, obtained
using the estimated regression equation  60  5x, are in the third column. An analysis
of the corresponding residuals in the fourth column will help determine whether the as-
sumptions made about the regression model are appropriate.
Let us now review the regression assumptions for the Armand’s Pizza Parlors example.
A simple linear regression model was assumed.
y  0  1x  
(12.29)
This model indicates that we assumed quarterly sales (y) to be a linear function of the size
of the student population (x) plus an error term . In Section 12.4 we made the following
assumptions about the error term .
1. E()  0.
2. The variance of , denoted by σ 2, is the same for all values of x.
3. The values of  are independent.
4. The error term  has a normal distribution.
These assumptions provide the theoretical basis for the t test and the F test used to deter-
mine whether the relationship between x and y is significant, and for the confidence and 
prediction interval estimates presented in Section 12.6. If the assumptions about the error
term  appear questionable, the hypothesis tests about the significance of the regression re-
lationship and the interval estimation results may not be valid.

Residual Analysis: Validating Model Assumptions
529
The residuals provide the best information about ; hence an analysis of the residuals
is an important step in determining whether the assumptions for  are appropriate. Much of
residual analysis is based on an examination of graphical plots. In this section, we discuss
the following residual plots.
1. A plot of the residuals against values of the independent variable x
2. A plot of residuals against the predicted values of the dependent variable 
Residual Plot Against x
Aresidual plot against the independent variable x is a graph in which the values of the inde-
pendent variable are represented by the horizontal axis and the corresponding residual values
are represented by the vertical axis. A point is plotted for each residual. The first coordinate
for each point is given by the value of xi and the second coordinate is given by the corre-
sponding value of the residual yi 
i. For a residual plot against x with the Armand’s Pizza
Parlors data from Table 12.7, the coordinates of the first point are (2, 12), corresponding to
x1  2 and y1 
1  12; the coordinates of the second point are (6, 15), corresponding
to x2  6 and y2 
2  15; and so on. Figure 12.11 shows the resulting residual plot.
Before interpreting the results for this residual plot, let us consider some general pat-
terns that might be observed in any residual plot. Three examples appear in Figure 12.12.
If the assumption that the variance of  is the same for all values of x and the assumed re-
gression model is an adequate representation of the relationship between the variables, the
residual plot should give an overall impression of a horizontal band of points such as the
one in Panel A of Figure 12.12. However, if the variance of  is not the same for all values
of x—for example, if variability about the regression line is greater for larger values of x—
a pattern such as the one in Panel B of Figure 12.12 could be observed. In this case, the as-
sumption of a constant variance of  is violated. Another possible residual plot is shown in
Panel C. In this case, we would conclude that the assumed regression model is not an

adequate representation of the relationship between the variables. A curvilinear regression
model or multiple regression model should be considered.
Now let us return to the residual plot for Armand’s Pizza Parlors shown in Figure 12.11.
The residuals appear to approximate the horizontal pattern in Panel A of Figure 12.12.
Hence, we conclude that the residual plot does not provide evidence that the assumptions
made for Armand’s regression model should be challenged. At this point, we are confident
in the conclusion that Armand’s simple linear regression model is valid.
Experience and good judgment are always factors in the effective interpretation of resid-
ual plots. Seldom does a residual plot conform precisely to one of the patterns in Figure
12.12. Yet analysts who frequently conduct regression studies and frequently review resid-
ual plots become adept at understanding the differences between patterns that are reasonable
and patterns that indicate the assumptions of the model should be questioned. Aresidual plot
provides one technique to assess the validity of the assumptions for a regression model.
Residual Plot Against 
Another residual plot represents the predicted value of the dependent variable on the hori-
zontal axis and the residual values on the vertical axis. Apoint is plotted for each residual. The
first coordinate for each point is given by i and the second coordinate is given by the corre-
sponding value of the ith residual yi 
i. With the Armand’s data from Table 12.7, the co-
ordinates of the first point are (70, 12), corresponding to 1  70 and y1 
1  12; the
coordinates of the second point are (90, 15); and so on. Figure 12.13 provides the residual plot.
Note that the pattern of this residual plot is the same as the pattern of the residual plot against
the independent variable x. It is not a pattern that would lead us to question the model
assumptions. For simple linear regression, both the residual plot against x and the residual plot
against provide the same pattern. For multiple regression analysis, the residual plot against
is more widely used because of the presence of more than one independent variable.

NOTES AND COMMENTS
1. We use residual plots to validate the assump-
tions of a regression model. If our review
indicates that one or more assumptions are
questionable, a different regression model or a
transformation of the data should be considered.
The appropriate corrective action when the as-
sumptions are violated must be based on good
judgment; recommendations from an experi-
enced statistician can be valuable.
2. Analysis of residuals is the primary method
statisticians use to verify that the assumptions as-
sociated with a regression model are valid. Even
if no violations are found, it does not necessarily
follow that the model will yield good predictions.
However, if additional statistical tests support the
conclusion of significance and the coefficient of
determination is large, we should be able to de-
velop good estimates and predictions using the
estimated regression equation.

Summary
In this chapter we showed how regression analysis can be used to determine how a dependent
variable y is related to an independent variable x. In simple linear regression, the regression
model is y  0  1x  .The simple linear regression equation E(y)  0  1x describes
how the mean or expected value of y is related to x. We used sample data and the least squares
method to develop the estimated regression equation
 b0  b1x. In effect, b0 and b1 are
the sample statistics used to estimate the unknown model parameters 0 and 1.
The coefficient of determination was presented as a measure of the goodness of fit for
the estimated regression equation; it can be interpreted as the proportion of the variation in

the dependent variable y that can be explained by the estimated regression equation. We re-
viewed correlation as a descriptive measure of the strength of a linear relationship between
two variables.
The assumptions about the regression model and its associated error term  were
discussed, and t and F tests, based on those assumptions, were presented as a means for
determining whether the relationship between two variables is statistically significant. We
showed how to use the estimated regression equation to develop confidence interval
estimates of the mean value of y and prediction interval estimates of individual values of y.
The chapter concluded with a section on the computer solution of regression problems
and a section on the use of residual analysis to validate the model assumptions.

Independent variable The variable that is doing the predicting or explaining. It is de-
noted by x.
Simple linear regression Regression analysis involving one independent variable and one
dependent variable in which the relationship between the variables is approximated by a
straight line.
Regression model The equation that describes how y is related to x and an error term; in
simple linear regression, the regression model is y  0  1x  .
Regression equation The equation that describes how the mean or expected value of the
dependent variable is related to the independent variable; in simple linear regression,
E( y)  0  1x.
Estimated regression equation The estimate of the regression equation developed from
sample data by using the least squares method. For simple linear regression, the estimated
regression equation is  b0  b1x.
Least squares methodAprocedure used to develop the estimated regression equation. The
objective is to minimize (yi 
i)2.
Scatter diagram A graph of bivariate data in which the independent variable is on the hor-
izontal axis and the dependent variable is on the vertical axis.
Coefficient of determination A measure of the goodness of fit of the estimated regression
equation. It can be interpreted as the proportion of the variability in the dependent variable
y that is explained by the estimated regression equation.
ith residual The difference between the observed value of the dependent variable and the
value predicted using the estimated regression equation; for the ith observation the ith resid-
ual is yi 
i.
Correlation coefficient A measure of the strength of the linear relationship between two
variables (previously discussed in Chapter 3).
Mean square error The unbiased estimate of the variance of the error term σ 2. It is denoted
by MSE or s2.
Standard error of the estimate The square root of the mean square error, denoted by s. It
is the estimate of σ, the standard deviation of the error term .
ANOVA table The analysis of variance table used to summarize the computations associ-
ated with the F test for significance.
Confidence interval The interval estimate of the mean value of y for a given value of x.
Prediction interval The interval estimate of an individual value of y for a given value of x.
Residual analysis The analysis of the residuals used to determine whether the assumptions
made about the regression model appear to be valid. Residual analysis is also used to iden-
tify outliers and influential observations.

Reuters reported the market beta for Xerox was 1.22 (Reuters website, January 30, 2009).
Market betas for individual stocks are determined by simple linear regression. For each
stock, the dependent variable is its quarterly percentage return (capital appreciation plus
dividends) minus the percentage return that could be obtained from a risk-free investment
(the Treasury Bill rate is used as the risk-free rate). The independent variable is the quar-
terly percentage return (capital appreciation plus dividends) for the stock market (S&P
500) minus the percentage return from a risk-free investment. An estimated regression
equation is developed with quarterly data; the market beta for the stock is the slope of the
estimated regression equation (b1). The value of the market beta is often interpreted as a
measure of the risk associated with the stock. Market betas greater than 1 indicate that the
stock is more volatile than the market average; market betas less than 1 indicate that the
stock is less volatile than the market average. Suppose that the following figures 
are the differences between the percentage return and the risk-free return for 10 quarters for
the S&P 500 and Horizon Technology.

The Australian Public Service Commission’s State of the Service Report 2002–2003 re-
ported job satisfaction ratings for employees. One of the survey questions asked employ-
ees to choose the five most important workplace factors (from a list of factors) that most
affected how satisfied they were with their job. Respondents were then asked to indicate
their level of satisfaction with their top five factors. The following data show the percent-
age of employees who nominated the factor in their top five, and a corresponding satis-
faction rating measured using the percentage of employees who nominated the factor in
the top five and who were “very satisfied” or “satisfied” with the factor in their current
workplace (Australian Public Service Commission website).

Case Problem 1 Measuring Stock Market Risk
One measure of the risk or volatility of an individual stock is the standard deviation of the
total return (capital appreciation plus dividends) over several periods of time. Although 
the standard deviation is easy to compute, it does not take into account the extent to which the
price of a given stock varies as a function of a standard market index, such as the S&P 500.
As a result, many financial analysts prefer to use another measure of risk referred to as beta.
Betas for individual stocks are determined by simple linear regression. The dependent
variable is the total return for the stock and the independent variable is the total return for the
stock market.* For this case problem we will use the S&P 500 index as the measure of the
total return for the stock market, and an estimated regression equation will be developed us-
ing monthly data. The beta for the stock is the slope of the estimated regression equation (b1).
The data contained in the file named Beta provides the total return (capital appreciation plus
dividends) over 36 months for eight widely traded common stocks and the S&P 500.
The value of beta for the stock market will always be 1; thus, stocks that tend to rise and
fall with the stock market will also have a beta close to 1. Betas greater than 1 indicate that
the stock is more volatile than the market, and betas less than 1 indicate that the stock is
less volatile than the market. For instance, if a stock has a beta of 1.4, it is 40% more volatile
than the market, and if a stock has a beta of .4, it is 60% less volatile than the market. 
*Various sources use different approaches for computing betas. For instance, some sources subtract the return that could be
obtained from a risk-free investment (e.g., T-bills) from the dependent variable and the independent variable before com-
puting the estimated regression equation. Some also use different indexes for the total return of the stock market; for instance,
Value Line computes betas using the New York Stock Exchange composite index.

Case Problem 3 Alumni Giving
Alumni donations are an important source of revenue for colleges and universities. If ad-
ministrators could determine the factors that influence increases in the percentage of alumni
who make a donation, they might be able to implement policies that could lead to increased
revenues. Research shows that students who are more satisfied with their contact with
teachers are more likely to graduate. As a result, one might suspect that smaller class sizes
and lower student-faculty ratios might lead to a higher percentage of satisfied graduates,
which in turn might lead to increases in the percentage of alumni who make a donation.
Table 12.8 shows data for 48 national universities (America’s Best Colleges, Year 2000 ed.).
The column labeled % of Classes Under 20 shows the percentage of classes offered with
fewer than 20 students. The column labeled Student/Faculty Ratio is the number of students
enrolled divided by the total number of faculty. Finally, the column labeled Alumni Giving
Rate is the percentage of alumni that made a donation to the university.
Managerial Report
1. Develop numerical and graphical summaries of the data.
2. Use regression analysis to develop an estimated regression equation that could be
used to predict the alumni giving rate given the percentage of classes with fewer than
20 students.
3. Use regression analysis to develop an estimated regression equation that could be
used to predict the alumni giving rate given the student-faculty ratio.
4. Which of the two estimated regression equations provides the best fit? For this es-
timated regression equation, perform an analysis of the residuals and discuss your
findings and conclusions.
5. What conclusions and recommendations can you derive from your analysis?
Case Problem 4 PGA Tour Statistics
The Professional Golfers Association (PGA) maintains data on performance and earnings
for members of the PGA Tour. The top 125 players based on total earnings in PGA Tour
events are exempt for the following season. Making the top 125 money list is important be-
cause a player who is “exempt” has qualified to be a full-time member of the PGA tour for
the following season. 
During recent years on the PGA Tour there have been significant advances in the tech-
nology of golf balls and golf clubs, and this technology has been one of the major reasons
for the increase in the average driving distance of PGA Tour players. In 1992, the average
driving distance was 260 yards, but in 2003 this increased to 286 yards. PGA Tour pros are
hitting the ball farther than ever before, but how important is driving distance in terms of a
player’s performance? And what effect has this increased distance had on the players’
accuracy? To investigate these issues, year-end performance data for the 125 players who
had the highest total earnings in PGA Tour events for 2008 are contained in the file named
PGATour (PGA Tour website, 2009). Each row of the data set corresponds to a PGA Tour
player, and the data have been sorted based upon total earnings. Descriptions for the data
follow.
Money: Total earnings in PGA Tour events.
Scoring Average: The average number of strokes per completed round.

DrDist (Driving Distance): DrDist is the average number of yards per measured drive. On the
PGA Tour, driving distance is measured on two holes per round. Care is taken to select two
holes which face in opposite directions to counteract the effect of wind. Drives are measured
to the point at which they come to rest regardless of whether they are in the fairway or not. 
DrAccu (Driving Accuracy): The percentage of time a tee shot comes to rest in the fairway
(regardless of club). Driving accuracy is measured on every hole, excluding par 3’s.
GIR (Greens in Regulation): The percentage of time a player was able to hit the green in regu-
lation. A green is considered hit in regulation if any portion of the ball is touching the putting
surface after the GIR stroke has been taken. The GIR stroke is determined by subtracting 2 from
par (first stroke on a par 3, second on a par 4, third on a par 5). In other words, a green is con-
sidered hit in regulation if the player has reached the putting surface in par minus two strokes.
Managerial Report
1. Develop numerical and graphical summaries of the data. 
2. Use regression analysis to investigate the relationship between Scoring Average and
DrDist. Does it appear that players who drive the ball farther have lower average
scores?
3. Use regression analysis to investigate the relationship between Scoring Average and
DrAccu. Does it appear that players who are more accurate in hitting the fairway
have lower average scores?
4. Use regression analysis to investigate the relationship between Scoring Average and
GIR. Does it appear that players who are more accurate in hitting greens in regula-
tion have lower average scores?
5. Which of the three variables (DrDist, DrAccu, and GIR) appears to be the most sig-
nificant factor in terms of a player’s average score?
6. Treating DrDist as the independent variable and DrAccu as the dependent variable,
investigate the relationship between driving distance and driving accuracy.
Appendix 12.1 Regression Analysis Using Minitab

Appendix 12.2 Regression Analysis Using Excel
In this appendix we will illustrate how Excel’s Regression tool can be used to perform 
the regression analysis computations for the Armand’s Pizza Parlors problem. Refer to
Figure 12.14 as we describe the steps involved. The labels Restaurant, Population, and Sales
are entered into cells A1:C1 of the worksheet. To identify each of the 10 observations, we
entered the numbers 1 through 10 into cells A2:A11. The sample data are entered into cells
B2:C11. The following steps describe how to use Excel to produce the regression results.
Step 1. Click the Data tab on the Ribbon
Step 2. In the Analysis group, click Data Analysis
Step 3. Choose Regression from the list of Analysis Tools
Step 4. Click OK
Step 5. When the Regression dialog box appears:
Enter C1:C11 in the Input Y Range box
Enter B1:B11 in the Input X Range box
Select Labels
Select Confidence Level
Enter 99 in the Confidence Level box
Select Output Range
Enter A13 in the Output Range box
(Any upper-left-hand corner cell indicating where the output is to begin
may be entered here.)
Click OK
The first section of the output, titled Regression Statistics, contains summary statistics such
as the coefficient of determination (R Square). The second section of the output, entitled
ANOVA, contains the analysis of variance table. The last section of the output, which is not
titled, contains the estimated regression coefficients and related information. We will begin
our discussion of the interpretation of the regression output with the information contained
in cells A28:I30.
Interpretation of Estimated Regression Equation Output
The y intercept of the estimated regression line, b0  60, is shown in cell B29, and the slope
of the estimated regression line, b1  5, is shown in cell B30. The label Intercept in cell A29
and the label Population in cell A30 are used to identify these two values.

In Section 12.5 we showed that the estimated standard deviation of b1 is
 .5803.
Note that the value in cell C30 is .5803. The label Standard Error in cell C28 is Excel’s way
of indicating that the value in cell C30 is the standard error, or standard deviation, of b1. Re-
call that the t test for a significant relationship required the computation of the t statistic,
t  b1
. For the Armand’s data, the value of t that we computed was t  5/.5803  8.62.
The label in cell D28, t Stat, reminds us that cell D30 contains the value of the t test statistic.
The value in cell E30 is the p-value associated with the t test for significance. Excel has
displayed the p-value in cell E30 using scientific notation. To obtain the decimal value, we
move the decimal point 5 places to the left, obtaining a value of .0000255. Because the 
p-value  .0000255  α  .01, we can reject H0 and conclude that we have a significant
relationship between student population and quarterly sales.
The information in cells F28:I30 can be used to develop confidence interval estimates
of the y-intercept and slope of the estimated regression equation. Excel always provides the
lower and upper limits for a 95% confidence interval. Recall that in step 4 we selected Con-
fidence Level and entered 99 in the Confidence Level box. As a result, Excel’s Regression
tool also provides the lower and upper limits for a 99% confidence interval. The value in
cell H30 is the lower limit for the 99% confidence interval estimate of 1 and the value in

cell I30 is the upper limit. Thus, after rounding, the 99% confidence interval estimate of 1
is 3.05 to 6.95. The values in cells F30 and G30 provide the lower and upper limits for the
95% confidence interval. Thus, the 95% confidence interval is 3.66 to 6.34.
Interpretation of ANOVA Output
The information in cells A22:F26 is a summary of the analysis of variance computations.
The three sources of variation are labeled Regression, Residual, and Total. The label df in
cell B23 stands for degrees of freedom, the label SS in cell C23 stands for sum of squares,
and the label MS in cell D23 stands for mean square.
In Section 12.5 we stated that the mean square error, obtained by dividing the error or
residual sum of squares by its degrees of freedom, provides an estimate of σ 2. The value
in cell D25, 191.25, is the mean square error for the Armand’s regression output. In Sec-
tion 12.5 we showed that an F test could also be used to test for significance in regression.
The value in cell F24, .0000255, is the p-value associated with the F test for significance.
Because the p-value  .0000255  α  .01, we can reject H0 and conclude that we have a
significant relationship between student population and quarterly sales.The label Excel uses
to identify the p-value for the F test for significance, shown in cell F23, is Significance F.
Interpretation of Regression Statistics Output
The coefficient of determination, .9027, appears in cell B17; the corresponding label, R Square,
is shown in cell A17. The square root of the coefficient of determination provides the sample
correlation coefficient of .9501 shown in cell B16. Note that Excel uses the label Multiple R
(cell A16) to identify this value. In cell A19, the label Standard Error is used to identify the
value of the standard error of the estimate shown in cell B19. Thus, the standard error of 
the estimate is 13.8293. We caution the reader to keep in mind that in the Excel output, the
label Standard Error appears in two different places. In the Regression Statistics section of
the output, the label Standard Error refers to the estimate of σ. In the Estimated Regression
Equation section of the output, the label Standard Error refers to
, the standard deviation
of the sampling distribution of b1.
Appendix 12.3 Regression Analysis Using StatTools
In this appendix we show how StatTools can be used to perform the regression analysis
computations for the Armand’s Pizza Parlors problem. Begin by using the Data Set Man-
ager to create a StatTools data set for these data using the procedure described in the 
appendix in Chapter 1. The following steps describe how StatTools can be used to provide
the regression results.
Step 1. Click the StatTools tab on the Ribbon
Step 2. In the Analyses group, click Regression and Classification
Step 3. Choose the Regression option
Step 4. When the StatTools - Regression dialog box appears:
Select Multiple in the Regression Type box
In the Variables section,
Click the Format button and select Unstacked
In the column labeled I select Population
In the column labeled D select Sales
Click OK
The regression analysis output will appear in a new worksheet.

International Paper is the world’s largest paper and for-
est products company. The company employs more than
117,000 people in its operations in nearly 50 countries,
and exports its products to more than 130 nations. Inter-
national Paper produces building materials such as lum-
ber and plywood; consumer packaging materials such as
disposable cups and containers; industrial packaging
materials such as corrugated boxes and shipping con-
tainers; and a variety of papers for use in photocopiers,
printers, books, and advertising materials.
To make paper products, pulp mills process wood
chips and chemicals to produce wood pulp. The wood
pulp is then used at a paper mill to produce paper prod-
ucts. In the production of white paper products, the pulp
must be bleached to remove any discoloration. A key
bleaching agent used in the process is chlorine dioxide,
which, because of its combustible nature, is usually pro-
duced at a pulp mill facility and then piped in solution
form into the bleaching tower of the pulp mill. To im-
prove one of the processes used to produce chlorine
dioxide, researchers studied the process’s control and
efficiency. One aspect of the study looked at the chemical-
feed rate for chlorine dioxide production.
To produce the chlorine dioxide, four chemicals
flow at metered rates into the chlorine dioxide generator.
The chlorine dioxide produced in the generator flows to
an absorber where chilled water absorbs the chlorine
dioxide gas to form a chlorine dioxide solution. The
solution is then piped into the paper mill. A key part of
controlling the process involves the chemical-feed rates.
Historically, experienced operators set the chemical-
feed rates, but this approach led to overcontrol by the
operators. Consequently, chemical engineers at the mill
requested that a set of control equations, one for each
chemical feed, be developed to aid the operators in set-
ting the rates.
Using multiple regression analysis, statistical ana-
lysts developed an estimated multiple regression equa-
tion for each of the four chemicals used in the process.
Each equation related the production of chlorine dioxide
to the amount of chemical used and the concentration
level of the chlorine dioxide solution. The resulting set
of four equations was programmed into a microcom-
puter at each mill. In the new system, operators enter the
concentration of the chlorine dioxide solution and the
desired production rate; the computer software then cal-
culates the chemical feed needed to achieve the desired
production rate. After the operators began using the con-
trol equations, the chlorine dioxide generator efficiency
increased, and the number of times the concentrations
fell within acceptable ranges increased significantly.
This example shows how multiple regression analy-
sis can be used to develop a better bleaching process for
producing white paper products. In this chapter we will
discuss how computer software packages are used for
such purposes. Most of the concepts introduced in Chap-
ter 12 for simple linear regression can be directly extended
to the multiple regression case.
Multiple regression analysis assisted in the
development of a better bleaching process for making
white paper products.

In Chapter 12 we presented simple linear regression and demonstrated its use in develop-
ing an estimated regression equation that describes the relationship between two variables.
Recall that the variable being predicted or explained is called the dependent variable and
the variable being used to predict or explain the dependent variable is called the indepen-
dent variable. In this chapter we continue our study of regression analysis by considering
situations involving two or more independent variables. This subject area, called multiple
regression analysis, enables us to consider more factors and thus obtain better estimates
than are possible with simple linear regression.
13.1
Multiple Regression Model
Multiple regression analysis is the study of how a dependent variable y is related to two or
more independent variables. In the general case, we will use p to denote the number of in-
dependent variables.
Regression Model and Regression Equation
The concepts of a regression model and a regression equation introduced in the preceding
chapter are applicable in the multiple regression case. The equation that describes how the
dependent variable y is related to the independent variables x1, x2, . . . , xp and an error term
is called the multiple regression model. We begin with the assumption that the multiple
regression model takes the following form.
In the multiple regression model, 0, 1, 2, . . . , p are the parameters and the error term 
(the Greek letter epsilon) is a random variable. A close examination of this model reveals
that y is a linear function of x1, x2, . . . , xp (the 0  1x1  2x2  . . .  pxp part) plus the
error term . The error term accounts for the variability in y that cannot be explained by the
linear effect of the p independent variables.
In Section 13.4 we will discuss the assumptions for the multiple regression model and
. One of the assumptions is that the mean or expected value of  is zero. A consequence 
of this assumption is that the mean or expected value of y, denoted E(y), is equal to
0  1x1  2x2  . . .  pxp. The equation that describes how the mean value of y is re-
lated to x1, x2, . . . , xp is called the multiple regression equation.
Estimated Multiple Regression Equation
If the values of 0, 1, 2, . . . , p were known, equation (13.2) could be used to compute
the mean value of y at given values of x1, x2, . . . , xp. Unfortunately, these parameter values
will not, in general, be known and must be estimated from sample data. A simple ran-
dom sample is used to compute sample statistics b0, b1, b2, . . . , bp that are used as the point

The estimation process for multiple regression is shown in Figure 13.1.
13.2
Least Squares Method
In Chapter 12, we used the least squares method to develop the estimated regression equa-
tion that best approximated the straight line relationship between the dependent and inde-
pendent variables. This same approach is used to develop the estimated multiple regression
equation. The least squares criterion is restated as follows.

The estimated values of the dependent variable are computed by using the estimated mul-
tiple regression equation,
As expression (13.4) shows, the least squares method uses sample data to provide the val-
ues of b0, b1, b2, . . . , bp that make the sum of squared residuals [the deviations between the
observed values of the dependent variable ( yi) and the estimated values of the dependent
variable ( )] a minimum.
In Chapter 12 we presented formulas for computing the least squares estimators b0 and
b1 for the estimated simple linear regression equation  b0  b1x. With relatively small
data sets, we were able to use those formulas to compute b0 and b1 by manual calculations.
In multiple regression, however, the presentation of the formulas for the regression coeffi-
cients b0, b1, b2, . . . , bp involves the use of matrix algebra and is beyond the scope of this
text. Therefore, in presenting multiple regression, we focus on how computer software
packages can be used to obtain the estimated regression equation and other information.
The emphasis will be on how to interpret the computer output rather than on how to make
the multiple regression computations.
An Example: Butler Trucking Company
As an illustration of multiple regression analysis, we will consider a problem faced by the
ButlerTrucking Company, an independent trucking company in southern California.Amajor
portion of Butler’s business involves deliveries throughout its local area. To develop better
work schedules, the managers want to estimate the total daily travel time for their drivers.
Initially the managers believed that the total daily travel time would be closely related
to the number of miles traveled in making the daily deliveries. A simple random sample of
10 driving assignments provided the data shown in Table 13.1 and the scatter diagram
shown in Figure 13.2. After reviewing this scatter diagram, the managers hypothesized that
the simple linear regression model y  0  1x1   could be used to describe the rela-
tionship between the total travel time (y) and the number of miles traveled (x1). To estimate

the parameters 0 and 1, the least squares method was used to develop the estimated re-
gression equation.
(13.5)
In Figure 13.3, we show the Minitab computer output from applying simple linear
regression to the data in Table 13.1. The estimated regression equation is
At the .05 level of significance, the F value of 15.81 and its corresponding p-value of .004
indicate that the relationship is significant; that is, we can reject H0: 1  0 because the 
p-value is less than α  .05. Note that the same conclusion is obtained from the t value 
of 3.98 and its associated p-value of .004. Thus, we can conclude that the relationship be-
tween the total travel time and the number of miles traveled is significant; longer travel
times are associated with more miles traveled. With a coefficient of determination (ex-
pressed as a percentage) of R-sq  66.4%, we see that 66.4% of the variability in travel time
can be explained by the linear effect of the number of miles traveled. This finding is fairly
good, but the managers might want to consider adding a second independent variable to 
explain some of the remaining variability in the dependent variable.
In attempting to identify another independent variable, the managers felt that the num-
ber of deliveries could also contribute to the total travel time. The Butler Trucking data, with
the number of deliveries added, are shown in Table 13.2. The Minitab computer solution
with both miles traveled (x1) and number of deliveries (x2) as independent variables is 
shown in Figure 13.4. The estimated regression equation is

In the next section we will discuss the use of the coefficient of multiple determination in
measuring how good a fit is provided by this estimated regression equation. Before doing
so, let us examine more carefully the values of b1  .0611 and b2  .923 in equation (13.6).
Note on Interpretation of Coefficients
One observation can be made at this point about the relationship between the estimated
regression equation with only the miles traveled as an independent variable and the equation
that includes the number of deliveries as a second independent variable. The value of b1
is not the same in both cases. In simple linear regression, we interpret b1 as an estimate of
the change in y for a one-unit change in the independent variable. In multiple regression
analysis, this interpretation must be modified somewhat. That is, in multiple regression analy-
sis, we interpret each regression coefficient as follows: bi represents an estimate of the change
in y corresponding to a one-unit change in xi when all other independent variables are held con-
stant. In the Butler Trucking example involving two independent variables, b1  .0611. Thus,

of one mile in the distance traveled when the number of deliveries is held constant. Similarly,

tion of the data they reported for 20 boats with a length of between 20 and 22 feet fol-
lows (WaterSki, January/February 2006). Beam is the maximum width of the boat in
inches, HP is the horsepower of the boat’s engine, and TopSpeed is the top speed in
miles per hour (mph).

Would you expect more reliable and better performing cars to cost more? Consumer Re-
ports provided reliability ratings, overall road-test scores, and prices for affordable family
sedans, midpriced family sedans, and large sedans (Consumer Reports, February 2008). A
portion of the data follows. Reliability was rated on a 5-point scale from poor (1) to ex-
cellent (5). The road-test score was rated on a 100-point scale, with higher values indicat-
ing better performance. The complete data set is contained in the file named Sedans.

The National Basketball Association (NBA) records a variety of statistics for each team.
Four of these statistics are the proportion of games won (PCT), the proportion of field goals
made by the team (FG%), the proportion of three-point shots made by the team’s opponent
(Opp 3 Pt%), and the number of turnovers committed by the team’s opponent (Opp TO).
The following data show the values of these statistics for the 29 teams in the NBA for a

SST  SSR  SSE
Because of the computational difficulty in computing the three sums of squares, we rely
on computer packages to determine those values. The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) part
of the Minitab output in Figure 13.4 shows the three values for the Butler Trucking prob-
lem with two independent variables: SST  23.900, SSR  21.601, and SSE  2.299. With
only one independent variable (number of miles traveled), the Minitab output in Figure 13.3
shows that SST  23.900, SSR  15.871, and SSE  8.029. The value of SST is the same
in both cases because it does not depend on , but SSR increases and SSE decreases when
a second independent variable (number of deliveries) is added. The implication is that the
estimated multiple regression equation provides a better fit for the observed data.
In Chapter 12, we used the coefficient of determination, r2  SSR/SST, to measure the
goodness of fit for the estimated regression equation. The same concept applies to multiple
regression. The term multiple coefficient of determination indicates that we are measur-
ing the goodness of fit for the estimated multiple regression equation. The multiple coeffi-
cient of determination, denoted R2, is computed as follows.

Multiple Coefficient of Determination

NOTES AND COMMENTS
If the value of R2 is small and the model contains a
large number of independent variables, the adjusted
coefficient of determination can take a negative
value; in such cases, Minitab sets the adjusted co-
efficient of determination to zero.
ADJUSTED MULTIPLE COEFFICIENT OF DETERMINATION
(13.9)
R2a  1  (1  R2) 
n  1
n  p  1
If a variable is added to the
model, R2 becomes larger
even if the variable added
is not statistically
significant. The adjusted
multiple coefficient of
determination compensates
for the number of
independent variables in
the model.
The multiple coefficient of determination can be interpreted as the proportion of the vari-
ability in the dependent variable that can be explained by the estimated multiple regression
equation. Hence, when multiplied by 100, it can be interpreted as the percentage of the vari-
ability in y that can be explained by the estimated regression equation.
In the two-independent-variable Butler Trucking example, with SSR  21.601 and
SST  23.900, we have
Therefore, 90.4% of the variability in travel time y is explained by the estimated multiple
regression equation with miles traveled and number of deliveries as the independent vari-
ables. In Figure 13.4, we see that the multiple coefficient of determination (expressed as a
percentage) is also provided by the Minitab output; it is denoted by R-sq  90.4%.
Figure 13.3 shows that the R-sq value for the estimated regression equation with only
one independent variable, number of miles traveled (x1), is 66.4%. Thus, the percentage of
the variability in travel times that is explained by the estimated regression equation in-
creases from 66.4% to 90.4% when number of deliveries is added as a second independent
variable. In general, R2 always increases as independent variables are added to the model.
Many analysts prefer adjusting R2 for the number of independent variables to avoid 
overestimating the impact of adding an independent variable on the amount of variability 
explained by the estimated regression equation. With n denoting the number of observations
and p denoting the number of independent variables, the adjusted multiple coefficient of
determination is computed as follows.
R2  21.601
23.900  .904
For the Butler Trucking example with n  10 and p  2, we have
Thus, after adjusting for the two independent variables, we have an adjusted multiple coef-
ficient of determination of .88. This value (expressed as a percentage) is provided by the
Minitab output in Figure 13.4 as R-sq(adj)  87.6%; the value we calculated differs be-
cause we used a rounded value of R2 in the calculation.
R2a  1  (1  .904) 
10  1
10  2  1  .88
Adding independent
variables causes the
prediction errors to become
smaller, thus reducing 
the sum of squares due to
error, SSE. Because SSR 
SST  SSE, when SSE
becomes smaller, SSR
becomes larger, causing 
R2  SSR/SST to increase.

Implication: The value of  for a particular set of values for the independent
variables is not related to the value of  for any other set of values.

deviation between the y value and the expected value of y given by

Implication: Because 0, 1, . . . , p are constants for the given values of x1,
x2, . . . , xp, the dependent variable y is also a normally distributed random
variable.
To obtain more insight about the form of the relationship given by equation (13.11),
consider the following two-independent-variable multiple regression equation.
The graph of this equation is a plane in three-dimensional space. Figure 13.5 provides an
example of such a graph. Note that the value of  shown is the difference between the ac-
tual y value and the expected value of y, E(y), when

In regression analysis, the term response variable is often used in place of the term de-
pendent variable. Furthermore, since the multiple regression equation generates a plane or
surface, its graph is called a response surface.

Testing for Significance
In this section we show how to conduct significance tests for a multiple regression rela-
tionship. The significance tests we used in simple linear regression were a t test and an 
F test. In simple linear regression, both tests provide the same conclusion; that is, if the null

hypothesis is rejected, we conclude that 1  0. In multiple regression, the t test and the 
F test have different purposes.
1. The F test is used to determine whether a significant relationship exists between the
dependent variable and the set of all the independent variables; we will refer to the
F test as the test for overall significance.
2. If the F test shows an overall significance, the t test is used to determine whether
each of the individual independent variables is significant. A separate t test is con-
ducted for each of the independent variables in the model; we refer to each of these
t tests as a test for individual significance.
In the material that follows, we will explain the F test and the t test and apply each to the
Butler Trucking Company example.
F Test
The multiple regression model as defined in Section 13.4 is
The hypotheses for the F test involve the parameters of the multiple regression model.
If H0 is rejected, the test gives us sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that one or
more of the parameters is not equal to zero and that the overall relationship between y and
the set of independent variables x1, x2, . . . , xp is significant. However, if H0 cannot be re-
jected, we do not have sufficient evidence to conclude that a significant relationship is
present.
Before describing the steps of the F test, we need to review the concept of mean square.
A mean square is a sum of squares divided by its corresponding degrees of freedom. In the
multiple regression case, the total sum of squares has n  1 degrees of freedom, the sum of
squares due to regression (SSR) has p degrees of freedom, and the sum of squares due to 
error has n  p  1 degrees of freedom. Hence, the mean square due to regression (MSR)
is SSR/p and the mean square due to error (MSE) is SSE/(n  p  1).
(13.12)
and
(13.13)
As discussed in Chapter 12, MSE provides an unbiased estimate of σ 2, the variance of the
error term . If H0: 1  2  . . .  p  0 is true, MSR also provides an unbiased esti-
mate of σ 2, and the value of MSR/MSE should be close to 1. However, if H0 is false, MSR
overestimates σ 2 and the value of MSR/MSE becomes larger. To determine how large the
value of MSR/MSE must be to reject H0, we make use of the fact that if H0 is true and the
assumptions about the multiple regression model are valid, the sampling distribution of
MSR/MSE is an F distribution with p degrees of freedom in the numerator and n  p  1
in the denominator. A summary of the F test for significance in multiple regression
follows.

Note that the F value on the Minitab output is F  32.88; the value we calculated differs
because we used rounded values for MSR and MSE in the calculation. Using α  .01, the
p-value  0.000 in the last column of the ANOVA table (Figure 13.6) indicates that we can
reject H0: 1  2  0 because the p-value is less than α  .01. Alternatively, Table 4 of
Appendix B shows that with two degrees of freedom in the numerator and seven degrees of
freedom in the denominator, F.01  9.55. With 32.9 	 9.55, we reject H0: 1  2  0 and
conclude that a significant relationship is present between travel time y and the two inde-
pendent variables, miles traveled and number of deliveries.
As noted previously, the mean square error provides an unbiased estimate of σ 2, the
variance of the error term . Referring to Figure 13.6, we see that the estimate of σ 2 is
MSE  .328. The square root of MSE is the estimate of the standard deviation of the error
term. As defined in Section 12.5, this standard deviation is called the standard error of the
estimate and is denoted s. Hence, we have 
Note that the value
of the standard error of the estimate appears in the Minitab output in Figure 13.6.
Table 13.3 is the general ANOVA table that provides the F test results for a multiple re-
gression model. The value of the F test statistic appears in the last column and can be com-
pared to Fα with p degrees of freedom in the numerator and n  p  1 degrees of freedom
in the denominator to make the hypothesis test conclusion. By reviewing the Minitab output
for Butler Trucking Company in Figure 13.6, we see that Minitab’s ANOVA table contains
this information. Moreover, Minitab also provides the p-value corresponding to the F test
statistic.

If the F test shows that the multiple regression relationship is significant, a t test can be con-
ducted to determine the significance of each of the individual parameters. The t test for in-

Let us conduct the t test for the Butler Trucking regression problem. Refer to the sec-
tion of Figure 13.6 that shows the Minitab output for the t-ratio calculations. Values of b1,

Using equation (13.15), we obtain the test statistic for the hypotheses involving parameters
1 and 2.
Note that both of these t-ratio values and the corresponding p-values are provided by the
Minitab output in Figure 13.6. Using α  .01, the p-values of .000 and .004 on the Minitab
output indicate that we can reject H0: 1  0 and H0: 2  0. Hence, both parameters are
statistically significant. Alternatively, Table 2 of Appendix B shows that with n  p  1 
10  2  1  7 degrees of freedom, t.005  3.499. With 6.18 	 3.499, we reject H0: 1  0.
Similarly, with 4.18 	 3.499, we reject H0: 2  0.
Multicollinearity
We use the term independent variable in regression analysis to refer to any variable being
used to predict or explain the value of the dependent variable. The term does not mean, how-
ever, that the independent variables themselves are independent in any statistical sense. On
the contrary, most independent variables in a multiple regression problem are correlated to
some degree with one another. For example, in the Butler Trucking example involving the
two independent variables x1 (miles traveled) and x2 (number of deliveries), we could treat
the miles traveled as the dependent variable and the number of deliveries as the indepen-
dent variable to determine whether those two variables are themselves related. We could
then compute the sample correlation coefficient rx1x2 to determine the extent to which the
variables are related. Doing so yields rx1x2  .16. Thus, we find some degree of linear associa-
tion between the two independent variables. In multiple regression analysis, multicollinearity
refers to the correlation among the independent variables.
To provide a better perspective of the potential problems of multicollinearity, let us con-
sider a modification of the Butler Trucking example. Instead of x2 being the number of de-
liveries, let x2 denote the number of gallons of gasoline consumed. Clearly, x1 (the miles
traveled) and x2 are related; that is, we know that the number of gallons of gasoline used
depends on the number of miles traveled. Hence, we would conclude logically that x1 and
x2 are highly correlated independent variables.
Assume that we obtain the equation  b0  b1x1  b2x2 and find that the F test shows
the relationship to be significant. Then suppose we conduct a t test on 1 to determine
whether 1  0, and we cannot reject H0: 1  0. Does this result mean that travel time is

not related to miles traveled? Not necessarily. What it probably means is that with x2 already
in the model, x1 does not make a significant contribution to determining the value of y. This
interpretation makes sense in our example; if we know the amount of gasoline consumed,
we do not gain much additional information useful in predicting y by knowing the miles
traveled. Similarly, a t test might lead us to conclude 2  0 on the grounds that, with x1 in
the model, knowledge of the amount of gasoline consumed does not add much.
To summarize, in t tests for the significance of individual parameters, the difficulty
caused by multicollinearity is that it is possible to conclude that none of the individual pa-
rameters are significantly different from zero when an F test on the overall multiple re-
gression equation indicates a significant relationship. This problem is avoided when there
is little correlation among the independent variables.
Statisticians have developed several tests for determining whether multicollinearity is
high enough to cause problems. According to the rule of thumb test, multicollinearity is a
potential problem if the absolute value of the sample correlation coefficient exceeds .7 for
any two of the independent variables. The other types of tests are more advanced and be-
yond the scope of this text.
If possible, every attempt should be made to avoid including independent variables that
are highly correlated. In practice, however, strict adherence to this policy is rarely possible.
When decision makers have reason to believe substantial multicollinearity is present, they
must realize that separating the effects of the individual independent variables on the de-
pendent variable is difficult.
A sample correlation
coefficient greater than .7
or less than .7 for two
independent variables is a
rule of thumb warning of
potential problems with
multicollinearity.
When the independent
variables are highly
correlated, it is not possible
to determine the separate
effect of any particular
independent variable on the
dependent variable.
NOTES AND COMMENTS
Ordinarily, multicollinearity does not affect the
way in which we perform our regression analysis or
interpret the output from a study. However, when
multicollinearity is severe—that is, when two or
more of the independent variables are highly corre-
lated with one another—we can have difficulty in-
terpreting the results of t tests on the individual
parameters. In addition to the type of problem il-
lustrated in this section, severe cases of multi-
collinearity have been shown to result in least
squares estimates that have the wrong sign. That is,
in simulated studies where researchers created the
underlying regression model and then applied the
least squares technique to develop estimates of 0,
1, 2, and so on, it has been shown that under con-
ditions of high multicollinearity the least squares
estimates can have a sign opposite that of the para-
meter being estimated. For example, 2 might ac-
tually be 10 and b1, its estimate, might turn out to
be 2. Thus, little faith can be placed in the indi-
vidual coefficients if multicollinearity is present to
a high degree.

Using the Estimated Regression Equation 
for Estimation and Prediction
The procedures for estimating the mean value of y and predicting an individual value of y
in multiple regression are similar to those in regression analysis involving one independent
variable. First, recall that in Chapter 12 we showed that the point estimate of the expected
value of y for a given value of x was the same as the point estimate of an individual value
of y. In both cases, we used  b0  b1x as the point estimate.
In multiple regression we use the same procedure. That is, we substitute the given val-
ues of x1, x2, . . . , xp into the estimated regression equation and use the corresponding value
of as the point estimate. Suppose that for the Butler Trucking example we want to use the
estimated regression equation involving x1 (miles traveled) and x2 (number of deliveries) to
develop two interval estimates:
1. A confidence interval of the mean travel time for all trucks that travel 100 miles and
make two deliveries
2. A prediction interval of the travel time for one specific truck that travels 100 miles
and makes two deliveries
Using the estimated regression equation  .869  .0611x1  .923x2 with x1  100 and
x2  2, we obtain the following value of :
Hence, the point estimate of travel time in both cases is approximately seven hours.

Using the Estimated Regression Equation for Estimation and Prediction
577
To develop interval estimates for the mean value of y and for an individual value of y,
we use a procedure similar to that for regression analysis involving one independent vari-
able. The formulas required are beyond the scope of the text, but computer packages for
multiple regression analysis will often provide confidence intervals once the values of x1,
x2, . . . , xp are specified by the user. In Table 13.4 we show the 95% confidence and predic-
tion intervals for the Butler Trucking example for selected values of x1 and x2; these values
were obtained using Minitab. Note that the interval estimate for an individual value of y is
wider than the interval estimate for the expected value of y. This difference simply reflects
the fact that for given values of x1 and x2 we can estimate the mean travel time for all trucks
with more precision than we can predict the travel time for one specific truck.

Categorical Independent Variables
Thus far, the examples we have considered involved quantitative independent variables
such as student population, distance traveled, and number of deliveries. In many situations,
however, we must work with categorical independent variables such as gender (male,
female), method of payment (cash, credit card, check), and so on. The purpose of this sec-
tion is to show how categorical variables are handled in regression analysis. To illustrate
the use and interpretation of a categorical independent variable, we will consider a problem
facing the managers of Johnson Filtration, Inc.
An Example: Johnson Filtration, Inc.
Johnson Filtration, Inc., provides maintenance service for water-filtration systems through-
out southern Florida. Customers contact Johnson with requests for maintenance service on
their water-filtration systems. To estimate the service time and the service cost, Johnson’s
managers want to predict the repair time necessary for each maintenance request. Hence, re-
pair time in hours is the dependent variable. Repair time is believed to be related to two fac-
tors, the number of months since the last maintenance service and the type of repair problem
(mechanical or electrical). Data for a sample of 10 service calls are reported in Table 13.5.

Let y denote the repair time in hours and x1 denote the number of months since the last
maintenance service. The regression model that uses only x1 to predict y is
Using Minitab to develop the estimated regression equation, we obtained the output shown
in Figure 13.7. The estimated regression equation is
(13.16)
At the .05 level of significance, the p-value of .016 for the t (or F) test indicates that the
number of months since the last service is significantly related to repair time. R-sq  53.4%
indicates that x1 alone explains 53.4% of the variability in repair time.
To incorporate the type of repair into the regression model, we define the following variable.

Multiple Regression
In regression analysis x2 is called a dummy or indicator variable. Using this dummy vari-
able, we can write the multiple regression model as
Table 13.6 is the revised data set that includes the values of the dummy variable. Using
Minitab and the data in Table 13.6, we can develop estimates of the model parameters. The

( p-value  .005) are statistically significant. In addition, R-sq  85.9% and R-sq(adj) 
81.9% indicate that the estimated regression equation does a good job of explaining the vari-
ability in repair times. Thus, equation (13.17) should prove helpful in estimating the repair
time necessary for the various service calls.
Interpreting the Parameters
The multiple regression equation for the Johnson Filtration example is
(13.18)
To understand how to interpret the parameters 0, 1, and 2 when a categorical variable is
present, consider the case when x2  0 (mechanical repair). Using E( y  mechanical) to de-
note the mean or expected value of repair time given a mechanical repair, we have
(13.19)
Similarly, for an electrical repair (x2  1), we have
(13.20)
Comparing equations (13.19) and (13.20), we see that the mean repair time is a linear func-
tion of x1 for both mechanical and electrical repairs. The slope of both equations is 1, but
the y-intercept differs. The y-intercept is 0 in equation (13.19) for mechanical repairs and
( 0  2) in equation (13.20) for electrical repairs. The interpretation of 2 is that it indi-
cates the difference between the mean repair time for an electrical repair and the mean re-
pair time for a mechanical repair.
If 2 is positive, the mean repair time for an electrical repair will be greater than that
for a mechanical repair; if 2 is negative, the mean repair time for an electrical repair will
be less than that for a mechanical repair. Finally, if 2  0, there is no difference in the mean
repair time between electrical and mechanical repairs and the type of repair is not related
to the repair time.
Using the estimated multiple regression equation
 .93  .388x1  1.26x2, we see
that .93 is the estimate of 0 and 1.26 is the estimate of 2. Thus, when x2  0 (mechanical
repair)
(13.21)
and when x2  1 (electrical repair)
(13.22)
In effect, the use of a dummy variable for type of repair provides two estimated regression
equations that can be used to predict the repair time, one corresponding to mechanical re-
pairs and one corresponding to electrical repairs. In addition, with b2  1.26, we learn that,
on average, electrical repairs require 1.26 hours longer than mechanical repairs.
Figure 13.9 is the plot of the Johnson data from Table 13.6. Repair time in hours ( y) is
represented by the vertical axis and months since last service (x1) is represented by the 
horizontal axis. A data point for a mechanical repair is indicated by an M and a data point
for an electrical repair is indicated by an E. Equations (13.21) and (13.22) are plotted on the

corresponding to mechanical repairs and one corresponding to electrical repairs.
More Complex Categorical Variables
Because the categorical variable for the Johnson Filtration example had two levels (me-
chanical and electrical), defining a dummy variable with zero indicating a mechanical re-
pair and one indicating an electrical repair was easy. However, when a categorical variable
has more than two levels, care must be taken in both defining and interpreting the dummy
variables. As we will show, if a categorical variable has k levels, k  1 dummy variables are
required, with each dummy variable being coded as 0 or 1.
For example, suppose a manufacturer of copy machines organized the sales territories
for a particular state into three regions: A, B, and C. The managers want to use regression
analysis to help predict the number of copiers sold per week. With the number of units sold
as the dependent variable, they are considering several independent variables (the number
of sales personnel, advertising expenditures, and so on). Suppose the managers believe sales
region is also an important factor in predicting the number of copiers sold. Because sales
region is a categorical variable with three levels,A, B and C, we will need 3  1  2 dummy
variables to represent the sales region. Each variable can be coded 0 or 1 as follows.
x2 
1 if sales region C
0 otherwise
x1 
1 if sales region B
0 otherwise
A categorical variable with
k levels must be modeled
using k  1 dummy
variables. Care must be
taken in defining and
interpreting the dummy
variables.

Observations corresponding to region A would be coded x1  0, x2  0; observations cor-
responding to region B would be coded x1  1, x2  0; and observations corresponding to
region C would be coded x1  0, x2  1.
The regression equation relating the expected value of the number of units sold, E( y),
to the dummy variables would be written as
To help us interpret the parameters 0, 1, and 2, consider the following three variations of
the regression equation.
Thus, 0 is the mean or expected value of sales for region A; 1 is the difference between
the mean number of units sold in region B and the mean number of units sold in region A;
and 2 is the difference between the mean number of units sold in region C and the mean
number of units sold in region A.
Two dummy variables were required because sales region is a categorical variable with
three levels. But the assignment of x1  0, x2  0 to indicate region A, x1  1, x2  0 to
indicate region B, and x1  0, x2  1 to indicate region C was arbitrary. For example, we could
have chosen x1  1, x2  0 to indicate region A, x1  0, x2  0 to indicate region B, and
x1  0, x2  1 to indicate region C. In that case, 1 would have been interpreted as the mean
difference between regionsAand B and 2 as the mean difference between regions C and B.
The important point to remember is that when a categorical variable has k levels, k  1
dummy variables are required in the multiple regression analysis. Thus, if the sales region
example had a fourth region, labeled D, three dummy variables would be necessary. For ex-
ample, the three dummy variables can be coded as follows.

Summary
In this chapter, we introduced multiple regression analysis as an extension of simple linear
regression analysis presented in Chapter 12. Multiple regression analysis enables us to 
understand how a dependent variable is related to two or more independent variables. The
mulitple regression equation E(y)  0  1x1  2x2  . . .  pxp shows that the mean
or expected value of the dependent variable y, denoted E( y), is related to the values of the

A 10-year study conducted by the American Heart Association provided data on how age,
blood pressure, and smoking relate to the risk of strokes. Assume that the following data
are from a portion of this study. Risk is interpreted as the probability (times 100) that the
patient will have a stroke over the next 10-year period. For the smoking variable, define a
dummy variable with 1 indicating a smoker and 0 indicating a nonsmoker.

develop the estimated multiple regression equation
 b0  b1x1  b2x2  . . .  bpxp. In
effect b0, b1, b2, . . . , bp are sample statistics used to estimate the unknown model parame-
ters 0, 1, 2, . . . , p. Computer printouts were used throughout the chapter to emphasize
the fact that statistical software packages are the only realistic means of performing the nu-
merous computations required in multiple regression analysis.
The multiple coefficient of determination was presented as a measure of the goodness of
fit of the estimated regression equation. It determines the proportion of the variation of y that
can be explained by the estimated regression equation. The adjusted multiple coefficient of de-
termination is a similar measure of goodness of fit that adjusts for the number of independent
variables and thus avoids overestimating the impact of adding more independent variables.
An F test and a t test were presented as ways to determine statistically whether the re-
lationship among the variables is significant. The F test is used to determine whether there
is a significant overall relationship between the dependent variable and the set of all inde-
pendent variables. The t test is used to determine whether there is a significant relationship
between the dependent variable and an individual independent variable given the other in-
dependent variables in the regression model. Correlation among the independent variables,
known as multicollinearity, was discussed.
The chapter concluded with a section on how dummy variables can be used to incor-
porate categorical independent variables into a regression model.
Glossary
Multiple regression analysisRegression analysis involving two or more independent variables.
Multiple regression model The mathematical equation that describes how the dependent
variable y is related to the independent variables x1, x2, . . . , xp and an error term .
Multiple regression equation The mathematical equation relating the expected value or
mean value of the dependent variable to the values of the independent variables; that is,
E( y)  0  1x1  2x2  . . .  pxp.
Estimated multiple regression equation The estimate of the multiple regression equation
based on sample data and the least squares method; it is  b0  b1x1  b2x2  . . .  bpxp.
Least squares method The method used to develop the estimated regression equation. It
minimizes the sum of squared residuals (the deviations between the observed values of the
dependent variable, yi, and the estimated values of the dependent variable, ).
Multiple coefficient of determination A measure of the goodness of fit of the estimated
multiple regression equation. It can be interpreted as the proportion of the variability in the
dependent variable that is explained by the estimated regression equation.
Adjusted multiple coefficient of determinationAmeasure of the goodness of fit of the es-
timated multiple regression equation that adjusts for the number of independent variables in
the model and thus avoids overestimating the impact of adding more independent variables.
MulticollinearityThe term used to describe the correlation among the independent variables.
Categorical independent variable An independent variable with categorical data.
Dummy variable A variable used to model the effect of categorical independent variables.
A dummy variable may take only the value zero or one.

The Tire Rack, America’s leading online distributor of tires and wheels, conducts exten-
sive testing to provide customers with products that are right for their vehicle, driving style,
and driving conditions. In addition, the Tire Rack maintains an independent consumer sur-
vey to help drivers help each other by sharing their long-term tire experiences. The fol-
lowing data show survey ratings (1 to 10 scale with 10 the highest rating) for 18 maximum
performance summer tires (Tire Rack website, February 3, 2009). The variable Steering
rates the tire’s steering responsiveness, Tread Wear rates quickness of wear based on the
driver’s expectations, and Buy Again rates the driver’s overall tire satisfaction and desire
to purchase the same tire again.

Case Problem 2 Alumni Giving
Alumni donations are an important source of revenue for colleges and universities. If admin-
istrators could determine the factors that could lead to increases in the percentage of alumni
who make a donation, they might be able to implement policies that could lead to increased
revenues. Research shows that students who are more satisfied with their contact with teach-
ers are more likely to graduate. As a result, one might suspect that smaller class sizes and lower
student-faculty ratios might lead to a higher percentage of satisfied graduates, which in turn
might lead to increases in the percentage of alumni who make a donation. Table 13.7 shows
data for 48 national universities (America’s Best Colleges, Year 2000 ed.). The column la-
beled Graduation Rate is the percentage of students who initially enrolled at the university
and graduated. The column labeled % of Classes Under 20 shows the percentage of classes
offered with fewer than 20 students. The column labeled Student-Faculty Ratio is the num-
ber of students enrolled divided by the total number of faculty. Finally, the column labeled
Alumni Giving Rate is the percentage of alumni who made a donation to the university.

Case Problem 3 PGA Tour Statistics
The Professional Golfers Association (PGA) maintains data on performance and earnings
for members of the PGA Tour. The top 125 players based on total earnings in PGA Tour
events are exempt for the following season. Making the top 125 money list is important be-
cause a player who is “exempt” has qualified to be a full-time member of the PGA tour for
the following season. 
Scoring average is generally considered the most important statistic in terms of success
on the PGA Tour. To investigate the effect that variables such as driving distance, driving
accuracy, greens in regulation, sand saves, and average putts per round have on average
score, year-end performance data for the 125 players who had the highest total earnings in
PGA Tour events for 2008 are contained in the file named PGATour (PGA Tour website,
2009). Each row of the data set corresponds to a PGA Tour player, and the data have been
sorted based upon total earnings. Descriptions for the variables in the data set follow. 
Money:
Total earnings in PGA Tour events.
Scoring Average:
The average number of strokes per completed round. 
DrDist (Driving Distance):
The average number of yards per measured drive. On the
PGA Tour driving distance is measured on two holes per round. Care is taken to select
two holes which face in opposite directions to counteract the effect of wind. Drives are
measured to the point at which they come to rest regardless of whether they are in the
fairway or not. 
DrAccu (Driving Accuracy):
The percentage of time a tee shot comes to rest in the
fairway (regardless of club). Driving accuracy is measured on every hole, excluding 
par 3s.
GIR (Greens in Regulation):
The percentage of time a player was able to hit the green
in regulation. A green is considered hit in regulation if any portion of the ball is touching
the putting surface after the GIR stroke has been taken. The GIR stroke is determined by
subtracting 2 from par (1st stroke on a par 3, 2nd on a par 4, 3rd on a par 5). In other
words, a green is considered hit in regulation if the player has reached the putting surface
in par minus two strokes.
Sand Saves:
The percentage of time a player was able to get “up and down” once in a
greenside sand bunker (regardless of score). “Up and down” indicates it took the player 2
shots or less to put the ball in the hole from a greenside sand bunker. 
PPR (Putts Per Round):
The average number of putts per round. 
Scrambling:
The percentage of time a player missed the green in regulation but still
made par or better. 
Managerial Report
1. To predict Scoring Average, develop estimated regression equations, first using DrDist
as the independent variable and then using DrAccu as the independent variable. Which
variable is the better predictor of Scoring Average? Discuss your findings.

would you use? Explain.

Case Problem 4 Predicting Winning Percentage for the NFL
The National Football League (NFL) records a variety of performance data for individuals
and teams. Some of the year-end performance data for the 2005 season are contained in the
file named NFLStats (NFL website). Each row of the data set corresponds to an NFL team,
and the teams are ranked by winning percentage. Descriptions for the data follow:
WinPct
Percentage of games won
TakeInt
Takeaway interceptions; the total number of interceptions made by the 
team’s defense
TakeFum
Takeaway fumbles; the total number of fumbles recovered by the team’s
defense

Appendix 13.1 Multiple Regression Using Minitab
In Section 13.2 we discussed the computer solution of multiple regression problems by
showing Minitab’s output for the Butler Trucking Company problem. In this appendix we
describe the steps required to generate the Minitab computer solution. First, the data must
be entered in a Minitab worksheet. The miles traveled are entered in column C1, the num-
ber of deliveries are entered in column C2, and the travel times (hours) are entered in col-
umn C3. The variable names Miles, Deliveries, and Time were entered as the column
headings on the worksheet. In subsequent steps, we refer to the data by using the variable
names Miles, Deliveries, and Time or the column indicators C1, C2, and C3. The following
steps describe how to use Minitab to produce the regression results shown in Figure 13.4.
Step 1. Select the Stat menu
Step 2. Select the Regression menu
Step 3. Choose Regression
Step 4. When the Regression dialog box appears:
Enter Time in the Response box
Enter Miles and Deliveries in the Predictors box
Click OK
Appendix 13.2 Multiple Regression Using Excel
In Section 13.2 we discussed the computer solution of multiple regression problems by
showing Minitab’s output for the Butler Trucking Company problem. In this appendix we
describe how to use Excel’s Regression tool to develop the estimated multiple regression
equation for the Butler Trucking problem. Refer to Figure 13.10 as we describe the tasks
involved. First, the labels Assignment, Miles, Deliveries, and Time are entered into cells
A1:D1 of the worksheet, and the sample data into cells B2:D11. The numbers 1–10 in cells
A2:A11 identify each observation.
The following steps describe how to use the Regression tool for the multiple regres-
sion analysis.
Step 1. Click the Data tab on the Ribbon
Step 2. In the Analysis group, click Data Analysis
Step 3. Choose Regression from the list of Analysis Tools

Note that using Excel’s Regression tool for multiple regression is almost the same as using
it for simple linear regression. The major difference is that in the multiple regression case
a larger range of cells is required in order to identify the independent variables.

With only five observations, it is difficult to determine
whether the assumptions are satisfied; however, the
plot does suggest curvature in the residuals, which
would indicate that the error term assumptions are not

Appendix E:
Using Excel Functions
Excel provides a wealth of functions for data management and statistical analysis. If we
know what function is needed, and how to use it, we can simply enter the function into
the appropriate worksheet cell. However, if we are not sure what functions are available
to accomplish a task or are not sure how to use a particular function, Excel can provide
assistance.
The functions used in this text are available to both Excel 2007 and Excel 2010 users,
and all the procedures described here for inserting functions are the same in both Excel
2007 and Excel 2010. In Excel 2010, some new functions have been added and some new
functions have replaced functions available in Excel 2007. However, all the Excel 2007
functions continue to be available to Excel 2010 users for compatibility purposes.
Finding the Right Excel Function
To identify the functions available in Excel, click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon. In the
Function Library group, click Insert Function. Alternatively, click the fx button on the for-
mula bar. Either approach provides the Insert Function dialog box shown in Figure E.1.
The Search for a function box at the top of the Insert Function dialog box enables us
to type a brief description of what we want to do. After doing so and clicking Go, Excel will

search for and display, in the Select a function box, the functions that may accomplish our
task. In many situations, however, we may want to browse through an entire category of
functions to see what is available. For this task, the Or select a category box is helpful. It
contains a drop-down list of several categories of functions provided by Excel. Figure E.1
shows that we selected the Statistical category. As a result, Excel’s statistical functions
appear in alphabetic order in the Select a function box. We see the AVEDEV function listed
first, followed by the AVERAGE function, and so on.
The AVEDEV function is highlighted in Figure E.1, indicating it is the function cur-
rently selected. The proper syntax for the function and a brief description of the function
appear below the Select a function box. We can scroll through the list in the Select a func-
tion box to display the syntax and a brief description for each of the statistical functions
available. For instance, scrolling down farther, we select the COUNTIF function, as shown
in Figure E.2. Note that COUNTIF is now highlighted, and that immediately below the Se-
lect a function box we see COUNTIF(range,criteria), which indicates that the COUNTIF
function contains two arguments, range and criteria. In addition, we see that the descrip-
tion of the COUNTIF function is “Counts the number of cells within a range that meet the
given condition.”
If the function selected (highlighted) is the one we want to use, we click OK; the Func-
tion Arguments dialog box then appears. The Function Arguments dialog box for the
COUNTIF function is shown in Figure E.3. This dialog box assists in creating the appro-
priate arguments for the function selected. When finished entering the arguments, we click
OK; Excel then inserts the function into a worksheet cell.

Inserting a Function into a Worksheet Cell
We will now show how to use the Insert Function and Function Arguments dialog boxes to
select a function, develop its arguments, and insert the function into a worksheet cell.
In Appendix 2.2, we used Excel’s COUNTIF function to construct a frequency distri-
bution for soft drink purchases. Figure E.4 displays an Excel worksheet containing the soft

drink data and labels for the frequency distribution we would like to construct. We see that
the frequency of Coke Classic purchases will go into cell D2, the frequency of Diet Coke
purchases will go into cell D3, and so on. Suppose we want to use the COUNTIF function
to compute the frequencies for these cells and would like some assistance from Excel.
Step 1. Select cell D2
Step 2. Click fx on the formula bar (or click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon and click
Insert Function in the Function Library group)
Step 3. When the Insert Function dialog box appears:
Select Statistical in the Or select a category box
Select COUNTIF in the Select a function box
Click OK
Step 4. When the Function Arguments box appears (see Figure E.5):
Enter $A$2:$A$51 in the Range box
Enter C2 in the Criteria box (At this point, the value of the function will ap-
pear on the next-to-last line of the dialog box. Its value is 19.)
Click OK
Step 5. Copy cell D2 to cells D3:D6
The worksheet then appears as in Figure E.6. The formula worksheet is in the back-
ground; the value worksheet appears in the foreground. The formula worksheet shows that
the COUNTIF function was inserted into cell D2. We copied the contents of cell D2 into
cells D3:D6. The value worksheet shows the proper class frequencies as computed.
We illustrated the use of Excel’s capability to provide assistance in using the COUNTIF
function. The procedure is similar for all Excel functions. This capability is especially helpful 
if you do not know what function to use or forget the proper name and/or syntax for a function.

Appendix F:
Computing p-Values Using
Minitab and Excel
Here we describe how Minitab and Excel can be used to compute p-values for the z, t, 2,
and F statistics that are used in hypothesis tests. As discussed in the text, only approximate
p-values for the t, 2, and F statistics can be obtained by using tables. This appendix is help-
ful to a person who has computed the test statistic by hand, or by other means, and wishes
to use computer software to compute the exact p-value. 
Using Minitab
Minitab can be used to provide the cumulative probability associated with the z, t, 2, and
F test statistics, so the lower tail p-value is obtained directly. The upper tail p-value is com-
puted by subtracting the lower tail p-value from 1. The two-tailed p-value is obtained by
doubling the smaller of the lower and upper tail p-values.
The z test statistic We use the Hilltop Coffee lower tail hypothesis test in Section 9.3 as
an illustration; the value of the test statistic is z  2.67. The Minitab steps used to com-
pute the cumulative probability corresponding to z  2.67 follow.
Step 1. Select the Calc menu
Step 2. Choose Probability Distributions
Step 3. Choose Normal
Step 4. When the Normal Distribution dialog box appears:
Select Cumulative probability
Enter 0 in the Mean box
Enter 1 in the Standard deviation box
Select Input Constant
Enter 2.67 in the Input Constant box
Click OK
Minitab provides the cumulative probability of .0038. This cumulative probability is the
lower tail p-value used for the Hilltop Coffee hypothesis test.
For an upper tail test, the p-value is computed from the cumulative probability provided
by Minitab as follows:
p-value  1  cumulative probability
For instance, the upper tail p-value corresponding to a test statistic of z  2.67 is 
1  .0038  .9962. The two-tailed p-value corresponding to a test statistic of z  2.67 is
two times the minimum of the upper and lower tail p-values; that is, the two-tailed p-value
corresponding to z  2.67 is 2(.0038)  .0076. 
The t test statistic We use the Heathrow Airport example from Section 9.4 as an illustra-
tion; the value of the test statistic is t  1.84 with 59 degrees of freedom. The Minitab steps
used to compute the cumulative probability corresponding to t  1.84 follow.

Appendix F
Computing p-Values Using Minitab and Excel
671
Step 1. Select the Calc menu
Step 2. Choose Probability Distributions
Step 3. Choose t
Step 4. When the t Distribution dialog box appears:
Select Cumulative probability
Enter 59 in the Degrees of freedom box
Select Input Constant
Enter 1.84 in the Input Constant box
Click OK
Minitab provides a cumulative probability of .9646, and hence the lower tail p-value 
.9646. The Heathrow Airport example is an upper tail test; the upper tail p-value is 1 
.9646  .0354. In the case of a two-tailed test, we would use the minimum of .9646 and
.0354 to compute p-value  2(.0354)  .0708. 
The 2 test statistic Suppose we are conducting an upper tail test and the value of the test
statistic is 2  28.18 with 23 degrees of freedom. The Minitab steps used to compute the
cumulative probability corresponding to 2  28.18 follow.
Step 1. Select the Calc menu
Step 2. Choose Probability Distributions
Step 3. Choose Chi-Square
Step 4. When the Chi-Square Distribution dialog box appears:
Select Cumulative probability
Enter 23 in the Degrees of freedom box
Select Input Constant
Enter 28.18 in the Input Constant box
Click OK
Minitab provides a cumulative probability of .7909, which is the lower tail p-value. The
upper tail p-value  1  the cumulative probability, or 1  .7909  .2091. The two-
tailed p-value is two times the minimum of the lower and upper tail p-values. Thus, the
two-tailed p-value is 2(.2091)  .4182. We are conducting an upper tail test, so we use
p-value  .2091.
The F test statistic Suppose we are conducting a two-tailed test and the test statistic
is F  2.40 with 25 numerator degrees of freedom and 15 denominator degrees of
freedom. The Minitab steps to compute the cumulative probability corresponding to 
F  2.40 follow.
Step 1. Select the Calc menu
Step 2. Choose Probability Distributions
Step 3. Choose F
Step 4. When the F Distribution dialog box appears:
Select Cumulative probability
Enter 25 in the Numerator degrees of freedom box
Enter 15 in the Denominator degrees of freedom box
Select Input Constant
Enter 2.40 in the Input Constant box
Click OK
Minitab provides the cumulative probability and hence a lower tail p-value  .9594. The
upper tail p-value is 1  .9594  .0406. Because we are conducting a two-tailed test, the
minimum of .9594 and .0406 is used to compute p-value  2(.0406)  .0812.

Appendix F
Computing p-Values Using Minitab and Excel
Using Excel
Excel functions and formulas can be used to compute p-values associated with the z, t, 2,
and F test statistics. We provide a template in the data file entitled p-Value for use in com-
puting these p-values. Using the template, it is only necessary to enter the value of the test
statistic and, if necessary, the appropriate degrees of freedom. Refer to Figure F.1 as we de-
scribe how the template is used. For users interested in the Excel functions and formulas
being used, just click on the appropriate cell in the template.
The z test statistic We use the Hilltop Coffee lower tail hypothesis test in Section 9.3 as
an illustration; the value of the test statistic is z  2.67. To use the p-value template for
this hypothesis test, simply enter 2.67 into cell B6 (see Figure F.1). After doing so,
p-values for all three types of hypothesis tests will appear. For Hilltop Coffee, we would
use the lower tail p-value  .0038 in cell B9. For an upper tail test, we would use the
p-value in cell B10, and for a two-tailed test we would use the p-value in cell B11.
The t test statistic We use the Heathrow Airport example from Section 9.4 as an illustra-
tion; the value of the test statistic is t  1.84 with 59 degrees of freedom. To use the 
p-value template for this hypothesis test, enter 1.84 into cell E6 and enter 59 into cell E7
(see Figure F.1). After doing so, p-values for all three types of hypothesis tests will appear.

The Heathrow Airport example involves an upper tail test, so we would use the upper
tail p-value  .0354 provided in cell E10 for the hypothesis test.
The 2 test statistic Suppose we are conducting an upper tail test and the value of the test
statistic is 2  28.18 with 23 degrees of freedom. To use the p-value template for this
hypothesis test, enter 28.18 into cell B18 and enter 23 into cell B19 (see Figure F.1). After
doing so, p-values for all three types of hypothesis tests will appear. We are conducting an
upper tail test, so we would use the upper tail p-value  .2091 provided in cell B23 for the
hypothesis test.
The F test statistic Suppose we are conducting a two-tailed test and the test statistic is 
F  2.40 with 25 numerator degrees of freedom and 15 denominator degrees of freedom.
To use the p-value template for this hypothesis test, enter 2.40 into cell E18, enter 25 into
cell E19, and enter 15 into cell E20 (see Figure F.1). After doing so, p-values for all three
types of hypothesis tests will appear. We are conducting a two-tailed test, so we would use
the two-tailed p-value  .0812 provided in cell E24 for the hypothesis test.
