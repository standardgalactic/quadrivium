Abstract
The
category-theoretic
notion
of
a
top
os
is
called
up
on
to
study
the
syn
tax
and
seman
tics
of
higher-order
logic.
Syn
tactical
systems
of
logic
are
replaced
b
y
top
oi,
and
mo
dels
b
y
functors
on
those
top
oi,
as
p
er
the
general
sc
heme
of
functorial
seman
tics.
Eac

es

to

[U

of

ob
jects.
The
c
hief
result
is
the
univ
ersal
c
haracterization
of
I
[U
T
]
as
a
so-called
classifying
top
os:
for
an
y
top
os
E
,
the
category
Log
(I
[U

];
E
)
of
logical
morphisms
I
[U
T
]
!
E
is
naturally
equiv
alen
t
to
the
category
Mo
d
T
(E
)
of
mo
dels
of
T
in
E
,
Log
(I
[U

E
)
'
Mo
d
T
(E
):
In
particular,
there
is
a
T
-mo
del
U
T
in
I
[U
T
]
suc
h
that
an
y
T
-mo
del
in
an
y
top
os
is
an
image
of
U
T
under
an
essen
tially
unique
logical
morphism.
In
this
sense,
I
[U
T
]
is
freely
generated
b
y
this
\univ
ersal"
mo
del
U
T
of
T
.
Ha
ving
cast
the
principal
logical
notions
in
familiar
algebraic
terms,
it
b
e-
comes
p
ossible
to
apply
standard
algebraic
and
functorial
tec
hniques
to
some
classical
logical
topics,
suc
h
as
in
terp
olation,
denabilit
y
,
and
completeness.
F
or
example,
a
w
ell-kno
wn
theorem
of
Grothendiec
k
states
that
ev
ery
comm
utativ
e
ring
is
isomorphic
to
the
ring
of
global
sections
of
a
sheaf
of
lo
cal
rings.
A
similar
sheaf
represen
tation
theorem
for
top

is
pro
v
ed
using
the
theory
of
stac
ks
and
indexed
categories.
Com-
bining
this
result
with
the
classifying
top

theorem,
one
can
infer
the
completeness
of
higher-order
logic
with
resp

to
certain
top

that
are

In
tro
duction
This
dissertation
in
v
estigates
what
ma
y
b
e
termed
the
mo
del
theory
of
higher-order
logic
using
the
metho
ds
of
category
theory
.
Of
course,
there
is
no
suc
h
eld
of
logic
as
\higher-order
mo
del
theory
,"
and
so
our
rst
concern
in
c
hapter
I
will
b
e
to
sp
ecify
the
basic
ob
jects
under
in
v
estigation,
viz.
higher-order
logical
theories
and
their
mo
dels.
This
is
a
fairly
straigh
tforw
ard
generalization|in
t
w
o
dieren
t
directions|of
the
familiar
corresp
onding
notions
for
rst-order
logic:
the
notion
of
a
logical
theory
is
generalized
from
rst-
to
higher-order
logic,
and
the
notion
of
a
mo
del
is
generalized
b
oth
from
rst-
to
higher-order
logic,
and
from
the
category
Sets
to
arbitrary
top
oi.

The
remaining
four
c
hapters
of
the
dissertation
are
then
dev
oted
to
what
ma
y
b
e
termed
`functorial
seman
tics
for
higher-order
logic,'
or
`top
os
seman
tics,'
b
y
whic
h
is
mean
t
the
study
of
suc
h
higher-order
logical
theories
and
their
mo
dels
b
y
functorial
metho
ds,
i.e.
emplo
ying
the
theory
of
categories
and
functors,
in
v
en
ted
b
y
S.
Eilen
b
erg
and
S.
Mac
Lane
(cf.
[
]),
and
in
particular
the
notion
of
an
elemen
tary
top
os,
in
v
en
ted
b
y
F.
W.
La
wv
ere
and
M.
Tierney
(cf.
[
],
[0]).
The
cen
tral
notion
of
top
os
seman
tics
is
that
of
a
classifying
top
os
for
a
logi-
cal
theory
.
Our
treatmen
t
of
classifying
top
oi
for
higher-order
logic
is
patterned
on
the
no
w
w
ell-dev
elop
ed
theory
of
classifying
top
oi
for
geometric
logic,
a
fragmen
t
of
rst-
order
logic
(cf.
[,
c
h.
X]).
In
the
geometric
case,
the
relev
an
t
top
oi
are
Grothendiec
k
top
oi
and
the
relev
an
t
morphisms
of
top
oi
are
geometric
morphisms
(cf.
[
,
c
h.
VI
I,
VI
I
I]).
Indeed,
the
theory
of
geometric
classifying
top
oi
is
as
m
uc
h
a
to
ol
for
studying
this
category
of
top
oi
as
for
studying
geometric
logic
(as
evidenced
b
y
[
]).
In
the

Higher-order
theories
and
some
of
their
connections
to
top
oi
ha
v
e
recen
tly
b
een
considered
b
y
sev
eral
authors,
in
particular
[,

,
,
].
Roughly
sp
eaking,
it
is
our
treatmen
t
of
mo
dels
of
suc
h
theories
that
is
new
(see
the
remarks
at
the
end
of
xI
I.
for
the
exact
relationship
b
et
w
een
this
and
previous
w
ork).
vii

case
of
higher-order
logic
under
consideration
here,
it
is
rather
elemen
tary
top
oi
and
logical
morphisms
that
are
most
relev
an
t.
This
is
b
ecause
the
logical
morphisms
of
top
oi
are
exactly
those
that
preserv
e
the
higher-order
logic
under
consideration
here,
while
the
notion
of
an
elemen
tary
top
os
is
broad
enough
to
include
the
classifying
top
oi
that
w
e
shall
construct,
in
addition
to
the
top
oi
lik
e
Sets
in
whic
h
mo
dels
are
usually
tak
en.
While
the
theory
of
geometric
classifying
top
oi
pro
vides
the
starting
p
oin
t
for
our
treatmen
t
of
top
os
seman
tics,
it
is
rather
another
theory
that
guides
the
further
dev
elopmen
t,
namely
the
classical
theory
of
p
olynomial
algebras
and
algebraic
extensions
of
rings
and
elds.
That
this
p
oin
t
of
view
is
useful
in
our
case
results
from
the
fact
that
the
category
at
issue
of
top
oi
and
logical
morphisms
shares
with
the
category
of
comm
utativ
e
rings
the
imp
ortan
t
prop
ert
y
of
b
eing
\algebraic,"
in
a
suitable
sense;
and
this
results
from
the
fact
that
the
notion
of
an
elemen
tary
top
os
is
itself
\algebraic,"
in
a
suitable
sense,

since
the
denition
is
giv
en
wholly
in
terms
of
adjoin
ts.
This
fact
w
as
emphasized
b
y
La
wv
ere
in
the
original
presen
tation
of
elemen
tary
top
oi
in
[
].
Generally
,
and
in
rough
terms,
our
goal
in
dev
eloping
the
theory
of
classifying
top
oi
for
higher-order
logic
is
to
tak
e
adv
an
tage
of
these
facts
to
replace
the
traditional
logical
notion
of
nitary
syn
tax
b
y
the
algebraic
notions
of
nite
generation
and
nite
presen
tabilit
y
.
The
theory
of
classifying
top
oi
for
higher-order
logic
is
b
y
no
means
fully
dev
elop
ed
in
this
dissertation;
n
umerous
directions
remain
to
b
e
in
v
estigated,
man
y
of
them
suggested
b
y
the
ground
co
v
ered
here.
It
is
hop
ed,
ho
w
ev
er,
that
enough
of
the
theory
has
b
een
carried
out
for
the
reader
to
recognize
its
outlines,
and
to
share
the
author's
opinion
that
it
is
a
course
w
orth
pursuing.
That
pursuit
is
not
just
an
exercise
in
conceptual
unication,
ho

er;
lik
e

of

The

relation
`
on

is
customarily
sp
ecied
in

a
deductiv

some

calculus,

The

to
include

that
e.g.

Of

there
are

satisfying
these

The

that

Th
us
e.g.
while

The

has
T

morphisms
in
E
as
morphisms,
and
the
eviden

domains,
co
domains,
iden
tities,
and
comp
osites.
Since
T
-mo
del
morphisms
are
plainly
in
v
ertible,
the
category
Mo
d
T
(E
)
is
a
gr
oup
oid,
i.e.
a
category
in
whic
h
ev
ery
morphism
is
an
isomorphism.
Of
course,
for
certain
familiar
theories
suc
h
as
groups
and
top
ological
spaces
there
is
already
a
familiar
notion
of
morphism,
e.g.
group
homomorphism

con

function,

our
denition
do
es

Indeed
it
is
not
alw
a
ys
clear

what

is.
The

of

just

w

for
our
purp
oses
while
b
eing
lib
eral
enough
to
encompass
the
isomorphisms
of
most
familiar
categories
(of
mo
dels).
F
or
example,
the
morphisms
of
groups
in
our
sense
are
just
the
group
isomorphisms,
and
the
morphisms
of
top

in

are
just

I
Classifying
T
op
oi
The
general
idea
of
classication
is
closely
related
to
the
distinctly
categorical
notions
of
univ
ersalit
y
and
adjoin
tness.
Lik
e
instances
of
those,
classifying
ob
jects
arise
nat-
urally
in
v
arious
branc
hes
of
Mathematics.
W
e
ha
v
e
in
mind
not
only
the
theory
of
classifying
spaces
for
cohomology
(from
whic
h
the
name
of
course
deriv
es),
but
also
the
classical
theory
of
p
olynomial
rings
and
eld
extensions.
Since
traditional
researc
h
in
logic
rarely
dra
ws
on
functorial
metho
ds,
the
imp
ortan
t
notions
of
univ
ersalit
y
and
adjoin
tness
are
generally
not
encoun
tered.
But
in
logic,
to
o,
the
ideas
of
classication
can
b
e
applied,
and
some
recen
t
w
ork
in
top
os
theory
and
categorical
logic
has
b
een
dev
oted
to
this.
A
theory
of
classifying
top
oi
whic
h
treats
rst-order
mo
del
theory
using
a
strongly
functorial
approac
h,
empha-
sizing
adjoin
tness
and
univ
ersalit
y
,
is
no
w
w
ell-dev
elop
ed
(cf.
[	,

,

]).
Muc
h
of
this
theory
pro
ceeds
along
the
lines
of
the
geometric
theory
of
classifying
spaces
(cf.
in
particular
[
]).
Another
trend
in
categorical
logic
(notably
[
,

])
uses
pretop
oi
and
related
categories
to
treat
rst-order
logic
along
more
algebraic
lines.
In
this
c
hapter
and
the
next,
w
e
shall
dev
elop
a
theory
of
classifying
top
oi
for
higher-order
logic.
Unlik
e
the
theory
of
classifying
top
oi
for
rst-order
logic,
it
is
the
algebraic
rather
than
the
geometric
paradigm
that
app
ears
to
b
e
the
more
suitable
classical
example
for
pro
viding
in
tuition
and
motiv
ation
(and
so
for
suggesting
terminology
and
notation).

The

The

In

the

It

W

indicating
the

of

to
previous
w

on

and
higher-order

in
particular
[,

In
eac

of
those
references,
top

are
also
constructed
\syn

from
systems
of
(higher-order)
logic
similar
to
our
logical
theories.
The
c

dierence

the
presen

is
our
consideration
of

of

(mo

not
considered
in

The
category
Mo
d
T
(E
)
of
mo

is
required
to
dene
the
notion
of
a
classifying
top
os,
and
to
giv
e
its
univ

mapping
prop
ert

.
This
prop
ert
y
completely
determines
the
(syn
tactically
constructed)
classifying
top
os
up
to
equiv
alence
of
categories;
the
syn

construction
itself
pla
ys
the
same
role
as
analogous
constructions
of
other
free
ob

viz.
establishing
existence.
By

the
most

to

There
it
is
sho

that

giv
es

a

from
whic
h
the
original
top

can
b

reconstructed
syn

,
up

of

(The

of

consider

rather

here.
F

their
category
of
top

is
a
simple
category
,
rather
than
a

as
is
required
for
the
purp

of

Morphisms
of
t
yp

are
dened
as
syn
tactical
translations,
determining
a
category
of
t

The
main

in

is
that
there
is
an

Syn
tactic
T
op
os
The
purp
ose
of
this
section
is
to
construct
the
free
top
os
I
[X
]
on
one
ob
ject.
As
a
classifying
top
os,
I
[X
]
classies
mo
dels
of
the
theory
X
ha
ving
a
single
basic
t
yp
e
sym
b
ol
and
no
basic
constan
t
sym
b
ols
or
axioms.
The
language
of
this
theory
is
th
us
just
the
language
L[X
]
of
section
I.,
whic
h
is
essen
tially
what
is
also
kno
wn
as
(simple)
t
yp
e
theory
or
(pure)
higher-order
logic.
The
category
I
[X
]
consists
of
p
olynomial-lik
e
ob
jects
and
morphisms
in
the
indeterminate
ob
ject
X
,
in
that
it
has
just
those
ob
jects
and
morphisms
whic
h
can
b
e
constructed
from
a
single
ob
ject
in
an
y
top
os
b
y
using
just
the
top
os
op
erations
of
nite
limits,
sub
ob
ject
classication,
and
p
o
w
er
ob
jects.
These
are
easily
sp
eci-
ed
b
y
certain
expressions
in
the
language
L[X
],
m
uc
h
as
the
elemen
ts
of
the
usual
p
olynomial
ring
Z[X
]
are
sp
ecied
as
w
ords
o
v
er
the
letter
X
and
the
ring
op
erations
;
+;
 ;
.
The
iden
tit
y
conditions
for
the
ob
jects
and
morphisms
of
I
[X
]
are,
ho
w
ev
er,
less
trivial
than
those
for
p
olynomials,
for
whic
h
a
simple
comparison
of
co
ecien
ts
suces.
Indeed,
the
iden
tit
y
relation
on
ob
jects
of
I
[X
]
is
undecidable
(as
is
that
on
morphisms),
for
the
problem
of
deciding
whether
t
w
o
suitable
expressions
determine
the
same
ob
ject
is
equiv
alen
t
to
deciding
whether
an
arbitrary
sen
tence
is
pro
v
able.
In
short,
the
w
ord
problem
for
top
oi
is
undecidable.
As
men
tioned
at
the
end
of
the
last
section,
this
kind
of
syn
tactical
con-
struction
of
top
oi
is
not
new;
suc
h
constructions
are
giv
en
e.g.
in
[,
,
,
].
In
[	]
and
elsewhere,
more
general
categories
(e.g.
pretop
oi)
are
constructed
syn
tactically
from
rst-order
theories
(cf.
also
[
,
c
hap.
X]).
Going
bac
k
a
bit
further,
a
similar
construction,
familiar
to
logicians,
is
that
of
the
Linden
baum-T
arski
algebra
of
form
u-
las
of
a
rst-order
theory
,
whic
h
is
ho
w
ev
er
a
b
o
olean
algebra
rather
than
a
category
.


Indeed
the

In

In

is
a

Of

there

Before

of
the
theory
X
with
a
single
basic
t
yp
e
sym

and
no
basic
constan

or

let
us
consider
what
these
mo
dels
are,
and
what
the
functor
Mo
d
X
( )
:
Log
!
Cat
is.
First,
a
mo
del
of
X
in
a
top
os
E
is
plainly
just
an
ob
ject
E
of
E
,
and
a
morphism
h
:
E

 !
E
0
of
mo
dels
in
E
is
just
an
isomorphism
in
E
.
The
theory
X
is
th
us
the
the
ory
of
obje
cts,
and
a
classifying
top
os
for
X
,
an
obje
ct
classier.
The
category
Mo
d
X
(E
)
has
the


same
ob
jects
as
E
and
the
isomorphisms
of
E
as
morphisms;
th
us
Mo
d
X
(E
)
is
the
underlying
gr
oup
oid
of
E
,
whic
h
w
e
shall
denote
E
i
,
Mo
d
X
(E
)
=
E
i
:
Therefore
Mo
d
X
( )
is
the
forgetful
functor
from
top
oi
to
group
oids.
The
top
os
I
[X

th
us
classies
ob

just
if
the
represen
table
functor
Log(I

 )
is
(naturally

that
forgetful

This
is
to
b

with
the
usual
p

ring
Z[X

whic
h
represen

the

to

As

an

is
plainly
a

for

with
a

Next,
w
e
wish
to
dene
the
notion
of
a
nitary
morphism
of
top
oi
and
sho
w
some
basic
prop
erties
of
these.
F
or
this
purp
ose,
some
preliminary
considerations
regarding
colimits
of
top
oi
are
required.
First,
it
is
w
ell
kno
wn
that
the
category
of
top
oi
and
logical
morphisms
is
complete
and
co
complete,
when
regarded
as
a
simple
category
rather
than
a
-category
(cf.
[]).
This
results
b
y
w
ell-kno
wn
means
from
the
fact
that
the
elemen
tary
theory
of
top
oi
is
essen
tially
algebraic
in
the
sense
of
F
reyd
[
],
whence
the
(usual)
category
of
mo
dels
thereof
is
algebraic
o
v
er
the
category
of
sets
(cf.
[]).
Moreo
v
er,
as
men
tioned
in
[],
this
completeness
carries
o
v
er|in
an
appropriate
sense|to
the
-category
Log
,
essen
tially
for
the
same
reason
but
b
y
the
more
in
v
olv
ed
metho
ds
of
what
ma
y
b
e
termed
-categorical
univ
ersal
algebra,
i.e.
the
-categorical
generalization
of
the
categorical
treatmen
t
of
univ
ersal
algebra
(as
in
[,
]).
Ho
w
ev
er,
the
construction
(and
ev
en
the
denitions)
of
the
v
arious
-
and
bicategorical
limits
and
colimits,
including
(indexed)
pseudolimits,
lax
limits,
and
bilimits,
is
a
rather
complicated
aair,
surely
b
est
conducted
in
a
setting
more
general
than
w
ould
b
e
appropriate
for
the
purp
oses
at
hand.
In
this
section
and
the
next,
w
e
shall
therefore
giv
e
the
notions
only
in
the
degree
of
generalit
y
subsequen
tly
required.
Moreo
v
er,
our
purp
ose
is
to
sho
w
ho
w
suc
h
limits
and
colimits
can
b
e
constructed
explicitly
using
the
metho
ds
at
hand,
rather
than
to
establish
their
existence,
whic
h
is
not
really
in
doubt.
While
our
in
ten
tion
is
th
us
not
to
conduct
a
systematic
study
of
the
completeness
and
co
completeness
of
Log
(w
orth
while
as
this
migh
t
b
e),
w
e
shall
nonetheless
pro
ceed
systematically
,
dening
the
(co)limits
at
issue,
using
only
those
already
constructed,
and
recording
our
results.

Pro

Since

as
just

it
suces
to
sho

that

just
if

a

The

as
something
more

called
a

used
to
transp

from
the

to
a

A
comparison
of
the

completes
the

Pro
of:
Let

regarded

W

that
the
canonical
functor
C

aC
to
the
asso

is
an
equiv
alence
of

First,

t
w

successiv

of
the
so-called

construction
(cf.

As

the
plus
construction

Sets

hence
also

Theorem

quivalent
to

Thus
any

is
e
quivalent
to
the
top

of

of
a
she
af
of

c
al

on
a

The
problem
with
theorem

is,
of
course,
that
w
e
ha
v
e
not
dened
the
notion
of
a
sheaf
of
h
yp
erlo
cal
top
oi
on
a
site.
On
a
top
ological
space,
this
ma
y
b
e
understo
o
d
in
the
usual
(in
sheaf
theory)
w
a
y:
ev
ery
stalk
of
the
sheaf
is
a
h
yp
erlo
cal
top
os
.
But
on
a
site
this
condition
is
generally
not
v
ery
informativ
e,
since
e.g.
there
ma
y
b
e
no
p
oin
ts
at
whic
h
to
tak
e
stalks.
A
satisfactory
alternativ
e
for
sites
w
ould
b
e
to
use
the
in
ternal
language
of
sheaf
top
oi
to
dene
a
h
yp
erlo
cal-top
os-ob
ject
in
a
top
os,
but
this
is
rather
in
v
olv
ed.
In
the
presen
t
case,
the
t
w
o
options
are
in
fact
equiv
alen
t,
as
shall
b
e
indicated.
F
or
our
purp
oses
w
e
will
therefore
simply
dene
a
sheaf
of
h
yp
erlo
cal
top
oi
on
a
site
to
b
e
a
sheaf
of
categories,
ev
ery
stalk
of
whic
h
is
a
h
yp
erlo
cal
top
os.
The
theorem
then
follo
ws
directly
from
the
preceding
lemma
and
prop
osition

of
the
previous
section,
since
for
the

Sh(E

w

'
E



E
,
where
y
is
the
sheaed

The
reason
wh
y
,
in
the
presen
t
case,
the
in
ternal
condition
on
shea
v
es
alluded
to
ab
o
v
e
is
equiv
alen
t
to
the
condition
giv
en
in
terms
of
stalks
is
that
the
top
os
Sh(E
)
of
shea
v
es
on
the
site
E
has
plen
t
y
of
p
oin
ts,
and
so
there
will
b
e
plen
t
y
of
stalks.
More
precisely
,
recall
that
a
Grothendiec
k
top
os
G
is
said
to
ha
v
e
enough
p
oints
if
the
collection
of
all
geometric
morphisms
a
:
Sets
!
G
is
join
tly
surjectiv
e
(cf.
e.g.
[,
IX.]).
If
G
has
enough
p
oin
ts,
then
an
y
geometric
prop
ert
y
of
mo
dels
of
a
geometric
theory
is
enjo
y
ed
b
y
a
mo
del
M
in
G
i
it
is
had
b
y
ev

stalk
of
M
,
since
the
in
v
erse
images
of
the
p
oin
ts
are
then
join
tly
faithful
(cf.
ibid.
X.).
Recall
that
as
a
site,
the
small
top
os
E
is
giv
en
the
top
ology
generated
b
y
nite
epimorphic
families;
the
Grothendiec
k
top
os
Sh
(E
)
is
th
us
coheren
t,
and
so
it
has
enough
p
oin
ts
b
y
Deligne's
theorem
(ibid.
IX.).
Theorem

could
therefore
b
e
made
considerably
more
informativ
e
b
y
adjusting
the
denition
of
a
sheaf
of

yp
erlo

top

to
include
the
condition
that
the
site
ha
v
e
a
top

with

A
virtue
of

the

is
that
it

Then

Since

Th

If

So
there
