Unit 4 – segment 1 

Following up on our example...Consider steam that enters a turbine at 69 bar,  
538 oC with a velocity of 64 m/s.  The turbine is operating at steady state conditions 
and the steam leaves the turbine as a dry saturated vapor at 10 bar.  The inlet 
diameter of the turbine is 0.45 m and the outlet diameter is 3.6 m.  
c) Sketch the process on a P-v diagram. 
Recall we used the online calculator (www.steamtablesonline.com) to find v1 and v2.    
(P1, T1) = (69 bar, 538 oC)  v1 = 0.0518 m3/kg 
(P2, x2) = (10 bar, x = 1)  v2 = 0.194 m3/kg 
 
   

Let’s talk about scaling now too.

How does exit velocity scale with the thermodynamic parameters? 
 
 
   


Let’s consider the flow work, or the work done by the fluid because the fluid is at a 
non-zero pressure. 

Two of the most common simplifications of the COE are to assume steady state 
conditions and that a device is adiabatic.  What specific mathematical effects do 
these assumptions have on the COE?

Can a system have unsteady mass flow and steady energy transfer? 
 
 
When can a system have only flow in with no flow out of the system? 
 
 

Unit 4 – segment 3 

Can a system have unsteady mass flow and steady energy transfer? 
No!  Never!  Just consider COM and COE.  All mass has energy associated with the 
mass.  So unsteady mass transfer must result in unsteady energy transfer and 
vice versa. 
 
When can a system have only flow in with no flow out of the system? 
This scenario is only possible if there is mass accumulation with the control 
volume, like when you inflate a balloon. 
 

Now let’s do some examples where we apply our tools. 
Water is compressed from an initial saturated vapor state at 200 kPa to a pressure 
of 1 MPa and a temperature of 250 oC.   The water is cooled during the process 
using convection with a specific heat transfer of 93 kJ/kg.  Does this process 
produce work or require work? And what is the specific work of the process? 
Sketch the process on a p-v diagram.

Do you have enough information to find the total work of the process?  If yes, find 
the total work.  If not, what additional information do you need?  
 
You do not have enough information to calculate total quantities.  You need to 
know the mass in the system.  If you had the volume of the chamber you could 
calculate the mass using the specific volume at the initial or final state. 

Now let’s go back to our turbine example we worked on earlier. 

How much of the power generated by the turbine is attributable to kinetic energy 
and how much is attributable to flow work + internal energy?   

How would heat losses affect the power generated by the turbine?   

Unit 4 – segment 5 

How would heat losses affect the power generated by the turbine? 
We can consider the answer to this question using the COE, where heat losses 
mean Q<0.   

Just a couple more examples.  Let’s consider a fan which has to cool a 
microprocessor in a desktop computer. If ambient air is used to cool the 
microchip and the heat dissipated by the CPU is 10 W, what is the temperature 
of the air out of the computer if the air speed is 0.9 m/s? 
Lots of good open ended material here. 
Step 1. Define the system. 
Step 2. Identify the proper forms for COM and COE 
Step 3. Find any missing state information. 
Step 4.  Find requested information.
