Music as a Mirror of History
Scope:
In Self-Reliance and Other Essays, the always quotable Ralph Waldo 
Emerson wrote: “The true poem is the poet’s mind; the true ship is the 
ship-builder. In the man we should see the reason for the last flourish and 
tendril of his work.” To this, we might add: The true musical composition 
is the composer. The creator and his or her creation are not divisible. A 
creation, whatever it might be, is to some unique degree, a reflection of 
its creator, who in turn is shaped by the time and place in which he or 
she lives. The individual composer, an individual composition, a particular 
time and place: Together, they constitute a symbiotic, indivisible trifecta. 
At the most general level, a composer’s environment shapes his musical 
style, meaning the generalized musical vocabulary and expressive 
parameters of his work. But sometimes, specific historical events shape 
the creation and content of a piece of music, and that’s what this survey 
is about: music written in direct response to contemporary historical 
events. As such, this will be a course about connections: the connections 
between composers and historical events—events that shaped the 
composers’ lives and inspired the creation of the works under study. 
For example, in one lecture, we will focus on the events surrounding the 
composition of a piano sonata entitled From the Street 1.X.1905 (“the 
first of October 1905”) by Leoš Janáček. Janáček was born and lived in 
Moravia, which is today the eastern region of the Czech Republic. He was 
a rabid Czech/Moravian nationalist, and his nationalism was intensified by 
occupation: At the time he grew up, all Czech lands, including Moravia, 
were controlled by a German-speaking ruling class. 
Janáček’s sonata was composed in response to an anti-German protest in 
Brno, the capital of Moravia. During the protest, German troops attacked 

Music as a Mirror of History
2
the unarmed protesters and killed a 20-year-old Moravian carpenter. In 
order to provide historical context for the protest that inspired Janáček’s 
sonata, our discussion will range all over the temporal map. It will start 
with the German dismantling of Czechoslovakia in 1938 and 1939, the 
brutality suffered by the Czechs during the Second World War, and the 
revenge exacted on the German-speaking Czech minority after the war. 
The lecture will then range backward to 1918 and 1919 to observe the 
creation of the sovereign state of Czechoslovakia from what had been 
the Austrian Empire. We’ll then go even further back, to the forcible 
“Germanization” of Czech lands in the 1620s and 1630s. Finally, we 
will move on to the Czech national revival of the 19th century, which so 
powerfully affected Janáček and his music.
We’ll take the same approach as we study the works of numerous 
other composers, including Handel, Mozart, Beethoven, Berlioz, Chopin, 
Verdi, Wagner, and many others. Instead of dissecting how classical 
masterpieces work as music per se, we’ll explore the ways in which 
history inspired the creation of certain musical works—and how those 
works interpreted and memorialized the history that inspired them. In this 
course, current events, culture, and art collide to provide a fascinating 
interdisciplinary look at a unique musical canon.

A
ny artistic creation—a poem, a painting, or a symphony—is a 
reflection of its creator, who in turn is shaped by the environment 
in which he or she lives. Of course, this environment includes 
contemporary historical events, which may influence or inspire the 
creation of art. In this course, we’ll specifically explore music written in 
response to historical events and the connections between composers 
and the events they experienced. In this lecture, we’ll begin with a 
madrigal written by Thomas Morley, “Hard by a Crystal Fountain.” Written 
during the waning days of Queen Elizabeth’s rule, the work conjures up 
an idealized world, one presented brilliantly and jubilantly. It is music of its 
time, describing a national self-perception.
Queen Elizabeth I—Oriana
●
●
To begin to see how a piece of music can encapsulate current events 
and capture the spirit of its time, let’s explore the life of Queen 
Elizabeth I, the fifth and last of the Tudor monarchs. Elizabeth was 
born on September 7, 1533, the daughter of King Henry VIII and Anne 
Boleyn. She was crowned queen in November 1558 at the age of 25, 
and she remained queen until her death on March 24, 1603, nearly 45 
years later.
●
●
Over the long run, Elizabeth’s reign brought about a degree of 
domestic stability not experienced since the early years of her 
father’s reign. She oversaw the creation of the Church of England 
and the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588. She raised England’s 
prestige on the continent and was the most popular English 
monarch before Victoria, who was to reign about 250 years later.

As Elizabeth aged, the myths about her coalesced. She was 
identified as the goddess Diana, the chaste huntress who was the 
guardian of the night. Elizabeth was also referred to as Cynthia, a 
nickname for the Greek goddess of the moon, Artemis. In addition, 
she was known as Oriana, meaning “golden one” in Italian and 
“sunrise” and “dawn” in Latin.
Morley’s “Hard by a Crystal 
Fountain” is music of its time, 
music that describes a national 
self-perception in the waning 
days of the reign of Elizabeth I.

Lecture 1—Music and History, Madrigals and Maps 
5
●
●
In 1597, one of Elizabeth’s courtiers, Nicholas Yonge, published an 
anthology of small choral works called madrigals. The last madrigal in 
the set—by a composer named Giovanni Croce—was entitled “Where 
between the Grass and the Flowers.” This particular madrigal was 
chosen to round off the set because it concluded with a salute to 
Queen Elizabeth: “Then sang the shepherds and nymphs of Diana: / 
Long live fair Oriana!”
●
●
That closing line was spotted by the well-known English composer 
and singer Thomas Morley. The queen had granted Morley a music 
publishing monopoly in 1598, and Morley, out of gratitude, decided to 
honor her by publishing a collection of 26 madrigals by 23 different 
composers, each of which would end with the same words as Croce’s 
madrigal. 
●
●
Two of the madrigals are by Morley himself, including “Hard by a 
Crystal Fountain.” Like all of the madrigals in the set, this one evokes a 
rapturous, verdant paradise presented as a metaphor for the heaven on 
earth that Queen Elizabeth had presumably created for her subjects.
●
●
We should note that London in the late 16th century was not a 
particularly heavenly place but, rather, a filthy city where more people 
died than were born. The madrigal, however, conjures up an idealized 
world, one presented brilliantly and jubilantly. It is not about urban 
truth but public perception, and after more than four decades of rule, 
the national self-perception was that Elizabeth had made England 
heaven on earth. 
●
●
It is said that “History is perceived memory,” which is perhaps another 
way of saying, “Let’s not let the facts get in the way of a good story.” 
Having said that, a culture’s self-perception, its national myth—
factually inaccurate though it may—is nevertheless as legitimate a 
part of a nation’s historical narrative as facts and figures. We will 
encounter other such national myth–defining music throughout this 
course.

Stories behind Maps
●
●
No matter how much we depend on maps, we must understand there 
is something random, even false about certain maps. In fact, our 
road maps, political maps, GPS readouts, and globes of the world—
crisscrossed by borders indicating countries, states, provinces, and 
counties—are man-made, artificial constructs. 
●
●
If the continents are construed as the product of plate tectonics, 
then our maps as construed are a product of human tectonics. And 
just as the continents drift, so, too, do the boundary lines on political 
maps. Unless they are defined by topographic features, such as rivers, 
mountains, or oceans, the boundary lines on maps often represent 
nothing more than geopolitical compromises that do not necessary 
reflect the reality on the ground. 
●
●
For example, if we look at a map of the Balkan Peninsula in 1900, we 
see the nation of Serbia straddling the crossroads between central and 
southern Europe. After centuries of exploitation and occupation by 
the Ottoman Turks, the emerging countries of the Balkan Peninsula—
with Serbia in the lead—were in the process of freeing themselves 
from the Ottoman Turks. 
●
●
With the successful conclusion of the Second Balkan War in 1913, 
Serbia almost doubled its territory and increased its population by 
some 50 percent. But for the statesmen and secret policemen who 
ran Serbia, this was not enough. They had come to the conclusion 
that it was Serbia’s destiny to create a Greater Serbia by uniting all 
the Serbian territories. 
●
●
The Serbian position was one of irredentism: a position that advocates 
annexing territories belonging to other states on the pretext of 
common ethnicity or prior historical possession, real or legendary. 
●
●
Serbian irredentism created the crisis that triggered World War I, 
which in turn triggered the Russian Revolution, the creation of 
Soviet communism and international communism, the rise of Italian 
and German fascism, World War II, and the Cold War. And as soon 
as the Soviet Union, the Eastern bloc, and the country of Yugoslavia 
disintegrated in the 1990s, the newly reestablished Balkan nation of 

Lecture 1—Music and History, Madrigals and Maps

Serbia was back at it, the lessons that led to the catastrophe of 
World War I still unlearned. 
Poland
●
●
Another example of the impermanence of maps is Poland. Today, it 
is an independent nation-state in central Europe with a population of 
some 38.5 million people. Modern Poland has a total area of 120,726 
square miles, making it the ninth largest country in Europe. On a 
map, we can see the neat, clean lines defining Poland’s completely 
indefensible borders.
●
●
In fact, Poland’s borders have changed so often over the last 450 
years that the Polish “nation” is as much a state of mind as it is a 
physical place. The Kingdom of Poland was founded in 1569, but it 
was eaten alive by its voracious neighbors: the Russian Empire to 
the east, Prussia to the west, and Austria to the south. Poland was 
“partitioned,” first in 1772, then again in 1793 and 1795. 
●
●
Napoleonic victories against Prussia led to the creation in 1807 of a 
small puppet state called the Duchy of Warsaw, which itself was 
broken up in 1815 when Napoleon was defeated. Another new Polish 
state was created, this one called Congress Poland (because it was 
created during the international summit called the Congress of Vienna). 
Congress Poland was, in fact, a puppet state of the Russian Empire 
and was slowly absorbed into the empire until it ceased to exist in 1867.
●
●
Though the tiny Polish Army had no chance against its Russian 
counterpart, a major uprising broke out in Warsaw in November of 
1830 and was not put down until September 8, 1831, when Warsaw 
was taken by Russia. A 21-year-old Warsaw native—a pianist and 
composer named Frédéric Chopin—was in Stuttgart on his way to 
Paris when he heard the news. He was inspired to write a piece of 
music about this historical event. That piece of music—now known as 
the Revolutionary Étude in C Minor, op. 10, no. 12—captures his rage 
and defiance.

Music as a Mirror of History

●
●
After nearly 150 years of partition and occupation, Poland reemerged 
as an independent nation in 1918, only to be invaded and partitioned 
once again in 1939 by Germany and the Soviet Union. At the conclusion 
of World War II, the Soviet Union annexed virtually all of eastern Poland; 
that Polish territory is, today, part of the nations of Lithuania, Belarus, 
Ukraine, and Russia. In return for the lands seized by the Soviets in 
1945, Poland was awarded a roughly equal size swath of territory on 
its western border. And that’s where the map of Poland remains today.
●
●
We must remain aware that maps can obscure as much they reveal. 
Patterns of settlement and tribal distributions of population do not 
The Kingdom of Poland, founded 
in 1569, was four times the size of 
modern Poland but was steadily 
taken over by its neighbors, 
leaving the smaller state of today.

usually jibe with the maps drawn by colonial powers or modern 
nation-states. Many if not most of the historical events we will study in 
this course will be the result of population movement, border conflict, 
and changing maps. 
Art and History
●
●
What inspires an artist? We might answer beauty, love, or faith. But 
these are not in themselves historical events. Thus, to a large degree, 
the historical events we will encounter in this course will be about 
changing maps—about conflict.
●
●
Conflicts—revolutions, 
riots, 
protests—create 
relatively 
sudden, 
disruptive change. At its most extreme, conflict means war, the most 
terrible folly in which our species can indulge. 
●
●
Wars are both the simplest and the most complex of human 
endeavors. They are simple because they manifest naked aggression 
on one hand and self-defense on the other, instincts coded into our 
DNA through billions of years of evolution as a result of our never-
ending competition for resources and optimum living environments. 
●
●
War is also the most massive and complex of all human activities, 
pitting the human, material, and technological wealth of entire nations 
against each other in scenarios so complicated and devastating as 
to render any other activity insignificant by comparison.
●
●
For better or worse, the magnified emotions stirred by conflict are 
like mother’s milk for artists, authors, and composers, whose creations 
feed off the energy in their environments. 
●
●
The war poetry of Wilfred Owen, Pablo Picasso’s Guernica, Henryk 
Górecki’s Symphony no. 3—these are but a few examples of great 
art rooted in the most terrible of human experiences, great art that 
transcends and informs and finds meaning in the terrible events that 
inspired it. The fact that we will find artistic beauty in the chaos of 
conflict should offer great solace for the darker historical events this 
course will cover.

Hard Choices
●
●
Hard choices had to be made when deciding what music and, 
therefore, which historical events were to be included in this survey. 
Having said that, there are two famous pieces of music whose absence 
from this survey we should address at the outset. 
●
●
The single most famous concert work that was explicitly inspired by a 
historical event is Peter Tchaikovsky’s 1812 Overture of 1880. However, 
Tchaikovsky’s 1812 Overture was composed 68 years after the events 
it describes. It is not an artistic reaction to current events but, rather, 
an exercise in nostalgia, a “grand commemorative festival piece” 
composed for use at celebrations. 
●
●
The other seemingly most topical piece excluded from this course 
is Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima for 52 strings, composed in 
1960 by the Polish-born composer Krzysztof Penderecki. It’s a dark, 
powerful, brutal work in which Penderecki uses all sorts of extended 
instrumental techniques to create a series of extraordinarily violent, 
shrieking, siren-like, and explosive masses of sound. 
●
●
Penderecki’s Threnody would seem to be as sincere an antiwar 
statement as any ever created; it has been compared to Picasso’s 
painting Guernica of 1937 and Benjamin Britten’s War Requiem 
of 1962. But in fact, the Threnody wasn’t conceived as an antiwar 
statement or memorial at all. Its original title was 8’37”. 
●
●
According to Penderecki, he decided to dedicate the piece to the 
victims of Hiroshima only after he heard it performed and was 
made viscerally aware of its devastating expressive punch. That 
explanation, however, is not entirely true. 
●
●
It seems that the Polish communist authorities were unhappy with 
the abstract title 8’37” and only when someone suggested calling 
the piece by the programmatic title Threnody to the Victims of 
Hiroshima—with its implied criticism of the West for using the 
bomb—did the piece find official favor.

Handel: Water Music (1714)
T
he life and career of George Frideric Handel—a German-born 
composer of Italian-language opera who went on to become 
England’s greatest composer—is an extraordinary mirror of the 
cosmopolitan nature and dynastic politics of 18th-century Europe. This is 
the story of two Germans named George, one of whom became England’s 
greatest musical son and the other, the king of England himself!
The Legend
●
●
George Frideric Handel was born in the city of Halle in the central 
German state of Saxony-Anhalt on February 23, 1685. Despite his 
prodigious musical gifts and his burning ambition to be a composer, 
Handel’s father insisted his son go to law school, which George did in 
1702, at the age of 17. Within a year, Handel abandoned the law for a 
career as a composer.
●
●
Handel’s first two operas—Almira and Nero—were written and 
produced in Hamburg in 1705, when he was just 20 years of age. 
From 1706 to 1710, he lived and worked in Italy, composing operas and 
sacred music. 
●
●
By 1710, the 25-year-old Handel had become a hot compositional 
commodity, and in June of that year, he was hired as Kapellmeister 
(“music director”) at the court of Prince Georg Ludwig, the elector of 
Hanover, in central-north Germany.
●
●
Two years later, in the autumn of 1712, Handel received permission 
from Prince Georg to visit London “on condition that he return within

a reasonable time.” But Handel remained in London for two years, and 
Prince Georg was not pleased.
●
●
On August 1, 1714, Queen Anne of England died and was succeeded 
by Prince Georg Ludwig, who was crowned King George I on October 
20, 1714. 
●
●
According to legend, the truant Handel plotted with his friend Baron 
Kielmansegge to obtain the king’s pardon. When the king and his 
court took an excursion by barge on the Thames, Kielmansegge 
chartered a second barge manned by musicians under Handel’s 
command. The music they played—a collection of dances now known 
as Water Music—so captivated George I that he pardoned Handel on 
the spot and restored him to favor. 
●
●
However, this legend of the Water Music is not entirely true. By the 
time the Water Music was performed that day on the Thames, King 
George had been in England for nearly three years. In that time, he 
had heard numerous performances of Handel’s music. By 1717, the king 
had reinstated Handel’s Hanover salary, which had been cut off in 1713. 
●
●
The real story here is not when Handel was “forgiven” but, rather, how 
these two Germans—Georg Ludwig and George Handel—became two 
of the most important Englishmen who ever lived. Handel remains the 
most famous and beloved “English” composer in history, while Georg 
Ludwig, as King George I, founded a royal dynasty that lives on today 
in the reign of Queen Elizabeth II. 
Dynastic Issues 
●
●
Just how did Georg Ludwig, prince of the duchy and electorate of 
Brunswick-Lüneburg (also known as Hanover) became the king of 
England? 
●
●
Henry VIII became king in 1509 at the age of 17 and reigned for 
37 years, until his death at age 55 on January 28, 1547. Henry was

survived by three legitimate children: Mary, the Catholic daughter of 
his first wife; Elizabeth, the Protestant daughter of his second wife; 
and Edward, the Protestant son of his third wife. 
●
●
When Henry died, the 9-year-old Edward was crowned king. During 
his brief reign, Protestantism became the religious law of the land. But 
13 days after his death at the age of 15, his eldest sister—the Catholic 
Mary—seized the crown. She attempted to restore Catholicism in 
England but died five years into her reign, leaving undone her great 
work of Catholic restoration. Her 25-year-old half-sister, Elizabeth, was 
crowned queen in 1558.
●
●
Elizabeth I ruled for nearly 45 years, until her death in 1603. There 
were various challenges to her during her reign, none more serious 
than a confrontation with another Catholic queen named Mary: Mary I 
of Scotland, or Mary, Queen of Scots.
●
●
This Mary also laid claim to the English throne as the only surviving 
legitimate child of King James V of Scotland. Mary was a devout 
Catholic and was perceived by many English Catholics to be the 
rightful queen of England. When domestic problems in Scotland 
forced Mary to abdicate and flee, she sought protection from 
Elizabeth I. In this, Mary chose poorly. Rightly perceiving Mary as a 
threat, Queen Elizabeth kept her under house arrest for more than 18 
years before decapitating her.
●
●
Before her death, however, Mary birthed a son by her second husband. 
The child was a boy named James, born in 1566. When Mary was 
forced to flee Scotland just one year later, James was declared King 
James VI of Scotland. 
●
●
The year 1603 was a signal one in British history. Queen Elizabeth I 
died on March 24 without ever having produced an heir. Her closest 
living relative was the now 37-year-old King James VI of Scotland. He 
was crowned James I of England and Ireland, uniting the sovereign 
states of England and Scotland and paving the way—eventually—for 

Music as a Mirror of History
14
the Act of Union in 1707, which created the United Kingdom of Great 
Britain. 
●
●
James was succeeded by his son, Charles I, in 1625. But Charles 
was executed for high treason in 1649. A chastened monarchy was 
restored in 1660, when Charles I’s son, Charles II, became king of 
England, Ireland, and Scotland. 
●
●
Charles II was succeeded by his brother James in 1688. But James 
was a pro-French closet Catholic enamored of the same sort of 
absolutism that had cost Charles I his head. Calls went out to Willem 
III—the Protestant prince of Orange of the Dutch Republic—to 
intervene, and Willem complied. King James II absconded to France, 
and Willem of Orange became King William III of England and Ireland 
and William II of Scotland. 
●
●
Unfortunately, William and his wife, Mary, produced no heir. Thus, he 
was succeeded by his cousin and sister-in–law, Anne, who also failed 
to produce a surviving heir. At this point, the English Parliament 
stepped in. 
●
●
By 1701, the Protestants who governed England had had their fill 
of Catholic successors. Thus, in 1701, Parliament passed the Act of 
Settlement, which was designed to guarantee Protestant succession 
by disqualifying Roman Catholics from occupying the English 
throne. Parliament designated the Protestant Sophia of Hanover—
the granddaughter of James I—as heiress presumptive of the British 
crown: the next queen of England. 
●
●
But Sophia never got to be queen. She died at the age of 83, just 
53 days before Queen Anne. Instead, her eldest son, Georg Ludwig, 
ascended the English throne, becoming the first English king of the 
house of Hanover at the age of 54. 

Lecture 2—Handel: Water Music (1714) 
15
As Queen Anne’s closest living 
Protestant relative, Georg 
Ludwig became King George I 
of England, despite the fact that 
more than 50 Roman Catholics 
were more closely related by 
blood to the queen than he was.

Royal Musicians
●
●
Almost all these royals employed musicians as part of their 
households, who provided suitably royal and martial music at public 
and private gatherings. Lesser nobles across Europe also employed 
musicians, particularly during the 17th and 18th centuries, when house 
orchestras were considered to be the ultimate in sophistication. 
Among such lesser nobles were the German princes tasked with 
periodically “electing” the Holy Roman Emperor. 
●
●
As of 1701, there were eight such electors, including the elector of 
Hanover, Georg Ludwig. In 1701, his mother, Sophia, had been designated 
by the Act of Settlement to be heir to the English throne, which meant 
that sooner or later, Georg Ludwig would be king of England.
●
●
The electoral court at Hanover was quite sophisticated. In 1688, 
Georg Ludwig’s father, the elector Ernst Augustus, built a 1,300-
seat opera house in Hanover that was considered to be the most 
beautiful and technologically advanced opera house in all of 
Germany. Ernst died in 1698, but it was for his opera house that 
Georg Ludwig hired Handel.
●
●
Handel was appointed Kapellmeister to the electoral court in Hanover 
on June 16, 1710. The good folks in Hanover were thrilled to have 
him, but they didn’t get to keep him for long. Handel left Hanover 
for a leave of absence just a few weeks after signing his contract. He 
returned briefly in 1711, only to request another leave of absence. It 
was grudgingly granted, though this time, Handel was informed that 
he was expected to return “within a reasonable time.” Handel never 
set foot in Hanover again.
Handel in London
●
●
Handel first arrived in London in either November or December of 1710, 
at a time when Italian opera was gaining popularity. Almost immediately 
upon his arrival, melodies from Handel’s opera Agrippina were outfitted 
with new words and inserted into other operas then being performed in 

Lecture 2—Handel: Water Music (1714) 
17
Such was his popularity 
among Italian audiences 
that Handel became known 
as Il Caro Sassone—“the 
dear Saxon.” 

Music as a Mirror of History
18
London. Virtually overnight, Handel’s was established as a musical force 
to be reckoned with in the English capital. 
●
●
Because of his connection to the soon-to-be-English-royals in 
Hanover, Handel was granted an audience with Queen Anne. His 
writing, particularly for the trumpet, was an immediate success. 
Brass instruments in general and the trumpet in particular had long 
been associated with royalty. The orchestral music Handel wrote for 
the English royalty is particularly notable for its brass writing and 
remarkable for its trumpet writing. One example is the “Alla Hornpipe” 
from the Water Music. 
●
●
Handel’s presence in London put English music on the map. It’s 
true that he profited tremendously from the contemporary English 
willingness to adopt things German. But Handel’s success in London 
must be credited to Handel himself. He was remarkably clever about 
ingratiating himself with the English public by composing both Italian-
language opera for the nobility and English-language sacred works 
for the public and the royal family. 
●
●
The first such English-language work was Handel’s Ode for the 
Birthday of Queen Anne, which was performed at court on February 
6, 1713. Five weeks later—on March 19, 1713—Handel’s Te Deum and 
Jubilate in celebration of the Treaty of Utrecht (which brought an end 
to the War of Spanish Succession) was publicly rehearsed in Whitehall 
before its “official” premiere at St. Paul’s Cathedral. 
●
●
Handel’s Te Deum was the most important piece of religious music 
composed in England since the death of the great Henry Purcell 18 
years before. 
●
●
Handel went out of his way to study the music of Purcell and 
cultivated a musical style custom-made for English tastes: a style 
that featured the compact melodic phrase structures of English 
songs and religious hymns; was light on melodic embellishment 
but heavy on complex polyphony; and was more magnificent 
than intimate. The “Bourrée” from the Water Music encompasses 
this style.

Lecture 2—Handel: Water Music (1714) 
19
●
●
As a composer and producer of Italian-language operas, Handel made 
London the most important opera center outside of Italy in the early 
1700s. And when the popularity of Italian-language opera dried up 
in the 1740s, Handel created an entirely new industry by composing 
and producing English-language oratorios for his increasingly middle-
class audiences. 
●
●
But even as he got rich composing operas and oratorios, Handel’s life 
and career continued to be closely tied to the British royal family. The 
Water Music was composed for George I in 1717 for a royal procession 
up the Thames. When George II succeeded his father in 1727, Handel 
composed four so-called anthems for orchestra and chorus that were 
performed during the coronation ceremony. Without doubt, Handel 
was the composer of choice when the English establishment required 
grand music for special occasions.
Georg and George
●
●
Despite their differences in background and social class, Georg 
Ludwig of Hanover and George Handel of Halle had much more in 
common than not. They were both ambitious and hard-working men 
whose fates were intertwined to an astonish degree. 
●
●
Through the most extraordinary of circumstances, Georg Ludwig—a 
mid-level German prince only distantly related to the English royal 
family—became the king of England. Following on the heels of a 
period of dangerous dynastic instability, Georg created a dynasty that 
lasted nearly 200 years. To his credit, George I was able to transition 
from German absolutism to the mixed parliamentary government of 
the English system. 
●
●
As for Handel: without the caché of being Kapellmeister to Georg 
Ludwig, Handel would never have conquered the English as quickly 
as he did. And without the patronage of the Hanover kings—George 

Music as a Mirror of History
20
I and George II—Handel would never have written much of the music 
for which he is best known today. That music—an amalgam of German 
technique and Italian lyricism—not only came to mirror the Hanoverian 
dynasty but continues to define British sensibility and national self-
identity to this day.

Mozart: The Abduction from the Harem 
(1782)
O
n July 16, 1782, Wolfgang Mozart’s opera The Abduction from the 
Seraglio (“harem”) premiered in Vienna. The Abduction was, in 
Mozart’s lifetime, his most popular opera, owing to a number of 
factors: It is set in colloquial German (as opposed to Italian), which made 
it accessible to audiences across Austria and Germany. It is also based 
on the sort of “escape story” that was popular at the time. Much of the 
action takes place in a harem, increasing its titillation value. It is filled with 
colorful musical exotica that contemporaries would have identified as 
being “Turkish.” Finally, the opera deals with current events of the late 18th 
century: the clash between Christianity and Islam.
The Abduction
●
●
At the time Mozart composed The Abduction from the Harem, the 
so-called Turkish Wars—pitting the Islamic Ottoman Empire against 
Christian Europe—had been going on for 400 years. And, as is so often 
the case, stereotypically negative depictions of an enemy helped to 
turn fear into ridicule and ridicule into humor. Mozart’s Abduction is 
no exception.
●
●
The villain of the opera is an Ottoman named Osmin. He is the overseer 
of a palace in which a number of Westerners—captured by pirates—
have been installed as slaves. Osmin is fat, oily, and considerably 
older than the attractive young Christians being held as slaves; he 
wears a greasy tunic, puffy harem pants, and a turban and sports a 
large, curved knife tucked into his sash-like belt. He is both cruel and 
paranoid. Osmin’s boss—the pasha Selim—has given him a young,

beautiful, blond, English woman named Blondchen, who Osmin keeps 
under lock and key. 
●
●
When we meet Osmin early in Act I, his paranoid fear that another man 
is going to steal his Blondchen is about to burst. He gives a vicious (and 
comic) description of precisely what he intends to do to any man he 
catches near his Blondchen, including beheading, hanging, and more. 
This is the story, the history, behind this lecture: the centuries-long 
threat posed to Europe by the Ottoman Turkish Empire.
The Ottoman Empire
●
●
The Ottoman or Turkish Empire was a Sunni Islamic state that posed a 
direct threat to central and southern Europe for 600 years. This threat—
and the cultural collision between Eastern Islam and Western Christianity 
that it manifested and the love-hate relationship between East and West 
it generated—shaped European thinking, foreign policy and diplomacy, 
art, architecture, design, food, and music for hundreds of years. 
●
●
The smallish principality that eventually morphed into the Ottoman or 
Turkish Empire was founded by an Anatolian sultan named Osman in 
1299. 
●
●
At the time Osman declared his sultanate, Anatolia—which comprises 
most of modern Turkey—was a patchwork of independent states, 
only one of which was ruled by Osman. But Osman was a savvy 
geopolitico who recognized a growing power vacuum and decided 
to take advantage of it. 
●
●
To the west, the weakening Christian Byzantine Empire based in 
Constantinople was losing its influence in Anatolia. To the east, 
Mongol invaders were driving large numbers of Muslim refugees 
into Anatolia, many of whom were absorbed into Osman’s growing 
sultanate. 
●
●
Osman’s forces began absorbing neighboring states, eventually 
extending his control to the frontiers of the Byzantine Empire. The 
Ottomans’ stunning success had much to do with their use of a legal 
23

Music as a Mirror of History
24
entity called the millet system, which allowed the various religious 
and ethnic minorities under the empire’s control to maintain their own 
courts and, within limits, to govern themselves. This system of Islamic 
law was an example of religious and ethnic pluralism.
●
●
The Ottoman Empire eventually occupied all or part of 43 modern 
nations. Obviously, an empire of this size was not created overnight. 
Constantinople—and with it, the Byzantine Empire—fell to the 
Ottomans in 1453. In 1521, Belgrade—the capital of Serbia—was taken 
by the longest reigning and most feared of all the Ottoman sultans, 
Suleiman the Magnificent. In 1526, Suleiman’s armies defeated the 
Hungarian army at the Battle of Mohacs, during which the Hungarian 
king himself was killed. Transylvania and much of Hungary were 
occupied, and the road to Vienna lay wide open.
●
●
In September of 1529, Suleiman laid siege to Vienna. Although the 
Turks outnumbered the defenders some seven to one, Vienna held. 
Meanwhile, autumn rains brought misery and disease to the ill-clothed 
Ottoman army. Badly overextended, the Turks suffered from a critical 
shortage of food and water. The siege was lifted after just three weeks, 
and Suleiman retreated back to Hungary. 
●
●
Three years later, in 1532, Suleiman tried again. This time, he advanced 
no farther than Güns, a fortress on the Hungarian-Austrian border 
about 30 miles southeast of Vienna. There, between 700 and 800 
Croatian soldiers held off an Ottoman army of roughly 150,000 long 
enough for the autumn rains to arrive and the Ottomans to withdraw.
●
●
In July of 1683, a Turkish army again laid siege to Vienna. That siege 
was broken when an allied army led by Jan Sobieski, the king of 
Poland, destroyed the besiegers at the Battle of Vienna on September 
11 and 12, 1683. Ottoman expansion into Europe was thrown into 
reverse, and the ensuing war—which lasted until 1698—saw the 
European allies liberate almost all of Hungary. 

Lecture 3—Mozart: The Abduction from the Harem (1782) 
Turkish Style in Music
●
●
Various sources claim that the rout at the Battle of Vienna was such 
that the Ottoman military bandsmen dropped their instruments on 
the spot and fled, which is how Western Europe acquired cymbals 
and kettledrums. 
●
●
The truth, of course, is that Western Europeans had access to 
cymbals and kettledrums for centuries before 1683. However, cymbals 
were indeed associated with the Ottoman military, in particular, the 
Janissaries: the famously ferocious infantry units that had once made 
up the sultan’s bodyguard. Whenever a Western composer wanted to 
evoke the jingling/jangling of Ottoman military bands and marching 
troops, he would use cymbals, triangles, bells, and kettledrums to 
evoke what was instantly recognizable as the “Turkish style.”
●
●
For example, in 1701, the Austrian composer Johann Joseph Fux 
published a partita—a collection of dances—entitled Turcaria, which 
loosely translates as “Turkish stuff.” The work bears the subtitle “Musical 
portrait of the siege of Vienna by the Turks in 1683.” In those sections of 
music meant to evoke the Ottomans, Fux uses cymbals and kettledrums. 
●
●
Beethoven also wrote a famous work in the Turkish style: the “Turkish 
March” from The Ruins of Athens, op. 113 of 1811. Typical of Turkish-
style music for the piano, the clang and ring of cymbals is evoked by 
grace notes.
Background on Mozart
●
●
Wolfgang Mozart was born on January 27, 1756, in what today is the 
Austrian city of Salzburg. He grew up with the uneasy awareness that 
the Ottoman Turks were never far away. 
●
●
Fresh from his success with his opera Idomeneo, Mozart settled 
permanently in Vienna in 1781, at the age of 25. At the time, Emperor 
Joseph II had been planning the creation of an imperial German-
language opera theater that would be the equal to the long-established 
25

Music as a Mirror of History
26
imperial Italian opera theater. Based on the success of Idomeneo, 
Count Franz Xaver Orsini-Rosenberg—the director of the German 
opera theater—approached Mozart with a commission for a German-
language opera. 
●
●
In July of 1781—just a few weeks after setting up shop in Vienna—
Mozart received a libretto from Count Rosenberg entitled Die 
Entführung aus dem Serail: “The Abduction from the Harem.” The 
libretto, originally written by Christoph Friedrich Bretzner, was 
adapted for Mozart by the German-born, Vienna-based playwright 
Gottlieb Stephanie. On August 1, 1781, Mozart wrote to his father that 
he would write “the overture, the chorus in Act I and the final chorus 
in the Turkish style.”
●
●
For Mozart and his Viennese contemporaries, the Turkish musical style 
consisted of moderate-to-fast march music based on the military 
music of a Janissary band, an ensemble called a mehter: music that 
featured booming kettledrum accents on every downbeat, cymbals, 
triangles, grace notes, and repetitive rhythmic patterns. Mozart’s 
overture to The Abduction from the Harem is filled with Turkish-style 
mannerisms, including a triangle heard in high relief.
Pasha Selim: The Noble Turk?
●
●
Earlier in this lecture, we talked about the evil overseer Osmin, an 
insultingly stereotypical Turk whose paranoia and moral degeneracy 
drive much of the opera. Another important Turkish character in the 
opera is the pasha Selim.
●
●
The pasha is a very wealthy man: It is in his seaside villa that the action 
of the opera takes place. In fact, Pasha Selim initiated the action of the 
opera when he bought three Europeans from pirates: Constanze, a 
wealthy Spanish woman; her English maid, Blondchen; and Pedrillo, 
the valet of Constanze’s fiancé. That fiancé—named Belmonte—has 
traced the kidnapped trio to Pasha Selim’s pleasure palace and is 
determined to rescue them. 

●
●
Just as Osmin, the evil overseer, has fallen in love with Blondchen, 
so Pasha Selim has fallen for Constanze. But where Osmin threatens 
and manhandles Blondchen, Selim treats Constanze with respect and 
accepts her rejection of his advances with equanimity. In the end—
to Osmin’s horror—Pasha Selim sets the captives free. Because of 
his civility and benevolence, Pasha Selim is often referred to in the 
literature as “the image of the noble Turk.” The opera concludes with 
a ringing Turkish-style chorus of Janissaries that celebrates the good 
pasha’s munificence! 
●
●
However, we discover—during the Act III denouement—that Pasha 
Selim is not a Turk at all! Rather, he is a Christian nobleman who, for 
reasons never explained, was robbed of his beloved, deprived of his 
position and property, and forced to flee to the East, where he has 
clearly done quite well. In the end, the point is that Pasha Selim is 
civilized and benevolent because he is not a Turk but a European 
Christian.
Mozart’s Death
●
●
The ongoing conflict between the Austrian Empire and the Ottoman 
Empire had a direct impact on Mozart’s finances, which had a direct 
impact on his declining mental and physical health and contributed to 
his death in December 1791.
●
●
In 1781, the newly elevated emperor of Austria, Joseph II, signed an 
alliance with Catherine the Great of Russia. Catherine—who had long 
coveted Constantinople—provoked the Ottomans into declaring war 
on Russia in 1787. Austria honored its alliance with Russia by deploying 
more the 280,000 troops on the borders of the Turkish Empire. The 
war was a military and economic disaster for Austria, and whatever 
territorial gains it achieved were returned to Turkey at the conclusion 
of the war in 1791. 
●
●
Back home in Vienna, there was near universal opposition to the 
war, partially because of exorbitantly high “war taxes.” Food prices

28
doubled, and for the first time in Vienna’s history, bakeries were looted. 
In Vienna, the aristocracy cut back on expenditures or left town. The 
theaters were closed. Concerts and music lessons were cancelled. 
●
●
Wolfgang Mozart, his finances already in disarray, saw much of what 
remained of his income dry up. He died on December 5, 1791: four 
months and a day after Austria withdrew from the war and made 
peace with the Ottomans. 
Fates of the Austrian and Ottoman Empires
●
●
The 19th century was not kind to either the Austrian or Turkish empires. 
They both suffered from bloated bureaucracies, waning influence, 
stagnant economies, and increasingly elderly leadership. 
●
●
The Austrian Empire began the 19th century with a series of 
devastating defeats at the hands of Napoleon; by the end of the 
century, it was but a shadow of its former self. 
●
●
The Ottoman Empire simply unraveled: Revolutions in Serbia, 
Greece, Wallachia, Moldavia, and Montenegro caused the empire to 
be called “the sick man of Europe” by the mid-19th century. It never 
got well.
●
●
It is no small irony, then, that after centuries of war and animosity, 
these two sickly empires were allied in World War I on the losing side, 
and their defeat spelled their end. It is ironic that two great imperial 
powers, sworn enemies for 600 years, should go down in defeat and 
into oblivion as allies.

Haydn: Mass in the Time of War (1797)
J
oseph Haydn was born on March 31, 1732, in the Austrian village of 
Rohrau, which was then on the border with Hungary. He was raised 
Catholic and never lapsed. According to his biographer, Georg August 
Griesinger, Haydn was “strongly convinced in all his heart that all human 
destiny is under God’s guiding hand, that God rewards good and evil, 
[and] that all talents come from above.” Across the span of his career, 
Haydn composed 14 settings of the Mass, including Mass in the Time 
of War. In this lecture, we’ll see how events that began in revolutionary 
Paris came to inspire the expressive content of a Mass composed to 
commemorate the name-day of a Hungarian princess.
The Musical Mass 
●
●
The Mass is the principal daily service of the Catholic liturgy. 
Depending on how you count them, the daily Mass consists of 
anywhere between 17 to 20 sections. 
●
●
Some of these sections are repeated every day. These repeated 
sections together comprise what’s called the Ordinary of the Mass. 
●
●
The Ordinary consists of six sections of text: the Kyrie (“Lord have 
mercy upon us; Christ have mercy upon us”), Gloria (“Glory be to 
God”), Credo (“I believe”), Sanctus (“Holy, holy, holy”), Agnus Dei 
(“Lamb of God”), and Ite missa est (“Let us bless the Lord and be 
dismissed”). 
●
●
The other sections of the Mass, those that change from day to day, 
are called the Proper because they are “proper” to particular days in 
the liturgical calendar.

The Credo in Mass in the Time of War
●
●
Haydn was a devout Catholic, he loved and believed the words of the 
Mass, and he lavished extraordinarily original music on each of his 14 
Masses, the composition of which was, for Haydn, an act of faith.
The fact that Joseph Haydn 
composed 14 settings of the 
Mass might lead us to believe 
that he repeated himself, but 
Haydn wrote unique music 
for each of his Masses.

Lecture 4—Haydn: Mass in the Time of War (1797) 
●
●
The exuberance of Haydn’s faith is beautifully demonstrated in the 
Credo section of his Mass in the Time of War. The Credo is the central 
part of the five-part Ordinary of the Mass. It is the itemized statement 
of belief made by the faithful. In terms of word count, the Credo is 
longer than the other four sections of the Ordinary put together. In 
order to get through all those words with some degree of dispatch, 
musical Credos are usually set syllabically—meaning one note per 
syllable—and with an absolute minimum of repetition and voice 
overlapping. 
●
●
In this Mass, however, the opening of Haydn’s Credo features 
polyphonic overlapping of all sorts, as vocal soloists and chorus—
collectively, the voices of all humanity—celebrate their shared and 
unshakeable faith in the Catholic creed. 
●
●
Along with celebrating Haydn’s faith, this frankly uncharacteristic 
setting of the Credo also celebrates the last line, which translates: 
“Who for our salvation came down from heaven.” In other words, 
this most uncharacteristic Credo is also an expression of Haydn’s 
unwavering conviction that God will be Vienna’s salvation in the face 
of an approaching, atheist Napoleonic army. 
The French Revolution
●
●
On January 24, 1789, the French king, Louis XVI, summoned a meeting 
of the Estates-General in Paris to deal with widespread middle- and 
working-class unrest. The Estates-General divided the population of 
France into three groups: the clergy, the aristocracy, and everybody 
else (some 95 percent of the population).
●
●
For a month, the First and Second Estates—the clergy and 
aristocracy—refused to meet with the Third Estate as equals. 
Consequently, on June 17, 1789, the representatives of the Third Estate 
declared themselves a National Assembly of the People tasked with 
creating a constitution. 
31

Music as a Mirror of History

●
●
In essence, the representatives of the Third Estate, along with a small 
but growing number of defectors from the First and Second Estates, 
proclaimed that their National Assembly represented the French nation. 
●
●
Of course, King Louis XVI revoked the National Assembly and its plan 
to write a constitution. At the same time, French soldiers began to 
pour into Paris. Convinced that Louis and his government were about

monarchy, King 
Louis XVI was set on 
maintaining absolutism.

to crush the assembly by force, crowds took to the streets, and rioting 
and looting broke out. On July 14, 1789, a mob attacked the Bastille 
fortress, which housed a substantial armory. 
●
●
Across France, civil authority crumbled. On July 17, 1789, Louis 
XVI, having been abandoned by the army, was forced to do the 
unthinkable. He called on the assembly at its headquarters in the city 
hall and bowed his head in submission to his new masters. 
●
●
Meanwhile, other members of the royal family and the aristocracy fled 
to neighboring countries, where they put their money and influence 
to work persuading foreign monarchs to march on Paris to save Louis 
XVI, punish the revolutionaries, and show the rest of Europe that such 
anti-monarchial activities would not be tolerated. But the European 
powers declined to intervene in French domestic affairs.
●
●
In August 1789, Louis XVI refused to endorse legislation abolishing 
feudalism and to uphold the Declaration of the Rights of Man and 
the Citizen. In response, the national mood in France shifted toward 
extremism, which had a devastating impact on France’s foreign policy. 
The National Assembly became more xenophobic, more aggressive, 
and less conciliatory toward what it claimed were France’s natural 
enemies: the monarchies of Europe. 
●
●
The fragile balance among the revolutionary spirit of the streets, 
the appearance of extreme factions within the government, and the 
constitutional monarchists who held out hope that Louis could be 
convinced to participate in the government was destroyed during the 
night of June 20 and 21, 1791. On that night, the royal family, having 
snuck out of Paris in disguise, was arrested in the town of Varennes in 
northeast France. 
●
●
They were headed for the Austrian Netherlands, which was ruled by 
Queen Marie-Antoinette’s brother, the Holy Roman Emperor Leopold 
II. Presumably, Louis intended to engineer a counterrevolution once 
he was safely out of France. But the royal escape was thwarted, 
33

34
and Louis and his family were returned to Paris in disgrace. It was 
the turning point in the revolution. Louis and Marie-Antoinette were 
ultimately charged with treason and executed in 1793.
Trouble on the Continent
●
●
Louis’s arrest in June of 1791 also marked a turning point for his fellow 
European monarchs. The laissez-faire attitude they had exhibited 
toward the revolution in 1789 was dead by 1791. Belatedly, they began 
to realize that the French were preparing to export revolution.
●
●
The Austrians and the Prussians were the first to act. In August of 1791, 
they jointly issued the Declaration of Pillnitz, which the radicalized 
French government took as a veiled declaration of war. The French 
themselves declared war on April 20, 1792. Four months later, on 
August 19, an army made up of Austrians, Prussians, Hessians, and 
French émigrés marched into France. 
●
●
The Prussians issued the Brunswick Manifesto, which informed France 
that the allied invasion was intended to rescue King Louis from house 
arrest at the Tuileries Palace and return him to the throne. It indicated 
that any resistance would be mercilessly crushed. 
●
●
Rather than inspiring fear, however, the manifesto galvanized the 
French nation against the invading allies and opened the door for 
the worst of the radicals to take control of the French government.
●
●
It also sealed the king and queen’s fate. A revolutionary mob 
stormed the Tuileries Palace, took the royal family as prisoners, and 
compelled the Legislative Assembly to suspend the monarchy.
●
●
Thus began the French Revolutionary Wars, during which revolutionary 
France had to fight off the combined forces of Prussia and Austria. 
By 1793, France was also at war with most of the kingdoms of Italy, 
Great Britain, the Dutch Republic, Spain, and the Holy Roman Empire. 
French armies responded magnificently, and within 10 years, French 
armies would be threatening—and, eventually, occupying—much of 
Europe and northern Africa. 

Lecture 4—Haydn: Mass in the Time of War (1797) 
●
●
In fact, the Revolutionary Wars preserved the revolution. The external 
threat allowed the revolutionary government to destroy the remaining 
strongholds of royalist loyalty in France. Freed from any need to 
moderate its actions, the government executed Louis XIV on January 
21, 1793, and instituted the Reign of Terror between September 1793 
and July 1794. 
The Rise of Napoleon
●
●
Among the victorious French army was a recently demoted artillery 
general: a smart, ambitious 27-year-old Corsican named Napoleon 
Bonaparte. He had “earned” his demotion by refusing to serve in a 
murderous “pacification” campaign against French royalists in west-
central France. He was packed off to Paris and told to report to the 
Committee of Public Safety.
●
●
Just 18 days after Napoleon was struck from the list of generals in 
regular service, a counterrevolutionary uprising began in Paris. On 
October 3, 1795, royalists in Paris declared a rebellion against the 
National Convention.
●
●
Napoleon was assigned to defend the Tuileries Palace, where the 
National Convention was headquartered. On October 5, the royalists 
attacked, and Napoleon and his cannon were ready. Some 1,400 
royalists were killed, and the rest fled for their lives. 
●
●
Instantly, Napoleon was the toast of Paris. On November 2, 1795, a new 
government was installed—the Directorate—and Napoleon became its 
darling. He was immediately given command of the army of Italy. 
The Italian Campaign
●
●
The Directory had inherited a war with Austria, but what it really 
wanted was peace: peace to stabilize the government and the French 
economy and, in so doing, to finally bring the revolution to an end. 
35

Music as a Mirror of History
36
But the only sort of peace the Directory could accept would be one 
achieved through victory. 
●
●
With the Habsburg capital of Vienna as the final objective, Bonaparte 
was instructed to invade Italy, then move northeast to attack Vienna 
while two other French armies invaded Germany and, moving 
eastward, enveloped Vienna in a three-way pincer. 
●
●
Napoleon took command of the army of Italy on March 27, 1796, 
and in less than two months, had conquered most of northern Italy. 
This incredible advance was completed before the other two French 
armies detailed with taking Vienna had even begun their advance into 
Germany. 
●
●
With time on his hands, Napoleon was instructed to invade central 
Italy. The objective was to extort as much money as possible out 
of the Italian principalities in his path and to flush the British out of 
Italy. In just 28 days, he achieved both objectives, establishing French 
hegemony in Italy with almost no losses to his command.
Situation in Vienna
●
●
The events in Italy were observed from Vienna with horror. 
Bonaparte’s army of Italy was perceived not just as invincible but as 
evil incarnate. It was at this time and under these circumstances that 
Haydn composed his Mass in a Time of War.
●
●
Haydn had been in London, but he returned to Vienna in 1795. He was 
employed part-time by Prince Nikolaus II Esterhazy. Starting in 1796, 
Nikolaus tasked Haydn with composing an annual Mass in honor of the 
name day of his Hungarian wife, Princess Maria Josepha Hermenegild. 
●
●
In two passages, the kettledrums are most pronounced: at the 
conclusion of the Sanctus and in the Agnus Dei. The Sanctus concludes 
with a passage called the “Benedictus” and this line: “Hosanna in 
excelsis” (“Hosanna in the highest”). 

Lecture 4—Haydn: Mass in the Time of War (1797) 
●
●
Haydn’s use of trumpets and drums in the Agnus Dei converts this 
ordinarily lyric and contemplative final section of the Mass into a fire-
breathing affirmation of military triumph.
●
●
The first half of the Agnus Dei has the tragic spirit of a funeral 
march. It represents the pain and loss that must be borne in 
wartime. 
●
●
The second half is brilliant, martial, and triumphant. Haydn’s 
message here is clear: “Grant us peace, Lord, through victory.”
The Austrian Surrender
●
●
Napoleon resumed his march toward Vienna in March of 1797. 
The moment of truth for Austria occurred at the Battle of Tarvis in 
what today is the far northeastern corner of Italy. The battle, fought 
between March 21 and 23, 1797, was a rout by Napoleon. 
●
●
On April 7, with Napoleon’s forward troops only 60 miles from Vienna, 
the Austrians requested a ceasefire. Acting on his own authority, 
Napoleon negotiated an armistice that was signed on April 18, 1797.
●
●
The army of Italy was Napoleon’s first command, and he had made the 
most of it. In less than a year, he had defeated five armies, four of which 
were larger than his own. Along the way, he took 160,000 prisoners and 
sent enough loot back to Paris to keep the Directory solvent. 
●
●
As for Haydn, it’s no small irony that among the last earthly sounds he 
heard before his death 13 years later was the bombardment of Vienna 
by yet another Napoleon-led army. 
37

Beethoven: The Farewell Sonata (1810)
I
t is difficult today to appreciate the degree to which Napoleon and 
the revolution he was presumed to embody loomed over Europe 
during the first half of the 18th century. Napoleon’s admirers included 
such German and Austrian patriots as Immanuel Kant, Georg Wilhelm 
Friedrich Hegel, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, and Friedrich Schiller. As 
for Ludwig van Beethoven, his identification with Napoleon was personal. 
Napoleon—a Florentine among Corsicans and a Corsican among the 
French—was an outsider who had risen to the heights thanks to his own 
genius and industry. For Beethoven—a Rhinelander among the Viennese, 
hearing impaired among the hearing healthy, a man of genius struggling 
to achieve the sublime—Napoleon Bonaparte was his soulmate. 
Beethoven and Napoleon
●
●
In 1803, Beethoven told his friends that he was moving to Paris—the 
home of Napoleon and the revolution. But he became enraged when 
he learned, in 1804, that Napoleon had crowned himself emperor. 
He violently scratched out the word Bonaparte from the title page 
of a symphony he was writing and retitled it Eroica, “The Heroic 
Symphony.” 
●
●
Beethoven didn’t move to Paris, but Napoleon’s actions would 
continue to shape his life and music for the next 11 years. Indeed, 
Beethoven composed a number of major works in response to 
Napoleon’s actions, including Wellington’s Victory of 1813 and the 
Piano Sonata in E-flat Major, op. 81a, also known as the Farewell 
Sonata, of 1810. 
Lecture

Lecture 5—Beethoven: The Farewell Sonata (1810) 
39
Beethoven initially perceived Napoleon 
in almost mystical terms: as the 
personification of the French Revolution 
who would liberate Europe from the 
grip of absolutism and the papacy.

Music as a Mirror of History
40
●
●
The Farewell Sonata is so-called because it commemorates the 
departure from Vienna of Beethoven’s friend, student, and patron 
Archduke Johannes Joseph Rainer Rudolf in the face of an advancing 
Napoleonic army. Beethoven could not have been more explicit about 
the “meaning” of this sonata, as its three movements are entitled: 
“Farewell,” “Absence,” and “Return.” 
●
●
Beethoven’s Farewell Sonata offers us but the tiniest slice of how one 
resident of Vienna was affected by the events of the time. But the 
big story behind the sonata is the amazing fortitude, resilience, and 
ongoing ineptitude of the Austrian Empire in the face of Napoleon 
Bonaparte.
War and the French Economy
●
●
When the French Revolutionary Wars began in 1792, the French 
seemed genuinely to have believed their slogan “War to the castles; 
peace to the cottages!” Unfortunately, this idealism didn’t last long. 
The poorly supplied and generally unpaid French Revolutionary armies 
were forced, by necessity, to live off the land they invaded, which meant 
stealing from the very peasants they were presumably liberating. 
●
●
By 1795, France had more than 1 million soldiers in the field. The newly 
formed French government, the Directory, was broke and handing out 
IOUs. Thus, the directors decided to wage war for profit by sending 
Napoleon into Italy. 
●
●
As it turned out, Napoleon’s genius for battlefield improvisation was 
equaled by his genius for extortion and looting. Millions of francs worth 
of cash, precious metals, jewels, and artworks were “requisitioned” 
and sent back to France. For their part, the soldiers looted everything 
they could.
●
●
The economy of postrevolutionary France became dependent on war. 
Particularly ripe for plunder was the sprawling Austrian-Habsburg 
Empire.

Lecture 5—Beethoven: The Farewell Sonata (1810) 
●
●
Of all the forces that fought against France between 1792 and 
1815, it was the Austrian-Habsburg army that carried the greatest 
burden of war. Defeated and humiliated repeatedly, the Austrians 
nevertheless continued to rise from the ashes. 
●
●
What we refer to as Austria—or the Habsburg Empire—was a 
sprawling, multinational empire that stretched across Western, 
Central, and Eastern Europe. This territory was ruled out of Vienna 
by the Habsburg emperor, also known as the Holy Roman Emperor. 
The War of the First Coalition, 1792–1797
●
●
On April 20, 1792, the revolutionary French government—convinced 
that it was about to be attacked—declared war on Austria. Nine days 
later, the French invaded the Austrian Netherlands, which today is the 
country of Belgium. The French were convinced that they would be 
welcomed as liberators and that the Austrian garrison would panic 
and run. But the French army was not welcomed, and it broke and ran 
at the first sign of Austrian resistance.
●
●
The Austrians and their Prussian allies then invaded France in July 
1792. But the Austrians and Prussians had invaded with a force far too 
small to achieve their purposes, and within a couple of months, it was 
clear that they were going nowhere. The Prussians decided that the 
invasion was a mistake and walked away. The Austrians had no choice 
but to follow suit.
●
●
The Austrian and Prussian retreat revitalized the French armies, which 
successfully went on the offensive on the Rhine. The retreat also 
further empowered the radical faction in Paris, which convicted King 
Louis XVI of high treason and crimes against the state and executed 
him on January 21, 1793. 
●
●
Having killed its king, France was instantly perceived as a rogue state. 
Spain, England, Holland, and the Kingdom of Sardinia joined Austria 
and Prussia in war against France. Thus was born the First Coalition. 
41

Music as a Mirror of History
42
But these forces fell apart when faced by the numerical superiority of 
France’s army. 
●
●
By the end of 1795, the First Coalition was down to only two 
members: the Kingdom of Sardinia—meaning northwest Italy—and 
Austria. Both Sardinia and Austria met their fate at the hands of the 
French army of Italy. 
●
●
Napoleon’s advance troops were just 80 miles southwest of Vienna 
in April 1797 when the Austrians sued for peace. The result was the 
Treaty of Campo Formio, which was signed on October 18, 1797. 
Among other territories, the Austrian Netherlands was ceded to 
France and various Mediterranean islands. 
Napoleon Ascendant
●
●
Napoleon returned to Paris a national hero. He leveraged his fame 
by proposing an invasion of Egypt, claiming that this would protect 
France’s commercial interests while undermining British commerce 
and access to India. 
●
●
While Napoleon was in Egypt, Palestine, and Syria, a Second Coalition 
was formed back in Europe, uniting Austria, Great Britain, Portugal, 
the Kingdom of Naples, Russia, and the Ottoman Turks. Although 
this Second Coalition would last no longer than the first, it started 
well. With the Austrians in the lead, the coalition scored some major 
victories; the French were pushed to the wall in Switzerland and 
ejected from Italy. 
●
●
These losses brought down the government in Paris. Napoleon, still in 
Egypt, was recalled by a group plotting a coup d’état. Their plan was 
for Napoleon to take over the military and protect the coup. But the 
30-year-old Bonaparte managed to seize power himself. 
●
●
Even as Napoleon seized power, the Second Coalition fell apart. Political 
infighting caused the British and Russians to leave. Once again, Austria 

Lecture 5—Beethoven: The Farewell Sonata (1810) 
was the last man standing, and once again, the Austrian army became 
Napoleon’s whipping boy—first at the Battle of Marengo on June 14, 
1800, then at the Battle of Hohenlinden on December 3, 1800.
●
●
Once again, Austria sued for peace. The Treaty of Lunéville was 
signed in February 1801. Convinced that Austria would now behave 
itself, the terms of the treaty were mild: Austria was merely required 
to adhere to the conditions of the earlier Treaty of Campo Formio and 
to relinquish some lands in Germany. This treaty lasted for four years, 
until Austria joined Russia and Great Britain in the Third Coalition.
●
●
Unfortunately, the Third Coalition met its end on December 2, 1805, at 
the Battle of Austerlitz in Moravia. Generally regarded as Napoleon’s 
single greatest victory, it was at Austerlitz that he annihilated a much 
larger Russian and Austrian army. The Russian army limped east to 
Poland, and the Austrians once again sued for peace.
●
●
The Treaty of Pressburg was signed on December 26, 1805. At the 
time, the French were no longer inclined to be lenient. 
●
●
Large swatches of Italy and Bavaria were ceded to France. A 
war indemnity of 40 million francs was levied, and Vienna and its 
environs were occupied by the French army. 
●
●
The crowning blow was Napoleon’s creation of the Confederation 
of the Rhine, a collection of two dozen German states that together 
became a buffer zone between France and Austria. With the 
creation of the confederation, the Holy Roman Empire, which had 
been in existence since the year 962, ceased to exist. 
●
●
In 1806 and 1807, France crushed the Fourth Coalition, which had 
combined the forces of Prussia, Russia, Saxony, Sweden, and Great 
Britain. Seemingly invincible, Napoleon then made the mistake he’d 
regret for the rest of his life: In 1807, he allowed himself to be sucked 
into war in Portugal and Spain. This Peninsular War was Napoleon’s 
Vietnam: an unwinnable war, fought in the harshest of conditions 
against guerillas and an organized army. 
43

Music as a Mirror of History
44
●
●
In October 1808, with Napoleon and most of his grande armée headed 
off to Spain, Austria allied itself with Great Britain and received in 
return a loan with which to finance yet another war with France. This 
Fifth Coalition, however, was no coalition at all; when Austria invaded 
Bavaria on April 10, 1809, it was all by itself.
●
●
The Fifth Coalition had no more success against France than the first 
four. Within just a few weeks, Napoleon’s armies were advancing on 
Vienna for the second time in three years. 
Attack on Vienna
●
●
Those individuals with the means to flee Vienna—meaning the royalty 
and aristocracy—did so on May 4, 1809. The rest of the population—
meaning the people who had not made war on France—were left 
behind to fend for themselves. Among them was Beethoven, who 
found refuge in the house of his brother Casper. 
●
●
On May 10, the French surrounded the city. Napoleon took up 
residence at the Schönbrunn Palace outside the city walls and, from 
there, sent a message to the commandant of Vienna, Archduke 
Maximilian: Surrender or be bombed. Archduke Maximilian refused, 
and the bombardment commenced the following day. 
●
●
In fact, Napoleon’s battery consisted of only 20 howitzers. They 
caused minimal damage but spread maximum panic, which was what 
Napoleon had counted on. The instrument of surrender was signed 
at 2:00 a.m. on May 13, and Vienna was occupied. Just 33 days had 
passed since Austria had begun the war. 
●
●
Among those who had evacuated the city in May was Archduke 
Johannes Joseph Rainer Rudolf. Beethoven dedicated more important 
works to Rudolf than to any other single person, including the Farewell 
Sonata; the Missa Solemnis; the Sonata for Violin and Piano, op. 96; 
the Trio for Violin, ‘Cello, and Piano, op. 97; Piano Concerti nos. 4 and 
5; the Piano Sonata, op. 111; and the Grosse Fuge, op. 133.

Lecture 5—Beethoven: The Farewell Sonata (1810) 
●
●
The Farewell Sonata is about Archduke Rudolf’s departure from 
Vienna on May 4, 1809, in the face of the French invasion, the pain of 
his absence, and the joy of his return. 
●
●
As mentioned earlier, the introduction begins a drooping, 
descending motive over which Beethoven wrote the word 
“Lebewohl”—“Farewell.” 
This 
descending 
motive 
is 
found 
everywhere in the first movement, and each appearance carries 
with it the same meaning as the one so explicitly assigned by 
Beethoven at the beginning of the movement: farewell.
●
●
The second movement is entitled “Absence.” The music here 
restlessly seeks but does not quite find a center of thematic gravity, 
a perfect metaphor for the unfulfilled yearning that absence creates. 
●
●
The third movement—entitled “Return”—begins with an introduction 
that is as joyful as the first-movement introduction was sad and 
wistful. The manic-euphoria of this introduction is followed by a 
gigue—a dance—depicting the joy of reunion. 
Surrender of Vienna
●
●
The surrender of Vienna in May of 1809 did not end the Fifth Coalition. 
That death-blow came two months later, on July 5 and 6, 1809, when 
Napoleon and his army destroyed the Austrians at the Battle of 
Wagram, about 10 miles northeast of Vienna. 
●
●
The Treaty of Schönbrunn was signed in occupied Vienna on October 
14, 1809. This time, Napoleon was determined to punish the Austrians. 
A massive war indemnity was dropped on Austria, which was forced 
to join Napoleon’s Continental System. The treaty also stripped Austria 
of Croatia and the regions of Salzburg, West Galicia, Tarnopol, and 
Trieste. All told, the Austrian Empire lost one-sixth of its population. 
●
●
It remains something of a miracle, then, that Austria would rise once 
again and, as a member of the Sixth Coalition, play a major role in 
Napoleon’s defeat. It’s a story that will be told when we discuss 
another of Beethoven’s works: Wellington’s Victory.
45

Beethoven: Wellington’s Victory (1813)
B
eethoven’s 15-minute-long orchestra work Wellington’s Victory 
was, in his lifetime, the single most popular and profitable of his 
works. Artistically, Wellington’s Victory is, in the words of Herbert 
Weinstock, ”an atrocious potboiler”—without any doubt the worst 
“major” piece of music ever written by a major composer. The truth is, 
we can’t evaluate Wellington’s Victory merely as an artwork, because it’s 
much more than that: It’s a snapshot of its time and place, a mirror of 
the extravagant exuberance and hope that followed a series of French 
defeats that foretold the end of Napoleon. 
Overview of Wellington’s Victory
●
●
Wellington’s Victory is cast in two parts. The first part is entitled 
“The Battle,” and the second part, “Victory Symphony.” The battle 
commemorated by the piece was fought in Spain on June 21, 1813, 
between a French army led by Napoleon’s brother Joseph Bonaparte 
and an English army led by Arthur Wellesley, duke of Wellington. The 
victory celebrated in the second part is, obviously, Wellington’s victory 
over the French. 
●
●
Following an introduction, the battle music begins and seems to go 
on forever. Two bass drums portray the French and English artillery. 
Ratchets are used portray the rattle of musket fire. Admittedly, the 
compositional genre of battle music rarely aspires to high art, but this 
music does not even qualify as low art. 
●
●
By the 1820s, the patriotism that had made Wellington’s Victory so 
incredibly popular in 1813 and 1814 had dissipated, and the piece came 
to be seen for what it was. 
Lecture

Lecture 6—Beethoven: Wellington’s Victory (1813) 
Beethoven’s Ambivalence
●
●
The word that best represents Beethoven’s attitude toward Napoleon 
is ambivalence. It was an ambivalence shared by many of his 
generation. Napoleon had initially been perceived as a savior who 
promised to bring about a new age by liberating Europe from the 
shackles of monarchy and papacy. But in the end, Napoleon gladly 
horse-traded with the papacy and crowned himself emperor: Having 
promised republicanism, he delivered despotism. 
Central to Beethoven’s reinvention 
of himself as a hero battling and 
overcoming fate was the mythical image 
of Napoleon, the “little corporal” who 
came to encompass the world through 
the power of his own will and genius.
47

Music as a Mirror of History
48
●
●
There was nothing ambivalent, however, about Napoleon’s success. 
After a series of astonishing military victories, he took control of the 
French government as First Consul on November 9, 1799. He was 
then crowned emperor on December 2, 1804. Napoleon’s regime 
proceeded to reorder and modernize French culture and society even 
as his wars of conquest continued across the continent. By 1810, his 
Greater French Empire included Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, 
Switzerland, Italy, and most of what today is Germany and Poland.
●
●
Beethoven’s 
ambivalence 
toward 
Napoleon 
was 
deepened 
immeasurably by his own personal identification with the man. They 
both saw themselves as outsiders: common-born provincial foreigners 
living and working among urban elites. They each rose from obscurity 
thanks to their genius and determination. They were both children of 
the Enlightenment and thoroughly modern men. 
●
●
When Beethoven experienced a near-suicidal depression in the 
autumn of 1802 owing to his progressive hearing loss, he managed 
to bring himself out of it by reinventing himself as a man and artist 
battling and triumphing over fate itself. Beethoven’s personal 
reinvention was nothing less than a musical revolution, in that it 
effectively placed personal self-expression ahead of the traditions, 
rituals, and niceties of the classical style.
●
●
Beethoven’s Symphony no. 3, largely composed in 1803 and completed 
in 1804, was his “coming-out” piece, his first major public work to 
exhibit his new self-expressive path. Beethoven originally entitled the 
symphony Bonaparte, but when he heard about Napoleon’s coronation 
as emperor, he flew into a rage and threw out the dedication to 
Napoleon. He did not, however, throw out the symphony, which came 
to be known as the Eroica, or “Heroic Symphony.” 
Beethoven as a Viennese
●
●
By removing the dedication to Bonaparte from his Third Symphony 
and deciding against a move to Paris, Beethoven experienced a 

Lecture 6—Beethoven: Wellington’s Victory (1813) 
subtle but powerful psychological transformation. By 1804, he’d been 
headquartered in Vienna for 12 years, since 1792. But he never truly felt 
at home there. By forswearing the move to Paris in 1804, Beethoven—
advertently or inadvertently—was finally putting down roots in Vienna. 
●
●
In May 1809, Napoleon and his army again occupied Vienna. Beethoven 
suffered physically, emotionally, and financially, losing most of his 
savings thanks to the runaway inflation and ruinous taxes that were 
imposed during the occupation to pay off Austria’s war indemnity to 
France.
●
●
Immediately after Vienna was occupied, a music-loving French officer 
named Baron de Trémont decided to visit and meet his idol, “Louis van 
Beethoven.” The baron approached the composer Luigi Cherubini and 
Beethoven’s friend Anton Reicha to arrange an introduction, but both 
men refused, stating that Beethoven hated the French. Nevertheless, 
the baron went to Beethoven’s home and was finally admitted for the 
first of what became a series of lengthy visits. According to the baron, 
Napoleon was never far from Beethoven’s thoughts.
The Peninsular War
●
●
In terms of Napoleon’s impact on Beethoven’s career, no single event 
loomed larger than the defeat of a French army in Spain on June 21, 
1813, a defeat commemorated by Beethoven in Wellington’s Victory. 
●
●
What Vietnam was for the United States and Afghanistan for the 
Soviet Union, so the Iberian Peninsula—Spain and Portugal—was for 
Napoleon in 1816: a war contested on an asymmetrical battlefield that 
could often not be fought by traditional means.
●
●
Between 1808 and 1813, the French sustained more than 300,000 
casualties in Iberia and poured billions of gold francs into the 
campaign. Nevertheless, the resistance from the population was such 
that the Peninsular War became a people’s war, one that inspired and 
encouraged Napoleon’s enemies across Europe.

Two events led to the Peninsular War, the first of which was the War 
of the Pyrenees, which was the Iberian theater of the War of the First 
Coalition. The war pitted the young French Republic against Spain 
and Portugal and ran from March 1793 to July 1795. France won, and 
Spain, in defeat, signed an alliance with the French. But Portugal 
refused to make peace.
●
●
In November 1806, continental Europe was enjoying a rare bit of peace, 
as Napoleon had either conquered or was allied with virtually every 
major power on the continent. The exception was Great Britain. Thus, 
on November 21, 1806, Napoleon issued the Berlin Decree; it installed 
the Continental System across continental Europe and forbade any 
European country from trading or communicating with Great Britain. 
The Continental System was an economic blockade that, in the end, 
did much more damage to France and her allies than to Great Britain. 
●
●
The regent and future king of Portugal, John VI, had no intention 
of honoring France’s continental blockade. Ever the gambler, 
Napoleon saw this “problem” as an opportunity to invade Portugal 
and occupy Spain, which though presumably a French ally, had been 
surreptitiously trading with the Brits. 
●
●
The Peninsular War began on October 18, 1807, when a French army 
of 25,000 began its march on Lisbon. The French arrived in Lisbon on 
November 30, only to discover that a flotilla of 54 ships, bearing some 
19,000 people—including the Portuguese royal family and court—had 
sailed off to safety in Brazil the day before. France had taken Portugal 
almost without firing a shot and now had an army at the back of its 
erstwhile ally, Spain. 
●
●
Under the pretext of reinforcing Portugal, French troops continued 
to flow across Spain, where they began to occupy cities and 
fortifications. It took some time for the Spanish royal family to figure 
out what was happening. By the time it did, it was too late: In February 
1808, Napoleon ordered his troops to seize a series of vital Spanish 
fortresses and cities, including Madrid and Barcelona. The Spanish 

Lecture 6—Beethoven: Wellington’s Victory (1813) 
royals were undone and forced to abdicate in March. Napoleon 
appointed his older brother Joseph to rule Spain as Joseph I. 
●
●
The uprisings began almost immediately. The most famous of them—
the Dos de Mayo (“Second of May”)—occurred in Madrid in 1808, when 
a mob attacked the French garrison. The uprising was mercilessly 
crushed, and hundreds of men were executed by firing squad the next 
day. The killings in Madrid thoroughly discredited French claims that 
they had occupied Spain in order to protect it. 
●
●
Representatives of various Spanish insurgent groups traveled together 
to London, arriving on June 7, 1808. After five weeks of negotiations, 
they convinced the British government that it was in its best interest to 
intervene in Spain. On August 1, 1808, a force of 9,000 British soldiers 
under the command of Sir Arthur Wellesley landed in Portugal. 
The Defeat of France
●
●
The victory over Napoleonic France was assured by three events: 
the retreat from Moscow in the fall of 1812; the Battle of Vitoria in the 
Basque country of northern Spain on June 21, 1813; and the Battle of 
Leipzig (or Battle of the Nations), fought between October 16 and 19, 
1813.
●
●
With these defeats, the myth of Napoleon’s invincibility was shattered. 
His alliances began to unravel. On February 29, 1813, King Frederick 
Wilhelm III of Prussia abandoned the Continental System and allied 
Prussia with Russia. On March 3, Sweden allied with Great Britain. 
●
●
On August 12, 1813—in direct response to the French defeat at the 
Battle of Vitoria—Austria revoked its treaties with France and joined 
what would turn out to be the Sixth Coalition. Austria put more than 
300,000 troops into the field and called up more. 
●
●
The decisive battle of the War of the Sixth Coalition took place in 
Leipzig, in what today is central Germany, between October 16 and 
51

The French forces in the Peninsular 
War—reduced by the incursion into 
Russia—were no match for the combined 
forces of Britain, Portugal, and Spain 
commanded by Sir Arthur Wellesley.

Lecture 6—Beethoven: Wellington’s Victory (1813) 
19, 1813. It involved more than 600,000 troops and was the bloodiest 
battle of the Napoleonic Wars. Napoleon’s army was routed and 
retreated toward France.
Beethoven in Love
●
●
The French occupiers departed Vienna after the signing of the Treaty 
of Schönbrunn on October 14, 1809, and something approaching 
normalcy gradually returned to Austrian lands.
●
●
Roughly 18 months later—during the spring of 1811—Beethoven fell 
in love. It’s almost certain that the woman was Antonie Brentano, 
an aristocratic mother of four. It’s also almost certain that she and 
Beethoven physically consummated their affair and that she offered 
to leave her husband and children for Beethoven. But in July 1812, 
Beethoven, realizing that he was in over his head, broke off the affair.
●
●
Beethoven was devastated and sank into depression. By 1813, he 
had fallen into such a state that he could no longer compose. But 
sometime during the summer of 1813, his friend Johann Nepomuk 
Mälzel proposed that Beethoven compose a piece of music celebrating 
Wellington’s victory at Vitoria.
Celebration in Vienna
●
●
The news of Napoleon’s rout and retreat from Leipzig was greeted in 
the Austrian Empire with great joy. In December 1813, two concerts 
were given in Vienna for the benefit of Austrian and Bavarian soldiers 
who had been wounded in action. It was at these concerts that 
Beethoven’s Wellington’s Victory was first performed, to a level of 
acclaim that was nothing short of hysterical.
●
●
The opening of Wellington’s Victory depicts, with painful 
predictability, the approach of the two armies. Wellington’s army 
enters first. We know it’s Wellington, because after some drumming 
and a brief fanfare, the orchestra plays Thomas Arne’s patriotic 
song “Rule Britannia.” 
53

Music as a Mirror of History
54
●
●
The entrance of the French army is marked by more drums and 
another fanfare, followed by a popular French marching song, 
“Marlborough’s March to War.” A challenge and counter-challenge 
are then offered by dueling fanfares, followed by the beginning of 
the battle.
●
●
The second large part of Wellington’s Victory, “The Victory March,” 
is shockingly artless and cravenly jingoistic. 
●
●
Wellington’s Victory brought Beethoven a level of popularity in 
Vienna he had never before achieved. But it didn’t last, because it 
wasn’t rooted in anything lasting. Rather, the popularity generated by 
Wellington’s Victory was rooted in Austrian pride and patriotism that, 
for a brief period of time, Beethoven came to embody. 
●
●
But when peace finally came, Beethoven’s bubble burst, and he entered 
a long, painful, fallow period. There would be more masterworks and 
more triumphs, but he would never again experience—in his lifetime—
the celebrity that Wellington’s Victory brought him.

Berlioz/de L’Isle: “La Marseillaise” (1830)
“O
ne-hit wonders” is a phrase we use to identify people who 
achieved success once in their lifetimes, never to do so 
again. Like other forms of music, concert music has seen its 
fair share of one-hit wonders, including Max Bruch’s Violin Concerto in G 
Minor of 1867, Engelbert Humperdinck’s Hansel and Gretel of 1893, and 
Carl Orff’s Carmina Burana of 1936. To this list, we can add Claude-Joseph 
Rouget de L’Isle, who wrote the words and music of a song he entitled 
“War Song of the Army of the Rhine.” We know it as “The Marseillaise,” 
and it became the French national anthem. In 1830, it was arranged for 
vocal soloists, chorus, and orchestra by Hector Berlioz.
“La Marseillaise”
●
●
Claude-Joseph Rouget de L’Isle was a career army officer, an able 
poet, and a credible composer, violinist, and singer. On May 1, 1791, 
he was posted to the French city of Strasbourg, which sits on the 
western bank of the Rhine River, across from Germany. In this location, 
both Strasbourg and Rouget de L’Isle were in the crosshairs of the 
First Coalition, the alliance between Austria and Prussia that invaded 
France in July 1792, intent on putting Louis XVI back on the French 
throne and destroying the revolution. 
●
●
On April 20, 1792—three months before the Austrian-Prussian 
invasion—France declared war on Austria. On April 25, swept up by 
the spirit of the time, Rouget de L’Isle wrote the words and music to 
what he called “War Song of the Army of the Rhine.” 
●
●
The song quickly became a rallying cry for revolutionary France. 
Among the thousands who learned it by heart was a young doctor 
Lecture

named François Mireur, who had just received a commission in the 
French revolutionary army. 
●
●
Mireur was sent to the port city of Marseille in southeast France to 
organize volunteers. He sang the song at a patriotic gathering, and 
it caught on instantly. By acclamation, the troops adopted it as the 
official marching song of the National Guard of Marseilles. 
●
●
On July 30, 1792, these troops marched through Paris singing what 
from that moment forward came to be known as “La Marseillaise.” 
●
●
Like French democracy itself, “La Marseillaise” had a rough ride. On July 
14, 1795, it was decreed the French national anthem. But Napoleon didn’t 
like it; thus, when he declared himself emperor in 1804, it was replaced 
by a dull patriotic song called “Let’s Ensure the Salvation of the Empire.” 
●
●
“La Marseillaise” was banned outright between 1815 and 1830, during 
the Bourbon restoration monarchies of Louis XVIII and Charles X. It 
made a comeback in 1830 but fell out of favor again in 1851 when a 
coup d’état put Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte on the throne as Emperor 
Napoleon III. 
●
●
After Napoleon III’s downfall, “La Marseillaise” was adopted as the 
official anthem of the international revolutionary movement by the 
Paris Commune of 1871. Eight years later, it was once again declared 
the French national anthem and remains so to this day. 
The Restoration
●
●
On March 30, 1814, the victorious allies of the Sixth Coalition rode 
into Paris, intent on dismantling Napoleon’s “empire,” as well as the 
revolutionary movement that had spawned the Napoleonic age. 
●
●
Among the first orders of business was to restore the Bourbon family 
dynasty. The crown went to Louis XVI’s younger brother, who had 
lived in exile from 1791 to 1814. He was crowned Louis XVIII on April 
11, 1814. With the exception of the 100 Days in 1815, during which 
Napoleon made his brief comeback, Louis XVIII ruled until 1824.

Lecture 7—Berlioz/de L’Isle: “La Marseillaise” (1830) 
57
●
●
The coalition that had defeated Napoleon had no intention of creating 
another strongman-style government in France. Thus, a constitution 
was drawn up called the Charter of 1814. A bicameral legislature was 
created, consisting of an elected Chamber of Deputies and a Chamber 
of Peers appointed by the king. 
●
●
Louis XVIII ruled at a difficult time, as long-suppressed royalists sought 
to avenge themselves against the revolutionaries and Bonapartist 
“traitors.” The king did his best to limit vendettas and bloodshed and 
issued a general amnesty in 1816. He was a centrist and a populist who 
was haunted by the fear of what would happen if (and when) he was 
succeeded by his ultra-royalist younger brother, Charles-Philippe, the 
count of Artois. 
●
●
Louis XVIII died on September 16, 1824, and was indeed succeeded by his 
brother, who reigned as Charles X. Like Louis XVIII, Charles X had spent 
the years from 1791 to 1814 in exile. But where Louis XVIII understood 
that France could never return to the absolutism of the ancien regime, 
Charles X intended to turn back the clock some 35 years.
●
●
Of course, that was impossible, largely because any king of France 
after 1815 had the delicate task of reconciling the restoration with the 
revolution. The only way to do that was to acknowledge the events of 
the previous 35 years and govern from the center. 
●
●
Several policies alienated Charles X from the majority of the French 
population, including paying out huge indemnities to nobles whose 
property had been confiscated by the revolution, enacting an anti-
sacrilege law that required the death penalty for any act of blasphemy 
committed in a church, and re-empowering the church establishment. 
●
●
In 1827, 1828, and 1829, when the voting public elected parliamentary 
majorities that did not align with his interests, Charles X fired the 
opposition prime ministers. Although the constitution legally entitled 
him to do these things, Charles X completely misjudged the temper of 
the French people, particularly the Parisians.

●
●
It all came to a head when the king and his ministers suspended the 
constitution and then—on July 25, 1830—issued a number of anti-
liberal measures. Called the Four Ordinances, they dissolved the newly 
elected Chamber of Deputies; imposed censorship on the press; took 
away the right to vote from bankers, merchants, and industrialists; and 
called for new elections based on the remaining aristocratic electorate.
●
●
The Four Ordinances—delivered to a public that had already beheaded 
one king—were published in the official government newspaper. 
That evening, crowds gathered in and around the Palais-Royale and 
chanted “Down with the Bourbons!” 
The Three Glorious Days
●
●
On the morning of Tuesday, July 27, 1830, police fanned out across the 
city to shut down the newspapers. Mobs of working people, students, 
members of the middle class, former National Guardsmen, and army 
veterans stood shoulder to shoulder against the police and soldiers. 
The soldiers shot into the mobs. The mobs stormed barracks and 
police stations, “liberating” weapons and ammunition for their own 
use. Within hours, battle lines were drawn across the city. 
●
●
On the following day, the protesters barricaded the street, and 
increasing numbers of soldiers joined them. In the afternoon, Charles 
X received a message from his commander: “Sire, it is no longer a riot, 
it is a revolution. It is urgent for your majesty to take measures. The 
honor of the crown can still be saved. Tomorrow there will be no time.”
●
●
By the next day, it was clear to Charles X that his time was up. Not 
wanting to become a sacrifice to a revolution, Charles went into exile. 
He died six years later, in 1836.
●
●
One of the witnesses to the Three Glorious Days was Hector Berlioz. 
He was born on December 11, 1803, in the town of La Côte-Saint-
André, near Grenoble in southwestern France. 

Lecture 7—Berlioz/de L’Isle: “La Marseillaise” (1830) 
59
In his memoir, Hector Berlioz 
described a crowd singing “La 
Marseillaise” in the street: “The singers 
… were hot with the emotion of 
combat, and you can imagine the effect 
produced by their thunderous refrain.”

Music as a Mirror of History

●
●
The son of a well-to-do country doctor, Berlioz was sent to 
Paris in September 1821 to study medicine, but he immediately 
dedicated himself to his great passion, music. He entered the Paris 
Conservatoire in 1826, at the age of 23. 
●
●
In his memoir, Berlioz described the spirit in Paris during the 
Three Glorious Days. He told of coming across an impromptu 
chorus singing patriotic songs. He joined them and as they sang, 
they attracted an ever larger and more boisterous crowd. Finally, 
the chorus began to sing the patriotic song that had once been 
the national anthem but had been banned during the Bourbon 
restoration: “La Marseillaise.” 
The Parisian Mind
●
●
Parisians are among the most ferociously independent, anti-
authoritarian, cynical, irascible, and creative people on the planet. 
What other city on earth can boast of having hosted four revolutions, 
two coup d’états, and various smaller uprisings, to say nothing of 
three invasions and occupations in the span of 150 years, while still 
remaining the most beautiful city on earth? 
●
●
For Paris, the transition to modernity began in 1594, when Henry IV—
the first Bourbon king—took up residence in the city. The French Wars 
of Religion, which had been waged for more than 30 years prior to 
Henry’s arrival, had left the city in ruins. 
●
●
Henry brought peace to France in 1598 when he signed the Edict of 
Nantes, which made religious tolerance the law of the land. In 1601, 
he informed the Paris town council that he intended to make the city 
“beautiful and splendid.” He and his successors, Louis XIII and Louis 
XIV, did just that.
●
●
Paris became a city of firsts: the first Western city with streets wide 
enough to accommodate large vehicles, coaches, and carriages; the 
first to institute a municipal postal system; the first to build sidewalks, 
institute mass public transit, and install street lighting. 

Lecture 7—Berlioz/de L’Isle: “La Marseillaise” (1830) 
61
●
●
New bridges, public squares, parks, lights, and boulevards pulled 
people from every walk of life out of their homes and onto the streets, 
where they mingled in a manner new to a Western city. Over the 
course of the 17th century, age-old social distinctions began to break 
down as an ever-broader range of Paris’ population was empowered 
by the dynamic, ever-changing city around them. 
●
●
For the French government, this social leveling had a downside: The 
increasingly empowered, upwardly mobile Parisian population did not 
respond well to the autocracy when it came to their money.
●
●
When the ruinous Thirty Years’ War ended in 1648, the French 
government was nearly bankrupt. Because King Louis XIV was 
just 9 years old, the government was being run by his mother, 
the queen regent Anne of Austria, and France’s chief minister, the 
Italian-born Cardinal Jules Mazarin. In 1648, Mazarin raised taxes 
across the board. 
Paris as we know it was a product 
of the 17th century, when the 
Pont Neuf, the Place Royale, 
the Place Vendôme, and other 
famous structures were built.

Music as a Mirror of History
62
●
●
The nobility, claiming ancient privilege, simply refused to pay. Thus, 
the entire burden fell on the bourgeoisie, the new and increasingly 
wealthy middle class that was the driving force behind Paris’ 
burgeoning economic engine. When the bourgeoisie refused to 
shoulder the entire burden of France’s debt, a struggle broke out 
in Paris and spread across France. The incident was called the 
Fronde, a fronde being a sling, with which Parisian mobs hurled 
stones at the windows of Cardinal Mazarin’s allies. 
●
●
When the dust finally settled in 1653, the monarchy was in control, 
but a new sort of civil war had been fought, one over money and 
national policy. For the Parisians, it was a harbinger of things to 
come. High government officials, members of the aristocracy, and 
even members of the royal family had been insulted and spat upon. 
Their homes had been vandalized; they had been chased through 
the streets and dragged from their carriages; they had been 
beaten, stoned, and even shot at by merchants and workers. 
●
●
By the early 18th century, Paris was a rapidly changing capital city: 
open, thriving, dynamic, hedonistic, fashion-crazed, and politically 
volatile—a socially mixed city characterized by economic opportunity, 
social advancement, and rapid information flow. Given the Parisian 
attitude toward authority, it’s no wonder that the age of European 
revolutions began in Paris in 1789.
Ending the Summer of 1830
●
●
In August 1830, inspired by a performance of “La Marseillaise” that 
he had heard at an opera, Berlioz turned out his own arrangement of 
the piece. Berlioz set all six verses of the hymn, each verse followed 
by the chorus, and scored the piece for a double-sized chorus, vocal 
soloists, a children’s choir, and an orchestra with six trumpets and a 
large complement of percussion. 
●
●
The heady, revolutionary Parisian days of the summer of 1830 
were, sadly, followed by disappointment and disillusionment. The 
monarchy of Louis-Philippe was—as it was said—a platform of 

Lecture 7—Berlioz/de L’Isle: “La Marseillaise” (1830) 
63
boards built over a volcano. Despite the king’s attempt to rule as a 
constitutional monarch, there could be no real reconciliation between 
the revolution and the restoration. Louis-Philippe’s 18-year reign was 
marked by three unsuccessful rebellions and seven assassination 
attempts against the king and his sons. He was overthrown by yet 
another revolution in 1848.

Chopin: Étude in C Minor, Op. 10, No. 12 
(1831)
F
rédéric Chopin was not just one of the greatest composers who 
ever lived but one of the greatest pianists, as well. His greatness 
as a pianist was a function of something more than his faultless 
technique: It was a function of artistry. Chopin could make the piano sing in 
a way that no one before him had ever managed to do. He was a virtuoso, 
but his virtuosity—as both a pianist and as a composer of piano music—
was always employed as a means to an end, rather than the end unto itself.
Chopin’s Études
●
●
An étude is a relatively short work designed around a particular 
technical challenge. Up to Chopin’s time, études—particularly études 
for piano—were dry and repetitive, usually foisted on students to 
teach them technique. 
●
●
With his work, Chopin singlehandedly elevated the genre of piano 
étude into high art, blending expressive poetry and virtuosity into 
compact works of breathtaking beauty. Since their publication in 
the 1830s, Chopin’s études have been celebrated primarily for their 
musical content, rather than their technical content. 
●
●
Altogether, Chopin composed 27 études for piano: the 12 études of 
op. 10, composed between 1829 and 1832; the 12 études of op. 25, 
composed between 1832 and 1836; and the Three New Études, 
composed in 1839.
●
●
Consider the 12th étude of opus 10, set in the key of C minor and 
composed in 1831. This étude is a study for the left hand, which must 
Lecture 
8

Lecture 8—Chopin: Étude in C Minor, Op. 10, No. 12 (1831) 
65
play long, sweeping lines in almost continuous 16th notes. The étude 
runs more than two minutes and is cast in two large sections. The 
bravura (meaning “purposely virtuosic”) of the left-hand part clearly 
marks this piece as being a study. But it is also a powerful, violently 
expressive piece of music. 
Chopin was among the first generation 
of pianists to play what were almost 
modern pianos; he understood that 
these new pianos demanded a new sort 
of étude, one that could demonstrate 
and exploit their capabilities.

Music as a Mirror of History
66
●
●
This étude was inspired by a real-world event: the destruction of 
a Polish uprising and the capture of Warsaw by the Russians on 
September 8, 1831. 
●
●
Chopin—who grew up in Warsaw—had left his hometown at the 
age of 20, intent on achieving fame and fortune in Western Europe. 
On the road to Paris, Chopin was in Stuttgart in southwestern 
Germany when he heard the news of the Polish catastrophe. He 
was devastated. 
●
●
According to Chopin biographer Adam Zamoyski, the capture of 
Warsaw catalyzed Chopin: “The sense of loss sustained on that 
night in Stuttgart never left him. It came to embrace everything—
home, country, family, friends, love and youth—and remained the 
fundamental inspiration for his music.” 
The Partitioning of Poland
●
●
There was a time when Poland was able to hold its own against its 
neighbors: Prussia (and, later, Germany) to the west and Russia to the 
east. Founded in 1569, the Kingdom of Poland—also known as the Polish-
Lithuanian Commonwealth—was one of the largest, most populous, and 
most powerful nations in 16th- and 17th-century Europe. With the first 
constitution in modern European history and an elected monarch, it was 
also one of the most socially advanced nations on earth. 
●
●
The early 17th century was the golden age of the Kingdom of Poland. 
Tragically, the Thirty Years’ War of 1618 to 1648 exacted a terrible toll 
on Poland and made it easy prey. In 1648, a Cossack rebellion in the 
southern portion of Poland (in what today is Ukraine) led to Russian 
occupation of those areas. In 1655, in what was known as the Great 
Deluge, Sweden invaded Poland from the north. 
●
●
It was Russia, though, that continued to eat away at the Polish 
Commonwealth until, in 1768, it became a protectorate of the 
Russian Empire. Presumably, a protectorate is still a sovereign state. 
But for Poland, that sham was revealed in 1772 when, for diplomatic 
reasons, it became advantageous to partition the Polish-Lithuanian 

Lecture 8—Chopin: Étude in C Minor, Op. 10, No. 12 (1831) 
67
Commonwealth. Poland, already largely occupied by Russian troops, 
had no choice but to go along with its own dismantling. 
●
●
Two more partitions followed: one in 1793 and another in 1795. The 
second partition triggered an insurrection called the Kościuszko 
Uprising that was brutally crushed. Russia and Prussia, determined to 
eradicate the revolutionary spirit of the Poles, again partitioned Poland 
in 1795. As a result of this third partition, so much Polish territory had 
been sliced off that the commonwealth simply ceased to exist.
●
●
In 1807, following Napoleon’s victories at the battles of Jena, Austerlitz, 
and Friedland, Prussia ceded a great swath of what had once been 
part of the Kingdom of Poland to France under the terms of the 
Treaties of Tilsit. Napoleon fashioned these lands into a puppet state 
called the duchy of Warsaw, but it ceased to exist when the victorious 
allies once again partitioned Poland in 1815. 
●
●
In 1815, after Napoleon’s defeat, the Congress of Vienna created 
something called Congress Poland. This was a smallish state, 
consisting roughly of what today is central Poland, with Warsaw as its 
capital. On paper at least, Congress Poland was a semi-autonomous 
state with a liberal constitution, a king, and a parliament of nobles 
(called the Sejm), which was tasked with creating laws. 
●
●
The problem, however, was that the new king of Poland was 
Alexander I, the emperor of Russia. Alexander had no intention of 
allowing a Polish bastion of liberty to exist on the western border of 
his autocracy; thus, he ignored the resolutions passed at the Congress 
of Vienna. 
●
●
Tsar Alexander I died on December 1, 1825, and was succeeded by 
his younger brother, Tsar Nicholas I, who outright refused to accept 
the Polish constitution. Instead, he championed a policy called Official 
Nationality, by which the Poles were “encouraged” to accept a Russian 
national identity, accept the autocratic rule of the tsar, and embrace 
Russian Orthodoxy over Polish Catholicism.

Chopin’s Early Life
●
●
Chopin was born on March 1, 1810, in a village about 29 miles west 
of Warsaw. His mother was a native Pole; his father, Nicolas Chopin, 
was French but became a zealous Polish nationalist. In July 1810, the 
Chopin family moved to Warsaw.
●
●
The duchy of Warsaw—a Napoleonic puppet state—constantly aspired 
to re-create the glory days of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. 
The majority of the citizens of the duchy were not happy about 
being ruled from Paris, and Polish conservatives and traditionalists in 
particular resented the authoritarian nature of Napoleonic rule. 
●
●
But the Napoleonic regime introduced a number of modern reforms to 
Polish society. For example, the Napoleonic Code forbade privileges 
based on birth and guaranteed legal equality. The liberalizing effects 
of the Napoleonic occupation caused many Poles to believe that with 
French help, they could restore pre-partition Poland and become, 
once again, a sovereign nation. To that end, nearly 100,000 Polish 
troops marched with Napoleon’s grande armée into Russia in 1812.
●
●
Sadly, very few of those 100,000 lived to see Poland again. Russia 
occupied the duchy in January 1813 as it advanced toward France. 
Polish national hopes were shattered, as they would be again in 1815, 
when the Congress of Vienna repartitioned Poland and turned most 
of what had been the duchy of Warsaw over to Russia.
●
●
Frédéric Chopin left Warsaw on November 2, 1830. Joined by a friend, 
Chopin’s first major stop was Vienna. There, the young men heard the 
heart-stopping news: On November 29, 1830, an armed rebellion had 
broken out in Warsaw against the Russians.
The November Uprising
●
●
The November Uprising was, in fact, a 10-month-long insurrection 
that spread across partitioned Poland, Lithuania, western Belarus, 
and much of Ukraine. The trigger for this revolt was the restoration by 

Lecture 8—Chopin: Étude in C Minor, Op. 10, No. 12 (1831) 
69
Louis Philippe—the new king of France after Charles X—of the French 
constitution and freedom of the press. These moves angered Tsar 
Nicholas I, who decided to invade France.
●
●
For troops, Nicholas turned to Poland, but the Polish military had 
other ideas. After 15 years of Russian subjugation, suppression, 
and disrespect, this was the last straw. Instead of putting down the 
revolution in Paris, the Polish officer corps decided to emulate it. 
●
●
On November 29, 1830, a group of junior officers stationed in 
Warsaw launched the insurrection. They managed to seize the city 
arsenal and distributed 30,000 rifles among Warsaw’s population. 
The Russian garrison fled the city, and more units of the Polish army 
joined the rebellion. 
●
●
The Sejm, which had been essentially outlawed in 1825, convened and 
endorsed the insurrection as “an act of the Nation.” On January 25, by 
acclamation, the Sejm deposed Tsar Nicholas I as king of Poland. In 
doing so, the Sejm broke with the Treaty of Vienna. The Poles claimed 
that they were justified in doing so because tsars Alexander I and 
Nicholas I had disregarded the terms of their constitution.
●
●
The Poles might have rallied enough European support to revise the 
terms of the Treaty of Vienna had they been able to convince the 
Great Powers that their insurrection was a strictly Polish affair. But the 
Poles couldn’t do that because of the revolutionary storm unleashed 
by the uprising. The insurrection spread to western Belarus and 
Ukraine, which compelled the Sejm—in an act of defiance of Russia—
to incorporate those territories into the Polish state. 
●
●
With the annexation of parts of Russia, the insurrection ceased to be a 
strictly Polish issue and became, instead, an international crisis. Under 
these circumstances, and despite popular support for the Polish 
cause, France, England, Austria, and Prussia were unwilling to go 
against Russia—either diplomatically or militarily—on Poland’s behalf. 

Music as a Mirror of History
70
As of May 1831, the Poles were left to slug it out with the Russian 
Empire on their own. 
●
●
The Poles had about 80,000 troops, and they initially acquitted 
themselves quite well. But Russia had unlimited men and materiel, and 
it was just a matter of time before the Poles were defeated. Warsaw 
fell on September 8, 1831, and the last Polish troops put down their 
arms on October 5. 
●
●
It was a stunning, disheartening defeat for the thousands of people 
around the world who had been pulling for the Poles. No one was more 
dismayed than Frédéric Chopin, who also feared for the safety of his 
family and friends in Warsaw. His diary entry at the time is the literary 
equivalent of the piece of music Chopin composed in response to the 
news from Warsaw: the Étude in C Minor, op. 10, no. 12. The unrelenting 
brutality of this étude marks it as unique among Chopin’s work. 
Chopin in Paris
●
●
Chopin arrived in Paris in late September 1831, still seething over the 
events in Poland. To his relief, he learned that his parents and sisters 
were safe. Soon, exiles from Warsaw began to arrive in Paris. 
●
●
To the disappointment of many of his fellow émigrés, Chopin was 
not as politically committed to the great Polish cause as they would 
have hoped. Indeed, Chopin preferred the lifestyle of Paris. Many 
of his friends couldn’t fathom why he didn’t want to return to the 
motherland. 
●
●
The fact that Chopin didn’t want to return to Poland or foment 
revolution did not make him any less of a patriot than his friends. On 
the contrary, Chopin’s patriotism as a Pole was an idealized, mystical, 
even metaphysical thing, a thing that inspired him to musical, if not 
political, action. And as it turned out, it was Chopin’s music that came 
to represent the hopes, dreams, and memories of the émigrés, as well 
as those of the people back home. 

Lecture 8—Chopin: Étude in C Minor, Op. 10, No. 12 (1831) 
71
●
●
Chopin’s particular brand of musical nationalism was unique. Unlike 
other identifiably nationalist composers, Chopin did not use folkloric 
materials or evoke national imagery in his music. Rather, in the words 
of Zamoyski, “Chopin created a musical idiom that transcended music, 
an idiom that in many ways actually helped to mold and condition 
the [Polish] nation itself. That is why he is so central to the national 
narrative: He helped compose it.” 
●
●
After settling in Paris in 1831, Chopin never returned to Poland. As 
for the Polish nation itself, its trials continued for another 158 years. 
Another failed uprising in 1863 and 1864 led Russia to annex Poland 
into the Russian Empire. In 1918, following the end of World War I, an 
independent, sovereign Polish state came back into existence for the 
first time in 146 years. 
●
●
But Poland’s statehood was brief; it was again crushed and 
partitioned—by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union—in 1939, 
and it became one of the principal killing grounds of World War II. 
Partitioned yet again in 1945, Poland became a Soviet satellite and 
disappeared behind the Iron Curtain, only to emerge—finally—as an 
independent nation in 1989.

Glinka: A Life for the Tsar (1836)
T
he action of Mikhail Glinka’s opera A Life for the Tsar takes place 
in 1613, during a war between Russia and Poland. The struggle is 
depicted musically by setting those portions of the opera dominated 
by Russians with Russian folk-like music and those sections dominated by 
Poles with Polish dance music. The almost comic contrast between Russian 
gravitas and Polish foppishness belies the historical conflict between 
Russia and Poland as we understand it today. Keep in mind, however, that 
Russia wasn’t always the aggressor; there was a time when Poland was the 
invader and occupier. The story behind Glinka’s opera A Life for the Tsar is 
what has come to be known as Russia’s time of troubles. 
The Time of Troubles
●
●
The Rurik dynasty (or Rurikids) was founded by a tribal chieftain 
named Rurik in about 862 C.E. The territory occupied by the Rurikids, 
consisting of what is today European Russia, was called Rus. The 
Rurik dynasty proved itself to be resourceful by confederating tribes 
and gobbling up territory over the next centuries.
●
●
The first Russian leader of state to be officially designated tsar was the 
Rurik chieftain Ivan IV Vasilyevich, better known as Ivan the Terrible. 
The last of the Rurik tsars was Fyodor I, Ivan’s son. He was born in 
Moscow in 1557, crowned in 1584 at the age of 27, and died in 1598, a 
few months shy of his 41st birthday. With the end of the Rurik dynasty, 
the time of troubles began.
●
●
The literature has called Fyodor “a weak leader,” “intellectually 
disabled,” and “mentally deficient.” Be that as it may, Fyodor was 
revered by the Russian people. He would not have become tsar had his 
Lecture

Lecture 9—Glinka: A Life for the Tsar (1836) 
older brother, Ivan Ivanovich, lived. But unfortunately, their father—Ivan 
the Terrible—killed the 27-year-old heir apparent during an argument.
Dynastic Difficulties
●
●
Two and a half years after Ivan Ivanovich’s death, Fyodor was crowned 
tsar. It was obvious to everyone that Fyodor could not rule; thus, that 
job passed to a nobleman and senior government minister named 
Boris Godunov, who ruled as regent of Russia from 1585 until Fyodor’s 
death in 1598. Fyodor was married to Boris’s sister, Irina, who was 
unable to produce a male heir.
●
●
A potential male heir to the throne was Fyodor’s younger brother, 
Dmitri Ivanovich. However, Dmitri’s mother, Maria Nagaya, was Ivan 
the Terrible’s seventh wife. As a result, Dmitri was considered to be 
illegitimate, because canon law of Russian Orthodoxy permitted a 
maximum of three marriages. But if Fyodor was to die without having 
produced a male heir, it was possible that young Dmitri could receive 
a dispensation from the church and be allowed to succeed his brother.
●
●
Boris Godunov—as Tsar Fyodor’s regent—no doubt felt threatened 
by the existence of Dmitri and his mother. Thus, Godunov had them 
banished to the remote town of Uglich, about 130 miles north of Moscow.
●
●
On May 15, 1591, the 8-year-old Dmitri’s body was discovered lying in 
a pool of blood in a courtyard. His throat had been slit. A commission 
sent from Moscow determined that Dmitri’s death was an accident: 
He cut his own throat during an epileptic seizure. With Dmitri out of 
the way, Boris was next in line for the crown.
Beginning of the Bad Times 
●
●
When Tsar Fyodor died of natural causes on January 7, 1598, Boris 
Godunov became tsar, bringing an end to the Rurik dynasty that 
had ruled for 736 years. In the 15 years between the end of the Rurik 
73

Music as a Mirror of History
74
dynasty and the establishment of the Romanov dynasty, almost 
everything in Russia fell apart.
●
●
On February 19, 1600, the Huaynaputina volcano in Peru erupted, 
throwing between 16 and 32 million tons of particulate matter into 
the atmosphere. The global impact was catastrophic. In Russia, 1601 
went down as the coldest year in six centuries. Between 1601 and 
1603, Russia suffered a famine that killed one-third of its population. 
Tsar Boris was blamed for this cataclysmic event, because he was 
increasingly perceived as a usurper who had inspired God’s wrath.
●
●
Lying immediately to the west of Russia was the Polish-Lithuanian 
Commonwealth, a large, multinational entity. Factions in the 
commonwealth saw Russia’s problems as an opportunity to march 
into Russia under the guise of rescuing a neighbor in chaos.
●
●
The pretext for this invasion was the miraculous appearance of 
someone claiming to be the presumably dead Tsarevich Dmitri. 
Whether or not anyone really believed this man to be Dmitri was 
immaterial. What mattered was that he was not Boris, and many in 
Russia and Poland found reason to suspend their disbelief and accept 
the false Dmitri as a gift from God.
●
●
In June 1605, an army financed by Polish nobles marched into Russia. 
Thus began a series of wars known as the Dmitriads (“Dmitri Wars”). 
Early Polish success was followed by devastating defeat, and it looked 
as if the invasion would come to an end. But then, Boris Godunov died 
unexpectedly. He was succeeded by his 16-year-old son, Fyodor II. 
●
●
When word got out that Godunov had died, Russian troops began 
defecting to Dmitri’s side. The boyars (aristocrats) in Moscow saw 
exactly which way the wind was blowing, and on June 11, 1605, they 
arrested Fyodor and his mother. Nine days later—as the false Dmitri 
triumphantly rode into Moscow—both Fyodor and his mother were 
murdered.

Lecture 9—Glinka: A Life for the Tsar (1836) 
●
●
This first false Dmitri—who was crowned tsar on June 21, 1605—did 
not last long. A plot against him was engineered by a Russian prince 
just 11 months after Dmitri’s triumphant entrance into Moscow, and he 
was shot dead. 
Continuing Troubles
●
●
Prince Vasily Shiusky, who had organized the assassination of 
the false Dmitri, became the next tsar. He lasted only four years. 
Meanwhile, over the course of the next seven years, two more false 
Dmitris would appear; significant parts of Russia, including Moscow 
and Smolensk, would be occupied by Polish troops; the king of the 
Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Sigismund III, declared himself to 
be tsar; civil wars raged throughout Russia; and a number of other 
tragedies took place.
●
●
Thus, it was nothing short of a national rebirth when Dmitri 
Pozharsky, a Rurikid prince, and Kuzma Minin, a Russian merchant, 
led a volunteer army to liberate Moscow in September 1612. The Polish 
garrison barricaded themselves in the Kremlin. Having been promised 
humane treatment and safe passage to Poland, the starving garrison 
surrendered two months later. The Russians then slaughtered the 
Poles. 
●
●
On February 21, 1613, three months after the slaughter, a National 
Assembly elected the 16-year-old Mikhail Romanov tsar of Russia. It 
then took three days to track Mikhail down. When he was informed 
that he’d been elected tsar, he reportedly burst into tears, no doubt 
aware of the short shelf life of recent Russian autocrats. 
●
●
Mikhail was a gentle and pious man, much beloved by his people. He 
ruled well for 32 years, until his death at age 49 in 1645. His reign saw 
an end to the time of troubles and the dynastic issues that had so 
much to do with them. Romanov tsars ruled for 304 years, until the 
abdication of Nicholas II in 1917.
75

Ivan Susanin
●
●
According to legend, the Romanov dynasty almost didn’t happen. 
Despite the defeat in Moscow, there were still Polish detachments 
in the countryside around Moscow. One of these detachments 
got word that a search was on for the newly elected tsar—Mikhail 
Romanov—who was said to be holed up at the Ipatiev Monastery 
near Kostroma. 
●
●
In the woods near the monastery, a Polish search party encountered 
a logger named Ivan Susanin, who promised to take them to the 
monastery. 
●
●
Deep into the woods they went, and there, they disappeared, never 
to be heard from again. It was assumed that the Poles killed Ivan 
once they discovered that he had no intention of taking them to 
the monastery and that they themselves froze to death trying to 
find their way back out. 
●
●
There is strong evidence that this legend is, in fact, true. In 1619, a 
resident of a village near Kostroma named Bogdan Sobinin was 
given one-half of a village named Derevischi by Tsar Mikhail himself. 
According to the royal charter, the lands were granted as a reward 
for the heroic actions of his father-in-law, Ivan Susanin, for refusing to 
reveal the tsar’s whereabouts to the Poles. 
Glinka and the Cultural Quest for “Russia”
●
●
Mikhail Glinka was born in 1804 to a wealthy, highly cultured, land-
owning family. As a child, he studied piano and violin and received 
a first-rate education, after which he took a position as assistant 
secretary of the Department of Public Highways. 
●
●
In his mid-20s, Glinka decided that he wanted to be a real composer. 
He went to Italy for three years (including a stay at the Milan 
Conservatory), followed by a year of study in Berlin. When he returned 
to St. Petersburg in 1834, he was determined to compose an opera 
that would be recognizably, authentically Russian. 

Lecture 9—Glinka: A Life for the Tsar (1836) 
●
●
On his return to St. Petersburg, Glinka got involved in a high-end salon 
run by the imperial court poet Vasily Andreyevich Zhukovsky, a major 
player at court. When Glinka mentioned that he wanted to write a 
Russian opera, Zhukovsky suggested a subject: Ivan Susanin.
●
●
The story of Ivan resonated with Glinka for two reasons: First, it was 
about Ivan’s unswerving willingness to sacrifice everything for his tsar, 
Mikhail Glinka’s A Life for the 
Tsar was embraced as the first 
great Russian musical work 
and was the first Russian opera 
to be known outside of Russia.
77

who was the embodiment of the Russian state. Second, it was about 
fighting off foreign invaders. 
●
●
A Life for the Tsar received its premiere in St. Petersburg at the Bolshoi 
Theater on November 27, 1836, with the imperial family in attendance. 
It was a triumph—both for Glinka and for Russian art and culture.
A Life for the Tsar
●
●
Glinka’s A Life for the Tsar was considered by his contemporaries to 
be the first real Russian opera for four reasons. 
●
●
First, rather than use Russian folk songs or folk-like music here and 
there to create color, the entire opera breathes with a sensibility of 
Russian song and Polish dance. 
●
●
Second, Glinka created a style of text setting that reflected the 
idiosyncratic sounds and rhythms of the Russian language. 
●
●
Third, in A Life for the Tsar, Glinka created a full-fledged, full-length, 
fully up-to-date, cosmopolitan opera product that is fully sung and 
features orchestrally accompanied recitatives, virtuoso arias, multi-
part ensembles, and blockbuster finales. It is also harmonically 
complex and exploits its orchestra to rich effect. An example is 
provided by a brief aria—an arietta—called “Vanya’s Song.” The 
words of the arietta have a folk-like quality, and it is—melodically and 
harmonically—a fully modern piece of operatic music.
●
●
Finally, A Life for the Tsar resonated perfectly with the propagandistic 
intentions of the tsarist regime. As a nationalist story, it spoke to the 
pride and patriotism of the working and middle classes. The ruling 
class loved it, as well, because A Life for the Tsar reaffirmed the status 
quo: the Russian people’s absolute submission to Russia’s absolute 
autocracy. 

Lecture 9—Glinka: A Life for the Tsar (1836) 
Hammer and Sickle
●
●
Soviet ideologues had a problem with an opera entitled A Life for the 
Tsar, but not as big a problem as we might think. In 1924, an altered 
version of the opera was produced under the title Hammer and Sickle; 
it flopped and was put on the shelf. The opera was again revived in 
1939 with a new libretto.
●
●
An example of this altered, Soviet-era libretto is the famous choral 
“Hymn of the Masses” that concludes the opera. In its original version, 
the first four lines of this hymn (written by Vasily Zhukovsky) are as 
follows:
Glory, glory to thee our Russian Tsar,
Our sovereign given to us by God!
May thy royal line be immortal!
May the Russian people prosper through it!
The new, sanitized Soviet words (written by Sergey Gorodetsky) read:
Glory, glory to thee, O Russia mine!
Glory to thee our Russian land!
May our beloved, our native land
Be strong throughout all ages!
●
●
In 1991, with the demise of the Soviet Union, Glinka’s A Life for the Tsar 
was performed in Russia for the first time in 76 years. The production, 
by the Bolshoi Opera, was a triumph and was filmed for posterity.

Strauss Sr.: Radetzky March (1848)
T
he Viennese self-image is one of empire; untold wealth and power; 
and military strength, tradition, and pomp. Of course, this is all 
nostalgia for an empire long gone. Austria’s capital—Vienna—is, 
today, a wonderful city, but it is no longer the fast-paced, cutting-edge 
metropolis it once was. Vienna is a “museum city,” like Prague, Florence, 
and Venice; one visits Vienna to experience the glories of its past, not 
its present. The story behind Johann Strauss’s Radetzky March is one of 
national pride, military success, and empire in the face of revolution and its 
own obsolescence. The big history behind this lecture is how the events that 
inspired the Radetzky March marked the last gasp of an ancient empire.
The Habsburg Empire
●
●
In 768 C.E., the approximately 25-year-old Charles I was crowned king 
of the Frankish kingdom, a territory that included what today is France 
and much of Germany and Belgium. Within 20 years, Charles I—who 
came to be known as Charlemagne—had added, through conquest, 
most of Italy, Saxony, Bavaria, and Carinthia (in modern Austria) to 
his kingdom. In doing so, Charlemagne managed to unite most of 
Western Europe for the first time since the fall of the Roman Empire, 
roughly 400 years before. 
●
●
On Christmas Day, 800 C.E., Pope Leo III crowned Charles as 
Roman emperor at old St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome. This Holy Roman 
Emperorship remained a hereditary title until 1356, when the so-called 
Golden Bull was issued by the imperial diet—the general assembly—
of the Imperial Estates of the Holy Roman Empire. The Golden Bull 
detailed the process by which the Holy Roman Emperorship would 
subsequently become an elected office.

Charlemagne, the first Holy 
Roman Emperor, was a 
staunch friend of the papacy 
and brought Christianity to 
the lands he conquered.

Music as a Mirror of History
82
●
●
In 1452, the 37-year-old Frederick, archduke of Austria, was elected 
Holy Roman Emperor. His family name was Habsburg. Through savvy 
politics and bribes, the Habsburg clan managed to get themselves 
reelected to the Holy Roman Emperorship almost continuously from 
1452 to 1806, which is when the Holy Roman Empire ceased to exist. 
Thus, for more than 350 years, the Austrian Habsburg emperor was 
also the Holy Roman Emperor. 
●
●
The high-water mark of the Habsburg Empire occurred between 1519 
and 1556, during the reign of Emperor Charles V, the most powerful 
European ruler of his day. 
●
●
From his maternal grandparents—Ferdinand and Isabella—Charles 
had inherited Castile, Aragon, various Italian and Mediterranean 
possessions, and the Spanish colonies in the Americas. 
●
●
From his paternal grandparents, Charles inherited Austria, the 
Netherlands, and the Free County of Burgundy. 
●
●
Add to all this the Holy Roman Empire (Germania), which he 
acquired at the age of 19 when he was elected Holy Roman 
Emperor.
●
●
These were the glory days of the Habsburgs. But time and events 
conspired to shred their territory and reduce their influence. The 
Protestant Reformation, the Wars of Religion, and the Thirty Years’ War 
were such events. Spain ceased to be ruled by the Habsburgs in 1700, 
and Habsburg influence over the German states began its decline with 
the rise of Prussia in the mid-18th century. As we saw in earlier lectures, 
Habsburg Austria was hammered by Napoleon, but ultimately, it was 
able to share the glory when Napoleon was defeated for good in 1815.
The Congress of Vienna
●
●
The Congress of Vienna was a conference held in Vienna between 
September 1814 and June 1815. Chaired by the Austrian foreign 
minister Klemens von Metternich, the purpose of the Congress was 
to break up Napoleon’s empire and distribute it among the victorious 

Lecture 10—Strauss Sr.: Radetzky March (1848) 
powers in such a way as to create a balance of power that would 
ensure European peace. 
●
●
The congress also had another mission: to stamp out the liberalism, 
populism, and republicanism that had led to the French Revolution 
and Bonapartism. For all its good intentions regarding peace, the 
Congress was reactionary, and in trying to turn back the clock, it 
doomed the 19th century to an endless series of revolutionary conflicts 
and the 20th century to world war.
●
●
One modern diplomat who would disagree with that statement is 
Henry Kissinger; his doctoral dissertation, entitled A World Restored 
and written in 1954, claims that the congress prevented another pan-
European war for 100 years, until 1914. 
●
●
We might argue, however, that that war lasted for 77 years—until 
the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991—and included World War 
I, the Russian Revolution and civil war, the catastrophe that was 
Bolshevism, World War II, the Chinese Revolution, the Cold War, the 
Korean War, the Vietnam War, and many other conflicts. 
●
●
We might further argue that that 77 years of war might never 
have occurred had national aspirations and logical borders been 
recognized by the men who redrew Europe’s borders in 1815. But 
the only things they had learned from the American and French 
revolutions was that liberalism, republicanism, and populism had 
to be nipped in the bud and that repression was a government’s 
best tool. 
●
●
As it turned out, however, the desire for national self-determination 
cannot be beaten out of populations, no matter how repressive the 
government. A case in point is the Austrian Empire.
●
●
At the time of the Congress of Vienna, the Austrian emperor was 
Francis I. As a ruling monarch who had witnessed the French 
Revolution and had suffered repeated military humiliation at the hands 
of the French, Francis came to despise political populism. In this, he 
was joined by Klemens von Metternich, who became chancellor of 
Austria in 1821 and, thus, the head of the Austrian government. 
83

Music as a Mirror of History
84
●
●
Along with the constant demand of balancing Austrian strategy and 
policy with those of the other Great Powers—France, Britain, Prussia, 
Russia, and the Ottoman Empire—Metternich’s greatest concern was 
dealing with the never-ending issues of national identity in the empire.
●
●
In a letter dated January 26, 1830, Metternich presciently wrote: “When 
Paris sneezes, Europe catches cold.” Six months later, Paris sneezed 
when, during the July Revolution, King Charles X was deposed and 
replaced by his more liberal cousin, Louis-Philippe, duke of Orléans. 
●
●
In 1830, Europe—in particular, the Austrian Habsburg Empire—caught 
a cold: Rumblings in Hungary were followed by outright rebellions in 
Belgium, Poland, and Austrian-occupied northern Italy. The rumblings 
were silenced, and the rebellions were smashed, but the nationalist 
impulses behind them simmered just below the boiling point.
The Year of Revolution: 1848
●
●
Politically, the July Revolution of 1830 had come to nothing. The new 
king, Louis-Philippe, had begun his reign as a liberal but had become 
increasingly autocratic as time went on. By 1848, political meetings 
had been banned, press censorship was back, only 1 in every 30 
French males had the right to vote, and a serious economic downturn 
that began in 1846 showed no signs of letting up. 
●
●
On February 21, 1848, as a way of circumventing the proscription 
against public meetings, a great banquet had been planned in Paris 
by the opposition. Such banquets were banned by King Louis-Philippe 
on February 21.
●
●
The next day, the Parisian working class, helped by students and petty 
bourgeoisie, pulled up Paris’s paving stones and once again barricaded 
the streets. Troops shot into crowds that then became rioting mobs. 
●
●
Anarchy reigned for three days. On February 24, the 74-year-old 
King Louis-Philippe abdicated and snuck out of Paris in disguise. On 

Lecture 10—Strauss Sr.: Radetzky March (1848) 
February 26, the French Second Republic was declared. This Second 
Republic would last for only three years, but no one knew that at the 
time. Word of this most recent French revolutionary “sneeze” spread 
throughout Europe. 
●
●
The infection first struck the Austrian Empire in Hungary. On March 3, 
1848, inspired by the events in Paris, the Hungarian nationalist radical 
Lajos (or Louis) Kossuth gave an impassioned speech on the virtues 
of liberty and called for a constitution. 
●
●
The speech was translated into German and immediately sent to 
Vienna. There, on March 13, 1848, working people and students 
pulled up paving stones and barricaded the streets. Troops from 
the city garrison fired on the crowds, which fought back and 
stormed the imperial palace. Terrified, Klemens von Metternich fled 
Vienna. 
●
●
The Habsburg Empire fell to pieces along national lines. Hungary 
and Bohemia demanded—and were promised—constitutional 
separatism from Vienna. The duchy of Milan drove out its Austrian 
garrison, and Tuscany and Venice each declared themselves 
independent republics. Troops from all over Italy streamed north, 
intent on removing the Austrians from Italy for good. 
●
●
Every one of these uprisings was destroyed within 18 months. 
●
●
The first insurrection to be broken was the one in Bohemia. In 
June 1848, troops under the command of Austrian General Alfred 
Candidus Ferdinand bombarded and marched into Prague. The 
revolutionaries were no match for professional soldiers.
●
●
The campaign in northern Italy was entrusted to the 82-year-
old field marshal Joseph Wenzel, Count Radetzky von Radetz. 
Radetzky faced a full-blown national war of independence, but he 
led a brilliant campaign. The campaign ended on August 30, 1849, 
when Radetzky made his triumphal entry into the just-defeated 
city of Venice. 
●
●
In Radetzky, the conservative elements of the Austrian Empire 
had a genuine hero. His death in 1858 at the age of 91 provoked an 
outpouring of grief throughout the empire. But for all his exploits, 
85

86
honors, titles, and memorials, we remember him because of Johann 
Strauss Sr.’s Radetzky March.
Johann Strauss Sr.
●
●
Johann Strauss Sr. was born in Vienna in 1804. An apprentice 
bookbinder, he pursued his true passion—practicing the violin—at 
night. But Strauss’s bookbinding career went on permanent hold 
once he began playing in local dance bands. Along the way, he began 
writing his own dances, organized his own orchestra, starting touring, 
and made himself famous.
●
●
In July 1825, the 21-year-old Strauss married the 23-year-old Maria 
Anna Streim. Three months later, on October 25, Maria Anna gave 
birth to a son, who was named after his father. By 1844, it had become 
clear that the 19-year-old Strauss Jr. would outstrip his father as a 
composer. 
●
●
The ugliness between Strauss father and son came to a head in 1848. 
Johann Jr. and his brothers were in complete sympathy with the 
revolutionaries. Johann Jr. was even appointed first conductor of the 
newly created revolutionary National Guard Orchestra. Johann Jr. 
composed music for the orchestra, as well, including “Revolutionary 
March,” “Songs of Freedom,” and “Songs of the Barracks.”
●
●
For his part, Johann Sr. was utterly disgusted with his son’s politics. 
He was of the older generation: a man of the status quo, a political 
conservative, and an entertainment industry big shot whose 
lightweight dance music required quiet, happy times to be consumed 
and enjoyed.
●
●
Nevertheless, 1848 was a year of inspiration for Strauss Sr., as well, 
though it wasn’t the revolution that inspired him but, rather, Austria’s 
military success on the antirevolutionary battlefield. 

Lecture 10—Strauss Sr.: Radetzky March (1848) 
Although he was a virtuoso 
violinist himself, Johann 
Strauss Sr. forbade any of 
his three sons from studying 
music; nevertheless, they all 
became professional musicians. 
87

●
●
On July 24 and 25 of 1848, imperial Habsburg troops led by Count 
Radetzky routed the Italian forces at Custoza in north-central Italy. 
To mark this decisive victory, the imperial government produced—on 
August 31—a victory festival. 
●
●
Strauss Sr. was commissioned to compose a new work for the 
celebration, and he obliged with the Radetzky March. Reputed to have 
been composed in just two hours, the march incorporates a popular 
Viennese folk song entitled “The Old Dance of Vienna.” The folk tune 
is a waltz, set—by definition—in triple meter.
●
●
This tune—compressed to duple, or march, meter—became the 
central B section of Strauss’s march.
●
●
The inclusion of a tune that was then popular with the soldiers of 
the imperial Habsburg army was calculated to make the march 
instantly memorable, which it did. 
●
●
The politics of 1848 was the last straw for the relationship between 
Strauss Sr. and Jr. The elder Strauss died of scarlet fever on September 
25, 1849, at the age of 45. 
●
●
Meanwhile, the problems in Vienna didn’t end until October 1848, 
when the army was finally called in to remove the revolutionaries 
permanently. Scores were arrested, and those deemed to be the 
leaders were shot. 
●
●
More a celebration than a march, the Radetzky March has lost its 
political and military connotations. But the march is still a work of its 
time: a time when the proud and ancient Habsburg Empire managed its 
last great imperial gasp before its downward slide to extinction in 1918.

T
his lecture is about two very different men brought together 
by a revolution. The two men are Johannes Brahms and Eduard 
Reményi. Both were world-class musicians, though their careers 
could not have been more different. Brahms spent the bulk of his career as 
a Vienna-based composer, while Reményi was an itinerant violin virtuoso. 
The revolution that brought them together took place in Hungary in 1848 
and 1849. The story behind this lecture is just how this revolution brought 
Brahms and Reményi together and the life-changing, career-making 
impact their meeting had on Brahms.
The Kingdom of Hungary
●
●
Between its creation in 1000 C.E. and its dismemberment in 1920 
following World War I, the Kingdom of Hungary grew to become a 
large, multi-ethnic Central European state, consisting of territories that 
today are part of Hungary, Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, 
Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Ukraine.
●
●
The golden age of the Kingdom of Hungary existed between 1458 
and 1490, during the reign of King Matthias Corvinus. What made 
Matthias’s reign golden was that, through astute diplomacy and 
occasional military action, he managed to keep his kingdom’s more 
predatory neighbors at bay: the Holy Roman Empire to the west and 
the Ottoman Empire to the south.
●
●
Matthias died in 1490 without leaving an heir. After his death, power 
struggles between Hungary’s elite weakened the kingdom. In 1526, 
an Ottoman army under the command of Suleiman invaded Hungary. 
Lecture

90
On August 26, 1526, Suleiman’s army met the Hungarian army at the 
Battle of Mohács in what today is southern Hungary. The Hungarians 
were routed, and their army was destroyed. 
●
●
The Battle of Mohács marked a turning point not just for Hungary 
but also for Europe. The Kingdom of Hungary ceased to be an 
independent entity and was broken into three pieces. 
●
●
In the north and west, the remaining Hungarian nobles accepted 
the rule of an Austrian Habsburg emperor named Ferdinand I. The 
southern area became Ottoman Hungary, while the far eastern edge 
became an Ottoman satellite called the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom. 
●
●
For the next 150 years, the territories of the former Hungarian 
kingdom were a perpetual battlefield, the blood lands where two 
great empires and their religions—the Christian Habsburgs and the 
Muslim Ottomans—fought it out in nearly constant warfare. 
●
●
The tide turned in 1683, when the Ottoman invasion of Austria got to 
the walls of Vienna but no further. Sixteen years later—in 1699—the 
Ottomans signed the Treaty of Karlowitz, relinquishing any claims to 
Hungarian lands to the victorious Austrian Habsburgs. 
●
●
Austria immediately became the “big dog” in the Hungarian 
neighborhood. And having spilled no small amount of Habsburg 
blood and fortune to liberate Hungary, Austria was not inclined to turn 
the rule of Hungary back over to the Hungarians. 
●
●
Thus began a long and tendentious relationship between the 
Hungarians and their Austrian overlords. In 1791, Hungary was declared 
by Austria to be—“technically”—a separate country, with its own diet 
and a king crowned according to Hungarian law. The hitch was that 
the Hungarian king also happened to be the Austrian emperor and 
that only the king could call a meeting of the Hungarian diet. 
●
●
The defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1815 triggered an increasing 
radicalization of the Hungarian lesser nobility, the merchant class, and 
the intelligentsia. These people did not want to see a return to the 

Lecture 11—Brahms: Piano Quartet in G Minor, Op. 25 (1861)  
91
oppressive, pre-Napoleonic, Austrian-run status quo. The Hungarians, 
like many vassal people across the continent, wanted autonomy. 
●
●
In 1825, the degree of unrest in Hungary was such that the Habsburg 
emperor, Francis, called a meeting of the Hungarian diet—the first 
such meeting in 14 years—in order to allow the Hungarians to blow off 
some steam. That, however, was a miscalculation.
●
●
Calls for reform echoed through the chamber. Demands were 
made that Austria remove itself from Hungary’s national affairs and 
economy. Proposals were put forth for the creation of a Hungarian 
national academy of arts and sciences, the abolition of serfdom, the 
establishment of a Hungarian national bank, and more.
●
●
The high Hungarian nobility were unhappy with these demands, 
largely because their wealth and influence were dependent on the 
Austrians. Thus, along with a confrontation with Austria, the potential 
for class warfare in Hungary grew dangerously in the early 1830s.
Lajos Kossuth
●
●
Around this time, a charismatic figure, Lajos Kossuth, emerged 
in Hungary. For the magnates inside Hungary and the Hapsburg 
establishment, Kossuth was the son of Satan. Almost everyone else, 
however, recognized him as the George Washington of the nascent 
Hungarian nation. 
●
●
Kossuth was born in 1802 in Monok, in the northeastern corner of 
modern Hungary. He was the eldest of four children in a family of the 
lower nobility. He died in exile in 1894 in the northern Italian city of Turin. 
●
●
The son of a lawyer, Kossuth studied law and joined his father’s legal 
practice at the age of 19. In 1825, at age 23, he was appointed a deputy 
to the Hungarian diet when it was convened by the Austrian emperor 
Francis. Kossuth’s job was to write accounts of the happenings at the 
diet, intended only for the eyes of a few magnates. 

Music as a Mirror of History
92
●
●
Owing to their quality, however, Kossuth’s accounts leaked out; they 
were circulated by hand until Kossuth—emboldened by the public 
response—began to publish a “parliamentary gazette”—a newsletter. 
The Austrian censor shut it down. Kossuth, his bully pulpit growing 
by the day, demanded that freedom of the press and of speech be 
legalized, not just in Hungary but everywhere in the Habsburg Empire.
●
●
In May 1837, Kossuth was arrested, charged with high treason, and 
thrown into jail, where he spent the next three years. With this act, the 
Austrians created a martyr to the Hungarian national cause, and on 
his release from jail, Kossuth became a national hero. The government 
had no choice but to grant him a license to publish a newspaper, 
which became fantastically popular. Kossuth advocated for a liberal 
nationalist state in which Hungarian was the official language; he 
advocated for property rights and demanded economic and tax 
reform; and he broached the subject of Hungarian independence.
●
●
In 1844, the government had had enough. Kossuth was fired from his 
own newspaper. But in the fall of 1847, he was elected to the newly 
called diet as a representative for Pest, the Hungarian capital city. 
●
●
A few months later—in February of 1848—the Parisians removed King 
Louis-Philippe and declared France a republic. On March 3, 1848, 
Kossuth mounted the rostrum at the diet and gave the speech of his 
lifetime, demanding a true parliamentary government for Hungary 
and constitutional government throughout the Habsburg Empire. He 
instantly became the rallying figure for revolution across Europe. 
Revolution in Hungary
●
●
A new government was declared in Hungary, with Kossuth appointed 
as minister of finance. But within a few months, it became clear that 
the revolution was not over. The Austrian military was intact, and 
Hungary would have to fight for its freedom. On July 11, the new 
Hungarian government issued a call to arms and quickly raised an 
army of 200,000 men. 

Lecture 11—Brahms: Piano Quartet in G Minor, Op. 25 (1861)  
93
●
●
In the end, it wasn’t enough. No country in Western Europe was willing 
to intervene on Hungary’s behalf, while Russia came to Austria’s aid. 
The end came when the Hungarian army—under the command of 
General Artúr Görgey—surrendered to the Russians, who promptly 
turned the Hungarian prisoners over to the Austrians. At Russia’s 
insistence, General Görgey was spared, but 13 Hungarian generals 
were hanged by the Austrians as criminals on October 6, 1849. 
●
●
Thousands of Hungarian refugees—military officers, lesser nobles, 
writers, journalists, politicians, artists, and intellectuals—fled to points 
west. Among them was Lajos Kossuth. After a period of time in 
England, Kossuth arrived in New York on December 5, 1852, where he 
was welcomed as a hero. 
On his arrival in 
America, Lajos 
Kossuth was praised 
by Abraham Lincoln 
as the “most worthy 
and distinguished 
representative of the 
cause of civil and 
religious liberty on the 
continent of Europe.”

●
●
Among the many who fled Hungary in 1849 was a 21-year-old violinist 
whose birth name was Eduard Hoffmann. 
●
●
He had been born in 1828 to a Jewish family in northeastern 
Hungary. He studied at the Vienna Conservatory from 1842 to 
1845. On returning home, he got involved in nationalist politics and 
renamed himself Eduard Reményi. 
●
●
Already famous as a violinist, Reményi joined the revolutionary 
Hungarian army in 1848 and became an aide-de-camp to General 
Görgey. After the surrender, with a price on his head, Reményi 
fled Hungary.
Brahms and Reményi
●
●
In August of 1850, the 17-year-old Johannes Brahms, who knew 
Reményi by reputation, met him in Hamburg when he accompanied 
the violinist at a private concert in the home of a local merchant.
●
●
Brahms then continued to perform with Reményi and, through him, 
became involved with the Hungarian expatriate community. But 
most importantly, it was thanks to Reményi that Brahms heard and 
performed the songs and dances that made up the alla zingarese—
“in the gypsy style”—repertoire. Thus began a love affair with the 
“Hungarian style” that Brahms maintained to his dying day.
●
●
An example of Brahms’s Hungarian style is found in the fourth 
movement of his Piano Quartet in G Minor of 1861, completed when he 
was 28 years old. Brahms labeled the movement rondo alla zingarese 
(“rondo in the gypsy style”). It consists of a series of gypsy-styled 
dance tunes (all of Brahms’s invention) that range in mood from the 
incredibly energized to the droopingly mawkish. 
●
●
In early 1851, word got out that a warrant had been issued for 
Reményi’s arrest. He went to the United States and stayed in New York 
for about six months before returning to Hamburg. There, Brahms and 
Reményi reunited, concertized together, and decided to go on tour. 

Lecture 11—Brahms: Piano Quartet in G Minor, Op. 25 (1861)  
95
At age 17, Johannes Brahms, an 
upright, Lutheran, north-German 
native of Hamburg, was floored by 
the exotic, rhythmically exciting 
gypsy-style music he discovered 
through Eduard Reményi.

Music as a Mirror of History
96
The Tour
●
●
The two made an odd couple when they left Hamburg in April of 
1853. Brahms, not yet 20 years old, was tiny and slim, quiet, shy, and 
unassuming. Reményi, at 23, was full of bluster—a loud, egocentric 
huckster, always playing the role of the great virtuoso. 
●
●
In late May, Brahms and Reményi arrived in Hanover, where they met 
with Reményi’s classmate, Joseph Joachim. Although Joachim was 
not quite 22 years old, he had been a staple on the European concert 
scene for 10 years. When he heard Brahms play his own compositions, 
he was “completely overwhelmed.”
●
●
As a favor to Reményi, Joachim provided a letter of introduction to 
the great man of Hungarian music, Franz Liszt, who was living and 
working in the German city of Weimar. Privately, Joachim told Brahms 
that should things not work out with Reményi, he—Brahms—was 
always welcome to come back.
●
●
In fact, things didn’t work out between Brahms and Reményi. When 
the mismatched pair arrived in Weimar, they were greeted warmly 
by Liszt, but Brahms was completely miserable. He was out of his 
league with Liszt and his friends and probably bad-mouthed Liszt to 
Reményi. In June 1853, Brahms and Reményi parted ways. 
●
●
Brahms returned to Joachim, who arranged an introduction to 
Robert and Clara Schumann. In October 1853, six months after 
Brahms had left Hamburg, Robert Schumann published an article 
declaring that Johannes Brahms was the messiah of German music. 
The 20-year-old Brahms suddenly became famous, and he would 
stay that way until his death in 1897. Reményi lived for another 45 
years, dying in 1898. And although he was quite famous in his time, 
Reményi is remembered today only because of his association with 
Brahms. 
●
●
Reményi later claimed that he and Brahms had parted as friends and 
remained so, but in fact, they never met or communicated again. 

Lecture 11—Brahms: Piano Quartet in G Minor, Op. 25 (1861)  
97
Reményi invented a number of stories after Brahms had become 
an international music star, basking in Brahms’s reflected glory and 
taking credit for things he had no right to take credit for. 
●
●
Given his avowed “love” for Brahms, Reményi was often asked why he 
himself never performed Brahms’s Hungarian Dances, of which no. 5 is 
the most famous. Reményi claimed that Brahms had stolen the tunes 
from him, and he could not, therefore, in good conscience, perform 
the works.
●
●
The meeting of Brahms and Reményi and their subsequent 
relationship all took place because of a revolution in Hungary, which 
occurred in response to a revolution in Paris, which occurred because 
of a 1,001 other events that we can now, in hindsight, describe but 
could never have predicted.

Gottschalk: The Union (1862)
T
he cultural gifts America has given the world are quite 
extraordinary, and nowhere is this truer than in the realm of music. 
A list of American-born musical genres would have to include 
spirituals, zydeco, bluegrass, and many more. What all these genres have 
in common and what makes them American is that they are syncretic: 
syntheses of diverse musical elements into wholes many times greater 
than their parts. Of greatest import to American music is the synthesis 
of West African and European musical traditions in North America, a 
synthesis that created a vast array of uniquely American genres, from 
gospel and soul, to ragtime and blues, to jazz and rock ‘n’ roll. 
Bamboula
●
●
As an example of the West African influence on American music, 
consider the opening of a piano piece called Bamboula, composed in 
1845 by Louis Moreau Gottschalk. A bamboula is both a drum made 
by stretching a skin over a large cross-section of bamboo and a dance 
accompanied by such drums. 
●
●
Gottschalk uses the piano like a drum, and the music is syncopated, 
meaning that accents are heard not just on beats but in between 
beats. These sorts of West African–derived syncopations would later 
define the genre of piano music called ragtime. 
●
●
Note that in this music, West African–styled melodic and rhythmic 
elements are set to European harmonies and played on a European 
instrument. This is music that could only have been created in the 
melting pot of North America.

New Orleans
●
●
From the moment it was founded in 1718, New Orleans has been 
one of North America’s most important port cities. By 1840, it was 
the wealthiest and the third most populous city in the United States, 
behind only New York City and Baltimore, Maryland. 
●
●
New Orleans was also the destination for some two-thirds of the 
slaves brought to North America. Paradoxically, by 1860, the city 
also had 13,000 free people of color, that is, mixed-race people who 
99

Music as a Mirror of History
100
were classified as being mulatto. Mostly French speaking, these free 
mulattoes made up the artisan, educated, and professional classes of 
African Americans in New Orleans. 
●
●
Economically and culturally, the 40 years between 1820 and 1860 
were the glory years of New Orleans. Culturally, New Orleans was a 
mélange of languages and traditions: European, Caribbean, Latin 
American, and African. The big history behind this lecture is how a 
composer raised in this cultural mish-mosh went on to become the 
first truly American composer, one who created a syncretic body of 
music that is equally European, African, Caribbean, and Hispanic.
Louis Moreau Gottschalk
●
●
Louis Moreau Gottschalk was born in New Orleans on May 8, 1829. His 
father, Edward Gottschalk, was a London-born Jewish businessman. 
His mother, Aimée Bruslé Gottschalk, was a Catholic creole, that is, a 
person of French descent born in Louisiana. She was just 16 years old 
when Moreau (as her son was called) was born.
●
●
The most important adults in Moreau’s childhood were not his parents 
but, rather, his maternal grandmother, Josephine-Alix Bruslé, and 
his nurse, a slave named Sally who was about 46 years old when 
Moreau was born. Both his grandmother and Sally had been born in 
Saint-Domingue, the French colony today known as Haiti. They both 
survived the slave rebellion of 1793, though Moreau’s grandmother’s 
family was not so lucky. 
●
●
These two elderly women were Moreau’s link with his family’s past. 
Together, they filled his ears with creole lullabies and songs, with 
legends and stories of Saint-Domingue, with the lore of south Louisiana 
and the horrific slave revolt that they had miraculously escaped. 
●
●
Moreau’s father, Edward, made his living speculating in real estate, 
commodities, and slaves. Later in life, Moreau wrote that slavery was 
“the greatest inequity which the age of barbarity bequeathed us.”

Lecture 12—Gottschalk: The Union (1862) 
●
●
Moreau himself was fascinated by black music and culture. He began 
playing the piano at around age 5, and by the time he was 7, he was 
considered a child prodigy. As a composer of genius, Moreau did not 
imitate African American music. Instead, he absorbed its content and 
spirit and made the music his own. 
Music in New Orleans
●
●
There were three essential public venues for music in Gottschalk’s 
New Orleans: theaters (meaning opera houses, concert halls, and 
standard theaters), ballrooms and dance halls, and the streets.
●
●
In the decades before the Civil War, New Orleans was the opera 
capital of North America. In the 1830s, it had two permanent opera 
houses before any other city in the United States had even one. 
●
●
Among the most popular music played in ballrooms were orchestral 
arrangements of opera music. Given Gottschalk’s exposure to opera 
and operatic arrangements, it should come as no surprise that he 
composed 31 fantasies for piano on themes from operas by Verdi, 
Rossini, Donizetti, Bellini, Wagner, and others. 
●
●
New Orleans also had a large number of so-called street-corner 
virtuosos—both schooled and unschooled musicians—who performed 
for small change. 
●
●
Gottschalk would have heard the banjo played everywhere in New 
Orleans. His piano piece The Banjo, composed in 1853, features 
numerous advanced banjo techniques, suggesting that it might 
represent the playing of a specific but unknown African American 
banjo player. 
●
●
The multiracial, multicultural family and city in which Gottschalk 
grew up shaped his artistic spirit. Thus, when the nearly 13-year-old 
Gottschalk traveled to Paris to complete his musical education, he 
carried with him a unique set of musical and cultural experiences. 
101

102
Gottschalk’s Return to the United States
●
●
Gottschalk returned to the United States from Europe in 1853. Generally 
considered to be among the greatest living pianists, he had played 
before hysterical crowds and was feted by royalty across Europe. 
●
●
But the United States that Gottschalk returned to was a different place 
than the one he had left behind. Industrialization, westward expansion, 
and immigration had brought greater wealth and population to the 
nation. Virtually every town in America had a concert hall, opera 
house, or auditorium in which traveling musicians and troupes could 
perform. Railroads, canals, and steamships also allowed “gypsies” to 
perform as they moved from town to town.
●
●
This became Gottschalk’s performing environment for the next eight 
years, punctuated by tours to Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Central and 
South America. By 1861, Gottschalk had established himself as the 
preeminent pianist living and working in the Western Hemisphere.
●
●
Gottschalk was in Havana, Cuba, when the American Civil War broke 
out in April 1861. As a born Southerner, he was required to swear 
allegiance to the government of the United States and declare that he 
was “not in rebellion.” Having done so, he was allowed to return to the 
North, where he began his wartime career.
●
●
He arrived in New York in February 1862 and immediately set to work 
on what would become his single most popular work: a virtuosic 
medley of patriotic American tunes called The Union Concert 
Paraphrase, or simply The Union. 
The Union
●
●
The Union was premiered on Washington’s birthday in 1862, at New 
York’s Academy of Music on a stage draped with American flags. The 
piece, which was dedicated to the commander of the Army of the 
Potomac, George B. McClellan, was received rapturously. What the 
audience heard was a mélange, consisting of some original music

War in a manner that

sprinkled with quotations from “Hail Columbia,” “Yankee Doodle,” and 
“The Star-Spangled Banner.”
●
●
The second half of Gottschalk’s The Union begins with a lyric and 
tramping version of “Hail Columbia,” then swings into a bit of “Yankee 
Doodle” played simultaneously with “Hail Columbia,” followed by the 
climactic “Yankee Doodle”–driven conclusion.
●
●
Musically, The Union is a melodramatic potboiler. Nevertheless, it 
helped to inspire the nation at a time of warfare, and it was the most 
important piece of artistic propaganda to emerge from the Northern 
side during the war.
●
●
With The Union in hand, Gottschalk toured virtually non-stop for three 
years. The number of concerts he gave and the number of miles he 
traveled were prodigious. In the first year alone, Gottschalk logged 
some 95,000 miles. 
●
●
Over and over again, Gottschalk witnessed scenes of war: He saw 
trains filled with the wounded and weeping parents waiting at stations 
for the bodies of their sons; he was in New York in July 1863 when the 
Draft Riot broke out; he was in Chicago in December 1863 when he 
witnessed the first African American soldiers being mustered for duty. 
On platforms everywhere, he saw conscripts saying goodbye to their 
parents, wives, and children. 
●
●
On March 24, 1864, Gottschalk performed for President and Mrs. 
Lincoln, and two nights later, General Ulysses Grant and his staff 
attended a Gottschalk performance. Like almost every wartime 
concert, this one concluded with a performance of The Union.
●
●
Without doubt, Gottschalk was a true patriot. A great many of his 
concerts were performed as benefits for wounded soldiers. The 
concerts brought money to veterans and joy (and solace) to literally 
hundreds of thousands of people, whose fathers, sons, and husbands 

Lecture 12—Gottschalk: The Union (1862) 
were at war. Never before had a performing artist managed to touch 
so many Americans. 
Scandal, Exile, and Death 
●
●
On April 27, 1865—18 days after Robert E. Lee’s surrender at 
Appomattox—Gottschalk arrived in San Francisco for what was to 
be a five-month California tour. Unfortunately, the tour did not end 
happily. Accused of having “compromised the honor” of a young lady, 
Gottschalk fled the Bay Area. He died in Rio de Janeiro four years 
later, never returning to the United States.
●
●
Gottschalk’s death did not bring an end to the critical wasp’s nest 
he had stirred up in life. His French roots and Romantic musical 
inclinations—as well as the circumstances surrounding his departure 
from San Francisco—opened him up to scathing criticism from the 
German-oriented musical establishments in New York and Boston. 
A postmortem article in The New York World excoriated him for 
composing nothing but “all sorts of dainty and effeminate caprices” 
and concluded that both Gottschalk and his music were immoral.
●
●
In truth, it wasn’t Gottschalk’s morality (or lack thereof) that his 
critics attacked. Instead, his critics loathed Gottschalk for the very 
reasons we adore him: for his inclusivity, his musical pluralism, and 
his democratization of musical materials—in other words, for his 
Americanness, his willingness to synthesize what was considered 
by many to be gutter music with the compositional techniques and 
pianistic virtuosity of Western Europe. 
●
●
Gottschalk was far ahead of his time. At a time when America 
was perceived as the land of economic opportunity but cultural 
barbarity, when native-born composers did all they could to sound 
like Germans, Gottschalk’s populist, New Orleans–inspired syncretic 
music stood too far apart from what was then the American musical 
mainstream. It wasn’t until the mid-1920s that the public finally began 
to understand that to be American meant embracing something of 
105

Music as a Mirror of History
106
the energy, eclecticism, and plurality that are collectively the essence 
of the American experience. 
●
●
Gottschalk’s exile from America ended in September of 1870, some 
10 months after his death. That’s when his body was placed aboard 
the steamer Merrimack for his journey back to the United States and 
burial in New York. The reason he wasn’t buried in New Orleans was 
that he had sided with, and fought tirelessly for, the North, raising 
tremendous amounts of money for Northern war charities. 
●
●
Gottschalk’s gravesite was impressive. Surrounded by a cast-iron 
railing decorated with lyres stood a five-foot-tall marble angel on a 
marble pedestal, holding a book inscribed with the titles of six of his 
best-known works. At her feet lay a marble lyre with its strings broken. 
In front of the pedestal was a marble tablet on which was carved: “L. 
M. Gottschalk—Morte.”
●
●
As time passed, Gottschalk was forgotten, and his gravesite became 
a ruin. Vandals smashed the statue, the fence disintegrated, and his 
name eroded and disappeared: a perfect metaphor for Gottschalk’s 
music. Fortunately, not only is Gottschalk’s music once again being 
played, but in October of 2012, the fence around his grave was 
replaced and a new statue, named the Angel of Music, was unveiled 
atop the marble pedestal.

Verdi: Nabucco (1842)
I
n this lecture, we’ll see how Giuseppe Verdi’s operas—which were 
often about throwing off the yoke of oppression—became a rallying 
point for the Italian people. Verdi himself—a tough, uncompromising, 
independent, straight talker—offered Italians a masculine, creative, no-
nonsense image that jibed perfectly with the national aspirations of the 
time. The big history behind this lecture is how Verdi almost inadvertently 
became the embodiment of the Italian Risorgimento: the Italian rebirth, 
the Italian quest for nationhood. 
The Call to Verdi
●
●
In early January 1861, Giuseppe Verdi—at 48 years old, the world’s 
most famous composer of Italian-language operas—received a letter 
from Camillo Benso, count of Cavour. Count Cavour was about to 
become the first prime minister of a (nearly) united Italy, and he 
desperately needed Verdi to be part of the new Italian government.
●
●
Cavour was the founding father of his nation. At the time he wrote 
to Verdi, he was 50 years old and laboring mightily to create a 
parliamentary government that would unite the newly declared 
state of Italy. Cavour understood that this new government would 
have to be popular in every sense if it was going to be considered 
as legitimate, both at home and abroad. And that is why he reached 
out to Verdi—because the only man more beloved in Italy than Count 
Cavour was Giuseppe Verdi.
●
●
Verdi—taciturn in demeanor, direct, and easily irritated—wanted nothing 
to do with parliamentary politics. But because he was a patriot, he 
allowed his name to be put in nomination. Verdi carried his district with 
Lecture 
13

108
62.2 percent of the vote. Having spent the bulk of his adulthood trying 
to figure out how to get out of the opera business, Verdi now despaired 
at the thought of having to serve in parliament. He told everyone who’d 
listen that he planned to resign after just a few months. 
●
●
On February 18, 1861, Giuseppe Verdi was sworn in to the first 
Italian parliament by Vittorio Emanuele II himself. Despite his 
avowed reticence, Verdi turned out to be a regular and enthusiastic 
parliamentarian. On March 14, he participated in the vote to give 
Vittorio Emanuele the title of king. On March 27, he voted with the 
majority to declare Rome the capital of Italy.
The Risorgimento
●
●
Risorgimento is the name given to the social and political movement 
that saw the consolidation of the various states on the Italian peninsula 
into a unified nation. This unification of Italy did not happen quickly; 
it took 56 years, from the end of the Napoleonic era in 1815 until 1871, 
when Rome finally became the capital of the Kingdom of Italy. 
●
●
As background information, when the Western Roman Empire fell in 
the 5th century C.E., the Italian peninsula was occupied by an Eastern-
Germanic people called the Ostrogoths. Starting in the 6th century, 
the peninsula became a frontier battleground between the Lombards 
and the Byzantine Empire, the predominantly Greek-speaking eastern 
remnant of the Roman Empire.
●
●
By 1500, the Italian peninsula was divided into a series of city-states, 
some of which were independent and some of which were occupied 
by larger, more powerful nation-states, most notably, the Austrian 
Empire and France. Great Italian writers and thinkers bemoaned this 
foreign domination.
●
●
In 1796, a French army under the command of Napoleon Bonaparte 
invaded Italy in order to root the Austrians out of what today is 
northern Italy before marching on Vienna. 

Lecture 13—Verdi: Nabucco (1842) 
●
●
Before heading to Vienna, Napoleon and his army took a stroll 
down the Italian peninsula. The objective was to extort money and 
art from the Italian principalities and send the loot home to the 
cash-strapped French government. Napoleon got as far south as 
the Kingdom of Naples. In just 30 days, almost without firing a 
shot, the French had established control over most of Italy.
●
●
The French occupiers also set up republican governments across 
Italy. These governments promoted the legal and moral rights of 
the common people over those of the traditional aristocracy. 
●
●
When Napoleon was finally defeated and exiled in 1815, the Congress 
of Vienna redrew the map of Europe, intent on restoring the 
prerevolutionary status quo. But the clock could not be turned back—
not in France, the Holy Roman Empire, or Italy.

the 
1830s, 
four

leaders 
emerged, around whom

Italy versus Austria
●
●
The Italian insurrections—primarily against the Austrians—began in 
the 1820s, with absolutely no success. Pope Gregory XVI, interested in 
protecting the Papal States, invited the Austrians to come in and put 
down the revolts. The Austrians were only too happy to comply; they 
marched down the peninsula, crushing insurrections and arresting 
radicals as they went.
●
●
The insurrections of 1848 and 1849 were much more difficult to put 
down, and they have collectively come to be known as the First Italian 
War of Independence. Once again, it was an Austrian army that swept 
the rebellious Italians from the field. 
Vittorio Emanuel, king of 
Piedmont-Sardinia, became the 
king of Italy when his prime 
minister, Camillo Cavour, 
engineered Italy’s unification.

Lecture 13—Verdi: Nabucco (1842) 
●
●
The Second Italian War of Independence, fought in 1859, helped the 
Italian nationalists make progress. The war itself occurred as the result 
of a strange string of events. Essentially, France, in cahoots with Count 
Cavour and the Kingdom of Sardinia, baited the Austrians into a war. 
The decisive battle took place on June 24, 1859, at Solferino, during 
which the French and Sardinians were victorious. 
●
●
For their victory, the French received the Kingdom of Savoy, the 
city of Nice, and the region around Nice. But the big winner was the 
Kingdom of Sardinia, which annexed all of north-central Italy: the 
regions of Lombardy, Parma, Modena, Romagna, and Tuscany.
●
●
At the same time, Cavour’s ally Garibaldi turned his attention to 
southern Italy and Sicily, the so-called Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. 
The kingdom was ruled by Francis II, who was to be the last of the 
Bourbon family to rule in Italy.	
●
●
On May 6, 1860, Garibaldi and his cadre of volunteers landed in Sicily. 
There were just 1,000 of them, but they were highly motivated and well 
led. As Garibaldi piled up victories, more fighters flocked to his cause. 
He took Sicily, crossed the Strait of Messina to the Italian mainland, 
and marched north toward Naples, gathering strength as he went. On 
September 7, 1860, Garibaldi entered Naples to the triumphant cheers 
of everybody but the Bourbons.
●
●
With victory over Naples, the only areas still to be added to the newly 
unified Italy were Veneto and Rome and the Papal States. Veneto was 
incorporated in 1866; Rome and the Papal States were taken in 1870 
when France—which had guaranteed papal sovereignty to that time—
could no longer do so because of its war with Prussia. 
Giuseppe Verdi
●
●
Giuseppe Verdi was born in October 1813 in the village of Le Roncole 
in the north-central Italian duchy of Parma. At the time of Verdi’s 
birth, Parma was part of Napoleon’s First French Empire. As a result, 
111

Music as a Mirror of History
112
Verdi’s birth name was recorded in French as Joseph Fortunin 
François, and he was—to his annoyance—technically and legally a 
citizen of France.
●
●
Verdi’s family moved to the nearby town of Busseto when he was a 
child. There, he acquired a patron, a wealthy merchant named Antonio 
Barezzi. Barezzi paid for Verdi’s musical education in Milan, arranged 
for Verdi’s first full-time music position, and sponsored Verdi’s first 
public performance. Verdi went on to marry Barezzi’s daughter 
Margherita.
●
●
Life was not kind to the Verdis. Both of their children died before age 
2. Buried in grief and debt, Verdi and Margherita struggled on. 
●
●
On November 17, 1839, less than a month after his son’s death, Verdi’s 
first opera—Oberto—was premiered at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan, 
the most important and prestigious opera theater in Italy. The reviews 
ranged from so-so to very good, but La Scala director Bartolomeo 
Merelli was so impressed with Verdi that he contracted him to 
compose three additional operas.
●
●
Verdi began work on the first of the three operas, a comedy entitled 
King for a Day. A few months later, in June 1840, Margherita died. 
Verdi was despondent. He returned home to Busseto and collapsed. 
Verdi wrote Merelli to tell him that he would not be returning to Milan 
and would not finish the opera. But Merelli refused to let Verdi out of 
his contract. Thus, Verdi dragged himself back to Milan and finished 
composing his comic opera. 
●
●
King for a Day received its premiere on September 5, 1840—a 
total flop. The next morning, Merelli called Verdi into his office and 
encouraged the composer to take heart. The remaining performances 
of King for a Day were cancelled, and in their place, Merelli remounted 
Verdi’s Oberto. 

Lecture 13—Verdi: Nabucco (1842) 
Nabucco
●
●
In December 1840, Verdi announced that he was through with music. 
But a few days later, Merelli gave Verdi a libretto by Temistocle Solera 
and urged him to read it. Verdi was taken with the line “Va pensiero” 
(“Fly, thought, on golden wings”). Verdi’s setting of the words Va 
pensiero then became the unofficial anthem of the Risorgimento. 
●
●
In the opera, the chorus is sung by the Israelites, who are being held 
captive in Babylon by King Nebuchadrezzar (Nabucco, in Italian). 
When the opera was first performed in 1842, it didn’t take long 
for audiences to decide that the Israelites’ dream of freedom and 
homeland was their dream of freedom and homeland. 
●
●
Nabucco premiered in March 1842 and was a triumph. In the opera, the 
audience saw a story that was a thinly veiled metaphor for the Italian 
nation itself: a proud and 
ancient nation, held captive 
by oppressive foreigners, 
longing to be free. Nabucco 
spoke 
directly 
to 
the 
nationalist soul of the Italian 
people. 
●
●
Nabucco 
received 
an 
incredible 75 performances 
at La Scala alone during 
the year of its premiere, 
not 
counting 
other 
performances 
that 
took 
place almost immediately 
across 
Italy.

voice, and he was embraced

113

Music as a Mirror of History
114
as a great Italian patriot, a composer whose art served the cause of 
Italian nationhood.
Verdi’s Political Career
●
●
Despite his plans to resign from parliament after just a few months, 
Verdi did not. He continued to serve as a deputy for more than four 
years, bringing his intelligence, creativity, and no-nonsense attitude to 
the Chamber of Deputies. He was a tireless and effective advocate for 
those issues he held particularly dear: general education and music 
education, agriculture and flood control, and financial support for 
Italy’s opera houses and theaters. 
●
●
Typical of Verdi, he downplayed his actions as a parliamentarian to 
the point of dismissing his participation entirely, claiming that he had 
neither “the inclination nor the will nor the talent for it.”
●
●
In fact, Verdi served his nation greatly. He might have begun his 
career as an inadvertent hero, but his operas inspired and united his 
countrymen at a time of revolution and nation building, and his actions 
as a politician helped to gain legitimacy for the “new” Italian nation.

Wagner: The Ring (1876)
R
ichard Wagner’s towering, four-evening-long mega-masterwork 
entitled The Ring of the Nibelung—or The Ring—is typically 
discussed as an epic retelling of various Nordic sagas, central to 
which is a magic ring that grants its owner the power to rule the world. 
But The Ring is much more than that. It is, in fact, a metaphor for and 
a radical critique of 19th-century European society: a story of greed, 
corruption, sacrifice, and hope. The big history behind this lecture is the 
extent to which Wagner’s extraordinary Ring cycle is a commentary on 
contemporary politics and society.
Background to The Ring
●
●
Karl Marx wrote The Communist Manifesto in 1848, an auspicious year 
in European history. 
●
●
Starting in February 1848, revolutions broke out across Europe. 
Everywhere (or so it seemed), armed students and workers 
roamed the streets, representative assemblies met and demanded 
constitutions, kings and police chiefs fled, and republics were 
declared. 
●
●
It seemed to some that the promise of the French Revolution was 
finally being realized across the European continent, 59 years 
after it had begun. It seemed as if the arbitrary rule of hereditary 
monarchs would finally be replaced by republics in which the 
urban working class and the rural peasantry would share equally in 
political power and economic opportunity. 
●
●
It was class warfare, and Marx had seen it coming, as did many 
others, including a 35-year-old writer and composer named 
Richard Wagner, who was then living in Dresden. There, Wagner 
became increasingly involved with a community of socialist German 
Lecture 
14

Music as a Mirror of History
116
nationalists, giving speeches and writing and publishing incendiary, 
revolutionary articles and pamphlets under various pen names.
●
●
In May 1849, an anti-monarchial uprising took place in Dresden. 
Because of his writings, Wagner was known to the authorities. Thus, 
when the uprising was put down within a few days, a warrant was 
issued for Wagner’s arrest. He fled to Switzerland, where he lived until 
1862. During this time, he began working on his great socioeconomic 
manifesto, The Ring.
Summary of The Ring 
●
●
The story of The Ring revolves around a magic golden ring that 
presumably grants its owner the power to rule the world. 
●
●
A love-starved dwarf named Alberich steals a lump of gold—the 
symbolic patrimony of the German nation—from the Rhine River. By 
renouncing love and forging the gold into a ring, Alberich becomes 
powerful and overbearing, convinced of his own supreme importance 
and invulnerability. 
●
●
But he doesn’t keep the ring for long. Wotan, the king of the gods, 
steals it from Alberich and turns it over to a giant named Fasolt who, 
along with his brother, Fafner, has just built the gods’ new castle, 
Valhalla. The giant Fafner kills Fasolt and takes the ring for himself. 
Fafner then uses his newfound power to turn himself into a dragon so 
that he might more effectively guard the ring.
●
●
Wotan schemes for years to retrieve the ring. His “tool” in this endeavor 
is his own half-mortal grandson, Siegfried, who kills Fafner and takes 
the ring. Empowered by the ring, Siegfried awakens a sleeping beauty 
on a fiery mountaintop. She is a Valkyrie, a warrior princess named 
Brünnhilde, who happens to be Wotan’s daughter. 
●
●
Siegfried gives the ring to Brünnhilde, and for a brief time, all is 
peaceful. But a bad man named Hagen drugs Siegfried, who steals the 

Lecture 14—Wagner: The Ring (1876) 
ring from Brünnhilde. Hagen then kills Siegfried and attempts to claim 
the ring for himself. 
●
●
But Brünnhilde intercedes and returns the ring to the Rhine. She 
commits suicide on Siegfried’s funeral pyre, also setting Valhalla on 
fire. The gods and all their corruption burn; Hagen drowns; the gold 
is restored to the Rhine; and nature is once again in balance. Thus 
begins the presumably utopian new age: the age of man, unsullied by 
corrupt gods and greedy giants, an age initiated by Brünnhilde’s self-
sacrifice and her love for Siegfried. 
The Industrial Revolution 
●
●
The Ring represents many things to many people, and like any great 
work of art, it has been analyzed in many different ways. At its heart, 
however, The Ring is a socialist critique of 19th-century industrial society. 
We know this because Wagner was not just a composer but a voracious 
reader and a tireless writer of articles, pamphlets, and essays.
●
●
Although it began in England around 1780, the Industrial Revolution 
in Western Europe was a 19th-century phenomenon. The extraordinary 
changes wrought by industrialization during the first half of the 19th 
century were a function of the symbiotic growth of large factories 
and great manufacturing cities and the population explosion that 
accompanied that growth. 
●
●
The factory owners, most of whom were self-made entrepreneurs, 
were the first industrial capitalists. They became rich, but their labor 
pool of mostly unskilled workers did not share in that wealth. That 
labor pool—men, women and children—worked shifts of 14 hours or 
more. The industrial neighborhoods in which they lived were horrific 
agglomerations of huts and shanties blackened with coal dust, and 
disease was everywhere to be found. 
●
●
By 1845, there was a growing sense among young German intellectuals, 
including Friedrich Engels, Karl Marx, and Richard Wagner, that the 
117

Music as a Mirror of History
118
In the mid-1840s, the “science” 
of socialism—developed 
chiefly by Karl Marx—did not 
yet exist, but socialist ideals 
captured the imaginations of 
many would-be revolutionaries, 
including Richard Wagner.

Lecture 14—Wagner: The Ring (1876) 
sins of industrialization were the inevitable result of private ownership 
and the lust for profit: in a word, capitalism. For these intellectuals, 
the answer was a social and economic system in which ownership, 
management, and production were cooperative: in a word, socialism. 
Wagner on Property
●
●
According to the Wagner scholar Mark Berry, “Wagner nursed a 
profound hostility towards private property from his [youngest] days.” 
By 1848, he had come to believe that there was no such thing as 
private property; should someone claim exclusive right to something, 
it was tantamount to theft. This was Wagner’s belief when he began 
writing The Ring: that property and theft were synonymous.
●
●
The Ring opens in the depths of the Rhine River. Soon, the rising 
sun strikes the fabled Rhine gold: the essence, the patrimony, the 
wealth of the German nation. The caretakers of the gold, the three 
Rhinemaidens, flit about and celebrate the gold.
●
●
The Rhine gold is public property that belongs to and brings 
equilibrium to all things. But it is stolen by Alberich the dwarf, who 
turns it into his private property by forging it into a ring. He uses its 
power—like any good factory owner—to enslave his fellow Nibelungs, 
who must mine and smelt gold to feed Alberich’s bottomless greed. 
●
●
Alberich is but the first thief to covet the ring. Wotan, the king of the 
gods, steals it from Alberich. When advised to return the ring to the 
Rhine, Wotan says that he will keep it for himself. But it is coveted 
by a wide variety of beings until, finally, it is returned to the Rhine by 
Brünnhilde. 
●
●
At the moment the gold is returned to the Rhine, the old world of 
the gods ceases to be and a new age begins. The Ring concludes 
ethereally as dawn breaks on a new age.
119

Music as a Mirror of History
120
Richard Wagner wrote the 
story of The Ring by combining 
pieces of various Scandinavian 
and Germanic myths, but in 
fact, the story, the dialogue, and 
the underlying symbolism and 
metaphors are his creation alone.

Lecture 14—Wagner: The Ring (1876) 
●
●
As the curtain closes, everyone who touched or coveted the ring 
is dead, except Alberich, the greedy, repulsive dwarf. For Wagner, 
Alberich is the eternal Jew, a race unto himself, forever an “outsider” 
who can never assimilate and, thus, be loyal to another nation.
Wagner and Jews
●
●
Wagner presents us with a great conundrum: How do we reconcile his 
extraordinary genius as a composer with his often base, sometimes 
even hateful words? The simple answer is that we can’t. Repellant 
as it is, Wagner’s anti-Semitism is intrinsic to his art. We can’t reject 
Wagner’s entire theatrical oeuvre because of what he said about Jews. 
●
●
In 1264, the Polish prince Boleslaus the Pious issued the General 
Charter of Jewish Liberties in Poland, thus granting Jews personal 
freedom and legal autonomy in Poland. On September 28, 1791—527 
years after they were emancipated in Poland—Jews were emancipated 
in revolutionary France. The emancipation movement continued 
throughout the 1800s, ending with New Hampshire in 1877—the last 
American state to enact full Jewish emancipation.
●
●
Like 
many 
German 
nationalists, 
Wagner 
viewed 
the 
newly 
emancipated Jews with undisguised revulsion. At a time when the 
German states were coalescing into a nation, Wagner perceived 
the Jews as a plague, greedy for wealth and lusting after German 
women—in a word: Alberich.
●
●
Wagner’s Nibelungs represent the newly emancipated Jews: the 
eternal outsiders, beasts driven by lust and greed. Smelters of metal 
and makers of trinkets, they pose no threat to the “surface world” as 
long as they remain in their ghettos—the caves of Nibelheim. However, 
they pose a terrible potential threat should their lust drive them to 
the surface. Alberich represents the most dangerous sort of Jew: the 
emancipated Jew, one whose desire for German women, wealth, and 
power threatens the bloodlines of the nations aboveground. 
121

Music as a Mirror of History
122
The Gods
●
●
In The Ring, Wotan and his fellow gods represent Europe’s monarchs 
and aristocracy. They are arrogant and corrupt, and they do little 
but strut around acting important, condemning to death others for 
crimes that they themselves commit. They are curiously vulnerable, 
as well. They are not immortal, nor are they all powerful. They rule by 
contract—making deals—rather than by command. 
●
●
As king, Wotan decides that the gods need a palatial new home, a 
place he will call Valhalla. Wotan contracts the construction to the 
brothers Fasolt and Fafner. In exchange for their work, they will receive 
the goddess of love, Freia, and her youth-giving golden apples.
●
●
Of course, Wotan—who represents the modern state—has no intention 
of honoring the contract. The giants—who represent the working 
class—naively believe that he will. 
●
●
Wotan sends his consigliore, Loge, to come up with an alternative 
form of payment. But Loge fails, and the giants move to take Freia. 
At that moment, the giants hear about Alberich’s theft of the Rhine 
gold, the manufacture of the ring, and Alberich’s hoard of gold. 
They offer Wotan to trade Freia for Alberich’s gold. 
●
●
Why would the giants give away the prospect of love and 
immortality for a pile of gold? Wagner explains in his essay “Art and 
Revolution”: “Our god is gold; our religion the pursuit of wealth.” 
●
●
For himself, Wotan wants the ring—and not just for the power it would 
give him but to deny that power to the Nibelungs. As Donner, the 
god of thunder, points out, “The dwarf would enslave us all, were the 
ring not snatched from him!” This cannot be allowed to happen. Thus, 
Wotan kidnaps Alberich, steals his gold, and violently tears the ring 
from Alberich’s finger.
●
●
Does Wotan realize that his actions toward Alberich are as criminal as 
those perpetrated by Alberich against the Rhinemaidens? Of course 
not. Wotan believes that his actions are entirely justified according to 
the needs of the state he embodies. 

Lecture 14—Wagner: The Ring (1876) 
●
●
Much to his dismay, Wotan does not get to keep the ring; the giants 
demand it as part of their payment, and regretfully, the king gives it up. 
The Giants
●
●
For Wagner, the giants represent the working class: powerful, 
unintelligent brutes who do the dirty jobs and must be carefully 
handled if peace is to be maintained. In his depiction of the giants, it’s 
obvious that Wagner was not a real Marxist: His proletariat must be 
carefully controlled and can never be allowed to rule. 
●
●
As we saw, one of the giants, Fafner, kills his brother, Fasolt, and 
takes the ring of power and Alberich’s hoard for himself. Fafner uses 
Alberich’s magic helmet to turn himself into a dragon; he then retreats 
to a cave to guard his hoard for perpetuity. In doing so, he becomes 
what was for Wagner the most despicable of all creatures: the idle 
nouveau riche. 
●
●
Fafner—and the sloth and ill-gained capital he represents—is slain by 
Siegfried, the “new man” who, in Wagner’s earlier drafts of The Ring, 
was to bring about the age of socialized humanity. But it took Wagner 
25 years to create The Ring, and by the time he got to the end, the 
rabid, socialism-inspired politics of his youth had metamorphosed. 
In the end, it is not Siegfried who brings about a utopian society by 
destroying the gods and capitalism with his sword but, rather, his aunt 
Brünnhilde who redeems the world through love.

Dvořák: From the New World Symphony 
(1893)
A
s schoolchildren, many of us were taught that Columbus 
discovered the Western Hemisphere and that the Europeans 
who came to the New World brought civilization to what 
had been a barbaric wilderness. However, over the last 50 years, 
this Eurocentric narrative has been discredited. In its place is a more 
nuanced version of what happens when different cultures collide as 
a result of predatory, invasive action. This lecture will take us back to 
a time before our national consciousness became so enlightened, to 
the 400th anniversary of Columbus’s “discovery” of America. It was a 
celebration that brought about the composition of one of the great 
chestnuts in the orchestral repertoire, Antonin Dvořák’s Symphony no. 
9, the New World Symphony.
American Economic Success Story 
●
●
On July 21, 1892, President Benjamin Harrison issued a proclamation 
declaring Friday, October 21, 1892—the 400th anniversary of Columbus’s 
arrival in the New World—to be a national holiday. Thus did Harrison 
kick off a yearlong series of festivities that were to collectively represent 
a celebration of America’s new and growing status as the preeminent 
industrial and technological power on the planet. 
●
●
Indeed, the 48 years from the end of the Civil War in 1865 to 1913 
saw an explosion of innovation and industrialization that vaulted the 
United States past every other nation in the world.
●
●
For example, in 1870, Great Britain was by far the world’s leading 
maker of steel, turning out 6.7 million tons, while the United States 
turned out 1.74 million and Germany, 1.56 million. By 1913, however, 
Lecture 
15

Lecture 15—Dvořák: From the New World Symphony (1893) 
U.S. steel production was at 31.5 million tons. Most of this steel was 
used in the railroad industry; in fact, it was railroads that made the 
American economic explosion possible.
●
●
Further, in 1860, the United Kingdom was the world leader in 
coal production, producing 79.3 million short tons of coal By 
comparison, in 1859, the United States produced 15.6 million short 
tons of coal. By 1905, those figures had reversed. In 1905, the United 
Kingdom produced 236 million tons of coal, while the United States 
produced 351 million tons, by far the most in the world.
●
●
Finally, in 1865, the United States harvested 175 million bushels of 
wheat, behind Russia, with 200 million bushels, and France, with 
263 million bushels. By 1892, the United States had far surpassed 
Russia and France in wheat production, producing 680 million 
bushels to Russia’s 408 million and France’s 310 million.
●
●
By 1892, it was clear that American industry and agriculture were 
producing at a level that had never before been seen. These semi-
barbaric former colonies, which had so recently been at war with each 
other, were rewriting the record books on production, efficiency, and 
technological innovation.
●
●
We might also look at a list of inventions from the United States 
between 1776 and 1892: the cotton gin, fire hydrant, combine harvester, 
steam shovel, escalator, grain elevator, and much, much more. These 
were the creations of a consumer-driven society, one that—to an 
astonishing extent—was in the position to enjoy itself.
●
●
By 1892, the great American myth was firmly in place: The United 
States was the land of opportunity, where the streets were paved 
with gold, anything was possible, and any little boy could grow up 
to be president. The United States—the new kid on the international 
block—was taking its place beside the other great powers of the 
world.
●
●
In honor of both America’s new place in the world and the 400th 
anniversary of Columbus’s first trans-Atlantic voyage, the U.S.

Congress decided to throw a party and invite the world. Four cities 
competed for the right to host this world’s fair: Chicago, New York, 
St. Louis, and Washington DC. Chicago was chosen, and on May 1, 
1893, the doors opened on what was designated the World’s Fair: 
Columbian Exposition or the Chicago World’s Fair.
●
●
We should note that the word Columbia was used interchangeably 
with the word America to describe England’s colonies in North 
America. By the time of the American Revolution, Columbia was 
considered the poetic alternative to America. Such songs as “Hail 
Columbia” and “Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean” refer to the 
United States. 
●
●
Columbia also became the name of the female personification of 
the United States, the goddess of democracy, although she was 
later replaced by Lady Liberty. 
The Chicago World’s Fair
●
●
Covering more than 600 acres, the Chicago World’s Fair was 
the grandest exposition to its time. Although 46 countries were 
represented at the exposition, it was first and foremost a showcase for 
American industrialism and innovation and a symbol of the emerging 
notion of American exceptionalism. The exposition drew more than 27 
million visitors in the six months it was open. 
●
●
Most of the more than 200 buildings built for the exposition followed 
the Beaux-Arts principles of design, a French neoclassical style of 
architecture rooted in balance, symmetry, and magnificence. Most of 
the buildings were finished with white stucco. That fact, along with 
the extensive use of electrical lighting, led the exposition to be known 
as the White City. The fair featured food courts, exhibitions, and 
performances of every conceivable type.
●
●
Those visitors lucky enough to be in attendance on Saturday, August 
12, 1893, could have participated in what was advertised as Bohemian 
Day, dedicated to Czechs and Moravians. The main event of the day 
was a concert of contemporary Czech music, performed by the 

Lecture 15—Dvořák: From the New World Symphony (1893) 
Chicago Orchestra and conducted in part by the famous Bohemian 
composer Antonin Dvořák. When Dvořák came on stage to conduct 
his Symphony no. 8 in G Major, the audience of 8,000 and the 
orchestra of 114 players gave him a two-minute ovation. 
The Chicago World’s Fair was a 
symbol of American exceptionalism—
the notion that the United States is 
qualitatively better than other nations.

Dvořák in America
●
●
By 1891—at the age of 50—Dvořák was that rarest of living composers: 
successful, appreciated by a worldwide public, and relatively wealthy. 
Regarded by many as being the second-greatest living composer 
after Brahms, the nationalist Czech accent with which Dvořák’s music 
spoke made it, in fact, much more popular than Brahms’s music.
●
●
It was Dvořák’s fame as a nationalist composer that made him a 
particularly desirable catch for a rich American woman named 
Jeannette Meyer Thurber. Mrs. Thurber was the wife of a wholesale 
grocer and was herself a musician of talent, having been educated at 
the Paris Conservatory. In Dvořák, Mrs. Thurber was not looking for a 
romantic catch but a role model.
●
●
Jeannette Thurber was one of the greatest patrons of music 
the United States has ever known. In 1885, Thurber founded the 
National Conservatory of Music in New York. It was modeled on 
the Paris Conservatory, and its avowed mission was to create “a 
national musical spirit.” 
●
●
On June 5, 1891, Thurber cabled Dvořák in Prague and offered 
him the directorship of the conservatory. She wanted Dvořák to 
help found—through his own example—an American school of 
composition at a time when almost every American composer 
wanted to sound like Brahms.
●
●
Thurber made Dvořák an offer he couldn’t refuse: Come to New 
York, become the director of the conservatory, teach three hours 
a day, and put together some concerts. For this most modest 
schedule, he would receive a three-year contract at $15,000 a 
year—a 2,500 percent increase over Dvořák’s salary at the Prague 
Conservatory and the equivalent today of around $405,000 a 
year. 
●
●
Dvořák took the job, though it’s important to note that he did not 
go to New York just for the money. In truth, Dvořák was seduced by 
Thurber’s vision for American music. He was also in search of new 
inspiration, which he found in the New World. He was fascinated by 
the idea of America: a huge, sprawling, somewhat barbaric, energy-

Lecture 15—Dvořák: From the New World Symphony (1893) 
filled meritocracy in which his own working-class roots would be 
considered an asset rather than a liability. 
●
●
Thus, Dvořák and his family arrived in America on September 27, 1892. 
Dvořák’s arrival provoked a media frenzy, largely because he was the 
first famous European composer to ever visit the United States.
●
●
Within a few weeks of Dvořák’s arrival, the Columbian quadricentennial 
began. The composer had a front-row seat for one of the most 
sustained binges of Americana the nation had ever indulged. For her 
part, Thurber gave Dvořák a copy of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow’s 
epic poem, The Song of Hiawatha, with the suggestion that he use it 
as the basis for what she called the great American opera. 
●
●
Dvořák’s New World Symphony—composed in New York City 
between January 10 and May 24, 1893—was the first of his so-called 
American works. With its references to Negro spirituals, the plantation 
songs of Stephen Foster, and Longfellow’s Song of Hiawatha, it has 
also been called the first great American symphony. In reality, it is a 
cosmopolitan work—a combination of a German-styled symphony 
and tone poem with a thin thematic veneer of Americanisms layered 
on top for local color.
Symphony No. 9 in E Minor, From the New World
●
●
Much has been made about the resemblance of a number of themes 
in the New World Symphony to preexisting songs, including “Swing 
Low, Sweet Chariot”; Hattie Starr’s “Little Alabama Coon”; “Three 
Blind Mice”; and others. Most noticeable is the resemblance between 
Arthur Johnson’s song “Massa Dear” and the English horn theme that 
begins the second movement of the symphony.
●
●
Over and over again, Dvořák labeled as nonsense the assertion 
that he had borrowed any preexisting melodies and inserted them 
into the symphony. Rather, he said that he had tried to capture and 
129

Music as a Mirror of History
130
reproduce the spirit of the spirituals and plantation songs he heard 
in America. 
●
●
Misinterpretation of the title of the symphony has also contributed to 
the confusion. Dvořák did not call the symphony The New World, a 
title that implies it contains music of the New World. Instead, he called 
it From the New World, which he later explained meant “greetings 
from the New World.” 
●
●
If Dvořák’s Ninth Symphony was influenced by any external source, 
that source would be Longfellow’s The Song of Hiawatha, which was 
originally published in 1855. He never wrote the Hiawatha opera that 
Thurber had suggested, but it is generally understood that the second 
and third movements of the symphony were inspired by scenes from 
the poem. In particular, Dvořák told a reporter from The New York 
Herald that the third-movement scherzo was inspired by Longfellow’s 
description of the dance of Pau-Puk-Keewis. 
●
●
The Ninth Symphony’s premiere at Carnegie Hall on December 16, 
1893, was the greatest triumph of Dvořák’s compositional career. 
Henry T. Fink, writing for the New York Evening Post spoke for pretty 
much everybody when he wrote, “Any one who heard it could not 
deny that it is the greatest symphonic work ever composed in this 
country. A masterwork has been added to the symphonic literature.”

than Dvořák’s residency in the United States. He was the first great 
European composer to visit the United States, and because of his 
fame, his ideas about music—particularly American music—had 
tremendous impact on the American musical community. Dvořák 
recognized—long before the American mainstream did—that African 
American music would be the key to creating a uniquely American 
musical tradition.

Balakirev: Symphony No. 1 (1898)
M
ikhail Glinka, who we discussed in an earlier lecture, is today 
considered the messiah of Russian concert music. But even 
messiahs need apostles to spread the word. Glinka’s apostle—
the man whose words and actions made Glinka the messiah of Russian 
music, the man who wrote the Glinka gospels by codifying and expanding 
on Glinka’s work, the man who framed Russian music as being part of the 
geopolitics of the 19th century—was a composer, pianist, conductor, and 
teacher named Mily Alekseyevich Balakirev, who lived from 1837 to 1910. 
The big history behind this lecture is the emergence of Russian concert 
music in the 19th century and the degree to which that emergence was a 
reflection of contemporary geopolitics.
The Russian Question
●
●
In its imperial and Soviet manifestations, the Russian-Soviet Empire 
consisted of fully one-sixth of the planet’s landmass. Since 1547, this 
huge expanse has been governed by three kinds of autocrats: tsars, 
general secretaries of the Soviet Communist Party, and presidents of 
the Russian Federation. 
●
●
Russia was ruled by tsars from 1547 to 1917, when an exhausted and 
bankrupt nation ousted them. Unfortunately, Marxism’s utopian dream 
was butchered by Bolshevism, which was just as repressive and 
autocratic as tsarism. Russia’s post-Soviet flirtation with democracy 
lasted only nine years: from December 1991, when Mikhail Gorbachev 
formally dissolved the Soviet Union, until December 31, 1999, when 
Vladimir Putin became acting president of the Russian Federation.

●
●
The question of what we should make of Russia and the Russians is 
not a new one. As Winston Churchill famously said in 1939: “I cannot 
forecast to you the action of Russia. It is a riddle wrapped in a mystery 
inside an enigma.” It may be that Russia—and Russian art and music, 
as well—can be understood only in the context of Russia itself.
●
●
One of the “peculiarities” of Russia (peculiar to the Western mind) 
is the Russian predilection for derzhavnost: the desire for a strong, 
paternalistic, even authoritarian expansionist state, similar to the 
tsarist and Soviet states. When the Soviet Union disintegrated in 1991, 
everyone in the West expected that Russia would naturally develop 
political and economic systems based on Western models. But that 
didn’t happen; in fact, the Russian electorate has rejected the Western 
democratic model and market economy. 
Russia has historically 
confounded Western observers; 
its size and the diversity of its 
population preclude any easy 
generalizations about what 
Russia is and what it isn’t.

Lecture 16—Dvořák: From the New World Symphony (1893) 
133
Russia’s Geography
●
●
At the heart of Russia’s issues, character, and history is its geography. 
Its constant expansion represented, in large part, a never-ending 
quest for buffers against external enemies. 
●
●
Given their history and long, porous borders, the Russians have every 
reason to be paranoid of outsiders. 
●
●
Russia hacked up and occupied Poland in the late 18th century, 
though that didn’t eliminate all of its potential enemies. 
●
●
The rise of Prussia and the unification of Germany put a large, 
wealthy, sophisticated, and militaristic nation on Russia’s western 
border. To Russia’s southwest was the Habsburg Empire; to the 
south was the Ottoman Empire. By the late 19th century, Russia also 
had a potential enemy to the east in the form of an industrialized 
and militarized Japan. 
●
●
For the Bolsheviks who took control in 1917, the world around Russia 
was an even more dangerous place than it had been under the tsar. 
When the great world revolution that Lenin had predicted failed to 
materialize, the newly christened Soviet Union found itself in a difficult 
spot, as a communist enclave surrounded by capitalist enemies. Thus, 
Russian-Soviet xenophobia became common and played a role in 
the debate over what was and what was not “Russian” music. At the 
center of that debate was Mily Balakirev.
The Decembrist Revolt and Its Aftermath
●
●
On December 26, 1825, some 3,000 officers and men of the imperial 
Russian guard gathered in Senate Square in St. Petersburg and refused 
to swear allegiance to the new tsar, Nicholas I. Instead, they wanted 
Nicholas’s older brother, Grand Duke Constantine, who was known to 
have liberal, constitutional leanings. The Decembrists assumed that 
once they made their demands known, the rest of the imperial guard 
and the army would flock to their side. 

Music as a Mirror of History
134
●
●
Unfortunately, a brief standoff led to defeat when the artillery was 
called in. Those Decembrists not blown to pieces were put on trial; 
the ringleaders were hanged, and the rest were shipped off to Siberia.
●
●
In the years following the Decembrist Revolt, the politically repressive 
policies of Tsar Nicholas I kept a tight lid on any unauthorized political 
debate. However, the spirit of liberalization and nationalism generated 
by the revolt was felt powerfully in the art world, where artists, writers, 
and musicians became increasingly preoccupied with defining and 
creating distinctively Russian art, literature, and music.
●
●
The often rancorous debate within the Russian artistic community was 
that between the Zapadniki (pro-Westerners) and the Slavophiles. The 
Zapadniki believed that Russia should adopt the artistic innovations 
of Western Europe, while the Slavophiles considered that to be a 
betrayal of all things Russian. 
●
●
Mikhail Glinka, despite his Western training, fell into the Slavophile 
camp. His attempts to compose a symphony illustrate well his 
Slavophile leanings. Glinka’s first attempt came in 1834, soon after 
his return to Russia. He wrote the first movement, then abandoned 
the piece. In 1852, he again tried to compose a symphony and again 
quit soon after he started. In his memoirs, Glinka explained the 
problem: “Not having the strength to get out of the German rut in the 
Development, I rejected my effort.” 
●
●
Here, Glinka made a double confession. First, he admitted (perhaps 
inadvertently) that the compositional techniques required to develop 
his ideas—thematic fragmentation and metamorphosis, continuous 
modulation, and so forth—were technically beyond him. But, according 
to Glinka, because such techniques constitute “the German rut,” he 
confessed no desire to master them because they were contrary to 
his Russian musical nature.
●
●
Glinka understood full well that sonata form lay at the heart of the 
18th- and 19th-century symphony. And at the heart of sonata form 

Lecture 16—Dvořák: From the New World Symphony (1893) 
135
is the development section, during which themes are dissected, 
manipulated, fragmented, and recombined. 
●
●
A development section requires that a composer rethink and 
reinterpret musical materials presented earlier in the movement. 
●
●
Glinka held that this sort of developmental process grew out of 
the German/Austrian predisposition for intellectualization, analysis, 
and logical argument—processes that Glinka believed were foreign 
to the Russian creative impulse. 
●
●
Glinka and other composers believed that a predisposition toward 
expository music was intrinsic to the Russian national musical 
character. They also believed that using German compositional models 
and techniques was akin to embracing the actions and aesthetic of 
the “evil musical empire.” 
Mily Balakirev and the Russian Five
●
●
More than anyone else, it was Mily Balakirev who postulated and 
promulgated precisely what Russian nationalist music should be. 
Balakirev was born in the city of Nizhny Novgorod, which was known 
as Gorky from 1932 to 1990. He was a child prodigy as both a pianist 
and conductor and began composing at the age of 15.
●
●
In 1855—at age 18—Balakirev moved to St. Petersburg, where he met 
and played piano for his hero, Mikhail Glinka. Glinka—who was 51 at the 
time—was captivated by Balakirev’s piano playing but was somewhat 
less impressed with his compositional technique. Balakirev was self-
taught as a composer, and it showed. 
●
●
Glinka died suddenly a little more than a year after meeting Balakirev. 
Thus, Balakirev lost his mentor but had an opportunity placed in his 
lap. Like Glinka, Balakirev believed that there should be a distinctly 
Russian school of music. With Glinka gone, Balakirev—20 years old 
and musically uneducated though he was—was as close to being 
Glinka’s successor as anyone in the tiny Russian musical community. 

Music as a Mirror of History
136
He put out his shingle in St. Petersburg as a composer, music teacher, 
and critic and went to work. 
●
●
Amazingly, Balakirev soon came to be accepted as Glinka’s successor. 
During the 1860s, he gathered around him a group of young amateur 
composers who eventually changed the face of not just Russian music 
but Western concert music. Those composers were Cesar Cui, Modest 
Mussorgsky, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, and Aleksandr Borodin. They 
came to be called the Moguchaya Kuchka (“the Five”). 
Vladimir Vasilyevich Stasov
●
●
The man who coined the term Moguchaya Kuchka was the Russian 
pianist and critic Vladimir Vasilyevich Stasov. It was Stasov whose 
writing created the legend of this group of homegrown Russian 
composers, battling the forces of Germanic musical hegemony and 
emerging victorious, having birthed a new, authentic Russian music.
●
●
Stasov helped Balakirev formulate the four principles that they 
claimed were the basic elements of true Russian music: (1) a rejection 
of academic technique and preexisting musical form; (2) the presence 
of an “oriental” element that embraced the Eastern, non-European 
provinces of the Russian Empire; (3) a preference for program music 
that reflected an anti-academic compositional stance; and (4) a quest 
for Russian national character. According to Balakirev and Stasov, this 
was best achieved by incorporating folk music or folk-like music into 
concert works.
●
●
This belief in the power of folk music was part of the 19th-century 
nationalist program, and nowhere was it more pronounced than in 
Russia. Folk music was considered to be a product of nature, an 
ageless mirror of the mystical essence of a people. 
●
●
For example, the fourth and final movement of Balakirev’s 
Symphony no. 1 is based on a folk song called “Sharlatarla from 
Partarla.”

Lecture 16—Dvořák: From the New World Symphony (1893) 
137
Anton and Nikolai Rubinstein
●
●
Balakirev and his group were proud to be self-taught and dogmatically 
nationalist in their artistic outlook. That nationalist dogma required 
constant vigilance against the creeping, subversive influence of 
Western music on the “new” Russian music. In this, they had enemies 
at their gates: the Rubinstein brothers, Anton and Nikolai.
●
●
Anton Rubinstein was a prolific Russian composer and one of the 
greatest pianists of the 19th century. In 1855, he published an article 
in a German magazine in which he wrote that attempts to create 
nationalist opera were doomed to failure and cited the operas of 
Glinka as examples. The battle lines were drawn. 
●
●
Rubinstein was an avowed Zapadniki (pro-Westerner) who was 
convinced that Russia would remain a musical backwater until 
proper, rigorous, Western European–style training was made available 
to Russian musicians. To that end, he founded the St. Petersburg 
Conservatory in 1862 and quickly built it into a formidable institution. 
Three years later, Anton’s younger brother, Nikolai Rubinstein, opened 
the Moscow Conservatory.
●
●
As far as the Five were concerned, the Rubinsteins were an existential 
threat to true Russian music. Balakirev stated categorically that the 
St. Petersburg Conservatory represented “a plot to bring all Russian 
music under the yoke of the German generals!” 
Balakirev’s Lack of Training
●
●
In the end, Balakirev’s xenophobia—and the technical deficiencies that 
were its result—hurt him both artistically and professionally. For all 
his skill, Balakirev lacked the technical knowledge and training that 
all professionals need to fall back on when the going gets tough. His 
inability to complete works in a timely manner was not the result of 
writer’s block but the epic slowness of someone who always has to 
grope blindly for a solution. 

Music as a Mirror of History
138
●
●
Unfortunately, his slowness caused a number of Balakirev’s most 
innovative works to be perceived as derivative. His Symphony no. 1 is 
a prime example. 
●
●
When he began the symphony in 1864, the 27-year-old Balakirev 
was in the process of codifying his theories regarding rhythm, 
melody, and the use of Russian folk song and orientalisms. Had 
Balakirev completed and premiered the symphony in two years, it 
would have been acclaimed for both its beauty and its innovations. 
●
●
However, the symphony was completed in 1897 and performed in 
1898. By that time, Rimsky-Korsakov, Mussorgsky, and Borodin had 
been writing music that used Balakirev’s innovative techniques for 
decades. As a result, Balakirev’s Symphony no. 1 appeared to be 
derivative of the music of his students when, in fact, the opposite 
was true. 
●
●
More than just a practicing musician, Balakirev was a political 
musician, who responded artistically to the Russian tendency 
toward xenophobia that was part of the Russian national psyche. He 
established a baseline aesthetic that became—through the influence 
of his teaching and the force of his personality—what we today 
identify as being the Russian national compositional style. An apostle 
of Glinka, he became a prophet in his own right and helped lay the 
aesthetic groundwork for Russian concert music as we know it.

Janáček: Piano Sonata I.X.1905 (1906)
B
y March 1939—thanks to the collusion, miscalculation, and 
cowardice of the Western powers—Hitler had managed to occupy 
and annex Austria and Czechoslovakia; convince some of his 
generals and most of his people that he was a genius leader; and put the 
fear of God into the rest of Europe. On September 1, 1939, the “hot war” in 
Europe began when Germany invaded Poland. As we all know, World War 
II ended badly for Hitler and Germany. What many of us probably don’t 
know is that the war in Europe did not end with the surrender of Germany 
in 1945. At that point, it was payback time, and there was—particularly in 
Czechoslovakia—hell to pay. 
The Founding of Czechoslovakia
●
●
The nation known as Czechoslovakia was founded on October 28, 1918, 
two weeks before the armistice that ended World War I. It officially 
came into existence on September 10, 1919, with the signing of the 
Treaty of Saint-Germain. The treaty formally dissolved the Austro-
Hungarian Empire and created three new states: Czechoslovakia, 
Poland, and Yugoslavia. 
●
●
The new country of Czechoslovakia had a substantial German minority. 
At the time of its creation, 51 percent of the country was Czech, 22 
percent was German, 16 percent was Slovak, and the remainder was a 
smattering of Hungarians, Ruthenians, Jews, and Poles.
●
●
The German-speaking minority and the native Czechs did not always 
get along. During the days of the Austrian Empire, the German-
speaking minority represented the ruling class in what was to become 
Czechoslovakia. They controlled the economy, the government, and 
Lecture 
17

Music as a Mirror of History
140
many of the cultural institutions, all of which rubbed the increasingly 
nationalistic Czech majority the wrong way. 
●
●
With the creation of Czechoslovakia, the Czech majority now held 
sway over the once-dominant German minority. That German minority 
was clustered in the northern, western, and southwestern edges of 
Bohemia and Moravia, lands that bordered on Austria and Germany. 
The Germans collectively called these areas Sudetenland and 
themselves Sudeten Germans. 
●
●
When the Nazis marched into Czechoslovakia in 1938, the Sudeten 
Germans celebrated. But their celebration officially ended about six 
years later, when—on May 9, 1945—Soviet Red Army troops entered 
Prague.
Retribution
●
●
The atrocities perpetrated on the people of Czechoslovakia by the 
Nazis were legion. Some 55,000 Czechs and Slovaks were murdered 
outright. Roughly 350,000 Czech citizens were enslaved and 
dispatched to work as laborers throughout the German Reich. The 
Czech Jewish community—118,000 people—simply ceased to exist.
●
●
With the war officially over in May 1945, it was time for retribution. 
During the war, some 1.6 million Germans living in Poland had fled to 
Czechoslovakia as the Red Army advanced. As a result, in May 1945 
there were, according to German estimates, about 4.6 million German 
civilians in Czechoslovakia—but not for long.
●
●
Murderous and unorganized acts of violence toward the Czech 
German community began immediately after the end of formal 
hostilities. These random acts of violence were followed by a command 
by General Zdeněk Novák—head of the Prague military command—to 
“deport all Germans within the historical Czech borders.”

By March of 1939, Hitler’s 
forces occupied most of 
Czechoslovakia, and it ceased to 
exist as an independent nation.

●
●
Thus began a brutal ethnic cleansing. Between 1945 and 1948, about 
90 percent of the ethnic Germans in Czechoslovakia—roughly 4 
million people—were forcibly expelled and shipped to East or West 
Germany, their homes and property confiscated. Concentration camps 
were reopened and stocked with German families, and massacres 
took place. 
●
●
The age-old enmity in Czech lands between the German/Austrian 
minority and the Czech majority profoundly shaped the life and music 
of the Moravian-born composer Leoš Janáček.
Leoš Janáček
●
●
Leoš Janáček was born in 1854 in the village of Hukvaldy in the 
Moravia-Silesia region of today’s Czech Republic. At the time of 
Janáček’s birth, Moravia was part of the Austrian Empire, and his 
hometown was known by its German name, Hochwald. He was the 
ninth child of the village schoolmaster and choirmaster.
●
●
Because he had a first-rate singing voice, Janáček received, at age 11, 
a scholarship to be a chorister and to attend the Queen’s Monastery in 
the Moravian city of Brno. 
●
●
The Queen’s Monastery was, in fact, an excellent music conservatory, 
and Janáček did well studying singing, organ, and piano. On graduating 
at the age of 15, he trained as a teacher. He began composing at around 
the age of 21; his first compositions were simple works influenced by 
folk music for the various amateur choral groups he conducted. 
●
●
Feeling he had more to learn, Janáček studied at the Prague Organ 
School—another high-profile conservatory of music—in 1874 and 1875. 
He went home to Brno, resumed composing, and returned to his job 
as choirmaster.
●
●
In 1879—at the age of 25—Janáček was admitted to the Leipzig 
Conservatory. Founded by Felix Mendelssohn in 1843, the Leipzig 

Lecture 17—Janáček: Piano Sonata I.X.1905 (1906) 
Conservatory was considered one of the finest schools of music in 
the German-speaking world. Janáček lasted there only a little more 
than four months. He hated his classes and thought his teachers 
were too old, too slow, and too pedantic. Mostly, though, he hated 
the “German-ness” of Leipzig and the conservatory—what he 
considered to be the smug arrogance and intolerable conceit of the 
Germans.
●
●
In 1830, Janáček traveled to Vienna, where he was admitted to the 
Vienna Conservatory—again, one of the premier music schools in the 
world. This time, he lasted only two months. Upset when he failed to 
receive a prize in composition—and believing himself to be the victim 
of a conspiracy to embarrass and discredit a Czech composer—he 
returned to Brno. He then married Zdenka Schulzova, a woman of 
German descent.
●
●
On his return to Brno, Janáček’s sense of Czech nationalism—and his 
hatred of Austrians and Germans—came into full bloom. He refused 
to attend the German-language theaters and concert halls that 
dominated Brno’s cultural life and even refused to ride on the city 
trams until Czechs were in the majority on the Brno town council. It’s 
important to note that his attitudes toward Germans and Austrians 
and his Czech nationalism were typical for the time.
The Czech National Revival
●
●
Life in what would eventually become Czechoslovakia took a bad 
turn back in 1618, when the aging Habsburg Holy Roman Emperor 
Matthias was forced by the future emperor—his cousin Ferdinand—to 
revoke the so-called Letter of Majesty that had guaranteed freedom 
of religion in Bohemia. 
●
●
Members of the Bohemian diet revolted and expressed their 
displeasure on May 23, 1618, by throwing two imperial Habsburg 
regents and their secretary out a third-story window of Hradčany 
Castle in Prague. Incredibly, all three survived the 70-foot fall. 
143

Music as a Mirror of History
144
●
●
Not surprisingly, the Austrian Habsburgs reacted poorly. This so-
called Defenestration of Prague precipitated the Thirty Years’ War, 
which eventually involved most of Europe. 
●
●
Immediately following this episode, the Bohemians declared the 
Habsburg emperor deposed and elected Frederick as king of 
Bohemia. Frederick was a poor leader, and he and his Protestant army 
were crushed by the Austrians at the Battle of White Mountain in 1620. 
●
●
As punishment for its actions, Bohemia was demoted from a Habsburg 
kingdom to an “imperial crown land,” and the seat of the Holy Roman 
Empire was permanently relocated from Prague to Vienna. Overnight, 
Prague went from being a capital city to a backwater. 
●
●
The 
Austrians 
then 
introduced 
what 
was 
called 
“forcible 
Germanization”: the introduction of German as the sole official 
language, oppressive taxation, and absentee landownership. Together, 
these moves reduced the bulk of the Czech population to misery.
The Czech Language
●
●
For the next 200 years, the Czech language was banned from schools, 
newspapers, the courts, and government administration. Czech-
language books were burned. Over time, the Czech language was 
reduced to a means of communication between illiterate peasants.
●
●
The Czech national revival that began in the early 19th century was, 
initially, about the revival of the language. The Austrian Habsburgs, 
weakened by their encounters with Napoleon’s France, were 
powerless to stop this grassroots revival. By the 1860s, Czech folklore, 
folk music, and folk traditions, which had survived in the countryside, 
were explored and embraced by nationalist Czech artists in search of 
inspiration and authenticity. 
●
●
One of those artists was Leoš Janáček. As he matured as a composer, 
the importance of Moravian folk music and the Czech language itself 

Lecture 17—Janáček: Piano Sonata I.X.1905 (1906) 
became his decisive influences. From his study of folk song, Janáček 
came to believe that melody was a direct outgrowth of language. To 
that end, he developed a system of what he called speech melody: He 
would jot down melodic ideas based on the cadence of the spoken 
word. As a result, his melodic language became a direct outgrowth of 
his Czech language.
From the Street 1.X.1905
●
●
The title of Janáček’s piano sonata From the Street 1.X.1905 (“the first 
of October 1905”) refers to a protest that began in Brno on October 
1, 1905, and climaxed with the killing of a protester on the following 
day. The two movements of the sonata correspond with the events of 
those two days. 
●
●
Brno, as the capital city of Moravia, had a significant population of 
German-speaking bureaucrats, government officials, and members of 
the upper class. Tension between the Germans and Czechs in Brno 
slowly increased during the second half of the 19th century, as Czechs 
demanded—and were grudgingly allowed—to build a Czech-language 
grammar school, a community concert hall and cultural center, and a 
theater. 
●
●
The bad blood between the Czechs and the Germans went from 
simmer to full boil during the first years of the 20th century. The 
decisive issue was higher education. In 1901, Czech parliamentarians in 
Bohemia and Moravia demanded that a Czech-language university be 
established in Brno to complement one already established in Prague. 
However, the German town council of Brno rejected the idea.
●
●
The German community in Brno called for a demonstration to support 
the town council’s decision. On October 1, 1905, German speakers 
from across Moravia, Bohemia, and Austria gathered in the center 
of town. At the same time, Czech counter-demonstrators gathered 
outside the Czech community concert hall. Inevitably, the groups 
clashed, at which point German-led police and German regimental 
145

Music as a Mirror of History
146
troops attacked the Czechs. The 51-year-old Leoš Janáček was right 
in the middle of the melee.
●
●
Things came to a head the next day, when the military again attacked 
a Czech demonstration outside the entrance of the community 
concert hall. A 20-year-old Moravian carpenter named František 
Pavlík was bayoneted and died soon after. Janáček’s reaction was the 
composition of From the Street, October 1, 1905. 
●
●
Janáček’s sonata is as stark and chilling as the events that inspired 
it. The first movement—entitled “The Presentiment”—is cast in 
sonata form. The first theme—the opening of the movement—begins 
quietly and plaintively, though it quickly builds up to a thunderous, 
impassioned climax. The second theme—sweet and melancholy—ends 
suddenly, abruptly, and almost violently.
●
●
The second movement—entitled “The Death”—begins hesitantly and 
mysteriously. It then builds to a fervent climax before receding back 
to the hesitant, mysterious place from which it began. This movement 
is not “about” the death of František Pavlík per se; it is much more 
private and intimate than that. It is about Janáček’s own reactions to 
Pavlík’s death: his wonder, rage, and grief over this senseless act.
The Sonata That Almost Wasn’t
●
●
Janáček started composing the sonata immediately following Pavlík’s 
funeral on October 4, 1905, and completed it in early January 1906. 
In its original form, the piece was three movements long; the third 
movement was a funeral march. Having finished it, Janáček sent a 
copy of the sonata to a pianist named Ludmila Tučková, who was to 
premiere it in Brno on January 27, 1906. 
●
●
Hours before the premiere was to take place, the pianist played the 
piece through for the self-critical Janáček. He stood up, walked over 
to the piano, took the score, and tore out the entire third movement. 
He then threw the movement into a fireplace.

Lecture 17—Janáček: Piano Sonata I.X.1905 (1906) 
●
●
Soon after, in Prague, the sonata was performed at a private concert 
from Janáček’s handwritten manuscript. Janáček, still dissatisfied with 
the piece, now took extreme measures. He threw the manuscript off a 
bridge and into the Vltava River.
●
●
Janáček—and everyone else—thought that the sonata was gone 
forever. But Ludmila Tučková still possessed a copy, minus the third 
movement. Eighteen years later, Tučková rediscovered the two 
surviving movements when sifting through her sheet music. Thus, 
From the Street, October 1, 1905 received what amounted to its 
second premiere on October 23, 1924. An older and wiser Janáček 
was thrilled to learn that the two movements had survived and 
immediately sanctioned the sonata’s publication.

Rimsky-Korsakov: The Golden Cockerel 
(1907)
M
usicologist Richard Taruskin, the most important scholar of 
Russian music of his generation, had this to say about Nikolai 
Rimsky-Korsakov: “His contribution [is] simply staggering. 
Excepting only Tchaikovsky [and Shostakovich], virtually the whole 
Russian opera repertory is Rimsky’s creation. He is perhaps the most 
underrated composer of all time.” In this lecture, we’ll examine Rimsky-
Korsakov’s 15th and final opera, The Golden Cockerel.
The Story of The Golden Cockerel
●
●
The Golden Cockerel is a tragic-comic fairytale, set in three acts with 
a short prelude and postlude. The opera opens with an orchestral 
introduction that presents the themes associated with each major 
character. The introduction begins with a muted trumpet playing the 
theme associated with the Golden Cockerel itself.
●
●
Act I takes place in the great hall of the palace of Tsar Dodon. The tsar, 
exhausted with worry, is surrounded by his boyars, his two sons, and the 
commander of his army. He informs his entourage that all he wants in his 
old age is peace and quiet, but he senses that “a massacre is coming.”
●
●
The tsar’s sons, Guidon and Afron, who hate each other, offer up 
various moronic strategies for combating the approaching menace, 
and the tsar endorses their plans. Just then, a mysterious astrologer 
enters and presents the tsar with a gift: a golden cockerel. The 
astrologer promises that if trouble is coming, the bird will warn them 
by crowing. The tsar is thrilled and promises to reward the astrologer 
with whatever he wants. 
Lecture 
18

Lecture 18—Rimsky-Korsakov: The Golden Cockerel (1907) 
●
●
The tsar, finally able to sleep, takes a nap, but soon, the bird crows; 
trouble is coming from the east. The tsar wakes up, divides an army 
between his two inept sons, and sends them off to find and defeat 
the enemy. Another warning from the cockerel indicates more danger, 
and the tsar himself rides out to see what’s happening.
●
●
Act II takes place in a narrow ravine at night. As Tsar Dodon and his 
army enter, they are greeted by a terrible sight: The bodies of the 
tsar’s soldiers lie everywhere, and at center stage are the bodies of his 
sons, with their swords thrust through each other. Tsar Dodon falls to 
his knees and sings his grief.
●
●
As day breaks, a large tent appears at the back of the stage. 
Assuming that the tent is occupied by the enemy, Tsar Dodon orders 
it destroyed. But then, a beautiful young woman emerges from the 
tent with four female slaves. She is the queen of Shemakha, and she 
has emerged to sing her “Hymn to the Sun.”
●
●
Tsar Dodon takes one look at this enchantress and is instantly smitten. 
For her part, the queen informs the tsar that she is the queen of his 
enemies and, using her beauty alone, she will conquer the tsar. She 
then takes the stuttering, doddering, and clearly excited tsar into her 
tent and sings a praise to her own beauty.
●
●
In short order, the tsar offers the queen his hand in marriage, his throne, 
his possessions, and his country. She accepts it all. They depart for the 
capital in a golden chariot. As they ride off, the queen’s slaves—who 
have obviously seen their queen do this before—comment on the tsar. 
●
●
Out of context, the comments are merely funny: The tsar is an old, 
inept buffoon, a clown in king’s clothing. 
●
●
However, this opera was composed immediately after a disastrous 
war with Japan and during the subsequent civil unrest that led 
to the massacre in St. Petersburg known as Bloody Sunday. The 
slaves’ comments represent the opinions of the librettist Vladimir 
Belsky and Rimsky-Korsakov on the current tsar.
149

Music as a Mirror of History
150
●
●
Although the audience doesn’t know it, the queen is responsible for 
the deaths of the tsar’s soldiers and his sons. She might appear to be 
beautiful, but she is, in fact, the incarnation of evil. 
●
●
Act III takes place in front of the royal palace. The day is sunny, 
although dark clouds are approaching from the east. The golden 
chariot bearing the tsar and his queen enters at the head of a long 
processional. The music Rimsky-Korsakov provides is both circus-like 
and ominous.
●
●
The crowd salutes the tsar and his bride-to-be. What Belsky and 
Rimsky-Korsakov deliver here is an acid-dripping parody of the stock-
in-trade “Glory” (or “Slava”) chorus that had been standard in Russian 
opera since Glinka. The chorus itself would seem to be suitably joyful 
and magnificent, but the parody is in the words. The chorus sings: 
“We are your loyal serfs, happy to serve, / And happy to kiss the tsar’s 
feet!”
●
●
Belsky and Rimsky-Korsakov were being neither ironic nor cynical 
about the Russian people; they knew perfectly well that given the 
events of January 1905, the Russian common people were no longer 
happy. This text reflects the wishful thinking of the tsar himself, his 
conviction that his “people” had no other purpose than to serve their 
tsar. 
●
●
The tsar is now approached by the astrologer, who reminds him of his 
earlier promise to give the astrologer anything he wanted. Of course, 
the astrologer wants the queen. After a brief argument, the tsar hits 
the astrologer over the head with his scepter and dashes out his 
brains. 
●
●
The queen of Shemakha thinks this is the funniest thing she’s ever 
seen. The tsar, stunned by what he has just done, asks, “Did I kill him?” 
The queen replies: “That’s how to do it! You can’t coddle them. / That’s 
what serfs are for: / If we don’t like them, we flatten them!”

Lecture 18—Rimsky-Korsakov: The Golden Cockerel (1907) 
●
●
The queen then signals the Golden Cockerel, which flies down from 
its perch and pecks the tsar to death. The queen laughs insanely, 
lightning and thunder strike, the stage is plunged into darkness, and 
when the lights come up, the queen and the cockerel are gone. 
●
●
Numb with despair, the crowd sees that the tsar is dead and asks: 
“What will the new day bring? / How can we exist without the tsar?”
Artistic Choices
●
●
In his preface to the score of the opera, Belsky credits the story to 
Aleksandr Pushkin, and traces Pushkin’s story back to various Russian 
fairytales. But Pushkin’s 1834 poem entitled “The Tale of the Golden 
Cockerel” was, in fact, based on two chapters from a collection of 
stories published by Washington Irving. In truth, The Golden Cockerel 
had nothing to do with deep Russian folk roots and everything to do 
with current events. 
●
●
Pushkin’s story is fairly brief, and its characters are minimally 
developed. Thus, in creating the opera, Rimsky-Korsakov and Belsky 
had to flesh out the story and the characters.
●
●
In doing so, they added highly politicized material, shaped by current 
events that had brought the Russian military to its knees and nearly 
cost Tsar Nicholas II his throne. The opera is a satirical denunciation 
of Tsar Nicholas II, his family, the aristocracy, and the government; 
a blunt censure of the Russian military; and a biting mockery of the 
traditional obedience of the Russian people. 
Historical Background
●
●
Aleksandr Nikolayevich Romanov was born on April 29, 1818, in 
Moscow. In 1855, he was crowned Tsar Alexander II, and he proved to 
be a fairly enlightened ruler. 
151

Music as a Mirror of History
152
●
●
In 1861, Alexander emancipated the Russian serfs. He reorganized the 
Russian judiciary, abolished capital punishment, encouraged local self-
government, and promoted education. 
●
●
On March 12, 1881, Alexander and his advisors completed plans for 
the election of a Russian parliament, or Duma. The announcement 
of this reform was scheduled for March 14, 1881.
●
●
But the announcement was never made because on March 13, 1881, 
a bomb was thrown between Alexander’s legs by a revolutionary. 
His death later that day was witnessed by his son, Alexander III, 
and his grandson, Nicholas II.
●
●
Alexander’s liberal reforms died with him. Violent suppression 
immediately did away with anything resembling personal freedom for 
the great majority of Russians.
War with Japan 
●
●
Over the years, many attempts had been made to open up Japan 
to trade, but all of them were rebuffed. However, in 1853—two years 
before Alexander II became tsar—Commodore Matthew C. Perry 
of the U.S. Navy arrived in Japan with his fleet of Black Ships and 
informed the Japanese that it was time to open trade with the West. 
●
●
Within 18 months, Japan had established diplomatic relations, 
friendship treaties, and trade agreements with both the United States 
and Great Britain. It also assimilated Western ideas, technology, and 
culture. By the late 19th century, Japan had become a modern industrial 
state, powerful enough to preserve its sovereignty. 
●
●
Meanwhile, Russia had been expanding eastward throughout the 
second half of the 19th century. In 1898, Russia coerced the Chinese 
government into leasing to Russia the region and harbor of Port 
Arthur at the southern tip of the Liaodong Peninsula, just west of 
Korea. The Russians quickly built a rail line joining Port Arthur to the 
Trans-Siberian Railroad.

Lecture 18—Rimsky-Korsakov: The Golden Cockerel (1907) 
●
●
Russia militarized Port Arthur and began encroaching on Korea, which 
the Japanese considered as being within their sphere of influence. 
Japan severed diplomatic relations with Russia on February 6, 1904, 
and declared war two days later. However, the Japanese Imperial 
Navy staged a sneak attack against the Russian Far East Fleet at Port 
Arthur three hours before declaring war. 
●
●
Port Arthur was besieged and captured, and the Russian Far 
East Fleet was almost entirely destroyed. Russian forces suffered 
shocking defeats to the Japanese in Manchuria, as well. The crowning 
blow came on May 27 and 28, 1905, when the Russian Baltic Fleet, 
consisting of 38 ships, met the Japanese fleet in the Tsushima Strait 
in the Sea of Japan. The Russians lost 4,380 dead and 5,917 captured, 
along with 34 ships. Humiliated, Russia sued for peace. 
●
●
For Russia and the tsar, the war with Japan was an unmitigated 
disaster. In 15 months, the Russian navy had been largely destroyed 
and the Russian army routed. The people of Russia now perceived the 
tsar and his military leadership as bumbling, doddering fools. 
Events on the Russian Home Front
●
●
Even as the military disaster was unfolding, equally disastrous events 
were taking place on the Russian home front, including strikes, 
protests, riots, and the emergence of political parties aimed at 
overthrowing the monarchy. 
●
●
On January 16, 1905, a strike was called at the Putilov plant in St. 
Petersburg, which manufactured railway supplies, artillery, and 
munitions. Within days, workers from 382 other factories were on 
strike. By January 21, 1905, St. Petersburg was effectively shut down, 
with no electricity, newspapers, or public services.
●
●
On Sunday, January 22, 1905, an Orthodox priest named Georgy 
Gapon led a procession to the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg to 
deliver a petition to the tsar. Troops opened fire, killing somewhere 
153

Music as a Mirror of History
154
The catalyst for revolution 
on the home front was the 
obliteration of the Russian 
Far East Fleet and the 
surrender of Port Arthur; 
the majority of the Russian 
people no longer believed 
in the tsar, his government, 
or his military. 

Lecture 18—Rimsky-Korsakov: The Golden Cockerel (1907) 
between 200 and 1,000 of the marchers. The events of Bloody Sunday 
began the active phase of the first Russian Revolution.
●
●
General strikes were declared across the empire. On January 26, 80 
strikers were killed in Riga; in Warsaw, 100 strikers were killed. By 
February, the strikes had reached the Caucasus; by April, the Urals 
and beyond. 
●
●
The military was affected, as well. The destruction of the Far East and 
Baltic fleets provoked mutinies across the empire. More than 2,000 
sailors were killed in the process of putting down these revolts.
●
●
The tsar and his government were shaken to the core. Sweeping 
reforms were offered that satisfied all but the most extreme 
revolutionaries, and the revolution petered out. 
Rimsky-Korsakov’s Reaction
●
●
Along with students across the empire, those at the St. Petersburg 
Conservatory, where Rimsky-Korsakov taught, demanded political 
reform and a constitutional monarchy. The administration threatened 
to shut down the conservatory. Rimsky-Korsakov threw his support 
behind the students.
●
●
On March 19, 1905, the 61-year-old Rimsky-Korsakov was fired, and 
a few days after that, the police banned performances of his music. 
More than 300 conservatory students and several key faculty 
members walked out in support of the composer. In December 1905, 
Rimsky-Korsakov was reinstated. He was not mollified, however, and 
he retired permanently a few months later. 
●
●
Rimsky-Korsakov had told everyone that his opera The Legend of the 
Invisible City of Kitezh and the Maiden Fevroniya was his last. But having 
left the conservatory, current events inspired him to compose one more: 
The Golden Cockerel. Its principal character is a clueless, doddering 
autocrat named Tsar Dodon, which literally means “Tsar Dodo.”
155

Music as a Mirror of History
156
The ban on performances of 
Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov’s work 
provoked an international response; 
letters in support of the composer 
poured in from around the world.

Holst: Ode to Death (1919)
I
n Western Europe, the fighting of World War I began on August 2, 
1914, when Germany occupied Luxembourg, then invaded Belgium. 
The German battle plan was to envelop the French army in a pincer, 
and it almost worked. But the French and British opened up a 30-mile 
gap between two German armies, which then retreated northward and 
dug in. The battles that stopped the German advance came to be known 
as the Miracle on the Marne, but for the participants, there was nothing 
miraculous about it. The British Expeditionary Force was essentially 
destroyed, and it would take England some 20 months to once again field 
an army large enough to make a difference on the western front. 
Gustav Holst
●
●
At the time that World War I broke out, Gustav Theodore Holst was 
the director of music at the St. Paul’s Girls’ School in west London. 
●
●
Although he was nearly 40 years old, Holst immediately volunteered 
for military service. He was mortified when he was rejected on medical 
grounds. But if couldn’t fight, he could at least compose.
●
●
Among his most personal and haunting works is one he wrote in 
August 1919. Entitled Ode to Death and set for chorus and orchestra, 
the work was motivated by the waste and futility of war and 
dedicated to the memory of his friends and colleagues who had died 
in battle. The text is by the American poet Walt Whitman. The words 
are exquisitely calm and accepting. Holst’s setting of these words is 
likewise luminous and mysterious.

Walt Whitman’s “When Lilacs

The Somme and the English War Experience
●
●
On July 1, 1916, at 7:30 a.m., after a week-long Allied bombardment, 
11 British divisions—some 110,000 men—climbed out of their trenches 
along a 13-mile-wide front and began advancing forward in a series of 
waves. 
●
●
The 6 German divisions facing them had spent the bombardment 
harbored deep underground. Within a minute of the end, they carried 
their machine guns topside and opened fire on their attackers. The 
young English troops were mowed down like grass. 
●
●
The disaster was in part the result of dismal military intelligence: 
Neither the British commander nor any of his staff or planners had 
an inkling that the German dugouts were as deep as they were and 
that the German machine gunners could get into position as quickly 
as they did. 
●
●
Further, the British attack plan displayed an unbelievable lack of 
imagination. Why attack in full daylight? Why not attack using a 
creeping barrage, in which the attacking infantry would follow the 
artillery as it slowly moved toward the German lines? Why not stop 
the artillery barrage for two minutes, then resume, thus catching the 
defenders out in the open?
●
●
Strong arguments have been made that for all its horrors, the Somme 
offensive taught the Allies how to wage mass industrial warfare by 
coordinating their assets: artillery, air power, armor, and infantry. It has 
also been observed that in a war of attrition, it was necessary for the 
Allies—who could field many more soldiers—to take the war to the 
Germans. 
●
●
It is also true that over the four months of the offensive, the 
Germans lost more irreplaceable frontline troops than did the Allies. 
●
●
But the cost was horrific. On July 1, 1916, the first day of the Battle 
of the Somme, the British alone suffered 57,470 casualties—19,240 
of whom were killed outright. 
159

Music as a Mirror of History

●
●
For the English, this “sacrifice of the innocents,” which was repeated 
at numerous other battles, led to a loss of national innocence. This 
loss found its outlet in poetry to a degree unique in the history of 
Western warfare. 
●
●
The conflict between traditional English values and the brutal, 
pitiless modernity of 20th-century warfare created an ironic edge 
that seemed to find its best description in poetry. Many of the 
English war poets died in action, among them Edward Thomas, 
Isaac Rosenberg, Charles Sorley, John McCrae, and Wilfred Owen. 
Others, including Ivor Gurney, Robert Graves, and Siegfried 
Sassoon, survived, though they were forever scarred by their 
wartime experiences. 
●
●
Perhaps the most powerful are the poems that address what came 
to be called the Big Lie, a lie expressed in a Latin verse by the 
Roman poet Horace that every English schoolboy knew by heart: 
Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori: “It is sweet and right to die 
for your country.”
●
●
Holst’s text for Ode to Death is drawn from Walt Whitman’s 
poem “When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom’d.” The poem 
was written in the summer of 1865; it is an elegy to President 
Abraham Lincoln, who had been shot on the evening of April 14, 
1865. Whitman’s poem is also a requiem for all the dead of the 
American Civil War, which had ended just days before Lincoln’s 
assassination. 
●
●
After the opening of Ode to Death, Holst sets the following lines 
dramatically but not hysterically: 
Prais’d be the fathomless universe, 
For life and joy, and for objects and knowledge curious, 
And for love, sweet love—but praise! Praise! Praise! 
For the sure-enwinding arms of cool-enfolding death.
●
●
The dominant impression here is one of irony, as the chorus 
mockingly intones, “Praise! Praise! Praise!”

Gustav Holst’s Ode to Death

Beginning of World War I
●
●
World War I was triggered by the assassination of Archduke Franz 
Ferdinand, the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, on June 28, 1914. 
The killing took place in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia. From the 
beginning, Serbia was suspected—rightly, as it turned out—of being 
behind the assassination. Serbia was the growing power in the Balkan 
region, and with the support of Russia, the Serbian government was 
intent on creating a greater Slavic homeland out of the formerly 
Ottoman lands of the Balkan Peninsula. 
●
●
For the Serbians, those lands included Bosnia, which had been 
annexed by Austria in 1908. 
●
●
For itself, Russia had its eyes on Constantinople, the capital city of 
the ever-weakening Ottoman Empire and, with it, the Dardanelles 
and the Bosporus, the so-called Turkish Straits or Black Sea Straits. 
Russian acquisition of the straits would guarantee it all-weather 
access to the Mediterranean and to foreign markets worldwide. 
●
●
In October 1912, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Sazonov, spelled 
out Russia’s intentions regarding Constantinople in a lengthy 
memorandum. According to Sazonov, Russia—still smarting from its 
defeat to Japan in 1905—could regain its lost prestige and change 
the geopolitical map of Europe and the Middle East by conquering 
Constantinople. 
●
●
The traditional explanation for Russia’s entry into World War I was its 
desire to protect Serbia from Austria. But in truth, the assassination 
of Archduke Ferdinand by Serbian operatives was intended as a 
provocation—an attempt to start a third Balkan war in as many years. 
●
●
According to Russian strategists, Austria would have no choice but 
to launch a punitive attack on Serbia, which would provide Russia 
with a pretext for going to war with Austria. 
●
●
If Germany chose to honor its treaties with Austria and threaten 
Russia, France and England would be compelled to honor their 
treaties with Russia against Germany. 

Lecture 19—Holst: Ode to Death (1919) 
●
●
Again, according to Russian planners, France and England would 
neutralize Germany, leaving Russia free to demolish Austria-
Hungary and partition the Ottoman Empire.
●
●
Unfortunately, the plan didn’t work, and the conflagration that was 
unleashed destroyed the German, Austrian, Ottoman, and Russian 
empires. 
Blame for World War I
●
●
That Germany “started” World War I by itself is one of the enduring 
myths of the war, but as we’ve just noted, much of the blame for 
World War I rests with Russia. 
●
●
Another myth of World War I is that it didn’t have to happen. This 
view is summed up by the title of Christopher Clark’s book The 
Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914. “The sleepwalkers” 
refers to those European leaders who, presumably, wandered 
unconsciously into war.
●
●
This view, however, doesn’t seem convincing. The world didn’t go to 
war because its leaders were asleep on the job; it went to war because 
the leadership did not truly understand that 20th-century technology 
and geopolitical reality had rendered 19th-century concepts of land 
grabs, diplomacy, and military action obsolete. 
●
●
Like the medieval kingdoms from which they had evolved, the majority 
of the dynastic monarchies in Europe concentrated too much power 
in too few hands, while the bureaucracies below slowly implemented 
decisions made from above. In addition, Great Power diplomacy, which 
saw each power formulate policy independent of others, encouraged 
distrust even among allies, and it required time. In the month that 
followed the assassination in Sarajevo, Euro-diplomacy could not keep 
up with events as they unfolded. 
●
●
The crisis reached its head on July 23, 1914, when Austria-Hungary—in 
collusion with Germany—delivered to Serbia what is now known as 
163

Music as a Mirror of History
164
the July Ultimatum—10 demands that were calculated to force Serbia 
into war with Austria. 
●
●
Of the 10 demands, numbers 5 and 6 were considered—at the 
time—to be the most irreconcilable with Serbian sovereignty. 
●
●
Point 5 demanded that Serbia cooperate with Austria-Hungary in 
suppressing organizations hostile to Austria-Hungary, and point 6 
insisted that Austria-Hungary participate in the official investigation 
of the assassination. 
●
●
The biggest problem with the ultimatum was that for all its denials, 
Serbia was culpable for the murders in Sarajevo. Austria, in collusion 
with its ally Germany, drew up the ultimatum knowing that Serbia 
could not accept it. To no one’s surprise, Serbia did indeed reject 
the ultimatum. 
●
●
On July 28, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. One after the 
other, treaty obligations forced other nations into declarations of 
war. Austria expected to quickly crush the Serbians. Russia expected 
to quickly crush the Austrians and the Ottoman Turks. Germany 
expected to quickly humble France, then turn its full might against 
Russia. England expected to use its navy to blockade Germany and, 
thus, obviate the need to put significant numbers of English boots 
on the ground. Every one of the belligerents expected the war to be 
over by Christmas.
●
●
World War I was a confrontation between the old and the new, 
between the past and the present. It was a confrontation that had been 
brewing since 1648, when the Peace of Westphalia that concluded the 
Thirty Years’ War created sovereign nation-states beholden only to 
their own self-interests; a confrontation that had been brewing as a 
result of the Scientific Revolution of the 17th century and made almost 
inevitable by the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century. 
●
●
The technology of war had advanced exponentially, while diplomacy, 
military tactics, and strategic thinking had not. The rulers of Europe 
were still thinking as they had thought 100 years before, during the 
Napoleonic era, when relatively small, relatively lightly armed troops 

Lecture 19—Holst: Ode to Death (1919) 
fought for a week or even a month, until an outcome was achieved 
and treaties were signed. 
The Conclusion of Ode to Death
●
●
The final verse of Holst’s Ode to Death sets this stanza by Whitman:
Over the tree-tops I float thee a song,
Over the rising and sinking waves, over the 
Myriad fields and prairies wide,
Over the dense-pack’d cities all and the
Teeming wharves and ways,
I float this carol with joy, with joy to thee O
Death. 
●
●
Holst’s setting of this final verse takes a double cue from the first 
line of Whitman’s stanza. The first cue is the word float. Holst creates 
here a musical sense of floating by using a progression of relatively 
consonant though unrelated harmonies. Because they are unrelated—
meaning that each one implies a different key area—there is no sense 
of tonal centricity and, therefore, no sense of tonal gravity. Thus, the 
music seems to float.
●
●
The second musical cue Holst takes from Whitman’s line is the word 
song. Holst sets this final stanza of poetry as a serenade-like song, with 
a strumming, guitar-like accompaniment in the harp and a steady beat.
●
●
This is heartbreaking music, made so by its gentle, quiet sweetness. 
There is no rage here. Neither is there any intimation of the 
unspeakable violence that has brought about death nor any patriotic 
message that would offer consolation in the face of death. 
●
●
It is music that leaves us with no emotional refuge with which to 
legitimize or rationalize the cause of death. We are left only with the 
impressions of passing into a place unknowable and of terrible waste, 
a perfect metaphor for World War I itself.

Berg: Wozzeck (1922)
J
ohann Franz Wozzeck, the title character and protagonist of Alban 
Berg’s opera, is a 37-year-old militia man. He is also slowly going insane, 
something we become aware of early in the first act, when he begins 
to hallucinate. The disconcerting scene ends with Wozzeck’s words: “Still, 
all is still, and all the world is dead.” Composed during and after World 
War I, this scene reflects not just the damaged mind of Wozzeck but also 
that of a doomed generation. According to musicologist Glenn Watkins, 
“This scene is as vivid a projection of impending world doom as any to 
come out of the Great War.” 
The Case of Johann Christian Woyzeck
●
●
On August 24, 1821, a Leipzig-based anatomist and surgeon named 
Johann August Clarus was asked to report on the mental condition of 
a confessed murderer named Johann Christian Woyzeck. The 41-year-
old Woyzeck was a Leipzig-born wigmaker and barber who had 
enlisted in the army. He had been living with a widow named Johanna 
Christiane Woost. 
●
●
Woyzeck had killed Christiane in a fit of jealous rage, and the Leipzig 
court wanted Dr. Clarus to determine whether Woyzeck was of sound 
mind when he committed the murder. Dr. Clarus determined that 
Woyzeck was indeed accountable for his actions, despite the fact 
the he suffered from hallucinations. His reports on Woyzeck were 
published in book form. 
●
●
Woyzeck was guillotined on August 27, 1824. Both he and Dr. Clarus’s 
book would likely have been forgotten forever had the book not been 
discovered by a young medical student named Karl Georg Büchner. 
Lecture 
20

Lecture 20—Berg: Wozzeck (1922) 
An aspiring playwright, Büchner used Dr. Clarus’s book as the 
basis for a play entitled Woyzeck. But Büchner died in 1837, leaving 
Woyzeck unfinished. Over the years, the play has been “finished” by 
a number of authors and editors, becoming one of the most popular 
and influential plays in the German theatrical repertoire.
Synopsis of Wozzeck
●
●
Franz Wozzeck is an insignificant, impoverished, inarticulate common 
soldier garrisoned in a German town. He lives with a woman named 
Marie, who is the mother of an illegitimate child. Wozzeck is tormented 
by the captain he serves and abused by a sadistic doctor. He is an 
everyman/antihero, being driven mad by everyone around him. 
●
●
Bored with Wozzeck, Marie has an affair with a handsome drum major, 
who beats up Wozzeck when confronted. Humiliated and bloodied, 
driven by hallucinations and jealousy, Wozzeck kills Marie and, in most 
versions of the story, drowns himself. 
●
●
Both Büchner’s play and Berg’s opera offer up a vision of a violent, 
oppressive, irrational world populated with violent, oppressive, 
predatory people, a world in which only Wozzeck—for all his 
hallucinatory, homicidal rage—is sane by comparison. 
Alban Berg
●
●
Alban Berg was born in Vienna on February 9, 1885. At the age of 19, 
he began composition lessons with the Viennese modernist Arnold 
Schoenberg. In just seven years, Berg went from knowing next to 
nothing about the technical workings of music to being one of the 
most technically polished and brilliantly original composers of all time. 
●
●
Berg’s originality was rooted in his adaptation of the ultra-modernist 
musical dogma of Schoenberg to his own artistic needs. 
●
●
Schoenberg’s music was based on a single belief: that all music 
sprang from the voice and, therefore, from melody. To that end, 
167

Music as a Mirror of History
168
Schoenberg set out to create a musical syntax based entirely on 
melody and melodic variation, development, and metamorphosis. 
●
●
He rejected traditional tonal harmony as an artificial construct 
that did nothing but constrain melody. He rejected the traditional 
concepts of consonance and dissonance as antithetical to 
free melodic development. Schoenberg called his musical 
revolution the “emancipation of dissonance,” but it was really the 
emancipation of melody.
●
●
What makes Berg’s music so special is the manner in which 
he absorbed Schoenberg’s concepts without abandoning the 
lyric aesthetic of Viennese music and without abandoning—
entirely—tonal harmony. Berg’s music acknowledges the past as it 
simultaneously looks to the future.
Berg’s Wozzeck
●
●
On May 5, 1914, the 29-year-old Berg attended the first Viennese 
performance of Büchner’s Woyzeck. He immediately decided to turn 
it into an opera, but shortly thereafter, World War I began, changing 
Berg’s view on the meaning and substance of the play.
●
●
Berg was called up into the Austro-Hungarian army on August 15, 1915. 
He never saw combat but, instead, served behind the lines. His military 
experience alternated drudgery and boredom with manic activity, all 
of it enforced by arbitrary or even degrading discipline. Berg’s army 
life left him with an understanding of the random, ego-destroying 
tyranny of the military and supplied him with various experiences that 
found their way into Wozzeck. 
●
●
Because of his service, Berg didn’t return to composing Wozzeck 
until 1917, and he didn’t finish it until 1922. That five-year period saw 
the war end and the casualties totaled up; it saw the treaties signed 
and the German and Austro-Hungarian empires broken up; and it saw 
communist revolutions break out in Germany and Austria. Such events 
profoundly affected the composition of Wozzeck. 

Lecture 20—Berg: Wozzeck (1922) 
●
●
World War I lasted from July 28, 1914, to November 11, 1918. During that 
period, of 65 million men mobilized, casualties—men killed, wounded, 
taken prisoner, or missing—totaled 37 million. At least 7 million 
civilians died, as well. The war represented an unprecedented descent 
into barbarity, causing many to question and even lose faith in the 
basic civility of modern humanity.
The War That Never Ended
●
●
Numerous explanations have been offered for the rise of Adolf Hitler 
and the Nazi Party in the 1920s and early 1930s. 
●
●
Chief among those was the botched Treaty of Versailles that ended 
the war between Germany and the Allied powers. But it wasn’t 
the peace that unleashed the dual catastrophes of fascism and 
Bolshevism; it was the war itself. 
●
●
The war desensitized—in some cases, dehumanized—a generation 
of young European men. The victors had, at least, the satisfaction 
of knowing that their cause had prevailed. But the losers—Germany, 
Austria-Hungary, Russia, and Turkey—could take solace in nothing. 
Communist revolutions broke out in Russia, Germany, and Austria; 
the revolution in Russia succeeded, while the ones in Germany and 
Austria were crushed. 
●
●
The Treaty of Versailles was signed on June 28, 1919, five years after 
the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Many forward-looking 
thinkers, including the English economist John Maynard Keynes, 
understood at the time that the treaty was too harsh and would be 
counterproductive in the long run. 
●
●
At the core of the problem with the treaty was Article 231, the so-
called war guilt article. The article read: “The Allied Governments 
affirm and Germany accepts the responsibility for causing all the loss 
and damage to which the Allied Governments and their nationals have 
been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon them by 
the aggression of Germany and her allies.”
169

Music as a Mirror of History
170
●
●
The authors of this article intended it as legal justification for the 
ruinous war indemnity that was billed to Germany. For the Germans, 
Article 231 was a national humiliation; coupled with the reparations, 
territorial concessions, and disarmament, the Versailles Treaty neither 
reconciled Germany with the Allies nor pacified what was still a largely 
military society. 
●
●
It’s important to note that German propaganda had not prepared the 
German people for defeat. Those military and political leaders who 
were responsible for the defeat claimed that Germany—“undefeated 
in the field”—had been stabbed in the back by left-wing politicians, 
communists, and Jews. 
●
●
For the victors, the armistice marked the end of the nightmare. But for 
Germans and Austrians, the end of the war brought a new nightmare: 
revolution. The Bolsheviks, having consolidated their power in Russia, 
were now actively fomenting revolution across Central Europe. 
Working-class revolutionary groups attempted to seize power in 
Berlin, Warsaw, Vienna, and elsewhere. 
●
●
As it turned out, the counterrevolutionary right was much too 
strong for the revolutionaries. Soldiers returning from the front were 
organized into Freikorps, right-wing paramilitary units aimed at 
crushing the revolutionary movements. The members of the Freikorps 
were to become the backbone of Hitler’s support as he rose to 
prominence in the 1920s.
Hypocrisy
●
●
World War I rendered many longstanding beliefs about chivalry, fair 
play, honor, glory, and heroism obsolete. It was a faceless war, during 
which combatants rarely if ever saw who they were fighting. For the 
millions trapped in the trenches, such abstractions as patriotism and 
national duty gave way to the realities of brutality, disillusionment, 
and hypocrisy. 

Lecture 20—Holst: Ode to Death (1919) 
171
●
●
Neutral Belgium continues to this day to be portrayed as a victim, an 
innocent nation that stood up against the German war machine and 
paid the price in blood and occupation. But Belgium’s actions in its 
colonies were anything but innocent. In the decades before World 
War I, Belgian authorities were responsible for the enslavement, 
mutilation, and slaughter of some 10 million human beings in the 
Congo in their pursuit of rubber, copper, gold, and diamonds. 
●
●
England and France both claimed that they were fighting in 
defense of democracy, but as was noted at the time, democracy 
was not observed in either their colonies or by their ally Russia. 
●
●
America’s entry into the war in 1917 was presumably intended to 
make the world safe for democracy. But in fact, America’s entry 
was primarily about protecting its investments. U.S. financial 
institutions and industry had provided Britain and France with 
billions of dollars in cash, credit, and materiel. By 1917, Britain and 
France were broke, and defeat would have meant default. Thus, 
when Germany lifted all restrictions on submarine warfare in 1917, 
the hawks in the business community were more than prepared to 
make the world safe for the American dollar.
Fought from the trenches In 
Western Europe, World War I 
was a faceless war; according 
to British statistics. a stunning 
59 percent of all British deaths 
were caused by artillery. 

Music as a Mirror of History
172
●
●
When it came to leadership during World War I, there were no 
innocents. 
●
●
Austria-Hungary had started the war by attacking Serbia. Germany 
declared its support of Austria, then attacked Luxembourg, 
Belgium, and France. Russia, believing the moment had come to 
vivisect the remnants of the Ottoman Empire, declared its support 
of its fellow Slavs in Serbia, invaded Austria-Hungary, and prepared 
to do battle with Germany. 
●
●
France entered, declaring its allegiance to Belgium and Russia, 
and England entered, declaring its support of Belgium and France. 
Within a few days, the European peace that had generally held 
since 1815 unraveled entirely. 
●
●
Within a few months, the war had become a brutal stalemate. The 
issue of whoever started it became irrelevant as the belligerents 
were all faced with the same choice: Continue to sacrifice men by the 
millions or negotiate a settlement. But not a single belligerent nation 
was willing to admit to the futility of it all; thus, the war continued. 
Wozzeck: The Dance of Death
●
●
Without doubt, the indignities of Berg’s military experience influenced 
his portrayal of Wozzeck. But, as Christopher Hailey, wrote, “far more 
important is the evidence this opera provides for Berg’s capacity for 
empathy, for reaching across the chasms of circumstance toward 
those common bonds of humanity.” 
●
●
Berg’s empathy for Wozzeck becomes viscerally powerful during 
the climactic scene of the opera: the nightmarish dance-of-death 
episode, during which Wozzeck’s madness finally becomes apparent 
to everyone. 
●
●
In this scene, Wozzeck stumbles into a bar, his hands and arms covered 
in Marie’s blood. In the bar, Marie’s friend “Margret and young men are 
dancing a wild, rapid polka.” As Wozzeck enters, a bizarre piano polka 
creates a grotesque, distorted, almost cubist environment. We are 

Lecture 20—Berg: Wozzeck (1922) 
hearing Wozzeck’s mind, in which the planes of reality have become 
skewed and disconnected.
●
●
Wozzeck then dances a few steps with Margret before sitting at a 
table and pulling her into his lap. Margret, assuming that Wozzeck 
is drunk, sings a distorted, twisted song. It finally begins to dawn on 
Margret that something is wrong with Wozzeck. She points out that 
his hands are covered in blood, and Wozzeck is stunned. Speaking 
more to himself than anyone else he asks, “Am I a murderer?”
●
●
Wozzeck runs into the forest, where he wades into a deep pool of 
water, thinking to wash himself clean of Marie’s blood. But he simply 
keeps walking until he disappears under the water and drowns. 
●
●
Driven mad by forces he cannot control or even understand, Wozzeck 
killed the two most vulnerable characters in the opera: Marie and 
himself. As for those whose actions drove Wozzeck mad—the captain, 
the doctor, and the drum major—there are no repercussions. We 
suspect that they will hardly even notice Wozzeck’s absence.

Shostakovich: Symphony No. 13 (1962)
D
mitri Dmitriyevich Shostakovich was born on September 
25, 1906, in St. Petersburg, which was then the capital city 
of the Russian Empire. He died on August 9, 1975, in Moscow, 
the capital city of the Soviet Union. He was a witness to the birth 
of the Soviet Union and subsequently lived in an environment that 
Westerners can hardly imagination. Like so many artists in the Soviet 
Union, Shostakovich publically said that his work meant one thing while 
privately acknowledging that it meant something else. At the heart of 
Shostakovich’s secret expressive language were satire and irony, with 
which the fifth movement of his Symphony no. 13 veritably oozes.
Shostakovich as a Careerist
●
●
Shostakovich’s Symphony no. 13 is a setting of a poem by the Russian 
poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko. The poem, entitled “Career,” begins by 
telling the story of Galileo, who the Catholic clergy claimed to be both 
wicked and senseless. 
●
●
The poem acknowledges that Galileo was senseless by insisting 
that the earth revolved around the sun. In contrast, a colleague of 
his, who sought to advance his career, betrayed Galileo and denied 
what he knew to be true. 
●
●
As the poem trenchantly observes, instead of “advancing” his 
career, the turncoat destroyed it. As for Galileo, by facing the risk 
alone, he achieved true greatness. 
●
●
In the poem, Galileo is the poet, composer, playwright, author, and 
painter—the Soviet artist who had to walk the fine line between 
speaking the truth and personal obliteration. Those who lied, cheated,

Lecture 21—Shostakovich: Symphony No. 13 (1962) 
175
and betrayed others to 
get ahead were known 
in the Soviet world as 
careerists. 
●
●
It is ironic that some 
Western 
observers 
still 
claim 
that 
Dmitri Shostakovich 
was 
the 
ultimate 
careerist. 
Their 
evidence is his public 
actions: 
the 
anti-
Western articles and 
speeches attributed 
to him; the fact that 
he toed the party 
line 
whenever 
he 
was 
required 
to; 
that he abased and 
humiliated 
himself 
in 1936 and 1948 
to 
survive 
life-
threatening purges; and that he joined the Communist Party in 
1960 after having sworn that he would never do so.
●
●
But Shostakovich was no careerist; he was a survivor who somehow 
managed to die of natural causes at home rather than by a bullet 
to the neck at Lubyanka Prison or frozen to death in the wastes of 
the Gulag. 
The Thaw
●
●
Shostakovich’s Symphony no. 13 occupies a most interesting place 
in his output. It was composed during a period called the thaw that 
spanned the years 1956 to 1964: from the denunciation and repudiation 
of the recently deceased Joseph Stalin by Communist Party Secretary 
Nikita Khrushchev in 1956 to Khrushchev’s ouster in 1964. 
Like many Soviet citizens, Shostakovich led 
two different lives; his public life was that of 
a docile apparatchik, while in his private life, 
he could think and feel as he chose. 

Music as a Mirror of History
176
●
●
Joseph Stalin came to power in 1924 and remained the Soviet dictator 
until his death in 1953. He was a butcher who was responsible for the 
deaths of 50 million people—excluding war deaths—during his regime. 
Stalin could not have done it alone, however, and he surrounded 
himself with a cadre of ruthless goons and henchmen disguised as 
government officials. 
●
●
Among those henchmen was Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev. He 
was a short, round, peasant-born operative who did what he was 
told to do, which included serving as executioner. But he had a spark 
of greatness in him, a spark that compelled him to seek redress for 
the evils of Stalinism once he himself had come to power. Under 
Khrushchev, domestic repression and censorship were scaled back, 
and more than 1 million nonpolitical and political prisoners were 
released from the Gulag. 
●
●
Despite his proclaimed desire to pursue peaceful coexistence with 
the result of the world, Khrushchev’s tenure was marked by one crisis 
after another: the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956, the construction 
of the Berlin Wall in 1961, and the Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962. 
He was frightening to the West, yet for someone who had been part 
of Stalin’s inner circle, he was shockingly liberal.
●
●
When he was forced out of government in 1964 and the hardliners 
took back over, Khrushchev’s reforms were rescinded. But they were 
not forgotten, and the thaw initiated an irreversible psychological 
change in the Soviet Union. 
Shostakovich’s Symphony No. 13
●
●
Shostakovich composed his Symphony no. 13 in 1962. As mentioned, 
its five movements set to music five poems by Yevgeny Yevtushenko. 
The poems and the symphony were written during the most 
liberal period of the thaw; nevertheless, they were still extremely 
controversial.

Lecture 21—Shostakovich: Symphony No. 13 (1962) 
177
●
●
The poem that brought Yevtushenko to Shostakovich’s attention and 
gave the symphony its nickname is entitled “Babi Yar.” 
●
●
Babi Yar is a ravine on the outskirts of the Ukrainian capital of Kiev, 
where between 100,000 and 150,000 men, women, and children—
mostly Jews—were slaughtered between 1941 and 1943. 
●
●
In 1961, when “Babi Yar” was published, the Soviet government did 
not officially recognize the Holocaust as ever having taken place. 
Yevtushenko’s poem—which is an indictment of both Soviet anti-
Semitism and Nazi brutality—created a sensation. 
●
●
The manner of Shostakovich’s orchestration instills his Thirteenth 
Symphony with a sort of Russian timelessness. The symphony is 
scored for a large orchestra, bells, a solo bass singer, and a choir of 
basses. 
●
●
The bells create a powerfully Russian timbral sensibility—one that 
evokes the Orthodox Church and a sense of spiritual timelessness. 
●
●
The bass singers redouble that Russian sensibility; the deep 
male voices again call to mind the Orthodox Church, as well as 
the powerful, raw, masculine earthiness that we stereotypically 
associate with Russian music.
●
●
The first verse of the first movement states that although no memorial 
stands at Babi Yar, the ravine itself is nothing less than a crude 
tombstone, one that inspires a terrible, ancient fear, as old as the 
Jewish people themselves.
Russia Revisited
●
●
The nonstop expansion of the Russian Empire was a response to the 
nation’s endless border problems. Every time Russia expanded to 
pacify an area, it was exposed to attack from enemies living on the 
other side of its new borders. By 1900, Russia’s size had rendered 
it largely defenseless. In the west, Russian Poland was virtually 
indefensible should Germany or Austro-Hungary attack. If Poland fell, 
the Russians knew that they could say goodbye to both their influence 
in the Balkans and their ambitions to dismantle the Ottoman Empire.

●
●
Russia’s defeat at the hands of the Japanese almost brought down 
the Romanov dynasty and forced the tsar to accept the humiliating 
presence of an elected parliament. At the same time, German power 
and influence continued to grow, even as the Austrian and Ottoman 
empires appeared ever weaker.
●
●
Increasingly, Russian planners saw war—a war on Russian terms—as 
being the solution to all their problems. A defeated and chastened 
Germany would cease to be a threat; the Austrian and Ottoman 
empires could be dismantled, and more stable borders achieved; 
Russia could have its historically coveted warm-water port and 
would reestablish its power and prestige. As early as 1912, the Russian 
general staff had come up with a strategy for mobilizing Russian 
troops without setting off alarm bells across Western Europe. 
●
●
The Russian military acquitted itself poorly during the first two 
years of World War I. A few early successes against the Austrians 
were followed by a series of defeats at the hands of the Germans. 
The situation got so bad that on September 5, 1915, Tsar Nicholas II 
appointed himself commander-in-chief of the Russian military. From 
that point on, the Russian army’s failures and incompetence were 
blamed directly on the tsar.
●
●
Those failures came home in March 1917, when strikes, food riots, 
demonstrations, and mutinies broke out in the capital city of St. 
Petersburg (Petrograd). On March 15, the tsar abdicated, and on the 
following day a provisional government was formed. But it was too 
little, too late, and on November 8, 1917, the Bolshevik Party, led by 
Vladimir Lenin, took over Petrograd. Within a couple of days, they had 
taken over the Russian government.
●
●
On March 8, 1918, five days after having withdrawn from World War I, 
the Bolshevik Party changed its name to the Communist Party. Tsar 
Nicholas II and his family were murdered four months later, on July 17, 
1918.

According to Khrushchev, 
anyone who didn’t agree 
with Stalin was “an enemy 
of the people.”

Music as a Mirror of History

●
●
Fourteen months after that—in September 1919—the 13-year-old 
Dmitri Shostakovich was enrolled in the Petrograd Conservatory. Even 
as Shostakovich attended classes, events were unfolding that would 
shape the rest of his life. 
●
●
Shostakovich was 15 years old when, on April 3, 1922, Joseph Stalin 
was appointed general secretary of the Communist Party. He was 
17 when, on January 21, 1924, Vladimir Lenin died. 
●
●
In 1925, Shostakovich was 18 years old and working on his first 
symphony when Stalin was in the process of dividing, isolating, and 
destroying anyone who opposed him. 
●
●
By 1927, Stalin was the all-powerful dictator of the Soviet Union. He 
achieved this by presenting himself as the one thing the Russian 
masses craved most: a savior. But he was no savior, and the human 
cost of his failures and successes in the name of progress beggar the 
imagination. 
●
●
In 1928, Stalin announced his first five-year plan. It called for 
centralized economic planning, nationalization of all business and 
industry, and agricultural collectivization. Collectivization, in particular, 
was a human and agricultural catastrophe. 
●
●
Even as events unfolded in the countryside, waves of repression 
and arrests were visited on the military, on industry, and in the 
cities. Writers, poets, journalists, playwrights, actors, politicians, and 
bureaucrats disappeared—anyone who might possibly criticize Stalin 
or his policies. Anyone could—at any point—become an enemy of the 
state.
●
●
Shostakovich’s turn came on January 28, 1936, when an unsigned 
editorial in Pravda—reportedly dictated by Stalin himself—condemned 
Shostakovich’s opera Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk as being obscene and 
antirevolutionary. The 29-year-old Shostakovich instantly became an 
outcast and lived in fear for the rest of his life. 

Lecture 21—Shostakovich: Symphony No. 13 (1962) 
181
●
●
At Shostakovich’s request, Yevtushenko wrote a poem called “Fears.” 
The poem is a rumination on the fears of the Stalinist past and an 
appreciation of the less fearful present. Shostakovich’s setting of the 
poem is brilliant. A low, rumbling, quivering orchestral introduction 
sets a dark, foreboding mood. When the voices enter, they are quiet, 
furtive, like the “ghosts of yesteryear” they describe.
The Thaw Revisited
●
●
Joseph Stalin died on March 5, 1953, and the power struggle began 
immediately. It took two years, but in the end, Nikita Khrushchev 
emerged victorious. 
●
●
Khrushchev’s famous secret speech was delivered at the 20th Party 
Congress in February 1956. In it, Stalin was portrayed as being “savage, 
half-mad and power-crazed.” In the four hours it took Khrushchev to 
deliver the speech, he demolished Stalin’s reputation.
●
●
The ensuing thaw reached its climax with the publication in 
November 1962 of Alexander Solzhenitsyn’s One Day in the Life of 
Ivan Denisovich and the premiere of Shostakovich’s Symphony no. 13 
in December 1962. The Soviet authorities did everything they could to 
undermine the symphony’s premiere, and it was banned outright after 
its second performance, but it had been heard, and its impact would 
not be forgotten. 
●
●
Sadly, the thaw was not to last. By 1964, Khrushchev’s failures had 
earned him many more enemies than friends. On October 12, 1964, he 
was denounced for his failed policies. 
Timing of the Thirteenth Symphony
●
●
Shostakovich’s Thirteenth Symphony could only have been composed 
when it was composed. It could not have been written 10 years 
earlier; Stalin and his people would have seen to it that Shostakovich 
disappeared. Neither could it have been composed 10 years later; 

Music as a Mirror of History
182
Brezhnev and his people would have seen to it that Shostakovich 
suffered an “accident” of some unspecified nature. 
●
●
What makes Shostakovich’s Symphony no. 13 truly special is that 
thanks to the thaw, he didn’t have to hide its true meaning: He used 
Yevtushenko’s poetry to openly and explicitly express himself. 
●
●
Taken all together, Symphony no. 13 is nothing less than a retrospective 
on the failures of Soviet communism. Its first movement, “Babi Yar,” 
is a condemnation of Soviet anti-Semitism. Its second movement—
“Humor”—is an affirmation that humor is, in the end, greater and more 
powerful than any temporal power. The poem observes that although 
all the great rulers of the world could command armies, they could 
never command humor. Shostakovich’s musical setting of the second 
movement is as rollicking, infectious, and defiant as humor itself.
●
●
The third movement, “In the Store,” is in praise of Russian women, 
who somehow managed to endure: to feed and clothe and support 
their families in the face of endemic want. The fourth movement 
is “Fear,” and the fifth is about the amoral careerism central to the 
communist bureaucracy. The symphony concludes whimsically, 
ironically, and quietly. 

183
Copland: Symphony No. 3 (1946)
A
aron Copland is the most famous and beloved American 
composer of the 20th century. Copland is best known for the 
accessible, populist works he composed in the 1930s and 1940s, 
including the ballets Billy the Kid, Appalachian Spring, and Rodeo; the 
Fanfare for the Common Man; and his Symphony no. 3. In the same 
way that the music of Joseph Haydn came to personify what we today 
consider the Viennese classical style, so these populist works by Copland 
have come to personify a sort of archetypal American music. His lean 
angularity, spaciousness, directness of expression, and studied simplicity 
tapped directly into the American self-image.
Copland and the American Archetype
●
●
Part of the American archetype found in the work of Aaron Copland 
has to do with his use of American folk songs in his ballets, the most 
famous example of which is his use of the Shaker hymn “Simple Gifts” 
in Appalachian Spring.
●
●
But in fact, it’s not Copland’s occasional use of folk tunes and folk-
like clichés that have caused his music to be identified as being 
stereotypically American; rather, it’s his melodic sensibility and—in his 
populist works—his harmonic usage.
●
●
For example, Copland based the fourth movement of his Symphony 
no. 3 of 1946 on his Fanfare for the Common Man of 1942. Typical of 
Copland’s thematic melodies, this one is exceedingly disjunct, which 
means that it is filled with leaps—wide-open melodic spaces.
Lecture 
22

Music as a Mirror of History
184
●
●
Copland harmonizes this melody not with complete chords 
(or triads) but, rather, primarily with perfect intervals—fourths 
and fifths—which give the harmonization a lean, stripped-down 
angularity. The harmonic underpinning implied here is excessively 
simple, consisting of just two alternating harmonies: a tonic chord 
and a subdominant chord.
●
●
Like the disjunct thematic melody, Copland’s harmonization creates a 
sense of wide-open space. This lean angularity, this spaciousness, this 
directness of expression and studied simplicity tapped directly into 
the American self-image. 
●
●
The great American myth tells us that the United States is the land 
of opportunity, urban dynamism, and open space, all informed 
by technical ingenuity and a can-do attitude. America is a nation 
characterized by a naïve, positive mentality devoid of the angst and 
tired cynicism of older European cultures. 
●
●
During the last years of the 19th century and the first years of the 
20th, the American mainstream—masters of a newly settled, newly 
industrialized continent with seemingly unlimited resources—saw 
themselves as the chosen ones, destined to bring the American way 
to the world at large. 
●
●
Never before or since was this sense of American exceptionalism 
more powerfully felt than in the years immediately after World War 
II. It’s true that there were dark clouds on America’s horizon in 1946 
and 1947, but that did not preclude the American self-image from 
reaching its apogee. The United States had emerged from the Great 
Depression as the arsenal of democracy. It had fought a “good 
war” and demolished evil regimes in Germany and Japan. American 
industrial might and economic power were unmatched, and unlike 
most of the belligerents, the American mainland was de facto 
unscathed by the war. 

Lecture 22—Copland: Symphony No. 3 (1946)

Blessings of the Western Hemisphere
●
●
Never was America’s geographic location a greater asset than during 
World War II. Although the U.S. military paid a high price during World 
War II, by comparison to almost every other belligerent, the United 
States survived the war not just physically intact but economically, 
industrially, and geopolitically stronger than when the war began. 
●
●
The American self-image at the conclusion of the war was not that 
of a vanquished foe, like Germany and Japan; it was not that of an 
exhausted victor, like the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, China, 
and France; it was that of a winner in every sense of the word. 
●
●
Aaron Copland’s Symphony no. 3 of 1946 is a heroic symphony that 
rides the crest of a series of great victories: over the Great Depression, 
over fascism and Japanese imperialism, and of the American spirit 
and the American way of life. 
The archetypal American 
hero contrasted mightily 
with the haughty, 
feminized sophistication 
of the French or the 
humorless, goose-stepping 
militancy of the Germans.

Background on Copland
●
●
Copland’s parents, Harris and Sarah, were Russian-born Jews who 
emigrated to the United States as children. They ran a successful 
department store in Brooklyn, New York, and were, according to 
Aaron, “impervious to music.”
●
●
Copland finished his musical education in France and returned to the 
United States in June 1924. He understood that to be an American 
composer meant writing music that somehow reflected and 
reconciled the diversity of American society. For Copland, that meant 
not just celebrating the spirit of the urban environment in which he 
grew up but absorbing the idiomatic elements of jazz and American 
and Latin American folk music. 
●
●
The masterwork of Copland’s early career is his Piano Variations of 
1930. The Piano Variations is a brilliant, energized, jagged, machine 
age–inspired, jazz-influenced modern masterpiece—the Manhattan 
skyline in musical action.
●
●
Just a few years later, however, Copland was writing music that 
apparently rejected modernism. Copland was dismissed by many as 
a turncoat and a profiteer, someone who wrote what amounted to 
“movie music” to acquire fame and fortune.
●
●
Despite the fact that stylistically, Copland appeared to be a 
compositional 
chameleon, 
his 
basic 
compositional 
thinking 
never changed. From roughly the mid-1930s through the 1940s, 
he simplified his compositional syntax by cutting back on its 
dissonance level and by using more traditional, more consonant-
sounding melodic and harmonic structures. 
●
●
But his angular, disjunct melodies; his extraordinarily “thrifty” 
aesthetic; and his predilection for jazz-inspired rhythms and 
Stravinsky-inspired rhythmic asymmetry—all the elements that 
inform his most modernistic works—are also the basis of his most 
accessible populist works.

The Great Depression and the Rise of American Populism
●
●
Between 1920 and September of 1929, the U.S. stock market 
experienced an unprecedented bull market. The Dow Jones Average 
increased tenfold in those years. In 1929, it was declared by economist 
Irving Fisher to be on “a permanently high plateau.” 
●
●
In reality, the American economy was in trouble: Steel production and 
car sales were down, construction was sluggish, and easy credit had 
led many American consumers and businesses to build up mountains 
of debt. 
●
●
The bubble burst on October 24, 1929—Black Thursday—when the 
market posted some $5 billion in losses. President Hoover, government 
officials, and financial institutions did what they could to calm the 
public.
●
●
However, on Monday, October 28, it became apparent that the 
pyramid was crumbling. The Dow fell 38 points that day. On October 
29—Black Tuesday—panic set in, and the market fell another 33 points. 
On those two days, the market lost more than $30 billion of its value.
●
●
A shaken American public sought security in cash. But the banks 
didn’t have enough cash on hand, and many simply closed their 
doors. As the money supply dried up, consumer spending dried up 
with it. Factories and stores scaled back or went out of business, all of 
which created unemployment. Taken together, the stock market crash 
and the depression that followed created a seemingly intractable 
downward financial spiral of stunning complexity. 
●
●
Franklin Delano Roosevelt was elected president on November 8, 
1932. By the time he was inaugurated on March 4, 1933, more than 
9,000 banks had gone out of business. Nearly 13 million American 
workers were unemployed. Farm prices had fallen by 60 percent since 
1929 and industrial production by almost as much. More than 2 million 
Americans were homeless. 

Music as a Mirror of History
188
●
●
Over the course of the next five years, the Roosevelt administration 
introduced a veritable mountain of programs and legislation that was 
collectively referred to as the New Deal. 
●
●
The largest and most ambitious New Deal project was the Works 
Progress Administration (WPA), whose primary mission was to hire 
the unemployed to carry out public works projects. It was created 
in 1935 with an initial appropriation of $4.9 billion dollars. At its 
height in 1938, the WPA employed more than 3 million men and 
women. Over the course of its eight years of existence—from 1935 
to 1943—it received $13.4 billion in funding. 
●
●
Thanks largely to Mrs. Roosevelt, the arts were also funded through 
the WPA. Of the $4.9 billion originally budgeted to the WPA, 
$27 million was allotted to the Federal Arts Project, of which about 
$7 million was used to fund the Federal Music Project (FMP). At 
its peak in 1939, the FMP employed more than 16,000 musicians 
and operated orchestras and chamber groups; choral and opera 
units; concert, military, and dance bands; and theater orchestras. 
It presented an estimated 5,000 performances before roughly 3 
million people every week. 
Fanfare for the Common Man 
●
●
There was a feeling among artists during the Depression—particularly 
those outside of academia—that the fine arts should have something 
to say to the common person. High art should offer solace, hope, 
joy, and revelation to a general population in short supply of those 
feelings. Copland was among those artists who held that conviction.
●
●
The advent of WPA-sponsored ensembles, concerts, and broadcasts 
dramatically increased the size of the music-listening public in the 
United States, though it was incumbent on composers to write 
comprehensible, even likable music if they wanted to keep their 
audience.
●
●
Copland’s Fanfare for the Common Man is one of the most important 
and enduring works of his populist compositional period. The piece 

Lecture 22—Copland: Symphony No. 3 (1946) 
189
was the brainchild of the music director and conductor of the 
Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, Eugene Goossens. In early 1942, 
Goossens asked 18 composers to write fanfares celebrating the war 
effort, all of which were premiered during the Cincinnati Symphony 
Orchestra’s 1942–1943 season.
●
●
By basing the fourth movement of his Symphony no. 3 on the Fanfare 
for the Common Man, Copland did three things: (1) He linked the 
symphony to the Great Depression–inspired populism of the 1930s; 
(2) he celebrated the victorious gallantry of the common citizen-
soldiers of the United States; and (3) he connected the symphony to 
one of the most popular (and profitable) works he had ever composed. 
Extinction
●
●
Even as Copland’s Third Symphony capped both an era of American 
history and his own experiments with musical populism, cultural 
and psychological changes were afoot that would render the work 
something of a dinosaur.
●
●
The end of hostilities ushered in a period that was much more 
politically and morally complex than the war itself. Once victory 
had been achieved, it was necessary to deal with the inconceivable 
enormity of what had happened. 
●
●
Between 65 and 80 million souls had perished in the war, huge 
swatches of the planet had been destroyed, whole populations were 
uprooted, and the nuclear age had been initiated. In 1945, the United 
States was still the only country to possess the bomb, but the nuclear 
cat was out of the bag, and it could never be put back in. 
●
●
The Red Army did not stand down at the end of the war, and it quickly 
became apparent that Joseph Stalin had no intention of honoring 
agreements made with the United States, Britain, and France. 
Everyone knew that it was only a matter of time before the Soviets 

Music as a Mirror of History
190
got the bomb, which would increase the likelihood of a third world 
war—a final world war. 
●
●
For the generation of composers for whom the war and its 
aftermath was the formative experience of their lives, such music as 
Copland’s Third Symphony—heroic, populist, and nationalist—was an 
abomination, representative of the spiritual and intellectual mindsets 
that had brought about the war in the first place. 
●
●
Many composers rejected musical nationalism and populism 
entirely. These postwar composers believed that only a clean break 
with the past—music purged of self-expressive egocentricity and 
nationalistic hubris—was appropriate to the atomic age. 
●
●
Most of the music these postwar modernists created is, in fact, 
unlistenable—music doomed by its own ugliness and expressive 
emptiness. But it is music that mirrors its time and place, a musical 
mirror of the postwar reality.
●
●
Thankfully, we are no longer weighed down by the artistic politics 
of the 1940s to 1960s, and thus, we require no persuasion to enjoy 
Copland’s symphony. It remains—by far—Copland’s longest and 
grandest work. As Copland wrote in his original program note: “[The 
work is] intended to reflect the euphoric spirit of the country at the 
time.” And that it does.

Górecki: Symphony No. 3 (1976)
O
n April 4, 1977, Henryk Górecki’s Third Symphony received its 
premiere at the Royan Festival of Contemporary Art in France. 
Founded in 1964, Royan was the place to go for those who 
wanted to hear the cutting edge of musical modernism. Imagine, then, 
the audience’s reaction when it heard a slowly unfolding, sublimely 
metaphysical, entirely tonal three-movement, 46-minute-long work 
for orchestra and soprano. A firestorm of controversy was unleashed, 
but all the Polish critics in the audience declared the symphony to be a 
masterwork. These critics understood that the piece was a mirror of the 
Polish experience of the mid-20th century, framed using poetry, historical 
allusions, and musical materials going all the way back to the 16th century.
Górecki’s Third Symphony
●
●
The second movement of Górecki’s Symphony no. 3 sets to music an 
inscription scrawled on the wall of a cell in the “Palace”: the Gestapo 
headquarters in Zakopane, in southern Poland. The graffito is signed 
and dated by an 18-year-old girl who had been imprisoned there in 
1944. The inscription reads:
No, mother, do not weep,
Most chaste Queen of Heaven.
Support me always.
Hail, Mary, full of grace.
●
●
“Hail Mary, full of grace” is the beginning of the Ave Maria, the prayer 
to the Holy Mother. Górecki’s setting is sublimely beautiful; it projects 
a sense of aching innocence and terrible tragedy and concludes with 
what can only be heard as a funeral knell. 
Lecture 
23

Music as a Mirror of History
192
●
●
The Third Symphony is a work Górecki had to compose. It was written 
at an extraordinary time in Polish history: during the storm of riots and 
strikes in 1976 that led, four years later, to the founding of the Solidarity 
labor union. With revolution in the air, Górecki felt empowered to bear 
witness to the events that had shaped his life and his world. 
First Movement
●
●
Górecki subtitled the work Symphony of Sorrowful Songs, but more 
than just songs, each of the three movements is a prayer, and each of 
the prayers concerns mothers and the deaths of their children.
●
●
At about 30 minutes, the first movement is longer than the other two 
combined. It is cast in three parts, structured as an arch. Part one is a 
canon that starts low in the strings and builds to eight voices. Part two is 
the prayer, sung by the soprano. Part three begins with the canon at full 
strength—eight voices—then goes into reverse, whittling itself down to 
one voice by the movement’s end. It is a stunning movement: meditative 
yet dynamic, mournful and defiant, and heartbreakingly beautiful.
●
●
There is no mistaking the religious, plainchant-like quality of the 
canon theme. Górecki fashioned it by blending an old church hymn 
sung during Lent entitled “Behold, Jesus Is Dying” with an equally old 
folk song from central Poland called “Let Him Be Praised.” 
●
●
The prayer that makes up the central vocal section of the movement 
is called “The Lamentation of the Holy Cross.” It was created during 
the 15th century at the Monastery of Łysa Góra in eastern Poland. In 
the lament, Mary—standing at the base of the cross—begs the dying 
Jesus to share his pain with her. This is every mother’s plea; there is no 
greater pain than to see your child suffer. 
●
●
Górecki’s setting is simplicity personified: gently rising, gently 
imploring lines in the voice lead, at the conclusion of the prayer, to a 
heart-rending climax. 

Lecture 23—Górecki: Symphony No. 3 (1976) 
193
●
●
In this first movement, Mary attempts to relieve the pain of her dying 
son. The reference is clear: The wounded Jesus represents the Polish 
nation and its suffering during the 20th century.
●
●
At the same time, the historical elements in this first movement trace 
their origins to the age of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. 
●
●
That these ancient references are used to reflect on modern events 
adds tremendous power and pathos to the expressive impact of 
the symphony. 
The World Turned Upside Down
●
●
Russia and Germany—the two great continental powers of Europe—
have never trusted each other, and for as long as there are nation-
states, that is unlikely to change. Adding sociopolitical fuel to the 
rivalry is the fact that communism and fascism—the two most 
oppositional ideologies of the 20th century—came to be personified 
by Russia (in the guise of the Soviet Union) and Nazi Germany. 
●
●
It has become fashionable today to describe fascism and 
communism—or, more accurately, Nazism and Stalinism—as being 
essentially two sides of the same coin. From a practical point of view, 
this would seem to be self-evident. 
●
●
Both Nazism and Stalinism were rooted in a cult of personality 
based on the infallible actions of a single leader with total authority. 
Both systems employed a small ruling elite and a single ruling party 
to push forward their agendas. Both systems were atheistic, and 
both sought to do away with traditional notions regarding good 
and evil. 
●
●
Both systems sought to destroy the old world and create a new 
international order based on their own utopian visions. Both 
systems placed the state above the needs of individual people 
(except, of course, the needs of Hitler and Stalin).
●
●
Both systems also required enemies, from within and without, 
to justify their actions. For Stalin, the great external enemy was 
international capitalism; the domestic enemies were saboteurs 
who stifled progress and ideological backsliders who no longer 

Music as a Mirror of History
194
supported the revolution. For Hitler, the great enemies were 
Bolshevism, democracy, and the Jews. 
●
●
Both systems required massive secret police organizations, 
concentration camps or gulags, and summary justice in order to 
control the population. Both Nazism and Stalinism were posited 
on unlimited expansion. Finally, both systems were intrinsically 
criminal—grim reflections of Hitler’s and Stalin’s psychotic 
personalities. 
●
●
Having said all this, Nazism and Stalinism were, nevertheless, 
ideological opposites. Stalin came to power as a result of a revolution 
of the political left; Hitler came to power as a result of a revolution 
of the political right. Stalinism advocated state ownership; Nazism, 
state control. In theory, Stalinism put forth a concept of global 
egalitarianism, while Nazism advocated ultranationalism. 
●
●
These ideological differences rendered Nazism and Stalinism as 
natural-born enemies. In August 1939, however, the two powers signed 
what amounted to a friendship pact and trade treaty. The world was 
aghast. Communists and communist sympathizers were horrified by 
what they perceived as Stalin’s betrayal. 
●
●
But Stalin had his reasons. He knew that Germany was prepared 
to go to war, while the Soviet Union was not. When his attempts 
to negotiate a mutual defense pact with France and England went 
nowhere, Stalin decided to cut a deal with Hitler. 
●
●
What no one on the outside knew was that a secret additional 
protocol had been attached to the official treaty document. The 
protocol divided the sovereign states of Romania, Latvia, Estonia, 
Lithuania, and Poland between Germany and Russia. In return for 
its share of these territories, Russia promised to give Germany a 
free hand in Central and Western Europe.
●
●
His eastern flank thus secure, Hitler was free to begin his war of 
expansion, which he did on September 1, 1939, by invading Poland. 
On September 17, the Red Army invaded Poland from the east and 
occupied the territory that the pact had assigned to the Soviet Union.

Horror and Tragedy
●
●
What occurred in Poland in the five years between 1939 and 1944 
was a demonstration of what happens when a modern industrial 
nation of 79 million people decides to invade, destroy, and absorb 
a neighboring country and murder or enslave its population of 35 
million. The war killed more Poles by percentage of population than 
any other nation: Roughly 6 million Poles died in World War II, 16.7 
percent of the population, or one out of every six people.
●
●
The total destruction of the Polish capital of Warsaw was planned well 
before the war began. According to the Pabst Plan, a Nazi “model 
town”—populated by no more than 130,000 people—was to be built 
on its ruins. Although the town was never built, the Germans did 
build their killing centers—the extermination camps—on Polish soil: 
Auschwitz-Birkenau, Treblinka, Bełżec, and others. 
●
●
Until they were attacked and ousted from Poland in June 1941 by the 
Nazis, the Soviets behaved no better. 
●
●
They took about 40,000 prisoners of war when they invaded 
eastern Poland, roughly 15,000 of whom were officers and 25,000 
were soldiers and non-coms. The Soviets also rounded up doctors, 
lawyers, teachers, professors, writers, journalists, policemen, 
engineers, pilots, government officials, and priests. 
●
●
The 25,000 soldiers and non-coms were put to work as slave 
laborers. As for the officers and civilians, numbering some 
23,000, their fate was sealed on March 5, 1940, when Stalin and 
the Politburo ordered their execution. Because most of them were 
shot and buried in the Katyn Forest in western Russia, the action is 
known as the Katyn Massacre.
●
●
Despite having been beaten militarily, the Polish government never 
surrendered. In 1940, a Polish government-in-exile was established in 
London, which coordinated the activities of the Polish underground. 
The underground created courts for trying collaborators and set 
up schools to replace those shut down by the Germans. Surviving 

Music as a Mirror of History
196
officers of the Polish Army established an underground army called 
the Home Army.
●
●
On July 29, 1944, Soviet armored troops reached the eastern outskirts 
of Warsaw. Later that day, Moscow Radio broadcast—in Polish—
an Appeal to Warsaw, calling on the citizens to rise up against the 
Germans. The commanders of the Polish Home Army, believing that 
their liberation was at hand, gave the command for the Warsaw 
Uprising to commence on August 1, 1944. 
●
●
Believing that they’d soon be fighting side by side with the Red Army, 
the Home Army attacked with somewhere between 25,000 and 
50,000 combatants. Within a few days, it managed to liberate most 
of the city west of the Vistula River, while the Red Army did nothing. 
●
●
Stalin had no intention of allowing the Polish government in London 
to govern postwar Poland. The Home Army was filled with Polish 
nationalists who could cause the Soviets nothing but trouble. 
Between the Nazi special 
squads of police and the 
concentration camps, there 
was no World War II killing 
ground worse than Poland.

Lecture 23—Górecki: Symphony No. 3 (1976) 
197
●
●
Thus, Stalin decided to kill two birds with one stone by letting the 
Poles and the Germans kill each other. Only then would he allow 
the Red Army to march in, and he would put in charge whomever 
he chose. And that’s exactly what happened. 
●
●
The Poles fought heroically during the uprising, but in the end, it 
was a massacre. By the time it ended on October 2, Warsaw was a 
ghost town: 16,000 Home Army troops were dead; between 150,000 
and 200,000 civilians had been executed; and the remainder of the 
population—some 700,000 people—were expelled from the city. The 
order was given to destroy whatever was left, and by the time the 
Germans finally withdrew in January 1945, 85 percent of Warsaw was 
destroyed. 
●
●
The Red Army entered the ruins on January 17, 1945. Right behind 
it was the so-called Lublin Committee, a Soviet puppet government 
primed and ready for installation. A Stalinist police state descended 
on Poland that would not have its first free election for 45 years, until 
October 27, 1991.
Third Movement
●
●
Górecki was born in 1933 and grew up in southwest Poland, in 
the village of Czernica, just a few miles from the border with 
Czechoslovakia. 
●
●
In this, he was lucky. Czernica lies in a region called Silesia, which 
today straddles Poland, the Czech Republic, and Germany. The 
large German population of Silesia, along with its coal mines and 
heavy industry, made it one of the few places in Poland that was 
relatively safe during the war.
●
●
Nevertheless, the Górecki family was neck deep in the resistance, 
and it cost them dearly. Górecki’s grandfather died in Dachau, 
and his aunt, in Auschwitz. Górecki himself visited Auschwitz 
immediately after the war.

Music as a Mirror of History
198
●
●
The text of the third movement of Górecki’s Symphony no. 3 comes 
from a folk song from Silesia. It reads, in part: 
Where has he gone
My dearest son?
Perhaps during the uprising 
The cruel enemy killed him.
Ah, you evil people
In the name of God, the most Holy,
Tell me, why did you kill
My son?
●
●
Contrary to what is often written, Henryk Górecki’s Third Symphony is 
not “about” the Nazi and Russian invasion of Poland, the Katyn Forest 
Massacre or the Warsaw Uprising, Auschwitz and the Holocaust, 
or Górecki’s own epic struggles with the Polish Communist Party. 
Rather, Górecki’s Third is “about” the Polish experience of the mid-20th 
century, taken as widely as we please.

Crumb: Black Angels (1970)
G
eorge Crumb’s Black Angels for amplified string quartet is 
inscribed on its title page as having been written: “in tempore 
belli, 1970”: “in time of war, 1970.” It is cast in 13 movements that 
Crumb calls images. The first, middle, and last images are threnodies. A 
threnody is an expression of grief and suffering. The big history behind 
this lecture is how one-time allies became enemies; how the Cold 
War between them became hot in the country of Vietnam; and how 
an American composer from West Virginia managed to capture the 
heartbreak and futility of that war in a piece for amplified string quartet.
Containment
●
●
By 1946, many people believed that World War III was right around 
the corner. For a world still digging itself out from World War II, 
such a prospect was unthinkable. A workable policy for dealing with 
the Soviet Union had to emerge quickly. The problem was that few 
Westerners had real insight into the nature and motivations of the 
Soviet regime. One who did was a Foreign Service officer named 
George Frost Kennan.
●
●
Kennan had been appointed deputy chief of the diplomatic mission in 
Moscow in the spring of 1944. In 1946, the U.S. Treasury Department—
still thinking that the Soviet Union was an ally—asked the State 
Department to explain why the Soviets had refused to endorse the 
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. 
●
●
On February 22, 1946, Kennan sent a 5,500-word telegram (the 
“Long Telegram”) to Secretary of State James Byrnes, in which he 
asserted that the Soviet Union was not an ally but an inherently 
expansionist adversary.
Lecture

Music as a Mirror of History

George Kennan, deputy chief 
of the diplomatic mission in 
Moscow, was one of the few 
people in the West who had any 
real experience with or insight 
into the Soviet Union.

Lecture 24—Crumb: Black Angels (1970) 
●
●
The telegram was a wake-up call, a trenchant analysis of Soviet 
thinking. Kennan advised a policy of containment: that Soviet 
adventurism be met with a firm hand. 
●
●
Kennan’s telegram became the basis of the Truman Doctrine, which, 
according to the Department of State: “established that the United 
States would provide political, military and economic assistance to all 
democratic nations under threat from external or internal authoritarian 
forces.”
●
●
Following the doctrine of containment, a United Nations force led 
by the United States went to war in Korea when communist North 
Korean forces—supported by the Soviet Union and China—invaded 
the South on June 25, 1950. 
●
●
In October 1950, China entered the war, and Douglas MacArthur, 
the allied commander, called for military action against China. But 
neither Truman nor the Joint Chiefs supported MacArthur’s call 
for escalation; they understood that an open-ended land war on 
mainland Asia was doomed to failure. 
●
●
The Korean War was a limited war: Its strategic goal was not to 
defeat and occupy North Korea but, rather, to contain North Korea 
and maintain the division of the country between North and South. 
The Korean ceasefire was signed on July 27, 1953. If containment 
meant victory, then victory was achieved in Korea.
Vietnam
●
●
Given the successful containment of communism in Korea, the civilian 
authorities of the U.S. government assumed that it could be achieved 
10 years later in Vietnam. But Vietnam wasn’t Korea. 
●
●
The first Vietnam War was a war of national liberation; it began in 
1946 when the French attempted to reclaim their former colony after 
the defeat of Japan. This war ended in 1954 with the French expulsion 
from Vietnam and the division of the country into North and South. 
201

Music as a Mirror of History
202
●
●
The national coalition that fought the Japanese and the French was 
called the Viet Minh. From 1941, the Viet Minh and, later, the Viet Cong 
and North Vietnam were led by a charismatic nationalist named Ho 
Chi Minh. For Ho Chi Minh, the division of Vietnam was an abomination 
perpetrated by colonialists. Ho’s vision was the creation of a unified, 
communist Vietnam. 
●
●
With the French out of the picture, the United States became the 
political guarantor of South Vietnam, throwing its support behind a 
right-wing would-be dictator named Ngo Dinh Diem, based on his 
staunch anti-communism. Diem came to power in 1955, launching one 
of the most corrupt governments the United States ever propped up. 
●
●
Diem’s reversal of land reforms instituted by the Viet Minh didn’t go over 
well, and by 1957, a homegrown insurgency had begun. The insurgency—
which grew out of the Viet Minh—was derisively referred to by the South 
Vietnamese government as the Viet Cong: the “Red Vietnamese.”
●
●
In September 1960, North Vietnam officially recognized the insurgency 
in the South and called for the removal of American imperialists from 
the South. That official recognition meant providing the Viet Cong 
with weapons, supplies, military advisors, and a supply line that went 
not only through Vietnam but through the presumably demilitarized 
countries of Laos and Cambodia.
●
●
The rationale for defending Vietnam was advocated by President 
Eisenhower at a news conference in 1954, when he likened the 
countries of Southeast Asia to a row of dominos, claiming that if 
one should fall to communism, the others would fall, as well. Almost 
everyone in a position of power at the time seems to have bought into 
this domino theory.
●
●
The Viet Cong gathered strength and support through 1961, the year 
Kennedy was inaugurated. Kennedy was sorely tested by three crises 
in the first year of his presidency: the failed CIA-sponsored invasion of 
Cuba at the Bay of Pigs in April 1961; the less-than-inspiring summit 

Lecture 24—Shostakovich: Symphony No. 13 (1962) 
203
with Nikita Khrushchev in Vienna in June 1961; and the construction of 
the Berlin Wall, starting on August 13, 1961.
●
●
Kennedy knew that on the whole, the South Vietnamese army was 
incompetent, and he knew that the South Vietnamese government 
would collapse without American support. Thus, he sent advisors and 
billions of dollars to prop up the government. 
●
●
With this sort of investment, it was necessary to clean up the South 
Vietnamese government. With CIA support, Ngo Dinh Diem was 
assassinated, and a coup d’état was staged on November 2, 1963. 
Diem’s assassination was a propaganda windfall for the North, which 
could now claim that the United States had, in essence, recolonized 
the South.
The shrieking, nattering, 
buzzing, wasp-like 
music that begins and 
concludes George 
Crumb’s Black Angels 
was likely inspired by 
attack helicopters.

Music as a Mirror of History

●
●
On November 22, 1963, President Kennedy was assassinated, and 
Lyndon Baines Johnson was sworn in as the 36th president of the 
United States.
Escalation
●
●
The moment of truth for America’s involvement in Vietnam occurred 
eight months into Johnson’s presidency, during the summer of 1964. 
On August 2, 1964, the United States claimed that North Vietnamese 
gunboats had fired on American warships in the Gulf of Tonkin. The 
incident led to open warfare between North Vietnam and the United 
States.
●
●
On March 2, 1965, the United States began bombing North Vietnam. 
Six days later, 3,500 Marines were sent to South Vietnam, marking 
the official beginning of the U.S. ground war. For the duration of the 
war, the United States would simultaneously fight two adversaries: the 
conventional army of North Vietnam and the guerilla army of the Viet 
Cong. 
●
●
From the beginning, the United States fought a limited war. But a 
limited war would not work in Vietnam because North Vietnam and 
the Viet Cong were fighting a total war, in which they were willing 
to make sacrifices far beyond anything the American public would 
tolerate. 
●
●
Militarily, the U.S. armed forces did what they were asked to do. 
Fighting in triple-canopy jungle, malarial rivers, and mountain 
highlands, these forces never lost a major battle. At the cost of 58,000 
battle deaths, the U.S. military exacted a price of 1.4 million battle 
deaths, a ratio of nearly 25 to 1. 
●
●
But in the end, the body counts made no difference. The North 
Vietnamese and Viet Cong did not have to defeat the United States; 
they just had to not quit—to prolong the war to the point where its costs 
were no longer commensurate with the perceived benefits of victory. 

Lecture 24—Crumb: Black Angels (1970) 
“Dance of Tears”
●
●
The sense of waste and grief that permeated the American national 
spirit as it watched the first televised war is captured in the sixth 
movement of Black Angels, entitled “Pavana Lachrymae,” or “Dance 
of Tears.”
●
●
The “Pavana Lachrymae” is a pastiche. Pastiche is a technique used 
by many composers in the 1960s and 1970s that incorporated 
direct quotes from existing pieces of music into otherwise newly 
composed works. Pastiche treats these musical quotations as “found 
objects” that, when juxtaposed with other music, create unexpected 
associations. 
●
●
The most striking quotation in Black Angels occurs in “Pavana 
Lachrymae,” which consists almost entirely of a quote from a song 
and a string quartet by Franz Schubert, Death and the Maiden. 
●
●
Death has come to claim an adolescent girl, and she is not prepared 
to go quietly. But at the conclusion, the song switches from minor 
to major; the girl’s fear of death and darkness is transformed into 
acceptance.
●
●
In 1822, the 25-year-old Schubert was diagnosed with syphilis. 
It was a death sentence, and his life and his music changed 
overnight. In 1825, in the depths of depression, he composed his 
String Quartet no. 14 in D Minor. The second movement consists of 
a theme and five variations. The theme is the fearful, minor-mode 
introduction to Death and the Maiden.
●
●
This music—which represents both death and transfiguration—is 
the music George Crumb quotes in his “Dance of Tears,” scored for 
the cello, second violin, and viola. Crumb indicates that the trio of 
instruments should sound: “grave, solemn; like a consort of viols (a 
fragile echo of an ancient music).” 
●
●
To achieve this effect, Crumb asks the players to bow near the pegs 
of their instruments and to hold their bows in the manner of viol 
205

Music as a Mirror of History
206
bows. Meanwhile, the first violin provides electric insect sounds in 
counterpoint with the faux viol consort.
The Tet Offensive and Its Aftermath
●
●
The turning point in the Vietnam War was the Tet Offensive, which 
began on January 30, 1968. Tet gave the lie to administration claims 
that the United States was winning the war. The fact that the offensive 
was destroyed with colossal losses to the communists was immaterial; 
this “tactical” victory for the United States was a strategic victory 
for North Vietnam because, after Tet, the American public had had 
enough. 
●
●
The catastrophic series of events that followed only served to darken 
the American mood and make an ever-growing number of people 
prone to violent protest. On April 4, 1968, Martin Luther King Jr. was 
assassinated; within a week, riots broke out in more than 100 U.S. 
cities. On June 5, 1968, presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy was 
shot. On August 20, 1968, the Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia. 
●
●
In November 1968, Richard Nixon was elected president, based in part 
on his promise to end the war with honor. But it took Nixon another 
four years to extricate the United States from Vietnam. Nixon also 
allowed his national security advisor, Henry Kissinger, to initiate a 
secret, illegal bombing campaign in Cambodia and Laos. The bombing 
campaign became known on April 30, 1970, when Nixon announced 
the invasion of Cambodia. The protests came immediately.
●
●
It was during this difficult time that George Crumb composed his 
antiwar string quartet Black Angels. We conclude by sampling the 
10th image of Black Angels, entitled “God-Music.” The voice of God is 
that of the ‘cello, played high in its range. The other three players bow 
the edges of tuned crystal glasses, creating a shimmering, unworldly 
accompaniment. 

Lecture 24—Crumb: Black Angels (1970) 
Summing Up Our Course
●
●
We human beings are contradictory creatures, capable of both great 
and terrible things. At the dark end of the spectrum is the lust for 
power—power over our fellow human beings and power to redraw 
maps. At the other end is our ability to create and procreate—to make 
and raise children; to build, to love, and to make sense of the chaos 
around us by telling stories; and to make art by creating symbols that 
universalize human experience. 
●
●
Music—the most abstract of all the arts—is at once the most universal 
of all the arts, unbound by concrete form or defined by any particular 
spoken language. Consequently, music has a unique power to both 
personify and transcend the time and place of its creation. 
●
●
Music informs, delights, and intensifies experience and meaning. As a 
mirror of events, it can shed light and deliver understanding beyond 
that of almost any other medium.
