Introduction to hydrodynamic modelling and granular dynamics
Introduction to hydrodynamic 
modelling and granular dynamics
The present text introduces hydrodynamic modelling principles in the context of batch wet granulation 
and coating systems and it reviews the latest achievements and proposals in the scientific literature in this 
field. The text concerns primarily the Eulerian and the Lagrangian modelling technique. In accordance 
with some of the latest published Ph.d. thesis in the field of hydrodynamics modelling, the Lagrangian 
technique is divided into a soft-particle and a hard-sphere approach. The text further presents some 
of the latest trends and results from the growing field of applying Computational Fluid Dynamics and 
Discrete Element Modelling in the field of modelling fluid bed granulation processes. Further, a number 
of other granule dynamic modelling principles including the Finite Element and Monte Carlo techniques 
are introduced.
The text is aimed at undergraduate university or engineering-school students working in the field 
of mathematical or chemical and biochemical engineering. Newly graduated as well as experienced 
engineers may also find relevant new information as emphasis is put on the newest scientific discoveries 
and proposals presented in recent years of scientific publications. It is the hope that the present 
introductory text will be helpful to the reader – particularly in the early stages of the process of working 
with hydrodynamics in a granulation context. The comprehensive literature list may also hopefully be 
an inspiration for further reading. 
I alone am responsible for any misprints or errors and I will be grateful to receive any critics and/or 
suggestions for further improvements.

Hydrodynamic modelling and granular dynamics 
in  respect to fluid bed processing
1	 Hydrodynamic modelling and 
granular dynamics in respect to 
fluid bed processing
As it has been emphasised elsewhere (e.g. Hede, 2006b), a lot of research in fluid bed processing 
has focussed on modelling and understanding of the separate growth mechanisms associated with 
agglomeration. Much of this understanding of these separate mechanisms has been integrated into 
population balance models as it was presented in Hede (2006c). The available population balance models 
almost never take into account the hydrodynamic properties and influence on the fluid bed process, 
although the nature and detailed knowledge of fluidisation must be regarded as a prerequisite for precise 
modelling – especially when it comes to scaling of fluid bed processes. Hydrodynamic modelling of 
fluid bed systems seeks to include the effect of fluidisation although this approach is somewhat different 
from the population balance approach1. A hydrodynamic approach to fluid bed systems is a fairly new 
discipline that has developed in the last five to ten years due to the enormous increase in computer 
processing power and algorithm development. It is nevertheless a difficult but promising discipline 
being a prerequisite for discrete element modelling and computational fluid dynamic modelling which 
are both subjects to be presented in the present chapter.
Hydrodynamics is fluid dynamics applied to liquids, and as the bed load is fluidised in the fluid bed 
vessel during processing, hydrodynamics is often used as a term rather than the more general term fluid 
dynamics2. As with other typical fluid dynamic problems, a fluid bed hydrodynamic problem often 
involves the calculation of various properties for the fluidised particles such as velocity, pressure, density 
and temperature as function of space and time. The system consisting of the fluidised solid particles 
and the fluidising gas is often treated as a two-phase gas-solid flow system (Goldschmidt, 2001 and 
Goldschmidt et al., 2003). Modern approaches by Goldschmidt (2001) reduce this simplification by 
treating the fluid bed system as a multiphase system, which allows a detailed hydrodynamic modelling of 
the fluid phase of top-spray fluid beds. The description of such systems seeks in any case to account for 
the inherent complexity of dense gas-particle flows, which in its turn can be related to particle-particle 
and particle-wall interactions as well as gas-particle interactions (Goldschmidt, 2001). Hydrodynamic 
modelling is rarely combined with mass transfer or chemical/physical reactions and mechanisms as first 
attempts by Samuelsberg & Hjertager (1996) strongly indicate the prior need for valid and well-proven 
hydrodynamic models.

Hydrodynamic modelling and granular dynamics 
in  respect to fluid bed processing
On an overall scale, there are basically two types of hydrodynamic models being the Eulerian models3 
and the Lagrangian models of which the first is commonly known as Computational Fluid Dynamic 
models (CFD) and the latter is commonly referred to as Discrete Element Models (DEM)4. Both types 
consider the gas phase as a continuum but there are quite a few differences in the modelling approaches 
and assumptions. The following sections will briefly introduce the basic principles and differences. An 
in-depth treatment of fluidised bed hydrodynamics and granular dynamics of two-phase flows should 
be found in Hoomans (1999) and Goldschmidt (2001).
1.1	
Eulerian models
In Eulerian models the gas and the solid phases are treated as interpenetrating phases, and the theory 
behind such models is basically an extension of the classical kinetic theory that takes non-ideal particle-
article collisions and gas-particle drag into account (Goldschmidt, 2001). In this scheme, collections of 
particles are modelled using continuous medium mechanics. The solid particles are generally considered 
to be identical having a representative diameter and density, meaning that the particle phase is volume 
averaged (Taghipour et al., 2005 and Depypere, 2005). The general idea in formulating such a multi-
fluid model is to treat each phase as an interpenetrating continuum and therefore to construct integral 
balances of continuity, momentum and energy for both phases with appropriate boundary conditions 
and jump conditions for the phase interfaces. Since such a resulting continuum approximation for the 
solid phase has no equation of state and obviously lacks variables such as viscosity and normal stress, 
certain averaging techniques and assumptions are required to obtain a momentum balance for the solid 
phase (Pain et al., 2001). 
Although constitutive relations according to the kinetic theory of particle flow have been incorporated 
into recent models (e.g. Gidaspow et al., 2004 and Chiesa et al., 2005), pure CFD models for fluid bed 
granulation still suffer from the fact that the contact between fluid, particles and boundary surfaces is not 
considered explicitly with respect to particle inertia and the mechanical properties of the particles. This 
limits the ability of CFD multiphase models to adequately represent particle-particle and fluid-particle 
interactions thereby reducing the accuracy of the prediction of both the fluid and the particle dynamics 
(Fan et al., 2003 and Sun, 2002). This inaccuracy can be overcome by explicit calculations of the particle 
contact mechanics in a particle-scale reference frame using a Lagrangian approach as it will be presented 
below. Considering the required computational power and complexity, gas-particle flow fields calculated 
with the multi-fluid interpenetrating approach of the Eulerian granular multi-phase model is still a fast 
method to calculate flow fields, as it is well known from simple particle systems as spray-drying and 
conveying systems etc. Due to the obvious need for accounting precise particle level properties into fluid 
bed hydrodynamic models, pure Eulerian CFD models5 must be regarded as inappropriate even in an 
industrial context. Hydrodynamic fluid bed scaling attempts on empty vessel basis are often based on 
Eulerian models (e.g. Krishna & van Baten, 2001 and Cooper & Coronella, 2005) but the models often 
turn out to be inaccurate when particles are being processes. Recent attempts by e.g. Depypere (2005) 
and Lettieri et al. (2003) quite clearly illustrates that future development in the field of hydrodynamic 
fluid bed modelling should be concerned with Lagrangian principles rather than Eulerian.

Lagrangian models – Discrete Element Methods
The Lagrangian approach may be seen as an extension of the Eulerian, in that Lagrangian model describes 
the solids phase at particle level and the gas phase as a continuum. In the two-phase flow situation the 
Newtonian equations of motion for each individual particle are solved with inclusion of the effects of 
particle collisions and forces acting on the particles by the gas (Goldschmidt, 2001). That is, Newton’s 
law of motion is simultaneously solved for a large number of particles either in a computational unit 
cell with periodic boundaries or on a computational domain representing the entire fluid bed vessel or 
its subset. In general the following equations are solved (Cameron et al., 2005):

in which mi is the particle mass, vi is the velocity vector, t is time, Ii is the moment of inertia, ωi is the 
angular velocity vector, Mi is the net torque vector and Fi is the net force vector acting on particle i. The 
net force vector Fi is often written as the sum of three contributions (Cameron et al., 2005):

where FH is the force due to fluid-particle interactions also known as the drag force, FP is the force due to 
particle-particle interactions during collisions and FE is a force acting on the particle due to an external 
field being e.g. the gravitational field. FE is sometimes completely ignored and FH is often estimated 
from empirical equations, and many discrete element approaches involves different assumptions and 
expressions for the net force vector in equation 1.3 (Goldschmidt et al., 2004).
Besides obviously being far more precise than the Eulerian models, such discrete particle models do 
not require additional closure equations for the suspended particulate phase since they compute the 
motion of every individual particle, taking collisions and external forces acting on the particles directly 
into account (Goldschmidt, 2001). The Lagrangian approach may roughly be divided into two groups 
being the soft particle and the hard-sphere approach, both of which will be briefly introduced below.

1.2.1	
Hard-particle models
In hard-sphere models the particles are assumed to interact through instantaneous, binary collisions. 
A sequence of collisions is processed one collision at the time in order of occurrence (Hoomans, 1999, 
Hoomans et al., 2000 and Tsjui et al., 1993). Hard-sphere models are also referred to as event driven 
models since a sequence of collisions is processes in which all particles are moved until the next collision 
occurs. Particle collision dynamics are described by collision lays, which account for energy dissipation 
due to non-ideal particle interaction by means of the empirical coefficients of normal and tangential 
restitution and coefficient of friction (Goldschmidt, 2001). The dissipative particle interaction in particle 
media makes these systems significantly different from molecular systems where energy associated with 
collision always is conserved. This means that energy has to be continuously supplied to the particle 
system in order to keep the particles in motion. This can for instance be achieved by applying a shear 
rate through proper choice of boundary conditions as suggested by Campbell & Brennen (1985). It has 
become common to choose the collision particle partners and sequences based on the relative approach 
velocity (Hoomans et al., 1996 & 2000). 
Based on work by Hoomans (1999), Goldschmidt (2001) and Goldschmidt et al. (2003) developed a 
hard-sphere discrete particle model for gas-fluidised beds which captures the principles of basic two 
dimensional hard-sphere modelling well. This model computes the motion of every individual particle 
as well as droplet in the system considering the gas phase as a continuum. Micro-scale processes such 
as particle-particle collisions, droplet-particle coalescence and agglomeration are taken into account by 
simple closure models. Distinction is made between three types of entities being dry particles, wetted 
particles and droplets. All three types are assumed to be spherical, and encounters are detected as soon 
as contact occurs at a point on the line joining the centres of the two entities. In addition, six types 
of encounters are distinguished: encounters among dry particles described by hard-sphere collision 
laws from mechanics; Droplet-droplet encounters described by hard-sphere collisions laws as well, as 
they are assumed to be repulsive for atomised liquid droplets with a typical radius of 50 μm, colliding 
with small mutual differences; Encounters between droplets and dry or wetted particles, described as 
coalescence; Encounters between dry or wetted particles and a wall, described by hard-sphere collision 
laws; Encounters between droplet and walls, resulting in removal of the droplet from the simulation and 
last; Encounters between a wetted particle and another particle, leading to either rebound described by 
hard-sphere collision laws or agglomeration. Which of the two situations that occurs depends on the 
odds of the particles hitting each other on a wet spot (Goldschmidt et al., 2003). It is further assumed 
that a new particle entity is formed at the position of the centre of mass of the original entities upon 
coalescence as it is sketched in figure 1.

Mass, momentum and volume of the new entities are conserved and transferred to the newly formed 
particle, where after the original entities are excluded from the simulation. In case of coalescence, the 
area on the newly formed particle covered by liquid depends on the original particle size, the size of the 
droplet and a defined minimum liquid layer thickness as sketched in figure 2.

Figure 2: Liquid layer formation upon coalescence (Goldschmidt et al., 2003).
In case of agglomeration, the wetted area available for subsequent agglomeration is reduced by the 
projected area of the smallest particle, to account for liquid bridge formation and the masking of the 
wetted surface, which cannot be reached anymore because the newly agglomerated particle is in the 
way. This is sketched in figure 3. 
Figure 3: Masking of wetted surface for subsequent agglomeration 
(Goldschmidt et al., 2003).
Although inclusion of liquid and gas inside the pores is taken into account for agglomerates containing 
more than three primary particles in the model by Goldschmidt et al. (2003), the model does however not 
account for particle deformation, liquid spreading, breakage of droplets and agglomerates, and is further 
limited by the two-dimensional geometry. Even so, the simulation using the simple two-dimensional 
Goldschmidt model is only possible for 50,000 granules at the time thereby being only comparable 
to experimental data from laboratory-scale fluid beds. This clearly illustrates the need for increased 
computational power if the hard-sphere principles should be used for any industrial purposes, and also 
indicates why the hard-sphere approach has first been used within the last ten to fifteen years although 
the principles were introduced originally in the late fifties. In recent modelling attempts, hard-sphere 
models are mainly concerned with rapid particle flow6 (Lian et al., 1998) and the majority of the latest 
discrete element attempts concerns the soft-particle approach.

1.2.2	
Soft-particle models
The soft-particle approach differs from the hard-particle approach in that it treats interparticle collisions 
as a continuous process that takes place over a finite time. In such models the particles are assumed 
to undergo deformation during their contact, where the contact forces are calculated from a simple 
mechanical analogy involving a spring, a dashpot and a friction slider as the normal and tangential 
component of forces are expressed as the sum of forces due to the springs and dashpots, and the normal 
and tangential velocities are expressed in terms of the relative velocity prior to collision (Gera et al., 
1998). Such inter-particle bond models are particular suitable for the modelling of impact breakage of 
pre-existing agglomerates which undergo some sort of brittle fracture (Thornton & Cismocos, 1999). 
This is why the majority of discrete element simulations of agglomerate strength use the soft-particle 
approach as mentioned in the previous section. The principle of the linear spring-dashpot model is 
sketched in figure 4.
Figure 4: Contact force model for soft particle modelling (Gera et al., 1998).
With soft-particle simulations, the interactive forces exerted on each particle are computed as continuous 
functions of the distance between contiguous particles and are based on physically realistic interaction 
laws. Soft-particle models are also referred to as time driven models as all particles are moved over a 
certain period of time where after the collision dynamics are computed from the particle overlaps. In 
case a particle is in contact with several other particles, the resulting contact force follows from the 
addition of binary contributions (Goldschmidt, 2001). Compared to the hard-sphere principle this 
approach is computationally intensive and requires even higher computational demands than the hard-
sphere simulations, but does as a clear advantage provides information on the structure and dynamics 
of particular materials including details of positions, velocities, forces and energy partitions (Lian et al., 
1998). This makes soft-particle modelling useful in the simulation of the deformation and breakage of 
agglomerates. In soft-particle simulations of coalescence, agglomerates are modelled as assemblies of 
primary particles, which often are assumed to be spherical and elastic.

Hydrodynamic modelling and granular dynamics 
in  respect to fluid bed processing
In a representative example of a soft-particle coalescence model, Lian et al. (1998) developed a model 
in which each agglomerate comprised 1000 randomly packed primary particles with the interparticle 
interactions modelled as the combination of the solid-solid contact forces and the principles for the 
pendular liquid bridges presented in Hede (2006a). It is assumed that the binding liquid present at 
particle junctions completely wets the particles. With this set-up, the coalescence of two randomly packed 
agglomerates each consisting of 1000 primary particles was studied at different impact velocities. Initially 
1000 primary particles were randomly generated in each of two specified spherical regions that were not 
able to touch. Centripetal gravity fields were then applied to the two spherical regions in order to bring 
the particles together and, depending on the size of this field, the regions would impact each other at 
different velocities. When two primary particles collided, a pendular liquid bridge was assigned to that 
contact. The kinematic energy was eventually dissipated due to the retarding effect of the viscous liquid 
bridges. When equilibrium was achieved, the centripetal gravity was removed. Pendular liquid bridges 
then held the particles together. The impact simulation was implemented for a range of initial relative 
velocities between the two agglomerates and for different interstitial binder fluid viscosities, and for 
each collision, the simulation was continued until a major proportion of the initial kinetic energy was 
essentially dissipated. Examples of computer simulated wet agglomerates after impact at a velocity of 
2.0 m/s with different interstitial viscosities ranging from 1 mPa s to 100 mPa s can be seen in figure 5.

The results by Lian et al. (1998) illustrate the possibilities regarding the simulation of the coalescence 
situation at particle level, but with the large computer processing time even for the binary collision situation 
it is obvious that such an approach cannot easily be extended to model the high number of particles inside 
a commercial fluid bed. Even if it at some point will be possible due to the development in computational 
processing power, agglomeration in fluid beds cannot be fully understood or modelled just by treating the 
binary coalescence situation, as it has been emphasised in Hede (2005 & 2006b). More advanced algorithms 
must be developed and implemented into soft-particle programs in order to account for the random nature 
of particle collisions in real fluid bed. Soft-particle simulation is nevertheless a promising tool for studying 
the effect at particle level of changing some of the physical parameters. Once the program is set up, changes 
can be made infinitely as only the processing time sets the limit with the present available computers. E.g. 
have the previously mentioned simulations by Lian et al. (1998) indicated that during binary collision the 
dominant energy dissipation is the viscous dissipation, except when the fluid viscosity is relatively small. 
These tendencies would have been extremely time consuming to extract from experimental data.

1.2.3	
Summing up on Lagrangian modelling
Since Lagrangian models describe particle motions in detail, it is expected that these models show closer 
resemblance with experimental results than with the Eulerian models. However, a direct comparison 
between hard- or soft-sphere models and experiments has not been made so far mainly because of the large 
number of particles that is required to justify the application of the continuum approach on one hand, and 
the limited number of particles that can be handled by the discrete element models on the other hand. 
Further complications arise from the fact that a rigorous comparison can only be made if the discrete 
element models account for the full three-dimensional motion of the particles as a two-dimensional 
modelling of the particle collision dynamics has proven to be too restrictive (Hoomans, 1999). This further 
strongly increases the required number of particles and consequently the computational demands. The 
number of particles that can be accounted for in such models is a generic but serious limiting factor in 
any of the present Lagrangian models. Even with modern computers, present models cannot account for 
more than 106 particles, which is several orders of magnitudes lower than that encountered in industrial 
fluid beds. Rough estimations based on Moores law for computer processing development estimate that 
models accounting for all three dimensional particles in industrial scale fluid beds will not be within 
reach in the coming ten to fifteen years (Webopedia, 2005 and Michales, 2003). 
1.3	
Other granular dynamic modelling principles
Besides the Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches, other principles have been applied for particle systems 
similar to fluid beds. These principles will only be briefly introduced, as the reported simulations of fluid 
bed systems using these techniques are extremely limited in number. 
1.3.1	
Monte Carlo techniques 
Another method to study many particle systems is the Monte Carlo7 technique. A Monte Carlo simulation 
is a mathematical experiment in which the behaviour of a system is simulated incorporating stochastic 
behaviour modelled using a randomness generator to vary the behaviour of the system (Kaye, 1997). 
This principle has been applied to several particle technology disciplines as reviewed by Wauters (2001). 
Regarding fluid bed granulation, Rosato et al. (1996) have applied Monte Carlo techniques. In their 
simulations a new overlap-free particle configuration was generated in each processing step. The change 
in the system energy was then calculated and if the change was negative, the new configuration was 
accepted. If the system energy on the other hand increased, the new configuration was accepted with a 
probability obtained from a statistical distribution based on the change in energy. With this method it 
was possible to simulate segregation and collision phenomena in agitated systems as fluid beds.

Hydrodynamic modelling and granular dynamics 
in  respect to fluid bed processing
The Monte Carlo technique is capable of predicting steady state conditions being e.g. equilibrium 
conditions and for this purpose it has certain advantages over other hydrodynamic simulations 
techniques. As time is not a variable in Monte Carlo simulations, a Monte Carlo step can only be linked 
to an actual time step by means of calibration, which is a difficult task. In practice this means that Monte 
Carlo simulations of particle dynamics is not possible without input of a-priory knowledge. This is an 
obvious disadvantage when simulating agglomerating systems as the likelihood of permanent coalescence 
is closely related to time (Hoomans, 1999). Recent fluid bed hydrodynamic simulations seldom use 
the Monte Carlo principles although the technique has been applied elsewhere in fluid bed modelling. 
E.g. have Hapgood et al. (2004) used Monte Carlo techniques for the simulation of atomised droplets 
impacting the fluidised particle bed.
1.3.2	
Finite Element scheme
The finite element method is well known from simple transport problems but has recently been applied 
to fluid bed systems. The principle involves discretising a large domain into a large number of small 
elements (which is often chosen to be triangles), developing element equations, assembling the element 
equations for the whole domain and then solve the assembled equations. The finite element discretisation 
of the governing differential equations is based on the use of interpolating polynomials to describe the 
variation of a field variable within an element. This makes finite element method well suited for irregular 
geometries and heterogeneous materials. Recent advances in finite element programs makes it possible 
to perform simulations that account for dynamic transport, heat and mass transfer, axial and radial 
dispersion, temperature and pressure variations and different hydrodynamic flow regimes, which is a 
prerequisite for fluid bed simulations (Wang & Sun, 2003). Results from catalytic fluid bed systems by 
Mahecha-Botero et al. (2005) seems promising as the models requires fewer assumptions than any of 
the principles presented earlier in this chapter. Modern finite element models can be reasonable accurate 
predictors of particle stresses if the bulk properties used as constitutive parameters are measured, but 
the finite element method struggles in general with boundary conditions when the bed particle material 
is fluidised at high fluidisation velocities (Bell, 2005). As it is the case with other simulation techniques, 
finite element model requires large processing times.

Summary
Summary
The hydrodynamic approach on fluid bed granulation is a rapid growing field and a number of the most 
used available techniques for modelling the fluid bed particle-gas flow system have been presented in 
the previous sections. As in other parts of the chemical engineering science, there is a tendency to try 
to simulate and to model the hydrodynamics rather than to build uniform test equipment or try to 
conduct detailed experiments. With the complex behaviour of fluidisation and the chaotic phenomena of 
particles trajectories, the reasons for this are obvious. As the computational processing capacity is roughly 
doubled each 18 month, the boundaries for what is possible and what is not, are in continuous motion. 
Effective modelling of solid-fluid flow requires methods for adequately characterising the discrete nature 
of the solid phase and representing the interaction between solids and fluids. CFD multiphase models 
such as the Euler method address the problem within a continuum framework. In continuum models, 
contact between gas, particles and boundary surfaces is not considered explicitly with respect to particle 
inertia and mechanical properties. This limits the ability of CFD multiphase models to adequately 
represent particle-particle and fluid-particle interactions, and may therefore reduce the accuracy of the 
prediction of both the fluid and the particle dynamics. Despite the modelling challenges, applications 
of CFD to model hydrodynamics continues to develop as it has many advantages including design 
optimisation and scale-up of systems. Some of the correlations used in the present models however 
remain to be empirical or semi-empirical. As a result, the model and its parameters must be validated 
against experimental data obtained at similar scale and process configurations. The limitation of CFD 
models to represent particle-level interactions can be overcome by explicit calculation of the particle 
contact mechanics in a particle-scale reference frame using a Discrete Element (Lagrangian) approach 
such as the hard-sphere or soft-sphere principle. 
As it was presented earlier, a discrete element algorithm is basically a numerical technique, which 
solves engineering problems that are modelled as a large system of distinct interacting general shaped 
(deformable or rigid) bodies or particles that are subject to gross motion. Engineering problems 
that exhibit such large scale discontinuous behaviour as a particle fluid bed cannot be solved with a 
conventional continuum based procedure such as the Finite Element Method, although new expansions 
of the Finite Element technique in fact seems to have somewhat solved these issues. The discrete element 
procedure is used to determine the dynamic contact topology of the bodies. It accounts for complex 
non-linear interaction phenomena between bodies and numerically solves the equations of motion. 
Since the DEM is a very computationally intensive procedure, many existing computer codes are limited 
to model either two-dimensional or small three-dimensional problems that employ simple particle 
geometries. A general problem with Discrete Element modelling is that the simulation either concerns 
mechanical properties such as breakage and attrition or concerns agglomeration, but never accounts for 
all phenomena in the same model.

Summary
Despite the different theories and techniques associated with the presented hydrodynamics modelling 
principles, validation is a general problem with any of the simulation techniques. There are only few 
research groups around the world that work specifically in the field of fluid bed hydrodynamic modelling 
and most of the equipment, that is used to validate the simulation results, have been built by the research 
group itself. This means that published results are difficult to reproduce and further exploit and expand. 
As hydrodynamic modelling generally is very time-consuming and further requires advanced equipment 
such as high-speed cameras and specially designed fluid beds allowing the fluidisation behaviour to be 
recorded, hydrodynamic modelling will probably for some time on continue to be a part of fluid bed 
modelling only for an exclusive number of research groups around the world. As a sum-up, table 1 presents 
some of the most important advantages and disadvantages associated with the different hydrodynamic 
modelling techniques presented in the present chapter.

Advantages
CFD is a fast 
method to 
calculate flow 
fields at any fluid 
bed scale, and is 
far from being as 
processing time 
demanding as the 
other techniques.
CFD provides 
a detailed 
understanding 
of flow velocity 
distribution, weight 
loss, mass and 
heat transfer.
CFD makes it 
possible to fast 
evaluate geometric 
equipment 
changes with 
much less time and 
cost than would 
be involved in 
laboratory or pilot 
plant testing.
A whole range of 
CFD commercial 
programs are 
available making 
the simulation 
coding part fairly 
straightforward.
CFD can be applied 
in the process of 
scaling equipment 
as the CFD models 
are based on 
fundamental 
physics and are 
thereby scale 
independent.
High precision of the 
particle dynamics 
as the Newtonian 
equations of motion 
for each individual 
particle are solved with 
inclusion of the effects 
of particle collisions 
and forces acting 
on the particles by 
the gas.
A larger number 
of particles can be 
included into the hard 
sphere models than is 
possible in soft-sphere 
models. 
High precision of the 
particle dynamics 
as the Newtonian 
equations of motion 
for each individual 
particle are solved 
with inclusion of the 
effects of particle 
collisions and 
forces acting on the 
particles by the gas.
Soft-particle 
simulation is a 
promising tool for 
studying the effect 
at particle level of 
changing some 
of the physical 
parameters involved 
in the granulation 
process.
Theoretical particle 
level models may 
be validated using 
the soft-particle 
approach as 
numerous variations 
in the physical/
chemical parameters 
may be simulated 
relatively fast once 
the simulation 
program is set up.
Soft-sphere models 
are well suited 
for studying the 
modelling of 
impact breakage 
of pre-existing 
agglomerates.
The Monte Carlo 
algorithm is 
incorporated into 
many program 
languages 
thereby making 
the coding part 
of the simulation 
fast and reliable.
The principles 
behind the 
Monte Carlo 
techniques 
are easy to 
follow, and 
the principles 
may be used 
elsewhere in 
the granulation 
process – e.g. in 
the prediction 
of the wetting 
behaviour of 
the atomised 
droplets on the 
fluidised particle 
bed. 
Monte Carlo 
models are 
capable of 
predicting steady 
state conditions. 
The Finite 
Element method 
is well suited 
for irregular 
geometries and 
heterogeneous 
materials.
FE models 
require fewer 
assumptions 
than any of the 
other principles.
A range of 
commercial FE 
programmes 
is available, 
making the 
coding part of 
the simulation 
fast and reliable.

Summary
Disadvantages
Knowledge of the 
equation of state 
for the particles is 
needed a-priori. 
Results from 
empty vessel CFD 
simulations may 
not readily be used 
when particles are 
being processed. 
In CFD models 
for fluid bed 
granulation, 
contacts between 
fluid, particles and 
boundary surfaces 
are not considered 
explicitly with 
respect to particle 
inertia and the 
mechanical 
properties of the 
particles. 
Due to the 
obvious need 
for accounting 
precise particle 
level properties 
into fluid bed 
hydrodynamic 
models, CFD 
models must 
be regarded as 
inappropriate for 
simulating particle 
systems.
Hard-sphere models 
lack precision in fluid 
bed processes without 
rapid particle flow.
Although hard-
sphere simulations 
can yield both size 
and composition 
distribution of 
granules, it is generally 
not suitable for 
realistic representation 
of the granule 
microstructure (i.e. the 
internal distribution 
of primary solids, 
binder and porosity 
of the granule). 
Microstructure is an 
important property 
especially in the case 
with enzyme granules 
as it determines the 
release rate of the 
enzyme ingredient 
from the granule. 
Present models 
are only capable 
of accounting for 
50,000 granules at 
the time, thereby 
making simulations 
comparable only to 
experimental data 
from laboratory scale 
fluid beds.
Soft-particle 
simulations 
struggle with high 
computational 
processing 
demands.
Detailed information 
of binary collisions 
is far from being 
representative of the 
situation inside a 
fluid bed. 
Although soft-
sphere simulations 
can yield both size 
and composition 
distribution of 
granules, it is 
generally not 
suitable for realistic 
representation 
of the granule 
microstructure 
(i.e. the internal 
distribution of 
primary solids, 
binder and porosity 
of the granule). 
Microstructure 
is an important 
property especially 
in the case with 
enzyme granules as 
it determines the 
release rate of the 
enzyme ingredient 
from the granule. 
Limited available 
literature makes 
Monte Carlo 
simulations yet 
an unproven 
technique. 
A-priori 
knowledge from 
experiments is 
needed as input 
in the models.
As time is an 
important 
parameter in 
the granulation 
process, time 
scale statements 
should be 
incorporated 
into Monte Carlo 
models before 
any advanced 
simulation of 
the fluid bed 
granulation 
process should 
be reliable.
Limited available 
literature makes 
Finite Element 
simulations yet 
an unproven 
technique.
Problems with 
boundary 
conditions 
means that FE 
until recently has 
been unsuited 
for simulations 
of systems in 
random motion.
Large processing 
time even 
with modern 
computers.

1.	
Some of the newest studies in granulation modelling do however indirectly include population balance 
equations as well as discrete element simulation techniques (e.g. Gantt & Gatzke, 2005).
2.	
Fluid dynamics is the sub discipline of fluid mechanics that studies fluids in motion. Fluids are specifically 
gases and liquids. Commonly, fluid dynamics is divided into sub disciplines being aerosol dynamics (the 
study of gases) and hydrodynamics (the study of fluids and thereby fluid like systems) (Wikipedia, 2005).
3.	
Also known as “Continuum models” or “Eulerian-Eulerian models” (Goldschmidt, 2001 and Taghipour 
et al., 2005).
4.	
Actually Computational Fluid Dynamics is formally the overall term for all hydrodynamic modelling 
(and thereby also for DEM), but it has become common to refer to other terms when granular dynamics 
is involved (Hoomans, 1999).
5.	
An excellent review of available commercial CFD programmes can be found in Xia & Sun (2002).
6.	
Hoomans (1999) has compared the results of a soft-sphere model to those of a hard-sphere model and 
found that, provided that the spring stiffness was high enough, the difference in bed hydrodynamics 
between the two types of models were very small. This further supports the soft-particle approach for 
fluid bed modelling.
7.	
The term “Monte Carlo” refers in general to any technique of statistical sampling employed to approximate 
solutions to quantitative problems such as dice tosses or the chance that two particles in a bulk sample 
will collide (Webopedia, 2005).
