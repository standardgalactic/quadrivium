Author’s Acknowledgments
Thanks as always to executive editor Steve Hayes at Wiley, who was the fi rst 
to see that a book about digital SLR cameras should cover both the cameras 
and photography in depth. Special thanks, as both author and avid consumer 
of For Dummies books, go out to Wiley for publishing books like this one 
in full color at a price anyone can afford. Technical editor Mike Sullivan, as 
usual, provided his sage advice from the viewpoint of one of the pioneers of 
digital SLRs, dating back more than 15 years. Mike was also quick to come 
up with useful photos to illustrate particular points when my own portfolio 
came up short.
More thanks to project editor Nicole Sholly and copy editor Laura Miller for 
keeping this book looking sharp. Working behind the scenes was my agent, 
Carole Jelen.

Digital SLR Cameras & Photography For Dummies, 3rd Edition 

Introduction
T
he digital single-lens reflex (dSLR) is the great step upward for photogra-
phers who want to expand their creative horizons — or simply just get 
better pictures. Whether you want to become a serious photo hobbyist, have 
a hankering to turn pro, or want to take advantage of the improved control 
that digital SLRs give you over your photography, discovering how to use 
this tool of the future should be high on your priorities list.
The latest digital SLRs have features that no one had even dreamed of back 
when I wrote the first edition of this book. All the major bugs of the earli-
est dSLRs have been magically transformed into killer features in the latest 
models. Today, you can preview your images by using Live View features 
before you snap the shutter. Dust that collects on the sensor causes much 
less of a problem thanks to built-in sensor-cleaning features. You get better 
image quality than in earlier models, thanks to higher resolutions (you can 
commonly get 15 megapixels and up, even in low-cost dSLRs), super-sensitive 
sensors that can capture images in near darkness, and inexpensive but effec-
tive anti-shake technology built into cameras or lenses.
Most recently, the only remaining drawback of digital SLRs — the fact that 
you couldn’t shoot movies (long a common feature in point-and-shoot 
cameras) — was swept aside with the introduction of new models that grab 
HDTV-quality video with sound.
Best of all, all these capabilities are eminently affordable. Digital SLRs in the 
$500-to-$1,000 range today can outshoot the $5,000 professional models of 
five years ago and are light-years ahead of even the best point-and-shoot 
models. The dSLR provides more control over what portions of your image 
you want in sharp focus, boasts lower levels of the annoying grain effect 
called noise, and operates fast enough to capture the most fleeting action. 
If that isn’t enough, you can change lenses, too, adding super-wide perspec-
tives or the huge magnification possibilities of long, long telephoto lenses to 
your repertoire.
Almost all the other advantages of digital photography come with your digi-
tal SLR camera, too. You can review your image immediately, upload the 
photo to your computer, make adjustments, and print a sparkling full-color 
print within minutes. You never need to buy film. You decide which images 
to print and how large to make them. You can proudly display your digital 
photographic work framed on your wall or over your fireplace. You can even 
make wallet-sized photos, send copies to friends in e-mail, or create an online 
gallery that relatives and colleagues can view over the Web.

About This Book
Technology and techniques — you can find both in this book. Understanding 
exactly how a digital SLR works can help you use its capabilities more fully. 
By mastering the technology, you’re better equipped to understand how to 
use interchangeable lenses, set up speedy continuous-shooting burst modes, 
apply selective focus, and shoot under the lowest light levels. Understanding 
how a point-and-shoot digital camera works offers you little advantage 
because such entry-level cameras don’t give you the creative control that a 
dSLR does.
You don’t need to understand internal combustion to drive a Porsche, but it 
helps if you know a little about double-clutching and limited-slip differentials. 
Technology also provides the grounding you need to work with advanced 
photographic techniques, such as the ones I discuss in this book. I fill these 
pages with basic information and tips that you can use to hone your skills 
while you grow as a digital SLR photographer.
Foolish Assumptions
This book is written for both experienced and budding photographers who 
have a good grasp of using their computers and navigating the operating 
system, as well as at least a cursory knowledge of the operation of their digi-
tal SLR camera. You needn’t be an expert photographer — all you need is a 
desire to improve your skills and knowledge.
Because dSLRs are a more-advanced type of digital camera, you might be 
making the upgrade from a conventional film SLR. At the very least, I assume 
that you aren’t new to photography and have some knowledge of conven-
tional photography. If so, this book helps you fine-tune your capabilities.
Although most of the emphasis in this book is on picture-taking, I offer a 
couple chapters on image-editing, too, so you can get the most from those 
chapters if you have some familiarity with an image editor, such as Corel 
Paint Shop Pro, Adobe Photoshop, or Adobe Photoshop Elements.
How This Book Is Organized
Organization is your friend! All the chapters in this book are grouped together 
into parts that address a broad, general area of interest. If you’re especially

 Introduction
keen to know more about a particular topic, such as how to select the perfect 
dSLR or its accessories, turn to the part of the book that includes that mate-
rial. You don’t have to read this book in any particular order. You can absorb 
each part and chapter on its own. (If I explore a certain topic, such as shut-
ter lag or infrared photography, in more detail elsewhere in the book, I give 
you a cross-reference pointing to the relevant section in case you want more 
information.) Skim through and study the photo examples or examine only 
the odd-numbered pages, if you prefer. It’s your choice. I hope that eventu-
ally you wade through the whole thing, but my top priority is delivering the 
information that you need right now to take better photographs.
Part I: Digital SLRs and You
Find out all the advantages of digital SLRs and why they beat the pants off 
both film and digital point-and-shoot cameras. Take a safari through the 
innards of a typical dSLR to track down the most-needed and most-desired 
features. Then, choose the accessories that can take your dSLR to the next 
level.
Part II: Oh, Shoot!
Digital SLRs bristle with controls and components that give you absolute sov-
ereignty over virtually every feature and function. In this part, you work with 
those controls, master the mysteries of interchangeable lenses, and discover 
special features, such as image stabilization.
Part III: Beyond the Basics
It’s time to take the next step and improve your photography by using 
more advanced features, such as the RAW format and your dSLR’s action, 
sequence shooting, and flash capabilities. Apply these advanced features to 
get better compositions in a variety of settings.
Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output
Your creative possibilities don’t end when the shutter snaps. After you trans-
fer the photo to your computer, you can further enhance and refine your pic-
ture by using image-editing software. Then, make hard-copy prints that you 
can show off, hang on the wall, or display on your mantel. This part shows 
you some of the things that you can do with your prize (and prize-winning) 
photos.

In This Chapter
▶ Discovering why digital SLRs are a big deal
▶ Exploring dSLR advantages
▶ Looking at downsides? What downsides?
N
ow that you can buy a fully featured digital SLR (or dSLR) for five 
Benjamins or less, virtually everyone (including your grandmother) 
probably knows that SLR stands for single lens reflex. However, your Nana — 
or you, for that matter — might not know precisely what single lens reflex 
means. SLR is a camera (either film or digital) that uses a marvelous system 
of mirrors or prisms to provide bright, clear optical viewing of the image that 
you’re about to take — through the same lens that the camera uses to take 
the picture. The very latest dSLRs offer an even more interesting 
option — the ability to bypass the optical viewfinder and pre-
view your image right on the LCD (liquid crystal display) 
on the back of the camera (which also uses the same 
lens that the camera uses to take the picture).
But the key thing to know about dSLRs is that 
they’re very cool tools that you can use to take 
photos electronically.
Welcome to the chapter that tells you exactly how 
smart you were when you decided to upgrade from 
whatever you were using previously to a digital 
single lens reflex camera. In this chapter, you find 
out how a digital SLR transforms the way you take and 
make pictures, why you may find the strengths of the 
dSLR important, and how even the very few downsides of 
previous digital SLRs have been vanquished in recent years. Now 
that digital SLRs have become a big deal, you can get in on the action.

dSLR: dNext Great Digital Camera
Surprise! Digital SLRs are now available in virtually every price range. As 
recently as 2003 (the Dark Ages of digital photography), a basic entry-level 
dSLR could cost $2,000 or more. At that time, the original Canon Digital Rebel 
and Nikon D70 models made it possible for serious photographers to pur-
chase a real dSLR — with lens — for less than $1,000. A few years later, you 
could get similar kits — but with more resolution and improved features — 
for $599 or less. Today, you’d have difficulty finding a dSLR that doesn’t have 
at least 12 million pixels of image-grabbing sharpness.
So, almost anyone can afford to make the jump to a digital SLR. If you already 
have, you’ve discovered that the dSLR lets you take pictures the way they’re 
meant to be taken. After they use other film or digital cameras, avid photog-
raphers interested in taking professional-looking photos notice why dSLRs 
stand out:
 
✓ You can view a big, bright image that represents (almost) exactly what 
you see in the final picture. No peering through a tiny window at a min-
iature version of your subject with a tiny optical viewfinder. Digital SLRs 
have big and bright viewfinders that show virtually the entire image, so 
you don’t have to wonder whether you chopped off the top of someone’s 
head. Using the optical viewfinder, which comes as standard equipment on 
every dSLR, means that you don’t have to squint to compose your image at 
arm’s length on an LCD (liquid crystal display) viewfinder that washes out 
in bright sunlight. However, if lighting conditions permit, most digital SLRs 
also allow you to preview your picture on the back-panel LCD (just like a 
point-and-shoot camera), giving you the best of both viewing worlds.
 
✓ A dSLR responds to an itchy trigger finger almost instantly. Forget 
about pressing the shutter release and then waiting a second or two 
before the camera decides to snap the shot. Although newer point-and-
shoot cameras are more responsive than older versions, few match the 
ability of dSLRs to crank out shots as fast as you can press the button. 
Even fewer point-and-shoot cameras are capable of the four-to-nine-
frames-per-second continuous shooting rates available with some of the 
digital SLRs aimed at more advanced photographers.
 
✓ You have the freedom to switch among lenses. For instance, you can 
switch among an all-purpose zoom lens, a super-wide-angle lens, an 
extra-long telephoto lens, a close-up lens, or other specialized optics 
quicker than you can say 170-500mm F/5-6.3 APO Aspherical AutoFocus 
Telephoto Zoomexpialidocious. (Best of all, you don’t even have to know 
what that tongue-twister of a name means!)
 
 Just be prepared to succumb to lens lust, a strange malady that strikes 
all owners of dSLRs sooner or later. Before you know it, you find yourself 
convinced that you must have optical goodies, such as the lens shown 
in Figure 1-1 — a telephoto lens that’s absolutely essential (you think)

other chapters in this part) intro-
duce you to the technical advantages 
of the digital SLR and how you can 
use the dSLR features to their fullest. 
When you’re ready to expand your 
photographic horizons even further, 
Parts II, III, and IV help you master 
the basics of digital photography, 
go beyond the basics to conquer the 
mysteries of photo arenas (such as

phy), and then discover how you can 
fine-tune your images, organizing them for sharing and printing.
Improving Your Photography with a dSLR
The differences between digital SLRs and the camera that you used before you 
saw the (digital SLR) light depends on where you’re coming from. If your most 
recent camera was a point-and-shoot digital model, you know the advantages 
of being able to review your photos on an LCD screen an instant after you 
take them. And, if you’re serious about photography, you also understand the 
benefits of fine-tuning your photos in an image editor. If you’re making a long-
delayed switch to a digital SLR from a film SLR, you’re likely a photo enthusiast 
already and well aware that a single lens reflex offers you extra control over 
framing, using focus creatively, and choosing lenses to produce the best per-
spective. And, if you’re making the huge leap from a point-and-shoot non-SLR 
film camera to a digital SLR, you’re in for some real revelations.
A digital SLR has (almost) all the good stuff available in a lesser digital 
camera, with some significant advantages that enable you to take your photo 
endeavors to a new, more glorious level of excellence. Certainly, you can 
take close-ups or sports photos by using any good-quality film or digital 
camera. Low-light photography, travel pictures, or portraits are all within 
Figure 1-1: Playing with lenses, lenses, and 
more lenses is one of the inevitable joys of 
working with a dSLR.

the capabilities of any camera. But digital SLRs let you capture these kinds of 
images more quickly, more flexibly, and with more creativity at your finger-
tips. Best of all (at least, for Photoshop slaves), a digital SLR can solve prob-
lems that previously required you to work long hours over a hot keyboard.
Despite the comparisons you can make to other cameras, a digital SLR isn’t 
just a simple upgrade from a conventional film camera or another type of 
digital camera. A dSLR is very different from a film SLR, even though some 
vendors still offer film and dSLRs that look quite a bit alike and share simi-
lar exposure metering, automatic focusing, and other electronics, as well as 
interchangeable lenses. If you look closely, you can find that the digital SLR 
camera is different than a film SLR, and you use it differently to take pictures.
In the sections that follow, I introduce you to the advanced features and 
inner workings of a dSLR so that you can begin getting the most out of your 
camera.
Composing shots with a more accurate viewfinder
When you use non-SLR cameras, what you see isn’t always what you get.
Theoretically, the LCD on the back of a point-and-shoot digital camera should 
show exactly what you get in the finished picture — and many of these LCDs 
do just that, offering a 100-percent view of the image you end up with. After 
all, the same sensor that actually captures the photo produces the LCD image 
in a point-and-shoot camera. In practice, you might find the LCD difficult to 
view under bright light, and it appears so small when you hold the camera 
at the requisite arm’s length that you may feel like you’re trying to judge 
your image by looking at a postage stamp that’s gone through the wash a 
few times.
You probably find the view through a non-SLR digital camera’s optical 
viewfinder — if it even has one — even worse than a point-and-shoot digital 
camera’s LCD screen: diminutive, inaccurate enough to make chopping off 
heads alarmingly easy, and offering no information about what’s in focus and 
what isn’t.
More advanced cameras might use an electronic viewfinder (EVF), which is a 
second, internal LCD that the user views through a window. You can find this 
kind of viewfinder in many so-called super-zoom cameras that have a fixed 
lens with a versatile, relatively long zoom range. EVFs provide a larger image 
that’s formed by the actual light falling on the sensor, and you can use an 
EVF in full sunlight without the viewfinder washing out. However, EVFs might 
not have enough pixels to accurately portray your subject, and they tend 
to degenerate into blurred, ghosted images if the camera or subject moves 
during framing. They also don’t work well in low light levels. An EVF super-
zoom model is a good compromise, but you can’t preview an image as easily 
using this kind of camera as you can by using a dSLR.

11
 Chapter 1: The Digital SLR Difference
A digital SLR’s optical viewfinder, in contrast, closely duplicates what the 
sensor sees, even though the image is formed optically and not generated by 
the sensor itself. It’s all done with mirrors (and other reflective surfaces) that 
bounce the light from the lens to your viewfinder, sampling only a little of the 
light to measure exposure, color, and focus. As a result, the viewfinder image 
is usually bigger and brighter — from 75 percent to 95 percent (or more) of 
life size by using a dSLR normal lens or zoom position, compared with 25 per-
cent or smaller with a point-and-shoot camera’s optical or LCD viewfinder. 
You see 95 percent of the total area captured, too, with a dSLR camera.
Check out Figure 1-2 and decide which view of your subject you’d rather 
work with. You may find the 3-inch LCD on the point-and-shoot model (in the 
upper-left corner of Figure 1-2) difficult to view in bright light; the electronic 
viewfinder (in the upper-right corner of the figure) can give you fuzzy images, 
making it hard for you to judge focus. The digital SLR’s big, bright viewfinder 
(at the bottom of Figure 1-2) is, as Goldilocks would say, just right.
 
 
 Figure 1-2: A point-and-shoot LCD (upper-left) or an EVF LCD (upper-right) is no match for a 
dSLR’s optical system (bottom).

12
Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
A dSLR’s optical viewfinder shows you approximately what’s in sharp focus 
and what isn’t (the depth-of-field), either in general terms (all the time) or 
more precisely when you press a handy button called the depth-of-field 
preview, which many dSLRs have. You probably find your dSLR viewing 
experience more pleasant, more accurate, and better suited for your cre-
ative endeavors. If you switch to a camera’s Live View mode (if your camera 
includes that mode) to preview the image on the back-panel LCD, you can 
often perceive depth-of-field, but under high light levels, the LCD can be just 
as difficult to see as on a point-and-shoot camera.
Flexing the powerful sensor
With very few exceptions, digital SLR sensors are much bigger than their 
point-and-shoot camera counterparts, and this size gives them a larger area 
that can capture light and, potentially, great sensitivity to lower light levels. 
(Some non-SLR cameras give up compactness to provide somewhat larger 
sensors, but they’re still fairly rare.)
A dSLR’s extra sensitivity pays off when you want to
 
✓ Take pictures in dim light.
 
✓ Freeze action by using shorter exposure times.
 
✓ Use smaller lens openings to increase the amount of subject matter 
that’s in sharp focus.
Within the Canon digital camera 
line alone, you find digital SLRs that 
have 22.2mm-x-14.8mm to 24mm-x-
36mm sensors (the size of a 35mm 
film frame). By comparison, some 
of Canon’s digital point-and-shoot 
cameras use a sensor that measures 
only 7.8mm x 5.32mm. Put in terms 
that make sense to human beings, 
the dSLR sensors have 8 to 20 times 
more area than their Lilliputian 
point-and-shoot sensor-mates. 
Figure 1-3 gives you a better idea of 
the relative sizes.
If you think of a sensor as a rectan-
gular bucket and the light falling on 
it as a soft drizzle of rain, the large 
buckets (or sensors) can collect more drops (or the particles of light called 
Figure 1-3: These images represent the 
comparative size of a dSLR’s 24mm-x-36mm 
sensor (upper left) and 22.2mm-x-14.8mm 
sensor (center), and a point-and-shoot digital 
camera’s 7.8mm-x-5.32mm sensor (bottom).

 Chapter 1: The Digital SLR Difference
photons) more quickly than the small ones. Because a certain minimum 
number of photons is required to register a picture, a large sensor can collect 
the required amount more quickly, making it more sensitive than a smaller 
sensor under the same conditions.
In photography, the sensitivity to light is measured by using a yardstick 
called ISO (International Organization for Standardization). Most point-and-
shoot digital cameras have a sensitivity range of about ISO 50 to ISO 100 (at 
the low end), up to a maximum of ISO 800 to ISO 3200 (at the high end). Some 
point-and-shoot models have even higher sensitivity settings, but it remains 
to be seen how useful these ultra-high ISO non-SLR models are. Indeed, many 
models that have high ISO settings generally don’t do a very good job in 
terms of image quality.
 
In contrast, digital SLRs — which have more sensitive sensors and larger 
light-gathering pixels — commonly have usable ISO settings of up to at least 
ISO 1600. Many are capable of ISO 3200 or may range up to a lofty ISO 25600! 
This extra speed does have a downside, as you can see in the following section. 
But, in general, the added sensitivity allows people to shoot photos in dim 
light, take action pictures, or stretch the amount of depth-of-field available.
Reducing noise in your photos
Visual noise (or just noise) is that grainy look that digital photos sometimes 
get, usually noticeable as multi-colored speckles most visible in the dark or 
shadow areas of an image. Although you can sometimes use noise as a cre-
ative effect, it generally destroys detail in your image and might limit how 
much you can enlarge a photo before the graininess becomes obtrusive.
The most common types of noise are produced at higher sensitivity settings. 
Cameras achieve the loftier ISO numbers by amplifying the original electronic 
signal, and any background noise present in the signal is multiplied along with 
the image information. Figure 1-4 shows an image with a relatively low ISO 
value of 200 that’s virtually free of noise and an image with a sensitivity of ISO 
1600. The ISO 1600 sensitivity produces a lot more noise than the ISO 200 — 
even though someone took both pictures by using a digital SLR.
 
Point-and-shoot digicams often don’t have ISO settings beyond ISO 1600 
because the noise becomes excessive at higher ratings, sometimes even 
worse than you see in the bottom example in Figure 1-4. However, you can 
boost the information that the big dSLR sensors capture to high ISO settings 
with relatively low overall noise. I’ve used digital SLRs that had less noise at 
ISO 1600 than some poor-performing point-and-shoots displayed at ISO 400. 
Obviously, the large sensors in dSLRs score a slam-dunk in the noise depart-
ment and make high ISO ratings feasible when you really, really need them.

14
Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
 
 
Figure 1-4: A noise-free photo shot at ISO 200 (top); a noisy photo shot 
 
at ISO 1600 (bottom).
Noise doesn’t always result simply from using high ISO settings: Long expo-
sures can cause another kind of noise. Although some techniques can reduce 
the amount of noise present in a photo (as you can discover in Chapter 2), by 
and large, digital SLR cameras are far superior to their non-SLR counterparts 
when it comes to smooth, noise-free images.
 
Thanks to the disparity in size alone, all sensors of a particular resolution 
are not created equal, and sensors that have fewer megapixels might actu-
ally be superior to high-resolution pixel-grabbers. For example, most older 
10-megapixel dSLRs produce superior results to some of the newest 
12-megapixel non-SLR digicams. So, no matter how many megapixels a 
point-and-shoot camera’s sensor can hoard, that sensor generally isn’t as big 
as a dSLR’s. And when it comes to reducing noise, the size of the sensor is 
one of the most important factors.

 Chapter 1: The Digital SLR Difference
Reclaiming depth-of-field control
Depth-of-field is the range over which components of your image are accept-
ably sharp. In general, you want to be able to control the amount of depth-
of-field because having more or less depth-of-field gives you creative control 
over what’s sharp and what isn’t in your photos. You might prefer to zero 
in on a specific subject and let everything else remain blurry. Or you might 
want to have everything in your frame as sharp as possible.
To understand how dSLR cameras give you more control over depth-of-field, 
you need to understand the three factors that control this range, which I out-
line in Table 1-1.
Table 1-1 
How Depth-of-Field Affects Photos
Factor
How It Affects a Photo
The distance between 
the camera and the 
subject
The closer your subject is to the camera, the greater 
the tendency for the objects in front or behind the 
subject to blur in the photo.
The size of the lens 
opening (the f-stop or 
aperture) used to take 
the picture
Larger f-stops (smaller numbers), such as f/2 or f/4, 
produce less depth-of-field than smaller f-stops 
(larger numbers), such as f/11 or f/16. Remember: The 
size of the numbers are reversed because apertures 
are actually the denominators of fractions, so ½ and 
1/4 are larger than 1/11 or 1/16.
The magnification (or 
focal length) of the lens
The shorter the focal length of the lens (say, 18mm or 
20mm), the more depth-of-field is present. When the 
focal length grows longer (say, to 70mm or 100mm), 
depth-of-field shrinks.
Point-and-shoot digital cameras offer very little control over depth-of-field 
because unless you’re shooting an extreme close-up, virtually everything is 
in sharp focus. This condition (which you may not like if you’re trying to use 
focus selectively) occurs because non-SLR digital cameras that use tiny sen-
sors also must have lenses of a much shorter focal length — smaller sensors 
require a shorter focal length to produce the same field of view.
So, a point-and-shoot digital camera might have a 7.5mm-to-22.5mm 3X zoom 
lens that provides a slightly-wide-angle-to-slightly-telephoto field of view. A 
digital SLR with the largest (24mm-x-36mm) sensor might need a 35mm-to-
105mm zoom to provide the same perspective.
Yet, depth-of-field is dependent on the actual focal length, not the equivalent. 
So, that point-and-shoot camera’s lens, even at its longest telephoto position 
(22.5mm), provides more depth-of-field than the dSLR’s same-perspective 
zoom at its widest angle. So much is in focus with a non-SLR digital camera 

16
Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
that, in practice, you have very little control over depth-of-field, except when 
shooting close-up pictures from very short distances.
You can see the effect of the maximum aperture in Figure 1-5, which was shot 
at a small lens opening (f/22). Although the focus is on the building block in 
the middle, all the blocks are fairly sharp. Shooting the same scene at f/5.6 
shows how you can creatively use control over depth-of-field to isolate a sub-
ject (see Figure 1-6). Only the middle-left red block is in sharp focus, whereas 
the others are blurred. In Chapter 6, I explain depth-of-field in more detail.
 
 
 Figure 1-5: A small aperture yields too much depth-of-field for selective 
focus.
 
 
 Figure 1-6: By using a large f-stop, you can easily isolate a subject with 
a creative application of blur.

 Chapter 1: The Digital SLR Difference
Taking photos faster
Everything about a digital SLR seems to work more quickly and responsively. 
You may find that speed important when you want to make a grab shot on 
the spur of the moment or expect the camera to take an action photo right 
now when you press the shutter release at the peak moment. Many point-
and-shoot digital cameras are downright sluggardly compared to dSLRs when 
it comes to performance (although some vendors have worked very hard 
to close the gap). You can find improved speed in three key areas, which I 
explain in the following sections.
Wake-up time
You can have a relatively fast non-SLR digicam powered up and ready to snap 
its first photo in as little as two seconds. Many of these cameras take three 
to four seconds to emerge from their slumber. Worse, because they consume 
so much power (thanks to the rear-panel LCD), these cameras may go into 
stand-by mode or shut off completely if you don’t take a picture for 30 to 
60 seconds.
 
When you flip the power switch of a dSLR, the camera is usually ready to 
take the picture before you can move the viewfinder up to your eye. Some 
dSLRs are ready to go in 0.2 of a second! Digital SLRs don’t need to go to 
sleep, either, because they consume so little power when not in active use. 
I’ve left dSLRs switched on for days at a time with little perceptible draining 
of the battery (but not in Live View mode, of course). Certainly, the autofocus 
and auto-exposure mechanisms go on standby a few seconds after you move 
your finger from the shutter release, but you can have them available again 
instantly by giving a quick tap to the button.
Shot-to-shot time
Conventional digital cameras have limits on how quickly you can take pic-
tures in succession. Unless you’re using the motor-drive-like burst mode, one 
shot every second or two is about all you can expect. Even in burst mode, 
you’re lucky to get much more than one to three frames per second for 5 to 
11 shots, max. Some point-and-shoot cameras do allow you to fire off shots 
continuously for longer periods (in some cases, until the memory card is 
full!), but you don’t find such speediness in the average entry-level digital 
snapshot camera.
But all digital SLRs have relatively large amounts of built-in memory that 
temporarily store each photo that you snap before the camera transfers it to 
your memory card at high speed. You can probably take pictures in single-
shot mode as quickly as you can press the shutter release, and for at least 
eight to ten shots before a slight pause kicks in. If you use a fast dSLR that 
has some quality level settings, you can often keep taking pictures for as long 
as your finger (or memory card) holds out.

A dSLR’s burst mode can typically capture three to nine frames per second 
for 12 to 30 shots, depending on the speed of the camera and the quality 
level you choose — low quality (high compression) settings produce smaller 
images that the camera can write to the memory card quickly (see Figure 1-7). 
No common point-and-shoot camera comes anywhere close to that level of 
performance at full resolution, even though a few can shoot at sustained frame 
rates that allow you to produce movie-like effects with your still images.
Shutter lag
When I’ve spoken before groups promoting my other books, such as Digital 
Photography All-in-One For Dummies, 4th Edition (Wiley Publishing, Inc.), 
here’s the number one question I get from new digital photographers — 
“What can I do about shutter lag!?!” Digicam owners seem to really dislike 
their camera’s shutter lag — the pause between the moment you click the 
shutter button and the moment the sensor captures a slightly different 
image. Some snapshot cameras are worse than others, of course, but you can 
still find many models available that produce an annoying lag between press-
ing the button and taking the picture.
Digital SLRs also experience shutter lag, but it’s likely so brief — on the order 
of 0.1 to 0.2 of a second — that you never notice it. Of course, dSLRs have 
little shutter lag only most of the time. Point your lens at a difficult-to-focus 
subject, such as the sky, or try to take a photo under low light, and your 
speedy autofocus lens might hunt back and forth while you gnash your 
teeth in frustration. (You can discover some ways around this problem in 
Chapter 5.)
Figure 1-7: Digital SLRs make shooting high-speed action sequences easy.

 Chapter 1: The Digital SLR Difference
A dSLR works like a camera
Another reason why digital SLRs have improved performance is that they’re 
easier to use, so you, as the photographer, can work quickly while you shoot. 
The manufacturers configure most point-and-shoot cameras for consumers 
who simply want to grab a quick snapshot, instead of investing some artistry 
in creating a photograph.
Moreover, point-and-shoot cameras tend to be designed by an engineer who 
did a really, really good job adding photo capabilities to the vendor’s cell-
phone line last year, and who obviously must be the best choice to cobble 
together a full-fledged digital camera. Indeed, the line between cell-phone 
cameras and digital snapshot cameras is blurring all the time. (I predicted a 
few years ago that soon photographers would be able to get only two kinds of 
cameras: cell-phone-integrated point-and-shoot cameras and digital SLRs.)
Like a cell phone, non-SLR digital cameras tend to have most of the controls 
tucked away out of sight in the menu system, where the average consumer 
never has to see them and where the photo enthusiast has to hunt for them.
Digital SLRs, on the other hand, are always designed by a team of engineers 
who have extensive photographic experience. They know which controls a 
photographer absolutely needs and which controls they can bury away in the 
menus because you access those controls only when setting up the camera 
and maybe once a month (if that) thereafter.
 
Digital SLR designers know that you don’t want to go three levels deep into a 
menu to set the ISO sensitivity or adjust white (color) balance for the type of 
illumination that you’re using. You want to press an ISO or a WB (white bal-
ance) key and dial in the setting without giving it much thought. You don’t 
want to activate an onscreen display to set shutter speed or aperture — you 
want to have separate dials for each. Nature intended that you zoom and 
manually focus your camera by twisting a ring on the lens — not by pressing 
a little lever and letting a motor adjust the lens at its own pace.
Simply having a camera that operates like a camera, rather than like a DVD 
player, makes your picture-taking much easier and faster.
Getting more lens flexibility
When you work with a non-SLR, you use the lens mounted on the camera. In 
the past, some models had add-on telephoto and wide-angle attachments. 
You can still find such accessories, but they tend to subtract a bit of sharp-
ness, even while they change the camera’s viewpoint.

20
Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
So, point-and-shoot camera owners must decide at the time they buy the 
camera what kind of pictures they intend to shoot. If they want to take a lot 
of photos indoors or of architecture outdoors, they might need cameras 
that have the equivalent of a film camera’s 24mm wide-angle lens, which is 
still fairly rare among non-dSLR models. (And, if they need something even 
wider, they’re probably out of luck.) Perhaps a photographer wants to shoot 
sports, so he or she needs a lens that’s the equivalent of a 400mm lens on a 
film camera. You can find those lenses available, although not generally with 
cameras that also have wide-angle capabilities.
Digital SLR camera owners have fewer limitations. I own a 12mm-to-24mm 
zoom that’s the equivalent of an 18mm-to-36mm wide-angle lens on a dSLR 
that has a sensor of less than full-frame size. (You can find out more about 
full-frame sensors and why lenses are measured in equivalents in Chapter 2.) 
Other lenses that I own cover every single focal length, up to 500mm (750mm 
equivalent). I have two lenses designed especially for close-up photography 
and others that have fast f/1.4 apertures, which are perfect for low-light 
sports shooting. I haven’t come close to exhausting the possibilities, either: 
You can find longer and wider lenses than what I own, along with specialized 
optics that do tasks such as canceling sharpness-robbing vibration caused by 
a photographer’s unsteady hand.
 
Owners of dSLR cameras don’t have to mortgage their homes to buy these 
lenses, either. Camera vendors offer some very sharp-fixed focal length 
lenses (prime lenses) for around $100. You can find inexpensive 70mm-to-
210mm zoom lenses for as little as $150 to $200. A versatile 28mm-to-200mm 
zoom that I bought a few years ago cost only $300. Because dSLRs can often 
use lenses designed for their film camera counterparts, you can find hun-
dreds of inexpensive used lenses, too. If you have a non-dSLR, you frequently 
have to buy a new camera to expand your lens horizons. You can find out 
more about selecting lenses in Chapter 6.
Freeing yourself from image editors
Digital SLRs do more than change how you take pictures. They change how 
you make pictures, as well. Perhaps you’re a seasoned image editor, accus-
tomed to cropping images in Photoshop or Photoshop Elements to mimic the 
extreme telephoto perspective that your previous camera couldn’t duplicate. 
You might have used an image editor’s Zoom Blur feature because your digi-
cam’s zoom lens didn’t zoom fast enough to allow you to create that effect in 
the camera, as shown in Figure 1-8. You’ve faked fish-eye lens effects because 
your camera didn’t have a fish-eye lens, or you’ve manually added lens flare 
instead of trying to create the real thing.
Maybe you had to blur the background of your images in an image editor 
because your digital point-and-shoot camera always brought everything into 
sharp focus (an excellent trait when you want everything in focus, and not so 
great when you want to focus selectively for creative effects).

21
 Chapter 1: The Digital SLR Difference
 
 
Figure 1-8: Don’t settle for fake zoom blur when you can have the real thing.
By using a dSLR, those limitations might be behind you now. A digital SLR can 
do a lot of tricks that you had to fake in Photoshop in the past. Image editors 
are still helpful for some tweaks, as you can find out in Chapters 11 and 12.
A closer look at shutter lag
Typically, the snapshooter can finally coax a 
niece or nephew into smiling and press the shut-
ter release to capture the moment. Or a batter 
swings lustily at a fat pitch and lofts the game-
winning run into the stands just when the pho-
tographer presses the shutter button. However, 
the crucial moment is never captured on pixels.
Instead, the digicam’s autofocus and auto-
exposure mechanisms make some last-minute 
adjustments, a bunch of electronic components 
process some algorithms, and (eventually) the 
camera takes the picture. This period of time is 
measured in ohnoseconds; ohnoseconds are 
the interval between when you want to take the 
picture and when you actually hear the shutter-
click sound that your camera emits. I’ve tested 
hundreds of digital cameras, and the actual 
elapsed time for non-SLRs ranges from 0.6 
seconds to 1.2 seconds under bright, contrasty 
lighting conditions, or up to 1 to 2 seconds in 
dimmer lighting. It just seems even longer than 
that.

22
Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
The Downsides That Have Been Overcome
Of course, the digital SLR isn’t perfect — but it’s getting close. In previous 
editions of this book, I’ve had to include a section that explains, in detail, 
several downsides to using these Wundermaschinen, which ranged from the 
annoying to the almost irrelevant. Today, each of those downsides has been 
virtually vanquished. I address them in decreasing order of concern (at least, 
for most photographers) in the following sections.
The lack or expense of super-wide lenses
Many high-end digital SLRs have sensors that are the same size as the 35mm 
film frame, so you don’t have to calculate equivalency factors. A 200mm lens 
provides the same magnification on a full-frame dSLR as it does on a film 
camera. More importantly, a 16mm or 14mm super-wide-angle lens retains 
the same wide field of view.
More affordable digital SLRs have smaller-than-full-frame sensors (I talk more 
about the sensor-size issue in Chapter 2), so the sensor crops the field of 
view of any lens that you mount on the camera to match the smaller sensor 
size. The crop factor ranges from 1.3 to about 2.0 for the current, er, crop of 
digital SLRs. Therefore, in practice, a 100mm telephoto lens mounted on one 
of these cameras has the same field of view as a longer 130mm-to-160mm 
telephoto lens on a 35mm film camera. Because you figure the effective field 
of view by multiplying the actual focal length by the crop factor, the figure is 
also sometimes called a magnification factor, and where all the mentions of 
“equivalency” come in when comparing lenses. But magnification factor isn’t 
an accurate term because no magnification takes place. The camera simply 
crops out part of what the lens sees. Your 100mm lens might look like it’s 
been magically transformed into a longer 160mm optic, but the depth-of-field 
and other characteristics remain the same as the 100mm lens it really is.
Photographers who shoot sports and distant subjects often love the crop 
factor, even though it gives them nothing they can’t achieve just by cropping 
a full-size frame. The crop factor seems to provide a longer telephoto lens 
for the same money. The good news turns bad, however, when they mount 
28mm wide-angle lenses on their beloved dSLRs and find that they have the 
same field of view as a 45mm standard (normal) lens, or that their favorite 
18mm super-wide lenses are now 29mm ordinary wide-angle optics. (I use a 
1.6 crop factor, typical of Canon cameras, in all these examples.) In this case, 
you get a less wide view from a particular lens.
 
Fortunately, you can find plenty of true wide-angle lenses available for digital 
SLRs, and since the last edition of this book, those lenses have become inexpen-
sive enough that any serious photographer can afford them. Three different 
vendors offer 12mm-to-24mm super-wide zooms for my favorite dSLR, making 
it possible to shoot expansive shots, such as the one shown in Figure 1-9. You 

23
 Chapter 1: The Digital SLR Difference
can get focal lengths down to 8mm to 10mm. If you want to shoot wide and 
have a dSLR that has a crop factor, you can find lenses that provide you with 
the wide-angle view you crave.
 
 
Figure 1-9: You can take panorama-like shots by using an ultra-wide-angle lens.
And remember, most of these lenses are considerably wider than the (cur-
rent) widest-angle optics available for point-and-shoot cameras, which seem 
to get no wider than the equivalent of 24mm with a traditional film camera.
New technologies for fending off dirt and dust
For some dSLR owners, the worst of the camera’s downsides is the plethora 
of dust bunnies and odd particles of matter that seem to attach themselves 
to the camera’s sensor at every opportunity. Fortunately, virtually every digi-
tal SLR introduced in the last few years includes a sensor-shaking device that 
vibrates when the camera is powered up, turned off, or whenever you specify 
to remove these artifacts before they can show up in your photos. Some ven-
dors apply anti-static coatings to keep the dust from sticking to your sensor 
and include a sticky-strip in the sensor chamber to capture the dust that’s 
dislodged by the cleaning process.
 
Even so, take extra care when changing lenses to keep dust from wending its 
way back to the sensor area (which is fully exposed only when you’re taking 
a picture, anyway). Also, find out how to manually clean this dust off your 
sensor, a process that’s much easier to do than it is to describe. I go into the 
details of sensor cleaning in Chapter 4.

24
Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
Some photographers have problems with dust seemingly on a weekly basis. 
Others go months without any infiltrations. If your camera has a sensor-
cleaning feature, dirt and dust and digital SLRs might be a very small prob-
lem for you. But this problem might loom large, depending on your working 
habits, cleanliness, and willingness to stomp out a few artifacts from time to 
time in your image editor.
Live View’s LCD preview
Non-SLR digital cameras have always been able to offer a live preview of the 
image, as seen by the sensor, prior to exposure. Until recently, almost all 
dSLRs couldn’t offer such a preview because the mirror that provides the 
optical view of the subject, which flips up just prior to exposure, is in the 
viewing path. It flips up just prior to exposure. However, virtually all current 
digital SLR cameras introduced in the last year or so use various technolo-
gies, such as simply flipping the mirror up and providing a view of what the 
sensor sees or more complicated systems that use dual sensors or a prism 
that splits incoming light into two paths (one for the sensor and one for the 
viewfinder), to provide a Live View preview.
Use a digital SLR’s larger optical viewfinder if you want to judge composition 
and depth-of-field, and frame fast-moving action. The following sections cover 
the key applications that do benefit from an LCD preview, if your dSLR can 
display one on its back-panel LCD.
Live histograms in real time
A histogram is a graph that displays the tonal range of an image. You can use 
a histogram to judge whether a photograph is or will be under- or overex-
posed. The trained eye can also see whether an image is likely to have exces-
sive contrast or look particularly flat, based on the distribution of tones in a 
histogram.
You can make adjustments to lighting and exposure to improve the rendition 
of a shot. Prior to Live View, you could view dSLR histograms only after the 
fact, when you reviewed the photo you already took. The digital SLR owner 
who has live histogram capabilities can make adjustments before taking the 
next picture. You can find more about the use of histograms in Chapter 5.
Déjà view with extended eye-points
The eye-point is the distance that you can move your eye away from the 
viewfinder and still see the entire image for framing. An extended eye-point 
is useful for sports and other applications where you want to keep an eye on 
what’s happening outside the camera’s viewfinder.

25
 Chapter 1: The Digital SLR Difference
A live LCD preview lets you keep the camera a few inches from your face, or 
even at arm’s length, and still see what the camera will capture. Point-and-
shoot digital cameras and a few dSLRs (including several Sony Alpha models, 
such as the one shown in Figure 1-10), put the LCD on a swiveling mount so 
that you can use it for framing while you hold the camera at waist level, over-
head, or even facing you for a self-portrait.
 
 
 Figure 1-10: Live View and a swiveling LCD are a perfect combination 
for framing shots from any angle.
Infrared imagery not up to your imagination
Infrared photos call for a filter that blocks visible light. All you see through 
the optical viewfinder is a vast expanse of black, which makes framing your 
photo difficult. A live LCD preview gives you some type of image, at least.

26
Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
Although this problem is annoying, you can work around it. Most people 
don’t shoot infrared photos at all. A few dedicated souls convert an extra 
dSLR for full-time infrared use, so they don’t need a visible-light-blocking 
infrared filter. Those photographers who do shoot infrared with their unmod-
ified cameras find that exposures are so long, they need a tripod. If you fall 
into this camp, you have two options:
 
✓ Set up your camera on a tripod, frame your picture, and then mount the 
infrared filter.
 
✓ Frame the photo as best you can (by using Live View, if available), take a 
shot, and then use the after-shot LCD review to make adjustments.
Carrying that weight
Many digital SLRs are much bigger, heavier, and clunkier than pocket-sized 
point-and-shoot digital cameras. Fortunately, camera manufacturers have 
recognized the appeal of smaller dSLRs, so you can find relatively small 
models from Nikon, Olympus, Canon, Sony, Pentax/Samsung, and others. 
Olympus and Panasonic promise even better compactness with their Micro 
Four Thirds lines.
Of course, the more money you spend on a dSLR, the bigger it likely is 
because vendors offer magnesium alloy bodies, rather than the composite 
plastic used for entry-level digital SLRs. Tack on extra battery packs and spe-
cial grips that let you shoot more comfortably in a vertical position, and the 
camera becomes even larger.
This size problem is an annoyance only to someone who needs to travel light. 
For most photographers, the whole point of upgrading to a digital SLR is to 
gain access to the extra lenses and accessories that these cameras can use. 
The extra heft is part of the cost of the greater versatility. Many dSLR owners 
also purchase small point-and-shoot cameras to carry when weight and size 
are important to them.
 
In my case, I often use a compact version of my “big” dSLR as a backup when 
I’m traveling. I fully intend to take all my photos by using my hefty main 
camera, but I’d hate to be without any camera at all in case of a mishap. So, 
the compact dSLR goes in the bag, too, as backup.
Budding Spielbergs no longer out of luck
Most point-and-shoot digital cameras can capture motion-picture clips with 
monaural sound. Many of these cameras offer only poor-quality clips at, say, 
a herky-jerky 10 or 15 frames per second (fps), rather than the standard 30 

27
 Chapter 1: The Digital SLR Difference
fps, and these clips have resolutions as low as 320 x 240 or 160 x 120 pixels. 
You might be limited to 30- or 60-second clips, tops. High-end, non-SLR digital 
cameras might give you virtually TV-quality 640-x-480 resolution at 30 fps 
with decent sound and recording times for as long as the available capacity 
of your memory card holds out. You can even find in-camera trimming and 
editing facilities.
Because a dSLR’s mirror can’t flip up and down 30 times a second (the cur-
rent fastest burst capability tops out at around 11 frames per second), you 
don’t find motion picture capabilities on any dSLR when you use the optical 
viewfinder. However, cameras that have Live View capabilities, such as the 
Nikon D90, Nikon D5000, Canon EOS 5D Mark II and Canon EOS Rebel T1i, 
can shoot HDTV images while providing views of the image on the LCD. Now, 
when you want to shoot digital movies, you no longer have to tote along a 
digital video (DV) camcorder. Few people decide against buying a digital SLR 
because they can’t also shoot movies with it, but it’s certainly a handy fea-
ture to have.
In-camera editing!
Newer digital SLRs now give you the ability to do some simple editing right in 
the camera by using a Retouch menu or other facility. Here are some of the 
benefits of this capability:
 
✓ Correct your images without a computer. Correct colors, change tonal 
values to improve the brightness or darkness of your image, fix red-eye, 
straighten crooked shots — all in the camera and without the need of a 
computer. You may find this capability handy when you want to fix your 
shots and then e-mail them while you’re on the run.
 
✓ Create small copies for Web display or e-mailing. You don’t want to 
send a 12-megapixel file home while you’re traveling. Such an image 
might over-tax your connection when you’re on the road and could 
cause trouble for the person trying to view it. The latest dSLRs let you 
trim, crop, and output a lower-resolution version of your best shots for 
easier Internet distribution.
 
✓ Apply special effects. Convert your image to black-and-white. Add filter 
effects. Combine two shots by using overlay techniques. Add or remove 
distorting effects. Create a fish-eye shot without the need for a fish-eye 
lens. You can find these capabilities in several different dSLR models.

f digital photography is the greatest thing since sliced bread, the digital 
SLR is the toaster — a no-nonsense device that anyone can use to create 
tasty results. Even so, you can get better results if you know a little about how 
your favorite gadget works. You don’t need to understand Ohm’s Law to make 
breakfast, but it’s a good idea to understand a little about a toaster’s innards 
before you poke a fork inside. In the same vein, understanding pixels, lenses, 
and sensors can help you get better results from your photographic appliance.
This chapter takes you on a safari through the darkest recesses 
of the digital SLR to give you a little knowledge about how it 
works before you decide to poke a figurative fork inside.
Megapixels and Why dSLRs 
Have More of Them
If you’ve been working with digital images for a 
while, you know that pixels are your pals. They’re 
the basic building blocks that make up an image. The 
term pixel is a portmanteau, which was Lewis Carroll’s 
term for a new word created by combining two old 
words, such as slimy and lithe to create slithy. In this case, 
pixel stands for picture element and came into vogue when 
computer imaging became popular.
However, you’ve seen pixel-like components outside the digital realm, in 
pointillist paintings, such as the illustrations Georges Seurat created for the 
Broadway musical Sunday in the Park with George. You also see pixel-like 
components in newspaper halftone photos. All these images are made up of 

30
Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
tiny dots that you can see vividly up close, but those dots blend to create 
continuous tones and colors when you view them from a distance, as you can 
see in Figure 2-1. The difference between these picture elements and those 
used to represent digital photos is that the digital pixels are all the same size 
and shape, varying only in brightness and hue.
In digital images, the pixels — tiny squares that you can see individually only 
under magnification — are arranged in rows and columns like a checkerboard 
that happens to measure hundreds of squares on a side. Among current digi-
tal SLRs, this array is a minimum of 3,008 pixels wide and 2,000 pixels tall, 
for a total of 6 million pixels in all. (Although the last of these 6-megapixel 
cameras will probably be phased out early in the life of this book.) The latest 
digital SLR cameras for consumers actually offer many more pixels than that, 
from 3,872 x 2,592 (10 million) pixels for certain entry-level models to 4,288 
x 2,848 (12 million) pixels or more for the majority of digital SLRs. Of course, 
pro and advanced amateur cameras go up to 6,048 x 4,032 (24.5 million) 
pixels. That’s a lot of pixels!
Figure 2-1: Every digital picture is made up of thousands (or millions) of pixels.

31
 Chapter 2: Safari Inside a dSLR
Those pixel counts represent the number of light-sensitive areas in the 
digital camera’s sensor, and the total is usually expressed in terms of mega-
pixels (millions of pixels), and abbreviated MP. The precise dimensions 
might vary, depending on the exact sensor used. For example, the Nikon D40 
uses a 3,008-x-2,000-pixel sensor, but the original Canon Digital Rebel had a 
3,072-x-2,048-pixel array. Both cameras were considered 6MP dSLRs, even 
though the arrangement and number of pixels is slightly different.
Pixelementary, my 
dear Watson
Pixels, represented by individual 
light-sensitive areas in a sensor 
called photosites, capture the detail 
in your image. In general terms, 
the more megapixels, the better 
because when you add pixels, the 
ability of the sensor to capture detail 
improves and the effective resolution 
of the sensor rises.
It’s like dividing a foot-long ruler into 
1,200 increments rather than 120. 
In the former case, the ruler could 
measure things with 1/100-of-an-inch 
accuracy; in the latter, you could 
use the rulings only in 1/10-of-an-inch 
chunks. In the same vein, a sensor of 
a particular size that has 12MP can 
show much finer detail than one the 
same size that has only 6MP.
 
As you can see in Figure 2-2, when 
the size of the pixels decrease, more 
of them can fit on a sensor to cap-
ture ever smaller details of the origi-
nal image. However, image quality 
involves more than resolution alone. 
Many 10MP dSLRs produce sharper 
and more noise-free results than 
12MP non-dSLRs simply because the 
10MP dSLR’s sensors are physically 
larger and each individual pixel is 
better than a non-dSLR’s sensor’s. 
Some dSLRs even outperform other 
dSLRs that have more resolution 
because of the quality of the sensors, 
lenses, or electronic circuitry in the 
Figure 2-2: More pixels mean sharper images.

32
Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
outperforming dSLR. For example, I have a 12MP pro dSLR that consistently 
produces better results than a 14MP entry-level model from another vendor, 
particularly under lower light levels. The raw number of megapixels gives 
you only a guideline, even though the more pixels, quite often the better your 
images look.
Deciding how many pixels your camera needs
People contemplating the purchase of a digital SLR often agonize over how 
many megapixels they should buy, even though you may find other factors 
(such as ease of operation and the kind and quality of lenses available for a 
particular dSLR) considerably more important in the long run. To a certain 
extent, vendors have (at least temporarily) alleviated this agony. In the past 
year or two, a surprising number of vendors have settled on 12MP as a basic 
benchmark number.
Nikon, for example, has three 12MP digital SLR cameras — a basic entry-level 
model, an intermediate amateur camera, and a feature-packed advanced 
model that both serious amateurs and professionals love. Canon, too, has 
introduced several 12MP models, and other vendors have followed. Of 
course, for most applications, you don’t really need more resolution. But, 
with competitive pressures being what they are, I don’t know just how long 
the 12MP plateau will remain the standard. (I urge those of you reading this 
in 2012 with your $499 21MP cameras to refrain from laughing.)
 
Although more pixels usually equal more resolution and more detail in your 
pictures, the number of pixels you actually need depends on several factors:
 
✓ How you plan to use the photo: An image that you place on a Web site 
or display in presentations doesn’t need to have the same resolution as 
one that you use professionally — for example, as a product advertise-
ment or a magazine illustration.
 
✓ How much manipulating and cropping you plan to do: If you want 
to give your images quite a workout in Photoshop or you often crop 
small sections out of images to create new perspectives, you want all 
the spare pixels that you can muster because high-resolution images 
can withstand more extensive editing without losing quality than low-
resolution images can.
 
✓ How much you plan to enlarge the image: Many people view most of 
their images on a computer display or in 4-x-6-inch to 5-x-7-inch prints. 
Any dSLR has enough megapixels for those modest applications. If 
you’re looking to make blowups bigger than 8 x 10 inches (for example, 
to make posters or prints that you display on the wall), you need a 
plethora of pixels.

33
 Chapter 2: Safari Inside a dSLR
 
✓ The resolution of your printer: Most digital images are printed on 
inkjet or dye sublimation devices that have their own resolution speci-
fications, usually from 300 dpi (dots per inch) to 1440 dpi and beyond. 
Printers work best with images that more closely match their own 
ability to print detail.
If you primarily want to create prints, the following section can help you 
gauge which capabilities you need in your camera and printer so that you 
can get the best output possible.
Matching pixels to print sizes and printers
If nice-looking prints are important to you, you need to pay as much attention 
to your printer as the number of pixels in your digital SLR. In truth, printers 
that have low resolution don’t benefit much from digital shots that have high 
megapixel counts. Those printers might produce worse results because they 
have to discard a lot of that precious detail to squeeze the picture informa-
tion into their available output pixels. You need a printer that has a lot of 
resolution to do the best job printing a high-resolution photo.
 
Calculating the appropriate resolution for a particular printer/image size 
combination is easy. Just follow these simple steps:
 
1. Multiply the printer resolution by the desired width of your image.
 
 This calculation gives you the number of pixels that you need for an 
image that wide. For example, if I have a 300 dpi printer and want an 
8-x-10-inch print, 300 × 8 = 2,400 pixels.
 
2. Multiply the printer resolution by the desired height of your image.
 
 So, in my example, 300 × 10 = 3,000 pixels.
 
3. Multiply the width in pixels by the height.
 
 You get the number of pixels that you need. Keeping with my example, 
2,400 × 3,000 = 7,200,000.
 
4. Divide the total number of pixels by 1 million.
 
 This step calculates the number of megapixels that your camera needs 
to collect for the print.
 
 Technically, in my example, I end up with 7.2MP, but a ballpark figure 
of 6MP will do. (The 6MP camera can hold as many as 3,000 x 2,000 
pixels, which gives you a 6.67-x-10-inch print, so you can reasonably 
assume that a 6MP image is just about ideal for a print in the 8-x-10-inch 
neighborhood.)

Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
Using an image of the same resolution as in the preceding list (2,400 x 3,000 
pixels), you can print in other sizes, of course, but your printer or the soft-
ware that drives it must drop or add pixels by using a process called interpo-
lation, or resampling, which applies intricate computer calculations to come 
up with a reasonably good-looking representation of your original image at a 
different size:
 
✓ Adding pixels (or upsampling): 
Figure 2-3 shows a highly simpli-
fied example of how new pixels 
are calculated from existing 
pixels during interpolation. In 
this case, upsampling is taking 
place; the two original pixels, 
one black and one white, are 
used to interpolate intermedi-
ate gray pixels. In sophisticated 
interpolation schemes, the 
density values of pixels in the 
rows above and below the 
original pixels, as well as the 
actual colors of the pixels are 
also taken into account.
 
✓ Dropping pixels (or downsampling): Downsampling is basically the 
same process as upsampling, but in reverse. Based on calculations by 
the software, some pixels are deleted to create the smaller image size.
Table 2-1 shows the nominal print sizes without the need for interpolation, 
for various camera resolutions at three different common print resolutions.

 Chapter 2: Safari Inside a dSLR
 
These native print sizes represent only the dimensions that you can get without 
using interpolation. In practice, digital SLR cameras can produce much larger 
prints that have very little noticeable loss of quality. A 6MP-to-8MP camera 
should give you 11-x-14- to 16-x-20-inch prints that look great; a 12MP-to-16MP 
camera should create good-quality 20-x-30-inch enlargements and beyond.
Nothing’s super about superfluous pixels
If you think you can never be too rich, too thin, or have too many megapix-
els, think again. Megapixels have a dark side, too, Luke. Unnecessary pixels 
lead to bigger image files, usefulewhen you actually need all those pixels, but 
they’re a potential nuisance if you don’t. Few people have the problem of 
being able to afford a camera that has a resolution significantly higher than 
they really need, but if you’re in that elite class, consider these caveats:
 
✓ Excess megapixels eat up your memory cards. All dSLRs store images on 
solid-state memory cards. I own three cards for my 10MP camera, each of 
which can store about 272 pictures in the best high-resolution shooting 
mode. Most of the time, I have plenty of digital film for any day’s shooting, 
and I can always drop to a lower resolution mode to stretch my memory 
cards further. However, if I used the same vendor’s top-of-the-line 24.5MP 
dSLR, each of those cards could hold only 85 images at the top quality set-
ting. I’d have to own a lot more memory cards to do the same work!
 
✓ Extra resolution taxes your computer. Fat photo files take a long time to 
transfer to your computer, and your image editor needs fast processing 
speeds and a lot of memory to manipulate those files. That high-end digital 
camera that you’re lusting after might call for a high-end computer, too.
 
✓ More pixels need more storage. Very high-resolution files can be sev-
eral times larger than your run-of-the-mill high-resolution image files. If 
you want to keep a lot of these files available on your hard drive, you 
need a large disk — and probably a lot of extra CDs, DVDs, or external 
hard drives to which you can archive them for permanent storage.
Touring through a Digital SLR
In the following sections, you can explore the innards of your digital SLR so that 
you can better understand how to use all the nifty features your digital shooter 
includes. At best, these sections give you a better handle on why, sometimes, 
the results you get when you press the shutter release aren’t exactly what you 
expect. At worst, you can find more convincing excuses to give when you goof.
In some ways, the basics of a dSLR have a lot in common with the conven-
tional film SLR, or indeed, any film camera. All these picture-grabbers share

Figure 2-4: The components of a digital SLR.
 
✓ A lens: Consisting of one or more optical components made of glass, 
plastic, or ceramic; captures light and gathers it to a point of focus 
inside the camera.
 
✓ A viewing system (including flip-up mirror): Lets you see what the 
camera sees so that you can compose your image and perform other 
functions, such as evaluating depth-of-field.
 
✓ An aperture: An opening inside the lens that you can (usually) adjust in 
size so that more or less light is able to sneak through into the camera.
 
✓ A shutter or other mechanism: Controls how long the light passing 
through the lens can expose the film or sensor.
 
✓ A light-sensitive component: Either film or — with digital cameras — 
the sensor, which captures the illumination admitted through the lens 
by the aperture for the time duration allowed by the shutter.
 
✓ A medium for storing the captured image: The camera needs a way to 
store the image until you remove it from the camera. With a film camera, 
that medium is the film itself. For a digital camera, the storage is a solid-
state film card.

37
 Chapter 2: Safari Inside a dSLR
Some of these components, especially lenses, are very similar for film and 
digital cameras. Indeed, many digital SLRs can use the same lenses built for 
their film counterparts. So, in the guided tour of the dSLR in the following 
sections, I concentrate on the pieces and parts that film and digital cameras 
don’t have in common.
Sensorship
After a night on the town, you might find in the morning that you’re extra 
sensitive to light. Well, a digital SLR’s sensor is like that all the time. When 
exposed to an incoming stream of light-bits (photons), a solid-state sensor 
scoops those light-bits up into little buckets, with one bucket for each pixel.
If each bucket, or photosite, collects 
enough photons to partially fill it to 
an imaginary line (or threshold) — 
which appears as a line on the side 
of the bucket in Figure 2-5 — that 
pixel registers something other than 
black. While more and more photons 
accumulate, the pixel’s value gets 
lighter and lighter until, when the 
bucket is full, the image processing 
software deems the pixel completely 
white. The intermediate tones regis-
ter as grays or, in color pictures, as 
darker or lighter shades of a particu-
lar color.
If too many photons are dumped into 
the bucket, no further tonal changes 
happen to that pixel, but the excess 
light-bits can actually overflow to 
adjoining pixels, causing an unpleas-
ant flaring effect called blooming. 
After the camera completes the expo-
sure, the bucket full of sloshing pho-
tons converts to ice cubes. Well, not 
actually, but it might help to think 
of the process of analog (water) to 
digital (ice cubes) conversion that 
way. Your computer’s bits and bytes 
can handle a discrete number of ice 
cubes (expressed in 1s and 0s) a lot 
more easily than it can work with an 
amorphous quantity of H20.
Figure 2-5: A photosite is like a bucket that 
collects photons.

38
Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
The camera processes the bits and then transfers them to a memory card, 
making your camera ready to take another picture. This entire process can 
happen in 1/2 to 1/8 of a second or less (which explains why digital SLRs can 
take two to ten or more pictures per second).
Two (count ’em), two types of sensors
Two main types of sensors are used in digital SLRs today: CCD (charge 
coupled device) and CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) 
imagers. Although each type of sensor uses different technology to capture 
images, they don’t have any inherent quality difference. Some vendors, 
including Sony, Pentax/Samsung, and Nikon, make great dSLRs based on CCD 
technology. But Nikon and other vendors also offer dSLRs built around CMOS 
sensors, particularly for their higher-resolution models. Canon has long been 
exclusively in the CMOS camp. Although the Foveon sensor used in Sigma 
cameras is, in fact, a CMOS imager, it’s a special type of CMOS sensor.
Both CCD and CMOS imagers use metal-oxide semiconductors (although, 
apparently, the CMOS type is more complementary), and they have about the 
same degree of sensitivity to light. The main difference is in what each type 
of sensor does with the light after capturing it:
 
✓ The CCD sensor is dumb. It simply captures photons as electrical 
charges in each photosite/pixel. After exposure, the charges are swept 
off the chip to an amplifier located in one corner of the sensor. External 
circuitry converts the analog signal to digital form and handles storing it 
on your memory card.
 
✓ A CMOS sensor, theoretically, is a lot more complicated than its CCD 
counterpart. It includes solid-state circuitry at each and every photosite 
and can manipulate the data for each pixel right in the sensor. That’s 
pretty cool because it gives the CMOS sensor the ability to respond to 
lighting conditions in ways that a CCD can’t. Sweeping all the photon 
information off a CMOS chip isn’t necessary; every photosite can be 
accessed individually.
Piling on the components
You get some interesting components piled on top of both sensor types. 
These components include
 
✓ Color filters: Give the color-blind CCD and CMOS chips the ability to 
respond to various colors of light.
 
✓ Teensy microlenses: Focus the incoming light onto the photosensitive 
area in each photo site. These components are especially important 
when you use wide-angle lenses because the photons may approach the 
sensor from too sharp an angle for the photosites to capture them prop-
erly. Although film is flat and can grab light from virtually any angle, 

39
 Chapter 2: Safari Inside a dSLR
digital sensors have a pitted surface that captures photons best when 
these minuscule lenses steer those photons toward the photosites.
 
✓ A protective transparent layer: Contains a special filter (an anti-aliasing 
filter) that smoothes out the incoming light signal by eliminating certain 
frequencies of light before they can clash with each other. This layer 
also includes an infrared cutoff filter that removes most of the infrared 
(IR) light component from the illumination that reaches the sensor (so-
called IR contamination can affect image quality and produce off-color 
colors). Some also include an antistatic, dust-repelling layer.
 
✓ A sensor-moving mechanism: Rattles the sensor to shake off dust 
when it accumulates on the protective layer. Some dSLRs, from vendors 
other than Canon and Nikon, also include a more sophisticated sensor 
adjustment feature that shifts the position of the sensor in response to 
camera shake, canceling out vibration and providing image stabilization. 
Canon and Nikon build this same sort of anti-shake feature into specific 
lenses, rather than into the camera body (which Sony, Pentax, Olympus, 
Samsung, and others do).
The average photographer probably finds the color filter layer of most inter-
est because these filters make color photography possible. The sensors in 
dSLRs do a fairly good job of registering the brightness in a scene. However, 
these pixel grabbers are totally colorblind on their own.
So, a tiny color filter overlays each individual photosite, as shown in Figure 2-6, 
that renders it sensitive only to a single primary color of light — red, green, or 
blue. These colors can combine to produce all the intermediate hues, such 
as yellow (red + green), cyan (green + blue), or magenta (blue + red). All three 
colors (red, green, and blue) added together produce white. Your TV set and 
computer display use the same color system to show colors, and any image 
editor can manipulate them, which a digital photographer can find highly 
convenient.
The (now) color-sensitive pixels are arranged in a matrix of alternate rows 
of red-green-red-green-red-green photosites and blue-green-blue-green-blue-
green photosites. Green gets twice as many pixels as each of the other two 
colors because of the way our eyes perceive color. (Humans are most sensi-
tive to green light.) This arrangement is called a Bayer pattern (see Figure 
2-7), after Dr. Bryce Bayer, the Kodak scientist who developed the process.
As you might guess, a green, red, or blue pixel might not be lucky enough to 
receive light that’s colored its designated hue. So, the camera takes all the 
information and uses the color of surrounding pixels to calculate (or interpo-
late — that word again!) the most likely true color of a particular picture ele-
ment. With at least six million pixels to work with, this interpolation (called 
demosaicing, for any of you terminology nerds) generally provides a pretty 
good representation of the actual colors in a scene.

Figure 2-6: The parts of a sensor.
An exception to this scheme is the 
Foveon sensor that I mention in the 
preceding section. Sigma dSLRs use 
this sensor, and it employs a special 
kind of CMOS imager that doesn’t 
use the Bayer filter pattern at all. 
Instead, it has three separate photo-
sensitive layers, one each for blue, green, and red (stacked in that order, 
from top to bottom). During exposure, each pixel absorbs the blue light first 
(if present), then green, and finally red while the photons work their way 
through the layers. The camera doesn’t need to do any interpolation, and 
each and every pixel can detect each color of light. Although Foveon technol-
ogy sounds pretty cool (and it is!), the company still need to work out some 
kinks — the sensor hasn’t seen wide use to date.
Understanding noise and sensitivity
Imagine that you’re driving along in your convertible with the top down, 
wind whistling in your ears, and the satellite radio playing some cool tunes. 
This situation is pretty great, but it would be even better if you could hear 
the sounds coming from the radio. So, you crank up the volume — but you 
really can’t hear the music much better. Welcome to the wonderful world of 
background noise. Unfortunately, digital photography has its own equivalent 
background noise.
In the digital camera realm, visual noise is what you get when you crank up 
the sensitivity of a sensor so that it can capture the sparse population of 
photons that exist under dim lighting conditions. This sensitivity is measured 
Figure 2-7: Part of a Bayer filter array.

41
 Chapter 2: Safari Inside a dSLR
in ISO settings, with ISO 800 being twice as sensitive as ISO 400, and ISO 400 
having double the sensitivity of ISO 200.
When you amplify the signal created by actual photons striking the sensor, you 
also multiply the noise produced by random electrical charges generated in the 
sensor. At low ISO settings, the sensor simply waits until it captures a certain level 
of photons, and that number overpowers the small number of random noise pixels.
 
In a digital camera, noise is worse at high ISO settings, at long exposures 
(because long exposures provide more time for random pixels to be gener-
ated on their own), and if the camera has small pixels. I rhapsodize in Chapter 1 
about how brilliantly digital SLRs can ignore noise, chiefly because of their 
large pixels — but remember that any digital camera is subject to this curse 
when you raise the ISO enough or take pictures with a long-enough exposure.
 
Digital cameras can remove much of the noise caused by long exposures by 
taking a second, blank frame after exposing the first picture, and then com-
paring the two. The camera can see which pixels appear in both versions and 
remove those pixels that appear to be noise. Figure 2-8 shows a long expo-
sure plagued with noise (left) and another photo in which the noise has been 
silenced with the dSLR’s noise-reduction feature (right).
You can find more about noise reduction in Chapter 11.
 
 
Figure 2-8: Too much noise (left) and a much quieter photo (right).

Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
The bits that control exposure
You need to understand the controls that adjust the exposure. What’s exposure, 
you ask? A picture’s exposure is nothing more than the amount of photons 
available for capture by the sensor. A good exposure requires that the sensor 
capture exactly the right number of photons. Too few photons, and the image 
doesn’t register at all. Too many photons, and the photo is overexposed.
 
As you might guess, if a lot of light is bouncing around a scene, a large 
number of photons can illuminate the sensor in a very brief time. If the 
light is dim, you might have to wait longer for enough photons to reach the 
sensor. The important detail to remember is that for any given scene, an 
ideal exposure exists — one that provides just the right number of photons 
to capture the image.
Your digital SLR’s exposure system is designed to improve your chances of 
getting that ideal exposure, either by adjusting the length of time the sensor 
is allowed to suck up photons or by modifying the number of photons that 
reach the sensor in any particular instant. You make these adjustments by 
using the camera’s shutter speed and lens opening/aperture controls, which I 
describe in the following sections.
Your exposure time machine
Of course, in a digital SLR, the sensor isn’t exposed to incoming light all the 
time. Instead, it sees photons for a brief interval, dubbed the exposure time, 
usually measured in fractions of a second. The exposure time can extend for 
many seconds in the case of a time exposure.
The gatekeeper that controls these time slices, a sort of exposure-time machine, 
is the shutter. The shutter can be a mechanical device (usually a curtain in 
front of the sensor that opens and closes very quickly) or an electronic mecha-
nism that activates the sensor for a specific instant of time. Digital SLRs might 
have both, using a mechanical shutter for exposures measured in seconds 
from about 1/180 to 1/500 of a second and an electronic shutter for exposures in 
the 1/500 to 1/8,000 of a second range.
 
Longer shutter speeds let in more light but can produce blurring if the sub-
ject or camera moves during the exposure. Shorter shutter speeds cut down 
the amount of light admitted, but they also reduce the chance that movement 
causes blurriness.
An aperture is a lens opening is an f-stop
You can control photons by using the lens aperture (or the f-stop). The aper-
ture is the size of the opening through which the photons pass. You can think 

43
 Chapter 2: Safari Inside a dSLR
of an f-stop as a pipe: Larger pipes let 
more light flow in a given period of 
time, and smaller pipes restrict the 
amount of light that can pass. The 
aperture is a clever little adjustable 
mechanism that uses a sliding set of 
overlapping metal leaves to create an 
opening of the desired size, as shown 
in Figure 2-9.
To get the right amount of light for 
an exposure, you need to choose 
the right f-stop. To choose the right 
f-stop, you need to understand three 
confusing facts about f-stops:
 
✓ F-stops seem to be named 
wrong. That is, f/2 is larger than 
f/4, which is larger than f/8. 
When the numbers get larger, 
the amount of light an aperture can admit gets smaller.
 
✓ F-stops don’t seem to be properly proportioned. An f/2 opening lets in 
four times as much light as f/4, and f/4 admits four times as much as f/8. 
You’d think numbers like two, four, and eight would represent double 
(or half) as much — not four times.
 
✓ F-stops use all these weird intermediate numbers that do represent 
halving and doubling the amount of light passed by the aperture. For 
example, between f/2 and f/4 is f/2.8, which is exactly twice as large as 
f/4 and half the size of f/2. The actual sequence of f-stops, each half the 
size of the previous aperture, is
 
 f/2, f/2.8, f/4, f/5.6, f/8, f/11, f/16, f/22, f/32
 
 What’s going on here? Everything becomes clear when you realize that 
f-numbers are actually denominators of fractions that represent the size 
of the aperture opening, just as 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, or 1/16 represent ever-smaller 
quantities. So, f/11 allows your camera’s sensor to collect more light 
than f/16 because 1/11 is a bigger number than 1/16.
Two of one, half a dozen of the other
As far as the camera is concerned, f-stops and shutter speeds are equivalent. 
Cutting the shutter speed in half produces the same effect on exposure as 
using an f-stop that cuts the size of the lens opening in half. You get the same 
Figure 2-9: Overlapping metal leaves create 
various-sized lens openings.

44
Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
image if you take two pictures, one that has the exposure twice as long and 
the other by using an f-stop that’s twice as large.
So, if your camera’s exposure system suggests an exposure of 1/500 of a second 
at f/8, you could reduce the exposure to 1/1,000 of a second (half as long) at f/8, 
or get the exact same exposure at 1/500 of a second at f/11 (with the aperture 
half as wide).
Similarly, various combinations of f-stops and shutter speeds can produce 
the same exposure value. An exposure of 1/500 of a second at f/8 is the same as 
1/1,000 of a second at f/5.6 (halving the shutter speed, but doubling the size of 
the lens opening), whereas 1/250 of a second at f/11 (twice the shutter speed, 
but half the size of the lens opening) is the same, too. Although these recip-
rocal relationships might be confusing at first, they seem natural after a few 
weeks using a camera.
Taking time out for viewing
Strictly speaking, your camera’s viewfinder isn’t part of the exposure pro-
cess. It does have an important role, however, because the dSLR’s viewing 
system is one of the reasons (along with lens interchangeability) why people 
lust after these cameras in the first place.
Non-SLR digital cameras generally use an LCD on the back panel to provide a 
real-time image of what the sensor is seeing. This LCD view is often (but not 
always) coupled with an optical viewfinder window that you can also use to 
frame the image. That’s particularly handy under bright lighting conditions 
when the back-panel LCD is washed out. Some cameras, called EVF (elec-
tronic viewfinder) models (which might physically resemble dSLRs, even 
though you can’t change their lenses), have a second LCD inside, which you 
can view through a window. This EVF is easier to see in bright light.
With digital SLR cameras, the default viewing mechanism is through an opti-
cal viewfinder that uses the same lens that takes the picture (rather than a 
separate viewing window). The lens admits light, and a system of mirrors or 
prisms bounce that light to a viewfinder window, making it possible for you 
to see exactly what the sensor sees. When you’re ready to take the picture, 
the mirror in a typical dSLR swings out of the way, blanking the viewfinder 
for a fraction of a second while the light is directed to the sensor to make the 
exposure.
Compared to the tiny LCD or optical view offered by non-SLRs, you can more 
easily use the big, bright optical display of a dSLR to compose, evaluate focus, 
and judge how much of the image is actually sharp, as shown in Figure 2-10.

45
 Chapter 2: Safari Inside a dSLR
 
 
 Figure 2-10: Digital SLR optical viewfinders show a lot of information, along with the big, bright 
view of your subject.
As I mention in Chapter 1, the most popular dSLRs (and, you can expect, all 
models introduced in the future) have an additional feature called Live View, 
which allows the camera to display the actual image that the lens sees on the 
back-panel color LCD before exposure. Here are the key considerations of 
Live View:
 
✓ What you see may be what you get — mostly. Live View does show 
you the image that the sensor captures, with a couple caveats. The 
display may not show 100 percent of the image that the camera will cap-
ture (but that fact is usually true of a dSLR’s optical viewfinder, which 
typically shows 90 to 95 percent of the frame). Moreover, the camera 
usually increases or reduces the LCD image’s brightness for easiest 
viewing under a variety of ambient lighting conditions. So, Live View 
may not provide a true indicator of whether your exposure is correct. 
Some dSLRs have an exposure preview mode that brightens or darkens 

46
Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
the image while the exposure that you set or the camera sets changes, 
giving you valuable feedback. (If you don’t have this feature, you can 
still judge exposure by viewing the image’s histogram, as described in 
Chapter 5.)
 
✓ One or more focus systems. In normal, non–Live View mode, your 
dSLR’s autofocus system uses a special sensor in the optical viewfinder 
to achieve automatic focus by using a process called phase detection, 
which works very much like the rangefinders used in surveying and 
rangefinder-type cameras (natch), to line up vertical and/or horizontal 
lines. When using Live View, the mirror is flipped up, so the camera 
can’t do phase detection. Therefore, cameras that have Live View focus 
either by evaluating the relative sharpness of the sensor image (this 
is called contrast detection) or by quickly flipping up the mirror for an 
instant prior to exposure so that the normal phase detection system can 
operate. (Or by using both methods, at your option.)
 
✓ Cluttered screen. Unlike the optical viewfinder display, in which most 
information appears below the picture array, most Live View previews have 
much of the data overlaid on the picture area. (See Figure 2-11.) However, 
you can usually specify how much information you want the camera to pro-
vide, so you can trade off less data for a cleaner-looking LCD screen.
Figure 2-11: Live View preview screens sometimes seem cluttered.
 
✓ Tripod mounting works best. Live View is great for contemplative pho-
tography, particularly close-ups or landscape shots, when you want 
to carefully compose the image on the LCD. You probably want to use 
a tripod because a secure mount keeps your camera steady while you 
lock in your composition, and it also simplifies the autofocus process. In 
fact, some vendors call their two Live View autofocus modes Hand-Held 
Mode and Tripod Mode.

47
 Chapter 2: Safari Inside a dSLR
Through the looking glass
All cameras form their images by grabbing light through a lens, a series of 
precision-made elements of glass, plastic, or ceramic. The components are 
arranged to gather the light and focus it onto the film or sensor at a certain 
distance, called the focal length. Fixed-focal-length lenses, or prime lenses, 
always produce the same magnification. Other lenses have elements that can 
shift around in particular ways to change the magnification over a certain 
range. These lenses are called zoom lenses. One of the coolest things about 
dSLRs is that you can remove a particular lens and replace it with one that 
provides a different zoom range or has other useful capabilities, such as the 
ability to focus extra close.
Inside the lens is a diaphragm that can dilate or contract, much like the iris of 
the eye, to change the size of the aperture. These f-stops not only control the 
amount of light reaching the sensor, but affect the amount of an image that’s 
in focus. Small f-stops provide large areas of focus (called depth-of-field), and 
large f-stops offer a small, sharp focus range.
The distance of the lens elements from the sensor also controls the overall 
focus of the picture. You can adjust focus manually by twisting a ring on the 
barrel of the lens itself or automatically by using tiny motors inside the lens. 
Some lenses have additional motors that move the elements in response to 
camera shake or movement, producing a useful vibration-reduction or image-
stabilization effect. I explain more special lens features in Chapter 3.
Storage
The very first electronic cameras of 30 years ago stored images on tape 
recorders! Fifteen years later, the $30,000 digital cameras that a few daring 
professional photographers used stored their photos on a bulky hard drive 
that had to be tethered to the camera by a cable. Today, you’re much better 
off than those digital-camera pioneers because you can use tiny solid-state 
devices called flash memory to store your photos until you can transfer 
them to a computer for permanent archiving. A dSLR’s storage has two 
components:
 
✓ The buffer: Your digital SLR takes the bits siphoned out of the sensor 
and conducts them to a special high-speed type of internal memory 
called a buffer. Thanks to the buffer, you can continue taking photos 
while the camera deals with transferring the most recent pictures to the 
film card.
 
 The size and speed of the buffer determines how many pictures you can 
take in a row. Digital cameras generally let you take 5 to 30 shots con-
secutively, and have continuous shot (burst) modes good for 2.5 to 10 
frames per second for as long as the buffer holds out. A fast, large buffer 
is better.

48
Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
 
✓ Memory card: Memory cards have their own writing speed, which deter-
mines how quickly the card can accept images from the buffer. No one 
has created a standard measurement for this speed, so you can find 
memory cards labeled 40X, 80X, 120X, 133X, 333X, up to 666X (which is 
close to the theoretical limit in speed), as well as with descriptive terms 
such as Ultra or Extreme.
 
Most of the time, however, card speed limits your shooting only if you’re 
photographing sports and want to take many pictures in a row. The rest of 
the time, your dSLR is probably a lot faster than your trigger finger.
Digital SLRs today generally use either CompactFlash (CF) or Secure Digital/
Secure Digital High Capacity (SD/SDHC) memory cards, as shown in Figure 
2-12. They’re mostly equivalent in speed, cost, and capacity, although SD cards 
are smaller than their CF counterparts. You can also find miniature hard disk 
drives with the CompactFlash form factor, xD cards, or (with an adapter) 
Sony Memory Stick Pro Duo cards — although manufacturers have generally 
phased these out, and cameras that use them have become rather rare.
 
 
Figure 2-12: Memory cards come in a variety of capacities.
In recent months, the cost of flash memory has plummeted, which digital-
camera users can benefit from because the reduction in cost came at the 
same time that the basic resolution specifications for digital SLRs increased 

49
 Chapter 2: Safari Inside a dSLR
from 6MP to 12MP and beyond. More megapixels bring a need for large-
capacity memory cards. Today, you can purchase an 8GB CompactFlash card 
for about half what a 4GB card cost a year or more ago, even if you purchase 
one of the upscale, speedy models that has faster write speeds.
 
If your dSLR uses Secure Digital (SD) memory, check out any cards that 
have capacities of 2GB or larger to make sure that they’re compatible with 
your camera and your memory card readers. Some older cameras and other 
devices don’t accept 2GB or larger cards at all. To alleviate the problem, a 
new format, SDHC (Secure Digital High Capacity) has been developed for 
capacities of 4GB to 32GB, but SDHC works only with products that are 
explicitly SDHC compatible. All recent dSLRs that use SD-type memory 
include support for the newer SDHC type of memory.
Overcoming Quirks of the dSLR
If you’re entering the digital SLR world from the realms of film cameras or 
non-SLR digital photography, you may note some significant differences 
between dSLRs and other cameras, which can only be called quirks. They’re 
idiosyncrasies of the dSLR that you must compensate for or grudgingly put 
up with. Some might even drive you crazy. The following sections offer some 
advice for contending with these quirks.
Out, out damned spot: Cleaning the sensor
Every time you remove your dSLR’s lens to replace it with another, you 
could be admitting tiny specks of dust that might, if you’re unlucky, find their 
way past the shutter when it opens for an exposure, and thence get onto 
the sensor. You might make it a few weeks or a few months, but eventually, 
you end up with artifacts on your sensor. Shockingly, the automatic sensor 
cleaning mechanisms built into virtually all common digital SLRs do a pretty 
good job of shaking off the dust, but few of them are always 100-percent effec-
tive. So, even with automatic cleaning, you can still end up with dust on your 
sensor.
You might not even notice this dust because it’s most apparent when you use 
small f-stops that produce the largest range of sharp focus. (I explain why in 
the section “The bits that control exposure,” earlier in this chapter.) If you 
take most of your pictures at f/8, f/5.6, or larger, any dust on your sensor 
might appear blurry and almost invisible in your photographs. In addition, if 
the dark dust spots happen to fall into dark areas of your image, the darkness 
masks them.

50
Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
 
So, if you own a digital SLR, you can plan on the need to clean your sensor 
manually from time to time. You may have to clean your sensor only once 
or twice a year (with your camera’s sensor shaker taking care of the job most 
of the time). Manual cleaning isn’t particularly difficult, and you can find 
cleaning kits available at camera stores and online. Some tips to remember 
include
 
✓ Point your camera downward when you change lenses so that you 
reduce the amount of dust that infiltrates.
 
✓ If possible, change lenses only in relatively clean environments.
 
 Don’t attempt to clean your sensor with canned air, compressed air 
blowers, lens-cleaning liquids, or other methods that seem to make 
sense but which can damage your sensor. Use only bulb blowers and 
swabs intended expressly for sensor cleaning.
 
✓ If you have any doubts about your ability to clean your sensor yourself, 
let your local camera shop or the manufacturer do it.
Multiplication fables: Working around the crop factor
As I mention in the section “Sensorship,” earlier in this chapter, many digital 
SLR cameras use a sensor that’s smaller than a 35mm film frame, even though 
they typically use lenses that were originally designed for full-frame cameras. 
The smaller sensor, in effect, crops out part of the image, so you’re using 
only about 75 percent of the area produced, as shown in Figure 2-13. For 
example, when you use a 100mm lens, a small sensor images only the center 
area, capturing an image that has the same field of view as a 150mm lens.
This effect is sometimes called, inaccurately, a multiplication factor or lens 
multiplier because you can represent the equivalent field of view by multi-
plying the focal length of the lens by the factor. In truth, no multiplication 
is involved. A 100mm f/2.8 lens that you use on a camera that has a 1.5 mul-
tiplier is still a 100mm f/2.8 lens and provides the exact same image. The 
camera just crops the image to a smaller rectangle. The correct terminology 
is crop factor. Common crop factors in today’s dSLRs are 1.3X, 1.5X, 1.6X, 
and 2X. A camera that provides a full-frame image, with no cropping at all, is 
sometimes said to have a 1X crop factor.
The crop factor affects your picture-taking in two ways:
 
✓ Your telephoto lenses seem to be magically converted to much longer 
focal lengths. A 200mm telephoto lens becomes a 300mm telephoto 
lens; a 400mm-long lens is transformed into a 600mm super telephoto 
lens. Of course, you get identical results by taking the same picture with 

51
 Chapter 2: Safari Inside a dSLR
a full-frame camera and cropping the image, but it’s a convenient fable, 
even so.
 
✓ The view of wide-angle lenses is cropped so that they no longer take 
in as much of your surroundings as they would on a full-frame camera. 
A nice, super-wide 20mm lens on a camera that has a 1.6X crop factor 
has the same field of view as an ordinary 32mm wide-angle lens. A useful 
35mm wide-angle lens view, such as the one shown in the upper-left in 
Figure 2-13, becomes the mundane 56mm normal lens perspective, as 
shown at lower-right. The crop factor means that, to get a true wide-angle 
view, you have to purchase expensive, ridiculously wide lenses, such as 
the popular 12mm-to-24mm lenses offered by Nikon, Sigma, and Tokina.
 
 
 Figure 2-13: A wide-angle shot (upper-left) loses its wide perspective because of the typical 
1.5X crop factor (lower-right).

52
Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
Most of the affordable digital SLRs (up to the $1,500 price level) use small 
sensors that provide this crop factor. Nikon, Sony, and Pentax offer entry-
level and intermediate cameras that have a 1.5X crop factor. Canon’s non-pro 
offerings all use a 1.6X crop factor, and Olympus and Panasonic lead the way 
among the Micro Four Thirds troops with 2X crop factor.
However, so-called full-frame, or 1X-crop-factor cameras, have become more 
affordable in recent years. Although Nikon and Canon still ask megabucks 
for their full-frame pro cameras, several 1X cameras from Nikon, Canon, and 
Sony are each priced in the $2,000 to $3,000 range, with resolutions ranging 
from 12MP up to 25MP. Of course, full-frame cameras require lenses made 
specifically for the large sensors. I discuss this factor in detail in Chapter 6.

Tracking the Ideal dSLR
In This Chapter
▶ Factoring in future features and your future needs
▶ Looking at camera types and your photography requirements
▶ Choosing among key features
W
hen you upgrade from your first digital camera to a digital SLR, the 
stakes increase dramatically. A dSLR generally costs quite a bit more 
than the average point-and-shoot digital camera, so you want to make the 
right purchase the first time. You also want to buy into a camera product line 
that has all the accessories you may want to buy in the future. Owning a very 
cool digital single lens reflex camera is little comfort if you can’t find that 
special external electronic flash that you need or an underwater housing that 
you absolutely must have.
The high stakes extend into the future, too. The dSLR that 
you buy now will grow when you add lenses and other 
accessories, and you want to be able to use those 
same add-ons with whatever camera eventually 
replaces your current pride and joy. SLR camera 
buyers have known for years that you can easily get 
locked into a particular camera system, so select-
ing the right camera today is a little like choosing 
a spouse. If the photographic marriage doesn’t 
last forever, starting over with a new mate can be 
expensive and full of heartache.
This chapter helps you choose your ideal dSLR now to 
ensure your future happiness.
Features for Now and the Future
Some have said that once, in the 1950s, a world-famous photographer was 
preparing to shoot a portrait of an important business executive. The 

54
Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
captain of industry watched him set up and made conversation by observ-
ing proudly, “I see you use a Leica. So do I.” Cracking a faint smile, the famed 
lensman replied, “I see your secretary uses a Royal typewriter. So does 
Hemingway.”
The best camera in the world can produce mediocre pictures in the hands 
of a clumsy photographer. Conversely, a creative mind can produce stun-
ning images when armed with the simplest of cameras. Figure 3-1 is far from 
a stunning photograph, but I took it with a $200 point-and-shoot camera and 
a pair of $10 high-intensity desk lamps for illumination. I didn’t use any fancy 
close-up or macro lenses. You don’t need an expensive camera to take good 
pictures.
 
 
 Figure 3-1: A $200 camera took this photo; you don’t need an expensive camera for creative 
photography.
 
Of course, you don’t have to tie one hand behind your back to make sure 
that you concentrate on composition and capture the decisive moment. So, 
consider the full range of available features when choosing your camera, rec-
ognizing that you might not be able to justify them all right now. Divide the 
features you’re considering into these three categories:

55
 Chapter 3: Tracking the Ideal dSLR
 
✓ Features you need: These are the capabilities you really must have for 
the kind of photography that you do. Perhaps you shoot in low light 
levels and require a fast lens that lets you grab images without flash. 
Or you specialize in sports photography and must have a dSLR with 
a 3-to-4-frames-per-second (fps) shooting rate or better. If you plan to 
shoot a lot of time-lapse photography, you probably want a camera that 
can take pictures while powered by AC current and tethered to a laptop 
computer. Make a list of your must-have features and keep them in mind 
when searching for your ideal camera.
 
✓ Features you want: These features aren’t absolutely essential for the major-
ity of your photography, but they might come in handy or expand your 
picture-taking opportunities. You probably consider how much extra you 
have to pay to get these features. You might want to take wildlife photos 
without a tripod, so you want the availability of long lenses with built-
in image stabilization features. Still, if you can’t afford such a lens, you 
can probably get by almost as well with a good tripod (despite the extra 
weight to lug around). Your nice-to-have features aren’t deal-breakers, but 
they can tilt your preferences from one camera line to another.
 
✓ Features you want to get, but can’t (yet): A few capabilities are totally out 
of your reach either because they’re too expensive or not available for the 
camera models you’re considering. Deposit these features in the What Ifs 
category. These features just might filter down to you someday — perhaps 
more quickly than you think. Perhaps you want image stabilization built 
into the camera itself so that just about every lens you own gains anti-shake 
capabilities. If that’s what you want, you can find it in an increasing number 
of cameras, including Sony Alpha, Olympus, and Pentax models.
Breadcrumbs on the Upgrade Path
You may find the ability to upgrade your dSLR in the future tempting, like 
alluring breadcrumbs sprinkled on the path through the dark woods of the 
future. You can plan now to make sure these crumbs haven’t been gobbled 
up by the time you choose to add to your own dSLR system.
 
The following tips can help you choose a camera that has great upgrade 
potential:
 
✓ Look at how particular vendors have handled the evolution of their 
lens systems when they’ve added features. The Pentax line of dSLRs 
is capable of using KA and K mount lenses, older Pentax screw-mount 
lenses dating back decades, and even some lenses intended for medium-
format cameras if you have the proper adapter. The latest Nikon dSLRs 
(except for a few entry-level models, starting with the Nikon D40/D40x, 

56
Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
D60, and D5000) can use virtually any Nikkor lens dating back to 1959, 
although some lenses require slight modifications. (The D40/D40x/
D60/D5000 can autofocus only with lenses that have built-in focusing 
motors.) Of course, automatic metering and focusing aren’t possible in 
all cases for very old lenses built before these features were invented! 
Although all Canon EF-series lenses work fine with any EOS camera 
(film or digital), you can use the company’s EF-S-series lenses only on 
the latest consumer-oriented dSLR Canon models, such as the EOS 
20D/30D/40D/50D or later, and the Digital Rebel/Rebel line.
 
✓ Explore how well a vendor supports its older model cameras and flash 
units. Vendors are continually improving their dedicated electronic 
flash units. As a result, the latest speedlights might not be compatible 
with newer or future cameras. Some flashes might not function with full 
through-the-lens metering, but you can operate them in semi-automatic 
modes that have exposure-measuring cells built into the flash itself. You 
may not be able to use others in wireless mode without special adapt-
ers. For details on using electronic flash, see Chapter 9.
 
✓ Figure out which filter size fits the most lenses. Especially before 
making an investment in polarizers, infrared filters, and close-up lenses 
that can be fairly expensive. A film SLR that I worked with for many 
years used the same size filter on nearly all its lenses, so I could safely 
buy as many of these screw-on accessories as I wanted. I knew they 
wouldn’t become obsolete when I added a new lens. Today, vendors 
might offer lenses that use a bunch of different-size filters. You might 
own one lens that takes 62mm filters, another that calls for 67mm add-
ons, and a third that takes 72mm accessories. You might find that the 
clearest upgrade path is to buy the largest filters and then adapt them to 
other lenses by using step-down rings, as shown in Figure 3-2.
 
 
 Figure 3-2: You might be able to use one set of filters on 
several different lenses by using adapter rings.

 Chapter 3: Tracking the Ideal dSLR
Cameras of Today and Tomorrow
Only a few years ago, dSLR cameras came in only one category — expensive. 
You could expect to spend at least $5,000 for a digital SLR from Canon, Nikon, 
or Kodak, and be thankful that the camera was that affordable. After all, it 
wasn’t long ago that digital SLRs cost upwards of $30,000, used a tethered 
200MB hard drive, and gave you 1.3-megapixel photos!
Of course, dSLRs of the late 20th century were built on rugged professional 
camera bodies, and they housed very expensive sensors. The Kodak DCS 460 
of a decade ago was basically a common Nikon body with a very, very costly 
6MP imager built in. Although some digital SLRs that cost as little as $2,000 
(for the body alone) made an appearance, it wasn’t until the original Canon 
Digital Rebel was introduced in 2003 at less than $1,000 (with lens) that the 
new category of basic consumer dSLR was born.
Although the distinct camera categories that I cover in the following sections 
have some overlap, these categories are still aimed at particular classes of 
buyers.
Basic dSLR cameras
The basic dSLR is the newest type of digital camera that has interchangeable 
lenses. These cameras are stripped-down versions of more advanced digital 
SLRs, aimed specifically at photographers who are looking to step up from 
point-and-shoot models but don’t necessarily want full-fledged systems that 
include all the bells and whistles. Typical cameras in this class include the 
entry-level Nikon, Canon, Pentax/
Samsung, and Olympus. A typical 
compact basic dSLR is shown in 
Figure 3-3.
Priced at around $500 to $600 (with 
lens), basic dSLRs compete directly 
with the more expensive point-and-
shoot, non-dSLR cameras in the 
same price and megapixel range. The 
point-and-shoot cameras might have 
non-interchangeable zoom lenses 
that have a longer range (12:1 or more) 
while offering a smaller and lighter 
package that’s more portable.
Figure 3-3: Basic dSLR models boast very low 
price tags but a lot of useful features.

58
Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
I tend to avoid calling basic dSLRs entry-level models because that implies a 
tendency to move up and beyond the original dSLR to more advanced cam-
eras, lenses, and accessories. In practice, a surprising number of people who 
buy these cameras are perfectly happy with the capabilities they have and 
may stick with their new dSLRs for years. Many of them never buy another 
lens. They get great results with their basic dSLR and its kit lens, and they 
have no interest in upgrading. I think it’s terrific that vendors have recognized 
this important type of snapshooter and have provided affordable cameras 
with the features casual photographers need. Indeed, I was surprised to find 
that a very inexpensive Pentax model dSLR that I purchased had sophisticated 
weather sealing and advanced features that I would have expected in a much 
more costly camera.
 
The advantage of an entry-level dSLR over a comparably priced point-and-
shoot camera is usually faster operation and better image quality (even when 
matched in the megapixel department), plus the ability to exchange lenses. 
Those who never plan to buy additional lenses find the quality of the non-SLR 
adequate, and people who don’t shoot demanding subjects, such as sports, 
are happy with the point-and-shoot models, especially the models that offer 
a bit of manual control. Both groups prize the pocket size of point-and-shoot 
cameras and will actually pay more for an extra-tiny shooter. But more seri-
ous photographers take a basic dSLR at the same price every time.
Of course, these basic dSLR models do lack a few features that their more 
advanced brethren have — but, boy, are they affordable! You might be happy 
with one of these as your main camera or as a second camera body, particu-
larly if your budget is tight.
What do you give up? Most of the most basic dSLRs sacrifice a few features 
that you might never or rarely use. These include depth-of-field preview, 
shutter speeds faster than 1/4,000 of a second, or the speediest continuous 
shooting bursts. Some of the cost-saving measures add some inconvenience: 
Your basic dSLR might have only one command dial, so you need to press a 
button to switch between setting the shutter speed and aperture. Many skip 
the traditional top-panel monochrome LCD (liquid crystal display) status dis-
play and show all shooting information on the color LCD on the back of the 
camera. Or the budget model might use only tiny SD (Secure Digital) memory 
cards, rather than the larger (and more difficult to lose!) CompactFlash cards 
found in many upscale dSLRs.
Still, what you give up to save several hundred dollars might be insignificant 
if it means you can get behind the wheel of an honest-to-gosh dSLR today.
Enthusiast dSLRs
What I think of as enthusiast dSLRs are a step up from the most basic models 
and provide a true launching point for avid photographers who need to get into 

59
 Chapter 3: Tracking the Ideal dSLR
digital SLR shooting at minimal cost, but insist on plenty of opportunities for 
enhancing their capabilities later with new lenses, flash units, and accessories.
These dSLRs start at about $800 
(often including a basic zoom lens) 
and range to about $1,200. These 
models are available from Nikon, 
Canon (as shown in Figure 3-4), 
Pentax, Sony, and other vendors.
These cameras don’t sacrifice many 
features; the corners are cut in ways 
that probably don’t affect the typi-
cal photo enthusiast. For example, 
cameras in this class often are built 
around rugged polycarbonate bodies 
rather than the almost-indestructible 
magnesium camera bodies found in 
upscale cameras. The viewfinder 
systems might use pentamirrors that 
are a little dimmer than the 
pentaprisms found in pro cameras, and magnification through the view-
ing system might be lower. It’s common for these dSLRs to have much less 
sprightly continuous shooting modes, too.
For anyone who could never justify spending $1,800 or more on a dSLR, these 
models offer just about every needed feature with enough megapixels to pro-
duce very high-quality pictures, indeed. They form an excellent foundation 
for building an arsenal of lenses and other accessories that remain useful 
even when the photo enthusiast upgrades to a newer model in the future.
Advanced amateur/semi-pro dSLRs
The next step up from enthusiast dSLRs are the advanced amateur/semi-pro 
models, which are cameras intended for more-experienced, advanced con-
sumers/amateur photographers, but outfitted with enough features to make 
them attractive to professionals as a second camera body. Indeed, some pros 
who have light-duty shooting requirements (perhaps because their work is 
more contemplative and they don’t fire off thousands of shots a day) use 
them as primary cameras. In truth, of course, no hard-and-fast set of features 
makes a particular camera a pro camera. Professionals can get excellent 
photos from any model that they care to use.
Figure 3-4: True entry-level enthusiast dSLRs 
start at less than $1,000 and have a full set of 
features.

60
Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
These dSLRs start at about $1,200 (for the body only). These models are 
available from Canon, Nikon, Fujifilm, Sony, Olympus, and others.
 
Like entry-level enthusiast cameras, these cameras trim a few features to 
achieve their affordable cost and may use plastic bodies rather than the 
almost-indestructible magnesium camera bodies found in the pro cameras. 
They might lack built-in vertical camera grips and easy plug-in remote con-
trols that professionals require. They typically fire off fewer shots in burst 
mode, typically from 3 to 5 fps, whereas pro models usually have 8-to-11-fps 
capabilities.
Professional dSLR models
Although some models are priced in the $3,000 range, most professional 
dSLRs set you back a bit more — up to five to eight grand. (See Figure 3-5.) If 
you’re selling your work, the camera is well worth the cost. Cameras in this 
class include the Sony Alpha DSLR-A900; Nikon D700, D3, and D3x; Canon 
EOS-1D Mark III, EOS-1Ds Mark III, and EOS 5D Mark II. These models take you 
all the way from 12MP up to a lofty 
25MP (or beyond) and can, arguably, 
meet or exceed the image quality of 
the best film cameras.
What do you get for thousands and 
thousands of extra dollars? Here’s 
a quick checklist of what your extra 
cash buys:
 
✓ Tank-like reliability: Okay, I 
really have no experience with 
how reliable tanks are, but they 
must be pretty good if being 
built like a tank is a positive. 
Pro dSLRs have metal bodies, 
excellent sealing against the ele-
ments, and rugged controls and 
components, such as shutters 
that can operate thousands of times without failing. A typical professional 
might shoot more pictures in a day than an amateur photographer takes 
in a year. I know one canine photographer (he’s not a dog; he photo-
graphs Pomeranians) who recently passed the 500,000 exposure mark 
with his pro camera and its original shutter. Professionals can’t afford to 
have a camera wimp out at the worst possible moment. So, professionals 
often purchase these cameras for the cameras’ ruggedness alone — and 
even then, true pros commonly buy multiple bodies in order to have a 
backup — or two or three.
 Figure 3-5: Many of the leading professional 
dSLRs have full-frame (1X crop) sensors, such 
as this model.

61
 Chapter 3: Tracking the Ideal dSLR
 
✓ Faster operation: Pro cameras generally have the most advanced auto-
focus systems available from a vendor, so they can take pictures right 
now without delay or shutter lag. They have large internal memory 
buffers that suck up exposures as fast as you can take them. And the 
speedy digital image chips process the bits and bytes, and then write 
them to your memory card. Exposure systems, too, are top-notch, both 
in accuracy and speed. Professional dSLRs are veritable speed demons.
 
✓ Faster burst modes: Whereas prosumer dSLRs are considered speedy if 
they can capture continuous-mode pictures at 3 fps, pro cameras typi-
cally can grab 4 to 11 fps without sweating. Those big memory buffers 
(to store images until they can be written to the memory card) and digi-
tal signal processing chips make this speed possible.
 
✓ More options: Pro cameras let you set up multiple sets of shooting 
parameters and recall them at the press of a button, so you can tailor 
your camera’s operation to particular environments. You might find 
other choices not available to lesser cameras, such as the ability to save 
images in compressed or uncompressed RAW format, TIFF, and mul-
tiple levels of JPEG quality. (You can find out more about file formats in 
Chapter 8.)
 
✓ Bigger sensors: Some pro cameras offer larger, full-frame sensors, which 
can be an advantage to pro shooters. These sizeable, non-cropped sen-
sors are available from Sony, Nikon, and Canon; and a few so-called 
medium-format dSLRs, such as those from Mamiya and Hasselblad. 
(Chapter 2 explains lens crop in detail.)
dSLR-like cameras — hanging on?
A strange thing happened after the first low-cost digital SLR cameras emerged 
onto the market. The cameras positioned at the former high end of the ama-
teur/photo-enthusiast market were suddenly described as SLR-like. These 
cameras happened to be priced about the same as the new dSLRs but didn’t 
have interchangeable lenses. They did have a form of through-the-lens view-
ing that lesser point-and-shoot cameras lacked, so they became SLR-like, and 
now you sometimes hear them called bridge or transitional cameras. Many 
of them have packed the most zoom range possible into their optics and are 
referred to as super-zoom cameras. What’s the story here?
In their time, cameras sporting internal electronic viewfinders (a miniature 
LCD inside the camera) were the next best thing and were all that serious 
photographers who had limited bank accounts could afford. Their viewing 
systems were far superior to the optical viewfinder windows that supple-
mented rear-panel LCDs in point-and-shoot cameras. You could use these 
electronic viewfinders (EVFs) to compose your shots accurately, even in 
bright sunlight, and with luck, monitor depth-of-field. Many of them were 

62
Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
designed with real controls, including zoom rings, rather than the motorized 
gadgets and buttons the point-and-shoot cameras used.
Justifying EVF cameras’ existence in these days of $500-neighborhood dSLRs 
is tough. Some EVF cameras manage to live on by providing features that you 
can’t get in cameras that have interchangeable lenses, such as a fixed 18X 
zoom (the equivalent of 28mm to 504mm) or ISO settings up to ISO 10,000. 
But most EVF cameras are more SLR-ish than SLR-like. Table 3-1 lists some of 
their advantages and disadvantages.
Table 3-1 
The Pros and Cons of EVF Cameras
Pro
Con
EVF cameras are smaller. If ultra-compact 
size is important to you, a non-SLR might 
have the size you need.
The smaller sensors of EVF cam-
eras produce more noise, even 
at the reduced ISO range these 
models offer.
The typical EVF model offers excellent 
zoom range right out of the box, so you 
don’t have to lug lenses around.
They don’t have interchangeable 
lenses.
An EVF camera might have features that 
cost extra to add to your dSLR, such as 
built-in image shake technology.
It doesn’t have SLR-fast response; 
shutter lag is still very much a prob-
lem with most EVF models.
You can shoot movies with a non-SLR, 
and you can preview an image on the 
LCD before you take it. (More dSLRs are 
offering movie capabilities, and nearly all 
recently introduced cameras now provide 
Live View.)
The LCD might offer a grainy, ghost-
ridden view that’s neither especially 
bright nor particularly useful for 
gauging depth-of-field.
If you’re reading this book, you’re probably irreconcilably biased toward a 
digital SLR. However, an EVF/super-zoom camera that you already own or 
can pick up at a reasonable price can make a good spare camera or a fall-
back camera for when you can’t or don’t want to take your dSLR.
Checking Out Key Features
When you approach your final purchase decision, look at the individual fea-
tures of the cameras that you’re considering and how those features affect 
you. I cover most of the main topics in the following sections in more detail in 
Chapter 2, and Chapter 7 has information on special features. The following 
sections summarize what you need to know.

63
 Chapter 3: Tracking the Ideal dSLR
 
If you make a list of features and divide it into three categories, as I explain in 
the section “Features for Now and the Future,” earlier in this chapter, this list 
can help you decide which camera best suits your needs.
Lenses
The ability to swap optics is the reason why the word lens is so important in the 
abbreviation SLR. Some factors to consider when choosing a camera include
 
✓ Lens quality: Are the lenses of a particular vendor known for their qual-
ity, both optically and mechanically (what’s known as build quality)? 
Does this vendor offer multiple lens lines that include economy lenses, 
which might be a little less rugged but affordably priced, as well as 
pro-style lenses that have the ultimate in sharpness and ruggedness? 
Depending on the type of photography you do, trading off a little weight 
and replacing a few metal parts with tough plastic might be important. 
Or, you might require lenses that can take punishment and still deliver 
sparkling results.
 
✓ Focal length ranges: Some 
vendors are stronger in the 
telephoto lens department and 
weaker when it comes to provid-
ing wide-angle lenses. Canon, 
for example, sells an amazing 
array of long lenses, many with 
built-in image stabilization, and 
offered at amazing prices. Nikon 
has some exquisite wide-angle 
lenses. Some vendors do a 
better job with certain kinds of 
zooms than others. Make sure 
that the vendor of the camera 
you’re contemplating offers 
lenses in the focal lengths and 
maximum apertures that you 
require. If not, see whether you 
can fill in the lenses you require 
from third-party vendors, such 
as Tokina, Tamron, and Sigma. 
These manufacturers’ optical 
offerings might be completely 
satisfactory — or they might not. 
See whether the lenses you need 
are readily available at a price 
that you can afford. Figure 3-6 
shows a typical lens that’s often 
used as basic optics for some 
Nikon dSLRs.
Figure 3-6: This lens covers a useful 18mm-to-
105mm zoom range and also has built-in 
anti-shake image-stabilization features.

64
Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
 
✓ Special features: Focal lengths, zoom ranges, and maximum aperture 
aren’t the only features that you want in a lens. You might need close 
focusing, fast autofocus (which is partially dependent on the design of 
the lens), or the ability to control the out-of-focus areas of an image. 
(Nikon, for example, has a line of DC lenses that are great for portraiture 
because you can control how the defocused areas look.)
Sensors and image processors
 
The sensor and digital signal processor have as much effect on your final 
image as the lens does, so be sure to check out the qualities of your dream 
camera’s imager very carefully. In particular, look into the following. You’ll 
find comparison information about various dSLR cameras at review sites like 
DPReview (www.dpreview.com):
 
✓ The amount of noise it generates at low ISO settings (ISO 100 or ISO 
200) and at high ISO settings (ISO 800 and above): Some photogra-
phers like the low noise produced by the prosumer Canon digital cam-
eras, compared to that of competing Nikon dSLRs. Others find the Canon 
images so smooth that they look plasticky, and those people prefer the 
extra sharpness and texture of the Nikon sensor. Chapter 11 tells you 
more about noise.
 
✓ The sensor’s dynamic range: Do your photos have detail in both shad-
ows and highlights? Does the camera produce accurate colors? Do the 
images look sharp? If you answered no to any of these questions, you 
probably need to keep looking for the right camera.
CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) and CCD (charge 
coupled device) sensors show little difference in quality these days, but 
significant differences exist among sensors from different vendors. Do some 
comparisons now so that you can be happy with your camera later.
Exposure systems
Exposure systems range from simple spot metering, to center weighted, to 
complex evaluative systems that examine a huge matrix of points to arrive 
at the correct settings. Often, all three systems dwell in harmony together in 
one camera. To better understand exposure systems and how they can affect 
your work, check out Chapter 5 before you select your camera.

65
 Chapter 3: Tracking the Ideal dSLR
Focusing systems
The focusing system of a dSLR partially depends on two factors:
 
✓ Mechanisms: Built into the lens; move the lens elements to the proper 
position at the camera’s direction
 
✓ Electronics: In the camera; evaluate the contrast of the image to decide 
exactly where the correct focus point is
That’s complicated stuff! Yet, if your image is out of focus, odds are that your 
picture is totally ruined. You can often partially or fully correct for improper 
exposure. Color-correction tools in an image editor can fix bad white balance. 
You can crop your photos to remove extraneous subject matter. But if your 
image is badly out of focus, you should end its suffering by pressing Delete.
 
You definitely want a camera that has an efficient autofocus system and 
one that focuses accurately. You sometimes need to specify what point the 
camera should use as the point of focus, especially when your main subject 
is not in the center of the viewfinder. Find out whether the camera locks 
focus when you press the shutter 
release halfway down or whether it 
can continue to seek a focus point 
for moving subjects right until the 
instant of exposure.
You might appreciate a camera 
that can predict where the focus 
point will be when a moving object 
is racing towards or away from the 
camera.
You might want the ability to switch 
quickly to manual focus by using a 
switch — either on the lens or on 
the camera body — as shown in 
Figure 3-7. Some kinds of photogra-
phy, particularly macro (close-up) 
photography, work best when the 
photographer has complete control 
over focus.
Figure 3-7: A convenient switch on the camera 
or lens enables you to quickly change from 
automatic focus to manual focus.

Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
Special features
Digital SLRs are rife with special 
features, such as the ability to shoot 
movies. You can find enough of 
these special features, in fact, that 
I devote all of Chapter 7 to describ-
ing features such as movie-shooting, 
extra-fast burst modes, anti-dust 
features (which literally shake the 
debris off your sensor before it can 
appear in your images), image stabi-
lization, time-lapse photography, and 
so forth.
If you have specialized needs, you 
might have special requirements. For 
instance, if you like to photograph 
the progress of blossoming flowers 
or construction, you might require 
the ability to connect to a computer 
by using a USB connector and cap-
ture time-lapse images. Or maybe 
you want to shoot movies by using 
your dSLR and need an HDMI port to 
connect to your HDTV. Both types 
of ports are shown at right in Figure 
3-8. Perhaps you’ve discovered that 
the vibration of the flip-up mirror in 
an SLR spoils your critical close-up 
or telephoto shots, so you want a camera that has pre-shot mirror lockup. 
Maybe you want to be able to instantly transmit your photos wirelessly to a 
laptop computer for immediate review by an assistant. If infrared photogra-
phy is your most important application, you need a camera that’s especially 
sensitive to infrared illumination.
If you do have specialized camera needs, pay particular attention to how well 
your potential new digital camera fills them. Nothing is more frustrating than 
having a hard-to-fulfill requirement while owning a camera that’s just a little 
less than what you require in that department.
Figure 3-8: A USB port (top socket at right) and 
HDMI port (bottom right) allow you to connect 
your camera directly to a laptop computer or 
HDTV, respectively.

emember how cool it was to pick out your school supplies every 
August before classes began? You got to choose the exact notebook 
and paper that you wanted. You likely selected your pencils and book covers 
with the greatest of care. If you’re younger than I am, you probably 
spent a lot of time deliberating over which Trapper Keeper 
to get. If you’re my age, the big decision was which quill 
pen to buy. If you own a digital SLR, you can experience 
the same joy of buying school supplies — but all year 
’round!
One of the best things about dSLR cameras is that 
they’re almost infinitely expandable. Hundreds of 
different lenses are available, of course, but that’s 
another whole level of accessorization. I’m talking 
about add-ons that let you focus closer, operate 
your camera more efficiently, hold your camera 
steady for long exposures, or do things that you 
otherwise couldn’t do at all.
I’m sure you already know about some of the accessories in 
this chapter. Some are a bit more obscure, though. Only a few 
of them, such as memory cards, are absolutely essential for taking 
photos. However, you might take comfort in knowing that you can find so 
many tools available if you want them. This chapter shows you some of the 
basic items to consider.

68
Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
Memory Cards in a Flash
Most digital SLRs are furnished without any memory card at all, so you 
need to buy one as soon as you get your camera. Of course, even entry-level 
point-and-shoot digicams frequently come without a card or are furnished 
with a useless small-capacity card, so this omission comes as no surprise.
Whereas low-end cameras come with no card to save costs, more sophis-
ticated cameras (such as a dSLR) lack a memory card because the vendor 
likely doesn’t know exactly what kind of card you prefer. By not including any 
memory card at all, your camera vendor is upholding your right to choose 
the card that exactly suits your needs. So, when choosing a memory card for 
your digital SLR, here are the key factors to consider:
 
✓ Write speed: Perhaps you shoot a lot of sports and want to use only 
high-speed memory cards that can suck up bursts of shots as quickly as 
you can take them.
 
✓ Capacity: With most dSLRs, a 1GB card is almost useless because of its 
low capacity. Who needs a card that holds as few as 40 shots? You might 
not want to bother carrying around any card smaller than 2GB or 4GB 
(as shown in Figure 4-1) in capacity.
 
✓ Form factor: You usually don’t 
need to consider this factor — 
unless you have a camera that 
accepts more than one type of 
media. Maybe your digital SLR 
accepts both CompactFlash 
(CF) and Secure Digital (SD) 
memory cards. A few do, and 
at least one camera accepts 
both SD cards and xD Picture 
Cards. Sony dSLRs have tra-
ditionally accommodated 
both CompactFlash and Sony 
Memory Stick Pro Duo cards 
(using an adapter for the latter).
In the following sections, I explain 
the three main considerations in 
more detail.
The right write speed
Memory cards operate a little bit like hard drives in the sense that some 
of them can write data faster than others. Although cards don’t have the 
rotating platters that hard drives have, they do have electrical properties 
that limit the speed with which they can accept and store information.
Figure 4-1: A memory card that has at 
least 4GB of capacity is suitable for most 
digital SLRs.

69
 Chapter 4: Accessorizing Your dSLR
Real-world write speeds typically range from about 3MB per second to about 
30MB per second, and they depend greatly on the speed of your digital camera. 
You might be able to use a particular card at 3MB per second in one camera 
and at 8MB per second in another that does a better job of writing informa-
tion quickly. However, the speeds are proportional: A card rated as a better 
performer works faster in all the dSLRs that you use it with, regardless of the 
actual speed and regardless of the type and size of the file being written.
 
Fast memory cards can help if your digital SLR has a small buffer that can 
hold only a few shots. The faster your card can accept images, the more 
quickly you can resume shooting. Some digital single lens reflex cameras 
can’t shoot and write at the same time, so this can be critical. For more info 
about memory cards, check out memory card guru Rob Galbraith’s Web site 
(www.robgalbraith.com), which I describe in Chapter 16.
The eggs/basket myth
Memory card capacity doubles and prices drop 
by half with amazing regularity. Any time digi-
tal photographers start to make the transition 
from one common size to the next-larger size, 
doomsayers come out of the woodwork warn-
ing against putting all your photo eggs in one 
basket. The same folks who are saying it’s fool-
ish to use a single 8GB memory card, rather 
than two 4GB cards (or even four 2GB cards), 
were panicking over the thought of storing 
their images on one of those new-fangled 1GB 
memory cards, rather than the 256MB versions 
common only a few years ago.
The fact is, unless you’re using a camera that 
accepts more than one memory card at the 
same time and you write each picture to both 
cards, you’re always storing your pictures in a 
single basket until you choose to back it up. The 
chief variables are how many pictures you’re 
putting at risk and the nature of the peril. If you 
use more memory cards, you increase your 
chances of accidentally formatting one or dam-
aging another. With CompactFlash cards, it’s 
actually more common to damage the camera 
through over-frequent insertions and remov-
als than to lose images to a faulty card. Nor do 
memory cards work perfectly until they’re full, 
and then mysteriously fail. It’s just as likely that 
a 4GB card becomes corrupt after, say, 2GB of 
photos as it is for an 8GB card to flake out after 
2GB of images have been stored. Your risk is 
identical in either case.
Would you insist that your family drive in two 
cars to each destination? How many people are 
riding in each car? How likely is a traffic acci-
dent in your location? Obviously, the risks are 
impossible to assess. Each photographer should 
realize that malfunctioning memory cards are 
also exceedingly rare, and each must decide for 
him- or herself how many images he or she can 
comfortably expose to such a minuscule risk.
In my day-to-day shooting, I use the largest 
memory cards I have (at present, 32GB cards) 
to avoid needless swaps (which would cause 
me to lose pictures that I couldn’t take during 
the switch-over). When I travel or shoot any 
kind of once-in-a-lifetime event (such as a wed-
ding), I back up my photos on the spot — to two 
backup devices. I don’t care how many baskets 
I must use, as long as I take good care of those 
baskets.

70
Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
Finding the key to the (capa)city
You must weigh technical, cost, and practical considerations when choosing 
memory card capacity:
 
✓ Technical: Some older dSLRs can’t use memory cards that have capaci-
ties of more than 2GB because they aren’t compatible with the file 
system used for larger cards. (Check with your vendor in case a firm-
ware update can fix this limitation.) You might find some 4GB cards that 
have a switch to transform them into a pair of 2GB cards-in-one, but this 
is a clumsy solution. If your camera is limited to 2GB storage, that’s the 
largest card you should buy. In practice, the only dSLR you’re likely to 
encounter that has this limitation is the Nikon D50, which can’t work 
with SDHC memory cards (which are all larger than 2GB).
 
✓ Cost: If an 8GB card costs more 
than twice as much as a 4GB 
card, it isn’t an economical 
buy — unless you really need 
an 8GB memory card, rather 
than several modules of other 
sizes, such as those shown in 
Figure 4-2. If you must have the 
higher capacity to keep from 
switching cards often, or if you 
plan to upgrade to a higher 
resolution dSLR in the future 
and want to use the same cards, 
consider spending more per gigabyte for the components that you buy 
now. While I write this, 8GB cards cost almost exactly double the 4GB 
versions; 16GB cards cost twice as much as 8GB modules, and even 
32GB cards (which I favor) are roughly just twice the cost of their 16GB 
counterparts. Clearly, the trend in cost effectiveness is towards higher 
capacity memory cards.
 
✓ Practical: Some photographers are nervous about putting all their photo 
eggs in one basket. They fear having a card failure or, more commonly, 
losing the card altogether. Using a smaller number of higher-capacity 
media does put you at risk of losing a chunk of — or even all — your 
vacation to Paris if something bad happens. Only you can weigh the 
risks. However, as you can see in the following section, you can take 
steps to minimize picture loss.
Storing Your Images
You don’t keep your images stored on your flash memory cards (which I 
discuss in the preceding sections) for very long. The first chance you 
get, copy them to your computer’s hard drive for reviewing, editing, and 
Figure 4-2: A selection of memory cards lets 
you keep your photo eggs in multiple baskets.

71
 Chapter 4: Accessorizing Your dSLR
printing. The second chance you get, copy them to more permanent storage 
for archiving. So, backup media is high on your list of accessories for your 
dSLR.
Exploring options for backup media
The most common way to store images is on CDs or DVDs. All commercial 
computers built today, even laptops, have some sort of CD/DVD-burning 
capability. The exception might be super-compact netbooks, such as the 
Acer Aspire that I use. However, I can still attach a DVD burner to it by using 
its USB port.
 
You can also purchase standalone 
battery-operated burners and hard 
drives (dubbed personal storage 
devices, or PSDs) that have 20GB to 
40GB of storage that you can use 
to offload your images while you’re 
traveling. Some photographers 
prefer the portable DVD burners 
to the PSDs because the hard-drive 
solutions are subject to the same 
potential problems that any hard 
drive can suffer. Non-rewriteable 
optical media that’s verified when originally written should remain 
readable for at least long enough to copy it to additional backup discs when 
you return. I like the PSDs (see Figure 4-3) because they’re much more 
compact than DVD burners and have proven reliable enough for my needs. 
(When I’m being especially careful, I take along two PSDs, or a laptop and a 
PSD, and then back up to both.)
If you own an Apple iPod, consider buying one of the card-reader adapters 
available from several vendors. You can use these adapters to copy your 
images to your iPod. Then, you can transfer those images to your computer 
later. The only problem with the iPod solution is that transfer is very, very 
slow and uses up a lot of your MP3 player’s power in a very short time.
Another increasingly attractive option for medium-term (or long-term) 
storage is an external hard drive. Because I have memory cards that hold two 
to four times as much information as a standard DVD, external hard-drive 
storage has become a mainstay for me.
I have four 1TB hard drives built into my computer, and all my most recent 
photographs are stored there. I also have four external 1TB drives connected 
over the USB bus, and I use a backup program (mine is TrueImage Home from 
Acronis — www.acronis.com) to copy all new and modified files from my 
Figure 4-3: Personal storage devices (PSDs) 
are standalone hard drive backup units.

72
Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
internal hard drives to the external drives once a day. I plug everything into 
an Uninterruptible Power Source (UPS) that has a surge protector, so my 
external drives are safe from power fluctuations, and I can unhook them 
and store them off-site, if I want. That option offers protection from fire and 
natural disasters.
But wait! There’s more. I also have a device called a Drobo, from Data 
Robotics, Inc., (www.drobo.com) which is an external case that has 
four 1.5TB drives arranged in what’s called a RAID (Redundant Array of 
Inexpensive Disks) setup. My images are also backed up to the Drobo. If 
one of the four individual drives fails, I can simply replace it with a new one, 
and the data that the damaged disk contained is restored to the new one 
automatically. (Although this process can take several days to complete.)
You may not be as paranoid about losing images as I am, so DVDs, CDs, and 
simple external hard drives may be sufficient for your needs.
Creating image archives that last
According to the National Institute of Standards Technology (NIST), current 
DVD/CD technology is suitable for archiving images for tens of years, at a 
minimum.
Of course, not just any media can last that long. Nor should it need to. Within 
10 to 20 years, a newer, better storage medium likely will come along, and 
you can transfer all your image files to that medium, in the same way that 
you copied your floppy-disk files to CD when floppies faded from use.
External hard drives, like my backup disks and Drobo, last at least a few 
years, too. But, while hard-disk capacity increases, I tend to copy existing 
images over to new drives every few years. The important thing, whether 
you use DVD/CDs or hard drives, is to have multiple copies of your images, 
preferably with at least one copy stored off-site.
 
To improve your chances of retaining your priceless images for the ages, 
you need to use media that resists the rigors of aging and protects your 
discs from rough handling, heat, humidity, and direct light. Although 
rewritable CDs and DVDs are fine for temporary storage, for archiving 
images, you’re better off with write-once CD-R and DVD-R/DVD+R media, 
rather than the rewritable RW/+RW variety. And because dual-layer DVDs 
and Blu-Ray are still new technologies, you probably want to avoid them, too. 
Although they have double the capacity (up to 25 and 50GB with Blu-Ray), 
the media currently costs much more, and so they aren’t quite as economical 
for backup, either.

73
 Chapter 4: Accessorizing Your dSLR
Maximizing the life of your CDs and DVDs
By taking a few precautions, you can avoid losing 
your archived images unnecessarily through 
age. Here’s the regimen to follow so that you get 
the most from your CD or DVD archives:
 ✓ Don’t flex or bend your discs, and store 
them vertically in a cool, dry area as much 
as possible.
 ✓ Never use a solvent-based marking pen in 
the data area. The safest place to jot infor-
mation about your disc is in the clear center 
area around the hub.
 ✓ If you use labels, make sure they adhere 
perfectly. Irregularities, such as bubbles, 
can imbalance the disc and cause tracking 
errors.
 ✓ If you must remove dirt or fingerprints from 
the read side of the disc, use a CD or lens 
cloth, and wipe in straight lines out from 
the center. Never use a circular motion or 
wood-based products, such as facial tissue. 
You can use isopropyl alcohol, clear water, 
or soapy water to clean a grimy disc, but 
never use acetone or antistatic agents.
 ✓ Make multiple copies of your photo discs 
and store at least one copy offsite.
Of course, like external hard drives, CD-Rs and DVD-R/DVD+Rs aren’t neces-
sarily permanent, either. The organic dyes, like the dyes in color film and 
papers, change over long periods of time as part of a natural process. You 
can accelerate that process if you expose them to high temperature and 
humidity. These dyes are also sensitive to UV (ultraviolet) illumination, so 
they fade on exposure to direct sunlight.
In the case of CDs, the technology is fairly stable, so after you locate a name 
brand that purports to have the permanence you’re looking for, you can 
generally stick with it. The technology for recordable DVDs is a little more 
fluid because vendors regularly increase the recording speed of the media by 
using more sensitive dyes, and they switch to double-layer systems to boost 
capacity.
 
Even the worst optical media lasts a year or two, if you treat it gently. After 
a period of time, a few bits here and there are lost while the disc degrades. 
You might not even notice, at first, because error correction routines can 
usually reconstruct limited amounts of unreadable data. When a disc starts 
developing uncorrectable errors, the end is near. For tips on keeping your 
discs in good shape, see the sidebar “Maximizing the life of your CDs and 
DVDs” in this chapter.

Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
Filtering Factors
Filters are those glass or gelatin disks or squares that are affixed to the 
front of your camera’s lens, changing the light that passes through the 
lens in some way. Filters were really popular before the advent of digital 
photography because some of the effects that you could get with them 
weren’t possible (or easy) to achieve in the darkroom. I own dozens of them, 
including a complete set of decamired color-correction filters, which many of 
today’s photographers have never heard of.
 
Glass and gelatin filters are less used today among casual photographers 
because you can achieve many of the effects they provide within Photoshop. 
Yet, you can’t create all filtration effects in the digital darkroom. Here’s a 
description of the most essential filter add-ons:
 
✓ Infrared: Many digital SLRs are capable of taking photographs by 
using only infrared illumination, which produces a spectacular effect 
outdoors. You can get dark skies, vivid clouds, and ghostly white 
trees in your landscape shots and strange, pale complexions with your 
photographs of humans. However, you must buy an infrared filter that 
blocks visible light — and be prepared to shoot at slow shutter speeds 
(because very little light is left for the exposure). Also, you can’t preview 
your shot (because an SLR viewfinder turns black when an infrared 
filter is mounted, and Live View doesn’t always offer a clear look at your 
composition, either). For more on infrared photography, see Chapters 7 
and 15.
 
✓ Polarizers: Polarizing filters, like the one shown in Figure 4-4, can reduce 
the glare bouncing off shiny surfaces in your photos. Simply attach the 
filter and rotate it until the glare disappears. These filters can also help 
deepen the contrast of the sky from certain angles.
 
 Be certain to buy a circular polarizer, rather than a linear polarizer, 
for your dSLR. (All polarizers are round; circular refers to the way in 
which the filter handles light.) Circular polarizers don’t interfere with 
the auto-exposure mechanism of your camera in the way that linear 
polarizers can.
 
✓ Neutral density: The third kind of filter that every digital SLR photog-
rapher should own is a neutral density (ND) filter, so called because it 
blocks light but is neutral in color. ND filters come with various assigned 
filter factors, such as ND2 (reduces the light by 1 f-stop), ND4 (reduces 
light 2 f-stops) and ND8 (cuts down 3 f-stops). Like with most filters, they 
can be stacked to combine the effects of more than one, as long as the 
additional filters in the pack aren’t so thick that they become visible in 
the image, thereby cutting off corners. (This is called vignetting.) Neutral 
density filters also come in a split variety — the top half (or bottom 
half or one side, if you rotate it) has neutral density, and the other half 
is clear.

Things to do with ND filters
You can do a lot of amazing things by using a 
neutral density (ND) filter, including rendering 
objects invisible! All ND filters decrease the 
amount of light that reaches the sensor, so you 
need to use a longer exposure than you would 
without the filter (or let your camera adjust the 
exposure for you automatically). Here are the key 
applications that you can take advantage of:
 ✓ Use the large f-stop you prefer. Sometimes, 
the scene has too much light to use the 
large f-stop that you want to work with (in 
order to reduce depth-of-field). Some dSLRs 
have ISO settings no lower than ISO 200, so 
in bright sunlight, even a 1/4,000 of a second 
shutter speed means that the largest f-stop 
that you can use is about f/4. Add an ND2 
or ND4 filter to make f/2.8 or f/2 available 
to you.
 ✓ Use the slow shutter speed you want. 
Perhaps you want to get the classic blurry-
water effect when photographing a flowing 
stream at a slow shutter speed while the 
camera’s mounted on a tripod. At ISO 200, 
using f/22 gives you a shutter speed of 1/100 of 
a second under bright sunlight. If, as is likely, 
your mountain stream isn’t in bright sunlight, 
you still probably can’t use a shutter speed 
any longer than about 1/30 to 1/15 of a second. 
An ND filter can give you the half-second 
to several-second exposures you need for 
truly cool-looking water effects, such as the 
one shown in the following figure, which I 
further enhanced in Photoshop.
 ✓ Make moving objects vanish. The moving 
cars and people in your scene distract from 
the image of the building you’re trying to 
capture. No problem. Use an ND8 or heftier 
neutral density filter (stack several filters, if 
you need to), mount the camera on a tripod, 
and shoot an exposure of 30 seconds or 
even longer. Unless a traffic light halts traf-
fic, likely no individual person or vehicle is 
in the image long enough to register. If you 
have enough ND filter power at your dis-
posal, this trick works in full daylight, so you 
can create your own ghost town.
 ✓ Balance the sky and foreground. In most 
scenes, the sky is much brighter than the 
foreground. A split ND filter, with the dark 
portion rotated so that it’s on top, can even 
out the exposure for the two halves, making 
those washed-out clouds visible again.

✓ Special effects: A lot of different filters produce special effects, including 
star-like points on highlights, prisms, special colors, and so forth. All 
the leading filter vendors offer these effects, but the 140 spectacular 
filters offered by Cokin (www.cokin.com) are in a class by themselves.

The Tripod: Your Visible Means of Support
One way to tell the casual photographer from the serious photographer is 
the size of the tripod he or she uses. (Snapshooters don’t have any tripod 
at all and are probably none the worse for it.) Casual photographers rarely 
shoot the longer exposures that need help from a tripod, and the lenses of 
their digicams aren’t long enough to require a tripod’s steadying influence. 
That’s all for the better because photographers who aren’t serious photo 
enthusiasts are likely to purchase flimsy tripods that don’t do what they’re 
supposed to, in any case.
When a shooter evolves into a photo enthusiast, the real value of a tripod 
becomes evident. The first step is to spend $100 on a “really good” 
tripod, which will turn out to be not so really good, after all. However, 
the money isn’t totally wasted because experience with inadequate tripods 
provides a valuable education that comes in handy when it’s time to buy 
the real thing.

77
 Chapter 4: Accessorizing Your dSLR
You know you’ve met a serious photographer when he or she unfolds a 
beautiful work of art made of carbon-fiber or magnesium alloy, or maybe 
even volcanic basalt with titanium trimmings, topped with a quick-release 
grip-ball head that allows pivoting the camera in any direction in seconds. 
Such a tripod is likely to be larger and steadier than the amateur jobs (which 
frequently have tell-tale leg braces because they need them) but still weigh 
a lot less thanks to the exotic materials used in its construction. Although a 
really good tripod can cost $500 (don’t gasp; I wanted to say $800 but didn’t 
think you’d believe me), it can be a once-in-a-lifetime investment. I bought 
my first tripod when I was in college, and it served me ably for many years. 
It would still be in everyday use if I hadn’t started traveling more and had to 
upgrade to lightweight carbon fiber models, including one $550 gem that fits 
in my carry-on luggage.
Putting a tripod to good use
A tripod is much more than a three-legged camera stand. A tripod can do a 
lot for you and let you take pictures that you couldn’t get otherwise. Its key 
uses are
 
✓ Holding the camera steady: If you need a long shutter speed for a 
picture in dim light, a tripod reduces the loss in sharpness from camera 
shake. Notice that I said reduces. You might still have camera shake 
when using a tripod if the tripod itself is unsteady or gets jiggled during 
the exposure. A steady camera is essential when shooting long expo-
sures in dim light or when using a telephoto lens, which magnifies vibra-
tions along with your image. Few people can hand-hold a camera for 1/30 
of a second or slower with a normal or wide-angle lens. Fewer can get 
good shots at a shutter speed slower than the reciprocal of the effective 
lens focal length — for example, 1/300 of a second with the equivalent of a 
300mm lens (which might actually be a 200mm lens before a 1.5X crop 
factor).
 
✓ Serving as a camera stand: Perhaps you want to get in the picture, too, 
or do something else besides stand behind the camera while it takes the 
photo. Even if the shutter speed is high enough that you don’t need the 
tripod’s steadying influence, the tripod fixes the camera in one place 
long enough for you to take the picture with a self-timer, cable release, 
or remote control device.
 
✓ Providing precise, stable positioning: A tripod lets you frame a shot 
exactly and then take several pictures with the same framing. You 
may find this capability useful for landscapes, portraits, or any other 
shot that you want to repeat. Stability is almost essential for close-up 
pictures when precise depth-of-field or focus considerations come 
into play.

78
Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
 
✓ Keeping the camera level for multiple shots in a panorama series: You 
can fit some tripods with a panorama head that can help you provide 
the precise positioning and proper overlap for these photos.
 
✓ Providing a platform for HDR photography: HDR (or high dynamic range) 
photography is a current fad that landscape photographers, especially, 
are embracing. With HDR imaging, you need to take three or more photos, 
exposed one f-stop apart, which are later combined in an image editor or 
special HDR utility software program to produce a stunning image that 
has a lot of detail in the deepest shadows and brightest highlights. (Such 
a long tonal range is otherwise beyond the capabilities of the typical dSLR 
sensor.) I call HDR a fad because I hope it’ll eventually become unneces-
sary when camera vendors offer extended range sensors that do the same 
thing. Also, we’re seeing a remarkable lack of imagination in the typical 
HDR photo, which is usually a vertically composed landscape that has 
water at the bottom and sky at the top, taken with an ultra-wide-angle lens 
that shows a lot of both. Still, a tripod offers a solid platform for taking 
that batch of HDR photos.
The chief disadvantage of tripods is 
that you have to carry them along 
when you need them, and sturdy-
but-lightweight tripods can be 
expensive. An alternative is to use 
a tripod substitute, which can vary 
from a simple clamp-like device, to 
beanbags, to monopods.
I always, without fail, carry my Joby 
(www.joby.com) Gorillapod (see 
Figure 4-5) in my bag, and most of 
the time, I carry along a monopod, 
too. I have a 170mm-to-500mm 
zoom lens that I like very much, but 
I find that it’s virtually impossible 
to use without, at the very least, 
a monopod. At 500mm (750mm 
after applying the crop factor), I’ve 
detected visible camera shake in my 
photos, even when I use a 1/2,000 of a 
second shutter speed. Who wants 
to jump up to ISO 1,600 to be able 
to get a decent aperture while 
freezing camera motion when a 
tripod or monopod lets you do the 
same thing at ISO 400 or ISO 800?
Figure 4-5: A portable clamp like the Gorillapod 
allows you to use any handy stationary object 
as a support.

 Chapter 4: Accessorizing Your dSLR
Choosing a tripod
All tripods have three legs (if they have only one leg, they’re monopods). 
Some tripods can also have only two legs, but that’s because you can remove 
their third leg and use it as a monopod. Ordinarily, you find either tripods 
of monopods because a bipod has very little practical use. Here are some 
considerations for you to think about when choosing a tripod:
 
✓ What you see and what you get. Tripods always look nice in the cata-
log, but what’s shown might include several optional components that 
you don’t get unless you order them with your tripod. For example, 
high-end tripods tend to come as a set of legs only, with a center column 
that cranks up or down to extend the height of the tripod beyond what 
you get from extracting the legs. If you want a tripod head to attach your 
camera to, you might have to pay $100 extra (don’t wince; I wanted to 
say $300–$400, but I held back for your sake). Other necessary parts, 
including quick-release plates that help you mount and dismount your 
camera speedily, might be available, but they cost more.
 
✓ Leg style. The legs might be cylindrical, cylindrical but flat on one 
side, open-channel, or some other shape. They might open from two 
to five different sections. The more sections, the more compact the 
tripod is when you fold it up, but the smaller the inner sections have 
to be to fit inside the others. The legs need to be as sturdy as possible 
when extended. They shouldn’t bend or flex, and the extended tripod 
shouldn’t sway in the breeze.
 
✓ Leg height. Your tripod should extend to at least eye-level without the 
need to crank up the center column (which you should really use only 
for minor height adjustments, when you require the absolute maximum 
height, or if the column swivels to vary the shooting angle). My own 
studio tripod goes up much higher than that, so I need to stand on a 
ladder or stool to use it at its maximum height. That’s great for shooting 
photos from a higher vantage point. At the other end of the scale, 
you want some way of shooting from low angles, too, which you can 
accomplish by retracting the legs of a tripod with multiple sections or 
by swiveling or reversing the center post.
 
✓ Leg lock and positioning. Check out the method used for locking and 
unlocking the legs, and note the range of movement available. The 
best designs let you lock or unlock all the sections of a particular 
leg simultaneously, rather than one at a time, and they allow you to 
position the legs at independent angles so that you can use your tripod 
on uneven ground.

80
Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
 
✓ Use your head. The head is the 
part to which you attach your 
camera. The most common type 
is the pan/tilt head that allows 
you to pan the camera on one 
axis and tilt it on another. Fluid 
heads have a long handle that 
you can twist to release the 
head so that you can pan and 
tilt simultaneously. Increasingly 
popular are joystick and ball 
heads, such as the Photo Clam 
model shown in Figure 4-6, 
which let you tilt the camera at 
any angle.
 
✓ Fast release. Some heads come 
with quick-release plates, or you 
can fit them with quick-release 
plates. One part of the plate fas-
tens to the tripod socket of your 
camera. The other part attaches 
to the tripod. Instead of screw-
ing and unscrewing the camera 
from the tripod each time, you press a control and slide it off.
Electronic Flash in the Pan
Digital SLRs that cost around $2,000 — for the body only — generally have a 
built-in electronic flash, or speedlight. (One exception to this rule as I write 
this book is the Nikon D700, a full-frame camera that does have its own flash.)
Professional photographers probably wouldn’t use a built-in speedlight on 
their high-end cameras, usually because such units aren’t powerful enough 
for anything other than fill flash and provide the kind of direct lighting that 
pros abhor. I’ve been paid for my photos and seen them used on the covers 
and inside magazines, but not every picture I take is destined for the cover 
of National Geographic magazine (okay, none of them are). Like you, I find 
it quite handy to be able to pop up my dSLR’s internal flash when I want to 
take a quick shot and/or don’t have my fully laden shoulder bag handy. I like 
having a flash built-in and always available.
However, like you, I’m serious about photography, and I’m glad I have my 
more powerful and flexible external flash units available to provide additional 
and supplemental lighting. In the following sections, I offer tips on the types 
of flashes you may find useful. I also explain different ways external flash 
units work with your camera, and I cover any pros and cons that you should 
know about. In Chapter 9, I explain using a flash for various effects.
Figure 4-6: A well-designed ball head allows 
tilting the camera at any angle quickly.

81
 Chapter 4: Accessorizing Your dSLR
Perusing different types of flash units
Flash units come in several types. I have a whole bunch of them, and you can 
probably use any of these types of flash with your dSLR:
 
✓ A fancy sort of flash. My $350 super-sophisticated unit can communi-
cate with my camera and do fancy tricks, such as zooming its coverage 
to match the camera lens’s zoom setting. It also reports to the camera 
the exact color temperature it uses, which results in more accurate 
hues, and adjusts its exposure by reading the light that actually goes 
through the lens. In wireless mode, I can use it off-camera with no 
connecting cable.
 
✓ Do the mashed potato. I have a big monster of a potato-masher flash 
that has massive output, which I sometimes use for sports photo-
graphy. I work with this beast when I want to, say, illuminate a fullback 
on the opposite sideline. It attaches to an external battery power pack, 
so the flash’s power lasts longer, and I never ask it to do anything fancy. 
Although it has an automatic mode, I don’t use that all the time because 
I often want to get the maximum output. The only zoom coverage 
available is through built-in wide-angle and tele-filters that modify 
the light.
 
✓ Studio flash dance. I probably get the most use out of my studio flash, 
though, which consists of a pair of large monolights (AC-powered 
flash units that have the power source built into the flash head) and two 
smaller electronic flash units that I can use as background and 
hair lights.
Tools for triggering the flash
To use an external flash, your camera needs to have some way of triggering 
the supplemental flash unit. You can do this in four ways:
 
✓ Slave operation: Perhaps you can set the external flash to function as 
a slave unit, which means it has a photocell that detects the firing of 
the camera’s main flash, and the external flash triggers in response. In 
this mode, you can use any slave-compatible external flashes, including 
those that have an add-on trigger. The problem with using slave flash is 
that you might not want both the built-in flash and the external flash to 
illuminate your scene. If you can cut the power of the internal flash, you 
might be able to reduce its impact on the photo, relegating it to a fill-
flash effect.
 
✓ Wireless mode: Some dSLRs can communicate with the same vendor’s 
electronic flash units in wireless mode. You might expect something 
called wireless to involve radio waves or, at the very least, some sort 
of infrared signal, but it can be much simpler than that. For example, 
Nikon’s flash units “talk” to compatible Nikon dSLRs by using almost 
imperceptible pre-flashes that take place an instant before the flash 

82
Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
fires. The camera’s own flash tells the external flash details, such as 
the zoom setting of the lens, the correct exposure to use, and (most 
importantly) when to fire. The external flash, in turn, responds with 
information, such as the color temperature of the illumination it 
provides. This data exchange can take place when the two flashes 
aren’t connected, or even without the built-in flash providing part of 
the main exposure.
 
✓ Hardwired PC connection: You can find some dSLRs that have a 
standard PC connection for attaching standard electronic flash units. 
(PC stands for Prontor-Compur, pioneering shutter manufacturers, 
rather than personal computer.) So, you can plug in studio flash and 
speedlights made by other vendors, assuming that the triggering 
voltage of the flash units isn’t high enough to fry the circuits of your 
dSLR. (A Wein SafeSync add-on device isolates your camera from the 
flash’s voltage. I use one to connect my studio flash to my digital 
cameras.) A PC connection, if you have one, works only with non-
dedicated flash units that can’t communicate with the camera. The only 
signal that’s exchanged between the camera and the flash is the trigger 
that fires the external unit.
 
✓ Hot shoe connection: Modern cameras, including dSLRs, tend to use 
sophisticated dedicated flash units that require full communication 
between the camera and speedlight. These units require special 
connectors, usually in the form of a flash accessory hot shoe on top 
of the camera, such as the one shown in Figure 4-7. The shoe has 
multiple contacts. You can plug in a flash unit designed to work with 
these contacts or use a hot-shoe adapter that allows you to connect a 
flash by using a cable instead.

Other Must-Have (Or Maybe-Have) Gear
After you collect the most essential accessories that your digital SLR needs, if 
you have any money left over, you might want to consider some of the 
add-ons I discuss in the following sections.
A second camera
I’ve gone to Europe on vacation and taken along only a single camera and 
lens (I was planning on shooting movies most of the time). But now that I 
think about it, that wasn’t a smart thing to do. When people are paying 
me money to take pictures, I always have one or two spare camera bodies, 
extra lenses, multiple flash units — duplicates of any essential piece of 
equipment. I discovered early in my career that “Sorry, my camera broke!” 
is not an excuse that clients find acceptable. So, why was I so dumb to go 
overseas and risk arriving with no way to take photos? Umm . . . I wanted to 
travel light?
Sooner or later, you discover that a second camera body makes sense for 
you, too. Even if you aren’t 3,000 miles from home, can you really stop taking 
photos for a few weeks while your dSLR is in the shop? Haven’t you been 
in situations where you wanted to alternate between taking photos with a 
wide-angle or wide-angle zoom and a long telephoto or telephoto-zoom lens? 
Having an extra body, one for each lens, can be just what you need.
 
You don’t have to break the bank to buy your second camera body. Your 
existing lenses fit just fine if you buy another model from the same vendor, 
but you don’t need an identical camera. You can purchase an entry-level 
camera from the same vendor to supplement more expensive bodies from 
the same manufacturer. Or you might find yourself with an extra camera 
body when your favorite vendor comes out with a new model and you decide 
to buy it and keep your old camera as a spare/second camera.
Sensor cleaning kit
Like it or not, if you remove the lens from your dSLR, sooner or later, you’re 
going to have to clean dust and grime off the sensor that the sensor-cleaning 
capability of your camera didn’t remove. Available gear to do this sensor 
cleanup includes brushes, swabs, and special liquids. But all you may need 
for most cleanings is a blower bulb, such as those bulbs shown in Figure 4-8. 
You may find taking that first swipe at your sensor terrifying, but you actually 
can clean your camera’s sensor simply and relatively safely.

84
Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
Close-up equipment
A lot of available add-ons can help 
you focus close, including filter-like 
close-up attachments that screw 
onto the front of the lens, as well as 
bellows accessories that fit between 
the camera and lens.
Extension tubes, such as those 
shown in Figure 4-9, provide an 
inexpensive and versatile solution. 
You install these tubes between the 
camera and lens, and they provide 
the additional distance needed to 
focus closer. Single tubes are 
available for as little as $50, but 
you can pay $150 or more for a com-
plete set of fully automatic tubes in 
multiple lengths.
 
If you want extension tubes that you can easily use, go for ones that couple 
with the camera’s automatic focus and exposure mechanisms.

n terms of buttons, dials, and controls, comparing a typical point-and-
shoot camera with a digital SLR is like comparing a hang glider to a Boeing 
787 cockpit. Certainly, the more sophisticated option has more controls, but 
most people find it easier to flip a switch and shift a control than to yank on a 
lever, lean to the right, and pray.
Because you can do so many different things with a dSLR, the 
learning curve is a bit steep. Fortunately, your digital 787 has 
an autopilot — programmed modes — that can fly your 
photographic aircraft for you until you can ease into 
navigating solo. But you may find all those controls 
daunting at first. You might have four or five expo-
sure modes to choose from; a half-dozen different 
ways to focus; and the ability to fine-tune details, 
such as white balance, sharpness, contrast, and 
color. Because you’re a more serious photogra-
pher, those options are probably the reason you 
bought a digital SLR in the first place.
Okay, champ. You have this incredibly versatile 
gadget in your hands. How can you make it work? This 
chapter helps get you started with the toughest of the 
tough: exposure and focus.

88
Part II: Oh, Shoot! 
Discovering the Secrets of Exposure
If you’re lazy or not up to using your brain on any given day, you can set up 
your digital SLR to operate much like a glorified point-and-shoot camera. 
Turn on autofocus, set the exposure control to Auto, and fire away. When 
you depress the shutter release, your camera tries to guess which subject in 
the frame is most important, and it focuses on that. The camera attempts to 
ascertain what kind of picture you’re shooting (landscape, portrait, or close-
up, for example), and it chooses an exposure that’s probably fairly close.
Clever little algorithms choose a shutter speed that eliminates subject- or 
camera-related blur (most of the time) and an f-stop that provides a decent 
compromise between depth-of-field and proper exposure. In short, your $800 
dSLR then produces pictures just as good as a $200 snapshot camera.
But you didn’t buy your digital SLR to take snapshot pictures. You use the 
Auto mode when you hand your camera to your fumble-fingered brother-in-
law and ask him to take a picture of you and your kids. You’d rather maintain 
control over your exposures so that you can apply f-stops, shutter speeds, 
and other options creatively.
Understanding why exposure is tricky
In a perfect world, your dSLR’s sensor could capture all the photons that 
reach it from your subjects. Dark areas would be represented by photosites 
(the individual picture elements) that received few photons, and light areas 
would be registered by photosites that captured a whole lot of photons. All 
the intermediate tones would fall somewhere in between.
But it doesn’t work quite that way. Some dark areas might produce too few 
photons to produce an image at all; some very light areas might be repre-
sented by so many photons that excess light overflows from one pixel into 
adjacent pixels, causing a light smear known as blooming. (I introduce 
blooming in Chapter 2, where I explain how sensors work in more detail.)
Proper exposure helps ensure that 
the sensor receives enough light to 
capture detail in the dark areas of an 
image, but not so much that light 
areas are washed out. Figure 5-1 
shows some of the choices you 
might have to make. Exposing for the 
shadows provides a lot of detail in 
the top version (the original version 
of this image), but the highlights are 
completely washed out. The bottom 
version uses improved exposure to 
Figure 5-1: Expose an image so that highlights 
don’t wash out; you can never retrieve them.

89
 Chapter 5: Taking Control of Your dSLR
trade off some of the brightness in the shadows for more highlight detail. 
(Actually, I played with the exposure by using an image editor on the RAW 
version of the file, but these images represent real-life choices, nonetheless. 
You can find more information on using RAW files in Chapter 8.)
 
Try to preserve highlight details; you can’t retrieve them if they get washed 
out. You can much more easily brighten dark shadows than retrieve lost 
highlights.
Achieving an ideal exposure can be tricky because sensors have a fixed 
dynamic range, meaning the range over which the sensor can capture detail 
in both light and dark areas. No sensor’s dynamic range covers the full 
gamut of illumination levels that you’re likely to encounter in everyday 
photography, so finding the right exposure likely involves making a series of 
compromises.
The first compromise comes when the continuous range of brightness and 
darkness in an image is converted from that analog form into digital bits and 
bytes. During the conversion, an infinite gradation of tones is sliced up into a 
limited number of different shades — 256 different shades per color, in the 
case of the 24-bit full color you probably work with in your image editor. 
Your digital SLR might capture more different tones than that — as many as 
4,096 variations, if your camera captures 12 bits per color channel — but you 
still end up with a measly 256 tones for each color in Photoshop (unless 
you’re working with an HDR, high dynamic range, image that has more than 
8 bits per channel).
Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to make sure that the available 
tones are the right tones to represent your image. You don’t have many to 
spare. Perhaps you’re shooting a night scene and have a lot of detail in the 
shadows that you want to preserve, but you also want to keep some details 
in highlights illuminated by a street lamp. How can you even guess how the 
camera captures each of these details? Let the histogram be your guide.
Getting exposure right with the histogram
Digital SLRs include a histogram, which is a chart shown on your LCD (liquid 
crystal display) that displays the number of tones being captured at any 
brightness level. The number of pixels at each brightness level is shown on 
the histogram as a vertical bar, and there are 256 of these bars represented. 
(Your camera’s LCD might not have enough resolution to display all 256 
bars individually, but it does show the shape of the curve that those bars 
produce.) The far-left position represents the darkest tones in your image, 
and the far-right slot shows the tones in the very lightest parts of your image.

90
Part II: Oh, Shoot! 
Typically, a histogram looks something like a mountain, as shown in 
Figure 5-2. Most of the tones are clustered in the middle of the image because 
the average image has most of its detail in those middle tones. The bars are 
shorter at the dark or light ends of the scale because most images have less 
detail in the shadows and highlights. However, images that have a great 
deal of detail in the dark or light portions can have histograms that look very 
different, reflecting that particular distribution of tones.
 
 
Figure 5-2: With a well-exposed image, the histogram looks sort of like 
 
a mountain.
 
You can’t really do much to manipulate the shape of the histogram in your 
camera, other than increasing or decreasing your dSLR’s contrast setting. To 
make significant changes to the tonal value relationships, you need to use an 
image editor. But dSLR owners can use a histogram display to judge whether 
the current exposure is correct for the image. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Take your picture or view your camera’s live histogram.
 
 Some cameras can display a live histogram preview before you take the 
shot, using the Live View feature. With others, you need to take a picture 
of the scene first in order to see a histogram that you can use to make 
adjustments before shooting the real photo.
 
2. Examine the histogram with your picture review function.
 
• If an image is overexposed, the graph is shifted toward the right 
side of the histogram, with some of the pixels representing lighter 
tones clipped off entirely, as shown in Figure 5-3.

side of the graph.
 
• An underexposed image has the opposite look: The tones are 
crowded at the left side, and some of the shadow detail is clipped 
off, as shown in Figure 5-4.

3. If you see either condition, compensate by changing the f-stop, shutter 
speed, or exposure value (EV) to correct the exposure error.
 
 Most of the time, experienced photographers try to keep the important 
details from running off the right side of the graph, where thanks to 
overexposure, they’re lost forever.
 
 If you’re shooting RAW (see Chapter 8 for more about that format), you 
might be able to adjust exposure and contrast when importing the image 
into your image editor. However, most of the time, you want to get the 
exposure correct in the camera.
I spend the rest of this chapter showing how you can change the f-stop, shut-
ter speed, and EV to control the exposure.
Fine-Tuning Exposure with the Metering System
Your camera’s exposure metering system is a tireless friend that keeps 
plugging away, calculating its reckoning of the correct exposure (based on 
parameters that you set), regardless of whether you choose to pay attention. 
You can use it whether you’re setting exposure manually or using one of the 
programmed or priority modes. You can’t really turn off the exposure meter 
completely when the camera is on — although it might go to sleep after a few 
seconds of inactivity. Even then, as soon as you tap the shutter release 
button, a sleeping meter wakes up, looks at the current view through the 
lens, and reports its findings.
Like any true friend, your metering system is on its best behavior when 
you’re around. It responds with the metering mode that you prefer and 
calculates exposure based on your particular guidelines. What more could 
you ask for?
In the following sections, you can find out how metering works, and you get a 
tour of all the main metering options on your dSLR to help you choose the 
optimum setting for the type of picture that you want to take.
Metering works how?
Digital SLR exposure meters are so accurate because they interpret the 
actual light passing through the lens, which the mirror flips upward toward 
the viewfinder (or sideways, in the case of some cameras in the Olympus E 
series). The camera uses a portion of the light for viewing the image and 
some for measuring the exposure. If you zoom the lens (which often changes 
the amount of light passing through) or place a gadget (such as a filter) in 
front of the lens to modify the light, the meter sees the results and takes 
them into account. The metering system is also linked to the shutter speed 
and aperture controls, so the metering system understands the effects of 
both shutter speed and aperture on the recommended exposure.

93
 Chapter 5: Taking Control of Your dSLR
Choosing a metering scheme
Metering schemes on your dSLR enable you to configure the photosensitive 
elements of the exposure system (which can number from a dozen or so to 
thousands of individual photosites) so that the exposure system interprets 
the incoming light in a specific way. Table 5-1 explains how photographers 
typically use the most popular schemes.
Table 5-1 
Metering Schemes
Scheme
What It Does
Best Used for . . .
Center 
weighting
This system looks at the 
entire frame but tends to 
emphasize the portion of 
the image in the center, 
assigning a center weighting 
determined by the vendor, 
but which usually amounts 
to about 80 percent for the 
center and 20 percent for the 
rest of the image.
Scenes in which — d’oh — 
the most important subjects 
are in the center of the frame. 
Perhaps you’re shooting por-
traits or close-ups of flowers 
and, naturally, want to center 
your subject. Center weighting 
zeroes in on those subjects and 
isn’t influenced by very bright 
or very dark areas outside the 
center.
Spot 
metering
This method makes its 
exposure recommendations 
based only on a center spot 
shown in the viewfinder that 
might measure 6mm to 12mm. 
Illumination outside the spot 
is ignored. Your dSLR might 
allow you to choose the size 
of the center spot.
Subjects that don’t dominate 
the frame, and which are sur-
rounded by areas of misleading 
brightness or darkness. If you 
were at a Bruce Springsteen 
concert and wanted to capture 
him during a spot-lit acoustic 
set, you could use spot meter-
ing to collect exposure informa-
tion from the Boss alone. Figure 
5-5 shows the relative areas 
used by typical spot and center-
weighted metering schemes. 
(Sorry, I don’t have any photos 
of Bruce Springsteen.)
Multipoint 
/evaluative/
matrix 
metering
This mode is the default meter-
ing mode for most dSLRs. It 
collects exposure data from 
many points on the screen 
(usually not shown in the view-
finder) and uses sophisticated 
algorithms to decide which 
points to use in calculating the 
correct exposure.
Any scenes that don’t require the 
special treatment provided by 
the other two methods. In other 
words, you use multipoint meter-
ing almost all the time.

oval area).
More versatility with metering options
Your digital SLR has several options that can increase your exposure 
versatility:
 
✓ Lock in settings with exposure-lock control. When you press the 
button, the current exposure (or focus or both) is locked until you press 
the button again or take a photo. This lock gives you the freedom to set 
exposure and then reframe the photo any way that you like without wor-
rying about the preferred settings changing. This option is different from 
the normal system of locking exposure and/or focus when you press the 
shutter release partially because you don’t have to keep your finger on 
the release button. Exposure-lock control is sometimes combined with a 
focus-lock adjustment.
 
✓ Shoot a series of photos at different exposures by setting your dSLR’s 
bracketing system. The camera takes the first picture at the metered 
exposure, and then it takes the second and third at, say, one-third stop 
less exposure and one-third stop more exposure. You can set the exact 
increment, choosing to bracket by half or full stops, if you want. You can 
also bracket parameters other than exposure, such as white balance and 
flash. Your camera might allow you to bracket more than one of these 
settings in the order you choose.

95
 Chapter 5: Taking Control of Your dSLR
 
✓ Adjust the shutter speed and/or aperture combination in use without 
changing the exposure at all. If the camera chooses 1/250 of a second 
at f/8, spinning the command dial to the right might switch to 1/500 of 
a second at f/5.6, or to the left to change to 1/125 of a second at f/11. 
All these exposures are the same, but they provide different useful 
combinations of shutter speeds and f-stop sizes.
The Many Ways to Choose Exposure
If you want to get the best results, you must use the available exposure 
options — automated, manual, and semiautomatic — in an intelligent way. 
Whether you’re choosing Auto, Programmed, Aperture Priority, Shutter 
Priority, Manual, or one of the programmed Scene modes, give some thought 
to what you want to accomplish and choose the mode that’s best suited for 
your planned picture-taking session.
The following sections offer tips for selecting the right mode.
Adjusting exposure the easy way
Digital SLRs include a simple way of bumping exposure up or down through 
EV (exposure value) adjustments. You can use EV as a way of referring to 
equivalent shutter speed and aperture settings that produce the same expo-
sure. For example, if the correct exposure for a scene is 1/250 of a second at 
f/11 exactly, equivalent exposures would include 1/500 of a second at f/8 (a 
shutter speed half as long, but an aperture twice as large) and 1/125 of a second 
at f/16 (a shutter speed twice as long, but an aperture half as large). All three 
exposures would have the same EV.
Increasing or decreasing the EV adjustment adds or subtracts to the basic 
exposure. If you bumped up exposure by one EV, you could change the shut-
ter speed to 1/125 of a second while keeping the f-stop at f/11, or you could use 
the equivalent exposure of 1/250 of a second at f/8. Reducing exposure by one 
EV works in the opposite direction: You can shorten the shutter speed or 
make the aperture smaller. It doesn’t matter. EV is a quick way to add or sub-
tract exposure without fiddling with the shutter speed or aperture controls 
directly.
Your digital SLR has an EV button somewhere, usually on the top surface 
of the camera near the shutter release button. Press it and use the corre-
sponding EV control (usually a command dial or cursor pad button) to 
adjust the EV up or down one increment. This adjustment overrides your 
camera’s auto-exposure setting. In effect, you’re giving your image more or 
less exposure than the exposure meter indicates when you change the EV.

96
Part II: Oh, Shoot! 
Whether the camera adjusts the aperture or shutter speed is determined by 
your current shooting mode:
 
✓ A programmed exposure mode: The camera might adjust either value. 
It’s that simple.
 
✓ Aperture Priority mode: In this mode, you set the f-stop and let the 
camera determine the shutter speed, making an EV change bump the 
shutter speed up or down.
 
✓ Shutter Priority mode: In this mode, you set the shutter speed and the 
meter sets the f-stop, so an EV adjustment makes the aperture larger or 
smaller.
 
✓ Auto mode: The camera sets both shutter speed and aperture with no 
input from you.
In the following sections, I discuss these modes (Program, Aperture Priority, 
and Shutter Priority) in more detail.
Giving up control (in Program mode)
If you don’t want absolute control over your exposure, you have an alterna-
tive to the dreaded Auto setting. It should suit you to a P — as in, pro-
grammed exposure — and that’s where you can usually find this option on 
the mode dial. It’s an automated exposure system but, unlike Auto, the 
Program setting lets you fine-tune the exposure settings that it selects. Auto 
generally locks you out of most useful adjustments completely.
 
Program mode is smarter than Auto. Most dSLR cameras have a built-in 
database of tens of thousands of photos that have been analyzed and 
reduced to numbers that characterize their optimum exposures. In Program 
mode, your camera can look at the image in your viewfinder, compare it with 
this database, and come up with an image that probably is a pretty good 
match. It can then apply the exposure parameters to your picture.
For example, the camera decides that it has a landscape picture on its hands 
and attempts to maximize depth-of-field. Or, the camera determines that it’s 
working with a portrait and, therefore, less depth-of-field might be in order to 
concentrate sharpness on the face of the subject, while allowing the back-
ground to blur. The algorithms might dictate that high shutter speeds are 
needed to counter camera shake or subject motion, and the program 
switches to lower shutter speeds only when the camera deems the aperture 
too small for the correct exposure at the current speed.
 
Carried to the extreme, programmed exposures can include settings that are 
optimized only for a specific type of picture, such as portraits, night photog-
raphy, beach or snow photos, sports, or macro (close-up) photography. 
These Scene modes are useful when you want to take a particular kind of 
picture and want to inform the camera of what you’re doing, but don’t have 

97
 Chapter 5: Taking Control of Your dSLR
the time to set up the camera yourself. Scene modes can include more than 
exposure settings, too. They might adjust saturation to give you more vivid 
landscapes or decrease contrast to cope with bright snow scenes.
Figure 5-6 shows an image that benefited from the photographer using the 
Sports Scene mode. The default shutter speed selected by the camera pro-
duced a good exposure, with a shutter speed that stopped most of the action 
but still allowed a little blur, which prevented the picture from looking posed. 
(The photographer also could have used Shutter priority, which I discuss in 
the section “Getting your aperture and shutter priorities straight,” later in 
this chapter.)
Both Program and Scene modes are useful shortcuts for photographers in a 
hurry. However, most of the serious photographers I know use the options 
discussed in the following section — Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority, and 
Manual Exposure modes — almost exclusively.
Taking control
One of the joys of gaining expertise with your dSLR is knowing what’s best for 
a particular type of photo and making the necessary choices, even if you let 
the camera’s electronics do most of the work. That’s why digital SLR owners 
love Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority, and even Manual Exposure modes.
Here’s how to choose among them.
Figure 5-6: The Sports setting improved this action photo by freezing runner, third baseman, and the 
incoming ball, but with just enough blur remaining to add a feeling of motion.

Part II: Oh, Shoot! 
Getting your aperture and shutter priorities straight
Your camera doesn’t know you’re taking photographs of a soccer game, but 
you do. You know that you sometimes want to use 1/1,000 of a second to freeze 
the action, but other times, you’d prefer to use 1/125 of a second to introduce a 
little blur into the mix.
When you use Shutter Priority mode, usually represented by an S or Tv (for 
Time Value) on the mode dial, you get to choose the shutter speed. After you 
select the shutter speed, the camera locks it in. The auto-exposure system 
varies only the aperture.
You can see the selected aperture in the viewfinder so that you, the all-
knowing photographer, can decide when, say, the f-stop is getting a little too 
large for comfort and you want to accept a slower shutter speed to gain a 
smaller aperture. If light conditions change enough that your selected shutter 
speed doesn’t produce a correct exposure with the available f-stops, a LO 
or HI indicator in the viewfinder or, perhaps, a flashing light emitting diode 
(LED) alerts you.
Aperture Priority mode, represented by an A or Av (for Aperture Value) on the 
mode dial, is the flip-side of Shutter Priority mode. (Don’t confuse A with 
Auto, which is another setting entirely.) Perhaps you want a small aperture 
to maximize depth-of-field or a large f-stop to minimize it. It’s your choice. 
You set the aperture you want, and the metering system sets the matching 
shutter speed. Again, if you notice that the shutter speed is too slow or 
high, you can opt to adjust the f-stop that you’ve dialed in to one that’s larger 
or smaller.
Some cameras include an ISO Auto option that also can change the sensitivity 
(to a higher ISO setting) if the camera’s programming determines that the 
aperture you select doesn’t allow the camera to use a shutter speed fast 
enough to counter camera shake.
 
The Shutter and Aperture Priority modes let you use your photo smarts to 
set a basic parameter suitable for the photo that you have in mind, and then 
the camera takes over to intelligently make the other adjustments.
Doing exposure yourself
Sometimes, if you want something done right, you have to do it yourself. 
Manual Exposure mode allows you to set both the shutter speed and aper-
ture while using the camera’s built-in meter for guidance. After you switch 
to Manual mode, the dSLR doesn’t touch either setting, but it continues 
to evaluate the scene for the correct exposure and provide information in 
the viewfinder, which shows you that you’re over, under, or right on its 
recommendation.

99
 Chapter 5: Taking Control of Your dSLR
 
I’m no technological Luddite, but I did resist exposure automation for an 
interminable period. Why did I resist? Well, Manual Exposure mode has some 
distinct advantages:
 
✓ Special effects: Suppose that you want to create a silhouette effect, 
as in Figure 5-7, or underexpose a sunset to cloak your image in deep 
shadows. Maybe you want to overexpose a bit to wash out unwanted 
detail. Any automatic exposure mode stubbornly tries to correct for 
the lighting, effectively blocking you from applying your special effect. 
You can usually just switch to Manual Exposure mode and make the 
settings yourself much faster than trying to override your camera’s 
auto-exposure mechanism.
 
 
Figure 5-7: Manual settings let you use creative exposure for special 
 
effects, such as this silhouette at the Bastille in Paris.

100
Part II: Oh, Shoot! 
 
✓ Balancing lighting: You have a subject that’s illuminated by several 
different light sources — say, two or more studio lights or, outdoors, by 
sunshine and fill light from your flash or a reflector. Manual Exposure 
mode lets you control exactly how the camera sets exposure for these 
multiple light sources.
 
✓ Older optics: You might have an older lens that doesn’t couple with 
your dSLR’s auto-exposure system. In that case, setting the exposure 
manually might be your only option.
 
✓ Non-compatible flash: I use Manual Exposure mode quite frequently 
when I connect my dSLR to some studio flash units. The camera can’t 
control the flash, and it has no way of adjusting exposure automatically. 
So, I use a flash meter and set the f-stop manually. If you’re using a 
flash that isn’t built specifically for your dSLR, or you want to use the 
flash in Manual mode (say, to make sure that it always uses its full 
power), setting the exposure manually can work for you. Chapter 9 
covers working with flash in more detail.
Focus Pocus
Focusing your image correctly is arguably the most important technical 
aspect of taking pictures because even a small focus error might ruin an 
image beyond redemption. You can often correct exposure problems or 
fix bad color balance in an image editor. You might be able to fix clumsy 
framing with some judicious cropping. You can even retouch images to 
remove particularly ugly subject matter. But if an image is badly focused, 
you can sharpen it a little, but most likely not enough to bring a blurry shot 
back from the dead.
Oddly enough, focus is both a benefit and bane of the dSLR. Focus isn’t 
usually much of a worry for point-and-shoot photographers, except when 
taking close-up pictures. Nor is selective focus (placing parts of an image 
out of focus to emphasize other portions) much of a creative tool. The 
very short focal lengths required by the tiny sensors in those cameras put 
virtually everything in sharp focus, regardless of zoom position, f-stop, 
or distances (other than close-ups). Even a telephoto shot taken with a 
point-and-shoot camera’s lens wide open is likely to be sharp, all the way 
from a few feet to infinity.
But dSLRs and their lenses don’t necessarily have such extensive depth-of-
field. You can throw parts of your scene, such as the background in a portrait 
shot, out of focus to emphasize your subject. Unfortunately, you can also 
accidentally throw your subject out of focus if you aren’t careful, producing 
unintended results.
Digital SLRs offer two different ways of achieving focus: manual and auto-
matic. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages.

101
 Chapter 5: Taking Control of Your dSLR
Focusing manually
Manual focusing sounds easy, but it’s more difficult than it sounds. You 
just need to twist a ring on the front of the lens, and the image pops into 
sharp focus, right? If only it were that simple! Manual focus is, unfortunately, 
rather slow when compared to the automatic focus features of digital SLRs. 
It works well when you’re doing thoughtful work, such as macro (close-up) 
photography, where your subject sits there patiently while you fiddle 
with the camera (often locked down on a tripod) and focus until you get 
everything exactly right.
Manual focus isn’t so good when you’re photographing fast-moving sports or 
if you’re shooting in a rush for any reason. The big problem is that humans’ 
brains have a very poor memory for sharpness. You don’t really know for 
sure that you’ve achieved sharp focus until you pass it and your image starts 
to blur again. Then, you have to jog back and forth until you’re convinced the 
image is sharply focused. This jostling takes time, and you might not have 
that much time to waste.
Focusing an image becomes more difficult when your scene is dark or low in 
contrast — for both you and the camera’s autofocus mechanism. But at least 
when the camera’s doing the job, you don’t have to fret in frustration.
 
Still, manual focus might work for you in several situations:
 
✓ Zeroing in on one subject: When you want to focus on a particular 
object that the autofocus system doesn’t readily lock in on, focus 
manually. Perhaps you want to concentrate attention on the fleet fingers 
of the bass player, shown in Figure 5-8. You can aim most autofocus 
systems, but you might simply be able to do the focusing yourself more 
quickly.
 
✓ Shooting action pictures: Autofocus systems can work fast, but in some 
action situations, they might focus at lightning speed on the wrong 
subject. Sports photographers can sometimes use Manual mode to focus 
ahead of time where they know the action will be, dispensing with the 
uncertainty.
 
✓ Avoiding total confusion: Autofocus systems are totally confused by 
some kinds of situations, such as subjects posed against plain back-
grounds. For example, I find that when photographing seagulls in flight, I 
often have to focus manually unless I’m lucky enough to have a bird 
blunder into one of my camera’s autofocus zones.
 
✓ Photographing through glass: Sometimes, an autofocus system fixates 
on the glass itself, rather than the subject behind it, so you might need 
to focus manually.

102
Part II: Oh, Shoot! 
 
 
Figure 5-8: You might more easily focus on the bass player’s 
 
hand manually.
Oughta autofocus
Digital SLRs focus automatically by selecting the focus point at which the 
image contrast is highest. When a subject’s out of focus, it looks blurry and 
lower in contrast. When the subject’s in focus, the lack of blur translates into 
higher contrast that the focus system can see.
Of course, a low-contrast subject or one that’s poorly illuminated can give an 
autofocus system fits. (I recommend manual focus in such cases.) Sometimes, 
a focus assist lamp built into the camera or a dedicated flash unit can put a 
little light on the focus problem.

103
 Chapter 5: Taking Control of Your dSLR
One nagging problem with autofocus is how the system decides what to 
focus on. Most digital cameras have five to nine (or more) focus sensors 
grouped around the viewfinder screen, and the cameras evaluate the 
contrast of the image in each of them to select the zone on which to base 
focus. To gain a little more control over the focal point of a shot, you might 
have the following options:
 
✓ Switching zones manually: You might be able to switch from one zone 
to another manually by using your camera’s cursor pad or other control. 
You may find this technique useful if your subject isn’t smack in the 
center of the frame but still lies within one of the other focus zones. 
The zone you select is highlighted in the viewfinder and remains in that 
position until you move to another zone.
 
✓ Switching zones under camera control: If you don’t choose a focus 
zone yourself, your camera does it for you by using a scheme, such as 
dynamic focus area (the zone switches around when the camera detects 
subject motion) or nearest subject (the zone is locked into what the 
system determines is the closest object to the camera). You might be 
able to allow the autofocus system to set the focus point for you, yet still 
override its decision without resorting to full manual focus.
 
✓ Locking out focus ranges: You can also lock out certain focus ranges, 
such as extreme close-up or distant focus, so that your autofocus 
system doesn’t hunt over the full range when seeking correct focus.
 
Most of the time, you can let your camera focus for you, choosing among the 
three common primary focus modes:
 
✓ Continuous autofocus: After you press the shutter release halfway, the 
camera sets the focus but continues to look for movement within the 
frame. If the camera detects motion, the lens refocuses on the new 
position. Use this option for action photography or other subjects that 
are likely to be in motion. Remember that if your subject moves faster 
than the autofocus system can keep up, you might take an out-of-focus 
picture. Taking an out-of-focus picture isn’t as bad as it sounds, though: 
Sometimes, you’d rather capture a picture — any picture, even if it’s 
slightly out of focus — than miss the shot entirely.
 
✓ Single autofocus: Press the shutter release halfway to set focus. The 
focus remains at that setting until you take the photo or release the 
button. Use this mode for subject matter that isn’t likely to move after 
the camera brings it into sharp focus. However, you can’t take a photo at 
all until focus is locked in, so you end up either with a sharp photo or 
none at all.
 
✓ Automatic autofocus: Press the shutter release halfway to set focus, 
like in single autofocus. But, if the subject starts to move, the camera 
switches to continuous autofocus and refocuses as required. Use this 
mode when you’re not certain that your subject will remain stationary.

Mastering the Multi-Lens Reflex
In This Chapter

▶ Choosing prime lenses or zooms
▶ Understanding key lens concepts
▶ Using wide angles and telephotos creatively
I
n one sense, the term single lens reflex is a misnomer. Even in these days 
of 18mm-to-250mm lenses that cover the range from wide-angle to medium 
telephoto (or 50mm–500mm superzooms that extend from short telephoto 
to really, really long telephoto), few dSLR owners try to operate with only a 
single lens. In fact, buying extra optics for one of these cameras is more than 
a reflex — it’s a passion! Additional lenses are probably the most popular 
accessory for digital SLRs. They’re the single component that can 
provide the biggest boost to your photographic repertoire.
Of course, you probably know that the term SLR actu-
ally refers to a camera design; one that uses the same 
lens to take the picture as it uses for reflex viewing 
(viewing by reflection, using mirrors or a prism) — 
as opposed to a twin-lens reflex, which pairs two 
lenses of the same focal length for separate viewing 
and snapshooting. These days, however, dSLR 
owners are more likely to be single-minded about 
acquiring accessory lenses.
This chapter helps you choose which lenses to add to 
your collection, based on your needs — both real and 
imagined — and shows you how to use them effectively.

106
Part II: Oh, Shoot! 
Optical Delusions
Unless you happened to purchase a compact 12mm-to-400mm f/1.4 zoom 
lens with your dSLR (they don’t exist), you’re deluding yourself if you think 
you can’t use an accessory lens to improve your photography. Lenses 
don’t make you a better photographer, of course, but they do increase 
your opportunities and let you take pictures that you simply can’t grab 
with the lens that comes with your camera.
The following sections list some of the things that an accessory lens can do 
for you.
Shooting in low light
The do-everything zoom lenses furnished with dSLRs often have maximum 
apertures of f/3.5 to f/4.5. The entry-level Canon, Nikon, Sony, and Pentax 
models are all furnished in kit form with 18mm-to-55mm f/3.5-to-f/5.6 zooms 
(I’m sensing a trend here).
You can’t compare the focal-length ranges directly, of course, because 
these popularly priced dSLRs have different crop factors (which I describe in 
Chapter 2), ranging from 1.5X (for Nikon, Sony, and Pentax) to 2X (for the 
Olympus line). But you can compare maximum apertures, and f/3.5 or slower 
is common among every vendor’s starter lenses.
 
Although zooms that have large maximum apertures are expensive (and 
for a zoom lens, f/2.8 is a large maximum aperture), you can find fast fixed 
focal length (prime) lenses that cost very little. For example, a 50mm f/1.8 
lens from a major camera manufacturer may cost less than $100, even 
though it’s two f-stops faster than an f/3.5 lens and three stops better than 
an f/4.5 optic.
If you’re willing to spend a little more, you can buy 28mm, 35mm, 50mm, or 
85mm f/1.4 lenses from the larger lens companies and speedy third-party 
lenses, such as the Sigma 30mm f/1.4 and Sigma 20mm f/1.8. Those extra 
notches on the aperture ring let you take hand-held pictures in dark environ-
ments (especially when the camera or lens uses image stabilization, which I 
discuss in Chapter 7), as shown in Figure 6-1, without resorting to detail-
robbing high ISO ratings. An indoor concert that calls for a 1/15-second 
exposure at f/4 and ISO 100 may work just fine at 1/125 of a second at f/1.4.
The fastest lenses are generally designed to produce good results wide open, 
too, so you needn’t fear using f/1.4 with a prime lens, even though you get 
poor results with your zoom at f/4.5.

107
 Chapter 6: Mastering the Multi-Lens Reflex
Figure 6-1: Wider apertures allow you to shoot in dim light without mounting the camera on a tripod.
Improving your shutter speed
That wide aperture also pays dividends in the shutter-speed department. The 
difference between f/1.4 at 1/125 of a second and 1/15 of a second at f/4 can be quite 
dramatic from a sharpness perspective, as you can discover in Chapter 5. You 
can find out more about making the most of slow shutter speeds by using 
image stabilization technology in Chapter 7.
Producing sharper images
You may be able to get sharper images by switching lenses, too. That’s not to 
say that the lens you purchased with your camera is unsharp. However, your 
do-all lens is built on a foundation of compromises that don’t necessarily 
produce the best results at all zoom positions and all apertures. Other lenses 
that you add to your collection may provide better results at specific focal 
lengths or f-stops. For example, that 50mm f/1.8 lens that you pick up for less 
than a single Benjamin just might be the sharpest lens you own. Or you might 
buy a close-up lens that’s optimized for macro photography and produces 
especially sharp images at distances of a few inches or so.
 
Your current lens is probably very good, but that doesn’t mean you can’t get 
sharper pictures with another set of optics, particularly when you’re swap-
ping a general-purpose zoom lens for a fixed focal length prime lens designed 
for exactly the kind of photo project that you’re working on at the moment.

Part II: Oh, Shoot! 
Taking a step back
Wide-angle lenses let you take in a wide field 
of view — in effect, stepping back from your 
subject, even in situations where you really 
don’t have room to move farther away. The 
lens that you bought with your camera likely 
provides a field of view no wider than that of 
a 28mm lens on a full-frame film SLR, which 
really isn’t very wide. You can get some very 
interesting perspectives by using ultra-wide 
lenses, including the 10.5mm fish-eye view 
provided by one Nikkor lens, particularly 
because Nikon offers a utility that can defish 
the curved image to produce a more rectilin-
ear (straight line) version. Your particular 
dSLR may have wide angles available with 
the equivalent of a superwide 18mm lens or 
better. Third-party vendors also offer some 
interesting wide-angle choices, such as the 
Sigma 10mm-to-20mm f/4-to-f/5.6 optic that 
offers the equivalent of a 15mm-to-30mm 
zoom on a dSLR that has a 1.5X crop factor. 
I’ve had a great deal of fun with a Tokina fish-
eye zoom lens (used for Figure 6-2), which allows you to choose your degree 
of distortion over a 10mm-to-17mm range.
 
If you’ve been lusting after longer and longer lenses, I can understand — 
particularly if you shoot wildlife or sports. But, if you haven’t worked extensively 
with wide-angle lenses, I urge you to give 
them a try. It’s a whole new world.
Getting closer
The inverse of a wide-angle lens is the 
telephoto lens, and the telephoto lens’s 
long focal lengths let you bring distant 
objects much closer to your camera. The 
lens that came with your camera proba-
bly provides only a moderate telephoto 
effect, perhaps around 70mm, which 
with a 1.5 crop factor, is the equivalent 
of a 105mm short tele-lens on a full-frame 
35mm film camera.
You can easily find long lenses, and they 
usually don’t cost much, simply because 
telephoto prime lenses and telephoto 
Figure 6-2: Extreme wide-angle 
lenses, such as the fish-eye used for 
this shot, provide a new perspective.
Figure 6-3: Bring wildlife up close — if 
you have a long-enough telephoto lens.

109
 Chapter 6: Mastering the Multi-Lens Reflex
zooms are generally simpler to design than their tricky wide-angle counterparts. 
You can find 70mm-to-300mm zooms for many dSLRs for only a few hundred 
dollars. You can find prime lenses for even less. I picked up an ancient non-
automatic (focus, exposure, and aperture) 400mm lens for about $79 that I use 
for great wildlife shooting, as shown in Figure 6-3, especially if I can mount the 
camera or lens on a tripod.
Focusing closer
 
Your optional lens may be able to focus much more closely than the lens 
that came with your camera, making it a macro lens. If you’re new to close-up 
photography, you’ll soon find that the magnification of the image is more impor-
tant than the close-focusing distance.
You can get the same size image with a 200mm lens at 8 inches as you get 
with a 50mm lens at 2 inches, and you may even be better off with the 200mm 
lens. The closer you get, the harder it may be to get good lighting on your 
subject. You simply don’t have a lot of room to apply effective lighting when 
you have a gap of only a couple inches between the front of the lens and that 
tree frog you’re snapping. Worse, the tree frog may get skittish at the proxim-
ity of your camera and you, making that 200mm lens and the extra distance it 
provides an even better idea.
Choosing Your Prime Lens — or Zoom
In the olden days, photographers used only fixed focal length prime lenses 
most of the time. Zoom lenses were slow, often expensive, and had limited 
zoom ranges. In the 1960s and 1970s, photographers used zoom lenses only 
when they absolutely couldn’t swap lenses to get the focal lengths they 
needed, and even then, they were more likely to tote around three or four 
camera bodies, each mounted with a prime lens of a different focal length. 
Zooms could do special tricks, such as the infamous zoom-during-exposure 
effect. In 1966, Nikon introduced one of the first decent zooms that had a 
practical zoom range and acceptable sharpness, a 50mm-to-300mm f/4.5 that 
seems fairly tame today, but which was revolutionary and horrendously 
expensive at the time.
Today, zooms are sharper, smaller, faster, and less expensive. The 28mm-to-
200mm zoom that I have mounted on my dSLR right now costs around $300, 
measures about 2.7 x 2.8 inches, weighs 13 ounces, and focuses down to 1.3 
feet at 200mm. It’s truly an all-purpose lens. You can find other zooms that 
meet your needs or, perhaps, fill out your arsenal with a few prime lenses.

110
Part II: Oh, Shoot! 
Prime time
As I note in the preceding section, prime lenses can be faster (both in aperture 
and autofocusing speed), sharper, and much lighter in weight than zoom 
lenses. If you’re looking for the ultimate in image quality, a good prime lens 
or two may be exactly what you want. In all cases in the following list, when 
referring to recommended focal lengths, I use the actual focal length, but I 
assume that your camera has about a 1.5X crop factor. That number works 
for the majority of consumer-priced dSLRs on the market, and isn’t too far off 
for those cameras that have 1.3X to 1.6X crop factors. Here’s a list of some 
common applications and the prime lenses that you might find especially 
suitable for them:
 
✓ Architecture: Wide-angle lenses in the 12mm-to-28mm range (depending 
on how much of the wide view your system’s crop factor clips off). Most 
of the time, you’re shooting with a relatively small aperture to gain depth-
of-field, so an f/2 or f/1.4 maximum aperture isn’t as important, even when 
shooting indoors under low light levels. A tripod serves you better. If you 
shoot a great deal of architecture, you can purchase a perspective control 
lens that compensates for the falling-back effect that results when you tilt 
the camera back to capture the upper reaches of a tall structure. You can 
find out more about perspective problems in Chapter 10.
 
✓ Indoor sports: You want a lens that has a 
moderately wide angle of roughly 30mm focal 
length for indoor sports, such as basketball or 
volleyball, as well as long lenses for shooting 
from up in the stands. You can use large aper-
tures for available-light sports, but only if you 
can focus or pre-focus carefully on a single 
subject or two because depth-of-field is lim-
ited, as you can see in Figure 6-4. Autofocus 
may not accurately focus exactly where you 
need to when using a very large aperture.
 
✓ Outdoor sports: Longer lenses are useful, and 
primes in telephoto focal lengths often offer 
an excellent combination of reach and speed. 
You’ll find 100mm-to-200mm lenses, or longer, 
great for capturing football, baseball, soccer, 
and other outdoor sports. Apertures of f/2.8 
to f/4 let you use faster shutter speeds to 
freeze the action (again, assuming that you or 
your camera’s autofocus system make the 
most of the available depth-of-field).
 
✓ Portraits: If you’re taking head-and-shoulders 
shots, a 50mm-to-70mm prime lens offers the 
same flattering perspective as the traditional 75mm-to-105mm portrait 
lenses used with 35mm full-frame cameras (with a 1.5X crop factor on 
Figure 6-4: When shooting 
indoor sports, focus carefully 
because you don’t get much 
depth-of-field at wide 
apertures.

111
 Chapter 6: Mastering the Multi-Lens Reflex
the dSLR). Such prime lenses usually come with f/1.8 or faster maximum 
apertures, which you can use to limit depth-of-field when you want to 
concentrate on your portrait subject’s face. Longer focal lengths can 
produce a flattening effect on the features, and shorter focal lengths can 
make ears look too small while enlarging noses if you use those focal 
lengths up close.
 
✓ Macro photography: Prime lenses, such as the ever-popular 50mm f/1.8, 
although not intended for close-up work, can still do a great job. You 
may have to purchase extension tubes or other accessories to focus 
close enough to fill the frame with very small subjects.
 
✓ Landscapes: Wide-angle primes (12mm–24mm) can give you landscape 
photos that are sharp enough to blow up to 16 x 20 inches or larger, 
making framed pictures to grace your walls.
 
Of course, the only problem with using prime lenses is that you must be willing 
to swap lenses whenever you decide to shoot something else or need a different 
perspective that you can’t get by stepping closer or farther away. Digital SLRs 
have one additional consideration: If you’re working in a dusty environment, 
you may not want to change lenses a lot because each time you take off a 
lens, you let some dirt invade the camera body and, possibly, end up on the 
sensor. You can read more about sensors and dust in Chapter 2.
Zoom, zoom, zoom
Zooms are good, too. Honest. I may be a little biased because most of my 
lenses have always been primes, with only a lone zoom that I didn’t use 
much. Today, I do most of my work by using 12mm-to-24mm, 28mm-to-70mm, 
28mm-to-200mm, and 170mm-to-500mm zooms, so you can see that I’m no 
optical Luddite. But I still get a lot of use from my new 60mm and 105mm 
macro lenses, as well as older prime lenses that I own, including a 16mm 
fish-eye that functions as a quirky 24mm lens that has a heck of a lot of barrel 
distortion (even after the crop factor has trimmed the image). I also regularly 
use my prime 50mm f/1.4, 85mm f/1.8, 105mm f/2.5, and 200mm f/4 lenses 
when I want a little extra sharpness or aperture speed.
But those kinds of applications are in the distinct minority. I rely on zooms 
most of the time. Consider these different broad categories of zooms:
 
✓ Wide angle: These are designed strictly for wide-angle perspectives, 
and, if designed for digital SLRs, may include ranges such as 10mm to 
20mm or 12mm to 24mm. You can find wide-angle lenses originally cre-
ated for full-frame 35mm cameras, too, that have ranges such as 17mm 
to 35mm. On a camera that has a crop factor, such lenses are actually 
close to wide-to-normal in range, but they likely produce very sharp 
images (and sometimes cost quite a bit). Before purchasing a wide zoom 
for your dSLR, you might want to check it out carefully because the 
widest of the wide often have serious distortion and aberrations.

112
Part II: Oh, Shoot! 
 
✓ Mid-range: The lens furnished with your camera is likely a mid-range 
zoom that has a focal length at the wide end of about 17mm to 18mm, 
extending out to 55mm to 70mm at the telephoto end. Such lenses are not 
very fast but reasonable in cost. You can also find some upscale versions 
in the same focal lengths that have greater sharpness and larger maxi-
mum apertures. These lenses were usually designed for finicky full-frame 
35mm film camera users. They may be worth the extra expenditure 
because they often have a fixed maximum aperture throughout the zoom 
range, meaning a 17mm-to-55mm f/2.8 lens has a constant f/2.8 aperture 
and doesn’t vary between, say, f/2.8 at the wide-angle position and f/4 at 
the telephoto position, which commonly happens with less expensive 
models (such as the one that came with your camera).
 
✓ Short tele to telephoto: These lenses may start out at 50mm to 70mm 
and extend out to 200mm to 300mm or more. One vendor’s 50mm-to-
500mm zoom is especially popular because it provides such a huge 
range of focal lengths in one lens. Of course, it’s also possibly the largest 
and heaviest 50mm lens on the planet, so you want to own such a beast 
only if you plan on actually needing its 10X zoom reach.
 
✓ Telephoto: These lenses start long and go longer. My 170mm-to-500mm 
zoom falls into this category and can really reach out and touch someone, 
as shown in Figure 6-5. You can also find 200mm-to-400mm zooms or even 
longer lenses from various vendors. Like with any lens of more than about 
200mm, seriously consider using these optics either with the camera 
mounted on a tripod or, better yet, with the lens attached to the tripod 
using a special collar that has a tripod socket. Many long lenses are sold 
with such removable collars.

with a long lens, such as the 170mm-to-500mm zoom used to capture

113
 Chapter 6: Mastering the Multi-Lens Reflex
 
✓ Macro: Several vendors offer lenses that have zoom ranges in the 
medium telephoto range (out to about 200mm) that also offer macro 
focusing. Wildlife photographers who photograph big beasts and 
small find these lenses especially useful.
Special (lens) delivery
I touch on special-purpose lenses in this chapter and describe them in more 
detail in other chapters in this book. Just to make things neat and tidy, I list the 
special kinds of lenses you may encounter (or want to acquire). They include
 
✓ Optical image stabilization: I discuss image stabilization in Chapter 7; 
these lenses counter camera or photographer shake by shifting lens 
elements around just before exposure. They give you the power to shoot 
at shutter speeds about 4 times as long without producing camera-
induced blur. Sony, Olympus, and Pentax build the anti-shake feature 
into the camera itself, so, with only a couple exceptions, you can use 
image stabilization with all your lenses.
 
✓ Perspective control: These optics shift to provide improved perspective 
when you photograph buildings or other subjects that converge in the 
distance.
 
✓ Macro: Prime or zoom lenses designed especially for close-up photo-
graphy, offering extended focusing; better sharpness; and often, 
extra-small apertures (such as f/32 or f/45) to maximize depth-of-field.
 
✓ Focus control portrait: Nikon offers a series of DC lenses that have 
defocus control, which lets you adjust how the out-of-focus background 
appears in portraits or similar kinds of single-subject pictures.
 
✓ UV: If you’re a scientist photographing subjects by using ultraviolet 
(UV) light, you probably want to scrounge around for one of these rare, 
expensive optics that don’t filter out UV in the same way that lenses 
built of conventional glass elements do.
Lens Concepts
Ideally, lenses used on dSLRs should be designed to meet the special 
needs of digital cameras. But that’s not always possible. Most digital SLRs 
use lenses that were originally designed for film cameras, which might not 
work as well on a digital camera. Some vendors, such as Pentax, Nikon, and 
Olympus, offer lenses that work exclusively with their digital cameras. That’s 
a better solution, in my book.

114
Part II: Oh, Shoot! 
 
Sensors aren’t what engineers might describe as plug compatible with film. 
You can’t rip out the film transport mechanism and substitute a digital 
sensor and expect the same results (even though that’s exactly how some of 
the original dSLRs were designed).
Different strokes
Sensors for many dSLRs are smaller than film frames, introducing the infamous 
crop factor that I’m forced to drag into about half the shooting discussions in 
this book. Only part of the image formed by a lens designed for a full frame 
sensor is captured by a sensor that’s smaller than 24mm x 36mm (like most 
dSLR sensors today are). The crop factor may be 1.3, 1.5, 1.6, or even 2.0 times. 
This crop factor can be (seemingly) good for telephoto pictures, but it doesn’t 
create such a great effect if you really wanted a wide-angle view. A 100mm lens 
may have the field of view of a 150mm lens, but a 20mm super-wide-angle lens 
ends up with the viewpoint of a mundane 30mm lens.
Because the image uses only a smaller portion of the lens coverage area, the 
smaller sensor crops the edges and corners of the image, where aberrations 
and other defects traditionally hide. You just might be using the best part of 
your lens if it was originally designed for a film camera.
Of course, vendors are producing lenses designed expressly for smaller 
sensors, which means that their reduced coverage area must be extraordi-
narily even in terms of sharpness and light distribution.
But wait, there’s more! Sensors don’t respond to light the same way that film 
does. Film grains absorb light in roughly the same manner, regardless of its 
angle of approach to the film surface. A sensor’s photosites, on the other 
hand, are little pixel-nabbing wells that collect photons best when they drop 
directly into the bucket, instead of coming in from a steep angle. When you 
use lenses designed for film on a dSLR, some of the light can hit the side of 
the well or spill over into adjacent pixels. Unwanted patterns and light fall-off 
can result, along with flare that happens when photons bounce off the shiny 
sensor surface, hit the equally shiny rear lens elements, and then reflect back 
onto the sensor. Ugh!
Although camera and lens designers have found ways to counter these 
problems with equipment designed expressly for digital photography, optics 
created for film cameras might not produce the same uniformly good results. 
Image quality can vary from lens to lens, based on how well the design meets 
the needs of digital imaging.
 
A camera that has an image cropped by the camera’s small sensor gives you 
more telephoto reach than simply cutting the center out of a full-frame image 
because of pixel density. A 12MP crop-factor camera and a 12MP full-frame 
camera have the same number of pixels, but the cropped camera packs them 

115
 Chapter 6: Mastering the Multi-Lens Reflex
all more densely into the area of a smaller sensor. Put a 500mm lens on a 
12MP camera with a 1.5x crop factor, and all 12 megapixels give you the 
equivalent field-of-view of a 750mm lens on a full-frame camera. When you 
mount that same lens on a full-frame camera, such as the 12MP Nikon D700, 
cropping out the center portion yields the same field of view, but only 5 
megapixels-worth of the full-frame camera’s less dense pixels are used to 
form the image. The camera with the 1.5x crop factor gives you an image that 
has more resolution and sharpness.
Going for bokeh
Obsessing over the quality of the out-of-focus areas of an image that a lens 
produces (the lens’s so-called bokeh) has become a subspecialty fixation of 
its own in recent years. Some lenses are prized for their wonderful bokeh, 
whereas others are reviled because their bokeh stinks. You can find endless 
discussion of this topic in the photographic forums online. So, what does it 
all mean?
The word boke means “blur” in Japanese, I’m told. English speakers insisted 
on rhyming it with “broke,” so the silent “h” was added to the Western 
spelling of the term to help ensure that the language-challenged among us 
would properly pronounce it to rhyme with “polka.”
 
Bokeh describes the points of light in the background that become fuzzy 
disks when rendered out of focus by inadequate depth-of-field. Various lenses 
render these disks in different ways. Some create uniformly illuminated disks. 
Others generate disks that are dark in the center and lighter at the edges, 
which make them stand out like a sore thumb — or, actually, a frosted dough-
nut. When you have the reverse effect, a nicely illuminated center that fades 
to a darker edge, the disks tend to blend into each other, which gives you the 
ideal representation. Lenses that have the very best bokeh characteristics 
display almost no disk shapes at all.
If you shoot close-ups, portraits, or long telephoto shots that have out-of-focus 
backgrounds, very carefully examine the bokeh characteristics of any lens 
that you’re considering. You might not even be aware of the deleterious 
effects of bad bokeh (except when you use a so-called mirror or catadioptric 
telephoto lens, which generates the mother of all doughnuts around each 
point of light). But you eventually notice that some out-of-focus backgrounds 
are more harmonious than others or, in the worst case, your bokeh-aware 
photographer friends make fun of you. Figure 6-6 shows examples of both 
good and bad bokeh.

116
Part II: Oh, Shoot! 
 
 
Figure 6-6: When bokeh goes bad (like at left), out-of-focus points of light 
 
produce obvious disks that are darker in the center than at the edges. 
 
With good bokeh, the points blend together to produce a smooth out-of-
 
focus background (right).
Using Lenses Creatively
You need to know more about working with a lens than simply adjusting to 
its greater or lesser field of view. A wide-angle lens is much more than just a 
wider perspective, in the same way that a telephoto lens has a lot more going 
for it than the ability to pull objects closer to your camera. The following 
sections show you some of the things that you need to know to work with 
wide-angle and telephoto lenses creatively.
Creative use of wide angles
Wide-angle lenses have some special characteristics that can hold some special 
pitfalls you want to avoid, but those characteristics offer some creative 
advantages if you use them properly.
 
You can use those wide-angle-lens qualities in your photography in 
these ways:
 
✓ Increase depth-of-field. Sometimes, you want what cinematographers 
call deep focus. Akira Kurosawa was a master of the technique of having 
both subjects very close to the camera as well as those that are more 
distant all in sharp focus. You can do it, too. At any given aperture, wide-
angle lenses provide more depth-of-field than a telephoto lens, allowing 
you to picture a larger range of subject matter without distracting 
blurriness of objects in the foreground, background, or both.
 
✓ Emphasize the foreground. If you want to put extra emphasis on sub-
jects in the foreground, such as a lake or meadow, while de-emphasizing 
the mountains in the background, use a wide-angle lens.

117
 Chapter 6: Mastering the Multi-Lens Reflex
 
✓ Distort the foreground. Although wide-angle lenses tend to exaggerate 
the size of objects closest to the lens, you can effectively use this 
form of perspective distortion to create an interesting viewpoint in 
your picture.
 
✓ Add a unique angle. When you get down low and shoot up with a wide 
angle, you can creatively use the combination of perspective distortion 
and the unusual angle, as shown in Figure 6-7. The same is true when 
shooting down from high angles.
 
✓ Use slow shutter speeds. Although 
telephoto lenses magnify camera 
shake, wide-angle lenses tend to 
minimize it. If you can hand-hold 
your camera with a normal lens (or 
zoom setting) at 1/60 of a second, you 
just might be able to pull off 1/30-
second exposures, or longer, with a 
wide-angle lens.
 
✓ Show more stuff. Indoors or 
outdoors in tight quarters, you can 
show more of your scene by using a 
wide-angle lens. You can fit most of 
a building or all of a room in the 
picture, but you can also use this 
expansive view when photographing 
people in their environment.
 
Don’t be lulled by the creative opportuni-
ties that wide angles offer. Here are some 
pitfalls to avoid:
 
✓ Avoid skewed horizontal and 
vertical lines. Watch those horizons 
and the vertical lines of buildings so 
that they don’t look skewed in your 
photos. Keep the camera level as 
much as possible.
 
✓ Watch proportions. Because wide 
angles exaggerate the relative size of 
objects that are close to the camera, you can end up with weird propor-
tions in your photos. You don’t want your spouse’s nose to appear twice 
its normal size (even button noses don’t benefit from optical plastic 
surgery), so keep the possibilities of distortion in mind when framing 
your photos.
Figure 6-7: Shooting from a low angle with 
a wide-angle lens is a dual-edged sword. 
The perspective is interesting, but you run 
the danger of having tall structures appear 
to be falling backward.

118
Part II: Oh, Shoot! 
 
✓ Don’t let lens defects ruin your photos. Wide-angle lenses may distort 
an image, changing the shape of vertical and horizontal lines at the 
edges of the photo. Or such lenses may have chromatic aberrations that 
add purple or cyan glows around backlit subjects.
 
✓ Avoid vignetting. Filters, lens hoods, and other add-ons may actually 
intrude into the picture area when you use wide-angle lenses. Use thin 
filters, avoid stacking too many of them together, and use only lens 
hoods designed for a particular lens.
 
✓ Watch that flash. Your digital SLR’s built-in electronic flash might not 
spread wide enough to cover the full frame of a wide-angle lens. Use a 
diffuser or wide-angle adapter over your flash. Some dedicated flash 
units actually zoom their coverage to match your lens’ zoom position. 
Also, make sure that your lens or lens hood doesn’t cast a shadow when 
you shoot close-up subjects with flash.
Creative use of telephotos
Telephoto lenses have their own set of creative strengths and dangerous 
pitfalls. Keep these tempting applications in mind when working with longer 
lenses and tele-zooms:
 
✓ Compression: Telephoto lenses compress the apparent distance 
between objects, making that row of fence posts look like each post is 
only a foot or two distant from the next. Movie-makers use this effect all 
the time to make it look like the hero is bravely racing between speeding 
cars while crossing the street, when actually none of the vehicles come 
closer to him than 5 or 10 feet.
 
✓ Isolation: The reduced depth-of-field of tele-lenses let you apply selec-
tive focus when you want to isolate your subjects from the foreground 
or background.
 
✓ Sports action: A telephoto lens brings you into the middle of the huddle, 
right in the center of the action around the goal, and a lot closer than 
you ever wanted to get to the periphery of a scrum.
 
✓ Nature’s bounty: A telephoto can take you closer to your photographic 
prey, including animals of all shapes and sizes, while letting you stay 
far enough away that you don’t become prey yourself, as shown in 
Figure 6-8.
 
✓ Macro photos: You might not need a macro lens to shoot macro photos. 
You may only need a telephoto lens that has enough reach and focuses 
reasonably close.

119
 Chapter 6: Mastering the Multi-Lens Reflex
 
 
Figure 6-8: Don’t get too close! Use a telephoto lens and live 
 
to shoot another day.
 
Telephoto lenses don’t have an unusual number of pitfalls, but be aware of 
them, nevertheless. Here are the crucial things to watch out for:
 
✓ Flash coverage: Like wide-angle lenses, telephotos have some potential 
problems with electronic flash coverage, except that the problem is 
depth, rather than width. The electronic flash built into most dSLRs isn’t 
powerful enough to reach more than 10 to 20 feet, so if you’re photo-
graphing a running back who’s 50 feet away, you end up with a very 
underexposed photo. If you do a lot of sports photography, you might 
want to consider buying a powerful external flash that can provide the 
extra light you need.
 
✓ Too-slow shutter speeds: Because longer lenses magnify the shakiness 
of lightweight cameras or lightweight photographers, use a shutter 
speed that’s high enough to counter the vibration. If you can’t use a 
higher shutter speed, use a tripod or monopod.
 
✓ Reduced depth-of-field: Telephotos have less depth-of-field at a given 
aperture. If you need the maximum amount of depth-of-field, use a small 
f-stop.
 
✓ Atmospheric conditions: Even when smog doesn’t fill the sky, the air is 
full of enough haze or fog to reduce the contrast of your long telephoto 
shots enough to affect your pictures. Although digital sensors don’t 
“see” much UV, sometimes a skylight or haze filter can help, or you can 
boost the contrast and color saturation in your camera or image editor.
 
✓ Flare: Telephoto lenses have a narrow field of view, so bright light 
outside your image area can easily affect your image with flare, which 
reduces contrast. Use your lens hood without fail.

veryone loves watching movies on DVD more than on videotape, 
premium cable, or maybe even in a theater. Why? Because of those 
special features! It’s a kick to press a button and hear the director’s 
commentary, watch hilarious outtakes, or listen to Ben Stiller and Owen 
Wilson banter in French or Japanese. Okay, maybe a minority like the 
image quality that DVD provides, but for me, special features 
are the attraction.
The special features built into your digital SLR are even 
cooler. These functions come built into some dSLRs, 
but not all. They let you do some very interesting 
things, such as take pictures in virtual darkness or 
shoot the unfolding of flowers through time-lapse 
photography.
This chapter describes what you can do with some 
of these special features. No movie stars are chat-
tering in a foreign language among these options, but 
if you have your heart set on gibberish, your dSLR 
probably has a setting for switching your menus to any 
language you like. While you’re looking for that setting, I’ll 
explore some of the more useful features of digital cameras.

122
Part II: Oh, Shoot! 
Feel the Noize at Night
All digital SLRs can take fine pictures at night, but some do a better job than 
others, thanks to special features built into them to handle long exposures 
and noise (or, as Quiet Riot and Slade fans call it, noize). The following 
sections describe the key components that you need to work with so that 
your night shots are sparklingly clear.
A fast lens . . . or not?
As you can discover in Chapter 6, a lens that has a large maximum aperture 
(generally, anything faster than f/2.8) is a must only if you’re hand-holding 
(that is, shooting without a tripod) your night photos or, perhaps, if you 
want to shoot with flash and need your speedlight’s illumination to reach as 
far as possible. An f/2 or f/1.4 lens might let you take some night pictures at 
1/30 of a second hand-held or, with image stabilization (which I discuss in 
the section “Shake, Shake, Shake,” later in this chapter), at slightly slower 
shutter speeds.
 
The more sane shooters take night photographs with the camera securely 
mounted on a tripod so that you can use virtually any lens at any desired 
f-stop and still get a clear photo. Correct exposure in such cases is simply a 
matter of using a sufficiently long shutter speed. That said, using a long shutter 
speed isn’t always an option, as I discuss in the following section.
Taking night shots at short shutter speeds
You might want to avoid very long shutter speeds and prefer the shorter 
shutter intervals a higher sensitivity (higher ISO setting) affords for any 
number of valid reasons:
 
✓ Perhaps you don’t want to spend 30 seconds or more making a single 
exposure because of time constraints or physical conditions (rain, 
muggers, an episode of Desperate Housewives that you don’t want to 
miss, and so forth).
 
✓ You might want to take as many photos as possible in available 
darkness.
 
✓ You want to avoid the light streaks from moving cars or other 
illuminated objects that a long exposure likely produces.

123
 Chapter 7: Special Features of dSLRs
Bumping up the ISO can let you take your night photos with a reasonably 
short exposure. Some dSLRs have ISO settings no higher than ISO 1600, but 
others go up to ISO 3200, or as much as ISO 25600! A few cameras top out 
at a specific ISO notch but include push settings that have names such as H1 
or H2, which elevate the effective sensitivity a notch or two more. You can 
use these settings in a pinch, but expect some quality loss when you do. You 
can also adjust your camera’s exposure value (EV) compensation controls to 
underexpose an image (effectively providing a higher ISO setting) and then 
try to salvage the photo in your image editor.
 
Of course, high ISO settings tend to amplify non-image signals in an image, 
producing extra noise. Your camera’s noise reduction feature can cut down 
on the annoying speckles that appear at those high ISO settings. See the 
following section for more about using noise reduction.
Noise Reduction Made Easy
Consider using noise reduction anytime you take photos at night using long 
exposures or high sensitivity settings because the objectionable texture 
overlays unprocessed images.
Noise comes from several sources. One might be the amplification of the 
weak signal that the sensor produces under low light conditions. The sensor 
itself also produces noise while it inevitably heats up during a long exposure, 
and the sensor mistakes some of that heat for incoming photons. Some 
digital cameras exhibit an amp glow or amp noise phenomenon, which is a 
reddish or purple glow in the corners and edges of very long exposure 
images (usually several minutes or more) caused not by heat, but by electro-
luminescence of electrons in the readout amplifier of the camera’s sensor. 
You don’t need to be a rocket scientist to understand that; the actual 
specialty you need is astronomy (astronomers experience amp glow when 
they take astro-photographs).
The bottom line is that your camera’s sensor can generate noise at high ISOs 
with exposures of any length and at relatively low ISO settings with long 
exposures.
To cancel some of those noisy speckles, digital SLRs include internal noise 
reduction circuitry. This circuitry works by making two exposures: an actual 
picture of your subject, and a blank or dark exposure for the same length of 
time. This second picture contains only noise of the same type that appears 

124
Part II: Oh, Shoot! 
in the real picture. The camera’s 
noise reduction circuitry compares 
the two and zaps the pixels that are 
common to both (the noise). This 
solution is along the order of the 
sculptor who starts with a block of 
marble and removes everything that 
doesn’t look like a statue.
Figure 7-1 shows two versions of an 
image taken in the early evening, 
using a relatively short exposure (1/4 
of a second), but with the ISO setting 
cranked up all the way to ISO 1600. 
The upper version includes a lot of 
noise. (The upper version is actually 
a little exaggerated to make it visible 
on the printed page.) The lower ver-
sion is the same shot, but it has 
noise reduction applied. You can see 
the quite dramatic difference.
 
Because the noise reduction 
feature works by taking two shots, 
any photos that you take with the 
noise reduction feature turned on 
take twice as long. You scarcely notice the delay with shutter speeds of 
about 1 second or shorter, but when you’re snapping off 30-second expo-
sures, you definitely notice the extra half-minute pause during this dark-
frame-subtraction process. If you’re in a hurry or forget to switch on the 
noise reduction, you can also perform some post-shot noise reduction by 
using an image editor, such as Photoshop (as shown in Figure 7-2), or with 
a third-party application, such as Neat Image (www.neatimage.com) or 
Noise Ninja (www.picturecode.com).
The Reduce Noise filter in Photoshop and Photoshop Elements lets you 
control the strength of the noise reduction, how much detail you want to pre-
serve, whether you want to eliminate color noise, and how much sharpening 
of the remaining detail you want to apply. The Adobe Camera Raw plug-in 
supplied with both programs also includes noise reduction features that you 
can apply to RAW files. For an introduction to image editors and image edit-
ing, see Chapters 11 and 12.
Figure 7-1: The upper version badly needs 
noise reduction. You can see the results in the 
lower version.

Shake, Shake, Shake
Whenever photographers get together, one of the inevitable topics of conver-
sation is each shooter’s prowess at hand-holding a camera for incredibly long 
exposures. Oddly enough, these same photographers might swear by an 
emerging camera-steadying technology known as image stabilization.
“I get razor-sharp images at 1/30 of a second, even with telephoto lenses!” one 
boasts. “I can squeeze off shots at 1/4 of a second with no problem!” another 
counters. “I have a special technique for bracing my arms that lets me take 
time exposures of up to 2 seconds without a tripod!” a third asserts, leaving 
the others to wonder whether he’s joking or just filled with braggadocio.
No matter how experienced a photographer you are, and whether you apply 
arcane breath-control and body-steadying practices to your techniques, you 
only think you’re steady enough to shoot long exposures with short lenses, 
and reasonably long exposures with telephotos.
In the sections that follow, you can find out some of the common myths 
about camera shake, identify the point where you really need to switch from 
hand-held shots to a tripod, diagnose shake-related problems in your photos, 
and discover ways to fix those problems.

126
Part II: Oh, Shoot! 
Leaving camera-shake myths behind
In camera-shake lore, you might have come across two misleading 
assumptions:
 
✓ If you don’t see the shake, it isn’t there. The slowest shutter speed at 
which you think you can reliably shoot sharp images is probably the 
speed at which you can’t detect the blurriness that appears at normal 
levels of enlargement. Crop a small section out of the center or make a 
huge enlargement, and you can probably see the difference. You can 
likely make a surprising number of your shots sharper if you use a 
tripod.
 
✓ Use a shutter speed that’s the reciprocal of the lens’s focal length. 
For example, 1/250 of a second with a 250mm lens. This advice is more 
of a rough guideline than a rule because it doesn’t take into account the 
crop factor that some dSLRs produce. Your 250mm lens is effectively 
a 400mm lens if your camera has a 1.6X crop factor. No, you’re not 
multiplying the focal length of the lens (as I emphasize over and over), 
but you are filling the frame with less subject area, magnifying any 
camera shake, just like if you made an 8-x-10-inch print rather than a 
4-x-6-inch print.
 
 Some people are shakier than others, so a 1/400 of a second shutter speed 
that one photographer can use successfully might be woefully inade-
quate for another photographer. To figure out the point where you 
personally need to switch from hand-held shots to using a tripod, see 
the following section.
It goes without saying, of course, that this discussion deals with blurriness 
caused only by camera/photographer shake. Blurs derived from moving 
objects is another issue entirely — although you can fix them, too, by using 
higher shutter speeds.
Testing for tremors
 
Before looking at the latest technological cure for shaky hands, try this 
exercise to see just how bad you have the “affliction.” (If you’ve inherited, 
as I have, a mild case of essential tremor condition, you can remove the 
quotation marks.) Follow these steps:
 
1. Find a scene that contains sharp pinpoints of light, preferably at night 
so that you have a dark background, such as a scene with streetlights.
 
2. Switch your camera to Manual mode so that you can vary both the 
shutter speed and f-stop independently.

127
 Chapter 7: Special Features of dSLRs
 
3. Take several pictures at a fixed f-stop but vary the shutter speed for 
each picture.
 
 Use various shutter speeds that you think are test-worthy. For example, 
1/60, 1/30, 1/15, or 1/8 of a second.
 
4. Calculate your exposure by using your digital camera’s metering system.
 
 You don’t need the exposure to be precise, as long as you vary only the 
shutter speed during the tests. If you change f-stop or focus, you can 
change the size of the points of light, although the greatest effect 
appears on any out-of-focus points.
 
 If you’re shooting over a great range, change the ISO setting of your 
camera so that you can maintain the same aperture while varying the 
shutter speed.
 
5. Open your shots in your image editor and examine the camera shake 
by enlarging the light points enough that you can study their shape.
 
 The appearance of the round disks of light in your images let you judge 
fairly accurately how steadily you held the camera during the tests:
 
• If the disks are perfectly round: Like the red stoplights at right in 
Figure 7-3. You used a shutter speed that’s fast enough to stop 
action at that focal length.
 
 Keep in mind that if you zoom in to a longer focal length, you 
need a higher shutter speed. Telephotos magnify the effects of 
camera shake.
 
 
Figure 7-3: The stoplights and other round sources of illumination are sharp; the shutter speed 
 
used for this photo was fast enough to stop camera shake.

128
Part II: Oh, Shoot! 
 
• If the disks are elongated vertically: You shook the camera up or 
down (or both) when taking the picture.
 
• If the disks are elongated in a diagonal direction (usually a diagonal 
pointing from upper-left to lower-right): You jerked the camera, prob-
ably by punching the shutter release button too aggressively. Why 
that particular direction? You tend to press down and to the right, 
not the other way around. But remember, your sensor records an 
image upside-down, so the direction of any camera movement is 
reversed.
 
• If the disks are elongated from side to side: Your camera shake 
formed some panning-style blur. Again, the direction of the blur is 
reversed, so if you jerked the camera slightly to the left, the blur 
appears to the right in your final image.
 
• If you’re really shaking, you might find the blurs create a streaky pat-
tern: Like the one shown in Figure 7-4. That shutter speed is way 
too low for hand-held exposures.
Figure 7-4: Really streaky photos mean that you need a much faster shutter speed if you want to hand-hold 
your camera.

129
 Chapter 7: Special Features of dSLRs
Everyday solutions for shakiness
 
After you determine your minimum practical shutter speed for hand-holding 
(keeping in mind that this speed can vary because of lens focal length and 
other factors), you can attempt to sharpen your photos. To cease the shakes, 
try using
 
✓ Higher shutter speeds
 
✓ Better shooting ergonomics (meaning brace yourself)
 
✓ Aids, such as tripods, monopods, or beanbags (see Chapter 4)
 
✓ Image stabilization
Image stabilization: The ready-steady-shoot 
technology
Anti-vibration technology has gained a lot of attention because several of the 
most popular low-priced cameras from Olympus, Sony, Panasonic, and 
Pentax/Samsung include the feature right in the camera body, so you can 
now get this technology in modestly priced entry-level cameras.
Leave it to the techno-wonks to come up with stunning new technologies just 
because they can. Camera-steadying technology has been around since 1976 
in the motion picture industry, when the Steadicam was introduced. This 
device produces gyroscope-like stability through an exquisite application of 
gimbaling and balance. By 1995, Canon had introduced an electronic form 
of image stabilization (IS), which Nikon, Sony, and Pentax/Samsung now 
offer, and you can find others under names such as Vibration Reduction or 
Anti-Shake.
Nikon and Canon build IS into indi-
vidual lenses; Sony, Pentax/Samsung, 
and Olympus (the only other 
vendors offering the technology 
for digital SLRs) incorporate image 
stabilization into the cameras. They 
all operate by using similar princi-
ples: The device (the lens or camera) 
senses motion and then shifts 
components (which are elements 
of either the lens or the sensor) 
in the opposite direction(s) to 
compensate. You can turn off the 
vibration reduction feature when 
you don’t need it. You can see an 
anti-shake on/off switch in the 
lower-right corner of Figure 7-5.
Figure 7-5: Turn off anti-shake technology 
when you don’t need it.

130
Part II: Oh, Shoot! 
 
The mechanics of image stabilization work very quickly, although not quickly 
enough to avoid slowing down camera operation a tad. So, you can best 
use IS to counter camera shake when you’re taking pictures of relatively 
slow-moving subjects, when you’re using longer exposures, or for shooting 
with telephoto lenses without a tripod. Although many photographers use 
IS for sports photography, you may find the small delays it introduces 
annoying — the dSLR equivalent of shutter lag.
IS allows you to hand-hold your camera at shutter speeds roughly four times 
longer than you could manage without image stabilization. If you can hold 
your camera steady at 1/60 of a second, you can get the same results with IS at 
1/15 of a second. Those extra two stops of exposure might mean the difference 
between not being able to take the picture at all and getting a well-exposed 
shot at a decent aperture.
The following scenarios offer a close-up look at how image stabilization 
works in different circumstances:
 
✓ You’re shooting a poorly lit subject and you need an exposure of 1/60 of 
a second at f/2. Oops! Your zoom lens has a maximum aperture of f/5.6. 
With image stabilization cranked up, you can go ahead and shoot at the 
equivalent exposure of 1/15 of a second at f/5.6 and expect the same 
amount of sharpness, from a camera-steadiness perspective.
 
 Of course, if your subject is moving too much for capture at a slow 
shutter speed, that’s another story. I took photos of my son’s high 
school stage performance by using the 1/15 of a second and f/5.6 
combination. I ended up capturing razor-sharp scenery, but I often lost 
the expressive hands, arms, and mouths of the actors in blur!
 
✓ You’re using long lenses and shutter speeds that are high, but not 
quite high enough. For example, you’re shooting wildlife (or even 
sports, if you can put up with the slight delay). In this case, IS can offer 
extra steadiness to compensate for the shake that long lenses can 
introduce. For example, you might find that shooting at 1/500 of a second 
at f/16 and ISO 400 with a 500mm lens is correct from an exposure stand-
point, but your front-heavy lens causes enough wobble to blur photos, 
even at that shutter speed. By using IS, you can retain the 1/500-second 
shutter speed and the depth-of-field provided by the f/16 aperture, but 
with enough steadiness to make your image tack sharp. Figure 7-6 shows 
a pair of images shot with a 400mm lens at 1/200 of a second, both with 
and without image stabilization. Tracking this bird in flight made holding 
the camera steady difficult at 1/200 of a second (top), but I got a sharp 
image of the same bird a few minutes later at the same speed with image 
stabilization turned on (bottom).

Figure 7-6: Image stabilization made it possible to shoot this bird hand-held 
 
with a long lens.
Time Waits for Someone: Creating 
Time-Lapse Sequences
Walt Disney didn’t invent time-lapse photography, but some of the most 
memorable nature sequences ever filmed were early Disney films of flowers 
blossoming or the sun marching across the sky in the Painted Desert. Today, 
time-lapse imaging is so easy that people use it for transitions and segues in 
television shows. Just set up a motion picture or video camera, pop off a 
frame every minute or hour or day, project the sequence at the normal 24 or 
30 frames per second (fps), and you have a time-lapse movie.
Your digital SLR can easily produce the same kind of sequences. You can 
snap off pictures at preset intervals to document a flower opening, a butterfly 
emerging from its chrysalis, or the construction project across the street. 
You just need a willingness to tie up your camera for the necessary period of 
time and some means of tripping the shutter at the proper times. Of course, 
you can trip the shutter manually, if you have the patience.

132
Part II: Oh, Shoot! 
 
Some non-SLR digital cameras have built-in timers that trip the shutter for 
you. When people use digital SLRs to shoot time-lapse sequences, however, 
they usually tether the camera to a computer by using a USB cable and 
allow computer software to take the exposures. This method makes sense 
for several reasons:
 
✓ Time-lapse photography uses a lot of juice. Consequently, you want 
to keep the camera close to a computer and an AC power source. If 
your sequence takes more than an hour or two, your camera’s battery 
probably can’t supply the power that the camera needs to take the 
photos. So, connect your camera to an AC adapter that’s plugged into 
the same power that keeps the attached computer running.
 
✓ Long sequences tax your camera’s internal storage. If you want to 
use the maximum resolution that your dSLR offers, a single memory 
card might fill up before the camera finishes your sequence. Systems 
that tether the camera to a computer save the images directly onto the 
computer’s hard drive.
 
✓ Computer-driven time-lapse photography can be more sophisticated. 
Most of the software programs used for this kind of work can auto-
matically assemble your finished shots into a movie.
Today, though, you do have some options beyond the tethered-camera 
setup. For example, if you can outfit your camera with an Eye-Fi wireless SD 
card, you can transmit images directly from the camera to your notebook or 
desktop computer network without using a USB tether. Some vendors make 
self-timer/time-lapse cables that you can set up to make exposures over a 
period of time without any computer intervention. (These cables are often 
fairly expensive, with some units in the $150 range.) However, time-lapse 
photography still takes a lot of juice, so still connect your camera to AC 
power during a long sequence. Experiment with time-lapse photos to see 
your world from an entirely different perspective. It’s fun!
Better Infrared than Dead
Feel like your creativity is on its last legs? Looking for a real challenge? Do a 
little research and see whether your particular dSLR can handle one of the 
unexplored frontiers of digital photography — infrared imaging. It’s dark 
territory (quite literally — you have to shoot blind).
Infrared (IR) photos have a particular, other-worldly look. Skies are dark, 
clouds stand out in sharp relief, and foliage appears ghostly white, as you can 
see in Figure 7-7. Human faces are pale and lack texture. The pictures are 
grainy and sometimes seem to glow with an inner light. You either love or 
hate these effects after you take the time to explore them for yourself.

133
 Chapter 7: Special Features of dSLRs
Some digital SLRs are better suited 
to IR photography than others. Most 
models include an IR-blocking filter 
called a hot mirror that filters out 
most of the longer wavelengths of 
light, which encompass the infrared 
band. As luck would have it, digital 
sensors are quite sensitive to 
infrared, but that sensitivity leads 
to poor photographs in visible 
light. Thus, cameras come with an 
IR-blocking filter.
Luckily for photographers interested 
in infrared imaging, some of these 
filters do a worse job than others in 
blocking the IR illumination. Your 
own dSLR might be one of those 
capable of taking infrared pictures. 
You can quickly tell whether your 
camera can take infrared pictures by 
pointing a remote control at your 
lens and snapping a picture in a dark 
room while you press a button on 
the remote. If you can see the glow of 
the remote control’s IR burst in the 
image, you’re in business.
 
In addition to the hot mirror, watch for infrared blockers on your lens, too. 
A few lenses from Canon and other vendors have an anti-IR coating that 
can produce a bright spot in the center of your IR image. If you have 
this problem, switch to a different lens or try to correct the spot in your 
image editor.
To start taking infrared photos, you just need an IR filter and some patience:
 
✓ The filter blocks visible light but lets infrared light though. Don’t 
confuse this infrared filter with the hot mirror.
 
✓ Patience is essential because even the most IR-worthy dSLRs still filter 
out most of the infrared light. Enough infrared light remains to take a 
picture, but you have to use long exposures for best results. I’ve taken 
IR photos at 1/30 of a second with my lens wide open and ISO set to 1600, 
but those pictures were fuzzy and lacked depth-of-field.
Figure 7-7: Infrared images look other-worldly.

134
Part II: Oh, Shoot! 
 
✓ For better results, use normal ISO settings and mount your camera on 
a tripod. The tripod helps because you’re shooting blind. Any IR filter 
that you use removes virtually all visible light, so the view through your 
viewfinder is totally black. If your camera has Live View, you may be 
able to discern an image on the LCD, but don’t count on it.
In Chapter 15, you can find details about choosing a filter and steps that walk 
you through taking infrared photos.
Dust Off
Another feature found in most dSLRs these days is a built-in automatic 
dust removal system (as opposed to the non-built-in manual dust removal 
procedures that I outline in Chapter 4). These systems often work like the 
system found in the Olympus, Pentax/Samsung, and Sony: The same sensor-
shifting technology used to provide anti-shake features produces a little 
vibration (usually when you have the camera turned off) that bounces any 
dust or other particles on the sensor off the filter that covers the sensor 
and onto a flypaper-like sticky strip at the bottom of the chamber. Cameras 
from Canon and Nikon that don’t have in-camera image stabilization use a 
sensor-shaking mechanism.

composition is, too.
Chapter 8 explains the fuss over formats and

action and fl ash photography — because the two 
often work hand-in-hand. In Chapter 10, you can 
discover how to arrange all the elements in your 
photo in pleasing ways by using compositional 
rules that were meant to be broken (after you 
understand exactly how they work).

Working with RAW and 
Other Formats
In This Chapter
▶ Discovering all those formats
▶ Understanding dSLR format options
▶ Choosing the right file format
▶ Using RAW as a digital negative
You can find many bones of contention in the digital SLR world, but 
the choice of file format is one of the boniest. Some photographers 
swear by RAW, a misnamed “unprocessed” format (RAW isn’t really 
unprocessed) that supposedly retains all the information the 
sensor captures (it doesn’t). Others scoff at RAW, feeling 
that the JPEG format is the key to taking pictures most 
efficiently, with a minimum of after-shot processing 
required. Old-school photographers might insist that 
the TIFF format is the only way to go, despite the 
fact that few digital SLRs even support that format 
these days.
This chapter removes the mystery surrounding 
RAW and other formats, and helps you choose 
which one is right for you in any particular situa-
tion. Should you shoot RAW, JPEG, or both at the 
same time? In this chapter, I explain what you need to 
know to make that call.

138
Part III: Beyond the Basics 
So Many Formats, So Little Time
The proliferation of file formats started with image-editing software. Dozens 
of different schemes exist for saving image files, and most of the leading 
image editors are forced to support just about all of them.
Unfortunately, digital cameras brought back the revenge of the format 
proliferators, and it helps to get the lay of the land before you venture out 
to do what should be so simple: Choose a format for saving an image.
Virtually all digital SLRs today support JPEG because that format lets you 
squeeze more images onto memory cards that have limited amounts of 
space. A few (chiefly high-end) dSLRs also let you capture images in TIFF 
format, which is great at retaining detail but not so great at compressing 
photos to a reasonable size. All dSLRs have the option for saving images 
in a proprietary RAW format that supposedly preserves all the image detail 
and parameters that the sensor captures.
But that claim isn’t precisely true. The sensor data is processed quite 
thoroughly by algorithms that convert the image from analog to digital form. 
However, the resulting RAW data doesn’t have all the settings that you dialed 
into your camera (white balance, sharpening, color, and so forth) set in 
concrete. When you import a RAW file into your image editor, you can go 
ahead and use those settings, if you like, or — by using the RAW converter 
software that does the conversion — you can specify new parameters, 
instead. That’s where the “unprocessed” label gets hung on RAW files.
What!? Am I telling you that each digital camera vendor uses a different RAW 
format? If only it were that simple! As it turns out, some camera makers have 
created several different versions of their RAW format, each incompatible in 
some way with earlier versions, so rather than a dozen RAW variations, you 
have to deal with several dozen. Here are a few examples:
 
✓ The different RAW formats for Canon dSLRs include CRW and CR2.
 
✓ Nikon has some slightly different variations of its format, including 
a trick it unveiled a few years ago of encrypting the white balance 
information of its newest cameras so that third-party RAW tools can’t 
interpret it. (After much consternation and reverse engineering by 
other vendors, Nikon ended up demystifying its encryption scheme.)
 
✓ Other vendors might use one RAW format for their dSLRs and another 
for their high-end point-and-shoot models.
This mess was Adobe’s cue to get into the act, producing yet another format, 
DNG (digital negative), which purports to support all the features of all 
the other RAW versions, as a sort of standard. Adobe even provides a free 
Digital Negative Converter, shown in Figure 8-1, if you want to change all your 

139
 Chapter 8: Working with RAW and Other Formats
current RAW files to the new format. 
To date, only one vendor, Pentax, 
allows you to choose whether to 
save your images in the camera by 
using either Pentax’s proprietary 
RAW format or Adobe’s DNG.
Things get even more interesting 
when you realize that no one has cre-
ated a standard for naming the for-
mats used within digital SLR 
cameras. Instead, the cameras use 
names such as Fine, Basic, Superfine, 
Good, Supergood, and so forth, pro-
viding no real clue about which 
format you’re actually choosing. The 
Superfine option might represent 
TIFF on one camera and JPEG with 
minimal image loss on another. 
Choosing the right format is difficult, 
but the following sections help clear 
things up.
Figure 8-1: Adobe’s free Digital Negative 
Converter transforms your current RAW files 
into the Adobe DNG format.
 
Along came a proprietary format
Did you know that Photoshop gives you the 
option to save your images in almost two dozen 
different formats right out of the box? Do you 
know what RLE or PXR or TGA formats are, or 
what applications create or need them? Or why 
these formats exist at all?
I’m sure each of the various file formats must 
have seemed like a good idea at the time. The 
ostensible reason for creating a particular 
format is that the software vendor wanted to 
add special features (such as the layers in the 
Photoshop PSD format) that weren’t possible in 
other formats. Presto! A new file format is born 
that includes support for the new feature.
Of course, back in the Dark Ages of computing, 
another reason for creating a proprietary format 
existed: It tied buyers to the particular applica-
tion that relied on that particular format. If you 
liked PixelPaint (I’m not making the name up; it 
was a Macintosh program that flourished in the 
early 1990s), you used the PixelPaint format — 
and after you accumulated a few thousand 
images in that format, you were pretty well 
locked into that program . . . until a new, spiffier 
application came along, offering support for the 
PixelPaint format and negating the advantages 
of the proprietary feature.
Before long, most of the non-compatible 
formats fell into disuse (although they remain as 
shadowy wraiths in many Save As menus). 
Virtually all image editors support the Photoshop 
PSD format, plus JPEG (created to provide 
extra-small file sizes), and TIFF (the closest 
thing to a standard high-quality format that isn’t 
tied to one vendor). Image editors still have their 
own proprietary formats, but users of those 
programs are more likely to archive processed 
images as PSD or TIFF.

140
Part III: Beyond the Basics 
Worth the Fuss: Understanding the Main Formats
I ignore the file formats used only within image editors and for applications 
outside the realm of digital cameras, such as Web pages. These formats 
include GIF, PNG, PICT, PDF, and BMP. Nice formats. Not relevant. B-b-b-bye!
 
When you’re trying to decide what format to shoot with, you need to look at 
only TIFF, JPEG, and RAW because digital cameras work with only those 
formats (other than some Pentax models that can save in DNG format). Each 
of these formats has its advantages and disadvantages, and that’s what you 
really need to know about to make a wise selection.
Don’t get TIFFed
The TIFF format originated in 1987 with a company called Aldus, which 
developed pioneering graphics and layout programs such as Freehand and 
PageMaker. Intended as a standard file format for images, TIFF (Tagged Image 
File Format) incorporates descriptors called tags, which you can use to pro-
vide parameters for any special features included in the file. Theoretically, 
an application could include any kind of information it liked in a TIFF file — 
such as layers, objects, special color information, and selections — and tell 
any other application attempting to read that TIFF file how to retrieve the 
special data.
In practice, the TIFF format’s versatility ends up making it possible to create 
“standard” files that not all the applications that have to work with them can 
read, which isn’t an advantage at all. TIFF files run the gamut (ha!) from RGB 
(red, green, blue), CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black), and L*a*b color 
models to black-and-white and grayscale images. It supports both 24-bit 
and 48-bit (high dynamic range) color depths, and it can be squeezed down 
without losing any picture information by using optional Huffman encoding, 
LZW, or PackBits. (If you don’t know what some of these formats are, con-
sider yourself lucky; they aren’t important for day-to-day shooting.) Adobe 
acquired Aldus in 1994, and today, Adobe offers options for saving 
Photoshop layers and selections right in a TIFF file.
To make things even more interesting, some of the RAW formats that I 
discuss in the section “The RAW deal,” later in this chapter, are actually TIFF 
files that have some headers which transform them from standard TIFF into 
a vendor-specific format that requires special software to read.
 
Keep in mind these two important TIFF-file facts:
 
✓ TIFF files are lossless. They don’t discard any of your image 
information.

141
 Chapter 8: Working with RAW and Other Formats
 
✓ TIFF files are much larger than JPEG and RAW files. The larger size 
can increase the time it takes for your camera to store them on a memory 
card. In my tests, files that take only a few seconds to write to a 
memory card in RAW format can take 20 seconds or more as TIFF files.
The third most important thing to keep in mind is that fewer dSLRs offer a 
TIFF option these days; most that do are professional-level cameras, such as 
the Nikon D3, as shown in Figure 8-2.
JPEG o’ my heart
Virtually every dSLR currently on 
the market can create JPEG (Joint 
Photographic Experts Group) files. 
About 15 years ago, a consortium of 
the same name created this format. 
(The consortium originally consisted 
mostly of vendors such as Eastman 
Kodak Company, but an interna-
tional standards body now oversees 
it.) The goal of devising the JPEG 
format was to create files that are 
significantly smaller than you can 
produce by using formats such 
as TIFF, which compresses files 
somewhat without discarding image 
information, and to make those files 
readable by a wide variety of applications in a standard way.
The first JPEG-capable applications reduced the time needed to transmit 
images by telecommunications links. The Internet wasn’t in wide use by the 
public at that time. So, newspaper photographers had to plug their unwieldy 
portable computers (laptops of that era needed several laps to support 
them) into devices called modems to beam their photographs back to the 
editorial office over telephone lines. I am not making that up.
JPEG can reduce files by a factor of 20 or more by throwing away some of your 
hard-won image data in a series of processes that are intended to reduce the 
size of the file by eliminating excess or redundant information.
 
JPEG compression first divides your image into luminance (brightness) 
values and chrominance (color) information, on the theory that human eyes 
are less fussy about color than they are about brightness. (If you see a stop 
sign that’s a slightly odd shade of red, you notice that color less than if the 
Figure 8-2: Pro-level dSLRs still offer TIFF file 
options, as shown in this camera menu.

142
Part III: Beyond the Basics 
same sign appeared darker or lighter than you expect.) The excess color 
information is discarded.
The process slices your image into cells, say 8 x 8 pixels on a side, and then 
the process looks at each of the 64 pixels in the resulting chunk individually. 
Using mathematical trickery called Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT), 
the compression process discards pixels that have the same value as the 
pixels around them. (You don’t have to remember terms such as Discrete 
Cosine Transformation unless you’re trying to impress someone at a party.) 
Next, quantization occurs, during which pixels that are nearly the same color 
are converted to a common hue, and the picture information that’s left is 
transformed into a series of numbers, which is more compact than the origi-
nal information. (It’s a bit like writing 1500 rather than one thousand five hun-
dred.) If everything is done properly, the process compresses the image by 5 
to 20 times or more, depending on what compression level you select when 
you choose to save the file.
 
Because JPEG doesn’t keep all the 
image information, it’s referred to as 
a lossy format. Each time you load a 
JPEG image, make changes, and then 
save it again, you run the danger of 
losing a noticeable amount of infor-
mation because the JPEG process 
occurs all over again — every time 
you save. The loss might be very 
slight at first, but it can accumulate, 
as you see in Figure 8-3, which shows 
a photograph that has lost sharpness 
after repeated savings in JPEG format.
What’s cool about JPEG is that you 
can dial in the amount of compres-
sion you want, using a lot of com-
pression to produce very small file sizes (with an attendant loss in quality) or 
very little compression to preserve quality at the cost of larger files. What’s 
not cool is that no one has come up with a standard way of referring to the 
amount of compression. Digital cameras tend to use discrete steps with 
names such as Superfine, Fine, Normal, Good, and Basic. Image editors might 
let you choose a continuous compression/quality range from, say, 0 to 15 
or 0 to 20. (The Nigel Tufnel in you might wish that your editors offered an 
all-the-way-to-21 setting for when you need just that little bit of extra quality, 
but unfortunately, the designers of these applications apparently have never 
seen the movie This Is Spinal Tap.)
Instead, in-camera JPEG compression is a little like a box of chocolates: You 
never know what you’re going to get.
Figure 8-3: Repeatedly saving JPEG images 
can introduce artifacts into your photos.

143
 Chapter 8: Working with RAW and Other Formats
The RAW deal
RAW isn’t really a single file format. It’s the broad term applied to all the 
proprietary formats created by each digital camera vendor for its particular 
product line. Every RAW format is different, which means that in order to 
access a RAW file, you must have one of two types of programs:
 
✓ Special software from your vendor designed especially for its 
RAW format
 
✓ A third-party utility, such as Adobe Camera RAW (furnished with 
Photoshop and Photoshop Elements), that’s compatible with your 
particular camera’s RAW format
 
Not all utilities support all RAW formats (not even the Adobe DNG converter), 
so you might have somewhat limited choices for reading these files. Support 
for a particular version of RAW commonly lags behind the introduction of the 
camera that produces it for a few weeks or months, leaving you at the mercy 
of the camera vendor’s utilities until everyone else plays catch-up.
You can consider RAW files your digital negatives because they haven’t 
been subjected to the usual manipulations that your camera settings 
mandate when the camera converts the raw image data to JPEG or TIFF. 
(See the section “Using RAW Files as Digital Negatives,” later in this chapter, 
for more details.)
Choosing a File Format
So, your image-format choices boil down to TIFF, RAW, and JPEG (or, with 
some cameras, saving in RAW and JPEG simultaneously). Which do you 
select? Your decision might hinge on how you shoot and on what you plan to 
do with your files after you transfer them to your computer. Your available 
storage space might also figure into the equation.
 
If you get good results most of the time by using your camera settings, don’t 
want to do a lot of processing in your image editor, and take a lot of pictures, 
you might opt for TIFF or JPEG. TIFF gets the nod if you want the best image 
quality (although, as I note in the section “Don’t get TIFFed,” earlier in this 
chapter, digital SLRs rarely offer TIFF as an option these days), but you might 
prefer JPEG if you’re on a trip and want to make your memory cards stretch 
as far as possible. You might find that RAW works best if you plan to do a lot 
of image tweaking. The following sections explore these options in a little 
more detail.

144
Part III: Beyond the Basics 
TIFF enuff
If your camera has a TIFF option, here are some factors to consider:
 
✓ Highest quality: Use TIFF if you want the highest-quality image in a 
standard file format. This lossless format produces image files that are 
theoretically and practically better than even the least compressed 
JPEG image. The most common use for TIFF is for stock photography or 
advertising, where the client demands images taken as TIFF files. I think 
the clients are a bit behind the times, but those who write the checks 
make the rules.
 
✓ Minimal post-processing: TIFF is theoretically a good choice when 
you’re generating large numbers of images for distribution and want to 
apply a minimum of post-processing. Perhaps you’re shooting a wedding 
or other event and don’t want to laboriously apply individualized set-
tings to each photo with your image editor. If you carefully select your 
camera settings so that your TIFF files already have the exposure, color 
balance, sharpness, and other attributes that you want to end up with, 
you can safely save your files in TIFF format and expect all or most of 
them to be good to go right out of the box. In practice, however, most 
photographers use JPEG in this situation because the camera can store 
the images on its flash memory more quickly.
 
✓ Limited editing: TIFF is fine for images that you plan to manipulate in 
Photoshop to make improvements that don’t involve “unprocessed” 
RAW file attributes. For example, if you want to retouch portraits so that 
you can minimize facial flaws or composite several images into one, you 
really don’t need to work from RAW images. TIFF serves just as well.
 
✓ Too slow for sports: TIFF might not be the best choice if you’re shooting 
sports or doing continuous shooting because your dSLR takes a long 
time to save such files to your memory card. Most digital SLRs store 
JPEG and even RAW files much more quickly than they do TIFFs.
 
✓ Takes a lot of memory: TIFF is a poor choice if you have limited 
memory-card space. If you’re on vacation and have only a few 1GB 
cards to use between opportunities to offload your images, TIFF 
files fill up the available media with alarming speed. (Your camera’s 
best JPEG setting produces image quality that’s almost as good while 
consuming perhaps 10 percent of the storage space.)
JPEG junkies unite!
JPEG is a highly popular alternative to TIFF (if your camera even offers TIFF 
as an option) and RAW. Some JPEG junkies use nothing else for their original 
photos. The format is compatible with virtually all applications, making it as 
much of a standard as TIFF and much more compatible than RAW formats.

145
 Chapter 8: Working with RAW and Other Formats
Of course, JPEG has that nagging loss-of-quality issue. You have to decide 
for yourself how important that issue is to you. Ponder these points when 
considering JPEG:
 
✓ Really minimizes post-processing: Everything I say about TIFF as an 
option when large numbers of images are involved goes double for JPEG. 
I don’t know a single wedding photographer who prefers to shoot and 
work with RAW images, simply because they can’t afford to spend that 
much time post-processing hundreds of images. I don’t shoot weddings 
anymore, but I do photograph sports, and I often fire off 1,000 to 1,200 
shots at a single game (blame my dSLR’s five-frames-per-second burst 
mode for that). I spend a little time before the contest shooting test 
pictures and adjusting my color balance, sharpness, and exposure to 
suit the conditions. Then, I blast away, knowing that most of my photos 
will require little or no post-processing.
 
✓ Gives you ready-made photos for Web display: JPEG is a good choice 
for display on Web pages, such as the one shown in Figure 8-4. Or, if you 
want to distribute pictures in digital albums on CDs, in online albums, 
or as prints no larger than 11 x 14 inches, the least-compressed JPEG 
option that your dSLR offers should produce files that can easily take 
care of these tasks.
 
 
Figure 8-4: You can use JPEG files for Web display without having to 
 
alter them.

146
Part III: Beyond the Basics 
 
✓ Good-enough quality: If you do end up editing JPEG files, you probably find 
the quality good enough, as long as you remember to save your final ver-
sion as a TIFF or Photoshop PSD file. Always save your JPEG files in one of 
those lossless formats after you make changes. By saving in one of those 
lossless formats, you avoid the quality loss that can result from repeatedly 
opening and editing JPEG files (just opening and closing such files, without 
making any changes, causes no quality loss). If you still need a JPEG file 
(say, for display on a Web page), create one and retain your new TIFF or 
PSD versions, in case the image requires more editing later on.
 
✓ More compatible with software: JPEG can be more compatible with 
some image-management/album-making software than other formats. 
The ancient application that I prefer (which predates the term digital 
asset management by about ten years) doesn’t handle RAW files at 
all, so I always catalog a JPEG version of the file that my camera pro-
duces at the same time as the RAW file. (See the section “JPEG+RAW,” 
later in this chapter.)
 
✓ Writes to memory faster: Your digital SLR probably can write JPEG files 
to your memory card faster than any other type of file. This speed might 
not matter if you’re taking only a couple pictures at a time; the photos 
first go into the camera’s high-speed memory buffer, which sucks 
up JPEG, TIFF, and RAW at similar speeds. However, writing these 
images to the memory card takes longer, and after the buffer fills, you 
can’t take any more photos until some shots make their way out of 
the camera’s internal memory onto the card. I’ve used dSLRs that 
are so fast at writing JPEG files to a high-speed 133X-300X (or faster) 
CompactFlash card that I can take sequence photos almost continuously 
for a dozen shots or more.
 
✓ Takes less room on cards: You can fit a lot more JPEG files on a memory 
card of a particular size. A 2GB card can store about 600 photos 
snapped with a 6-megapixel camera if you use the typical JPEG Fine 
setting, nearly 1,200 photos at a representative medium-quality setting, 
and as many as 2,200 shots at the highest compression setting. Only 
360 RAW shots from the same camera might fill a 2GB card. My old 
10-megapixel camera can fit 488 RAW images on an 8GB CompactFlash 
card, or more than 900 JPEG Fine images.
 
 I don’t usually recommend using card storage space as a criterion for 
choosing which file format to use. You can simply purchase enough 
memory cards, instead. However, in some situations (such as vaca-
tions), you have limited storage, and using the JPEG format (particularly 
the highest-quality setting) makes a good compromise.
JPEG+RAW
Most digital SLRs include an option to save a pair of files every time a picture 
is taken: one as a JPEG file and a second in the RAW format. Many cameras, 
including modestly priced models from Nikon and Canon, let you select the 

147
 Chapter 8: Working with RAW and Other Formats
quality level for the JPEG version, so you choose between a high-quality JPEG 
and one that’s more compressed and lower in quality. Other cameras have a 
fixed JPEG quality level for the supplemental file; often, the version that has 
the highest compression ratio sets the quality level.
 
Saving JPEG+RAW is a valuable capability. It lets you shoot JPEGs for cata-
loging, reviewing, and using in less-demanding applications (such as small 
prints, online auctions, and Web display), while retaining RAW versions as 
digital negatives in case you need to do more extensive tweaking. Generally, 
the image pairs share filenames (only the file extension is different), so it’s 
easy to match them up.
The storage-card space penalty is fairly low. Even a 12-megapixel dSLR can 
save 198 RAW shots per 4GB card, and 132 JPEG Fine+RAW image pairs. It’s 
truly a case of getting the best of both worlds. I use this mode by default.
Working RAW
Save in RAW format if you frequently need to fine-tune your images. RAW lets 
you make changes to settings that normally you apply in the camera, either 
to individual files or batches of them. For example, if you take a whole series 
of shots under a particular lighting setup and save them as RAW files, then 
later decide on a single group of settings to apply to all of them, you can do 
that quickly with one batch process. Also, you can manipulate individual 
photos to your heart’s content.
RAW in the raw
People often describe RAW files as “unpro-
cessed” image files that contain all the informa-
tion captured by the sensor. That’s nonsense!
As I explain in Chapter 2, the sensor catches 
photons in little analog buckets (setting aside the 
wave/particle duality of light, as well I should!). 
The data collected is manipulated by your cam-
era’s digital signal processor, a special chip that 
converts the analog information into digital 
format. At the same time, the Bayer-filtered 
image data that mimics separate red-, green-, 
and blue-sensitive pixels is interpolated to create 
three different color channels of 12 to 16 bits 
each. That’s a lot of processing right there!
All that preprocessing can have a significant 
impact on the quality of your image, and that’s 
before your camera settings are applied. You 
can’t do a whole lot to RAW files to reverse 
the changes. But RAW does let you apply — 
after taking the photo — those settings that you 
normally make in the camera (such as white 
balance, sharpness improvements, color satu-
ration, and to an extent, exposure). If you used 
a too-slow shutter speed and you have a blurry 
photo, you can’t fix that. If you had a too-large 
f-stop and your photo doesn’t have adequate 
depth-of-field, you can’t fix that, either. You can 
apply a little sharpening, which might help 
somewhat in either case, but you have no way 
to undo serious errors that you made when you 
snapped the photo.

148
Part III: Beyond the Basics 
Using RAW Files as Digital Negatives
The more you shoot, the more you realize that it’s always a good idea to 
have that (relatively) unprocessed image as a sort of digital negative that you 
can go back to at any time to work with anew. These files can be a treasure 
trove of images that may prove invaluable at a later time, whether or not you 
think so now.
Salvaging images from RAW files
 
However adept you may be presently, your image-editing skills will improve. 
With an image saved in RAW format, you can salvage images that weren’t 
usable before you gained new capabilities. Pictures that you didn’t think you 
had any use for might turn out to be worthwhile with the passage of time.
For example, take the photo shown in Figure 8-5, which I sometimes use as an 
example of how you can take photos in dim light without a tripod if you have 
a lens with a large maximum aperture. It’s true that the original photo was 
taken at dusk, and the camera wasn’t mounted on a tripod. It was taken with 
a fast lens, too, exactly as described. However, as they say, here’s the rest of 
the story. (You don’t always need to have the patience of Ansel Adams to 
take landscape photos.)
Figure 8-5: This picture wasn’t carefully composed. It was a grab shot produced from a RAW file shot on the 
spur of the moment.
I took the picture one evening when I was out scouting locations for future 
shoots. I was driving across a causeway that crossed a lake a few miles from 
my home, and I decided the view was interesting. While driving at 45 miles 
per hour, I picked up my camera and shot the image shown in Figure 8-6 
through the open window of my minivan. (Don’t try this at home!) The ISO 
sensitivity was at 1250, the camera was in Shutter Priority mode with a 

149
 Chapter 8: Working with RAW and Other Formats
shutter speed of 1/1,250 of a second pre-
selected, and an aperture of f/2 — 
chosen by the metering system — let 
me capture a relatively un-blurred 
image, despite my relatively high 
motoring speed. I know all this infor-
mation because it was recorded in 
the EXIF data that accompanied the 
RAW file.
This photo was a grab shot in every 
sense of the word. Yet, when I 
needed a photo taken in dim light 
with a large f-stop, this throwaway 
proved useful. Because I’d saved in RAW, I was able to manipulate the photo 
a bit to make it a little more interesting by cropping out the guardrail and 
portions of my vehicle.
Archiving RAW files
If you want to use RAW files as your digital negatives, you need to have a way 
to store them because they’re sure to eat up your hard drive space quickly. I 
have virtually every image I’ve shot in RAW archived on my computer’s hard 
drives, as well as on DVD. My archives include shots of my feet taken when I 
tested an electronic flash, semi-blank frames that are seriously underex-
posed, and all manner of out-of-focus and poorly composed pictures. As my 
example in the preceding section shows, you never know when you might 
find some use for a garbage shot.
 
Blank DVDs and external hard drives are so inexpensive these days that you 
have no excuse for not saving all your digital negatives. (Just don’t forget to 
copy them to whatever format replaces the current formats in ten, or five, or 
two years.) When you use most operating systems, you just need to archive 
files by dragging and dropping them to the DVD drive or external hard drive. 
Or use a backup program to perform the task automatically.
Finding RAW image-editing applications
Remember, to work with RAW files, you need an application that can read 
them. A variety of RAW converters are at your disposal. Your camera’s 
vendor provides some of these converters, and as you might expect, those 
converters work only with the RAW files for that line of camera. Unless you 
own several different digital cameras from different manufacturers that can 
produce RAW files, these proprietary converters might be all you need — or 
you can check out third-party RAW applications, if you prefer. The following 
sections introduce some of the more popular proprietary and third-party 
applications.
Figure 8-6: Here’s the original RAW file before 
image editing.

Part III: Beyond the Basics 
Nikon Capture NX 2
Nikon offers the eponymous Nikon Capture NX, an extra-cost ($149.95) 
program that handles both older and the latest versions of RAW files that 
Nikon cameras create. Besides offering control over settings that you could 
have made in the camera, this utility provides some interesting additional 
capabilities. For example, it can defish images taken with Nikon fish-eye 
lenses, producing undistorted photos that have straight lines where straight 
lines ought to be. If you have Nikon Capture NX, you can get super-wide-angle 
photos from your trusty fish-eye lens.
Nikon Capture NX, shown in Figure 8-7, has a separate lightness/chroma/hue 
palette for modifying these image attributes directly, along with post-shot 
noise-reduction features and vignette control to remove (or add) darkening/
lightening to the corners of photos. You may also find handy an image-dust-off 
feature that compares your shots with a dust reference photo and removes 
spots caused by dust on the sensor.
 
 
Figure 8-7: Nikon charges $150 for Nikon Capture NX, but the extra features it offers are worth 
 
the cost.
EOS Utility/Digital Photo Professional
Canon provides the EOS Utility and Digital Photo Professional software utili-
ties, which allow you to view and convert RAW images that you took with 
Canon cameras, as well as control the camera remotely. The EOS Utility is a 

151
 Chapter 8: Working with RAW and Other Formats
bare-bones program; most dedicated Canon shooters prefer Digital Photo 
Professional, shown in Figure 8-8.
Digital Photo Professional offers much higher-speed processing of RAW 
images than was available with the late (not lamented), sluggardly File Viewer 
Utility formerly offered for Canon cameras (Digital Photo Professional is as 
much as six times faster than the File Viewer Utility). Canon says this utility 
rivals third-party stand-alone and plug-in RAW converters in speed and 
features. The program supports both Canon’s original CRW format and the 
newer CR2 RAW format, along with TIFF and JPEG.
You can save settings that include multiple adjustments and apply them to 
other images, and use the clever comparison mode to compare your original 
and edited versions of an image, either side by side or within a single split 
image. The utility allows easy adjustment of color channels, tone curves, 
exposure compensation, white balance, dynamic range, brightness, contrast, 
color saturation, ICC Profile embedding, and assignment of monitor profiles. 
A new feature gives you the option to continue editing images while batches 
of previously adjusted RAW files are rendered and saved in the background.

At this time, the most popular and widely used third-party RAW converter is

with a long list of RAW formats from vendors including Canon, Nikon, Sony, 
Fuji, Olympus, Pentax, and Sigma. It does most of the general-purpose RAW 
conversion tasks that the vendors’ own utilities handle, and it has the 
advantage of working transparently with a lot of different RAW formats, plus 
Adobe’s DNG format.

load at www.irfanview.com, is at the low end of the price scale. It can 
read many common RAW photo formats. It’s a quick way to view RAW files 
(just drag and drop to the IrfanView window) and make fast changes to the 
unprocessed file. You can crop, rotate, or correct your image, and do some 
cool things such as swapping the colors around (red for blue, blue for green, 
and so forth) to create false-color pictures.
Phase One’s C1 Pro (see Figure 8-10) is the gorilla at the high end of the price 
scale, and this premium Windows/Macintosh program for professionals 
does everything, does it well, and does it quickly. Phase One has taken pity 
on us mere mortals and also provides several budget “lite” versions that have 
limited feature sets and more affordable prices.

One of my personal favorites among third-party RAW converters is Bibble 
Pro, which also incorporates Noise Ninja noise-reduction technology. 
It supports one of the broadest ranges of RAW file formats available (which 
you may find handy if you need to convert a file from a friend’s or colleague’s 
camera). Available formats include NEF files from Nikon D1, D1x/h, D2H, 
D100; CRW files from the Canon C30/D60/10D/300D; CR2 files from the latest 
Canon cameras; ORF files from the Olympus product line; DCR files from the 
Kodak 720x/760/14n; RAF files from the Fujifilm dSLRs; PEF files from Pentax; 
and so on.
Bibble Pro is available for Windows, Mac OS X, and — believe it or not — 
Linux.

Action, Flash, and 
Other Challenges
In This Chapter
▶ Avoiding that lagging feeling
▶ Shooting in bursts
▶ Freezing action
▶ Flashing your subjects
T
he difference between a novice digital photographer and one with some 
solid experience is often apparent in how the shooter handles challenging 
photographic situations. Action photography, electronic flash photo-
graphy, and situations that combine both electronic flash and 
available light seem to be the trickiest for photographers 
who are making the transition from neophyte to grizzled 
veteran. (Nobody really looks forward to being grizzled, 
but remaining a neophyte forever isn’t a pleasant 
prospect, either.) These types of photography 
all offer challenges on both the technical and 
creative levels. If you can handle them, you can 
tackle anything.
This chapter looks at some of the technical stuff 
that you need to understand to make the transition, 
while taking top-notch action, flash, and sequence 
photos. Although you can find a bit of nuts and bolts 
here, stay calm and stick it out — my intent isn’t to 
make you go nuts and bolt!

Part III: Beyond the Basics 
Kind of a Lag
Shutter lag, first-shot times, and those annoying pauses between photos do 
more than interrupt your photographic momentum — they can cause you to 
miss photos. Fortunately, of all digital cameras, dSLRs do the best job of 
reducing those awkward moments to a minimum. In the following sections, 
you can find out what causes this lag and what you can do about it.
Comparing point-and-shoot cameras to dSLRs
Users of non-dSLRs have traditionally felt the pain of shutter lag the worst. Of 
the dozens of point-and-shoot and electronic viewfinder cameras that I test 
each year, some of them lag as much as 0.6 to 0.9 of a second when shooting 
photos under high-contrast lighting (which makes it easy for the camera’s 
autofocus system to lock in). In challenging low-contrast light, some cameras 
clock in 0.9-second lag times, and a few can take up to 1.9 seconds before 
completing the exposure. Fortunately, vendors have been improving the 
performance of P&S cameras, and although they still can’t match the rapid 
response of virtually all dSLRs, the newest models are somewhat better.
If you want to know how much a one-second lag can affect a photo, check 
out Figure 9-1. If you press the shutter release when the pitcher unleashes 
the ball towards the first baseman (top), you get one second later the 
photo at the bottom, when the play’s over and the action’s just a memory. 
You’d probably prefer to get the shot shown in Figure 9-2, an instant before 
the ball hits the defender’s glove and the base runner’s hand brushes first 
base. Full disclosure: I didn’t actually take any of these photos by using a 
point-and-shoot; I used a digital SLR that captured the beginning of the 
play, the ending, and all the action in-between in a five-frame burst. But the 
individual images demonstrate what you can capture — or not capture — by 
using a point-and-shoot camera.
The photo in Figure 9-2 is the sort of picture that you can expect to take 
with a digital SLR. These cameras operate on a different plane of existence. 
Most of the time, such a camera seems to take the picture as soon as you 
press the shutter button. The actual elapsed time might be 0.2 of a second, 
at least three times faster than what you get with a typical point-and-shoot 
digital camera.
Shutter lag of any length can cause you to miss a photo, particularly if you’re 
engaged in action photography or shots of children or animals, where 
the difference between capturing the decisive moment and capturing the not-
interesting moment after the decisive one can be measured in milliseconds. 
Shutter lag can be a problem with portraits, too. You say, “Smile!” and your 
subject smiles, but then she frowns when nothing happens. Guess which 
expression you’re most likely to capture?

 Chapter 9: Action, Flash, and Other Challenges
 
 
Figure 9-1: If you press the shutter release when the pitcher 
 
releases the ball (top), a point-and-shoot camera doesn’t 
 
actually capture the image for as much as a full second later 
 
(bottom photo).

critical moment.

Part III: Beyond the Basics 
Understanding the sources of lag
Shutter lag is primarily caused by the camera’s delay in locking in autofocus 
between the time you press the shutter release halfway and the time you 
fully depress it to take the picture. But this isn’t the only factor you want to 
be aware of.
You can’t blame a secondary kind of lag on a camera’s pokey autofocus 
system. If you’re taking a lot of photos in a row and your camera takes a long 
time to write them to the memory card (or your memory card is a slow one 
that can’t accept data as quickly as your camera provides it), you can run 
into unfortunate delays. Your camera’s buffer fills up, you press the shutter 
release, and nothing happens.
But wait! There’s more! A third kind of delay can occur when you’re shooting 
with electronic flash. It might take a second or two (or three or four) for your 
flash to recharge after you take a flash photo, so you either can’t take a pic-
ture until the flash is ready or your camera goes ahead and takes the shot 
with incorrect exposure.
Fortunately, you can do things to counter all these shot-to-shot delays. Read 
on to find out how.
Minimizing shutter lag
Even the best-performing dSLR might not take a picture at the exact instant 
that you want to capture the shot. Hey, a 90-mph fastball travels 132 feet per 
second, so during a 0.2-second delay, the ball moves 26 feet. That’s almost 
half the distance between the pitcher’s mound and home plate!
 
Here are some ways to improve your results:
 
✓ Anticipate the action. It takes practice, but you can press the shutter 
release a fraction of a second before the action peaks. You can antici-
pate more easily if you understand the activity so that you know 
approximately when, say, a skier is about to leap over a mogul, or you 
can tell the difference between a pump fake and an actual forward pass. 
By shooting just prior to the decisive moment, like I did for Figure 9-3, 
you can improve your timing.
 
✓ Take a lot of photos. You end up missing that crucial moment quite a 
few times. If you take a lot of photos, you’re bound to get some good 
ones, and the practice helps you improve your timing. The day before I 
sat down to write this chapter, I photographed a professional women’s 
softball game and took nearly 400 pictures over six innings. But I didn’t 
use a scattershot approach, attempting to get a good picture through 
dumb luck. I was trying to take a lot of good pictures in an attempt to 
get a few great ones.

159
 Chapter 9: Action, Flash, and Other Challenges
 
 
Figure 9-3: Shoot just before the decisive moment to catch the action at the right time.
 
✓ Use your sequence capabilities. Your dSLR’s continuous shooting mode 
can boost your odds by grabbing quick bursts of 3 to 5 shots per second 
(or even more; Nikon and Canon offer pro models that snap off 8 to 11 
frames per second). However, all the pictures in a sequence may be 
taken just before, just after, or between the best moments, so burst 
mode isn’t a panacea.
 
✓ Understand your camera’s focus modes. You can help your dSLR lock 
in focus more quickly by understanding how the individual focus modes 
work. Single autofocus (AF-S) focuses the camera when you partially 
depress the shutter release. That mode’s fast, but it may not result in a 
sharp picture if your subject’s moving. Continuous autofocus (AF-C) 
focuses the lens but continues to monitor the scene and then refocuses 
if the subject continues to move. AF-C is often the best mode for sports. 
Automatic autofocus (AF-A) starts in AF-S mode, but it can switch 
automatically to AF-C if your subject begins moving. You also need to 
understand how your camera uses various areas of the screen, the focus 
zones, to select which subject to lock in on. You can set some cameras 
to focus on the nearest subject and ignore intervening objects that cross 
the field of view for a moment (such as when a referee passes in front of 
the camera while you’re trying to photograph a running back).

160
Part III: Beyond the Basics 
 
✓ Switch to manual modes. Although digital SLR autofocus systems are 
remarkably speedy, they can be thrown off by rapidly moving subjects 
or a shift between the background and foreground while you frame 
your image. You might have better luck turning off the autofocus and 
manually pre-focusing on a particular point, such as first base, the goal 
line, or the position where an ice skater is expected to leap into a triple 
axel. Also, if you don’t expect lighting conditions to change much, use 
manual exposure. Fewer automatic features can lead to a quicker 
response from your camera.
 
✓ Lock and load. When using auto modes, follow the action, and then 
lock in exposure and focus by using the lock control provided by your 
digital camera. When your camera is locked in for both exposure and 
focus (usually by pressing the shutter release halfway), pressing the 
shutter release the rest of the way takes your picture a bit more quickly.
Minimizing first-shot delays
Some digital SLRs take awhile to “warm up” before you can take a photo. 
The original Canon Digital Rebel back in 2003 was notorious for this delay, 
requiring up to three seconds from the time you turned it on until it reported 
for duty. Worse, the Digital Rebel tended to go to sleep as a power-saving 
measure while it was turned on, resulting in multiple three-second delays 
during a shooting session.
This delay was largely eliminated in later Canon Rebel models, which turn on 
in less than half a second, a figure matched by most other digital SLRs on the 
market today.
You can virtually eliminate many first-shot delays with a simple technique: 
Don’t turn off your dSLR! Point-and-shoot cameras typically turn themselves 
off after a few minutes because their LCDs drain so much juice. Digital SLRs 
use very little battery power when turned on, so you can safely leave them 
activated for hours (or days) at a time.
 
Digital SLRs are more power-efficient because the LCD is switched on only 
when you review pictures or navigate menus (or when you use the Live 
View feature, described in Chapter 2). The autofocus and exposure systems 
turn themselves off after a few seconds if you aren’t actively taking a picture, 
but both revive almost instantly when you tap the shutter button. Only the 
built-in electronic flash and Live View use a significant amount of power.
 
If you get in the habit of turning on your camera at the beginning of a 
shooting session and not turning it off again until you’re ready to pack up 
the camera and put it away, you avoid nearly all first-shot delays. Your flash 
needs to recharge from time to time, but that doesn’t impact most of your 
photography.

161
 Chapter 9: Action, Flash, and Other Challenges
Minimizing shot-to-shot delays
All cameras have an interval between shots that limits your ability to take a 
new photo immediately after taking the last one. Most of the time, this delay 
is negligible. That’s because digital SLRs typically have a good complement 
of built-in super-fast memory called a buffer, which accepts photos as quickly 
as you take them, freeing the camera to take another picture. As long as the 
buffer retains enough room to accept new shots, you can take pictures as fast 
as you can press the shutter release. Many of the latest dSLRs, in fact, write 
images to your card so fast that you can take pictures one after another for 
an unlimited amount of time — until the memory card fills up, in fact.
 
Unfortunately, not all dSLRs have sufficient buffer memory for all the shots 
you might want to take, particularly if you’re using the continuous sequence 
modes. When your camera fills up its buffer, delays can set in. Here are some 
of the things you can do to minimize those delays:
 
✓ Monitor the buffer. Keep an eye on the buffer indicator in your view-
finder. It might be a bar readout or numbers that show how many 
frames remain. If you think a more important moment may soon occur 
than the one you’re shooting now, back off and let your buffer drain to 
make room.
 
✓ Get a faster memory card. As I note in Chapter 4, some memory cards 
are faster than others. With some digital cameras, a better-performing 
card can reduce shot-to-shot delays. When a camera feeds photos to the 
memory card faster than the card can accept the images, a bottleneck 
takes place and the buffer can fill. A faster card just might eliminate the 
problem. But a fast memory card doesn’t necessarily cut down on delays 
with every dSLR. Some dSLRs have very large buffers and can often 
write even to standard memory cards at roughly the same speed while 
capturing new images. You might be able to shoot photos all day and 
not notice any delay except, perhaps, when shooting long bursts. A 
faster card gives the most benefit to dSLRs that have smaller buffers.
 
✓ Shoot at a lower resolution. I don’t advocate shooting smaller image 
files (you never know when you can use the full resolution), but in a 
pinch, you can switch to a lower resolution to increase the number of 
shots that you can take in a row. If rapid-fire is more important than 
image quality, go for it!
 
✓ Enlarge your buffer. Only a few cameras have this option, but I’m men-
tioning it for the sake of being complete. The factory can upgrade some 
digital SLRs with additional buffer memory for a reasonable cost. The 
effected models are generally older, high-priced professional cameras. 
Your digital SLR is unlikely to have this option.

162
Part III: Beyond the Basics 
Minimizing flash delays
Your camera’s built-in electronic flash can cause delays when you’re forced 
to wait for it to build up a full charge between shots. Some cameras have a 
useful option of locking the camera to prevent taking a photo before the flash 
is recharged, which blocks spoiled photos but obviously doesn’t eliminate 
the annoying delays. Others let you fire away, risking an underexposed photo 
if the flash doesn’t have enough charge.
 
Keep these tips in mind when you want to keep shooting flash pictures 
without pausing:
 
✓ Close-up shots use less power. If you’re taking close-up photos, you can 
probably shoot more quickly and with fewer delays than if you’re using 
up your flash’s maximum power with every shot.
 
✓ Reduce flash power. A related technique that you can use for photos 
taken at closer distances is to reduce the power setting of your flash. 
You can set many built-in speedlights and external units to 1/2, 1/4, 1/8 
power (up to about 1/128 power), or the device may reduce power for you 
automatically at closer distances. If that’s all you need, use it and enjoy 
faster operation.
 
✓ Use an external flash. The flash built into your camera sucks juice 
from your camera’s main battery and so has been designed to use the 
minimum amount of power necessary to do the job. This conservative 
approach can mean slower recycling. External flash units that fit on 
your camera’s hot shoe or use a connecting cable usually have beefier 
batteries and recycle much more quickly.
 
✓ Use an add-on battery pack/grip. You might be able to connect your 
external flash to an add-on battery pack/grip that offers really fast recy-
cling, on the order of a second or less.
Shooting in Sequences
In the consumer marketplace, very cool features tend to filter down from 
higher-end products to the gear that we peons can afford. You used to find 
power seats and power windows only in pricey luxury cars, but now you’d 
have a hard time finding a vehicle without them. Speedy motor drives on 
cameras, which used to be the province of professional photographers, even-
tually made their way into the lowliest point-and-shoot film cameras. And 
now, because you can find burst mode, continuous advance, or sequence 
shooting on every digital camera, you can also produce a series of shots such 
as photos of a speeding train, as shown in Figure 9-4.

163
 Chapter 9: Action, Flash, and Other Challenges
The chief differences between the 
continuous shooting mode that you 
can find in $149 point-and-shoot 
cameras and the one that you find 
in your digital SLR are the speed, 
flexibility, and number of shots that 
you can capture in a sequence. 
Whereas a basic digicam owner is 
lucky to grab 2 to 3 frames per 
second (fps) for a half dozen shots, 
digital SLRs typically can snap 
off from 6 to 24 pictures at rates 
of 3 up to 11 fps (with the pro 
models) without breaking a sweat. 
Your results vary, depending on 
the camera and format you use.
 
As I mention in the section 
“Minimizing shutter lag,” earlier in 
this chapter, sequence photography 
is no substitute for good timing. 
You still get better results by taking a 
picture at precisely the best moment 
than by capturing random frames in 
great bursts of exposures.
 
To use your digital camera’s burst 
mode, you just need to activate it 
and then fire away, taking into 
account the need for good timing, 
the capacity of your camera’s buffer, 
and all the other tips for minimizing 
delays, which I discuss in the 
section “Kind of a Lag,” earlier in 
this chapter.
Stopping Action in Its Tracks
Freezing action isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. My recent foray into pro softball 
shooting had some strange results, as you can see from Figure 9-5. I was 
testing a long lens to see whether I could successfully hand-hold it, and I 
bumped up the shutter speed of my dSLR to 1/2,500 of a second. That lofty 
speed did nullify any camera shake, but it had the additional effect of freezing 
a hard-thrown softball in midair.
Figure 9-4: Continuous shooting lets you 
capture a sequence of shots.

164
Part III: Beyond the Basics 
Without the added dimension of a 
little motion blur, you can’t tell 
whether the ball is headed toward 
the player or away from her (she’s 
actually just thrown it), and it really 
looks like the ball isn’t moving at 
all — it seems to be suspended from 
overhead by a string. This shot 
wasn’t destined to be a prize-winner 
anyway, but now, at best, it looks a 
little weird.
 
The lesson here is that stopping 
action completely might not be the 
best idea unless the image contains 
all the other elements of a good 
action shot so that it looks like a 
frozen moment rather than a staged 
setup. Instead of completely 
stopping all movement, you might 
want to incorporate at least a little 
blur into your shot to give it more of 
a sense of excitement. For example, 
motor sports look more realistic if 
photographed with a shutter speed 
long enough to allow the wheels to 
blur. And anyone seeing a photo-
graph of a helicopter with its rotors stopped would expect to see it crashing 
to Earth in the next moment.
 
The key to stopping action successfully (and believably) is to choose the 
correct shutter speed. Your shutter slices off little moments in time; the 
briefer the exposure, the smaller the slice and the less blur-causing subject 
movement. To make things interesting, your shutter sees motion at the same 
speed in different ways, depending on which way the subject is moving:
 
✓ Across the frame: Motion parallel to the width or height of the frame 
seems to move fastest to the sensor, and the subject blurs more easily. 
You need to use higher shutter speeds — from 1/500 to 1/2,000 of a second, in 
many cases — to stop this motion, compared to movement in other 
directions.
 
✓ Toward the camera: Motion moving toward you appears to have a much 
slower rate of speed, and such subjects blur the least. You can use a 
much slower shutter speed to freeze this kind of motion. For some kinds 
of subjects, shutter speeds of 1/60 to 1/250 of a second might work.
Figure 9-5: It looks like this softball is hanging 
from a string, not flying through the air.

165
 Chapter 9: Action, Flash, and Other Challenges
 
✓ Diagonal motion: This type of movement falls in between the preceding 
two. An automobile going from the upper-left to the lower-right is 
crossing the frame at the same time it’s coming toward you, so you need 
an intermediate shutter speed, on the order of 1/125 to 1/500 of a second.
 
✓ Close up/distant: Subjects closer to the camera cross the frame more 
quickly than those farther away, and so those subjects require a higher 
shutter speed.
 
✓ Relative speed: If you move the camera in the same direction as the 
subject’s motion, a panning technique, the relative speed difference is 
less, so you can use a lower shutter speed. The following section has 
some tips on panning.
Going with the flow (or panning)
The term panning comes from the word panorama, or “whole sight” if you 
happen to speak Ancient Greek in the home. It refers to an unbroken view of 
an area, such as the view a motion picture camera produces when rotated 
smoothly from side to side. Panning is always horizontal; tilting is the vertical 
equivalent.
In either case, because the swiveling motion of the camera (usually) follows 
the direction the subject is moving, the subject appears to the camera to be 
moving at a slower rate of speed, so you can capture it at a slower shutter 
speed. The result is shown in Figure 9-6, which was taken at 1/4 second with 
the camera following the player attempting a lay-up. The static background, 
which isn’t moving at all, appears to be blurry, and so do the other players 
who could be stopped, moving slower than the player in the center of the 
frame, or moving in another direction.
 
You can pan with a hand-held camera or with a camera mounted on a tripod 
that has a swiveling panorama (pan) head. Here are some tricks to getting 
good panned shots:
 
✓ Have the right attitude. To pan without using a tripod, position your 
body so that you’re facing in the direction at the end of the pan. Then, 
twist to the start position and untwist while you follow the action 
smoothly, triggering the shutter when you want to snap a picture.
 
✓ Level your platform. To pan with a tripod, make sure the tripod and pan 
head are level with the direction of the movement so that when you 
rotate the camera, it follows the action smoothly.
 
✓ Practice, practice. Try out your pan a few times before you actually take 
a picture. When you practice, your technique improves.
 
✓ Move smoothly. Don’t use jerky movements. Follow the movement of 
your subject closely.
 
✓ Keep your eye on the background. Avoid unintentional mergers and 
distractions.

166
Part III: Beyond the Basics 
 
 
Figure 9-6: A shutter speed of 1/4 second and panning allowed the player in the center to 
 
appear sharper, adding a feeling of motion to this shot.
Catching peak action
Many kinds of action culminate in a peak — the motion stops for a moment 
before resuming. You can capture at relatively slow shutter speeds a basket-
ball player at the top of his or her leap before uncorking a jump shot, a ski 
jumper at the apex of a soaring flight down a slope, or a roller coaster poised 
at the top of a hill. Figure 9-7 shows a running back bursting through the 
offensive line while his teammates engage all but one of the opposing players. 
Most of the movement had stopped when the linemen butted heads, and the 
halfback was running toward the camera. So, a shutter speed of 1/250 second 
was fast enough to stop this action.
You can find a lot of action peaks that don’t involve sports, too. You can 
freeze your child on a swing for an instant at each end of the swing’s arc. 
Birds in flight stop pumping their wings and ease into a lazy glide to ride 
thermal currents.

167
 Chapter 9: Action, Flash, and Other Challenges
 
 
Figure 9-7: A shutter speed of 1/250 second was fast enough to stop this action.
 
The magic bullet for catching peak action is patience and perseverance. 
Figure out just when the crucial moment is likely to occur and then time your 
shot accordingly.
Zapping action with flash
Electronic flash units are still sometimes called strobes after the strobo-
scopes used by Dr. Harold Edgerton at MIT to freeze shattering light 
bulbs and to stop bullets in flight. When flash is used as the only source of 
illumination in a photo, it can be very effective at stopping action because 
of its very brief duration.
Indeed, most electronic flashes built into digital SLRs have a maximum dura-
tion of about 1/1,000 of a second and might last only 1/50,000 of a second or less 
when used for close-up photography. The most effective way of controlling 
the exact output of a flash is to limit the length of time that the energy stored 
in the unit’s electrical capacitors is emitted. To produce a small blip of 
light, the flash releases only a tiny amount of energy in a very short time. To 
produce more light, give the blip a longer duration.

168
Part III: Beyond the Basics 
If the shutter speed and f-stop you use to capture an image with the flash 
is such that the continuous or ambient illumination isn’t strong enough 
to register, the image is produced by the flash alone, so your camera’s 
actual shutter speed is irrelevant. For example, you might be shooting at 1/250 
of a second at f/8, but action is stopped by the electronic flash’s 1/2,000 of a 
second duration.
You can find out more about flash in the following section.
Flash in the Pan: Other Keys 
to Good Flash Photography
Actually, you can use flash while panning (or when your subject is moving) to 
produce an interesting effect, which I talk about in the section “That sync-ing 
feeling,” later in this chapter.
You need to understand a few concepts about using flash, whether you’re 
applying this tool to action photography or other types of photography. In 
the following sections, I help you understand how flash works at different 
distances, how to sync flash and the shutter to get the effect you want, as 
well as other techniques that can help you improve your flash photography 
in less than 1/500 of a second.
Understanding flash at different distances
 
The most important flash fact to remember is that electronic flash differs 
from the continuous illumination you know as daylight in one important 
respect: Daylight appears to be relatively even at most working distances, 
but the brightness of flash diminishes rather quickly while the distance 
between the subject and the flash increases. You can step 10 or 20 feet away 
from your subject in daylight, and the exposure doesn’t change. Move the 
same distance from your subject when using flash, and the illumination 
decreases dramatically.
Electronic flash, like all illumination, obeys the inverse-square law. Light 
diminishes relative to the inverse of the square of the distance. So, if you’re 
photographing a subject that’s 3 feet from your flash, you need four times as 
much light when the distance is doubled to 6 feet, not twice as much. That 
also means that if you photograph two subjects, one 3 feet from the camera 
and one 6 feet from the camera, the more distant subject is underexposed by 
4X (two f-stops) if the closer subject is properly exposed. (See Figure 9-8.)
This pesky law applies to daylight, as well, but the distance between the 
light source and subject is so much greater that you can ignore the 
consequences — unless you plan on stepping back 93 million miles between 
shots.

169
 Chapter 9: Action, Flash, and Other Challenges
 
 
Figure 9-8: If the correct flash exposure at 3 feet is f/16, you must use f/8 when the subject 
 
is 6 feet away.
 
In practice, your camera’s built-in flash probably doesn’t do a good job 
illuminating anything 24 feet from the camera (say, a quarterback stepping 
back to unleash a pass) unless you use a high ISO setting. Your flash has 
probably been optimized to shoot subjects around 12 feet from the camera 
at around f/8 or so, and it produces poor results at 24 feet, for which f/5.6 
might be required. Those kinds of situations call for more powerful, external 
flash units.
In addition to the sharp fall-off in illumination, using flash has some other 
disadvantages:
 
✓ Flash photos can look harsh, with bright foregrounds and very dark 
backgrounds, thanks to that inverse-square nonsense.
 
✓ Flash photos can produce a ghost effect when the scene has enough 
ambient light to produce a blurry secondary image along with the flash 
exposure.

That sync-ing feeling: Coordinating flash and shutter
Many new SLR owners become confused over the options for synchronizing 
electronic flash with their camera’s shutters. This section clears up that 
confusion.
As you might know, digital SLRs can use a combination of electronic and 
mechanical shutters to control the length of time the sensor is exposed. 
An electronic shutter is just that: The sensor is controlled electronically to 
allow it to capture photons for a fixed period of time. The camera uses the 
electronic shutter for very brief exposures.
The mechanical shutter physically opens and closes to expose the sensor, 
and the camera uses it for longer exposures, from 30 seconds (or whatever 
your camera’s maximum exposure happens to be) to a length of time that’s 
known as the camera’s flash sync speed, which can range from 1/180 to 1/500 of a 
second. The flash sync speed is the fastest shutter speed that the camera can 
ordinarily use to take a picture with the electronic flash.
The mechanical shutter used in dSLRs travels in front of the sensor, just 
above the plane of sharp focus (and is called a focal plane shutter for that 
reason). The shutter consists of two curtains. The front curtain opens first, 
moving across the plane of the sensor until it’s fully open. Then, after 
the sensor has been left exposed for the desired amount of time, the rear 
curtain begins to follow it, gradually covering the sensor until it’s completely 
concealed. Because of the brief duration of the flash, the flash must be fired 
only when the sensor is entirely uncovered. Otherwise, your picture consists 
of a partial frame, showing only the portion of the sensor that happened to 
be uncovered when the flash went off.
You can synchronize the flash in two ways, each producing a slightly 
different effect:
 
✓ Front-curtain sync: This is the default mode used by cameras. The 
electronic flash is triggered as soon as the front curtain has reached 
the opposite side, recording a flash exposure of the subject. Then, the 
shutter is allowed to remain open for the rest of the exposure. If there’s 
sufficient ambient light and the subject is moving, you end up with a 
streak in the direction of the subject movement, as if your subject was 
preceded by a ghost. Most often, you don’t want to see that streak.
 
✓ Rear-curtain sync: In this mode, the flash doesn’t fire until the rear 
curtain begins to move at the end of the exposure. The ghost image, if 
any, registers first and terminates with a sharp image at your subject’s 
end position. In this case, the ghost image trails the subject, like the 
cool streak that follows the Human Torch everywhere, as you can 
see in Figure 9-9. If you must have a ghost image (or want one), use rear-
curtain sync.

171
 Chapter 9: Action, Flash, and Other Challenges
Figure 9-9: With rear-curtain-sync flash, the ghost image trails the sharp image of the subject.
 
What if you want no streak at all? In that case, try to use a shutter speed 
that’s high enough that the ambient light doesn’t register an image. The 
higher your camera’s flash sync speed, the better your opportunity for using 
a shutter speed that’s so brief you don’t get a ghost image. Less is more: A 
1/500-second sync speed, such as the one on the Nikon D40, works better in 
that regard than slower speeds, such as the 1/200-second sync speed of the 
Canon Digital Rebel XSi or Nikon D90, or the 1/180-second sync speed of some 
Pentax cameras.
Don’t confuse front- and rear-curtain sync with slow-sync, which is a digital 
SLR option in automated modes that sets the camera to choose slow shutter 
speeds to deliberately add exposures from ambient light to the flash image. 
Slow-sync doesn’t work well with moving subjects; use it with the camera 
mounted on a tripod so the camera can record the background along with 
the flash exposure.
Another flash sync option found on some dSLRs is high-speed sync, which 
uses longer (but weaker) flash exposures to synchronize the flash at even 
higher shutter speeds than the camera’s nominal flash sync speed. You can 
best apply this option to close-up photography, where the diminished flash 
output is sufficient for a good exposure.
Getting the right exposure
Your dSLR most likely uses a dedicated flash unit designed specifically for 
your camera, and it’s built right into the camera, mounted on top in the 
hot shoe or connected to the camera with a cable or wireless triggering 
mechanism.
Dedicated flash units are commanded by the camera itself, which measures 
the amount of flash that reaches the sensor and tells the flash when to shut 
itself off. This is TTL, or through-the-lens metering, and is generally the most 
accurate type of flash exposure calculation. Communication between the 

172
Part III: Beyond the Basics 
flash and camera might also include information about which zoom setting 
you are using the lens (so the flash can change its coverage to match) and 
what color temperature the flash emits (so the camera can compensate).
Flash exposure systems can also work with a preflash that’s used to calculate 
the right exposure or integrate the distance data supplied by your camera’s 
focus system to adjust flash output. There’s also good old manual flash 
exposure, in which the flash pops at whatever power setting you specify 
(such as full, half, or quarter power), and you set the f-stop yourself by using 
a flash meter, guide-number estimates, or good old-fashioned guessing.
Yo, Trigger! Setting Off an External Flash
The mechanism used to set off your flash involves some considerations, 
too. Perhaps you want to separate an external flash from your camera by a 
distance that’s too long for a connecting cable. In that case, you have a 
few options:
 
✓ Slave device: This is an attachment to a remote flash that activates it 
when its sensor detects the light from your main unit.
 
✓ Slave units: These are separate electronic flash with built-in slave 
triggers, and work well when you plan to use several electronic flash 
units together. You can end up with brighter overall illumination 
or use the position of the different flash units to provide specific 
lighting effects.
 
✓ Wireless trigger: This more sophisticated approach sets off your flash 
without the need for a main flash at all. The camera or a device attached 
to the camera provides the signal that trips the remote flash unit(s). 
These triggers often have a selection of four or more channels, which let 
you control flash units individually and also avoid conflicts with other 
photographers who happen to be using similar wireless devices at the 
same location. Wireless sync can operate by radio signals or low-power 
preflashes from the main camera that don’t contribute to the exposure.
In addition to the type of trigger that you can use for your external flash, I 
have one more slightly important topic to discuss: how to avoid frying the 
electronics of your camera when using an external flash! Sounds like a good 
idea, right?
All digital SLRs that allow you to connect an external flash use a triggering 
circuit that closes a switch, which fires the flash. The triggering voltage from 
the flash that passes through this switch in your camera might vary from a 
few volts to 250 volts or more.

173
 Chapter 9: Action, Flash, and Other Challenges
 
Modern digital cameras might not respond well to voltages of more than 10 
to 15 volts, and some very bad things can happen to the camera’s circuitry if 
more juice goes through than recommended.
 
Flash units built specifically for your camera or for digital cameras, in 
general, rarely cause difficulties. The problem seems to reside with older 
flash units and newer cameras. One solution is to determine from your flash 
vendor the exact triggering voltage. You can often find this figure on the 
Internet, and the information is usually as reliable as any guidelines you find 
on the Internet (which is to say, not very). My preference is to use a voltage 
isolation device, such as the Wein Safe-Sync, which separates your camera 
from the actual voltage used by the 
electronic flash.
The Safe-Sync, as shown in Figure 
9-10, receives the signal from your 
camera and passes the information 
along to your electronic flash. The 
flash fires, your camera isn’t fried, 
and everybody’s happy. You can 
mount the device in your camera’s 
hot shoe and then slide the flash into 
the shoe on top of the Safe-Sync. Or 
you can link a flash by using a PC 
cord plugged into the connector on 
the side of the gadget.

safely connect your dSLR to any flash unit.

I
n some respects, a digital SLR makes achieving good composition a tiny 
bit easier than with non-SLR cameras, even though the eye and skills of 
the photographer bear the final responsibility. Some photographers say, with 
justification, that good composition should be exactly the same, whether 
you’re using a digital SLR or the least-expensive point-and-shoot 
camera. Other photographers say that those folks need to 
spend more time using a dSLR. Some significant differences 
exist between composing photos with a snapshooting 
camera and a digital single-lens reflex, the primary one 
being that you can do it.
Your basic non-SLR camera might rely on a tiny LCD 
(liquid crystal display) that’s about 3 inches diago-
nally. This LCD is easily washed out in bright light, 
might be too dim to view under reduced illumina-
tion, and is grainy and subject to ghost images if the 
camera or subject moves. It might display only 85 
percent or less of the actual subject matter (although 
most provide a 90- to 100-percent view these days) and 
it probably turns off after a minute or two because it 
hogs so much power. And that’s the good news.
The bad news is that these cameras often have an alternate view-
finder that’s even worse than the LCD. A viewfinder is a tiny optical window 
that not only shows just part of the actual image, it shows you the view 
uncentered. Depending on the location of the optical viewfinder, it can seduce 
you into cutting off the top of your subjects and maybe a little on the right side, 
as well. This paragon of technology doesn’t show depth-of-field even as well as 
the LCD.

176
Part III: Beyond the Basics 
And it gets worse. The trend these days is to eliminate the optical viewfinder 
on non-SLR cameras entirely, so many snapshooters end up holding their 
camera at arms’ length, so that they end up aiming the device in the general 
direction of the subject they want to shoot, rather than creating a thoughtful 
composition. Truman Capote once said of Jack Kerouac’s work, “That’s not 
writing — that’s typing!” The photographic equivalent is, “That’s framing — 
not composing.”
Think how much easier the typical dSLR makes your job of creating a photo-
graph. Your camera’s viewfinder probably shows 95 percent of the actual 
photo at a magnification of 0.75X to 0.95X life size at a normal focal length 
(roughly the equivalent of 45mm–50mm). You have a good idea of the depth-
of-field by default, and you can usually press a depth-of-field preview button 
to get a better representation of what’s in focus and what isn’t. A digital SLR’s 
viewfinder is live all the time — even when the camera is turned off, and the 
view winks out for just a split second during exposure. You don’t have to deal 
with ghosting. You’re never in danger of cutting off your subjects’ heads.
So, coming up with a good composition when shooting with a point-and-
shoot camera is more than problematic — it’s an outright challenge. Given 
that a dSLR makes it easy for you to compose images in the first place, be 
sure to consider applying some of the tips listed in this chapter.
Composing a Photo: The Basics
Good composition is a little like good art. Even when people aren’t con-
sciously aware of all the components that go into great compositions, they 
still know what they like. The very essence of composition is to arrange 
subject matter in a way that both is pleasing and communicates the message 
the photographer is trying to get across.
That communication can be very subtle. Once, I was watching one of my 
favorite films by Japanese master Akira Kurosawa with the DVD commentary 
turned on. The film scholar/commentator pointed out that when Kurosawa 
wanted to express tension in a scene, he frequently arranged the actors and 
their surroundings in triangular compositions. During calmer scenes, the 
composition was more open and square-like.
When I knew what to look for, the late director’s compositional legerdemain 
leapt off the screen, as obvious now as the methods were unnoticed before. I 
realized that good composition can strongly affect my feelings about an 
image, even if I’m not consciously aware of the techniques being used.
I help you understand some of the rules for composing images — and under-
stand when you can bend or break them. Composition is all about communi-
cating messages in a pleasing way — or, conversely, in a disturbing way, if 
that’s your intent.

177
 Chapter 10: Composition and dSLRs
Composing for message and intent
 
Before you can frame your image in the composition you desire, you need 
to know what your messages and intent are. You don’t need to spend hours 
contemplating your photo before you shoot. Simply keep the following 
questions in mind while you bring your dSLR to your eye and compose your 
picture:
 
✓ What do I want to say here? Am I simply trying to portray my subject in 
a thoughtful or playful mood, or is my intent to show the anguish and 
hard life of a typical migrant mother? Am I looking to create a peaceful 
shot of a forest scene, or do I want to show the ravages humankind has 
wrought on the environment? Or is my goal to make my client’s widget 
look tempting so that someone will buy it? Some good photos make 
statements; others convey images of quality or affordability. A few more 
attempt to evoke humor. If you know in advance what kind of message 
you want to convey and who your audience is, you’re way ahead in the 
compositional game.
 
✓ What’s my main subject? Wow! What a great lot of classic automobiles 
all lined up at the drive-in. Wouldn’t that make a great picture? An array 
of these cars might make a memorable shot — but it might not make a 
good composition. Instead of trying to cram six autos into one shot, 
choose one and let the others create an interesting background. Your 
photo should always have one main subject, even if that main subject is 
a group of people posing for a portrait.
 
✓ Where’s the center of interest? Your main subject is generally your 
center of interest, and it probably shouldn’t reside in the center of the 
photograph, except when you’re shooting close-ups, portraits, and other 
subjects that are naturally centered. But, if not centered, your subject 
should be in a place that attracts the eye and encourages examination of 
the rest of the image.
 
✓ Do I want a vertical or horizontal composition? Digital SLR shooters 
are much less likely to fall into the trap that the point-and-shoot set is 
subject to — composing all photos horizontally — simply because that’s 
the way the camera was designed to be held. A dSLR easily pivots 
between vertical and horizontal orientations (some even have built-in or 
add-on vertical grips that have auxiliary shutter releases and command 
dials). So, you can choose vertical compositions for tall buildings and 
NBA players, and you can use horizontal layouts for ranch homes and 
NFL quarterbacks who’ve just been flattened by a linebacker. Of course, 
you can always crop your image from one orientation to the other within 
your image editor, but that editing wastes pixels. Figure 10-1 shows an 
image that quite logically falls into the vertical composition mold.
 
✓ Do I want to print this image in black and white? In that case, textures 
and contrasts can become a more important part of the composition.

178
Part III: Beyond the Basics 
 
✓ How should I arrange the sub-
jects in my photo? Placement of 
the subjects within the frame is 
a key part of good composition. 
You might be able to move 
some objects or change your 
shooting angle to alter the com-
position. The arrangement of 
your subjects determines how 
the viewer’s eye roams around 
in the frame. There should be a 
smooth path to follow, starting 
with your main subject and pro-
gressing to the other interesting 
elements in the photo.
 
✓ Where should I stand? The dis-
tance from you to your subject 
and your angle can have a 
dramatic impact on your compo-
sition. A high angle provides a 
much different view than a low 
angle, and shooting at eye level 
is likely to be boring. Getting 
close emphasizes a subject in 
the foreground while potentially 
minimizing the importance of 
the background. Backing away 
can make the foreground appear 
to be more expansive. You have 
to change your shooting angle 
by physically moving, but you 
can achieve a specific distance by zooming, switching to a prime lens of a 
particular focal length, or simply taking some steps forward or back. And 
in a pinch, you can crop your photo in an image editor.
 
✓ What’s in the background? Backgrounds can make or break a photo. 
Sometimes, you want a plain background to draw emphasis on the 
center of interest. Other times, the background is part of the composi-
tion and adds interest. For example, the throngs of fans not in the stands 
on the visitor’s side of the court in Figure 10-1 tells a story about lack 
of attendance at this road game. In other cases, a busy background 
could be a little distracting or, worse, form a merger with subjects in 
the foreground. You can find out more about mergers in the section 
“Compositional Ideas That Travel Well,” later in this chapter.
Figure 10-1: Some subjects are best suited for 
vertical compositions.

179
 Chapter 10: Composition and dSLRs
Applying the Rule of Thirds
Every book on photography you’ll ever read includes a blurb describing the 
infamous Rule of Thirds, which posits that the ideal locations for objects in a 
composition reside one third of the way from the top or bottom margins and 
one third of the distance from either side. For example, in Figure 10-2, 
Cathedral Rock at Sedona, Arizona occupies one such node at the right side 
of the frame, and the horizon lines up roughly one third of the way from the 
bottom of the picture. Most of the books don’t tell you exactly why dividing 
an image into thirds is such a good idea. After all, couldn’t you follow the 
Rule of Quarters, the Rule of Fifths, or even the Rule of Six and Seven-Eighths?
The origins of the Rule of Thirds
In reality, the Rule of Thirds wasn’t created by some all-knowing artist back 
in the dawn of time, nor was it created arbitrarily. The Rule of Thirds was 
created by Mother Nature herself. The ancient Greeks studied many of the 
most pleasing works of nature and discovered that most of them adhered to 
a specific proportion that could be described in a particularly harmonious 
mathematical way.
Figure 10-2: The Rule of Thirds offers guidelines for placing the horizon and other significant parts of an 
image within the frame.

180
Part III: Beyond the Basics 
They deemed this particular proportion golden and used it to construct a 
Golden Rectangle, which, if its long side is defined as 1, the short side is 0.618 
as long. Bisecting this Golden Rectangle produces Golden Triangles, and if 
you do it enough times you end up with four points that divide the original 
rectangle into thirds. Zazaam! With all that math and natural beauty driving 
it, the Rule of Thirds has to provide pleasing proportions. Of course, the 
typical digital film frame isn’t necessarily a Golden Rectangle, but the Rule of 
Thirds can be applied, nevertheless.
Putting the Rule of Thirds to work
 
To use the Rule of Thirds, try to locate your subjects at one of the imaginary 
intersection points in the viewfinder. If your dSLR has optional grid lines, 
they probably aren’t arranged to follow this rule. Also, know when to ignore 
the guideline. You can center your subject or locate it at the far right, top, 
or bottom if you have good reasons for doing so. Most close-up photos and 
many portraits, for example, place the subjects right in the middle of the 
frame, usually because no other compositional elements are in the photo that 
need to be arranged to provide balance.
Posers and Poseurs
People photography is one of the most enjoyable types of picture-taking, and 
digital SLRs are especially adept at it. Whether you’re posing friends, family, 
and colleagues for casual or formal portraits, or attempting to catch the next 
rock star wannabe onstage, your dSLR has the features that you need to excel.
Compared to point-and-shoot digital cameras, digital SLRs provide more 
flexibility in choice of lenses, more control over depth-of-field (so you can 
throw a distracting background out of focus), and better image quality 
with the longer exposures sometimes necessary for people shots at night. 
Despite all you have going for you, be sure to keep the compositional tips in 
the following sections in mind while you snap away.
 
You can use thousands of good poses for individuals or groups, but you 
don’t need to memorize dozens of options to get good portraits. If you’re a 
beginner at people pictures, you might want to look at some poses that 
work in magazines and books. However, a few simple rules can help you 
build workable subject arrangements from scratch. Read on for details.
Shooting individual portraits
Composing portraits of individuals is theoretically easier than pictures of 
groups because you have only one subject to worry about. Of course, 
you have to please that subject with your results. Everyone wants to be 
portrayed in a flattering way, and the photographer needs to make a subject 
look the way that he or she imagines himself or herself — or better!

181
 Chapter 10: Composition and dSLRs
 
Here are some individual-portrait tips:
 
✓ Make sure that your subject is relaxed and comfortable. Sitting is 
better than standing for anything short of a full-length portrait, and a 
stool is often the best seat because no back or arms intrude into the 
photo and a perch on a stool discourages slouching. However, a picnic 
bench, handy rock, fence, or even the kitchen table can provide a place 
for your subjects to relax while you capture them for posterity.
 
✓ If your victim isn’t facing the camera, have him or her look into the 
frame, rather than out of it. Otherwise, the viewer wonders what’s 
going on outside the picture area that’s so interesting.
 
✓ Choose a good angle that flatters your subject. As I discovered from 
my days photographing models, even the most attractive people can 
have hands and feet that are positively grotesque when photographed 
from their worst angles, which are the backs and palms of the hands 
and bottoms of the feet. Most of the time, you don’t make bare feet a 
prominent element in your portraits, but if you photograph the edges of 
hands, they can become an expressive part of your photo. Exception: 
Baby hands and baby feet can be cute from any angle, particularly to the 
parents and close relatives. But be aware that some childless adults and 
a few other types are powerfully sick of adorable pictures of somebody 
else’s kids, so this charm isn’t necessarily universal.
 
✓ Compose your shot to de-emphasize problem areas. Bald heads 
aren’t necessarily as problematic as they used to be because athletes, 
musicians, and those who aspire to coolness often shave their heads 
specifically to get the bare-pate look. If your subject is sensitive about 
involuntary baldness, or if his or her particular attempt at being cool 
is, um, a poor implementation, lower your camera slightly and elevate 
your subject’s chin. If you’re using external lights, avoid adding glare to 
the top of the head.
 
 Long, large, or angular noses might be a badge of honor and personality 
for some, and perhaps a plus for thespians seeking character roles for 
their distinctive faces. For everyone else, try having subjects face 
directly into the camera.
 
 Alfred E. Neuman, Dumbo, and H. Ross Perot just wouldn’t look the 
same without their distinguishing ears. Less-famous folk sometimes 
appreciate it if you minimize their prominent ears in photographs 
or, at the very least, avoid making them the center of interest. Try 
shooting your subject in profile, or arrange the lighting so that the ear 
nearest the camera is in shadow.
 
✓ Diffuse lighting to diminish defects. To minimize wrinkles or facial 
defects, such as scars or bad complexions, use softer, more diffuse light-
ing, as shown in Figure 10-3. Shooting in the shade or bouncing light off a 
reflector (which can be something as simple as a white shirt worn by an 
assistant or passerby) can provide a more flattering rendition. A diffusing 

182
Part III: Beyond the Basics 
filter on your lens or diffusion 
added in your image editor can 
help, too. You can also zoom out 
or take a step back to shoot your 
subject from the waist up. That 
approach reduces the relative 
size of the face in the final 
picture.
 
✓ Avoid reflections off eye-
glasses. Have your subject raise 
or lower the chin a bit so that 
the glasses don’t bounce light 
directly into the lens. If you use 
a flash, position the flash at an 
angle. You can see many reflec-
tions through your SLR view-
finder, but for flash shots, 
review your picture and reshoot 
if reflections are a problem.
Shooting group photos
Group photography has all the potential pitfalls of individual portraits, multi-
plied by the number of people in the shot. However, the following special 
considerations are unique to photographing groups:
 
✓ Remember that each group shot is also a portrait of all the individuals 
in the shot. The guidelines for creating flattering portrayals remain 
basically the same. (I list those guidelines in the preceding section.) 
Unfortunately, optimizing everyone’s visage in a single shot can be 
tricky because you can’t have one person in profile, another from a low 
angle, and a third with special lighting to minimize yet another kind of 
defect. Fortunately, though, because individual faces in a group shot are 
relatively small, these problems can take care of themselves, as long as 
you keep everyone relaxed and smiling.
 
✓ Watch the eyes! Make sure that everyone in the photo is looking in 
the same direction, which should generally be in the same direction 
that their noses are pointing. Check for blinkers and nodders, too. 
Try to take at least one photo for every person who’s in the photo (for 
example, take at least six photos for a six-person pose) just so that you 
can get one in which everyone’s eyes are open. Then, double that 
number to be safe.
Figure 10-3: Female subjects are often best 
pictured with soft lighting.

183
 Chapter 10: Composition and dSLRs
 
✓ Arrange your subjects into interesting pat-
terns. Make sure that all the heads aren’t in a 
single horizontal or vertical line, as shown in 
Figure 10-4.
 
✓ Triangular and diamond shapes work best 
for groups of three or four people. If you 
have more people than that in a shot, break 
them up into multiple triangles and diamonds. 
Copyright restrictions dating back to the year 
1662 prevent me from including in this book 
Rembrandt’s portrait we know as The Dutch 
Masters, but if you Google this picture 
(or just buy yourself a box of cigars), you can 
see that it contains a cunning arrangement of 
three triangles to represent just six people. 
The trio on the left make up one triangle, the 
three on the right make up a second, inverted 
triangle, and the same figures produce a third 
triangle if you look only at the three gentle-
men in the center.
Tips for Publicity and PR Photography
I made my living taking publicity and public relations (PR) photographs for 
more years than I care to count, so you’d think I’d be competent at it by now. 
I know enough that I can summarize the difference between the two in a 
single sentence:
 
Publicity photography is intended to make someone or something famous; 
PR photography is designed to make someone or something likeable.
A typical publicity photo might show a rising 28-year-old TV/movie star out 
on a date with a 45-year-old thespian whose career has seen better days. If 
the picture captures the public interest, it’s likely to boost the careers of 
both, regardless of whether it portrays the pair in a favorable light, or was 
taken by a paparazzo or supplied by a publicist.
A publicity photo can also picture an object, rather than a person. Perhaps a 
giant blow-up figure promoting a new movie has been stolen from the roof of 
a fast-food restaurant and now resides on the front lawn of a college frater-
nity. Everybody wins here: the restaurant, the movie producers, and the col-
lege students who gain 15 minutes of fame.
Figure 10-4: When shooting 
groups, keep their heads at 
different levels and angles to 
add some interest.

184
Part III: Beyond the Basics 
Photos intended to improve PR are almost always provided by the PR agency 
or publicist of the person or product that benefits. If the 28-year-old and 
45-year-old stars happen to be arrested after crashing a sports car through 
the window of a jewelry store, you can bet that some PR photos will soon 
appear picturing those same personalities doling out dinner at a soup kitchen 
or entertaining the troops in some foreign country.
Of course, the approach isn’t quite that cynical in the real world, and both 
publicity and PR photos can be used for quite serious and laudable purposes, 
I’m told.
 
Your job, if you choose to accept it, is to create pictures that do their 
intended job. As such, you must realize that publicity and PR photos don’t 
revolve as much around a particular subject as they do a particular purpose. 
This category can include portraits, sports photos, landscape pictures, and 
even travel photography, so follow the guidelines for each of those kinds of 
pictures. But, in particular, keep these tips in mind:
 
✓ These photos all have a particular message or two to convey. Your 
composition should revolve around that message, whether you hope to 
portray a particular person as a fine upstanding citizen, represent a 
product as a good value, highlight a premium-priced luxury item, or 
show a technological breakthrough that’ll save the world. Keep your 
message in mind at all times.
 
✓ Keep It Simple, Silly (KISS). Exclude everything from the photo that 
doesn’t help convey the message. You don’t want viewers of the picture 
to become interested in something other than your subject that they 
find more compelling.
 
✓ Look for unusual angles, subjects, and treat-
ments. Your historical society had a Civil War 
buff give a presentation on a recent recreation 
that he participated in. Ho hum! If you want a 
newspaper in your area to run your PR shot, 
avoid a traditional head-shot photo. Instead, 
shoot an eye-catching picture of him in char-
acter, make it look like an old-time Civil War-
era photograph, and watch the newspaper’s 
editor sit up and take notice. (See Figure 10-5.)
 
✓ If you’re shooting a PR picture, you must rep-
resent the person or product accurately, 
within reason. If your photo isn’t accurate, 
your image loses credibility, and reputable news 
media will decline to run it. No adding marbles 
to a bowl of soup to make the vegetables rise to 
the top. Don’t show your company’s CEO run-
ning a marathon when the most exercise she 
gets in real life is pounding on the boardroom

table. That doesn’t mean you’re obligated to picture every defect and 
problem, only that you shouldn’t deliberately use your photographs to 
mislead the audience.
 
✓ If you’re shooting a photo for publicity, go ahead and ignore all the 
advice in the preceding paragraph. Nobody takes your efforts seri-
ously, anyway. Your photos are desirable only if they’re a bit over the 
top and perhaps more than a little sensational. A photo showing an 
Academy Award winner punching out one of his mates in a bar is a lot 
more salable than one of him mending a fence on his ranch. The latter is 
more likely to be a PR photo released when he’s out on bail — and a 
much tougher sell.
Capturing Architecture
 
Architectural photographs frequently call for wide-angle lenses, which 
let you take in large expanses of a building and its surroundings without 
having to step back a mile or two. Indoors, the same wide-angle lens makes 
it possible to photograph interiors without having to step outside and 
shoot through an open window. Wide-angle lenses also allow you to include 
foreground detail, such as landscaping, which can be an important part of an 
architectural photo.
On the plus side, the interchangeable lenses available for digital SLRs generally 
have a much wider view than you can get with even the wide-zoom model 
point-and-shoot digitals. Several non-SLR cameras from Nikon, Olympus, and 
others have wide-angle lenses that are the equivalent of a 24mm lens on a 
35mm film camera or a full-frame digital SLR. However, those are relatively 
scarce, and frequently, that isn’t nearly wide enough. Only digital SLRs allow 
you to fit lenses as wide as 15mm for a true ultra-wide view.
Of course, the wide-angle perspective comes at a price, especially if you’re 
using a digital SLR that has the crop factor that comes with the territory in 
cameras that have smaller than full-frame sensors. On a camera with a 1.5X 
crop factor, a 20mm extra-wide lens becomes an ordinary 30mm wide-angle 
lens, and an 16mm ultra-wide optic has a 24mm view. Although you can 
readily buy true ultra-wide lenses for your digital SLR — including zooms 
that take in the equivalent of an 18mm full-frame lens, at the wide end, and 
fish-eyes — these lenses can be expensive. My favorite fish-eye zoom lens, 
a 10mm-to-17mm Tokina optic (originally developed by Pentax but now 
available for Canon and Nikon lens mounts, too), costs almost $600. Even 
so, if you want to shoot architecture frequently, spring for the pricey lenses 
that you need.
The following sections outline some of the details that you need to consider 
when shooting architecture, indoors or out.

186
Part III: Beyond the Basics 
Reeg, your perspective is out of control!
Whether it’s a good thing, most 
people take photographs with the 
camera at eye-level and the back of 
the camera parallel to the plane of 
the subject, at right angles to the 
ground. I’m always harping about 
using interesting angles, both high 
and low, but most of the time, people 
take photos straight-on with little or 
no tilting in any direction.
 
Wouldn’t you know it? Camera tilts 
commonly come into play when 
the shooter is taking architectural 
photos. Outdoors, tilting the camera 
up is often necessary to photograph 
tall structures, which seems like 
a good idea until you see that the 
building appears to be falling back in 
the final picture. That little bit of tilt 
can make the picture look somewhat 
bizarre, as you can see in Figure 10-6, 
thanks to a syndrome called 
perspective distortion. Fortunately, 
when you’re shooting interiors, 
unless you’re inside a cathedral or 
domed stadium, you probably don’t 
need to tilt the camera upward, so 
you can avoid the most common 
kinds of perspective distortion.
The most logical solutions for this distortion outdoors don’t always work 
well. You can take a few steps back so that you don’t need to tilt the camera 
(or tilt it as much), but that often means that intervening trees, fruit carts in 
the plaza, and other obstacles now intrude on your photo. A wider lens some-
times helps, although you waste a lot of pixels on foreground subjects that 
you end up cropping out of the picture.
If a handy building stands across the street, you might be able to ascend 
about halfway up, shoot out a window, and take in both the base and top of 
your target structure without tilting the camera at all, but you’ll rarely be 
that lucky.
Your digital SLR might be compatible with any of the available perspective 
control lenses, which can move their optics off-center enough to take in 
Figure 10-6: If you tilt your camera back, a tall 
structure appears to be falling away from you.

187
 Chapter 10: Composition and dSLRs
more of a subject in any one direction 
without the need to tilt. However, 
perspective control lenses can cost 
a bundle, might not be available for 
your camera, and are tricky to use.
 
Your best bet might be to do the best 
you can and then use your image 
editor to correct the perspective dis-
tortion. Photoshop CS4 has a handy 
Lens Correction tool, as shown in 
Figure 10-7 (choose Filters➪Distort 
to open this tool).
The Lens Correction tool can fix per-
spective distortion, correct chromatic aberrations (color focusing errors), and 
mend pincushion distortion and barrel distortion (the tendency to bow vertical 
and horizontal lines inward or outward, respectively). If you apply this correc-
tive filter, you can end up with an image like the one shown in Figure 10-8.

can help fix perspective distortion.

Part III: Beyond the Basics 
Charge of the lighting brigade
Architectural photos, indoors or out, can suffer from lighting problems. Like 
with other types of photography, one of the main challenges for you, the 
photographer, is to make sure that the lighting helps render your subject in 
the most suitable way for the particular type of photograph you’re taking.
In Figure 10-9, for instance, I decided to let uneven lighting work for me. The 
bright area at the bottom of the spiraling staircase naturally leads the eye 
through the image. In most cases, though, you’re not so lucky. But you can 
turn to Table 10-1 for solutions to many common lighting problems.
Table 10-1 
Handling Common Lighting Problems
Problem
What to Do?
Too little light: If you’re shooting 
outdoors at night or indoors, you 
very likely don’t have enough light 
to make a proper exposure with the 
camera hand-held.
Provide extra lighting (by using a flash, 
perhaps); mount your camera on a tripod 
to allow a longer exposure; or use a tech-
nique such as painting with light, in which 
you leave the shutter of a tripod-mounted 
camera open in a time exposure while 
you illuminate the subject with repeated 
electronic flash bursts, a flashlight, or 
another light source.
Too much light: Having too 
much light is rarely a problem. 
Architectural photography usually 
is friendly toward bright (but not 
harshly lit) environments that allow 
you to use short shutter speeds 
and/or small apertures that provide 
a lot of depth-of-field.
In very bright situations, you may need to 
use a neutral density filter to cut back on 
the amount of light.
Harsh lighting: You might find your-
self in a situation that has glaring, 
contrasty, and harsh light.
You may need to soften the lighting by 
intercepting direct illumination so that it 
bounces off reflectors.
Uneven lighting: Harsh lighting can 
be uneven, but uneven lighting isn’t 
necessarily harsh. You simply might 
find yourself with plenty of suitable 
illumination in part of your frame 
and not enough light in other parts.
Break out the electronic flash or reflec-
tors to cast a little light in the gloomy por-
tions of your subject.

189
 Chapter 10: Composition and dSLRs
Problem
What to Do?
Mixed lighting: Indoors, you often 
have multiple light sources illuminat-
ing your room. Space located near 
windows might be lit by outdoor light 
that’s quite bluish, compared to the 
warm interior light. These mixed light 
sources can give you a fairly ugly 
photo if you don’t modify them.
Pros do things such as draping orange 
filter-like material over windows to give the 
sunlight coming through the same color as 
the interior light, or filtering their electronic 
flash so that it matches the room illumina-
tion. You might draw the blinds or turn off 
the interior lights and stick with the window 
light and perhaps a few supplemental elec-
tronic flash units that have the same white 
balance.
 
 
Figure 10-9: Sometimes, uneven lighting can work for you, concentrating attention on one part 
 
of the image.

190
Part III: Beyond the Basics 
You’ve been framed!
 
Most kinds of photography benefit from building a visual frame around your 
subject, but architectural photos benefit more than most. If possible, frame 
your main subject by using doorways, windows, arches, the space between 
buildings, or the enveloping branches of trees as a pseudo border. Usually, 
these frames are in the foreground, which creates a feeling of depth, but 
if you’re creative, you can find ways to use background objects to frame a 
composition.
Designing Your Landscape Photos
Landscape photography is another photographic pursuit that benefits from 
the dSLR’s ability to use wide-angle lenses. Landscapes also happen to be, 
after portraits, one type of photography that people often blow up to huge 
sizes and display on the wall. As much as people love their loved ones, 
they’re also fond of Mother Earth and enjoy sharing photographs of both.
Like architectural photography, landscapes lend themselves to contempla-
tive shooting. Scenery changes slowly over long periods of time, so Ansel 
Adams–esque quests for the perfect angle, idyllic weather, and ideal 
conjunction of the stars and planets are understandable and not at all 
unreasonable. Given enough time to work with, you can use all the composi-
tional suggestions that I mention in this chapter when you shoot landscapes.
 
Use curves, lines, and shapes, like those shown in Figure 10-10, to guide the 
viewer’s eye. Fences, gracefully curving seashores, meandering roads, rail-
road tracks, and receding tree lines all can lead the viewer through your 
carefully crafted composition. Curved lines are gentle; straight lines and rigid 
geometric shapes are more forceful. Although you can’t plan on moving 
things around helter-skelter to improve your composition (rocks, mountains, 
and streams pretty much must remain where you find them), you’re free to 
change angles and viewpoints until your picture elements all fall into place.
 
Landscape photography also happens to be one of the more happily gadget-
prone photographic pursuits. Gradient neutral density filters — dark on top 
and clear on bottom — can balance a brilliant sky with the less-bright fore-
ground. Gradient color filters, which I describe in more detail in Chapter 15, 
can blend a warm orange color on one half with a rich blue on the other, pro-
ducing an interesting split effect between sky and foreground.
Tripods are a valuable tool for landscape photos because they steady the 
camera to help you take razor-sharp images that you can blow up to mam-
moth size. They’re also handy as a camera stand that keeps your lens pointed 
in the right direction while you spend a lot of time thinking about your shot. 
Panorama heads work in conjunction with your tripod to allow leveling your 
camera while you crank off overlapping shots at the correct intervals.

191
 Chapter 10: Composition and dSLRs
 
 
Figure 10-10: Lines and shapes can guide your viewer through your photograph.
 
When you’re ready to shoot your landscape, keep some of these tips in mind:
 
✓ Avoid splitting your photo in half with the horizon. Remember that 
Rule of Thirds (which I talk about in the section “Applying the Rule of 
Thirds,” earlier in this chapter)! Place the horizon one-third down from 
the top if you want to emphasize the foreground or one-third up from 
the bottom if the background and sky are your most favored subjects.
 
✓ You don’t have to compose landscapes in landscape mode. Try 
shooting some verticals. If you incorporate strong vertical lines, such 
as trees, off to one side of the shot, your landscape photo can be 
naturally converted to a vertical orientation.
 
✓ Shoot a lot of sunsets (or sunrises if you’re that kind of person). Sunsets 
and sunrises always look good because the light has a marvelous golden 
quality, and they’re different each time — even if you shoot from the same 
location. Remember that the sun rises and sets in a slightly different place 
on the horizon each day of the year.
 
✓ Manually focus, if you must. Autofocus systems sometimes have diffi-
culty finding enough contrast for focusing automatically, especially if 
you have a lot of sky in the photo. When you take most landscapes, you 
focus at infinity, anyway.

192
Part III: Beyond the Basics 
Compositional Ideas That Travel Well
Travel shots are often a combination of architectural photography and 
landscape photography. While you roam around on vacation, you’re bound 
to find interesting things to photograph within cities, as well as in the 
countryside. The chief difference between travel photography and architec-
tural or landscape pictorials is that the travel shots invariably have one or 
more members of your party standing smack in the middle of the picture 
waving or pointing.
It doesn’t have to be so. Oh, of course you want to prove you’ve been to 
the Eiffel Tower or Grand Canyon, so go ahead and take a few shots that 
show you or your companions mugging for the camera. But then shoo 
everybody out of the way and take a few well-composed photos that you 
can be proud of. After all, 20 years from now, most of your family members 
in the photos will be old and wrinkly. But the Eiffel Tower and Grand Canyon 
will be un-aging parts of your vacation memories, if you take the time to 
capture some memorable photos while you’re there.
 
Vacation photos are your chance to apply some of the basic compositional 
techniques that I discuss throughout this chapter. A few new principles to 
consider include
 
✓ Try to balance your compositions. Place interesting subject matter on 
both sides of the frame. I don’t mean that you need to have two centers 
of interest, only that you don’t want a lopsided photo. If you pose a 
person on one side of the frame, include a building or some foliage on 
the other side to create a balanced look. This trick encourages viewers 
to explore the image, rather than feel uneasy because they’re wondering 
why all that empty space is on the other half of the photo.
 
✓ Avoid mergers. Mergers are the (usually) unintentional combinations 
of unrelated subjects spliced together in disturbing ways. The classic 
merger is usually a tree growing out of the top of someone’s head (but 
you can do the same thing with the Eiffel Tower if you’re careful — and 
tired of having your subjects just stand in front of it and wave).
 
 Mergers can also happen when subjects seem to grow out of the edges 
of the picture. For example, if you have a tree branch drooping down into 
your image but you don’t see a tree anywhere in the rest of the photo, 
the branch appears to have sprung from the edge of your picture. 
Examine your compositions carefully to spot and eliminate mergers 
before you capture them in pixel form.

193
 Chapter 10: Composition and dSLRs
 
✓ Don’t be afraid to try some 
new subjects. Certain travel 
photos are almost obligatory. 
Return from Spain without a 
picture of a flamenco dance, or 
come back from Philadelphia 
lacking a shot of Independence 
Hall or the Liberty Bell, and 
your acquaintances might 
doubt whether you actually 
took that trip. But don’t let 
those expectations limit you.
 
 I like to photograph what I call 
the Gettysburgs of each location 
that I visit — the places that 
many people have heard of, but 
have rarely seen pictured. In the 
United States, that might be a 
view of the St. Louis arch taken 
from underneath the arch itself, 
rather than from the other side 
of the Mississippi River, or a 
close-up of the flaking paint on 
an old sculpture, such as the 
one shown in Figure 10-11. In Europe, you might want to photograph 
El Toboso, a village in Spain where Don Quixote’s Dulcinea lived, rather 
than snap only the same-old-same-old photos at the Alhambra or the 
Costa del Sol.
With a little imagination, you can return from your trip with well-composed, 
interesting photos that capture the spirit of your vacation but don’t look like 
you cribbed them from postcards.
Figure 10-11: Look for unusual details, such as 
the flaking paint on this sculpture.

Your Output

In this part . . .
You aren’t done yet! Pressing the shutter 
simply takes the photo. Then, you might 
want to make the photo better by using the 
creative tools available with image-editing soft-
ware. This part shows you some of the things 
that you can do with your image, including the 
joys of distributing them as hard-copy prints.
Chapter 11 helps you do basic retouching —     
salvaging murky photos, correcting unacceptable 
colors, and removing annoying spots — with the 
image editor of your choice. Chapter 12 shows 
you simple techniques for combining one or 
more photos, removing backgrounds, and getting 
creative with selective modifi cations. Chapter 13 
proves that making good hard copies doesn’t have 
to be hard.

Fixing Up Your Images

▶ Checking out available image editors
▶ Fixing up photographs
I
f you’re really, really good at digital SLR photography, your images might 
not need any fixing at all, right? Dream on. Nobody’s that good; even the 
most sharp-eyed shooter still uses image editing, or what the cognoscenti 
refer to as post-processing. (It’d take some major mojo for a photographer to 
perform pre-processing on images before they were taken!)
Thanks to the miracles of image editing, you can take that perfect composi-
tion and create an entirely new picture by judicious cropping. Perhaps you 
can modify your perfect exposure to produce a special high-contrast 
effect or a low-contrast moody look. You can creatively twist 
great color balance with oddball colors. You might even find 
that the perfect shot of the Eiffel Tower looks even better 
if you transplant the structure to a cornfield in Kansas.
Image editing is a skill anyone can master. One of 
the best things about digital photography is that 
your images are digital all the way. You don’t need 
to scan film or a print or do any conversion. What 
you shot is what you got — a digital image full of 
pixels just waiting to be tweaked, fine-tuned, shifted 
around, and optimized. You can do a lot of that in 
your camera, but for even greater image enhance-
ment, you need an editor, such as Adobe Photoshop 
Elements, Paint Shop Pro, or even the granddaddy itself, 
Photoshop CS4.
These are all things that you can do with an image editor. This 
chapter and Chapter 12 show you what you can do to fix up images or 
transform existing shots into entirely new ones.

Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
Editor-ial Comments: Choosing an Image Editor
Which image editor should you use? It could be argued that Adobe 
Photoshop is the best image-editing software on the planet. It could also be 
argued that owning your own private jet is the best way to travel around the 
country. Not everyone can afford private jets or Photoshop, and not every-
one wants to spend time figuring out how to pilot them. That’s why so many 
alternatives to Adobe’s flagship image editor have flourished.
 
Some image editors have every imaginable feature, but others take a bare-
bones approach. Do you need to be able to work in 3D or edit CMYK (cyan, 
magenta, yellow, black) image files while making color separations, or are 
you just looking to correct red-eye problems? Do you want absolute control 
over every parameter, or would you prefer that your image editor handles 
simple tasks with a wizard-like interface? Image editors differ both in the fea-
tures they have and the approaches they take to image editing. The trick is 
to figure out which editor has the features you need and an approach that’s 
compatible with your working style.
Because you’re working with a digital SLR, I assume that your editing require-
ments are — potentially — a little on the ambitious side. Certainly, you want to 
adjust tones, fix color, or sharpen things a little. But you also might have a han-
kering to drop out backgrounds, remove an extra head from your brother-in-
law from another planet, or combine several of your best shots into one. So, in 
this chapter, I assume that you want to go beyond the basics with your image 
editor and your image-editing activities. (In Chapter 12, I explain how to do so.)
For an ambitious soul such as yourself, the image-editing choices are numerous.
Adobe Photoshop CS4
Photoshop is a verb? With apologies to R. Buckminster “I Seem to Be a Verb” 
Fuller, Adobe Photoshop is well on the way to joining the English language 
as a process rather than just a product. The average person who has never 
used an image editor, when confronted with an obviously manipulated pho-
tograph, is likely to say, “That looks photoshopped!” Common misusage of 
its trademark might pain Adobe, but the company has to be pleased at how 
widely known and used the product is.
Since it appeared on the market in the early 1990s, Photoshop, including its 
latest incarnation, Photoshop CS4, has gained its number-one position over 
the years by virtue of a complex set of circumstances, many of which relate 
to how cool the product really is. Consider these points:
 
✓ Photoshop does everything any sane digital photographer or graphics 
worker would want to accomplish. Recent releases have filled a lot of 
holes, including the long-requested ability to curve text along a path. If 
you can’t do it with Photoshop, you probably don’t need to do it.

199
 Chapter 11: Fixing Up Your Images
 
✓ Photoshop does not include (unlike, say, a certain Office suite) feature 
bloat in the form of capabilities that nobody wants or uses. You might 
not need every single Photoshop feature now, but someday you might. 
Photoshop has no equivalent of a dancing paper clip.
 
✓ Photoshop works identically with both PCs and Macintoshes. With 
some minor interface differences, Photoshop works the same with both 
PCs and Macs.
 
✓ Understanding how to use Photoshop is a marketable skill. Certainly, 
it takes months to become a Photoshop master, but the knowledge you 
gain can help you not only with your current job but, potentially, your 
next one, as well. Employers don’t take notice if you’re a Paint Shop Pro 
guru (unless the company happens to use that program) but might place 
a premium on Photoshop expertise.
Despite its cost and learning curve, Photoshop, as shown in Figure 11-1, is 
certainly not out of the reach of the average dSLR owner. Most computers 
built in the last couple years are certainly powerful enough to run it, espe-
cially if you upgrade to 2GB of random access memory (RAM), which should 
cost less than $100. If you’re serious about photography, spend the time to 
master Photoshop.

Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
 
Attractive upgrade offers let you purchase a full copy of Photoshop for a 
fraction of its original $700 list price (or about $1,000 for the CS4 Extended 
version). Thereafter, you can upgrade when Adobe comes out with a new 
release (on roughly an 18-month schedule) for about $200. In the past, it was 
possible to skip a release (upgrading, say, from Photoshop CS2 to Photoshop 
CS4) if you don’t need the very latest features. However, Adobe has begun 
the nasty practice of not supporting the latest version of its RAW software 
converter, Adobe Camera Raw, in previous editions of Photoshop. So, if 
you’re using Photoshop CS3 and have just purchased a new camera, you 
might be forced to upgrade to CS4 if you want to use Adobe’s RAW conver-
sion software in place of the converter offered by your camera vendor.
The good news
Photoshop’s strength is its complete feature set, with tools for doing retouch-
ing, compositing, complex color correction, and even Web design. If you 
specialize in one type of image processing over another, Photoshop has 
everything you need in its well-organized tool set.
The latest version puts the Title bar that appears at the top of the Photoshop 
window to new uses by including a variety of buttons and pull-down menus. 
You can switch to Adobe Bridge (Photoshop’s image organizer) by clicking 
an icon, and you can click various buttons to change zoom level, arrange doc-
uments on the screen, and change screen viewing mode. You can stack your 
photos and then access them by clicking tabs, much in the same way that you 
switch between tabbed windows in dialog boxes and Internet browser pages.
Photoshop CS4 also includes a new Mask palette, which you can use to create 
selections by using pixel painting and line drawing; more natural-looking 
results when you use the revamped Dodge and Burn tools; and a killer fea-
ture called Vibrance adjustment, which lets you boost the saturation only of 
colors that aren’t already fully saturated. No more blowing out your richest 
colors while you try to make other hues more vivid!
Photoshop is a nimble, cross-platform, cross-application tool. It can read, write, 
and manipulate all the industry-standard file formats, as well as many nonstan-
dard file types. You can resample images to change the image size, resolution, 
and color depth. Photoshop excels at providing images that are optimized for 
specialized uses, such as commercial printing and Web graphics. As part of 
the Adobe Creative Suite, Photoshop is also well-integrated with several lead-
ing page-layout programs and Web-development programs, such as Illustrator, 
PageMaker, InDesign, and GoLive. Because Adobe acquired Macromedia, you 
can enjoy some integration with that subsidiary’s products, as well.
Photoshop provides a rich set of tools for everything from simple image 
manipulation (cropping and color balance adjustments, to name two) to 
selecting complex shapes from an image and applying sophisticated filters 
and effects to the selected area. Photoshop also includes a full set of painting 
tools that you can use to retouch your images or to create original artwork.

201
 Chapter 11: Fixing Up Your Images
Adobe designed Photoshop to accept filters and plug-in program extensions 
provided by third-party suppliers, such as Andromeda, Applied Science 
Fiction, Alien Skin, Auto FX, and Extensis. A robust aftermarket has evolved 
to supply a wide assortment of plug-ins that let you quickly and easily apply 
all manner of textures, edge treatments, special effects, and other image 
manipulations to the images you edit in Photoshop.
The latest Photoshop version has an improved way to review images on your 
disk, an upgrade to an earlier program called Bridge, which is a standalone 
application (used with all the Creative Suite applications) that you can open 
without powering up Photoshop.
The bad news
Photoshop doesn’t do natural media well; it has trouble mimicking various 
types and styles of brushes, charcoal, pens, and other tools needed to paint 
original images. To create original digital artwork, you need Corel Painter. In 
fact, many graphics pros own both applications, using Photoshop for color 
correcting and retouching, and using Painter for creative brushwork.
Photoshop’s $700 list price has to go into the bad news column. Photoshop 
can also develop into a money pit. Serious Photoshop users have a thirst for 
plug-ins. Although Photoshop comes with more than 100 plug-ins, you can 
never be too rich, too thin, or have too many filters for your image editor.
Don’t downplay your investment in time required to figure out how to use 
Photoshop. Although you can pick up the basics in a few weeks, if you really 
want to master every nuance and trick, be prepared to spend even more 
time. A search for Photoshop books on Amazon.com returns more than a 
thousand results for good reason. Hundreds of authors who had to figure 
out how to use this application are eager to share their knowledge with you. 
You probably need to buy two or three of the best books and read them thor-
oughly to master the basics and most common shortcuts.
One of the most comprehensive books on the market is Photoshop CS4 All-in-
One For Dummies, by Barbara Obermeier (Wiley).
Finally, Photoshop is definitely not a program that you can use only once a 
month. You can invest all that time figuring out how to use it and then forget 
half of what you know if you don’t work with the application on a weekly 
basis. Photoshop is a commitment. For more information, visit Adobe at 
www.adobe.com.
Adobe Photoshop Elements 7.0
Adobe Photoshop Elements is a powerful junior version of the full Photoshop 
program. Elements has most of the functionality of Photoshop CS4, but it 
lacks some of the features that the average photographer might be able to 

202
Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
get along without. At about $100, it’s more affordable, too. (Smart shoppers 
wait for a sale, when you can frequently find Elements 7.0 for $70 or less.)
 
Elements, as shown in Figure 11-2, formerly shared much of the same user 
interface with Photoshop, but its look has been considerably streamlined in 
recent years, so today Elements 7.0 doesn’t bear much more than a family 
resemblance. Although it’s missing a few features that Adobe deems profes-
sional, such as CMYK editing, Elements includes most of the basic image-
editing tools that the typical digital photographer needs on a regular basis. 
Those tools include image-selection tools, retouching tools, painting tools, 
a generous assortment of filters, and the ability to expand those filters by 
accepting the same Photoshop plug-ins that its sibling program can.

The good news
A price tag of $100 (or less) puts Elements within the reach of anyone, and 
its reduced feature set is a good match for the needs of the typical digital 
photographer. You can find most of the standard selection, retouching, and 
painting tools from Photoshop available in Elements. If your image-editing 
needs revolve around retouching and manipulating individual pictures one at 
a time, you’ll probably never miss the more advanced Photoshop features.
Elements 7.0 includes some interesting new features, including support for 
audio and video files in the Organizer and Smart Brush/Detail Smart Brush 
tools that let you apply special effects to specific areas of your image — with 

203
 Chapter 11: Fixing Up Your Images
plus/minus options so that you can remove or re-paint over sections. The 
Quick Fix mode now includes a Touch Up pane that has tools to fix red 
eyes, improve blue skies, and retouch less-than-pearly-white teeth. You can 
also use a Photomerge Scene Cleaner to delete unwanted elements in your 
images, such as that pesky ex-brother-in-law.
 
The automated commands on the Enhance menu make quick work of common 
image-editing tasks, such as adjusting backlighting or color cast. As a result, 
an occasional user working with Elements can complete those tasks faster 
and more accurately than a seasoned graphics pro working with Photoshop.
Elements also makes a good introduction to Photoshop for people who plan 
to upgrade someday. After you master this program, you can transfer much 
of what you know directly to Photoshop. You make filters, most kinds of 
selections, and basic tonal and color corrections in much the same way in 
both applications.
The bad news
Compared to the most basic non-Adobe image editors, Elements can be a 
bit daunting. The similarity to Photoshop works against you if you’re a total 
image-editing neophyte because, even with the revamped user interface, the 
menus and palettes still bear more similarity to Photoshop than they do to 
less ambitious programs. Even so, dSLR photographers probably wouldn’t 
be happy with the simplest image editors, anyway, so the “easy, but not that 
easy” interface of Elements doesn’t offer much of a downside.
The other downside is Adobe’s tendency to introduce new features for 
Elements in its Windows version first, with the Macintosh upgrade following 
months later. Some features are available only in the Windows edition. You 
can find out more about Elements at www.adobe.com.
Alternative image editors
In the past few years, Corel Corporation has bought out and absorbed a 
host of alternative image editors (resistance is futile!), incorporating them 
as parts of its own varied product line. Other image editors from different 
vendors have either vanished entirely or are no longer promoted as heavily. 
Microsoft, for example, discontinued its Digital Imaging Suite products and 
incorporated some editing features into its latest operating systems, includ-
ing Windows Vista and Windows 7. Corel’s offerings include the following:
 
✓ Corel Photo-Paint X4: This image editing program is available only in 
the popular CorelDRAW Graphics Suite X4 (Windows only, about $400 for 
the entire Suite.) It is a full-featured photo-retouching and image-editing 
program that has much of the functionality of Photoshop Elements, 
including convenient automated commands for common tasks, such as 
red-eye removal, and Photo-Paint Image Adjustment Lab, which lets you 
correct the color and tone of photos with a single click. Photo-Paint also 

204
Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
accepts Photoshop plug-ins to expand its assortment of filters and spe-
cial effects. Its Cutout Lab is an improved selection tool.
 
✓ Corel Paint Shop Pro PhotoX2: This is a general-purpose image editor 
(Windows only) that has gained a reputation as the “poor man’s 
Photoshop.” It provides many of the advanced features of Photoshop at 
a bargain price of about $100. This editor has so many features that it’s 
not really that much easier to use than Photoshop, making its price the 
main benefit. However, it does bristle with more than 500 special effects, 
including infrared looks.
 
✓ Corel Painter 11: Corel is wisely not positioning this editor as a com-
petitor to Photoshop (many graphics workers own both), but as a digital 
painting program that re-creates natural media effects. The only Corel 
editor available for both Windows and Mac OS (at about $400 for either), 
Painter does an incredible job of mimicking artists’ tools, such as char-
coal, pastels, and various kinds of paint. You can define not only the 
color, size, and edge softness of the “brushes” you use, but also the tex-
ture of the paper or canvas, the thickness of the paint on the brush, and 
how the paint is absorbed into the paper. Everything from a watercolor 
wash on hot-press paper, oil on canvas, or pastels on a sanded board 
are at your disposal. Painter comes with a huge selection of pre-defined 
brushes and media, but you can create your own, as well.
 
✓ Corel PhotoImpact X3: This general-purpose, Windows-only photo edit-
ing program costs about $60, and it’s particularly suited for those who 
want something a bit easier to use than Paint Shop Pro or Elements 
7.0 that still has a particularly robust feature set. Especially handy are 
PhotoImpact’s batch operations, which can apply filters and other 
enhancements to multiple image files, one after another.
Free image editors/albums
The latest wrinkle in the editing realm is the availability of free image edi-
tors associated with online services. The most popular include Picasa (an 
off-shoot of Google), Microsoft Live Photos (from the Redmond, Washington 
software behemoth), and Photoshop.com (a tool from Adobe):
 
✓ Picasa: This free software application, available from Google for both 
Windows and Mac OS, allows you to organize and edit digital photos. 
(A limited version is also available for Linux that you can run under the 
Wine — Windows non-emulator — application.) Picasa includes basic 
photo-editing functions, including color correction, red-eye reduction, 
and cropping, and organizes images by using search tools that are much 

205
 Chapter 11: Fixing Up Your Images
like Google’s. Those who have accounts with Google can store and share 
1GB of photos online for free by using ad-free Picasa Web Albums. You 
can purchase additional storage space.
 
✓ Windows Live Photos: If you’re using any of the Windows Live services 
(I personally couldn’t live without the online Windows Live Calendar), 
explore Live Photos. It’s strictly an album service that allows you to 
upload, tag, and share your pictures. It’s pretty cool because it works so 
well with the other Windows Live services. You can publish your photos 
through e-mail or in blog entries with a few clicks.
 
✓ Photoshop.com: This online album/image-editing service (shown in 
Figure 11-3) is perfect for those who use Photoshop Elements because 
it allows you to upload photos directly from the Elements desktop 
application by using your favorite browser. When you sign up for a free 
account, you receive 2GB of storage space (enough for hundreds of JPEG 
images) and the ability to add pictures to your album from anywhere in 
the world where you have access to a computer and the Internet.

Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
Workflow Workarounds
Regardless of what image editor you end up with, as a digital SLR owner, you 
need to establish a mysterious set of protocols, or a workflow, before you 
get down to serious business. A workflow is nothing more than the order in 
which you perform all the various tasks associated with image editing under 
particular circumstances. You can easily have one workflow that you use 
for sports photography (because you’re shooting tons of JPEG images at a 
healthy clip and don’t want to waste a lot of time in post-processing) and 
another for landscape photography (which might require fine-tuning of RAW 
images to retain detail and subtle tones).
At the very least, think about your workflow and establish some guidelines 
for yourself, if only because all your photographer friends will be asking 
you what your workflow is in a given situation, and if you don’t have a good 
answer ready, you’ll look like a (lowercase) dummy.
A well-planned workflow can actually save you some time because you aren’t 
reinventing wheels every time you work on a photographic project that’s sim-
ilar to one you’ve already mastered. The key elements of a typical workflow 
proceed along these lines:
 
✓ Getting your photos from your camera to your computer: Will you be 
using a USB cable (fine for small numbers of photos) or a card reader 
(probably better for larger numbers of images)? Are your photos located 
on an external hard drive, such as a PSD (personal storage device), 
that you use for backing up images in the field or on vacations? Are you 
copying all the photos on your memory card or only some of them?
 
✓ Processing on-route: If you’re using a photo transfer program, such as the 
one provided with Photoshop Elements, you can select from a few options 
for processing your images during the actual transfer to your computer. 
For example, you can rename the image files automatically (from, say, 
DSC_0488 . . . to DisneyWorld0001 . . . and so on). Some transfer pro-
grams can look for and remove red-eye effects automatically, as well.
 
✓ Destination location: Where do you put your photos on your hard 
drive? Do you separate them into folders that have chronological names 
and dates? Do they go into folders arranged by project? Are all your 
flower or football photos dumped into folders arranged by subject 
matter? This point in your workflow can help determine how easily you 
can locate a particular image at a later date.
 
✓ RAW conversion: If you shoot RAW files, do you run everything through 
a RAW converter, such as Adobe Camera Raw (see Figure 11-4), creat-
ing TIFF or JPEG files at the time that you transfer the photos from 
your camera to your image editor? Or do you just dump the RAW files 

207
 Chapter 11: Fixing Up Your Images
and convert each when you’re ready to edit a particular photo? Do you 
plan to convert files one at a time or in batches? Do you want to use (or 
need) preset settings to perform similar adjustments on images shot at 
the same time?
 
✓ Image editor workflow: You have a lot of options after you import a 
photo to your image editor. The order in which you crop photos, adjust 
color, make tonal changes, and apply sharpening can be important. Do 
you save a copy that still has all its layers before you flatten an image to 
produce the final version?
 
✓ Backing up your images: How and when do you create backup images? 
Do you back up everything, or just original and modified files? Do you 
copy images to a spare hard drive, a DVD, or some other media? How 
many DVD copies is enough for perfect safety? Where do you store your 
backups?
 
Workflow considerations inside — and outside — your image editor can be 
quite complex and include many more factors than those I include in the pre-
ceding list. But, in any case, a little planning never hurts.

Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
Fixing Your Photos
You can manipulate your photos in two different ways: by fixing anything 
that you see as a defect without really changing the content extensively, or 
by combining and reorganizing images in more drastic ways. I show you the 
basics of combining and reorganizing (which includes compositing, or melding 
several different images or parts of images) in Chapter 12. In the following 
sections, I stick with the techniques for making repairs and fixes.
The most common fixes for digital photos fall into five categories:
 
✓ Cropping: As you can discover in Chapter 10, you can often improve 
a photo just by removing items that don’t belong or that distract from 
the composition. Cropping — adjusting the borders of an image — is the 
easiest way to remove things from a photo.
 
✓ Tonal adjustments: Your images might be too bright or too dark, or 
worse, include some parts that are too dark and others that are too 
light. Although your dSLR includes features that let you make some 
adjustments for tone (including specialized tonal settings called custom 
curves), frequently you can more easily make these adjustments by 
using an image editor.
 
✓ Color correction: If your colors are off, you can usually fix them in your 
image editor. If your colors are accurate, you might want to make them 
seem off as a creative effect. You can do both with your editor.
 
✓ Spot removal: Your dSLR shots might have a variety of different spots 
and artifacts that you need to remove. A dirty sensor can produce dust 
spots on pristine images. Perhaps birds in the sky off in the distance are 
too small to look like anything other than blotches. Your subject might 
have a small scratch or defect. You need an image editor to touch up 
these spots.
 
✓ Sharpening/blurring: You can change the emphasis within your compo-
sition by selectively sharpening or blurring parts of the picture. You can 
also salvage a shot that isn’t quite sharp enough by using a little sharp-
ening or smooth out rough texture by using blurring.
 
The following sections talk specifically about Photoshop; your image editor 
can perform the same tasks, but it might use different commands.
Cropping
If you know anything about composition, you know that you can often vastly 
improve images by doing some judicious trimming. Figure 11-5 shows you 
what I mean. At first glance, it appears to be a photo of a powerful jet fighter 
climbing into the sky at dusk, possibly preparing to attack an enemy in a dog-
fight. When I show people this photo, they often ask whether I took it from 
the air or perhaps from the ground with a very long telephoto lens.

209
 Chapter 11: Fixing Up Your Images
Figure 11-5: Cropping tightens a composition and adds drama.
The answer lies in the uncropped version of the photo, as shown in Figure 11-6. 
(Please don’t feel cheated by the mundane origins of this picture!) As you can 
see, it’s a photo of an old jet mounted on concrete pylons on the front lawn of 
a high school in my area (nickname: Aviators). I loved the plane, but I found 
that it was difficult to get a good angle. So, I shot a picture anyway, darkened it 
a little to make the image look more dramatic, cropped the image tightly, and 
trimmed out some utility wires to produce a much more exciting view.
 
 
Figure 11-6: The original shot is slightly less inspiring!

210
Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
Photoshop gives you several ways to crop a picture. Here are some of the 
fastest and most versatile:
 
✓ Create a rectangular marquee around the part you want to crop to and 
then choose Image➪Crop. Photoshop trims off everything outside the 
selection marquee.
 
✓ Draw around the area you want to crop with any line-oriented selection 
tool, including the Lasso, Polygonal Lasso, and Magnetic Lasso. The area 
specified doesn’t even have to be remotely rectangular in shape (see 
Figure 11-7). However, you end up with a cropped rectangle. Photoshop 
crops to the smallest rectangle that includes the entire image within 
your selection, as you can see in Figure 11-8. For details on using these 
Lasso tools, see Chapter 12.
 
 Figure 11-7: I made a selection with the Lasso tool, and Photoshop 
kindly cropped to the selection for me.
 
 If the image you want to preserve is included inside a border that’s 
roughly the same tone, such as a picture frame surrounding a photo 
hanging on a wall, you might be able to select that border with the Magic 
Wand and then reverse the selection by pressing Ctrl+Shift+I (Ô+Shift+I 
on the Mac) and crop to the image that’s now selected.
 
✓ Use the Crop tool, which is probably the best choice because it allows you 
to adjust the borders of the selection individually before making the crop.
To use the Crop tool, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the Crop tool (press C to make it active or select it from the Tool 
Palette).

211
 Chapter 11: Fixing Up Your Images
 
2. Drag a selection that roughly includes the area in the cropped image.
 
3. Grab the handles on the top, bottom, or side selection borders, and 
then move in or out to adjust the cropping exactly the way you want.
 
 Notice that the area outside the crop selection darkens, making it easier 
for you to visualize the final picture, as shown in Figure 11-8.
 
4. Press Enter (Return on the Mac) to apply the crop to your image.
 
 
Figure 11-8: The Crop tool allows you to precisely specify the crop 
 
borders.
Fixing murky or contrasty photos
You probably often want to make tonal adjustments to your photos. Digital 
SLRs have the ability to capture a broad range of tones, called a dynamic 
range. That range lets you capture detail in dark shadows, as well as bright 
highlights. Unfortunately, many scenes have a dynamic range that’s too long 
for even the best digital sensors. When that happens, you might end up with 
pictures that have a lot of detail in the shadow areas, but the highlights are 
washed out (or blown in digital parlance).
If an exposure captures highlight detail, your shadows might be murky. 
Indeed, some dSLRs are programmed to deliberately produce this murky 
effect, on the theory that you can more easily retrieve underexposed informa-
tion in shadows that are dark, but not completely black, than regain detail in 
highlights that have gone completely white.
Some images might have a very limited range of tones — including whites, some 
intermediate grays and colors, and blacks — but lack the other in-between 

212
Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
tones. These images are said to be high contrast. Others are rather bland-
looking, with a lot of individual tones spread throughout the image, but few 
true blacks or whites. Such images are said to be low contrast. The problem 
doesn’t always lie with your camera: The lighting in your scene might be too 
contrasty or too low in contrast to render the scene attractively.
 
If your images are high or low in contrast, or are simply too dark or too light, 
you might be able to fix the problem in Photoshop or another image editor.
As you might expect, Photoshop has several tools that can help you. Some 
work well, but others are atrocious or intended only for beginners. In the fol-
lowing list, I run through all the tools so that you know which traps to avoid:
 
✓ The Auto tools: Photoshop includes three tools, Auto Tone, Auto Contrast, 
and Auto Color (choose Image➪Adjustments to access these tools). They 
can analyze your photo and correct the brightness, contrast, and tonal 
values, as well as color, for you. These tools have no idea what kind of 
effect you’re going for, so the results might or might not please you.
 
✓ The Brightness/Contrast controls: Also on the Image➪Adjustments 
menu, the Brightness/Contrast controls have a deceptively simple 
set of sliders that allow you to brighten or darken everything in an 
image or change the contrast of the entire image. Originally, this tool 
was problematic because you very seldom want to apply that sort of 
adjustment uniformly to every pixel in an image. Lighten the shadows 
with the Brightness slider, and you probably made the highlights too 
light. Slide the control to the left, and your too-light highlights turn an 
ugly gray while your shadows turn black. You could expect the same 
poor overall results with the Contrast slider. However, starting with 
the previous version of Photoshop (CS3), Adobe made this pair of 
controls considerably smarter. The Brightness/Contrast controls now 
work proportionately, so you can change the amount of detail in the 
highlights and shadows without affecting all the other tones. If you 
prefer to use the “bad old” tool, mark the Legacy box in the dialog box 
to return to Photoshop’s old behavior.
 
✓ The Shadow/Highlight controls: These controls are a more intuitive 
way of doing what the Brightness slider should have done all along. 
They let you adjust the brightness of the shadows and highlights indi-
vidually by using a dialog box like the one shown in Figure 11-9. This 
one’s a keeper, and I explain it in more detail in the following section.
 
✓ Levels: The Levels dialog box lets you specify how tones are distributed 
in your image. I explain this one in the section “Working with levels,” 
later in the chapter.
 
✓ Curves: The Curves dialog box gives you full control over the tones in 
your image. The section “Working with curves,” later in this chapter, can 
tell you more about this tool.

213
 Chapter 11: Fixing Up Your Images
Working with the Shadow/Highlight controls
When you activate this dialog box, it defaults to settings suitable for fixing 
images that have been backlit, with the shadows much too dark. The Shadow 
slider starts at 50 percent and the Highlight slider at 0 percent. If you select 
the Show More Options check box, you see the full dialog box, as shown in 
Figure 11-9.
The full dialog box has three areas: 
one for shadows, one for highlights, 
and one for adjustments. The Shadow 
and Highlights areas have the same 
three sliders. Here’s how you can use 
each one to fix contrast in an image:
 
✓ Amount: The degree of change 
that you want to apply. A higher 
number equals a more drastic 
application of the tonal change.
 
✓ Tonal Width: This represents 
the number of tones, from the 
256 different tonal levels in the 
image, that are affected. For 
example, if you set Tonal Width 
to 25 percent, one quarter of 
the 256 tones (64 tones) are 
modified. A value of 50 percent 
affects 128 tones and produces 
a more pronounced change.
 
 You can best decide what value 
to use by watching your image 
while you move the slider. Use a 
small value to brighten only the 
very darkest shadow areas or 
to darken only the lightest high-
light areas. Increase the value 
to brighten more of the dark areas or darken more of the highlights. Don’t 
use very large values, or you end up with glowing haloes at the boundaries 
between the shadows and highlights.
 
✓ Radius: The Radius slider helps Photoshop determine what qualifies as 
a highlight pixel and a shadow pixel. Ordinarily, the control examines 
each pixel’s neighbor to make this determination. Increasing the Radius 
value enlarges the size of the neighborhood so that more pixels are 
counted as highlight or shadow pixels, rather than middle-tone pixels 
(which are not affected by the Shadow/Highlight control). Monitor your 
preview image to see whether you’re getting the effect you want.
Figure 11-9: The Shadow/Highlight controls 
allow you to adjust tonal areas individually.

214
Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
The third area of the dialog box, the Adjustments area, controls other param-
eters. These include
 
✓ Color Correction: This slider isn’t a color-correction tool as much as it’s 
a way of compensating for color shifts that occur when you’re fiddling 
with the tonal controls. Use it to remove these casts.
 
✓ Midtone Contrast: Although the shadow and highlight controls adjust 
only the darkest and lightest areas, this slider lets you apply some fine-
tuning to the middle tones.
 
✓ Black and White Clipping: Use these controls to increase contrast 
intentionally by dropping (or clipping) a desired percentage of black or 
white tones from your image.
Working with levels
The Photoshop Levels dialog box allows you to control the tonal values of 
an image much more precisely than you can with the Shadow/Highlight con-
trols. Most good Photoshop books have a whole chapter on using levels, but I 
can provide a good introduction.
The Levels dialog box shows a histogram graph, which is very similar to 
the histogram you can view on the LCD (liquid crystal display) of your dSLR 
after you take a shot. Your camera histogram shows you only whether all the 
tones are being captured, and you can do little other than adjust exposure up 
or down or perhaps make a tonal setting change in your camera’s menus. The 
one in the Levels dialog box (choose Image➪Adjustments➪Levels) actually 
lets you change the tonal values.
As you might know, a histogram is a graph that shows the relative number of 
pixels at each of 256 brightness levels. The more pixels at a particular bright-
ness, the higher the bar at that level. Histograms provide a mountain-range-
type curve, like the one shown in 
Figure 11-10, with most of the tones 
usually distributed in the middle and 
fewer trailing off toward the dark 
tones (left side of the graph) and 
light tones (right side).
The objective of the Levels command 
is to avoid wasting any of the 256 
possible tones that can be repre-
sented. You do that by moving a trio 
of triangular sliders at the bottom of 
the graph:
 
✓ Move the black triangle to the 
right until it touches the edge of 
the black tones actually present 
Figure 11-10: The Levels dialog box provides 
precise tonal control.

215
 Chapter 11: Fixing Up Your Images
in the image, as shown in the 
graph.
 
✓ Move the white triangle to the 
left until it touches the edge of 
the actual white tones.
 
✓ You can move the middle gray 
triangle to lighten or darken the 
overall image by adjusting the 
midtone position.
Figure 11-11 illustrates this process. 
At top, the image is entirely too flat 
and lacks contrast. You can see that 
all the tones in the histogram moun-
tain are clustered in the center. The 
black point at left and white point at 
right are too far from the base of the 
slope where the dark and light tones 
(respectively) trail off.
At bottom in the figure, I moved 
the black point towards the center, 
to the point where portions of the 
image that actually should be black 
reside. The white point triangle has 
also been shifted towards the center, 
where the white tones are located. 
The adjusted photo has more con-
trast and a better range of true dark 
and light tones.
If you remember these basics, you 
can improve your images signifi-
cantly without understanding the 
additional fine-tuning capabilities 
of the Levels dialog box. If you want 
to spread your wings and discover 
more, I recommend Photoshop CS4 
All-in-One For Dummies, by Barbara 
Obermeier (Wiley).
Working with curves
If the Levels dialog box is worth a 
chapter or two, the Curves dialog 
box, as shown in Figure 11-12, is 
worth an entire book! Adobe smartened up the Curves command for recent 
Figure 11-11: Adjusting the black and white 
sliders in the Levels dialog box improves the 
appearance of an image that’s too flat.
Figure 11-12: Curves allow you to control tonal 
values at 256 different brightness points in 
your image.

216
Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
versions of Photoshop (CS3 and CS4), providing new automatic presets that 
can bend tones for you and adding displays of histogram, clipping, and other 
information.
Curves are a way of changing the highlights, midtones, and shadows entirely 
independently. You can change the values of pixels at any point along the 
brightness-level continuum, so you have, in effect, 256 locations at which you 
can make corrections.
The Curves dialog box includes a two-dimensional graph, with the horizontal 
axis mapping the brightness values as they are before you make image correc-
tions. The vertical axis maps the brightness values after correction. By default, 
the lower-left corner of the graph represents pure black (0, 0), and the upper-right 
corner represents pure white (255, 255). When you open the dialog box, the graph 
begins as a straight line because, unless you make changes, the input is exactly the 
same as the output, forming a direct 1:1 correlation. When you change the shape 
of the curve, you change the values in the image at each point within the curve.
 
The best way to see what this tool can do is to play with it (press Ctrl+M on a 
PC, Ô+M on the Mac, to access the dialog box) or try out some of the preset 
curves to see how they affect your image. After you use Photoshop for a 
while, you begin to see how curves can provide the precise control that you 
need over tonal values.
Correcting those colors
Sometimes, despite the best intentions and competent technique, you end up 
with pictures that have bad color. Perhaps the picture has a green color cast 
caused by fluorescent lights, or it has too much red because you took it late 
in the day. Fortunately, image editors, such as Photoshop, let you fix these. 
You have a lot of tools at your disposal. You can easily use some of these 
tools, but others take a little practice.
 
Before you get started, keep in mind that you can’t add color that isn’t there 
in the first place. If your image is way too red, you can’t compensate by 
adding its opposite color (cyan). Image editors work by subtracting hues. So, 
if your picture is dominated by red and has very little green or blue, when 
you remove the excess red, you don’t end up with a correctly balanced 
image. You wind up with a picture that’s grayish because a little bit of red, 
blue, and green are all that’s left.
Photoshop’s color-correcting tools include the following:
 
✓ Auto Color: This is another one of those pesky “auto” controls that uses 
Photoshop’s guesswork to provide a possible correction to your color 
problems — but most likely, the correction isn’t what you want.

217
 Chapter 11: Fixing Up Your Images
 
✓ Color Balance: The Color Balance sliders (to access these sliders, press 
Ctrl+B on a PC, Ô+B on the Mac) let you seemingly add red, green, or 
blue while subtracting their complements (cyan, magenta, and yellow). 
You can use the sliders while viewing your image to make color cor-
rections. Of course, you can’t really add a color to an image; the dialog 
box’s operation just gives you an easier-to-understand representation of 
what’s really going on. When you move the Red/Cyan slider to the right, 
Photoshop actually subtracts cyan. If you move it to the left (to “add” 
cyan), you’re really subtracting red. If you understand what’s going 
on, you aren’t really fooled, but you don’t mind, either. The same thing 
takes place when you adjust the Magenta/Green and Yellow/Blue sliders. 
The Color Balance dialog box, as shown in Figure 11-13, allows you to 
apply these color changes to the highlights, midtones, and shadows.
 
✓ Hue/Saturation: This control 
(which you can access by 
pressing Ctrl+U on a PC, Ô+U 
on the Mac) changes color by 
using different components 
than the standard Color Balance 
tools use. Instead of modifying 
the primary colors of light, it 
adjusts the overall color of the 
image (hue), how pure or rich 
the colors are (saturation), and 
the lightness or brightness of 
the color. Moving the Hue slider rotates the color clockwise or counter-
clockwise around the edges of the color wheel, as shown in Figure 11-14 
(but you don’t see this color wheel in the dialog box). The Saturation 
slider adds richness, turning a muted pink into a deep rose or dark red, 
for example. The Brightness slider controls the overall luminosity of the 
image — you probably don’t often need to use this slider. Photoshop 
CS4 added a Presets option that allows you to store saturation settings 
and apply them to any photograph.
 
✓ Variations: The Variations dialog box gives you a way to compare differ-
ent color and darkness alternatives for an image. You get to choose the 
one that looks best, as you can see in Figure 11-15.
 
✓ Curves: I’ve come full-circle to the Curves tool again. You can use this 
complex tool for more than adjusting basic (grayscale) tonal values. You 
can actually control the tonal rendition of each of the primary colors 
in an image. Using the Curves tool in this way usually requires a lot of 
experience unless you’re very adventuresome.

 Chapter 11: Fixing Up Your Images
Use whichever combination of color-correction tools works for you. They all 
have particular advantages and disadvantages.
Spot removers
Unwanted artifacts in your image might not be arty, but they are facts. Your 
job, should you choose to accept it, is to remove them. Several different 
causes of spots, speckles, and other naughty bits (and bytes) are in your 
images, and Photoshop has the tools to remove them. In the following sec-
tions, I offer an overview of how to use these tools.
Reducing noise
A little noise in your image can be a good thing. Noise can add an artsy, 
grainy effect and serve to add some texture to an annoyingly smooth surface. 
Indeed, detractors of one particular brand of digital SLR say that the remark-
ably noise-free results produced by that camera look plasticky. I’m not going 
to mention the particular camera model because the rebels who prefer that 
brand see this lack of noise as a definite advantage.
 
This little tidbit isn’t widely known among digital photographers who don’t 
have a graphics-production background: One advantage of noise is that a 
little noise actually makes smooth gradients reproduce better because of the 
way press equipment and the half-toning process operate. Now you know.
However, for most folks, noise is unwanted. You can often prevent it by using 
your dSLR’s noise reduction feature. But what do you do if noise turns up in 
your captured image?
You’re in luck! Photoshop CS4 includes a Reduce Noise plug-in, which you can 
find by choosing Filter➪Noise. The dialog box, as shown in Figure 11-16, has four 
main sliders. You can specify the strength of the noise reduction, whether you 
want noise reduction done at the expense of image detail, how much to tone 
down the colored speckles that are endemic in most noisy images, and whether 
you want the remaining details sharpened after the noise has been removed. 
You can also have the tool search for and remove defects caused by JPEG com-
pression. In Advanced mode, you can access a second tab that allows you to 
specify the noise reduction by color channel, which you may find useful because 
some channels, such as green, might be more prone to noise than others.
Spotsylmania
Photoshop gives you several ways of eliminating other kinds of spots, 
scratches, and so forth. These include filters, such as
 
✓ Despeckle: This filter looks for areas of great contrast in your image 
because such areas are likely to be edges. Then, it blurs the non-edges, 
making any spots and speckles less obvious. Because the edges are still 
sharp, your image still might look relatively sharp. This filter works best 

220
Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
on images that are sharp in the first place but plagued with artifacts, and 
it’s less effective on images that are already somewhat blurry. You can 
also use it to eliminate halftone dots.
 
✓ Dust & Scratches: This filter actively hunts through your image for spots. 
It includes two sliders: a Radius slider that lets you specify the size of 
the area around a potential spot that you want the filter to search, and a 
Threshold slider that determines how distinct a spot must be before the 
filter considers it a defect.
 
 
Figure 11-16: Decrease graininess with the Reduce Noise filter in Photoshop CS4.
Send in the Clone Stamp
You can use the Clone Stamp tool to remove spots and other defects by copy-
ing a portion of the surrounding pixels, which should have a similar color and 
texture, over the ailing portion of your image.
To use the Clone Stamp tool, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the Clone Stamp tool from the Tool Palette.
 
2. In the Option bar, select a brush of an appropriate size from the Brush 
drop-down list.

221
 Chapter 11: Fixing Up Your Images
 
 A soft-edged brush is usually best to provide a soft edge.
 
3. If you want to gently copy over the area that you plan to fix and blend 
the pixels more evenly, set the Opacity slider on the Option bar to less 
than 100 percent.
 
 Anything from 25 percent to 90 percent works well — whatever works 
best for your particular photo.
 
4. Make sure that the Aligned check box is selected in the Option bar.
 
 If you select this check box, you can stop and start the cloning process 
while retaining the same positional relationship with the origin point 
that you choose in Step 5. If you don’t select Aligned, each time that you 
begin cloning again, the origin point goes back to the original location.
 
5. Place the cursor in an area near the portion that you want to copy 
over. Hold down the Alt key (Option key on the Mac) and click in that 
area to select the origin point.
 
6. Move the cursor to the area that you want to copy over, hold down the 
mouse button, and paint.
 
 Figure 11-17 shows you an example of what you can do with the Clone 
Stamp.

Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
Healer, heal thyself
The Healing Brush, Spot Healing Brush, and Patch tools let you copy pixels 
from one place in an image to another, similar to the Clone Stamp tool, but 
these tools take into account the lighting, texture, and other aspects of the 
image. That makes for smoother, less obvious touch-ups. Here’s how each 
one works:
 
✓ The Healing Brush: Works like a brush in much the way the Clone Stamp 
tool does. It copies pixels from a sample origin point that you specify.
 
✓ The Patch tool: Operates like a tire patch, pasting an area of pixels that 
you choose on top of the part of the image that you want to fix.
 
✓ The Spot Healing Brush: Works like the Healing Brush, but you don’t have 
to specify an origin point; it automatically samples pixels around the area 
that you want to heal and uses them to copy over the defective spots.
Look sharp, be sharp
If you have an image that isn’t sharp enough, or if you want to increase the 
contrast between one area and another by sharpening one part, Photoshop’s 
varied sharpening tools can do the job for you. Keep in mind that sharpen-
ing works by increasing the contrast between transitions in tone of an image. 
So, while you’re adding sharpness, you’re also increasing contrast. You can 
easily end up with too much of a good thing.
If you want to sharpen the entire image, use the various sharpening filters. 
Choose Filter➪Sharpen to see a selection of choices. These filters include
 
✓ Sharpen: Applies a fixed amount of sharpening to the entire image or 
selection.
 
✓ Sharpen Edges: This filter seeks out the areas of transition in an image 
(the edges) and sharpens only those areas, preserving the smoothness 
in the rest of the image. Like with the two preceding filters, you can’t 
specify the amount of sharpening that you want to apply.
 
✓ Sharpen More: Applies a stronger fixed effect.
 
 Use either of these filters, Sharpen or Sharpen More, only when you 
need a touch of sharpening and don’t need to be precise.
 
✓ Smart Sharpen: This filter includes three tabs that let you specify sharp-
ening parameters, like with Unsharp Mask, but you can also control 
sharpening separately in shadow and highlight areas.
 
 Unsharp Mask: This filter does let you control the degree of sharpening, 
especially when you apply the filter to the edges of images. Make this 
filter your tool of choice for most image sharpening because it applies 
sharpening more intelligently and flexibly.

223
 Chapter 11: Fixing Up Your Images
If you want to add some sharpness in specific areas quickly (say, to sharpen 
the eyes in a portrait), Photoshop has a Sharpen tool in the Tool Palette that 
lets you “paint” contrast. You can easily overdo this tool, so be careful.
Blurring for effect
Blurring is the exact opposite of sharpening: Instead of heightening the 
contrast difference between adjoining pixels, the color and brightness differ-
ences are reduced so that pixels are much closer to each other in terms of 
their color levels, brightness, and contrast. Your eyes see this change as a 
low-contrast blur effect.
 
Selective blurring can reduce the effect of noise or spots, or even make some 
areas seem sharper in contrast. You can blur one area while sharpening 
another to create an especially dramatic look, as shown in Figure 11-18. Of 
course, you can also go too far with blurring and end up with something that 
isn’t even recognizable. Or you can fail to blur enough, leaving the content 
as distracting as ever. The key is to find a happy medium where you can still 
recognize objects, but nobody spends much time looking at them.
 
 
 Figure 11-18: An apparent contrast in sharp and blurred areas of an image can add drama to 
your photo.

224
Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
Photoshop has blur effects that match those in the sharpen category, includ-
ing the Blur tool and filters, such as Blur, Blur More, Gaussian Blur (the 
equivalent of Unsharp Masking in many ways, but in reverse), and Smart Blur. 
Photoshop also has more specialized blur effects, including
 
✓ The kind of blur that you get from subject or camera motion at relatively 
slow shutter speeds (Motion blur)
 
✓ A blur produced by lens effects (Lens blur)
 
✓ A Radial blur, like you were photographing a record player turntable 
from above as it spun
 
✓ A Box blur, which blurs by using mosaic-like boxes
 
✓ A Shape blur, which uses your choice of oddball shapes to blur your image
Fixing with filters
Filters can be your friends. Although many of the filters available with 
Photoshop, in other image editors, and from third-party vendors are best 
known for their special-effect capabilities, you can also use them to fix up 
your images, even if you’re using the filter’s image transmogrification fea-
tures just to disguise an egregious problem in your photo.
That’s what I did when I found myself 
with the photo shown in Figure 11-19. 
It had all the elements of a good 
picture: majestic water bird in flight, 
interesting birdie pose, magnificent 
clouds in the background, um . . . 
dSLR autofocus locking in on the 
clouds in the background, allowing 
the avian to become a messy blur 
(see the inset).
Fortunately, I have dozens of add-on 
filters at my disposal, including 
an interesting clutch from the fine 
folks at Alien Skin, who brought 
us Xenofex, Eye Candy, and now, 
Snap-Art 2. The latest version of this plug-in offers hundreds of ways of trans-
forming great photos into great art by using media, such as colored pencil, 
comics, pastel, pen and ink, oil painting, and many more. And if you don’t 
have a great photo that needs transforming, it can do its stuff on mediocre 
images, like mine (see Figure 11-20).
Figure 11-19: Oops. Autofocus leads to 
out-of-focus when the sky confuses the 
dSLR’s focusing mechanism.

225
 Chapter 11: Fixing Up Your Images
 
 
Figure 11-20: Alien Skin’s Snap Art plug-in comes to the rescue.
Snap-Art 2 offers many more options and fine-tuning parameters than the 
photo-art filters within Photoshop or other image editors, and Snap-Art 
includes hundreds of preset effects so that you can reproduce “canned” 
looks. Figure 11-21 shows how I turned my sorry excuse for a photo into a 
semi-abstract comic book rendition in the Roy Lichtenstein tradition (albeit 
with somewhat less artistic merit).
You can use other filters to mend your defective images quickly and somewhat 
easily. For example, sharpening filters can often fix photos that are slightly 
out of focus. Blur filters can provide the illusion of reduced depth-of-field 
if you want to isolate a subject by using selective “focus.” Distortion filters, 
such as Photoshop’s Lens Correction filter, can fully or partially eliminate 
some kinds of perspective distortion, remove chromatic aberration (colored 
fringing around subjects), and eliminate inward or outward curving (pincushion 
distortion and barrel distortion, respectively) caused by some telephoto and 
wide-angle lenses (also, respectively).
 
I’m no advocate of letting your image editor and its filters correct problems 
that you never should have made in the first place, but when you do goof (or 
want to use one of these pixel-bending tools for artistic effect), you want to 
have them available.

You gotta love those eye-catching magazine covers. National Geographic 
magazine moved the Great Pyramid to create an improved composition. 
TV Guide gifted Oprah Winfrey with Ann-Margret’s figure — literally. 
More recently, Newsweek featured a full-length photo of Martha 
Stewart based on a head shot of the home economics queen 
grafted onto the body of a model. It’s been estimated that 
someone creates a new fake image in Photoshop every 
30 seconds. I want to find that guy and ask him when 
he finds time to sleep!
Perhaps you don’t want to fool anyone into think-
ing that Forrest Gump actually received an award 
from John F. Kennedy. Your motives for doing 
some heavy-duty image manipulation are much 
purer. Maybe you want to add an extra wing onto 
your house to show around at your high school 
reunion. Or it’s time to remove Madge from the group 
shot of your organization’s Regional Sales Managers 
because Madge has been reassigned to the mail room.
Worse, you have an unsightly photo showing your mother-in-law 
with a tree apparently growing out of her head, and you’d be happier if the 
image showed just the tree. You can do that sort of thing with an image 
editor, such as Photoshop. The simple editing and retouching tasks that I

detail in Chapter 11 are cool enough on their own, but in this chapter, you get 
serious by performing real imaging magic to add or subtract objects, move 
them around, or combine photos.
 
This chapter focuses on image editing by using Photoshop. Your favorite 
image editor might work similarly or have cool features of its own.
Making Selective Modifications
A wag once said that time is what keeps everything from happening at once. 
The same can be said of selections in Photoshop: The ability to select one 
portion of an image makes it possible to modify only that selection while 
leaving everything else in the photo untouched. Selections are the basis for 
just about every variety of image manipulation that I describe in this chapter. 
You can see this is true the first time you use the Sharpen filter to enhance 
the sharpness of everything in an image — because along with sharpening 
that face in the foreground, the Sharpen filter can make some unwanted 
details in the background more visible, too.
What is a selection?
In Photoshop, a selection is all the stuff inside the crawling selection border, 
which is sometimes called marching ants. Selections can consist of an image 
area within straight or irregular outlines; include multiple disconnected areas 
in one selection; and have relatively solid edges or fuzzy, fading edges, as 
shown in Figure 12-1.
 
 
Figure 12-1: Selection edges can be sharp (left) or fuzzy (right).

229
 Chapter 12: Combining and Reorganizing Your Images
A selection defines an area in which modifications can take place. You can 
create selections that have three kinds of edges: anti-aliased (smoothed), 
feathered (fading out gradually), and non-anti-aliased (jagged edged). You 
can make selections totally opaque, semitransparent, or graduated in 
transparency.
Performing everyday changes with selections
After you successfully select part of your image, you can do a lot of things 
with the selection. These options include
 
✓ Copying: Move the selected area to an area of memory called the 
Clipboard, where it sort of sits around waiting (until you copy some-
thing new to replace it) so that you can paste it into a new layer of its 
own. The copied portion is surrounded by transparency, so it floats over 
the image area in the layers below it. Press Ctrl+C (or Ô+C on the Mac) 
to copy a selected area.
 
✓ Cutting: Remove the selected area from your image. The cut portion 
ends up on the Clipboard, just like you copied it, and you can paste it 
until you replace it on the Clipboard with something else. Press Ctrl+X 
(or Ô+X on the Mac) to cut a selected area.
 
✓ Changing: After you make a selection, you can change its boundaries, 
making them larger, smaller, and more or less feathered or irregular. 
You can also add other selections to your original selection, transform 
the size and shape of the selection, and invert it. Use the Select menu to 
adjust a selection.
 
✓ Filling: Add the contents of other selected areas or images that you’ve 
copied to the Clipboard, thereby pasting one image into another. Press 
Ctrl+V (Ô+V on the Mac) to paste an image that you’ve copied to the 
Clipboard.
 
✓ Painting, filling, or modifying: Use any of the brush-like and painting 
tools on the selected area while rendering the rest of the image (the 
non-selected area) immune to your fiddling. You can paint with color or 
fill the area with a color or pattern. To apply changes, you can use the 
Clone Stamp, Gradient tool, Dodge and Burn tools, Blur/Sharpen tools, 
and many more utensils.
 
✓ Applying: Use a filter only on a selected area, leaving the other areas 
untouched.
 
✓ Masking: Prevent selected areas from being modified accidentally. Use 
masking when you want to do a little brushwork on the background of 
an image but don’t want to mess with a face in the foreground. Select the 
face as a protected mask (Photoshop lets you use selections as either an 
active or a protected image area) and go to town.

230
Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
 
✓ Transforming: Change the selected area’s size, shape, or perspective; 
flip it horizontally or vertically (or both); and rotate it. Choose Select➪
Transform Selection to apply these changes.
 
✓ Saving: Reselecting the same portion of an image at a later time. Choose 
Selection➪Save Selection and store the selection as a file under a name 
that you choose.
 
✓ Converting: Making selections into vector-oriented paths that you can 
manipulate with the Pen tool. You can go the other way, too, convert-
ing paths to selections. Use the Make Work Path and Make Selection 
options, respectively, in the Paths palette.
Making Basic Selections
Photoshop has three main selection tools: Marquee, Lasso, and Magic Wand. 
Each tool has multiple variations. For example, the Marquee tool includes 
Rectangular, Oval, and Single Row/Column versions. The Lasso tool includes 
Polygonal and Magnetic varieties. The Magic Wand is pretty much the Magic 
Wand (it’s magic, it’s a wand, and that’s about it) but does come in one varia-
tion, Photoshop CS4’s Quick Selection tool, which (although its icon is also 
a wand) operates in a different way (by dragging around your object, as I 
explain in the section “Selecting pixels,” later in this chapter). The tool that 
you use depends on the shape of the image you want to select. In the follow-
ing sections, I offer the simple steps for using each tool.
Making rectangles, squares, ovals, and circles
Normally, you draw a Marquee selection by clicking and dragging to the cor-
rect size. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Select one of the Marquee tools from the Tool Palette (the tools are all 
nested within the same icon) or press M to select the Marquee.
 
2. Click and drag in your image, releasing the mouse button when the 
selection is the size that you want. (See Figure 12-2.)
 
 Cancel your selection by clicking outside the selection border when you use 
a selection tool or by pressing Ctrl+D (Ô+D on the Mac). Make its borders 
visible/invisible by pressing Ctrl+H (Ô+H on the Mac).
 
You can view all the nested tools hidden in a Photoshop Tool palette icon by 
clicking the small triangle in the lower-right corner of the icon. When you 
hover the mouse cursor over an icon, the name of that tool pops up. To dis-
play all the tools, right-click (Control-click on the Mac) the icon.

231
 Chapter 12: Combining and Reorganizing Your Images
 
To radiate a selection outward with the clicked point as the center of the 
selection, hold down the Alt key (Option key on the Mac) while dragging. 
Hold down the Shift key while dragging to create a perfect circle or square.
The Option bar gives you increased control over your Marquee selection:
 
✓ To create a selection with 
particular proportions: Say that 
you want 5:7 so that you can 
crop to the shape of a 5-x-7-inch 
print; select Fixed Aspect Ratio 
in the Style drop-down list.
 
✓ If you want a selection that has 
specific pixel dimensions: Such 
as 640 x 480 pixels; select Fixed 
Size in the Style drop-down list.
 
✓ To feather the edges of your 
Marquee selection: Feathering 
creates a fading border effect. 
Type a pixel value into the 
Feather box.
Selecting odd shapes
You can use the Lasso tool to make freehand selections of a part of an image 
by following these steps:
 
1. Select the Lasso tool from the Tool palette (or press L).
 
 You can choose from three types of Lasso:
 
• The default lasso: Sketches in a selection like you’re drawing with a 
pencil.
 
• The Polygonal Lasso: Click multiple times to create odd-shape 
selections that have straight lines.
 
• The Magnetic Lasso: At work in Figure 12-3. Looks for edges while 
you drag, and it hugs those edges by using Option bar options, 
such as width, edge contrast, frequency (number of magnetized 
points to lay down), and (if you use a pressure-sensitive tablet) 
pen pressure or line thickness.
 
2. Drag around the outline of the area that you want to select.
Figure 12-2: Round things lend themselves to 
selecting with the Elliptical Marquee.

232
Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
 
 
Figure 12-3: The Magnetic Lasso clings tightly to outlines.
Selecting pixels
The Magic Wand tool, as shown in Figure 12-4, selects pixels that are similar 
in hue and value to the pixel that you first click. The Magic Wand is a good 
tool for selecting plain areas that have few contrasting details, such as the 
sky, blank walls, or solid colors. After you select this tool, use the Option bar 
to set how the tool should work:
 
✓ You can set the Magic Wand tool to select only pixels that touch each other 
(contiguous) or similar pixels anywhere in the image (noncontiguous). Select 
either mode from the Option bar.
 
✓ Decide how fussy you want 
the wand to be by choosing a 
Tolerance setting from 0 (really 
fussy) to 255 (accepts just about 
anything).
 
 A default value of 32 usually 
works best, but you can 
increase or reduce this number 
to select more or fewer pixels.
 
✓ Select the Use All Layers box 
to tell the wand to select pixels 
based on information in all the 
layers of your image, rather than 
just the currently active layer.
Figure 12-4: The Magic Wand is good for 
selecting evenly toned, evenly colored subjects, 
like the sky in this picture.

233
 Chapter 12: Combining and Reorganizing Your Images
You can drag the Quick Selection tool, nested in Photoshop CS4’s tool palette 
with the Magic Wand, around the periphery of a relatively well-defined shape 
(one surrounded by a background that might be suitable for selection by 
using the Magic Wand, for example). While you drag, the tool creates a selec-
tion around your object. Although the selection may not look right at first — 
as shown in Figure 12-5, in which the selection border appears to be on the 
wrong side of the lighthouse spire — when you continue to define the selec-
tion, it corrects itself.
 
Mark the Auto-Enhance check box to allow the Quick Selection tool to more 
closely align the selection border with the object. You can make further 
improvements to the selection border by clicking the Refine Edge button 
after you complete the selection. Both toolbar controls are shown in the inset 
in Figure 12-5.
 
 
Figure 12-5: The Quick Selection tool allows you to drag a selection 
 
around the edges of an object.
Painting selections
Photoshop’s Quick Mask mode is a great way to create your selections by paint-
ing them with any size and shape brush that you want. While in Quick Mask 

234
Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
mode, you can also use other selection tools, such as the Lasso tool or Magic 
Wand, to select areas that you then fill with the mask color. Follow these steps:
 
1. To enter Quick Mask mode, click the Quick Mask icon in the Tool 
palette or simply press Q.
 
 With Photoshop CS4, you can also choose Edit in Quick Mask Mode from 
the Select menu.
 
2. (Optional) Double-click the Quick Mask icon to set several options, such 
as the opacity and color of the tone used to represent the painted mask.
 
 You can also choose whether the tone represents the areas that 
are selected for editing or the areas that are protected from editing 
(masked). I prefer to paint the actual selection that I want.
 
 If you’re working with a subject that contains a lot of red, you might 
want to use a mask painting color other than red. You can also select 
whether the painted area represents a selection (an area that you can 
work on) or a mask (a protected area).
 
3. With the Brush, paint the area that you want to select/mask.
 
 For the image shown in Figure 12-6, I wanted to blur part of the back-
ground, so I painted a selection that included the parts to be blurred.

4. Apply whatever changes you want to make to the selected area.
 
 In my example, as shown in Figure 12-7, I applied the Blur filter.
 
5. Press Q to exit Quick Mask mode.
 
 
Figure 12-7: The Blur filter makes the painted areas become fuzzy.
Fiddling with your selections
After you select part of an image, you can apply all sorts of effects to your 
selections, including marking the Anti-Aliased box in the Option bar to 
smooth the edges of freehand or elliptical selections. (Rectangles don’t need 
smoothing.) Type a value into the Feather box to create a selection that fades 
out over the range of pixels that you specify. Add to a selection by holding 
down the Shift key while you drag with any selection tool to create additional 
selected areas. Subtract from a selection by holding down the Alt key (Option 
on the Mac) while dragging the area that you want removed. If you want the 
selection tool to default to normal, add, or subtract mode, you can also click 
the Normal, Add, or Subtract icons (natch) on the Option bar. Another handy 
tool is the Intersect button, which lets you create a selection that consists 
only of the portion that overlaps both the new and original selection.

236
Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
You can also modify selections by 
using the Select menu. You find 
options for selecting everything in 
the image (usually, you can more 
easily press Ctrl+A, Ô+A on the 
Mac, to select all) or to select noth-
ing (press Ctrl+D or Ô+D on the 
Mac). You might also choose to 
select based on a range of colors 
that you specify; to feather the 
current selection; to modify the 
selection border width, size, and 
smoothness; to grow the selection 
to adjacent pixels meeting the cur-
rent tolerance parameters; or to 
select pixels anywhere in the image 
that are similar to those chosen 
already. The Transform Selection 
option can be useful for sizing, 
rotating, or skewing a selection.
One handy tool in Photoshop CS4 
is the Refine Edge facility, which 
you can access by clicking the Refine 
Edge button when a selection is com-
plete. The Refine Edge dialog box, 
as shown in Figure 12-8, appears. 
It contains sliders for smoothing, 
feathering, expanding, or contract-
ing the selection edge, plus increasing the size of the selection edge radius or 
enhancing the contrast. Photoshop can show you the effects of your changes 
in various modes (including Quick Mask mode, and the selection contrasted 
against a black or white background). Although Refine Edge isn’t a magic 
tool, it does allow you to use the selection tools built into Photoshop more 
intelligently.
Adding to and Subtracting from Your Pictures
Instead of tearing all your wedding photos in half, you can replace your 
ex-spouse with a potted plant, which might be more appropriate than you 
think. Did your brother-in-law end up mugging in every single group photo 
taken at your last family reunion? Does that 1977 Pinto parked in the drive-
way otherwise detract from the beautiful landscaping in the photo of your 
stately manor home? Sure, you could’ve been smarter when you snapped the 
original photo, but at least you have the opportunity to redeem yourself by 
removing the offending person or object in Photoshop.
Figure 12-8: Refine Edge allows you to modify 
selections by using several different controls.

Evicting your ex-brother-in-law
Okay, your sister has untied the knot, and her former spouse has left the 
state. Why is he still haunting all the family photos? Your best move might be 
to take him out (unless you live in the kind of family where that phrase has a 
different context). Photoshop can do the job. Figure 12-9 shows a typical “prob-
lem” picture. The guy on the left is the one I want to get rid of. I can copy por-
tions of the background over the parts of him that overlap areas I want to keep 
and then crop the image so the rest of him is excluded from the final photo.
 
 
Figure 12-9: How can I get rid of the guy on the left?
Follow these fairly easy steps:
 
1. Use a selection tool to grab 
parts of the background to 
either side of the person 
whom you want to delete 
and then copy the selections 
to a new layer.
 
 A new layer is created auto-
matically when you paste 
your copied selection. The 
resulting layer looks like 
Figure 12-10.
 
 You can make the initial 
selection by using the Lasso 
tool or in Quick Mask mode. 
Figure 12-10: Grab part of the background to 
cover up the unwanted image area.

238
Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
Then, press Ctrl+J (or Ô+J on the Mac) to copy the selection directly 
to a new layer. This process is usually a lot faster than pressing Ctrl+C 
(Ô+C on the Mac) to copy, followed by Ctrl+V (Ô+V) to paste.
 
2. Move the background pieces so that they cover the unwanted 
ex-relative.
 
 After you paste them, the copied pieces reside in their own layer, so you 
can move them around in any way that you want within that layer.
 
3. Press E to select the Eraser and use an eraser brush to remove the 
edges of the background pieces so that they blend in with the original 
background, as shown in Figure 12-11.
 
 I selected a soft-edged eraser brush.
 
 
Figure 12-11: Blend in the background pieces.
 
4. Flatten the image (choose Layer➪Flatten) to merge all the layers.
 
5. With the Crop tool, trim the image so it includes only the two main 
subjects and some of the background around them, as you see in 
Figure 12-12.
Bringing a family closer together
In some situations, you want to bring closer together two subjects who are 
separated. Perhaps you deleted a person in the middle, leaving a huge gap. 
Or maybe the problem stems from a series of unfortunate seating events. You 
can use the same techniques from the preceding section to bring family mem-
bers (or any other subjects) closer together.

239
 Chapter 12: Combining and Reorganizing Your Images
 
 
Figure 12-12: The photo without the evicted guy looks like this.
I started with the photo shown in Figure 12-12 and brought the people closer 
together by following these steps. Although every picture is unique, you can 
likely follow similar steps in your own photos:
 
1. I copied the fellow on the right and pasted him into his own layer.
 
2. I copied some of the background that surrounded him because that 
makes it easier to blend him in later on.
 
3. I clicked the Eyeball icon in the left column of the Layers palette to make 
the new layer temporarily invisible.
 
4. Going back to the original layer (click it to reactivate), I copied portions 
of the background surrounding his original location and pasted them in 
a new layer to cover up the original figure.
 
5. I blended in the new background so it looked natural.
 
 With your own photo, you might need to lighten or darken the back-
ground (choose Image➪Adjustments➪Brightness/Contrast). Or copy 
some of the pixels from one area to the overlapping area by using the 
Clone Stamp to blend the transition.
 
6. I clicked the Eyeball icon in the hidden layer with the guy to make him 
visible again.

240
Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
 
7. I used the Eraser to remove some of the edges so that the guy blended 
in with the two layers underneath.
 
8. I flattened the image (choose Layer➪Flatten) and cropped to produce 
the final photo, as shown in Figure 12-13.
 
 
Figure 12-13: Photoshop brought these brothers closer together.
Adding New Backgrounds
You can’t always count on having a background that’s as interesting as your 
main subject. If you catch Renée Zellweger or Hugh Grant sneaking out the 
back door of a restaurant and the background is a pile of garbage cans, you 
end up with a photo that isn’t worth a mention in Bridget Jones’ diary. Go to 
work in Photoshop and replace those cans with, say, Central Park, and you 
might have something.
Adding a new background is easy, particularly if you can easily select the 
existing background by using the tools I describe in the section “Making 
Basic Selections,” earlier in this chapter. Figure 12-14 shows a shot taken on 
an overcast fall day, when the foliage was at its most colorful and the clouds 
in the sky were dull and lifeless. I shot the photo anyway and let Photoshop 
come to the rescue.

241
 Chapter 12: Combining and Reorganizing Your Images
 
 
Figure 12-14: A dull sky needn’t ruin a perfectly good fall photo.
I used the following steps to improve the original background. You can follow 
these steps for any background that you want to replace:
 
1. Find some suitable background in another photo and paste it into a 
new layer in the photo that needs the facelift.
 
 Select the new background and then press Ctrl+C (Ô+C on the Mac), fol-
lowed by Ctrl+V (Ô+V on the Mac) in the document that needs the new 
background.
 
 The new cloudy sky for my picture looked like Figure 12-15.
 
 
Figure 12-15: Along come some beautiful clouds, just when 
 
I need them!

242
Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
 
2. Switch to the original layer, then use the Magic Wand to select the 
background that you want to replace and set a Tolerance level.
 
 I selected the main, dull-looking sky area and used a Tolerance 
level of 32.
 
3. (Optional) If you have a lot of separate little bits of background (such 
as the little bits of sky that peeped through the leaves in my picture), 
choose Select➪Similar to expand the selection.
 
 The selection now includes all the niggly little bits of background that 
would have been a pain to select individually.
 
4. Invert the selection by choosing Select➪Invert (or press Ctrl+Shift+I in 
Windows or Ô+Shift+I on the Mac) so that everything except the sky 
and gaps in the leaves is selected.
 
5. Switch to the layer that contains the new background, and then press 
Delete to remove the replacement sky area that you don’t need.
 
 After I pressed Delete, I was left with only one broad patch of clouds, 
plus many smaller slivers, as shown in Figure 12-16.
 
 
Figure 12-16: Every cloud has a sliver lining.
 
6. Flatten that image like a pancake (choose Layer➪Flatten) to end up 
with your final, one-layer image.
 
 I ended up with the photo shown in Figure 12-17.

Combining Several dSLR Photos into One
About the most entertaining thing that you can do with a mouse (assuming 
you’re not a cat) is combining photographs to create a new image (also called 
compositing). One of my favorite tricks involves taking an everyday object, 
such as my car (an aging convertible that’s on its last legs), and placing it in 
exotic locales. You can drop a new object into an existing photo as easily as 
replacing a background — and in some respects, much more easily.
Figure 12-18 shows the automobile in question parked in a grungy gravel 
driveway.
 
1. Use the Lasso tool to select the object, including a lot of the back-
ground, and press Ctrl+J (Ô+J if you’re using a Mac) to copy the selec-
tion to a new layer in the current document.
 
2. Click the Eyeball icon in the layer that contains the background to 
make it invisible, switch back to the copied layer, and use the Eraser 
tool to remove everything that isn’t part of the object (in my case, 
my car).

244
Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
 
 
Figure 12-18: You can take this vehicle for a drive without even leaving 
 
Photoshop!
The steps are fairly simple: Select the object, and copy it to a new layer on an 
image that contains a suitable background. The only hard part is blending in 
the object so that it looks like it belongs there. Follow these steps:
 
 By using the Eraser, you can easily remove the surroundings carefully, 
a bit at a time. If you make a mistake, press Ctrl+Z (Ô+Z on the Mac) to 
reverse your last step. If you don’t catch a goof in time, work your way 
through the History palette one step at a time until you get back to the 
point where you want to resume erasing.
 
 A hard-edged eraser makes a good tool for working on straight edges 
(such as the top of the automobile), and a soft-edged eraser brush 
comes in handy for areas where you don’t have to be precise (such as 
the undercarriage). I didn’t need to be too precise around the underside 
of the car because I planned to blend that portion in with the road in the 
new background.
 
 You want to end up with an image that looks like Figure 12-19.
 
3. Copy the extracted object, and paste it in a second image.
 
 I selected an image of a rural roadway in southern Spain.
 
4. Sprinkle in special touches, as needed.
 
 The auto didn’t look like it belonged in this setting, so I added a few 
special touches:
 
• I darkened the underside of the car (especially in front) to make it 
look like the car was casting shadows on the ground around it.

245
 Chapter 12: Combining and Reorganizing Your Images
 
• Shadows from the surrounding trees were cast on the road, so 
I used Quick Mask mode to select some areas on the side (just 
beneath the side mirror) and darkened those areas to match the 
road shadows. I selected an area above the front wheel well (extend-
ing across the hood) and another on the back deck, and I lightened 
them, like the bright ray of sunlight was striking those surfaces.
 
• I used the Photoshop Lens Flare plug-in (choose Filters➪Render➪
Lens Flare) to add a bright glare to the rear quarter-window.
 
 
Figure 12-19: Extract the object carefully so that you can 
 
blend it in with its new background.
 
5. When all looks satisfactory in your image, flatten it (choose Layer➪
Flatten).
 
 I ended up with the version shown in Figure 12-20.
The pitfalls of compositing images
 
You might need to do a lot of work to make the merger of two images look 
realistic. The pasted-in objects must have similar texture and lighting, and 
you must show them from the proper angle and perspective. You can’t take a 
photo from a low angle on a cloudy day and paste an object from that image 
into a background taken from a higher angle on an overcast day. If you do, 
you get a less-successful result, like the atrocity shown in Figure 12-21.

246
Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
 
 
Figure 12-20: A successful composite requires a lot of work, but it’s 
 
worth it.
In this case, I started with the same automobile picture but decided to jazz it 
up a little. I copied the original car layer and painted the duplicate with vari-
ous colors, including red for the body and brown for the convertible top.
Then, I merged the colored layer with the original layer by changing the 
Blending Mode options in the Layers palette from Normal to Overlay. That 
change combines the colors in the top layer with the detail in the layer 
underneath.

247
 Chapter 12: Combining and Reorganizing Your Images
The car certainly looks sportier, but the scale is all wrong for the plaza it’s 
now set in. The angle of view is too high, and the lighting is wrong because 
I took the background image on an overcast day. Not my best effort, but it 
serves as an example of what not to do!
 
 
Figure 12-21: Something is wrong here; it looks like a cutout pasted 
 
onto a poster.
Getting creative with compositing
Don’t be afraid to experiment when combining images. You can create real-
istic composites, such as the one shown on the right in Figure 12-22, or com-
pletely preposterous fantasies, such as the one in Figure 12-23.
For the castle/moat photo, I added some clouds and then reversed the upper 
half of the photo to create a more vivid reflection in the moat. The Eiffel 
Tower on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea demonstrates what you can do 
if you have Photoshop and don’t know much about geography. The entire 
photo is a visual joke, so don’t e-mail me complaining that the reflections or 
shadows aren’t realistic!

Hard Copies Aren’t Hard
In This Chapter
▶ Someday, your prints will come
▶ Output options
▶ Choosing your printer
Years ago, some wise futurists predicted that digital photography would 
spell the end of photographic prints, just as the advent of word process-
ing, fax machines, text messaging, and e-mail would cause the Post Office to 
close its doors, overnight delivery services to go bankrupt, and manufactur-
ers of file cabinets to switch to more profitable products, such as personal 
aero-planes. If you believed these folks, you’d think that the paperless office 
would lead to the print-less home, and everyone would be doing their reading 
and photo viewing on computer monitors, TV sets, or cell phones.
People are doing much of their reading and photo viewing 
on those devices — especially cell phones. Okay, so the 
predictions weren’t totally bogus. But even so, modern 
society still creates tons of prints today because you 
can make those prints more easily than ever before 
at home or in the office, upload digital files to your 
local mega-mart for one-hour printing, or stop 
by a retailer’s handy kiosk to custom-print hard 
copies for about the same cost as those automated 
machine prints you could get from film back in the 
photography Dark Ages.
Even in an age when many people are snapping photos 
with their cell phones and uploading them directly to 
their Facebook pages, then sending tweets to all our friends 
to go take a look, technology has helped create brand-new uses 
for images. These are all add-on applications for photography, and the 
original need for hard copy prints continues. Electronic distribution of images 
has blossomed, but not at the expense of traditional applications for prints.
This chapter outlines some of your options and shows you that hard copies 
really don’t have to be hard.

250
Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
Prints? What Prints?
As you can find out in Chapter 16, some photo-sharing sites are geared for 
serious photographers. They display your prize images in sharp-looking gal-
leries, rather than the more amateur-oriented albums provided by consumer 
photo-sharing services. You can also display your images on your own Web 
pages, e-mail them to friends and colleagues, exchange them over instant 
messaging services, or array them into PowerPoint presentations. A photo-
graphic image can spend its entire life as bits and bytes, created by a digital 
camera and viewed only on a display screen.
But you probably don’t want to go that route for all your photos. Passing 
prints around and displaying framed photos on the wall or grand piano is 
one of the greatest joys of photography. Digital photography makes printing 
copies for distribution or festooning your furniture with frames easier than 
ever. Here are some very good reasons for making prints:
 
✓ Share with friends and family. Sharing is the traditional application for 
prints. Sure, you may look cool by passing around your smartphone at 
the family reunion and poking the touch screen while everyone crowds 
around to take a peek. But isn’t passing around a stack of prints that sev-
eral people can divvy up and enjoy individually or in groups a lot more 
convenient and fun?
 
✓ Display your work. Those LCD “photo frames” that feature a recy-
cling array of photos can dress up your piano or mantel, but making 
an 11-x-14-inch or bigger enlargement to frame and hang on the wall is 
much more satisfying (and, possibly, ostentatious, as you can see by the 
ornate frame in Figure 13-1).
 
✓ Sell yourself and your work. Many photographers are turning to digital 
portfolios, but when you want to have images available for viewing by 
prospective employers or clients, a print is still the best way to show off 
your work.
 
✓ Submit for approval. You have the job; now, you need to secure the 
approval of your boss or client. You could e-mail a low-resolution copy 
to the person passing judgment, assuming that person can view the 
image on a computer. Or you can print a fine-tuned proof that’s an accu-
rate representation of your image and use that print.
 
✓ Restore or re-create an existing photo. Not all digital prints need to 
originate from your digital camera. You may need to create a restored 
or enlarged copy of an existing print, with all the wrinkles and tears 
removed, and perhaps after you make improvements in your subject 
matter through judicious image editing. You may need only a scanner, 
inkjet printer, and an image-editing program.

251
 Chapter 13: Hard Copies Aren’t Hard
 
 
Figure 13-1: You can hang a print on the wall, but you have a hard time trying to frame a computer!
 
✓ Create camera-ready or for-position-only art. Most professional print-
ers today can work from digital files. However, you may want to have 
a print that you can paste into a layout, either for reproduction or to 
create a dummy that you can use for approval purposes.
 
✓ Make a teaser. My local newspaper prefers to receive submissions as 
high-resolution TIFF files on a CD. Even so, I always include a print or 
two of the shots that I want the editor to look at. A compelling print can 
bring my CD up to the top of the to-do pile.
You Pays Your Money, You Takes Your Choice
When it comes time to make a print, you need to choose between making it 
yourself, using an online service, or working with a local retailer/print lab. 
Oddly enough, with today’s technology, you can sometimes end up using all 
three methods with a single print order. You can, for example, upload digital 
images online to your local retailer and then trot down and pick prints while 
making a few yourself by using the lab’s kiosk.
Indeed, your choice of method for printing images isn’t so much an economic 
decision as it is one of convenience, flexibility, and control. You can use 
some options more easily than others. Some options let you do more things 
with your image before you print it. Others give you absolute control over 

252
Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
how your image looks. All of them end up costing roughly the same on a 
per-print basis, which is why many serious photographers use a mixture of 
methods.
Doing it yourself
If you’re serious enough about photography to be using a dSLR, you prob-
ably want a photo-quality printer close at hand so that you can run off prints 
when you need. Here are some considerations to take into account for the 
do-it-yourself approach:
 
✓ Equipment: You need to invest in a printer. Good photo printers can 
cost $100 to $300 or more, which isn’t a lot when you consider how 
often you’ll use the device over two or three years. High prices generally 
get you a large-format printer, capable of creating those gallery-worthy 
11-x-17-inch (or larger) jumbo prints. Better printers are always coming 
along, of course, so you might want to upgrade sooner. Factor in the 
price of the printer, as well as consumables, such as paper and ink, 
when you calculate the per-print cost of your hard copies.
 
✓ Speed: You can most quickly get a hard copy in your hands when you’re 
in a hurry by doing your own printing.
 
✓ Quality: When you become familiar with your printer’s operation, you 
can often tweak your images to look their best with your particular 
setup. The fine-tuning may take place in your image editor, or you may 
need to use the printer’s own controls.
 
✓ Flexibility: If you print your own images, you can use a larger variety of 
paper stocks than your local retailer may have available, make prints in 
odd-ball sizes, or print on both sides of a sheet (which you can do with 
some photo-quality printers that have duplexing capabilities, such as 
certain Canon Pixma models).
 
✓ Backup: Unless you have more than one color printer, you need your 
printer to stay healthy so that you can get your rush projects com-
pleted. Fortunately, if your printer fails, you can use one of the other 
printing options, or run down to the local Quik-E-Mart and buy a new 
printer for $50 or so. Remember to keep extra ink on hand!
Online output outsourcing options
The universe seems to be moving online. I’m sure that someday you’ll find 
remote digital cameras set up at key tourist spots, such as the Taj Mahal — 
sort of super-high-res Webcams, allowing you to take your vacation pictures 
without ever leaving home. About the only thing you can’t do through the 
Internet is take your dog for a walk.

253
 Chapter 13: Hard Copies Aren’t Hard
Meanwhile, you can order and distribute prints right from your computer. 
Snapfish (from Hewlett-Packard), Shutterfly, Kodak Gallery, and other sites 
have Web-based picture services that you can use to share and print your 
best efforts. Technically, you don’t even need a computer or digital camera. 
Kodak Gallery, for example, allows cell-phone users to phone in images that 
they snap and place orders for prints.
Here are some considerations for the online option:
 
✓ Need for speed: Your digital SLR photos are likely to be megabytes 
in size, even if you’re shooting in JPEG format. If you want to upload 
images from your computer to a Web service, you definitely need a 
broadband connection. Although most digital photographers have 
broadband at home and work, sometimes you can’t upload photos 
quickly, such as when you’re traveling.
 
✓ Honest-to-gosh photo prints: When you order digital prints online, you 
can receive hard copies made the old-fashioned way, using conventional 
photographic paper and chemicals. If you value the quality and poten-
tially extended longevity of traditional photo prints, online ordering is 
one way to get them. (You can also get real prints locally, as I explain in 
the following section.)
 
✓ Ordering prints for delivery: Online services make prints and mail them 
back to you or to a third party. So, you may find a Web-print service 
especially useful for sharing prints with folks back home when, say, 
you’re touring Paris and get a few minutes at un café de cyber. (Dozens 
of these cafes are in the City of Light, by the way, ranging from Jardin de 
l’Internet to Station Internet Rive Gauche.) A huge number of the hotels 
in the U.S. and overseas have either in-room wireless Internet access or 
a handy computer in the lobby that guests can use.
 
✓ Ordering prints to go: Retailers, such as Wal-Mart, let you upload 
images to their Web sites and specify pick-up at your local store. Your 
prints are usually ready by the time you get there.
 
✓ Economy and ease: If you don’t plan to edit your photos much (or the 
chore is already out of the way), you can’t beat the ease and economy of 
ordering prints online. Just upload, specify print sizes and other details, 
and pay as little as ten cents or so per print. What could be easier?
Live and in person!
If you like, you can trot down to your local retailer or professional photo lab 
to get your prints directly. This approach can combine some of the advan-
tages of making prints yourself and using an online service. For example, you 
can use a kiosk to perform cropping and some image editing, just like you 
can at home — even if you’re on vacation hundreds of miles from your own 
computer. And a lab geared up to produce quantity prints can create your 
pictures with speed and economy.

254
Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
Your in-person options range from 
using a standalone kiosk to view 
and print photos with the kiosk’s 
printer (such as the one shown in 
Figure 13-2), working with a kiosk 
that’s connected to the retailer’s 
digital photo lab, or handing your 
digital memory cards (or a CD that 
you burn) to a technician and leav-
ing everything up to him or her. 
You might find these services at a 
retail store, or avail yourself of a lab 
geared to serious amateur and pro-
fessional photographers. Either way, 
you walk in, get your prints made, 
and walk out (or sometimes, return 
to pick up your pictures later).
Considerations to think about when 
choosing this option include
 
✓ Compatibility: You don’t need 
to worry about having a broad-
band connection because 
retail locations accept your 
memory cards, USB thumb 
drives, CDs, DVDs, and other 
media. Digital SLRs generally 
use the universally accepted 
CompactFlash or Secure 
Digital (SD) cards, but if you 
happen to have some photos 
on a mini-xD or Sony Memory 
Stick Duo, find out in advance 
whether your chosen retailer 
can work with it.
 
✓ Choice of photo quality or 
printer quality output: Some retailers give you a choice of the type of 
output you receive. You can have a print made by using a kiosk’s built-
in printer, or direct your order to the store’s digital photo lab that uses 
conventional photographic paper and chemicals.
 
✓ Economy: Photo labs are geared to produce quantity prints. If you need 
a whole bunch of hard copies, a quick trip to your retailer almost always 
saves you money and time.

prints live and in person.

 Chapter 13: Hard Copies Aren’t Hard
Choosing a Printer
Digital SLR owners have only one special consideration when choosing a 
personal printer for their hard copy needs. As a serious photographer, you 
likely want really, really good prints to match the stunning images that you 
create with your sophisticated camera. As a result, just any old printer prob-
ably won’t do. You want a printer that’s especially good for outputting photo-
graphs, such as the snapshot photo printer, as shown in Figure 13-3.
 
 
Figure 13-3: Some printers do one thing — snapshots — and do it very well.
Fortunately, printer quality and flexibility have improved dramatically in the 
past few years. This section helps you choose the perfect printer.
Although, in the past, photo printers have included an array of competing 
technologies (including inkjet, dye-sublimation, thermal-wax, and even laser 
printers), inkjet printers are by far the most popular option today.
These models produce images by squirting tiny droplets of ink onto paper, 
using various methods to control the size and placement of the drops. For 
example, Epson uses piezoelectric crystals sandwiched between two elec-
trodes to vibrate the ink cartridge with different levels of voltage, causing 
the crystals to vibrate in ways that adjust the colors and the amount of color 
sprayed through a nozzle onto the paper. Other inkjet printing systems use 

256
Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
heat or other properties to control the flow of ink. With resolutions ranging 
from about 300 dpi (dots per inch) to 1,440 dpi and higher, inkjets can easily 
produce photo-quality images, assuming you use good-quality photo paper.
Current models run the gamut of features and prices, with many excellent 
models available from less than $100 to $300. To pay more than that, you 
probably need to buy a wide-carriage printer capable of handling paper wider 
than 8.5 inches. As a photographer, you may indeed want to make 11-x-14-
inch or larger prints. Features to look for are
 
✓ Size and design: Some printers hog your desk space or feature clumsy 
paper paths that require a lot of space behind or in front of the printer 
for the paper trays. A few printers weigh a ton, too. If a printer is so 
unwieldy that you can’t locate it near your computer, you end up doing 
a lot of walking or reaching to retrieve your printouts.
 
✓ Speed: Output speed is likely to be important to you only if you make 
a lot of prints and don’t like to wait. Some printers can be two or three 
times faster than others, so if speed is crucial (say, you’re toting your 
printer around to events to output prints for customers on demand), 
check your intended printer’s specifications carefully. Make a test print, 
too, because vendors use best-case figures for a printer’s specs, even 
though you probably end up printing under worst-case conditions.
 
✓ Number of inks: Most photo printers today use at least six colors of ink: 
black, cyan, magenta, yellow, photo cyan, and photo magenta. The two 
latter inks are “weak” versions that provide more subtle gradations of 
tone. A few printers add red and green tanks (see Figure 13-4), allowing 
the printers to create richer reds, additional orange tones, and more 
realistic greens. Some printers have both a photo black and text black 
ink. Generally, in terms of quality, the more ink tanks, the better. But you 
have to replenish those inks at a cost of $11 or so per tank. (Ink prices 
vary by brand and cartridge type.) If you have slightly lower quality 
needs, you may be able to get away with using a printer that has fewer 
colors. I have both a four-color inkjet (used for quick and dirty print-
outs) and an eight-color model (used for slow and exquisite output).
 
✓ Resolution: More resolution is usually better (some models provide 
1200-x-4800-dpi resolution), but the higher resolutions have some trade-
offs, such as the traditional gamut versus dot-size dilemma. More inks 
produce a larger range of colors, but printers that offer extra color 
depth often use larger ink droplets. So, a printer that has only six colors 
and outputs 1-picoliter droplets can produce more detail but fewer 
colors than a printer that has eight tanks and 2-picoliter droplets. High-
resolution printers that have tiny nozzles often suffer from clogging 
issues, too, and the special inks that they require may not have the same 
longevity.

✓ Paper handling: Some inkjet printers produce only 4-x-6-inch prints. 
They’re designed to output snapshots only, quickly and economically. 
Others let you print 5-x-7- or 8.5-x-11-inch prints, as well as other sizes. 
Investigate your printer’s ability to handle various paper stocks and 
thicknesses, too.
 
✓ Memory card access/PictBridge capabilities: A printer that has built-in 
memory card slots or a PictBridge-compatible camera-to-printer cable 
connection (as shown in Figures 13-5 and 13-6) are especially conve-
nient. Your digital SLR may allow you to specify images for printing 
right in the camera. Then, you insert your memory card in the printer’s 
slot or connect the camera to the printer by using a cable, and start the 
printing process.
 
✓ Duplex printing: You can use the ability to print on both sides of a sheet 
automatically for more than just creating text documents. If you’re pre-
paring an album or portfolio, you can print on both sides of the sheet by 
using special dual-sided photo paper and printers that have duplexing 
capability.
 
✓ Input/output trays: The input tray(s) hold the paper that you’re printing 
on; the output trays catch the finished prints when they come out. The 
higher the capacity of each, the better for you. One of my favorite print-
ers has a vertical 150-sheet input tray that doesn’t take up any space 
behind the printer and a second 150-sheet cassette that fits underneath 
the printer. I can put different types and sizes of stock in each — alter-
nating, say, between 8.5-x-11- and 4-x-6-inch sheets — or fill both with 
the same paper and print 300 sheets in a row. Your output tray should 
be large enough to catch all the prints that you make in a session with-
out spilling any on the floor.

Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
 
 
Figure 13-5: A memory card can go directly from your camera to the printer.
 
✓ Controls: Printers have a 
plethora of controls that can 
adjust every function, perhaps 
an LCD that you can use to 
preview images, and a keypad 
that you use to navigate menus 
and options. Others may have 
a power switch, a paper-tray 
select button, and little more, 
requiring you to control every 
parameter from your computer 
by using the printer driver. 
Each approach has its advan-
tages: You can use printers 
that offer you a lot of controls 
in portable or standalone mode 
without any computer attached 
(if those printers have memory 
card slots). Printers that rely 
heavily on the printer driver 
usually operate quickly and allow 
you to store groups of settings on 
your computer for reuse at any time.

Ten Ways to Improve Your 
dSLR Photography
In This Chapter
▶ Improving your lighting and angle
▶ Choosing your resolution, aperture, focus, and lenses
▶ Shuttering with anticipation
▶ Working with noise
▶ Understanding image editing, retouching, and compositing
▶ Reading the manual
E
ach chapter in this book is chock-full of tips that can help 
you improve the quality of your dSLR photos. Add them 
all to your shooting repertoire to put you well on the way 
to technical excellence and photo perfection. However, 
if you’re looking for the top ten techniques that can 
provide you with instant results, you can’t beat the 
collection of quality-enhancing approaches that I 
outline in this chapter.
Does Lighting Ever Strike Twice?
Yes, you can re-create good lighting if you know what 
you’re doing. And nothing can destroy a photo faster 
than bad lighting. You can make a lot of improvements 
to a challenging subject simply by using good lighting 
techniques.
Your uncle’s bald head, a teenager’s less-than-perfect complexion, a harshly 
lit beach scene, a drop of falling water — you can portray all these subjects 
attractively by using effective lighting techniques. In your uncle’s case, 
throwing the top of his head in shadow and avoiding shiny lights on his 
upper hemisphere can minimize the glare from his bare pate. The teenager 

262
Part V: The Part of Tens 
might benefit from diffuse lighting that softens the texture of his or her face. 
You can fix up that glaring direct sunlight on the beach by using a reflector to 
bounce light into the shadows. And you can freeze a drop of water in midair 
with a halo of light added by an electronic flash.
 
To use light effectively and take your photography to the next level, here are 
some tricks to master:
 
✓ Managing the quality of light: Light can be highly directional, or soft 
and diffuse. It can cast sharp shadows and dot your subjects with specu-
lar highlights. Light comes in different colors, too.
 
✓ Using multiple lights: Photographers create some of the best pictures 
by using two, three, four, or more lights. You can use one source to illu-
minate the main part of your subject and others to outline its edges, fill 
in the shadows, or call attention to a particular area. Photographers use 
some lighting arrangements often enough that those arrangements have 
their own names: broad lighting (shown in Figure 14-1), rim lighting, para-
mount lighting, and so forth. You can create other arrangements yourself.
 
 
Figure 14-1: A main light and fill light in the shadows was used to create this portrait.

263
 Chapter 14: Ten Ways to Improve Your dSLR Photography
 
 If you can master applying multiple lights so that they model and 
shape the appearance of your subjects, you have a powerful tool at 
your disposal.
 
✓ Making best use of a light source’s duration: Generally, electronic flash 
units are the main non-continuous light source that photographers put 
to work. Using the duration of the flash creatively requires practice and 
experience. Some techniques are simple. For example, you can use your 
flash’s brief duration (particularly when shooting up close) to freeze 
even the fastest action. For a more complex technique, use repeating 
flashes to trace movement or balance flash output with ambient light 
to create combination exposures. People have written entire books on 
these topics, so you have a lot to discover.
 
✓ Subtracting light: Sometimes, you don’t want to add light to a scene as 
much as you want to remove it so that you can create a particular light-
ing effect or look. Barndoors are little flaps that look like a horse’s blind-
ers and fit over an electronic flash or other light source to block the 
light or feather it onto a subject. Opaque sheets can block light coming 
from a particular direction, functioning as a sort of reverse reflector. 
Gadgets that stage-lighting directors call cookies or gobos can change 
the size and shape of a beam of light. With lighting effects, sometimes 
less is more.
Choosing a Righteous Resolution 
and Other Settings
Strictly speaking, the resolution of your digital SLR is the number of pixels 
captured — 4,288 x 2,848 pixels for the typical 12-megapixel model. Most of 
the time, the top resolution is the one that you want to select. However, as 
I discuss in Chapter 8, the file format that you choose can affect the sharp-
ness and file size of a digital image, too. You want to work with the overall 
sharpness — which is affected by resolution.
Some digital SLRs offer a choice of both compressed and uncompressed RAW 
files, perhaps a TIFF option (although this offering is increasingly rare), and 
several levels of JPEG compression. You can always select the highest resolu-
tion, least compressed, least processed image format. But if you answer “no” 
to any of the following questions, put some thought into your resolution/
format/settings decisions:
 
✓ Do you have unlimited memory card and hard drive space?
 
✓ Do you mind waiting while your pictures transfer to your computer?
 
✓ Do you want the ultimate in quality?
 
✓ Are you willing to spend at least some time with each shot in an image 
editor?

264
Part V: The Part of Tens 
These questions give you only some of the things that you have to think 
about. In the following sections, I explain some situations that call for special 
considerations.
Changing environments
You’re taking candid photos under conditions that vary abruptly and 
unexpectedly — say, at a concert or in a night club that has frequent lighting 
changes. Or you’re outdoors at sunset, and both the quantity and color of the 
illumination changes over the course of 10 or 15 minutes.
 
Although the high resolution that your camera’s RAW option affords has its 
value, in rapidly changing environments, place a higher premium on the RAW 
format’s ability to
 
✓ Adjust white balance and exposure after the fact.
 
✓ Apply noise reduction.
 
✓ Apply tonal curves.
Particularly when it comes to white balance, the manual changes that you 
make when the file is imported into your image editor are likely to be more 
accurate and more easily customized than the default or automatic settings 
that your camera applies. For details on how to correct these problems in an 
image editor, flip to Chapter 11.
Living with limited memory card space
You’re leaving for a two-week vacation, and you have three 2GB memory 
cards, want to leave your laptop at home, and don’t own one of those por-
table CD/DVD burners or hard-disk-based personal storage devices. None of 
the other options, such as uploading your shots to the Internet at a cybercafe 
or from your hotel’s lobby or in-room Internet service, seems attractive. You 
likely need to explore a resolution other than the highest RAW resolution. 
For example, the following list illustrates one possible scenario out of dozens, 
given a particular camera (the numbers vary, depending on what camera 
you use):
 
✓ At the highest RAW setting: Say this particular camera gets 246 shots 
per 4GB card, or about 18 shots per day over two weeks. You’d need to 
arm yourself with many, many memory cards and spend a good part of 
your vacation time swapping out used cards for empty ones.
 
✓ At the highest JPEG setting: That same camera gets 460 shots per 4GB 
card, or 33 shots per day over two weeks. So, at this setting, the camera 
gives you a more reasonable number of photos for a very slight loss of 
quality. But you still might not be able to get enough pictures per day 
for your two-week vacation, even if you have three 4GB cards.

265
 Chapter 14: Ten Ways to Improve Your dSLR Photography
 
✓ At the second-best JPEG quality: Say the 4GB card gets you 914 shots 
with this particular camera, or 65 shots per day. You see 65 shots per 
day as a more desirable number of pictures, but on this camera, this 
JPEG quality limits prints to sizes no bigger than 5 x 7 inches.
 
Your best solutions might be to pick up a fourth or even a fifth memory card. 
Or use your digital SLR’s second-best JPEG quality level for general shots, 
but switch to the highest JPEG quality level for any shots or sequences that 
you might want to enlarge beyond 5 x 7 inches. By using this approach, you 
can grab hundreds of snapshots for smaller prints but still come home with a 
good selection of higher-resolution photos for those special blow-ups.
Shooting for a low-resolution destination
You’re shooting a bunch of pictures for your eBay auctions or for display on 
a Web page, and the largest final image size that you need is about 640 x 480 
pixels. Most of the time, you want pixels and image quality to spare because 
you can crop and edit to your heart’s content before shrinking the original 
shot down to its finished size.
 
People sometimes capture auction or Web pictures by using fixed setups on 
a sort of photo assembly line with the same background and settings, and 
those picture don’t really need the maximum in resolution and sharpness for 
your main shots. In fact, all those extra pixels can slow you down. You might 
be better off shooting at a lower resolution, such as 1,600 x 1,200 pixels, 
to speed up the process. If you’re really careful in your choice of composi-
tion and lighting, you might even be able to get away with taking photos at 
something very close to their finished size (for example, 640 x 480 pixels), 
eliminating most post-processing altogether. Of course, the latest dSLRs (10 
megapixels and up) probably don’t have a resolution setting that low; 1,600 
x 1,200 pixel options may be available only on cameras that have a maximum 
resolution of 6 to 8 megapixels.
Hurrying along
The highest resolution/lowest compression settings take longer to store on 
your memory card and require extra time to transfer to your computer. The 
huge size of the best images can affect your shooting in several ways:
 
✓ When shooting bursts of continuous shots: Some digital SLRs slow their 
continuous shooting mode when they save images in RAW or RAW+JPEG 
modes. Rather than 3 to 5 frames per second (fps), you might be able 
to grab only 2 fps at the highest resolution. A camera that has a large 
internal buffer or a memory card with a fast write speed might help, but 
simply reducing the resolution or boosting compression might give you 
speedier bursts with little loss of quality.

266
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ When you transfer photos: You can usually transfer photos from your 
camera to your computer the fastest by using memory card readers. 
Some dSLR owners also depend on direct cable connections through a 
USB cable. Both card readers and cable connections might use the latest 
USB 2.0 specification or limp along with the slower USB 1.1 links. If you 
have a camera that uses SD memory cards, you can buy an Eye-Fi card 
that has built-in wireless capabilities, and then transfer photos directly 
to your computer over a wireless network while you shoot. The size of 
the file affects the speed of all these methods: A JPEG image might be 
only a few megabytes in size, whereas a RAW file can easily be 5MB to 
20MB or more. If you’re in a hurry — for instance, you’re covering a fast-
breaking news event for your local newspaper — you might find that a 
compromise in picture quality can save valuable time.
 
✓ When working on your computer: Huge image files take longer to load, 
longer to process in an image editor, and longer to save when you’re 
finished with them than smaller files. If you want to speed your image 
along to its final destination, such as your printer, smaller file sizes can 
be your friend.
Stop! What’s That Sound?
For the digital photographer, no sound is sweeter than the authoritative 
clicks that resound when you take a picture. Flipping mirrors and sliding 
shutter curtains mean that, once again, you capture your vision as digital 
bits. Then, reality sets in — did you use the right shutter speed?
A speed that’s too slow means any movement of the subject or the photog-
rapher’s hands can result in shaky, blurry photos. A speed that’s too fast 
might remove all sense of movement, creating a sports picture, for example, 
that might as well have pictured a statue. A speed faster than your camera’s 
electronic-flash sync speed might mean your picture shows a shadow of the 
focal plane shutter, rather than a complete frame. The right shutter speed 
when you take flash pictures can mean that ambient light in the background 
produces a pleasing effect, but the wrong speed can produce ghost images.
 
As a digital SLR photographer, you have the responsibility to use the 
enhanced powers and control at your disposal to optimize your photos, and 
that responsibility includes choosing a shutter speed that’s appropriate for 
the picture you want to create. Figure 14-2 shows how a combination of care-
ful timing and a slow 1/4-second shutter speed produced an image in which 
one of the ballet dancers is captured almost motionless, while the dancers 
around her are blurred creatively.

267
 Chapter 14: Ten Ways to Improve Your dSLR Photography
 
 
Figure 14-2: A tripod steadied the camera, but the slow shutter speed allowed the dancers to 
 
blur creatively.
Working the Right F-Stop
Mark Twain never said, “The difference between the right f-stop and the 
almost-right f-stop is like the difference between lightning and a lightning 
bug.” But he might have said that if he’d been a digital photographer.
Sometimes, stopping down one or two aperture settings or opening up one 
or two stops can make a world of difference, so choosing the right f-stop 
can be an important part of optimizing your finished picture. Here are some 
examples:
 
✓ A couple stops can boost sharpness. Lenses designed especially for 
their speed — say, a 28mm f/1.4 or a 400mm f/2.8 lens — are also 
designed to provide excellent sharpness when they’re wide open. 
However, most other optics are their sharpest when they’re closed 
down one or two f-stops from wide open. A 50mm f/1.8 prime lens or an 
80mm-to-200mm f/4-to-f/5.6 zoom lens that produces pretty good results 
at maximum aperture might excel with an aperture that’s two stops 
smaller.
 
✓ A few stops can help you stop camera or subject motion. Going the 
other way, the ability to open up an extra stop or two can do your pic-
tures a world of good if it lets you use a faster shutter speed. Try shoot-
ing a basketball game indoors at ISO 400 and settings of 1/60 of a second 
at f/5.6. Then, compare your results with similar pictures taken 1/250 of a 
second at a wider aperture, such as f/2.8. If the second set of images is 
carefully focused, the subjects are a lot sharper. It doesn’t matter that 

268
Part V: The Part of Tens 
your first batch of pictures has more depth-of-field (which I discuss in 
Chapter 6). You don’t even notice the depth-of-field because of the sub-
ject blur.
 
✓ A couple stops can stretch your depth-of-field usefully or trim it for 
creative effects. Especially when shooting macro (close-up) photos, 
when you have to deal with a sharply limited depth-of-field. Stopping 
down or opening up an f-stop or two can produce dramatically different 
results.
 
✓ Too small is as bad as too large. Shooting wide open costs you depth-of-
field and can impact lens sharpness, but using the smallest possible f-stop 
can be just as bad. After you stop down past f/8 or f/11, most lenses suffer 
from defraction, and any sharpness that you think you gain in depth-
of-field is lost to the resolution-robbing effects of too-small f-stops. It’s 
almost as if your image had a fixed amount of sharpness, and the smaller 
f-stop is simply spreading it out over a larger range of depth. In addition, 
small f-stops can accentuate the appearance of any tiny dust motes on 
your sensor that, at larger apertures, are fuzzy and virtually invisible.
Focus Is a Selective Service
Knowing how to use the right aperture to control depth-of-field is only half 
the battle. Also explore exactly how you can apply that depth creatively.
 
Improve your photography by casting a wide depth-of-field (DOF) net to 
capture a broad range of subject matter or focus on a specific object by nar-
rowing depth-of-field to a more selective range. Although you can use many 
different techniques to emphasize or de-emphasize parts of an image, you 
can easily master applying depth-of-field creatively, and this technique has 
almost unlimited potential.
 
Become familiar with the DOF characteristics of each of your lenses, their 
zoom settings, and their apertures. I’m not suggesting that you memorize all 
kinds of figures and distances. Just work with, say, your favorite zoom lens 
and use photos that you take or glimpses with the depth-of-field preview to 
know approximately the sharpness ranges. For example, observe the sharp-
ness at f/2.8, f/8, and f/16 when shooting close up (at 5 to 10 feet) and at infin-
ity, using 25mm, 50mm, or 100mm zoom settings. Then, you have a better 
handle on how focal length, aperture, and distance choices affect your shot 
before you frame a picture.
Playing the Angles
Good composition often involves playing all the angles — all of them. Don’t 
be satisfied with the different perspectives that you get with a 360-degree 

269
 Chapter 14: Ten Ways to Improve Your dSLR Photography
walk-around. Climb on a nearby 
rock or ladder, stand on a chair, 
or experiment with the view from 
a handy balcony. Or stoop low, lie 
on the ground, or get under your 
subject to see what a worm’s-eye 
view looks like. Everybody shoots 
flowers from above the blossoms; 
you can take a picture down at the 
flower’s level.
Choosing an offbeat angle can help 
solve creative challenges, too. 
When I went to shoot the Native 
American shown in Figure 14-3, I 
was dismayed by the unattractive 
background, which included canvas 
panels and bystanders. I laid down 
on the ground and shot upwards at 
my subject, simultaneously isolat-
ing him from the distracting back-
ground and visually enhancing his 
stature.
 
You might be surprised at how dif-
ferent everything looks from a new 
vantage point. Even hackneyed and 
clichéd subjects can take on new life if you choose the right angle. If you find 
yourself at a popular tourist location and all the people are clustered around 
a recommended picture spot while you’re flat on your back on the grass, 
you’re probably on the right track.
Through a Glass Brightly
There’s a reason why digital SLR photographers frequently succumb to a lens 
lust compulsion (the irrational need to add yet another interchangeable lens 
to one’s camera bag at the expense of luxury items, such as food or clothing).
As I discuss in Chapter 6, lenses are the most powerful photography tools at 
your disposal, so figure out how to leverage the capabilities of your optics, 
even if you own only the lens that came with your camera kit. That lens is 
likely to be a zoom, which makes it many lenses in one — so, even if your 
camera truly is a single-lens reflex, you can use a lot of capabilities that come 
built into your lenses. Here are some of the capabilities that lenses have:
Figure 14-3: Shooting from a low position 
isolated this subject from a distracting 
background.

270
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ Make subjects appear to be closer to the camera. Special macro lenses 
can capture life-size images of subjects from only a few inches away, 
but many non-macro zooms 
and prime lenses focus close 
enough to provide a large 
image, such as the one shown 
in Figure 14-4. The world of the 
close-up is one that’s worth 
exploring, whether you’re pho-
tographing flowers, insects, 
your stamp collection, or the 
texture of the rocks in your 
driveway. Even mundane 
objects gain interest when 
photographed up close.
 
✓ Bring distant things close. 
When you want to keep your 
distance from an erupting vol-
cano, capture images of timid 
wildlife from 50 yards away, or take soccer pictures from the stands that 
look like they were grabbed from the sidelines, a telephoto lens can do 
the job for you.
 
✓ Make close things appear farther away. When your back is up against 
the wall and you can’t squeeze everything you want into your image, a 
wide-angle lens can make your subjects back off to a more manageable 
distance.
 
✓ Flatter your portrait subjects. A short telephoto lens or zoom setting 
in the 85mm-to-105mm range (using 35mm equivalent focal lengths) 
provides a more flattering perspective of human subjects. Your vic-
tims will like the way their ears and noses don’t look out of proportion. 
Depending on the lens-cropping (multiplier) factor of your camera, this 
85mm-to-105mm range might be 53mm-to-65mm (with a 1.6X factor) to 
65mm-to-81mm (with a 1.3 factor). A full-frame dSLR has no factor at 
all, and you can use your 85mm-to-105mm lenses. (See Chapter 1 for an 
introduction to the lens-cropping effect.)
 
✓ Insult or distort your subjects. A wide-angle lens causes apparent dis-
tortion in portrait subjects, which you can use for comical effect. With 
nonhuman subjects, you can have some creative fun by enlarging things 
that are very close to the camera while providing a seemingly distorted 
perspective on objects only a small distance away.
 
✓ Compress distances. Telephoto lenses tend to compress the apparent 
distances between objects, so you can make those utility poles seem like 
they’re right on top of each other, or those approaching cars separated 
by 10 to 20 feet look like they’re cruising along bumper to bumper.
Figure 14-4: Getting closer to a subject than the 
normal view can bring a new perspective to the 
familiar.

271
 Chapter 14: Ten Ways to Improve Your dSLR Photography
 
✓ Manipulate depth-of-field. Telephoto lenses have less DOF at a given 
aperture, but wide-angle lenses have more. Choose your weapon, which 
decides the amount of depth-of-field that you have to work with.
Feel the Noize
If you’re old enough to remember Slade or Quiet Riot, you know that noize 
rocks — as long as you’re looking for a bit of multicolored speckly texture in 
your images. Like grain back in the film era, you can use a bit of digital noise 
in your images for artistic effect. Rather than avoid noise, you might want to 
enhance it. On the other hand, if you’re looking for a satiny smooth finish on 
your digital images, you might want to minimize noise. Fortunately, the tech-
niques for adding or avoiding noise involve the same sets of concepts:
 
✓ ISO setting: To increase the amount of noise in your photos, switch to 
a high ISO setting, such as ISO 1,600 or ISO 3,200. The higher the set-
ting, the more noisy speckles you see in your images. To decrease the 
amount of noise, use a lower ISO setting, such as ISO 100 or ISO 200.
 
✓ Exposure time: Longer exposures (from 1 second to 30 seconds or 
more) increase the amount of noise in an image when the sensor heats 
up and begins to register that heat as spurious image information. If you 
want to minimize noise, use a larger f-stop and shorten the exposure 
time.
 
✓ Software: Applications such as Photoshop CS4 or Photoshop Elements 
include Add Noise filters that you can use to spice up your photos with 
a little random grain (multicolored or monochrome, as you prefer). On 
the other hand, tools such as Noise Ninja (www.picturecode.com) can 
remove excess noise to a certain extent when you don’t want it. Chapter 
11 offers an introduction to using noise filters in an image editor.
Editing, Retouching, and Compositing Images
Sometimes, your best photographic techniques aren’t enough to create the 
image you want. There’s no shame in turning to an image-editing program to 
manipulate your photos.
 
High-quality image editors can perform three main kinds of modifications:
 
✓ Basic editing: This kind of work includes fixing colors and tonal values, 
rotating or resizing images or portions of images, adding textures and 
special effects by using filters, and other easy fixes.
 
✓ Retouching: If you’re looking to remove red-eye effects, soften bad 
complexions, delete unwanted artifacts or people, and make other 

272
Part V: The Part of Tens 
improvements to your images, you might want to delve into the realm of 
retouching.
 
✓ Compositing: With this kind of editing, you combine several images into 
one, move objects from one place to another in your photograph, add a 
more interesting background (see Figure 14-5), and create a brand new 
picture that might bear little resemblance to the originals.
 
 
Figure 14-5: Simple compositing techniques provide a more interesting sky background to this shot.
Of course, you can find a lot of overlap among what you can do with editing, 
retouching, and compositing — and sometimes, you may use all three when 
you work on a particular image.

273

In Chapter 11, you can find an introduction to image editing and image edi-
tors. For more complete details on applying these modifications by using a 
specific image editor, check out other For Dummies books, such as Photoshop 
CS4 All-in-One For Dummies, by Barbara Obermeier (Wiley).
Reading the Funny Manual (RTFM)
If you’re like me, you find the manual that comes with a digital SLR to be 
particularly unappealing when you first get the camera. The manuals are usu-
ally confusing, and you may find figuring out what you really need to know 
difficult. I’m always anxious to get shooting, and I’ve used enough different 
digital cameras that I can usually fumble my way through their operation 
without using the manual. While I familiarize myself with a dSLR for the first 
few weeks, I refer to the instructions only when I can’t figure out how to do 
some particular task.
 
However, any dSLR is a complex machine, and after you become comfort-
able with its basic operation, the manual that perplexed you so much at first 
suddenly makes a lot of sense. You can find tricks that you never thought of 
(“Oh, I can reformat a memory card by pressing these two buttons simultane-
ously!”) and capabilities that you didn’t even know existed (“The depth-of-
field button is where?”).
So, the best advice I can give you for becoming an expert in the use of your 
particular digital SLR is that, eventually, you want to Read the Funny Manual.

Ten Things You Never Thought of 
Doing with Your Digital SLR
In This Chapter

▶ Playing with light
▶ Using time to your (photographic) advantage
▶ Making do-it-yourself effects
▶ Saturating your colors
▶ Going nuts with image editors
A
nybody can take a digital SLR, point it at something inter-
esting, and come back with a good photo. It takes a 
genu-wine second-degree black belt photo master to turn 
the mundane into something special. One way to add 
excitement to your humdrum photos is to apply some 
techniques that you probably never even thought of. 
This chapter provides a quick introduction to ten 
cool techniques.
Capturing the Unseen with 
Infrared Photography
If you’re looking for a new type of photography to play 
with, infrared imaging with digital cameras can easily 
become your new playground. By ignoring visible light and 
capturing subjects solely by the infrared light they reflect, you can 
picture the unseen — in more ways than one. That’s because, thanks to the 
magic of the digital SLR, you likely have to shoot blind. The same techniques 
that shield your sensor from visible light also keep you from seeing anything 
through the viewfinder. Fortunately, workarounds exist.

276
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Infrared photography lets you render foliage in eerie shades of white and the 
sky in an unearthly black color. Human skin takes on a soft, fuzzy glow. You’ll 
either love or hate the effects.
First, get your camera set up for infrared photography. Because digital 
camera sensors are highly sensitive to infrared illumination, most camera 
vendors try to filter this light out by placing a filter called a hot mirror in front 
of the sensor. Some hot mirrors are more effective than others.
 
You can test your dSLR for infrared compatibility by taking a picture of a 
TV remote control pointed at the camera in a darkened room with a button 
depressed. If a spot of light shows up in your image, your camera is sensitive 
to infrared light.
After you know whether your camera can take infrared photos, following 
these steps can help you get started:
 
1. Get yourself a filter that blocks visible light while letting the infrared 
illumination through.
 
 I like the Hoya R72 filter, but other photographers have reported suc-
cess with Wratten #87, #87C, #88A, and #89B filters.
 
2. Set up your camera on the tripod, compose your image, and then 
place the infrared filter on the lens.
 
 Unfortunately, after you place the filter on your camera, the view 
through your finder is completely black.
 
 Infrared exposures are likely to be very long (up to several seconds in 
duration), so be sure to use a tripod.
 
3. Set your white balance manually (check your camera’s user guide to 
see how to do this) by using a subject that reflects a lot of infrared.
 
 Grass is a good choice.
 
4. Take a few pictures by using manual exposure.
 
 I recommend using a small f-stop because the infrared focus point isn’t 
the same as for visible light, and your autofocus mechanism doesn’t 
work when the filter is in place anyway. Small f-stops lead to even longer 
exposures, but your tripod keeps the camera steady. Start with an expo-
sure of 0.5 to 1 second, and then double the exposure time for each 
successive picture. You might be able to see an image on your camera’s 
LCD after the shot and gauge exposure that way.
Initially, your infrared (IR) images will be highly tinged with red. Set your 
color balance manually, using a subject such as grass that reflects a lot of IR, 

277
 Chapter 15: Ten Things You Never Thought of Doing with Your Digital SLR
to make the red tinge vanish, as shown in Figure 15-1. (Your camera’s guide-
book will tell you how your particular model sets manual color balance.) Play 
around with your pictures in your image editor to adjust brightness, con-
trast, and color. (Chapter 11 introduces how to make these adjustments by 
using an image editor.)
 
 
Figure 15-1: Infrared shots can produce an eerie color scheme.
Lighting for All in Tents and Purposes
One of the challenges of shooting close-up pictures of small objects is provid-
ing even lighting. You can arrange one or two (or even more) lights but might 
end up with unsightly shadows, harsh illumination, and reflections. There are 
better ways to create even lighting.
 
Pros use handy setups, called tents, to provide soft, even illumination for 
their close-up pictures. Tents are exactly what they sound like — tent-like 
arrangements of translucent material, such as cloth, arranged to cloak your 
item so that you can illuminate it from all sides through the covering. Just 
remember to leave a hole big enough for your lens to shoot through!

278
Part V: The Part of Tens 
You can make a tent out of coat-
hangers, bed sheets, or more 
elaborate devices. Plastic friction-fit 
plumbing pipes and joints make a 
good skeleton for tents of many sizes. 
You can assemble such a tent and 
tear it down on a moment’s notice.
 
For small objects, you can make a 
free-standing tent, such as the one 
shown in Figure 15-2, out of a trans-
lucent plastic milk bottle. I cut off 
the bottom so that I could fit the tent 
over the object I was photographing, 
and I removed the spout and enough 
plastic from the neck to insert my 
dSLR’s macro lens. I can illuminate 
my milk-bottle tent from all sides and 
create a soft, even lighting effect, like 
the one shown in Figure 15-3.
Turning Your dSLR into 
a Pinhole Camera
You probably paid at least a few hun-
dred dollars for the lens mounted on 
your dSLR right now. How would you 
like to play with a “lens” that costs 
you, maybe, five bucks? Now you, 
too, can turn your digital SLR into a 
pinhole camera by using the tech-
nique I explain in this section.
If you come to digital cameras from the 
film world, you might be way ahead 
of me. You likely experimented with 
pinhole cameras when you figured out 
exactly how cameras produce images. 
You can also use digital cameras as pin-
hole cameras. All you need is a pinhole!
An easy way to create a pinhole “lens” is to poke a hole in a body cap and attach 
it to your camera instead of a lens. (You might have to buy a real body cap if 
your camera came with a cheap plastic translucent cover instead.) The body cap 
already has a flange that fits your digital SLR’s lens mount. Find the center of the 
cap and cut a hole in the center. You probably cut a too-large hole: the smaller 
Figure 15-2: Cut up a gallon milk bottle to 
create a tent for shooting small objects.
Figure 15-3: Small porcelain figurines, coins, 
and other shiny objects are often best 
photographed inside a tent.

279
 Chapter 15: Ten Things You Never Thought of Doing with Your Digital SLR
and more precisely you make your pinhole, the 
sharper your pictures.
So, cover the hole you made with a piece of 
metal, as shown in Figure 15-4. Then, poke a tiny 
hole in the metal. I used a piece of aluminum 
foil that I pierced with a sewing needle, but you 
can use a piece cut from a cookie sheet or other 
thin metal — the thinner the better. If you have a 
hobby hand drill that includes tiny bits, you can 
probably cut a precise hole in the metal sheet. 
Experiment with several different sizes until you 
get one that produces the sharpest image.
After you mount your pinhole lens, you can look through the viewfinder and 
see a fuzzy, dim image. If you have extension tubes, you can try mounting one 
between your camera body and your pinhole lens to change the focal length 
of the lens. The f-stop of the pinhole is so small that you don’t have to worry 
about focusing after you establish the correct distance away from the sensor 
to mount the pinhole. Virtually everything is in focus.
Of course, your aperture is so small that you have to mount the camera on a 
tripod and shoot time exposures, even in bright daylight. Figure 15-5 shows 
an image exposed for three seconds at f-whatever, using my own pinhole rig. 
(Actually, a quick calculation based on the normal exposure times in bright 
daylight, I’d estimate that my pinhole is approximately f/256!) I always use 
manual exposure to make my pinhole pictures. If you’re using your camera’s 
meter, you might need to cover the viewfinder eyepiece to keep extraneous 
light from venturing inside and affecting the metering system.

Warping Time with Time-Lapse Photography
Time-lapse photography is a great way to show a flower unfolding, the sun 
marching across the sky, the process of building construction, and (over the 
course of a year) the change of seasons. You can take time-lapse photos in 
two ways. One of them is pretty easy, works only with some dSLR cameras, 
and might require special software. You can use the other way with any 
dSLR, don’t need any special gadgets or applications, and have to put in a 
whole lot of work.
The easy way usually requires tethering your camera to a computer through 
a USB cable and working with software that can automatically trigger the 
camera to take a picture at intervals. The Nikon and Canon dSLRs have 
applications that can take time lapse photos for you.
The images automatically download to the computer when the camera takes 
them, so you can take many more pictures in sequence than you could fit on 
a single memory card. Connect your dSLR to an AC power source because 
even cameras that use very little juice eventually deplete their batteries if 
you leave them on and connected to a computer for hours at a time. (Your 
dSLR uses much more power when linked to a computer than when operating 
in standalone mode.)
The other way to shoot time-lapse photos calls for more effort on your 
part. You don’t need any special software, nor do you need to connect your 
camera to a computer. Instead, you can use a digital tool (the index digit of 
your right hand) to trigger each picture. Set your camera on a tripod and 
press the shutter release (or use a remote-control/cable release) to take a 
picture at the interval you select. You may find this process tedious, and it 
actually works best for long-term sequences, such as construction progress 
pictures or the changing seasons shots shown in Figure 15-6, which shows 
the same river bend in winter (top) and summer (bottom).
 
To take a series of photos, you need to set up your camera in the exact same 
spot at intervals. You can most easily position your camera in the same spot 
every time by mounting the camera on a tripod and recording the height of 
the legs, the extension of the center pole, and the tilt and angle of the tripod 
head. Then, note the position of the tripod legs on the supporting surface. 
(The easiest way to do this is to remove your camera from the tripod when 
you’re done shooting, and take a picture of the tripod itself and its surround-
ings.) By using this information, you can repeat your setup any time you want 
and take a series of pictures over the course of a few days or even a year. Be 
sure to use the same lens or zoom setting for each photo, too!

Expanding Your Creativity 
with Slow Shutter Speeds
Ordinarily, photographers consider blurry images a bad thing. When I use a 
shutter speed that’s so slow my subjects are rendered as a big blur, I tend to 
say something like, “Oh, I meant to do that! I was showing the fleetingness of 
time against the backdrop of our fast-paced society.” Yeah, that’s the ticket.
On the other hand, you can get some interesting images by using a slow 
shutter speed if you allow some portions of your image to blur while other 
portions remain razor-sharp. The classic application of this concept is the 
photograph of the babbling stream, with the woodsy surroundings rendered 
in sharp detail, while the flowing water merges into a ghostly blur, as you can 
see in Figure 15-7.
The secret, of course, is to mount the camera on a tripod and use a slow 
shutter speed. Anything that moves is blurred, but the stationary surround-
ings are, in contrast, very sharp. You aren’t limited to waterfalls and streams. 
Street scenes shot with long exposures typically feature blurry car headlights 
and tail lights, which can add some foreground interest.
 
If you look around, you can find a lot of subjects that you can make more inter-
esting if you let them blur a little. Be sure to mount the camera on a tripod. Try 
different shutter speeds, reviewing your results on your dSLR’s LCD until you 
find the speed that produces the effect you want. Use Shutter Priority mode, 
and select a range of speeds, from 1/30 of a second to about 1 second.
 
 
 Figure 15-7: With a slow shutter speed, 
moving objects blur, but stationary objects 
are sharply rendered.

283
 Chapter 15: Ten Things You Never Thought of Doing with Your Digital SLR
Capturing an Instant in Time 
with Fast Shutter Speeds
Some subjects move so quickly that the human eye normally could never 
observe them. However, a very fast shutter speed can freeze a moment in 
time. Falling water, a breaking light bulb, a bullet penetrating an apple, and 
other events that are over in an instant lend themselves to hyper-freezing 
techniques. Figure 15-8 shows the ripples and splashes produced by a drop 
of water landing in a glass. I illuminated it by placing an electronic flash off 
to the left and triggering an exposure manually. This method involves a lot of 
trial and error, but when you use a digital camera, you can easily take 30 or 
40 pictures to get the exact one you want.
 
 
Figure 15-8: A tiny-fraction-of-a-second exposure can freeze the quickest action.
Most digital SLRs have shutter speeds of at least 1/4000 of a second; some have 
speeds of 1/8,000 to 1/16,000 of a second. You can get even briefer shutter speeds 
by taking advantage of the fleeting duration of an electronic flash unit when 
you use it in Close-Up mode. Many strobes wink on and off in as little as 1/50,000 
of a second when you use them up close. That’s because only a very quick 
flash is needed to properly expose an image from that range, but you can use 
the effect to stop action.
 
If you want to try freezing action by using an electronic flash, use one that you 
can operate off-camera, connected with a cable. Or try mounting your camera 
on a tripod, darkening the room, and shooting a bulb exposure. During the 
exposure, trip the flash manually by pressing the Test button. Because the room 
is dark, the camera uses only the illumination from the flash for the exposure.

Making Your Own Effects Filters
Believe it or not, filters were originally something you put on the front of your 
lens — not a plug-in mini-application in image editors, such as Photoshop. 
Certainly, software filters can duplicate many of the effects of their glass 
or gelatin real-world counterparts, but you don’t have to abandon the joy 
of using real, actual filters on your lens. You can find a lot of special effects 
tricky to duplicate in an image editor, such as polarization to remove reflec-
tions or split-filter gradients to even out the bright sky and dim foreground.
 
You don’t even have to pay for special effects filters. You can make your 
own. Manufacture them out of ordinary, fairly useless filters (such as skylight 
or ultraviolet filters), or better yet, purchase a Series x adapter ring. Series 
adapter rings come in various sizes to suit the front filter diameter of your 
lens, with the x replaced by the number of the ring suitable for your lens, 
such as Series V, Series VI, Series VII, or Series VIII.
A Series x adapter ring comes in two parts. One part has a thread that screws 
into the front of your lens. The second part screws into the first part, usually 
with a filter of your devising between the two, forming a little sandwich of 
two metal rings and your custom filter inside.
The Roman numeral designations show the relative size of the ring set. For 
example, Series IX rings are sized to fit lenses with filter threads of 72mm, 
77mm, and larger. Series VIII rings are good for lenses with 62mm to about 
67mm filter threads. You can purchase step-up and step-down adapters so 
that you can use, say, a Series IX ring on a lens with a 62mm thread. Mounting 
a larger ring on a smaller lens thread is always better — and make sure the 
rings don’t cause vignetting (darkening) in the corners of your image (which 
you may find a particular problem if you use a wide-angle lens).
 
Here are some ideas for special effects filters that you can create on your own:
 
✓ Starry night: Use a piece of window screen cut to fit the Series rings 
to create a star filter that transforms each pinpoint of light into a star 
effect.
 
✓ Color your world: Cut a piece of gelatin filter material into a circle to fit 
in the Series ring to create a color filter.
 
✓ Color your world times two: Use two pieces of filter material of different 
colors to create a split-color filter. For example, you can use orange-red 
on top to give the sky a sunset color and blue on the bottom to add cool 

285
 Chapter 15: Ten Things You Never Thought of Doing with Your Digital SLR
tones to the foreground. The 
(expensive) filters of this type 
that you can buy have a smooth 
gradient between the colors, 
but a quick-and-dirty split filter 
approach can work, too.
 
✓ Life’s a blur: Smear the outer 
edges of a piece of round glass 
(or another filter) with petro-
leum jelly to create a romantic 
blur filter. This method is great 
for portraits of females, and 
teenagers who have complexion 
problems.
 
✓ Feature your filters: Try shoot-
ing through a feather or other 
textured material to create 
interesting effects.
Figure 15-9 shows some of these filters.
Shooting the Works!
You don’t have to wait until Independence Day to shoot fireworks. People 
commemorate a lot of other events and celebrations, including baseball 
games and auto races, with an aerial display. Perhaps you avoid shooting 
fireworks because you think capturing skyrockets in flight is too difficult. Or 
maybe you just want to watch the show, rather than fiddle with your camera. 
I’m here to tell you that you can do both!
 
The secret to shooting fireworks is to do a little planning. Here are some tips:
 
✓ Choose your spot. You can position yourself up close and capture the 
display from underneath the exploding canopy, or get farther back and 
shoot the fireworks against a skyline. Both approaches work great. What 
you don’t want is a view that’s obstructed by buildings, trees, or very tall 
fellow observers.
 
✓ Use a tripod. Set your camera on a tripod so that it remains rock-steady 
during exposures that can last several seconds.
Figure 15-9: Create your own star filter (upper-
left), smudgy portrait filter (upper-right), or 
split-field color filter (bottom).

286
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ Check it out. Take a few pictures 
at the beginning of the display 
and evaluate them to make sure 
your exposures are reasonable. 
Try two to three seconds at f/8 
for starters. Focus on infinity!
 
✓ Go long. Use longer exposures 
to capture multiple bursts in one 
frame, as shown in Figure 15-10.
 
✓ Shoot RAW. Use your dSLR’s 
RAW option so that you can 
adjust exposure and other param-
eters as the image is imported 
into your photo editor.
 
✓ Don’t use noise reduction. If your camera kicks into Noise Reduction 
(NR) mode automatically, disable that mode. Don’t manually activate 
NR, either. The extra time required to create the noise reduction “dark 
frame” can cause you to miss the next blast-off. Even a several-second 
exposure still looks good without this extra step.
 
✓ Enjoy the show. After you set up your camera and frame an area of the 
sky where you expect the bursts to appear, just watch the display with-
out peering through the viewfinder. Trigger your shots by pressing the 
shutter release button, or by using a remote control or cable release (if 
you can use one with your dSLR).
Going for Baroque
Normally, you want to set your camera’s controls so that you get the best-
exposed, most realistic image. However, at times, you might want to go for 
baroque and get a really over-the-top image right in the camera. Simply adjust 
your settings to get some off-the-wall results. Of course, if you shoot RAW, you can 
manipulate your images when you import them to your image editor to get much 
the same effects, but adjusting the camera’s controls is faster and repeatable.
Here are some techniques to try:
 
✓ Boost saturation/change the hue. Set your camera’s color saturation 
controls to the max to generate rich, unrealistic colors. Film photogra-
phers favored Kodak Ektachrome films for this very reason, and digital 
shooters can do the same thing electronically. Increasing saturation can 
Figure 15-10: A long exposure can capture 
multiple bursts.

287
 Chapter 15: Ten Things You Never Thought of Doing with Your Digital SLR
also provide good color on dull, overcast days. Or you can go overboard 
and really pump up the color richness while manipulating hues to create 
an otherworldly effect, as shown in Figure 15-11.
 
✓ Enhance contrast. Your dSLR probably has a contrast control intended 
to give you acceptable images of low-contrast subjects, but you can 
subvert that control to produce high-contrast results of normal subjects. 
You lose detail in highlights and shadows, but that’s what you go for 
when you use this effect.
 
✓ Add grain. High ISO ratings can add unwanted noise to your images — 
except when you want the noise because of a creative decision. Crank 
your camera’s sensitivity up all the way and then experiment. In bright 
light, you generally have to use high shutter speeds, small apertures, or 
both, but most digital SLRs can shoot photos on the beach at high noon 
at ISO 1,600, even if it means using 1/4,000 of a second at f/16, or neutral 
density filters to cut down on the amount of light reaching the sensor.

to produce an off-beat look.

Going Crazy with Your Image Editor
Many digital SLR users have more 
experience fiddling with images 
in Photoshop than they do taking 
pictures with a dSLR. After all, 
Photoshop has been around since 
1990 and was an excellent tool for 
modifying scanned film images long 
before digital cameras began hitting 
their stride a decade later.
So, you probably have no fear of image 
editing — and you might, in fact, be 
striving to create an image that’s as 
close to your vision as possible in the 
camera in order to reduce the time 
you spend in post-processing.
All the more reason to take your image editor to its limit and work on special 
effects that unleash your creativity, such as the kaleidoscope effect in 
Figure 15-12. The image was created by adding a flipped top half of the photo, 
producing a mirror image on the bottom.
Figure 15-12: Every picture tells a story, but 
you can spice up even the best story with 
editing.

O
ne of the advantages of using a digital SLR is that, in terms of new ideas, 
new techniques, new applications, and new add-on gadgets, the sky’s 
the limit. Certainly, an imaginative photographer finds it 
challenging to wring every last bit of potential out of a 
non-SLR digital camera, and he or she can spend years 
doing so. But if the possibilities of an ordinary point-
and-shoot camera are vast, the tricks that you can 
do with a digital SLR are easily twice as vast. The 
expandability and versatility of a dSLR mean that 
you have no excuse for doing things in a half-vast 
way (ahem).
One tool that you want to avail yourself of is the Internet, 
with its unlimited treasure trove of ideas, showcases for 
your photos, equipment tests, and places to buy or sell dSLRs, 
lenses, and accessories. This chapter gets you started by introducing ten of 
the best online resources. (Although I give only ten resources the full-feature 
treatment, I sprinkle in a couple bonus sites here and there.)
 
I provide all the links here, but you don’t have to go to the trouble of typing 
them into your browser. Instead, go to www.dbusch.com/dslrlinks.htm, 
where you can find a page full of clickable links for these sites and many more.

If you want to upload your images to a photo-sharing site, check out Adobe’s 
Photoshop.com Web service, shown in Figure 16-1. If you travel and want to 
be able to edit your photos online by using nothing more complicated than a 
Web browser, definitely add Photoshop.com to your short list. And, if you rely 
on Photoshop Elements 7.0 (or later versions) as the image editor for your 
computer, Photoshop.com is a must-have. You can find other photo-sharing 
sites and other tools that let you edit photos online, but none of them inte-
grate so tightly with Elements, and few are as adept at linking with your exist-
ing Flickr, Facebook, Photobucket, and Picasa accounts as Photoshop.com.

 Chapter 16: Ten Online Resources for Digital SLR Photography
A ton of image-hosting sites out there let you upload your photos to a Web page 
album so that anyone who has access to the Internet can view them. However, 
most of these sites are aimed at consumers, not serious photographers. You 
might receive limited album and image size, and you may find the things that 
you can do with the albums confined to a few levels of sharing (meaning that 
you might be able to share with everyone in the world, with a fixed list of users, 
or only by invitation). These sites can help you share a few pictures online and 
perhaps order some prints, personalized calendars, or photo coffee mugs.
PBase has become wildly popular for a good reason: It goes well beyond the 
album sites to provide true online photo galleries — and a lot more besides. 
Here’s a sampling of the features:
 
✓ Explain your settings. You can specify that you want the EXIF (image 
data) parameters of each photograph available to viewers, so other pho-
tographers can see the settings you used to create a particular picture.
 
✓ Search by keywords. A search engine enables visitors to look for 
photographs — including yours — by using specific keywords.
 
✓ Upload batches of photos at the same time. You can upload batches 
of photos that you’ve compressed into archives (such as .zip files) to 
save time. (Most of the album sites ask you to upload non-zipped photo 
files individually and limit you to five to ten images.)
 
✓ Link galleries. You can link galleries that you create. So, if you start a 
gallery that shows off your sports photos, you can subdivide it into foot-
ball, baseball, tennis, or other appropriate categories.
 
✓ Link your photos to other forums. If you frequent any of the various 
online discussion forums, such as those shown in Figure 16-2, you can 
link directly to your photos.
 
 Many compatible sites can display PBase photos right in your postings, 
with buttons that allow you to zoom in and out.
PBase is even a terrific information 
resource. It publishes a magazine 
compiled entirely from the efforts 
of members. The premiere issue 
highlighted the work of two photogra-
phers and provided some useful tips 
on sensor cleaning.
Of course, something this good isn’t 
free. You can check out PBase for 30 
days with 10MB of online disk stor-
age. If you like it, a hefty 500MB of 
storage (enough for more than 2,000 
images of an average 250 KB size) 
Figure 16-2: Forums in PBase are devoted to 
topics such as digital cameras.

costs $23 a year (less than $2 a month) at the time of this writing. If you need 
1,500MB of online space, that’s $60 a year, and you can add more storage in 
500MB increments for a reasonable cost.

advanced photographers, check out SmugMug (www.smugmug.com), too.

An incredible free resource is Digital Photography Review (usually called 
just DPReview). DPReview is a top-notch site for information about any 
digital SLR camera. A British chap named Phil Askey still publishes this site 
with help from a knowledgeable staff, thousands of avid fans, and visitors. 
Amazon.com purchased this site, but it remains an unbiased resource that 
has evaluations and buying tips for retailers other than the parent company. 
Phil has recently added new reviewers and technicians to beef up the content.
It’s no exaggeration to say that I spend a minimum of 30 minutes at this 
site virtually every day of the year. Here are the kinds of useful features at 
DPReview that can keep you coming back for more:
 
✓ User forums: You can find individual forums for all the key digital SLR 
cameras (as well as non-dSLRs) from Canon, Nikon, Sony, Pentax, Kodak, 
Fuji, and Sigma. Topics such as Canon SLR Lens Talk, Nikon SLR Lens 
Talk, Lighting, Storage and Media, and Retouching even have their own 
separate forums. Those who own a particular camera model can enjoy 
the specialized forums for groups of cameras, including subcategories 
for each of the major Nikon, Canon, Pentax, Sony, and Olympus product 
lines. Even with all these subdivisions, most of the forums have hun-
dreds of fascinating posts a day. I spend most of my time on this site just 
trying to keep abreast of the interesting discussions.
 
✓ Camera comparisons: The site has separate pages for each digital 
camera vendor. Each of these pages lists all the most recent models, 
including complete specifications for every camera and links to reviews. 
For example, the Nikon page lists dozens of different Nikon models in 
detail and links to another dozen or so discontinued models. You can 
compare the features of cameras from different vendors, too, as shown 
in Figure 16-3.
 
 Use this trove of information to compare cameras. For example, if you 
want to know the sensor size of the Canon Digital Rebel XTi compared 
to that of the Nikon D40x, simply retrieve that information with a couple 
clicks.

✓ Comprehensive reviews: The DPReview evaluations of cameras and 
lenses are among the most complete and thorough available on the 
Internet. For example, the review of one recent Nikon dSLR is 26 pages 
long and includes a description of every feature, screen shots of each 
menu, tests, sample images, and an evaluation of the software that 
comes with the camera. You can even listen to the sound the shutter 
makes if that’s important to you. These reviews don’t appear the instant 
a camera comes on the market, but they’re worth waiting for.
 
✓ Daily news updates: The main page provides a listing to the main digi-
tal photography news stories of the day and more than a few rumors. 
You can find information such as notices of the latest firmware updates 
for your camera, new product introduction announcements, and other 
breaking stories.
 
✓ An online glossary: Wonder what bokeh is? You can find a glossary on 
the DPReview site that explains this term — and just about any other 
photography term that you care to look up.

As I write this, DPReview has already passed one billion visitors since it began 
keeping track in January 1999. You should jump on the bandwagon, too.
For the Shutterbug in You
www.shutterbug.net
If you’re an old-line photographer, someone who was a serious photo hob-
byist back when people had to use something called film, you may appreci-
ate the full-spectrum viewpoint provided by this venerable resource. It’s an 
online adjunct to Shutterbug magazine and, as such, covers digital photography 
in depth, as well as recent and classic film cameras, photo techniques, and 
other topics of interest.
Like DPReview, Shutterbug’s strength lies in its forums, which (like the 
magazine and main Web site) span a broad range of interests. You can find 
forums dedicated to Nikon, Canon, Pentax, Olympus, and Sony digital SLRs. 
Shutterbug also offers several forums for the film SLR counterparts (always a 
good source for information about compatible lenses and accessories), along 
with forums for inkjet, dye sublimation, and traditional silver halide printing. 
You can also find forums about color management, lighting and exposure, 
and collectible cameras.
Whereas DPReview’s product evaluations are mostly devoted to digital cameras 
and lenses, Shutterbug looks at all kinds of items, including equipment bags, gad-
gets, books, and photo shows. You can find interesting monthly columns, too.
Pop Goes the Photo!
www.popphoto.com
Popular Photography & Imaging magazine has been the most authoritative 
resource for serious amateur photographers for longer than most of us have 
been alive. The addition of a Web site as a supplement to the magazine’s cov-
erage and increasing emphasis on digital photography prove that venerable 
doesn’t have to equal stodgy or old-fashioned. PopPhoto.com remains as 
up-to-date as the latest digital camera, and most of the time, it’s several steps 
ahead of the technology in its predictions. (In the interest of full disclosure, 
I should point out that I’m a contributor to Popular Photography & Imaging 
from time to time — but I’ve been a subscriber and avid reader ever since I 
was in high school.)

295
 Chapter 16: Ten Online Resources for Digital SLR Photography
 
The PopPhoto.com Web site’s strength is its authoritative voice when it 
comes to the technology. The editors really, really understand all the finer 
points of digital and conventional photographic imaging, and their lab tests 
of equipment are unmatched. When you read the performance figures on 
various lenses or other equipment, you have information at your fingertips 
that you can use to go out and make purchases with confidence.
Nowhere else can you find solid information available in such depth. Can a 
24.5MP digital SLR produce better results than a fine-grain ISO 100 film? What 
are the seven most significant breakthroughs in tripod design? What are 
some of the best photos taken in the last year? The answers are all available 
at PopPhoto.com. The site offers forums, of course, but it also provides a lot 
of tips and tricks, how-to’s, workshops, and videos.
Landscapes Can Be Luminous
www.luminous-landscape.com
Calling The Luminous Landscape a Web site devoted to landscape and nature 
photography is a little like calling the Encyclopaedia Britannica a collection of 
articles. This site is, above all, amazingly comprehensive, with more than 2,000 
pages of information, articles, tutorials, product reviews, and photographs.
 
This site has everything you’d want to know about nature photography, but 
it goes far beyond that. Here are just some of the features to check out:
 
✓ Understanding Series: The site’s Understanding series of tutorials 
covers everything from SLR viewfinders and how they work to sensor 
cleaning. You can discover how to use unsharp masking, work with his-
tograms, and use polarizing filters effectively.
 
✓ Tutorials: This series covers digital workflow, pinhole photography, 
high dynamic range photography, and other topics.
 
✓ Workshops: You can find lists of workshops occurring around the 
world. (China, Africa, Antarctica, Ireland, and Iceland are just a few 
destinations where these workshops have been held in the past.)
 
✓ Locations: The descriptions of prime shooting locations for nature 
photography help you find new places to take photos.
 
✓ Columns, Essays, and Product Reviews: Oh, yeah — don’t miss the 
essays, regular columns, and hundreds of product reviews on cameras, 
tripods, and other essentials.

If you’re interested in nature, landscape, or documentary photography, you 
must visit this site. However, everyone from sports photographers to portrai-
ture specialists can discover something of interest if they stop by.
Photos That Don’t Bite
www.bytephoto.com
I include BytePhoto because it’s a slightly lesser-known site that deserves a 
little more attention, if only for its quirkiness. It includes a lot of features, but 
it’s especially strong as a portal to other sites. For example, BytePhoto offers 
online galleries, but you can also find links to sharing services, including 
SmugMug (www.smugmug.com), which is the strongest competitor to PBase 
(which I talk about in the section “All Your PBase Are Belong to Us,” earlier in 
this chapter). BytePhoto gives you links to other interesting pages on exter-
nal sites, a Google search box for combing the Web, and a ton of ads that 
have interesting offers you might want to jump to.
BytePhoto offers news, reviews (not especially great, but interesting), and 
photo contests. You can also find tutorials on image editing, Photoshop 
Actions (macros), and the usual collection of forums. If you have old gear 
to unload or things to buy, you might find the classified ads useful. (One of 
the site’s forums contains the ads.) You might need to use the home page’s 
search box to find a particular feature, but it’s worth the look.
Cult of Personality
When you search the Web, you can find a ton of sites founded and operated 
by individuals, such as www.kenrockwell.com (good stuff, but focusing 
mostly on Nikon and highly opinionated), www.fredmiranda.com, and www.
robgalbraith.com (which I discuss next).
Rob Galbraith
www.robgalbraith.com
 
Rob is probably best known for his exhaustive evaluation of CompactFlash 
(CF) and Secure Digital (SD) card performance data. He has tested virtually 
every CF and SD card available, with just about every camera on the market. 
You can find more than 20 pages of tables and data to pore through. If you 
want to know how a SanDisk Extreme III 8GB CompactFlash card performs 
with a Nikon D2Xs, you can find that information. These tests are quite liter-
ally the Bible of the industry.

297
 Chapter 16: Ten Online Resources for Digital SLR Photography
Although Rob no longer offers forums, like he did in the past, the site includes 
a good list of links to other useful Web pages, from the American Society 
of Media Photographers (ASMP) to National Geographic. This site includes 
authoritative news and reports, links to software upgrades, and the usual 
array of ads that help pay for the cost of publishing all this information online.
Most photographer-run sites focus more on promoting the photographer 
than providing solid information, but Rob’s site is one exception.
Charmin’ Miranda
www.fredmiranda.com
Another photographer who believes it’s better to give than receive is Fred 
Miranda. His gorgeous site is bursting with valuable information, all arranged 
logically and easy to access. A lot of digital photographers agree: On a recent 
night when I logged in, nearly 1,500 other photographers were also using the 
site at that exact moment!
Of course, Fred does hawk some amazing software, but in an unobtrusive 
way. You almost have to stumble across the FM Software offerings, mostly 
Photoshop plug-ins and Actions that 
do tasks such as reduce noise, resize 
photos, or manage workflow.
 
You may find the forums, as shown 
in Figure 16-4, highly engaging. 
They’re some of the best available 
forums online, with contributions 
from more than 70,000 members. 
You can also find useful articles 
and reviews, as well as image host-
ing. Even if you don’t want to set up 
showcases of your own, definitely 
browse the hosted galleries. You can 
get a lot of ideas by viewing other 
photographers’ best efforts.
Don’t Miss eBay
www.ebay.com
Once called “the nation’s garage sale,” eBay is one online resource that really 
pays if you have old equipment to unload. Registered members can also use 
eBay to locate hard-to-find camera equipment at reasonable prices. Although 
Figure 16-4: The forums are one of the more 
engaging parts of Fred Miranda’s Web site.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
KEH.com (www.keh.com), a real camera dealer in Atlanta; B&H Photo (www.
bhphotovideo.com); and Adorama (www.adorama.com) are all reliable 
dealers and the go-to organizations for much new and used stuff, nothing 
beats eBay for variety — and, if you get caught up in bidding, excitement.
I know whereof I speak. I’ve had more than 8,000 transactions on eBay myself, 
and I ended up writing a book about my experiences, The eBay Myth Buster 
(Wiley). You can pick up a copy through my Web site at www.dbusch.com, 
or visit your local or online bookstore.
eBay is a great place to locate new and used equipment at a price that you’re 
willing to pay — especially if you do some research ahead of time and have 
a good idea about what an item’s truly worth. The venue does best with sup-
plies (such as ink for inkjet printers), older cameras and lenses, and difficult-
to-find accessories. For example, when I picked up a used 170mm-to-500mm 
zoom lens from my local camera dealer, it didn’t come with a lens hood. The 
lens hood that I found on eBay was delivered to me in less than a week for 
quite a bit less than my dealer would’ve charged for a special order.
Perhaps you’re looking for older, manual-focus lenses that are compatible 
with your dSLR. A manual focus (MF) macro lens for $150 probably performs 
as well as a new autofocus (AF) version that costs two or three times as 
much, and you can probably get away with manual focus for precision close-
up work anyway.
Perhaps you’re upgrading to a new 
camera and want to sell your old 
one. Your dealer or a company, such 
as KEH, will gladly buy it from you, 
but they must offer enough less than 
the camera’s worth to allow for some 
profit when they resell. Peddle the 
camera on eBay, and you might make 
a lot more cash than you would’ve 
gotten if you traded it in or sold it 
outright with a dealer.
Ever since I went all-digital, I’ve been 
slowly selling off my film cameras on 
eBay. Figure 16-5 shows an edited 
version of an eBay auction that I con-
ducted for a beloved old half-frame 
camera I wanted to relocate to a new 
home.

 Chapter 16: Ten Online Resources for Digital SLR Photography
 
Here are a few keys to using eBay successfully:
 
✓ Check the seller’s feedback. Each eBay ID has a Feedback Rating 
number to the right of it, which represents the net number of posi-
tive feedbacks (that is, positives minus negatives) received. Click the 
number to view the actual feedback comments. Sellers with 50 to 100 or 
more positives and no negatives are probably reliable. (eBay no longer 
allows sellers to leave negative ratings for buyers.) Those sellers who 
have fewer feedbacks or a few negatives might also be good eggs, but be 
sure to check a little further. The venue recently added more detailed 
feedback ratings that allow buyers to rate sellers on delivery prompt-
ness and other aspects of the transaction.
 
✓ Pay for your items by using your credit card through a service such 
as PayPal. Although eBay provides a modicum of buyer protection, if 
you use your credit card through PayPal, you have two extra levels of 
security. If a deal goes awry, PayPal might be able to get you a refund. 
If not, you can go directly to the credit card company and frequently 
get a charge back that way. Scams are fairly rare on eBay in the overall 
scheme of things. If you avoid deals that seem too good to be true (for 
example, a Nikon D5000 for $200) you won’t easily fall victim.
 
✓ Don’t expect sensational deals on cameras or lenses that have just 
been introduced. It’s unlikely that “used” ones are available, in any 
case, and the new ones are probably being sold by dealers who have a 
profit margin to make. New cameras are likely to be no more than about 
$50 cheaper than you’d pay locally (if that), but you can save on local 
sales tax, unless you’re a New York resident. In most cases, you can do 
better on newly introduced equipment at B&H Photo or Adorama.
 
✓ Don’t buy memory cards on eBay. You can find a robust trade in coun-
terfeit memory cards (mostly purporting to be SanDisk models), and an 
alarming percentage of rock-bottom CompactFlash or SD card offerings 
are bogus. Even though eBay stomps out evil sellers almost as fast as 
they appear, the odds are still against you. Unless a seller has hundreds 
or thousands of favorable feedbacks, you’re better off buying your 
memory cards elsewhere.
 
✓ When purchasing used equipment, see whether you can get a money-
back guarantee or an inspection period. This gear is frequently sold 
as-is, which can be okay if the seller is well-respected (meaning he or 
she has a lot of positive feedback) but risky if the seller is new.

Ten (or More) Confusing 
Concepts Clarified
In This Chapter
▶ Knowing the terms involved in taking your photos
▶ Understanding what certain settings’ names actually mean
▶ Making sense of your image editor’s terminology
P
hotography is easy: It’s the jargon that’s difficult! Today’s digital SLRs 
make it simple to point, shoot, and get great pictures right out of the 
box. Even the most basic dSLR is smart enough to save you from your own 
mistakes when your ambitions don’t extend beyond simple scenes, simple 
setups, and simple subjects.
When you want to spread your wings and try differ-
ent techniques, more advanced features and more 
advanced photographic concepts come into play. 
At that point, you may want to become comfortable 
with that jargon — not so that you can sound 
knowledgeable when hanging around with other 
photographers, but so you can put those some-
times-confusing concepts to work for you. I explain 
all the key terms throughout this book, but in this 
chapter, I single out a few of the trickiest terms that 
relate to cameras, photography, and image editing, 
and provide the depth and knowledge that you can use.
Ambient Lighting/Available Lighting
Ambient lighting is sometimes confused with available lighting or existing 
lighting, which are themselves often confusing for those not steeped in photo 
jargon. Available and existing lighting are the same thing (or should be) and 
are most commonly defined as the illumination that’s already present in a 
scene, whether it’s sunlight, street lights, moonlight (outdoors), or lamps 

302
Part V: The Part of Tens 
and other light sources (indoors), including light that streams into the room 
from outside through windows, doors, or openings. You can consider add-on 
sources — including additional lamps or electronic flash — available (if you 
have them on hand), but they’re not existing. (Hence the confusion.)
Ambient lighting, on the other hand, is something entirely different; although, 
in most cases, you’d consider it to be available or existing light. In practice, 
ambient lighting is non-directional lighting that appears to come from every-
where, rather than from a single source. It’s soft and diffuse, and it’s supplied 
by light bouncing off the ceiling, walls, or other objects in a scene. When 
used with a stronger primary light source, ambient light fills in dark shadows 
and pares the rough edges off contrasty lighting transitions. Ambient lighting 
is your friend — now that you know what it is and how to best use it.
Anti-Aliasing
Anti-aliasing is an edge-smoothing process applied by your camera and/or 
by an image editing program to account for the fact that the seamless analog 
information in your original scene must be converted into discrete rectangu-
lar pixels when the picture is digitized.
Blocky little pixels work great for 
reproducing straight lines but aren’t so 
great for creating curves or diagonal 
lines. Without anti-aliasing, you end up 
with ragged edges, like the one shown 
at top in Figure 17-1. Anti-aliasing cre-
ates partially transparent pixels along 
these boundaries, which merge into 
smoother, non-jaggy lines when viewed 
(like the bottom of Figure 17-1).
Bracketing
Even small changes in settings can 
make a difference to finicky photog-
raphers, and bracketing is a way of 
providing several alternate takes at 
different exposures, with different 
color balance settings, or using other 
parameters so that you can choose 
the one that best suits your image.
Many (but not all) digital SLRs have a 
bracketing feature that automatically Figure 17-1: You can smooth a jaggy line (top) 
by using anti-aliasing (bottom).

303
 Chapter 17: Ten (or More) Confusing Concepts Clarified
takes successive exposures at incremental settings that you specify. For 
example, you can choose to take the first picture at the exposure setting 
determined by the camera’s meter and a specified number of photos (typi-
cally three or five) at exposures that are less and more than the calculated 
exposure. You can take the bracketed exposures one at a time (until you 
complete the requested number of bracketed shots), or you can take them 
rapidly, one after another, when the dSLR is in Continuous Shooting/Burst 
mode.
Certain dSLRs may allow you to specify parameters other than just exposure, 
such as white balance or color, that you want to bracket; the order in which 
you want the bracketed shots exposed; or the size of the increment between 
shots (such as 1/3 stop, 1/2 stop, or one full stop). You may also be able to 
bracket electronic flash exposures, as well.
Figure 17-2 shows a series of bracketed exposures (top) and color balance 
changes (bottom).
 
 
Figure 17-2: Many digital SLRs can bracket exposure (top), color (bottom), or both.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Chromatic Aberration
Chromatic aberration (CA), which produces colored blurs and/or green/
purple fringes around the outlines of an object, is usually most obvious in 
backlit subjects, as shown by the purple fringes around the pine branches in 
Figure 17-3. CA is caused by the inability of the lens to focus all the colors of 
light at the same plane on the sensor. That differing response to colors splits 
the red/green/blue light into separate components, like a prism, and the stray 
colors are diverted to one side (with lateral chromatic aberration) or to form 
a color-tinged blur (with axial or longitudinal chromatic aberration). Neither 
form is much fun to find in your photographs.
 
 
Figure 17-3: Chromatic aberration can cause green or purple fringing.
Although you can partially reduce axial CA by using a smaller f-stop, you 
must avoid both types (by checking reviews before purchase to see whether 
a particular lens suffers badly from chromatic aberration), live with CA, or — 
if you have Photoshop or a specialized add-on tool — fix it. Photoshop’s 
Lens Correction filter can counter some chromatic aberration, and DxO Labs 
(www.dxo.com) offers DxO Optics Pro, which has remedies for many types of 
lens and perspective distortion.

305
 Chapter 17: Ten (or More) Confusing Concepts Clarified
Dodging/Burning
Back in the film era, a skilled darkroom worker who was an artful dodger 
could hold back portions of an image while making a print by using an 
enlarger (a type of vertical projector that cast an image through the negative 
or positive film on a piece of photosensitive paper). By moving light-blocking 
tools (even the worker’s hands) in the light path while making the exposure, 
he or she could make the portions of the image subjected to dodging darker 
than they would’ve been if the worker allowed the exposure to proceed 
unhindered. The converse was true for burning, in which the darkroom mae-
stro blocked all portions of an image except the portions exposed for an 
added period of time.
Dodging and burning allowed darkening or lightening of only certain portions 
of an image, thus toning down highlight areas that would otherwise be washed 
out and preventing shadow areas, which preserved detail. You can find similar 
techniques available in all image editors today, but many digital photographers 
confuse the two terms because they don’t know where the terms came from. 
Now you know.
Fill Flash
Flash? Outdoors? What am I thinking? Actually, even if plenty of light is avail-
able for an acceptable exposure, that illumination may not provide a decent 
picture — especially in bright sunlight or other situations in which the high-
lights are much brighter than the shadows. The result? Shadows that are way 
too dark. Providing extra exposure to those inky shadows doesn’t help: The 
highlights are then washed out.
The solution is to flip up your camera’s built-in flash and let it do its stuff. 
A digital SLR is smart enough to recognize situations in which it should use 
the electronic flash at a lower power setting to fill in shadows without wash-
ing out the highlights. Your camera may do this for you automatically or 
may have a Fill Flash setting somewhere in the menus that tells the dSLR 
to throttle back the strobe. You want the camera to provide just enough 
of a kick with the flash to brighten the shadows, especially under the eyes, 
without making it obvious that a flash was used. As a bonus, you may find 
that the Fill Flash adds some useful sparkle to the eyes of human subjects 
who are looking directly at the camera, as shown in Figure 17-4. A reddish 
filter placed over the flash can add some warmth, too.

306
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Figure 17-4: Fill Flash brightens dark shadows.
Hyperfocal Distance
The hyperfocal distance is a quick way of stretching your available depth-of-field 
to make it most useful. This distance is a point of focus where everything in 
your scene from half the hyperfocal distance to infinity appears to be accept-
ably sharp.
For example, if a hyperfocal distance is 6 feet, everything from 3 feet to infin-
ity would look sharp at the most common print sizes and viewing distances. 
(Apparent depth-of-field varies, depending on how close you are to the printed 
image and its magnification.) The actual hyperfocal distance varies by the lens 
and the f-stop in use; if you Google hyperfocal length, you can find Web pages that 
have tables listing the hyperfocal distance for a particular focal length and f-stop.
Knowing the hyperfocal distance (even if only a rough estimate) can help you 
be ready for a “grab” shot. Turn off your dSLR’s autofocus and set the lens at 
the hyperfocal distance for the f-stop that you plan to use, and you can snap 
off a picture quickly without having to wait for the camera to lock in focus.
Lossy/Lossless Compression
Lossy and lossless are terms that cause confusion, partially because the former 
uses a word that’s not officially a part of the English language (I know lossy 
causes Microsoft Word fits until you add it to your custom dictionary). Lossy 
compression is the opposite of lossless compression. Both schemes squeeze 

307
 Chapter 17: Ten (or More) Confusing Concepts Clarified
down the size of image files (thus saving space on your memory card and 
computer hard disk) by replacing the long strings of information that repre-
sent the image data with shorter number series.
The TIFF and compressed RAW file formats are examples of lossless or virtually 
lossless file formats (some dSLRs can also use an uncompressed RAW format). 
Lossless methods do reduce file size but retain all the information in the original 
image so that the uncompressed version can be reconstituted at any time.
Lossy compression, used in JPEG files and some other formats, takes an 
additional step and examines an image for redundant information that makes 
little or no difference visually when the squeezed image is viewed. After you 
compress an image and some of the image data is discarded, you have no 
way to restore the original image. If you resave the same image as a JPEG file 
over and over, you lose some image quality each time.
Digital cameras and image editors that use lossy compression offer options 
for selecting the amount of compression (and the amount of information 
lost), so you can end up with an image that’s virtually indistinguishable from 
the original (as shown on the left in Figure 17-5) or one that’s much smaller 
but has a noticeable amount of image information missing (as shown on the 
right in Figure 17-5), as well as every quality level in-between.
 
 
 Figure 17-5: Lossless compression (left) preserves all the original image information, unlike 
lossy compression (right), which discards some information to reduce file size.

Moiré
As the old song goes, when a newscaster’s tie hits you right in the eye, that’s 
a moiré. If you’ve ever gotten dizzy watching a personality on the tube who’s 
wearing a checkered neckpiece, you know exactly what moiré is. When two 
patterns — such as the pattern of the tie and the scanning lines of the televi-
sion screen — interfere with each other, a maddening new pattern appears.
Moiré can be produced when you take digital photos of subjects that have 
a regular pattern, which is why virtually all dSLRs have an anti-aliasing filter 
placed over the sensor. This filter blurs the image slightly, reducing the 
moiré effect that would otherwise appear because of interference patterns 
that result under certain conditions when an analog visual image is con-
verted to digital form.
One almost sure way to create moiré is to scan a picture that’s already been 
published, which means that it was printed through a halftone screen. The 
scanner’s own pattern frequently produces the effect.
The best cure for moiré, whether it appears in a digital photo or scanned 
image, is to blur the image slightly to disguise the interference. The 
Despeckle filter in Photoshop and Photoshop Elements can often do a decent 
job. You can sometimes improve scanned images by rescanning with the 
original at a slight angle to reduce the interference.
Saturation
Take a perfectly good can of red paint, dump in an equal quantity of white, 
and what do you have? Pink? Well, maybe. But in another sense, what you 
have is a less-saturated red. Saturation is the purity of a color — from a full, 
rich, vivid hue, progressing down to duller, less-rich colors until you reach 
gray. When it comes to paint, you can reduce the saturation by adding white, 
black, or gray paint, or by mixing in the complement of the original hue to 
dilute the color. With digital cameras and light, changing saturation is a little 
more complicated.
Defining saturation isn’t easy when only the three red, green, and blue (RGB) 
channels in a digital camera image are available. You might think that an image 
that has a 100-percent brightness level in, say, the red channel and a zero 
brightness level in the green and blue channels would have 100-percent satura-
tion in the red. But if all the channels were equal, the saturation would be zero.

309
 Chapter 17: Ten (or More) Confusing Concepts Clarified
Unfortunately, RGB color does a poor job of providing absolute saturation 
values as the difference among the color channels because the results aren’t 
linear and can vary, depending on what’s defined as the white point in an 
image. Instead, those who care about such things divide the characteristics 
of color into a different set of components: hue, saturation, and brightness 
(or lightness/luminance), often called HSB or HSL. Hue is the absolute color, 
as seen on the color wheel (shown in Figure 11-14 in Chapter 11). Saturation 
is intensity of the hue, and brightness is the amount of light.
You need to understand these distinctions when you’re adjusting the degree 
of saturation provided by the camera settings in your dSLR or modifying the 
saturation of an image in an image editor. A low degree of saturation pro-
duces a low-key, pastel image (as shown on the left in Figure 17-6), whereas 
exaggerated saturation creates a garish look (as shown on the far right in the 
figure).

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Threshold
Thresholds do more than provide a rite-of-passage for newly married cou-
ples. In digital imaging, thresholds determine how a given pixel is represented 
in an image. By understanding how thresholds work, you can better under-
stand, for example, why some of your images lack shadow detail or have 
blown-out highlights.
When you take a photo, the individual photosites in the sensor begin collect-
ing photons the instant the shutter opens. If fewer photons at a given pixel 
position are collected than the sensor’s threshold, that pixel is represented 
as black. Thousands of photons might have dropped into the photosite 
“bucket” while a neighboring photosite might have collected only a few, but 
unless the sensor’s threshold is reached, both of those pixels are black in 
your finished picture.
After the number of photons captured by a photosite passes the threshold, 
additional photons gathered allow the pixel to show up as brighter shades 
of gray, then midtones, and finally white. Any additional photons collected 
don’t register at all unless they happen to spill out of the bucket into adja-
cent photosites (producing a blooming effect). Increasing the ISO setting 
effectively lowers the threshold by multiplying the number of pixels actually 
collected until the sensor can count them. Thresholds are used in many dif-
ferent ways, particularly in image editors when you use a threshold to specify 
a contrast level that is used to apply, say, unsharp masking to an image.
Tolerance
Tolerance is an image-editing concept that confuses many. It generally refers 
to the range of both color or tonal values that a particular tool, such as the 
Magic Wand in Photoshop, select. (Many people think tolerance involves only 
brightness, when in fact, color is also factored in.)
Tolerance is usually specified in values from 0 to 255 because that range rep-
resents both black-and-white and color brightness values (from 0, which is 
black to 255, which is white). Low tolerance settings mean that the tool selects 
only pixels that are very close in brightness or color value. For example, if 
you click a pixel that has a value of 220 by using the Magic Wand that has 
the tolerance set to 10, adjacent pixels that have color or brightness values 
within 10 of 220 are chosen; a value of 64 would select a much larger set of 
pixels.
When you make selections in an image editor, set tolerance levels that are, 
like Goldilocks’s choices, just right. If you use a too-low tolerance, you don’t

 Chapter 17: Ten (or More) Confusing Concepts Clarified
select enough pixels to be useful, whereas a too-high tolerance selects pixels 
that you really don’t want.
Unsharp Masking
The term unsharp masking often throws new photographers because the pro-
cess doesn’t make images less sharp — it makes them sharper. The confusion 
comes from unsharp masking’s origins as a technique originally used with 
photographic film.
A darkroom worker would take a sheet of negative film and create a positive 
image that’s slightly blurred. Like any out-of-focus image, the blurred posi-
tive spreads out a little. Then, when the worker placed the original negative 
and positive together in a sandwich, the dark areas of the negative partially 
cancelled out (masked) the equivalent light areas of the reversed positive, 
except at the edges, where the blurring produced lighter and darker lines on 
each side of the boundary between those edges. Copying the sandwich pro-
duced a new image that emphasized the edges, enhancing the appearance of 
sharpness.
Image editors retain the name unsharp masking because photographers who 
were familiar with the process were early users of these programs. However, 
the Unsharp Mask filters do all their work electronically, searching for pixels 
that differ in value from their surrounding pixels based on a threshold level 
that you specify. When pixels differ more sharply from their neighbors, the 
image editor judges that it has found an edge and thus increases the contrast 
to make the edge seem sharper.
