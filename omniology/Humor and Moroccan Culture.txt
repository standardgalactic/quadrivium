Preface
This  book  will  explore  and  discuss  the  hidden 
aspects of Moroccan culture, things that people who grow 
up in Morocco seem to know inherently. I started on this 
journey because of a joke. I was living in Casablanca at 
the  time  and  had  been  studying  Arabic
1.  My  friend 
Mohamed told me a story and started laughing. He reached 
1 The Moroccan variety called “darija.” This is an oral dialect that 
is generally not written and therefore difficult to transcribe as 
there are no standard spellings for words. The spellings I will be 
using  are  my  own  and  may  actually  vary  from  passage  to 
passage...this is not by design, but it should serve to illustrate the 
more fluid nature of darija. Pronunciations and grammar  can 
change regionally and even from family to family. I will explore 
this more fully as the book continues.

his hand out to shake mine in a gesture that has now 
become  quite  familiar—I  like  to  call  it  the  “we  both 
enjoyed  that  joke”  handshake  of  congratulation  and 
friendship. As with most handshakes, it is followed by 
putting your hand on your heart. Unlike other handshakes, 
it is usually followed by all the parties discussing the joke 
you just heard and why it was funny. This is to make 
certain everyone understood it and can be included in the 
fun. I found the experience enjoyable, even though I had 
no clue what the joke was about. I was missing something 
and I didn't know what it was.
I decided to do two things. First, I asked Mohamed 
to explain the joke to me, line by line. After I learned all 
the  vocabulary  and  figured  out  what  all the sentences 
meant, I still didn't think the joke was funny. Mohamed 
explained it to me, but I didn't understand his explanation. 
I continued by asking him to explain how things would 
have normally  occurred  in  that  situation  and  suddenly 
something  clicked.  Here  was  an  aspect  of  Moroccan 
culture that I had been missing completely. Immediately 
the joke made sense and I appreciated the humor of it. 
The second thing I decided to do was birthed out of 

11
that moment. I decided to ask people, everywhere I could, 
to tell me jokes. Then I would struggle through each one, 
trying to understand it, trying to figure out what made 
each joke funny in its original context. This has led me on 
a fun, and often difficult and overwhelming, journey of 
cultural and linguistic study.
Once I had acquired a repertoire of 30 or 40 jokes in 
Moroccan darija an expatriate friend asked me if I would 
consider writing them down for him to study. I hadn't 
thought  of  that  earlier.  Most  of  this  still-growing 
collection was made for my personal benefit and stemming 
from my personality—I tell jokes all the time in my native 
language and I love to use them to help make new friends 
wherever I go. Jokes lighten the atmosphere and mood and 
help lower defenses. This makes train rides,  café visits, 
and queues to pay the phone bill much more enjoyable.
I wasn't sure how a collection of jokes in Moroccan 
darija by a foreigner would be received and was pretty 
skeptical of the idea, so I shelved it for several years. 
Occasionally,  one  of  my  friends  among  the  expatriate 
community in Morocco would ask me to tell them one of 
the jokes they heard me laughing over with our mutual 

12  -   Humor and Moroccan Culture
Moroccan friends. I would oblige and translate the joke 
into  English  for  them.  Invariably,  the  non-Moroccan 
would not laugh. They wouldn't laugh even when I told it 
in Moroccan Arabic and they knew every word. From 
those  moments  I  had  an  epiphany—you  have  to 
understand the cultural tidbit behind any joke for it to be 
funny. That brings us to the book you hold in your hands.
Each chapter of this book begins with a short story 
in Moroccan Arabic. These stories were collected from 
friends, in cafés, in offices, on trains and buses, and in 
taxis, and even on the street. I have tried to transcribe them 
as accurately as possible. I am not responsible for the 
content of the stories, but any errors you may find in 
transcription, or my sometimes loose translation, are fully 
mine. 
All of the discussion of culture which follows in 
each chapter is completely mine. My thoughts and insights 
are based on various interactions I have had with people 
all over Morocco. 
Much  of  what  I  state in  these pages  may  come 
across as authoritative. Please interpret this as a result of 
my writing style and not my most heartfelt belief. My 

13
greatest goal in writing this book is to help the reader 
begin  to  ask  the  right  questions  when  encountering 
cultural differences and attempting to understand them. 
Remember, the existence of a correlation between two 
things does not prove or even imply causation. I make note 
of many correlations and have hypothesized as to probable 
causes for what I have witnessed. My hypotheses may be 
wrong. In any case, I hope that noting the correlations and 
describing  them  as  best  I  can  may  help  others  to 
investigate more fully.
All my research for this book has been correlational 
and  anecdotal  in  nature  and  never  directive  nor 
experimental.  I  will  leave  that  work  for  others  more 
qualified than I. In addition,  I know that I sometimes 
oversimplify when mentioning or describing the various 
influences  that  bear  on  decisions  and  actions  in  this 
culture. Human beings are complex and the things that 
influence us are many. There may be motives and forces in 
action beyond those that I describe. Please keep that in 
mind.  Look  for  those  things,  record  them,  learn  from 
them, and share them with others. 
Finally, I realize that no culture is monolithic and 

14  -   Humor and Moroccan Culture
that the things I describe will not apply to all Moroccans 
all of the time. In fact, the lion's share of my experience is 
in Fez, so in some parts of the country my theories might 
be completely wrong and utterly inapplicable. This has not 
been intentional, and I have consciously tried to avoid 
errors, but it's possible errors have crept in.

Being from Fez
.قال ليك, هاذا واحد الراجل كان كيمشي في المدينة مع ولده 
تلقاو مع صديق الب و تكلمو شوية. في هذه الواقت سأل الولد 
منين هو الراجل. قال لي هو من مراكش. بعد شي شوية مشا 
فحاله. و قال ليه, ”ماتسول منين هو.“ جاوب, ”علش؟ هاد شي 
عدي؟“ قال ليه,”علحاقاش إلى ماشي من فاس يهشمو و إلى من 
“.فاس غادي يقول ليك كلشي 
There was a man walking through town with his son. They  
met one of the father's friends and stopped to talk a bit. 
The boy asked the man where he was from and he replied  
that he was from Marrakech. After a short while they all  
went their separate ways. The man said to his son, “Don't 
ask people where they are from.” The boy replied, “Why? 
That's a normal question.” The father answered, “If they 
aren't from Fez they will be ashamed and if they are from  
Fez they'll tell you all about it.”

16  -   Humor and Moroccan Culture
Fez is an amazing city—just ask anyone who is 
from there. I happen to live in Fez and I think it is a 
wonderful  place  for  a  large  number  of  reasons.  As  a 
foreigner I can appreciate Fez's history, its contributions to 
Moroccan culture, and its amazing food—which deserves 
its reputation as some of the best Morocco has to offer. A 
walking trip through the old city, the medina, is like taking 
a trip back in time. You will see people living today in 
much the same way as their ancestors did a thousand years 
ago, except that today the traders are using their donkeys 
to  deliver  Coca-Cola  and  butane  gas  cylinders  to  the 
neighborhood  shops  instead  of  goat  skin  canteens  and 
freshly cut wood.
In the Fez medina, people buy and sell traditional 
handicrafts such as fine leather, carved or inlaid wood, and 
ornately etched or engraved metal. Visitors and tourists 
explore  streets  and  see  homes  and  buildings  that  had 
running water and a sewage system while Europe had yet 
to  emerge  from  the  Dark  Ages.  One  of  the  more 
interesting places in Fez for a scholar/researcher is the 
Qarawiyyin library which is said to be one of the oldest 
continually used libraries in the world. It has works dating 

17
back a thousand years or more and is a library that is still 
used by students today.
Fez is the home of one of the oldest universities in 
the  world...there  seems  to  be  a  rivalry  between  the 
Qarawiyyin university in Fez and Al Azhar in Cairo as to 
which is older. Each claim the title and in some sense it 
appears to be true for each of them. One (I forget which) is 
said to have been founded earlier, but ceased operating for 
a short time. I'm told the other started just a few years 
later, but has never taken a break from teaching. Whether 
these are facts or rumors, I'll leave the disagreement for 
others  to  solve.  Both  universities  are  old  and  well-
respected.
Fez  is  considered  the  spiritual  and  intellectual 
capital  of  Morocco.  Its  residents  consider  themselves, 
perhaps rightly so, to be some of the best educated and 
most sophisticated people in the country. 
Fassis
1 are proud of the fact that no invaders were 
ever able to enter the city walls and conquer the city. Fez 
is a fiercely independent city that has historically held very 
1 The name for a person from Fez is “fassi” much like someone 
from Marrakesh would be called “marrakeshi” and so on.

18  -   Humor and Moroccan Culture
strong opinions and great sway politically, religiously, and 
culturally. In addition to being the unquestioned spiritual 
capital of Morocco, it was also the first political capital 
and the starting point for the independence movement, 
which ended the French Protectorate era.
These are all important facts, and the reader must 
realize  that  they  will  color  everything  that  I  write 
throughout this text. I learned Arabic in Fez. I have gained 
what  understanding  I  have  of  Moroccan  culture  based 
primarily on my years spent here in Fez among my Fassi 
friends. I have chosen this joke as the first to tell because I 
am certain if someone reads this book through the eyes of 
their experiences or friends in Agadir or Tangier, they will 
have a different perspective or understanding than I.
It's interesting to note that many Moroccans from 
around the country seem to share the opinions of Fez that I 
have acquired; that Fez is filled with people who act and 
believe  themselves  to  be  more  sophisticated  than  the 
average Moroccan, that the history and culture of this city 
is an old and proud one, and that the city's influence can be 
felt throughout the country's history. If you were to ask 
him, a local might tell you a hundred reasons why Fez is 

19
an important city historically, culturally, artistically and 
intellectually. In the next breath he would say that he is not 
being arrogant, just accurate. Maybe he is right. In any 
case,  this  is  information  that  is  vital  to  understanding 
relationships among people in Morocco.
This trend goes farther than just Fez. Many of the 
major cities in Morocco have their own special reputation. 
Casablanca is known as the economic and manufacturing 
capital  of  Morocco,  Rabat  is  the  French-influenced 
political capital, Marrakesh is the capital of southern and 
urban  Berber  culture,  and  on  it  goes.  You  also  have 
cultural and linguistic differences between people who live 
in small towns and people who live in big cities, between 
rural  and  urban  cultures.  There  is  a  tension  between 
traditional Berber and traditional Arab ways of life
1...and 
1 This is a tension that can be observed by watching people, but 
one that will generally be denied by Moroccans. The prevailing 
belief is that there are only Moroccans, that the Berber/Arab 
dichotomy is unimportant. Amusingly, people who say this will 
also tell you whether their family is of Arab or Berber descent 
and often which tribe and geographic region they come from. I 
think the unity is real in some ways and was necessary in the 

20  -   Humor and Moroccan Culture
another tension as each of way of life is being forced to 
accept, or at least adapt to, Western ways of thinking and 
doing things.
A person coming to Morocco for the first time often 
asks an innocent question, “What is Morocco like?” The 
answer isn't simple or easy. It depends on which aspect of 
Morocco you are discussing; a specific family's structure, 
the  socio-economic  status  of  the  person  you  are 
considering,  the  physical  location,  or  setting  of  the 
location you are interested in. There are many variables 
and each one can have a major impact on the answer to the 
question.
So, now you see why the Moroccan father in the 
joke told his son not to ask where people are from.  And, 
like anyone from Fez, I have told you more than you 
wanted to hear.
struggle for independence from the French Protectorate.

I'm not sure that is Arabic
هادي واحد مدرسة و فيها أستاد جديد. بغى يعرف سميات ديال 
،التلميذ ديالوه. و بدى يسولهم، ”شكون أنت، شكون أنتي.“ جاوبوه 
”أنا محسن. أنا نزهة.“ و قال ليه واحد التلميذ، ”أنا أسم.“ شاف 
فيه الستاذ و فكر، ”شنو هدا؟ ماشي سميى هادي.“ و طلب منه 
،إعاود ثاني مرة وعاو ثاني قال ليه ”أنا أسم.“ فكر المعلم و قال 
 ”ل. أنت ماشي أسم، أنت
قاسم“.“ جاوب الولد، ”هاذا لي ألت لك 
علحقاش هو من مدينة فاس حيت فاسى ماكيقولوش ”ق“. قال 
الستاذ بلي خصو يتعلم يقول مزيان هاد الحرف مهيم. ظرب 
المعلم الولد حتى قالها صحيحة. سول الستاذ ولد أخر و طلب منو 
“.سميتو. ولد خاف بزاف و قال ليه، ”أنا قحمد
There was a new teacher in the school and he wanted to  
know all the kids' names. He asked and they began to  
respond, “I'm Mouhcine. I'm Nazha.” One boy responded, 
“I'm  Asim.”  The  teacher  looked  at  him  and  thought,  
“That isn't a real name. What's going on here?” He asked  
again and again the boy responded, “I'm Asim.” The 

22  -   Humor and Moroccan Culture
teacher thought a little more and told the boy, “No, your  
name isn't 'Asim,' your name is 'Qasim.'” “That's what I 
said,” repeated the boy, who was from the region of Fez  
where they don't pronounce the letter “Q.” The teacher  
told him that this is an important letter. To teach him to  
pronounce his name correctly, he hit the boy until he said 
it right. The teacher then looked at the frightened boy next 
to him who replied, “I'm Qahmid.”
Where ever you go in Morocco you will discover 
that no matter how good your Arabic is, it is not the same 
as  the  people  you  are  with.  Dialects  and  accents  can 
change from one neighborhood to another, and certainly 
from one city or region to another. Moroccan darija also 
differs significantly from Modern Standard Arabic, also 
known as Fous-ha.
The boy in the story is from a specific part of the 
old city of Fez. In that area people tend not to pronounce 
the letter “qoph” or perhaps substitute a “hamza”
1 in it's 
place.
1 A glottal stop that sounds like an unvoiced “a,” like the sound 
you make in English when you say “uh-oh.”

23
The teacher is from another  part of  Morocco,  it 
could be a different city or even just a newer part of Fez. 
He doesn't speak with the same accent and had a hard time 
understanding the boy.  This  is  actually  very  common, 
even for Moroccans traveling within their own country. 
Just as an Englishman might have trouble understanding 
an  American  from  the  Cajun  parts  of  Louisiana,  a 
Moroccan from the rural Souss plain in the south might 
have difficulty communicating with another from urban 
Casablanca.
To get this joke you need one more vital bit of 
information.  The  name  Qasim  is  common  enough  for 
people to know it well. In the region around of Fez many 
would pronounce it just as the boy pronounced it, without 
the first  letter.  The name Hamid  is  also  common  and 
would  start  with  the same sound  as the boy's  accent-
modified pronunciation of Qasim. 
The second boy also grew up in the same part of Fez 
and  realized  part  of  what  was  going  on.  He  had  not 
traveled outside of the area and suddenly became afraid 
that every word he had ever heard starting with a hamza 
now needed a qoph. That would have included his name. 

24  -   Humor and Moroccan Culture
In an attempt to avoid a beating, the boy unnecessarily 
adds the additional letter to his name, just like his friend 
was forced to do.
I have found when traveling, that a person is not 
considered an Arabic speaker unless he has learned the 
local dialect. No matter how well you can read and write, 
no matter whether you are able to speak beautiful, flowing, 
classical Arabic, unless you can sit in a café and have a 
casual conversation, you will not be considered an Arabic 
speaker.  Some  allowance  is  made  for  travelers,  say 
someone from Rabat visiting Tangier. If you can make 
yourself understood, that will be sufficient, even if your 
pronunciation is very different.
It is for this reason I consider it useful to travel and 
listen  to  different  Moroccan  accents  when  possible.  I 
attempt to adapt my speech when I am in a new area. I've 
learned some interesting tidbits, but I know much more 
remains before me.
In  Fez  and  surrounding  areas,  an active  verb  is 
indicated by a “k” sound at the beginning, preceding the 
standard  conjugation.  In  Rabat,  this  changes  to  a  “t” 
sound. In other places, no sound is attached at all.

25
For the letter used in the joke,  ق –  qoph, some 
places will pronounce it deep in the throat like in Modern 
Standard Arabic. Other areas will change it to a “g” or a 
“â”
1 or even a “k” sound. 
This is what makes transcribing darija so difficult. It 
makes  a  joke  told  in  one  area  and  transcribed  using 
phonetic  symbols  quite  difficult  to  comprehend  for 
someone who has learned darija in a different region.
Also of note, in Modern Standard Arabic you have 
to be very careful when pronouncing a word. The careless 
changing  of  one  short  vowel  can  render  a completely 
different meaning. 
Moroccan  darija  bypasses  this  complication  by 
omitting short vowels much of the time. This causes the 
language to sound very staccato and even harsh to the 
untrained ear. 
Moroccans can understand the Arabic from places 
like  the  Middle  East,  but  people  from  those  regions 
usually find Moroccan darija incomprehensible. One good 
reason for this is that much of the media produced for the 
1ع, or “ayen.”

26  -   Humor and Moroccan Culture
Arab world comes from either Lebanon or Egypt. Most 
Arabic speakers are familiar with those dialects. Morocco 
is the only place I know of where people watch television 
shows  and  movies  produced  by  Moroccans  in  the 
Moroccan dialect.  This  adds  to  the  general  perception 
among Moroccans that their native tongue is inadequate, 
or something to be embarrassed about. I disagree. I believe 
darija is a rich and amazing language that is just beginning 
to discover it's potential.
There are almost  no  books  written  in  Moroccan 
Arabic. Newspapers, most television and radio broadcasts, 
and  intellectual  interaction  occur  in  either  Modern 
Standard Arabic or French. These are languages that are 
completely foreign to Morocco and inaccessible to the half 
of Morocco that is functionally illiterate. It is only in the 
last few years that Moroccans have begun to create art, 
music, and literature using their native darija, but there is 
still very  little.  In  addition,  there  is  also  a movement 
among the Berbers  of  Morocco to begin teaching  and 
using their native language, Amazigh,  as well. This is 
creating some interesting controversy.
Communication in Morocco varies widely in style, 

27
accent, and even language. Whether you are traveling from 
town to town, region to region, or simply from home to 
home, you will discover a wide variety in the manners, 
customs,  and  languages  used  within  Morocco.  I 
continually  find  myself  talking  to  Moroccans  and 
discovering that each of us are using words from three or 
four different languages within the same sentence. I'm 
amused that neither of us consider this odd.
Visitors from the Arab Middle East tend to say, “I 
don't think these Moroccans are speaking Arabic.” I agree. 
They speak Moroccan. You can call it “darija,” you can 
call it “Moroccan Arabic,” you can even call it a “panache 
of languages.” I'm not sure you should call it, “Arabic.”

Always exceed expectations
هادا واحد الولد في المدرسة كسول بزاف. ديما مادايرش تمارين 
ديالو. قال ليه المعلم جيب باك. فاش جابه قال ليه المعلم ولدك 
مكلج. جاوبو الراجل ولدي ذكي بزاف. جا المعلم قال للولد سير 
قلب علي في القاعة خمسة. مشا الولد وعي يقلب. و جا رد على

There was a boy attending school who was very dumb and 
he never did his homework. The teacher told him, “Bring  
your father here.” The father arrived and said his son is  
very smart. The teacher told him to watch and sent the  
boy on an errand saying, “Look for me in room five.” The 
son returned and said, “You weren't there.” The father hit 
his son and told him, “If the teacher tells you to go to  
number five, you go to number six!”
All parents want their children to do well in school. 

29
They long for their kids to learn and have as many options 
for the future as possible. It is a real hope for most parents 
that their kids will have a better life than they enjoy. 
Moroccan parents are no different. The father in this story 
wants his son to study, learn, and excel in school. This will 
increase  the  boy's  chances  of  getting  a good  job  and 
having a comfortable life in the future. He wants it so 
much that he tells the boy, in a colloquial fashion, that no 
matter what the teacher asks of him, the boy needs to 
exceed those requests and expectations. 
This  is  a  beautiful  part  of  Moroccan  culture... 
unfortunately it is a belief that isn't held by all and is 
sometimes derided as being old fashioned or silly. There is 
an extreme societal pressure to succeed and a widespread 
societal shame attached to failure. Even so, some people 
say that you should only do what you are required to do in 
order to get by, that you should take life easy and not 
worry about the consequences. The attitude displayed by 
the father is one that is more traditional and it is still held 
by many in the society, especially those that end up in 
places of power, money, status or authority.
It seems that both the son, and the original creator of 

30  -   Humor and Moroccan Culture
the joke, have had significant contact with people who do 
not share these cultural mores. The joke is that the father 
is trying to teach his son the right lesson, but without fully 
understanding what the teacher has been saying. “If the 
teacher tells you to go to number five you go to number 
six,” makes no sense when discussing looking for a person 
whose location is already known, and yet its meaning is 
clear  enough.  It's  not  adequate  to  simply  fulfill  your 
requirements, you should go above and beyond them.
Why didn't the father understand? That really is the 
crux of the joke. Over the past 50 years or  so,  since 
Morocco  regained  its  independence,  there  have  been 
amazing and drastic changes in this society. Some of the 
changes began under the French protectorate era and have 
simply continued. Many of these changes are the result of 
new  technology,  easier  forms  of  travel  and 
communication, and the move from a predominantly rural, 
agrarian society to a predominantly urban, manufacturing 
and  industrial  society.  Some  of  these  are  factors  that 
societies are struggling with,  or  have worked  through, 
everywhere in the world.
The father is a poor man, probably from a rural 

31
setting, who holds to traditional values. His beliefs and 
culture are in direct conflict with some of the changes he 
is witnessing in the society at large. It would not be an 
exaggeration to call him a symbol of a much larger group 
within Moroccan society. 
This  group  has  faithfully  supported  three  kings 
since independence
1, Mohamed V,  Hassan II, and now 
Mohamed VI. The elders of this group have watched their 
land go from  having  few roads,  almost  none of  them 
paved,  to  having  modern  highways.  Train  access  is 
available now in all major cities and many of the smaller 
ones. Other recent changes involve airplanes, telephones, 
electricity, running water, radio and television. The list 
continues with the introduction and rapid spread of mobile 
phones and high speed internet access. The bulk of these 
modern  conveniences  are  considered  a  blessing  by 
members of this social group, even though they bring with 
them societal changes that are difficult and uncomfortable.
The sad part of living in the midst of rapid change is 
that some people, while witnessing and experiencing the 
1 In the case of Mohamed V, well before independence, during the 
struggle to achieve it, and afterward until his early death.

32  -   Humor and Moroccan Culture
change, can also be left out of it. This sub-group within 
Moroccan society is overwhelmingly favorable toward the 
government,  education,  and  “modernization,”  whatever 
that specifically means to them. Yet, many of them have 
not  personally  benefited  the  way  their  children, 
grandchildren,  and  future  generations  have  and  will. 
Amazingly, most don't seem to care so much about that.
In  general,  members  of  this  generation  have  an 
outlook on life that is longer in scope than what people 
growing up in already fully industrialized societies tend to 
have. This group tends to think in terms of generations, 
not years. They are content to see changes occur if they 
believe  it  will  truly  benefit  their  heirs,  even  if  they 
themselves  are not  privileged  to  share in the benefits. 
What a beautiful perspective!
The author of this joke is pointing out this very fact. 
It is as if he is saying, “Poor man. You want your son to 
excel, but you don't know what you want him to excel at.” 
Therein  lies  the  tension.  The  father  sees  all  that  has 
happened around him and he is convinced that it is for 
good. He believes that his son will benefit if the son will 
work and study, but he has no idea what the son is being 

33
taught and no way to comprehend what the boy is being 
told to do. For the father the phrase “Go to number five” 
could mean anything, but because he has an innate trust in 
the leaders, the educators, and the government, he tells the 
boy to go beyond, and “go to number six.”
Some might say this joke is a mean swipe being 
taken at an undeserving segment of society. I tend to see it, 
however, as someone from the younger segment that has 
benefited,  trying  to  make  sense  of  his  most  recent 
ancestors' generation and sacrifices. The story is funny 
because it has an unexpected twist at the end, but it is sad 
as well. Many of those who have worked hard to enable 
Morocco to achieve the wonders it has achieved in such a 
short time, have been unable to share in the benefits of 
their labor.

One day Juha went to his friend's house and asked him for 
a large amount of money. His friend asked him, “What 
are you going to do with that much money, Juha?” Juha  
answered,  “I'm  going  to  buy  an  elephant.”  “An 
elephant?” his friend responded, “What are you thinking, 
Juha? You don't have a place big enough for an elephant  
to live in. You don't have enough money to buy food for an 
elephant?  What  are  you  thinking,  my  friend?”  Juha 
answered, “I asked you for money, not advice.”

35
Juha is an interesting character in North African, 
and Middle Eastern folklore. He is similar to the Mullah 
Nasser ed-din in Turkey. He's part jester and part wise 
man. He can say what everyone is thinking, but would 
never say, and he can get away with it. Sometimes stories 
about him impart wisdom, sometimes they're just amusing 
observations of human nature. In every case, though, there 
is some tidbit of insight into the human condition that 
comes from a Juha story.
In this story, Juha asks his neighbor for money. This 
is a more common occurrence in Morocco than in many of 
the places I have been. Life here seems to retain some 
aspects of ancient tribal culture that are not understood 
elsewhere. People live at a more communal level. The 
ideas of individualism and self-reliance are considered a 
bit odd and extremely selfish. The prevailing perspective 
is one based on community. 
Decisions are usually made with respect to how they 
will affect the family, not just what might be best for the 
individual. Nice things that are purchased by one family 
are generally available to be used by the family's friends 
and neighbors, if and when there is a need. For example, 

36  -   Humor and Moroccan Culture
no one needs to buy all the necessities for a large party. If 
one family has a large pot, they will lend it freely to a 
friend that needs it. In return when they need to borrow 
their  friend's  serving  tray  for  a  special  event,  it  is 
available.  These  are  basic  understandings  and 
expectations.
I remember one instance when a family bought a 
new radio. Their neighbors were foreigners and couldn't 
understand why this family had to play their radio so 
loudly all day long. When they finally asked the family to 
please  turn  the  radio  down  a  bit  the  foreigners  were 
greeted with a bemused expression. You see, the family 
thought  that  playing  the  radio  loudly  was  an  act  of 
kindness. They knew that not everyone in the building had 
one, so they were trying to share.
How different that is from the standard in my home 
country, where we expect to never hear our neighbors 
unless  we  are  each  outside  at  the  same  time  and 
intentionally  turn  to  greet  one  another!  We  have 
expressions like,  “Good fences make good neighbors,” 
and believe that the best way to get along while living in 
close proximity is to live so that no one else knows we're 

37
here. We also say, “Neither a borrower nor a lender be.” 
Imagine how I was taken aback the first time a Moroccan 
neighbor  came  to  me  and  asked  if  he  could  borrow 
something of mine.
What Juha has done is perfectly natural in his home 
setting,  even  if  he  was  asking  for  an extremely  large 
amount of money. If it was within his friend's power to 
give it to Juha, he would. What's more interesting is that 
the friend would be likely to give, even to the point of 
self-deprivation if necessary, to help a friend or family 
member.
When asking for help, Juha knew there would be 
strings attached. Whenever someone does something for 
you,  especially if it  is  done by  your  request,  you  are 
obliged to repay the favor in some way. There is a cultural 
expectation or reciprocity in friendships and relationships 
that cannot be eliminated. For this reason, some people 
will limit the number of close friendships they have. They 
may even choose to only be friends with people in their 
extended family or clan. This doesn't mean that every time 
a  person  does  something  for  you  he  is  trying  to  get 
something  from  you.  It  is,  however,  very  easy  to  be 

38  -   Humor and Moroccan Culture
perceived as greedy or ungrateful by not reciprocating 
hospitality.
It is common for conversations in Arabic to be more 
direct than they are in English. An English speaker would 
not likely say to his friend, “What are you thinking?” 
unless  he  was  truly  shocked  or  offended.  There  are 
linguistic  and  cultural reasons  for  this.  In  Arabic,  the 
passive  voice  is  rarely  used,  especially  in  casual  and 
informal  conversation.  Instead,  things  are said  using  a 
more declarative and definite form of expression. In the 
place of, “Do you think that's wise?” a more common way 
to question behavior would be to say, “What, are you 
crazy?” In place of, “Do you like this?” you are more 
likely to hear, “This is great, isn't it?”
In order to communicate in a different culture and 
language, you need to learn more than vocabulary and 
grammar. You may be able to translate the words and even 
the main ideas of a conversation. Without understanding 
what is and is not polite, the subtext of a conversation is 
very easily misunderstood. 
Now to the punch line. There are two things going 
on  here  worth  noting.  First  of  all,  it  is  typical  when 

39
someone requests something of you to either say “Yes” 
and give it to them, or “God willing, I will be able to do 
that for you later.” The second response implies you love 
this person asking so much that you would never refuse a 
direct request they made of you, even though there is no 
possible way you  could  ever  fulfill this  request
1.  You 
might say, “I'm so sorry, please excuse me, I would love to 
help but there is no way I can.” This third response is not 
typical, but is still within the bounds of politeness, because 
it allows the one making the request to save face, it shows 
him respect. 
The first time I heard this joke I thought Juha's 
friend was being rude and demeaning to Juha and was 
reacting to him out of anger. That isn't how my friend, 
who told me the joke, thought of it at all. What we are 
witnessing is the casual banter of two close friends having 
fun one with another. Just as you might say something to 
your best friend that you would never say to someone else 
(eg. “Go jump in a lake!” or worse), Juha's friend is trying 
to get away with not giving Juha the money by making a 
1 In this case, the answer is understood to be “no” even though it is 
never said.

40  -   Humor and Moroccan Culture
joke  himself.  He  expresses  his  shock  at  Juha's  plan 
through an inappropriate form of refusal. Then Juha says 
what no one else could get away with, “I just want your 
money, not your advice.”
1
1 This  implies  that  Juha  thinks  his  friend's  money  is  more 
important than his friend's thoughts, and even more important 
than the friend himself. No  one except Juha would ever say 
something like this unless he intended to offend.

41
Who are you going to trust?
،واحد نهار جى عند جحا صحابو و طلب يسلفو حمار. قال جحا 
”حمار ديالي ماكاينش.“ فهذه الوقت الحمار ديال جحا بدا يغوت 
بصوت علي. و سمعو صاحبو، ”قلتني بلي هو ماكيانش.“ جوب 
“جحا، ”شكون كتيق واش أنا ول حمار؟
One day Juha's friend came to his house and asked to  
borrow Juha's donkey. Juha said, “My donkey isn't here.” 
At that moment the donkey began braying loudly. Juha's 
friend heard it and said, “I thought you said the donkey 
isn't here.” Juha replied, “Who are you going to believe, 
me or a donkey?”
As noted in the previous chapter, the things Juha 
says and does are not always right. They do, however, tend 
to  contain  some  interesting  information  about  cultural 
values. Here we have another instance of borrowing and 

42  -   Humor and Moroccan Culture
lending behavior being twisted slightly. You can guess 
from our earlier discussion that Juha was supposed to let 
his neighbor use his donkey. In most instances that would 
be true. Exceptions to this expectation would be made if 
Juha had need of the donkey for work, or if the animal was 
in need  of  rest  because it  had  been  used  recently,  or 
because it would be used soon. None of these cases seem 
to apply.
Juha  tells  his  friend  the  donkey  isn't  there.  He 
doesn't embarrass his friend by saying, “You can't use my 
donkey.” That would shame his friend. It would be saying 
that  the  donkey  was  more  important  to  Juha than  his 
friend. Apparently Juha just doesn't want to lend it out. 
This presents a problem for Juha. How can he refuse his 
friend's request while allowing the friend to save face? 
Simple, he tells a lie. This really is the lesser of two evils 
in a place where lying is far less of a crime than subjecting 
someone to humiliation.
A friend of mine in Jordan has heard the same joke 
told with the additional information that Juha's neighbor 
had  previously  and  repeatedly  borrowed  the  donkey, 
always returning it in worse condition. In that instance, 

43
Juha could be saving his friend's face by choosing not to 
confront him about his poor treatment of the donkey and 
instead covering up the friend's shame with a lie.
Some parts of Moroccan society are well adapted to 
a more Western style of thinking in this regard and have 
no trouble discussing what they will do, when and how. 
For these groups it doesn't matter at all if I ask them a 
direct question, they will answer truthfully with a “yes” or 
“no.” For others, however, especially those who are more 
traditional in their upbringing and personal demeanor, a 
direct question can create a genuine conundrum. If they 
are able to say “yes” honestly, it is done with great joy and 
exuberance. If they really can't do what I am asking them, 
however, they will never tell me “no.” 
In those cases the, “yes, God willing
1,” is said with 
enough exuberance for me to believe it is something they 
genuinely want to participate in or do, but with an attempt 
to communicate to me via subtext that what I am asking is 
really impossible, unless God intervenes supernaturally. 
The difference is quite subtle and the cues can change 
1 In Arabic, إن شئ ال

44  -   Humor and Moroccan Culture
from family to family or even person to person.
I have decided not  to ask certain of my friends 
direct questions, if it can be avoided. This way, they are 
not put in a position where they feel they have to lie to me, 
either to save their face or mine. For example, instead of 
asking, “Will you come to my house on Friday?” and 
always receiving an answer of, “Yes, God willing,” and 
wondering if I will actually see the person Friday or not, I 
will now ask, “Are you free on Friday? I'm thinking of 
making a special meal.” In this way my friend can answer 
honestly, “I can come, what time were you thinking?” or, 
“I'll be traveling to Rabat on Friday so I can't be there.” 
The difference is small but it is an important one, since 
clear communication is the goal. Instead of saying, “May I 
come and borrow your ladder tomorrow?” I will ask if the 
ladder  is  available  for  people  to  borrow,  which  will 
sometimes elicit a, “No, I don't like to lend it out,” or a, 
“when would you like to use it?” Admittedly, this is a 
workaround solution and is not perfectly natural for the 
society. Even after five years of living in Morocco, I still 
find it too easy as a foreigner to confuse a, “Yes, I will 
definitely do that,” and a, “Yes, that will happen if God 

45
performs a miracle to change the current circumstances, 
but I love you too much to say anything else.” This is how 
I have adapted.
Back to Juha and his friend. Juha lies to save his 
friend's honor, while at the same time covering up his own 
(rather selfish and societally shameful) desire not to lend 
his donkey. Then the donkey exposes the fraud. What can 
Juha do? He can't tell a more obvious lie and say a donkey 
didn't bray. He can't admit to lying without humiliating 
himself greatly and causing his friend shame. 
The friend  violates  societal  norms  as  only  close 
friends can do. He pushes the issue with Juha. “I thought 
you said the donkey wasn't here.” He's teasing Juha by 
saying the equivalent of, “Dude, you just lied to me. The 
donkey's braying right there, we can both hear it!” Juha 
wins by upping the stakes immensely, “Who are you going 
to believe, me or a donkey?”
In this society, the three worst names you can call a 
person are dog, Jew, or donkey (and not necessarily in that 
order). Use any of the above three names and you are 

46  -   Humor and Moroccan Culture
likely to find yourself engaged in an angry and ugly fight.
1 
Morocco is a country where people are legally free 
to practice their  religion  and where I have lived  as a 
Christian peacefully alongside a massive Muslim majority 
(qbout  99%)  and  a  small  Jewish  population  scattered 
around  the  country.  Stories  have  been  told  to  me  by 
dozens of different people about how, for over a thousand 
years, the Jewish people have been welcomed in Morocco 
and have lived here as an important part of this society. I 
1 While I can't address this racist attitude as I would like to in this 
book, I would like to mention the following observation. The way 
Morocco has dealt with Jews through it's history has been mixed. 
One beautiful event occurred a few years before independence. 
During the rise of Nazism in Germany, Hitler sent a message to 
Mohamed V saying that in return for the expulsion of all Jews 
from Morocco, he would support and fight for Morocco's right to 
self-rule. Mohamed V replied that there are no Jews or Muslims 
in Morocco, no Berbers nor Arabs—there are only Moroccans. 
On the other hand, at independence in 1956 there were 300,000 
Jews in Morocco out of a total population of ten million. Today 
there are about 5,000 in a land of over thirty million people. Most 
Jews have emigrated to Israel. Discussing why would require 
further research so I'll leave that alone for now.

47
certainly have no  desire nor  means  to  argue with  the 
prevailing opinion of the masses, but I cannot deny that 
every time I have heard someone call someone else a Jew 
(who is not one) a fight has broken out. Juha doesn't take it 
quite that far, but in Moroccan society a donkey is only 
better by a small degree.
To solve his problem Juha forces his friend into an 
uncomfortable situation. To answer Juha's question, the 
friend must either say Juha is less than a donkey (at the 
risk  of  losing  his  friendship  forever),  or  say  that  the 
donkey is  lying  and  cause himself  embarrassment.  No 
wonder the friend's answer isn't recorded.

There was a man from the country who went to a store in  
the city. He said to the worker there, “Please sell me this 
television.” The man answered him, “We don't sell those 
to country people.” The country dweller left, went home 
and began to study to improve his language skills. He  
bought new clothes like the ones people wear in the city.  
After a year, he returned to the store and asked again,  
“Sell me that television.” The answer was the same, “We 

49
don't sell those to country people.” The man asked, “How 
did you know I'm from the country? My clothes are nice. I  
studied  hard  and  now  I  can  speak  well  with  a  good 
accent. What's going on?” The worker answered, “That's 
not a television, it's a washing machine.”
Once I was visiting in Rabat and I took my family 
for lunch to a well-known international pizza restaurant. 
We sat down, looked at the menu, everything was familiar 
to us. We thought about it a while and decided to buy 
more pizza than we needed, so we could take some back to 
our hotel to eat for dinner later. That way we wouldn't 
have to go out in the evening when the kids were tired. 
The waiter returned and I ordered the largest pizza 
on the menu for my family. He told me it was too big for 
my family and that I can't order it. Amused and a little 
shocked, I presumed I must have misunderstood. I asked 
him again to please bring us the largest pizza on the menu. 
He kindly and patiently told me that pizza is designed to 
feed 8 people and there were only 4 of us sitting there. 
That would be too much pizza for us. I tried explaining 
that we wanted to get extra to take with us afterward to eat 

50  -   Humor and Moroccan Culture
later. He looked at me quizzically and walked away.
Moments  later  the  manager  of  the  restaurant 
appeared and spoke to me in English. I told him we would 
like to order the extra-large pizza please. He said, in a 
beautiful  British  accent,  that  I  can't  order  that  pizza 
because it is too big for my family, but he would be happy 
to bring us an appropriately sized pizza with the same 
toppings. I relented and we ended up eating dinner at the 
hotel restaurant that night.
Anywhere I go, in any store, no matter what I try to 
buy, the first question is invariably, “Why do you need 
that?” or “What are you trying to do?” Everyone wants to 
make sure I don't buy something I don't need, whether I 
think I need it or  not.  I've had the automobile dealer 
absolutely refuse to perform maintenance early, even after 
I told him I wasn't worried about the cost, that I was 
planning to take a long trip, and I didn't want to worry 
about my oil, filter, tires, or whatever. This trend can be 
amusing, frustrating or helpful depending on the situation.
I got to thinking one day about how this social norm 
came about. I noted previously that this is a community 
based culture, not an individual based culture. Decisions 

51
are made using a different standard than I am used to. In 
the United States, for example, if someone wants to buy an 
item,  and  they  have  the  money  to  pay  for  it,  the 
shopkeeper gladly makes the exchange. After all it isn't 
any of his business whether the person needs the item or 
not, and it can always be returned if there's a problem.
I  think  there  are  several  reasons  for  people's 
reticence to sell you things in this culture. First of all, 
returns are only allowed if the item is defective, and even 
that is only true in a small number of stores. In most 
places, the store clerk will open the item in front of you 
and show you how to use it. He will even plug it in if 
necessary to make sure it functions properly before you 
leave the store. Why? Because once you give him your 
money the transaction is final. You can't return things in 
most places, and you can never return an item just because 
you don't need it, you bought the wrong thing, or the color 
didn't match when you got it home. The clerk who refuses 
to sell you an item you don't “need” is trying to protect 
you from the disappointment you are sure to experience if 
he lets you leave with an item that is unsuitable for your 
needs.

52  -   Humor and Moroccan Culture
That  leads  me  to  the  second  reason.  It  is  an 
unspoken rule here that the strong should always protect 
the weak, that the educated will look out for the interests 
of the ignorant, that those with means will help the poor. 
The safest assumption a store keeper can make about his 
clients is that they do not know what he knows about his 
products and their uses. Therefore, he must protect them 
from their own ignorance. He must tell them which is the 
best product that will suit the customer's needs. This is a 
way to ensure repeat business, especially if the clerk is 
good at his job.
When I tell this joke, no one is surprised or amused 
at the clerk's refusal to sell the television set to the man, 
they  generally  applaud  it.  How  is  the  clerk  to  know 
whether the man has electricity in his house? What if the 
man spends a large amount of money to buy the set only to 
get  it  home and  discover  there is  no broadcast  signal 
available for him to watch? If the country dweller doesn't 
know the difference between  a television  and  a front-
loading, glass-windowed, clothes washing machine, how 
can he be expected to understand and answer all these 
sorts of more detailed questions? No, the sales clerk is a 

53
hero because he's taking care of his fellow man, a man 
who might mean well, but who appears to be ignorant.
The part people laugh about is that someone could 
find a way to earn enough money to buy a new television 
(they aren't cheap in Morocco) and somehow not learn 
how to distinguish one from a washing machine. Here's 
another example of a class of society that wants to be a 
part of all the change occurring around it, but has thus far 
not fully benefited. 
What encourages me is that I can't recall anyone 
laughing  at  this  joke  in  any  way  other  than  simple 
amusement. It's a funny problem, but I don't see people 
mocking the country dweller for his ignorance.
1 Instead, 
people who have told these sorts of jokes to me chuckle at 
the silliness and proceed to tell me how important it is to 
take care of people in this situation and that it is our duty 
to protect one another from making big mistakes.
1 Some of my friends who read the manuscript told me they have 
heard this joke and similar ones told in a way that does mock the 
ignorance of these people. For the sake of completeness I want to 
note that my experience is not universal.

There was a policeman and he was corrupt. He always 
stopped people and asked them for bribes. One day he 
worked all day and didn't stop anyone. He realized as the 
sun was going down that he didn't have anything in his  
pocket so he said to himself, “I'm going to stop the next  
person I see.” Shortly thereafter, there came a man riding 

55
a new moped. The moped appeared to be working fine, the 
man was wearing his helmet, but the policeman stopped  
him anyway. The man's papers were all in order and the 
corrupt policeman couldn't find a reason to ask for a 
bribe. He said to the man, “Aren't you scared to be riding 
out here all by yourself?” The man answered, “I'm not by 
myself, I have God and the Prophet with me.” The corrupt  
policeman responded, “Three of you on that little moped? 
You'll have to pay a fine.”
I have had an internal debate for months whether to 
include this joke or not. It was told to me in Casablanca 
years ago and I assumed Morocco had changed, that the 
joke was an extremely old one and that nothing like this 
could happen in a country that is so set on modernization 
and which speaks so consistently about the rule of law. 
Then I got stopped by a policeman for no reason and he 
asked me for a bribe.
Before anyone protests, I will own up to deserving a 
fine  or  two.  I  have been  stopped  while  speeding  and 
willingly paid the price I deserved to pay. I have also been 
stopped  while  speeding  and  experienced  mercy  at  the 

56  -   Humor and Moroccan Culture
hands of a policeman who gave me a warning and sent me 
on my way. In addition, I have been stopped at security 
checkpoints at random. These things are not unusual nor 
frustrating. In this instance, however, I can honestly say I 
had done nothing wrong. 
I was  driving  in Rabat.  As  I passed  through  an 
intersection, the traffic light turned yellow. The policeman 
was a little bit further down the road. When I arrived to 
where he was, he pulled me over and told me the light was 
red when I entered the intersection, and that I would have 
to pay a fine.
My first thought was that I don't want to upset this 
guy, so let's just see what's going on. He asked me for my 
papers and we had a nice conversation in Arabic about my 
life, where I live, what I do for a living, and so on. He then 
handed me my papers back without filling out a traffic 
report or ticket.
Next he told me that the fine for my “infraction” 
was 400 Dirhams (about $45 US Dollars at the time) and 
he asked me if I wanted to pay the fine. I looked him 
straight in the eye and with an incredulous expression and 
asked, “Of course not, why would I want to pay a fine?” It 

57
was at this moment that I was informed of another way to 
solve the problem.
The policeman asked me what I was going to give 
him  (to  his  credit,  he  never  actually  used  the  word 
“bribe”). I gave him my “dumb” look and said, “What do 
you mean?” Then we went through the “do you want to 
pay the fine?” series of questions/responses again. He said 
again, “What are you going to give me?” 
It  was  a very  hot  day  and  I  had  a brand  new, 
unopened bottle of cold water sitting beside me on the 
passenger's seat. I picked up the bottle and offered it to 
him. He responded by saying that was nothing and he 
could buy his own water, pointing out a store across the 
street. “What are you going to give me?”
So I did it. I told him this joke. Now, I was cautious. 
I repeatedly said things like, “I know nothing like this 
could ever happen in Morocco today,” and, “He is nothing 
like you, I know you're a good man, an honest man, just 
trying to keep people safe on the road.” I made sure to 
give the policeman lots of eye contact while embellishing 
the tale as much as I could—it probably took me 5 or 6 
minutes to tell it. At the end I began laughing hysterically. 

58  -   Humor and Moroccan Culture
I asked, “Isn't that funny? Three on one “motor
1!” He 
asked him to pay! Ha ha ha ha ha...” and stretched out my 
hand for the policeman to shake.
The  policeman  looked  at  me  uncomfortably  and 
laughed a little bit.  He shook  my  hand. He then said 
meekly, “Is the water cold?” I gladly gave him the bottle 
and he waved me off.
So what happened here? Well, for starters, as I told 
the story, I continually praised the police officer and his 
country. The only way he could claim I had done anything 
insubordinate or inappropriate would require him to claim 
I had said something specific against him or his country. I 
hadn't,  at  least  not  directly.  The  police  officer  wasn't 
willing to lie about this and cause me shame because that 
would elicit a very strong,  combative response in this 
culture. I allowed him to save face, and he made sure my 
honor remained intact as well. In retrospect, I'm not sure 
this would have worked if a third person had been present.
Another possible reason this worked is that if the

policeman had claimed that it was my intention to say 
something against him or Morocco, after I had explicitly 
said the opposite, then he would be admitting that  he 
thought there was something wrong with his country. That 
is what would be required to draw this conclusion since I 
had been so insistent in saying the opposite. There was no 
way the policeman would shame himself by admitting that 
he had even  entertained  the thought  that  he might  be 
dishonest or that there might be something wrong with his 
country.
All of this is true because Moroccan society has 
traditionally been based on a system of honor and shame. 
Unlike  the  West,  where  the  values  held  most  dearly 
include things like truth and justice, Morocco and other 
eastern cultures prize honor and respect above all. Honor 
comes from how you are perceived by others. If you are a 
good man you will have certain character traits. This will 
earn for you the respect of the community. 
Gaining or losing the respect of others is a primary 
motive in social interaction; actions are chosen based on 
how others will perceive the actor, not necessarily on an 

60  -   Humor and Moroccan Culture
objective standard of right and wrong. Shame is what one 
feels when the community perceives a person in a poor 
light and their status is diminished. The quickest way to 
initiate a fight is to do something that causes shame. The 
easiest way to earn someone's favor is to help them gain 
honor. Your actions and words will communicate what 
you  think  of  the  person,  whether  you  think  they  are 
important or not, good or bad, valuable or worthless. I 
have found that people here tend to become what your 
words and actions imply you think they are. If you treat 
people with great respect they act more respectable when 
they are around you. If you treat (most) people as if they 
are trustworthy, they strive to be worthy of the trust you 
place in them.
The question remains, did the policeman understand 
what I was saying? Did he know I was calling him corrupt 
and telling him he shouldn't ask people for bribes? Of 
course he did. However, telling him in this way allowed 
him to hear the message without any direct assault on his 
honor. He wasn't happy with me, but there was no cultural 
basis for him to rise up and defend his honor because his 
honor was not attacked. 

61
As I drove away the policeman said one last thing to 
me. We had discussed this book as I was in the early 
stages of writing it. He called out after me as I drove away, 
“You're not a writer, you're a preacher!”
1 I'm completely 
certain he understood the point of my story.
One of the more difficult aspects, for an American 
adapting to this  culture,  is learning how to effectively 
communicate  disagreement,  disappointment  and 
frustration  without  causing  people  unnecessary  shame. 
While there are moments when causing someone to lose 
face  is  necessary  and  even  desirable,  these  are  the 
exceptions, not the rule. In general, I believe that it is a 
good idea to try to live at peace with all people, as much as 
it is within your power. Communication in this manner is 
an art form that has been practiced and improved upon 
over thousands of years.
It  is  not  necessary  in  Morocco  to  refrain  from 
voicing your opinion. On the contrary, telling people what 
you think is vital for friendships and other relationships to 
work. The art comes in the method of self-expression. 
1 “انت ماشي كاتب، انت خاطب” He used the informal title of the man 
who gives the sermon in the mosque after the Friday prayers.

62  -   Humor and Moroccan Culture
How  do  you  tell  someone  you  think  they  are  wrong 
without making them feel as if their honor is at stake? 
Here are a few ideas I have picked up.
Stories  are  useful  tools,  especially  if  they  are 
humorous in nature. Humor takes the edge off of bad news 
and a good story will make your point as clearly as if you 
said what you were thinking directly
1, but because it is 
someone else who is the direct object of the action your 
listeners won't feel personally attacked, or at least will feel 
that their honor is intact.
If you can learn traditional proverbs and maxims in 
the local language you will endear yourself to your hosts 
and give yourself a way to say what you are thinking, 
without putting yourself on the hot seat. Calling up a bit of 
ancient, sage advice can be invaluable. 
This also works in English. If someone is doing 
things  slowly we  might  say,  “The  early  bird  gets  the 
worm,” in an attempt to speed him up a bit. If he is going 
too quickly and doing a sloppy job we could say, “Haste 
1 The  epilogue  of  this  book  contains  a  good  example  of  a 
Moroccan doing this. You can read it after this chapter or save it 
for later.

63
makes waste.” What makes people stop and listen isn't so 
much  what  we  believe,  but  rather  that  the  listener 
recognizes  the  phrase  as  culturally  appropriate  and 
applicable in the current situation.
In the same way, if my Moroccan friend is trying to 
learn how to play the guitar but keeps forgetting to bring 
his instrument to his lesson I could say, “He who does not 
have pen and ink does not intend to study.”
1 Appealing to 
commonly held “wisdom” is a good way to bring insight 
and perspective into a situation without causing offense. 
Saying, “I don't think you have any intent to learn the 
guitar...you never bring your instrument to the lesson,” 
would certainly offend.
Another thing that I have done that works well is 
ask a friend, who is not involved in the situation, to act as 
a mediator. This friend can say directly what I cannot say, 
and will do so while I am somewhere else. “Matthew is 
upset  with  you  because  you  took  his  bicycle  without 
asking him first. It is important to him to know what's 
going on. He thought someone had stolen it and was about 
1لي ماعندوه قلم ول دوية مامعول على القرية

64  -   Humor and Moroccan Culture
to report it to the police.” I may never actually talk about 
the situation with the person causing me the problem, but 
we will both know what the other is thinking this way. The 
third party will usually speak very directly and clearly on 
behalf of each of us and work hard to smooth things over. 
Unity within a community is important in a place 
where people used to (and sometimes still) live their whole 
lives in the neighborhood where they were born. They 
think, “If this is someone I will have to see for the rest of 
my life, then I don't want there to be bad blood between us 
forever.” In a situation like this, good relationships are 
more important than who is right. That would have rung 
truer in the days of nomadic tribes or inter-village warfare 
when  the  lives  of  people  in  the  community  were 
completely interdependent.
If things get to a point where I cannot communicate 
my thoughts effectively without being direct, then I will 
prepare the listener to hear the bad news. “Look, you are 
my friend. I love you like a brother. You know that you 
are important to me and that I respect you. Still, I think 
you're wrong.” In this way I am telling the person that they 
are valuable to me and that I don't want what I have to say 

65
to come between us, but rather that I want to work it out. 
This is a less common solution here, and is therefore not 
as well-rehearsed. It ends up being far more difficult, but I 
have had it work.

There was a doctor for the insane and one day he wanted 
to find out if his patients were healthy or not. He took 
three of them to an empty swimming pool and sat down to 
see what would happen. One man ran to the pool, jumped 
in and hit his head because there was no water. The  
second man tried to enter the pool slowly using the stairs 
because he thought the water was cold. The last one sat  
down and did nothing. The doctor wondered if he might  

67
be healthy so we went to him to ask why he hadn't done  
like his brothers
1. The man responded, “If I drown, will 
you save me?”
This joke has so many variations I have lost count. 
In fact, I'm sure I remember fewer than half of the ones I 
have heard. 
There's the one about the time the doctor took the 
patients to a room with no doors or windows (like when 
you  watch  a  good  Hollywood  movie,  suspension  of 
disbelief is required here). He takes out a pen and draws a 
door on the wall and watches. One guy hurts his head 
trying  to  knock  the  door  down.  Another  keeps  trying 
unsuccessfully to grab the doorknob and open the door. 
The third sits down. When asked why he didn't do like his 
brothers I have heard two different replies, both of which 
amuse me. In one account he simply says, “I don't have the 
key.” In another he looks serious and says, “Shh. I have 
1 It is common in Moroccan culture to call people “brother” even 
when they are not a part of your family, or in this instance, part of 
the same family. The doctor uses “brothers” here to emphasize 
that all three men are together in the same situation.

68  -   Humor and Moroccan Culture
the key in my pocket.”
Another time the doctor takes them to an empty 
room and tells the patients there is a party. Some dance to 
the imaginary music. Others try to eat the non-existent 
food. One lady
1 sits and does nothing. When asked why 
she  doesn't  do  like  her  brothers  she  replies,  “I'm  the 
bride.”
2
The key to each of these is the unexpected,  but 
logical twist. Granted, the patients are still insane, but their 
explanations actually make some sense within their falsely 
constructed worlds.
If  we  look  closely  at  ourselves  and  our  home 
1 This is the only time I've heard a version of this joke with a 
woman in it and it certainly wouldn't make any sense otherwise.
2 It might help if I note here that at Moroccan wedding parties the 
bride sits on  a special  platform wearing stunningly beautiful 
clothes and participates very little in the revelry, except as an 
observer. She will slip out occasionally to change into another 
equally beautiful outfit, only to return to her throne and preside 
over the festivities. The only other time I have seen the bride get 
up is when certain of her family/friends pick up her throne while 
she is sitting on it and dance/carry her around the party while 
singing and chanting. It's quite fun, really.

societies we will discover that almost every happening, 
action and tradition, from covering your mouth when you 
yawn, to extending a hand to shake as a greeting, has an 
explanation of some sort, if only we are willing to dig deep 
enough  to  discover  it.  Those  we  can't  figure  out  we 
presume had a reason at some time, but the reason has 
been lost. 
Humans tend to perceive the world in such a way 
that we are unconsciously unwilling to admit that things 
may  happen  or  exist  without  an  underlying  cause  or 
meaning. It seems that our emotional and psychological 
health depend, to some extent, on making sense out of our 
world. We can handle chaos and mystery for a time, but 
eventually we want to know; we want something solid to 
hold on to as an explanation. 
Social psychologists have come up with a theory 
which says that people prefer an absurd reason over no 
reason. That is, we will grasp for any explanation available 
to try to understand our surroundings, even if we know the 
reason is illogical.
In  my  opinion  these  jokes  are  not  only  about 
“crazy” people; we laugh at them because they reveal to us 

70  -   Humor and Moroccan Culture
a little bit about ourselves. We have a strong distaste for 
the mysterious and we will either do all in our power to 
uncover that which is hidden, or we will reach out for the 
nearest explanation we find that seems remotely possible. 
This is true in the West and it is also true in the East. It is 
true in older and newer societies. It is true in Morocco.
Morocco is a land where superstition runs deep. It is 
a land of mystery, a land of intrigue, a land where, up until 
recently, only a few people were privileged with good 
education.  Even  as  the  country  strives  to  educate  its 
population, the most recent figures I have seen report that 
only  half  of  the  people  are  functionally  literate.  This 
number is rising steadily, however, and the percentage is 
significantly higher among those under 30 years of age.
Like people all around the world, Moroccans want 
to understand what is happening around them. At times 
they  may  resign  themselves  to  the  mysterious  and 
unknowable will of God, but if it is remotely possible, 
they want to know why things happen. Even the typical 
response, “It was God's will,” hints at a grasping for the 
existence of underlying meaning in confusing events.
In a highly illiterate and community driven society 

71
rumors can start and spread very quickly. The winter of 
2005, there was a rumor that someone in Morocco had 
died of the Bird Flu that was engulfing the world with 
fear. Chicken prices dropped because people quit buying 
them. I was told the crisis ended when the king was seen 
eating chicken on television without getting sick
1. People 
needed  someone in authority,  someone they  trusted  to 
prove to them the rumors were false. It wasn't enough that 
the  supposed  death  had  never  been  substantiated  (and 
actually had not occurred). An appeal to a higher power or 
authority was needed.
Every place I have been in Morocco has a mosque, 
not  just  every  city,  but  every  neighborhood.  Far  less 
known  is  that  nearly  every  neighborhood  also  has  a 
sahher,
2 a magician or sorcerer. This is a witch doctor who 
will concoct potions, cast spells, write special prayers or 
talismans to put in your amulet of protection and a ton of 
other interesting things. 
1 Even if this never happened, the rumor that the king had eaten 
chicken  in  public  with  no  negative  repercussions  would  be 
enough to dispel the rumors.

This person's goal (at least those that truly believe in 
what  they  are  doing  and  who  are  not  intentional

control  through  magic charms  and  occult  practices.  In 
most cases I have heard or know of, these are men. In 
some cases they are even the local Imam (Muslim leader 
within the community)
1 who leads the prayers and may 
teach at the mosque.
If that isn't enough to satisfy the curious or worried, 
it  seems  each  neighborhood  also  has  a  local  seer

fortune teller. This is someone who will gladly attempt to

and say these things are incompatible with “true” or “pure” Islam. 
Having studied the faith according to what the books tell us, I 
would tend to agree. However, in practice, what I am describing 
is the position that these people are given in many communities. 
This is how they are perceived and treated by the masses. In 
regard  to  religion,  I  am  not  intending  to  write  about  the 
theoretical or theological aspects, but rather what I have observed 
being practiced. I will leave the argument regarding who is and 
who is not a Muslim to others.

necessarily. Interestingly, these are often women.
This  is  a  land  that  overwhelmingly  believes  in 
things beyond what can be seen with the eyes or observed 
using the scientific method. In some cases this comes as a 
direct result of a persistent and genuine faith in God and in 
the Qur'an, which speaks of angels,  demons, life after 
death and beings called jinns
1. In other cases, people's 
thoughts  and  feelings  have  been  manipulated,  using  a 
belief in the supernatural, to get people to act a certain 
way. 
Maybe that is where the common fear of pouring 
hot water down a sink drain came from. I have repeatedly 
been told that jinns live in drains and that they don't like 
hot water. Perhaps a plumber once made a poor repair on a 
drain  using  something  that  would  be  dissolved  in  hot 
water. Maybe he covered up his incompetence by using a 
story he heard about jinns liking holes in the ground,

without a basic understanding of Islam. At a minimum, 
one should know what the Qur'an is, what the five pillars 
of the Islamic faith are, and have some knowledge of the 
religion's basic beliefs. I will cover some of these in this 
chapter.
The Qur'an is the key to understanding this joke. 
The Qur'an is the holy book of Islam. It is said to be an 
eternal book existing in heaven that was revealed bit by bit 
over many years to an illiterate man named Mohamed, in a 
series of angelic visitations. The angel told Mohamed to 
memorize  and  recite  several  passages,  called  suras  or 
surat.  He  did  so  and  taught  others  to  memorize  the 
passages as well. 
After Mohamed's death all of the suras were written 
down and collected in the form in which we now find 
them. They are mostly ordered according to length, from 
the longest to the shortest, with one exception being the 
sura called the “Fatiha” or the opening, the beginning. 
This first sura is among the shortest and is one which is 
recited every time a Muslim prays.
There  are  ladies  named  Fatiha  throughout  the 
Arabic speaking world. The name is not an uncommon 

77
one. What makes this joke funny is that it is probably not 
this particular girl's name. She saw her friends, Yosef and 
Miryam,  have  to  recite  extremely  long  suras  simply 
because they had the same name as that sura. This girl, 
through quick thinking, saved herself a lot of work. I have 
heard  another  variation  of  this  joke  in  which  the  girl 
answers with the name of the second sura, which is also 
short and is recited by Muslims during their prayers. That 
variation is either funnier or less so, depending on your 
sense of humor. The second sura is named Baqara, “The 
Cow.”
The Islamic religion stands on five actions called 
“The Pillars.” They are the testimony, prayer, giving alms, 
fasting,  and  the  pilgrimage.
1 According  to  Muslim 
1 The  shahada  or  testimony  is  the  statement  of  faith  for  all 
Muslims,  “There  is  no  God  but  God  and  Mohamed  is  his 
prophet.” Salat or prayers are to be performed five times daily. 
Zakat, alms, are to be given to the poor with an annual minimum, 
which is a percentage of all assets. Sawm, or fasting, is required 
for all Muslims during the month of Ramadan and considered 
meritorious at other times. Finally, the hajj, the pilgrimage to 
Mecca, is required once in a lifetime of all who can afford to 
make it.

78  -   Humor and Moroccan Culture
teaching, all a person has to do to be a Muslim is say the 
testimony and truly believe it, and then try to perform all 
of these pillars sincerely.
There are some basic beliefs in Islam, but contrary 
to a faith like Christianity, which stresses orthodoxy, or 
correct belief, Islam stresses orthopraxy, or correct action. 
This is an important difference because it allows for a 
wide variety of specific beliefs to exist under the blanket 
of  Islam.  What  is  important  is  the  testimony  and  the 
striving  to  complete  the  pillars.  Anything  else  is 
secondary. There are a very small number of beliefs that 
are required in Islam.
The first and most vital of Muslim beliefs is the 
unity of God. In Islam there is only one God, and he 
accepts no partners. God is one. This is called the tawhid, 
and along with an acceptance of Mohamed as the prophet 
of God, the tawhid forms the basis for all faith.
Some  of  the  other  foundational  tenets  of  Islam 
include a belief that God has sent many prophets, but that 
Mohamed is the last and greatest among them. One must 
also believe in angels, in sacred books (all of which are 
usually said to have been lost or corrupted except for the 

79
Qur'an), in a final judgment of all people before God's 
throne, at which time he will decide whether a person 
spends  eternity  in  heaven  or  hell,  and  finally,  God's 
absolute sovereignty. 
This final doctrine, God's sovereignty, is important 
because it means that God is ruled by no one and by 
nothing outside of himself. It is impossible to know with 
any certainty what God will do. One must rely on God's 
will and favor, even regarding the final judgment. To say 
that one is assured of going to heaven is the equivalent of 
saying that God has limits and that his thoughts can be 
known by mere mortals...this is akin to heresy.
It has been my experience that it is impossible in 
Morocco to have a conversation on any topic with anyone 
without  God  entering  the  discussion.  There  is  an 
alternating sense of security and resignation in a life that is 
lived in surrender to the idea that God has foreordained 
what will happen, and that nothing can be done to alter his 
will.  This  has  a  profound  impact  on  societal  actions, 
trends, beliefs and understandings, and must be a part of 
any serious attempt to understand Moroccan culture.

ideals  do  not  always  match  actions.  Even  the  best  of 
intentions may fail. Additionally, one cannot ignore that 
there are people whose intentions are not as high and lofty 
as their words may appear. These are the ones this joke 
takes exception to.
This is not a joke against Islam nor any aspect of it. 
It is intended to highlight that one should not measure a 
man based  on  what  they  say  or  what  they  wear
1,  but 
instead  by  their  actions.  The  joke  is  not  saying  the 
pilgrimage is good or bad, but rather that going on the 
pilgrimage does not in and of itself make a person more 
respectable. Honor should be earned over time and with 
deeds of kindness, honesty and justice, not from the mere 
act of taking a trip...even a trip commanded by God.

One may be obedient in deeds and not submissive in 
the heart. This joke says that this sort of obedience is of 
absolutely no value whatsoever.
Worldwide, there are a number of people who claim 
to follow their religion from their heart but whose actions 
consistently tell a different story. We're all human. This 
joke, however, isn't about the occasional slip up or bad 
day; it is about hypocrisy.
Once, I was sitting in a government office waiting 
for a courier to arrive, to see if a paper I needed had been 
completed and signed. I have done this many times, and I 
have been treated very well in government offices all over 
the country. Sometimes employees are tired or maybe a 
little overworked and get a little gruff, but that happens. 
This particular day was different.
The paper I was waiting for was necessary, so I 
needed and wanted to stay on the workers' good side. 
Their work was the key to my living in their country. One 
slip and I might have to leave. I was not interested in 
discussing anything  controversial with  them,  nor  did  I

made the pilgrimage. This helps to illustrate my point.

want to do anything other than have them like me while I 
was there and forget  me once I left  with  the paper  I 
needed.
As it happened, work was slow that day, so the 
workers took advantage of the rare opportunity to speak 
with,  and  solicit  the  opinions  of  an  Arabic  speaking 
American, a genuine rarity. They asked me my opinions 
on Afghanistan, Iraq, Palestine/Israel, George W. Bush, 
and a host of other political issues. Then they asked me if I 
had become a Muslim yet.
The manner of the question didn't thrill me. “Yet?” I 
have no intention of becoming a Muslim. I answered that I 
have nothing against people being free to believe in Islam, 
but  that  I  have  no  desire  to  change  my  religion. 
Immediately, I was told that was fine and it is a horrible 
crime to try to change another person's religion, that one 
should  never  do  so

employee  telling  me  that  we  should  all  respect  one 
another's beliefs.
I told a story about how you can tell whether a 
person is good or bad. I said it isn't by what they wear or 
the words they say, it is by the results of their life. I 
pointed out the window at some trees and said, “How do 
you know that is an orange tree and that one is an olive 
tree?” Everyone answered, “By the fruit on the trees.” I 
said, “The fruit of your life will tell the people around you 
what kind of person you are.”
Then, the three workers present each told me in his 
own  way  that  I  seem  to  be  a  good  person,  so  most 
certainly God will bring me into Islam. They then asked 
me several times whether I wanted to become a Muslim, if 
I  had  ever  read  the  Qur'an
1,  and  implying  with  each 
question that I was less of a person because I am not a 
Muslim.
What alternately amuses and frustrates me here is 
you talk about your religion as a form of religious or political 
proselytizing is as abhorrent to me as is the giving of jobs, 
“sparing of lives” or other incentives in exchange for conversion.
1 I have read the Qur'an. In fact, I have even read it in Arabic.

that I have had this conversation at least a hundred times 
in different places. These are generally good people who 
mean well, but many don't believe what they are telling me
—that everyone should be allowed to follow whatever 
religion he wants to follow without being pressured or 
even encouraged to change it. 
The law in Morocco forbids proselytizing in any 
form so I'm not surprised that people say it is a bad thing 
to do. The law hasn't changed people's hearts, though, so 
they are living what they believe...that I should become a 
Muslim. At least on the surface.
Far more interesting and amusing to me are the 
numerous  times  I  have  had  this  conversation  with 
someone that I know doesn't live according the the most 
basic of Islamic tenets. I've actually confronted a couple of 
people on this
1 and been told, “Islam commands that I try 
to convince you  to  become  a Muslim,”  as the person 
shrugs off responsibility for their actions

them to sign.

to convert to Islam was followed by an attempt to give me some

My point is that the people around you know you by 
your  actions, no matter  how well you  think  you  have 
hidden the more unholy ones. Nobody is fooled forever by 
pretentious  exteriors  and  zealous  words,  and  there are 
many who see through them immediately.
That is the point of this joke. You can wear the right 
clothes,  you  can  say  the  right  words,  you  can  pray 
perfectly and have the answers to every question that may 
come  up,  but  if  your  heart  is  hard,  the  world  will 
ultimately know you for who and what you are.
I've chosen not to include any of the dozens of jokes 
I  have been told  about  unholy  Imams,  some  who  are 
greedy, some who are proud, some who are lustful.

one of them could serve to continue the discussion of this 
topic. I left them out because it is not my goal to offend 
anyone and I respect the people who genuinely believe and 
try to follow their beliefs.
I included this joke about the cat who went on the 
hajj to highlight the power of community to lead, direct, 
and even control the actions and words of followers. The

community is more important here than the individual, and 
the respect of the community is more important than the 
truth.
Acceptance by others is vital to life, not just here in 
Morocco, but everywhere. We all need friends, family, 
and a place to belong. We are all willing, at times, to 
compromise  ourselves  in  one  way  or  another  in  our 
attempt to do that.
Some people will compromise their personal wants 
and desires to try to conform to community standards in a 
feeble attempt to hold on to position or respect. Others 
will sacrifice their public image for the sake of belonging 
to a community that, while at times small or hidden, more 
accurately reflects their beliefs and standards. In either 
case,  a  person's  true  self  will  eventually  be  seen  and 
known through his actions.

One day while traveling, Juha arrived at a village he had  
never been to before. He left his donkey in the street and  
went into a shop. When he came back his donkey was  
missing. Juha stood in the middle of the street and yelled,  
“If my donkey isn't here when I get back I'll do here what 
I did in the other village!” Then he entered a cafe. An 
hour later he returned and his donkey was there. He got  
on  and  rode  out  of  town.  The  townspeople  were 
wondering what Juha had done in the other town so they 

89
sent a boy to ask him. Juha replied, “I left.”
Fear of the unknown is a powerful force. It can 
paralyze  and  it  can  motivate.  Juha  uses  that  to  his 
advantage here. Someone has stolen his donkey, he doesn't 
know who and he really has no recourse. It isn't likely that 
the members of a small village would turn over one of 
their  own,  even  if  they  all want  him  to  be  punished. 
Admitting to an outsider that there is a thief among them 
would bring shame on the entire village. What can Juha 
do?
Notice that he doesn't threaten anyone directly. He 
doesn't ask them to turn over the thief to be brought to 
justice. He doesn't initiate a direct confrontation with the 
entire community that he would be sure to lose. Instead, he 
appeals to their fear of the unknown.
“I'll do here what I did in the other village!” Which 
village? Where? No one knows. Juha has never been to 
this village, no one knows him. He could be a powerful 
magician, a sorcerer. He might put a curse on the village, 
its crops, its flocks, its people. He might be a great friend 
of the jinns, like Sulayman is said to have been. Maybe 

90  -   Humor and Moroccan Culture
Juha would call on their assistance to come and punish the 
townspeople.  There's  no  way  of  knowing  what  he  is 
capable of and the villagers decide they can't take the risk.
Because Juha gave them a way to make restoration 
without losing face, it was easy for them to recover his 
donkey and get it back in its place before Juha returned. 
When Juha saw his donkey, he most likely decided this 
village was not a place where he really wanted to be, so he 
leaves.
The townspeople were left wondering what sort of 
power Juha might have. What could he have done if they 
had had not appeased him? Nothing, it turned out.
There are many layers to this story. The first is 
superstition,  which  is  most  prevalent  among  the 
uneducated. As  discussed  in  a previous  chapter,  when 
things  are  not  understood  through  education  or  direct 
experience,  humans  attempt  to  comprehend  their 
environment  using  the  most  reasonable  explanation 
available.
There is also a subtle and minor religious element to 
this  story.  Remember,  you  cannot  divorce  Islam  from 
Moroccan culture, as it has had a great impact on every 

91
area of thought and action. Islam teaches the reality of the 
supernatural realm and the existence of angels, devils and 
jinn. While the most conservative forms of Islamic thought 
and teaching  may forbid  and even deny the power  of 
sorcery, the more popular folk beliefs confirm and in some 
cases even encourage it.
Juha is neither a saint nor a villain. Typically, he 
fills the role of the fool in the king's court. As I mentioned 
before, he is someone who speaks the truth when others 
cannot,  for  better  and  for  worse.  Sometimes  what  he 
reveals is beautiful and desirable, and other times it is 
painful and difficult.
Traditionally, a traveler in Morocco is treated with 
great respect and kindness. Upon arriving in a new town, I 
have often been invited to people's homes, treated to a 
wonderful hot meal, and even invited to stay the night in 
their spare bedroom. There is a proverb here that says a 
person should be willing to starve so that their guest may 
feast. I have seen this proverb lived out several times.
In this instance, the subtext of what Juha is saying is 
that he realizes he has no real power to make a community 
which he is not a part of conform to its stated values (i.e. 

92  -   Humor and Moroccan Culture
stealing is wrong, the traveler should be given hospitality). 
What can he do? If he tries to confront them he will likely 
end up in a worse condition than he already is. Instead, he 
reveals to them their sin and their slavery to the fear of the 
unknown.
“If my donkey is not returned...” says, “There is a 
thief among you. I don't know who he is and I don't care. I 
want my donkey back.” Following it with, “I'll do here 
what I did in the other village,” immediately strikes fear in 
the hearts of the people. 
It is the last line of the joke, however, that is the 
most telling. Juha could have said anything in response to 
the question of what he did. He could have made up a 
grandiose story of magic and power. He could have simply 
refused to answer and kept the village in fear in case he 
wanted to return someday. He did neither. 
Juha intentionally sacrificed his position of power 
over the village and told them the truth. What makes the 
joke both funny and painful is that the truth produces more 
shame for the villagers than any of the other options. The 
villagers believed he was greater than them. They feared 
he might have supernatural powers. Juha never directly 

93
claimed any of  these things  for  himself. The villagers 
deceived themselves.
As a result of their ignorance and superstition, the 
village had bound itself to a fear of sorcerous punishment. 
This  fear  was  appropriate  in  one  sense  because  the 
villagers all knew that someone among them had acted 
dishonorably. As a result, the community deserved to be 
punished. This fed into the religious foundation of their 
community and the knowledge that those who do such 
things deserve to burn in hell. The terror increased.
I find it interesting that Juha never lets the villagers 
off the hook. He merely points out their fallen condition 
and leaves them to figure out what to do next. I'm not sure 
what else to say about that or what meaning this may have, 
but it is an interesting phenomenon. Perhaps the story was 
originally  intended  as  a morality  tale  or  perhaps  as  a 
discussion starter. It could also be that the original author 
simply thought it was enough to show the bad people 
receiving their due and chose to leave the resolution to the 
imagination of the listener.

There once was a young country girl who went to the  
doctor. The doctor asked her to take off her clothes so he  
could examine her. She replied that this was shameful and 
besides, she was married. She went home and asked her 
husband about it and he told her it is normal to do this at  
the doctor's office. She returned to the doctor, who again 
asked her to remove her clothes. She replied, “Okay, but  
you first.”
Who are you most likely to believe? Who do you 
trust when you hear advice or information? This is an 

95
interesting question in any society. Some will probably 
say, “I trust the experts, the scientists, the researchers, the 
leaders.” Others may answer, “I trust my friends and their 
advice above all.” A Moroccan would likely answer, “My 
family.”
On the surface, this is just a silly joke about a naive 
country girl and her misunderstanding of what goes on in a 
doctor's office. Some might take it for another example of 
the tension between rural and urban cultures. Others may 
say it demonstrates yet again the arrogance of the educated 
over the trust of the simple. I think it is a great opportunity 
to  discuss  which  sources  of  information  are  deemed 
reliable and why.
A common proverb in Morocco says, “Don't ask the 
doctor, ask the one who has had the disease.”

innate mistrust of outsiders in this society. Relationships

attempting to establish trust.
When  I  was  a  child,  there  was  a  well  known 
television  commercial  in  the  United  States  that  stated 
something like,  “Seven  out  of  ten  doctors  recommend 
sugarless gum for their patients who chew gum.” For most 
people  in  Morocco  that  information  would  be 
meaningless.  It  wouldn't  help  them  decide  whether  to 
chew that gum or not. However, if seven out of ten people 
in their neighborhood chewed that brand of gum, they 
would be extremely likely to try it. If seven out of ten 
people in their immediate family chewed that brand of 
gum, the seven who chewed it would wonder what was 
wrong with the other three.
Sometimes,  this  phenomenon  manifests  itself  as 
similar to peer pressure, but I see it as something deeper 
and less sinister. We must remember that both traditional 
Arab and Berber societies have their foundations among 
nomadic desert tribes. Trust of one another within the tribe 
was vital for survival. Outsiders might want to take your 
food, your flocks, or your women. Trust was not easily 
given to outsiders, who might be trying to deceive for 
personal gain, especially if what they said contradicted 

97
what  was  known,  or  presumed  true,  among  tribal 
members.
Even now that most Moroccans live in large cities, 
some of that ethos has survived. If an outsider presents a 
new product or process, or makes claims about an existing 
one, most Moroccans will begin the consideration of the 
product,  process  or  claim  by  asking  their  family  and 
friends for their opinions. Often, this will follow an initial 
rejection of  whatever  has been  presented.  The process 
might look something like this:
Rachid: “Sugarless gum? Who ever heard of such a 
silly thing. Get that stuff away from me.” 
Latif: “The dentist says it is better for your teeth. 
Too much sugar is bad for you.” 
Rachid:  “Who  cares  what  the  dentist  says? 
Sugarless gum? That's crazy.”
...minutes later... 
Rachid: “Hey, Hamid! I met this guy selling gum 
that doesn't have sugar in it. Have you ever heard that?”
Hamid: “Yeah. My cousin started chewing it and he 
hasn't had any new problems with his teeth.”
Rachid: “Hmm. Maybe I'll give it a try.”

98  -   Humor and Moroccan Culture
What makes Rachid more willing to try the gum? 
He has heard of the experience of his friend's cousin...it's 
all about relationship. Someone he knew was able to speak 
from  secondhand  experience,  based  on  the  firsthand 
experience  of  someone he knew  well  (even  if  Rachid 
heard about it thirdhand).
What  made  the  young  country  girl  willing  to 
abandon her social more against disrobing in front of a 
man? The word of her husband that this is normal in a 
doctor's office. She didn't even understand why she was 
taking her clothes off, but her husband said it was normal 
and she trusted him.
This  is  a  society  where  new  ideas  are  slow  to 
penetrate and even slower to be accepted. One must be 
patient  when  introducing  something  no  one  has 
experienced locally. It will help if it is something that 
Moroccans  who  have  lived  overseas  have  used  or 
experienced, as long as those Moroccans have retained ties 
and  relationships  within  their  homeland.  Some  good 
examples are Pepsi Cola or maybe the new “Mecca Cola” 
that was introduced in 2004 or 2005, which claimed to 
give a portion of all profits to Islamic charities. Neither of 

99
these has sold well, even though they are cheaper than 
Coca Cola. Why? Because everyone knows Coca Cola. 
Everyone has tried Coke. Their friends and families are 
familiar with it. Why switch to something else that is 
unknown and unfamiliar, especially if it is just about the 
same?
Some Muslims have warned of Christians coming 
into  Morocco  in  an  attempt  to  convert  Muslims  to 
Christianity. At times they have been quite vocal in their 
opposition to the very idea and cried out for public action 
against  such  things.  It  is  already  illegal  to  attempt  to 
persuade someone to change their religion. I'm convinced 
most attempts to do so are unlikely to be fruitful here and 
that there is very little for this vocal minority to worry 
about. Why?
First,  people  accept  responsibility  for  their 
behaviors  and  beliefs  only  if  they  have  chosen  them 
without outside pressures and influences. This means that 
those Moroccans who have freely chosen to follow Islam 
as their faith and the faith of their ancestors and country 
are not going to be easily swayed to follow anything else. 
Those who might feel or experience any outside 

100  -   Humor and Moroccan Culture
pressure or influence from a foreigner to convert are not 
likely to make a true conversion in their heart. Some may 
exhibit an outward conversion in the hope of receiving 
monetary reward or to obtain a job from a foreigner, but 
this doesn't seem likely to happen in my opinion and I 
would imagine it would be short lived if it did happen. 
Second, this is a society where the opinion of the 
community and the family bear more weight and authority 
than the opinion of an outsider. A Moroccan would have 
to be completely disillusioned with or disconnected from 
his family, friends and their faith to willingly leave it. 
Unless entire families or neighborhoods were to choose to 
convert together (through some sort of divine assistance), I 
wouldn't expect more than the occasional societal outsider 
to make a change of this nature any more than he would 
choose to paint his face blue and dance the tango in the 
street.
I have heard some interesting ideas during my years 
in Morocco. Some have told me that I need to keep the 
windows closed at all times while traveling in a motorized 
vehicle, because the draft from an open window will make 
me sick. I was told this in the heat of August. The same 

101
person absolutely forbid the air conditioner to be used 
because it also produced a sickness-inducing draft.
We could have a long discussion on the facts and 
falsehoods surrounding pregnancy. Eat this, avoid that, 
and if you do the following, you will have a boy. The list 
of old wives' tales is long. Some will shyly admit they 
don't actually believe any of them. However, grandma is 
the one who said it, and even if the instructions are wrong 
young people will often follow them so that they don't 
shame her or damage the relationship.
Regardless  of  what  the  belief  is,  once  it  has 
permeated Moroccan society it is difficult to change. That 
can be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on the 
belief, but it is not something that is likely to change. I 
consider Morocco to be like a large ship. It takes a long 
time and gentle adjustments to the rudder to turn. If you 
change things too quickly the ship will tip over and sink.

Epilogue
I have spent the last few weeks thinking about all 
that I have written in the previous chapters and I have 
begun the revision process. While doing so I happened to 
sit down with a Moroccan acquaintance who asked me 
how this book was progressing. During our conversation 
he asked me what sorts of things I had seen that I liked 
about Moroccan culture and what things bothered me.
In  the  chapter,  “Respect  is  more  important  than 
truth,”  I  wrote  about  an  incident  where  a  policeman 
stopped me and asked me for a bribe. I relayed this story 
to  my  acquaintance,  who  had  a  completely  different 
understanding of the matter. It is his perspective that I 
would like to share as a fitting end to this text.
Before I do so, let me tell you a little bit about the 
man. He is relatively wealthy and owns several businesses. 

103
He speaks multiple languages and when he was younger 
he had the opportunity to live in Europe for a time. He has 
also traveled to the United States. This is a person whom I 
would classify as upper middle class.
I described to him the first half of my story, that I 
had been stopped, that my papers had been examined and 
returned to me. I mentioned that the policeman had told 
me what the fine would be according to the law, if he 
decided to write a citation. I relayed how the officer asked 
me if I wanted a ticket, and after my negative response, 
proceeded to ask me what I would give him instead.
At this point the man interrupted me, so I never 
finished the story. I was so intrigued by what he was 
saying  that  I  spent  the  next  half  an  hour  asking  him 
multiple follow up questions. I wanted to be certain I 
understood him correctly.
“Wait! You can't be upset about that. The officer 
was being kind to you,” he interrupted. “He could have 
charged you 400 Dirhams and instead was being merciful 
by giving you the option to pay less, as a reminder to obey 
the  law,  without  you  being  forced  to  bear  its  fullest 
punishment.”

104  -   Humor and Moroccan Culture
Intrigued I responded, “So it was okay that he asked 
me for a bribe? That's illegal, isn't it?”
“The law exists as a set of guidelines so we know 
what is right and what is wrong. No one is perfect, we 
can't be expected to do everything correctly all of the time. 
This man was being kind to you by not making you pay 
the  full  penalty  because  he  realizes  that  we  are  all 
imperfect.”
“But isn't bribery wrong?” I prodded.
“Look, he asked you to pay him. He will have to 
pay half of that money to his boss who will then have to 
pay half of all that he receives to his boss and so on, all the 
way to the top. You can't change the system. It is what it 
is.”
I  was  taken  aback.  I have no idea  whether  this 
accusation is true or false, but the person making it was 
absolutely convinced. I decided I needed to press further.
I continued, “I don't know whether that is true or 
false and I'm not sure I want to know. I haven't had this 
experience before. I am curious, though, do you think 
bribery is right or wrong?”

105
Indignantly  he  replied,  “It  happens  all  over  the 
world. Do you think police and government officials in 
America don't ask for and accept bribes? Europe? Are you 
saying your country is better than mine?”
“That has nothing to do with my question. Whether 
this happens other places or not I want to know what you 
think. Is bribery a sin?” I asked, deliberately changing the 
word I used in the question to push the point further. My 
answer came by way of a story.
“Suppose  the  policeman  stopped  a  hardworking 
handyman, someone who was honest and did his job well 
but didn't have a lot of money. Let's say the man was 
riding his motor
1 down the street and he ran a red light. 
The policeman would have to stop him if he saw it happen 
because it is his job to keep people safe. 
“He would instruct the man to always stop when the 
light is red, otherwise he could get hit by a car and injured 
or even die. The policeman would know that the laborer 
wasn't a rich man and couldn't actually afford to pay a 400

small, underpowered motorcycle with pedals you crank to start 
the motor.

106  -   Humor and Moroccan Culture
Dirham fine, but to make sure the man remembers in the 
future, the policeman would penalize him  in some way. 
So he would ask him for an amount of money adequate to 
make the handyman think before breaking the law again in 
the future. For some, that might be only 20 Dirhams, for 
others 100 Dirhams. The amount of the fine would vary 
according to the ability of the person to pay. They might 
even bargain a bit.”
“Are you serious?” I interjected with fascination.
“Yes,” my  acquaintance continued.  “Look  at the 
income tax in your country. Does everyone pay the same 
amount? Does everyone pay even the same percentage? 
There are even some who don't have to pay taxes at all. 
Why? It's mercy. Those who have more pay a little extra 
to help cover for those who don't have as much.”
I began to say, “But the income tax is not illegal. 
Bribery is.” However, my friend's cell phone rang and he 
had to leave. The conversation ended there. We smiled at 
each  other,  shook  hands,  kissed  cheeks  and  went  our 
separate ways, he to a meeting and me to my office filled 
with wonder and doubt as to whether anything I have 
understood or written thus far is accurate.

I am choosing to end this book with a realization. I 
began  the  book  stating  that  I  am  not  an  expert  on 
Moroccan culture, but merely a continuing student. I end it 
now with the revelation that the more I learn, the more I 
realize I have left before me to explore. I most certainly 
remain a student.

Final notes and thoughts
You may have noticed the license under which I 
have  released  this  work.  Let  me  take  a  moment  and 
explain why I have done this, rather than reserve all of the 
rights for myself. This work is definitely copyrighted, you 
can see that on one of the first pages. I am the copyright 
holder. I have created this work for several purposes, one 
of which is that I hope to make some money from it. 
However, this is not the only reason for publishing this 
book. My greatest hope is that other people will find the 
information contained within it useful. I have given you, 
the  reader,  permission  to  copy,  distribute,  display  and 
perform this work, and to make derivative works, as long 
as you follow a few simple rules on which I will now 
comment. 
First, you have to make sure and tell everyone that I 

109
am the author and owner of the copyright. In other words, 
you can copy it for your personal use or even for others to 
benefit from, but you can't claim that you are the author. 
Second, you may not use this work for commercial 
purposes—that's my prerogative and my privilege alone as 
the creator of the work. I'm happy for you to use it as you 
like and even share it, but any money made from this work 
should be made by me. 
Finally, if you alter, transform or build upon this 
work for any purpose other than personal use (that is, if 
you distribute your changes or additions) you must also 
release your work under this same license. You can be 
paid for your work, your additions or changes, but you 
have to let others use them in the same way I have let you 
use this work. Why?
It is my goal that as many people as possible benefit 
from this work. If you want to study it in a group and one 
person  from  the  group  buys  a  copy  and  then  makes 
photocopies for the others in the group, I'm okay with that. 
If you can afford to, I would prefer that you each buy 
copies, but I'm not going to be persnickety about it as long 
as you don't sell the copies. I really hope that you will be 

110  -   Humor and Moroccan Culture
able to make good use of the content that is in this work, 
that you feel free to discuss it, and learn from it. 
I want you to feel free to make a study guide if you 
wish or recordings of the texts, a lexicon of the words or 
whatever else you might think up. However, if you do so, 
then I simply require that you treat me and others as I have 
treated you. I require that you release your work with the 
same availability and limits I have placed on this one so 
that others will benefit from your work just as you have 
benefited from mine. I also ask that you properly cite your 
original source (me). Sound fair? I think so. “Freely you 
received, so freely give.”
Following in the same vein as the work's license, all 
the software and even the fonts used in creating this book 
are freely licensed and can be used and distributed without 
cost.

Selected Bibliography
These are but a small portion of the hundreds of 
books I have read in my continuing attempt to understand 
and improve my writing ability and my comprehension of 
Islamic, and more specifically, Moroccan culture.
1 
There are times when I feel I have understood and 
absorbed the material well, and other times when I have 
merely  comprehended  enough  to  spark  further  study. 
There are also times I have completely ignored or failed to 
heed the advice and instruction given in some of these 
texts, especially in the writing and style guides. I freely 
confess this is my fault and not that of the authors or 
publishers of those tomes. I hope you find this list useful. 
1 As an aside, I'm still looking for a good collection of Moroccan 
jokes. Maybe that needs to be my next project.
