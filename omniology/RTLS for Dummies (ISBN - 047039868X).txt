Dedication
To the three great women and a little man who defi ne me every day — my 
mother Prabha, my wife Ritu, my daughter Shanaya, and my little son Aarush.
And, to my father, whom I could not get to tell all the things I had to say. He 
passed away too soon.
Acknowledgments
Let me take this opportunity to thank my family, friends, agent, and people 
at Wiley Publishing, Inc., whose support, dedication, and talent combined to 
make this book happen.
I want to thank my agent Matt Wagner, the best possible agent an aspiring 
book writer can have. He not only works hard to make things happen for you, 
but is also kind, encouraging, and very trustworthy. His sincere advice and 
efforts helped in getting this book underway.
At Wiley Publishing, I want to thank Katie Feltman and Jean Nelson for their 
encouragement and their ongoing support every step of the way. They made 
sure that the project stayed on course and made it into production so that all 
the talented folks on the Composition Services team could create this great 
fi nal product. I also want to thank Colleen Totz Diamond, Kathy Simpson, and 
Jennifer Riggs for their manuscript reviews and updates and their invaluable 
input and suggestions on how best to present the content.
This book would not have been possible without the constant support from 
my wife, who constantly took over my responsibilities at home. She ensured 
that I had time available for this book. And my kids, who at the young ages of 
four and two somehow understood that “Daddy is busy.” I also want to thank 
my brother Dr. Sanjay Malik, sister Alka Chawla, and friends Alan O’Brien, 
Mahender Vangati, Sarosh Vesuna, and Sameer Kanagala, who encouraged 
me all the time.
And, this acknowledgement section would be incomplete if I didn’t men-
tion Anthony Bartolo, Sujai Hajela, and Ray Martino, who introduced me to 
the world of RTLS; Glenn Jonas, CEO RF Technologies, Inc., who gave me 
the opportunity to try more in RTLS; and Terje “Terry” Aasen, Skip Speaks, 
Matt Perkins, Jarie Bolander, and Reik Read for providing me their views and 
inputs on different RTLS technologies. I sincerely thank them.

Introduction
R
TLS (Real Time Location System), as the name implies, is all about 
location. You could buy this book because it was either present in a 
desired location or someone could locate it for you. Whether represented as 
a map, encoded as a ZIP code, labeled as a store aisle, or as any of the many 
other ways to represent location, people make fundamental decisions based 
on location. Location is a foundational information ingredient. If you need 
something, you need to know its location. If you want to show something, 
you need to put it in the right location. The ability to control or coordinate 
actions based on the location of things or people is fundamental. A business 
can set processes in place to ensure that specific assets are present in a 
specific location to increase sales. A professor can quickly account for 
a student’s location at a time of distress. A business can ensure that workers 
can find shared equipment to prevent time wasted in searching for it. 
A paramedic can reach the trapped miner by taking the shortest route. A 
nurse can find the defibrillator in the shortest time. Businesses, schools, 
government, people, and so on can use location information in many ways to 
improve security, safety, service, Return on Investment (ROI), and in general, 
efficiency.
Today, with the increase in technological sophistication, it’s now feasible 
to locate anything or anyone in real time anywhere. The system that 
accomplishes this is the Real Time Location System (RTLS), and this is 
usually achieved by making use of small electronic devices (or tags) attached 
to people or things at any time. You may have bought this book because 
there’s something about an RTLS that you want to know more about, or 
maybe you bought this book only because it was in a really right location. 
Whatever the reason, I hope to give you the theories you need to know with 
the practical experience and advice you need to get an RTLS working for you.
About This Book
This book gives you the whole RTLS story, from soup to nuts, in the easy to 
understand For Dummies format. I begin with a tour of the RTLS applications 
and then serve you the details of what goes into an RTLS and what the 
various RTLS technologies are. Then, I plunge into the practical things that 
you need to consider before installing an RTLS and the common pitfalls 
that you need to be aware of. I include a chapter on evaluating an RTLS 
solution or selecting an RTLS vendor. And because RTLS security is equally 
as important as its accuracy, I also include a chapter on possible RTLS hacks 
and attacks.

RTLS For Dummies 
After reading this book, you’ll know what an RTLS is, how an RTLS is 
achieved, how to choose the right RTLS technology, and how you can make 
an RTLS work for you.
Like other For Dummies books, this one’s been designed to let you skip 
around as much as possible. If you don’t want to read this book cover to 
cover, you don’t have to. Your current knowledge or experience of an RTLS 
makes some topics more relevant than others. If you want to zero-in on a 
particular topic, you can use the Table of Contents and index to focus on 
that coverage. As much as possible, I made it unnecessary for you to have 
to remember anything covered in another section of the book. From time to 
time, however, you’ll come across a cross-reference to another section or 
chapter in this book. For the most part, such cross-references are meant to 
help you get more complete information on the subject, should you have 
the time and interest. If you have neither, no problem; just ignore the 
cross-reference as if it never existed.
Conventions Used in This Book
Some books have a dozen dizzying conventions that you need to know before 
you can even start. Not this one.
All you need to know is that new terms are given in italics.
When I discuss formulas (yes, I admit: I give a few formulas in the book), 
they’re indented from regular paragraphs like so:
E = mc2
Foolish Assumptions
Well, technically speaking, this book is For Dummies. However, you and I both 
know what that means. For Dummies is a style for reference books that intro-
duces a technology, a concept, or a product in an easy to understand way.
This book is for anyone who wants to find out more about the RTLS and 
make use of real-time information to improve productivity, find and address 
deficiencies in processes, enhance customer support, or increase safety or 
security. Whether you’re brand new to an RTLS or you’re looking to expand

 Introduction
your current RTLS deployment, this book is for you. This book is for network 
administrators who are responsible for selecting, deploying, or maintaining 
the RTLS. This book is for the business solutions vendors as well as RTLS 
applications developers who are developing the RTLS applications and want 
to understand the landscape of RTLS technologies. And, this book is also for 
the innovators who want to create new technologies or improvise existing 
technologies to address what isn’t addressed by current technologies.
For this book, I don’t assume that you have in-depth knowledge of Wi-Fi, 
radio frequency identification (RFID), or any specific technology; however, this 
book does have some geek-speak from time to time. Like any For Dummies 
book, those sections are clearly marked with the Technical Stuff icon, which 
you can skip.
How This Book Is Organized
RTLS For Dummies is organized into six different parts. The following sections 
describe the various parts in this book.
Part I: Getting Your Bearings in RTLS
As the name implies, this part gets you started on your RTLS tour. Here, you 
get an overview of how an RTLS is used today and what it has to offer. You 
see a good sampling of the RTLS applications in Chapter 1 and get acquainted 
with the RTLS elements in Chapter 2. Chapter 2 also delves into various 
locating methodologies and technologies that can be used to achieve an 
RTLS. Then, you get familiar with all that’s involved to implement the right 
RTLS in Chapter 3.
Part II: Implementing RTLS in Your World
This part is all about the practical advice that will help you make the RTLS 
work for you. You get guidance for planning your application and ideas for 
ways you might use the RTLS in your organization in Chapter 4. Chapters 5 
and 6 deal primarily with preparing for installation and monitoring an RTLS. 
And, I explain the opportunities for integration of an RTLS with other 
business applications in Chapter 7.

RTLS For Dummies 
Part III: Tag-A-Palooza: 
RTLS Technology Tour
In this part, you build the foundation that will help you choose the right 
locating technology. Whether you need to locate precisely, detect presence, 
or locate at any other granularity, Chapters 8–13 give you details on various 
technologies that can be used to make that happen.
Part IV: Monitoring Performance 
and Securing RTLS
In Part IV, I share with you the most important aspect of any system — 
performance monitoring and securing. Chapter 14 provides you with details 
and how to monitor performance of your RTLS as well as a few metrics that 
can be used to measure and present the performance of your RTLS system. 
Chapter 15 armors you with the knowledge of hacks and attacks on an RTLS 
so that you can establish appropriate defense mechanisms to protect the 
system’s privacy and performance. Countermeasures are also discussed in 
Chapter 15.
Part V: The Part of Tens
No For Dummies book is complete without a Part of Tens. In this part, you 
find three chapters. In Chapter 16, I share with you my list of the ten most 
common pitfalls that you might run into — and what to do about them. 
Chapter 17 provides you ten tips for evaluating RTLS vendors. And because 
many tags require batteries, I provide ten tips on making the best use of 
batteries (proper charging, storage, and so on) in Chapter 18.
Part VI: Appendixes
When it comes to an RTLS, a single resource is never enough. Appendix A 
lists essential resources for staying up to speed on all things RTLS. Knowing 
where to find these resources will let you be effective in your RTLS choices. 
Appendix A also lists essential RTLS references.

 Introduction
Because when an RTLS is applied to people, it can be viewed as a potential 
threat to privacy, I’ve devoted Appendix B to privacy issues. And because 
it’s critical to build a compelling business case to justify investments in an 
RTLS, I show you how to create fact-based benefits realization reports in 
Appendix C.
Icons Used in This Book
The following icons are strategically placed in the margins to point out stuff 
you may or may not want to read.
 
This Tip icon points out a handy shortcut or other valuable hints related to 
the topic at hand.
 
This icon marks something to remember — information that’s especially 
important to know. To siphon off the most important information in each 
chapter, just skim through these icons.
 
This icon alerts you to nerdy discussions that you may well want to skip (or 
read when no one else is around).
 
Although the Warning icon appears rarely, when you need to be wary of a 
problem or common pitfall, this icon lets you know.
Where to Go from Here
All right, you’re all set and ready to jump in. You can jump in anywhere you 
like — the book was written to allow you to just do that. But, if you want to 
get the full story from the beginning, jump into Chapter 1 first — that’s where 
all the action starts. (If you’re familiar with what RTLS is all about and are 
already in the process of evaluating various technologies, you might want to 
flip to Chapter 8.)

W
ith all the buzz in recent years around RFID and 
then the success of GPS, the concept that you can 
locate anything or anybody automatically in real time is 
catching everyone’s attention. In Chapter 1, I give you 
some examples of where an RTLS is, or could be, used. An 
RTLS can be the solution for applications in which items 
or personnel need to be located within a given area — 
whether they’re moving or stationary. The examples I give 
get you thinking. The rest is up to you.
To get a good understanding of any RTLS, you have to 
know what it’s made of. That’s where Chapter 2 comes in, 
with the components, technologies, and methodologies of 
an RTLS. And because no single technology has been com-
pletely up to the task of providing an RTLS in all environ-
ments under all conditions, Chapter 3 lays down various 
things you might want to weigh before making your 
choice. From this humble beginning, it’s a quick trip to 
total RTLS mastery.

Chapter 1
Getting to Know RTLS
In This Chapter
▶ Figuring out how an RTLS works
▶ Discovering the need for an RTLS
▶ Applying an RTLS to various markets
A
 Real Time Location System (RTLS) enables you to find, track, manage, 
analyze, leverage, and otherwise use the information regarding where 
assets or people are located. Imagine being able to track people and assets 
at a local, national, or even global level. Retailers, military, law enforcement, 
emergency first response, healthcare, education, almost every business — 
even home life — can all benefit, or already do, by using RTLS technology. 
This chapter provides you with an overview of the RTLS — what it is and 
how it works — and describes who is using it and why.
Understanding How an RTLS Works
Location depicts or illustrates where something is well, located. With a Real 
Time Location System, or RTLS, you locate and track people and assets by 
associating a tag, a small wireless device, with each person or asset. Assets 
are items like laptops, projectors, equipment, and machinery. For example, 
you may attach a tag to office equipment (an asset) so that you can locate 
it within your office building; or you may carry an ID badge (a tag), and 
someone can locate you within the building.
Here are the parts of an RTLS, as shown in Figure 1-1:
 
✓ Tags: A mobile device that’s enabled with location technology. A tag is 
usually small enough that it can be attached to assets or carried by people.
 
✓ Location sensors: Devices that usually have a known position. You use 
the location sensors to locate the tags that are affixed to the people and 
assets you want to track. For example, in the Global Positioning System 
(GPS), the satellites placed into orbit by the U.S. Department of Defense 
are the location sensors, and the location of tags (GPS receivers, such as 
the ones used in cars) is determined with signals from these satellites.

10
Part I: Getting Your Bearings in RTLS 
 
✓ Location engine: The software that communicates with tags and location
sensors to determine the location of the tags. The location engine 
reports this information to middleware and applications.
 
✓ Middleware: The software that resides among the pure RTLS technology 
components (the tags, the location sensors, and the location engine) 
and the business applications capable of exploiting the value of the 
technology. You can think of middleware as the plumbing. Not only the 
specific RTLS application but also all other business applications used 
by the enterprise can be enriched with real-time location information.
 
✓ Application: The application (also known as application software, end-user 
application, or software application) is the software that interacts with 
the RTLS middleware and does work users are directly interested in. For 
example, an application that’s always checking the location of kids in an 
entertainment park and then providing a Web page for parents to check 
the location of their kids.
The location engine, middleware, and application software may run on the 
same computer or on different ones. These applications also usually have a 
client interface such as a browser or PDA interface.
Chapter 2 covers the parts of an RTLS and how they work in much more 
detail. The following sections provide a more general overview of an RTLS to 
get you started.

 Chapter 1: Getting to Know RTLS
Using tags to locate people and assets
To locate people and assets in real time, an RTLS continually monitors 
the tag locations. Then the RTLS passes the location information to an 
application that makes use of the data. Here are just a few ways you can use 
RTLS tags to locate people and assets:
 
✓ Attach tags to your company laptops so that you can get alerts when the 
laptops leave the building without the authorized owner.
 
✓ Attach tags to your school projectors so that you can track which 
classes have the projector.
 
✓ Build a tag right into the machinery so that you can track its location in 
the factory.
 
✓ Require people to carry tags, such as
 
• Badges
 
• Wristbands
 
• Pendants
 
• Ankle bands
 
• Belt clips
 
✓ Build tags into items that people already carry, such as cell phones.
Adding value with bells and whistles
Besides the technology that enables the location engine to locate the tags, 
tags often have bells and whistles that add tremendous value to the RTLS 
applications. These extra features are described in the following sections.
Push buttons
Tags with push buttons (or call buttons) can be used in multiple ways. One 
of the most common uses is as panic buttons that can be carried by people 
for summoning emergency response. Whenever the person presses the panic 
button, the location engine provides the alert and the location of the person 
pressing the button. Another use of push buttons in tags is when connected 
to assets, people can use the button to indicate status, such as Asset in Use, 
Work Order Completed, or Asset in Need of Repair.

12
Part I: Getting Your Bearings in RTLS 
Voice to voice
If a tag has voice-to-voice capability, you can use it to communicate with 
the person carrying the tag based on her location. For example, you can 
communicate location-based voice messages to a tourist in a museum, a visitor 
in an entertainment park, or a person trapped in any number of places.
Buzzers, LEDs, LCD screens, and vibrators
You can use buzzers, LEDs, or LCD screens on tags to communicate with the 
person carrying the tag, to identify or locate an asset, and to communicate 
with the person who has the asset or is expected to check the asset. Here’s 
how you can use buzzers, LEDs, or LCD screens on tags:
 
✓ Buzzers can emit sounds, preprogrammed voice messages, ringtones, or 
live messages to give the tag carrier information or alerts.
 
✓ LEDs can provide the tag carrier with messages based on LED colors 
and blink patterns.
 
✓ LCD screens can display text messages for the tag carrier.
Sensors
You can incorporate many sensors in the tags to gain information about the 
environment, the status of the person carrying tag, or the asset that has the 
tag attached to it. Here are some examples of how sensors can help you work 
more effectively:
 
✓ Motion sensors in the tag can indicate whether the person carrying tag 
is moving.
 
✓ A temperature sensor attached to a painting can indicate whether that 
painting is in optimum thermal conditions.
 
✓ A carbon monoxide sensor can indicate whether the person carrying 
the tag is in a safe environment.
Connectors
Tags can also have connectors that connect to various assets to communicate 
specific details about the asset or its operation state. For example, the tag 
can indicate not only where the asset is but also whether the asset is powered 
on. You also can use the tag to turn the asset on or off.
Writeable memory
Tags can have writeable memory that can be used to store some user data 
for that asset, such as the name of the equipment renting company that 
placed the equipment.

13
 Chapter 1: Getting to Know RTLS
Knowing the location models
When you want to know the physical location of an asset or a person, 
depending on your needs, you may want to know the absolute position, 
relative position, or symbolic position:
 
✓ Absolute position is the absolute coordinates, such as latitude, 
longitude,and altitude. For example, the Taj Mahal is situated at 
N27° 10’ 0 N, E78° 2’ 60, and the Washington Monument is at N 48.629283 
and W –121.831533 with peak elevation of 4,455 feet (1,357.88 meters) 
above sea level.
 
✓ Relative position is the distance in three dimensions with reference to 
a fixed point. For example, the security guard is standing at 10 meters 
south of the main entrance of the building.
 
✓ Symbolic position implies presence in a specific area (for example, the 
doctor is in the operation theater room) or presence near something or 
someone (for example, the child is near her mom).
To satisfy the needs of various applications, whether they need precise 
location or room-level location, various RTLS systems report the location of 
tags in one of the following ways (see Figure 1-2):
 
✓ Presence-based locating: In this model, the tag location is returned as to 
whether it’s present in a given area. For example, if your boss is carrying 
a tag, you can know whether he’s in the building.
 
✓ Locating at room level: In this model, the tag location is returned as 
presence in a specific room. For example, if a schoolteacher presses the 
panic button to summon security assistance in the event of a classroom 
emergency, the location engine reports the teacher’s exact classroom to 
the security guard.
 
✓ Locating at sub-room level: In this model, the tag location is returned as 
presence in a specific part of the room. For example, in hospital rooms 
that accommodate multiple patients, such as dual-bed rooms, if a nurse 
is carrying a tag, the location engine can report how much time the 
nurse spent by each patient’s side.
 
✓ Locating at choke points: In this model, as shown in Figure 1-2, the tag 
location is returned by a specific choke point (an entry or exit point, 
such as a door; it’s assumed that people or assets move from one area 
to another through these choke points). By monitoring the time a tag 
was seen at a specific choke point, you can also determine the direction 
the tag is moving. In other words, you can determine whether the tag is 
present inside or outside an area and whether it’s entering or leaving the 
predetermined area. For example, if all visitors to a facility are required 
to carry tags, you can determine on which floor or building the visitors 
are located.

✓ Locating by associating: In this model, tag location is returned as 
proximity with respect to another tag (see Figure 1-2). For example, 
if each patient in a clinic wears a tag and each IVF pump has a tag, 
the location of the IVF pump is returned as present next to a specific 
patient. The billing department can use this data, which indicates how 
long the IVF pump was in use with any patient, to calculate invoice 
amounts. Or maybe you need to know whether the owner of a specific 
laptop is actually next to that laptop. Many securities, financial, or other 
location-based services can benefit by knowing this type of information.

15
 Chapter 1: Getting to Know RTLS
 
✓ Locating precisely: In this model, the tag location is pinpointed precisely. 
You can pinpoint the exact tag location on the map of the world and/or 
in a given building. The location is reported as absolute or relative 
position as described earlier. Locating precisely is the exact form of 
RTLS, and depending upon the accuracy of reporting, the precise 
location information can be extrapolated to room level, sub-room level, 
association level, presence level, and choke point.
Knowing the underlying technologies
Many systems and technologies have been developed over the years by 
researchers and commercial companies to provide the location of people, 
equipment, and other assets. Today, an RTLS can be achieved using light, 
camera vision, infrared, sound, ultrasound, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, radio frequency 
identification (RFID), ZigBee, Ultra Wideband, GPS, Cellular, and many more 
technologies. These technologies are discussed in detail in Part III.
Different technologies use different approaches, and each approach solves 
a slightly different problem or supports different applications. These systems 
vary in many parameters, such as the physical phenomena used for location 
determination, the tag’s form factor and location sensors, power requirements, 
range, indoor versus outdoor applicability, and time and space resolution. 
Some technologies determine location at room level, some can determine 
presence only, and some can determine location precisely. Some technologies 
work well outdoors whereas others are tailor-made for indoors. Some 
work well in an office environment, and others work well in an industrial 
environment. Some need additional location sensors, and some leverage 
existing infrastructures, such as electricity or Wi-Fi in the building.
In some systems, the tag being located actually computes its own position 
(also known as tag self-positioning); in some, the software that locates the tag 
is external to the tag (also known as tag remote-positioning); and in others, 
the tag position is determined by recognizing the location of a nearby tag 
(also known as tag indirect-positioning).
But all RTLS technologies share the common goal of computing the location 
of assets and people as accurately as needed by the application, and they all 
succeed in their own way.

16
Part I: Getting Your Bearings in RTLS 
Recognizing the Need for an RTLS
For the past few decades, the research, development, and standardization 
of radio frequency identification (RFID), Wi-Fi, and many other wireless 
technologies along with the success of GPS as a consumer navigation 
application have contributed to a dramatic increase in the number and type 
of users requiring the needs for location identification.
In addition to the developments in technologies that are making it increasingly 
feasible to identify and locate any thing or individual anywhere in real time, 
it’s the pursuit of what, how many, and where in real time that’s driving the 
need for RTLS. Whether you’re talking about businesses, consumers, or 
public sector markets, the need for an RTLS is arising from the inherent need 
for just-in-time actionable information — the right information at the right 
time and location — which is a fundamental concept to make effective 
decisions and take immediate action:
 
✓ Business markets: The need for an RTLS is being driven by an ever 
more mobile workforce, the need for continuous information about 
worker and visitor safety, the economic pressures for operational 
efficiencies, aspirations to increase profit margins, the need to handle 
recalls effectively, demanding customers, and the desire for enhanced 
customer experience.
 
 Customers are becoming less tolerant in accepting deficient products 
or services due to the wide range of choices available. For example, if a 
company can’t track its shipments in real time, it likely can’t deliver the 
kind of customer service its competitors offer. With an RTLS, customers 
can pick up the phone or check a Web site and find out instantly where 
their goods are at any given moment.
 
✓ Consumer markets: Concern with safety and security, need of location 
knowledge for social networking, aging population, and need for Web 
3.0 are driving the need of an RTLS. People want to know immediately 
where children and seniors are located. Consumers and regulatory 
bodies want the ability to track the food from the moment it’s picked 
in the field to the time it shows up at the grocery store so that they can 
pinpoint the source of accidental or malicious contamination of food 
and issue appropriate recalls. The youth and singles markets want to 
use location knowledge in the social network, and people expect a lot of 
location-based information from their personal navigation systems and 
when they surf the Web.
 
✓ Public sector: The concerns about terrorism and continued breakdowns 
in emergency communications during major disasters have opened the 
doors to RTLS applications as complements, alternatives, or backups to 
existing systems.

17
 Chapter 1: Getting to Know RTLS
 
The applications that are driving the needs for an RTLS vary depending on 
whether you’re talking about business, consumer, or public sector markets, 
the needs of individual segments within those markets, and the particulars of 
the targeted geographic region.
Tagging assets
Tagging is the act of affixing a tag to an asset or person. Tagging assets 
enables you to locate assets on demand, track and protect them, monitor 
their usage, trace them, and manage and plan inventory. Here are some 
examples of what you can accomplish by tagging assets:
 
✓ Locate assets on demand: On large sites, equipment easily goes 
missing. People forget to return it, and a lot of equipment gets moved 
and isn’t returned to its original location. If the equipment is tagged, 
the RTLS can determine the equipment location. Such an application is 
especially useful in environments like hospitals where it’s important to 
locate certain equipment quickly in the event of an emergency. Similarly, 
equipment requiring predictive or preventive maintenance or pieces of 
equipment for which a repair order or a recall has been issued can be 
located easily.
 
✓ Track assets: Sometimes you need to know not only the current location 
of an asset but also where it’s been. This information is useful — or 
even critical — in many applications, for example, in hospitals when the 
staff needs to verify whether an asset has been through a disinfectant 
room after being in a patient room. Tracking can also be combined with 
sensors, such as a temperature sensor connected in the tag. In that 
case, you can’t only determine where the sensor has been, but also see 
whether the asset has maintained or been stored at the right temperatures. 
For example, this can be used to capture information about the conditions 
the food is subjected to on the journey from the field to the grocer.
 
✓ Protect assets: Attaching RTLS tags to assets provides alerts when an 
asset moves closer to the perimeter of the facility or moves out of the 
facility. This kind of application is applicable for almost every business 
or government facility.
 
✓ Monitor usage of assets: Attaching RTLS tags to critical assets provides 
security officers the ability to track their movement and locate them at 
anytime. Tags also enable security to take corrective actions to ensure 
compliance with regulations when an unauthorized attempt to move 
that asset within a facility occurs, or even when the asset is taken from 
the facility. Furthermore, the storage of dangerous goods, such as 
explosives or weapons, can be made more secure. In this case, however, 
these goods can be additionally protected to ensure that only authorized 
personnel can be permitted to be within range of these assets. Alarms or 
other types of signals could be provided when the critical assets move 
without being close to the tags worn by the authorized personnel.

18
Part I: Getting Your Bearings in RTLS 
 
✓ Trace assets: An RTLS can help achieve the level of traceability, as 
needed by consumers, businesses, or policy makers. With an RTLS tag, 
you can record the location of a container or an item along with the 
time when it was seen at that location on the tag itself. This way, when a 
recall is issued for a specific item, it’s easy to track the suspected path.
 
✓ Improve asset utilization: Analysis of equipment locations and length of 
time spent in particular locations can lead to an understanding of how 
often various pieces of equipment are used, where they’re most often 
used, and what they’re used for. The results of these analyses can help 
in deciding how much equipment is required, where to put the equipment 
to enable optimum work usage, and when to schedule equipment 
maintenance.
 
✓ Manage and plan inventory: One way to keep track of inventory is to 
subtract how many items you’ve used from how many you’ve ordered. 
The remaining difference is what you have in inventory. Whether 
because of human error, delay in entering information in inventory 
management systems, scrap, or stolen goods, data from books for 
inventory counting is rarely 100-percent accurate. Many organizations 
prefer to use a physical count of their materials. This is a great way to 
manage inventory if you’re a handmade violin manufacturer and you 
make one violin a week. If, however, you’re an equipment rental 
company dealing with tens of thousands of pieces of equipment and 
have constant turnaround, a physical count might not be so simple. Or, 
imagine if you had over 100 different types of products and maintaining 
optimal inventory levels for different types of products was an essential 
part of your business. Attaching tags to assets can help you in inventory 
reorder calculations, warehouse management, and some degree of 
inbound material planning.
Tagging people
You can benefit from tagging people in many ways. By tagging people, you 
can locate them on demand, protect and guide them, monitor their movement 
or activities, and provide emergency response. Here are some real-world 
examples of what you can accomplish by tagging people:
 
✓ Locate people on demand: In hospitals, tagging babies and children 
enables staff to locate them within the hospital and generate appropriate 
alerts should the child be abducted or otherwise go missing.

19
 Chapter 1: Getting to Know RTLS
 
✓ Protect and track people: One of the highest risks within a senior care 
or assisted-living environment is a resident escape. A resident escape 
can cause harm to the resident and can be an enormous liability for the 
facility. An RTLS can help in resident tracking, and when a protected 
resident attempts to exit a facility, doors can be locked automatically 
and appropriate alerts can be triggered.
 
✓ Monitor people’s movements: Many unique challenges can be solved by 
monitoring people’s movements. For example, by monitoring security 
guards, an RTLS can help ensure that facility surveillance isn’t hampered 
by a security guard sleeping on duty. Another example is in a mall or a 
city where security forces can be dispatched on detection of an unusual 
event, such as large number of people in smaller areas.
 
✓ Provide emergency response: By making use of push-button tags, the tag 
wearer can summon assistance when faced with an emergency situation. 
This can be used by teachers or students in schools, nurses or patients 
in hospitals, lone workers working in hazardous environments, or police 
officers requesting other police officers in man-down events.
 
✓ Manage evacuations: In events requiring evacuation, such as a fire, 
emergency first response can determine who’s evacuated and who 
hasn’t been evacuated.
 
✓ Police restricted areas: By attaching the tags to criminals, employees, 
or visitors, areas that are restricted can be better policed and access 
can be allowed or disallowed based on privilege levels. Furthermore, at 
any given time, security officers can monitor the whereabouts of 
everybody and take appropriate actions when necessary.
 
✓ Improve workflow: By analyzing trends of the utilization of assets and 
how workers and visitors spend their time, significant improvements in 
work practices and methodologies can be achieved. For example, in an 
emergency department, you can determine the key changes in equipment, 
staff, or processes required to decrease the time from the decision to admit 
a patient to the physical placement of the patient in an inpatient bed.
 
✓ Improve customer service and response times: By analyzing trends 
of time the visitors are forced to spend at specific areas, appropriate 
customer service agents can be added at appropriate locations in the 
facilities. By rearranging the customer service agent count, the facilities 
can ensure that optimum levels of customer service are provided 
throughout the facility.
 
✓ Improve structure of facilities: By analyzing trends of visitor dwell 
times, the facilities can be better structured for maximizing the facility’s 
purpose. For example, in a painting exhibition, if some parts receive 
dwell times significantly more than others, the temporary structures can 
be rearranged to improve the flow of traffic through the exhibition.

Putting an RTLS to Work
Because RTLS technology has the potential to provide radical improvement 
and advancements to efficiency beyond the ordinary scope of improvement, 
many sectors are currently using an RTLS. The following sections describe 
just a handful of these sectors and how they’re using an RTLS.
Healthcare
Hospitals, clinics, nursing homes, and other healthcare providers are looking 
at an RTLS to improve the bottom line and the care delivery potential. An 
RTLS can help
 
✓ Locate healthcare personnel. Quickly locating healthcare personnel is 
critical when a patient or staff member summons assistance during an 
emergency medical situation.
 
✓ Track the movements of patients. Tracking the physical movement of 
patients helps ensure patient safety. This is especially important for the 
safety and security of Alzheimer’s and dementia patients. An RTLS can 
alert staff and give the location of a resident who wanders too far from 
a designated area or tries to leave the premises (known as an elope-
ment) as well as when a patient passes too close to an entrance or an 
exit. Another example is infant abduction prevention in which an RTLS 
enables immediate infant location tracking, mother/baby matching, 
automatic door locking, and so on.
 
✓ Improve throughput management. Tracking patient flows for throughput 
management can potentially address problems, such as extended waiting 
times, overcrowding and boarding in the emergency department (ED) 
and post-anesthesia care units (PACUs), bumped and late surgeries, and 
lack of available routine and intensive care unit (ICU) beds. For example, 
using an RTLS reduces waiting and transfer time for patients because it 
may require less time to find staff or a wheelchair to transport the patient. 
Using an RTLS also enables close synchronization of housekeeping with 
patient discharge, enabling a faster bed turnaround rate.
 
✓ Track equipment. Tracking expensive or shared equipment, such as 
infusion pumps, saves time and helps staff to more easily find equipment 
that’s recalled or due for preventive maintenance. Tracking equipment 
more quickly also improves inventory control, which reduces rental and 
purchasing costs.

21
 Chapter 1: Getting to Know RTLS
 
✓ Improve productivity of nurses and caregivers. Because an RTLS can 
automate many tasks on the basis of location and in real time, it can 
reduce many mundane and repetitive tasks that nurses and caregivers 
encounter on a daily basis. For example, a nurse or a caregiver typically 
has to go into a room to cancel a call or trip a registry light manually — 
which often involves in tripping over extra chairs, patient visitors, and 
other equipment — but an RTLS can perform the same task automatically, 
simply by recognizing the nurse’s presence in the room.
 
✓ Improve patient/family satisfaction. An RTLS can improve a patient’s 
family satisfaction by increasing their awareness of patient location.
 
✓ Improve staff safety. Nurses face acts of violence, threats to safety, 
exposure to abusive language, and aggressive behavior from staff, 
patients, and visitors. An RTLS can become an important part of the 
solution by giving nurses a tool to request emergency assistance during 
a crisis.
 
✓ Track personnel. Tracking personnel alleviates security concerns by 
monitoring unauthorized access in restricted areas.
 
An RTLS is important for healthcare management personnel, other healthcare 
personnel, managed services providers, and those who are looking to solve 
complex issues in their respective healthcare organization.
Manufacturing
Manufacturers are always trying to do more with less. Manufacturers use 
RTLS technology to
 
✓ Find products. Often valuable production time is lost because the pallet 
with the right materials isn’t where it should be and a search must be 
carried out. Armed with an RTLS and status information, manufacturers 
can reduce search time, which improves productivity and material flow 
while ensuring higher asset utilization.
 
✓ Track progress. At any given time, a manufacturing plant can contain 
thousands of products in various states of assembly. An RTLS can 
instantly identify what still needs to be done to each product. Historically, 
an alternative to having an RTLS was to have workers use bar codes or 
paper to track the stage of the product. One major problem with such an 
approach is that many employees forget to scan or enter the data.
 
✓ Trace parts. Using an RTLS enables manufacturers to trace parts, which 
can be used for recalls or investigations.

22
Part I: Getting Your Bearings in RTLS 
 
✓ Track production items. Many manufacturing processes are lengthy and 
have hundreds of steps that take place often in several different factory 
buildings. Being able to track production items accurately across a plant 
and link the location to the manufacturing stage results in fewer errors 
and improved workflow.
 
✓ Find tools. Manufacturers often need to tag shared tools so that they 
find them when needed without slowing production.
 
✓ Locate works in process. A work order is an order received by an 
organization from a customer or a client or is created internally within 
the organization. In a manufacturing environment, a work order is 
converted from a sales order to show that work will begin on the 
manufacturing, building, or engineering of the products requested by 
the customer. Tagging work orders can enable you to locate at what 
stage of manufacturing that specific work order is. A supervisor can 
also use some LEDs or other indicators on tags to communicate urgency 
levels for specific work orders.
 
The interaction between workers, machines, tools, work areas, and the 
products they’re manufacturing has a significant location component. 
Whether in automotive, aerospace, computers, semi-conductor, or discrete 
manufacturing, RTLS technology can deliver improved quality at a reduced 
cost to make the manufacturing operations more competitive. An RTLS 
provides context and location-aware support to workers improving quality 
by reducing errors (and therefore reducing the cost of fixing them) and 
increasing efficiency by reducing process execution times. The devices and 
tools used by the workers can be made to know where they are and in which 
relation they stand to the production materials.
Automotive
The automotive industry has been one of the early adopters of RTLS 
technology. An RTLS helps in material logistics, vehicle management, and 
during manufacturing. Here are just a few tasks the auto industry accomplishes 
by using RTLS technology:
 
✓ Reduce the cost of quality: Auto makers reduce the cost of quality by 
preventing a vehicle with quality problems from being shipped while 
still shipping other vehicles. This can be achieved by using an RTLS to 
track information of finished vehicles from pre-delivery to shipment.
 
✓ Manage supplies: An RTLS locates critical tools and test equipment, and 
uses call buttons for replenishment of supplies.

23
 Chapter 1: Getting to Know RTLS
 
✓ Manage vehicles: An RTLS reduces the average dwell times for finding 
vehicles by improving in-line/off-line vehicle tracking, vehicle (yard) 
management, dealer lots, and resale auction lots.
Aerospace and defense
Significant opportunities exist for an RTLS to help aerospace and defense. By 
using an RTLS, you can
 
✓ Manage supplies. An RTLS locates critical tools and test equipment, and 
uses call buttons for replenishment of supplies.
 
✓ Fleet maintenance management. An RTLS can be used to manage 
check-in and check-out processes.
 
✓ Track maintenance dates. An RTLS is flexible enough to track 
maintenance dates for critical support equipment and trailers across 
thousands of feet of open flight line or even while they move through 
metal cages in a warehouse.
 
✓ Speed throughput. An RTLS can perform spot locating and auditing 
capabilities to speed up throughput at critical transit points.
Research and development
Safeguarding research prototypes or products in early stage of development 
has been always a concern for research and development (R&D) facilities. 
Here are some tasks you can accomplish with RTLS technology in R&D:
 
✓ Monitor and protect prototypes: RTLS can enable the R&D teams to 
effectively monitor, inventory, or locate their prototypes, and have 
processes in place when an unauthorized attempt to move a prototype 
within a facility occurs. Prototypes can also be protected to ensure that 
only authorized personnel can be permitted to be within range of these 
prototypes.
 
✓ Enforce escorting visitors: Use an RTLS to enforce how visitors will be 
escorted. For example, you can specify who will escort visitors or how 
far away from an employee a visitor can be before an alert is triggered.
 
✓ Police restricted areas: By using RTLS tags, R&D facilities can distinguish 
between personnel and visitors and then track and locate them within 
a facility. Through the use of an RTLS, areas that are restricted can be 
better policed.

24
Part I: Getting Your Bearings in RTLS 
Retail
Marketing and customer service are prime concerns for the retail industry. 
RTLS technology helps improve performance in these areas by enabling 
retailers to do the following:
 
✓ Understand consumer behavior: By attaching tags to carts, retailers can 
obtain valuable data about consumer behavior and use this information 
to rearrange retail merchandise.
 
✓ Improve customer service: By having store employees carry tags, 
retailers can have the nearest located customer service agent assist 
customers when they request assistance.
 
✓ Improve sales: By attaching tags to products, retailers can have automated 
shelf management processes set up where the clerks in a store room 
can be notified immediately when the inventory of a specific item on the 
shelf goes below a specific level.
Mining
By using RTLS technology, people in tunnel and mining operations can 
improve safety. For example, they can
 
✓ Track worker location. With an RTLS, tunnel and mining operations 
can track the location of workers and record them in real time so that in 
the event of a disaster, everyone’s most recent locations can be known 
immediately. You get a snapshot of where everybody was immediately 
before the disaster.
 
✓ Enforce worker safety. With an RTLS, you can ensure a full and 
functional set of protective and safety equipment is carried by all 
workers before entering a mine as well as all the time.
 
✓ Assist emergency first responders. The RTLS helps first responders 
to effectively locate the trapped miners and determine routes to the 
nearest safe exits.
An RTLS can also provide financially rewarding asset-tracking possibilities 
where the location of tools and vehicles can be available in real time to 
achieve improved asset utilization.

25
 Chapter 1: Getting to Know RTLS
Visitor information
Visitor identification tags have long been used to provide security for office 
and industrial facilities. Because these tags can’t be located from a distance, 
the effectiveness of these tags is limited by the need to escort the visitor at 
all times, which may not be practical. With an RTLS, you can
 
✓ Track and locate personnel and visitors. By using RTLS tags, security 
officers can identify who’s within each section of a facility and track 
their movements to ensure that compliance with security regulations is 
maintained at all times.
 
✓ Police restricted areas. If visitors and employees wear RTLS tags, areas 
that are restricted can be policed better.
 
✓ Ensure safe evacuations. RTLS technology can also help address 
another challenge for the facilities — the safety and security of all 
visitors during unforeseen evacuations. Rescue personnel usually have 
well-defined systems to account for employees, but the records for 
people visiting the facility are usually too scattered or available only in 
lobby areas that may not be accessible during fires or other emergencies. 
If visitors wear tags, they enable a more targeted search and rescue 
operation in case there are visitors who might not have made it out of 
the building.
Industry conferences, amusement parks, 
and temporary setups
Industry trade shows, amusement parks, and county fairs have thousands 
of pieces of equipment that are set up temporarily, thousands of attendees, 
security staff, cleaning personnel, administrators, and other support staff. 
With an RTLS to help manage busy events, companies can
 
✓ Track and communicate with people attending the event. An RTLS 
enables the companies or other attendees to locate and contact attendees, 
exhibitors, administrators, or other support people while they roam 
throughout the conference facility.
 
✓ Monitor equipment status. With an RTLS, companies can more easily 
take inventory and monitor the location of all temporary equipment.

26
Part I: Getting Your Bearings in RTLS 
 
✓ Improve booth layouts and set exhibit space purchase price. By 
analyzing the trends of visitor dwell times in past shows, the exhibition 
organizations can modify the booth layouts and price exhibit space 
based on the dwell times it can potentially receive.
 
✓ Locate missing persons. Security staff can use an RTLS to help people 
locate their lost group member, such as a child.
Public safety
One of the primary government roles is providing safety and security for 
its citizens, property, critical infrastructure, and natural resources. Natural 
disasters, crimes, emergencies, terrorist attacks, and the threat of terrorist 
attacks require rapid response from public safety agencies, such as firefighters, 
police, and so on. An RTLS enables many applications that help people do 
their jobs better and save their own lives:
 
✓ Determining man down: Should a responder be struck down with an 
injury or unconsciousness (a man-down event), the RTLS can alert the 
main emergency response personnel with an accurate location of that 
person. The alarm can be activated by making use of one or more 
sensors, such as lack of motion, shock, and so on.
 
✓ Locating firefighters: The RTLS can guide searchers to locate firefighters 
in trouble.
Education
Terrorism and violence in schools and universities have added notable 
priority on emergency and first response services in schools. The increased 
popularity of online social networking has created the demand for real-time 
location, as well. With an RTLS, you can
 
✓ Assist first response teams. By using an RTLS, first response teams can 
more easily locate the teacher or student requesting assistance. With an 
RTLS, you also enable the teachers or security to target communication 
with the students or staff located in the distress area.
 
✓ Identify people’s locations. By using an RTLS, participants in a social 
network on campus can find each other’s location. This way, you can 
receive alerts when a friend is within a certain distance or get advice 
from people in the same locale.

W
hen most people consider an RTLS, they immediately think of the 
RTLS tags, which are the most tangible part of an RTLS that most 
people deal with. An RTLS includes a great deal more than tags, however. 
An RTLS also has location sensors, locating technology and methodology, 
location engine software, the middleware, and the application. Each of these 
components must be versatile to fit the requirements of companies with 
different environments, different needs, and different applications. This 
chapter shows how each part of an RTLS works and offers some ideas for 
how you can put an RTLS to work for your business.
Starting with the All-Important Tag
An RTLS tag is a miniature device that’s enabled with location technology. 
You can use tags to locate the assets and the people who carry them. Tags 
must be small enough to be attached to assets or to be carried by people.
When you attach a tag to assets, such as office equipment, you typically glue 
the tag to the asset. Sometimes, people choose to screw or build the tag into 
assets, kind of like laptop computers that have built-in Wi-Fi, as opposed to 
a wireless network card. When you need to track people, you can have them 
carry tags as badges, wristbands, pendants, ankle bands, or belt clips.

28
Part I: Getting Your Bearings in RTLS 
 
The location of assets or people is nothing but the location of these tags. If the 
tag becomes separated from the asset or person, you can’t track the asset or 
person.
Characterizing tags
Based on the tag’s communication method with the other parts of the RTLS 
(including the location sensors and the location engine, which are covered 
later in this chapter), tags are characterized as passive, semipassive, or 
active. The following sections cover each type of tag, and Table 2-1 describes 
the specifications.
Passive tags
Passive tags are typically passive radio frequency identification (RFID) 
tags. A typical passive RFID system includes tags (or transponders) and 
interrogators (or transceivers or readers). The interrogator sends a radio 
signal that’s received by the passive tags present in the RF (radio frequency) 
field of the interrogator. Tags receive the signal via their antennas and then 
respond by transmitting their stored data, as shown in Figure 2-1. Passive 
RFID tags have no battery and obtain the operational power to transmit data 
from the RF field emitted by a corresponding interrogator. This means that 
they can be read only when they are located in the RF field of the interrogator. 
The size and shape of the RF field depends upon the interrogator’s antenna 
and starting transmit power. Typically, the field is about 10 meters. An 
interrogator can be an unattended standalone unit, such as for monitoring a 
door, or integrated with a mobile device, such as a handheld PDA.

 Chapter 2: Knowing the Many Parts of an RTLS
 
The tag circuit is designed in such a way that the tag operational power 
requirements are as low as 200 microwatts so that it can work on the power 
that can be absorbed from the RF field emitted by the interrogator. When a tag 
enters the RF field generated by the interrogator and receives sufficient 
energy, it becomes operational. In the operational state, the tag doesn’t send a 
traditional RF transmission, but instead communicates back to the interrogator 
with a technique known as backscatter. In the backscatter technique, the tag 
reflects the carrier wave and changes the load on its antenna to reflect back 
an altered signal with information corresponding to the data stored on the tag 
such as tag ID. The interrogator’s job then is to detect this change in the 
reflected signal. For these reasons, the passive tags usually have a short 
range, are light, have small form factors, and are inexpensive.
Surveillance in clothing stores and libraries, animal tracking, electronic toll 
collecting, and secure access control are a few examples of applications that 
use passive tags.
Semipassive tags
Semipassive tags (or battery assisted passive tags) are very similar to passive 
tags. They don’t initiate any communication, need to be in the RF field of the 
interrogator to be read, and send data to the interrogator using the same 
backscatter technique as passive tags. However, semipassive tags have a 
small battery. The battery’s main purpose is to either monitor environmental 
conditions or to offer greater range and reliability than passive tags. Note 
that the battery on semipassive tags isn’t used to generate RF energy.
Because these tags contain more hardware than passive tags, they are typically 
more expensive. The semipassive tags can be used wherever passive tags are 
used; however, they’re generally reserved for costly items or wherever 
sensors are also needed.
Active tags
Active tags, unlike passive or semipassive tags, contain an onboard radio 
(transmitter or transceiver) and are typically powered by an internal battery. 
Because they have onboard radio, they usually have a long range and can 
communicate without being prompted. For these reasons, these tags can 
be located in real time, say every second; however, the battery life duration 
depends strictly on the application. For example, if you want to attach tags to 
portable projectors to know their location, you want those tags to transmit 
only once whenever the projector stops moving. This way, you always know 
the projector’s last position. However, if you also wanted to use the tags to 
not only know the location of projectors but also to get an alert if the projector 
leaves the building, you do want this tag to transmit constantly at high rates, 
such as twice a second when moving, so you can know the location in real 
time and take appropriate action immediately. Because many more transmits 
are involved, the tags consume more battery power in the latter application 
than the former.

30
Part I: Getting Your Bearings in RTLS 
Such tags are usually larger and more expensive than passive or semipassive 
tags. Because these tags have batteries, battery life is an important concern. 
Tag batteries are covered later in this chapter, in the section, “Recognizing 
the importance of a tag battery.”

 Chapter 2: Knowing the Many Parts of an RTLS
Considering tag ergonomics
The way that a tag is attached to assets or carried by people is tag ergonomics. 
When a tag is carried by people, good tag ergonomics means that a tag is 
specifically designed to be comfortable and easy to use, physically and 
psychologically. Tags that are attached to assets must be easy to attach. 
When attached to the asset, the tag must not interfere with the use or storage 
of the asset. The tag also must be easy to replace.
Here are two key factors to consider with tag ergonomics:
 
✓ Size and shape: You may not be able to use tags that are the same size 
and shape when you use them for multiple uses. For example, you may 
need a tag that can be attached to thermometers as well as attached to 
large hospital beds. In this case, you need to have tags of different sizes 
and shapes that work with the same RTLS.
 
✓ Mounting options: How a tag is mounted on an asset or the different 
ways that people can carry a particular tag type makes a difference 
in how you can use the tags. For example, a tag that needs a one-inch 
square surface to attach to assets can’t be used on a tubular asset, such 
as a stethoscope; likewise, a tag that needs a zip tie to mount can’t be 
attached to a box-shaped asset that has no holes.
Recognizing the importance 
of a tag battery
Knowing whether the tag uses battery power, the exact use of the battery, 
and the type and life of the battery plays a crucial role in determining the 
cost (and hidden costs) of the tag. A tag battery sometimes also plays a role 
in range and real-time tag locating.
Here are some important points to consider when you choose a tag battery:
 
✓ How the battery is used: If the tag uses a battery, the specific manner 
for which the battery is used determines whether the tag is suitable 
for your application. Usually, if your application needs to locate tags at 
rates better than once every second, the battery life, battery cost, and 
battery replacement process may need to be examined closely, but it 
depends on the technology used for the tags and locating.

32
Part I: Getting Your Bearings in RTLS 
 
✓ Battery type: The question to ask with respect to battery type is 
whether the battery is single use (the tag needs to be replaced when 
the battery is dead), replaceable, or rechargeable. If the battery is 
rechargeable, ask whether you can recharge it without removing it from 
the tag, too. If you don’t have to remove the battery from the tag to 
charge it, maintenance is much easier because you don’t have to open 
or close the tag. However, you may not be able to replace the battery 
quickly to get the tag operational immediately, or some tag circuitry 
may be exposed to the external world.
 
✓ Battery availability: You want to know whether a battery that’s used in 
the tag is easy to find. Sometimes, tags require a specific battery that’s 
available only from a specific vendor. If the battery is easily available, 
you can save a great deal of money in long run.
 
✓ Battery life: Battery life is a concern only for semipassive or active 
tags. In semipassive tags, battery life is a factor of how often the location 
sensors request information from the tag. With active tags, battery life 
is a factor of how often the tag is located. If a tag is communicating (or 
trying to communicate) every second, that tag will have shortened 
battery life compared to the one that communicates twice a day with the 
same battery. A tag should provide a mechanism to query its battery life 
so that maintenance and replacement can be scheduled.
Interpreting tag enclosure ratings
The enclosure ratings identify a tag’s ability to resist external environmental 
conditions. These ratings define the tag’s resistance to everything from 
dripping liquid to getting sprayed with a hose to total submersion, which are 
all defined by these ratings.
A number of standards exist worldwide to define the type and applicability of 
enclosures. In North America, National Electrical Manufacturers Association 
(NEMA; www.nema.org — NEMA Standards Publication 250), Underwriters 
Laboratories Inc. (UL — UL 50 and UL 508), and Canadian Standards 
Association (CSA — Standard C22.2 No. 94) are commonly recognized; and 
worldwide, International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC; www.iec.ch — 
Ingress Protection (IP) Standard 60529) standards are most prevalent.
The various rating systems provide information to help you make a more 
informed tag choice. Although they have similar intentions, a few differences 
exist among them. For example, IEC doesn’t specify degrees of protection 
against risk of explosions or conditions, such as moisture or corrosive 
vapors, but NEMA does. NEMA Type enclosure ratings generally follow the 
same guidelines as the UL Type, but NEMA doesn’t require third-party testing 
and leaves compliance completely up to the manufacturer. UL and CSA both 
require enclosure testing by qualified evaluators. UL and CSA also send site 
inspectors to make sure a manufacturer adheres to prescribed manufacturing 
methods and material specifications.

33
 Chapter 2: Knowing the Many Parts of an RTLS
For example, when choosing a tag to track wheelchairs in a hospital, you may 
want to consider an IEC rating IP54 or higher. An IP54 rating indicates the tag 
is protected against dust (no harmful deposits) and against jets of water from 
all directions (not immersion though).
 
For a detailed explanation of IP ratings and NEMA ratings, go to www.nema.org.
Tag environmental capabilities
Environmental capabilities define ranges of intended “real world” environmental 
conditions, such as temperature and humidity, that tags can withstand:
 
✓ Operating and storage temperature: Operating and storage temperature 
define the temperature range under which the tag is expected to 
operate. For example, if a tag is capable of operating in –40°C to 45°C, 
don’t use it in places where temperatures are expected to be lower 
than –40°C or higher than 45°C.
 
✓ Humidity: Humidity defines the range under which the tag is expected 
to operate. So for a range of 10 percent to 90 percent, don’t use the tag 
when the humidity is expected to sink lower than 10 percent or rise 
higher than 90 percent.
 
✓ Vibration: The source of tag vibration can be ground-borne or airborne. 
Ground-borne vibration refers to the vibration a tag receives when an 
asset or the surface that the asset rests on vibrates. Airborne vibration 
refers to the vibration received by the tag because of air overpressure 
received from the atmosphere in the form of pressure waves.
 
 The ability of a tag to operate normally while experiencing vibration can 
be a significant need for your application. For example, consider the 
RTLS application where a tag is attached to a machine that vibrates so 
that the tag can generate an alert when the vibration reaches a certain 
level to prevent complete machine failure.
 
✓ Shock: Shock tests are used to measure the fragility of products and to 
evaluate how they respond when subjected to a particular shock input. 
Shock test data for tags is key information necessary to ensure that they 
can withstand the intended real-world use.
 
 A tag’s ability to handle shock is highly important for some applications. 
For example, if people are expected to carry tags, tags should be able to 
withstand being dropped repeatedly on the floor from a height of 7 feet.
 
 In addition to being able to withstand shock, tags can be used to detect 
it. Shock detection is also useful in applications, such as shipping, in 
which a timestamp can be recorded when a tagged asset is dropped and 
possibly damaged.

Supporting telemetry
Telemetry is the capability of a tag to sense and monitor the environmental 
conditions surrounding the tag or tagged item. The following list describes 
just a few of the many applications or environment-specific telemetry 
capabilities that enable many more applications with the same tags:
 
✓ Temperature: The ability to sense the temperature of tagged assets is 
critical for applications, such as cold storage. When the temperature 
goes out of range, this allows action to be taken before spoilage occurs.
 
✓ Motion: Tags can be used to detect when an object is moving, dubbed 
motion detection. Some businesses use motion detection to verify 
whether a security guard is awake or a senior is stationary in her home 
for unexpected durations of time.
 
✓ Humidity: Monitoring humidity is important for many applications, 
including proper food storage. Different foods require different conditions. 
Using tags that have humidity sensors along with temperature sensors 
helps ensure optimal temperatures and humidity; or at a minimum, 
using such tags alerts you later if the desired ranges were breached.
 
✓ Chemicals, gases, or radiation: Tags with chemical, gases, or radiation 
sensors enable people working in industrial and potentially hazardous 
environments to take appropriate actions to ensure safety at the plant. 
For example, in refineries, the ability of tags to sense gases such as 
hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and carbon monoxide (CO) is desired.
 
✓ Pesticide detection: Tags with pesticide detection can be used on 
aquatic life, such as sharks, to locate them and detect pesticides and 
other water contaminants.
 
✓ Bio sensors: Tags with bio sensors, such as heart rate, breathing rate, 
skin temperature, and posture inclination reporting can be used to not 
only locate but also to monitor physiological data on the wearer, 
eliminating the need for multiple devices.
Connecting tags to assets
Usually tags are affixed on the assets; however, some tags can be connected 
physically with the asset by using wires or connectors, such as a serial 
cable. This setup works best for applications that require a report of the live 
status, or even just information, of the asset to which the tag is attached. For 
example, when tags are attached to IVF pumps, it may be useful to report the 
medicine administered, the amount of medicine present, and the status of 
administering the medicine. Figure 2-2 shows a tag that’s connected to an IVF 
pump.

This setup also enables applications that require remotely controlling the 
asset. For example, not only can the IVF pump be located, but it also can be 
remotely turned on or off.
Programming tags
To enable different configuration parameters, such as how often a tag should 
transmit and what encryption schemes a tag should use in the transmitted 
data, tags need to be programmed. Usually all tags are programmable in the 
field, but read-only tags are programmed once at the factory or the initial 
setup and can’t be programmed ever again.
Tag programming refers to how the tag can be programmed, what application-
specific data it contains, and how much application-specific data can be 
stored on the tag:
 
✓ Program over the air or with cables: As with any wireless application, 
the capability to write and program the tag over the air, or wirelessly, 
makes the tag easier to use, install, and update rather than accomplishing 
the same tasks when cables have to be connected between the tag and 
the device that’s used to program it.

36
Part I: Getting Your Bearings in RTLS 
 
✓ Application-specific data: Some tags may have additional read-write 
memory that can be used to store application-specific data. Storing data 
on a tag can enable new applications, such as storing people’s names 
that have accessed the tag to determine asset-use history, storing name 
or identification of locations a tag has visited, storing work-in-process 
data for a specific work order, and so on. Another parameter of interest
along with read-write memory is the size of the tag’s memory. The 
memory size indicates the amount of data that can be stored on the tag. 
Based on the application, this can be of huge value. For example, for a 
tag that records temperature every 10 seconds, if the tag memory is just 
enough to store 60 values, the maximum the history tag can provide 
is 10 minutes; however, if the tag has enough memory to store 64,000 
values, the tag history can be as long as one week.
 
✓ Size of the tag ID: The tag ID size is another important consideration. 
The tag ID size limits the number of tags that can coexist in a facility 
or when the tags move from one facility to another facility. In the 
networking world, the tag ID is usually MAC (a 6-byte address of the 
networking chip that’s unique worldwide), but the tag ID can be any 
number.
Increasing tag security
The security of your RTLS tags is important. Some tags can alert you if the 
tag is removed from an asset. Tag security also involves preventing hackers 
from opening the tag and taking data from it that compromises the RTLS or 
the network.
Here are some tag security features that you may want to consider:
 
✓ Tamper detection: The tamper detect feature enables a tag to detect 
its unauthorized removal (or tampering) from a person or an asset. This 
capability is critical for many applications, such as asset theft prevention 
in which the whole purpose of tags is defeated if the tag can be removed 
without alerting, or the detection of the unauthorized tag removal used 
in an electronic house arrest monitoring system.
 
✓ Hack proof: The hack proof feature refers to an unauthorized person, 
even with physical access to the tag, who can’t read any data from the 
tag memory that can compromise the RTLS system or the network. One 
way to think of this is that all keys and important data aren’t stored 
in the nonvolatile memory and/or all stored data is encrypted. For 
example, in a Wi-Fi RTLS, it may be required for all associating tags to 
comply with Payment Card Industry (PCI) standards that support Wi-Fi 
Protected Access (WPA2).

37
 Chapter 2: Knowing the Many Parts of an RTLS
Working on tag serviceability
Tag serviceability means that you can service a tag or do maintenance work. 
More specifically this has two aspects:
 
✓ Software serviceability: You can perform tasks, such as downloading 
engineering-usable data from tags and updating firmware (software 
inside the tag) remotely to address any field bugs; you don’t have to 
move the assets or tags to the vendor site to troubleshoot problems or 
update security patches.
 
✓ Physical serviceability: Implies the ability to clean tags under cleaning 
conditions of the corresponding asset. If tags are attached to hospital 
equipment, for example, they can withstand the cleaning, sterilizing, and 
disinfecting procedures used for the corresponding equipment.
Making Sense of Location Sensors
Location sensors are devices within an RTLS that typically have a known 
position and detect the location of tags. Location sensors locate tags by using 
a physical parameter, or a measurement, that exists between the sensors and 
the tags. The physical parameter can be something as simple as visibility — 
the tag is in the line of sight of the sensor — or it can be more complex, such 
as measuring the time a signal takes to travel from the tag to the sensor.
Depending on the technology, these sensors can be some devices that 
leverage the infrastructure already present in the facility, or they can be a 
brand new infrastructure added to the facility (also called as an overlay). For 
example, in one technology where Wi-Fi is used for the RTLS in an enterprise, 
existing Wi-Fi access points (that are deployed to provide Wi-Fi data network 
in the enterprise) may be used as the location sensors for the RTLS. Or in 
another technology that uses ultrasound for an RTLS in a hospital, microphone 
receivers in existing computers (that are deployed in every room to provide 
patient data access to caregivers) may be used.
The number of location sensors needed in a facility usually depends on the 
technology, the application, and the desired accuracy. For example, if you’re 
implementing an RTLS for a wandering management application (where you 
want to record and monitor whenever a senior leaves the facility), you might 
need location sensors only at all the doors (exits) and implement the RTLS 
only by choke points. In another example, if you are trying to implement an 
RTLS to do an evacuation management application where you just want to 
know if an employee is in the building using a Wi-Fi RTLS and you already 
have Wi-Fi deployed in the building, you may not need any additional sensors.

38
Part I: Getting Your Bearings in RTLS 
Inspecting the Location Engine
The location engine is the software that communicates with tags and/or 
location sensors to determine the location of tags and report it to middleware 
and/or applications. Middleware and applications are covered later in this 
chapter, in the sections, “Understanding Middleware” and “Understanding 
RTLS Applications.”
Location determination basically consists of
 
✓ Ranging techniques to estimate distance between the tag and a set of 
location sensors: Do this by using some physical variable, such as the 
time of flight of the signal from the location sensor to the tag. Various 
techniques are covered in the next section, “Ranging techniques.”
 
✓ Position estimation techniques that derive the position of the tag: This 
includes making use of estimation algorithms (covered in the section, 
“Exploring the position estimation algorithm”), such as triangulation, on 
all the estimated tag distances from the location sensors and the actual 
position of all the location sensors to the estimated tag position.
Ranging techniques
Ranging techniques estimate distance, or range (usually in terms of feet or 
meters), between the tag and the location sensor. Here are just a few of the 
physical variables you can use to determine estimated distance:
 
✓ Proximity: Proximity measures the nearness to a known set of points. 
The exact physical variable used for proximity is different for each 
technology, and the estimated distance depends on the technology. For 
example, in a passive RFID network, the antenna location itself localizes 
the tag within the antenna read range (say 20 feet); in an 802.11 network, 
the tag’s ability to associate can be used for proximity sensing (say 150 
feet in indoor environments); and, for closed-circuit television-based 
systems, the image captured determines proximity.
 
✓ Time of Arrival (TOA): TOA basically makes use of the time it takes for 
a signal to travel from the location sensors to the tag or vice versa. This 
time to travel, also known as propagation delay, can be converted into 
distance between the tag and the location sensor by multiplying it by 
the signal’s propagation speed (the speed at which the signal propagates, 
or disperses, into space). At high frequency, such as 2.4 GHz, the signal 
travels at a speed approaching the speed of light. If the signal takes 0.1 
microseconds to travel from the location sensor to the tag, it indicates a 
distance of 30 meters between the tag and the location sensor.

39
 Chapter 2: Knowing the Many Parts of an RTLS
 
✓ Angle of Arrival (AOA): The angle between the propagation direction of 
signal and some reference direction, which is known as orientation. The 
AOA uses direction-sensitive antennas by the receivers (the location 
sensors) to determine the direction (and the angle) of a signal from the 
tag to the location sensor, and the tag position is estimated by finding 
the intersection of different signal propagation paths. AOA is highly 
range dependent and a small error in the angle measurements will result 
in a large location error if the location sensor is far away from the tag. 
Also, not having a line of sight between the tag and location sensor is a 
significant error source in AOA-based locationing.
 
✓ Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA): The TDOA is very similar to TOA. 
Instead of the exact TOA measurement, which requires high-resolution 
synchronized clocks at the tag and the location sensor, TDOA measures 
the difference in transmission times between signals received from each 
of the transmitters to a tag or vice versa. That TDOA is used to estimate 
distance between the tag and the location sensors. Although the distance 
between the tag and the location sensor doesn’t matter, it is required that 
for TDOA measurements, all location sensors must be exactly time 
synchronized. Otherwise, location ambiguity will be introduced.
 
✓ Time of Flight (TOF): The TOF method uses measured elapsed time 
for a transmission between a tag and a location sensor based on the 
estimated propagation speed of a typical signal. The signals are sent 
with known departure times to tags, so the tag knows the flight time.
 
✓ Round Trip Time (RTT): This method uses the total time for a signal to 
start from the location sensor and the acknowledgement to be received 
back.
 
✓ Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI): This is a measurement of the 
power present in a received radio signal. As a signal leaves its source, 
it attenuates, meaning that the power of the signal drops. The drop is 
logarithmic, and the signal attenuation in open space, as well as through 
different mediums, is well defined. Because the power levels at the start 
of transmission of a signal are known, RSSI can be used to estimate the 
distance the signal has traveled. Using RSSI sounds easy, but RSSI poses 
an interesting challenge because it is affected by obstacles, multipath 
fading (when an RF signal takes different paths when propagating from 
a source, such as from a tag to a location sensor), temperature and 
humidity variations, opening and closing of doors, furniture relocations, 
the presence and mobility of human beings, and so on. What this means 
is that the value of RSSI as seen by the receiver could be much higher or 
lower than the theoretically anticipated value.
 
In general, no single variable can be used to provide accurate ranging 
estimation under all circumstances. Each variable has its own advantages and 
limitations in terms of location accuracy, and many times, a combination of 
some of the preceding variables is used.

40
Part I: Getting Your Bearings in RTLS 
Exploring the position 
estimation algorithm
For given ranging techniques, several algorithms (mathematical formulas) can 
be used to compute the position. Here are just a few of those algorithms:
 
✓ Trilateration: Trilateration is a technique in which you can estimate 
the position of something if you know its distance to three different 
locations.
 
 When you use more than three locations, it’s called as multilateration.
 
 For example, imagine you’re totally lost — for whatever reason, you 
have absolutely no clue where you are. Then someone tells you that 
you’re 45 miles from San Francisco, California. This helps a bit because 
it means you’re somewhere on the perimeter of a circle with a 45-mile 
radius with San Francisco at its center. If you also know that you’re 120 
miles from Sacramento, California, you know that you’re at one of the 
two intersecting points of the two circles — one with the 45-mile 
radius with San Francisco at the center, and the other with the 120-mile 
radius with Sacramento as the center. If you also know that you’re 345 
miles from Los Angeles, you can be in only one place — Santa Clara, 
California, where these three circles intersect. With trilateration, you 
can compute the location precisely. Figure 2-3 shows this example of 
trilateration.
 
✓ Triangulation: Triangulation is a technique in which you can estimate 
the position of something if you know the line angle between that 
something and the three different locations with respect to a common 
reference line, such as a line pointing up.
 
 For example, imagine that you’re sitting on the ground but don’t know 
where — for whatever reason. Someone on the top of a tower, say 
Tower A, says he sees you at a 135-degree angle from a line pointing up. 
This means you can be anywhere on a slope at an angle of 135 degrees 
from that point and that slope can be anywhere around the tower 
(geometrically, a conical shape). Now, someone else says she sees you 
at a 160-degree angle from the peak of another tower, Tower B. You’re 
getting closer because now you can be at only the intersecting points of 
those two conical shapes (the slope intersections from the peaks of the 
two towers). When someone else says you’re 135 degrees from the peak 
of a third tower, Tower C, you can be at only one position, the point 
where the three angular lines intersect. (See Figure 2-4.) One can 
compute exact location when the angles to three positions are given.
 
 People often use the triangulation when they actually mean trilateration. 
Don’t let them confuse you. Ask for clarification.

✓ Scene analysis: Scene analysis examines a view from a particular 
vantage point to draw conclusions about the observer’s location. The 
scene itself can contain visual images, such as frames captured by a 
wearable camera or any other measurable physical phenomena, such 
as electromagnetic characteristics that occur when an object is at a 
particular position and orientation. If you can see the swimming pool 
from the hotel room, for example, you must be in the east wing and on 
the 8th or 9th floor. Compared to the preceding two approaches, scene 
analysis requires much more prior knowledge about the environment.

✓ Nearest neighbor: In this technique, instead of applying a finite algorithm, 
simple neighbor relationships are used to estimate a position. A neighbor 
relationship is based on any of the ranging techniques, such as RSSI (see 
the preceding section, “Ranging techniques”). If the RSSI of a location 
sensor as seen by a tag is greater than –50 dB, you can assume the tag is 
in the neighborhood of that sensor. For example, as shown in Figure 2-5, 
if A can detect that you’re in the neighborhood and B and C can’t detect, 
you’re in the smaller A zone. Or, if A and B can detect your presence but 
C can’t, you must be in the zone between A and B, away from C. With 
strategically placed neighbors (location sensors), tag location can be 
determined. Figure 2-5 illustrates the nearest neighbor technique.

Applying the earlier techniques 
to compute tag locations
The location engine makes use of one or more ranging techniques and 
position-estimating algorithms, as described earlier, to compute the tag 
locations. The following sections examine several examples.

44
Part I: Getting Your Bearings in RTLS 
Using the Angle of Arrival method
Each location sensor computes the Angle of Arrival (AOA) of the signal 
received from the same tag in reference to a fixed direction, say north, and 
forwards the value of this angle to the location engine. The location engine 
uses the position of location sensors along with the value of angles to construct 
the signal path from the tag to each location sensor, and the location of the 
tag is nothing but the intersection of these two signal paths.
 
You can determine position of a tag in a two-dimensional (2D) plane using just 
two location sensors and using three location sensors to compute position in 
a three-dimensional (3D) plane.
Figure 2-6 illustrates this method. In the figure, two location sensors, #1 and 
#2, are used and tag T’s position is being determined.
 
Figure 2-6:

method.

One common approach to obtaining AOA measurements is to use an antenna 
array on each location sensor. The accuracy of this method increases with 
the number of antenna arrays used in each sensor, and it also increases cost. 
In addition to the cost, the resulting angle measurements are rather sensitive. 
A small error in the angle measurements will result in a large location error if 
the location sensor is far away from the tag. The AOA method is best suited 
for direct line-of-sight measurements between tags and location sensors.
 
The AOA method is susceptible to security threats because attackers can 
easily reflect or retransmit from a different location.

45
 Chapter 2: Knowing the Many Parts of an RTLS
Using the Time of Arrival method
Each location sensor notes the time of arrival of signal transmitted by the tag 
(say started at time moment t0) and computes the elapsed time (expressed 
as time of arrival of signal at the location sensor — t0). It then forwards this 
elapsed time to the location engine. The location engine uses the position 
of location sensors along with the elapsed time (which effectively identifies 
the distance between the tag and the location sensor) and determines the 
location of a tag by using trilateration, which is viewed as an intersection of 
circles (in 2D space) or spheres (in 3D space), with location sensors as the 
center and the distance as the radius. See Figure 2-7.
 
You must have at least three location sensors in a two-dimensional (2D) plane 
and at least four location sensors in a three-dimensional (3D) plane.
At high frequency, such as 2.4 GHz, the signal travels at a speed approaching 
the speed of light (signal can travel 30 meters in 100 nanoseconds). And, 
hence, to achieve precision up to the nanosecond scale, high-precision 
clocks in tags and location sensors, as well as an elaborate clock 
synchronization system (so that all location sensors and tags refer to 
identical time moments such as t0) must be used.
More accurate clocks provide better accuracy, but at a higher cost to the 
system. The need to have at least three location sensors in both 2D plane and 
3D space adds to the cost and complexity as well. Figure 2-8 illustrates the 
location of a tag in a 3D plane.

Using the Time Distance of Arrival method
The Time Distance of Arrival method is similar to the TOA method except for 
the fact that the start time of signal from tag (the time moment t0 as used in 
the TOA method) isn’t used. The TDOA method measures the difference in 
transmission times among signals received from each of the tags to the 
location sensors.
Each location sensor notes the time of arrival of signal transmitted by the tag 
and forwards this time to the location engine. The location engine uses the 
position of location sensors along with the received signal’s time difference 
between each of the location sensors. Mathematically, for trilateration 
purposes, tag position computed by AOA is at the intersection of spheres 
with center points of location sensors, and the tag position computed by 
TDOA is the intersection of hyperbolas (hyperboloids in 3D).
 
Like TOA, three or four location sensors are required at known fixed positions 
for TDOA.
 
The problems related to the TDOA method are similar to those of the TOA 
method. The precision of the location engine is correlated to the accuracy of 
the clocks. TDOA requires high-precision clocks in all location sensors, as well 
as an elaborate clock synchronization system. However, unlike TOA, the clock 
of a tag doesn’t need to be synchronized.

47
 Chapter 2: Knowing the Many Parts of an RTLS
Many times, signals don’t reach from the location sensor to the tag (or vice 
versa) in a straight line but rather by bouncing from various surfaces in the 
environment; the time difference, which is already a small number, is affected 
adversely by the longer paths taken by some signals. Inaccuracy in arrival 
time differences results in inaccurate computations based on TDOA. For 
TDOA methods, the direct line of site is preferable, such as in an open space 
or in large open buildings.
Using the Time of Flight method
The Time of Flight (TOF) method is similar to the TOA method in the sense 
that it uses measured elapsed time for a transmission between a tag and a 
location sensor, which the location engine uses to compute location by 
trilateration.
However, unlike TOA, the signal is transmitted from the location sensors to 
the tag and the time of start of the signal is embedded in the signal itself (or 
is well known). Because the time of start of the signal is embedded in the 
signal itself or well known, the system doesn’t require an elaborate clock 
synchronization system. However, because this method is based on a time 
value, the quality of the clock becomes significantly more important than in 
the TOA or TDOA methods. The clock offset and clock drift can significantly 
reduce location accuracy.
 
Like TOA or TDOA, three or four location sensors are required at known fixed 
positions for TOF. Figure 2-9 illustrates the TOF method.

Part I: Getting Your Bearings in RTLS 
And like TDOA, if the signal bounces off various surfaces with no direct 
line of sight for the signal to travel from the location sensor to the tag (or 
vice versa), the flight time can be inaccurate. Small inaccuracies can result 
in large errors in location precision (because the signals travel at a speed 
approaching the speed of light, an error of 0.1 nanoseconds is equal to an 
error of 30 meters).
 
TOF has an advantage over other time-based systems because no elaborate 
clock synchronization hardware or cabling is needed.
Using the Received Signal Strength Indicator method
In this method, the location engine makes use of RSSI of the signal as 
received by a tag from various location sensors, or alternatively, RSSI of the 
signal from a tag as seen by all location sensors, to estimate the position of 
the tag. The tag location is computed by one of the following methods:
 
✓ Nearest neighbor: In this technique, the tag is assumed to be near the 
location sensor that receives the largest RSSI value.
 
✓ Scene analysis: RSSI is used as the physical phenomenon for scene 
analysis. A database of possible RSSI values from various location 
sensors in different parts of the facility is built beforehand. This is 
accomplished by visiting the site with a real tag and doing a walk-
through of the facility (this process is a site survey). And in real time, 
when the tag reports the RSSI values from various location sensors to 
the location engine, the location engine does a best (or closest) match of 
the values with the database and returns the corresponding location.
 
 The biggest disadvantage of this method is that the RF environment is 
usually dynamic and the RF conditions during which the database was 
made may not match the current RF conditions. Not only do you need 
to build this database beforehand, but you also need to update this 
database periodically. However, you might find tools to build and 
update this database automatically.
 
✓ Trilateration: The RSSI of signals, as shown by the receiver (as shown 
by the tag for signals from the location sensor, or as shown by the 
location sensor for signals from the tag) is used to estimate the distance 
between the tag and the location sensor. Consider an example in which 
the tag determines the RSSI of signals as received from the location 
sensor (the mechanics of the model in which the location sensor 
determines the RSSI of signals from the tag are very similar):
 
• Each location sensor transmits signals at a preconfigured power.
 
• The RF signals emitted by a location sensor go through significant 
attenuation, even in free space (such as no obstructions between 
the transmitter and the receiver), before they reach the intended 
recipient. The propagation loss is typically given by the following 
formula:

49
 Chapter 2: Knowing the Many Parts of an RTLS
 
 Path loss in dB = C + 10 × n × log10 (d)
 
 Where n is the path loss exponent, d is the distance between the 
transmitter and the receiver, and C is a constant which accounts 
for systems. The value of n depends upon the building type such 
as vacuum, retail store, grocery store, office with hard partitions, 
office with cubicles, industrial, and so on.
 
• By knowing the propagation loss (such as the starting transmit 
power of the signal and the RSSI as shown by the tag), the distance 
between the tag and the location sensor can be computed. And, 
as described in the section, “Exploring the position estimation 
algorithm,” trilateration (using the distance between the tag and 
each location sensor) can be done to compute the position of tag.
Because RSSI changes exponentially with distance, an RTLS with RSSI usually 
requires a dense deployment of location sensors if high accuracy is desired. 
This may add considerably to the system’s cost. However, the key problem 
related to RSSI-based systems is that in practice, a radio signal may encounter 
many objects in its transmission path and may undergo additional attenuation, 
depending on the absorption characteristics of the objects. There are many 
types of objects, including fixed (such as concrete walls or glass windows), 
mobile (such as carts), and transient objects (such as people) that absorb 
RF energy and cause RF attenuation. An adequate underlying path-loss 
model must be found for such conditions as because of this, actual estimated 
distances are somewhat unreliable.
Using Round Trip Time
Different methods that make use of TOF or TOA need high quality clocks and 
optionally highly synchronized clocks between tags, location sensors, or both.
In Round Trip Time-based methods, a signal is sent from the location sensor 
to the tag, and an acknowledgement is sent by the tag back to the location 
sensor. The location sensor makes use of this Round Trip Time (RTT) of a 
signal to determine the distance between the tag and the location sensor, and 
then the location engine computes the tag location with trilateration (using 
the distance of the tag to three or more location sensors and the location of 
the location sensors).
If the tag can acknowledge the signal back in a highly predictable manner, 
RTT methods can alleviate the need for highly expensive synchronized 
clocks and can be used very effectively to compute position. See Figure 2-10.
Note that the RTT method can be implemented in reverse order in which 
the RTT is computed by the tag by sending a signal to the location sensor 
and then the location sensor sends an acknowledgment back to the tag. 
Optionally, the timestamp measurements of RTT can be taken by both the tag 
and the location sensor to provide two measurements of RTT that can then 
be averaged.

used in an RTLS are detailed later in this book):
 
✓ Bluetooth

 Chapter 2: Knowing the Many Parts of an RTLS
Each of these positioning technologies has a certain level of accuracy and a 
service area where it performs better. Although they’ve been introduced 
individually over time by different organizations, universities, and vendors, 
their value is readily apparent when they’re considered together, as 
complementary innovations.
 
You can’t rely on any one technology to provide accurate location information 
in all environments. Each technology has its pros and cons, as I discuss 
throughout this book.
Understanding Middleware
Middleware is a generic term used to describe software that connects two 
disparate applications, allowing them to communicate with each other and 
to exchange data. In the context of an RTLS, middleware is the software that 
resides among the pure RTLS technology components (tags, sensors, and the 
location engine) and the business applications.
The key objective of middleware is to make the applications independent of 
tag (or RTLS) technology. Middleware functionality includes
 
✓ Tag, location sensor, and location engine management: Middleware 
enables applications to configure, monitor, deploy, and issue commands 
directly to the location sensors and tags through a common interface. 
For example, a command to know if all location sensors in a specific 
physical area are operational or not; a command to start, stop, or restart 
location engine; and so on.
 
✓ Location data management: Middleware does filtering and routing of 
location data to the appropriate destinations (applications).
 
• Filters by removing duplicate events or business rules as desired 
by applications
 
• Consolidates when multiple events are received for the same tag, 
for example
 
• Routes the events to the appropriate application
 
• Stores the events and maintains history
 
✓ Application integration: Middleware provides the messaging, routing, 
and connectivity features required to reliably integrate data into 
different existing applications of the enterprise.
 
✓ Business rules and process management: Optionally, middleware also 
processes and manages business rules that touch many applications. 
For example, a business rule that knows when a tag moves from one 
zone to another can be used by an asset security application, a security 
guard monitoring application, and so on.

52
Part I: Getting Your Bearings in RTLS 
 
✓ Architecture scalability and administration: Middleware also enables 
advanced features, such as dynamically balancing processing loads 
across multiple servers, automatically rerouting data upon server 
failure, and so on to enable an RTLS architecture that’s scalable and an 
enterprise class.
Figure 2-11 shows a typical RTLS middleware architecture.

Understanding RTLS Applications
In an RTLS, an application is the computer software that interacts with the 
RTLS middleware to solve the problems challenging end users, such as 
enabling users to achieve the tasks that they wish to perform or, in some 
cases, solves problems for another application program. For example, in 
an application that enables asset security, the application may constitute 
software that

53
 Chapter 2: Knowing the Many Parts of an RTLS
 
✓ Provides a user interface that allows a user to configure what constitutes 
an alert, such as if an asset leaves the premises without any authorized 
user around, if an asset leaves the premises after 6 p.m., and so on.
 
✓ Raises alerts based on user configuration.
 
✓ Shows current and historical alerts (as well as alert locations).
 
✓ Sends the alerts as e-mails, SMS messages, messages to pagers, or 
pre-recorded voice messages to security.
 
✓ Takes care of appropriate escalations if the alert isn’t cleared in a 
specific period of time.
The application provides the end user value — the real-time actionable 
business intelligence that’s accessible to the relevant systems and people. It 
involves the establishment of alerts, alarms, actions, decisions, audit trails, 
and documentation.

Y
ou may implement an RTLS because you have a problem that you want 
to solve. Perhaps you have some expensive equipment that’s getting 
lost or stolen and you want to know whether that equipment leaves your 
building. Or maybe you need to locate a doctor or nurse to determine how 
much time the attending physician will take to reach a patient.
To find an RTLS that fits your needs, you must compare competing technologies, 
hardware, solutions, and associated vendors. However, the comparison’s 
outcome on its own may not tell the full story because not only are there 
certain ancillary needs that you need to consider but also because you’ll 
learn more about the RTLS and may grow to use it in new ways. For example, 
you may install the RTLS in one facility and later take it to others, or you may 
use the RTLS to track visitors and later use it for employee safety.
This chapter provides an overview of the decision-making process involved 
when choosing an RTLS that fits your needs.
Weighing Your Options
When managers make a business decision, they typically make a decision 
matrix. A decision matrix helps managers structure the criteria under 
consideration. To create a decision matrix, you specify and prioritize your 
needs. Then you evaluate, rate, and compare potential solutions and then 
select the best matching solution.

56
Part I: Getting Your Bearings in RTLS 
To build a decision matrix for RTLS, first identify the building blocks of an 
RTLS application:
 
✓ Basic objectives: This refers to the key objectives of the RTLS application, 
such as accuracy, scope, responsiveness, and life expectancy.
 
✓ Deployment: Installation is a significant consideration when you 
create a decision matrix. You must consider all the things that impede 
or enable the installation of the RTLS application — impact to the 
existing infrastructure, coexistence with existing technologies, 
installation wiring, ease of deployment, and more.
 
✓ Usability: Solutions shouldn’t depend on people to do the right thing. 
People shouldn’t need extensive training courses showing them how to 
use the system. This and many usability issues also often distinguish 
one RTLS from another.
 
✓ Maintenance: Maintenance issues take time and cost money. 
Maintenance includes tasks, such as replacing tags, expanding 
applications to other areas, and upgrading software.
 
✓ Integration: Integration is the ability of an RTLS to exchange information 
with other systems, such as employee time-card management systems, 
product recall management systems, warehouse management systems, 
material management systems, and so on. The ability of your RTLS 
application to use the enterprise data from other applications — and the 
reverse — provides end users with useful data for improved and more 
intelligent decision making. This may be an important criterion for 
distinguishing among different RTLS.
 
✓ Return on Investment: System cost, which includes the cost of installation, 
deployment, infrastructure, and maintenance, is often a crucial parameter 
that distinguishes one RTLS from another. If you’re looking for a locating 
system, it’s important to select a system that best meets the needs and 
generates a compelling Return on Investment (ROI).
 
✓ Value adds: This refers to all the value adds over and above the basic 
application that you may be able to use in the short or long term. For 
example, not only can you locate, but your tags also provide information 
about ambient temperature.
 
✓ Security: Due to the RTLS’s wireless nature, security is a great challenge. 
Malicious hackers don’t have to have physical access to hack or attack 
an RTLS. For this reason, the list of possible threats and countermeasures 
is an important consideration.
 
✓ Performance tracking: This refers to all the indicators that an RTLS has 
to help you measure whether you’re successful, progressing in the right 
direction, and what changes, if any, you should make.

57
 Chapter 3: Choosing the Right RTLS
 
✓ Standards based: Determine whether the system is based on real 
industry standards or whether you could get locked in with silos.
 
✓ Eco-friendliness: A different RTLS adds different levels of hazardous or 
non-hazardous waste (for example, the batteries used by tags). You may 
want to compare the RTLS based on the levels of pollution each adds 
per year.
Knowing Your Objectives
First and foremost, you must know the basic objectives for your RTLS, or the 
goals that you wish to achieve by using it. You must know the problem that 
you’re attempting to solve. The information in the following sections helps 
you define your application as clearly as possible.
Scope of the RTLS application
The scope, or coverage, of an RTLS carries a significant weight regarding 
whether an RTLS is better than another for an application. Are you trying to 
locate indoors or outdoors? Do all areas of the facility need coverage, such 
as can the asset go to every part of the facility or is the asset confined to 
an area? What will be the density of the location sensors that you’ll need to 
locate tags? Each RTLS addresses these questions differently. Some RTLS can 
do room-level accuracy but can’t locate assets that are in hallways or parking 
lots, and others can locate them in hallways and parking lots but can’t give 
room-level accuracy. Some need the deployment of a large number of location 
sensors to cover an area, and others can cover even larger areas with fewer 
location sensors.
Responsiveness
The responsiveness of an RTLS is defined as how quickly the location system 
outputs the location information. And, if the tracked objects, such as people, 
are constantly moving, latency in the estimate translates into a less accurate 
outcome. An RTLS may have the best level of everything, such as accuracy, 
size, and battery life, but if it’s not as responsive as desired by the application, 
it just won’t work for you.

58
Part I: Getting Your Bearings in RTLS 
Timeliness becomes very important, especially with safety-related applications. 
If the system reports a location estimate with a 60-second delay, the object 
or person may have moved to another floor in that time, or the security 
personnel who came to the reported scene may miss the situation completely.
Accuracy
Accuracy measures how close — or far — an estimated position is from the 
true position. You express accuracy with an accuracy level and a precision 
value. For example, you may see accuracy expressed as 15 centimeter accu-
racy over 95 percent of the time. The accuracy level indicates how “far” the 
estimated position is from the real position. The precision indicates how 
often you can expect to capture a measurement at the given accuracy level 
(or better).
The accuracy with which an RTLS locates is often used to determine whether 
the chosen system is appropriate for certain applications. Different RTLS 
locate with different accuracy, and the accuracy is usually expressed as 
described in the following list:
 
✓ Zone level: Location engine reports whether the tag is located in a 
zone. If an RTLS says 95% Zone Level Accuracy, the tag is reported in the 
correct zone 95 percent of the time.
 
✓ Room level: Tag location is reported to be in a room or not. If an RTLS 
says 90% Room Level Accuracy, the tag is reported to be in the correct 
room 90 percent of the time. Usually room size is also specified along 
with this.
 
✓ Sub-room level: Tag location is reported to be in the sub-area of the room 
or not. If an RTLS says 90% Sub-Room Level Accuracy, the tag is reported 
to be in the correct sub-area in the room 90 percent of the time. Usually 
room size and sub-area size are also specified along with this.
 
✓ Association level: Tag location is reported to be next to another tag. If 
an RTLS says 95% Association Level Accuracy, the tag will be reported 
correctly next to another tag 95 percent of the time. Usually a distance 
for association level is also specified along with this.
 
✓ Exit/entry level: Location engine reports tag location as seen at a 
specific entry or exit point. If an RTLS says 95% Exit/Entry Level 
Accuracy, the system might not see entry or exits 5 percent of the time. 
Usually maximum tag speed at which it can travel is also specified 
because the accuracy is usually valid for speeds lower than this number.
 
✓ Distance: Tag location is reported within this distance from the real 
position. If an RTLS says 95% Accuracy of 12 Feet, the tag is reported to 
be within a 12-foot radius of the actual position correctly 95 percent of the 
time.

59
 Chapter 3: Choosing the Right RTLS
Size
Although the accuracy of an RTLS is a foundational property for modeling 
location-based applications, one factor that distinguishes one RTLS from 
another is the size of tags the RTLS require. If the assets you plan to track 
are tiny, you may not be able to use an RTLS that makes use of big RTLS tags 
even if its accuracy fits your application best. And, conversely, if the assets 
you’re planning to track are huge, you may not want to use teeny-weeny tags. 
For example, if you want to attach tags to jewelry, the tags can’t be big; and 
when you’re trying to put tags on shipping containers, you’d rather have a 
tag big enough so that you can find the tag on the container.
 
In some applications, you may want a big, visible tag because just the tag size 
can deter or discourage a thief; examples include infant abduction prevention 
applications and laptop theft prevention applications. In other applications, 
such as shopping cart theft deterrent systems, size isn’t as important because 
theft deterrence is done by making the RTLS tag part of an electronic-mechanical 
system. The system locks one of the wheels, usually one on the front, when 
the cart is rolled out of a designated area.
Life expectancy
How long a tag lasts, how often the tag or its battery has to be replaced, and 
whether the tag gives an indication that its battery life is about to expire (or 
just dies abruptly) is vital information for any application. The tag life is 
usually a technology factor that’s used by the RTLS. An RTLS may have the 
right accuracy and the right tag size, but you may not be able to select that 
RTLS if the tag’s life doesn’t match the application’s demands. For example, 
if you’re tagging something that’s going into a submarine, you want tags that 
last long enough and don’t need constant replacement. On the other hand, if 
you’re using tags as a day badge for visitors, the tag battery life doesn’t have 
to be more than a day.
Tolerance
Tolerance refers to the ability of the RTLS to produce good and consistent 
results. This takes almost the same priority as the accuracy of the RTLS. In 
environments that change a lot, such as the number of people present or 
some temporary obstacles moving on or out, an RTLS with a high tolerance 
for changes in the environment is better than the RTLS that locates erratically 
with the changes.

60
Part I: Getting Your Bearings in RTLS 
Scalability
Scalability refers to the maximum number of tags that can be located by the 
RTLS as well as the number of individual tags that can be located 
simultaneously.
As your facility or operation grows, you’ll need to track more and more 
objects, which puts pressure on the RTLS’s scalability and computing speed. 
The facility’s size may also generate problems if the RTLS hasn’t been 
designed to scale to larger location areas.
 
The ability to balance tags across multiple servers should be a prerequisite 
for growing a system that must track hundreds of thousands of assets.
Assessing Deployment Needs
Deployment, or installation, is a one-time effort. Well, sort of. You install the 
system initially and then reinstall as you expand it. Even so, deployment 
presents a huge consideration. You need to consider the cost, effort, and 
time commitment required to achieve it. The following sections cover some 
other important considerations related to deployment, as well.
 
Anything that’s difficult to install is usually difficult to remove, which means 
you might get stuck with an RTLS technology or a vendor for a long, long time. 
So plan carefully and choose wisely.
Environmental suitability
Some RTLS technologies work better in one environment than another. The 
environmental considerations include the physical layout of the area where 
RTLS is needed, the amount of metal, water, and gases in the environment, 
how frequently an environment changes, existing technologies, and more.
Impact to an existing infrastructure
The impact to an existing infrastructure is often a huge consideration 
because the technology used by an RTLS could interfere with the technologies 
that already exist in your facility. An RTLS that can potentially interfere with 
existing technologies isn’t good for either the RTLS itself or the products that 
are using those technologies.

61
 Chapter 3: Choosing the Right RTLS
Leverage of an existing infrastructure
Many technologies are already deployed in businesses today. If everything 
else is equal, an RTLS that can leverage the existing infrastructure could be of 
enormous value as it can help ease the deployment and maintenance.
Ease of deployment
Each RTLS gets deployed in its own way, and the ease of deployment of 
one RTLS over another with respect to time, effort, and cost can contribute 
significantly toward your selection of a particular RTLS.
The questions to ask regarding the ease of deployment include
 
✓ Can you implement the system with minimal disruption to your 
operations?
 
✓ Does the RTLS require low support and management as well as minimal 
training for staff?
 
✓ Does the solution fit into your way of doing things to facilitate adoption 
by your personnel into their workflow?
 
✓ Is the system mature to the point that the tools are intuitive and easy to 
learn and use?
Installation effort
When considering deployment of location sensors, different RTLS 
technologies have different requirements with respect to
 
✓ Cabling installation needs: Many RTLS technologies require that 
location sensors are hardwired (holes are drilled in walls or ceilings) or 
tiles from dropped ceilings are removed and replaced in order to run 
cable for each location sensor.
 
 Cabling and wiring requirements may not be an important consideration 
when construction is ongoing or when the walls are exposed. However, 
new cabling requirements can have a huge impact when your facility is 
already in place and operational. Think about the following:
 
• Dynamic facility: If your facility has areas that are sometimes 
rearranged for new equipment, moving furniture or aisles, or 
department expansions, the cabling and repositioning of location 
sensors can add substantial effort and cost.

62
Part I: Getting Your Bearings in RTLS 
 
• Mobile equipment: If you have equipment that sometimes goes to 
temporary facilities (such being put in tents during an emergency), 
it may be impractical to do wiring/cabling in those environments, 
which limits your ability to locate in those environments.
 
• Facility-wide coverage needs: To maximize the benefits of RTLS 
deployment, you may want to cover all parts of your facility, 
whether they’re indoors or outdoors. For example, in a hospital, 
without facility-wide coverage (buildings, open spaces, and parking 
garages), you simply can’t enable emergency response for your 
caregiver safety or asset theft detection.
 
 Cabling/wiring needs can affect your ability to evaluate or validate the 
RTLS technology or application effectively. Cabling/wiring can be 
expensive, labor intensive, time-consuming, and disruptive to your 
operations. Cabling/wiring needs aren’t just an installation challenge; 
these can also result in additional maintenance overhead.
 
✓ Sensor orientation: Many RTLS technologies require that the location 
sensors be placed in a specific orientation, at a specific height, or at 
exact laser-verified coordinates in the building.
 
 This can be an important challenge because this necessitates a specialized 
installation crew. The skill sets and competencies needed for installation 
can impact not only the installation itself but can also force you to get 
locked in with a specific vendor or provider for installation.
 
✓ Sensor power needs: Typically RTLS technologies require that location 
sensors be powered electrically. If the RTLS solution you’re deploying 
depends on power outlets, consider the following:
 
• Outlet availability: With electrical outlets already at a premium in 
many facilities, such as hospitals, will you have open outlets at 
your disposal to plug in the sensors? What if you need your RTLS 
solution to work in an area where no physical outlet is present? 
How would you locate equipment or staff outdoors? Your solution 
will be limited to where the outlets are already in place, or you’ll 
have to install new outlets at the desired location.
 
• Outlet accessibility: With existing outlets in high demand, consider 
who has access to the outlets. Is it possible for someone with 
malicious intentions to remove the location sensors? Is it possible 
for the cleaning crew or the maintenance staff to unplug the location 
sensor and use that outlet for their immediate need, such as to use 
a vacuum or power tools? Is it possible for anyone to unplug the 
location sensor by mistake?

63
 Chapter 3: Choosing the Right RTLS
 
• Outlet locations: Usually outlets are installed within a couple feet of 
the floor. With sensors placed near the floor, the RTLS technology 
may not perform optimally. Does the RTLS solution necessitate 
extension cords to bring location sensors to a specific height for 
optimal results?
 
• Wall warts: Wall wart is a slang term for over-sized AC plugs that 
are typically packaged with electrical devices that don’t contain 
their own power supply. There are many problems in using wall 
warts. For instance, wall warts may obscure the other socket in an 
outlet; people tend to remove a plug to put in another; the weight 
of a wall wart may cause it to fall out of the power socket; and a 
typical wall wart usually draws power even when the attached 
device isn’t in use, resulting in power consumption inefficiency.
 
• Dedicated circuit needs: Having significant power outlets consumed 
for a specific application’s location sensors may necessitate the 
need for dedicated circuit breakers, or locating may be unstable if 
the circuits break.
 
• Failure during emergency: Another main challenge with the 
sensor’s need for external power is that your RTLS solution is 
vulnerable at times when disasters happen and the power is down. 
The RTLS may be down at a time when it’s needed most.
 
✓ Sensor calibration: In some RTLS technologies — for example, in an 
Ultra Wideband-based RTLS in which alignment with respect to 
amplitude and phase-in-time domain is required — you may need to do 
location sensor calibrations during installation, and routine calibrations 
may be needed as well.
Deployment tools
Without the tools that provide you complete visibility into the network and 
help you optimize the performance, you may want to understand how the 
vendors and some technologies work based on the knowledge of some specific 
individuals and the number of times you might have to install/reinstall and 
adjust the system. For example, if you’re using a radio frequency (RF) RTLS, 
an RF spectrum analyzer can give you a detailed idea of what frequencies are 
in use and what can be added to the mix.
 
Prior to the actual deployment, the proper type of software tools can tell 
exactly how the system will behave once deployed. Professional deployment 
tools, such as site survey tools with full RTLS deployment support, are 
required to achieve optimal results.

64
Part I: Getting Your Bearings in RTLS 
Estimating Maintenance Requirements
As time passes, you need to address wear and tear (by replacing tags, for 
example). You also need to grow the system to continually adapt to the 
needs of the organization using it. The system must be able to accommodate 
new applications and expand to handle a growing coverage area, including 
additional locations and more tagged objects. Here are just a few maintenance 
requirements to consider:
 
✓ Troubleshooting: Usually incorporating troubleshooting support (to 
identify exceptions or faults and debug or perform root-cause analysis) 
is more of a vendor choice rather than the RTLS technology, but some 
technologies are easier to troubleshoot than others. The better the 
acceptance of underlying RTLS technology, the better the availability of 
troubleshooting tools.
 
✓ Upgrades: Another differentiating factor is the ability to upgrade 
software used in tags, location sensors, the location engine, and so on. 
Again, this is related less to the technology and more to the choices 
made by the vendor.
 
✓ Hardware replacement: Hardware does fail. Because in an RTLS you 
have a large number of tags and location sensors, if any piece fails, you 
need to replace it. The ease of this process needs to be discussed and 
addressed long before the installation occurs.
 
✓ Battery replacement: Most of the time, the battery choice — replaceable, 
rechargeable, or easily available — is a vendor choice rather than the 
RTLS technology, but it can be part of the RTLS and it plays a prominent 
part in maintenance planning.
 
✓ Tag cleaning: Another differentiating factor is the ability to clean tags 
under normal cleaning conditions. Again, this is related less to the 
technology and more to the vendor choices.
 
✓ RTLS expansion: Expansion refers to the ability to add more tags and/or 
expand the RTLS into new areas. Some RTLS are easier to expand than 
others. The ones that are harder to install are often harder to expand.
Knowing Your Integration Needs
A fully interoperable RTLS can seamlessly integrate with other enterprise 
software systems, such as material, patient, warehouse, or other operational 
management systems, which can be enriched with real-time location 
information. Here are just a few questions to consider:

65
 Chapter 3: Choosing the Right RTLS
 
✓ Is there any data that you might have to duplicate in the RTLS from 
other software systems? For example, for an asset-locating application, 
you might have to duplicate information about assets into the RTLS.
 
✓ Does the RTLS offer an easy way to import and export from your 
existing and planned software systems?
 
✓ Does the system offer application-programming interfaces to dynamically 
(such as runtime) interact with your other software systems?
 
✓ Do you know of any other software systems that will benefit with the 
location information?
 
End users can continue using software systems that they’re already familiar 
with if you can integrate location information into those systems.
Measuring Return on Investment
The total cost of the RTLS solution includes software, tags, location sensors, 
servers for the location engine or applications, deployment costs (such as 
cabling and planning), and maintenance costs. The direct costs of hardware, 
software, and installation are easy to measure. However, it’s more difficult to 
measure the hidden costs in maintaining the system. Here’s an outline of all 
costs that must be considered when deploying an RTLS solution:
 
✓ Hardware costs: Hardware costs consist of the RTLS tags as well as 
(optional) location sensors and other corresponding hardware.
 
✓ Software costs: Software costs include the end-user application software, 
middleware, and any licensing costs for software that runs in tags. Many 
vendors base the license cost on the number of tracked items, so the 
cost scales linearly with the actual benefit and the financial return of the 
system to the organization.
 
✓ Installation costs: Location sensors (and tag) installation adds to the 
system cost. If the location sensors installation requires cabling or 
wiring, for example, the installation may interrupt daily routines in the 
positioning area. For example, in a hospital setting, the installation of 
additional equipment and cabling disrupts daily operations and 
sometimes compromises patient safety. In some cases, installing extra 
equipment doesn’t necessarily provide 100-percent read accuracy 
due to the orientation of the tag, the distance between the tag and the 
reader, or the interference, which may prevent positive identification 
of the tag. Furthermore, some industries require regulatory inspections 
and approvals in areas with any type of system installations that involve 
drilling holes, moving ceiling tiles, or installing low- or high-voltage 
cabling.

66
Part I: Getting Your Bearings in RTLS 
 
 If your organization uses location sensors, maintain an additional 
hardware inventory of spare infrastructure as well as mounting brackets, 
cabling, termination panels, and other hardware in the event the system 
layout needs to be altered or any part of the proprietary network fails or 
is rendered inoperable.
 
✓ Maintenance costs: When looking at the cost of operating an RTLS 
solution over several years, the ease of use, reliability, and system 
maintenance become critical. These include planning and labor costs for 
replacing a failed tag or a failed location sensor; updating tags, sensors, 
the location engine, the middleware, or the application software system; 
and additional costs that are added corresponding to the organization 
needs, including additional locations and more tagged objects.
 
 Other maintenance considerations include the system’s ability to 
accommodate a newer RTLS technology that may get invented after 
deployment.
 
 To protect the RTLS investment for years to come, the RTLS must have a 
technology-transparent architecture that can support multiple-positioning 
technologies and the addition of newer technology.
Considering Value Adds
Besides the accuracy, size, battery life, coverage, deployment, environment, 
cost, and serviceability considerations, value adds set one RTLS apart from 
others. The following sections describe a few of these value adds.
Tag value adds
Besides the technology that enables the location engine to locate the tags, 
some RTLS tags can have features, such as a push button, a connector, an 
LED, a buzzer, an LCD screen, a vibrator, and sensors; others quite simply 
do not. These value-add features enable many more RTLS applications in the 
same setup.
If the tags have bi-directional communication in place, tags can be remotely 
activated and configured. The ability to remotely configure a tag or a group 
of tags provides flexibility for RTLS applications so that the system can 
change in response to evolving requirements.
Two-way communication also enables a tag to have audible or visual indicators, 
such as ringtones or LED lights, that can be used to help find an object. One 

67
 Chapter 3: Choosing the Right RTLS
or more push buttons on an RTLS tag can drive workflow applications, such 
as maintenance requests, supervisor requests, and asset status, to name a 
few. Another capability of interest is the ability to send and receive short text 
messages. Text messaging enables a number of interactive RTLS applications, 
such as sending device status (for example, utilized, needs maintenance and 
so on), paging personnel, and sending security or workflow-related alerts 
with codes or other instructions.
Application bells and whistles
Well, I have no clear definition of bells and whistles. Basically, these are the 
non-essential, but often engaging features, that enhance the user interface 
by making it more attractive, convenient, and seamless. Things that you can 
consider are
 
✓ Web-based and mobile (PDA) interfaces for ubiquitous access to the 
RTLS
 
✓ Real-time graphical views of tracked objects on floor maps of the 
location area
 
✓ The ability to search for any tag, location sensor, or any other piece of 
information in your RTLS in a manner similar to an Internet search
 
✓ Automated processes for pushing event alerts and escalations to end 
users
Evaluating Security
I don’t need to describe in great detail the well-known damage and productivity
loss caused by malicious hackers today. And RTLS, due to the wireless 
nature, is susceptible to hacks and attacks. For example, a malicious entity 
may be able to disrupt the location engine’s ability to compute location 
without being in the facility, violate the privacy of legitimate users, or track 
their movements without being in the facility.
You need to understand how easy it is for an attacker, hobbyist, or someone 
unintentionally to challenge your RTLS’s
 
✓ Availability: Loss of RTLS availability implies that the tags are no longer 
locatable or that they’re not locatable with the expected resolution, 
accuracy, or performance.

68
Part I: Getting Your Bearings in RTLS 
 
✓ Integrity: Loss of RTLS integrity implies that either the tags are being 
located incorrectly or the information sent to the tags or received from 
the tags can’t be trusted.
 
✓ Confidentiality: Loss of RTLS confidentiality implies that private 
information has been made available or disclosed to unauthorized 
individuals, entities, or processes.
I included various security threats and countermeasures that you may want 
to consider before selecting the RTLS solution or technology in Chapter 15. I 
also include vulnerabilities of different RTLS technologies in Part IV. It’s very 
important for you to consider all the possible threats and available counter-
measures with each technology and RTLS solution so that you can make the 
right choice.
 
Don’t fool yourself into thinking that only a high-end hacker with 
sophisticated hardware and software can attack. Because of a large number 
of open-source software and cheap hardware, attacks can be launched by 
spending less than $20.
Tracking Performance
Like measuring costs, quality, quantity, cycle time, efficiency, productivity, 
and so on of products, services, and processes in other parts of an organization 
or business, having ways available to measure the RTLS performance is 
crucial.
You need to have mechanisms to not only distinguish one RTLS from another 
but also within the same RTLS so that you know
 
✓ How well you’re doing
 
✓ Whether you’re meeting your goals
 
✓ Whether your users are satisfied
 
✓ Whether your processes are in statistical control
 
✓ Whether and/or where improvements are necessary
 
The ease with which you can monitor one RTLS over another is an important 
contributing factor in deciding which RTLS to use. If you can’t measure, you 
can’t succeed.

69
 Chapter 3: Choosing the Right RTLS
Requiring a Standards-Based Solution
Is the system based on industry standards or proprietary technology? If 
based on proprietary technology, how actively is the vendor working with 
other vendors to standardize it? Will you be locked into a vendor’s proprietary 
system and pricing for the long term? These are important questions to ask.
Standards are drafted by experts in the field through open participation, 
which accounts for their strength. Standards promote common understanding, 
facilitate interoperability, and encourage greater competition. If you use 
standards-based technology, you’ll have lot more negotiating power for price 
and a higher ability to manage risk in the event of vendor failure.
Ensuring Eco-Friendliness
Environmental concepts, such as hazardous waste reduction, product 
recycling, and green supply chains, are increasingly prominent in business. 
Initiatives are being undertaken by people in businesses around the world 
to indicate an awakening of ways to reduce their immense environmental 
footprint. They’re trying to mitigate all that by being eco-friendly — from the 
buildings they construct to the supplies they use.
A different RTLS adds a different level of hazardous or nonhazardous waste. 
You may want to compare RTLS based on the levels of pollution they add per 
year. For example, an RTLS that uses nonhazardous regular alkaline batteries 
has less hazardous waste than the RTLS that uses lithium, mercuric, oxide, 
nickel-cadmium, nickel metal hydride, or silver oxide batteries. Similarly, the 
RTLS that necessitates battery replacement every year produces more waste 
than the RTLS that calls for battery replacement every four years.
Making Your Choice
Because every facility is different and RTLS use will be widespread and long 
term, evaluating RTLS solutions using theoretical-decision matrix models 
may not be enough. I always advise that you do at least one of the following:

70
Part I: Getting Your Bearings in RTLS 
 
✓ Run a proof of concept in your environment. Proof of concept is all 
about running the RTLS in a small subset of the facility to see whether it 
really works for you. This is about making an informed decision without 
getting fully invested in it.
 
 Just running the proof of concept has a financial impact because it 
requires spending time and energy; however, it has the potential to 
demonstrate how systems differ with respect to your key objectives, 
deployment, maintenance, and other issues as described earlier in this 
chapter.
 
✓ Visit existing installations. Because there are a lot of new vendors and 
technologies and because it may not be feasible or practical to run 
proof of concept at your own facility, it may be worthwhile to visit other 
facilities that are running the same technology.

Part II
Implementing RTLS 
in Your World

In this part . . .
T
he real value of an RTLS isn’t the technology, but 
rather the application of the technology in real-world 
practice. This part contains four chapters to help you do 
just that.
In Chapter 4, I stress upon the importance of understand-
ing the real-world usage of your RTLS application and pro-
vide you some questions that you must answer before you 
even look at the alternative solutions or their trade-offs. In 
Chapters 5 and 6, you discover what to do as part of pre-
paring for installation, what you need to do to ensure that 
the contracted level of service is provided to the users of 
the RTLS, and what processes you need in place so that 
you can react to failures after it’s installed. In Chapter 7, I 
present various integration opportunities and what you 
may want to do to integrate an RTLS with your existing 
technology.
Take it from me, after you know how an RTLS will be used, 
installed, managed, and weaved in the fabric of your orga-
nization, you’ll be more comfortable in selecting the right 
technology for an RTLS.

Implementation

W
hatever your goals for implementing an RTLS, whether you have 
immediate short-term goals or motivations for the long term, you’ll 
find that adopting an RTLS is no different from adopting any other new 
technology or process. Visualizing your goals and planning for expansion, 
as discussed in this chapter, are critical steps toward ensuring a successful 
RTLS implementation.
Visualizing the Goals
Before you even look at what you need to succeed, visualize what you want 
to do. Create a mental image of what you want to happen as though it’s 
happened already.
Visualizing helps you create strategies, enhance effectiveness, and achieve 
success. It also helps you overcome obstacles and conquer unexpected hurdles. 
Besides defining the purpose of your RTLS application, such as reducing time 
spent finding assets or improving asset security, visualize the following:

74
Part II: Implementing RTLS in Your World 
 
✓ Who will use the application?
 
✓ How and where will users employ the application?
 
✓ What will make users happy?
 
✓ Where will users go for help when they have problems?
 
✓ What don’t you want your users to face?
 
✓ What are the signs that the application isn’t working well?
I cover all these topics in the following sections.
Although no scientific instruments can measure the power of visualization, 
I have no doubt that the importance of creating and writing down your 
mental images of the RTLS in action is necessary to fully complete the goal 
for your RTLS implementation. For example, if you’re planning to deploy an 
asset-locating application, you can create images of its usage scenarios. For 
instance:
 
✓ The locating application should be available in the handheld devices 
carried by your staff.
 
✓ Only authorized persons can locate, so there must be password 
protection.
 
✓ The locating application should be easy to use with no training needed.
 
✓ The locating application should have at least three buttons: to locate a 
specific asset, locate all assets, and locate asset in-recall.
 
✓ Your staff person should be able to specify range — only assets within a 
specified distance should be reported.
 
✓ The screens should have big fonts and big buttons so that the staff 
person can hold at arm’s-length.
 
✓ When the application reports the asset’s location, it should be reported 
graphically on the floorplan and so on.
A clear mental image allows you to brainstorm the application with actual 
potential users as well as detect new opportunities and avoid dangers.
Identifying your users
When you plan an application, first you must identify the users (or groups of 
users) of that application. Identifying your users allows you to plan access 
to the resources that users need, create the right user interfaces for these 
people, and develop the proper workflow models.

75
 Chapter 4: Planning for a Successful Implementation
To identify your users or user groups, ask the following questions:
 
✓ Can you identify a user or user groups for the specific RTLS application?
 
✓ Do you know when users might access the application?
 
✓ Do you know what other applications these users use or need?
 
✓ Do you know what applications aren’t needed by these users?
 
✓ Do you know which other users or user groups use information from 
these users?
If the answers to all these questions are “yes,” you can begin to plan your 
application, as you know what your target user groups are and what kind of 
applications are required. If the answers to some questions are “sometimes” 
or “maybe,” however, you may find it helpful to use a systematic approach 
to identify your user groups. A systematic approach simply involves writing 
down all the user groups that could possibly use this application and then 
finding out the detailed answers for these questions from a few users in each 
user group.
If you’re planning a staff safety application, for example, the users will be (a) 
the staff members who carry RTLS call-button tags and (b) the security staff 
members who will respond to alerts from users’ tags. Anything that doesn’t 
apply directly to your users isn’t going to be successful.
Addressing how users will 
use the application
The next step in visualization is defining the interface your users will use. By 
interface, I mean how your users will interact with or use the RTLS tags and 
application.
Think about all the users who will use the application and how they’ll use it. 
If you’re considering staff safety, for example, visualize the following 
elements of interface:
 
✓ The form factor of the tags: The shape, color, and size of the tags and 
what the call button looks like.
 
✓ How the tags will be used: Worn as pendants, carried in pockets, 
included in employee badges, and so on.
 
✓ How the button operation will work: What should the sequence of 
operations to raise and/or clear the alert be? Just pressing the button 
may raise an alert, for example, or pressing the button for a few seconds 
may be necessary to raise the alert.

76
Part II: Implementing RTLS in Your World 
 
✓ The security staff user interface: Devices such as personal digital 
assistants (PDAs) or desktop computers, as well as the graphical user 
interface of the application. Security staff members may see the location 
of the alert (the person who pressed the call button to request assistance), 
for example.
 
✓ Tag density: The maximum and average number of RTLS tags that you 
expect to have in an area. In the security example, the RTLS must be 
able to track the location for alerts pressed by the maximum number of 
people at the same time.
 
✓ Tag speed: The rate at which your tags could be moving in the area. 
In the security example, a user could be walking or running when he 
presses the call button; the RTLS must be able to locate the tag (once 
the button has been pressed) when the tag is moving at maximum 
speed.
You also need to visualize any other variables that are specific to your 
application. In staff safety, for example, one such variable is response time: 
the period from the time when a user presses the call button to the time 
when a member of the security staff contacts that user.
Knowing where users will work 
with the application
In a staff safety application, for example, you need to identify the facility (or 
locations within the facility) where users can press the call button, as well as 
the locations that security staff members monitor for alerts.
Asking what makes users happy
What goals must your application meet to satisfy users? One way to get data 
is to meet users in focus groups. Another way is to assume that you’re in the 
shoes of your users and visualize the following aspects of the application:
 
✓ Little or no training required: Users shouldn’t have to be trained 
beyond basic operation. In a security application, users shouldn’t have 
to be taught how to press the call button, and security guards shouldn’t 
have to be taught how to use the screens when the application starts.
 
✓ No location-specific constraints: There should be no constraints with 
respect to where users can or can’t press the call buttons.

77
 Chapter 4: Planning for a Successful Implementation
 
✓ Maintenance: The care and maintenance instructions should be clearly 
specified so that users can understand the impact.
 
✓ Clear indicators: The tags should have clear indicators of when they’re 
working (or not working), as well as clear indicators of when they’re 
activated. For example, a tag might blink with a green LED when activated 
or blink with a red LED when running on low battery.
 
Using the RTLS isn’t the primary job of your users. An RTLS should be as 
nonintrusive and easy to use as possible.
Supporting your help staff
A group of users that is often ignored but that plays a crucial part in the 
success of your application is the help or support staff — the people who are 
contacted whenever anything related to the RTLS, whether it’s a tag or software, 
doesn’t work as users expect. You need to ensure that you identify your 
support staff and represent them in your selection and installation of an RTLS.
Knowing what you don’t want
While you visualize the who, how, what, and where of your application, also 
list the things that you don’t want with the RTLS implementation.
Here are some examples (but as I mention earlier, all requirements are 
specific to your needs):
 
✓ You don’t want to change tag batteries every three months.
 
✓ You don’t want to deal with installing cables or wires through the walls 
or outdoors.
 
✓ You don’t want even a single result for a tag location that’s inaccurate 
by more than 30 feet.
Understanding the Business Constraints
In addition to analyzing your goals and determining your needs for an RTLS, 
you need to analyze any business constraints that may affect your choice 
and operation of an RTLS. The following sections discuss typical business 
constraints that you may encounter when you implement an RTLS.

78
Part II: Implementing RTLS in Your World 
Working within budget and 
staffing constraints
Your RTLS design must fit the budget, which should include allocations for 
hardware (tags, location sensors, and other hardware for running the location 
engine and application software), software, software licenses, maintenance 
and support agreements, testing, training, and staffing needs.
To ensure the success of your project, determine who controls the network 
budget, such as the information technology (IT) department, security 
department, material managers, network managers, or other departments. Also 
determine how much control users and user groups have over expenditures.
Regardless of who controls the budget, one common goal for the RTLS is 
containing costs. You should develop a Return on Investment (ROI) analysis and 
explain how the deployment of an RTLS will pay for itself through reduced 
operational costs, improved employee productivity, improved employee 
retention, or increased revenue potential and market expansion.
Analyzing the abilities of in-house staff members is also a good idea. You 
don’t want to limit your choice of an RTLS to the technologies and protocols 
that your users understand. This analysis will determine your needs for 
additional personnel, consulting, training, or outsourcing needs.
Accommodating the technical landscape
It’d be nice if you could escape discussing technological religion (technology 
preferences), but avoiding this topic can put your RTLS initiative at risk.
You must have discussions about protocols, standards, and vendors. Keep in 
mind the following crucial elements:
 
✓ Any preferences (standardization policies) on transport, routing, 
desktop, or other protocols.
 
✓ Any doctrines regarding open versus proprietary solutions.
 
✓ Any policies on approved vendors or platforms. In many cases, a 
company has already chosen technologies and products for the new 
network, and your design must fit into the plans.
By having brainstorming sessions around these topics, you can build a 
consensus that the RTLS technology in question won’t be disruptive. This is 
almost a mandatory requirement before decision makers make a go or no-go 
decision.

79
 Chapter 4: Planning for a Successful Implementation
 
Be sure that you know what technologies are already deployed or being 
planned for your facility or facilities. You don’t want to pick a technology that 
precludes any other planned application or interrupts any existing application.
Offsetting environmental conditions
You must design your RTLS for the environment in which your RTLS 
technology (tags and location sensors) must operate. Following are some key 
questions to ask:
 
✓ Conditions: What are the humidity, pressure, and temperature conditions 
in which the tags will operate? Does the RTLS technology or tag hardware 
operate at optimum level in those conditions?
 
✓ Environment: Does the environment contain extensive metal, such as 
steel structures? Will the RTLS technology under consideration produce 
high accuracy and consistent results in those environments? Some RTLS 
technologies, such as Wi-Fi, suffer from high signal reflections in such 
environments and location accuracy may suffer.
 
✓ Dust: Is the environment dusty? This dictates the choice of enclosures 
you need for the tags. You’ll need dust-proof packaging for your tags.
 
✓ Dynamic: Is the environment dynamic (changing frequently)? This 
affects your choice of technology because the RTLS technology that 
computes location is based on scene analysis.
 
✓ Cleaning requirements: Do the tags have any specific cleaning require-
ments? For example, solar cell-based tags will need regular cleaning 
because the accumulated dust decreases their ability to gather energy.
 
✓ Cleaning restrictions: Do the tags have any specific cleaning restrictions? 
For example, tags affixed on medical equipment might need to be able to 
withstand regular disinfectant procedures.
 
✓ Deployment challenges: What are the challenges involved in deploying 
location sensors? For example, it may not be practical to deploy cables 
or location sensors in large open areas.
Understanding business processes
An RTLS isn’t just a technology; it’s also a business process. You need to 
have a clear understanding of the existing workflows so that you understand 
where and how your application will make the process better. Supplementing 
current manual processes or automated systems with an RTLS is effective 
only if you target problem areas successfully and identify how you will 
measure improvements. In a staff safety application, for example, you’d 
identify typical response times before and after the RTLS is deployed.

80
Part II: Implementing RTLS in Your World 
In addition to process improvements, you need to understand the organization’s 
analytics and reporting so that the state of your RTLS application is reported 
to the appropriate people.
Checking out your suppliers, 
clients, and competitors
If you know what processes and choices have been made by your suppliers, 
clients, and competitors with respect to an RTLS, you can start contemplating 
what might be beneficial to you also. Following are the questions that you 
want to ask:
 
✓ Vendors: What are your vendors doing in RTLS projects? For example, 
if one of your vendors is using it to track recalled items, does it make 
sense for you?
 
✓ Clients: Are your clients using an RTLS? For example, if the first thing 
your client does when he receives products from you is tag them, maybe 
you need to look into tagging as a value add or for your own benefits.
 
✓ Competitors: What are your competitors doing? Watch all press 
releases and marketing announcements to figure out the reasons behind 
competitor choices. Some might be applicable to you for your business.
 
✓ Technologies: What technologies are being used by your vendors, 
clients, and competitors? A simple reasoning is that they have teams of 
people doing the investigative work, and you want to benefit from their 
research.
 
Understanding why and how your vendors, clients, or competitors are 
embarking on RTLS projects will help you envision how you can use an RTLS 
successfully as well.
Enlisting Support
An important part of performing due diligence is knowing exactly who will 
benefit from the RTLS implementation beyond the primary users. What 
potential exists for other departments? Identify all the primary constituents 
and educate them on the benefits of an RTLS.
In the long term, an RTLS has enormous benefits and can affect an entire 
operation: manufacturing, operations, packaging, warehouse management, 
security, research, billing, materials management, finance, IT, and so on. 
Secure buy-in from upper management, and form a cross-functional team 

81
 Chapter 4: Planning for a Successful Implementation
consisting of folks from all departments, whether or not the initial RTLS 
application affects them. Educate the team on real RTLS performance and 
expectations, and leverage any data collected internally among departments.
Make sure that you have a clear definition of how success is defined by the 
executives, the team, and any other stakeholders. Also determine whether 
the definition of success will change as yearly fiscal goals change.
Engaging allies early helps you build the support you need to sustain your 
RTLS initiative over the long term, as well as achieve a better ROI by using 
the same infrastructure for many applications.
Defining the Scope of Your 
RTLS Implementation
By scope, I mean developing a common understanding as to what’s included 
and what isn’t included in your RTLS application. For example, if you’re 
creating an asset-security application that will alert you when an asset leaves 
a well-defined perimeter, define things such as
 
✓ Areas: The areas (or perimeters) where asset security will be implemented.
 
✓ Expectations near perimeter: What’s expected when the asset is 
seen near the perimeter? For example, automatic door locks, alerts to 
security, and so on.
 
✓ Expectations outside perimeter: What’s expected when the asset has 
actually crossed the perimeter? For example, can a security guard still 
locate it after it’s left the perimeter?
The key components of scope of an RTLS application are
 
✓ Physical areas: The areas where the application will work, potentially 
narrowing it by region, department, or smaller zone in the facility.
 
✓ Assets/people: List of assets/users that will be involved.
 
✓ Functionality: The features of the application.
Scope will change as you proceed, and this is to be expected. It’s difficult to 
foresee all needed features at the start, and as the details become clearer and 
people figure out how to use the RTLS, more features will creep in. For these 
reasons, you need to have some contingency (such as additional time and 
money) built in your plans.

82
Part II: Implementing RTLS in Your World 
 
For a first project, try to minimize scope. For example, instead of implementing 
asset security for the whole hospital, implement it first only in the emergency 
department. Grow your RTLS in stages. Planning small projects will increase 
your chances of success and lead to wider RTLS adoption throughout the 
organization.
Anticipating the Future
Although you need to be realistic about what you can accomplish in the 
initial phases of RTLS implementation, don’t shoot yourself in the foot by 
making choices that limit the possibilities of the RTLS infrastructure. The 
things you may want to consider are
 
✓ Types of assets: If you have assets in different shapes and form factors, 
you may want to think about how you’ll be attaching the tags to 
those assets. A good strategy is to think about all high-value assets in 
your organization, whether or not you target them in your initial 
implementation.
 
✓ People locating: Your RTLS implementation may or may not track 
people, and your needs for tracking people may be different in different 
phases of deployment, but do think about applications such as 
evacuation management (making sure that all employees or visitors 
have left the building and assembled in predetermined evacuation 
areas) and visitor tracking.
 
✓ Accuracy: In the initial implementation, you may not need very high 
accuracy, but you may want to plan so that you don’t need to install 
totally different technology throughout the facility if you later need 
higher accuracy for some other application.
 
✓ Scope: Based on your facility or needs, you may not need an RTLS that 
works both indoors and outdoors or in all areas in the facility, but you 
may want to plan in such a way that no part of the facility is left out.
Understanding the Technology
Understanding what technology will work best in your environment — as 
well as the custom technology, integration, installation, and maintenance 
requirements in your environment for your applications both today and 
tomorrow — is one of the most important tasks with respect to an RTLS.

83
 Chapter 4: Planning for a Successful Implementation
Besides investing in building your staff’s expertise in the technology, you can 
do the following things:
 
✓ Invite RTLS hardware, software, and integration partners to demonstrate 
their products’ capabilities to users.
 
✓ Participate in RTLS events and organizations, such as RFID Journal Live, 
IDTechEx — Active RFID, RTLS & Sensor Networks, and so on.
 
✓ Visit sites and partners that have working RTLS solutions.
 
Find partners who know and support more than one technology so that the 
partners won’t be hung up on a specific RTLS technology and you will get 
more unbiased advice.
Creating an Implementation Plan
A high-level implementation plan is the final step that sets the stage for success. 
The plan consists of resources, milestones and deadlines, project tasks, and 
dependencies.
 
✓ Resources: Resources refer to all the equipment, materials, and 
personnel required for the project. Selecting personnel with the right 
skill set for different tasks is very important for success.
 
✓ Milestones and deadlines: These are the events (or dates) that indicate 
significant progress or are stages of completion of major tasks. For 
example, completing the installation of each location sensor is a good 
milestone to track and completing RTLS implementation fully is the final 
deadline.
 
✓ Project tasks: These are all the tasks that you have to do, such as 
planning where to install location sensors, actually installing location 
sensors, and so on. Each task is usually defined with all the resources.
 
✓ Dependencies: Dependencies are very important to recognize: You 
can’t start using the tags until you’ve installed location sensors. You 
can’t install location sensors until you’ve made the decision on a vendor 
and technology. And so on. Other dependencies are things such as the 
nature of certain tasks — the number of personnel involved, their 
specific needs, and so on.
 
You can use scheduling and planning software, such as Microsoft Office 
Project; access a project management tool online; use spreadsheet software; 
or simply keep track manually, with pen and paper. No matter whether software 
is used, establish processes that alert you about any significant events, such 
as slips in the schedule.

I
mplementing a full RTLS involves a significant amount of money and 
procedural changes throughout an organization. Having a deployment 
plan that works is essential; you don’t want to waste money or find yourself 
backtracking to correct critical errors that could have been prevented with a 
little planning.
This chapter tells you the right questions to ask and provides the framework 
for running a pilot test to ensure that you’re up and running with your RTLS 
as quickly and easily as possible.
Adopting a Test Model
Before you deploy an RTLS, you must figure out one very important thing: 
Will it work?
No single test model answers this question, and your particular experience 
will vary based on many factors, including availability and skill set of your 
own internal resources, sense of project urgency, support of decision-makers, 
and project complexity.
Generally speaking, though, the following four steps can help you determine 
the right technology and vendor:

86
Part II: Implementing RTLS in Your World 
 
1. Select a list of suitable technologies.
 
2. Select a list of suitable vendors.
 
3. Conduct a prepilot test to evaluate multiple vendors and make the final 
selection.
 
4. Conduct a pilot test before full deployment.
 
The ultimate goal of a running a test model is making a “go or no-go” decision 
on implementing the full pilot.
Selecting Technologies
When you select technologies, you gain a baseline understanding of various 
technologies, as well as a list of the technologies that are suitable for your 
applications and environment (and eliminate the ones that are not).
You should think of this phase as the phase of playing around with the 
technology and understanding its applicability to your applications and 
environment. Typically, you facilitate this process by obtaining starter kits 
from one or more RTLS vendors and using them to test how the RTLS works 
in an office or lab environment.
If you’re planning to locate assets indoors, for example, you eliminate 
standard Global Positioning System (GPS) technology in this phase 
because standard GPS requires a clear view of the sky to lock onto and track 
satellites. GPS signals travel by line of sight, meaning that they pass through 
clouds, glass, plastic, and other transparent objects but not through solid 
objects, such as buildings and mountains; as a result, GPS typically can’t 
locate indoors, underground, in urban canyons, or in similar environments. 
More details on various technologies as well as their pros and cons are in 
Part III.
Because playing around with technology allows people to get some hands-on 
experience, it helps you develop in-house knowledge. Organically grown in-
house talent can support your prepilot and pilot tests better, as well as your 
actual deployments. Accelerating the learning curve and growing this talent, 
even if you bring in seasoned consultants, will probably pay off in long term.

87
 Chapter 5: Preparing for Installation
Interviewing Vendors
The success or failure of an RTLS initiative rests on the selection of the 
appropriate technology vendor. The goal of this phase is to prepare a list of 
vendors that provide the suitable technologies for your purposes.
In this phase, you hold brainstorming sessions within your organization as 
well as with different vendors to understand how their products and solutions 
fit your application and environment. The more rigorously you question your 
true needs, the better able you are to select the best products and vendors 
to evaluate.
When reviewing RTLS solution choices from several vendors, keep in mind 
these questions (independent of the technological choice):
 
✓ Has the vendor’s system been thoroughly tested in different 
environments (and especially in an environment like yours)? Unless 
the technology you’re looking into is a recent innovation with significant 
theoretical advantages, it usually is in your best interest to work with 
a solution that has been deployed in many different environments as 
well as in environments like yours. The key advantages include stability 
of the solution (more bugs have been fixed), mature troubleshooting 
capabilities (the vendor has figured out how to debug and resolve issues 
faster), and a better road map to the solution (the vendor is getting 
ideas and suggestions from a diverse pool of customers).
 
✓ Has the system been tested on different types of assets (especially 
assets like yours) and carried in different ways by people? A specific 
tag technology, tag design, or asset behavior can cause undesired 
results in the short term as well as the long term. A tag meant to be 
carried by a person, for example, may seem to be ergonomic and 
reasonable but may not be really comfortable to wear. Alternatively, a 
tag may have some radio frequency (RF) technology that interferes 
with the RF communications of the asset itself, or the asset may create 
significant vibrations that prevent the tag from performing optimally. 
You can prevent these problems and many other pains if the solution 
you’re planning to explore has been tested and used by other assets or 
people in similar ways.

✓ What are the costs of installation and deinstallation for a small area as 
well as for the full deployment? Often, for reasons beyond your 
control, you may not have full understanding of installation costs in 
the beginning, and incremental costs may occur while the installation 
proceeds. By having this data for both small and large areas, you may 
be able to extrapolate the variation in costs for the complete installation 
based on the variations of cost in a smaller pilot installation. One cost 
that usually isn’t discussed enough is the cost of deinstallation; significant 
deinstallation costs may hinder your expansion and change plans.
 
✓ Can the solution be integrated with many enterprise applications, 
especially applications like yours? If the RTLS solution under 
consideration has been integrated with many applications, it probably 
has much more mature application programming interfaces (APIs) for 
the software, which makes integration with your application easier.
 
✓ Can the technology be upgraded? Some vendors provide tags and 
hardware that aren’t upgradeable in the field. Having non-upgradeable 
tags can be an advantage because such tags usually are hackerproof, 
but if a critical bug occurs in your environment, you may be left with 
no option but to remove and reattach all tags. For this reason, you may 
prefer upgradable tags. Similarly, if the software in location sensors 
isn’t upgradeable, you may end up uninstalling and reinstalling all the 
hardware in your ceilings, walls, and so on.
 
✓ Does the vendor have a broad tag portfolio? A broad portfolio means 
that you can expand your RTLS deployment to different areas and 
different applications; it also signifies the vendor’s maturity. For example, 
if the vendor has tags that can be deployed indoors only, you may not 
be able to use the tags in outdoor areas. Or, if the vendor has only one 
shape/size tags, you may not be able to use those on different types of 
assets.
 
✓ Can quality-assurance procedures be established, and does the vendor 
have some reports and performance metrics to bring to the table? 
Having quality-assurance metrics indicates the maturity of the solution 
as well as the vendor’s experience.
After you select the technologies and vendors, the next logical step is 
conducting a prepilot test.
Testing the Waters with the Prepilot
The prepilot phase (often referred to as proof of concept) is the phase in 
which you invite vendors to prove that their solutions work in your 
environment for your application. This phase allows you to evaluate 
technologies and vendors, and then make the final selection.

89
 Chapter 5: Preparing for Installation
Prepilot tests are useful for providing a feasibility study of the technology 
and performance data on the technology, as well as for giving you a 
high-level idea of your installation needs and vendors’ capabilities. A 
prepilot test confirms not only the applicability, but also the practicality 
and cost-effectiveness of a technology and the RTLS solution.
During the initial prepilot phase, you should select a small group of savvy 
users to test the technologies, as you don’t want to burden yourself with 
training and support.
Although you don’t want to draw significant resources for the prepilot phrase, 
you do want to have a well-defined test scenario and performance-metrics 
goals. Here’s the recommended approach for the prepilot test:
 
✓ Clearly defined scope: Do the testing in an area that’s representative of 
the whole environment — or, if possible, in the worst environment for 
the technology that you’re trying. The test area shouldn’t be so big that 
testing interferes with your business or so small that you can’t evaluate 
accuracy.
 
✓ Realistic use scenarios: Use scenarios that are as close to the business-case 
assumptions as possible. Select the tag types (attached to assets or 
carried by people) that are as close to the real business case as possible. 
If you’re planning to invest in an RTLS for asset security to prevent loss 
and valuable equipment theft and want to receive alerts when assets 
move into and out of areas of interest, you need to have a similar setup 
and similar accuracy expectations in your prepilot testing area and you 
should conduct the testing around it.
 
 Establishing expectations up front about what must work and what is 
merely desirable in the real application saves headaches down the road.
 
✓ Clearly defined test plan: The basic objective of your test plan is to 
clearly define each test case (such as the steps to be executed and the 
expected results), define deliverables and responsible parties, and 
communicate to all responsible parties the test strategy employed. Work 
with your vendors to coordinate and set expectations on this test plan.
 
✓ Simplicity: You shouldn’t have any training or support needs during 
testing.
 
✓ Clearly defined performance metrics: The performance metrics depend 
on your application, but you can’t compare technologies unless you 
have clearly defined metrics and record data meticulously.
 
✓ Multiple technologies: Testing multiple technologies at the same time 
or closely spaced in time enables you to apply similar rules to everyone 
and understand the differences in various technologies and solutions 
very easily.
 
✓ Input collection: A side goal of a prepilot test is collecting input from 
prepilot users, even for the technology that you select as best. This 
information will help you achieve success in the actual pilot test.

90
Part II: Implementing RTLS in Your World 
Conducting the Pilot
In most technology rollouts, one of the difficult decisions is the implementation 
strategy: Do you take the big-bang approach and get it done with quickly, or 
do you slowly phase in new processes and technology over time? Although 
the appeal of the big-bang (or sudden implementation) strategy is that it 
focuses the organization for an intense and relatively shorter period of time 
than if the project were phased, in most new technology rollouts, the big-
bang approach is less than optimal. After you narrow the selection in the 
prepilot test, lay the foundation for evaluating the RTLS technology in a pilot 
setting.
Conducting a pilot before full deployment is a low risk approach and is less 
likely to result in relative chaos. However, you do want to keep focus and 
conduct pilots in a very timely manner to maintain a sense of urgency and to 
keep within your budget because it will now take
 
✓ More time to address the problem for which you’re investigating an 
RTLS
 
✓ More time to realize the benefits of an RTLS
 
✓ More time to see savings by use of an RTLS
The goal of the pilot test is to identify problems and enable optimization 
before wider deployment. Every environment is unique, but you can use the 
procedures in the following sections as guidelines for running a pilot program.
Identifying the tasks and resources
Identify the tasks and resources necessary to conduct the pilot RTLS 
program. Your objective is to clearly identify your needs with respect to
 
✓ Computers and other hardware: As needed for location engine, 
middleware, and application software.
 
✓ Location sensors: The location sensors needed for the pilot.
 
✓ Tags: The tags (and spares) needed for the pilot.
 
✓ Assets/people: Identifying the exact assets or persons to whom the tags 
will be attached or be carried by.
 
✓ Required physical installation: This implies understanding and 
planning of all physical installation, such as digging walls.
 
✓ Required network changes: This may mean setting up new networks, 
such as virtual wired or wireless local area networks, configuring DHCP 
(dynamic host configuration protocol) servers that allocate IP addresses 
for all network devices, such as location sensors, computers, and so on.

91
 Chapter 5: Preparing for Installation
 
✓ Required access controls: This may mean getting access to your 
network passwords, security keys, and so on so that tags, location 
sensors, and so on can communicate as well as potentially give the 
vendor access for remote troubleshooting.
 
✓ Business disruptions: It’s important to plan for the potential of business 
disruption during the installation process for the pilot.
 
✓ Communication process: This means identifying the means and 
mechanisms, such as e-mails, broadcast voice messages, frequency of 
e-mails, and so on for communicating stages, progress, and the pilot status.
Here are a few key things that you need to consider for planning your pilot:
 
✓ Scope: Create a pilot implementation of the RTLS solution in a limited, 
defined area. Controlling the scope, scale, and breadth of deployment is 
necessary for success. Don’t limit the scope of system features to be tested 
during the pilot, however; you want to see the full application in action.
 
✓ Users: Identify and select user groups for your pilot program. These 
users should be at about the same technical level as your system users 
in general. If your organization is large or has groups with vastly different 
skill sets, you should run a pilot program for each unique environment 
or group. Locate groups that are representative of the users throughout 
your organization.
 
 To maximize your success, make sure that volunteers have enough time 
in their schedules to participate fully in your pilot program.
 
✓ Tag installation: Plan for the processes of tag installation (often also 
dubbed as tag birthing, attaching tag, or associating tag to an asset or 
person). As part of these processes, you also want to define the steps for 
de-attaching tags, tag replacement, and changing batteries (if needed).
 
✓ Support: Plan to provide support for all issues, errors, or problems that 
users report. Develop a user-support plan that meets the needs of your 
users. As part of this plan, you need to identify the support staff and its 
resources.
 
 You also may want to identify the mechanisms that your end users and 
administrators use to provide you feedback. You need to ask your support 
personnel these basic questions:
 
• How difficult is it to troubleshoot the source of a problem?
 
• How much support can the support staff provide remotely, without 
being next to the users who are facing problems?
 
• How easy is it to replace tags, location sensors, and other equipment, 
as well as to do any upgrades?
 
• Can end users report problems accurately?
 
• How easy to use are the troubleshooting tools that are available to 
end users?

92
Part II: Implementing RTLS in Your World 
 
✓ Training: To ensure success, you must provide adequate training for all 
participants. Develop a training plan that meets your users’ needs. Use 
the training plan as the basis for the final deployment of your custom 
package. Revise the plan based on feedback from the pilot program and 
use the revised plan to train users for the final deployment. To develop 
this plan, you also need to identify the training staff and resources (as I 
discuss earlier in this section).
 
 An important thing to note is that training for administrators and support 
users should be separate from end-user training so that the unique 
needs of each group are addressed properly. End users are more likely 
to need training in how to use and how to report an issue, whereas 
administration and support staff will benefit more from knowing how to 
troubleshoot.
 
✓ Test plan and performance metrics: You should create a test plan for 
your pilot program. Start by answering these basic questions:
 
• What performance metrics are committed and required for your 
business case, such as response times in your application and 
desired accuracy?
 
• What scenarios will you follow when the RTLS fails?
 
• What scenarios will you follow when the RTLS works perfectly?
 
• What are the expectations in the areas where the RTLS isn’t 
deployed?
 
• How reliable are the equipment and tags under the given conditions?
 
• What is the optimal equipment configuration?
 
 You need to include the expectations for the test plan in the training so 
that the users can provide desired feedback.
 
✓ Rollout plan: You should create the installation and go-live plan for the 
pilot for deploying the tags, location sensors, servers, and application 
software. As part of this process, you should identify all equipment 
needs and resources, the people who will be installing equipment, the 
installation schedule, and any effects on end users (whether or not 
they’re participating in the pilot test).
 
 You should also prepare a checklist and identify the feedback 
questionnaire that you want your installation team to provide during 
and after the rollout.
 
✓ Evaluation criteria: Evaluation criteria for the pilot test include the 
number of users who were dissatisfied, the number of problems 
reported, the number of support calls and requests, and the resolution 
rate for problems.

93
 Chapter 5: Preparing for Installation
Getting ready and doing the rollout
When you get ready for the RTLS rollout, you must perform a few basic tasks:
 
✓ Provide end-user training.
 
✓ Provide administrator/support-staff training.
 
✓ Set up feedback mechanisms, such as a Web site or e-mail alias, so that 
end users, installers, and administrators can provide constant feedback 
to the design and testing teams.
 
✓ Get all equipment needed for the rollout.
 
✓ Notify all those people who will be affected by the rollout.
 
At appropriate milestones, such as ready to begin installation, tag installation 
complete, pilot testing begins, and so on, communicate with the team and users 
what you’re doing so that you set the right expectations for interruptions and 
performance behavior.
 
Ensure that documentation of the installation process is very well 
maintained so that you can improve it as you find out more about the 
technology.
Conducting the pilot testing
During this phase, you should plan to provide support for all issues, errors, 
or problems that users report. After you make any corrections, be sure to 
retest the system thoroughly.
The key objective of this phase is to ensure that you get enough pilot data 
from your participants. The testing and feedback will help you identify the 
effectiveness of the pilot and give you confidence that the RTLS will indeed 
work in your environment.
Maintain a record of all issues and problems you encounter. These records 
will help you design solutions for problems. Only after making adjustments 
based on input from the pilot test can you begin the full deployment.

Monitoring RTLS
In This Chapter
▶ Knowing what to monitor and why
▶ Understanding the different ways to monitor an RTLS
W
hen you prepare to install the hardware and software components 
of your RTLS, one of the most important things you need to do is 
empower your administrators to streamline the time and effort required to 
monitor and administer it.
You may have the best technology and a perfect RTLS application, but if you 
don’t have processes in place to ensure that the contracted level of service 
is provided to the users (whether people or applications) of the RTLS, to 
troubleshoot problems faced by your users (or inaccuracies in data received 
by your applications), and to anticipate or react to failures, you can’t sail 
smoothly and succeed in your RTLS deployment.
This chapter shows you how to monitor the performance and availability of 
your RTLS. Armed with the information in this chapter, you can keep your 
environment running smoothly, provide the means to correct problems 
before outages occur, and reduce the costs of resolving problems. With 
monitoring, you can also identify trends to facilitate capacity planning.
Monitoring RTLS Applications
Most administrators understand the need for application monitoring. In fact, 
administrators typically monitor the basic health of application servers by 
keeping an eye on CPU use, system efficiency, memory use, and the like. 
Because an RTLS application has a large number of moving parts, however, 
monitoring it can be overwhelming.
When you monitor an RTLS application, you need to ensure that the following 
elements are operational and performing optimally (as well as anticipate any 
failures before they affect the business):

96
Part II: Implementing RTLS in Your World 
 
✓ Tags: Tag failures include incidents, such as hardware malfunctions and 
software defects. You also need to monitor the remaining battery life of 
each tag.
 
✓ Location sensors: Location-sensor failures include malfunctions of 
hardware, defects in software, and changes in the orientation or position 
of a sensor. If your location sensors run on battery power, you also must 
monitor each sensor’s remaining battery life.
 
✓ Accuracy of locating: Your dynamic environment can affect your RTLS’s 
accuracy of locating. Because locating algorithms depends on many 
environmental factors, you need to monitor changes in locating accuracy 
in all parts of the facility. Defects in software (tag, location-engine, 
middleware, or application software) also can cause a change in locating 
accuracy.
 
✓ Middleware/application software: You need to monitor the technical 
“up and running availability” of your middleware and application software. 
You also need to keep an eye on resources used by applications for 
optimal performance.
 
✓ Server: The server includes hardware, virtual machines, and the 
operating system. To ensure high availability and performance of 
configured applications and services, you need to do server-centric 
monitoring of the server hardware, operating system, and virtualized 
environment (if any). The values to be monitored include CPU use, 
memory use, networking errors, and file system limits.
 
✓ Business metrics relevant to the RTLS application: The factors you 
need to monitor include response time and latency.
 
✓ User experience: User experience is an emotional indicator, but it’s also 
a good indicator of how effectively the RTLS is improving the efficiency 
and accuracy of tracking people and assets.
Knowing How to Monitor Your RTLS
You can establish procedures for monitoring your RTLS via a third-party 
managed service, manage all sites centrally, or manage each site individually. 
In any case, you should have an RTLS-application monitoring integrated with 
the overall business monitoring; for instance, monitoring the RTLS application 
shouldn’t be a separate chore but rather part of the overall business 
monitoring. For example, businesses usually have an application that monitors 
all the critical servers and application notifications (sent alerts, such as SMS, 
e-mail, and so on) to the administrators (or as appropriate) whenever any 
of the servers become inaccessible. In this case, it’s most convenient for 
an administrator if your RTLS application servers, location sensors, and so 
on are also monitored by the same application. This way an administrator 
doesn’t have to use separate applications to monitor overall servers and the 
RTLS.

97
 Chapter 6: Monitoring RTLS
Monitoring your RTLS enables you to do the following:
 
✓ Ensure 24/7 availability: You can verify the status and availability of 
your application servers, middleware, location engine, location sensors, 
and so on. The RTLS delivers notifications to designated personnel when 
problems occur and helps you to quickly address situations that, left 
unattended, could lead to RTLS downtime.
 
✓ Capacity planning: You can assess and quantify resource requirements, 
such as network bandwidth, server cloud capacity, and so on for an 
RTLS and prepare for adding capacity when you add more tags or 
monitor at higher frequencies.
 
✓ Reducing service costs and lower operational risk: Automated 
monitoring reduces the impact of poor communication as well as need 
of additional resources in service and support.
 
✓ Detecting root cause: Facilitate locating performance bottlenecks and 
detecting the causes of problems.
You can monitor your RTLS in several ways, as discussed in the following 
sections.
Recognizing the benefits 
of proactive monitoring
One of the most embarrassing situations is being surprised to hear from 
users about a critical error or outage of your RTLS. The fact that an application 
is down should never be news to you. You need to ensure that your users can 
trust the RTLS 24/7 or as per the contract level agreement.
For this purpose, you can use proactive monitoring, which is a set of tests that 
does the following:
 
✓ Measure critical system data such as reachability and CPU, disk, or 
memory use on the server where the RTLS application is running
 
✓ Simulate real user experiences (exercise the components of the RTLS 
solution in the same way that an actual user would)
 
✓ Measure the application’s performance metrics, such as response time
These measurements give you the ability to identify potential problems 
before they affect your users. If any value is outside the predefined threshold 
levels, administrators can proactively drill down to evaluate performance 
characteristics at the next level down.
One example of proactively testing your RTLS is deploying some tags at fixed 
locations and getting those tags’ locations reported at specific intervals. If 

98
Part II: Implementing RTLS in Your World 
performance such as response time or accuracy is outside the predefined 
threshold at one level, administrators can drill down to evaluate performance 
characteristics at the next level.
In addition, by providing consistent repeated testing of the RTLS application, 
you can conduct tests independent of actual end-user traffic. If a server goes 
down in the middle of the night, for example, and no end users are using the 
system at that time, the synthetic tests still identify the outage.
 
Because an RTLS can be affected adversely by the environment, you may want 
to set up proactive tests in a controlled environment to eliminate variables 
that may exist in a real end user’s system and that may potentially skew the 
RTLS performance metrics. This way, you can always determine whether 
the RTLS is working or whether an environmental issue exists.
 
You can use RTLS proactive monitoring to integrate RTLS solution monitoring 
into your other enterprise monitoring solution quickly and easily.
Using reactive monitoring
Reactive monitoring allows you to respond quickly to issues when they arise 
and ensure optimal service levels more effectively. To effectively monitor 
an RTLS in this way, you must ensure that your RTLS solution provides you 
enough troubleshooting abilities, including the following:
 
✓ Granular logs: Your application should allow the user to establish a list 
of which events or categories of events should be logged. The advantage 
is that you can enable different kinds of logging to focus on debugging 
the problem at hand without bringing the whole system down or affecting 
everybody else in the system.
 
✓ Log destinations: Your application should allow you to configure 
different log messages to different destinations. This allows you to filter 
messages that are specific to the problem and find the root cause faster. 
This also prevents delays in the processing of critical situations because 
alerts for critical situations can be routed to fax, e-mail, SMS, and other 
external methods of communication.
 
Armed with better logging and error messages for your RTLS, you can pinpoint 
error conditions or other problems quickly, determine what is causing the 
problems, and resolve those problems.
Encouraging end users to participate
No matter how fancy the RTLS tags and technology you choose are, an RTLS 
application can’t succeed without your end users’ participation.

99
 Chapter 6: Monitoring RTLS
 
If your RTLS application is malfunctioning or underperforming, the results can 
be disastrous for end users, who often have priorities other than making your 
RTLS application work. When an end user experiences a slow RTLS or is 
unable to use the RTLS application to achieve the desired task, he or she loses 
faith not only in the application, but also in the value of the RTLS itself. This 
experience and its long-term aftereffects are exceptionally difficult to correct.
To prevent negative experiences among your end users and to enable your 
administrators to respond to end users’ problems, you should engage your 
end users not only for interactive feedback, but also for process definition 
and improvement. To help head off problems, prepare your end users to do 
the following:
 
✓ React to inaccuracies: Explain to users what to expect and what not to 
expect, as well as how to report unexpected inaccuracies or behaviors.
 
✓ Respond to failures: Explain to users what is a failure and what is an 
acceptable behavior, as well as how to report such failures or behaviors.
 
✓ Report opinions: Encourage end users to report their opinions and 
problems.
 
If administrators and users continually share ideas and best practices, this 
communication will lead to increased value and sustained success of your 
RTLS application. Throughout the installation and after installation, this type 
of communication also provides an outline of various end-user communication 
activities that will be conducted along the timeline.
Establishing baselines
You can get valuable performance data on an RTLS solution you’re monitoring, 
sometimes within hours of installing and activating the solution. But the data 
you get will be more valuable if you have historical performance data to 
provide context.
If your RTLS solution automatically creates statistical baselines for each 
relevant measurement by capturing actual data based on the time of day 
and day of the week, the application can establish variable performance 
thresholds based on real-world use. You may not need thresholds on every 
measurement, of course; you may need to be alerted only for out-of-boundary 
conditions on measurements that really matter to the user experience or to 
overall system performance.
After you establish thresholds that are relative to the baselines, you can 
configure your RTLS application to generate events or automated actions 
when those thresholds are exceeded.

Chapter 7
Integrating RTLS
In This Chapter
▶ Knowing how integration works
▶ Understanding RTLS integration
▶ Integrating an RTLS with your other business applications
T
hese days, dozens — if not hundreds — of different types of open and 
proprietary applications for planning, managing, and monitoring materials, 
employees, processes, and customer relationships make up the operating 
system of a company. These applications support a variety of business 
functions, such as manufacturing, supply-chain management, financials, 
projects, human resources, and customer-relationship management.
When you add an RTLS to this mix, the expectation that your RTLS applications 
can use the enterprise data from these applications — and the reverse — is 
already set. Integrating an RTLS is all about integrating the real-time visibility 
(of tag location) seamlessly into business practices, as well as ensuring that 
the existing or new applications can use the RTLS data to trigger meaningful 
transactions.
In this chapter, I show you the benefits of integrating an RTLS with the 
applications and software systems your company already has in place as 
well as how you can make it happen.
Understanding Integration
Integration is the process of enabling applications to share data and work 
together as seamlessly as possible. It often involves providing new application 
programming interfaces (APIs) to existing applications. To be fully integrated, 
applications must follow new business logic and process rules as well.
Integration is a transformational project that involves people, processes, and 
technology. It’s also a way of thinking — an approach to doing applications.

102
Part II: Implementing RTLS in Your World 
Unfortunately, integration is easier said than done. Whether applications 
are homegrown, purchased, or a combination, they’re built over time in 
different languages, using different technologies, and run on different 
hardware platforms and operating systems with inconsistent user interfaces. 
As Figure 7-1 shows, companies have islands of business functions and data, 
with each island existing in its own problem domain. In many cases, the 
original architects of these applications never intended to share data. These 
applications were developed as shortsighted tactical actions to solve specific 
business problems, and many times, they were specified, funded, operated, 
and maintained on a limited budget.
Furthermore, it isn’t a simple matter for an enterprise to discard its existing 
applications and develop new ones, or even to overhaul its established 
business processes, to effect a change in its business model. These kinds 
of changes are financially expensive to undertake and daunting in terms of 
human resources.

 Chapter 7: Integrating RTLS
 
When you select an RTLS solution, make sure that you’re not adding a vertical 
silo — a system that’s manageable and usable within its context. To monitor 
and manage RTLS devices such as location sensors, for example, IT personnel 
shouldn’t have to use a separate dashboard provided by the RTLS solution; 
rather, they should be able to use their common dashboards and existing 
processes. To make an RTLS part of the fabric of the enterprise, you need to 
integrate the RTLS solution seamlessly into your existing enterprise middleware, 
databases, applications, workflow, and other systems.
Effective RTLS integration can result in many important benefits, as 
described in the following sections.
Streamlining inefficient procedures
Procedures that require users to switch among applications usually are 
more error prone and inefficient compared with procedures that involve 
user interaction with a single application. Integration can simplify business 
processes and workflows.
Suppose that you’ve installed an RTLS solution to locate assets, and you’re 
also using material management software to track the maintenance history 
and maintenance due dates for assets. Without integration, to find assets 
on which maintenance is past due, you need to create a report from your 
material management software and then enter that data manually into the 
RTLS asset-locating application. With integration, you have access to 
maintenance due dates from the RTLS asset-locating application itself, so 
you can locate the assets on which maintenance is past due without going 
through two applications or making manual data entries.
Eliminating the cost of managing 
redundant data
Storing the same data in multiple databases increases hardware, software, 
backup needs, and administration costs; it also introduces inefficiencies and 
risks data corruption.

104
Part II: Implementing RTLS in Your World 
Consider a business deploying an RTLS asset-locating system. Furthermore, 
assume that the business is already making use of an asset management 
system that has information, such as manufacturer, model, serial number, 
purchase date, maintenance due date, and so on about all assets.
 
✓ Problem: Because people usually recognize assets by their model or 
manufacturer instead of a serial number (a unique number typically 
assigned by manufacturer), a SKU (stock keeping unit, an identification, 
usually alphanumeric, used to track for inventory purposes), or some 
other identification number, it’s of limited or no value if the only way 
RTLS asset-locating systems refer to the assets is with their tag IDs.
 
✓ Solution: To solve this problem, RTLS asset-locating systems typically 
maintain a database that has some information about the asset, such 
as its manufacturer, model, serial number, maintenance due date, and 
so on along with the tag ID. These bits of additional information about 
assets are copied from the asset management system. You can note the 
duplication of data that can potentially result in inconsistencies, errors, 
and increased backup needs.
 
 For example, imagine a human error in entering the maintenance due 
date, and now, the asset has two different maintenance due dates. On 
the other hand, if the RTLS asset-locating system was integrated (instead 
of maintaining a duplicate database), it actually programmatically obtained 
the information about assets from the asset management system, so you 
wouldn’t have this problem.
 
Integration eliminates the cost of storing and managing redundant data. 
Overall integration also lowers ongoing system administration expenses.
Adding new business value
RTLS integration is the most cost-effective way to add new business value to 
the enterprise by means of innovation and new business logic and processes. 
Consider the following examples:
 
✓ Improve customer service by prompting the nearest customer service 
agent (wearing RTLS tag) when a customer summons for help.
 
✓ Ensure service quality by monitoring the attendants (wearing RTLS 
tags) in a senior-care facility to make sure that they are indeed making 
rounds.
 
✓ If an employee time-card management application is integrated with an 
RTLS, employees no longer need to enter data manually. Because the 
application is linked to the RTLS, it automatically knows when employees 
enter and exit the building.

105
 Chapter 7: Integrating RTLS
 
✓ If a hospital’s asset-disinfection management application is integrated 
with the RTLS, employees no longer have to sign off manually when 
disinfection of an asset is complete. Working with the RTLS, the 
asset-disinfection management application knows whether the asset 
went to the disinfection room after it was in a patient’s room.
Increasing scalability
As your company grows, its application needs change with respect to the 
volume and velocity of the data that it should manage. Scalability refers to 
the ease with which an application can accommodate such changes. Many 
applications were designed with a specific purpose in mind and without 
enough emphasis on increasing functionality down the road, so their scalability 
is limited. Managing scalability changes across multiple applications can be a 
difficult task, as you may end up modifying applications one by one and piece 
by piece.
For example, consider a business using an asset management system and an 
RTLS asset-locating system for managing about 5,000 assets (similar to the 
example discussed in the earlier section, “Eliminating the cost of storing 
and managing redundant data”). If the business decides to scale the asset 
management system to manage over 100,000 assets and if the two applications 
aren’t integrated, the decision makers might not see the needs of scaling the 
servers used by the RTLS asset-locating system at the same time. It’s easier 
to visualize the needs and efforts for scalability of an integrated view of multiple 
applications. Integration lays a framework that provides an enterprise greater 
scalability.
Unifying device management
One of the fundamental jobs of network administrators is network monitoring 
and management: monitoring and managing the computers, systems, 
and services that comprise the network. This function allows network 
administrators to maintain a robust network and even to improve the network. 
It includes checking for slowing or failing components, as well as upgrading 
software and configurations as needed.
Because an RTLS solution potentially adds new hardware (such as tags and 
location sensors) and software (such as that used inside tags, location 
sensors, location engines, and middleware), a nonintegrated RTLS forces 
administrators to monitor several disparate dashboards. As a result, 
an administrator may ignore an event that’s critical for location accuracy but 
not for network operation, or forget to apply a security patch to the RTLS. 
Integration enables a uniform methodology for monitoring and managing 
devices.

106
Part II: Implementing RTLS in Your World 
Knowing the Requirements for 
Integrating an RTLS
Integration usually is achieved through some form of plumbing of data 
transport, data transformation, and routing (see Figure 7-2). In the RTLS 
context, the middleware ensures data cross-pollination: use of raw RTLS 
events by the applications and linkage of tag and device information (such 
as asset IDs, personnel IDs, and location sensor IDs) from existing systems to 
the RTLS solution.

Integration 
plumbing.
 
Application 1
Application 2
Data transport
Data transformation
Data routing
The key components of integration plumbing are
 
✓ Data transport: The fundamental pipe that transfers data between 
software application subsystems. Data transport involves
 
• Protocols (such as TCP/IP) used to move data between applications
 
• Software (such as Java code) that actually transports the data
 
✓ Data transformation: The conversion of data from one data format 
(source) to another (destination). In one scenario, the source data 
format is the raw RTLS location events (a raw byte array, for example), 
and the destination data format is the data desired by an application 
(XML notation, for example). Data transformation involves

107
 Chapter 7: Integrating RTLS
 
• Mapping of data elements from source to destination: This 
mapping establishes the linkage between the source and destination 
applications. RTLS tag IDs can be linked to the IDs used by existing 
applications, such as asset ID, employee ID, or visitor ID. This 
mapping is a very important part of any real-time interface because 
field-level differences often exist between the host and destination 
system, and these differences need to be mapped to achieve 
successful integration.
 
• Translation of data from one type to another: This translation may 
be very simple, such as a data element represented as an 
integer in one application but expected to be a string in another 
application. Alternatively, the translation can be quite complex, 
such as when translation from data element to data element 
requires one-to-many and many-to-one transformation rules.
 
• Software code to do the transformation: This code consists of pro-
grams/functions written in any programming language (such as C, 
Java, PHP, or Perl) to do that translation work.
 
✓ Data routing: The real-time communication of data (such as an RTLS 
location event) from one application to another.
 
 The coordination of data from one application to another is the most 
difficult challenge in integration. Usually, data routing can be done in 
two ways:
 
• Synchronously: The application requests data periodically (also 
known as the pull model).
 
• Asynchronously: The application listens continually, and data is 
sent to it whenever available (also known as the push model).
 
 Asynchronous architectures have proved to be the best strategy for 
data routing because you don’t have to write APIs or function calls in 
one application so that they can be called by another application; in 
this method, the applications are loosely coupled. In asynchronous 
architecture, the two applications don’t even have to be aware of 
each other’s programming language. Other benefits of asynchronous 
architectures include less latency (the difference from the time when an 
event happens in one application to the time when the event is received 
by another application) and less load, as applications aren’t constantly 
trying to communicate.
For RTLS integration, your solution should have APIs and flexible architecture. 
Some API specifications are described in Table 7-1.

Adopting RTLS solutions that support standards-based integration interfaces 
is the most promising way to reduce the long-term costs of integration and to 
facilitate a flexible infrastructure.
Performing an RTLS Integration
Like any other integration, integrating an RTLS is a complex task. Many 
conflicting drivers and even more possible “right” solutions exist, and 
unfortunately, no how-to cookbook exists for integration solutions. Also, 
RTLS integration is a project in itself. The implementation project is defined 
with its schedule based on integration flows, budget constraints, staffing 
needs, outsourcing needs, and other considerations.
Before you begin implementing an RTLS, you need to do an integration audit. 
Then you must define your integration implementation strategy, as I describe 
in the following sections.
Step 1: Perform an integration audit
Before you implement the integration strategy, you must perform a thorough 
audit of your current and future interface plan. The integration audit 
includes analysis of your existing and planned interfaces, along with post-
audit prioritization and a report on your findings and interface strategy 
recommendations. It involves a comprehensive analysis of current systems, 
current interfaces, and current workflows.
You need to understand the applications (behaviors, interfaces, and 
languages) on either side and corresponding business needs to build these 
pipes between applications so that information can flow.

109
 Chapter 7: Integrating RTLS
Step 2: Define an integration 
implementation strategy
An integration implementation strategy includes the road map defining the 
processes, workflows, and integration flows that you want to see making use 
of an RTLS in your organization.
Estimate the costs
One key part of analysis for defining this strategy is estimating the costs of 
integration, as follows:
 
✓ Architecture cost: The architecture cost stems from integration 
development, execution, and setup of the operational environment. It 
includes licensing, new hardware, upgraded hardware/software, and 
rollout costs.
 
✓ Integration cost: The integration cost includes development of the 
software for the various interfaces and communications between 
systems. You may be surprised if you calculate the amount of time and 
effort that is associated with integration, especially when the resources 
are highly priced (or highly unavailable).
 
✓ Operating cost: The operating cost includes ongoing maintenance of the 
integrated system.
Avoid garbage in, garbage out
“Garbage in, garbage out” is not one of the 
design patterns you want to follow when 
designing an RTLS. You need to understand 
not just how to perform data transformations 
from one application format to another but 
also how to ensure that the data coming in is 
what you expect and that the data going out 
is what you plan. Otherwise, applications 
may ignore data that they don’t understand 
or make wrong decisions based on incorrect 
interpretation.
Consider a security application that sends 
Short Message Service (SMS) messages for 
security-breach events received, and assume 
that this application expects the time stamp 
to be part of the information included in the 
event received. If, for some reason, the time 
stamp included in the event is 0, the security 
application may never generate the event, and 
the whole purpose of the application may be 
lost.

110
Part II: Implementing RTLS in Your World 
Identify debugging and testing tools
Another key part of the integration implementation strategy is identifying 
debugging and testing tools for the integrated solution. It’s one thing to 
debug a component, but when components are plugged together, they don’t 
always fit. You need to identify debugging in the pipeline of integrated 
applications.
Understand integration challenges
Another aspect of the integration implementation strategy is understanding 
the challenges, such as the following:
 
✓ The business may have had a bad experience with IT integration in the 
past, or it may lack thoughtful leadership. You need to be sensitive to 
that situation.
 
✓ The business imperative needs to be explained properly. You must have 
clear objectives, know how those objectives will help the business, and 
how you will quantify improvements. Integration, like any other IT 
project, isn’t an end in itself; it must serve to make the business more 
profitable, more competitive, or more efficient, and the value of that 
greater profitability, competitiveness, or efficiency must be reflected in 
the requirements and budget for any prospective integration project.
 
An RTLS is all about assets and people. Without integration, the results are 
isolated functionality, multiple instances of the same data, redundant manual 
activities, higher costs, and inefficiencies. Even if you decide to not do the 
integration in the initial phase of your deployment, you need to be fully aware 
of integration needs and costs.

For anyone who is exploring technologies for an RTLS, 
these technologies are horses for courses. Each technol-
ogy has positives and negatives, so it’s crucial to under-
stand how different technologies handle different 
operational scenarios — especially how they respond to 
adverse conditions. In this part, I give you the inside track

Locating at Choke Points
In This Chapter
▶ Knowing the types of choke points
▶ Using choke points in the real world
▶ Understanding the underlying technologies
C
hoke points are strategic structures, such as doors and other entry or 
exit points, that help monitor and control the flow of assets or people 
within a building. Security check-in lanes in airports are good examples of 
choke points; other examples include checkout lanes at supermarkets and 
exit gates in parking lots.
Choke points have also been used in military strategy to force the enemy into 
a narrower formation, greatly increasing military personnel’s capability to 
control who can pass through and when.
Because choke points play critical roles in economics and security, the 
RTLS for locating at choke points has always received special attention from 
researchers and vendors.
Making Choke Points
Like any other RTLS, tags, location sensors, and a location engine are the 
fundamental constituents of an RTLS used for locating at choke points. A 
simple example of a choke point is shown in Figure 8-1. The type of location 
sensors and tags that are used depend upon the application using choke 
point. For example, if the application needs to open doors based on the tag 
ID, passive tags with an interrogator as a location sensor can be used, and 
if the application needs to lock doors based on the tag ID, active tags and a 
receiver as a location sensor might be required. The different types of choke 
points are explained in the following sections.

Keeping track of tags with interrogators
Interrogators (sometimes called readers) are short-range devices used to 
read passive tags by causing the tags to transmit their tag IDs and relevant 
info. In the interrogator model, these devices are placed at various choke 
points, such as interior and exterior doors and gates. For this model to work, 
the tags must be located within range of the interrogator, typically a few 
centimeters to a few meters.
You can think of an interrogator as the doorman of a choke point. Just as a 
doorman keeps track of people entering the building by taking down their 
information, the interrogator devices use radio-frequency (RF) waves or 
some other means to prompt tags entering its range to transmit preprogrammed 
tag IDs. The interrogator reads these messages and forwards them to the 
location engine. Then the location engine marks the location of each tag as 
the address of that interrogator (the choke point ID).
Interrogators are placed in such a way that the interrogation (read) range 
covers the choke point completely, as illustrated in Figure 8-2. If the choke 
point is large, multiple interrogators can be used. The tags that are attached 
to the assets or carried by people usually are passive.

Locating at choke points with exciters
Exciters are transmit-only short-range devices that are used to excite the 
tags — that is, cause them to transmit their tag ID and relevant info to the 
location engine using a separate infrastructure spread throughout the 
facility. For this model to work, the tags must be located within range of the 
exciter, typically within a few centimeters to a few meters. Additionally, the 
exciters also include their address (the choke point ID) in their transmissions, 
so that when a tag gets excited and sends a message to the location engine, 
the address of the exciter (the choke point ID) can be included in that 
message. The message informs the location engine which exciter is near a 
tag, thereby identifying the location of the transmitting tag.

116
Part III: Tag-A-Palooza: RTLS Technology Tour 
You can think of exciters as being like signposts. Just as signposts advertise 
information about location, exciters continuously transmit messages that 
include the choke point ID. When an individual or asset bearing a tag enters 
the exciter’s range, the tag reads this choke point ID to identify the tag’s 
location.
Exciters are placed in such a way that the range blankets the choke point. 
If the choke point is large, multiple exciters can be used. The tags that are 
attached to assets or carried by people usually have two technologies. One 
is the passive tag component that is excited by the exciter, and the other is 
a wireless network client component that communicates with the receiver 
infrastructure so as to communicate with the location engine, as shown in 
Figure 8-3.

 Chapter 8: Locating at Choke Points
Reading location with receivers
A receiver is a device that listens for RF signals and converts it into data 
packets that are available for further processing by, for example, a location 
engine. Locating at choke points with receivers is very similar to the way 
it’s done with interrogators (refer to the section, “Keeping track of tags with 
interrogators,” earlier in this chapter), except that in this case, the tags 
are active and continuously emit preprogrammed messages. As a result, 
whenever a person or asset bearing an RTLS tag enters the receiver’s range, 
the receiver can hear the message. The receiver in turn communicates this 
message to the location engine that updates the location of the tag as the 
location of the receiver. Optionally, based on configuration parameters such 
as “do not allow tag ID #35 to pass through the door,” the receiver can take 
an action such as flashing LED panels, generating SMS alert messages, locking 
doors, and so on.
Receivers are placed in such a way that their range covers the choke point 
completely. If the choke point is large, multiple receivers can be used. The 
tags that are attached to the assets or carried by people are active tags. See 
Figure 8-4.

Part III: Tag-A-Palooza: RTLS Technology Tour 
Locating at choke points using 
precision locating systems
Precision locating systems, as described in Chapter 2, precisely pinpoint the 
location of tags that are attached to assets or carried by people. Because the 
tags are located precisely, the precision locating system can detect whether 
a tag is at a choke point. This model may not be suitable, however, when the 
accuracy of position determined by the RTLS may have a large margin of 
error and your choke point is small (for example, if you’re using a precision 
locating system to determine if a person is in or out the room and your choke 
point is at the entrance or door of the room). Further assume that the precision 
locating system produces accuracy within 3–5 meters. In this scenario, if a 
tag is reported near the door, you may not know whether the tag is inside the 
room or outside the room with an accuracy range of 3 meters.
Putting Choke Points to Work
As in any other RTLS application, the use of choke points depends on the 
application. Choke points are used for work-in-progress applications where 
the tag is updated each time it passes through a choke point to indicate what 
manufacturing steps it has already been through, used in asset security 
applications, and so on.
Knowing the best uses for choke points
Because choke points make good security sense, they’re good fits for applica-
tions that monitor or control the movement of assets or people into and out 
of a facility.
Securing door locks
A magnetic door lock at a choke point is shown in Figure 8-5. One application 
for this type of choke point is to prevent infant abduction from a hospital. 
The newborn is given a tag at birth, usually on an ankle bracelet (the mother 
and father or partner also have tags, and all tags have matching ID numbers), 
and the application activates the magnetic door lock or holds the elevator if 
someone tries to exit with a protected infant without authorization.
Tracking people and assets through a facility
The following list describes some applications that track people and assets 
by using choke points:

119
 Chapter 8: Locating at Choke Points
 
✓ Inventory overflow management: Overflow inventory in temporary 
facilities is difficult to track. When tags are placed on all inventory, the 
location of every batch and lot is visible. If the warehouse is located in 
a different facility, choke points can monitor when inventory left the 
factory and when it arrived at the warehouse. This way, you can pick 
and pack directly from the overflow area without accessing the main 
warehouse. Using choke points in overflow areas, you can also quickly 
tell when sufficient room is available to move overflow inventory into 
the main warehouse.
 
✓ Evacuation management: In any enterprise, employees or visitors can 
be tagged, and choke points can be established at the entry and exit 
points of all buildings. In the event of an emergency, when evacuation is 
desired, the evacuation management team can ensure that all employees 
and/or visitors have indeed left the building.
 
✓ Food monitoring: Various choke points can be set up at shipping, 
receiving, or interdepartmental doorways, and tags attached to pallets 
of fruits or vegetables can record where the pallets have been. This data 
can be used to track paths of food throughout the facility and if need be, 
the source of any contamination can be traced.

Determining direction
Choke points can be used to determine the direction in which a person or 
asset is traveling. To get directionality, set up two choke-point devices (such 
as exciters, interrogators, or receivers) or slightly offset from one another at 
a choke point — for example, one on each side of a door. Based on the times 
when a tag was identified at the specific choke points, you can tell the direc-
tion in which the asset or person moved (see Figure 8-6).

120
Part III: Tag-A-Palooza: RTLS Technology Tour 
You can also use interrogators, receivers, and so on with multiple antennas 
to enact two choke point behaviors.

Managing interactions between departments
Locating at choke points can be very handy at points of interaction between 
workers with different disciplines or different departments, where everyone 
must communicate successfully. When production finishes an order and 
puts it in an area for completed orders, for example, the location engine can 
automatically notify the shipping department that the order is available at 
the choke point for the completed-order area. See Figure 8-7.

121
 Chapter 8: Locating at Choke Points
This system reduces the steps that production techs must take to deliver 
orders to shipping, and it reduces the steps that shipping workers must 
take to pick up the orders. Also, the system tells shipping when an order is 
ready, so workers don’t have to make trips to production and come back 
empty-handed because an order wasn’t ready.
Tracking the history of an asset’s location
Choke points are very useful when you want to know only where an asset 
has been — not its exact location at all times, but what path it took and what 
environmental conditions it went through. Such data can play a critical role 
in the economics of a business. Consumers and policymakers increasingly 
require full and detailed information on the source, treatment, and processing 
of food and its components. Choke points can be used to enable food tracking 
in the global supply chain.
Knowing what choke points can’t do
Although choke points are great for many applications, they work only if no 
way to get around them exists. Security guards checking the IDs of people 
entering or leaving a building are much less effective if somebody left a door 
open in the back of the building, for example.
 
By nature, choke points tend to get clogged. Clogs may be accidental or may 
occur as part of attacks. One strategy to avoid an attack or unnecessary delay 
at a choke point is by keeping one or more fixed reference tags at the choke 
point and monitoring for continuous visibility of those reference tags and 
raising alerts if you’re missing one or more reference tags. Another strategy is 
by installing wireless spectrum analyzers next to the choke point and raising 
alerts when pre-established thresholds for noise levels are breached.
Exploring the Underlying Technologies
Several technologies enable the implementation of choke points, and in 
the following sections, I provide you with an overview of key technologies 
(except precision locating technologies) that can be used. The precision 
locating technologies such as Wi-Fi, ZigBee, and Active UHF are covered in 
Chapters 10 and 11.
I also provide you pros and cons of each technology so that you can make 
sure you have selected the right technology. As an example, liquids such as 
water absorb high-frequency radio waves, whereas metals reflect them, so if 
you want to track fish, you can’t use choke points involving tags that use high 
frequencies.

122
Part III: Tag-A-Palooza: RTLS Technology Tour 
Passive low frequency (passive LF)
Frequencies between 30 kHz and 300 kHz are considered to be low. Because 
read ranges for low frequencies typically are several inches to several feet, 
low-frequency-based systems make good choke-point solutions.
A typical passive LF (passive low frequency) choke-point system consists 
of passive LF tags, an antenna, and an interrogator (refer to “Keeping track 
of tags with interrogators,” earlier in this chapter). You achieve locating at 
choke points by attaching passive LF tags to assets or people and placing 
interrogators at all critical choke points in the facility, as shown in Figure 8-8.

2 Tag
Passive LF RTLS systems use magnetic coupling. Such a system works 
this way:
 
1. The interrogator’s antenna creates a magnetic field.
 
2. When a passive LF tag enters that magnetic field, an electric current is 
induced in the tag, powering the tag’s circuitry.
 
3. The tag sends the interrogator a response that includes the tag ID and 
any other information stored in the tag.

123
 Chapter 8: Locating at Choke Points
In another model, the passive LF tags are used in conjunction with a backend 
wireless network client (active tag). Instead of an interrogator, this model 
uses an exciter and a separate receiver infrastructure to receive messages 
from the active tags (see Figure 8-9). (Refer to the section, “Locating at choke 
points with exciters,” earlier in this chapter.)

Tag
How passive LF tags work
The magnetic field needed for coupling needs 
to have enough intensity to power the tag 
circuitry. The intensity of the magnetic field 
decreases with distance through a factor that 
can be approximated as 1 divided by the cube 
of the distance: 1 ÷ (distance)3. This means 
that if you double the distance, the capability 
of reading the tag with the same interrogator is 
decreased to one eighth.
The transfer of energy from one circuit to 
another through a shared magnetic field is 
called inductive coupling. Usually, inductive 
coupling has electric and magnetic elements, 
but in LF systems, electric coupling is far less 
used. For inductively coupled tags (when used 
to operate passively), all the energy needed for 
the operation of the tags has to be provided by 
the interrogator.

124
Part III: Tag-A-Palooza: RTLS Technology Tour 
When the LF tag gets in range of the exciter’s RF field, the exciter triggers 
the active tag to make transmissions. Using exciters in conjunction with the 
receiver infrastructure provides instant information that a tagged asset or 
person passed through a gate, doorway, or some other choke point.
 
LF provides read ranges from a few centimeters to a couple of meters, 
depending on the sizes of the tags.

Although LF is the oldest adopted RFID technology and has been used in 
several industries for many years, a little work has been done in terms of 
standardization in the LF arena, due mainly to the fact that most of these 
implementations have been in closed-loop and controlled environments.
ISO (International Organization for Standardization) has renewed its efforts 
to develop LF standards, however. ISO 18000-2 is the standard defining 
parameters for air interface communications below 135 kHz. Also, ISO 11784 
and ISO 11785 have been used for some time in animal tracking. The latter 
two standards have several shortcomings that limit their widespread use, 
but they have proved to be effective where implemented. You can visit 
www.iso.org to find more information about these standards.
Pros and cons
Following are some of the pros or benefits of LF-based solutions:
 
✓ Worldwide: LF is used worldwide, with relative freedom from regulatory 
limitations.
 
✓ Underwater and underground: LF penetrates most materials, 
including water and body tissue, which makes it ideal for animal and 
fish identification. They can be used underwater and underground.
 
✓ Environmental tolerance: LF adapts to environments that contain 
metals, liquids, dirt, snow, or mud. It facilitates embedding tags in 
nonmetallic items (pallets, key fobs, cards, and so on) as well as it isn’t 
affected by surrounding metals, making it ideal for use on metal items 
such as vehicles, equipment, tools, and containers.
 
✓ Security: Unlike other wireless technologies such as Wi-Fi, it has no 
eavesdropping risk because the eavesdropping range is the same as tag 
range. That means if someone is listening, that person must be close 
enough to be seen.
Following are some of the cons or limitations of LF-based solutions:
 
✓ Penetration: Doesn’t penetrate or transmit around metals such as iron 
and steel.

125
 Chapter 8: Locating at Choke Points
 
✓ Interference: LF suffers from severely low read rates in noisy 
environments. The noise can be conducted on wiring, radiating short 
range or long range, and transient coming and going with the activation 
of circuits. Here is a list of sources that generate noise for LF:
 
• Power transformers
 
• Any improperly grounded electrical device
 
• Elevator drive motors
 
• Switching power supplies
 
• Lighting, dimmers, and lighting controls
 
• Electrical devices
 
✓ Read rate: LF reads at most a few tags at a time and doesn’t support 
simultaneous reads of large numbers of tags. LF systems typically can 
read only 10–20 tags per second. So for choke point areas where you 
expect to record location of a large number of assets or people moving 
at very high speed, it may not a good choice.
 
✓ Data transfer rate: LF provides a relatively low data transfer rate. In 
general, the lower the frequency, the slower the communication.
 
✓ Proprietary: Although the LF range used is accepted worldwide, most 
solutions in this frequency range are proprietary, and only closed-loop 
applications are possible.
 
✓ Large and complex tags: Tags (and location sensors) use relatively large 
antennas compared with higher frequencies. Also, tags are usually more 
complex because of the number of turns needed in induction coils.
Passive LF tags have a very large installation base. They are used in choke 
point applications such as access control, asset tracking, and animal 
identification.
Active low frequency (active LF)
Active LF choke-point systems are different from passive LF choke-point 
systems because the tags used are active (powered by internal energy 
sources such as a battery). The typical range of active LF tags, like that of 
passive LF tags, can be from a few inches to a few feet, depending on the 
antenna’s size, placement, and surroundings.
Because active tags don’t need to extract power from a magnetic field, they 
don’t have the distance limitations of passive tags and don’t suffer from 
severely low read rates in noisy environments.

126
Part III: Tag-A-Palooza: RTLS Technology Tour 
A typical active LF choke-point system consists of active LF tags, an antenna, 
and a base station (see Figure 8-10). You achieve locating at choke points by 
attaching active LF tags to assets or people and placing base stations at all 
critical choke points in the facility.

1 Tag
A typical active LF system makes use of chirp tags. In this system
 
1. The base station is a receiver that’s always listening.
 
2. Active LF tags chirp (that is, transmit their tag IDs and any other 
information stored in them) periodically, perhaps twice a second.
 
3. Whenever an active LF tag enters that magnetic field, the receiver 
listens to the variations in the magnetic field and thereby reads the tag 
response and detects the presence of the tag.
 
If multiple tags are present in the magnetic field of the receiver, transmissions 
from various tags may overlap, causing the receiver to read garbled messages. 
To prevent collisions and allow the receiver to read a larger number of tags, 
the tag ID and other information transmitted by tags must be relatively small.
Standardization
There have been no standardization efforts in active LF (specifically 30 kHz to 
300 kHz) space; however, IEEE is working on 1902.1, a standard for long wave-
length wireless network protocol, operating at wavelengths below 450 kHz, 
which will improve upon the visibility network protocol known as RuBee. 
RuBee typically operates in active LF (131 kHz) range and is described in the 
later section, “RuBee.”

127
 Chapter 8: Locating at Choke Points
Pros and cons
Most of the benefits and limitations of passive LF solutions also apply to 
active LF solutions. However, active LF tags have a few additional pros or 
advantages:
 
✓ Better read rates: They don’t suffer from severely low read rates in 
noisy environments.
 
✓ Noise detection: RF noise can block transmissions between tags and the 
antenna in both passive and active LF systems. In an active system that 
uses a receiver, however, the receiver can listen for noise and notify the 
system that tags may not be read because of excessive noise in the 
environment.
 
✓ Less latency: In active LF systems, because the choke point (receiver) 
hears the tag, the choke point can be integrated with a door controller 
or other general purpose IO devices, such as LED displays, robotic arms, 
automated gates, alarms, and so on, and the action can be done with the 
least possible latency. This is better in comparison to using exciters and 
passive LF tags where the exciters don’t know if the tag is in proximity 
and an external message needs to be communicated to the door controller 
or other general-purpose IO device.
Active LF tags have a few additional cons or disadvantages as well:
 
✓ Larger tags: Due to the addition of battery and corresponding circuitry, 
battery clips, and so on, these tags are larger than passive LF tags.
 
✓ Short battery life: Because the power consumption of any solid state 
circuit is proportional to the operating speed, these tags usually exhibit 
limited battery life (typically between two years and a maximum of five 
years).
RuBee
RuBee is a two way, active wireless protocol that operates at low frequencies, 
always below the 450 kHz range and often in the 131 kHz range. The protocol is 
similar to the IEEE 802 protocols (Wi-Fi, ZigBee, and Bluetooth) in that RuBee 
is networked by using on-demand, peer-to-peer, active radiating transceivers. 
RuBee can be used in many RTLS applications such as smart entry or exit 
portals, animal tracking, smart shelves for high-value equipment, and so on.
A typical RuBee system includes:
 
✓ Active LF RuBee tags: A RuBee tag is a radiating transceiver powering 
its emissions using its battery and timing them using its internal 
crystal (clock). A RuBee tag communicates using inductive coupling, as 
explained in the earlier section, “Passive low frequency (passive LF).”

128
Part III: Tag-A-Palooza: RTLS Technology Tour 
 
✓ Base station (location sensor): A RuBee base station is the router, and 
tags exchange packets (information such as their tag IDs) whenever 
tags come in its field. Virtually all the energy radiated by a RuBee base 
station is contained in the magnetic field, not the electric field. You can 
install base stations at choke points, and the base stations can forward 
information to the location engine.
RuBee protocol uses IP (Internet Protocol) addresses for tags. It’s a 
packet-based protocol in which only one end of the communication at a 
time generates fields. Because the tag is a transceiver, the tags could also 
generate a field and establish a peer-to-peer network with other tags. This 
enables other tags that aren’t in the field of a base station to exchange 
information with the base station (which forwards that information to the 
location engine).
 
RuBee has a range of 1–30 meters (3–100 feet), depending on the antenna 
configuration.
Standardization
IEEE is working on a standard, IEEE P1902.1 (IEEE Standard For Long 
Wavelength Wireless Network Protocol), with the objective to improve upon 
RuBee. The P1902.1 standard aims to provide a protocol that allows for the 
real-time searching of tags using IPv4 addresses. As part of the standard, 
an Ethernet-enabled router will manage the tag visibility network, allowing 
people to access each RuBee tag and its corresponding data over the Web.
The final specification and issued standard is expected by March 2009.
Pros and cons
Because RuBee makes use of magnetic waves and operates at low frequencies, 
all the pros and cons as listed in the earlier section, “Active low frequency 
(active LF),” apply. However, RuBee has a few additional advantages:
 
✓ Peer-to-peer networking: RuBee has the same advantage as other 
passive LF or active LF systems using magnetic waves — that is, RuBee 
works well in an active environment (with people, steel shelves, floors, 
cabinets, doors, and so on), as well as in situations where one or both 
ends of the communication are near steel or water. The key advantage 
of RuBee over other passive LF or active LF systems is the ability of tags 
to establish peer-to-peer networks, enabling a larger visibility network of 
thousands of tags.
 
✓ Thin tags: A RuBee tag can be nearly as thin as a credit card.
 
✓ Long battery life: Low cost 4 micrometer CMOS chips (CMOS refers to 
a particular style of digital circuitry design and a family of processors 
using a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor), low frequency, and 
low speed enable extremely long battery life.

129
 Chapter 8: Locating at Choke Points
The major disadvantages of RuBee include
 
✓ Speed: RuBee operates at 1200 baud (number of distinct symbols or 
pulses per second), which limits its ability with respect to tag reads 
(typically only about 6–10 reads per second).
 
✓ Small packet size: A RuBee packet size is limited to hundreds of bytes.
 
If multiple tags are present in the magnetic field of the receiver, transmissions 
from various tags may overlap, causing the receiver to read garbled messages. 
To prevent collisions and allow the receiver to read a larger number of tags, 
the tag ID and other information transmitted by tags must be relatively small.
Passive high frequency (passive HF)
Frequencies between 3 MHz to 30 MHz are considered to be high frequency 
(HF), and because read ranges for HF are 1 meter or less, HF-based systems 
make good choke-point solutions. A typical passive HF choke-point system 
operates at 13.56 MHz.
The HF frequency range is accepted worldwide, so HF systems are widely 
used, especially in hospitals, where they don’t interfere with existing 
equipment. HF tags were developed as low-cost, small-profile alternatives to 
LF RFID tags with the ability to be printed or embedded in substrates such 
as paper. Popular applications include library tracking and identification, 
patient identification, access control, laundry identification, and item-level 
tracking.
A typical passive HF choke-point system consists of passive HF tags, an 
antenna, and interrogators (readers). You achieve locating at choke points 
by attaching passive HF tags to assets or people and placing interrogators at 
all critical choke points in the facility.
Like LF systems, HF systems use inductive coupling for communication.
Although most access control systems today are based on LF, using either 
contactless cards or key fobs, HF is becoming the technology of choice for 
new access control and security systems. The additional memory allows for 
improved security and the integration of biometrics as part of the security 
features. Enhanced access control systems have the ability to validate 
assets as they pass through an access control system or portal. Assets with 
an embedded HF tag can be identified within the access control system. 
Documents and files can easily be identified and tracked as well.
 
HF has a typical range of 1 meter (3 feet), depending on the tag size and 
antenna configuration.

130
Part III: Tag-A-Palooza: RTLS Technology Tour 
Standardization
HF (13.56 MHz) emerged in the 1990s and is the basis of numerous standards, 
including ISO 14443, ISO 15693, and ISO 18000-3.
Pros and cons
Following are some of the pros or benefits of HF systems:
 
✓ Penetration: HF signals travel well through most materials, including 
water and body tissue.
 
✓ Interference: HF isn’t affected by electrical noise that may be generated 
by motors in an industrial environment.
 
✓ Small and printable tags: Because the length of the antenna is based on 
the length of the signal wave, the higher the frequency, the shorter the 
wavelength. For this reason, an antenna for a HF tag is small enough that 
it can be produced by printing it on a substrate in conductive ink and 
then affixing the chip. These tags can easily be embedded in nonmetallic 
items (labels, pallets, key fobs, cards, and so on).
 
✓ Range depends upon size: The larger the tag antenna, the greater the 
tag’s energy capture area and the greater the communication distance 
from the reader. Smaller tags may be easier to package into a product, 
but they reduce the communication distance available.
 
✓ High throughput: The higher the frequency, the higher the data 
throughput and the faster the communication between the reader and 
the tags. This increase in speed allows the reader to communicate 
with multiple tags at the same time — a process known as anticollision. 
Compared to LF, at HF, a reader can read up to 100 tags per second.
 
✓ Low cost: Transponders are less expensive than LF tags.
 
✓ Large memory: HF tags have larger memory capacity than LF tags.
Following are some of the cons or limitations of HF systems:
 
✓ Environmental tolerance: HF signals are more affected by surrounding 
metals than LF signals are.
 
✓ Orientation matters: The orientation of the tags with respect to the 
reader antenna affects the communication range. For optimum 
communication range, both antennas (on the tag and the reader) should 
be parallel. Having the tag perpendicular to the reader antenna may 
significantly reduce the communication range.
 
✓ Low data transfer rate: HF systems have a low data-transfer rate 
from the tag to the reader compared to passive UHF (discussed in the 
following section).

131
 Chapter 8: Locating at Choke Points
Passive ultra high frequency 
(passive UHF)
Ultra high frequency (UHF) is the RF range from 300 MHz to 3 GHz. A typical 
passive UHF system operates at 915 MHz in the United States and at 868 MHz 
in Europe.
UHF tags boast greater read distances and superior anticollision capabilities 
than HF or LF (refer to the preceding sections), increasing the system’s 
ability to identify a larger number of tags in the field at a given time.
The primary application for UHF tags is supply-chain tracking. The ability to 
identify large numbers of objects as they move through a facility and then 
through the supply chain creates an enormous opportunity for return on 
investment (ROI) in retail, such as reduction of wasted inventory, lost sales 
revenue due to out-of-stock inventory, and the elimination of the human 
factor required for successful bar-code data collection. Additional markets 
with demand for UHF RFID technology include transportation, healthcare, 
and aerospace.
A typical passive UHF system consists of passive UHF tags, an antenna, and 
an interrogator (reader). You achieve locating at choke points by attaching 
passive UHF tags to assets or people and placing interrogators at all critical 
choke points in the facility. The working principle of SAW tags is the following:
 
1. UHF passive tags are passive devices; that is, they don’t operate under 
their own power (no battery). Instead, they obtain power by converting 
the electromagnetic energy emitted by an in-range reader to the DC 
power required to operate the chip.
 
2. The interrogator drives an antenna to send RF waves.
 
3. These waves propagate at the speed of light and induce a voltage in the 
receiving circuit in tags that are in the RF field of the interrogator.
 
4. The voltage is strong enough for the tags to become operational and the 
tag transmits information such as tag ID to the interrogator by reflecting 
(also called backscattering) part of the energy transmitted to it by the 
interrogator.
 
5. The interrogator receives the information about the tag.
 
The distance from tag to interrogator is important because passive tags 
don’t use any traditional transmitter or battery to increase the range of this 
transmission. To understand backscatter, you can consider the analogy 
where if you aim a flashlight at a mirror, that mirror reflects the light. The 
brightness of the reflected light depends in part on the mirror’s distance 
from the flashlight.

132
Part III: Tag-A-Palooza: RTLS Technology Tour 
 
The tags are designed so that they can operate at voltages as low as 200 
microwatts. Although this voltage is enough for the tags to become operational 
and transmit, this voltage isn’t strong enough for tags to send a traditional RF 
transmission. Instead, passive RFID tags communicate back to the interrogator 
via backscatter. In the backscatter technique, the tag reflects the carrier wave 
and changes the load on its antenna (that is, it alters the impedance of the 
antenna match) to reflect back an altered signal that contains information 
corresponding to the data stored on the tag, such as tag ID. The interrogator’s 
job then is to detect this change in the reflected signal. For these reasons, the 
passive tags usually have a short range, are lighter, have smaller form factors, 
and are less expensive. Several schemes are used to encode digital information 
from the tag to the reader (baseband signaling is the most common), but all 
are based on the backscatter technique.
 
Although a good amount of RF energy can be in an RF field, realistic applications 
involve human interaction, and for safety reasons, the amount of energy that 
a reader can emit is limited. Although these limits vary worldwide and at 
different frequencies, current passive RFID systems are functional typically 
from about 3–6 meters.
 
HF is a robust technology that works well for item-management applications 
but fails when read ranges beyond 1 meter are required. UHF targets the 
segment that requires longer read distances. Typical read range is 3–6 meters; 
however, tags with a range of 20 meters can be also created. The range 
depends upon the size and shape of the antenna of the RFID reader as well as 
the tag.
 
The anticollision (simultaneous reads) feature in UHF is achieved through a 
protocol based on bit broadcasting, as opposed to HF protocol, which operates 
based on the time-slot concept. This concept allows a higher number of tags 
to be read simultaneously in the UHF range — typically, 1,500 tags, as opposed 
to 50 tags in HF systems.
Standardization
One of the biggest challenges to the widespread implementation of UHF RFID 
is lack of globally accepted standards and regulations. In today’s global 
economy, cross-continental trade requires goods to be identifiable universally. 
Currently, different frequency designations and safety regulations are in 
place in different regions of the world. In North America, UHF operates in the 
902–928 MHz range; in Europe, UHF works in the 860–868 MHz range, whereas 
Japan uses 950–956 MHz.
However, some standards that have been made regarding RFID technology 
by standardization bodies such as ISO and EPCglobal. EPCglobal (www.
epcglobalinc.org) is focused on international standards for the use of 
RFID as electronic product code (including passive RFID) in the identification 
of many items in the supply chain for companies worldwide:

133
 Chapter 8: Locating at Choke Points
 
✓ EPC Gen2 (EPCglobal UHF Class 1 Generation 2), a standard approved for 
passive RFID in 2004, is the backbone of passive UHF RFID tag standards.
 
✓ ISO/IEC 18000 - Part 6 focuses on parameters for air interface 
communications between 860–960 MHz.
Pros and cons
Although the UHF RFID addresses some shortcomings of the LF and HF RFID, 
primarily in terms of read range and read rates, it has to contend with its own 
limitations and challenges.
Following are some of the pros or benefits of UHF RFID:
 
✓ Good read range: UHF RFID provides good read distances, typically 3–6 
meters.
 
✓ Embedding: Tags can easily be embedded in solid nonmetallic items 
(labels, pallets, cards, and so on).
 
✓ High throughput: High data throughput and a faster anticollision 
scheme facilitate higher read rates (typically 1,500 tags per second).
 
✓ Low cost: UHF transponders cost less than HF transponders due to 
lower memory capacity and a simpler manufacturing process.
Following are some of the cons or limitations of UHF RFID:
 
✓ Lack of global standardization: No global standards and regulations 
exist for frequency.
 
✓ Environmental tolerance: UHF RFID performs poorly around liquids and 
metals. Radio waves lose their ability to travel over distances when they 
encounter water and metal, which limits RFID’s effectiveness in some 
circumstances. Liquid absorbs the radio waves, while metal can detune 
the RFID antenna and the reader antenna. The radio waves also bounce 
off metal under some circumstances, causing interference.
 
✓ Crowded frequency band: The 860–960 MHz range falls within the ISM 
(Industrial, Scientific, Medical) band, making it one of the most crowded 
regions of the spectrum.
 
✓ Longer reads: Longer read distance becomes a disadvantage in 
applications such as banking and access control.
Semipassive ultra high frequency 
(semipassive UHF)
Whereas passive Gen 2 RFID tags gather energy from the reader’s signal to 
wake up the label’s chip and provide the backscatter signal (refer to the 

134
Part III: Tag-A-Palooza: RTLS Technology Tour 
“Passive ultra high frequency (passive UHF)” section, earlier in this chapter), 
battery-assisted Gen 2 RFID tags contain an integrated power source.
This power source eliminates the need to gather energy from the reader and 
reach excitation, which is the primary challenge for passive tags. Typically, 
passive tags backscatter only 10–15 percent of the signal that reaches them. 
On the other hand, battery-assisted passive tags can backscatter about 90 
percent of the energy that they receive.
 
The battery’s main purpose is to either monitor environmental conditions or 
to offer greater range and reliability than passive tags. You should note that 
the battery on the tags isn’t used to generate RF energy in the semipassive 
tag. The battery is used solely for powering the chip and/or environmental 
monitoring.
Standardization
All standards that govern passive UHF RFID govern semipassive UHF also. 
(Refer to the preceding section, “Passive ultra high frequency (passive UHF)” 
for more details.)
Pros and cons
A typical semipassive UHF system is identical to a passive UHF system and 
all the pros and cons as listed in the section, “Passive ultra high frequency 
(passive UHF),” apply. However, due to the additional battery and circuitry, 
semipassive UHF has a few additional pros and cons.
The advantages of semipassive tags include
 
✓ Increased reliability and read rate: Semipassive tags have increased 
reliability and read rate even in the most challenging environments, 
such as those containing liquids and metals.
 
✓ Sensors: Due to its battery-based design, additional sensors such as 
bio-sensors, thermal sensors, and so on, can be added and included in 
semipassive tags.
The disadvantages of semipassive tags include
 
✓ Batteries are required: Semipassive tags have a battery that will need to 
be replaced. However, the battery has a long life, typically 10 years.
 
✓ Higher cost: Because of batteries and additional hardware, the 
semipassive tags are typically higher in cost than passive RFID tags.
 
✓ Large size: Due to the battery, semipassive tags are larger than passive 
tags.

135
 Chapter 8: Locating at Choke Points
Surface acoustic wave (SAW)
Surface acoustic waves are the radio frequency acoustic waves traveling on 
the surface of polished crystals. Billions of SAWs are used annually for 
everyday appliances, such as cell phones, pagers, TVs, and so on.
The working principle of SAW tags is the following:
 
1. A SAW tag uses piezoelectric crystals with reflectors at predetermined 
intervals to represent the tag’s data, as well as input and output SAW 
electrode interdigital transducers (IDT) applied on its work surface.
 
2. The reader transmitter transmits a radio frequency pulse that is 
received by the tag antenna.
 
3. The signal from the tag antenna arrives to the tag’s input IDT.
 
4. The IDT then produces a SAW pulse via the piezoelectric effect.
 
5. The surface acoustic wave travels along the SAW chip surface.
 
6. When the sound waves propagate along the surface of the tag, each 
location reflects part of the signal back. These SAW reflections from 
special reflector patterns produce pulses that encode the tag 
identification number.
 
7. The encoded pulse train travels back to the output IDT.
 
8. The reverse piezoelectric effect produces a signal on the tag antenna.
 
9. The encoded reply signal returns to the reader as a radio wave (and the 
tag ID can be read by variations in amplitude, time, phase, and/or other 
variables). For example, a SAW tag can be excited using a 2.45 GHz signal 
and can report the radio waves with 2.45 GHz as tag center frequency 
as well.
A SAW tag can be read up to 30 meters and located with high accuracy.
Standardization
Interestingly, not much standardization work has been done with SAW, even 
though SAW was invented more than a hundred years ago (Lord Rayleigh 
first described surface acoustic waves in an elastic body in 1885), and more 
than 25 years ago, the possibility of effective interaction between SAW and 
electrons in piezoelectrics and in piezoelectric semiconductor structures was 
invented using interdigital transducers (IDT).
Standardization work is in progress for SAW RFID.

136
Part III: Tag-A-Palooza: RTLS Technology Tour 
Pros and cons
Because SAW tags are truly passive crystal devices, they offer many 
advantages over RFID technologies:
 
✓ Environmental tolerance: These tags can operate in harsh temperature 
conditions (such as less than 77 Kelvin and greater than 450 Kelvin), as 
well as in a hard radiation environment.
 
✓ Better locating: In addition to location, the direction of a tag can be 
determined. This enables high accuracy of order of 2 feet or so.
 
✓ Less interference: Because SAW tags can be read with very short spread 
spectrum signal pulses, many SAW readers can be deployed in the same 
area or work in environments where other users are operating in the 
same frequency band.
 
✓ Automatic temperature measurement: The reading process of SAW 
tags provides tag temperature information. Because the reflectors are 
precisely spaced, small variations in temperature fractionally affect the 
distance between reflectance pulses, which is a difference that can be 
measured.
Because of the nature of design, SAW tags also have some disadvantages 
over RFID technologies:
 
✓ Limited tag ID set: Because the tag ID is built into the tag, the tag ID set 
is very limited.
 
✓ Tag programming: Because the tag ID is built into the tag, the tag 
programming can be done only at the factory.
 
✓ No memory: No read/write memory is available on SAW tags.
A typical example of using SAW tags at choke points is product traceability 
in production processes involving high temperatures, and the use of 
choke-point applications for medical devices that may require sterilization.

Locating at Room Level
In This Chapter
▶ Knowing how room-level locating works
▶ Locating at room level in hospitals and schools
▶ Understanding the underlying technologies
F
or many applications, you need to know the exact location of a person 
or asset; for others, your needs can be satisfied by just knowing what 
room a person or asset is in. This kind of location reporting — in which 
location is reported as an abstract idea of where something is — is called 
symbolic locating. Room-level locating is a prime example of symbolic locating; 
location is reported in reference to the room that a person or asset is in or 
near.
For many places of businesses — such as hospitals, hotels, and schools — a 
room identifier plays a significant role as a location indicator (for example, 
Operation Theater I, Waiting Room, Room #21, Exercise Room, Break Room, 
and so on). When you need to know where a person or asset is, a room 
number (or room name) is much easier to understand and find than a set 
of coordinates. Because of this, room-level (or subroom-level) locating has 
always received special attention from researchers and vendors.
Understanding the Methods 
of Locating at Room Level
You can use an RTLS to determine the room a person or asset is located in 
via a process called locating at room level. You can locate at room level in the 
following ways:
 
✓ Using choke points: You can achieve room-level locating by creating 
choke points at the entrance and exit of every room. Using choke 
points at every entrance and exit, however, requires installing location 
sensors at every door in the building, which can be costly and time-
consuming. Also, this model can’t provide subroom-level locating.

138
Part III: Tag-A-Palooza: RTLS Technology Tour 
 
✓ Using precision-locating methods: You can use any of the methods 
that are capable of pinpointing exact position (such as the ones 
described in Chapters 10 and 11) to derive the room information. For 
example, if you know the floor plan of a building and you know the exact 
3D coordinates where the person is located, you can infer the room 
number. The accuracy of this method depends upon the margin of error 
in position as computed by the precision locating method. Suppose that 
you can locate people inside a building within 5 meters of their actual 
locations. If a person is located fewer than 5 meters from a wall, the 
RTLS may indicate that he or she is in the wrong room or on the wrong 
side of the wall.
 
✓ Using room-locating technologies: You can use technologies that 
have characteristics that are unique to each room. For example, infrared 
can’t penetrate walls, so if you’re using an infrared tag, the infrared 
transmissions can be received only by the infrared receiver in that 
room. By knowing which infrared receiver saw the tag, the room where 
the tag is can be identified.
Applying Room-Level Locating
The following sections show how room-level locating can be applied in 
healthcare facilities and school systems to increase efficiency and ensure 
safety.
Increasing healthcare efficiency
Emergency department crowding is one of the major issues in hospitals and 
health systems that attributes to rising numbers of hours spent in waiting 
rooms, diversion, or bypass. One of the increases to operational efficiency 
can be achieved by understanding patient flow. The patient flow begins when 
a patient is first diagnosed with a particular medical condition, or when the 
patient first enters or is admitted to a healthcare facility; it ends when the 
medical condition has run its course, or when the patient leaves or is 
discharged from the healthcare facility. Between these two points, the 
patient requires a variety of healthcare resources and spends times in 
various rooms or areas, such as the waiting room, nurse aid station, exam 
room, and operating room. A hospital can improve efficiency by monitoring 
patient flow (from room to room) in many ways.
The following list describes a few efficiency improvements that can be 
achieved by adding an RTLS application to monitor (and take actions based 
on) patient flow:

 Chapter 9: Locating at Room Level
 
✓ Emergency department throughput: This RTLS application reduces 
wait times by identifying potential bottlenecks before they occur. It 
also accommodates the high-volume, unscheduled arrival nature of the 
emergency department, as well as patient movement (handoffs) to other 
departments, such as Radiology. A tag is carried by each patient and 
time spent by patients in each room is monitored by an analytic appli-
cation. By monitoring the time patients spend in various rooms, the hos-
pital administration can figure out whether they need to add more staff 
or equipment at different stages in the emergency department.
 
✓ Perioperative services throughput: Perioperative generally refers to the 
phases of surgery that commonly include ward admission, anesthesia, 
surgery, and recovery. By attaching tags to patients, staff, and equipment, 
this RTLS application improves operating-room management and 
quality of patient care by reducing preoperative delays, providing fast 
room turnover, allowing more procedures to be performed every day, 
and so on.
 
✓ Bed management: This RTLS application provides automated bed (or 
room) management to add efficiencies in discharge and admitting, 
enabling better management of in-patient flows by balancing demands 
from the emergency department, operating rooms, and admitting 
physicians. In this application, patients carry tags and in one scenario 
alerts are automatically sent to maintenance for cleaning whenever a 
patient leaves a room.
Staying safe at school
Rooms are also focal points in schools; at any time, teachers and students 
usually are present in rooms. With increasing violence in schools, room-level 
locating enables quick response by security to the right room to ensure the 
safety of staff members and students.
The following list provides examples of RTLS applications that can help 
ensure the safety of students and teachers in a school:
 
✓ Teacher alert: In this RTLS application, each teacher carries a call 
button tag and it enables teachers to request assistance in the room by 
pressing the call-button tag.
 
✓ Student check: In this RTLS application, all students carry tags and 
presence of students in a specific room can be identified in case 
violence breaks out.

Knowing the Underlying Technologies
You may be able to locate at room level using choke point technologies (as 
discussed on Chapter 8) or any of the precision locating technologies (as 
described in Chapters 10 and 11). However, the three technologies that focus 
primarily on room-level locating are
 
✓ Infrared
 
✓ Ultrasound
 
✓ Powerline positioning
I discuss these technologies in the following sections.
 
For some applications, near-room accuracy may be good enough for 
room-level locating. And, in some applications, you may be willing to 
sacrifice room-level locating because your assets or personnel aren’t always 
located in rooms. Wheelchairs in a hospital, for example, could be in rooms 
or in large open areas such as parking lots and parking garages, so room-level 
locating of those assets may not be a practical choice.
Using infrared
Infrared (IR) radiation is electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength that’s 
longer than that of visible light but shorter than that of microwaves and 
terahertz radiation, as illustrated in Figure 9-1. You can’t see infrared light. 
Because infrared light (like visible light) doesn’t go through opaque barriers 
and reflects off the ceiling, walls, and most other objects in a typical room 
or enclosure, it can be used for room-level locating. For example, with an IR 
transmitting tag, the IR transmissions can be received only by the IR receiver 
in that room and by knowing which IR receiver saw the tag, the room where 
the tag is can be identified.
Other uses for IR
IR is used in many other applications. Night-
vision equipment uses IR — when there 
is insufficient visible light, the radiation is 
detected and turned into an image where 
hotter objects show up brighter. Remote 
temperature-sensing equipment determines the 
temperature of objects, such as in a sauna. IR is 
also used in airports to remove ice from the wings 
of aircraft (de-icing). IR is used in short-range 
communication among computer peripherals 
and PDAs.

IR transmissions can be characterized as either of two main types:
 
✓ Direct IR: Direct infrared is characterized principally by the need for 
a line of sight (LOS) between the transmitting and receiving devices. 
Direct IR is point-to-point and (typically) one-to-one communication. 
Most consumer electronics, from camcorders to stereo equipment, 
include infrared remote controls. Video and audio apparatus, com-
puters, and modern lighting installations often operate on infrared 
remote controls as well.
 
✓ Diffused IR: A diffused infrared device floods the room with an IR signal 
and then uses the reflections from the ceiling, walls, floors, and other 
natural surfaces to maintain robust optical communication. Diffused 
IR allows many-to-many connections and can be unidirectional or bidi-
rectional. Diffused IR can create communication links at distances of 10 
meters (30 feet) or more, depending on the emitted optical power.
Applying infrared technology to an RTLS
In IR for an RTLS, diffused infrared is typically used because it eliminates 
the need for LOS (line of sight) with the room locator (infrared receivers) to 
receive the IR signal from tags. Diffused IR provides exceptional robustness 
against shadowing and behaves like radio-frequency (RF) waves within the 
enclosure in which they operate. People walking around don’t interfere with 
the ongoing diffused IR communication; neither do obstructions in the room. 
See Figure 9-2.
The working principle of an IR system is as follows:
 
1. IR receivers are installed in rooms, hallways, and (usually) ceilings.
 
2. IR tags worn by people or attached to equipment emit IR signals 
containing unique tag ID codes. Typically, the IR receivers used are 
highly sensitive because only a small part of the transmitted signal 
power from the tag reaches the receiver due to signal absorption and 
multiple reflections, which cause signal attenuation.

3. The IR receivers convert and forward the received tag transmissions 
(information such as tag ID) to the location engine using a wireless or 
wired local area network (LAN), thereby giving the application the 
location of that asset or person.
If multiple receivers receive the signal from a tag, the location engine can use 
basic triangulation (based on signal strength) to compute the location of the 
tag. Because the infrared beam doesn’t go very far, the margin of error is low.
 
Because IR can’t penetrate walls and ceilings and it reflects off surfaces, IR 
enables accurate room-level locating. Appropriate placement of IR receivers 
also provides subroom-level accuracy and can be focused to 12-inch accuracy.

143
 Chapter 9: Locating at Room Level
Standardization
Although there are many standards and specifications for the short-range 
exchange of data over IR (for uses such as personal area networks, PANs), 
little work is done for standardization of using IR for RTLS purposes and 
many implementations are closed-loop — that is, tags and receivers must be 
purchased from the same vendor.
Pros and cons
Following are some of the benefits or pros of IR-based RTLS solutions:
 
✓ Penetration: Because infrared signals don’t penetrate walls and other 
architectural elements, a tag’s signal is received only within one room.
 
✓ Low cost: Infrared enables you to develop cost-effective RTLS solutions.
 
✓ No regulations: Infrared operates on a virtually unlimited, unregulated, 
optical bandwidth, so no need exists for country or state frequency 
allocations or any special labeling.
 
✓ Safety: Unlike the high RF carrier frequencies like those used by cellular 
and cordless phones, which have suspected health hazards, infrared is 
a fairly safe technology. Infrared uses the optical spectrum medium to 
achieve its communication and doesn’t penetrate body tissues.
 
✓ High data rates: Infrared can achieve very high data rates that allow you 
to use a large number of tags or store a large amount of data in the tags.
 
✓ Security: Infrared light doesn’t go through walls, so it’s nearly impossible 
for an unauthorized person outside the physical controlled area of the 
facility to eavesdrop on the system. This situation also makes denial-
of-service attacks difficult to stage.
 
✓ No frequency coordination: IR doesn’t penetrate walls and therefore 
doesn’t interfere with other devices in adjoining rooms. Also, it isn’t 
susceptible to RF interference. No frequency coordination is required, as 
with RF systems. Receivers in adjacent rooms could be using the same 
IR characteristics.
Following are some of the limitations or cons of infrared-based RTLS solutions:
 
✓ Limited range: Infrared has an effective range of several meters, which 
limits cell sizes to small or medium-size rooms. In a large area, the 
system needs multiple infrared location sensors (at least one in each 
room and every few meters in hallways) to pick up the signals from tags, 
which could make the system expensive to install.
 
✓ No standardization: Due to the lack of standards or lack of conformance 
with standards, most infrared solutions are proprietary, meaning that 
the tags and receivers must be purchased from the same vendor.

144
Part III: Tag-A-Palooza: RTLS Technology Tour 
 
✓ Interference: Following are some circumstances that affect the ability of 
the infrared sensors to accurately locate tags:
 
• Interference from other IR sources can come from remote controls 
or audio systems (these broadcast an IR signal continuously).
 
• Interference can also be caused by light sources such as the ballasts 
of fluorescent lighting fixtures. One way to limit interference is to 
use higher IR carrier frequencies, into the MHz region. Generally, 
infrared remote controls use a 32–40 kHz modulated square wave 
for communication.
 
 Direct sunlight also affects the ability of an infrared sensor to 
locate tags. For this reason, an infrared solution works best 
indoors, in areas that don’t have high-frequency lights or get 
bright, direct sunlight.
 
• The infrared windows on the transmitter and receiver have to 
remain open to the wireless air medium. If an object covers the 
infrared windows, the link breaks. For tags worn by people, opacity 
may become an issue if the tags get obstructed by clothes or hair.
 
• Dark colors such as gray, blue, and black shorten the link’s range. 
Such colors absorb infrared, so the signal can’t bounce efficiently 
from the transmitter to the receiver.
 
• Plasma TVs emit strong RF and infrared signals. Unfortunately, 
most plasma TVs don’t employ filters that filter out the emitted 
infrared signal, which may affect the infrared link quality.
Understanding ultrasound
Ultrasound is sound at a frequency greater than the upper limit of human 
hearing. Although this limit varies from person to person, it is approximately 
20 kHz (20,000 Hz) in healthy young adults; thus, 20 kHz serves as a useful 
lower limit in describing ultrasound. Figure 9-3 shows where ultrasound fits 
in the spectrum of wavelengths.

 Chapter 9: Locating at Room Level
Because ultrasound waves can’t penetrate walls, they can be used for 
room-level locating. For example, if there is an ultrasound transmitting tag, 
the ultrasounds can be heard only by the ultrasound receiver in that room. 
By knowing which ultrasound receiver saw the tag, the room where the tag is 
can be identified.
Applying ultrasound to an RTLS
The working principle of an ultrasound-based RTLS is as follows:
 
1. Receivers (microphones) are placed in rooms where the tracking is to 
be done.
 
2. Tags attached to the objects or people to be tracked transmit their 
unique identification signals using ultrasound waves. As in any other 
RTLS system, the tag signals are transmitted at user-defined time 
intervals or conditions such as detection of motion or on-demand, such 
when a user presses the call button on a tag.
 
3. When ultrasound signals, which have short wavelengths, are emitted, 
the walls and doors confine the signals to that room.
 
4. The receivers receive the transmitted ultrasound signals from a tag and 
transmit the signals in digital format to the location engine by using the 
existing wired or wireless LAN, giving the application the location of that 
asset or person, as illustrated in Figure 9-4.
 
Ultrasound waves provide accurate room-level locating. By fine-tuning the 
receivers for direction, you can define subroom-level location zones, and by 
installing multiple receivers, you can obtain inch-level accuracy in three 
dimensions.
Other uses for ultrasound
Ultrasound is used in many fields, typically to 
penetrate a medium and measure the pattern 
of reflection (often called a reflection signature) 
or to supply focused energy. The reflection 
signature can reveal details about the inner 
structure of the medium. The best-known 
application of this technique is its use in 
sonography to produce pictures of fetuses in 
the womb.
Another common use of ultrasound is in 
range finding; this use is also called SONAR 
(sound navigation and ranging). By measuring 
the difference in time between the pulse being 
transmitted and the echo being received, it 
is possible to determine how far away an 
object is. This method is capable of easily 
and rapidly measuring the layout of rooms.

Standardization
Little work has been done for standardization of using ultrasound for RTLS 
purposes as of this writing. Many implementations are closed-loop — that is, 
the tags and receivers must be purchased from the same vendor.
Pros and cons
Following are some of the benefits or pros of ultrasound for an RTLS:
 
✓ Penetration: Ultrasound signals don’t penetrate walls; therefore, an 
ultrasound RTLS guarantees virtually failproof room-level location 
accuracy. In addition, you can create subroom-level location zones, and 
by installing multiple receivers, you can obtain inch-level accuracy in 
three dimensions.
 
✓ Low cost: Because the receiver is just a microphone, ultrasound enables 
you to develop a cost-effective RTLS solution.

147
 Chapter 9: Locating at Room Level
 
✓ Security: The security of an ultrasound system is very high, making it 
virtually impossible to eavesdrop on the communications link from 
outside the premises where the system is installed.
 
✓ No frequency coordination: Ultrasound waves don’t penetrate walls 
or interfere with other devices in adjoining rooms, including sensitive 
equipment that might be disturbed by electromagnetic waves. Also, 
ultrasound waves are mechanical waves, and therefore, immune to 
interference. No frequency coordination is required, as with RF systems. 
Receivers in adjacent rooms could be using the same ultrasound 
characteristics.
 
✓ No line of sight: Ultrasound doesn’t require LOS between the tag and 
the receiver, making it possible to track objects that are hidden or 
located in drawers or filing cabinets.
Following are some of the limitations or cons of ultrasound for an RTLS:
 
✓ No global regulations: Several countries have regulations on acceptable 
values of ultrasound in air, most of which rely on a statement of the 
International Radiation Protection Association (IRPA) from 1984. The 
values apply to continuous exposure of workers during an eight-hour 
working day. The statement recommends that people shouldn’t ex-
perience sound pressure level higher than 75 decibels (dB) at 20 kHz 
or 110 dB at ultrasonic frequencies above 25 kHz without taking pre-
cautions. You should check sound-pressure levels with your ultrasound 
solution vendor.
 
✓ Possible safety concerns: As currently used in the medical environment, 
ultrasound poses no known risks to patients. The ear is considered to 
be the most ultrasound-sensitive organ, but sound-pressure levels below 
120 dB at ultrasonic frequencies haven’t been demonstrated to cause 
hearing losses. However, exposure to airborne ultrasound levels greater 
than approximately 155 dB results in acute harmful effects. The knowledge 
regarding unwanted physical effect of airborne ultrasound is quite 
sparse. However, symptoms such as nausea, tinnitus, headaches, and 
fatigue have been reported from industrial workers as a result of ultra-
sound stress. Another effect of ultrasound is called the hypersonic effect, 
the phenomenon reported in some scientific studies which demonstrate 
that although humans can’t consciously hear sounds at frequencies 
above approximately 20 kHz, the presence or absence of those frequen-
cies has a measurable effect on their psychological reactions.
 
✓ Limited range: Ultrasound has an effective range of several meters, 
which limits cell sizes (size of the area where a tag can be actually heard 
by an ultrasound receiver) to small or medium-size rooms. In a large 
area, the system needs multiple ultrasound location sensors (at least 
one in each room and every few meters in hallways) to pick up the 
signals from tags, which could make the system expensive to install.

148
Part III: Tag-A-Palooza: RTLS Technology Tour 
 
✓ Multipath: Ultrasonic reception suffers from severe multipath effects 
caused by reflections from walls and other objects, and these are orders 
of magnitude longer in time than RF multipath because of the relatively 
long propagation time for sound waves in air.
 
✓ Interference: Quite a few ultrasound sources exist in different environ-
ments that can be sources of interference, such as ultrasound-assisted 
dental-cleaning equipment. Also, because you can’t hear ultrasound, you 
may not be able to hear all sounds that are causing interference to your 
ultrasound RTLS, so you need to have processes in place to monitor the 
interference.
 
✓ No standardization: Due to the lack of standards or the lack of conform-
ance with standards, most ultrasound solutions are proprietary, mean-
ing that the tags and receivers must be purchased from the same 
vendor.
Understanding powerline positioning
Powerline communication is a system for carrying data on a conductor; 
this system is also used for electric-power transmission. All powerline 
communications systems operate by impressing a modulated carrier signal 
on the wiring system. Because the characteristics (such as amplitude of the 
signal) of carrier signals on the wires can be detected by using signal detec-
tors and the pattern depends upon the distance of the signal detector from 
the source (introducing carrier signal on the wire), powerline communication 
can be used for an RTLS. Using powerline communication for positioning is 
attractive because it eliminates the need to install dedicated network cabling.
Applying powerline positioning to an RTLS
The RTLS system works based on a popular technique used to locate wires 
in a wall or underground. An electrician or utility worker who uses this 
technique connects an exposed end of the wire to a tone generator that 
generates a frequency range of 10–500 kHz and locates the hidden wire by 
using a handheld inductive tone detector.
In the powerline RTLS system, the working principle can be described as 
follows:
 
1. No location sensors are used. Instead, a few tone generators are 
connected to electrical outlets in the peripheral areas of the facility.
 
2. All tone generators continually emit their signals over the powerline.

149
 Chapter 9: Locating at Room Level
 
3. The signals from these tone generators emanate from those outlets 
to the rest of the facility. The power of the tone is set so that even if it 
attenuates (weakens), it still reaches the opposite end (or as far as pos-
sible) of the facility.
 
4. Because the electrical wiring has no fixed pattern in the facilities, each 
area in the facility has unique signal characteristics (such as amplitude, 
phase, and so on). These characteristics (often called a signature or 
fingerprint) are recorded beforehand as part of a site survey (or scene 
analysis, as described in Chapter 2) and made available to the location 
engine. Because wiring in a building doesn’t change frequently, this fin-
gerprint remains stable for a long time.
 
5. Tags equipped with specially tuned tone detectors sense these signals 
in the building and relay that information to the location engine over a 
wireless network (such as Wi-Fi). The detected signal levels provide a 
distinctive fingerprint resulting from the density of electrical wiring at 
the given location. See Figure 9-5.
 
6. The location engine compares the signal levels received from the tag 
against the prerecorded database and returns the location based on the 
best match.
 
Because powerline positioning is based on fingerprints, the location accuracy 
depends upon the number of fingerprints and the algorithms to find the best 
match.
Standardization
As of this writing, little work has been done for standardization of using 
powerline positioning for RTLS purposes and many implementations are 
closed-loop — that is, tags and receivers must be purchased from the same 
vendor.
Powerline communication
Different types of powerline communication 
use different frequency bands, depending 
on the signal transmission characteristics of 
the wiring. Because the power wiring system 
was originally intended for transmission of AC 
power, the power wire circuits have a limited 
ability to carry higher frequencies. This ability 
to carry higher frequencies is a limiting factor 
for powerline communications.
Data rates over a powerline communication 
system vary widely. Low-frequency (about 
100–200 kHz) carriers on high-voltage transmis-
sion lines may achieve a net data rate of a few 
hundred bits per second, but these circuits may 
be miles long.

1   Two or more tone generator modules are connected to power outlets,

2   Tags (tone detectors) sense the RF signals in the building and
     send the signal information to location engine via Wi-Fi or some
     other data network.
3   The location engine software has the ﬁngerprint (scene analysis) data
     of what the signals look like in different parts of the building. Due to
     the unique nature of wiring, the ﬁngerprint is unique in different  rooms 
     and thereby the location engine determines room-level location.

Pros and cons
Following are some of the benefits or pros of using powerline positioning for 
an RTLS:
 
✓ Minimal infrastructure: Systems based on powerline communication 
need very limited infrastructure additions and no cabling.
 
✓ Low cost: The infrastructure consists of only a few inexpensive tone 
generators.

151
 Chapter 9: Locating at Room Level
Following are some of the limitations or cons of using powerline positioning 
for an RTLS:
 
✓ Need for fingerprinting: Because the system is based on fingerprinting, 
extensive fingerprinting needs to be done as part of the setup process.
 
✓ RF-based: Because powerline positioning uses low-frequency RF (radio 
frequency) signals, it has the same concerns as for any LF RTLS system.
 
✓ Interference: Following are some things that affect the ability of the 
location engine to accurately locate tags:
 
• Interference from nearby systems can cause signal degradation, 
and as a result, the fingerprint sent by the tag may not be accurate.
 
• Devices such as relays, transistors, and rectifiers create noise 
in their respective systems, increasing the likelihood of signal 
degradation.
 
• Transformers and AC-DC converters attenuate the input frequency 
signal almost completely. Bypass devices are necessary to enable 
the signal to be passed on to the receiving node. A bypass device 
may consist of three stages: a filter in series with a protection 
stage and coupler, placed in parallel with the passive device.

Precision Locating with 
Wide Area Coverage
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding wide area coverage
▶ Exploring the underlying technologies 
P
recision locating means being able to identify the exact location of an 
asset or a person. You can precisely locate people or assets in many 
ways. You can use absolute coordinates such as latitude, longitude, and alti-
tude (for example, a person is located at N27° 10' 0 N, E78° 2' 60 when visit-
ing the Taj Mahal); or you can use relative coordinates, such as the distance 
in three dimensions from a fixed reference point (for example, the security 
guard is standing at 10 feet south of the main entrance of the building). You 
also can use relative coordinates such as distance in three dimensions from a 
mobile reference point. You can measure that my car is located 45 feet to the 
left of me, for example.
Currently, many different RTLS technologies can be used to get precise loca-
tion information. These technologies can be grouped into two categories 
based on their area of service (also called as area of coverage). The technolo-
gies that support wide area coverage cover a broad area, so the tags can be 
located in areas that cross metropolitan, regional, or national boundaries. 
GPS covers the world, for example. The technologies that support local area 
coverage cover localized areas, so the tags can be located within the smaller 
areas such as a room, building, campus, or specific metropolitan area.
In this chapter, I discuss precision locating technologies that support wide 
area coverage.

154
Part III: Tag-A-Palooza: RTLS Technology Tour 
Understanding Wide Area Coverage
The concept of locating a tag in a wide area is often desirable because you 
can locate assets or people even if they move from one facility to another, 
for example. Wide area coverage also implies locating tags in outdoor, urban, 
and even indoor environments, but typically the technologies that support 
wide area coverage need some assistance (or require use of precision locat-
ing technologies that support local area coverage) to provide high accuracy 
in local areas such as within a room, building, campus, or specific metropoli-
tan area. The technologies that support local area coverage are discussed in 
Chapter 11.
Irrespective of the fact that a precision locating system supports wide area 
coverage or local area coverage, the precision locating systems report loca-
tion in terms of distance as the accuracy level and a percentage as the preci-
sion. Some systems that use Global Positioning System (GPS) technology can 
locate tag positions within 3 meters for approximately 95 percent of measure-
ments. In this example, the distance of 3 meters denotes the accuracy level, 
or grain size, of the position information GPS can provide; the percentage, 95, 
denotes precision, or how often you can expect to get that accuracy.
This grain size of locating is often used to determine how well a locating 
system will work for a particular application. GPS tags may suffice for species 
biologists who are concerned with the position of a migrating whale pod to a 
precision of 1 square mile, for example. A personal location system for home 
or office applications, however, may need enough accuracy to answer the 
query “Which room was I in around noon?” but not “Where, to the nearest 
cubic inch, was my left thumb at 12:00:46 p.m.?”
Comparing accuracy level and precision
When you’re evaluating different RTLS technol-
ogies for your application, you must compare 
the accuracy level and precision they can pro-
vide while operating in a similar environment. 
To understand the accuracy level and precision 
effectively, you should assess the error distribu-
tion each system incurs when locating objects 
and the most common worst-case ways that 
tags will be used in your application (for exam-
ple, the accuracy level and precision value in 
scenarios where tags could be completely sub-
mersed in water). Another aspect you want to 
compare is the number of location sensors (that 
is, how densely packed location sensors must 
be) to achieve the desired accuracy level and 
precision.

If locating systems were accurate with 100 percent probability, life would be 
good indeed. The practical implications (such as the ability to install an unlim-
ited number of location sensors), however, prohibit you from installing a 
locating system that gives maximum accuracy with 100 percent probability.
Exploring the Underlying Technologies
Although locating in wide areas has always received special attention from 
researchers, the commercial availability of GPS to civilians and increased ter-
rorism have spurred a flurry of activity in this field. The desire for a number 
of location identification applications that enable locating in wide area cover-
age has been growing dramatically.
Currently, many different RTLS technologies besides GPS (such as cellular) 
can be used to locate in wide areas. Because each of these technologies is 
designed for a specific application or a group of applications, these technolo-
gies differ in their capacity to locate:

156
Part III: Tag-A-Palooza: RTLS Technology Tour 
 
✓ Some technologies work well outdoors; others are tailor-made for the 
in-building environment.
 
✓ Location accuracy of some technologies is in the order of 1 centimeter 
and for others it is 200 meters.
 
✓ Some technologies work well for locating underground; others work like 
magic for locating in water.
 
✓ Some technologies are multipurpose; the sole purpose of others is locat-
ing. Cellular, for example, can also be used for data, video, voice, and so 
on, but GPS provides only location information.
Table 10-2 lists the technologies discussed in this chapter, along with typical 
level of positioning accuracy using those technologies.

Technological evolution is a process where the emergence of the first technol-
ogy results in newer species of the same technology or newer technologies. 
What this means is that your vendor may offer you a slight variation, combina-
tion, or completely new technology that isn’t described in this chapter. You 
should understand how your vendor makes use of the specific technology 
because that can affect the capacity of the RTLS to locate.
The following sections identify the strengths and limitations of technologies 
that support wide area coverage. Chapter 11 covers RTLS technologies that 
support locating within the local area.
Using satellite navigation systems
A satellite navigation system — also called a Global Navigation Satellite 
System (GNSS) — can locate people or assets with global coverage. Satellite 
navigation systems consist of satellites that send radio signals from space 
and tags that are electronic receivers. In simple terms, the tags (receiv-
ers) locate four or more of these satellites, figure out the distance to each 
satellite, and use this information to deduce their own location (longitude, 
latitude, and altitude) by using multilateration. Multilateration is very similar 

157
 Chapter 10: Precision Locating with Wide Area Coverage
to trilateration (discussed in Chapter 2). In multilateration, three location 
sensors are used for computing location and additional location sensors are 
used to verify and/or adjust the accuracy of result.
 
As of 2007, the United States’ NAVSTAR GPS system is the only fully opera-
tional satellite navigation system. Due to its popularity, people sometimes 
refer to any satellite navigation system as GPS. Other countries, however, are 
developing satellite navigation systems of their own.
GPS receivers are available as standalone devices that enable personal 
navigation, tags that can be attached to assets, and wearable items (such as 
watches); these receivers are also embedded in personal digital assistant 
(PDA) devices, phones, and computers.
Following are a few positioning applications that make use of GPS:
 
✓ Navigation: Navigation applications provide personal navigation infor-
mation for drivers, hikers, mariners, pilots of medical evacuation heli-
copters, and so on. For example tags (GPS receivers) are connected to 
small computers (that can display and/or vocalize) and provide street 
navigation for the traveler.
 
✓ Construction fleet management: In these applications, tags are attached 
to construction vehicles, equipment, machinery, and optionally, carried 
by people. These applications potentially reduce unauthorized vehicle use 
(by knowing the location of the vehicle and person and generating alerts 
whenever the vehicle is in an unauthorized area or is moving without any 
authorized person nearby), improve vehicle use by eliminating unneces-
sary idle time (by fast locating of equipment), eliminating dispatcher inac-
curacies (by exactly knowing the location of vehicles), and so on.
 
✓ Yard management: These applications can improve yard-operation 
efficiency. For example, locating the tagged containers faster can help 
reduce charges customers have to pay for excess time the containers 
or cargo is in care of the yard authority (called demurrage charges) or 
customer (called detention charges); it can help in preventing spoilage or 
loss of trailer contents, as well as eliminate manual yard checks (locate 
automatically). It can also enable monitoring the performance of the 
equipment, the facility, and crew members.
 
✓ Tracking of Alzheimer’s patients: Wandering is one of the most frighten-
ing symptoms of advancing dementia, and the Alzheimer’s Association 
estimates that nearly 60 percent of patients will develop this symptom. 
In this application, an Alzheimer’s patient wears a tracking GPS device (a 
GPS receiver with a back-end network radio such as cellular embedded in 
a watch, for example). In the scenario when the patient wanders off, the 
rescue teams can communicate with the tracking GPS device (using the 
back-end network radio) and get information about the absolute coordi-
nates of the patient.

How satellite navigation systems work
NAVSTAR GPS is the only fully functional satellite navigation system as of this 
writing. In this section, I explain the working principle of GPS (see Figure 10-1).
 
1. A constellation of satellites (24 or more operational, plus 3 active 
spares) orbits the Earth every 12 hours about 20,000 kilometers above 
the Earth’s surface. The constellation of these satellites is such that a 
GPS user can lock onto 5–11 satellites from any point on the Earth.
 
Figure 10-1: 
GPS uses 
satellites, 
tracking 
stations, 
and GPS 
receivers.
 
Tag (GPS receiver) locks in with 
four satellites.
As the signal travels from the
satellite to the GPS receiver, it gets
delayed (speed of light).
All satellites are transmitting signals 
and their clocks are very accurate 
and synchronized.

The GPS receiver computes the time it
takes for signals to travel from satellites to
the receiver, converts this to distance and 
does multilateration.

159
 Chapter 10: Precision Locating with Wide Area Coverage
 
2. These satellites transmit a code (called a ranging signal) on two frequen-
cies in the microwave part of the radio spectrum — 1575.42 MHz (L1 
frequency) and 1227.60 MHz (L2 frequency). (Only L1 is available for 
civilian use. The U.S. military can use L1 or L2.)
 
3. The tags (GPS receivers) listen for the signals from the satellites. The 
GPS receivers are time-synchronized with the satellites and run the 
same code.
 
4. The signal takes some time to reach the GPS receiver from the satellite.
 
5. Because the GPS receivers are time-synchronized with the satellite 
clock, a GPS receiver can compute the time it takes for the signal to 
travel from the satellite to the GPS receiver. The distance between the 
satellite and a GPS receiver is equal to the time it takes for the radio 
signal to travel from the satellite to the GPS receiver, multiplied by the 
speed of the radio signal (the speed of light).
 
6. By using multilateration with knowledge of distance from four or more 
satellites, the GPS receiver computes its own position.
Considering GPS safety and security
The GPS signal is weak. Measured at the sur-
face of the Earth, GPS signal strength is about 
–160 dBw (1 × 10–16 watts), which is roughly 
equivalent to viewing a 25-watt light bulb from a 
distance of 10,000 miles. With the present state 
of scientific knowledge, it is considered to be 
safe (that is, nonhazardous) for people irrespec-
tive of continuous or intermittent exposure.
But because the GPS signal modulation and fre-
quency spectrum are known to the public, GPS 
is vulnerable to the following types of attacks:
 ✓ Blocking: Because the signal is weak, 
someone can easily block it by destroying 
or shielding the GPS receiver’s antenna.
 ✓ Jamming: Because the GPS signal modula-
tion and frequency spectrum are known to 
the public, jammers can concentrate all the 
power within the GPS spectrum to corrupt 
the signals. Consequently, jammers of modest 
power could effectively jam the GPS signal 
over substantial ranges. Jamming could be 
unintentional, however; simple interference 
with the GPS signal could cause loss of the 
lock that GPS receivers need.
 ✓ Spoofing: Blocking and jamming aren’t 
the greatest security risks, because a GPS 
receiver is fully aware when it isn’t receiv-
ing the GPS signals it needs to determine 
position and time. A more pernicious attack, 
known as spoofing, involves feeding the 
GPS receiver fake GPS signals so that the 
receiver believes that it’s located some-
where else in space and time. Spoofing 
is more sinister than jamming because it 
is surreptitious. In spoofing, the intended 
target doesn’t know that the signal received 
from a GPS unit is wrong.

160
Part III: Tag-A-Palooza: RTLS Technology Tour 
In addition to satellites and GPS receivers, a control segment that consists of 
tracking stations is located around the world to maintain GPS. These stations 
monitor and measure signals from the satellites to compute precise orbital 
data (called ephemeris) and satellite clock corrections for each satellite. The 
master control station uploads ephemeris and clock data to the satellites. 
Then the satellites send subsets of the orbital ephemeris data to GPS receiv-
ers over radio signals so that the receivers can compute accurate locations.
For most GPS-based RTLS solutions, another back-end network technology — 
wireless radio, such as Wi-Fi, WiMAX, or cellular — is typically added to the 
tags. This technology is used to forward the location of the receiver to the 
location engine (or application) on demand or periodically.
 
GPS doesn’t work indoors, but it’s a clear and effective technology for outdoor 
locating with positioning accuracy from a centimeter to a few meters.
Pros and cons
GPS offers an excellent solution for accurate positioning nearly anywhere on 
Earth, 24 hours a day, and under any weather conditions.
Here are some of the advantages of GPS:
 
✓ Low recurring cost: Users aren’t charged for using GPS signals from the 
satellites.
 
✓ High accuracy: The positioning accuracy of GPS can vary from less than 
a centimeter to a few meters.
 
✓ Privacy: Because the tags compute their position, the information about 
location of a particular tag is available only to that tag.
 
✓ Highly scalable: Because the tags (GPS receivers) compute their own 
locations, no scalability issue applies for applications.
Nevertheless, despite the wide use of GPS, it has several limitations:
 
✓ Security: GPS is susceptible to attacks such as jamming, blocking, and 
spoofing.
 
✓ Might need a back-end network: Because the GPS receivers compute 
their locations, if the location of tag is needed by another application, 
it might need to have another networking technology (called the back-
end network) built into the receivers. This back-end network technology 
sends the location (as determined by the tag) to the location engine and 
application. Another side effect is that if there are coverage holes (a lack 
of coverage in some areas) in the back-end network, the GPS tags can’t 
be located by the application.

161
 Chapter 10: Precision Locating with Wide Area Coverage
 
✓ Line of sight requirement: A GPS receiver has to lock onto at least four 
satellites to compute its location, but it can achieve lock only when it 
has clear lines of sight to those satellites. Because satellite signals can’t 
penetrate solid or dense objects (such as mountains, jungles with thick 
branches and leaves, bridges, and buildings), a GPS receiver in such an 
environment may fail to locate itself.
 
✓ Urban canyons: Receivers may not be able to locate themselves in urban 
areas that are lined with skyscrapers (referred to as urban canyons), 
where signals can be obstructed for extended periods or continuously 
unavailable.
 
✓ Initial delay in computing location: GPS can require a long time to lock 
onto its first satellite. A traditional GPS receiver requires from 30 sec-
onds to several minutes to lock onto and track each satellite, depending 
on how much information it gathered previously. This time delay can be 
a major issue.
 
✓ Interference: The weak GPS signal poses tremendous design challenges, 
especially when another wireless (back-end network) technology is also 
required on the same device — avoiding interference from the other 
wireless signal becomes a design issue.
 
✓ High battery use: GPS receivers are relatively power-intensive, making 
them unsuitable for long-term battery-based use.
GPS locating accuracy also can be affected by the following situations:
 
✓ Satellite clock errors: Errors in satellite ephemeris (the position of a sat-
ellite as predicted and set by control stations) result in receivers com-
puting incorrect locations. (Receivers use satellite ephemeris along with 
time of travel of the signal to compute their own locations.) An error of 
this type is on the order of 2 to 3 meters.
 
✓ Signal propagation error: Naturally occurring variations in the Earth’s 
atmosphere affect satellite signals by changing the speed at which they 
travel, which can cause time-to-travel errors.
 
✓ Receiver quality: Receiver clock quality and measurement noise can 
result in the receiver’s providing inaccurate information.
Improvising GPS-based RTLS
Because conventional GPS has difficulty providing reliable positions when 
signal conditions are poor or when the receivers can’t download informa-
tion from the GPS satellites (rendering the receiver unable to function until 
a clear signal can be received continuously for up to one minute), several 
approaches have been taken to improve GPS location accuracy:

162
Part III: Tag-A-Palooza: RTLS Technology Tour 
 
✓ Indoor GPS: Indoor GPS refers to locating in a wide area by using regular 
GPS and adding pseudolites — devices that act as virtual satellites. The 
pseudolites broadcast GPS-like signals to overcome limitations such as 
signal blockage for urban and indoor environments. Several pseudolites 
can be used and sub-meter accuracy can be achieved in indoor and 
urban canyon environments.
 
✓ Differential GPS (D-GPS): A differential GPS system makes use of dif-
ferential corrections from ground-based or satellite-based augmentation 
systems to the GPS receiver. The ground-based or satellite-based aug-
mentation systems basically consist of GPS signal monitors that listen to 
signals and send differential corrections to the GPS receiver. The correc-
tion message from ground-based monitors is normally transmitted in the 
300 kHz frequency band and from satellite-based monitors is normally 
broadcasted in the L1 frequency band. By using these corrections, it 
minimizes the error contribution from the atmosphere propagation, 
satellite clock error, and ephemeris error so that sub-meter accuracy 
can be obtained. Note that D-GPS systems are heavily dependent on the 
communication between the GPS receiver and the augmentation system 
monitors.
 
✓ Assisted GPS (A-GPS): Assisted GPS refers to locating in a wide area by 
using regular GPS and an assistance server. A typical GPS receiver that 
uses A-GPS makes use of cellular, WiMAX, or some other data connec-
tion to contact the assistance server. With assistance, the GPS receiver 
can operate more quickly and efficiently because the tasks originally 
handled by the receiver are shared.
 
 For example, in the case of A-GPS where cellular network is used to 
assist in locating, the working principle can be described as follows:
 
1. The A-GPS tag has a GPS receiver as well as a cellular radio (cell 
phone).
 
2. The assistance server can determine the location of tag roughly by 
knowing the location of cell tower to which the tag (GPS receiver 
and cell phone) is connected on the cellular network.
 
3. The assistance server can supply the orbital data for the GPS satel-
lites to the tag’s cell phone, enabling the tag’s GPS receiver to lock 
to the satellites.
 
4. If the tag doesn’t have a good signal from the GPS, it can pass on 
the fragmentary signals received from satellites to the assistance 
server that in turn can compute the location of tag.
 
 Because A-GPS tags don’t need to search for and decode signals from 
each available satellite, they improve initial delay in locking to the four 
satellites and this in turn also improves the battery life of the A-GPS tag. 
In addition, it reduces the amount of CPU and programming required on 

163
 Chapter 10: Precision Locating with Wide Area Coverage
the A-GPS tag because most of the work is offloaded onto the assistance 
server. A-GPS enables increased accuracy and availability, especially in 
urban and indoor environments. Because A-GPS is primarily designed 
for urban and indoor environments, it is difficult to give exact perfor-
mance measures. However, with A-GPS the performance should be good 
enough to determine which street the car is traveling on even if the 
receiver can’t lock in.
 
 One downfall of A-GPS is the fact that cellular (or Internet) network 
assistance is required to calculate a position, making it useless in areas 
where no aiding information is available, such as areas without cellular 
coverage or compatible aiding servers in the roaming environments. 
Also, using network servers for position calculations makes A-GPS 
impractical for applications that require frequent position updates, such 
as continuous navigation.
Locating with cellular
Cellular networks, although not designed to track location, are attractive 
choices for location-based services because of the widespread use of mobile 
phones. In many countries, mobile phones enjoy high penetration rates — 
exceeding 100 percent in some countries because some people carry more 
than one mobile phone. Therefore, cellular network–based positioning is a 
highly suitable option with the potential of widespread deployment.
Following are a few positioning applications that make use of cellular 
technology:
 
✓ Cell phone free zones: Detecting and locating a person using a cell phone 
in a cell phone free zone such as military bases, courts, and so on.
 
✓ People locating: Share your location with your friends, family members, 
doctors, lawyers, colleagues, people in a social network, and so on, and 
see their location (if they enable sharing). Typically, you run a small 
application in your phone and use a service provided by your cell phone 
carrier.
 
✓ Government security: Detecting and locating phones installed by terror-
ists or other entities for eavesdropping, for example.
 
✓ Public safety: Locating a fugitive’s cell phone, for example.
 
✓ Emergency calls: Providing the caller’s location to the emergency first-
response teams.
 
✓ Location-based advertising: Providing location-targeted banners and 
advertisements.

Part III: Tag-A-Palooza: RTLS Technology Tour 
How cellular networks work
The cellular landscape is composed of different cellular phone networks: 1G 
(the original analog circuit-switched first-generation systems), 2G (second-
generation systems that use digital encoding such as Global System for 
Mobile communications [GSM] and Code Division Multiple Access [CDMA]), 
2.5G (2G technology with higher speeds to support data transport such as 
General Packet Radio Service [GPRS]), and 3G (data-centric third-generation 
networks such as EDGE). All the cellular phone networks use a portion of the 
radio frequency spectrum designated as Ultra High Frequency (UHF) for the 
transmission and reception of their signals.
The regulatory bodies of the country sell carriers a license for a block of UHF 
radio frequencies, which they can broadcast on in a specific area. Carriers 
further divide this block into smaller portions and have installed a vast net-
work of radio towers, called cell towers or base stations, throughout their 
coverage area where each tower has one or more antenna that provides the 
coverage on its assigned portion of frequency for that site, called a cell. This 
is illustrated in Figure 10-2. The cell is roughly circular and is typically 10 
square miles in size. The base stations use low-power transmitters and this 
allows cell towers in non-adjacent cells to use the same frequencies. Further, 
each base station is connected back to a central command center that con-
nects all the cells together into a cellular network, which is linked to the 
worldwide phone network.
 
Figure 10-2: 
A cellular 
network 
uses multi-
lateration to 
locate tags.
 
Based on availability of towers, a 
cellular tag (such as a phone) can receive 
signals from base stations around it.

165
 Chapter 10: Precision Locating with Wide Area Coverage
And, to allow mobile stations (also known as cellular phones, mobile phones, 
or cell phones) to connect, each base station divides its portion of frequency 
among a limited number of users. The total number of users a cell can support 
is often referred to as capacity. At a given location, a mobile phone can receive 
signals from several base stations’ signals. In a GSM network, for example, a 
mobile phone can simultaneously receive signals from up to six base stations.
Locating of mobile stations (tags) is implemented in one of the following ways:
 
✓ Network-based: In network-based implementation, the working principle is
 
1. The mobile station is doing an active transmission.
 
2. One or several base stations make necessary measurements (such 
as signal strength, time of arrival, and so on) and forward this data 
to a central location engine (also called mobile location center).
 
3. Based upon the measurements, the location engine computes the 
location. Typically this location information is available with the 
carrier and it may provide the information to the end user or appli-
cation for a fee. If the location information is needed at the mobile 
station, the location engine communicates that to the mobile sta-
tion using a data (back-end) network.
 
✓ Mobile-based: In mobile-based implementation, the working principle is
 
1. The mobile station is neither in active call nor actively transmitting. 
Instead, it listens for the control channels (that are transmitted con-
tinuously) from one or several base stations.
 
2. The mobile station makes the measurements and computes the 
location.
 
3. The mobile station may need some assisting information, such as 
GPS coordinates of the base stations, to compute its location. In 
this model, the location information is available with the mobile 
phone and it may have to forward the information to another appli-
cation using data (back-end) network.
Frequencies used in cellular networks
Different cellular standards use different radio 
frequencies. For example, IDEN uses 806–960 
MHz, and GSM uses 450–496 MHz, 806–960 MHz, 
or 1710–2025 MHz. The cellular phones can’t tune 
themselves automatically to the frequencies 
they find; they need the right hardware, not just 
software, to use different frequencies. For a list 
of the frequencies that cellular networks use, 
see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Cellular_frequencies.

166
Part III: Tag-A-Palooza: RTLS Technology Tour 
 
✓ Mobile-assisted: In mobile-assisted implementation, the working prin-
ciple is
 
1. Like mobile-based model, the mobile station is neither in active 
call nor actively transmitting. Instead, it listens for the control 
channels (that are transmitted continuously) from one or several 
base stations.
 
2. The mobile station makes the measurements but doesn’t compute 
the location.
 
3. The mobile station forwards the measurements to the central loca-
tion engine (also called mobile location center) in the network for 
further processing.
 
4. The computation burden is transferred to a location engine and 
this enables use of more sophisticated algorithms to compute the 
location. If the location information is needed at the mobile sta-
tion, the location engine communicates that to the mobile station 
using a data (back-end) network.
The typical measurements (as referred to in the preceding list) used for 
locating in cellular networks include:
 
✓ Cell identity: This is probably the crudest way to locate using cell 
phones. The location of cell phone is the location of serving base station 
(the base station to which the cell phone is connected). The grain size of 
the location is the cell size that can be a few hundred feet (100 meters) 
to a couple of miles (3 kilometers), depending upon the cell size and 
density of cell towers.
 
✓ Time advance: In this model, the location is computed by multilatera-
tion, using round-trip delay of signal between the base station and 
mobile station and the location of base stations. The grain size of the 
location depends upon the signal frequency, typically is around 1 mile, 
and in the worst case, is the same as the cell size.
 
✓ Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI): In this model, location is 
computed by multilateration, using the RSSI of the signal between the 
mobile station and base station and the location of the base stations. 
The grain size of the location depends upon the distance, physical ele-
ments (such as buildings), dynamic elements in between, and geographi-
cal layout, and typically is around 1 mile, and in a worst case, is the 
same as the cell size.
 
✓ Uplink Time Difference Of Arrival (UL-TDOA): In this method, the 
location of the mobile station during a call is accomplished by forcing 
the phone to request a handover to several neighboring base stations. 

167
 Chapter 10: Precision Locating with Wide Area Coverage
On request for handover, the mobile station sends access bursts at full 
power, and the difference in time of arrival of (bursts) signal from the 
mobile station to base stations as measured by different base stations is 
used for locating. The grain size of the location is 50–200 meters.
 
✓ Enhanced Observed Time Difference (E-OTD): In this model, additional 
reference mobile stations (fixed at well-known locations) are used. The 
location is computed by a central location engine that makes use of the 
time difference of arrival of signals between mobile station and base 
stations, as well as time difference of arrival of signals between the ref-
erence mobile stations and the base stations. The additional reference 
mobile stations enhance the accuracy of the location engine because it 
can use some corrections based on real data. The grain size of the loca-
tion is 50–200 meters.
 
Because cell network localization is less precise than other methods, this 
technique isn’t suitable for navigation applications. Many other applications 
don’t require a high degree of precision, so a rough position estimate can be 
valuable. Knowing your own rough location may be of value when you’re trav-
eling in an unknown area, for example, and knowing another person’s rough 
location may be useful when you’re deciding whether to meet up with that 
person, considering the distance and required travel time to the other per-
son’s location.
 
The location accuracy achieved in cellular networks depends upon the cell 
size and cell tower density. It is typically suitable for applications where accu-
racy better than 50–200 meters isn’t crucial. Because of the large grain size, 
it’s also difficult to locate the floor level in a building.
Pros and cons
Cellular network locating has the following advantages:
 
✓ Widely available: Cellular networks reach over 80 percent of the 
world’s population today.
 
✓ Works indoors and urban areas: Unlike GPS, it can provide location 
information in urban areas, including indoors.
 
✓ No additional tags for people: Because a cell phone is the tag, no addi-
tional tags need to be carried by people. Tags are required only for 
assets.
 
✓ Quick computation: Unlike GPS that needs to lock in to satellites, there 
is no initial delay with a cellular network.

168
Part III: Tag-A-Palooza: RTLS Technology Tour 
This technique also has several limitations:
 
✓ Low accuracy: This technique isn’t well suited for situations in which 
precision better than 50–200 meters is crucial. Tracking accuracy also 
depends heavily on the size of the cell site and density of cells.
 
✓ Dependence on carriers: Some models of locating are dependent upon 
cellular network operators, not all of which may provide this service. It 
isn’t available outside cellular networks, which implies you can’t locate 
cellular tags in an area where the cellular network isn’t available.
 
✓ Long-term infrastructure cost: It involves huge long-term infrastructure 
costs, because more cells are needed to improve the accuracy of the 
location information. However, there are obvious additional benefits of 
infrastructure deployment.
 
✓ Recurring cost: It may also involve the cost of requesting location infor-
mation through cellular networks because many times, the computed 
location information is available only with the carriers.
 
✓ High battery use: Cellular connections are power-hungry; as a result, 
it’s difficult to use it for frequent location accuracy (say, locating every 
second) for long periods with small batteries.
Improvising a cellular RTLS
In an effort to improve cellular location accuracy indoors, cellular receivers 
can be deployed indoors. These receivers — essentially, spectrum analyzers 
that detect radio-frequency (RF) activity — are independent from cellular 
service providers. They don’t decode data packets or listen into the calls and 
are entirely nonintrusive. They simply collect data and send it to a centralized 
location engine that calculates locations based on received signal strength or 
the time differences in the arrivals of signals from three or more such receiv-
ers. By using these receivers, the location engine can locate a cellular device 
with accuracy on the order of 3–5 meters indoors. See Figure 10-3.
Because cell phones can be located indoors and outside, these receivers 
potentially make cell phones the only technology that can be seamlessly 
located both indoors and outdoors with high accuracy. You can also use 
these receivers to locate indoors, irrespective of carrier or phone.
Another way to improve cellular location accuracy indoors is by making use 
of femtocells. Femtocells are miniaturized cellular base stations that connect 
to the carrier’s network via broadband (such as DSL or cable). A femtocell 
allows service providers to extend service coverage indoors, especially 
where access would otherwise be unavailable or limited. Not only do the fem-
tocells offer improvements to coverage and capacity, but they also provide 
another fixed point of reference for the purposes of multilateration to com-
pute location of cellular phones. Because femtocells have smaller coverage 
areas, they enable higher location accuracy.

Safety and security in the cellular network
Cellular devices use electromagnetic radia-
tion in the microwave range, and some people 
believe that this radiation may be harmful to 
human health, possibly causing brain cancer, 
neurological effects, and reproductive effects. 
Also of interest to researchers is whether cel-
lular radiation contributes to fatigue, sleep dis-
turbances, dizziness, loss of mental attention, 
reaction times and memory retentiveness, head-
aches, malaise, tachycardia (heart palpitations), 
and disturbances of the digestive system.
To protect the population living around base 
stations and users of mobile handsets, gov-
ernments and regulatory bodies have adopted 
safety standards that limit the maximum power 
output from a mobile phone (GSM handsets can 
use peak power of 2 watts, and CDMA2000 hand-
sets can use peak power of 1 watt, for example) 
or base station (base station emissions for 1800 
MHz are limited to 900 microwatts per square 
centimeter). Some standards also impose fur-
ther limits on continuous exposure levels. Many 
national and international standards exist, and 
devices do operate under those safety limits, 
but the controversial question is whether cur-
rent safety standards are adequate enough to 
protect the public’s long-term health.
Cell networks weren’t built with security in 
mind. In fact, to satisfy the basic need to allow 
people around the world to talk to one another 
through different systems, cell networks were 
designed with open standards, which impose 
many security risks:
 ✓ Jamming: Because the cellular signal mod-
ulation and frequency spectrum are known 
to the public, jammers can concentrate 
all the power within this spectrum to jam 
the wireless channel and therefore deny 
access to any legitimate devices in the 
network. Jamming could be unintentional, 
however; interference with the signal could 
prevent cellular devices from connecting.
 ✓ Spoofing: A malicious attacker can act as 
a legitimate base station, thereby denying 
mobile station access of cellular network.
 ✓ Denial of service (DOS) attacks: DOS 
attacks are potent attacks that can bring 
down an entire network infrastructure. In a 
DOS attack, excessive data (such as exces-
sive text messages) is sent to the network, 
more than the network can handle, resulting 
in cellular devices being unable to access 
network resources. Launching a large-
scale DOS attack from a single host may be 
difficult, so a distributed denial of service 
(DDOS) attack may be carried out, with sev-
eral hosts being used to launch the attack.
 ✓ Eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle 
attacks: The encryption algorithms can be 
cracked by motivated attackers. Such an 
attacker can intercept sensitive communica-
tion by eavesdropping, or sit between a cell 
phone and base station and intercept mes-
sages between them — a situation known 
as a man-in-the-middle attack, in which the 
attacker can intercept messages in both 
directions and change the content without 
the users ever knowing. Man-in-the-middle 
attacks are discussed in Chapter 15.
 ✓ Session hijacking: A malicious attacker 
can highjack an established session and 
act as a legitimate base station, thereby 
denying the mobile station access to the 
cellular network.
You should consider these security risks as well 
as countermeasures as part of your process of 
determining suitable technology for your RTLS 
application. See Chapter 15 for more about 
RTLS security.

Working with WiMAX
WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) is a wireless 
digital communications system, also known as IEEE 802.16, that is intended 
for wireless metropolitan area networks. It can blanket a 30-mile radius with 
broadband access, potentially erasing the suburban and rural blackout areas 
that currently have no broadband Internet access. Like cellular networks, 
WiMAX can be used as an RTLS technology supporting wide area coverage.
WiMAX technology
WiMAX isn’t a technology; rather, it’s a certifi-
cation or stamp of approval given to equipment 
that meets certain conformity and interoperabil-
ity tests for the IEEE 802.16 family of standards. 
Wi-Fi (wireless fidelity) is a similar certification — 
in this case, for equipment based on IEEE stan-
dards from the 802.11 working group for wireless 
local area networks. WiMAX is very different 
from Wi-Fi in the way it works, however. WiMAX 
can provide broadband wireless access for up to 
30 miles (50 kilometers) for fixed stations and for 
3–10 miles (5–15 kilometers) for mobile stations. 
By contrast, Wi-Fi is limited in most cases to 100–
300 feet (30–100 meters). WiMAX easily achieves 
Wi-Fi–like data rates that are easily supported, 
but the issue of interference is lessened.
WiMAX operates on both licensed and non-
licensed frequencies, providing a regulated 
environment and viable economic model for 
wireless carriers. For non-line of sight service, 
WiMAX uses a lower frequency range: 2 GHz 
to 11 GHz (similar to Wi-Fi). This type of access 
is limited to a 4–6-mile radius — perhaps 25 
square miles or 65 square kilometers of cover-
age, which is similar in range to a cell-phone 
zone. For line of sight service, WiMAX uses 
higher frequencies: 66 GHz. Because higher fre-
quencies enable less interference and lot more 
bandwidth, through the stronger line-of-sight 
antennas, WiMAX achieves a range of a 30-mile 
radius (50 kilometers) — perhaps 2,800 square 
miles or 9,300 square kilometers of coverage.

171
 Chapter 10: Precision Locating with Wide Area Coverage
Following are a few positioning applications that make use of WiMAX 
technology:
 
✓ Locating stolen laptops: Typically, WiMAX receivers (such as Bluetooth 
and/or Wi-Fi) are embedded in laptops, and a stolen laptop can be 
detected and located.
 
✓ People locating: Share your location with your friends, family members, 
doctors, lawyers, colleagues, people in a social network, and so on, and 
see their location (if they enable sharing). Typically, you run a small 
application in your WiMAX device.
 
✓ Tracking shipments: The shipments can be tracked not only at the 
origin or destination but also along the path.
 
✓ Location-based advertising: WiMAX provides location-targeted banners 
and advertisements during Internet access.
How WiMAX works
A WiMAX system consists of two parts (see Figure 10-4):
 
✓ A WiMAX tower: WiMAX towers are similar in concept to cell-phone 
towers. A single WiMAX tower can provide coverage to a large area — 
as big as 3,000 square miles (approximately 8,000 square kilometers).
 
✓ WiMAX receivers (tags): The receiver and antenna could be contained 
in a small standalone tag enclosure or extension module for computers 
and laptops. The WiMAX receiver could be built into your cell phone, 
the way sometimes Wi-Fi is.
The working principle for locating a tag is very similar to how the location is 
computed in cellular networks. The computation model is based on one of 
these methods:
 
✓ Network-based: One or several WiMAX towers make necessary measure-
ments, such as RSSI, TOA, TDOA, and so on, and forward this data to a 
central location engine that computes the location
 
✓ WiMAX receivers-based: The measurements are taken by the receiver 
and it computes the location
 
✓ WiMAX receivers-assisted: The receiver collects the measurements and 
forwards to a central location engine that computes the location.

Add on WiMAX
module
The typical measurements used for locating in WiMAX networks include:
 
✓ Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI): Location is computed by 
trilateration using the RSSI of signals between WiMAX receivers and the 
WiMAX towers.
 
✓ Time difference of arrival (TDOA): Location is computed by trilatera-
tion using time difference of arrival of signal between WiMAX receivers 
and several WiMAX towers.
 
✓ Round Trip Time (RTT): Trilateration is used to compute location 
using round trip delay of signal between the WiMAX tower and WiMAX 
receiver.
Refer to Chapter 2 for more details on how these measurements are used for 
computing location.
 
Location accuracy on the order of 50–200 meters can be achieved using 
WiMAX signals. The accuracy range mostly depends upon the size and density 
of WiMAX cells.

173
 Chapter 10: Precision Locating with Wide Area Coverage
Pros and cons
Using WiMAX for RTLS offers following key advantages:
 
✓ Long range: The most significant benefit of WiMAX compared with exist-
ing wireless technologies is its range. WiMAX has a communication range 
of up to 30 miles (50 kilometers), or more than 2,800 square miles — 
enough to blanket a city.
 
✓ Urban and indoor locating: WiMAX can provide location information in 
urban areas, including indoors.
 
✓ Quick initial position fix: WiMAX gets an initial fix in seconds.
 
✓ Standards-based technology: You don’t have to use a particular WiMAX 
provider to use WiMAX.
 
✓ IP-based network: Because WiMAX is built on IP, it natively runs exist-
ing IP-based products, services, and utilities. This system enables much 
easier and cheaper network monitoring, troubleshooting, and manage-
ment with standard tools.
 
✓ Lower latency: Because it was designed as a data network from the 
ground up, WiMAX has a much simpler network topology than cellular 
networks, which have to add layers and invent new tricks to enable their 
technology to handle data. This results in lower latency in linking RTLS 
applications, WiMAX towers, and tags.
WiMAX has the following limitations:
 
✓ Not deployed enough: WiMAX is still in its infancy phase and isn’t 
widely available as of this writing. The clients and tags aren’t widely 
available either.
 
✓ High power consumption: The tags have high battery consumption.
 
✓ Low accuracy: Tracking accuracy is heavily dependent on the size of 
the WiMAX cell site. Location accuracy is low, on the order of 50–200 
meters. Nevertheless, the technology is well suited for situations in 
which precision better than 100 meters isn’t crucial.
 
✓ Dependence on carriers. Some models of locating are dependent upon 
WiMAX network operators, not all of which may provide this service. It 
isn’t available outside WiMAX networks, which implies you can’t locate 
WiMAX tags in an area where the WiMAX network isn’t available.

Part III: Tag-A-Palooza: RTLS Technology Tour 
Understanding TV-signal positioning
Television is one of the most influential forces of our time and although not 
designed to track location, is a highly suitable option with the potential of 
widespread deployment for location-based services because of the nature 
and availability of TV signals — TV signals are almost everywhere (broadcast 
today across every metropolitan area on Earth), powerful, low and diverse in 
frequency, and they easily penetrate walls, automobiles, and city buildings.
Following are a few positioning applications that can make use of TV signal–
based technology:
 
✓ Femtocell synchronization: Femtocells (discussed in the earlier section, 
“Improvising a cellular RTLS”) are typically deployed in residential or small 
business environments and require precise location information for their 
basic operation (for frequency stability and timing synchronization with 
the cellular network). And by adding a TV signal–based tag to femtocells, 
the location information of femtocells can be computed automatically. This 
removes dependence upon the end user to provide the exact coordinates.
 
✓ Campus panic alert: A panic alert enables students or teachers to 
summon assistance in any part of the school (or university) campus by 
carrying a TV signal–based call-button tag. There are many areas in a 
typical campus where it isn’t possible to install infrastructure (location 
sensors) for locating and there isn’t GPS coverage either.
 
✓ Channel audience analysis: By integrating the TV-signal tags into televi-
sions, marketers can determine the audience of a specific channel based 
on the TV’s location and use the statistical data for marketing and other 
purposes.
 
✓ Weapon locating: Attaching TV-signal tags to weapons enables detec-
tion and locating of weapons in indoor but dangerous places where it is 
typically difficult to go.
Television broadcasting frequencies
Broadcast terrestrial (ground-based) television 
is transmitted on various bands or frequencies. 
These transmission bands vary by country and 
are usually set by the nation’s spectrum regula-
tion body. For example, in North America, the 
FCC has allocated each TV channel to a band-
width of 6 MHz; channels 2–6 use 54–88 MHz), 
channels 7–13 use 174–216 MHz, and channels 
14–83 use 470–890 MHz. Within the 6 MHz space 
for each channel is a video carrier, a color car-
rier, and an audio carrier.
Note that the frequencies used for cable TV and 
satellite television channels are different, and 
digital television uses the same frequencies as 
analog. Digital TV, however, requires less band-
width (more along the lines of 2 MHz).

175
 Chapter 10: Precision Locating with Wide Area Coverage
How television networks can be used for an RTLS
Ground-based television networks consist of a series of TV towers (also 
known as base stations or broadcast towers). Each tower broadcasts one or 
more channels. Each channel is transmitted on its own frequency, which can 
be tuned in and received by your TV set or TV tuner card. Each channel also 
has timing information. See Figure 10-5 for an example.
The working principle for using this network for an RTLS is as follows:
 
1. The tag contains a TV tuner — a baseband TV measurement module that 
can extract timing and a back-end network interface (such as Wi-Fi).
 
2. The tag listens to the channels and forwards the timing information 
about these channels to the central location engine using the back-end 
network interface.
 
3. By using trilateration with knowledge of distance from three or more 
towers, the location engine is able to compute the position of the tag:
 
• Location of towers that broadcast the channel is well-known 
because each channel uniquely identifies its source tower in an area.
 
• The time for signal to travel (from the tower to the tag) can be con-
verted into distance by multiplying it with speed of light.

Part III: Tag-A-Palooza: RTLS Technology Tour 
 
4. Because TV transmitters typically are equipped with clock-reference 
oscillators that can’t match the quality of GPS satellite clocks, the clocks 
of different TV stations are typically unsynchronized either to each 
other or a common time reference such as a GPS. For this reason, an 
external system (called a signal monitor) is needed. The signal monitor 
examines the clock characteristics of different channels to compute cor-
rection data. The signal monitor then forwards the correction data to 
the location engine that can use it for computing location.
To enable a tag to compute its position autonomously (that is, without using 
an external location engine), the aiding data currently sent from the signal 
monitor to the location engine could be forwarded to the tag directly or to 
pseudo-TV transmitters synchronized to GPS time (and the tag uses the sig-
nals from these pseudo transmitters).
 
A typical location accuracy on the order of 5–50 meters can be achieved using 
TV signals. The accuracy mostly depends upon the density of TV towers.
Pros and cons
TV-signal positioning enjoys fundamental advantages over GPS and A-GPS. 
These advantages are based on the laws of physics, and their combined 
effect is compelling:
 
✓ High redundancy: The broadcast TV infrastructure is distributed, 
robust, and comprised of transmitters that are highly correlated with 
population density and broadband penetration. Further, TV transmitters 
are distributed, supplied with backup power at the studio and hilltop, 
and are highly resistant to disaster.
 
✓ Better urban locating: Fading effects, building attenuation caused by 
building materials, are significantly better for TV than for GPS because
 
• TV signals enjoy a substantial power advantage over GPS signals. 
Not only are terrestrial TV broadcast signals typically 1 megawatt 
effective radiated power (ERP) compared with 500 watts ERP for 
GPS satellite signals, but the TV towers are also typically located 
every 10 miles. The result is that the signal is much stronger when 
received by the tags in comparison to the signal strength of satel-
lite as received by GPS receivers.
 
• Unlike GPS signals (that are transmitted at frequencies of 1.2276 GHz–
1.575 GHz), TV signals are broadcast at much lower frequencies 
(50–800 MHz) and aren’t as attenuated by buildings and other man-
made structures.
 
✓ Frequency diversity: Because each TV tower typically broadcasts more 
than one channel, the receivers have a better chance of acquiring a 
signal, given that these channels are broadcast at different frequencies.

177
 Chapter 10: Precision Locating with Wide Area Coverage
 
✓ Better mitigation of multipath: Because the bandwidth of broadcast 
television ranges from 6–8 MHz, in contrast with GPS satellite signal 
that has a bandwidth of 1 MHz, you can better resolve multipath (the 
reflected signals that characterize urban and indoor environments).
 
✓ Resistant to jamming: A TV signal–based solution is distributed and 
therefore resistant to jamming.
 
✓ Limited atmospheric effects: Unlike GPS, the TV towers are deployed on 
ground and so aren’t limited by atmospheric effects.
 
✓ No ephemeris errors: Unlike GPS, the TV towers are always at fixed loca-
tions and so don’t have ephemeris errors. (Ephemeris is discussed in 
the earlier section, “Using satellite navigation systems.”)
Locating using TV signals also has several limitations:
 
✓ Need for signal-monitors: Except for mobile TV networks that are syn-
chronized with GPS, signal monitors are required for aiding data.
 
✓ High power consumption: The TV tuners are power-hungry.
 
✓ High cost: Although the TV tuners aren’t as costly for deployment as 
mobile tags, these tags also need a back-end network radio and cor-
responding circuitry. The cost is typically lower than other competing 
wide area network technologies, however.
 
✓ No global standardization: Because different TV standards are used in 
different countries, the tags need to be different in different countries.
Like TV signals, it is possible to use other signals, such as FM-radio signals, 
for real-time locating. And like TV signals, positioning synchronization of 
timing between signals transmitted from different towers is required for 
FM-radio signals.
Mobile TV signal advantage
Mobile TV is broadcast and delivered in many 
ways. You can broadcast live TV to mobile 
devices such as cell phones via satellite, terres-
trial towers, or Wi-Fi or WiMAX networks. Many 
mobile TV signals such as DVB-H (digital video 
broadcasting for handhelds) or T-DMB (terres-
trial digital multimedia broadcasting) are syn-
chronized to GPS, so position can be calculated 
by the tag without needing any aiding data.

Chapter 11
Precision Locating with 
Local Area Coverage
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding local area coverage
▶ Exploring the underlying technologies
L
ocation is a key organizing principle in the bricks-and-mortar retail 
world. It’s part of the business psyche. Businesses know that it’s important 
to place specific things in specific locations to increase sales. You can see 
magazines and candies typically placed near checkout stands, for example. 
And, the commercial success of GPS (Global Positioning System) and the 
increase in terrorism have spurred everyone’s interest — not just the 
retailers — to automatically locate anything or anybody in real time, not just 
outdoors but indoors also.
In Chapter 10, I discuss locating technologies, such as GPS, that support 
wide area coverage — locating assets or people in areas spanning large 
geographic areas, such as cities, countries, and the entire world. As I mention 
in Chapter 10, although wide area coverage implies locating tags in outdoor, 
urban, or even indoor environments, typically the technologies that support 
wide area coverage need some assistance (or require use of precision-locating 
technologies that support local area coverage) to provide high accuracy in 
local areas, such as within a room, building, campus, or specific metropolitan 
area.
In this chapter, I provide an overview of the most commonly used technologies 
that provide precision locating in local areas, including a description of the 
strengths as well as the vulnerabilities of each technology.

180
Part III: Tag-A-Palooza: RTLS Technology Tour 
Understanding Precision
The model of reporting the location for technologies supporting local area 
coverage is no different from the technologies supporting wide area coverage. 
Wide area coverage is reported in terms of distance as the accuracy level and 
a percentage as the precision:
 
✓ Accuracy level: Accuracy level (or grain size) is reported in terms of 
distance to indicate how far the estimated position could be from the 
real position.
 
✓ Precision: Precision is reported in terms of a percentage, and it 
indicates how often you can expect to get that accuracy level.
For example, some Ultra Wideband (UWB)–based RTLS systems (which I 
discuss later in this chapter) can locate tag positions within 12 inches for 
approximately 95 percent of measurements. The distance — 12 inches in this 
example — denotes the accuracy of the position the UWB can provide, and 
the percentage — 95 percent in this example — denotes precision.
This precision accuracy is often used to determine the locating system’s 
applicability for a particular application. Motion-capture installations may 
support computer animation features, centimeter-level spatial positioning, 
and precise temporal resolution, but most applications don’t require this 
level of accuracy. A personal location system for a home or office application 
might need enough accuracy to answer the query, “Which room was I in 
around noon?” but not “Where, to the nearest cubic inch, was my left thumb 
at 12:00:46 p.m.?”
Understanding the Underlying 
Technologies
Along with the increase in users and in the diversity of users that require 
precise locating identification in local areas, positioning technologies have 
received increased attention from various authors, scientists, students, 
universities, businesses, organizations, and governments. Today, precision 
locating in local areas can be achieved with many different RTLS technologies 
that have different physical, operational, performance, and cost characteristics. 
Precision locating can be achieved with sound, light, camera vision, and 
radio frequency waves, for example.

Technological evolution is a process in which the emergence of the first tech-
nology results in a newer species of the same technology or newer technologies. 
What this means is that your vendor may offer you a slight variation, a 
combination, or a completely new technology that isn’t described in this 
chapter. Understand how your vendor makes use of the specific technology 
because that can affect the real-time locating solution’s capacity to locate.
The following sections describe the most commonly used technologies that 
support local area coverage. Note that ultrasound and infrared can be used 
for precision locating as well. These technologies are discussed in Chapter 9.
Estimating position with dead reckoning
Dead reckoning (DR) is the process of estimating your current position based 
on a previously determined position, or fix. Through this process, you estimate 
your position based on known speed, elapsed time, and course.
Although traditional methods of DR are no longer considered primary in 
most applications, DR was used by Christopher Columbus for discovering the 
new world, and modern inertial navigation systems, which also depend upon 
DR, are widely used.

182
Part III: Tag-A-Palooza: RTLS Technology Tour 
In an inertial navigation system (also referred to as an inertial guidance system 
or an inertial reference platform), tags use sensors to continuously track their 
position, orientation, and velocity (direction and movement speed) and then 
use this information to compute their precise location as it relates to their 
start position. Because tags are self-contained and require no location sensors 
for computing location, DR is an attractive choice for applications when it’s 
difficult to install location sensors. Following are some sample applications 
that use DR:
 
✓ Miner safety: These applications give rescue personnel the most accurate 
and up-to-date locations of trapped personnel, and also track personnel as 
they move away from dangerous conditions. Tags are carried by miners 
and rescue personnel; the tags typically communicate their location to 
the central location engine/application with a back-end wireless network.
 
✓ Airplane location: These applications are used as supplements to 
Global Positioning System (GPS) locating. These tags are included in the 
GPS receivers, and whenever GPS loses track of satellites (see Chapter 
10 for more on GPS-based locating), the airplane location is updated 
with the information derived from these tags and the last GPS-reported 
position.
 
✓ Firefighter safety: These applications provide the locations of fire-
fighters when they enter and exit fire areas. The tags are worn by the 
firefighters; the tags continuously update their location to the central 
location engine/application with a back-end wireless network.
How dead reckoning works
An inertial navigation system has two main components:
 
✓ Tags: Tags have inertial sensing instruments that enable them to detect 
movement or rotation. Sensing instruments that are typically used in 
tags include accelerometers, gyros, magnetometers, and barometric 
altimeters, as shown in Figure 11-1:
 
• Accelerometers: An accelerometer is a device that measures 
non-gravitational accelerations. Because mathematically you can 
use acceleration to deduce the distance change, if you know the 
direction of travel, you can deduce the tag’s current position.
 
• Gyros: A gyro is a device that measures orientation. By knowing 
this orientation, you can determine the angle through which the 
tag has been rotated.
 
• Magnetometers: A magnetometer measures the strength and/or 
direction of a magnetic field. You can use this value for calculating 
the tag estimation with respect to the starting position relative 
to Earth’s magnetic poles. For example, the tag is currently 45 
degrees (clockwise) from true north (or magnetic north).

183
 Chapter 11: Precision Locating with Local Area Coverage
 
• Barometric altimeters: A barometric altimeter (or a pressure 
altimeter) measures the current atmospheric pressure directly as 
an altitude above mean sea level. You can use the reading to 
determine a tag’s elevation. 
 
 
 Typically, tags have a back-end network interface (such as Wi-Fi) 
to communicate their locations to the location engine, middleware, 
and application software.
 
✓ Tag start-position initializer: Because using sensing instruments in a 
tag can determine only the change in position, the tag’s starting position 
needs to be initialized. For example, when a miner enters the mine, the 
tag is initialized to indicate the miner’s exact coordinates. This way 
when the miner moves around, the tag always knows the current position 
of the miner. Typically, this is done by software that informs the tag 
of the starting position by using the tag’s back-end network interface. 
Another way to establish the starting position is to integrate a locating 
interface, such as a GPS receiver, into the tag. The GPS can auto-initialize 
the tag. Before a police officer enters a building, for example, his or her 
tag can be initialized with the starting position by using GPS, and later 
positions of the police officer in the building can be estimated based on 
dead reckoning.

based on known start location and send to the application.

Dead reckoning pros and cons
An inertial navigation system enjoys several advantages over other RTLS 
technologies:
 
✓ Needs no infrastructure: The tags require no external input for com-
puting location. This feature is well suited for applications used in 
spaces that have no existing infrastructure, such as locating firefighters 
when they go inside a building.
 
✓ High level of accuracy: The accuracy of such systems is very high — on 
the order of centimeters.
 
✓ Instantaneous output: A tag always knows its location. No network 
latency is involved.
 
✓ Private and secure: The inertial navigation system was initially developed 
for the military, so it’s accurate, reliable, and not susceptible to signal 
jamming or erroneous signal transmission. Also, only the tag knows its 
location, so malicious hackers can’t eavesdrop or block the tag from 
computing its location.
The inertial navigation system also suffers several disadvantages compared 
with other RTLS technologies:
 
✓ Drift: Even the small errors in velocity and direction reported by 
accelerometers and gyros have the largest impact because each new 
position is a function of the last position. These errors happen for many 
reasons, such as vibration, constant change in acceleration or direction 
of tags, and so on.
 
✓ High power use: The sensors consume power to keep the platform 
aligned with the navigational frame; hence, the life of batteries in tags 
can be limited. The sensors can be very useful, however, in applications 
in which tags are put on and removed at entry and exit points, such as 
personnel tracking in a mine, firefighter tracking, and so on.
 
✓ Expensive maintenance: Because the tags are the most sophisticated 
pieces of hardware involved, all tags require regular maintenance by 
certified personnel, and repair is expensive as well.
 
✓ Need for precise start-up position: Because the tags can only determine 
the change in position, the tag’s starting position needs to be initialized 
precisely. Any initial entry errors have a direct impact on the current 
position determined by tags.

Using Wi-Fi for an RTLS
Wi-Fi (short for wireless fidelity) is a technology used around the world to 
connect to the Internet or any network without wires or cables. The technology 
is nearly ubiquitous: Places from entire cities to coffee shops and fast-food 
restaurants to offices and homes offer Wi-Fi; all sorts of devices from com-
puters to cell phones to TVs and console game systems use Wi-Fi. When you 
use Wi-Fi technology, your device connects wirelessly to a Wi-Fi access point 
(also called a wireless access point or a wireless router) that provides the link 
to the Internet or other type of network.
 
Wi-Fi is also referred to as 802.11 networking. The 802.11 designation comes 
from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).
Although, the traditional role of Wi-Fi is to provide convenient and widely 
available wireless network access, the maturing and widespread acceptance of 
Wi-Fi has begun a flurry of activity regarding an RTLS using Wi-Fi. Businesses 
are already deploying Wi-Fi for internal use or for guest access to the Internet 
and by using it for the RTLS, they can extend the benefits of the deployment 
to areas such as audit, compliance, security, and asset management, and in 
general can improve efficiency throughout the enterprise.
How a Wi-Fi RTLS works
Many Wi-Fi–based location systems are commercially available or in the 
research phase. The basic principles used by most Wi-Fi RTLS are Received 
Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA), both 
of which are covered in the following sections.
A Wi-Fi RTLS can locate laptops, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and other 
devices that have embedded Wi-Fi radios or tags. I also use the term Wi-Fi tag 
to refer to devices with built-in Wi-Fi radios.
RSSI-based Wi-Fi RTLS
Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) is a measurement of the power 
present in the signal received by Wi-Fi tags or Wi-Fi access points from one 
another. Because the power levels at the start of the signal transmissions are 
well known and the power drop in signals in open space as well as through 
different media is well defined, RSSI can be used to estimate the distance 
between Wi-Fi tags and Wi-Fi access points.

186
Part III: Tag-A-Palooza: RTLS Technology Tour 
Locating Wi-Fi tags with RSSI is implemented in one of the following ways:
 
✓ Network-based: As shown in Figure 11-2, in network-based implementa-
tion, the working principle is
 
1. A Wi-Fi tag does the active signal transmission. A Wi-Fi tag sends 
Wi-Fi probe requests (typically, Wi-Fi clients send probe requests 
whenever they need to determine which access points are within 
range), proprietary Wi-Fi messages, or some other Wi-Fi messages.
Wi-Fi frequencies
Wi-Fi includes IEEE 802.11 standards, including 
802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11n.
 ✓ 802.11a operates at 5.8 GHz spectrum 
with the Orthogonal Frequency Division 
Multiplexing (OFDM) modulation technique. 
The 5.8 GHz spectrum is further divided into 
many channels (the number of channels 
depends upon the country regulations).
 ✓ 802.11b operates at 2.4 GHz spectrum with 
the Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum 
(DSSS) modulation technique. The 2.4 GHz 
spectrum is further divided into 14 overlap-
ping (3 non-overlapping) staggered 20 MHz 
wireless carrier channels (channels 1–14) 
whose center frequencies are 5 MHz apart. 
In simple terms, DSSS is a spread spectrum 
technology (where the carrier signals occur 
over the full bandwidth — the spectrum of 
a device’s transmitting frequency) in which 
the signal is encoded using a pseudo-noise 
code sequence.
 ✓ 802.11g operates at 2.4 GHz spectrum like 
802.11b, but uses the same OFDM-based 
transmission scheme as 802.11a. 802.11g is 
interoperable with 802.11b.
 ✓ 802.11n operates at both the 2.4 GHz and 
5 GHz spectrums and builds upon earlier 
802.11 standards by adding Multiple-Input 
Multiple-Output (MIMO). 802.11n provides 
ways of ensuring coexistence among the 
legacies 802.11a, b, and g and the new 
devices. 802.11n is expected to be finalized 
in November 2009.
The channels that are available for use in a 
particular country differ according to the regu-
lations of that country. In the United States, 
for example, FCC (Federal Communications 
Commission) regulations allow only channels 
1–11 to be used in 2.4 GHz spectrum; in Europe, 
channels 1–13 are licensed for 802.11b opera-
tion (with 1, 5, 9, and 13 usually deployed); and in 
Japan, all 14 channels are licensed for 802.11b 
operation.
Typical Wi-Fi access point transmission power 
is 100 milliwatts.

187
 Chapter 11: Precision Locating with Local Area Coverage
 
2. One or several access points that receive this signal make the 
measurements of RSSI and forward this information to a location 
engine. The access points are connected to the location engine by 
a wired or wireless network.
 
3. Based upon these RSSI values and access point locations, the 
location engine computes the tag’s location with one of the 
techniques I describe later in this section.
 
✓ Client-based: As shown in Figure 11-3, in client-based implementation, 
the working principle is
 
1. A Wi-Fi tag listens for beacons (Wi-Fi access points send beacons 
periodically to announce their presence and provide parameters 
for configuration for Wi-Fi clients in range) in the air and records 
the RSSI values from various access points.
 
2. The Wi-Fi tag forwards these RSSI value/access point pairs to the 
location engine, typically with the Wi-Fi back-end network.
 
3. Based upon these RSSI values and access point locations, the 
location engine computes the location with one of the techniques 
I describe later in this section.

 Chapter 11: Precision Locating with Local Area Coverage
The location engine uses the RSSI values and one of the following methods to 
determine the location of a Wi-Fi tag:
 
✓ Nearest access point: In this method, the location engine returns the 
location of the nearest Wi-Fi access point (highest RSSI) as the location 
of the Wi-Fi tag. This method is the simplest but least accurate way to 
locate a Wi-Fi tag. If you have an access point deployed every 100 feet, 
for example, this method narrows the location of a Wi-Fi tag to an area of 
only 10,000 square feet. For this reason, this method is sometimes called 
presence detection or presence-based locating. Depending on your appli-
cation’s location-accuracy needs, this method may be adequate, but in 
most cases isn’t sufficient.
 
✓ Trilateration: In this method, the location engine uses trilateration (I 
discuss this in Chapter 2) to determine the most likely location of a Wi-Fi 
tag. The basic methodology is that if the distance d from various access 
points to the Wi-Fi tag can be measured, a circle with radius d can be 
drawn with the center at each access point. The most likely location of 
the device is where all these circles intersect (see Figure 11-4).
RF signal attenuation
As the signal leaves its source, it attenuates, or 
the power of the signal drops. The signal attenu-
ates in free space, depending on the absorption 
characteristics of the objects in its transmission 
path (the objects in the signal’s path are also 
dubbed barriers).
The free-space propagation loss in dB is given 
by the formula:
 
 Path loss (approx) = –38 + 20 × log10(f) + 10 
× n × log10(d)
In this formula, f is the transmission frequency 
in MHz; d is the distance specified in feet; and 
n is the path-loss constant depending upon the 
environment. The value of n is 2 for free space, 
2.5–4 in most indoor environments, and so on. 
For example, the free-space loss for 2.4 GHz at 
100 feet from the transmitter is about 70 dB.
Based on the transmission frequency, the thick-
ness, and the specific type of material used, 
different materials absorb radio frequency (RF) 
energy and cause RF attenuation. For example, 
a steel fire-exit door causes an attenuation of 
13–19 dB for a 2.4 GHz signal and 25–32 dB for a 
5 GHz signal; interior drywall causes an attenu-
ation of 3–4 dB for a 2.4 GHz signal and 3–5 dB 
for a 5 GHz signal.

Location engine converts the RSSI values into distance,  and then

is where the three circles intersect.

 To find the distance from each access point, the RSSI values of messages 
between access points and the Wi-Fi tag are converted to distance via a 
signal propagation model.

191
 Chapter 11: Precision Locating with Local Area Coverage
 
 Because RSSI attenuates exponentially with distance, if the tags are 
closer to access points, RSSI can be almost linearly correlated with 
distance. This means that location accuracy is directly proportional to 
the density of access points. The more access points you deploy, the 
greater the location accuracy. Conversely, the fewer access points you 
deploy, the less accurate the measurements are.
 
✓ Fingerprint match (scene analysis): In this method, also known as 
calibration or training, actual measurements of RSSI values (as seen by 
real Wi-Fi tags in the real environment) from various access points are 
recorded at different places in the facility and stored in a database. 
This fingerprint database may be comprehensive, such as collected 
at a very large number of points in the facility, or it may just include 
measurements from known pathways, which is more commonly used 
commercially. The location engine estimates the location of a Wi-Fi tag 
by comparing RSSI observations at the current location with observations 
in a database. The outcome of the search and matching algorithms is 
the likeliest location of the tag. Note: These databases also need to be 
rebuilt often due to environmental changes.
 
✓ Calibration (sample) tags: In this method, various Wi-Fi tags, called 
calibration tags, are placed at well-known fixed locations throughout the 
facility. The location engine estimates the location of a Wi-Fi tag by 
comparing the RSSI observations at its current location with observations 
from various calibration tags. The calibration tags are typically used in 
conjunction with the fingerprint-match models or trilateration-based 
models to enhance location accuracy.
 
✓ Landmark tags: In this method, various tags, called landmark tags, are 
placed at fixed locations throughout the facility. The location engine 
estimates the Wi-Fi tag location based on RSSI values from the landmark 
tags and the RSSI values of access points. Because the relative distances 
between Wi-Fi tags and landmark tags are shorter than the conventional 
distances between Wi-Fi tags and Wi-Fi access points, obstacles are 
less of a problem during positioning. Using landmark tags enables the 
location engine to estimate location with high accuracy, even in environ-
ments that don’t have enough access points deployed.
TDOA-based Wi-Fi RTLS
In a TDOA-based Wi-Fi RTLS(I discuss TDOA in Chapter 2), location is 
computed by trilateration using access point locations and the time difference 
between the signal received by multiple access points and the Wi-Fi tag. The 
working principle of a TDOA-based Wi-Fi RTLS can be described as
 
1. A Wi-Fi tag does active signal transmissions. A Wi-Fi tag sends Wi-Fi 
probe requests (typically Wi-Fi clients send probe requests whenever 
they need to determine which access points are within range), 
proprietary Wi-Fi messages, or some other Wi-Fi messages.

192
Part III: Tag-A-Palooza: RTLS Technology Tour 
 
2. Each access point records the time when it receives the signal and then 
forwards that information in the form of a timestamp to the location 
engine.
 
3. The location engine uses the position of access points along with the 
received signal’s time difference between each of the access points. 
Mathematically, for trilateration purposes, the tag position computed by 
TDOA is the intersection of hyperbolas (hyperboloids in 3D).
 
To measure time differences in the signals received by multiple access points 
from a Wi-Fi tag, you may need specialized access points or hardware. This 
makes the Wi-Fi network proprietary from this perspective. You may not be 
able to mix and match Wi-Fi access points from various vendors. You’ll also 
need to have the clocks of the access points synchronized precisely for TDOA 
to work. Many times wires or cables are used to achieve time synchronization 
between access points.
 
Because TDOA estimates time based on the shortest received path (usually, a 
direct path), this method is most effective in a multipath environment. 
Accuracy is affected by latency in receiver response (which may be due to a 
processing queue at the receiver) but isn’t affected by the distance between 
tags and access points.
Wi-Fi RTLS pros and cons
Wi-Fi RTLS products enjoy several advantages over other RTLS technologies:
 
✓ Standards-based: The Wi-Fi RTLS is a standards-based approach that 
translates to more choices and interoperability features in a multiple-
vendor solution, which usually results in lower prices.
 
 Although Wi-Fi is a standard, the implementation of a Wi-Fi RTLS could 
be done in proprietary ways, and RTLS implementation may not work 
with W-Fi access points from all vendors. You must verify this with your 
Wi-Fi RTLS vendor.
 
✓ Lower cost: A Wi-Fi RSSI-based RTLS tends to be much less expensive 
than other technologies because it makes use of Wi-Fi access points 
installed for data network/Internet access.
 
✓ Less training: Because many Wi-Fi networks are already installed, you 
don’t have to teach personnel how to manage such networks.
 
✓ Multipurpose network: Wi-Fi is a multipurpose network — you can use 
it for data, video, voice, and so on.
 
✓ Simplified troubleshooting: Managing multiple, incompatible proprietary 
systems usually is difficult because the systems require separate 
consoles and additional training. If the system breaks down, vendors 
may blame other vendors’ equipment for the problems. Using a single 
technology in the network simplifies troubleshooting.

193
 Chapter 11: Precision Locating with Local Area Coverage
 
✓ Tracking without tags: With growing categories of devices using built-in 
Wi-Fi, organizations can track other assets (such as Wi-Fi–enabled PDAs, 
mobile phones, and laptops) without attaching tags to them.
Wi-Fi RTLS products also suffer several disadvantages compared with other 
RTLS technologies:
 
✓ Burden on Wi-Fi: Although the burden is minimal, a Wi-Fi RTLS does 
add some burden on the Wi-Fi network via data traffic from an RTLS. The 
burden depends on the number of tags involved and how often locations 
are updated.
 
✓ Limited accuracy of existing infrastructure: Existing Wi-Fi infrastructure 
typically isn’t installed for high accurate location information. Most 
companies have to reposition their access points or add a significant 
number of new access points to ensure dense-enough coverage to locate 
equipment and people.
 
✓ Scalability limits: The scalability of a Wi-Fi locating system depends 
on the performance of the server (location engine) that calculates the 
position.
 
✓ Limits of RSSI: RSSI is affected by various environmental features, such 
as obstacles, multipath fading, temperature and humidity variations, 
opening and closing of doors, furniture relocation, and the presence and 
mobility of human beings. Consequently, the value of RSSI recorded by 
the receiver could be much higher or lower than the anticipated value. 
Also, RSSI not only differs from the theoretical value but also fluctuates 
at the same position. Some factors affecting RSSI are described below:
 
• Multipath fading: Multipath fading occurs when the receiver sees 
the overlapping of multiple copies of the transmitted signal, each 
traversing a different path. This effect is caused when items such 
as people, chairs, desks, and other objects get in the way and 
cause the signal to bounce in different directions. A portion of the 
signal may go directly to the destination; another part may bounce 
from a chair to the ceiling and then to the destination. As a result, 
some of the signal encounters delay and travels a longer path to 
the receiver (see Figure 11-5). As a result, the RSSI value received 
by the receiver isn’t necessarily the value that can be used for 
locating.
 
• Time delay: An anomaly that goes hand in hand with multipath 
fading, time delay is the amount of timing variation among different 
radio frequency (RF) signals. Time delay can cause phase and 
polarization changes as well as multipath fading. Unlike multipath 
fading, which affects signal amplitude, time delay adversely affects 
the receiver’s ability to decode signals due to distortion.

• Aliasing: Another problem in using RSSI is aliasing, which occurs 
when several locations receive the same signal strength of an 
access point. Even worse, due to variations in the signal strength 
caused by obstacles, the two locations need not be the same 
distance from the access point. This partly explains why a simple 
trilateration of the position via the signal strength doesn’t lead to 
an accurate estimate because there are multiple positions with the 
same RSSI characteristics.
 
• Doppler effect: RF Doppler effects are created in two ways: 
relative motion between the transmitter and receiver, and RF 
non–line-of-sight conditions that alter the relative motion of the 
RF signals themselves and can prevent the receiver from decoding 
signals from a Wi-Fi tag. In the latter case, locating is done without 
data from one access point, and the results can get distorted.

195
 Chapter 11: Precision Locating with Local Area Coverage
 
✓ Difficult to fingerprint: For a fingerprint-match Wi-Fi RTLS (see the 
section, “RSSI-based Wi-Fi RTLS,” earlier in this chapter), someone has 
to collect data to see how RSSI looks like in relation to real locations. 
This method has the following limitations:
 
• Effort in calibration: Calibration isn’t a big deal if you’re calibrating 
for a small office space, but it becomes increasingly complex to 
calibrate for a large space, such as a 50-story building.
 
• Dynamic environment: Several environment issues — such as 
failing access points, structures that block signals, new partitions, 
and more people — may affect the quality of a fingerprint-match 
database, so the database must be rebuilt more often, which takes 
additional time and cost.
 
✓ Interference: Many other types of devices emit in the 2.4 GHz (the ISM 
[industrial, scientific, medical] unlicensed) band. These devices include 
microwave ovens, cordless phones, Bluetooth devices, wireless video 
cameras, outdoor microwave links, wireless game controllers, ZigBee 
devices, fluorescent lights, WiMAX, and so on.
 
✓ Security: Many of the network attacks discussed in Chapter 15 could 
be executed against a Wi-Fi RTLS, including jamming, blocking, man-
in-the-middle, and denial-of-service attacks. In addition, you need the 
ability to locate rogue access points or rogue Wi-Fi clients. Rogue Wi-Fi cli-
ents or access points are the ones that aren’t authorized and are trying 
to intercept traffic or steal passwords, steal security parameters, and 
launch attacks.
Locating with Bluetooth
Bluetooth is a wireless networking standard designed for low power 
consumption and communication in a personal area networking (PAN) 
environment. Many cell phones are Bluetooth-enabled, for example. The 
technology wasn’t designed to perform locating, but Bluetooth devices are 
ideal for locating because they contain a mechanism to identify their 
neighbors and communicate with other devices in the area.
How Bluetooth is used for precision locating
The working principle of a Bluetooth RTLS can be described as
 
1. Bluetooth access points are similar to Wi-Fi access points but installed 
more sparsely (typically, 10–15 meters apart).

196
Part III: Tag-A-Palooza: RTLS Technology Tour 
 
2. Bluetooth tags could be standalone tags; built-in features of computers, 
PDAs, cell phones, and other devices; or expansion cards that can be 
added to other devices.
 
3. To compute location, the location engine instructs all the Bluetooth 
access points to either find all nearby tags or find a specific tag:
 
• Find all nearby tags: To find all nearby tags, use the Bluetooth 
inquiry procedure. The inquiry procedure enables a Bluetooth 
device to discover which devices are in range and then determine 
the addresses and clocks for the devices. An inquiry process 
typically takes 5–10 seconds and gives the inquirer (the access 
point) the IDs of all the Bluetooth devices (tags) within its RF 
range.
 
• Find a specific tag: To find a specific tag, use the Bluetooth paging 
procedure. By making use of the paging procedure, the inquirer 
(access point) can page (set up a connection with) one or more of 
its discovered neighbors (tags). A paging process typically takes 
1–2 seconds. This mechanism is faster than inquiry procedure but 
requires a previous knowledge of the tag’s ID and clock information 
(as obtained by the inquiry procedure).
 
4. The Bluetooth access points report the tag’s RSSI to the location engine.
 
5. The location engine makes use of proximity, trilateration, or fingerprinting 
to determine the location. Because Bluetooth is RF-based and operates 
in the same frequencies as Wi-Fi, for detailed descriptions of these 
methods, see the earlier section, “RSSI-based Wi-Fi RTLS.”
Bluetooth frequencies
Bluetooth operates on the 2.4 GHz band, which 
is the same as Wi-Fi, cordless phones, and vari-
ous other wireless devices.
Bluetooth makes use of FHSS, Frequency 
Hopping Spread Spectrum. In FHSS, a device 
will use one of 79 different, randomly chosen 
frequencies within an assigned range and 
will frequently change frequencies from one 
to another. Bluetooth-enabled devices hop 
frequencies 1,600 times per second. As a result, 
more devices can use a portion of the radio 
spectrum. Bluetooth devices also make use 
of Adaptive Frequency Hopping (AFH) to avoid 
crowded frequencies or to avoid channels that 
have bad quality of wireless signal.
Typical Bluetooth device transmission power 
is 1 milliwatt for devices with a 1-meter range, 
2.5 milliwatts for devices with a 10-meter range, 
and 100 milliwatts for devices with a 100-meter 
range.

Bluetooth RTLS pros and cons
Using Bluetooth for an RTLS offers the following advantages:
 
✓ Standards-based: A Bluetooth RTLS is a standards-based approach that 
translates to more choices and interoperability features in a multiple-
vendor solution, which usually results in lower prices.
 
✓ Low power consumption: Bluetooth is a low-power technology.
 
✓ Tracking without tags: With growing categories of devices using built-in 
Bluetooth, organizations can track other assets (such as Bluetooth-
enabled PDAs, mobile phones, and laptops) without attaching tags to 
them.
 
✓ High accuracy: Because Bluetooth access points are placed relatively 
close to each other, location accuracy is about 2 meters.
 
✓ Multipurpose network: Bluetooth infrastructure is a multipurpose 
network and provides additional services, such as remote monitoring 
and control, voice, and Internet Protocol (IP) services (although Wi-Fi is 
more suitable for IP services).
Bluetooth for an RTLS also has some disadvantages:
 
✓ Short range: Because Bluetooth range is short, access points need to be 
installed every 15–20 meters.
 
✓ Security: Many network attacks, which I discuss in Chapter 15, could 
be executed against a Bluetooth RTLS, including jamming, blocking, and 
denial-of-service attacks.
 
✓ Slow response: Due to the Bluetooth inquiry process, the positioning 
delay is about 15–30 seconds.
Locating using passive RFID
Because passive RFID tags have no batteries and are typically very small in 
size, they’re an attractive choice for precision locating. Although there are 
many passive RFID (radio frequency identification) technologies (which I 
discuss in Chapter 8), the focus of precision locating is on EPC Gen 2 tags 
(EPCglobal UHF Class 1 Generation 2, a standard approved for passive RFID in 
2004).

198
Part III: Tag-A-Palooza: RTLS Technology Tour 
Many real-time location systems that use EPC Gen 2 tags are commercially 
available or in the research phase. EPC Gen 2 tag locating is implemented 
with the tightly coupled model or distributed model, both of which are covered 
in the following sections.
Tightly coupled model
This is the conventional model in which EPC Gen 2 tags are read by RFID 
interrogators (or readers). The working principle of this model can be 
described as
 
1. One or more RFID interrogators are installed in the area where precision 
locating is desired. Each interrogator has one or more antenna connected 
to it. All antennas are placed such that at the same location, a tag can 
be read by multiple antennas. Note: The passive RFID reader’s range is 
directly proportional to the size of the reader antenna or antenna on the 
tag; the range typically is 20 feet, but some large passive RFID tags can 
be read up to 50 feet.
 
2. The location engine instructs the readers to read specific tags or all tags 
in the area.
 
3. Readers read tags and record the RSSI of tags read. Readers then forward 
the tag data and RSSI data to the location engine.
 
 Not all passive RFID readers from various vendors report RSSI. Verify 
this feature with your vendor.
 
4. The location engine computes the tag locations by trilateration with the 
antenna location and RSSI values.
 
Gen 2 protocol anticipates situations where there are several readers 
simultaneously reading the same tag. Up to four separate readings of the same 
tag can be undertaken simultaneously without interference — and without 
having to wait for any one reader to complete its read.
Tightly coupled model pros and cons
The tightly coupled model for locating using EPC Gen 2 tags makes an 
excellent solution for precision locating of smaller things (when it’s 
extremely important to have a really small tag size) in smaller zones (for 
example, locating surgical equipment in an operating room).
Here are a few advantages of this model:
 
✓ Low tag cost: EPC Gen 2 tags are at very low order costs, a few cents.
 
✓ Embedding: Tags can be embedded easily in solid nonmetallic items 
(labels, pallets, cards, and so on).

199
 Chapter 11: Precision Locating with Local Area Coverage
 
✓ High throughput: High data throughput and a faster anticollision 
scheme facilitate higher read rates (typically 1,500 tags per second).
 
✓ Good accuracy: The tags can be located precisely with an accuracy of 
1 meter using three or more antennas.
The model has a few disadvantages also:
 
✓ Missing global standardization: No global standards and regulations 
exist for frequency.
 
✓ Environmental tolerance: UHF (ultra high frequency) RFID perform 
poorly around liquids and metals.
 
✓ Crowded frequency band: The 860–960 MHz range falls within the ISM 
(industrial, scientific, medical) band, making it one of the most crowded 
regions of the spectrum.
 
✓ Large number of required readers: If you want to locate in large areas, 
install a large number of readers throughout the facility.
 
✓ High network traffic: The system generates significant network traffic 
because the location engine needs to communicate with all readers in 
the facility at the same time.
 
✓ Extended location-engine capabilities: The location engine needs to 
have business logic to produce results in the presence of cross-reads of 
RFID tags by multiple readers.
Distributed model
In the distributed model, the two activities of RFID readers — providing 
energy to tags to power-up and reading the tags — are separated. The 
working principle of this model can be described as
 
1. Instead of deploying RFID interrogators, multiple transmit devices and 
one receiver device are installed in the area where precision locating 
is desired. The purpose of transmitters is to energize (power-up) the 
tags, and the purpose of receivers is to read the tag signals. The range 
of transmitters is typically 20–30 feet, and the receiver’s range is much 
larger (200,000 square feet, for example). Typically, the receiver makes 
use of smart antennas, space-time array techniques, and so on to 
detect very faint signals across vast distances in an extremely noisy RF 
environment.
 
2. The location engine instructs the transmit devices to excite the tags in 
its range (such as providing the tags energy so that they can respond).
 
3. Tags transmit their information by backscatter.

200
Part III: Tag-A-Palooza: RTLS Technology Tour 
 
4. The RFID receiver reads the resulting tag signals from a distance and 
forwards this information to the location engine that computes location.
Distributed model pros and cons
The distributed model for locating with EPC Gen 2 tags makes an excellent 
solution for precision locating in large areas. All the advantages that are 
listed in the preceding section, “Tightly coupled model pros and cons,” 
apply, and additional advantages include
 
✓ Large areas: EPC Gen 2 tags can be precisely located in very large areas.
 
✓ Eliminates cross-reads: Because reads are done at a single point (the 
receiver) and transmit devices are there only to excite tags to transmit 
signals, it eliminates cross-reads (which is very common in tightly 
coupled model-based installations).
 
✓ Good accuracy: The tags can be precisely located with accuracy of 1 
meter with one receiver.
The disadvantages listed in the preceding section, “Tightly coupled model 
pros and cons,” apply for distributed model, in addition to the following:
 
✓ Missing global standardization: No global standards and regulations 
exist for frequency.
 
✓ Environmental tolerance: UHF RFID performs poorly around liquids and 
metals.
 
✓ Crowded frequency band: The 860–960 MHz range falls within the ISM 
band, making it one of the most crowded regions of the spectrum.
Using active RFID
Although the term active RFID can be used to describe almost any active tag 
that uses RF-based wireless technology — UWB, ZigBee, Bluetooth, 900 MHz, 
Wi-Fi, and even cellular — the term has been traditionally used for closed 
loop active RFID systems.
The most commonly used frequencies by active RFID-based locating systems 
are listed in Table 11-2.

Many applications with active RFID for RTLS have been around for decades. 
Following are a few RTLS applications that use active RFID-based systems:
 
✓ Road toll: Nonstop road tolling for vehicles with readers deployed at 
tollbooths and tags in the vehicles.
 
✓ Area monitoring: This includes many applications, such as collecting 
real-time inventory information within a warehouse, monitoring the 
security of ocean containers or trailers stored in a yard, monitoring the 
location of air cargo containers across an air terminal or tarmac, and 
so on.
 
✓ Logistics: This includes many applications in the field of logistics, such 
as tracking of luggage, transporting of frozen food and pharmaceutical 
products, and so on.
 
✓ Security: Access controls for goods and persons.
 
No single frequency is ideal for all applications, even within a single industry. 
And, implementations for RTLS products based on the same frequency vary, 
also.

202
Part III: Tag-A-Palooza: RTLS Technology Tour 
Because frequencies affect the cost, size, and performance of your RTLS, 
to select the optimal radio frequency for your specific application need, 
consider the following guidelines:
 
✓ Lower frequencies propagate (or travel) farther than signals at higher 
frequencies (assuming similar transmitter power levels). This is in 
general true for frequencies greater than 100 MHz. Systems less than 100 
MHz depend upon inductive coupling (which I describe in Chapter 8), and 
the coupling range drops sharply with distance. Also, lower frequencies 
propagate better through crowded environments because that signal 
can diffract around an object when the wavelength approaches the 
size of the object (lower frequency means higher wavelength). For 
example, at 433 MHz the wavelength is 69.28 cm, enabling signals to 
diffract around obstructions, such as vehicles. At 2.4 GHz, the wave-
length is approximately 12.5 cm, and diffraction is very limited with 
these obstructions, creating areas of limited coverage. However, it’s 
important to note that range is also a factor of power used for transmis-
sion as well as shape, size, and directionality of the antenna used.
 
✓ Higher frequencies have higher data transfer rates. This means that 
the tags can be read at higher rates and large quantities of data can be 
sent between tags and receivers in a very short time. In an industrial 
application, it may be required to process the location of thousands 
of employees (and visitors, if any) with an accuracy between 1 and 3 
meters, every second.
How active RFID is used for an RTLS
Because active RFID-based solutions are mostly proprietary, implementations 
from different vendors vary. Typical models of implementation with active 
RFID are either with actively transmitting tags or actively listening tags.
In cases of actively transmitting tags:
 
1. Active RFID tags continuously chirp, or send signals at a preset 
frequency, say every 10 seconds.
 
2. These signals are received by active RFID readers installed in ceilings or 
walls.
 
3. The active RFID readers take measurements, such as Time of Flight 
(ToF), Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI), Time of Arrival (TOA), 
and Angle of Arrival (AOA), of these signals and then forward these 
measurements to the central location engine.
 
4. The central location engine computes the location with an applicable 
technique, such as trilateration, fingerprinting, and so on.

203
 Chapter 11: Precision Locating with Local Area Coverage
And, in cases of actively listening tags:
 
1. Active RFID tags periodically wake up (say, every 2 seconds) to listen for 
any messages from the active RFID readers.
 
2. Upon receiving signals, these tags do one of the following:
 
• Take measurements, such as TOF or RSSI, of these signals and then 
forward these measurements to the location engine by using a 
back-end network, or the tags just signal.
 
• Send signals that are received by RFID readers that take 
measurements, TOF, RSSI, TOA, and AOA, of these signals and 
then forward these measurements to the central location engine.
 
3. The central location engine computes the location with an applicable 
technique, such as trilateration, fingerprinting, and so on.
Active RFID RTLS pros and cons
The key advantage of using active RFID for an RTLS is that it offers a business 
focus. The whole argument for closed loop applications is solving a business 
problem — quickly and effectively. The other advantages include
 
✓ Overlay network: Because the active RFID RTLS uses a separate 
infrastructure (location sensors), the existing infrastructure (the 
network deployed for data, video, voice, and so on) isn’t impacted by 
the RTLS application.
 
✓ Innovative solutions: Because vendors aren’t forced to conform to an 
industry-wide standard, they typically come up with innovative solutions.
The model has also have several disadvantages:
 
✓ Missing global standardization: No global standards and regulations 
exist for an active RFID-based RTLS.
 
✓ Maintenance challenge: Because the active RFID RTLS uses a separate 
infrastructure (location sensors), this creates additional maintenance 
and support overhead for your IT.
 
✓ Multiple-vendor interoperability: These solutions typically don’t 
provide multiple-vendor interoperability. You may have a challenge 
when moving from one generation of products to the next.
 
✓ Supplier dependence: You’re at higher risk with sole-sourced solutions. 
Standards-based solutions enable you to buy interoperable systems 
from multiple vendors.
The security aspect of closed loop applications is often debated. Each side 
makes arguments and then refutes the arguments of the other side. In truth, 
neither is correct (or both are). See Chapter 15 on RTLS vulnerabilities to 
understand the security aspect of your RTLS application.

Using ultra-wideband (UWB)
Ultra Wideband (UWB or ultraband) is any radio technology that has 
bandwidth exceeding 500 MHz or 20 percent of the arithmetic center 
frequency, whichever is lower. UWB is a carrierless communication scheme. 
The early applications of UWB technology were primarily related to radar. 
Table 11-3 lists the categories of applications approved by the Federal 
Communications Commission (FCC) for UWB.

Air interface standards
Although an active RFID-based RTLS is typi-
cally a proprietary implementation, there are 
standards for using an air interface at different 
frequencies, and there’s an ISO (International 
Organization for Standardization) standard for 
the RTLS using 2.4GHz:
 ✓ ISO 18000-1: Generic Parameters for 
the Air Interface for Globally Accepted 
Frequencies
 ✓ ISO 18000-4: For 2.45 GHz
 ✓ ISO 18000-6: For 860–960 MHz
 ✓ ISO 18000-7: For 433 MHz
 ✓ ISO/IEC 24730: Defines two air interface 
protocols and a single application program 
interface (API) for the RTLS for use in asset 
management and is intended to allow for 
compatibility and to encourage interoper-
ability of products for the growing RTLS 
market. The ISO 24730 system uses tags 
that use 2.4 GHz, DSSS (Direct Sequence 
Spread Spectrum). These tags may also 
include low-frequency (125 kHz) tags to 
support an optional exciter mode (see 
Chapter 8) that allows tag location updates 
based on their proximity to an exciter. 
The method of location using a 2.4 GHz 
beacon is generally through trilateration 
with methodologies, such as TOF, RSSI, 
Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) and 
AOA; it also describes a third interface — 
On/Off Key (OOK) — that allows a tag to 
communicate with a handheld reader.

205
 Chapter 11: Precision Locating with Local Area Coverage
How UWB works
A UWB-based locating system is very much like any other RTLS except that 
it uses UWB signals. Here are the parts of a UWB-based locating system and 
descriptions of how they work:
 
✓ Tags: The tags send UWB pulses, which usually are short and have low 
repetition rates, typically 1–100 megapulses per second.
 
✓ UWB receivers (location sensors): UWB receivers extract timing (and 
sometimes angle) information from the UWB signals emitted from tags 
and send the information to the centralized location engine that computes 
the location.
 
 Two types of receivers are used, the first relatively complex and the 
second relatively simple:
 
• Coherent receiver: A coherent receiver counters the effects of 
multipath fading by using several subreceivers. Coherent receivers 
offer longer range, more accuracy, and better performance in noisy 
channel conditions.
 
 To collect energy in an intensely multipath environment, you must 
use a large number of subreceivers. In addition, you may require a 
high-speed precision clock. The solution is an expensive one.
 
• Non-coherent receiver: A non-coherent receiver is easy to use, 
but you experience reduced channel capacity. Depending on the 
application’s sensitivity to accuracy, non-coherent receivers may 
be acceptable, even though they may have shorter communication 
range, less accuracy, and inferior performance under certain 
channel conditions.
 
✓ Location engine: The location engine computes the location based on 
the tag-specific data received from different UWB receivers. As a UWB 
RTLS uses short pulses with low repetition rates, the location engine can 
compute location in a few ways:
 
• Angle of Arrival (AOA): The AOA technique (described in Chapter 
2) measures the angle of a signal between a given tag and different 
UWB receivers to estimate the location.
 
• Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) or Time of Arrival (TOA): Unlike 
conventional RF, UWB signals have very large bandwidths, which 
allows for extremely accurate location estimation using the TDOA 
or TOA approach (both discussed in Chapter 2).
UWB pros and cons
UWB-based positioning enjoys several advantages over other RTLS technologies:

206
Part III: Tag-A-Palooza: RTLS Technology Tour 
 
✓ High accuracy and penetration: UWB provides very accurate locating. 
Accuracy can be up to a few centimeters, and results can be produced 
in three dimensions. Location-aware applications can tell exactly which 
room a tracked person is in, which chair she’s seated in, and which mobile 
devices are closest to him or her so that the right responses can be made.
 
✓ Excellent performance in challenging RF environments: In highly 
reflective environments that have high metal content, such as manufac-
turing plants, UWB maintains excellent performance because of its short 
low-duty-cycle pulses.
 
✓ No interference with other RF systems: UWB tags can be used in close 
proximity to other RF signals because they don’t cause or suffer from 
interferences due to the differences in signal types and radio spectrum 
used.
 
✓ Relative immunity to multipath fading: Because UWB pulses are 
narrow and occupy the entire UWB bandwidth, UWB isn’t susceptible to 
multipath fading.
But the high accuracy advantages come at a cost:
 
✓ Need for line of sight or cables: Line of sight or timing cables between 
various UWB receivers may be required for time synchronization.
 
✓ Ranging errors: Although UWB is relatively immune to multipath fading, 
the key sources of ranging errors in a UWB RTLS are non–line-of-sight 
propagation and interference from signals from multiple tags and other 
UWB applications.
Understanding the 802.15.4a standard
Until recently, UWB was mostly a proprietary 
technology. Recently, however, IEEE approved 
the 802.15.4a standard for UWB. The IEEE 
802.15.4a standard for Wireless Personal Area 
Networks (WPAN) enables accurate range and 
distance estimation between communicating 
devices.
The 802.15.4a standard is crafted to allow the 
coexistence of coherent and non-coherent 
UWB radios in the same network. It specifies 
two optional signaling formats based on Impulse 
Radio UWB and Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS). 
The Impulse Radio UWB enables ranging capa-
bility, whereas the CSS signals can be used 
only for data communication.
The following list provides the frequency ranges 
used in impulse radio and CSS:
 ✓ Impulse Radio UWB: 250–750 MHz, 3:244–
4:742 GHz, or 5:944–10:234 GHz
 ✓ Chirp Spread Spectrum: 2:4–2:4835 GHz
In IEEE 802.15.4a terminology, the method 
of ranging is Two-Way Time of Arrival (TW-
TOA). This model is very similar to Round Trip 
Time (RTT, which I discuss in Chapter 2). In 
this model, the range between two devices is 
determined typically by one device sending a 
message to the other and then the other device 
turning around and sending the message back.

207
 Chapter 11: Precision Locating with Local Area Coverage
Using ZigBee
ZigBee is a technological standard created by the ZigBee Alliance for Control 
and Sensor Networks and is based on IEEE 802.15.4. ZigBee is a simple but 
flexible protocol that enables high throughput and low latency for low duty-cycle 
applications. Originally designed to control lights, switches, thermostats, 
appliances, and the like, ZigBee’s self-forming and self-healing mesh network 
architecture enables its use for an RTLS.
How ZigBee is used for locating
The working principle of a ZigBee RTLS can be described as follows:
 
1. The first step is to create a ZigBee mesh network. On start-up, the 
ZigBee coordinator node sets up the PAN network and starts allowing 
ZigBee routers (that is, location sensors affixed at well-known locations) 
or ZigBee end devices (tags attached to assets or carried by people) to 
join to it. Each ZigBee router, on the other hand, tries to join to a ZigBee 
router that has already joined the PAN or coordinator that is allowing 
joining. At the end of the mesh formation, each router has a path to the 
coordinator.
 
2. The tags (ZigBee end devices) try to join a router or coordinator that is 
allowing joining.
 
3. On demand or periodically, the tags take measurements such as TOA 
and RSSI value of signals from nearby ZigBee routers and send this 
information to the location engine through the coordinator.
 
4. The location engine computes the location using trilateration (by 
converting RSSI or TOA to distance) or fingerprinting (using RSSI). These 
methods are described in Chapter 2.
The ZigBee system is a self-healing mesh network, which means that it 
permits data and control messages to be passed from one node to other 
nodes via multiple paths. This way, ZigBee devices always can speak to the 
coordinator or location engine even if one path fails.
ZigBee pros and cons
ZigBee enjoys many advantages as an RTLS technology:
 
✓ Standards-based: The ZigBee part of the standard guarantees 
interoperability of equipment from different manufacturers, which 
usually results in lower prices.
 
✓ Excellent performance in harsh environments: ZigBee technology 
relies on IEEE 802.15.4, which has excellent performance in low SNR 
(signal-to-noise-ratio) environments.
 
✓ Fast locating: ZigBee end devices join or reroute on failures of path very 
quickly (under 30 milliseconds), enabling fast locating.

208
Part III: Tag-A-Palooza: RTLS Technology Tour 
 
✓ Low cost tags: ZigBee transceivers are inexpensive.
 
✓ Fault tolerant: ZigBee achieves reliability through mesh networking. 
If one path stops working, a new path is automatically discovered and 
used without stopping the system operation.
 
✓ High battery life: ZigBee transceivers are very power efficient as a 
result of the short working period, low power consumption of 
communication, and near zero power consumptions in standby mode.
 
✓ Large network capacity: ZigBee supports complex, self-healing mesh 
networks with as many as 65,000 nodes.
ZigBee has the following disadvantages:
 
✓ Limitations of RSSI: Being in the same spread spectrum as technology 
like Wi-Fi, ZigBee faces the same limitations with respect to RSSI as 
Wi-Fi. RSSI is affected by various environmental features, such as 
obstacles, multipath fading, temperature and humidity variations, 
opening and closing of doors, furniture relocation, and the presence 
and mobility of human beings (see the earlier section, “Wi-Fi RTLS 
pros and cons”).
 
✓ Interference: ZigBee operating in ISM bands has same interference 
issues as Wi-Fi (refer to the “Wi-Fi RTLS pros and cons” section, earlier 
in this chapter), including potential interference from Wi-Fi networks.
 
✓ Line-powered infrastructure: ZigBee mesh requires that the infrastructure 
nodes (ZigBee routers) are line-powered because mesh nodes always 
have to be scanning to pass on the messages from ZigBee end devices or 
other routers.
 
✓ Short range: ZigBee has a short range that necessitates a high number 
of ZigBee routers. The penetration of the signal through walls is very 
limited, so several routers must be placed in every room.
 
✓ Security: Many network attacks discussed in Chapter 15 could be 
executed against ZigBee RTLS, including jamming, blocking, and 
denial-of-service attacks.
 
Because ZigBee operates in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed band, if you have Wi-Fi 
deployed in your network or other devices operating in 2.4 GHz, you may 
want to do site surveys to plan the best channels for operation of your ZigBee 
network.
Using computer vision
Locating systems based on computer vision process image data, typically 
obtained using live cameras, to determine location of assets or people. Image 
data can take many forms such as still images, video feeds, views from mul-
tiple cameras, data from medical scanners, and so on.

209
 Chapter 11: Precision Locating with Local Area Coverage
Computer-vision locating is typically used in circumstances where it isn’t 
possible to attach explicit tags to people or assets.
Following are some RTLS applications that use computer vision:
 
✓ Drowning-detection systems: By using computer vision (deploying 
overhead and/or underwater cameras), you can provide constant pool 
surveillance, enabling lifeguards to monitor what’s happening in the 
pool and quickly initiate a rescue and save a life. Resuscitation of 
drowning victims must be initiated as quickly as possible — ideally, 
within 30 seconds.
 
✓ Unusual event detection: By using computer vision (multiple cameras), 
you can create a system that detects unusual events and alerts you 
when the visual patterns are significantly different from the baseline. 
This feature can be used in security applications in curfew areas, banks, 
and government buildings, for example.
 
✓ Human tracking: Human tracking can be used to track criminals in 
crowded environments, as well as to locate lost people, such as children 
in a shopping mall.
 
✓ Vehicle tracking and traffic surveillance: Video image processing can 
yield traffic parameters such as flow, velocity, lane changes, and vehicle 
trajectories, providing better traffic information.
ZigBee frequencies
ZigBee operates in three unlicensed frequency 
bands that include 16 channels at 2.4 GHz, ten 
channels at 902–928 MHz, and one channel 
at 868–870 MHz. The maximum data rates for 
each band are 250 kbps, 40 kbps, and 20 kbps, 
respectively.
 ✓ 868.3 MHz: 1 Channel (Channel 0); operates 
in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and the 
Americas.
 ✓ 902–928 MHz: 10 Channels (Channel 1–10 
2 MHz gap); operates in Europe, Australia, 
New Zealand, and the Americas.
 ✓ 2405–2480 MHz: 16 Channels (Channel 
11–26 5 MHz gap); operates worldwide.
Like Wi-Fi, ZigBee uses Direct Sequence 
Spread Spectrum (DSSS). O-QPSK modulation 
with a 32 PN-code length and an RF bandwidth 
of 2 MHz is used in the 2.4 GHz band. BPSK 
modulation with a 15 PN-code length (and an RF 
bandwidth of 600 kHz in Europe and 1200 kHz in 
North America) is used in the 868.3 and 902–928 
MHz bands.

210
Part III: Tag-A-Palooza: RTLS Technology Tour 
How computer vision works
The working principle of computer vision locating systems can be described 
as follows:
 
1. Image data is sent from cameras (still image cameras or video cameras) 
to the location engine or application software over the network (wired 
or wireless).
 
 No tags are required.
 
2. The location engine or application software analyzes received images 
from one or more cameras for specific patterns. The accuracy of the 
location engine depends upon the image resolution, environmental 
conditions, and specifications of the applications. Depending upon the 
application, the accuracy can be of an order of a few centimeters.
 
The pattern-recognition methods used by the location engine in computer-
vision systems have to be designed according to the specific application. The 
algorithms that work for human-head detection aren’t the same as the ones 
needed for fire detection, for example.
Computer vision pros and cons
Several commercial and non-commercial systems perform computer-vision 
locating, but the generic vision problem is far from being solved. No existing 
system can come close to emulating the capabilities of a human, however 
specialized the tasks that computer vision can accomplish.
Other applications of computer vision
Image and video content understanding and 
analysis methods have been studied by many 
researchers for over two decades, and the 
recent enormous improvements in visible cam-
eras, infrared cameras, and medical imagers 
have led to an explosion of applications. One 
of the most prominent applications of computer 
vision is in the medical field where image data 
is in the form of ultrasonic images, microscopy 
images, X-ray images, colonoscopic video, and 
so on. Computer vision is used to detect and 
locate benign and malignant tumors in x-ray 
images, digital mammograms, colonoscopic 
videos, and so on.
Some other examples of using computer vision 
include robotic control of an unmanned lunar 
rover; locating fruits in trees for robotic har-
vesting; using surveillance cameras (such as 
“red-light cameras” to enforce traffic laws); 
and fire and flame detection in auditoriums, 
tunnels, and atriums where conventional 
smoke and fire detectors can’t be used.

211
 Chapter 11: Precision Locating with Local Area Coverage
Computer vision–based locating systems offer several advantages:
 
✓ No tags needed: Because information about the object is extracted from 
the image itself, no tags need to be attached to assets or carried by 
people.
 
✓ Security: Because it is difficult to manipulate live feeds, it isn’t easy to 
defeat the system without raising alerts.
 
✓ Long range: Because depth of field (the portion of a scene that appears 
sharp in the image) can be anywhere from a fraction of a millimeter to 
virtually infinite, computer-vision locating systems can locate at long 
ranges.
Some of the disadvantages of computer-vision locating systems are as follows:
 
✓ Environment dependency: The quality of images by cameras depends 
upon environmental conditions such as light levels, fog, gases, rain, and 
so on.
 
✓ Application dependency: Because the algorithms used depend upon 
the application, design and development efforts are required for every 
new application. What works in one environment for one application 
may not work for another.
 
✓ Camera infrastructure: An extensive number of cameras might be 
required to achieve locating. The number of cameras needed depends 
upon the requirements and specifications of the application.
 
✓ High network bandwidth: Transferring high-resolution images or video 
from cameras to the location engine requires large network bandwidth. 
This may necessitate adding more back-end network infrastructure 
capacity.
 
✓ Expensive to deploy: The deployment of a computer-vision locating 
system typically involves high-resolution cameras, installation costs, 
and high-performance computers for real-time processing of images 
received.
Using acoustic locating systems
Acoustic locating systems are based on sounds, usually listening for well-defined 
sounds such as weapon fire. Because sound waves can bend (refract) as they 
travel through the air, and because sound can travel as far as a mile or more 
from its origin, acoustic location systems can detect sound events at long 
ranges and don’t require line of sight. Following are some sample applications 
that use an acoustic RTLS:

212

✓ Counter-sniper systems: Military personnel are often most vulnerable in 
stationary environments, and locating snipers can prevent casualties.
 
✓ Public safety: Knowing the precise locations of incidents involving guns 
speeds police response and enables targeted enforcement strategies, 
from manned surveillance to violence-suppression and threat-reduction 
missions.
How an acoustic RTLS works
In the acoustic locating systems, the working principle can be described as 
follows:
 
1. Typically no tag is used and the object located is the object creating 
the sound. A tag that acts as an active source of sound can be attached, 
however.
 
2. Sensors (either wireless or wired) listen for sounds constantly and 
report any acoustic anomalies or patterns to the location engine. For 
gunfire detection, for example, these sensors are deployed across wide 
areas (say 20–25 per square mile).
 
3. The location engine performs acoustic trilateration based on the 
locations of the acoustic sensors and the sound volumes.
 
The accuracy of locating depends upon the distance between the acoustic 
sensors and the source of sound, as well as the amount of noise in the 
environment at the time the sound is generated. The accuracy of locating in 
gunfire-locating systems is typically of the order of 25 meters.
Acoustic RTLS pros and cons
Although acoustic locating has limited applications, it offers several 
advantages:
 
✓ No tags needed: Because the object located is the object creating the 
sound, typically no tags need to be attached to assets or carried by 
people. This is especially useful for applications such as detecting the 
location of gunfire.
 
✓ No line of sight needed: Because sound waves can bend (refract) as 
they travel through the air, sensors can detect the noise around corners 
and over hills.
 
✓ Long range: Because sound can travel as far as a mile or more from 
its origin, acoustic location systems can detect sound events at long 
ranges.

213
 Chapter 11: Precision Locating with Local Area Coverage
Some of the disadvantages of acoustic locating systems are as follows:
 
✓ Interference: Because environments contain a variety of noises, 
acoustic locating can be used only for special sounds (and acoustic 
anomalies can give false positives).
 
✓ Scalability: Acoustic locating can be used only when there are a very 
limited number of sound sources.
 
✓ Easy to defeat: Acoustic locating for special applications such as gunfire 
detection may be defeated by use of suppressors or silencers.
 
✓ Limited applications: Using tags that make sounds isn’t a suitable 
choice for asset or people locating.
Using building illumination
Because light conditions are dependent on location, researchers have been 
investigating the use of solar cell–based tags to track light levels and do real-
time locating. The key advantage, as in powerline positioning (as discussed in 
Chapter 9) and dead reckoning (as discussed earlier in this chapter), is that 
the technology is minimally invasive. The location is computed by using the 
existing lighting levels in the building.
How building illumination works
The working principle of an illumination-based locating system can be 
described as follows:
 
1. Tags are typically dual mode — they have a solar cell and back-end 
network interface (such as Wi-Fi).
 
2. The solar cells detect changes in the radiant intensity and communicate 
this information to the location engine by using the back-end network 
interface.
 
3. The patterns of radiant intensity in different parts of the building are 
recorded as part of the installation, and the database of these patterns 
is made available to the location engine.
 
4. The location engine determines the location of tag as the location in the 
database that has the closest match to the radiant intensity reported by 
the tag.

214
Part III: Tag-A-Palooza: RTLS Technology Tour 
Building illumination pros and cons
Extracting context data from indoor lights has several advantages:
 
✓ Easy installation: No wiring, cabling, or installation of additional 
infrastructure (location sensors) is needed.
 
✓ Small tags: Solar cells can be produced in thin (less than 1 millimeter 
thick), low-weight layers.
 
✓ No batteries needed: Because the solar cells are energy-harvesting 
devices, the tags have no battery-life issues.
Because the locating accuracy in this approach depends upon the scene 
analysis based on the radiant intensity reported by tags, the location engine 
algorithms face many challenges, including the following:
 
✓ Natural light: The presence of natural light from windows may significantly 
influence radiant intensity reported by the tags.
 
✓ Uniform intensity: Many buildings, such as hospitals, have similar lighting 
conditions in many rooms. The location engine might not be able to 
differentiate the patterns of radiant intensity from one room to another.
 
✓ Orientation of tags: The radiant intensity as seen by tags also depends 
upon the orientation of tags.
 
✓ Dynamic environments: The radiant intensity as seen by tags is also 
affected by shadows, reflections, and movement in dynamic environments.
 
✓ Change of lights: Because the location engine depends upon prerecorded 
radiant intensities, changes in types and power of lights have to be 
taken into account.
 
✓ Aging of lights: As lights become old or dirt accumulates, the radiant 
intensity of their light reduces. You may not notice these reductions, but 
they can adversely impact the accuracy of the location engine.
Using solar cells as batteries
Because solar cells could be used to not only 
detect and report the radiant intensity, but 
also to harvest solar energy, it is possible to 
have tags that don’t need additional batteries. 
However, without a battery, it may not be 
possible to use a generic back-end network 
interface (such as Wi-Fi) because the solar cell 
lacks enough power.
The tags in that case can do only low-power, 
small-range RF transmissions. In this scenario, 
additional RF receivers can be used that could 
be carried by people, attached to assets, or 
installed throughout the facility. The location 
of these RF receivers isn’t important, because 
it just communicates the information reported 
from the solar tag to the location engine.

Chapter 12
Presence-Based Locating
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding how presence-based locating works
▶ Recognizing the value of presence-based locating
S
ometimes, you don’t need to know the actual location of a person or 
asset — just whether that person or asset is in the area. Presence-based 
locating does just that. It just indicates availability (yes or no).
When you take inventory of your products, for example, you just need to 
know whether the product is on the premises. Or for example, after the 
workday is over, you may want to turn on the security alarms or turn off the 
lights to conserve energy after you confirm by presence-based locating that 
all employees have left the building.
Presence-based locating is one of the simplest forms of RTLS and you can 
use many of the technologies that I discuss in Chapters 8 through 11 to do 
presence-based locating. In this chapter, I explain how to achieve presence-
based locating and offer you some examples of real-world applications of the 
technology.
Detecting Presence
Presence and location are two critical qualities associated with any asset or 
person. Presence indicates availability (yes or no), and location indicates 
exact position.
Some applications detect presence by using room- or subroom-level locating. 
Other applications use precision or choke-point locating, which are at the 
sharp end of location-based technologies that detect presence. Because 
detecting presence limits the applications you use to ones that don’t need 
precise or symbolic location, you should try to implement it with a minimal 
investment and/or minimal infrastructure.
The following sections cover fixed and minimal infrastructure solutions for 
detecting presence.

216
Part III: Tag-A-Palooza: RTLS Technology Tour 
Powerline positioning
As discussed in Chapter 9, powerline positioning is an inexpensive way of 
locating (except for the manual labor cost of fingerprinting). In powerline 
positioning, you don’t need to deploy any location sensors except for a few 
radio frequency (RF) generators that are connected to power outlets in the 
building. These power generators add RF in the power lines that can be 
detected by RF detectors (tags).
For accurate locating, you need to do significant fingerprinting for a powerline-
based RTLS, but for presence-based locating, the system can be installed 
trivially with no or minimal fingerprinting. Whenever a power-positioning tag 
detects the expected RF in the powerlines around it, it communicates that 
information to the location engine by using Wi-Fi or any other wireless data 
network, informing the application that a tag is present in the building.
Wi-Fi
If you have Wi-Fi deployed in the building for data network, you can use Wi-Fi 
tags to enable presence-based locating. You can’t use a Wi-Fi data network 
for precision locating because the margin of error can be anywhere from 
10–30 meters, but you don’t care about this range if you are just looking for 
presence.
For more details on a Wi-Fi RTLS, see Chapter 11.
Building illumination
As I explain in Chapter 11, building illumination can be used to locate tags 
accurately in the building. In building illumination, you don’t need to deploy 
any location sensors, and solar-based tags are located based on scene 
analysis (fingerprinting of illumination characteristics in the building).
For precision locating, you need to do significant fingerprinting for a 
building-illumination–based RTLS. For presence-based locating, however, 
the system can be installed with limited fingerprinting of entrance and exit 
areas. The tags continually capture the fingerprints of the surrounding light 
and send the data back to the location engine via Wi-Fi or any other wireless 
data network, informing the application when a tag is leaving or entering the 
building.

217
 Chapter 12: Presence-Based Locating
Mobile locating
Mobile locating is an RTLS solution in which assets or people are located 
without making use of fixed infrastructure (location sensors). Tags are 
attached to assets or carried by people and are located by a mobile device. 
The location is usually in the form of presence, and range depends upon the 
technology. Mobile locating can be achieved using many of the technologies 
that I discuss in Chapters 8 through 11. Here are just a few examples:
 
✓ Passive RFID (Gen 2, UHF): In this case, a mobile passive RFID reader 
is used for locating passive RFID tags. The range is typically up to 10 
meters (although it can be more or less based on the antenna size and 
characteristics). A typical example is checking inventory of passive RFID 
tagged items on shelves in a retail store.
 
✓ Passive HF: In this case, a mobile passive HF reader is used for locating 
passive HF tags. The range is typically up to 3 meters (although it can 
be more or less based on the antenna size and characteristics). A 
typical example is using HF tags on vials of drugs to reduce the likelihood 
of theft and human error, because the drugs are expensive and can 
cause severe harm if administered incorrectly.
 
✓ Wi-Fi: By exploring the ad-hoc capabilities of Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi tags can be 
located by any Wi-Fi–enabled handheld. A typical application is locating 
children or other family members by making use of a Wi-Fi–enabled cell 
phone.
 
✓ Active UHF: In this case, a mobile active UHF reader (for example 915 
MHz or 433 MHz) is used for locating active UHF tags. The range is 
typically 100 meters (although it can be more or less based on the 
antenna size, shape, and frequency used). A typical mobile application is 
using active UHF tags attached to assets and a handheld using an active 
UHF reader module for finding those assets.
Using Presence-Based Applications
A system installed to enable accurate locating may lead to increased stress 
among employees, because they may become wary about taking breaks or 
talking to co-workers. A presence-based system is a valuable alternative 
because exact location of employees isn’t known. Employees feel secure, and 
you can still enable safety, efficiency, and security applications.

218
Part III: Tag-A-Palooza: RTLS Technology Tour 
The following list describes different applications that track the presence of 
staff:
 
✓ Building security: Usually, you have no way to securely lock a building 
automatically when the last person in the building leaves for the day. 
However, if all employees carry active tags that can be detected for 
presence, the security system can be activated automatically.
 
✓ Saving energy: Energy-saving operations — such as turning all the lights 
off or turning heating or air-conditioning to a more appropriate level — 
can be done when the last person leaves the building or specific area of 
the building, such as a conference room.
 
✓ Evacuation management: Presence-based locating can enable the 
evacuation management application to determine if all employees and 
visitors have left the building (if all employees and visitors wear the 
tags), as well as if they’ve assembled in the muster areas.
 
✓ Visitor control: By providing tags to visitors, you can ensure that all 
visitors have left the building and prevent security violations.
The following list discusses different applications to track the presence of 
assets:
 
✓ Inventory check: By placing tags on products and items, you can use 
presence-based locating to recount (check) the inventory at any time.
 
✓ Asset inventory: An asset inventory application is used to determine 
the inventory levels of assets and take actions based on the results. For 
example, asset inventory in firetrucks helps the response team to ensure 
that all desired assets are in the truck at the time of dispatch or later.
 
✓ Room check: In hospitals, by attaching tags to various assets, the staff 
can do a quick check before a room is allocated to a patient to determine 
whether the room has all the desired equipment (assets), as well as to 
verify if any asset is present in the room that has been recalled.

Chapter 13
Locating by Associating
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding when locating by associating is necessary
▶ Getting to know the underlying technologies
▶ Exploring the practical applications of locating by associating
W
hen you report the location of a person or object by associating, 
you report the location of that object in reference to another object. 
For example, a child is near her mother, or the doctor is with a patient. A 
mountain rescue team searching for avalanche victims, for example, can use 
handheld computers to locate tags worn by victims. Each rescuer’s device 
reports a victim’s position relative to itself and thus helps the rescuers find 
the victims.
This chapter outlines other practical applications of locating by associating 
and explores the underlying technologies that make the model work.
Knowing When to Use Associations
Absolute locations can always be transformed into relative locations. If you 
know the absolute location of A as well as the absolute location of B, you 
probably can infer the relative distance between the two points, so potentially, 
you can use all the technologies and solutions that provide absolute locations 
to perform locating by associating (see Figure 13-1).

The locator can find the asset in reference
to his or her position or location.

D1
Absolute locations may not always be available, however, for reasons 
including the following:
 
✓ Technology deficiency (coverage holes): In this scenario, the RTLS 
technology is deployed, but the absolute location is unavailable for at 
least one tag, making it impossible to determine the relative location. 
For example, consider the scenario of two neighbors (each carrying a 
GPS tag) talking to each other, where one of them is standing in the lawn 
and other inside the house. Because GPS doesn’t work indoors, the only 
location available is the location of the neighbor in the lawn and you 
can’t establish that the two neighbors are standing close to each other. 
Another example is a coverage hole in Wi-Fi deployment that causes one 
of the tags to be not locatable.
 
✓ Large margin of error: The accuracy of absolute position determined by 
RTLS may be so big that even if absolute locations are available, they’re 
not useful for the application. If you’re using an RTLS that produces 
accuracy within 3–5 meters, for example, the margin of error for distance 
between the two tags located by the same RTLS is double — that is, 6–10 
meters, which may not be good enough for you to infer that the tags are 
close enough to each other.
 
✓ Inability to deploy RTLS technology for absolute locating: All locating 
systems compute the locations of tags by using location sensors as fixed 
reference points. In some tactical scenarios, however, deploying those 
sensors may not be practical. Consider a battleground scenario: A 
solution that depends on locating by associating may work reliably to 
determine whether a lieutenant is next to a tank.

221
 Chapter 13: Locating by Associating
One way to address these situations is to use tags that can communicate with 
each other (as shown in Figure 13-2), and another way is to use technologies 
where location sensors can be small and wearable (almost like tags). In the 
example in Figure 13-2, a tag reports information about itself and the tags 
around it to the location engine. Then the location engine uses this information 
to determine the relative locations of the tags. Also, if the location engine 
knows the absolute location of a tag, it can extrapolate the absolute locations 
of remaining tags. In this model, tags are the mobile points of reference for 
other tags.

203
Understanding the Underlying 
Technologies
Typically, to locate by associating, you need tags that can communicate 
not only information about themselves, but also information about their 
peer tags. You can use many of the technologies that I discuss in Chapters 8 
through 11 to locate by associating. Here are just a few examples:

222
Part III: Tag-A-Palooza: RTLS Technology Tour 
 
✓ Passive RFID: In this case, association is established between a mobile 
(typically wearable) RFID reader and passive RFID tags. Assets have 
passive RFID tags, and people carry mobile passive RFID readers. 
Because of the short range of the passive RFID reader (up to 10 meters), 
the location of a passive RFID tag is determined to be the location of the 
passive RFID reader. The location of the RFID reader is determined 
manually by the person (carrying the mobile RFID reader) or by 
embedding another RTLS tag (such as Wi-Fi) in the mobile RFID reader. 
The Wi-Fi RTLS is used to determine the location of the mobile RFID 
reader in the latter case. Passive RFID is discussed in detail in Chapter 11.
 
 A typical example for using this model is in warehouses where passive 
RFID tags are used on palettes and a mobile RFID reader is attached to 
the forklift truck. As the truck moves around, the locations of all palettes 
are automatically recorded for inventory and warehouse management.
 
✓ Wi-Fi: In Wi-Fi networks, ad-hoc mode allows Wi-Fi devices to discover 
and communicate directly with one another in peer-to-peer fashion, 
without the involvement of central access points. In this mode, a Wi-Fi 
tag (or device) can see whether another Wi-Fi tag is nearby. To estimate 
the distance, the tag can make use of RSSI (received signal strength 
indicator). If needed, the Wi-Fi tags can use Wi-Fi or any other backend 
network (such as GPRS) to communicate information about these 
associations (that is, tags in their proximity) to the location engine. 
A typical example can be doctors and patients all carrying Wi-Fi tags. 
Not only can the doctors and patients can be individually located using 
the Wi-Fi RTLS, but an association such as the doctor being next to a 
patient also can be established. Another example is a mother carrying a 
Wi-Fi–enabled phone and her child wearing a Wi-Fi tag; the mother can 
be sure that the child is always within a few meters or present nearby. 
A third example is a Wi-Fi phone detecting another Wi-Fi phone nearby. 
See Chapter 11 for more details on how Wi-Fi is used for an RTLS.
 
✓ ZigBee: A key component of the ZigBee protocol is the ability to support 
mesh networks where each node (ZigBee tag) is self-routing and can 
connect to other nodes as needed using mesh topology and ad-hoc 
routing. This association of tags can be used to infer location of any tag 
with reference to other tags. Using ZigBee for an RTLS is discussed in 
detail in Chapter 11.
 
✓ RuBee: The design of RuBee technology allows for peer-to-peer 
communications, not only between tags and routers, but also between 
tags themselves. In RuBee, the tags could serve as a reader, and this 
capability can be used to locate tags on the basis of association. For 
example, it’s easy to implement a medical billing application based on 
how long an IVF pump (with an attached RuBee tag) was located next to 
a patient (wearing a Rubee tag). Another application is an infant-security 
application that can ensure that the infant is always next to his or her 
mother or another authorized person (where all three wear a RuBee 
tag). RuBee is discussed in detail in Chapter 8.

223
 Chapter 13: Locating by Associating
 
✓ Bluetooth: In Bluetooth, any two Bluetooth-enabled devices (tags) 
can form an ad-hoc connection and establish a personal area network 
(known as a piconet), which can connect up to eight communicating 
devices, each identified by its MAC address. And when there is a need 
for more than eight active devices to form a network, two or more 
piconets can be connected together into what is known as a scatternet. 
This architecture of Bluetooth enables a location engine to determine 
which Bluetooth device is in which piconet or scatternet and the 
associations can be used to locate devices (tags) by association. A 
typical example is your cell phone’s Bluetooth earpiece beeping to 
inform you when it is moving farther away from the cell phone. 
Another example is Bluetooth devices installed in aisles of a retail store 
communicating about the specials and value deals to your Bluetooth-
enabled cell phone as you approach or walk through those aisles. See 
Chapter 11 for more details on how Bluetooth is used for an RTLS.
 
✓ Active RFID: Active RFID transceivers can be used to create proprietary 
mesh networks where the tags can listen as well as send messages to 
one another. The associations can also be established between mobile 
active RFID readers and active RFID tags. For example, typical active 
RFID tags transmitting at 915 MHz or 433 MHz can use received signal 
strength from peer tags to establish this association. These active RFID 
tags can make use of the same frequency (915 MHz or 433 MHz) or 
another backend network (such as Wi-Fi or GPRS) to communicate 
information about other tags in their proximity to the location engine. 
Active RFID is discussed in detail in Chapter 11.
Using Locating by Associating
As knowledge of proximity can be a very effective security indicator, locating 
by associating is good for applications such as loss or theft prevention. 
The following sections discuss different applications that use locating by 
associating.
Security applications
Security and access control are two of the key drivers for an RTLS. And 
because people and assets are becoming increasingly mobile, there is a 
strong demand for many security and access control applications using 
locating by association. The following list describes security applications for 
locating by associating:
 
✓ School trip security system: When children go for educational and other 
trips with their school, usually a teacher or guardian is assigned to small 

224
Part III: Tag-A-Palooza: RTLS Technology Tour 
group of students. By having a tag on each child and a tag worn by the 
guardian of each group, each guardian can ensure that all kids in his or 
her group are nearby.
 
✓ Prisoner transport security: The transport vehicle can have a tag that 
is constantly communicating over a wide area network (for example, 
using GPRS) to the control room and to each prisoner wearing a tag. The 
vehicle communicates to the control room whether all prisoners are in 
range and raises an alert if a prisoner moves out of range.
 
✓ Authentication: An asset or person can be allowed into or out of an 
area without raising an alarm whenever the asset or person is next to an 
authorized person.
 
✓ Tourist group travel management: For tourist groups, locating by 
associating can be used to ensure that all members of the group are 
together. Another example is used by families to ensure all members are 
accounted for during a visit to a crowded area such as an amusement 
park.
Safety applications
Locating by associating can be a very powerful tool in safety-critical applications 
when the risk of personal injury or equipment damage is a primary concern. 
A large number of accidents in the workplace result from collisions between 
personnel and machinery. If one tag (on the machinery) can reliably and 
accurately provide a distance measurement with another tag (on personnel), 
locating by associating can be used for early warning and prevention of 
probable collision. This system can help reduce the risk of accidents in the 
workplace and therefore provide a safer working environment, with lower 
downtime and liability risks. Applicable scenarios include mining (both 
aboveground and belowground), loading yards, train terminals, and anywhere 
else people or light vehicles coexist with heavy mobile machinery.
The following list describes a few safety applications that use locating by 
associating:
 
✓ Mining safety: A persistent area of concern in mine safety continues to 
be related to equipment. Many equipment-related injuries and fatalities 
can be related to haul trucks, belt conveyors, front-end loaders, and 
other such equipment. Because locating by associating doesn’t need 
any infrastructure, by attaching tags to equipment and by having people 
carry tags, their proximity can be detected very easily and that can be 
used to alert workers when they’re getting too close to machinery.

225
 Chapter 13: Locating by Associating
 
✓ Evacuation management: In many industrial facilities, it may not be 
possible or may be too expensive to deploy a locating infrastructure 
(such as location sensors). In this case, locating by associating can be 
used to ensure that all people have assembled in muster areas at times 
of evacuations or drills. A typical way to achieve this is by having a tag 
in the muster areas that determines the list of people (wearing tags) 
who have assembled in the muster area and communicating this 
information to the central server.
 
✓ Forklift safety: Though workplace health and safety requirements have 
been in place for decades, forklifts frequently cause accidents, some 
fatal, that result in convictions or fines for companies. Detecting when 
forklifts and personnel are in close proximity can alert the individuals 
in time and help prevent injuries. And, because locating by associating 
doesn’t need any infrastructure, this can be achieved anywhere.
Analytic applications
Because locating by associating can provide detailed data on who is near 
whom, it can be a very powerful tool for analytic applications. In healthcare, 
for example, it can be used to detect how long a nurse has attended to a 
patient. It also can be used in restaurants to detect how much time a server 
spends with a customer. The following list describes some analytic applications 
for locating by associating:
 
✓ Billing: A patient can be billed accurately based on how much time an 
IVF pump is on and next to the patient or how much time a caregiver 
spends with the patient.
 
✓ Customer-behavior monitoring: For example, if tags are attached to 
shopping carts or carried by shoppers, tags in various aisles can record 
how much traffic those aisles are seeing. This information can be used 
by analytic applications to rearrange aisles.
 
✓ Museums: Detecting the amount of time that visitors spend around each 
piece can help museum staff determine when to change arrangements.
Social-networking applications
Locating by associating can enable a host of social-networking applications. 
Knowing that a person in your social network is close to you can help you 
meet new people for dating, business, and friendship. Imagine walking into a 
meeting, classroom, party, bar, subway station, or airplane and knowing who 
in your network is already there.

226
Part III: Tag-A-Palooza: RTLS Technology Tour 
These applications are enabled by you and others in your social network 
who are carrying tags (typically integrated in Wi-Fi or Bluetooth enabled cell 
phones). When you move into proximity with someone who is in your social 
network, you can get alerts (typically on your phone). Because this application 
can be enabled without needing any external infrastructure, alerts based on 
your social network can be achieved in any situation.
To address privacy and safety concerns, people can control the visibility of 
their tags to others, as well as have the choice to opt in or out of the social 
network.

Monitoring 
Performance and 
Securing RTLS

In this part . . .
D
ue to the silent and invisible character of the tech-
nology that enables real-time locating of assets or 
people over the air, an RTLS introduces unique challenges 
to security and monitoring performance. I wrote this part 
to add extra emphasis on considering monitoring and 
security as part of your process when selecting an RTLS.
To dominate the process of achieving whatever things 
you wish with an RTLS, you need to monitor and measure 
what really matters. Chapter 14 details the what and the 
how of monitoring your RTLS, as well as a few metrics 
that can be used to measure and present performance of 
your RTLS.
Because good security is as important as good perfor-
mance, in Chapter 15, I enable you to make the right 
choice of technology and prepare you should the day 
arise when you’re forced to look for intruders or take 
countermeasures.

Chapter 14
Measuring RTLS Performance
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding metrics
▶ Knowing the quality of the end-user experience
▶ Measuring operational functionality
▶ Establishing objectives for your application
W
hen you measure performance, you identify the difference between 
what you’ve planned and what actually happens. Monitoring and 
measuring the performance of an RTLS can be challenging, especially with 
all the tags, location sensors, technology intricacies, and interdependencies 
within your organization’s infrastructure. There’s a lot to keep track of.
This chapter describes the performance aspects you need to monitor and 
measure in order to determine whether your RTLS is working the way you 
need it to work.
Defining the Metrics
Having the right performance metrics — in this case, a list of performance 
benchmarks you want to measure — helps you monitor and manage the 
performance of the RTLS and the application associated with it. Metrics also 
help you manage how end users are using the application. With the right 
performance metrics, you can monitor the inner workings of your RTLS 
closely enough to ensure performance improvements.
Think of the metrics as your scoreboard. For example, if the objective was to 
reduce losing assets, the number of assets lost per year is a good metric. If 
the objective was to find assets, average and median time to find an asset are 
good metrics. And, along with this set of indicators that directly correlate to 
your application objective, you may want to establish certain other key 
performance metrics (also known as Key Performance Indicators, KPI) to 
collect all the data you need to take corrective actions, if any are needed.

230
Part IV: Monitoring Performance and Securing RTLS 
RTLS metrics are divided into three categories:
 
✓ End-user experience
 
✓ Operational excellence
 
✓ Application objective
And with each metric, you need to define various thresholds:
 
✓ Target value: This value represents the value that must be met to say 
that the objective is met.
 
✓ Critical value: This value represents the level that is simply unacceptable.
 
When you’re recording the values of these metrics as you progress, you may 
also want to measure the worst value, best value, and median value, as well as 
the number of times those values occur. This scoreboard is your only way to 
ensure that your RTLS is performing right.
Measuring the End-User Experience
The end-user experience is where, to use an expression, the rubber meets 
the road. You can be armed with vast amounts of performance metrics on 
the RTLS infrastructure and application performance, but if you don’t know 
what users are experiencing, you don’t have the real performance picture. 
Although usability of an RTLS application is important, to achieve business 
value and Return on Investment (ROI), it’s critical that you’re also monitoring 
whether users are executing key processes effectively and efficiently.
The following sections cover the key metrics for evaluating an RTLS application’s 
user experience.
Perceived accuracy
Perceived accuracy is the accuracy as observed by a user. Your RTLS may 
meet the accuracy standards defined in the guidelines from RTLS technology 
or a vendor that you’ve selected, but if users feel the system is producing 
inaccurate results, the system is considered inaccurate.
Users need to believe that accuracy is good or great. If users can identify 
whether accuracy is great (and if not great, what areas need work), it helps 
you and your RTLS vendor make the accuracy better.

231
 Chapter 14: Measuring RTLS Performance
Consider the example shown in Figure 14-1. Assume that whenever an asset 
is in the back hallway, the RTLS always returns the asset location, as in room 
202. This is within the 5-foot accuracy guideline, but because the only way 
from the back hall to room 202 is the long route, users will never believe that 
accuracy is great. This problem needs to be addressed by the RTLS vendor.

but the person locating has to walk all the way

Sometimes, a part of accuracy perception refers to how easily it is to go from 
a wrong area to a right area. As shown in Figure 14-2, even though the RTLS 
returns room 202 for all assets in the nearby hallway, users won’t mind at all.
 
Users usually remember the incidents when the RTLS was inaccurate in 
locating objects or people. This may make users perceive the RTLS as less 
accurate or unreliable.
If your RTLS provides an obvious way for users to record whether the 
accuracy was great, you can create a KPI for this as
Percentage accurate = Number of times accurate ÷ Number of times 
locating attempted
If your RTLS doesn’t provide an easy way for users to record accuracy data, 
however, this indicator should be defined differently. For example, you may 
define it as mean time between inaccurate locating. Users can provide data, 
such as all instances of inaccurate results, at least once a week.

within 25 feet, but the asset is in the corridor

If you can’t measure it, don’t define it. Worse than not having a KPI is having a 
KPI that you can’t measure.
Perceived response time
Another key indicator for RTLS performance is the actual response time, as 
experienced by the end user for all users, all transactions, all locations, all 
the time. Although this measurement is critical, many organizations fail to 
consistently capture it.
As with perceived accuracy, if your RTLS provides an obvious way for users 
to record whether the response time is reasonable, you can create a KPI for 
this as
Percentage reasonable response = Number of times reasonable response 
÷ Number of times locating attempted
 
If your RTLS doesn’t provide an easy way for users to record response time, 
this indicator should be defined differently, such as the rate of irresponsive 
locating. Users can provide data, such as when the RTLS returns results slower 
than is reasonable, at least once a week. You can have a process in which 
users enter this data every week or so. For example, in an IVF pump locating 
application in a hospital, the perception of slow and fast has a lot to do with 
the state of mind at the time and it varies from person to person. You may 

233
 Chapter 14: Measuring RTLS Performance
think that the response time for locating is good (reasonable) in an area while 
another user may perceive that it’s slow (unreasonable) in the same area. 
When performance is slow and fast at different times, troubleshoot the 
performance issue differently than when it’s slow all the time. Your Information 
Technology (IT) department or vendor may spend a great deal of time and 
energy trying to solve the wrong problem. Metrics that aren’t clearly and 
unambiguously measurable may lead you on a wild goose chase, and you may 
end up spending too much time, money, and resources troubleshooting the 
behaviors.
Consistency
Consistency is the capability of an RTLS to produce good and consistent 
results in ever-changing environments. Consistency is a combination of 
perceived accuracy and perceived response time. Whether users think 
results are consistent enough is the most important thing to know.
Tripping and training
Tripping and training are the end-user error metrics. These metrics monitor 
the critical errors that users encounter. These metrics address the adoption 
and use of your RTLS application.
The things you want to observe or ask your users are
 
✓ Can users effectively execute the key functions for their specific role or 
are they struggling to use the application?
 
✓ Have users reached a level of proficiency in which they can execute 
efficiently or are they struggling to use the application?
 
✓ Where are users having specific issues, and what training is required? 
Which individual users need specific assistance?
 
Most of the time, an RTLS application is as good as the efficiency of the users 
using it. If users need extensive training or have to go through documents or 
help screens to use the product, they won’t be able to use it effectively.
Process intrusion
Process intrusions are the changes in habits and processes that end users 
have to make when they start using the RTLS. This indicator is crucial. 
Without it, you may not be able to identify and resolve critical application 
performance issues that affect the user’s ability to perform his or her job 
function.

234
Part IV: Monitoring Performance and Securing RTLS 
 
The process intrusion metric isn’t an obvious (mathematical) indicator. If 
you communicate with users to establish a rating for this indicator, however, 
you’ll find that most users happily express whether they like the new 
processes and why.
Gauging Operational Excellency
Most metrics that measure operational excellence for any product are also 
applicable to an RTLS:
 
✓ Availability: This metric indicates the historic availability of the RTLS 
(see the following formula). In a 24/7 operation, the calculation is simply 
the entire year’s potential operating time minus downtime and then 
divided by the total potential operating time:
 
 Total seconds in a year – Total down periods in seconds ÷ Total 
seconds in a year = Percent accuracy
 
 For example, if you have five minutes of downtime in a year, you have 
five nines of accuracy:
 
 (365 × 24 × 60 × 60) – (5 × 60) ÷ (365 × 24 × 60 × 60) = 99.999% 
accuracy and then 31,536,000 – 300 ÷ 31,536,000 = .99999
 
 Because the RTLS has a large number of components, the uptime is 
basically the sum total time of all elements of the RTLS that have been 
up and running. In other words, the uptime of each and every tag, 
location sensor, computer, software process, and so on.
 
 To be able to determine availability, not only do you need to track any 
failures when the system became unavailable (or has an extremely slow 
response) but you also need your RTLS to provide uptime reports (and 
the time and history of all software or hardware crashes or resets) on all 
components.
 
✓ Mean time between failures (MTBF): MTBF is a common metric that 
establishes the average time between failures. This is a very simple 
metric and is a good indicator of the product and system quality.
 
 Like uptime, to be able to determine MTBF, not only do you need to 
track any failures when the system became unavailable (or had an 
extremely slow response), but you also need your RTLS to provide you 
with the uptime and the time and history of all error-level events on all 
RTLS components.
 
✓ Reliability: Reliability is a reflection of how dependable the RTLS is. If 
the failures keep happening (such as the MTBF is low) even though the 
overall availability of the system may be high, the system may be 
unacceptable for your application.

235
 Chapter 14: Measuring RTLS Performance
 
✓ Maintenance cost: Maintenance cost (or the cost of low quality) is a 
measure of the number of dollars that are expended rectifying the 
consequences of bugs. This is typically the sum of labor and material 
costs. Labor costs cover the work to fix the bug, including the time 
spent in meetings and calls starting from the initial bug communication 
to the final bug closure.
Establishing Application Objectives
Key metrics that are application-specific vary along the different applications. 
The following sections describe the metrics indicators for two sample 
applications.
Staff emergency response
The purpose of the staff application emergency response is to enable the 
staff to request assistance whenever they have a personal or medical 
emergency. The staff carries call-button tags. When they need to summon 
help, they press a button on the tag.
The metrics specific to this application (and not included as part of opera-
tion excellence or end-user experience) are
 
✓ The time elapsed since pressing the call button to the time when help 
comes to the person requesting it. Median, worst, and best values need 
to be recorded to figure out what’s acceptable and then provide that 
period as a guideline to the staff.
 
✓ Number of times that pressing the call button fails to generate an 
alert.
Asset locating
The purpose of the asset-locating application is to enable staff to locate 
assets (makes sense, right?).
The metrics specific to this application (and not included as part of 
operation excellence or end-user experience) are
 
✓ The time elapsed since the staff member actually starts looking for the 
asset to the time he or she finds the asset.
 
✓ The number of times an asset couldn’t be located by the RTLS but was 
later found in the facility.

RTLS Vulnerabilities
In This Chapter
▶ Knowing your security threats
▶ Understanding the available countermeasures
▶ Catching attacks
▶ Looking at some real-world examples
A
n RTLS, by nature of the silent and invisible technology character that 
enables real-time locating of assets or people over the air, introduces 
unique challenges to security. What’s accessible to an RTLS is potentially 
accessible to malicious hackers.
Any device implementing the same air interface can potentially access or 
jam the network. Attacks aren’t limited by location or distance. For example, 
Bluetooth attack tools are known to have several-mile radii, although valid 
usage scenarios would never attempt such coverage range for Bluetooth.
This chapter provides you with knowledge of the security challenges in an 
RTLS as well as strategies to counter them.
Evaluating Security Threats
An effective security strategy requires ensuring high availability, integrity 
trust, and confidentiality. With respect to an RTLS, some of the risks are 
similar to those of any products, some are exacerbated by wireless 
connectivity, and some are new.
The heart of the security problem in any RTLS is that the tags aren’t tethered 
with wires. The tags are small and carried by people or attached to assets, 
and the location sensors or the location engine can locate them with airborne 
techniques or protocols.
 
The very ease and flexibility of adding tags that make the RTLS plausible make 
it highly vulnerable from a security standpoint.

238
Part IV: Monitoring Performance and Securing RTLS 
Unauthorized or malicious users may gain access to the tags, access the 
actual real-time locating system, corrupt the databases, degrade the RTLS 
performance, or launch attacks that prevent locating from working or 
providing accurate results.
The following sections outline the risks to security, including attacks on 
confidentiality, integrity, and network availability. The upcoming section, 
“Knowing Your Options: Countermeasures,” addresses ways to protect your 
RTLS from attacks.
Availability loss
Loss of RTLS availability involves some form of a denial of service attack, 
such as jamming the airwaves. The loss of RTLS availability implies that the 
tags are no longer locatable or that they’re not locatable with the expected 
resolution, accuracy, or performance. Denial of service attacks may be 
directed at the RTLS in general, at a specific tag, or at a specific location. 
The following sections cover the four main categories of loss of availability 
attacks.
Physical security threats
Because an RTLS uses wireless, attackers or intruders don’t have to have 
physical access to attack an RTLS. However, physical access control 
shouldn’t be overlooked. The components of an RTLS, such as tags, are 
spread all over the facility, and you should have the following means in place 
to secure those physically:
 
✓ Physical destruction or theft of tags: Because tags are wireless and 
small, tags could be destroyed easily. This could be as simple as just 
removing or discharging the battery or exposing it to physical harms, 
such as mechanical shocks or chemicals.
 
✓ Physical destruction or theft of location sensors: Because location 
sensors are deployed throughout the facility, the sensors could be 
exposed to many forms of physical destruction. They can be destroyed 
by changing the orientation or the position of the location sensor, 
blocking it physically such as putting a metal plate in front of it, or just 
exposing it to physical harm such as a mechanical shock or chemicals.
 
✓ Tag detachment: One risk to RTLS security is removing the tag from the 
asset. At the heart of the RTLS system is the unambiguous identification 
of the tagged asset by the tag; this type of attack poses a fundamental 
security problem, even though it may appear trivial at first sight. You 
may believe that the asset is still present when only the tag is present.
 
 Another security threat is when the tag from one asset is swapped with 
that of another asset. You may believe that the asset is still present 
when it’s actually a different asset.

239
 Chapter 15: RTLS Vulnerabilities
 
✓ Physical power off of location sensors: Another risk to an RTLS is the 
infrastructure of location sensors that could be dependent upon electric 
power. Environmental events or intruders causing the power off of some 
location sensors can affect the location accuracy.
Network attacks
Firewalls and intrusion detection systems are standard protection against 
attacks and unauthorized entries into a company’s private network or server. 
But they aren’t enough to counter the security threats that can potentially 
affect an RTLS:
 
✓ Deactivating tags: These types of attacks render a tag useless without 
physically destroying it.
 
 Tags (whether active or passive) provide an interface so that users and 
applications can communicate with the tags wirelessly. By probing and 
sniffing out communications among tags and other RTLS elements (or 
by brute force methods, such as cracking passwords, getting access to 
documentation, and so on), malicious entities may be able to gain 
control and issue commands to deactivate the tag. Because no physical 
connection for deactivation is needed, the intruder may actually be 
quite far from the tag being deactivated. And, depending on the type of 
deactivation, the location sensors may not be able to identify or even 
detect the tag’s presence.
 
✓ Jamming: Jamming occurs when a malicious hacker deliberately 
disturbs the air interface between the location sensor and the tag and 
attacks the communication availability (see Figure 15-1).
 
Figure 15-1: 
Jamming is

attack.

Part IV: Monitoring Performance and Securing RTLS 
 
 The attacker may use physical devices, such as antennas, that can be 
modulated from a distance to cause radio frequency (RF) jamming. Some 
jamming tools may use very high RF energy, sufficient to break down 
the electronics in the tag or the location sensor and make it malfunction 
completely.
 
 Another way to achieve jamming is through a more passive means, such 
as shielding. For example, when one or more layers of aluminum foil are 
wrapped around a tag, the tag may be undetectable.
 
✓ Blocking: Blocking is a threat in which malicious hackers create tags 
that simulate a misbehaving tag (or multiple tags) and confuse the 
location sensors to fail to respond to the actual tags around this blocker 
tag. Blocker tags are difficult to detect and can bring down the network.
 
✓ Using the man in the middle: In this attack, the attacker alters a legitimate 
message between the elements of the RTLS, such as between the tag and 
the location sensor, the location sensor and the location engine, and so 
on. The attacker confuses the RTLS by deleting, adding, changing, or 
reordering the messages (see Figure 15-2).
 
 In one specific attack, the man in the middle can keep the tag from ever 
talking to the location sensor (or the location engine), resulting in the 
RTLS system never locating that specific tag.
 
✓ Using denial of service: Besides blocking or jamming, the attacker may 
prevent or prohibit the normal use of air interface between the tag and 
the location sensor by message flooding (sending repetitive messages) 
or by broadcast flooding (sending messages to all or many destinations 
at the same time) to the location sensor or the tag. The flooding causes 
the RTLS to become very slow, to become nonresponsive, or to miss 
critical packets, which cause it to not locate or to locate inaccurately.

 Chapter 15: RTLS Vulnerabilities
 
 Many attacks in wired networks, such as Address Resolution Protocol 
(ARP) poisoning (sending an excessively large number of ARP requests 
to the tag or the sensor, sending fake ARP messages so that an attacker 
can divert all communication between the tag and the location engine 
through the attacker’s machine, and so on), Ping of Death (sending an 
excessively large number of ping requests to the tag or sensor), and so 
on, are applicable to the wireless RTLS world, too.
 
✓ Masquerading as a location sensor (or location sensor spoofing): By 
acting as another location sensor or some other element of the RTLS, 
the attacker may cause the location engine to not detect or locate a tag.
Product configuration
One of the most common sources of security vulnerabilities is mis-configuration 
by the users or administrators, exposing the network for attackers or 
intruders. For example, using factory-default configurations or settings (such 
as passwords that are often documented and available on vendor Web sites 
and so on) for some parameters can make it very easy for an intruder to gain 
access to your network.
Another issue related to product configuration is when the neighboring 
facilities purchase and use the same RTLS. The two RTLS may interfere or 
collide with each other, resulting in availability loss (for example, both 
facilities using the same RF channel for communication between tags and 
location sensors).
Product quality
The software and hardware quality of the RTLS components is a significant 
factor. Bugs can expose more vulnerabilities to the attackers.
Integrity loss
Integrity loss involves an active adversary tampering with the data that’s 
being used by the RTLS to compute the tag locations. The loss of RTLS 
integrity implies that either the tags are being located incorrectly or the 
information sent to the tags or received from the tags can’t be trusted.
Security threats to integrity include
 
✓ Masquerading as a tag: The attacker impersonates a tag, causing 
the RTLS to get confused and locate the tag incorrectly. This is often 
referred to as tag spoofing.
 
✓ Masquerading as a location sensor: The attacker impersonates a 
location sensor, causing the RTLS to get confused and locate the tag 
incorrectly. This is often referred to as location sensor spoofing.

242
Part IV: Monitoring Performance and Securing RTLS 
 
✓ Using the man in the middle attack: Not just loss of availability, the 
hackers can use this attack to impact the location accuracy. The tag 
location accuracy can be selectively affected by altering the messages 
exchanged between the tag and the location sensors. In this scenario, 
this attack is called falsifying the tag data.
 
✓ Distance enlargement and/or reduction: This type of attack is usually 
applicable when Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) or Time of 
Flight (ToF) is used and the attacker impersonates tag signals with 
different RSSI or ToF measurements.
 
✓ Signal synthesis attack: In this type of attack, a malicious hacker feeds 
false signals to the receiver (tag or location sensor) to confuse it, 
thereby, causing the system to fail to locate or to locate incorrectly.
 
✓ Replaying: The attacker monitors messages exchanged and retransmits 
the messages at a later period, confusing the RTLS.
Confidentiality loss
Confidentiality implies ensuring that information isn’t made available or 
disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes.
Confidentiality is, in general, a fundamental security requirement for most 
organizations; however, due to the shared nature of media used for an RTLS, 
confidentiality is a more difficult security requirement to meet. Malicious 
entities may gain unauthorized access to the network through a wireless 
network made available for the RTLS.
Security threats to confidentiality are
 
✓ Eavesdropping: The attacker monitors the message exchange between 
the tag and the location sensor or other elements of the RTLS (see 
Figure 15-3).
 
 The eavesdropped information could, for example, be used to collect 
private, sensitive information about a person or to collect information 
from an asset. For example, when an asset tag is connected to an IVF 
pump and is also used to collect information from that IVF pump, the 
eavesdropper may get access to information regarding the prescription 
and dosage.
 
 Another example of this attack is a person listening to the transmissions 
from the tags or tuning into transmissions between a tag and a location 
sensor.
 
✓ Traffic analysis: The attacker, in a more subtle way, gains intelligence 
by monitoring the transmissions from tags for communication patterns. 
A considerable amount of information is contained in the flow of messages.

243
 Chapter 15: RTLS Vulnerabilities
 
 For example, the tags may be worn by security guards, and a hacker can 
determine where the security guards are in the building at any point of 
time and use it to his advantage. Or in a bank with asset tags for money 
bags, an attacker can figure out the time periods when more or fewer 
money bags are in the bank.
 
✓ Crackers: In this attack, the attackers try to crack (or figure out) the 
security keys, if any, exchanged between the tag and the location sensors. 
By determining the security keys, the attackers get access to the data 
network (backbone network) of the facility.

Knowing Your Options: Countermeasures
The real impact on RTLS security depends upon the security threats 
applicable to the technology used and the countermeasures adopted. To 
physically protect your tags, location sensors, and so on, you must make 
sure that the proper physical countermeasures (such as barriers, access 
control systems, and guards) are in place because these are your first line of 
defense. Other countermeasures include
 
✓ Location-based operations: This is the countermeasure model in which 
certain operations are allowed from only a specific area. Unless the 
tag is in that area, the operation is disallowed. Usually, this is easy to 
achieve when tags have the capability of self-locating.
 
✓ Tamper detection: This is a capability that sends alerts to the RTLS 
administrator in case the tag or the location sensor is tampered with 
physically. The idea is to create a tight bond between the tag or the 
location sensor and the surface it’s attached to so that any motion, 
shock, or removal from the surface can be detected.

244
Part IV: Monitoring Performance and Securing RTLS 
 
 Several kinds of tamper detection sensors are available, such as
 
• Optical tamper detection: When the tag is removed from the asset, 
the sensor in the tag detects light.
 
• Bio tamper detection: The tag monitors a biological component, 
such as temperature or pulse rate, and when a significant change 
occurs in any characteristic, alerts are issued. For example, a tag 
attached to infants for infant-abduction prevention could monitor 
whether the tag is still on the baby.
 
• Magnetic tamper detection: The tag has a tamper circuit, which gets 
closed by ferrous contacts that are activated (change positions 
to close the circuit) in the presence of a magnet. The magnet is 
included as part of the base of the tag, and opening a tag opens 
this circuit, signaling a possible attack.
 
• Electrical tamper detection: Some of the adhesive tapes become 
part of the tag circuit and alert the tag when the tag is separated 
from the adhesive surface.
 
• Strap sensor: The tag is attached to the asset with a strap, and 
when the strap is cut, the tag is alerted. The strap has a conductor 
imbedded within that’s in electrical contact with respective terminals 
on the tag. The tamper-detection circuit on the tag detects when 
the strap is cut, resulting in an alert.
 
✓ Reference tags: By making use of fixed-reference tags that are always 
seen by the location sensors, you can assure that all location sensors 
are active and can read tags.
 
✓ Spectrum analyzer: By installing spectrum analyzers (available in many 
form factors, such as ceiling sensors), RF signals or noise levels in the 
environment can be monitored and appropriate alerts can be issued on 
jamming detection and so on.
 
✓ Airwaves noise-level baselines: The quality of an RTLS depends upon 
the wireless communication in spite of the noise in the air. By making 
use of sophisticated software or additional sensors, you can establish 
levels (or baselines) of noise that are typically expected at different 
times at different locations. And, these software or sensors can send 
alerts upon significant variations in these baselines.
 
✓ Heartbeats: By making use of periodic checks or heartbeats (at whatever 
periodic levels are acceptable) from all tags and location sensors, the 
RTLS can provide peace of mind in case a change occurs. These heartbeats 
are small messages that flow from the tag or the location sensors back 
to the location engine, indicating that the tag or the location sensor is 
alive and fine.

245
 Chapter 15: RTLS Vulnerabilities
 
✓ Strong encryption and authentication: Use the highest possible level 
of encryption technologies, checksums for all messages exchanged, 
authentication mechanisms, difficult passwords, and so forth.
Table 15-1 outlines the countermeasures best suited to address each type of 
threat.

Part IV: Monitoring Performance and Securing RTLS 
Catching the Attacks
With all the different security threats, the fact that more security vulnerabilities 
are discovered every day, and the fact that people are actively working on 
creating attacks, it’s pretty tough to keep up with all the latest security 
countermeasures.
In fact, your RTLS could be under attack and you might not even know it. 
This isn’t a trivial problem. How do you tell whether an attack is going on if 
there are no obvious signs?
Sometimes your RTLS may have significantly visible symptoms, and sometimes 
symptoms may be subtle. Sometimes mechanical problems or software bugs 
can also cause symptoms that may appear like an attack.
To address this issue, you need to have baselines for network performance 
established. The best way to detect a problem is to keep a constant watch on 
your baseline and monitor any variation in it. Some RTLS technologies and 
solutions include the software to characterize this baseline, and that can be 
an important tool for you to catch the attacks.
Evaluating the Real Security Challenge
Given the large number of security threats and countermeasures and the 
fact that it’s much more difficult to address security after deployment and 
implementation have occurred, security should be considered from the initial 
planning stage. You’re more likely to make better security decisions at the 
planning stage.
To help you develop such a plan and understand the seriousness of security 
risk in your application, security challenges for the following example 
applications are evaluated in Table 15-2:
 
✓ Emergency response: Consider the environment of a hospital in which 
push-button tags are provided to staff or patients. They press the push 
button to summon assistance in the event of an emergency. An attack is 
high impact if it causes the message from the person requesting emergency 
assistance to not reach the security guard. An attack is medium impact 
if the alert is received by a security guard, but instead of one alert, the 
same alert is received multiple times. It can be annoying, but the purpose 
of emergency response is still served.

✓ Animal tracking: In this application, animals are tagged. The tracking is 
done to inventory what enters and exits the barn as well as to prevent 
animals from getting stolen. An attack is high impact if it causes the 
animal (or inventory) to be stolen.

ewer than ten years of rapid and enthusiastic evolution have led to 
several RTLS technologies based on standards and supported by a large 
selection of products and services. The promise of an RTLS has become 
apparent to many inventive solutions providers and users, resulting in 
companies actively looking to transform their processes with an RTLS. To 
ensure success, new RTLS users should follow classic guidelines for technology 
adoption and project management as they move from a pilot to a commercial 
implementation, and at the same time, use the lessons discovered by early 
adopters of an RTLS.
In this chapter, I want to make you familiar with the ten most common pitfalls 
companies and users run into with RTLS implementations. Regardless of your 
industry and the specific business applications your RTLS will address, by 
recognizing these pitfalls, you can ensure the short-term and long-term success 
of your system and truly drive value innovation to achieve both your short-term 
tactical goals as well as your long-term strategic goals.

252
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Failing to Determine Compatibility
One of the most common pitfalls in RTLS deployment is not spending enough 
time ensuring compatibility of your choice of technology with the existing 
technologies in your environment. This is a very crucial issue especially 
because of the pervasive nature of an RTLS in which tags and location sensors 
are spread all over the facility.
Look at the compatibility of the RTLS and existing technology with respect to 
the following:
 
✓ Networking and other infrastructure technologies: If a compatibility 
issue is between the RTLS technology and your network or infrastructure 
technology, the impact could be network (or infrastructure) disruption, 
RTLS performance disruption, or both.
 
 For example, if you’re deploying an RTLS solution that makes use of 
radio frequencies at 2.4 GHz, look for all other systems that use that 
frequency range, such as Wi-Fi 802.11b. You can prepare a list of all 
technologies used for the network by talking to your IT (Information 
Technology) team. For instance, your facility might be using 2.4 GHz 
video cameras for security, and in that case, it might interfere with the 
2.4 GHz you’re planning to use for the RTLS.
 
✓ Technologies used by assets: Assets today sometimes make use of some 
technology for data transmission or capture. If a compatibility issue is 
between the RTLS technology and the technology used by your asset, 
the impact could be asset functionality degradation, RTLS degradation, 
or both.
 
 Prior to attaching tags to assets or installing location sensors, ensure 
that you’re aware of those technologies and there’s no such compatibility 
issue.
 
 Sometimes one of the reasons isn’t interference in technology but just 
close proximity of two different technologies.
 
 One approach to address this is by creating the asset list along with 
the technologies those assets use so that you’re aware of this when you 
select the RTLS technology.
 
✓ Technologies used by people: In this era, people use technologies for their 
personal use and/or for life safety. If a compatibility or interoperability 
issue is between the RTLS technology and the possible technologies used 
by people, the impact could be serious.
 
 Ensure that you’ve done all due diligence with respect to compatibility 
and interoperability with devices such as pacemakers and implantable 
cardiac defibrillators. This is crucial for both giving tags to people and 
attaching location sensors (because you may have visitors and people 
with tags in your facility).

253
 Chapter 16: Ten RTLS Pitfalls
One model to address this compatibility issue is by making use of standards-
based technologies. Standards-based technologies are usually backed by 
many groups, technical forums, and organizations and have been examined 
a lot. However, standardization doesn’t guarantee compatibility. On a side 
note, this isn’t the only benefit of standardization: It’s inevitably good for the 
customer because it also drives the creation of a wide selection of products 
at a lower cost.
Creating an Abstract Business Case
Another common mistake in RTLS deployment is creating an abstract 
business case that doesn’t really reflect operational reality. Don’t spend on 
an RTLS just because your competitors, vendors, or clients are doing it or 
you think it will help you. Use an RTLS only if you can clearly document the 
benefits of it for your organization. Different organizations may benefit 
differently from the same application, and a large gap is usually between the 
highest theoretical models of what an RTLS can do and the practical realities 
of the business. For example, if you want to use an RTLS for a staff safety 
application, clearly document the average, median, and worst case times it 
took for providing the response before and after using the RTLS.
Measuring performance before and after is essential. Metrics may be hard 
and harsh, and they may require soul-searching. But if you want to succeed, 
you have to look at everything. You have to know where you stand before 
you can make the changes and quantify the benefits.
One way to address this issue is by linking the pilot definition to the business 
case. This way you can see the business value of an RTLS from the pilot itself 
and you can make a decision whether the application is a go or no go.
Underestimating the Integration Cost
A common mistake made by companies is that RTLS integration is perceived 
as an obstacle to RTLS deployment and is scaled down as much as possible 
for the initial phase. Although it’s a good strategy to plan a smaller RTLS 
project initially to move forward, by ignoring the larger integration picture, 
the costs involved in overall integration are underestimated or not planned 
at all.
For lack of budgets, those integrations either never happen or happen too 
slowly, resulting in businesses and users living with isolated functionality, 
multiple instances of the same data, redundant manual activities, higher 
costs, and inefficient experiences.

254
Part V: The Part of Tens 
I recommend listing all the integration needs, even if you’re planning a 
smaller RTLS project initially. By having all the interface and application 
needs, you can select the right RTLS solution for you, estimate the potential 
cost of integration, and establish RTLS deployment phases. If user feedback 
is positive in initial deployment and there’s a measured business benefit, 
you can demonstrate the success to put forward a strong case for further 
integration funding. On the other hand, if the feedback is a failure in terms of 
the expected user benefits compared with the measured results, at least the 
decision makers can say the project didn’t cost very much.
Estimating Location Sensor 
Deployment Unrealistically
Sometimes, business cases are built on assumptions about how broadly 
location sensors will be deployed for the desired accuracy. For example, the 
west wing needs high accuracy, and the remainder of the facility needs low 
accuracy. These goals and budget plans may not be realistic when the 
application is deployed because
 
✓ The accuracy of the RTLS may be less than expected.
 
✓ You (or the business process) may require higher accuracy than you 
planned for initially.
One of the reasons that people conclude wrong numbers for location sensors 
is that they don’t test (or pilot) in similar environmental conditions to 
production environment. For example, you may test the location accuracy 
provided by the RTLS for tags (assets) at orientations and positions that are 
very well defined, but those may be far different from the tags (assets) at 
orientations and positions that you might see in real life.
Another reason is that people don’t meticulously record data during the pilot 
phase. This results in perceived good accuracy with fewer location sensors 
in pilots and then realizing the need for a larger number of location sensors 
after the full deployment.
One good strategy is to include fixed RTLS tags and automated recording of 
the tag location as reported by the RTLS. With this automated process, you 
have objective data of the RTLS accuracy with the given number of location 
sensors and you can adjust the number of location sensors in the pilot phase. 
Adding more location sensors or moving location sensors in live deployments 
is almost a mini-project in itself, and every attempt should be done to avoid 
that.

255
 Chapter 16: Ten RTLS Pitfalls
Performing Inadequate Testing 
with Different Types of Assets
Usually due to lack of dedicated resources or just the hassles of procuring all 
types of assets, pilot tests don’t include assets of all types. The impact of this 
can be
 
✓ Issues in attaching tags to some assets because of shape, surface, 
temperature, or environment characteristics.
 
✓ The RTLS not working on some assets because of interference or some 
sort of co-existence issues between that asset and the tag technology.
 
✓ Some assets move at different speeds than others, and the selected 
technology may not produce the desired results for tags moving at a 
faster speed.
 
✓ Some assets vibrate more than others or exhibit other physical charac-
teristics, such as higher temperature, and the selected technology may 
not produce the desired results for the tags on these assets.
Forgetting about the Business Process
An RTLS is a fascinating technology that provides you with the capability 
to locate things and people in real time. After you start discovering this and 
seeing it in action, you may get so engrossed in it that you may almost ignore 
the business process.
An RTLS isn’t about technology but about business-process change. You may 
have the right technology and the right performance metrics, but by failing to 
train your users with the new business processes, you may fail to be effective 
in using the RTLS.
Your users may create new processes to do things — a combination of what 
they used to do prior to deploying the RTLS, and what they think they should 
be doing. This just creates overhead and doesn’t make your RTLS effective.
To counter this, look for RTLS solutions that require minimum training for 
the product so that the users can focus on figuring out the new process 
instead of the new product.

256
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Foregoing Enterprise-Wide Coverage
A system that covers only specific areas or departments impacts your success. 
User adoption depends on enterprise-wide coverage. Without this, an RTLS 
will never fully be integrated into the fabric of your organization; also, you 
can’t optimally impact productivity, workflow, or true value innovation.
Although implementing in phases and selecting one area before another is 
pragmatic, plan for deploying in the whole enterprise. For example, one of 
the biggest Returns on Investments (ROI) in an RTLS provides reduction in 
lost, stolen, or otherwise missing equipment. While the assets and people 
move throughout your entire enterprise, to achieve maximum benefit, your 
RTLS deployment must cover every square foot. Without coverage that 
extends everywhere, you simply can’t protect or find your assets.
Underestimating Maintenance Efforts
Maintenance considerations, a main factor in both the cost and ongoing 
success of your deployment, are the ones that are often ignored. Understand 
the time and money involved in
 
✓ Maintaining your RTLS at peak performance. It shouldn’t take a team of 
IT professionals to keep the RTLS system running.
 
✓ Replacing batteries in the tags. This includes not just the cost of 
batteries but also the time and labor to replace the batteries.
 
✓ Replacing tags or location sensors that aren’t functioning properly.
 
✓ Adding new tags and location sensors. For this you can leverage your 
understanding from the pre-pilot/pilot installations.
 
✓ Understanding the needs to tweak location sensors to achieve 
acceptable results in a live environment.
 
✓ Monitoring whether all sensors are operational and whether the RTLS 
system is behaving in general as desired.
Be sure to understand all maintenance costs upfront and add some 
maintenance activities as part of your pilot.

257
 Chapter 16: Ten RTLS Pitfalls
Planning for an Overzealous 1.0
Don’t plan for the big-bang application as an RTLS 1.0. Select an achievable 
scope, measure results, and learn from experience — in other words, use the 
RTLS for basic functionality in the early stages of deployment.
For instance, deploying an RTLS to receive alerts whenever an asset leaves 
a specific area is a viable 1.0 goal, but at the same time, integrating the RTLS 
security application with video monitoring in your facility is likely a 2.0 
implementation innovation.
Scale up from a foundation of smaller, successful projects. It’s easy to get 
excited and undertake more than can be delivered and monitored.
Failing to Engage Privacy Groups
People adopt what they trust. The RTLS success deeply depends on the 
people using it. If concerns exist over privacy violations, the RTLS simply will 
fail.
Engage privacy groups in your area and identify the RTLS technology clearly 
to your users. Communicate clearly what your intentions are and address 
any concerns users may have.

A
n RTLS isn’t a one-time event or a single-use product; it’s a way of 
business. An RTLS isn’t something that you install, and some of your 
employees use it. It changes your processes. An RTLS affects how people do 
things, how people interact, and how performance is measured in any business 
division. You’ll learn and grow in your RTLS use. You may initially install it 
for tracking visitors and later use it for employee safety. You may want to 
use the same system for tracking the dwell times for people and assets to 
improve efficiency, and you may use the system for tracking assets for asset 
security.
Because of the potential costs and risks of the wrong decision for something 
that could be used so widespread and affect your processes, finding the right 
RTLS vendor is critical. Choosing vendors and replacing them later when 
they don’t work out may mean
 
✓ Retraining your employees with respect to process changes.
 
✓ Spending more time in vendor retraining because each vendor must 
understand your environment.

260
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ Adding or removing infrastructure from your walls, ceilings, and 
environment in general.
 
✓ Having too many people or vendors working on your systems, which can 
potentially create more security vulnerabilities, leaks of your business 
secrets, and so on.
 
✓ Losing time that can lead your business to not achieve its potential or to 
lag behind the competition.
This chapter describes ten things that should be part of your RTLS decision 
matrix for choosing a vendor that meets your needs.
Seeking Critical Mass in an RTLS
An RTLS is a critical piece of infrastructure, just as are door locks, routers, 
and wired or wireless networks. When you’re selecting a vendor, look for one 
that has critical mass in an RTLS, meaning that
 
✓ The vendor has a deep enough product portfolio. Usually, an RTLS 
deployment consists of tags, location sensors, the location engine, 
middleware, application software, and the integration with services and 
systems in your business. A vendor with critical mass has a product 
portfolio that’s deep enough that it can be self-sustaining. For example, 
if the vendor offers an end-to-end solution (that is, all components of 
the RTLS, such as tags, location sensors, and so on), you won’t have to 
worry about who will provide the other components.
 
✓ The vendor is invested in an RTLS. Usually, if a vendor has significant 
revenues from an RTLS and/or is investing significantly in research and 
development in an RTLS, it indicates that the vendor’s invested in an 
RTLS, and hopefully, you won’t have to answer the question, “What will I 
do if the vendor decides not to stay in the RTLS market?”
Selecting a Strategic Vendor
There’s an old adage: “Nobody gets fired for buying IBM.” That refers to 
the glory days when IBM was the top choice in personal computers, and 
by recommending IBM, you were fairly certain that you wouldn’t lose your 
job because you chose an unknown vendor with an unproven track record. 
Although times (and IBM) have changed, the concept still holds true: 
Generally speaking, you’re better off selecting a product from a vendor who 
has a proven track record and a satisfied client base.

261
 Chapter 17: Ten Tips for Selecting an RTLS Vendor
However, with an RTLS, no vendor has a long-term proven track record, 
which makes it more difficult to select a vendor. The RTLS is a fairly new 
technology, and a large technological evolution has happened in the last 
seven years. Although some vendors have located at choke points for over 
ten years, locating precisely indoors is new for almost everyone.
The best strategy is to select a strategic vendor. A strategic vendor is interested 
enough in your organization and the things you’re doing to be willing to work 
with you while you learn and grow. Therefore, you should be a large enough 
customer to command the vendor’s attention.
Finding a strategic vendor is finding a partner with whom you can work to 
create situations that are beneficial for both organizations. You can honestly 
discuss your needs, and the vendor can try to find the best solutions for 
your needs. A strategic vendor is the one who is a long-term fit. The strategic 
vendor won’t just solve your asset-locating needs; it’s capable of providing 
the right solution in case you extend beyond asset locating. The strategic 
vendor doesn’t just provide you a solution, it’s your advisor.
Another set of key elements to look for in a strategic partner is vertical 
specialization and size band coverage. Vertical specialization, or vertical 
reach, refers to the extent to which the vendor offers industry-specific 
solutions and expertise. It’s critical to have a vendor who has a strong focus 
on your vertical market segment. Size band coverage refers to the vendor’s 
reach and revenue in your size band. Here are the three company size bands: 
large enterprises, medium enterprises, and small enterprises. Selecting a 
vendor who has a focus in your size band will be more motivated and able to 
provide better support.
Checking End User Sentiment
A natural question when selecting a vendor is “Who uses your product?” 
What you’re probably hoping to hear are the names of companies you’ve 
heard of. However, because the RTLS is still a new market, neither the vendor 
recognition nor the size of the vendor’s installed base is high. What this 
means is that you may not get a lot of references, or even if you get some, 
many of those are trials and proof of concepts rather than full-fledged 
deployments. For this reason, it’s critical to understand the end user’s 
sentiment of the vendor with respect to the following:
 
✓ Product quality: What’s the end user’s perception of the product 
quality? Quality isn’t about just having few or no bugs; it’s about ease of 
product use and the vendor’s ability to resolve issues as soon as they’re 
discovered.

262
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ Vendor’s engagement level: You’re looking for vendors who understand 
the importance of listening to your end users of an RTLS. For example, if 
you deployed an RTLS for helping nurses locate equipment, you want a 
vendor who will have its support and development engineers engaging 
with nurses to learn and improve. As I mention earlier, an RTLS application 
isn’t a product that’s installed, it’s about how it’s used.
 
✓ Capability breadth: Capability breadth refers to the vendor’s ability 
to go beyond the initial needs and provide consultation, integration, 
maintenance, and management.
Knowing a Vendor’s Technological Focus
Because one RTLS technology doesn’t fit all applications, one thing that can 
be important to evaluate is a vendor’s offering of breadth of technologies. 
Breadth refers to the extent to which a vendor meets business requirements 
across a range of applications and needs. You’re not looking for a vendor 
that supports locating only at room level, locating at choke points, or is hung 
up on a specific RTLS technology. You want to see openness and vendor 
capabilities with respect to technology diversity.
 
One way to look at a vendor’s offering of breadth and depth is to find out 
which technologies and standards the vendor supports.
 
Try to avoid proprietary technologies! Evaluating a vendor’s commitment to 
common industry standards and support for popular technology platforms is 
important. Many proprietary technologies have existed in RFID and RTLS 
space for many years. However, it isn’t a hard rule, and sometimes it may not 
be possible for you to avoid proprietary technologies. Also avoid vendors who 
don’t have an ecosystem of multiple RTLS technologies. If a vendor’s offerings 
include only one specific technology, the vendor may not have you in mind 
and may try to push that technology for every application need you might 
have. Using one technology for every RTLS need that you may have might 
work, but you may not even know the best solution or sacrifices you’re 
making by not using other technologies.
Knowing the Integration and 
Interoperability Potential
Even though your initial RTLS application may work as a standalone 
application, it will grow and will need to interact and integrate with many 
other systems and services in your organization.

263
 Chapter 17: Ten Tips for Selecting an RTLS Vendor
You must be aware of the ease and extent with which the RTLS offering 
can exist, interface, combine, and work with the products, services, and 
solutions from other vendors. Interoperability and integration is a very 
important factor because many applications will seek to access, assimilate, 
analyze, reuse, publish, and act upon real-time information from an RTLS.
Avoid vendors who don’t support standard programmatic interfaces.
Asking about Developing 
Custom Solutions
Let’s face it, no two business operations are alike. Businesses differ in the 
applications, products, protocols, transport layers, operations support 
systems, physical environment, and processes they use. When you combine 
any of these aspects, the different combinations any given business might 
use are unlimited.
Because the choice of an RTLS depends upon your environment, your appli-
cation, and your application’s ability to feed or use real-time information to 
applications from other vendors, you’ll most likely need something custom-
ized for a perfect fit into your organization.
Make sure that the company you select has the engineering resources and 
experience to develop that perfect-fit solution.
Ensuring Smooth Operations 
with Site Surveys
A site survey is the first step in the RTLS deployment by which the surveyor 
studies the facility to understand your environment. A site survey tells you 
and the vendor how a specific RTLS technology will perform, what the 
potential performance issues may be, and where the optimal placement 
of location sensors is. A site survey also serves as a guide for power 
considerations, wiring requirements, and installation verification.
Because a site survey is the most important step to ensure the smooth 
RTLS operation, it’s important to know the vendor’s capability to perform 
site surveys.
 
A few good indicators that a vendor understands the need of site surveys 
include the vendor using standardized site survey software, its ability to do 
remote site surveys, and personnel certifications.

264
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Developing a Proof of Concept
A vendor who’s motivated to invest in a proof of concept, or a trial in your 
environment, displays the following characteristics:
 
✓ Confidence in its RTLS offering: The proof of concept demonstrates in 
real time the performance, resolution, and accuracy — the three most 
important claims any RTLS vendor makes.
 
✓ Motivation to grow with you: The vendor understands that the time 
spent during proof of concept helps you and the vendor assess your 
needs.
Knowing the Shipping Volumes 
for RTLS Tags
The ability to deliver tag volumes is another critical aspect, especially 
because most RTLS vendors haven’t yet seen high tag volumes and lead 
times could be significant, often as long as 8–16 weeks.
Be aware of the components and tag manufacturing processes because they 
can severely limit your ability to get tag volumes in the future.
Asking for Remote Troubleshooting 
and Updates
What are the vendor’s capabilities with respect to remote troubleshooting? 
This is an important aspect because if the vendor can’t remotely troubleshoot, 
the vendor’s response time will be slow. Here are a few quick tests you can 
do to see if the vendor has remote troubleshooting capabilities:
 
✓ Can a vendor do a remote update (upgrade or downgrade) of any 
software or firmware?
 
✓ Can a vendor restart any specific software component, all software, or 
any specific piece of hardware remotely?

265
 Chapter 17: Ten Tips for Selecting an RTLS Vendor
 
✓ Can a vendor remotely check whether any memory leaks have occurred 
or any processes have died or restarted?
 
✓ Can a vendor collect all the information its engineers need to debug a 
particular bug without talking to you over the phone?
 
✓ Does the vendor have enough logging or tracing capabilities that it 
can enable? Because excess logging can sometimes change the RTLS 
response and behavior, it’s important that the vendor provides logging 
capability that can be enabled for any or all components and has multiple 
levels.
 
A good indicator that the vendor doesn’t have good remote troubleshooting 
capabilities is when the vendor needs to send support or development 
engineers to your site for any issue, or the vendor keeps calling you for 
information.

atteries are the lifeblood of an RTLS. Unless you’re using passive tags 
(that have no battery), without batteries, the whole system shuts down.
The key types of batteries that you typically find in RTLS tags (and optionally, 
location sensors) are: Leclanché, alkaline, nickel-metal hydride (NiMH), 
lithium, silver oxide, zinc air, and nickel cadmium (NiCd). Some RTLS use 
primary (non-rechargeable) batteries, and others use secondary (rechargeable) 
batteries. This chapter describes ten important points to consider when 
using batteries for RTLS.

268
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Maximizing Battery Life
Batteries lose life because of usage — even when not in use. As the cell ages, 
the composition and structure of the materials changes, and the result is 
that the cell capacity deteriorates. You can’t do much about usage or aging; 
however, battery life also depends upon environmental conditions:
 
✓ Operating temperature: Batteries have a limited temperature range over 
which they work. Attempting to use the battery outside these limits usually 
results in a permanent degradation in performance or a complete failure.
 
 Keep the operating temperature limits in mind when selecting your RTLS 
and batteries.
 
✓ Operating pressure: Excessive pressure can cause mechanical failures, 
such as short circuits between parts, interruptions in the current path, 
distortion or swelling of the cell case, or in the worst case, actual rupture 
of the cell casing, within a battery’s cells.
 
 Keep the operating pressure limits to which the tags will be subjected to 
in mind when selecting your RTLS.
Understanding That Not All 
Batteries Are the Same
In real life, note that all batteries (even from the same manufacturer and 
the same model) don’t deliver their rated capacity. This is due to the 
manufacturing variations, and these manufacturing variations happen in 
spite of the fact that manufacturing processes are highly automated and 
mechanized. The main reason behind this is the spread in the materials’ 
properties used in batteries.
History of batteries
Some historians suggest that the earliest known 
batteries were invented over 2,000 years ago in 
Baghdad to electroplate silver on jewelry, and 
some believe that the Egyptians used batteries 
to electroplate antimony onto copper over 4,300 
years ago. However, the key invention that 
formed the basis for modern battery technol-
ogy was done by Alessandro Volta (for whom 
the volt is named) in 1800 in which he demon-
strated that an electrical current is generated 
when metals and chemicals come into contact. 
And even today, batteries aren’t much differ-
ent. Batteries are electrochemical devices that 
convert chemical energy into electrical energy 
or vice versa by means of controlled chemical 
reactions among a set of active chemicals.

269
 Chapter 18: Ten Best Ways to Use Batteries
In fact, this manufacturing tolerance spread is one of the key factors behind 
the wide disparity in the performance of similar batteries from different 
manufacturers.
 
For your RTLS application, not only should you use all batteries from the 
same manufacturer (as well as use the manufacturer and model of batteries 
recommended by your vendor), but you should also assume extra margins for 
battery life over and above the recommendations of your vendor.
Disposing of Used Batteries
Unlike single-use batteries, rechargeable batteries continue to make use of 
potentially toxic heavy metals, such as cadmium, nickel, and lead, which can 
threaten the environment if not properly discarded. Check with your local 
government health, solid waste, or recycling department before you consider 
their disposal.
 
Rechargeable batteries aren’t the only type that can be recycled. Many 
recycling facilities collect and recycle disposable batteries also.
 
Under no circumstances should batteries be incinerated because they can 
explode. If your skin is exposed to an electrolyte, flush with water immediately. 
If eye exposure occurs, flush with water for 15 minutes and consult a physician 
immediately.
Knowing the Importance of Cell Casing
The packaging of your battery, or cell casing, depends on your RTLS application 
and more specifically, on the desired size and shape of tags. That is, the size 
and packaging of the battery dictates the size of tag or vice versa. Here are 
some common types of cell casings:
 
✓ Cylindrical cells: The cylindrical cell is a widely used packaging for 
batteries because it’s easy to manufacture and low in cost. It also 
provides strong mechanical stability and has good energy density. Some 
common cylindrical cell batteries are AA, AAA, and so on.
 
 The drawback of cylindrical cells, however, is that these aren’t available 
in ultra-small size. Because of fixed-cell size, the tag is designed around 
available cell sizes. If you’re working with tags that people wear on their 
wrists, the cylindrical batteries may not be suitable.
 
✓ Button (or coin) cells: The button, or coin, cells were developed to reduce 
size and improve stacking. Built as non-rechargeable or rechargeable, 
these cells are inexpensive to manufacture and are well-suited for small 
tag designs. Button or coin cell batteries are commonly used in watches.

270
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ Prismatic cells: Prismatic cells are contained in a rectangular can — 
commonly reserved for the lithium battery family. The polymer version 
is exclusively prismatic. The electrodes are either stacked or in the form 
of a flattened spiral. They’re usually designed to have a very thin profile. 
Prismatic cell batteries are often used in cell phones.
 
 These batteries are usually custom-made, and no standard cell size 
exists. Because these cells provide better space utilization, slightly 
higher manufacturing costs, lower energy density, less mechanical 
stability, and more vulnerability to swelling aren’t considered major 
disadvantages.
 
✓ Pouch cells: Pouch cells make use of heat-sealable foils, instead of 
metallic enclosures, and a glass-to-metal electrical-feed trough. This 
concept allows you to make efficient use of available space and achieve 
the highest packaging efficiency among all battery packs. Pouch cell 
batteries are often used when high flexibility in form factor is needed, 
such as a battery in an ID badge.
 
 Because of the absence of a metal can, the pouch pack is light. Like 
prismatic cells, these are custom-made, and no standard cell size exists.
 
 Pouch cells typically use lithium polymer chemistries with solid 
electrolytes, providing a low-cost, flexible construction. The electrodes 
and the solid electrolyte are usually stacked in layers or laminations and 
enclosed in a foil envelope.
 
✓ Thin film batteries: Thin film batteries have recently become available 
in commercial quantities. These batteries usually use lithium polymer 
chemistries and can be printed on plastics, thin metal foil, or even 
paper. Thin film batteries are commonly used in semi-passive RFID tags, 
ID badges, and so on.
 
 Because of their small size, the energy storage and current-carrying 
capacity of thin film batteries is low; however, because they’re bendable, 
they can be made in any shape or size, operate over a wide temperature 
range, and have a wide range of uses.
Preventing Sudden or Premature 
Battery Death
Usually batteries don’t exhibit sudden or premature death. The most likely 
cause of premature battery failure is physical abuse or poor maintenance 
practices, such as
 
✓ Subjecting the battery to excessive vibration or shock. Not only should 
you have an understanding of the vibration or the shock the RTLS tag is 
going to be subjected to, but it would also be of immense value if your 
tag can somehow report vibration or shock thresholds.

271
 Chapter 18: Ten Best Ways to Use Batteries
 
✓ Operating or storing the battery in too high or too low ambient 
temperatures.
 
✓ Overcharging or over-discharging as then it may not be possible to 
recharge it.
 
✓ Using the wrong charger, such as one designed for charging batteries 
with different cell chemistries.
Interpreting the Low-Battery Indicator
The purpose of the low-battery indicator is to have an advance indication of 
the amount of remaining battery life so that you know how much longer you 
can use the battery before you have to stop and either replace or recharge it.
Battery capacity detectors and indicators are based on one or more battery 
parameter, such as
 
✓ Voltage: Many batteries exhibit a voltage-drop characteristic in 
which the voltage drops below a specific threshold, indicating lower 
remaining battery capacity. The battery voltage is a nonlinear function 
of everything — temperature, pressure, discharge history, output 
current, phase of the moon. . . . Although you can detect the low voltage 
just fine, it’s very difficult to predict the remaining capacity of the 
battery with its terminal voltage alone.
 
✓ Current: The metrics that are used to indicate the maximum capacity 
of the battery are in the unit of Ah (ampere times hour) or mAh 
(milli-ampere times hour). Typically, battery manufacturers specify the 
theoretic total capacity of the battery in mAh. By knowing the current 
discharge of the battery and the total capacity in mAh, you can compute 
the theoretical lifetime of the battery using this equation:
 
 BLT = C ÷ I
 
 In which BLT = battery lifetime, C = rated maximum battery capacity in 
mAh, and I = discharge current in milli-amperes.
 
 This battery model allows you to measure the remaining capacity by 
subtracting the discharge current used by the application from the 
current capacity. And, by measuring actual current, you can provide 
more realistic battery life because that takes into account the 
deterioration of the useful battery life.
You can actually predict the remaining battery life by monitoring the history 
of the battery life and employing this history as well as the values of voltage 
and current as a basis for subsequent predictions of the useful life of the 
battery.

272
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
Most of these indicators predict when the battery is low but may not be able 
to indicate the actual remaining life because it always depends upon your 
application.
Whatever approach your RTLS vendor uses to indicate low battery, ensure 
that there’s a sufficient margin (so you have enough time to recharge or 
change batteries) and your RTLS won’t stop suddenly if the battery dies. 
Another crucial thing is your ability to have access to a centralized 
dashboard of battery life for all batteries (such as the ones in tags).
Ensuring Battery Safety
As RTLS deployment implies a large number of batteries and battery-based 
products in your business, be sure users read the safety warnings and follow 
operating instructions as a handling restriction to ensure safety. Some 
common safety guidelines for handling batteries are outlined in the following 
list:
 
✓ Never disassemble a battery. The materials inside may be toxic and 
may damage skin and clothes.
 
✓ Never attempt to short-circuit a battery. Doing so can damage the 
product and generate heat that can cause burns.
 
✓ Never throw a battery into a fire. It may explode!
 
✓ Never throw a battery in water. It may cause the battery to fail. If 
there’s a potential for exposure to water to your tags, think about 
enclosures (which I discuss in Chapter 2).
 
✓ Never insert a battery with the positive and negative poles reversed. 
This can cause permanent damage to the battery.
 
✓ Don’t leave the battery in the charger after it’s fully charged.
 
✓ Avoid mixing old and new batteries together.
 
✓ Avoid mixing batteries with differing cell chemistries, such as ordinary 
dry-cell batteries, NiCd, NiMH batteries, or another manufacturer’s 
batteries. Differences in various characteristic values and so on can 
cause damage to the batteries or the product.
 
✓ Don’t put batteries into plastic bags designed to protect components 
from electrostatic discharge. These bags are made from conductive 
material, which could cause the battery to short-circuit.
 
Make sure you offer periodic training for all RTLS users regarding battery 
safety.

273
 Chapter 18: Ten Best Ways to Use Batteries
Preventing Unauthorized Battery Use
For critical applications, authentication may be required to prevent the use 
of unapproved batteries in the application. This may be to
 
✓ Avoid allowing a tag to be operated by a non-authorized battery (or by 
an unauthorized user).
 
✓ Avoid tag reliability issues that may arise because of battery 
incompatibility.
 
✓ Avoid damage to the product’s reputation and the brand if inferior or 
unreliable cells would be used.
Storing Batteries
Batteries start losing capacity right from the moment they leave the factory.
The optimum storage conditions for batteries depend on the active chemicals 
used in the batteries. During storage the batteries are subject to both self-
discharge and possible decomposition of the chemical contents. Over time 
solvents in the electrolyte may permeate through the seals, causing the 
electrolyte to dry out and lose its effectiveness. In all cases, these processes 
are accelerated by heat, and it’s wise to store the cells in a cool, benign 
environment to maximize their shelf life.
 
The recommended storage temperature for most batteries is 15°C (59°F). 
However, you should rely on the details from the battery manufacturer about 
the temperatures and the optimal environment to store your batteries.
 
Although capacity loss during a battery’s storage can’t be eliminated, you can 
minimize the effect by following a few guidelines:
 
✓ Store in a cool and dry area. I recommend refrigeration, but avoid 
freezers. Also, place batteries in plastic bags for refrigeration to protect 
against condensation.
 
✓ Never fully charge or fully discharge before storage. Always keep 
lithium- and nickel-based batteries partially charged because high 
charge levels hasten the capacity loss and self-discharge on an empty 
battery may prevent a future recharge.
 
✓ Avoid full discharge. Recharge before the battery is fully discharged 
because this would wear down the battery unnecessarily.
 
✓ Don’t stockpile. Because batteries lose life with time, buy them or start 
using them as close to the manufacturing date as possible.

274
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ Never overcharge. In nickel batteries, prolonged trickle charge causes 
crystalline formation, or memory effect. Apparently, nickel batteries 
remember the point in their charge cycle when recharging began; during 
subsequent use they suffer a sudden drop in voltage at that point, as if 
the battery had been discharged.
Avoiding Bad Charging
Most batteries are damaged by inappropriate battery charging. The life of a 
recharged battery depends, to a large extent, on the process of charging:
 
✓ The charger should be appropriate for the chosen battery’s cell 
chemistry because the use of unsuitable chargers can damage the 
battery. This is the most important charger requirement.
 
 Don’t buy low-quality battery chargers because the charging of batteries 
is only as good as the charger.
 
✓ Overcharging severely reduces the battery life. Your battery specification 
should indicate the charging time.
 
✓ The charger design should match the intended-use profile of the 
battery. Don’t use a charger for one kind of battery chemistry (say, 
nickel) for a battery of another chemistry (say, lithium).
 
Don’t forget to consider the cost of chargers (and maintenance, such as 
recharging time, replacement costs of chargers, labor, and storage) with 
respect to charging as part of your total cost of ownership of your RTLS 
solution.
 
One of the important things that you should look for as part of your chargers 
is the ability to do some kind of message logging (integrating charging time 
with history) of batteries with your RTLS.

Standardization and Dedicated 
Technology Workforces
A standard is a technical document designed to be used as a rule, guideline, 
or definition. It’s built by consensus and is a repeatable way of doing some-
thing. Because RTLS has many parts (such as technologies, tags, enclosures 
for tags, location sensors, middleware, and application integration inter-
faces), using standards for RTLS choices can provide assurances of perfor-
mance, reliability, safety, and interoperability.
The following sections list some of the most recognized and popular stan-
dardization bodies and technology workforces doing work related to RTLS.
You may also want to participate in meetings, discussions, and events orga-
nized by these groups. The immediate benefits come about through accessing

attention from various authors, scientists, students, universities, businesses, 
organizations, and governments. Lots of experiments, new product develop-
ment, and papers have been written in the RTLS field. A common aim for 
many of these authors and researchers has been improving the overall 
accuracy of location identification in different environments.

284
Part VI: Appendixes 
In the following sections, I include a few references of RTLS-related work 
conducted by some well-cited authors and researchers as well as some key 
projects related to RTLS. You can check out more information about these 
resources on my blog (www.theRTLSBlog.com) or by searching the Internet 
with your favorite search engine.
Active Badge System
The Active Badge location system developed at the Olivetti Research Laboratory 
(now AT&T Cambridge) is an indoor badge-sensing system. This was an early 
and significant contribution to the field of RTLS. (To find out more, see “The 
Active badge Location system,” ACM Transactions on Information Systems, 
Volume 10(1), by R. Want, A. Hopper, V. Falcao, and J. Gibbons.)
In this system, the locating infrastructure consists of fixed infrared receiv-
ers (location sensors) that communicate with the central server (location 
engine) and the small infrared badges (tags) carried by users. The badges 
(tags) emit a globally unique identifier every ten seconds or on-demand. This 
identifier is captured by the infrared receivers in the proximity. The infrared 
receivers send this information to the central server (location engine) that 
computes the tag location.
The location of badge is based on which infrared receiver(s) captured the 
identifier from the tag. For example, if the receiver in Room 20 reports that it 
received the tag identifier, you know the tag is in Room 20.
Active BAT Location System
Active Bat is an indoor localization system that was developed by AT&T 
researchers after Active Badge to provide more accurate locating — it 
reports accuracy in centimeters.
In this system, the locating infrastructure consists of a grid of ultrasonic 
receivers (location sensors) in ceiling tiles connected by a wired serial net-
work and a radio transmitter (controller). The bats (tags) are attached to 
equipment or carried by users and have two components: the ultrasonic 
transmitter and the radio transceiver.
In this model, bats are located one by one. The radio transmitter (controller) 
sends a synchronized reset signal to all the ultrasonic receivers using the 
wired serial network, and then sends a request with radio frequency (RF) to 
one of the bats. Upon receiving the request, the bat emits an ultrasonic mes-
sage that is received by the ceiling receivers in the area. The ceiling receivers 

285
 Appendix A: RTLS Resources and References
measure the time from their synchronized reset to the ultrasonic reception 
and send this Time of Flight (ToF) to the central server (location engine), 
which computes the tag location. The location is computed using multilatera-
tion in which distance between the receiver to the bat is estimated by using 
the ToF of the ultrasonic signal.
HiBall Tracking System
HiBall Tracker is an optical locating system developed initially for indoors, 
exhibiting resolution below 1 mm with excellent stability. The Department 
of Computer Science at the University of North Carolina, Utah, Brown, and 
Caltech collaborated on the design and production of this project. (For more 
information, see “SCAAT: Incremental tracking with incomplete information,” 
Computer Graphics, Volume 31, Annual Conference Series, by G. Welch and G. 
Bishop.)
In this system, the locating infrastructure consists of a panel of infrared LEDs 
embedded in ceiling tiles (location sensors) that take turns flashing. The tag 
is a miniature cluster of six optical sensors looking out for the flashing LEDs. 
The tag’s optical sensors are continuously looking for LED sightings. The 
tag communicates the LED sightings to the central server (location engine) 
that uses knowledge about the geometry of the tag’s cameras to compute 
the location information. The LED flashes very quickly, which allows precise 
information to be obtained. This technology provides a high update rate and 
a low latency — solid tracking even at high speeds. And because of the large 
number of LEDs, it has a built-in redundancy that overcomes most line-of-
sight obstructions.
RADAR
Developed by the Microsoft Research group, RADAR is a building-wide track-
ing system based on the IEEE 802.11 WaveLAN wireless networking technol-
ogy. (For details, see “RADAR: An In-building RF-based User Location and 
Tracking System,” INFOCOM 2000. Nineteenth Annual Joint Conference of the 
IEEE Computer and Communications Societies. Proceedings. IEEE, by 
P. Bahland V. Padmanabhan.)
In this system, the locating infrastructure consists of RF transceivers called 
the base station (location sensors). Generally, laptops or computers with 
WLAN 802.11 are used as base stations and are positioned to provide 
overlapping coverage in the area of interest. The tag is a wireless device 
transmitting signal.

286
Part VI: Appendixes 
The base stations record the signal strength and signal-to-noise ratio of 
the signals that the tags transmit and send this information to the location 
engine. The location engine uses this data to compute the 2D position within 
the building by combining empirical measurements (also referred to as scene 
analysis or fingerprinting) with signal-propagation modeling (to map signal 
strength for distance) for multilateration.
LANDMARC
LANDMARC (a prototype system developed by researchers at the Department 
of Computer Science at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology 
and the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Michigan 
State University) is an indoor locating system. (For more information, see 
“LANDMARC: Indoor Location Sensing Using Active RFID,” Special Issue: 
Pervasive Computing and Communications, by M. Lionel, L. Yunhao, L. Yincho, 
and P. Abhishek.)
In this system, the locating infrastructure consists of radio frequency identi-
fication (RFID) readers at fixed locations and reference tags. Each reader has 
a predetermined power level, thus defining a certain range in which it can 
detect RFID tags. By placing readers in fixed locations, the whole region can 
be divided into a number of sub-regions, in which each sub-region can be 
identified uniquely by the subset of readers that covers that sub-region. The 
readers continuously scan (read) for the tags. In this process, it is constantly 
reading the reference tags.
The tag information gathered from RFID readers is sent to the central server 
(location engine) by a wired or a Wi-Fi network. As dynamic interferences 
(such as obstructions, human movement, and so on) alter the power level 
and detection range of RFID readers, the location engine computes location 
based not only on the tag power level and detection by RFID readers but also 
on the detected range from the reference tags in real time. The idea behind 
these reference tags (used as landmarks — hence the name LANDMARC) is 
that the reference tags are subject to the same effect in the environment as 
the tags to be located.
Cricket
Cricket is an indoor locating system that makes use of RF and ultrasound, 
much like the Active Bat system. (For details, see “The Cricket Location-
Support System,” In Proceeding for the 6th ACM MOBICOM Conference 
[Boston, MA], by N. Priyantha, A. Chakraborty, and H. Balakrisnan.)

287
 Appendix A: RTLS Resources and References
In this system, the locating infrastructure consists of beacons (location sen-
sors) that are small devices attached to fixed locations within the geographic 
space. Each beacon transmits a data string that uniquely identifies the location 
of the area where it is fixed and receivers are embedded in the object (tag) 
being located. The beacons send information about the space over RF together 
with an ultrasonic pulse. The tag hears the RF signal, uses the first few bits as 
training information, and then turns on its ultrasonic receiver. It then listens 
for the ultrasonic pulse, which will usually arrive a short time later.
The tags use the time difference between the receipt of the first bit of RF 
information and the ultrasonic signal to determine the distance to the 
beacon. This approach forces the tags to perform all their own triangulation 
computations. A randomized algorithm allows multiple uncoordinated bea-
cons to coexist in the same space.
NearMe
NearMe is an indoor locating system that uses passive RFID tags. In this 
system, instead of locating tags using readers, readers are located using tags.
A grid of inexpensive passive RFID tags (location sensors) is spread all over 
the building, and room identification (such as room number or room name) 
is stored in each tag. For example, one passive RFID tag is installed on each 
wall of every room, and the corresponding room numbers are stored in the 
tags. A mobile RFID reader (tag) is attached to assets or carried by people 
and it is continuously reading tags around it.
A typical passive RFID reader has a short range (such as 20 feet) and it can 
read only a few tags around it. For example, when the RFID reader enters 
Room 235, it will most likely read one or more tags in that room and the data 
in each tag returns “Room 235.” The RFID reader knows its location. The loca-
tion of asset or person is the room ID (room number or room name) as read 
by the RFID readers.
GLONASS
GLONASS, a Soviet counterpart to the U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS), 
first appeared in 1982, four years after the launch of the first Navstar GPS sat-
ellite. The Russian Military Space Forces’ Global Navigation Satellite System 
(GLONASS) is designed to provide instantaneous, high-precision location 
and speed information to users throughout most of the world. Deployed in 
nearly circular orbits at an altitude of 19,100 kilometers by proton boosters, 

288
Part VI: Appendixes 
each GLONASS satellite emits navigational signals in a 38-degree cone near 
1,250 MHz (L2). GLONASS positional accuracies (95-percent confidence) are 
claimed to be 100 meters on the surface of the Earth, 150 meters in altitude, 
and 15 centimeters per second in velocity.
As of this writing, the system isn’t fully available; however, it’s maintained 
and remains partially operational with 17 operational satellites.
Galileo
Galileo is a global navigation satellite system that at the time of this writing 
is being built by the European Union (EU) and the European Space Agency 
(ESA). This project is an alternative and is complementary to the U.S. Global 
Positioning System (GPS) and the Russian GLONASS.
Galileo is intended to provide more precise measurements (Galileo will be 
accurate down to the meter range) than are currently available through GPS 
or GLONASS, including the height (altitude) above sea level and a better 
positioning service at high latitudes.
Beidou
Beidou, an experimental satellite navigation and positioning system, is 
China’s first space-based regional navigation and positioning network. 
Beidou is composed of four satellites. The system provides all-weather, 
2D-positioning data for military and civilian users. The network covers most 
areas of the East Asia region and has both navigation and communication 
functions. And, China has planned to develop a truly global satellite naviga-
tion system known as Compass or Beidou-2, which will consist of 35 satellites.
Unlike the GPS, GLONASS, and Galileo systems, which use medium Earth-
orbit satellites, Beidou uses satellites in geostationary orbit. This means that 
the system doesn’t require a large constellation of satellites, but it also limits 
the coverage to areas on Earth where the satellites are visible.

Privacy Issues

▶ Allowing users to maintain their personal privacy
▶ Protecting users’ personal privacy
I
n an era where privacy is valued, tagging people for the purpose of locat-
ing them may be met with resistance. And it’s not just about tagging 
people — sometimes even the fact that a person is using a tagged asset 
has the potential to violate privacy. Although merits of tracking people and 
assets are driving RTLS demand, it’s crucial that you understand the impact 
on privacy.
Privacy issues may be grouped roughly into two categories:
 
✓ Allowing personal privacy: Different people, cultures, and nations have 
a wide variety of expectations about how much privacy a person is enti-
tled to or what constitutes an invasion of privacy. In the simplest form, 
privacy is the right of an individual who is carrying or using an RTLS tag 
to be left alone. This relates to the RTLS ability to allow an individual to 
remain unnoticed, unidentified, or untraceable at any time.
 
✓ Protecting personal privacy: This is the ability of an RTLS system to 
keep the meaning of the information transmitted between the tag and 
the reader secure from unintended recipients, such as hackers and 
criminals.
Because any RTLS application’s success depends upon the people who carry 
or use the RTLS tags, without addressing privacy issues carefully, appropri-
ately, and clearly, you can severely limit the RTLS benefits.

290
Part VI: Appendixes 
Allowing Personal Privacy
Employees and visitors typically have to relinquish some of their privacy 
while at the workplace or at a place they’re visiting, but how much they must 
do so can be a contentious issue. RTLS applications, such as providing push-
buttons tags so that they can summon for help during a crisis or they can be 
located during a crisis, make this issue more delicate.
One way to deploy an RTLS in a positive manner is to give people control and 
allow them to choose how the RTLS will be used. For example:
 
✓ Allowing people to make themselves untraceable at any time.
 
✓ Allowing people to make themselves traceable only when they see a 
need. An example is when they’re requesting help in a crisis situation.
 
✓ Allowing people to select what information they want to make avail-
able when you’re trying to locate them. For example, the tag tells you 
the person is a teacher but not that it’s Ms. Shanaya.
Another way is to clearly communicate the policy regarding how an RTLS 
application will allow for personal privacy long before the RTLS investment 
is made. The success of any RTLS application depends upon the people who 
carry or use the RTLS tags, so you must be clear about the use of RTLS tech-
nology involving them.
In your selection of RTLS technology and application, you must consider 
and provide the desired levels of privacy. For example, for an emergency 
response application in which you want to deploy push-button tags, you may 
want to consider how the locating is done. To many privacy advocates, a 
push-button tag that’s located only when the push button is pressed might 
be a better choice compared with a push-button tag that’s always located 
and pressing the push button merely identifies the emergency event.
Protecting Personal Privacy
If nothing else, the Internet teaches one lesson — there’s a lot of interest in 
everything we do and how we do it. To your left are businesses and govern-
ments that want to use this wealth of information, and to your right are crimi-
nals and hackers who want to misuse this information.
Privacy is a boundary you need to define and determine. What may be a per-
sonal matter to you may not be a personal matter to somebody else. Privacy 
is all about you, and you have the opportunity to decide what you want to 
protect and what you don’t care about and can afford it if everyone finds out.

291
 Appendix B: Privacy Issues
Here are the two key types of personal privacy threats:
 
✓ Individual: The threats that identify personal information or specific 
characteristics and behavior of an individual. For example, Jane Doe is 
in the library surfing the Internet.
 
✓ Group: These threats identify specific characteristics and behavior of 
a group of people. For example, all 21–30-year-old employees are taking 
longer breaks and spending more time in the cafeteria.
Whether individual or group, the privacy threats originate because of the 
following:
 
✓ Unauthorized tag readings
 
✓ Using data in ways other than specified originally
Guarding against unauthorized 
tag readings
After the RTLS tags are attached to assets or carried by people, the most 
prominent privacy threat is the possibility of an unauthorized tag reading. 
This unauthorized reading is achieved by reading the tag directly or eaves-
dropping. The following privacy threats originate because of unauthorized 
tag readings:
 
✓ Inventorying
 
✓ Traceability
 
✓ Getting personal data
 
✓ Tracking tag locations
 
✓ Establishing social networks
By making use of RTLS technology in which only encrypted data is exchanged 
among tags, location sensors, and the network, you can ensure that the 
unauthorized entities can’t listen to the data packets exchanged among tags, 
location sensors, and the network. The other ways to protect from this type 
of threat are
 
✓ Use technologies that can’t be listened to from a distance. For example, 
infrared signals don’t penetrate walls and other architectural elements, 
so a tag’s signal is received only within one room.
 
✓ Use closed loop/proprietary technologies that can’t be listened to.

292
Part VI: Appendixes 
 
✓ Use sensors and security mechanisms to monitor any intruders (or 
equipment installed by intruders). This can be part of physical campus 
security. The processes to actively find invisible intruders with technol-
ogy are difficult because most intruders are in receive mode or listening 
mode.
 
✓ Use systems to actively thwart the listening. For example, installing 
systems (similar to the ones installed inside the building) on building 
perimeters to confuse the distant people who are trying to listen for 
data from inside the facility.
Inventorying
Inventorying relates to the ability of an unauthorized entity to read the identi-
fiers sent by RTLS tags without necessarily being concerned as to what the 
tag is affixed to or who or what is carrying it.
In other words, just by capturing the signals emitted by an RTLS tag, a third 
party could trace tag absence, presence, or count, thereby violating the orga-
nization’s privacy.
For example, if a bank starts using RTLS tags on money bags, the intruder, by 
means of an unauthorized reading, can detect the presence and number of 
money bags. And, even if the intruder doesn’t know what exact things a bank 
is attaching tags to, the intruder can correlate that information by watching 
patterns of tag activity.
Traceability
Traceability is similar to inventorying, but the purpose is to locate the tags, 
such as where the tag is or has been, without necessarily being concerned as 
to what the tag is affixed to or who or what is carrying it.
For example, consider a scenario in which an intruder detects the tag activity 
near the facility’s perimeter. With visual aid, the intruder can correlate that 
the tag activity is around the facility’s security guard. Now the intruder, by 
means of an unauthorized reading, can detect the security guard’s location or 
presence.
Getting personal data
A tag may contain personal information. The tag may contain directly iden-
tifiable information, such as a name. The tag also may contain data that 
functions as a key (or pointer) to another database in which more personal 
information is stored.
The privacy threat in the first case is obvious. Whenever the intruder can 
read the tag data, the intruder can establish a link between the tag ID and the 
name of the corresponding person.

293
 Appendix B: Privacy Issues
The privacy threat in the second case — only a key (or pointer) to another 
database — is indirect. The privacy of the tag carrier is invaded only when 
the intruder can access the database with the key. This key itself may also be 
considered as private data because the key alone identifies the person.
Some precautions to protect from this specific attack include
 
✓ Don’t store any personal data in the tag. For example, don’t store 
employees’ names in the tags themselves.
 
✓ Don’t keep the association between the tag and a person fixed (keep 
it changing, or dynamic). For example, instead of having a fixed tag 
assigned to each employee, employees pick up tags from a box of tags at 
start of a work day and return the tags at the end.
Tracking tag locations
In a case where the tag is carried by a person, an intruder can track the cor-
responding person’s location by way of an unauthorized reading.
In a case where the tag is attached to an asset, by correlating the asset loca-
tion and knowing who is authorized to move the asset, the intruder can 
determine the mover’s location whenever the intruder detects the asset’s 
movement.
Establishing social networks
By means of data-mining techniques, you can find correlations between 
separated tags (assets or people). For example, when two tags exhibit 
similar movement patterns and spend time together in a facility, you may 
assume that they’re somehow related to each other. This information can be 
enriched by correlating it with other information collected by other sources.
Regulating the use of data
You may install the RTLS application to collect a specific set of data, but later 
you or one of your colleagues decides to use the data, tags, or location sensors 
for another purpose. The new applications, although originally unperceived, 
may have the potential to violate privacy. You must have some processes for 
self-regulation in place. A few elements of self-regulation include
 
✓ Giving clear notices as well as choice and opportunity to consent before 
changes.
 
✓ No secret (or hidden) tags or location sensors.
 
✓ Strict policies for unauthorized information capture or similar irrespon-
sible behaviors.

294
Part VI: Appendixes 
For example, consider the scenario where the attendants in a nursing home 
facility are tracked to ensure that they’re doing facility rounds and to mea-
sure how much time they spend in rounds. Later, someone has another idea 
(especially because attendants now wear tags when they’re on duty) to cor-
relate the tracked data on rounds with other data (such as Internet usage, 
phone usage, and so on) to analyze what the attendants do when they’re not 
doing their rounds. Although the tracking for rounds may have been accept-
able to the attendants at first, using this data to track their every move may 
be seen as a threat to the attendants’ privacy.
Another example of this privacy threat is when most of the collected data 
is profiled with groups, such as age or race. Although this ensures that per-
sonal data still remains anonymous, it nevertheless threatens privacy.

Appendix C
Realizing the Benefits of an RTLS
In This Appendix
▶ Assessing the benefits of using an RTLS
▶ Creating a benefits realization report
B
efore you invest in an RTLS, it’s critical to quantify added business 
value along its three dimensions of how much, how soon, and how 
certain. Only then can you justify the expense.
The key to assessing how much and how soon your investments will pay off 
is to set expectations and define measurements at the beginning, and the key 
to assessing certainty is understanding the possible risks.
This appendix shows you how to create fact-based benefits realization 
reports so that you can build a compelling business case to justify invest-
ments in an RTLS.
Assessing Benefits
Return on Investment (ROI) is used more or less as a generic term to define the 
business value of an investment. Classic ROI is the ratio of the net gain from 
the investment divided by its total costs. Classic ROI has appeal because of its 
compelling simplicity; however, different companies and people use a variety 
of metrics to measure ROI:
 
✓ Classic ROI: To calculate classic ROI, the benefit (or return) of an invest-
ment is divided by the cost of the investment; the result is expressed as 
a percentage or a ratio.
 
 % ROI = [(Gain from investment – cost of investment) ÷ Cost of 
investment] × 100

296
Part VI: Appendixes 
 
 Keep in mind that there isn’t one “right” calculation for classic ROI — it 
can be manipulated easily to suit the user’s purposes, and the result can 
be expressed in many different ways. Classic ROI depends on what you 
include as returns and costs and what your assumptions are.
 
 Say you can sell $30,000 worth of products with Internet advertisements 
that cost you $500. A marketing person may just present that the ROI for 
Internet advertisement is 5,900 percent (a gain of $30,000 for the cost of 
$500), and you may want to include the total value of all other resources 
(such as material cost, development cost, packaging cost, and so on) 
that have been employed to make and sell the product. I also remember 
seeing one ROI calculation based on reducing three contractors for a 
year with an assumption of $215,000 loaded labor cost per year, when in 
reality, the company was paying $110,000 to the contractors with little 
other costs.
 
 When using this metric, make sure you understand all inputs and 
assumptions that are used. Also, for RTLS solutions, it may not be easy 
to match specific returns (such as increased profits) with the specific 
costs that bring them, and this makes classic ROI less trustworthy as a 
guide for decision support. Classic ROI also becomes less trustworthy as 
a useful metric when the cost figures include allocated or indirect costs, 
which are probably not caused directly by the action or the investment.
 
✓ Payback period: This is defined as the time period required to recover 
the cost of an investment. In other words, it’s the point in time at which 
benefit savings surpass the total project costs. Payback period helps 
you compare attractiveness of one investment to another.
 
✓ NPV: Net present value (NPV) of an investment is a way to compare the 
value of money today with the value of money in the future. A future 
dollar is worth less than a dollar today because of inflation as well as the 
fact that money today can be invested to grow. To use the future dollar 
and today’s dollar in the same formula, the future dollar is discounted 
(for instance, multiplied with a number less than one) to represent its 
value today. This number is the discount rate.
 
 NPV = (Future cash inflows × discount rate) – (Today’s cost of 
investment + [Future cash outflows × discount rate])
 
 Computing NPV requires assuming the discount rate. Discuss this with 
your finance department to determine the discount rate that you can 
use for ROI calculations. If capital costs your company 12 percent, you 
aren’t likely to invest that capital for a 10-percent return.
 
 The following table gives an example of an NPV calculation for an RTLS 
investment that a business is exploring to prevent asset loss (estimated 
to be $36,000 every year). The investment will cost $100,000, and by pre-
venting asset loss, a savings of $36,000 is expected per year.

 The total cash flow is $44,000, and the total NPV of cash flow is $14,084.
 
 This is the most favored formula among finance people because NPV is 
valuable for ranking one project against another. As you can see without 
the payback period, NPV isn’t informative enough. NPV is usually always 
used along with the payback period.
 
✓ Internal Rate of Return (IRR): Because business cases must have posi-
tive NPV for a go or no-go decision, this is what you expect to earn by 
investing in the project to drive the NPV to zero. In other terms, this 
is the value another investment would need to generate in order to be 
equivalent to the cash flows of the investment being considered.
 
✓ Total cost of ownership (TCO): Total cost of ownership is the total 
up-front and ongoing costs for implementing the RTLS solution. TCO 
includes
 
• Capital expenses: The investment in systems, software, tags, loca-
tion sensors, networks, supplies, and so on as needed to deploy 
and maintain the solution.
 
• Implementation costs: The staff and contract labor necessary to 
research, purchase, plan, test, and deploy the proposed solution.
 
• Ongoing maintenance and support: The staff and contract labor to 
manage and support the solution after it’s deployed, the additional 
phone and IT costs, and so on.
 
• Operations and contracts: The recurring fees, leases, time spent 
with attorneys, storage, electricity costs, and general ongoing 
maintenance and support costs.
 
• Change management and training costs: The management during 
a time of change in which you spend time and energy to inform 
involved parties as well as user-training fees and labor and time 
spent for the trainings.
 
 TCO should never be used in isolation because it can drive you to seek 
the lowest cost solution of the project to cover the costs.

298
Part VI: Appendixes 
All the metrics mentioned in the preceding list are nearly meaningless if you 
can’t predict the real benefit. Benefits of an RTLS come in four forms, which I 
discuss in the following sections:
 
✓ Direct (hard) benefits
 
✓ Indirect (hard) benefits
 
✓ Soft benefits
 
✓ Quantifiable soft benefits
Direct (hard) RTLS benefits
Direct benefits are the benefits directly tied to the impact of implementing 
the proposed RTLS solution — a first order, cause and effect. Direct benefits 
are also known as hard benefits, or tangibles, because these are clearly quan-
tifiable, verifiable, and expressed in monetary units. The following sections 
describe the different types of direct RTLS benefits.
 
RTLS business cases fail not because of the lack of direct benefits availability 
but because of the lack of discovery that those benefits actually exist.
Savings
Savings include removing existing costs as well as (future) cost avoidance 
opportunities. For example, labor savings, such as the reduced headcount, 
reduced overtime, and so on; and expense reductions, such as reduced 
inventory, reduced equipment purchases, and so on.
The following list describes some examples of how RTLS can save different 
organizations money:
 
✓ Healthcare: By deploying the RTLS application to locate IVF pumps, you 
can reduce the number of IVF pumps leased, rented, or purchased every 
year because the locating helps
 
• Prevent theft and accidental loss.
 
• Improve asset utilization because most pumps are used more often 
and can be located easily and redistributed if more pumps are 
present in an area than can be used.
 
✓ Mining: By deploying the RTLS application to track equipment, you can 
reduce the time spent in finding shared equipment during shift changes.
 
✓ Manufacturing: By deploying the RTLS application to track tools, you 
can reduce the number of tools and test equipment needed because the 
locating helps reduce search time.

299
 Appendix C: Realizing the Benefits of an RTLS
Revenue benefits
Revenue benefits are the increases in revenue and profit, such as incremen-
tal sales, reduced sales cycles, and so on. The following list provides some 
examples of revenue benefits of using RTLS:
 
✓ Healthcare: By deploying the RTLS application to locate IVF pumps, you 
can potentially increase billing (charge capture) because the locating 
helps track precisely when and where the pump is set up and then bill 
accordingly.
 
✓ Healthcare: By deploying the RTLS application for bed management, 
you can potentially increase net revenues because you get people in and 
out of the hospital faster. You can track real-time notifications of patient 
or bed status (such as occupied, available, assigned, discharge ordered, 
cleaning, no staff, or not in service, and so on), thereby enabling faster 
transport of patients, faster housekeeping, and so on.
 
✓ Manufacturing: By deploying the RTLS application to track tools, you 
can speed up production because locating helps you
 
• Increase tool utilization
 
• Decrease production line down-time because surveys are com-
pleted automatically
Improvements
The improvements benefits, such as working capital, happen as a result of 
RTLS solution deployment. The following list provides a couple of examples 
of the improvements gained by using an RTLS:
 
✓ Healthcare: By deploying the RTLS application to locate IVF pumps, you 
can improve working capital. For example, fewer hard dollars need to be 
allocated for new IVF pump purchases every year.
 
✓ Manufacturing: By deploying the RTLS application to track tools, 
you can reduce turnaround for maintenance operations, allowing for 
reduced physical working space needs.
Indirect RTLS benefits
Indirect benefits, as the name suggests, are likely to happen as a result of 
implementation but aren’t tied directly to the proposed RTLS implementa-
tion. Indirect benefits are hard benefits, or tangibles, because they are clearly 
quantifiable and expressed in monetary units. Indirect benefits are tangible 
because they’re visible, easily understandable, and consistent with the 
observer’s prior experience. In ROI reports, indirect benefits should be dis-
counted to 30–40 percent because tracking these may be a little more difficult 
than tracking direct benefits.

300
Part VI: Appendixes 
 
Indirect benefits are hard and are subject to opinion. For instance, some 
people may see the indirect connection and others may not.
The following list provides some examples of the indirect benefits of working 
with an RTLS in various industries:
 
✓ Healthcare: By deploying the RTLS application to locate IVF pumps, you 
can reduce storage and maintenance needs. Less overage to purchase, 
rent, or lease also results in less space allocated for storage as well as 
less maintenance needs.
 
✓ Manufacturing: By deploying the RTLS application to track tools, you 
can reduce staff’s overtime hours by increasing worker productivity. 
More time can be focused on completing manufacturing tasks rather 
than searching for parts required for the production process.
Soft RTLS benefits
Soft benefits are the payoffs that are neither quantifiable nor expressible in 
monetary units. An example is reducing a worker’s frustration associated 
with locating an asset. For example, in a manufacturing facility, a lot of equip-
ment is shared. Imagine every morning a worker has to look for the equip-
ment he or she needs. You can quantify the time spent looking, but you can’t 
quantify the benefit of the worker being able to use the RTLS to immediately 
locate the tools he or she needs to start working.
The following list describes examples of soft benefits of an RTLS for a few 
example industries:
 
✓ Healthcare: By deploying the RTLS application to locate IVF pumps, 
your staff has to spend less time locating equipment, which increases 
staff productivity and empowers them to do what they were hired to do.
 
 By deploying the RTLS application to improve patient flows, you can 
potentially improve perception and reputation by
 
• Reducing patient waiting time
 
• Tracking patient progress
 
✓ Mining: By deploying the RTLS application for worker safety, you can 
track personnel in hazardous environments in mines, which is crucial in 
the event of an accident. The company instantly knows which workers 
are trapped and whether an employee remains motionless in a hazard-
ous area.

301
 Appendix C: Realizing the Benefits of an RTLS
 
✓ Manufacturing: By deploying the RTLS application to track tools, you 
can reduce staff frustration by improving their ability to find shared 
tools and equipment and to focus on and finish their work.
 
✓ Manufacturing: By deploying the RTLS application to track tools, you 
can improve customer service and customer appreciation because locat-
ing enables
 
• Direct view of the shop floor, which ends the need to manually 
retrieve overall status at any stage
 
• Customers to appreciate the accuracy and timeliness of answers to 
their inquiries
 
Satisfaction or happiness in employees ultimately reflects in your product 
quality, increased market share, and even ultimately, industry-position rank-
ings. Even if these benefits are difficult, or impossible, to accurately predict 
and link them directly to the bottom line, they may provide even greater value 
to the corporation.
Quantifiable RTLS soft benefits
After a benefit is labeled soft, it’s usually a bad idea to include it in your ROI 
reports. Therefore to justify adding soft benefits, the emphasis should be 
on quantified soft benefits. These are the soft benefits that can be calculated 
monetarily (with varied degrees of opinion) and included in the business 
case, but still kept out of the ROI equation.
 
The things that don’t seem measurable actually are. For example, you can 
claim that improving nurse safety will save $100,000 in replacement costs. 
Replacement costs include cost of hiring (such as advertising), new employee 
training, overtime costs (as existing nurses have to work more with one nurse 
less), and so on.
 
✓ Healthcare: By deploying the RTLS application to locate IVF pumps, you 
can track whether your staff is ensuring compliance with regulations, 
such as proper disinfection between uses by different patients. To quan-
tify the benefits of deploying such an application, you can look at your 
past costs and industry average costs spent in case a violation citation 
is received.
 
✓ Healthcare: By deploying the RTLS application to monitor patient flows, 
you can potentially reduce the time your staff has to spend to check the 
status of rooms and beds. The time the staff spends making phone calls 
and visits can be quantified and translated into a hard-dollar value.

302
Part VI: Appendixes 
 
✓ Mining: By deploying the RTLS application for worker safety, you can 
track personnel in hazardous environments. The value of tracking safety 
can be quantified by using past and industry average compensations as 
well as expenses in lawsuits resulting because of the company’s inability 
to locate or help employees who are hurt or killed on the job.
 
✓ Manufacturing: By deploying the RTLS application for tracking tools, 
you can gather information on the time and number of occasions that 
people actually work on work orders and look for shared equipment and 
tools in manual surveys. This time can be quantified and translated into 
a hard-dollar value.
 
Another way to convert a soft benefit into a quantified soft benefit is to gather 
data by asking questions that have a scaled response (such as 1 for not at 
all likely to 5 for very likely), and then using this data to assign a hard-dollar 
value to at least one aspect of the soft benefit.
Creating Benefits Realization Reports
After you assess the benefits, you need to present the data to all stakehold-
ers. My advice is to present the right thing. This data should provide an 
accurate representation of the business value of RTLS, appeal to the deci-
sion-makers, be believable, and capture the total costs and total investments. 
Everyone should be able to understand it and also trust it.
 
Graphs and charts do a better job of communicating than tables with num-
bers. A benefit realization report for RTLS must include charts and graphs 
demonstrating the benefits as well as the cash flows from various benefit 
sources.
Tips for creating reports
Here are some tips on how to create benefit realization reports from the per-
spectives of those who have done it:
 
✓ Solicit input from executives. Make sure you have input from your exec-
utives to uncover the primary concerns of key decision makers. There is 
no benefit in developing the ROI business case if you don’t have general 
buy-in from key parties involved in the decision-making process.
 
✓ Prepare a case study. Talk to users and people at all levels to understand 
how productivity can be improved. Go to where the action is. Watch them 
in action and note it. Individuals at higher levels in an organization may 
not understand how productivity can be improved at different levels.

303
 Appendix C: Realizing the Benefits of an RTLS
 
✓ Consider all the options. It’s important that you consider all the alterna-
tives. Don’t restrict your focus to one technology or approach.
 
✓ Include more than one application. Include ROI and business case for 
at least one more application that’s deployed after the initial applica-
tion. The value of incremental additions not only demonstrates that the 
RTLS can help in many ways, but also the incremental value will make 
your business case solid.
 
✓ Analyze expenses. Spend time looking for expenses and look for repeat-
able expenses.
 
✓ Be precise. Use spreadsheets or some other calculation tool. No one 
appreciates mathematical errors in your report.
 
✓ Avoid techno-speak. It’s important that the business case aligns the 
business requirements with the system’s value and that the results are 
understandable and not incomprehensible techno-speak. With newer 
technologies like the RTLS, it’s pretty easy to get excited about technol-
ogy and easy to focus on technology in an ROI discussion, such as This 
technology is so hot rather than the real benefits.
 
✓ Make sure your ROI benefits are auditable and staggered. Frequent 
auditing will help you ensure you’re on the right path and help you 
design the right milestones for your deployment. And, if none of your 
proposed ROI benefits will hit until the third year of the deployment, it’s 
probably not worth doing. Breaking even can take periods longer than 
six months, but benefits need to start kicking in sooner.
 
✓ Include details. Include details on all benefit statements, underlying 
assumptions, parameters, costs, and your ROI methodology. You want 
to address the most penetrating questions and concerns of those look-
ing to pick apart your report.
 
✓ Discount soft benefits. Soft benefits matter, but underplay them. For 
instance, don’t include them in ROI calculations and don’t spend too 
much time talking about them.
 
✓ Include confidence level, net present value, and payback period. 
Present your results clearly and concisely, such as We are 90 percent 
confident that we can achieve a net present value of $1 million with a pay-
back period of 18 months.
 
✓ Be complete. Include addendums with press releases and Internet 
search results for competition or similar businesses that have deployed 
RTLS solutions for similar or the same problems.
Capturing risks to ROI
Like any other initiative, RTLS solution proposal initiatives have different risks 
associated with them, and this should be called out as part of the analysis. 

304
Part VI: Appendixes 
Having the risk analysis helps you make your analysis realistic, and your 
chances to realize the full benefits you’re expecting increase. Here are a few 
things you should consider during your risk analysis:
 
✓ Underestimating training costs: Nothing ruins ROI faster than lack of 
users using it. One way around this is to ensure easy or obvious use of 
an RTLS application. If people don’t need much training to use it, they 
probably will use it. See if you can fit the training card of your RTLS 
application on a credit card–size document that can fit in wallets.
 
✓ Overvaluing the soft benefits: Don’t become emotionally attached to 
the soft benefits. Soft stuff is soft stuff. Things change, environments 
change, applications change, and perspectives change. Keep the soft 
benefits out of your ROI and interpersonal discussions.
 
✓ Leasing models: Leasing models confuse the ROI calculations because 
costs don’t appear much, and you may select a wrong RTLS technology 
or solution that may seem to be more affordable. Try not to compare a 
leasing model against a capital model; rather, translate one of those to 
the other.
 
✓ Using faulty reasoning: Verify all your assumptions and benefits before 
you include them in your ROI report. You should thoroughly test your 
analysis and its underlying assumptions. In fact, you should have at 
least one user in mind who would actually receive the benefit that you’re 
describing in your analysis.
 
✓ Overlooking decision-making participants: Because each stakeholder 
brings a unique perspective to the decision making, it’s crucial for you 
to know and involve all the decision-making participants. Not only does 
their involvement help you to build a solid business case, but it may 
actually prevent you from overlooking some benefits that can come to 
the table.
