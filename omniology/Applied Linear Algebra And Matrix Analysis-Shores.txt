Preface
This book is about matrix and linear algebra, and their applications. For many students
the tools of matrix and linear algebra will be as fundamental in their professional work
as the tools of calculus; thus it is important to ensure that students appreciate the utility
and beauty of these subjects, as well as understand the mechanics. One way to do so is to
show how concepts of matrix and linear algebra make concrete problems workable. To
this end, applied mathematics and mathematical modeling ought to have an important
role in an introductory treatment of linear algebra.
One of the features of this book is that we weave signiﬁcant motivating examples into
the fabric of the text. Needless to say, I hope that instructors will not omit this ma-
terial; that would be a missed opportunity for linear algebra! The text has a strong
orientation towards numerical computation and applied mathematics, which means that
matrix analysis plays a central role. All three of the basic components of linear algebra
– theory, computation and applications – receive their due. The proper balance of these
components will give a diverse audience of physical science, social science, statistics,
engineering and math students the tools they need as well as the motivation to acquire
these tools. Another feature of this text is an emphasis on linear algebra as an exper-
imental science; this emphasis is to be found in certain examples, computer exercises
and projects. Contemporary mathematical software makes an ideal “lab” for mathemat-
ical experimentation. At the same time, this text is independent of speciﬁc hardware
and software platforms. Applications and ideas should play center stage, not software.
This book is designed for an introductory course in matrix and linear algebra. It is
assumed that the student has had some exposure to calculus. Here are some of its main
goals:
 To provide a balanced blend of applications, theory and computation which em-
phasizes their interdependence.
 To assist those who wish to incorporate mathematical experimentation through
computer technology into the class. Each chapter has an optional section on
computational notes and projects and computer exercises sprinkled throughout.
The student should use the locally available tools to carry out the experiments
suggested in the project and use the word processing capabilities of the com-
puter system to create small reports on his/her results. In this way they gain
experience in the use of the computer as a mathematical tool. One can also en-
vision reports on a grander scale as mathematical “term papers.” I have made
such assignments in some of my own classes with delightful results. A few
major report topics are included in the text.

PREFACE
 To help students to think precisely and express their thoughts clearly. Requir-
ing written reports is one vehicle for teaching good expression of mathematical
ideas. The projects given in this text provide material for such reports.
 To encourage cooperative learning. Mathematics educators are becoming in-
creasingly appreciative of this powerful mode of learning. Team projects and
reports are excellent vehicles for cooperative learning.
 To promote individual learning by providing a complete and readable text. I
hope that students will ﬁnd the text worthy of being a permanent part of their
reference library, particularly for the basic linear algebra needed for the applied
mathematical sciences.
An outline of the book is as follows: Chapter 1 contains a thorough development of
Gaussian elimination and an introduction to matrix notation. It would be nice to assume
that the student is familiar with complex numbers, but experience has shown that this
material is frequently long forgotten by many. Complex numbers and the basic lan-
guage of sets are reviewed early on in Chapter 1. (The advanced part of the complex
number discussion could be deferred until it is needed in Chapter 4.) In Chapter 2, basic
properties of matrix and determinant algebra are developed. Special types of matrices,
such as elementary and symmetric, are also introduced. About determinants: some in-
structors prefer not to spend too much time on them, so I have divided the treatment
into two sections, one of which is marked as optional and not used in the rest of the text.
Chapter 3 begins by introducing the student to the “standard” Euclidean vector spaces,
both real and complex. These are the well springs for the more sophisticated ideas of
linear algebra. At this point the student is introduced to the general ideas of abstract
vector space, subspace and basis, but primarily in the context of the standard spaces.
Chapter 4 introduces goemetrical aspects of standard vectors spaces such as norm, dot
product and angle. Chapter 5 provides an introduction to eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
Subsequently, general norm and inner product concepts are examined in Chapter 5. Two
appendices are devoted to a table of commonly used symbols and solutions to selected
exercises.
Each chapter contains a few more “optional” topics, which are independent of the non-
optional sections. I say this realizing full well that one instructor’s optional is another’s
mandatory. Optional sections cover tensor products, linear operators, operator norms,
the Schur triangularization theorem and the singular value decomposition. In addition,
each chapter has an optional section of computational notes and projects. I have em-
ployed the convention of marking sections and subsections that I consider optional with
an asterisk. Finally, at the end of each chapter is a selection of review exercises.
There is more than enough material in this book for a one semester course. Tastes vary,
so there is ample material in the text to accommodate different interests. One could
increase emphasis on any one of the theoretical, applied or computational aspects of
linear algebra by the appropriate selection of syllabus topics. The text is well suited to
a course with a three hour lecture and lab component, but the computer related material
is not mandatory. Every instructor has her/his own idea about how much time to spend
on proofs, how much on examples, which sections to skip, etc.; so the amount of mate-
rial covered will vary considerably. Instructors may mix and match any of the optional
sections according to their own interests, since these sections are largely independent

of each other. My own opinion is that the ending sections in each chapter on computa-
tional notes and projects are partly optional. While it would be very time consuming to
cover them all, every instructor ought to use some part of this material. The unstarred
sections form the core of the book; most of this material should be covered. There are
27 unstarred sections and 12 optional sections. I hope the optional sections come in
enough ﬂavors to please any pure, applied or computational palate.
Of course, no one shoe size ﬁts all, so I will suggest two examples of how one might use
this text for a three hour one semester course. Such a course will typically meet three
times a week for ﬁfteen weeks, for a total of 45 classes. The material of most of the the
unstarred sections can be covered at a rate of about one and one half class periods per
section. Thus, the core material could be covered in about 40 class periods. This leaves
time for extra sections and and in-class exams. In a two semester course or a semester
course of more than three hours, one could expect to cover most, if not all, of the text.
If the instructor prefers a course that emphasizes the standard Euclidean spaces, and
moves at a more leisurely pace, then the core material of the ﬁrst ﬁve chapters of the
text are sufﬁcient. This approach reduces the number of unstarred sections to be covered
from 27 to 23.
In addition to the usual complement of pencil and paper exercises (with selected so-
lutions in Appendix B), this text includes a number of computer related activities and
topics. I employ a taxonomy for these activities which is as follows. At the lowest level
are computer exercises. Just as with pencil and paper exercises, this work is intended to
develop basic skills. The difference is that some computing equipment (ranging from
a programmable scientiﬁc calculator to a workstation) is required to complete such ex-
ercises. At the next level are computer projects. These assignments involve ideas that
extend the standard text material, possibly some experimentation and some written ex-
position in the form of brief project papers. These are analogous to lab projects in the
physical sciences. Finally, at the top level are reports. These require a more detailed
exposition of ideas, considerable experimentation – possibly open ended in scope, and a
carefully written report document. Reports are comparable to “scientiﬁc term papers”.
They approximate the kind of activity that many students will be involved in through
their professional life. I have included some of my favorite examples of all three ac-
tivities in this textbook. Exercises that require computing tools contain a statement to
that effect. Perhaps projects and reports I have included will be paradigms for instruc-
tors who wish to build their own project/report materials. In my own classes I expect
projects to be prepared with text processing software to which my students have access
in a mathematics computer lab.
Projects and reports are well suited for team efforts. Instructors should provide back-
ground materials to help the students through local system dependent issues. For exam-
ple, students in my own course are assigned a computer account in the mathematics lab
and required to attend an orientation that contains speciﬁc information about the avail-
able linear algebra software. When I assign a project, I usually make available a Maple
or Mathematica notebook that amounts to a brief background lecture on the subject of
the project and contains some of the key commands students will need to carry out the
project. This helps students focus more on the mathematics of the project rather than
computer issues.

PREFACE
Most of the computational computer tools that would be helpful in this course fall into
three categories and are available for many operating systems:
 Graphing calculators with built-in matrix algebra capabilities such as the HP
28 and 48, or the TI 85 and 92. These use ﬂoating point arithmetic for system
solving and matrix arithmetic. Some do eigenvalues.
 Computer algebra systems (CAS) such as Maple, Mathematica and Macsyma.
These software products are fairly rich in linear algebra capabilities. They pre-
fer symbolic calculations and exact arithmetic, but will do ﬂoating point calcu-
lations, though some coercion may be required.
 Matrix algebra systems (MAS) such as MATLAB or Octave. These software
products are speciﬁcally designed to do matrix calculations in ﬂoating point
arithmetic, though limited symbolic capabilities are available in the basic pro-
gram. They have the most complete set of matrix commands of all categories.
In a few cases I have included in this text some software speciﬁc information for some
projects, for the purpose of illustration. This is not to be construed as an endorsement
or requirement of any particular software or computer. Projects may be carried out with
different software tools and computer platforms. Each system has its own strengths. In
various semesters I have obtained excellent results with all these platforms. Students
are open to all sorts of technology in mathematics. This openness, together with the
availability of inexpensive high technology tools, is changing how and what we teach
in linear algebra.
I would like to thank my colleagues whose encouragement has helped me complete this
project, particularly Jamie Radcliffe, Jim Lewis, Dale Mesner and John Bakula. Special
thanks also go to Jackie Kohles for her excellent work on solutions to the exercises
and to the students in my linear algebra courses for relentlessly tracking down errors.
I would also like to thank my wife, Muriel, for an outstanding job of proofreading and
editing the text.
I’m in the process of developing a linear algebra home page of material such as project
notebooks, supplementary exercises, etc, that will be useful for instructors and students
of this course. This site can be reached through my home page at
http://www.math.unl.edu/~tshores/
I welcome suggestions, corrections or comments on the site or book; both are ongoing
projects. These may be sent to me at tshores@math.unl.edu.

CHAPTER 1
LINEAR SYSTEMS OF EQUATIONS
There are two central problems about which much of the theory of linear algebra re-
volves: the problem of ﬁnding all solutions to a linear system and that of ﬁnding an
eigensystem for a square matrix. The latter problem will not be encountered until Chap-
ter 4; it requires some background development and even the motivation for this prob-
lem is fairly sophisticated. By contrast the former problem is easy to understand and
motivate. As a matter of fact, simple cases of this problem are a part of the high school
algebra background of most of us. This chapter is all about these systems. We will
address the problem of when a linear system has a solution and how to solve such a sys-
tem for all of its solutions. Examples of linear systems appear in nearly every scientiﬁc
discipline; we touch on a few in this chapter.
1.1. Some Examples
Here are a few elementary examples of linear systems:
EXAMPLE 1.1.1. For what values of the unknowns
x and
y are the following equations
satisﬁed?
x
+
2y
=
5
4x
+
y
=
6
SOLUTION. The ﬁrst way that we were taught to solve this problem was the geometrical
approach: every equation of the form
ax
+
by
+
c
=
0 represents the graph of a straight
line, and conversely, every line in the xy-plane is so described. Thus, each equation
above represents a line. We need only graph each of the lines, then look for the point
where these lines intersect, to ﬁnd the unique solution to the graph (see Figure 1.1.1). Of
course, the two equations may represent the same line, in which case there are inﬁnitely
many solutions, or distinct parallel lines, in which case there are no solutions. These
could be viewed as exceptional or “degenerate” cases. Normally, we expect the solution
to be unique, which it is in this example.
We also learned how to solve such an equation algebraically: in the present case we
may use either equation to solve for one variable, say
x, and substitute the result into
the other equation to obtain an equation which is easily solved for
y
: For example,
the ﬁrst equation above yields
x
=
5
 2y and substitution into the second yields
4(5
 2y
)
+
y
=
6 , i.e.,
 7y
=
 14, so that
y
=
2: Now substitute 2 for
y in the ﬁrst
equation and obtain that
x

SOLUTION. The geometrical approach becomes somewhat impractical as a means of
obtaining an explicit solution to our problem: graphing in three dimensions on a ﬂat
sheet of paper doesn’t lead to very accurate answers! Nonetheless, the geometrical
point of view is useful, for it gives us an idea of what to expect without actually solving
the system of equations.
With reference to our system of three equations in three unknowns, the ﬁrst fact to
take note of is that each of the three equations is an instance of the general equation
ax
+
by
+
cz
+
d
=
0: Now we know from analytical geometry that the graph of this
equation is a plane in three dimensions, and conversely every such plane is the graph of
some equation of the above form. In general, two planes will intersect in a line, though
there are exceptional cases of the two planes represented being identical or distinct
and parallel. Hence we know the geometrical shape of the solution set to the ﬁrst two
equations of our system: a plane, line or point. Similarly, a line and plane will intersect
in a point or, in the exceptional case that the line and plane are parallel, their intersection
will be the line itself or the empty set. Hence, we know that the above system of three
equations has a solution set that is either empty, a single point, a line or a plane.
Which outcome occurs with our system of equations? We need the algebraic point of
view to help us calculate the solution. The matter of dealing with three equations and
three unknowns is a bit trickier than the problem of two equations and unknowns. Just
as with two equations and unknowns, the key idea is still to use one equation to solve
for one unknown. Since we have used one equation up, what remains is two equations
in the remaining unknowns. In this problem, subtract
2 times the ﬁrst equation from the
second and
4 times the ﬁrst equation from the third to obtain the system

which are easily solved to obtain

2: Now substitute into the ﬁrst equation
and obtain that
x
=
1: We can see that the graphical method of solution becomes
impractical for systems of more than two variables, though it still tells us about the
qualitative nature of the solution. This solution can be discerned roughly in Figure 1.1.2.
Some Key Notation
Here is a formal statement of the kind of equation that we want to study in this chapter.
This formulation gives us a means of dealing with the general problem later on.

: This systematic
way of describing the system will come in handy later,when we introduce the matrix
concept.
* Examples of Modeling Problems
It is easy to get the impression that linear algebra is about the simple kinds of problems
of the preceding examples. So why develop a whole subject? Next we consider two
examples whose solutions will not be so apparent as the previous two examples. The
real point of this chapter, as well as that of Chapters 2 and 3, is to develop algebraic and
geometrical methodologies which are powerful enough to handle problems like these.
Diffusion Processes
We consider a diffusion process arising from the ﬂow of heat through a homogeneous
material substance. A basic physical observation to begin with is that heat is directly
proportional to temperature. In a wide range of problems this hypothesis is true, and
we shall always assume that we are modeling such a problem. Thus, we can measure
the amount of heat at a point by measuring temperature since they differ by a known
constant of proportionality. To ﬁx ideas, suppose we have a rod of material of unit
length, say, situated on the x-axis, for
0

x

1: Suppose further that the rod is
laterally insulated, but has a known internal heat source that doesn’t change with time.
When sufﬁcient time passes, the temperature of the rod at each point will settle down
to “steady state” values, dependent only on position
x: Say the heat source is described
by a function
f
(x);
0

x

1;which gives the additional temperature contribution per
unit length per unit time due to the heat source at the point
x: Also suppose that the left
and right ends of the rod are held at ﬁxed at temperatures
y
0 and
y
1
:
How can we model a steady state? Imagine that the continuous rod of uniform material
is divided up into a ﬁnite number of equally spaced points, called nodes, namely
x
0
=
0;
x
1
;
:::;
x
n+1
=
1 and that all the heat is concentrated at these points. Assume the
nodes are a distance
h apart. Since spacing is equal, the relation between
h and
n is
h
=
1=(n
+
1): Let the temperature function be
y
(x) and let
y
i
=
y
(x
i
): Approximate

1.1. SOME EXAMPLES

y
(x) in between nodes by connecting adjacent points
(x
i
;
y
i
) with a line segment. (See
Figure 1.1.3 for a graph of the resulting approximation to
y
(x):) We know that at the
end nodes the temperature is speciﬁed:
y
(x

)
=
y
0 and
y

)

the process at each interior node, we can obtain the following linear equation for each


1: Suppose further that the rod is laterally insulated, but
has a known internal heat source and that both the left and right ends of the rod are
held at
0 degrees Fahrenheit. What are the steady state equations approximately for this
problem?
SOLUTION. Follow the notation of the discussion preceding this example. Notice that
in this case
x
i
=
ih: Remember that
y
0 and
y
n+1 are known to be
0, so the terms
y
0
and
y
n+1 disappear. Thus we have from Equation 1.1.2 that there are
n equations in the
unknowns
y
i
;
i
=
1;
2;
:
:
:
;
n:
It is reasonable to expect that the smaller
h is, the more accurately
y
i will approximate
y
(x
i
): This is indeed the case. But consider what we are confronted with when we take
n
=
5, i.e.,
h
=
1=(5
+
1)
=
1=6, which is hardly a small value of
h: The system of
ﬁve equations in ﬁve unknowns becomes

This problem is already about as large as we would want to work by hand. The basic
ideas of solving systems like this are the same as in Example 1.1.1 and 1.1.2, though
for very small
h, say
h
=
:01, clearly we would like some help from a computer or
calculator.
*Derivation of the diffusion equations. We follow the notation that has already
been developed, except that the values
y
i will refer to quantity of heat rather than tem-
perature (this will yield equations for temperature, since heat is a constant times tem-
perature). What should happen at an interior node? The explanation requires one more
experimentally observed law known as Fourier’s heat law. It says that the ﬂow of heat
per unit length from one point to another is proportional to the rate of change in tem-
perature with respect to distance and moves from higher temperature to lower. The
constant of proportionality
k is known as the conductivity of the material. In addition,
we interpret the heat created at node
x
i to be
hf
(x

), since
f measures heat created per
unit length. Count ﬂow towards the right as positive. Thus, at node

Input-Output models
We are going to set up a simple model of an economy consisting of three sectors that
supply each other and consumers. Suppose the three sectors are (E)nergy, (M)aterials
and (S)ervices and suppose that the demands of a sector are proportional to its output.
This is reasonable; if, for example, the materials sector doubled its output, one would
expect its needs for energy, material and services to likewise double. Now let
x;
y
;
z be
the total outputs of the sectors E,M and S respectively. We require that the economy
be closed in the sense that everything produced in the economy is consumed by the
economy. Thus, the total output of the sector E should equal the amounts consumed by
all the sectors and the consumers.
EXAMPLE 1.1.6. Given the following table of demand constants of proportionality and
consumer (D)emand (a ﬁxed quantity) for the output of each service, express the closed
property of the system as a system of equations.

SOLUTION. Consider how we balance the total output and demands for energy. The
total output is
x units. The demands from the three sectors E,M and S are, according to
the table data,
0:2x;
0:3y and
0:1z
; respectively. Further, consumers demand
2 units of
energy. In equation form

The questions that interest economists are whether or not this system has solutions, and
if so, what they are.
Note: In some of the text exercises you will ﬁnd references to “your computer system.”
This may be a calculator that is required for the course or a computer system for which
you are given an account. This textbook does not depend on any particular system, but
certain exercises require a computational device. The abbreviation “MAS” stands for a
matrix algebra system like MATLAB or Octave. Also, the shorthand “CAS” stands for
a computer algebra system like Maple, Mathematica or MathCad. A few of the projects
are too large for most calculators and will require a CAS or MAS.

other divisions for its services. The fraction of commodities consumed by each division

One wants to know what price should each division charge for its commodity so that
each division earns exactly as much as it spends? Such a pricing scheme is called
an equilibrium price structure; it assures that no division will earn too little to do its
job. Let
x,

z and
w be the price per unit commodity charged by A, M, S and T,
respectively. The requirement of expenditures equaling earnings for each division result
in a system of four equations. Find these equations.

The Language of Sets
The language of sets pervades all of mathematics. It provided a convenient shorthand
for expressing mathematical statements. Loosely speaking, a set can be deﬁned as a
collection of objects, called the members of the set. This deﬁnition will sufﬁce for
us. We use some shorthand to indicate certain relationships between sets and elements.
Usually, sets will be designated by upper case letters such as
A,
B, etc., and elements
will be designated by lower case letters such as
a,
b, etc. As usual, a set
A is a subset of
the set
B if every element of
A is an element of
B
; and a proper subset if it is a subset
not equal to
B
: Two sets
A and
B are said to be equal if they have exactly the same
elements. Some shorthand:
; denotes the empty set, i.e., the set with no members.

About Numbers
One could spend a full course fully developing the properties of number systems. We
won’t do that, of course, but we will review some of the basic sets of numbers, and
assume the reader is familiar with properties of numbers we have not mentioned here.

10
1. LINEAR SYSTEMS OF EQUATIONS
At the start of it all are the kind of numbers that every child knows something about –
the natural or counting numbers. This is the set
N
=
f1;
2;
3;
:
:
:
g
One could view most subsequent expansions of the concept of number as a matter of
rising to the challenge of solving equations. For example, we cannot solve the equation
x
+
m
=
n;
m;
n
2
N
for the unknown
x without introducing subtraction and extending the notion of natural
number that of integer. The set of integers is denoted by
Z
=
f0;
1;
2;
:
:
:
g:
Next, we cannot solve the equation
ax
=
b;
a;
b
2
Z
for the unknown
x with introducing division and extending the notion of integer to that
of rational number. The set of rationals is denoted by
Q
=
fa=b
j
a;
b
2
Z and
b
6=
0g:
Rational number arithmetic has some characteristics that distinguish it from integer
arithmetic. The main difference is that nonzero rational numbers have multiplicative
inverses (the multiplicative inverse of
a=b is
b=a). Such a number system is called a
ﬁeld of numbers. In a nutshell, a ﬁeld of numbers is a system of objects, called numbers,
together with operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division that satisfy
the usual arithmetic laws; in particular, it must be possible to subtract any number from
any other and divide any number by a nonzero number to obtain another such number.
The associative, commutative, identity and inverse laws must hold for each of addition
and multiplication; and the distributive law must hold for multiplication over addition.
The rationals form a ﬁeld of numbers; the integers don’t since division by nonzero
integers is not always possible if we restrict our numbers to integers.
The jump from rational to real numbers cannot be entirely explained by algebra, al-
though algebra offers some insight as to why the number system still needs to be ex-
tended. An equation like
x
2
=
2
does not have a rational solution, since
p
2 is irrational. (Story has it that this is lethal
knowledge, in that followers of a Pythagorean cult claim that the gods threw overboard
a ship one of their followers who was unfortunate enough to discover the fact.) There
is also the problem of numbers like
 and Euler’s constant
e which do not even satisfy
any polynomial equation. The heart of the problem is that if we only consider rationals
on a number line, there are many “holes” which are ﬁlled by numbers like
 or
p
2
:
Filling in these holes leads us to the set
R of real numbers, which are in one-to-one
correspondence with the points on a number line. We won’t give an exact deﬁnition
of the set of real numbers. Recall that every real number admits a (possibly inﬁnite)
decimal representation, such as
1=3
=
0:333
:
:
: or

=
3:14159
:
:
:
: This provides us
with a loose deﬁnition: real numbers are numbers that can be expressed by a decimal
representation, i.e., limits of ﬁnite decimal expansions.

There is one more problem to overcome. How do we solve a system like

x is real, then
x

0: We
need to extend our number system one more time, and this leads to the set

If the complex number
z
=
a
+
bi is given, then we say that the form
a
+
bi is the
Standard Form
standard form of
z
: In this case the real part of
z is
<(z
)
=
a and the imaginary part is
deﬁned as
=(z
)
=
b: (Notice that the imaginary part of
z is a real number: it is the real
coefﬁcient of
i.) Two complex numbers are equal precisely when they have the same
real parts and the same imaginary parts. All of this could be put on a more formal basis
by initially deﬁning complex numbers to be ordered pairs of real numbers. We will not
do so, but the fact that complex numbers behave like ordered pairs of real numbers leads
to an important geometrical insight: complex numbers can be identiﬁed with points in
the plane. Instead of an x and y axis, one lays out a real and imaginary axis (which is
still usually labeled with
x and
y) and plots complex numbers
a
+
bi as in Figure 1.2.1.
This results in the so-called complex plane.
Arithmetic in
C is carried out by using the usual laws of arithmetic for
R and the alge-
braic identity
i
2
=
 1 to reduce the result to standard form. Thus we have the following
laws of complex arithmetic.
(a

In particular, notice that complex addition is exactly like the vector addition of plane
vectors. Complex multiplication does not admit such a simple interpretation.

in hand, we have a number system so complete that we can solve any polynomial equa-
tion in it. We won’t offer a proof of this fact – it’s very nontrivial. Sufﬁce it to say
that nineteenth century mathematicians considered this fact so fundamental that they
dubbed it the “Fundamental Theorem of Algebra,” a terminology we adopt.

Note that the Fundamental Theorem doesn’t tell us how to ﬁnd a root of a polynomial
– only that it can be done. As a matter of fact, there are no general formulas for the
roots of a polynomial of degree greater than four, which means that we have to resort to
numerical approximations in most cases.
In vector space theory the numbers in use are sometimes called scalars, and we will use
this term. Unless otherwise stated or suggested by the presence of
i, the ﬁeld of scalars
in which we do arithmetic is assumed to be the ﬁeld of real numbers. However, we shall
see later when we study eigensystems, that even if we are only interested in real scalars,
complex numbers have a way of turning up quite naturally.
Let’s do a few more examples of complex number manipulation.

team this fact up with the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, we see an interesting fact
about factoring polynomials over
C : every polynomial can be completely factored into
a product of linear polynomials of the form
z
 a times a constant. The numbers
a that
occur are exactly the roots of
f
(z

: But how can we use the Fundamental
Theorem of Algebra in a practical way to ﬁnd the roots of a polynomial? Unfortunately,
the usual proofs of Fundamental Theorem of Algebra don’t offer a clue because they
are non-constructive, i.e., they prove that solutions must exist, but do not show how to
explicitly construct such a solution. Usually, we have to resort to numerical methods
to get approximate solutions, such as the Newton’s method used in calculus. For now,
we will settle on a few ad hoc methods for solving some important special cases. First

degree equations offer little difﬁculty: the solution to
ax
=
b is
x
=
b=a, as usual. The
one detail to attend to: what complex number is represented by the expression
b=a ? We
saw how to handle this by the trick of “rationalizing” the denominator in Example 1.2.7.
Quadratic equations are also simple enough: use the quadratic formula, which says that

There is one little catch: what does the square root of a complex number mean? What
we are really asking is this: how do we solve the equation
z
2
=
d for
z, where
d is a
complex number? Let’s try for a little more: how do we solve
z
n
=
d for all possible
solutions
z, where
d is a given complex number? In a few cases, such an equation is
quite easy to solve. We know, for example, that
z
=
i are solutions to
z
2
=
 1, so
these are all the solutions. Similarly, one can check by hand that
1;
i are all solutions
to
z
4
=
1: Consequently,
z
4
 1
=
(z
 1)(z
+
1)(z
 i)(z
+
i): Roots of the equation
z
n
=
1 are sometimes called the
nth roots of unity. Thus the
4th roots of unity are
1
and
i: But what about something like
z

=

i?
The key to answering this question is another form of a complex number

in radians, is called the polar form of
z
: The number
r is just the absolute value of

The number

As the notation suggests, polar forms obey the laws of exponents. A simple application
of the laws for the sine and cosine of a sum of angles shows that for angles

Taking absolute values of both sides yields that

real number
d this meant the positive root of the equation

d: But when

roots of

1.3. Gaussian Elimination: Basic Ideas
We return now to the main theme of this chapter, which is the systematic solution of
linear systems, as deﬁned in equation 1.1.1 of Section 1.1. The principal methodology
is the method of Gaussian elimination and its variants, which we introduce by way of
a few simple examples. The idea of this process is to reduce a system of equations by

1.3. GAUSSIAN ELIMINATION: BASIC IDEAS
19
certain legitimate and reversible algebraic operations (called “elementary operations”)
to a form where we can easily see what the solutions to the system, if any, are. Specif-
ically, we want to get the system in a form where only the ﬁrst equation involves the
ﬁrst variable, only the ﬁrst and second involve the next variable to be solved for, and so
forth. Then it will be simple to solve for each variable one at a time, starting with the
last equation and variable. In a nutshell, this is Gaussian elimination.
One more matter that will have an effect on our description of solutions to a linear
system is that of the number system in use. As we noted earlier, it is customary in
linear algebra to refer to numbers as “scalars.” The two basic choices of scalar ﬁelds
are the real number system or the complex number system. Unless complex numbers
occur explicitly in a linear system, we will assume that the scalars to be used in ﬁnding
a solution come from the ﬁeld of real numbers. Such will be the case for most of the
problems in this chapter.
An Example and Some Shorthand
EXAMPLE 1.3.1. Solve the simple system
2x
 y
=
1
4x
+
4y
=
20
(1.3.1)
SOLUTION. First, let’s switch the equations to obtain
4x
+
4y
=
20
2x
 y
=
1
(1.3.2)
Next, multiply the ﬁrst equation by
1=4 to obtain
x
+
y
=
5
2x
 y
=
1
(1.3.3)
Now, multiply a copy of the ﬁrst equation by
 2 and add it to the second. We can do this
easily if we take care to combine like terms as we go. In particular, the resulting
x term
in the new second equation will be
 2x
+
2x
=
0, the
y term will be
 2y
 y
=
 3y,
and the constant term on the right hand side will be
 2

5
+
1
=
 9: Thus we obtain
x
+
y
=
5
0x
 3y
=
 9
(1.3.4)
This completes the ﬁrst phase of Gaussian elimination, which is called “forward solv-
ing.” Note that we have put the system in a form where only the ﬁrst equation involves
the ﬁrst variable and only the ﬁrst and second involve the second variable. The second
phase of Gaussian elimination is called “back solving”, and it works like it sounds. Use
the last equation to solve for the last variable, then work backwards, solving for the
remaining variables in reverse order. In our case, the second equation is used to solve
for
y simply by dividing by
 3 to obtain that
y
=
 9
 3
=
3
Now that we know what
y is, we can use the ﬁrst equation to solve for
x, and we obtain
x
=
5
 y
=
5

1. LINEAR SYSTEMS OF EQUATIONS
The preceding example may seem like too much work for such a simple system. We
could easily scratch out the solution in much less space. But what if the system is
larger, say
4 equations in
4 unknowns, or more? How do we proceed then? It pays
to have a systematic strategy and notation. We also had an ulterior motive in the way
we solved this system. All of the operations we will ever need to solve a linear system
were illustrated in the preceding example: switching equations, multiplying equations
by nonzero scalars, and adding a multiple of one equation to another.
Before proceeding to another example, let’s work on the notation a bit. Take a closer
look at the system of equations (1.3.1). As long as we write numbers down systemat-
ically, there is no need to write out all the equal signs or plus signs. Isn’t every bit of
information that we require contained in the following table of numbers?

2
 1

20

Of course, we have to remember that the ﬁrst two columns of numbers are coefﬁcients
of
x and
y
; respectively, and the third column consists of right hand side terms. So we
could embellish the table with a few reminders in the top row:
2
4
x
y
=
r
:h:s:
2
 1
1
4
4
20
3
5
With a little practice, we will ﬁnd that the reminders are usually unnecessary; so we
dispense with them for the most part. We can see that rectangular tables of numbers
are very useful in representing a system of equations. Such a table is one of the basic
objects studied in this text. As such, it warrants a formal deﬁnition.
DEFINITION 1.3.2. A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers. If a matrix has
m rows
Matrices and
Vectors
and
n columns, then the size of the matrix is said to be
m

n: If the matrix is
1

n
or
m

1, it is called a vector. Finally, the number that occurs in the
ith row and
jth
column is called the
(i;
j
)th entry of the matrix.
The objects we have just deﬁned are basic “quantities” of linear algebra and matrix
analysis, along with scalar quantities. Although every vector is itself a matrix, we want
to single vectors out when they are identiﬁed as such. Therefore, we will follow a
standard typographical convention: matrices are usually designated by capital letters,
while vectors are usually designated by boldface lower case letters. In a few cases these
conventions are not followed, but the meaning of the symbols should be clear from
context.
We shall need to refer to parts of a matrix. As indicated above, the location of each
entry of a matrix is determined by the index of the row and column it occupies.
NOTATION 1.3.3. The statement “A
=
[a
ij
]” means that
A is a matrix whose
(i;
j
)th
entry is denoted by
a
ij
: Generally, the size of
A will be clear from context. If we want
to indicate that
A is an
m

n matrix, we write
A
=
[a
ij
]
m;n
:
Similarly, the statement “b
=
[b
i
]” means that
b is a column vector whose
ith entry is
denoted by
b
i, and “c
=

: In case the type of the vector (row or column) is not clear from context, the
default is a column vector.
Another term that we will use frequently is the following.
NOTATION 1.3.4. The leading entry of a row vector is the ﬁrst nonzero element of that
vector. If all entries are zero, the vector has no leading entry.
The equations of (1.3.1) have several matrices associated with them. First is the full
matrix that describes the system, which we call the augmented matrix of the system. In
our example, this is the

The Elementary Row Operations
There is another matter of notation that we will ﬁnd extremely handy in the sequel. This
is related to the operations that we performed on the preceding example. Now that we
have the matrix notation we could just as well perform these operations on each row of
the augmented matrix, since a row corresponds to an equation in the original system.
There were three types of operations used. We shall catalogue these and give them
names, so that we can document our work in solving a system of equations in a concise
way. Here are the three elementary operations we shall use, described in terms of their
action on rows of a matrix; an entirely equivalent description applies to the equations of
the linear system whose augmented matrix is the matrix below.

E
ij
: This is shorthand for the elementary operation of switching the
ith and
jth rows of the matrix. For instance, in Example 1.3.1 we moved from Equa-
tion 1.3.1 to equation 1.3.2 by using the elementary operation

12
:

E
i
(c)
: This is shorthand for the elementary operation of

row by the nonzero constant
c: For instance, we moved from Equation 1.3.2 to
(1.3.3) by using the elementary operation
E
1
(1=4):

E
ij
(d)
: This is shorthand for the elementary operation of adding
d times the
jth row to the
ith row. (Read the symbols from right to left to get the right
order.) For instance, we moved from Equation 1.3.3 to Equation 1.3.4 by using
the elementary operation
E
21
( 2):
Now let’s put it all together. The whole forward solving phase of Example 1.3.1 could
be described concisely with the notation we have developed:

This is a big improvement over our ﬁrst description of the solution. There is still the job
of back solving, which is the second phase of Gaussian elimination. When doing hand
calculations, we’re right back to writing out a bunch of extra symbols again, which is
exactly what we set out to avoid by using matrix notation.

1.3. GAUSSIAN ELIMINATION: BASIC IDEAS
23
Gauss-Jordan Elimination
Here’s a better way to do the second phase by hand: stick with the augmented matrix.
Starting with the last nonzero row, convert the leading entry (this means the ﬁrst nonzero
entry in the row) to a
1 by an elementary operation, and then use elementary operations
to convert all entries above this
1 entry to
0’s. Now work backwards, row by row, up
to the ﬁrst row. At this point we can read off the solution to the system. Let’s see how
it works with Example 1.3.1. Here are the details using our shorthand for elementary
operations:

All we have to do is remember the function of each column in order to read off the
answer from this last matrix. The underlying system that is represented is

This is, of course, the answer we found earlier:

y

The method of combining forward and back solving into elementary operations on the
augmented matrix has a name: it is called Gauss-Jordan elimination, and is the method
of choice for solving many linear systems. Let’s see how it works on an example from
Section 1.1.

Systems with Non-Unique Solutions
Next, we consider an example that will pose a new kind of difﬁculty, namely, that of
inﬁnitely many solutions. Here is some handy terminology.
NOTATION 1.3.6. An entry of a matrix used to zero out entries above or below it by
Pivots
means of elementary row operations is called a pivot.
The entries that we use in Gaussian or Gauss-Jordan elimination for pivots are always
leading entries in the row which they occupy. For the sake of emphasis, in the next few
examples, we will put a circle around the pivot entries as they occur.
EXAMPLE 1.3.7. Solve for the variables
x,
y and
z in the system
x+
y
+
z
=
2
2x+
2y
+

What do we do next? Neither the second nor the third row correspond to equations that
involve the variable
y
: Switching second and third equations won’t help, either. Here
is the point of view that we adopt in applying Gaussian elimination to this system: the
ﬁrst equation has already been “used up” and is reserved for eventually solving for
x:
We now restrict our attention to the “unused” second and third equations. Perform the
following operations to do Gauss-Jordan elimination on the system.

1.3. GAUSSIAN ELIMINATION: BASIC IDEAS

How do we interpret this result? We take the point of view that the ﬁrst row represents
an equation to be used in solving for
x since the leading entry of the row is in the column
of coefﬁcients of
x: By the same token, the second row represents an equation to be used
in solving for
z, since the leading entry of that row is in the column of coefﬁcients of
z
:
What about
y? Notice that the third equation represented by this matrix is simply
0
=
0,
which carries no information. The point is that there is not enough information in the
system to solve for the variable
y, even though we started with three distinct equations.
Somehow, they contained redundant information. Therefore, we take the point of view
Free and Bound
Variables
that
y is not to be solved for; it is a free variable in the sense that it can take on any
value whatsoever and yield a legitimate solution to the system. On the other hand, the
variables
x and
z are bound in the sense that they will be solved for in terms of constants
and free variables. The equations represented by the last matrix above are
x
+
y
=
0
z
=
2
0
=
0
Use the ﬁrst equation to solve for
x and the second to solve for
z to obtain the general
form of a solution to the system:
x
=
 y
z
=
2
y
is
free
In the preceding example
y can take on any scalar value. For example
x
=
0,
z
=
2,
y
=
0 is a solution to the original system (check this). Likewise,
x
=
 5,
z
=
2,
y
=
5 is a solution to the system. Clearly, we have an inﬁnite number of solutions to the
system, thanks to the appearance of free variables. Up to this point, the linear systems
we have considered had unique solutions, so every variable was solved for, and hence
bound. Another point to note, incidentally, is that the scalar ﬁeld we choose to work on
has an effect on our answer. The default is that
y is allowed to take on any real value
from
R: But if, for some reason, we choose to work with the complex numbers as our
scalars, then
y would be allowed to take on any complex value from
C
: In this case,
another solution to the system would be given by
x
=
 3
 i,
z
=
2,
y
=
3
+
i, for
example.
To summarize, then, once we have completed Gauss-Jordan elimination on an aug-
mented matrix, we can immediately spot the free and bound variables of the system:
the column of a bound variable will have a pivot in it, while the column of a free vari-
able will not. Another example will illustrate the point.
EXAMPLE 1.3.8. Suppose the augmented matrix of a linear system of three equations
involving variables
x;
y
;
z
;
w becomes, after applying suitable elementary row opera-
tions,

1. LINEAR SYSTEMS OF EQUATIONS
SOLUTION. We solve this problem by observing that the ﬁrst and third columns have
pivots in them, which the second and fourth do not. The ﬁfth column represents the
right hand side. Put our little reminder labels in the matrix and we obtain

Hence,
x and

y and

that are represented by this matrix are

 w
=

z

Use the ﬁrst to solve for x and the second to solve for
z to obtain the general solution

We have seen so far that a linear system may have exactly one solution or inﬁnitely
many. Actually, there is only one more possibility which is illustrated by the following
example.
EXAMPLE 1.3.9. Solve the linear system
x
+
y
=
1
2x
+
y
=

3x

We extract the augmented matrix and proceed with Gauss-Jordan elimination. This
time we’ll save a little space by writing more than one elementary operation between
matrices. It is understood that they are done in order, starting with the top one. This is
a very efﬁcient way of doing hand calculations and minimizing the amount of rewriting
of matrices as we go.

Stop everything! We aren’t done with Gauss-Jordan elimination yet since we’ve only
done the forward solving portion. But something strange is going on here. Notice that
the third row of the last matrix above stands for the equation
0x
+
0y
=
2, i.e.,
0
=
2:
This is impossible. What this matrix is telling us is that the original system has no
solution, i.e., it is inconsistent. A system can be identiﬁed as inconsistent as soon as
one encounters a leading entry in the column of constant terms. For this always means
that an equation of the form
0
=nonzero constant has been formed from the system by
legitimate algebraic operations. Thus, one needs proceed no further. The system has no
solutions.
DEFINITION 1.3.10. A system of equations is consistent if it has at least one solution.

Otherwise it is called inconsistent.

1.4. Gaussian Elimination: General Procedure
The preceding section introduced Gaussian elimination and Gauss-Jordan elimination
at a practical level. In this section we will see why these methods work and what they
really mean in matrix terms. Then we will ﬁnd conditions of a very general nature
under which a linear system has (none, one or inﬁnitely many) solutions. A key idea
that comes out of this section is the notion of the rank of a matrix.
Equivalent Systems
The ﬁrst question to be considered is this: how is it that Gaussian elimination or Gauss-
Jordan elimination gives us every solution of the system we begin with and only so-
lutions to that system? To see that linear systems are special, consider the following
nonlinear system of equations.
EXAMPLE 1.4.1. Solve for the real roots of the system
x
+
y
=
2
p
x
=
y

30
1. LINEAR SYSTEMS OF EQUATIONS
SOLUTION. Let’s follow the Gauss-Jordan elimination philosophy of using one equa-
tion to solve for one unknown. So the ﬁrst equation enables us to solve for
y to get
y
=
2
 x: Next substitute this into the second equation to obtain
p
x
=
2
 x: Then
square both sides to obtain
x
=
(2
 x)
2, or
0
=
x
2
 5x
 4
=
(x
 1)(x
 4)
Now
x
=
1 leads to
y
=
1, which is a solution to the system. But
x
=
4 gives
y
=
 2,
which is not a solution to the system since
p
x cannot be negative.
What went wrong in this example is that the squaring step introduced extraneous solu-
tions to the system. Why is Gaussian or Gauss-Jordan elimination safe from this kind of
difﬁculty? The answer lies in examining the kinds of operations we perform with these
methods. First, we need some terminology. Up to this point we have always described
a solution to a linear system in terms of a list of equations. For general problems this is
a bit of a nuisance. Since we are using the matrix/vector notation, we may as well go all
the way and use it to concisely describe solutions as well. We will use column vectors
to deﬁne solutions as follows.
DEFINITION 1.4.2. A solution vector for the general linear system given by Equa-
tion 1.1.1 is a vector
x
=

such that the resulting equations are satisﬁed for these choices of the variables. The
set of all such solutions is called the solution set of the linear system, and two linear
systems are said to be equivalent if they have the same solution sets.
We will want to make frequent reference to vectors without having to display them in the
text. Of course, for row vectors (1

n) this is no problem. To save space in referring to
column vectors, we shall adopt the convention that a column vector will also be denoted
by a tuple with the same entries.

A key question about Gaussian elimination and equivalent systems: what happens to a
system if we change it by performing one elementary row operation? After all, Gauss-
ian and Gauss-Jordan elimination amount to a sequence of elementary row operations
applied to the augmented matrix of a given linear system. The answer: nothing happens
to the solution set!
THEOREM 1.4.5. Suppose a linear system has augmented matrix
A upon which an ele-
mentary row operation is applied to yield a new augmented matrix
B corresponding to
a new linear system. Then these two linear systems are equivalent, i.e., have the same
solution set.
PROOF. If we replace the variables in the system corresponding to A by the values
of a solution, the resulting equations will be satisﬁed. Now perform the elementary
operation in question on this system of equations to obtain that the equations for the
system corresponding to the augmented matrix
B are also satisﬁed. Thus, every solu-
tion to the old system is also a solution to the new system resulting from performing an
elementary operation. It is sufﬁcient for us to show that the old system can be obtained
from the new one by another elementary operation. In other words, we need to show
that the effect of any elementary operation can be undone by another elementary oper-
ation. This will show that every solution to the new system is also a solution to the old
system. If
E represents an elementary operation, then the operation that undoes it could
reasonably be designated as
E
 1
; since the effect of the inverse operation is rather like
cancelling a number by multiplying by its inverse. Let us examine each elementary
operation in turn.

E
ij
: The elementary operation of switching the
ith and
jth rows of the ma-
trix. Notice that the effect of this operation is undone by performing the same
operation,
E
ij, again. This switches the rows back. Symbolically we write
E
 1
ij
=
E
ij
:

E
i
(c)
: The elementary operation of multiplying the
ith row by the nonzero
constant
c: This elementary operation is undone by performing the elementary

operation
E
i
(1=c); in other words, by dividing the
ith row by the nonzero con-
stant
c: We write
E
i
(c)
 1
=
E
i
(1=c):

E
ij
(d)
: The elementary operation of adding
d times the
jth row to the
ith row.
This operation is undone by subtracting
d times the
jth row to the
ith row. We
write
E
ij
(d)
 1
=
E
ij
( d):
Thus, in all cases the effects of an elementary operation can be undone by applying
another elementary operation of the same type, which is what we wanted to show.

1. LINEAR SYSTEMS OF EQUATIONS
The inverse notation we used here doesn’t do much for us yet. In Chapter 2 this notation
will take on an entirely new and richer meaning.
The Reduced Row Echelon Form
Theorem 1.4.5 tells us that the methods of Gaussian or Gauss-Jordan elimination do
not alter the solution set we are interested in ﬁnding. Our next objective is to describe
the end result of these methods in a precise way. That is, we want to give a careful
deﬁnition of the form of the matrix that these methods lead us to, starting with the
augmented matrix of the original system. Recall that the leading entry of a row is the
ﬁrst nonzero entry of that row. (So a row of zeros has no leading entry.)
DEFINITION 1.4.6. A matrix
R is said to be in reduced row form if:
(1) The nonzero rows of
R precede the zero rows.
(2) The column numbers of the leading entries of the nonzero rows, say rows
1;
2;
:::;
r, form an increasing sequence of numbers

The matrix
R said to be in reduced row echelon form if, in addition to the above:
(3) Each leading entry is a
1:
(4) Each leading entry has only zeros above it.
EXAMPLE 1.4.7. Consider the following matrices (whose leading entries are enclosed
in a circle). Which are in reduced row form? reduced row echelon form?

SOLUTION. Checking through (1)-(2), we see that (a), (b) and (d) fulﬁll all the con-
ditions for reduced row matrices. But (c) fails, since a zero row precedes the nonzero
ones; matrix (e) fails to be reduced row form because the column numbers of the lead-
ing entries do not form an increasing sequence. Matrices (a) and (b) don’t satisfy (3),
so matrix (d) is the only one that satisﬁes (3)-(4). Hence, it is the only matrix in the list
in reduced row echelon form.
We can now describe the goal of Gaussian elimination as follows: use elementary row
operations to reduce the augmented matrix of a linear system to reduced row form;
then back solve the resulting system. On the other hand, the goal of Gauss-Jordan
elimination is to use elementary operations to reduce the augmented matrix of a linear
system to reduced row echelon form. From this form one can read off the solution(s) to
the system.
Is it always possible to reduce a matrix to a reduced row form or row echelon form?
If so, how many? These are important questions because, when we take the matrix
in question to be the augmented matrix of a linear system, what we are really asking
becomes: does Gaussian elimination always work on a linear system? If so, do they lead

1.4. GAUSSIAN ELIMINATION: GENERAL PROCEDURE
33
us to answers that have the same form? Notice how the last question was phrased. We
know that the solution set of a linear system is unaffected by elementary row operations.
Therefore, the solution sets we obtain will always be the same with either method, as
sets. But couldn’t the form change? For instance, in Example 1.3.7 we obtained a form
for the general solution that involved one free variable,
y, and two bound variables
x
and
z
: Is it possible that by a different sequence of elementary operations we could have
reduced to a form where there were two free variables and only one bound variable?
This would be a rather different form, even though it might lead to the same solution
set.
Certainly, matrices can be transformed by elementary row operations to different re-
duced row forms, as the following simple example shows:

Every matrix of this example is already in reduced row form. The last matrix is also in
reduced row echelon form. Yet all three of these matrices can be obtained from each
other by elementary row operations. It is signiﬁcant that only one of the three matrices
is in reduced row echelon form. As a matter of fact, any matrix can be reduced by
elementary row operations to one and only one reduced row echelon form, which we can
call the reduced row echelon form of the given matrix. The example above shows that
the matrix
A has as its reduced row echelon form the matrix
E
=

:
Our assertions are justiﬁed by the following fundamental theorem about matrices.
THEOREM 1.4.8. Every matrix can be reduced by a sequence of elementary row oper-
Uniqueness of
Reduced Row
Echelon Form
ations to one and only one reduced row echelon form.
PROOF. First we show that every
m

n matrix
A can be reduced to some reduced
row echelon form. Here is the algorithm we have been using: given that the ﬁrst
s
columns of
A are in reduced row echelon form with
r nonzero rows and that
r
<
m and
s
<
n, ﬁnd the smallest column number
j such that
a
ij
6=
0 and
i
>
r,
j
>
s: If none is
found,
A is in reduced row echelon form. Otherwise, interchange rows
i and
r
+
1, then
use elementary row operations to convert
a
r
+1;j to
1, and to zero out the entries above
and below this one. Now set
s
=
j and increment
r by one. Continue this procedure
until
r
=
m or
s
=
n: This must occur at some point since both
r and
s increase with
each step, and when it occurs, the resulting matrix is in reduced row echelon form.
Next, we prove uniqueness. Suppose that some matrix could be reduced to two distinct
reduced row echelon forms. We show this is impossible. If it were possible, we could
ﬁnd an example
m

n matrix
e
A with the fewest possible columns
n; that is, the theorem
is true for every matrix with fewer columns. Then
n
>
1; since a single column matrix
can be reduced to only one reduced row echelon form, namely either the
0 column or a
column with ﬁrst entry
1 and the other entries
0: Now
e
A can be reduced to two reduced
row echelon forms, say
R
1 and
R
2, with
R
1
6=
R
2
: Write
e
A
=
[A
j
b] so that we can
think of
e
A as the augmented matrix of a linear system (1.1.1). Now for
i
=
1;
2 write
each
R
i as
R
i
=
[L
i
j
b
i
], where
b
i is the last column of the
m

n matrix
R
i, and
L
i
is the
m

(n
 1) matrix formed from the ﬁrst
n
 1 columns of
R
i
: Each
L
i satisﬁes
the deﬁnition of reduced row echelon form, since each
R
i is in reduced row echelon
form. Also, each
L
i results from performing elementary row operations on the matrix

34
1. LINEAR SYSTEMS OF EQUATIONS
A, which has only
n
 1 columns. By the minimum columns hypothesis, we have that
L
1
=
L
2
: There are two possibilities to consider.
Case 1: The last column
b
i of either
R
i has a leading entry in it. Then the system
of equations represented by
e
A is inconsistent. It follows that both columns
b
i have a
leading entry in them, which must be a
1 in the ﬁrst row whose portion in
L
i consists
of zeros, and the entries above and below this leading entry must be
0: Since
L
1
=
L
2,
it follows that
b
1
=
b
2, and thus
R
1
=
R
2, a contradiction. So this case can’t occur.
Case 2: Each
b
i has no leading entry in it. Then the system of equations represented by
e
A is consistent. Both augmented matrices have the same basic and free variables since
L
1
=
L
2
: Hence we obtain the same solution with either augmented matrix by setting
the free variables of the system equal to
0: When we do so, the bound variables are
uniquely determined: the ﬁrst equation says that the ﬁrst bound variable equals the ﬁrst
entry in the right hand side vector, the second says that the second bound variable equals
the second entry in the right hand side vector, and so forth. Whether we use
R
1 or
R
2 to
solve the system, we obtain the same result, since we can manipulate one such solution
into the other by elementary row operations. Therefore,
b
1
=
b
2 and thus
R
1
=
R
2,
a contradiction again. Hence, there can be no counterexample to the theorem, which
completes the proof.
The following consequence of the preceding theorem is a fact that we will ﬁnd helpful
in Chapter 2.
COROLLARY 1.4.9. Let the matrix
B be obtained from the matrix
A by performing a
sequence of elementary row operations on
A: Then
B and
A have the same reduced
row echelon form.
PROOF. We can obtain the reduced row echelon form of
B in the following man-
ner: ﬁrst perform the elementary operations on
B that undo the ones originally per-
formed on
A to get
B
: The matrix
A results from these operations. Now perform
whatever elementary row operations are needed to reduce
A to its reduced row eche-
lon form. Since
B can be reduced to one and only one reduced row echelon form, the
reduced row echelon forms of
A and
B coincide, which is what we wanted to show.
Rank and Nullity of a Matrix
Now that we have Theorem 1.4.8 in hand, we can introduce the notion of rank of a
matrix. Since
A can be reduced to one and only one reduced row echelon form by
Theorem 1.4.8, we see that the following deﬁnition is unambiguous.
DEFINITION 1.4.10. The rank of a matrix
A is the number of nonzero rows of the
reduced row echelon form of
A: This number is written as
rank
A:
Rank can also be deﬁned as the number of nonzero rows in any reduced row form of
a matrix. One has to check that any two reduced row forms have the same number of
nonzero rows. Notice that the rank can also be deﬁned as the number of columns of
the reduced row echelon form with leading entries in them, since each leading entry
of a reduced row echelon form occupies a unique column. We can count up the other
columns as well.

1.4. GAUSSIAN ELIMINATION: GENERAL PROCEDURE
35
DEFINITION 1.4.11. The nullity of a matrix
A is the number of columns of the reduced
row echelon form of
A that do not contain a leading entry. This number is written as
n
ull
A:
In the case that
A is the coefﬁcient matrix of a linear system, we can interpret the rank
of
A as the number of bound variables of the system and the nullity of
A as the number
of free variables of the system.
Observe that the rank of a matrix is a non-negative number. But it could be
0! This
happens when the matrix is a zero matrix, so that it has no nonzero rows. In this case,
the nullity of the matrix is as large as possible. Here are some simple limits on the
size of
rank
A and
n
ull
A: In one limit we shall use a notation that occurs frequently
throughout the text, so we explain it ﬁrst.

n, it must be less than or equal to their minimum, which is what the ﬁrst inequality says.
Also notice that every column of
A either has a pivot in it or not. The number of pivot
columns is just
rank
A and the number of non-pivot columns is
n
ull
A: Hence the sum
of these numbers is
n:
In words, part 1 of Theorem 1.4.13 says that the rank of a matrix cannot exceed the
number of rows or columns of the matrix. One situation occurs often enough enough
that it is entitled to its own name: if the rank of a matrix equals its column number we
say that the matrix has full column rank.
One has to be a little careful about this idea

of rank. Consider the following example.

From the reduced row echelon form of
A at the far right we see that the rank of
A is
2:
Notice that one can’t simply count the number of nonzero rows of
A, which in this case
is
3, to get the rank of
A:
Caution: Remember that the rank of
A is the number of nonzero rows of its reduced
row form, and not the number of nonzero rows of
A itself.
The notion of rank of a matrix gives us some more leverage on the question of how the
solution set of a linear system behaves.
THEOREM 1.4.15. The general linear system 1.1.1 with
m

n coefﬁcient matrix
A,
Consistency in
Terms of Rank
right hand side vector
b and augmented matrix
e
A
=
[A
j
b] is consistent if and only if
rank
A
=
rank
e
A, in which case either
1.
rank
A
=
n, in which case the system has a unique solution, or
2.
rank
A
<
n, in which case the system has inﬁnitely many solutions.
PROOF. We can reduce
e
A to reduced row echelon form by ﬁrst doing the elemen-
tary operations that reduce the
A part of the matrix to reduced row echelon form, then
attending to the last column. Hence, it is always the case that
rank
A

rank
e
A: The
only way to get strict inequality is to have a leading entry in the last column, which
means that some equation in the equivalent system corresponding to the reduced aug-
mented matrix is
0
=
1, which implies that the system is inconsistent. On the other
hand, we have already seen (in the proof of Theorem 1.4.8, for example) that if the last
column does not contain a leading entry, then the system is consistent. This establishes
the ﬁrst statement of the theorem.
Now suppose that
rank
A
=
rank
e
A, so that the system is consistent. By Theorem
1.4.13,
rank
A

n, so that either
rank
A
<
n or
rank
A
=
n: The number of variables
of the system is
n: Also, the number of leading entries (equivalently, pivots) of the
reduced row form of
e
A, which is
rank
A, is equal to the number of bound variables;
the remaining
n
 rank
A variables are the free variables of the system. Thus, to say
that
rank
A
=
n, is to say that no variables are free; that is, solving the system leads to
a unique solution. And to say that
rank
A
<
n is to say that there is at least one free
variable in which case the system has inﬁnitely many solutions.
Here is an example of how this theorem can be put to work. It conﬁrms our intuition
that if a system does not have “enough” equations, then it can’t have a unique solution.
COROLLARY 1.4.16. If a consistent linear system of equations has more unknowns
than equations, then the system has inﬁnitely many solutions.
PROOF. In the notation of the previous theorem, the hypothesis simply means that
m
<
n: But we know from Theorem 1.4.13 that
rank
A

minfm;
ng: Thus
rank
A
<
n and the last part of Theorem 1.4.15 applies to give the desired result.

1.4. GAUSSIAN ELIMINATION: GENERAL PROCEDURE

Of course, there is still the question of when a system is consistent. In general, there
isn’t an easy way to see when this is so. However, in special cases we can answer the
question easily. One such important special case is given by the following deﬁnition.
DEFINITION 1.4.17. The general linear system 1.1.1 with
m

n coefﬁcient matrix
A
Homogeneous
Systems
and right hand side vector
b is said to be homogeneous if the entries of
b are all zero.
Otherwise, the system is said to be non-homogeneous.
The nice feature of homogeneous systems is that they are always consistent! In fact,
it is easy to exhibit a speciﬁc solution to the system, namely, take the value of all the
variables to be zero. For obvious reasons this solution is called the trivial solution to
the system. Thus, the previous corollary implies that a homogeneous linear system with
fewer equations than unknowns must have inﬁnitely many solutions. Of course, if we
want to ﬁnd all the solutions, we will have to do the work of Gauss-Jordan elimination.
However, we acquire a small notational convenience in dealing with homogeneous sys-
tems. Notice that the right hand side of zeros is never changed by an elementary row
operation. So why bother writing out the augmented matrix of such a system? It sufﬁces
to perform elementary operations on the coefﬁcient matrix alone. In the end, the right
hand side is still a column of zeros.

Roundoff Errors
In many practical problems, calculations are not exact. There are several reasons for this
unfortunate fact. For one thing, scientiﬁc calculators are by their very nature only ﬁnite
precision machines. That is, only a ﬁxed number of signiﬁcant digits of the numbers we
are calculating may be used in any given calculation. For instance, verify this simple
arithmetic fact on a calculator or computational software like MATLAB (but exclud-
ing computer algebra systems such as Derive, Maple or Mathematica – since symbolic
calculation is the default on these systems, they will give the correct answer):

1. LINEAR SYSTEMS OF EQUATIONS
In many cases this calculation will not yield
0: The problem is that if, for example, a
calculator uses
6 digit accuracy, then
2=3 is calculated as
0:666667, which is really
incorrect. Even if arithmetic calculations were exact, the data which form the basis of
our calculations are often derived from scientiﬁc measurement which themselves will
almost certainly be in error. Starting with erroneous data and doing an exact calculation
can be as bad as starting with exact data and doing an inexact calculation. In fact, in a
certain sense they are equivalent to each other. Error resulting from truncating data for
storage or ﬁnite precision arithmetic calculations is called roundoff error.
We will not give an elaborate treatment of roundoff error. A thorough analysis can be
found in the Golub and Van Loan text [5] of the bibliography, a text which is considered
a standard reference work. This subject is a part of an entire ﬁeld of applied mathematics
known as numerical analysis. We will consider this question: could roundoff error be a
signiﬁcant problem in Gaussian elimination? It isn’t at all clear that there is a problem.
After all, even in the above example, the ﬁnal error is relatively small. Is it possible that
with all the arithmetic performed in Gaussian elimination the errors pile up and become
large? The answer is “yes.” With the advent of computers came a heightened interest in
these questions. In the early 1950’s numerical analysts intensiﬁed efforts to determine
whether or not Gaussian elimination can reliably solve larger linear systems. In fact,
we don’t really have to look at complicated examples to realize that there is a potential
difﬁculty. Consider the following example.
EXAMPLE 1.5.1. Let
 be a number so small that our calculator yields
1
+

=
1: This
equation appears a bit odd, but from the calculator’s point of view it may be perfectly
correct; if, for example, our calculator performs
6 digit arithmetic, then

=
10
 6will
do nicely. Notice that with such a calculator,
1
+
1=
=
(

Our calculated answer is not even good to one digit. So we see that there can be serious
problems with Gaussian or Gauss-Jordan elimination on ﬁnite precision machines.
It turns out that information that would be signiﬁcant for
x
1 in ﬁrst equation is lost in
the truncated arithmetic that says that
1
+
1=
=
1=: There is a ﬁx for problems such
as this, namely a technique called partial pivoting. The idea is fairly simple: do not
choose the next available column entry for a pivot. Rather, search down the column in
Pivoting
Strategies

1.5. *COMPUTATIONAL NOTES AND PROJECTS

question for the largest entry (in absolute value). Then switch rows, if necessary, and
use this entry as a pivot. For instance, in the preceding example, we would not pivot off
the
 entry of the ﬁrst column. Since the entry of the second row, ﬁrst column, is larger
in absolute value, we would switch rows and then do the usual Gaussian elimination
step. Here is what we would get (remember that with our calculator
1



1):

Now we get the quite acceptable answer

But partial pivoting is not a panacea for numerical problems. In fact, it can be easily
defeated. Multiply the second equation by

2 and we get a system for which partial piv-
oting still picks the wrong pivot. Here the problem is a matter of scale. It can be cured
by dividing each row by the largest entry of the row before beginning the Gaussian
elimination process. This procedure is known as row scaling. The combination of row
scaling and partial pivoting overcomes many of the numerical problems of Gaussian or
Gauss-Jordan elimination (but not all!). There is a more drastic procedure, known as
complete pivoting. In this procedure one searches all the unused rows (excluding the
right hand sides) for the largest entry, then uses it as a pivot for Gaussian elimination.
The columns used in this procedure do not move in that left-to-right fashion we are
used to seeing in system solving. It can be shown rigorously that the error of roundoff
propagates in a predictable and controlled fashion with complete pivoting; in contrast,
we do not really have a satisfactory explanation as to why row scaling and partial piv-
oting work well. Yet in most cases they do reasonably well. Since this combination
involves much less calculation than complete pivoting, it is the method of choice for
many problems.
There are deeper reasons for numerical problems in solving some systems than the one
the preceding example illustrates. One difﬁculty has to do with the “sensitivity” of the
coefﬁcient matrix to small changes. That is, in some systems, small changes in the
coefﬁcient matrix lead to dramatic changes in the exact answer. The practical effect
of roundoff error can be shown to be equivalent to introducing small changes in the
coefﬁcient matrix and obtaining an exact answer to the perturbed (changed) system.
There is no cure for these difﬁculties. A classical example of this type of problem, the
Hilbert matrix, is discussed in one of the projects below. We will attempt to quantify
this “sensitivity” in Chapter 6.
Computational Efﬁciency of Gaussian Elimination
How much work is it to solve a linear system and how does the amount of work grow
with the dimensions of the system? The ﬁrst thing we need is a unit of work. In
computer science one of the principal units of work is a ﬂop (ﬂoating point operation),
namely a single
+;
 ;
; or
: For example, we say the amount of work in computing
e
+
 or
e

 is one ﬂop, while the work in calculating
e
+
3

 is two ﬂops. The
following example is extremely useful.
EXAMPLE 1.5.2. How many ﬂops does it cost to add a multiple of one row to another,
as in Gaussian elimination, given that the rows have
n elements each?

42
1. LINEAR SYSTEMS OF EQUATIONS
SOLUTION. A little experimentation with an example or two shows that that the answer
should be
2n: Here is a justiﬁcation of that count. Say that row
a is to be multiplied by
the scalar
, and added to the row
b: Designate the row
a
=
[a
i
] and the row
b
=
[b
i
]:
We have
n entries to worry about. Consider a typical one, say the
ith one. The
ith entry
of
b, namely
b
i, will be replaced by the quantity
b
i
+
a
i:
The amount of work in this calculation is two ﬂops. Since there are
n entries to compute,
the total work is
2n ﬂops.
Our goal is to determine the expense of solving a system by Gauss-Jordan elimination.
For the sake of simplicity, let’s assume that the system under consideration has
n equa-
tions in
n unknowns and the coefﬁcient matrix has rank
n: This ensures that we will
have a pivot in every row of the matrix. We won’t count row exchanges either, since
they don’t involve any ﬂops. (We should remark that this may not be realistic on a fast
computer, since memory fetches and stores may not take signiﬁcantly less time than a
ﬂoating point operation.) Now consider the expense of clearing out the entries under
the ﬁrst pivot. A picture of the augmented matrix looks something like this, where an
‘’ is an entry which may not be 0 and an ‘
 ’ is a nonzero pivot entry:

Each elementary operation will involve adding a multiple of the ﬁrst row, starting with
the second entry, since we don’t need to do arithmetic in the ﬁrst column – we know
what goes there, to the
n
 1 subsequent rows. By the preceding example, each of
these elementary operations will cost
2n ﬂops. Add
1 ﬂop for the cost of determining
the multiplier to obtain
2n
+
1: So the total cost of zeroing out the ﬁrst column is
(n
 1)(2n
+
1) ﬂops. Now examine the lower unﬁnished block in the above ﬁgure.
Notice that it’s as though we were starting over with the row and column dimensions
reduced by 1. Therefore, the total cost of the next phase is
(n
 2)(2(n
 1)
+
1) ﬂops.
Continue in this fashion and we obtain a count of
0

This is the cost of forward solving. Now let’s simplify our answer a bit more. For large
n we have that
n
3 is much larger than
n or
n
2 (e.g., for
n
=
10 compare
1000 to
10
or
100). Hence, we ignore the lower degree terms and arrive at a simple approxima-
tion to the number of ﬂops required to forward solve a linear system of
n equations in
n unknowns using Gauss-Jordan elimination. There remains the matter of back solv-
ing. We leave as an exercise to show that the total work of back solving is quadratic
in
n: Therefore the “leading order” approximation which we found for forward solving
remains unchanged.

in

Project Topics
In this section we give a few samples of project material. These projects provide an
opportunity for students to explore a subject in a greater depth than exercises permit.
They also provide an opportunity for students to hone their scientiﬁc computing and
writing skills. They are well suited to team effort, and writing expectations can range
from a summary of the answers to a detailed report on the project. The ﬁrst sample
project is written with the expectation of a fairly elaborate project report. The instructor
has to deﬁne her/his own expectations for students. Likewise, the computing platform
used for the projects will vary. We cannot discuss every platform in this text, so we
will give examples of implementation notes that an instructor might supply for a few
of them. The instructor will have to modify that portion of the project to match the
local conﬁguration and provide additional background about the use of the computing
platform.
Notes to students about project/reports: The ﬁrst thing you need to know about report
writing is the intended audience. Usually, you may assume that your report will be read
by your supervisors, who are technical people such as yourself. Therefore, you should
write a brief statement of the problem and discussion of methodology. In practice re-
ports, you assume physical laws and assumptions without further justiﬁcation, but in
real life you would be expected to offer some explanation of physical principles you em-
ploy in constructing your model. Another good point to have in mind is a target length
for your paper. Do not clutter your work with long lists of numbers and try to keep
the length at a minimum rather than maximum. Most kinds of discourse should have
three parts: a beginning, a middle and an end. Roughly, a beginning should consist of
introductory material. In the middle you develop the ideas described or theses proposed
in the introduction, and in the end you summarize your work and tie up loose ends.

44
1. LINEAR SYSTEMS OF EQUATIONS
Of course, rules about paper writing are not set in concrete, and authors vary on exactly
how they organize papers of a given kind. Also, a part could be quite short; for example,
an introduction might only be a paragraph or two. Here is a sample skeleton for a report
(perhaps rather more elaborate than you need): 1. Introduction (title page, summary
and conclusions), 2. Main Sections (problem statement, assumptions, methodology,
results, conclusions), 3. Appendices (such as mathematical analysis, graphs, possible
extensions, etc.) and References.
A few additional notes: Pay attention to appearance and neatness, but don’t be overly
concerned about your writing style. A good rule to remember is “Simpler is better.”
Prefer short and straightforward sentences to convoluted ones. Use a vocabulary that
you are comfortable with. Be sure to use a spell-checker if one is available to you.
A given project/report assignment may be supplied with a report template by your in-
structor or carry explicit instructions about format, intended audience, etc. It is impor-
tant to read and follow these instructions carefully. Naturally, such instructions would
take precedence over any of the preceding remarks.
The ﬁrst two of these projects are based on the material of Section 1.1 in relation to
diffusion processes.
Project: Heat Flow I
Description of the problem: You are working for the ﬁrm Universal Dynamics on a
project which has a number of components. You have been assigned the analysis of a
component which is similar to a laterally insulated rod. The problem you are concerned
with is as follows: part of the specs for the rod dictate that no point of the rod should
stay at temperatures above
60 degrees Celsius for a long period of time. You must
decide if any of the materials listed below are acceptable for making the rod and write a
report on your ﬁndings. You may assume that the rod is of unit length. Suppose further
that internal heat sources come from a position dependent function
f
(x),
0

x

1
and that heat is also generated at each point in amounts proportional to the temperature
at the point. Also suppose that the left and right ends of the rod are held at
0 and
50
degrees Celsius, respectively. When sufﬁcient time passes, the temperature of the rod at
each point will settle down to “steady state” values, dependent only on position
x: These
are the temperatures you are interested in. Refer to the discussion in 1.1 for the details
of the descriptive equations that result from discretizing the problem into ﬁnitely many
nodes. Here
k is the thermal conductivity of the rod, which is a property associated
with the material used to make the rod. For your problem take the source term to be
f
(x)
=
200
cos
(x

): Here are the conductivity constants for the materials with which
your company is considering building the rod. Which of these materials (if any) are
acceptable?

Procedure: For the solution of the problem, formulate a discrete approximation to the
BVP just as in Example 1.1.5. Choose an integer
n and divide the interval [0, 1] into
n
+
1 equal subintervals with endpoints

subinterval is
h
=
1=(n
+
1): Next let
u
i be our approximation to
u(x
i
) and proceed
as in Example 1.1.5 . There results a linear system of
n equations in the
n unknowns

: For this problem divide the rod into
4 equally sized subintervals and take
n
=
3: Use the largest
u
i as an estimate of the highest temperature at any point in
the rod. Now double the number of subintervals and see if your values for
u change
appreciably at a given value of x. If they do, you may want to repeat this procedure
until you obtain numbers that you judge to be satisfactory.
Implementation Notes (for users of Mathematica): Set up the coefﬁcient matrix
a and
right hand side
b for the system. Both the coefﬁcient matrix and the right hand side
can be set up using the Table command of Mathematica. For
b, the command 100*
h^2*Table[Cos[(i h)^ 2,{i,n}]/k will generate
b, except for the last coor-
dinate. Use the command b[[14]] = b[[14]] + 50 to add
u(1) to the right hand
side of the system and get the correct
b: For
a: the command Table[Switch[i-
j,1,-1,0,2,-1,-1,_,0],{i,n},{j,n}]will generate a matrix of the desired
form. (Use the Mathematica on line help for all commands you want to know more
about.) For ﬂoating point numbers: we want to simulate ordinary ﬂoating point calcu-
lations on Mathematica. You will get some symbolic expressions which we don’t want,
e.g., for
b: To turn
b into ﬂoating point approximation, use the command b = N[b].
The N[ ] function turns the symbolic values of b into numbers, with a precision of about
16 digits if no precision is speciﬁed. For solving linear systems use the command u =
LinearSolve[a,b], which will solve the system with coefﬁcient matrix
a and right
hand side
b, and store the result in
u: About vectors: Mathematica does not distinguish
between row vectors or column vectors unless you insist on it. Hardcopy: You can get
hardcopy from Mathematica. Be sure to make a presentable solution for the project.
You should describe the form of the system you solved and at least summarize your
results. This shouldn’t be a tome (don’t simply print out a transcript of your session),
nor should it be a list of numbers.
Project: Heat Flow II
Problem Description: You are given a laterally insulated rod of a homogeneous material
whose conductivity properties are unknown. The rod is laid out on the x-axis, 0 <= x
<= 1. A current is run through the rod, which results in a heat source of 10 units of heat
(per unit length) at each point along the rod. The rod is held at zero temperature at each
end. After a time the temperatures in the rod settle down to a steady state. A single
measurement is taken at x=0.3 which results in a temperature reading of approximately
11 units. Based on this information, determine the best estimate you can for the true
value of the conductivity constant k of the material. Also try to guess a formula for the
shape of the temperature function on the interval [0,1] that results when this value of
the conductivity is used.
Methodology: You should use the model that is presented on pages 4-6 of the text. This
will result in a linear system, which Maple can solve. One way to proceed is simply to
use trial and error until you think you’ve hit on the right value of k, that is, the one that
gives a value of approximately 11 units at x =0.3. Then plot the resulting approximate

function doing a dot-to-dot on the node values. You should give some thought to step
size h.
Output: Return your results in the form of an annotated Maple notebook, which should
have the name of the team members at the top of the ﬁle and an explanation of your
solution in text cells interspersed between input cells, that the user can happily click
his/her way through. This explanation should be intelligible to your fellow students.
Comments: This project introduces you to a very interesting area of mathematics called
"inverse theory." The idea is, rather than proceeding from problem (the governing equa-
tions for temperature values) to solution (temperature values), you are given the "so-
lution", namely the measured solution value at a point, and are to determine from this
information the "problem", that is, the conductivity coefﬁcient that is needed to deﬁne
the governing equations.
Project: The Accuracy of Gaussian Elimination
Description of the problem: This project is concerned with determining the accuracy
of Gaussian elimination as applied to two linear systems, one of which is known to be
difﬁcult to solve numerically. Both of these systems will be square (equal number of
unknowns and equations) and have a unique solution. Also, both of these systems are
to be solved for various sizes, namely
n
=
4;
8;
12;
16: In order to get a handle on the
error, our main interest, we shall start with a known answer. The answer shall consist of
setting all variables equal to
1: So it is the solution vector
(1;

;

matrix shall be one of two types:
(1) A Hilbert matrix, i.e., an

(2) An
n

n matrix with random entries between
0 and
1:
The right hand side vector
b is uniquely determined by the coefﬁcient matrix and solu-
tion. In fact, the entries of
b are easy to obtain: simply add up all the entries in the
ith
row of the coefﬁcient matrix to obtain the
ith entry of
b:
The problem is to measure the error of Gaussian elimination. This is done by ﬁnding
the largest (in absolute value) difference between the computed value of each variable
and actual value, which in all cases is
1: Discuss your results and draw conclusions from
your experiments.
Implementation Notes (for users of Maple): Maple has a built-in procedure for deﬁn-
ing a Hilbert matrix
A of size
n; as in the command A := hilbert(n);. Before
executing this command (and most other linear algebra commands), you must load the
linear algebra package by the command with(linalg);. A vector of 1’s of size
n
can also be constructed by the single command x := vector(n,1);. To multi-
ply this matrix and vector together use the command evalm(A &* x); . There is a
feature that all computer algebra systems have: they do exact arithmetic whenever pos-
sible. Since we are trying to gauge the effects of ﬁnite precision calculations, we don’t
want exact answers (such as 425688/532110), but rather, ﬁnite precision ﬂoating point
answers (such as 0.8). Therefore, it would be a good idea at some point to force the
quantities in question to be ﬁnite precision numbers by encapsulating their deﬁnitions

in an evaluate as ﬂoating point command, e.g., evalf(evalm(A &* x));. This
will force the CAS to do ﬁnite precision arithmetic.

CHAPTER 2
MATRIX ALGEBRA
In Chapter 1 we used matrices and vectors as simple storage devices. In this chapter
matrices and vectors take on a life of their own. We develop the arithmetic of matrices
and vectors. Much of what we do is motivated by a desire to extend the ideas of ordinary
arithmetic to matrices. Our notational style of writing a matrix in the form
A
=
[a
ij
]
hints that a matrix could be treated like a single number. What if we could manipulate
equations with matrix and vector quantities in the same way that we do scalar equa-
tions? We shall see that this is a useful idea. Matrix arithmetic gives us new powers for
formulating and solving practical problems. In this chapter we will use it to ﬁnd effec-
tive methods for solving linear and nonlinear systems, solve problems of graph theory
and analyze an important modeling tool of applied mathematics called a Markov chain.
2.1. Matrix Addition and Scalar Multiplication
To begin our discussion of arithmetic we consider the matter of equality of matrices.
Suppose that
A and
B represent two matrices. When do we declare them to be equal?
The answer is, of course, if they represent the same matrix! Thus we expect that all the
usual laws of equalities will hold (e.g., equals may be substituted for equals) and in fact,
they do. There are times, however, when we need to prove that two symbolic matrices
must be equal. For this purpose, we need something a little more precise. So we have
the following deﬁnition, which includes vectors as a special case of matrices.
DEFINITION 2.1.1. Two matrices
A
=
[a
ij
] and
B
=
[b
ij
] are said to be equal if
these matrices have the same size, and for each index pair
(i;
j
),
a
ij
=
b
ij, that is,
corresponding entries of
A and
B are equal.

SOLUTION. The answer is that only (c) and (d) have any chance of being equal, since
they are the only matrices in the list with the same size (2

entry by entry check veriﬁes that they really are equal.

2. MATRIX ALGEBRA
Matrix Addition and Subtraction
How should we deﬁne addition or subtraction of matrices? We take a clue from ele-
mentary two and three dimensional vectors, such as the type we would encounter in
geometry or calculus. There, in order to add two vectors, one condition had to hold: the
vectors had to be the same size. If they were the same size, we simply added the vectors
coordinate by coordinate to obtain a new vector of the same size. That is precisely what
the following deﬁnition says.
DEFINITION 2.1.3. Let
A
=
[a
ij
] and
B
=
[b
ij
] be
m

n matrices. Then the sum of
the matrices, denoted as
A
+
B, is the
m

n matrix deﬁned by the formula
A
+
B
=
[a
ij
+
b
ij
]
The negative of the matrix
A, denoted as
 A, is deﬁned by the formula
 A
=
[ a
ij
]
Finally, the difference of
A and
B, denoted as
A
 B, is deﬁned by the formula
A
 B
=
[a
ij
 b
ij
]
Notice that matrices must be the same size before we attempt to add them. We say that
two such matrices or vectors are conformable for addition.

2.1. MATRIX ADDITION AND SCALAR MULTIPLICATION

Scalar Multiplication
The next arithmetic concept we want to explore is that of scalar multiplication. Once
again, we take a clue from the elementary vectors, where the idea behind scalar mul-
tiplication is simply to “scale” a vector a certain amount by multiplying each of its
coordinates by that amount. That is what the following deﬁnition says.
DEFINITION 2.1.5. Let
A
=
[a
ij
] be an
m

n matrix and
c a scalar. Then the scalar
product of the scalar
c with the matrix
A, denoted by
cA, is deﬁned by the formula

Recall that the default scalars are real numbers, but they could also be complex numbers.

Linear Combinations
Now that we have a notion of scalar multiplication and addition, we can blend these two
ideas to yield a very fundamental notion in linear algebra, that of a linear combination.

It seems like too much work to write out objects such as the vector
2
4
0
0
0
3
5 that occurred
in the last equation; after all, we know that all the entries are all
0: So we make the
following convention for convenience.
NOTATION 2.1.9. A zero matrix is a matrix whose every entry is
0: We shall denote
such matrices by the symbol
0:
We have to be a bit careful, since this convention makes the symbol
0 ambiguous, but
the meaning of the symbol will be clear from context, and the convenience gained is
worth the potential ambiguity. For example, the equation of the preceding example is
stated very simply as
 2A
1
+
3A
2
 2A
3
=
0, where we understand from context that
0 has to mean the
3

1 column vector of zeros. If we use boldface for vectors, we will
also then use boldface for the vector zero, so some distinction is regained.
EXAMPLE 2.1.10. Suppose that a linear combination of matrices satisﬁes the identity
 2A
1
+
3A
2
 2A
3
=
0, as in the preceding example. Use this fact to express
A
1 in
terms of
A
2 and
A
3
:
SOLUTION. To solve this example, just forget that the quantities
A
1
;
A
2
;
A
3 are any-
thing special and use ordinary algebra. First, add
 3A
2
+
2A
3 to both sides to obtain
 2A
1
+
3A
2
 2A
3
 3A
2
+
2A
3
=
 3A
2
+
2A
3
so that
 2A
1
=
 3A
2
+
2A
3
and then multiplying both sides by the scalar
 1=2 yields the identity
A

The linear combination idea has a really interesting application to linear systems, namely,
it gives us another way to express the solution set of a linear system that clearly identi-
ﬁes the role of free variables. The following example illustrates this point.
EXAMPLE 2.1.11. Suppose that a linear system in the unknowns
x
1
;
x
2
;
x
3
;
x
4 has gen-
eral solution
(x
2
+
3x
4
;
x
2
;
2x
1
 x
4
;
x
4
), where the variables
x
2
;
x
4 are free. Describe
the solution set of this linear system in terms of linear combinations with free variables
as coefﬁcients.

2.1. MATRIX ADDITION AND SCALAR MULTIPLICATION
53
SOLUTION.The trick here is to use only the parts of the general solution involving
x
2
for one vector and the parts involving
x
4 as the other vectors in such a way that these
vectors add up to the general solution. In our case we have

Now simply deﬁne vectors
A
1
=
(1;
1;
2;
0),
A
2
=
(3;
0;
 1;

x
2 and
x
4 are arbitrary, the solution set is
S
=

A
1
+

A

In other words, the solution set to the system is the set of all possible linear combinations
of the vectors
A
1 and
A
2
:
The idea of solution sets as linear combinations is an important one that we will return
to in later chapters. You might notice that once we have the general form of a solution
vector it’s easy to determine the constant vectors
A
1 and
A
2
: Simply set
x
2
=
1 and
the other free variable(s) – in this case just
x
4 – to get the solution vector
A
1, and set
x
4
=
1 and
x
2
=
0 to get the solution vector
A

Laws of Arithmetic
The last example brings up an important point: to what extent can we rely on the ordi-
nary laws of arithmetic and algebra in our calculations with matrices and vectors? We
shall see later in this section that for matrix multiplication there are some surprises. On
the other hand, the laws for addition and scalar multiplication are pretty much what we
would expect them to be. Taken as a whole, these laws are very useful; so much so that
later in this text they will be elevated to the rank of an axiom system for what are termed
“vector spaces.” Here are the laws with their customary names. These same names can
apply to more than one operation. For instance, there is a closure law for addition and
one for scalar multiplication as well.
Laws of Matrix Addition and Scalar Multiplication. Let
A;
B
;
C be matri-
ces of the same size
m

n,
0 the
m

n zero matrix, and
c and
d scalars.
Then
1. (Closure Law)
A
+
B is an
m

n matrix.
2. (Associative Law)
(A
+
B
)
+
C
=
A
+
(B
+

)
3. (Commutative Law)
A

4. (Identity Law)

5. (Inverse Law)
A

( A)

6. (Closure Law)
cA is an
m

n matrix.
7. (Associative Law)
c(dA)
=
(cd)A
8. (Distributive Law)
(c
+
d)A
=
cA
+
dA
9. (Distributive Law)
c(A
+
B
)
=
cA
+
cB
10. (Monoidal Law)
1A
=
A

54
2. MATRIX ALGEBRA
It is fairly straightforward to prove from deﬁnitions that these laws are valid. The veri-
ﬁcations all follow a similar pattern, which we illustrate by verifying the commutative
law for addition: let
A
=
[a
ij
] and
B
=
[b
ij
] be given
m

n matrices. Then we have
that
A
+
B
=
[a
ij
+
b
ij
]
=
[b
ij
+
a
ij
]
=
B
+
A
where the ﬁrst and third equalities come from the deﬁnition of matrix addition, and the
second equality follows from the fact that for all indices
i and
j,
a
ij
+
b
ij
=
b
ij
+
a
ij
by the commutative law for addition of scalars.

2.2. Matrix Multiplication
Matrix multiplication is somewhat more subtle than matrix addition and scalar multi-
plication. Of course, we could deﬁne matrix multiplication to be coordinate-wise, just
as addition is. But our motivation is not merely to make deﬁnitions, but rather to make
useful deﬁnitions.
Deﬁnition of Multiplication
To motivate the deﬁnition, let us consider a single linear equation
2x
 3y
+
4z
=
5:
We will ﬁnd it handy to think of the left hand side of the equation as a “product” of
the coefﬁcient matrix
[2;
 3;
4] and the column matrix of unknowns
2
4
x
y
z
3
5
: Thus, we
have that the product of this row and column is
[2;
 3;
4]
2
4
x
y
z
3
5
=
[2x
 3y
+
4z
]:
Notice that we have made the result of the product into a matrix (in this case
1

1).
This introduces us to a permanent abuse of notation that is almost always used in linear
algebra: we don’t distinguish between the scalar
a and the
1

1 matrix
[a], though
technically perhaps we should. In the same spirit, we make the following deﬁnition.

56
2. MATRIX ALGEBRA
DEFINITION 2.2.1. The product of the
1

n row
[a
1
;
a
2;
:::;
a
n
] with the
n

1 column
2
6
6
6
4
b
1
b

...
b
n

5 is deﬁned to be the


1 matrix
[a
1
b
1
+
a
2
b
2
+
:::
+
a
n
b
n
]:
It is this row-column product strategy that guides us to the general deﬁnition. Notice
how the column number of the ﬁrst matrix had to match the row number of the second,
and that this number disappears in the size of the resulting product. This is exactly what
happens in general.
DEFINITION 2.2.2. Let
A
=
[a
ij
] be an
m

p matrix and
B
=
[b
ij
] be a
p

n matrix.
Then the product of the matrices
A and
B, denoted by
A

B (or simply
AB), is the
m

n matrix whose
(i;
j
)th entry, for
1

i

m and
1

j

n, is the entry of the
product of the
ith row of
A and the
jth column of
B; more speciﬁcally, the
(i;
j
)th entry
of
AB is
a
i1
b
1j
+
a
i2
b
2j
+
:::
+
a
ip
b
pj
Notice that, unlike addition, two matrices may be of different sizes when we can multi-
ply them together. If
A is
m

p and
B is
p

n, we say that
A and
B are conformable
for multiplication. It is also worth noticing that if
A and
B are square and of the same
size, then the products
AB and
B
A are always deﬁned.
Some Illustrative Examples

Something very interesting comes out of this calculation. Notice that for this choice of

Multiplication
Not
Commutative or
Cancellative
A and
B we have that
AB and
B
A are not the same matrices - never mind that their
entries are all
0’s - the important point is that these matrices are not even the same size!
Thus a very familiar law of arithmetic, the commutativity of multiplication, has just
fallen by the wayside.

There’s something very curious here, too. Notice that two nonzero matrices of the same

The calculation in (c) inspires some more notation. The left-hand matrix of this product
has a very important property. It acts like a “1” for matrix multiplication. So it deserves
its own name.

Linear Systems as a Matrix Product
Let’s have another look at a system we examined in Chapter 1. We’ll change the names
of the variables from
x;
y
;
z to
x
1
;
x
2
;
x

with any number of variables.

SOLUTION. Recall how we deﬁned multiplication of a row vector and column vector at
the beginning of this section. We use that as our inspiration. Deﬁne
x

Of course,
A is just the coefﬁcient matrix of the system and
b is the right hand side vec-
tor, which we have seen several times before. But now these take on a new signiﬁcance.
Notice that if we take the ﬁrst row of
A and multiply it by
x we get the left hand side of
the ﬁrst equation of our system. Likewise for the second and third rows. Therefore, we
may write in the language of matrices that
Ax

Thus the system is represented very succinctly as

2.2. MATRIX MULTIPLICATION

Once we understand this example, it is easy to see that the general abstract system that
we examined in the ﬁrst section of Chapter 1 can just as easily be abbreviated. Now we
have a new way of looking at a system of equations: it is just like a simple ﬁrst degree
equation in one variable. Of course, the catch is that the symbols
A;
x;
b now represent
an
m

n matrix,
n

1 and
m

1 vectors, respectively. In spite of this the matrix
multiplication idea is very appealing. For instance, it might inspire us to ask if we could
somehow solve the system
Ax
=
b by multiplying both sides of the equation by some
kind of matrix “1=
A” so as to cancel the
A and get
(1=
A)Ax
=
I
x
=
x
=
(1=
A)b
We’ll follow up on this idea in Section 2.5.
Here is another perspective on matrix-vector multiplication that gives a very powerful
way of thinking about such multiplications. We will use this idea frequently in Chap-
ter 3.
EXAMPLE 2.2.6. Interpret the matrix product of Example 2.2.5 as a linear combination
of column vectors.
SOLUTION. Examine the system of this example and we see that the column
(1;
2;
4)
appears to be multiplied by
x
1
: Similarly, the column
(1;
2;
6) is multiplied by
x
2 and
the column
(1;
5;
8) by
x
3
: Hence, if we use the same right hand side column
(4;
11;
24)
as before, we obtain that this column can be expressed as a linear combination of column
vectors, namely
x

We could write the equation of the previous example very succinctly as follows: let
A
have columns

;
a

;
a
3
; so that
A
=
[a

Laws of Arithmetic
We have already seen that the laws of matrix arithmetic may not be quite the same as the
ordinary arithmetic laws that we are use to. Nonetheless, as long as we don’t assume a
cancellation law or a commutative law for multiplication, things are pretty much what
one might expect.

2. MATRIX ALGEBRA
Laws of Matrix Multiplication. Let
A;
B
;
C be matrices of the appropriate
sizes so that the following multiplications make sense,
I a suitably sized iden-
tity matrix, and
c and
d scalars. Then
1. (Closure Law)
AB is an
m

n matrix.
2. (Associative Law)
(AB
)C
=
A(B
C
)
3. (Identity Law)

4. (Associative Law for Scalars)

(A

B
)C
=
AC
+
B
C
6. (Distributive Law)
A(B

AC
One can formally verify these laws by working through the deﬁnitions. For example,
to verify the ﬁrst half of the identity law, let
A
=
[a
ij
] be an
m

n matrix, so that
I
=
[Æ
ij
] has to be
I
n in order for the product
AI to make sense. Now we see from the
formal deﬁnition of matrix multiplication that
AI
=
[
n
X
k

a

Æ

=
[a

The middle equality follows from the fact that
Æ
k
j is
0 unless
k
=
j: Thus the sum
collapses to a single term. A similar calculation veriﬁes the other laws.
We end our discussion of matrix multiplication with a familiar looking notation that will
prove to be extremely handy in the sequel.
NOTATION 2.2.7. Let
A be a square
n

n matrix and
k a nonnegative integer. Then
we deﬁne the

As a simple consequence of this deﬁnition we have the standard exponent laws.

2.3. Applications of Matrix Arithmetic
We have already seen an important application of matrix multiplication to linear sys-
tems. We next examine a few more applications of the matrix multiplication idea which
should reinforce the importance of this idea, as well as provide us with some interpre-
tations of matrix multiplication.
Matrix Multiplication as Function Composition
The function idea is basic to mathematics. Recall that a function
f is a rule of corre-
spondence that assigns to each argument
x in a set called its domain, a unique value
y
=
f
(x) from a set called its range. Each branch of mathematics has its own spe-
cial functions; for example, in calculus differentiable functions
f
(x) are fundamental.
Linear algebra also has its special functions. Suppose that
T
(u) represents a function
whose arguments
u and values
v
=
T
(u) are vectors. We say the function
T is linear
if, for all vectors
u;
v in the domain of
T
; and scalars
c;
d; we have
Linear
Functions
T
(cu
+
dv
)
=
cT
(u)
+
dT
(v
)
EXAMPLE 2.3.1. Show that the function
T with domain the set of
2

1 vectors and
deﬁnition by the formula
T

x
y

=
x
is a linear function.

2.3. APPLICATIONS OF MATRIX ARITHMETIC
63
SOLUTION. Let

x
y

and

z
w

be two elements in the domain of
T and
c;
d any
two scalars. Now compute
T

c

x
y

+
d

z
w


=
cx
+
dz
=
cT

x
y

+
dT

z
w

Thus,
T satisﬁes the deﬁnition of linear function.
One can check that the function
T just deﬁned can be expressed as a matrix multiplica-
tion, namely,
T

x
y

=
[1;
0]

x
y

: This kind of linear function gives yet another
reason for deﬁning matrix multiplication in the way that we do. More generally, let
A
be an
m

n matrix and deﬁne a function
T
A that maps
n

1 vectors to
m

1 vectors
according to the formula
T
A
(u)
=
Au:
First we verify that
T is linear. Use the deﬁnition of
T
A along with the distributive law
of multiplication and associative law for scalars to obtain that
T
A
(cu
+
dv
)
=
A(cu
+
dv
)
=
A(cu)
+
dA(v
)
=
c(Au)
+
d(Av
)
=
cT
A
(u)
+
dT
A
(v
)
This proves that multiplication of vectors by a ﬁxed matrix
A is a linear function.
EXAMPLE 2.3.2. Use the associative law of matrix multiplication to show that the com-
position of matrix multiplication functions corresponds to the matrix product.
SOLUTION. For all vectors
u and for suitably sized matrices
A;
B
; we have by the
associative law that
A(B
u)
=
(AB
)u: In function terms, this means that
T
A
(T
B
(u))
=
T
AB
(u): Since this is true for all arguments
u; it follows that
T
A
Æ
T
B
=
T
AB
; which
is what we were to show.
We will have more to say about linear functions in Chapters 3 and 6, where they will
go by the name of linear operators. For now we’ll conclude our discussion of linear
functions with an example that gives a hint of why the “linear” in “linear function.”
EXAMPLE 2.3.3. Let
L be the set of points
(x;
y
) in the plane that satisfy the linear
equation
y

A

Describe and sketch these sets in the plane.
SOLUTION. Of course the set L is just the straight line deﬁned by the linear equation

L in

t is any real number, since

Markov Chains as Matrix Products
A Markov chain is a certain type of matrix model which we will illustrate with an
example.
EXAMPLE 2.3.4. Suppose two toothpaste companies compete for customers in a ﬁxed
market in which each customer uses either Brand A or Brand B. Suppose also that a
market analysis shows that the buying habits of the customers ﬁt the following pattern
in the quarters that were analyzed: each quarter (three month period) 30% of A users
will switch to B while the rest stay with A. Moreover, 40% of B users will switch to A
in a given quarter, while the remaining B users will stay with B. If we assume that this
pattern does not vary from quarter to quarter, we have an example of what is called a
Markov chain model. Express the data of this model in matrix-vector language.
SOLUTION. Notice that if
a
0 and
b
0 are the fractions of the customers using A and B,
respectively, in a given quarter,
a
1 and
b
1 the fractions of customers using A and B in
the next quarter, then our hypotheses say that
a

=
0:7a
0
+
0:4b
0
b
1
=
0:3a
0
+
0:6b

We could ﬁgure out what happens in the quarter after this by replacing the indices
1 and
0 by
2 and
1, respectively, in the preceding formula. In general, we replace the indices

: Then the system may be expressed in the matrix form

=
Ax
(k

The state vectors
x
(k
) of the preceding example have the following property: each
coordinate is non-negative and all the coordinates sum to
1: Such a vector is called a
probability distribution vector. Also, the matrix
A has the property that each of its
columns is a probability distribution vector. Such a square matrix is called a transition
matrix. In these terms we now give a precise deﬁnition of a Markov chain.

Now we really have a very good handle on the Markov chain problem. Consider the
following instance of our example.
EXAMPLE 2.3.6. In the notation of Example 2.3.4 suppose that initially Brand A has
all the customers (i.e., Brand B is just entering the market). What are the market shares
2 quarters later? 20 quarters? Answer the same questions if initially Brand B has all the
customers.
SOLUTION. To say that initially Brand A has all the customers is to say that the initial
state vector is

Thus, Brand A will have
61% of the market and Brand B will have
39% of the market
in the second quarter. We did not try to do the next calculation by hand, but rather used
a computer to get the approximate answer:
x

Thus, after
20 quarters, Brand A’s share will have fallen to about
57% of the market
and Brand B’s share will have risen to about
43%: Now consider what happens if the
initial scenario is completely different, i.e.,
x

Surprise! We get the same answer as we did with a completely different initial condition.
Is this just a coincidence? We will return to this example again in Chapter 3, where
concepts introduced therein will cast new light on this model.
Calculating Power of Graph Vertices
EXAMPLE 2.3.7. (Dominance Directed Graphs) Suppose you have incomplete data
about four teams who have played each other, and further that the matches only have a
winner and a loser, with no score attached. Given that the teams are identiﬁed by labels
1;
2;
3; and
4 we could describe a match by a pair of numbers
(i;
j
) where we understand
that this means that team
i played and defeated team
j (no ties allowed). Here is the
given data:
f(1;
2);
(1;
4);
(3;
1);
(2;
3);
(4;
2)g
Give a reasonable graphical representation of this data.
SOLUTION. We can draw a picture of all the data that we are given by representing
each team, as a point called a “vertex” and each match by connecting two points with
an arrow, called a “directed edge”, which points from the winner towards the loser in
the match. See Figure 2.3.2 for the picture that we obtain.
Consider the following question relating to Example 2.3.7. Given this incomplete data
about the teams, how would we determine the ranking of each team in some reasonable
way? In order to answer this question, we are going to introduce some concepts from
graph theory which are useful modeling tools for many problems.
The data of Figure 2.3.2 is an example of a directed graph, a modeling tool which can
be deﬁned as follows.
A directed graph (digraph for short) is a set
V , whose elements
Directed Graph
are called vertices, together with a set or list (to allow for repeated edges)
E of ordered

Vertex 3
Vertex 2

Edge 1
FIGURE 2.3.2. Data from Example 2.3.7
pairs with coordinates in
V , whose elements are called (directed) edges. Another useful
idea for us is the following: a walk in the digraph
G is a sequence of digraph edges
(v
0
;
v
1
);
(v
1
;
v
2
);
:::;
(v
m 1
;
v
m
) which goes from vertex
v
0 to vertex
v
m
: The length of
the walk is
m:
Here is an interpretation of “power” that has proved to be useful in many situations,
including our own. The power of a vertex in a digraph is the number of walks of length
1 or
2 originating at the vertex. In our example, for instance, the power of vertex
1
is
4: Why only walks of length
1 or
2? For one thing, walks of length
3 introduce
the possibility of loops, i.e., walks that “loop around” to the same point. It isn’t very
informative to ﬁnd out that team
1 beat team
2 beat team
3 beat team
1: For another,
information more than two hops away isn’t very deﬁnitive. So we don’t count it in the
deﬁnition of power.
The type of digraph we are considering has no edges from a vertex to itself (so-called
“self-loops”) and for a pair of distinct vertices at most one edge connecting the two
vertices. In other words, a team doesn’t play itself and plays another team at most once.
Such a digraph is called a dominance-directed graph. Although the notion of power
of a point is deﬁned for any digraph, it makes the most sense for dominance-directed
graphs.
EXAMPLE 2.3.8. Find the power of each vertex in the graph of Example 2.3.7 and use
this information to rank the teams.
SOLUTION. In this example we could ﬁnd the power of all points by inspection of
Figure 2.3.2. Let’s do it: simple counting gives that the power of vertex
1 is
4, the
power of vertex
3 is
3, and the power of vertices
2 and
4 is
2: Consequently, teams
2
and
4 are tied for last place, team
3 is in second place and team
1 is ﬁrst.
One can imagine situations (like describing the structure of the communications net-
work pictured in Figure 2.3.3) where the edges shouldn’t really have a direction, since
connections are bidirectional. For such situations a more natural tool is the concept of
a graph, which can be deﬁned as follows: a graph is a set
V , whose elements are called
vertices, together with a set or list (to allow for repeated edges)
E of unordered pairs
with coordinates in
V , called edges.

etc, as in the ﬁgure. Also, the sequence
e
1
;
e
4
;
e
7 is a walk from vertex
v
1 to
v
5 of length
2: Just as with digraphs, we can deﬁne the power of a vertex in any graph as the number
of walks of length at most
2 originating at the vertex.
A very sensible question to ask about these examples: how could we write a computer
program to compute powers? More generally, how can we compute the total number of
walks of a certain length? Here is a key to the answer: all the information about our
graph (or digraph) can be stored in its adjacency matrix. In general, this is deﬁned to
be a square matrix whose rows and columns are indexed by the vertices of the graph
and whose
(i;
j
)th entry is the number of edges going from vertex
i to vertex
j (it is
0
if there are none). Here we understand that a directed edge of a digraph must start at
i
and end at
j, while no such restriction applies to the edges of a graph.
Just for the record, if we designate the adjacency matrix of the digraph of Figure 2.3.2
by
A and the adjacency matrix of the graph of Figure 2.3.3 by
B
; then

Notice that we could reconstruct the entire digraph or graph from this matrix. Also
notice that in the adjacency matrix for a graph, an edge gets accounted for twice, since
it can be thought of as proceeding from one vertex to the other, or from the other to the
one.
For a general graph with
n vertices and adjacency matrix
A
=
[a
ij
], we can use this
matrix to compute powers of vertices without seeing a picture of the graph. To count
up the walks of length
1 emanating from vertex
i: simply add up the elements of the
ith

2.3. APPLICATIONS OF MATRIX ARITHMETIC

row of
A: Now what about the paths of length
2? Observe that there is an edge from
i to
k and then from
k to
j precisely when the product
a
ik
a
k
j is equal to
1: Otherwise, one
of the factors will be
0 and therefore the product is
0: So the number of paths of length
2 from vertex
i to vertex
j is the familiar sum

This is just the

2
: A similar argument shows the following
fact:
THEOREM 2.3.9. If
A is the adjacency matrix of the graph
G, then the
(i;
j
)th entry of
A
r gives the number of walks of length
r starting at vertex
i and ending at vertex
j:
Since the power of vertex
i is the number of all paths of length
1 or
2 emanating from
vertex
i, we have the following key fact:
THEOREM 2.3.10. If
A is the adjacency matrix of the digraph
G, then the power of the
ith vertex is the sum of all entries in the

A

An easy way to sum each row is to multiply
A
+
A
2 on the right by a column of
1’s,
but in this case we see immediately that the power of vertex
1 is
4, the power of vertex
3 is
3, and the power of vertices
2 and
4 is2; which is consistent with what we observed
earlier by inspection of the graph.
Difference Equations
The idea of a difference equation has numerous applications in mathematics and com-
puter science. In the latter ﬁeld, these equations often go by the name of “recurrence
relations.” They can be used for a variety of applications ranging from population mod-
eling to analysis of complexity of algorithms. We will introduce them by way of a
simple ﬁnancial model.
EXAMPLE 2.3.12. Suppose that you invest in a contractual fund that has the stipulation
that you must invest in the funds for three years before you can receive any return on
your investment (with a positive ﬁrst year investment). Thereafter, you are vested in
the fund and may remove your money at any time. While you are vested in the fund,
annual returns are calculated as follows: money that was in the fund one year ago earns
nothing, while money that was in the fund two years ago earns
6% of its value and
money that was in the fund three years ago earns
12% of its value. Find an equations
that describes your investment’s growth.

SOLUTION. Let
a
k be the amount of your investment in the
kth year. The numbers
a
0
;
a
1
;
a
2 represent your investments for the ﬁrst three years (we’re counting from
0.)
Consider the
3rd year amount
a

: According to your contract, your total funds in the
3rd year will be
a

a

+
0:12a

Now it’s easy to write out a general formula for
a
k

terms, using the same line of thought, namely
a

In general, a homogeneous linear difference equation (or recurrence relation) of order

There are many ways to solve difference equations; we are not going to give a complete
solution to this problem at this point – we postpone this issue to Chapter 5, where we
introduce eigenvalues and eigenvectors. However, we can now show how to turn a
difference equation as given above into a matrix equation. We’ll illustrate the key idea
with our fund example. The secret is to identify the right vector variables. To this end,
deﬁne an indexed vector

2.4. Special Matrices and Transposes
There are certain types of matrices that are so important that they have acquired names
of their own. We are going to introduce some of these in this section, as well as one
more matrix operation which has proved to be a very practical tool in matrix analysis,
namely the operation of transposing a matrix.
Elementary Matrices and Gaussian Elimination
We are going to show a new way to execute the elementary row operations used in
Gaussian elimination. Recall the shorthand we used:

E
ij
: The elementary operation of switching the
ith and
jth rows of the matrix.

E

(c)
: The elementary operation of multiplying the
ith row by the nonzero

matrix will depend on the context of our discussion, so the notation is ambiguous, but it
is still very useful.

What good are these matrices? One can see that the following fact is true:
THEOREM 2.4.3. Let
C
=
B
A be a product of two matrices and perform an elemen-
tary row operation on
C
: Then the same result is obtained if one performs the same
elementary operation on the matrix
B and multiplies the result by
A on the right.
We won’t give a formal proof of this statement, but it isn’t hard to see why it is true. For
example, suppose one interchanges two rows, say the
ith and
jth, of
C
=
B
A to obtain
a new matrix
D
: How do we get the
ith or
jth row of
C? Answer: multiply the corre-
sponding row of
B by the matrix
A: Therefore, we would obtain
D by interchanging

74
2. MATRIX ALGEBRA
the
ith and
jth rows of
B and multiplying the result by the matrix
A, which is exactly
what the Theorem says. Similar arguments apply to the other elementary operations.
Now take
B
=
I, and we see from the deﬁnition of elementary matrix and Theo-
rem 2.4.3 that the following is true.
COROLLARY 2.4.4. If an elementary row operation is performed on a matrix
A to
Elementary
Operations as
Matrix
Multiplication
obtain a matrix
A
0, then
A
0
=
E
A; where
E is the elementary matrix corresponding to
the elementary row operation performed.
The meaning of this corollary is that we accomplish an elementary row operation by
multiplying by the corresponding elementary matrix on the left. Of course, we don’t
need elementary matrices to accomplish row operations; but they give us another per-
spective on row operations.

Some Matrices with Simple Structure
Certain types of matrices have already turned up frequently in our discussions. For
example, the identity matrices are particularly easy to deal with. Another example is
the reduced row echelon form. So let us classify some simple matrices and attach names
to them. The simplest conceivable matrices are zero matrices. We have already seen
that they are important in matrix addition arithmetic. What’s next? For square matrices,
we have the following deﬁnitions, in ascending order of complexity.
DEFINITION 2.4.6. Let
A
=
[a
ij
] be a square
n

n matrix. Then
A is
 Scalar if
a
ij
=
0 and
a
ii
=
a
j
j for all
i
6=
j: (Equivalently:
A
=
cI
n for some
scalar
c, which explains the term “scalar.”)

2.4. SPECIAL MATRICES AND TRANSPOSES

 Diagonal if
a
ij
=
0 for all
i
6=
j: (Equivalently: the off-diagonal entries of
A
are
0:)
 (Upper) triangular if
a
ij
=
0 for all
i
>
j: (Equivalently: the sub-diagonal
entries of
A are
0:)
 (Lower) triangular if
a
ij
=
0 for all
i
<
j: (Equivalently: the super-diagonal
entries of
A are
0:)
 Triangular if the matrix is upper or lower triangular.
 Strictly triangular if it is triangular and the diagonal entries are also zero.
SOLUTION. The index conditions that we use above have
simple interpretations. For example, the entry
a
ij with
i
>
j is located further down than over, since the row number
is larger than the column number. Hence, it resides in the
“lower triangle” of the matrix. Similarly, the entry
a
ij with
i
<
j resides in the “upper triangle.” Entries
a
ij with
i
=
j reside along the main diagonal of the matrix. See
the adjacent ﬁgure for a picture of these triangular regions
of the matrix.
i = j
i < j
i > j

SOLUTION. Notice that (a) is not scalar, since diagonal entries differ from each other,
but it is a diagonal matrix, since the off-diagonal entries are all
0: On the other hand,
the matrix of (b) is really just
2I
3, so this matrix is a scalar matrix. Matrix (c) has all
terms below the main diagonal equal to
0, so this matrix is triangular and, speciﬁcally,
upper triangular. Similarly, matrix (d) is lower triangular. Matrix (e) is clearly upper
triangular, but it is also strictly upper triangular since the diagonal terms themselves are
0: Finally, we have

so that

Here is another kind of structured matrix that occurs frequently enough in applications
to warrant a name. In Example 1.1.5 of Chapter 1 we saw that an approximation to a

If we want more accurate solutions to the original problem, we would need to solve sys-
tems with coefﬁcient matrix
A
n, where
n is larger than
5: Notice that the only nonzero
entries of such a matrix are those along the main diagonal, the entries along the ﬁrst
subdiagonal and ﬁrst superdiagonal. Such a matrix is called a tridiagonal matrix. For-
mally speaking, these are the square matrices
A
=
[a
ij
] such that
a
ij
=
0 if
i

j

or

Block matrices
Another type of matrix that occurs frequently enough to be discussed is a block matrix.
Actually, we already used the idea of blocks when we describe the augmented matrix
of the system
Ax
=
b as the matrix
~
A
=
[A
j
b]: We say that
~
A has the block, or parti-
tioned, form
[A;
b]: What we are really doing is partitioning the matrix
~
A by inserting
a vertical line between elements. There is no reason we couldn’t partition by inserting
more vertical lines or horizontal lines as well, and this partitioning leads to the blocks.
The main point to bear in mind when using the block notation is that the blocks must be
correctly sized so that the resulting matrix makes sense. The main virtue of the block
form that results from partitioning is that for purposes of matrix addition or multiplica-
tion, we can treat the blocks rather like scalars, provided the addition or multiplication
that results makes sense. We will use this idea from time to time without fanfare. One
could go through a formal description of partitioning and proofs; we won’t. Rather,
we’ll show how this idea can be used by example.
EXAMPLE 2.4.8. Use block multiplication to simplify the following multiplication
SOLUTION. Here is the blocking that we want to use. It makes the column numbers of
the blocks on the left match the row numbers of the blocks on the right:

Transpose of a Matrix
Sometimes we would prefer to work with a different form of a given matrix that contains
the same information. Transposes are operations that allow us to do that. The idea of
transposing is simple: interchange rows and columns. It turns out that for complex
matrices, there is an analogue which is not quite the same thing as transposing, though
it yields the same result when applied to real matrices. This analogue is called the
Hermitian transpose. Here are the appropriate deﬁnitions.
DEFINITION 2.4.9. Let
A
=
[a
ij
] be an
m

n matrix with (possibly) complex entries.
Then the transpose of
A is the
n

m matrix
A
T obtained by interchanging the rows and
columns of
A; so that the
(i;
j
)th entry of
A
T is
a
j
i
: The conjugate of
A is the matrix
A
=
[a
ij
]: Finally, the Hermitian transpose of
A is the matrix
A
H
=
A
T
:
Notice that in the case of a real matrix (that is, a matrix with real entries)
A there is
no difference between transpose and Hermitian transpose, since in this case
A
=
A:
Consider these examples.

In this case, transpose and Hermitian transpose are not the same.
Even when dealing with vectors alone, the transpose notation is rather handy. For ex-
ample, there is a bit of terminology that comes from tensor analysis (a branch of higher
linear algebra used in many ﬁelds including differential geometry, engineering mechan-
ics and relativity) that can be expressed very concisely with transposes:

The other laws are proved similarly.
We will require explicit formulas for transposes of the elementary matrices in some later
calculations. Notice that the matrix
E
ij
(c) is a matrix with
1’s on the diagonal and
0’s
elsewhere, except that the
(i;
j
)th entry is
c: Therefore, transposing switches the entry
c
to the
(j;
i)th position and leaves all other entries unchanged. Hence
E

T
=
E

These formulas have an interesting application. Up to this point we have only con-
sidered elementary row operations. However, there are situations in which elementary
column operations on the columns of a matrix are useful. If we want to use such opera-
Elementary
Column
Operations and
Matrices
tions, do we have to start over, reinvent elementary column matrices, and so forth? The
answer is no and the following example gives an indication of why the transpose idea
is useful. This example shows how to do column operations in the language of matrix
arithmetic. In a nutshell, here’s the basic idea: suppose we want to do an elementary
column operation on a matrix
A corresponding to elementary row operation
E to get a
new matrix
B from
A. To do this, turn the columns of
A into rows, do the row operation
and then transpose the result back to get the matrix
B that we want. In algebraic terms:
B
=
(E
A
T
)
T
=
(A
T
)
T
E
T
=
AE
T
So all we have to do to perform an elementary column operation is multiply by the
transpose of the corresponding elementary row matrix on the right. Thus we see that the
transposes of elementary row matrices could reasonably be called elementary column
matrices.
EXAMPLE 2.4.13. Let
A be a given matrix. Suppose that we wish to express the result
B of swapping the second and third columns of
A, followed by adding
 2 times the
ﬁrst column to the second, as a product of matrices. How can this be done? Illustrate

2. MATRIX ALGEBRA
A very important type of special matrix is one which is invariant under the operation of
transposing. These matrices turn up naturally in applied mathematics. They have some
very remarkable properties that we will study in Chapters 4, 5 and 6.
DEFINITION 2.4.14. The matrix
A is said to be symmetric if
A
T
=
A and Hermitian
if
A
H
=
A: (Equivalently,
a
ij
=
a
j
i and
a
ij
=
a
j
i, for all
i;
j, respectively.)
From the laws of transposing elementary matrices above we see right away that
E
ij and
E
i
(c) supply us with examples of symmetric matrices. Here are a few more.

Hence this matrix is Hermitian. However, it is not symmetric since the
(1;
2)th and
(2;
1)th entries differ. Matrix (b) is easily seen to be symmetric by inspection. Matrix
(c) is symmetric since the
(1;
2)th and
(2;
1)th entries agree, but it is not Hermitian since

2.4. SPECIAL MATRICES AND TRANSPOSES
81
Rank of the Matrix Transpose
An important question to ask is how the rank of a matrix transpose (or Hermitian trans-
pose) is connected to the rank of matrix. We focus on transposes. First we need the
following
THEOREM 2.4.17. Let
A;
B be matrices such that the product
AB is deﬁned. Then
rank
AB

rank
A
PROOF. Let
E be a product of elementary matrices such that
E
A
=
R, where
R
is the reduced row echelon form of
A: If
rank
A
=
r, then the ﬁrst
r rows of
A have
leading entries of
1, while the remaining rows are zero rows. Also, we saw in Chapter
1 that elementary row operations do not change the rank of a matrix since, according to
Corollary 1.4.9 they do not change the reduced row echelon form of a matrix. Therefore,
rank
AB
=
rank
E
(AB
)
=
rank
(E
A)B
=
rank
R
B
Now the matrix
R
B has the same number of rows as
R and the ﬁrst
r of these rows
may or may not be nonzero, but the remaining rows must be zero rows, since they result
from multiplying columns of
B by the zero rows of
R
: If we perform elementary row
operations to reduce
R
B to its reduced row echelon form we will possibly introduce
more zero rows than
R has. Consequently,
rank
R
B

r
=
rank
A, which completes
the proof.
THEOREM 2.4.18. For any matrix
A,
rank
A
=
rank
A
T
PROOF. As in the previous theorem, let
E be a product of elementary matrices such
that
E
A
=
R, where
R is the reduced row echelon form of
A: If
rank
A
=
r, then the
ﬁrst
r rows of
R have leading entries of
1 whose column numbers form an increasing
sequence, while the remaining rows are zero rows. Therefore,
R
T
=
A
T
E
T is a matrix
whose columns have leading entries of
1 and whose row numbers form an increasing
sequence. Use elementary row operations to clear out the nonzero entries below each
column with a leading
1 to obtain a matrix whose rank is equal to the number of such
leading entries, i.e., equal to
r
: Thus,
rank
R
T
=
r
:
From Theorem 2.4.17 we have that
rank
A
T
E
T

rank
A
T
: It follows that
rank
A
=
rank
R
T
=
rank
A
T
E
T

rank
A
T
If we substitute the matrix
A
T for the matrix
A in this inequality, we obtain that
rank
A
T

rank
(A
T
)
T
=
rank
A
It follows from these two inequalities that
rank
A
=
rank
A
T , which is what we wanted
to show.
It is instructive to see how a speciﬁc example might work out in the preceding proof.
For example,
R might look like this, where an “x” designates an arbitrary entry,
R
=
2

Thus if we use elementary row operations to zero out the entries below a column pivot,
all entries to the right and below this pivot are unaffected by these operations. Now start
with the leftmost column and proceed to the right, zeroing out all entries under each
column pivot. The result is a matrix that looks like

Now swap rows to move the zero rows to the bottom if necessary and we see that the
reduced row echelon form of
R
T has exactly as many nonzero rows as did
R, that is,
r
nonzero rows.
A ﬁrst application of this important fact is to give a fuller picture of the rank of a product
of matrices than Theorem 2.4.17:
COROLLARY 2.4.19. If the product
AB is deﬁned, then
Rank of Matrix

PROOF. We know from Theorem 2.4.17 that
rank
AB

rank
A and
rank
B
T
A
T

rank
B
T
Since
B

T

)
T
; Theorem 2.4.18 tells us that
rank
B
T
A
T
=
rank
AB and
rank
B
T
=
rank
B
Put all this together and we have
rank
AB
=
rank
B
T
A
T

rank
B
T
=
rank
B
It follows that
rank
AB is at most the smaller of
rank
A and
rank
B, which is what the
corollary asserts.

2.5. Matrix Inverses
Deﬁnitions
We have seen that if we could make sense of “1=
A”, then we could write the solution to
the linear system
Ax
=
b as simply
x
=
(1=
A)b: We are going to tackle this problem
now. First, we need a deﬁnition of the object that we are trying to uncover. Notice that
“inverses” could only work on one side. For example,

1
2


 1
1

=
[1]
=

2
3


 1


which suggests that both

1
2

and

2
3

should qualify as left inverses of the
matrix

 1
1

, since multiplication on the left by them results in a
1

1 identity matrix.
As a matter of fact right and left inverses are studied and do have applications. But they
have some unusual properties such as non-uniqueness. We are going to focus on a type
of inverse that is closer to the familiar inverses in ﬁelds of numbers, namely, two-sided
inverses. These only make sense for square matrices, so the non-square example above
is ruled out.
DEFINITION 2.5.1. Let
A be a square matrix. Then a (two-sided) inverse for
A is a
square matrix
B of the same size as
A such that
AB
=
I
=
B
A: If such a
B exists,
then the matrix
A is said to be invertible.
Of course, any non-square matrix is non-invertible. Square matrices are classiﬁed as
either “ singular”, i.e., non-invertible, or “ nonsingular”, i.e., invertible. Since we will
mostly be concerned with two-sided inverses, the unqualiﬁed term “inverse” will be un-
derstood to mean a “two-sided inverse.” Notice that this deﬁnition is actually symmetric
in
A and
B
: In other words, if
B is an inverse for
A, then
A is an inverse for
B
:

are working strictly from the deﬁnition.) We have

other.
EXAMPLE 2.5.3. Show that the matrix
A
=

1
1
1
1

cannot have an inverse.
SOLUTION. How do we get our hands on a “non-inverse”? We try an indirect approach.
If
A had an inverse
B, then we could always ﬁnd a solution to the linear system
Ax
=
b
by multiplying each side on the left by
B to obtain that
B
Ax
=
I
x
=
x
=
B
b, no
matter what right hand side vector
b we used. Yet it is easy to come up with right hand
side vectors for which the system has no solution. For example, try
b
=

1
2

. Since
the resulting system is clearly inconsistent, there cannot be an inverse matrix
B, which
is what we wanted to show.
The moral of this last example is that it is not enough for every entry of a matrix to be
nonzero for the matrix itself to be invertible. Our next example yields a gold mine of
invertible matrices, namely any elementary matrix we construct.
EXAMPLE 2.5.4. Find formulas for inverses of all the elementary matrices.
SOLUTION. Remember from Corollary 2.4.4 that left multiplication by an elementary
matrix is the same as performing the corresponding elementary row operation. Further-
more, from the discussion following Theorem 1.4.5 we see the following

Laws of Inverses
Here are some of the basic laws of inverse calculations.
Laws of Matrix Inverses. Let
A;
B
;
C be matrices of the appropriate sizes
so that the following multiplications make sense,
I a suitably sized identity
matrix, and
c a nonzero scalar. Then
1. (Uniqueness) The matrix
A has at most one inverse, henceforth de-
noted as
A
 1, provided
A is invertible.
2. (Double Inverse) If
A is invertible, then
 A
 1

 1
=
A:
3. (2=3 Rule) If any two of the three matrices
A,
B and
AB are invertible,
then so is the third, and moreover
(AB
)
 1
=
B
 1
A
 1
:
4. If
A is invertible, then
(cA)
 1
=
(1=c)A
 1
:
5. (Inverse/Transpose) If
A is invertible, then
(A
T
)
 1
=
(A
 1
)
T and
(A
H
)
 1
=
(A
 1
)
H
:
6. (Cancellation) Suppose
A is invertible. If
AB
=
AC or
B
A
=
C
A,
then
B
=
C
:
Notes: Observe that the
2=3 Rule reverses order when taking the inverse of a product.
This should remind you of the operation of transposing a product. A common mistake
is to forget to reverse the order. Secondly, notice that the cancellation law restores
something that appeared to be lost when we ﬁrst discussed matrices. Yes, we can cancel
a common factor from both sides of an equation, but (1) the factor must be on the same
side and (2) the factor must be an invertible matrix.
Veriﬁcation of Laws: Suppose that both
B and
C work as inverses to the matrix
A:
We will show that these matrices must be identical. For associativity of matrices and
identity laws give that
B
=
B
I
=
B
(AC
)
=
(B
A)C
=
I
C
=
C
Henceforth, we shall write
A
 1 for the unique (two-sided) inverse of the square matrix
A, provided of course that there is an inverse at all (remember that existence of inverses
is not a sure thing).
The double inverse law is a matter of examining the deﬁnition of inverse:
AA
 1
=
I
=
A
 1
A
shows that
A is an inverse matrix for
A
 1
: Hence,
(A
 1
)
 1
=
A:
Now suppose that
A and
B are both invertible and of the same size. Use the laws of
matrix arithmetic and we see that
AB
(B
 1
A
 1
)
=
A(B

what we wanted to show. We leave the remaining cases of the

Suppose that

A similar calculation on the other side shows that

Next, apply the transpose operator to the deﬁnition of inverse (Equation 2.5.1) and use
the law of transpose products to obtain that

that
(A

=
(A

T , which is the inverse/transpose law. The same argument works
with Hermitian transpose in place of transpose.
Finally, if
A is invertible and
AB
=
AC, then multiply both sides of this equation on
the left by
A

We can now extend the power notation to negative exponents.

sense as a sum, since one term is a scalar and the other two are matrices.
Rank and Inverse Calculation
Although we can calculate a few examples of inverses such as the last example, we
really need a general procedure. So let’s get right to the heart of the matter. How can
we ﬁnd the inverse of a matrix, or decide that none exists? Actually, we already have
done all the hard work necessary to understand computing inverses. The secret is in the
notion of reduced row echelon form and the attendant idea of rank. (Remember, we use
elementary row operations to reduce a matrix to its reduced row echelon form. Once
we have done so, the rank of the matrix is simply the number of nonzero rows in the
reduced row echelon form.) Let’s recall the results of Example 2.3.12:


(1=4)E
12

2
 1

4


Now remove the last column from each of the matrices at the right of each side and we
have this result:




E

This suggests that if

A

=
E

(1=4)E

To prove this, we argue in the general case as follows: let
A be an
n


suppose that by a succession of elementary row operations
E

;
E

:

E

: By repeated application of the 2/3 theorem, we see
that a product of any number of invertible matrices is invertible. Since each elementary
matrix is invertible, it follows that
B is. Multiply both sides of the equation
I

B
A by
B
 1 to obtain that
B
 1
I
=
B
 1
=
B
 1
B
A
=
A: Therefore, A is the inverse of the
matrix
B, hence is itself invertible.
Here’s a practical trick for computing this product of elementary matrices on the ﬂy:
Super-
Augmented
Matrix
form what we term the super-augmented matrix
[A
j
I
]: Now, if we perform the ele-
mentary operation
E on the super-augmented matrix we have the same result as
E
[A
j
I
]
=
[E
A
j
E
I
]
=
[E
A
j

]
So the matrix occupied by the
I part of the super-augmented matrix is just the product
of the elementary matrices that we have used so far. Now continue applying elemen-
tary row operations until the part of the matrix originally occupied by
A is reduced
to the reduced row echelon form of
A: We end up with this schematic picture of our
calculations:

The formula of the preceding example is well worth memorizing, since we will fre-
quently need to ﬁnd the inverse of a
2

2 matrix. Notice that in order for it to make
sense, we have to have
D nonzero. The number
D is called the determinant of the ma-
trix
A: We will have more to say about this number in the next section. In our current
example it is fairly easy to see why
A must have
D
6=
0 in order for its inverse to exist
if we look ahead to the next theorem. Notice in the above elementary operation calcu-
lations that if
D
=
0 then elementary operations on
A lead to a matrix with a row of
zeros. Therefore, the rank of
A will be smaller than
2: Here is a summary of our current
knowledge of the invertibility of a square matrix.
THEOREM 2.5.9. The following are equivalent conditions on the square

2. There is a square matrix
B such that

A
=
n:
7. The reduced row echelon form of
A is
I
n
:
8. The matrix
A is a product of elementary matrices.
PROOF. The method of proof here is to show that each condition implies the next,
and that the last condition implies the ﬁrst. This connects all the conditions in a circle,
so that any one condition will imply any other and therefore all are equivalent to each
other. Here is our chain of reasoning:
(1) implies (2): Assume
A is invertible. Then the choice
B
=
A
 1 certainly satisﬁes
condition (2).
(2) implies (3): Assume (2) is true. Given a system
Ax
=
b, we can multiply both sides
on the left by
B to get that
x
=
I
x
=
B
Ax
=
B
b: So there is only one solution, if any.
On the other hand, if the system were inconsistent then we would have
rank
A
<
n: By
Corollary 2.4.19
rank
B
A
<
n, contradicting the fact that
rank
I
n
=
n: Hence, there
is a solution, which proves (3).
(3) implies (4): This statement is obvious.
(4) implies (5): Assume (4) is true. Say the unique solution to
Ax
=
b is
x
0
: If the
system
Ax
=
0 had a nontrivial solution, say
z, then we could add
z to
x
0 to obtain a
different solution
x
0
+
z of the system
Ax
=
b (check:
A(z
+
x
0
)
=
Az
+
Ax
0
=
0
+
b
=
b:) This is impossible since (4) is true, so (5) follows.
(5) implies (6): Assume (5) is true. We know from Theorem 1.4.15 of Chapter 1 that
the consistent system
Ax
=
0 has a unique solution precisely when the rank of
A is
n:
Hence (6) must be true.
(6) implies (7): Assume (6) is true. The reduced row echelon form of
A is the same
size as
A, that is
n

n, and must have a row pivot entry
1 in every row which must be
the only nonzero entry in its column. This exactly describes the matrix
I
n, so that (7) is
true.
(7) implies (8): Assume (7) is true. We know that the matrix
A is reduced to its re-
duced row echelon form by applying a sequence of elementary operations, or what
amounts to the same thing, by multiplying the matrix
A on the left by elementary
matrices
E

I, showing that
A is a product of elementary matrices which is
condition (8).
(8) implies (1): Assume (8) is true. Repeated application of the
2=3 Inverses Rule
shows that the product of any number of invertible matrices is itself invertible. Since
elementary matrices are invertible, condition (1) must be true.
There is an interesting consequence to Theorem 2.5.9 that has been found to be useful
in some contexts. It’s an either/or statement, so it will always have something to say
about any square linear system. This type of statement is sometimes called a Fredholm
alternative. Many theorems go by this name, and we’ll state another one in Chapter 5.
Fredholm
Alternative
Notice that a matrix is not invertible if and only one of the conditions of the Theorem
fail. Certainly it is true that either a square matrix is invertible or not invertible. That’s

2.5. MATRIX INVERSES
93
all this Fredholm alternative really says, but it uses the equivalent conditions (3) and (5)
of Theorem 2.5.9 to say it in a different way:
COROLLARY 2.5.10. Given a square linear system
Ax
=
b, either the system has a
unique solution for every right hand side vector
b or there is a nonzero solution
x
=
x

to the homogeneous system
Ax
=
0:
We conclude this section with an application of the matrix algebra developed so far to
the problem of solving nonlinear equations. Although we focus on two equations in
two unknowns, the same ideas can be extended to any number of equations in as many
unknowns.
Recall that we could solve the one variable (usually nonlinear) equation
f
(x)
=
0 for
a solution point
x
1 at which
f
(x
1
)
=
0 from a given “nearby” point
x
0 by setting
dx
=
x
1
 x
0
; and assuming that the change in
f is
f
=
f
(x
1
)
 f
(x
0
)
=
 f
(x

f
=
f
0
(x

)
dx
=
f
0
(x

)(x
1
 x
0
):
Now solve for
x
1 in the equation
 f
(x
0
)
=
f
0
(x
0
)(x
1
 x
0
) and get the equation
x
1
=
x
0
 f
(x
0
)
f
0
(x

)
Replace
1 by
n
+
1 and
0 by
n to obtain the famous Newton formula:
x
n+1
=
x
n
 f
(x
n
)
f
0
(x
n
)
(2.5.1)
The idea is to start with
x
0
; use the formula to get
x
1 and if
f
(x
1
) is not close enough
to
0; then repeat the calculation with
x
1 in place of
x
0
; and so forth until a satisfactory
value of
x
=
x
n is reached. How does this relate to a two variable problem? We
illustrate the basic idea in two variables.

g
(x;

Now we can pull the same trick with differentials as in the one variable problem by
setting
dx

0
;
dy
=
y
1
 y
0
; where
f
(x

=

both
f and
g by differentials, and recalling the deﬁnition of these differentials in terms
of partial derivatives. This leads to a system

2.6. Basic Properties of Determinants
What are they?
Many students have already had some experience with determinants and may have used
them in high school to solve square systems of equations. Why have we waited until
now to introduce them? In point of fact, they are not really the best tool for solving
systems. That distinction goes to Gaussian elimination. Were it not for the theoretical
usefulness of determinants they might be consigned to a footnote in introductory linear
algebra texts as an historical artifact of linear algebra.
To motivate determinants, consider Example 2.5.8. Something remarkable happened in
that example. Not only were we able to ﬁnd a formula for the inverse of a
2

2 matrix
A
=

a
b
c
d

, but we were able to compute a single number
D
=
ad
 bc that told us
whether
A was invertible or not. The condition of non-invertibility, namely that
D
=
0,
has a very simple interpretation: this happens exactly when one row of
A is a multiple
of the other, since the example showed that this is when elementary operations use the
ﬁrst row to zero out the second row. Can we extend this idea? Is there a single number
that will tell us whether or not there are dependencies among the rows of the square

2.6. BASIC PROPERTIES OF DETERMINANTS
97
matrix
A that cause its rank to be smaller than its row size? The answer is yes. This
is exactly what determinants were invented for. The concept of determinant is subtle
and not intuitive, and researchers had to accumulate a large body of experience before
they were able to formulate a “correct” deﬁnition for this number. There are alternate
deﬁnitions of determinants, but the following will suit our purposes. It is sometimes
referred to as “expansion down the ﬁrst column.”
DEFINITION 2.6.1. The determinant of a square matrix
n


A
=
[a
ij
] is
the scalar quantity
det
A deﬁned recursively as follows: if
n
=
1 then
det
A
=
a
11;
otherwise, we suppose that determinants are deﬁned for all square matrices of size less
than
n and specify that

A by
deleting the
ith row and
jth column of
A:
Caution: The determinant of a matrix
A is a scalar number. It is not a matrix quantity.

A point worth observing here is that we didn’t really have to calculate the determinant
of any matrix if it is multiplied by a zero. Hence, the more zeros our matrix has, the
easier we expect the determinant calculation to be!
NOTATION 2.6.4. Another common symbol for
det
A is
jAj, which is also written with
respect to the elements of
A by suppressing matrix brackets:

This notation invites a certain oddity, if not abuse, of language: we sometimes refer
to things like the “second row” or “(2;
3)th element” or the “size” of the determinant.
Yet the determinant is only a number and doesn’t really have rows or entries or a size.
Rather, it is the underlying matrix whose determinant is being calculated that has these
properties. So be careful of this notation; we plan to use it frequently because it’s
handy, but you should bear in mind that determinants and matrices are not the same
thing! Another reason that this notation can be tricky is the case of a one dimensional
matrix, say
A
=
[a
11
]: Here it is deﬁnitely not a good idea to forget the brackets, since
we already understand
ja

j to be the absolute value of the scalar

Laws of Determinants
Our primary goal here is to show that determinants have the magical property we
promised: a matrix is singular exactly when its determinant is
0: Along the way we
will examine some useful properties of determinants. There is a lot of clever algebra
that can be done here; we will try to keep matters straightforward (if that’s possible with
determinants). In order to focus on the main ideas, we will place most of the proofs of
key facts at the end of the next section for optional reading. Also, a concise summary of
the basic determinantal laws is given at the end of this section. Unless otherwise stated,
we assume throughout this section that matrices are square, and that
A
=
[a
ij
] is an
n

n matrix.
For starters, let’s observe that it’s very easy to calculate the determinant of upper trian-
gular matrices. Let
A be such a matrix. Then

Hence we have established our ﬁrst determinantal law:
D1: If
A is an upper triangular matrix, then the determinant of
A is the product of all
the diagonal elements of
A:

and

:
SOLUTION. By D1 we can do this at a glance:
D
=
4

( 1)

2

2
=
 16: Since
I
n
is diagonal, it is certainly upper triangular. Moreover, the entries down the diagonal of
this matrix are
1’s, so D1 implies that
jI
n
j
=
1:
Next, suppose that we notice a common factor of the scalar
c in a row, say for conve-
nience, the ﬁrst one. How does this affect the determinantal calculation? In the case
of a
1

1 determinant, we could simply factor it out of the original determinant. The
general situation is covered by this law:

One can easily check that this is the same answer we get by working the determinant
directly from deﬁnition.
Next, suppose we interchange two rows of a determinant. Then we have the following:
D3: If
B is obtained from
A by interchanging two rows of
A , then
det
B
=
 det
A:
EXAMPLE 2.6.8. Use D3 to show the following handy fact: if a determinant has a
repeated row, then it must be
0:
SOLUTION. Suppose that the
ith and
jth rows of the matrix
A are identical, and
B
is obtained by switching these two rows of
A: Clearly
B
=
A: Yet, according to D3,
det
B
=
 det
A: It follows that
det
A
=
 det
A, i.e., if we add
det
A to both sides,
2

det
A
=
0, so that
det
A
=
0, which is what we wanted to show.
Now we ask what happens to a determinant if we add a multiple of one row to another.
The answer is as follows.
D4: If
B is obtained from
A by adding a multiple of one row of
A to another row of
A,
then
det
B
=
det
A:

in this case, add

2.6. BASIC PROPERTIES OF DETERMINANTS

EXAMPLE 2.6.10. Use D3 to show that a matrix with a row of zeros has zero determi-
nant.
SOLUTION. Suppose
A has a row of zeros. Add any other row of the matrix
A to this
zero row to obtain a matrix
B with repeated rows.
We now have enough machinery to establish the most important property of determi-
nants. First of all, we can restate laws D2-D4 in the language of elementary matrices as
follows:
 D2:
det(E
i
(c)A)
=
c

det
A (remember that for
E
i
(c) to be an elementary
Determinant of

Matrices
matrix,
c
6=
0:)
 D3:
det(E
ij
A)
=
 det
A
 D4:
det(E
ij
(s)A)
=
det
A
Apply a sequence of elementary row operations on the
n

n matrix
A to reduce it to
its reduced row echelon form
R, or equivalently, multiply
A on the left by elementary
matrices
E
1
;
E
2
;
:
:
:
;
E
k and obtain
R
=
E

E
2
:
:
:
E

Take determinant of both sides to obtain

R
=
det
(E
1
E
2
:
:
:
E
k
A)
=
(nonzeroconstant)

det
A
Therefore,
det
A
=
0 precisely when
det
R
=
0: Now the reduced row echelon form
of
A is certainly upper triangular. In fact, it is guaranteed to have zeros on the diagonal,
and therefore have zero determinant by D1, unless
rank
A
=
n, in which case
R
=
I
n
:
According to Theorem 2.5.9 this happens precisely when
A is invertible. Thus we have
shown:
D5: The matrix
A is invertible if and only if
det
A
6=
0:

2. MATRIX ALGEBRA
There are two more surprising properties of determinants that we now discuss. Their
proofs involve using determinantal properties of elementary matrices (see the next sec-
tion for details).
D6: Given matrices
A;
B of the same size,
det
AB
=
det
A
det
B
EXAMPLE 2.6.12. Verify D6 in the case that

.
How do
det(A
+
B
) and
det
A
+
det
B compare in this case?
SOLUTION. We have easily that
det
A
=
1 and
det
B
=

det
A

det
B
=
1
+

=

=



=

6=
det
A
+
det
B
:
This example raises a very important point.
Caution: In general,
det
A
+
det
B
6=
det(A
+
B
), though there are occasional excep-
tions.
In other words, determinants do not distribute over sums. (It is true, however, that the
determinant is additive in one row at a time. See the proof of D4 for details.)
Finally, we ask how
det
A
T compares to
det
A: Try a simple case like the
2

2 and
we discover that there seems to be no difference in determinant. This is exactly what
happens in general.
D7: For all square matrices
A,
det
A
T
=
det
A:

D




( 2)

2
=
 16:
D7 is a very useful fact. Let’s look at it from this point of view: transposing a matrix in-
terchanges the rows and columns of the matrix. Therefore, everything that we have said
about rows of determinants applies equally well to the columns, including the deﬁni-
tion of determinant itself! Therefore, we could have given the deﬁnition of determinant
in terms of expanding across the ﬁrst row instead of down the ﬁrst column and gotten
the same answers. Likewise, we could perform elementary column operations instead
of row operations and get the same results as D2-D4. Furthermore, the determinant
of a lower triangular matrix is the product of its diagonal elements thanks to D7+D1.
By interchanging rows or columns then expanding by ﬁrst row or column, we see that
the same effect is obtained by simply expanding the determinant down any column or

2.6. BASIC PROPERTIES OF DETERMINANTS
103
across any row. We have to alternate signs starting with the sign
( 1)
i+j of the ﬁrst
term we use.
Now we can really put it all together and compute determinants to our heart’s content
with a good deal less effort than the original deﬁnition speciﬁed. We can use D1-D4
in particular to make a determinant calculation no worse than Gaussian elimination in
the amount of work we have to do. We simply reduce a matrix to triangular form by
elementary operations, then take the product of the diagonal terms.

SOLUTION. We are going to do this calculation two ways. We may as well use the
same elementary operation notation that we have employed in Gaussian elimination.
The only difference is that we have equality instead of arrows, provided that we modify
the value of the new determinant in accordance with the laws D1-D3. So here is the
straightforward method:

Here is another approach: let’s expand the determinant down the second column, since it
is mostly
0’s. Remember that the sign in front of the ﬁrst minor must be
( 1)
1+2
=

Also, the coefﬁcients of the ﬁrst three minors are

2. MATRIX ALGEBRA
2.7. *Applications and Proofs for Determinants
There are two fundamental applications of determinants that we develop in this section.
The ﬁrst is the derivation of an explicit formula for the inverse of a matrix in terms of
its coefﬁcients and determinant, which extends the
2

2 Example 2.5.8 to matrices of
all sizes. From this example, one might wonder if a similar calculation could be done
for any matrix. We will see that it can. The second application is something that many
have already seen in high school algebra, at least for
2

2 and
3

3 systems: Cramer’s
Rule gives a way of solving square systems, provided that they have a unique solution.
An Inverse Formula
Let
A
=
[a
ij
] be
n

n: We have already seen that we can expand the determinant of
A down any column of
A (see the discussion following Example 2.6.13). These lead to
cofactor formulas for each column number
j:
det
A
=
n
X
k
=1
a
k
j
A
k
j
=
n
X
k
=1
A

=
A
1i
a
1j
+
A
2i

nj
The key to understanding this expression is to realize that it is exactly what we would
get if we replaced the
ith column of the matrix
A by its
jth column and then computed
the determinant of the resulting matrix by expansion down the
ith column. But such a
matrix has two equal columns and therefore has a zero determinant, which we can see
by applying Example 2.6.8 to the transpose of the matrix and using D7. So this sum
must be
0 if
i
6=
j: We can combine these two sums by means of the Kronecker delta in
the formula
n
X
k

A

In order to exploit this formula we make the following deﬁnitions:

Cramer’s Rule

systems with a nonsingular coefﬁcient matrix. Here’s how we proceed. To solve

The truth of the matter is that Cramer’s Rule and adjoints are only good for small ma-

trices and theoretical arguments. For if you evaluate determinants in a straightforward
way from the deﬁnition, the work in doing so is about
2n! ﬂops for an
n

n system.
(Recall that a “ﬂop” in numerical linear algebra is a single addition or subtraction, or
multiplication or division. For example, it is not hard to show that the operation of
adding a multiple of one row vector of length
n to another requires
2n ﬂops. This
number
2n! is vast when compared to the number
2n

elimination, even with “small”

On the other hand, there is a clever way to evaluate determinants that is much less
work than the deﬁnition: use elementary row operations together with D2, D6 and the
elementary operations that correspond to these rules to reduce the determinant to that
of a triangular matrix. This will only require about
2n
3
=3 ﬂops. As a matter of fact,
it is tantamount to Gaussian elimination. But to use Cramer’s Rule, you will have to
calculate
n
+
1 determinants. So why bother with Cramer’s Rule on larger problems
when it still will take about
n times as much work as Gaussian elimination? A similar
remark applies to computing adjoints instead of using Gauss-Jordan elimination on the
super-augmented matrix of
A:

But all the determinants in the summation sign come from a submatrix of
A with the ﬁrst
and second row interchanged. Since they are smaller than
n, they are just the negative
of the corresponding minor of
A: Notice that the ﬁrst two terms are just the ﬁrst two
terms in the determinantal expansion of
A, except that they are out of order and have

2.7. *APPLICATIONS AND PROOFS FOR DETERMINANTS
111
an extra minus sign. Factor this minus sign out of every term and we have obtained
D3.
D4: If
B is obtained from
A by adding a multiple of one row of
A to another row of
A,
then
det
B
=
det
A:
Actually, it’s a little easier to answer a slightly more general question: what happens
if we replace a row of a determinant by that row plus some other row vector
r (not
necessarily a row of the determinant)? Again, simply for convenience of notation, we
assume the row in question is the ﬁrst. The same argument works for any other row.
Some notation: let
B be the matrix which we obtain from the
n

n matrix
A by adding
the row vector
r
=
[r
1
;
r
2
;
:
:
:
;
r

] to the ﬁrst row and
C the matrix obtained from
A
by replacing the ﬁrst row by
r:The answer turns out to be that the
jB
j
=
jAj
+
jC
j: One
way of saying this is to say that the determinant function is “additive in each row.” Let’s
see what happens in the one dimensional case:
jB
j
=
j[a

r

]j
=
a
11
+
r

=
j[a

Suppose we have established the same is true for all matrices of size less than
n and let
A be
n

n: Then the minors
M
k

(B

k
>
1, are smaller than
n so the property
holds for them. Hence we have

Hence we have shown D4.
D6: Given matrices
A;
B of the same size,

The key is that we now know that determinant calculation is intimately connected with
elementary matrices, rank and the reduced row echelon form. First let’s reinterpret
D2-D4 still one more time. First of all take
A

In summary: For any elementary matrix
E and arbitrary matrix
A of the same size,
det(E
A)
=
det(E
)
det
(A):
Now let’s consider this question: how does
det
(AB
) relate to
det(A) and
det
(B
)? If
A is not invertible,
rank
A
<
n by Theorem 2.5.9 and so
rank
AB
<
n by Corol-
lary 2.4.19. Therefore,
det(AB
)
=
0
=
det


det
B in this case. Next suppose that
A
is invertible. Express it as a product of elementary matrices, say
A

use our summary of D1-D3 to disassemble and reassemble the elementary factors:

det

Thus we have shown that D6 holds.
D7: For all square matrices
A,

Recall these facts about elementary matrices:

Therefore, transposing does not affect determinants of elementary matrices. Now for the
general case observe that, since
A and
A
T are transposes of each other, one is invertible
if and only if the other is by the Transpose/Inverse law. In particular, if both are singular,
then
det

=

A: On the other hand, if both are nonsingular, then write

2.8. *Tensor Products
How do we solve a system of equations in which the unknowns can be organized into a
matrix
X and the linear system in question is of the form
AX
 X
B
=
C
(2.8.1)
where
A;
B
;
C are given matrices? We call this equation the Sylvester equation. Such
systems occur in a number of physical applications; for example, discretizing certain
partial differential equations in order to solve them numerically can lead to such a sys-
tem. We are going to examine a matrix method for systematically reorganizing the data
into a single column so that the resulting system looks like an ordinary linear system.
The basic idea needed here is that of the tensor product of two matrices, which is deﬁned
as follows:
DEFINITION 2.8.1. Let
A

[a
ij
] be an
m

p matrix and
B

Then the tensor product of

block form as

We can think of the tensor product as a kind of matrix multiplication. One point that
comes out of Example 2.8.2 is that, even though
A

The other ingredient that we need to solve Equation 2.8.1 is an operator that turns ma-
trices into vectors which is deﬁned as follows.
DEFINITION 2.8.3. Let
A be an

A is obtained
from
A by stacking the
n columns of
A vertically, with the ﬁrst column at the top and
the last column of
A at the bottom.

The proof of this statement amounts to checking corresponding entries of each side of

is linear, that is,
v

The following is a very basic application of the tensor product. Suppose we wish to
model a two dimensional heat diffusion process on a ﬂat plate that occupies the unit
square in the
xy-plane. We proceed as we did in the one dimensional process described
in the introductionof Chapter 1. To ﬁx ideas, we assume that the heat source is described
by a function
f
(x;
y
);
0

x

1;
0

y

1, and that the temperature is held at
0 at
the boundary of the unit square. Also, the conductivity coefﬁcient is assumed to be the
constant
k
: Cover the square with a uniformly spaced set of grid points
(x
i
;
y
j
);
0

i;
j

n
+
1, called nodes, and assume that the spacing in each direction is a width
h
=
1=(n
+
1): Also assume that the temperature function at the
(i;
j
)th node is
u
ij
=
u(x
i
;
y
j
) and that the source is
f
ij
=
f
(x
i
;
y
j
): Notice that the values of
u on boundary
grid points is set at 0. For example,
u
01
=
u
20
=
0: By balancing the heat ﬂow in the
horizontal and vertical directions, one arrives at a system of linear equations, one for
each node, of the form

(2.8.2)
Observe that values of boundary nodes are zero, so these are not unknowns, which is
why the indexing of the equations starts at
1 instead of
0: There are exactly as many
equations as unknown grid point values. Each equation has a “molecule” associated
with it which is obtained by circling the nodes that occur in the equation and connecting
these circles. A picture of a few nodes is given in Figure 2.8.1.

LU Factorization
Here is a problem: suppose we want to solve a nonsingular linear system
Ax
=
b repeat-
edly, with different choices of
b: A perfect example of this kind of situation is the heat
ﬂow problem Example 1.1.5 where the right hand side is determined by the heat source
term
f
(x): Suppose that we need to experiment with different source terms. What hap-
pens if we do straight Gaussian elimination or Gauss-Jordan elimination? Each time
we carry out a complete calculation on the augmented matrix
e
A
=
[A
j
b] we have to
resolve the whole system. Yet, the main part of our work is the same: putting the part of
e
A corresponding to the coefﬁcient matrix
A into reduced row echelon form. Changing
the right hand side has no effect on this work. What we want here is a way to somehow
record our work on
A, so that solving a new system involves very little additional work.
This is exactly what the LU factorization is all about.
DEFINITION 2.9.1. Let
A be an
n

n matrix. An LU factorization of
A is a pair of
n

n matrices
L;
U such that
1.
L is lower triangular.
2.
U is upper triangular.
3.
A
=
LU:
Even if we could ﬁnd such beasts, what is so wonderful about them? The answer is that
triangular systems
Ax
=
b are easy to solve. For example, if
A is upper triangular,
we learned that the smart thing to do was to use the last equation to solve for the last
variable, then the next to the last equation for the next to the last variable, etc. This is the
secret of Gaussian elimination! But lower triangular systems are just as simple: use the
ﬁrst equation to solve for the ﬁrst variable, the second equation for the second variable,
and so forth. Now suppose we want to solve
Ax
=
b and we know that
A
=
LU: The
original system becomes
LU
x
=
b: Introduce an intermediate variable
y
=
U
x: Now
perform these steps:
1. (Forward solve) Solve lower triangular system
Ly
=
b for the variable
y
:
2. (Back solve) Solve upper triangular system
U
x
=
y for the variable
x:
This does it! Once we have the matrices
L;
U, we don’t have to worry about right hand
sides, except for the small amount of work involved in solving two triangular systems.
Notice, by the way, that since
A is assumed nonsingular, we have that if
A
=
LU, then

give a unique solution.

Notice how simple the previous example was, given the LU factorization. Now how do
we ﬁnd such a factorization? In general, a nonsingular matrix may not have such a fac-
torization. A good example is the matrix

0
1
1
0

: However, if Gaussian elimination
can be performed on the matrix
A without row exchanges, then such a factorization is
really a by-product of GE. In this case let
[a
(k
)
ij
] be the matrix obtained from
A after
using the
kth pivot to clear out entries below it (thus
A
=
[a
(0)
ij
]). Remember that in GE
we only need two types of elementary operations, namely row exchanges and adding
a multiple of one row to another. Furthermore, the only elementary operations of the
latter type that we use are of this form:
E
ij
( a
(k
)
j
j
=a
(k
)
ij
), where
[a
(k
)
ij
] is the matrix
obtained from
A from the various elementary operations up to this point. The numbers
m
ij
=
 a
(k
)
j
j
=a
(k
)
ij , where
i
>
j, are sometimes called multipliers. In the way of nota-
tion, let us call a triangular matrix a unit triangular matrix if its diagonal entries are all
1’s.

120
2. MATRIX ALGEBRA
THEOREM 2.9.3. If Gaussian elimination is used without row exchanges on the non-
singular matrix
A, resulting in the upper triangular matrix
U, and if
L is the unit lower
triangular matrix whose entries below the diagonal are the negatives of the multipliers
m
ij, then
A
=
LU:
PROOF. The proof of this theorem amounts to noticing that the product of all the
elementary operations that reduces
A to
U is a unit lower triangular matrix
e
L with the
multipliers
m
ij in the appropriate positions. Thus
e
L
A
=
U: To undo these operations,
multiply by a matrix
L with the negatives of the multipliers in the appropriate positions.
This results in
L
e
L
A
=
A
=
LU
as desired.
The following example shows how one can write an efﬁcient program to implement LU
factorization. The idea is this: as we do Gaussian elimination the U part of the factor-
ization gradually appears in the upper parts of the transformed matrices
A
(k
)
: Below the
diagonal we replace nonzero entries with zeros, column by column. Instead of wasting
this space, use it to store the negative of the multipliers in place of the element it zeros
out. Of course, this storage part of the matrix should not be changed by subsequent
elementary row operations. When we are ﬁnished with elimination, the diagonal and
upper part of the resulting matrix is just
U and the strictly lower triangular part on the
unit lower triangular matrix
L is stored in the lower part of the matrix.

What can be said if pivoting is required (for example, we might want to use a partial piv-
oting strategy)? Take the point of view that we could see our way to the end of Gaussian
elimination and store the product
P of all row exchanging elementary operations that
we use along the way. A product of such matrices is called a permutation matrix; such
a matrix is invertible, since it is a product of invertible matrices. Thus if we apply the
correct permutation matrix
P to
A we obtain a matrix for which Gaussian elimination
will succeed without further row exchanges. Consequently, we have a theorem that
applies to all nonsingular matrices. Notice that it does not limit the usefulness of LU

factorization since the linear system
Ax
=
b is equivalent to the system
P
Ax
=
P
b:
The following theorem could be called the “PLU factorization theorem.”
THEOREM 2.9.5. If
A is a nonsingular matrix, then there exists a permutation matrix
P, upper triangular matrix
U, and unit lower triangular matrix
L such that
P
A
=
LU:
There are many other useful factorizations of matrices that numerical analysts have
studied, e.g., LDU and Cholesky. We will stop at LU, but there is one last point we
want to make. The amount of work in ﬁnding the LU factorization is the same as
Gaussian elimination itself, which we saw in Section 1.5 of Chapter 1 is approximately
2n
3
=3 ﬂops. The addition work of back and forward solving is about
2n
2 ﬂops. So the
dominant amount of work is done by computing the factorization rather than the back
and forward solving stages.
Project Topics
Project: LU Factorization
Write a program module that implements Theorem 2.9.5 using partial pivoting and im-
plicit row exchanges. This means that space is allocated for the
n

n matrix
A
=
[a[i;
j
]] and an array of row indices, say
indx[i]: Initially,
indx should consist of the
integers
1;
2;
:
:
:
;
n: Whenever two rows need to be exchanged, say e.g., the ﬁrst and
third, then the indices
indx[1] and
indx[3] are exchanged. References to array elements
throughout the Gaussian elimination process should be indirect: refer to the
(1;
4)th en-
try of
A as the element
a[indx[1];
4]: This method of reference has the same effect as
physically exchanging rows, but without the work. It also has the appealing feature that
we can design the algorithm as though no row exchanges have taken place provided
we replace the direct reference
a[i;
j
] by the indirect reference
a[indx[i];
j
]: The mod-
ule should return the lower/upper matrix in the format of Example 2.9.4 as well as the
permuted array
indx[i]: Effectively, this index array tells the user what the permutation
matrix
P is.
Next write an LU system solver module that uses the LU factorization to solve a general
linear system.
Finally, write a module that ﬁnds the inverse of an
n

n matrix
A by ﬁrst using the
LU factorization module, then making repeated use of the LU system solver to solve
Ax
(i)
=
e
i, where
e
i is the

Project: Markov Chains
Refer to Example 2.3.4 and Section 2.3 for background. Three automobile insurance
ﬁrms compete for a ﬁxed market of customers. Annual premiums are sold to these
customers. We will label the companies A, B and C. You work for Company A, and
your team of market analysts has done a survey which draws the following conclusions:
in each of the past three years, the number of A customers switching to B is 20%, and
to C is 30%. The number of B customers switching to A is 20%, and to C is 20%.
The number of C customers switching to A is 30%, and to B is 10%. Those who do not

122
2. MATRIX ALGEBRA
switch continue to use their current company’s insurance for the next year. The ﬁrst part
of your problem is to model this market as a Markov chain. Display the transition matrix
for the model. To illustrate the workings of the model, show what it would predict as
the market shares three years from now if currently A, B and C owned equal shares of
the market.
The next part of your problem is as follows: your team has tested two advertising cam-
paigns in some smaller test markets and are conﬁdent that the ﬁrst campaign will con-
vince 20% of the B customers who would otherwise stay with B in a given year to
switch to A. The second advertising campaign would convince 20% of the C customers
who would otherwise stay with C in a given year to switch to A. Both campaigns have
about equal costs and would not change other customers habits. You have to make a
recommendation, based on your experiments with various possible initial state vectors
for the market. Will these campaigns actually improve your company’s market share?
If so, which one are you going to recommend to your superiors? Write up your recom-
mendation in the form of a report, with supporting evidence. It’s a good idea to hedge
on your bets a little by pointing out limitations to your model and claims, so devote a
few sentences to those points.
It would be a plus to carry the analysis further (your manager might appreciate that).
For instance, you could turn the additional market share from, say B customers, into a
variable and plot the long term gain for your company against this variable. A manager
could use this data to decide if it were worthwhile to attempt gaining more customers
from B. This is a bit open ended and optional.
Project: Modeling with Directed Graphs I
Refer to Example 2.3.7 and Section 2.3 for background. As a social scientist you have
studied the inﬂuence factors that relate seven coalition groups which, for simplicity, we
will simply label
1;
2;
3;
4;
5;
6;
7: Based on empirical studies, you conclude that the
inﬂuence factors can be well modeled by a dominance-directed graph with each group
as a vertex. The meaning of the presence of an edge
(i;
j
) in the graph is that coalition
group
i can dominate, i.e., swing coalition group
j its way on a given political issue.
The data you have gathered suggests that the appropriate edge set is the following:
E
=
f(1;
2);
(1;
3);
(1;
4);
(1;
7);

Do an analysis of this power structure. This should include a graph. (It might be a good
idea to arrange the vertices in a circle and go from there.) It should also include a power
rating of each coalition group. Now suppose you were an advisor to one of these coali-
tion groups and, by currying certain favors, this group could gain inﬂuence over another
coalition group (thereby adding an edge to the graph or reversing an existing edge of
the graph). In each case, if you could pick the best group for your client to inﬂuence,
which would that be? Explain your results in the context of matrix multiplication if you
can.

CHAPTER 3
VECTOR SPACES
It is hard to overstate the importance of the idea of a vector space, a concept which has
found application in the areas of mathematics, engineering, physics, chemistry, biology,
the social sciences and others. What we encounter is an abstraction of the idea of vector
space that we studied in calculus. In this Chapter, abstraction will come in two waves.
The ﬁrst wave, which could properly be called generalization, consists of generalizing
the familiar ideas of geometrical vectors of calculus to vectors of size greater than three.
These vector spaces could still be regarded as “concrete.” The second wave consists of
abstracting the vector idea to entirely different kinds of objects. Abstraction can some-
times be difﬁcult. For some, the study of abstract ideas is its own reward. For others, the
natural reaction is to expect some payoff for the extra effort required to master abstrac-
tion. In the case of vector spaces we are happy to report that both kinds of students will
be satisﬁed: vector space theory really is a thing of beauty in itself and there is indeed
a payoff for its study. It is a practical tool that enables us to understand phenomena
that would otherwise escape our comprehension. For example, in this chapter we will
use the theory in network analysis and in ﬁnding the “best” solution to an inconsistent
system (least squares), as well as new perspectives on our old friend

3.1. Deﬁnitions and Basic Concepts
Generalization
We begin with the most concrete form of vector spaces, one that is closely in tune
with what we learned in calculus, when we were ﬁrst introduced to two and three di-
mensional vectors. Bear in mind that in calculus we were only concerned with real
numbers as scalars. However, we have seen that the complex numbers are a perfectly
legitimate (and sometimes more useful than the reals) ﬁeld of numbers to work with.
Therefore, our concept of a vector space must include the selection of a ﬁeld of scalars.
The requirements for such a ﬁeld are that it have binary operations of addition and
multiplication which satisfy the usual arithmetic laws: both operations are closed, com-
mutative, associative, have identities, satisfy distributive laws, and that there exist addi-
tive inverses and multiplicative inverses for nonzero elements. Although other ﬁelds are
possible, for our purposes the only ﬁelds of scalars are
F
=
R or
F
=
C
: As has been
the case previously in this text, unless there is some indication to the contrary, the ﬁeld
of scalars will be assumed to be the default, the real numbers
R:

A formal deﬁnition of vector space will come later. For now we describe a “vector

Geometrical vector spaces. We have already seen the vector idea in geometry or cal-
culus. In those contexts, a vector was supposed to represent a direction and a magnitude
in two or three dimensional space. At ﬁrst, one had to deal with these intuitive deﬁni-
tions until they could be turned into something more explicitly computational, namely
the following two vector spaces over the ﬁeld of real numbers:

The distinction between vector spaces and ordinary geometrical spaces becomes a little
hazy here. Once we have set up a coordinate system we can identify each point in two or
three dimensional space with its coordinates, which we write in the form of a tuple, i.e.,
a vector. The arithmetic of these two vector spaces are just the usual coordinate-wise
vector addition and scalar multiplication. One can visualize the direction represented
by a vector
(x;
y
) by drawing an arrow, i.e., directed line segment, from the origin (the
point with coordinates
(0;
0) in the plane) to the point with coordinates
(x;
y
): The
magnitude of this vector is the length of the arrow, which is just
p
x
2
+
y
2
: The arrows
that we draw only represent the vector we are thinking of. More than one arrow could
represent the same vector as in Figure 3.3.1. The deﬁnitions of vector arithmetic could
be represented geometrically too. For example, to get the sum of vectors
u and
v, one
places a representative of vector
u in the plane, then places a representative of
v whose
tail is at the head of
v, and the vector
u
+
v is then represented by the third leg of this
triangle, with base at the base of
u: To get a scalar multiple of a vector
w one scales
w
in accordance with the coefﬁcient. See Figure 3.1.1.Though instructive, this version of
vector addition is not practical for calculations.
As a practical matter, it is also convenient to draw directed line segments connecting
points; such a vector is called a displacement vector. For example, see Figure 3.1.1 for
representatives of a displacement vector
w

P
Q from the point
P with coordinates

arithmetic is that this displacement vector can be deduced from a simple calculation

As a matter of fact, this example has familiar objects in it. We already agreed in Chapter
2 to use the tuple notation as a shorthand for column vectors. The arithmetic of
R
2
and
R
3 is the same as the usual arithmetic for column vectors. Now even though we
can’t draw real geometrical pictures of vectors with four or more coordinates, we have
seen that larger vectors are useful in our search for solutions of linear systems. So the
question presents itself: why stop at three? The answer is that we won’t! We will

We see immediately from deﬁnition that the required closure properties of vector addi-
tion and scalar multiplication hold, so these really are vector spaces in the sense deﬁned
above. The standard real vector spaces are often called the real Euclidean vector spaces
once the notion of a norm (a notion of length covered in the next section) is attached to
them. As in Chapter 2, we don’t have to stop at the reals. For those situations in which
we want to use complex numbers, we have the following vector spaces:

The standard complex vector spaces are also sometimes called Euclidean spaces. It’s
rather difﬁcult to draw honest spatial pictures of complex vectors. The space
C
1 isn’t
too bad: complex numbers can be identiﬁed by points in the complex plane. What about
C
2? Where can we put
(1
+
2i;
3
 i)? It seems like we need four real coordinates,
namely the real and imaginary parts of two independent complex numbers, to keep
track of. This is too big to ﬁt in real three dimensional space, where we have only three
independent coordinates. We don’t let this technicality deter us. We can still draw fake
vector pictures of elements of
C
2 to help our intuition, but do the algebra of vectors
exactly from deﬁnition.

Abstraction
Now we examine the abstraction of our concept of vector space. First we have to iden-
tify the essential vector spaces properties, enough to make the resulting structure rich,
but not so much that it is tied down to an overly speciﬁc form. We saw in Chapter 2 that
many laws hold for the standard vector spaces. The essential laws were summarized in
Section 2.1 of Chapter 2. These laws become the basis for our deﬁnition of an abstract
vector space.
DEFINITION 3.1.5. An (abstract) vector space is a nonempty set

Examples of these abstract vector spaces are the standard spaces just introduced, and
these will be our main focus in this section. Yet, if we squint a bit, we can see vector
spaces everywhere. There are other, entirely non-standard examples, which make the
abstraction worthwhile. Here are just a few such of examples. Our ﬁrst example is
closely related to the standard spaces, though strictly speaking it is not one of them. It
blurs the distinction between matrices and vectors in Chapter 2, since it makes matrices
into “vectors” in the abstract sense of the preceding deﬁnition.
EXAMPLE 3.1.6. Let
R
m;n denote the set of all
m

n matrices with real entries. Show
this set, with the usual matrix addition and scalar multiplication, forms a vector space.
SOLUTION. We know that any two matrices of the same size can be added to yield a
matrix of that size. Likewise, a scalar times a matrix yields a matrix of the same size.
Thus the operations of matrix addition and scalar multiplication are closed. Indeed,
these laws and all the other vector space laws are summarized in the laws of matrix
addition and scalar multiplication of page 53.

3.1. DEFINITIONS AND BASIC CONCEPTS

The next example is important in many areas of higher mathematics and is quite differ-
ent from the standard vector spaces, yet all the same a perfectly legitimate vector space.
All the same, at ﬁrst it feels odd to think of functions as “vectors” even though this is
meant in the abstract sense.
EXAMPLE 3.1.7. Let
C
[0;
1] denote the set of all real valued functions that are continu-
ous on the interval

(x)):
Show that
C
[0;
1] with the given operations is a vector space.
SOLUTION. We set
V
=
C
[0;
1] and check the vector space axioms for this
V
: For the
rest of this example, we let
f
;
g
;
h be arbitrary elements of
V
: We know from calculus
that the sum of any two continuous functions is continuous and that any constant times
a continuous function is also continuous. Therefore the closure of addition and scalar
multiplication hold. Now for all
x such that
0

x

1, we have from deﬁnition and
the commutative law of real number addition that
(f
+
g
)(x)
=
f
(x)
+
g
(x)
=
g
(x)
+
f
(x)
=
(g
+
f
)(x)
Since this holds for all
x; we conclude that
f
+
g
=
g
+
f
; which is the commutative
law of vector addition. Similarly,
((f
+
g
)
+
h)(x)
=
(f
+
g
)(x)
+
h(x)
=
(f
(x)
+
g
(x))
+
h(x)
=
f
(x)
+
(g
(x)
+
h(x))
=
(f
+
(g
+
h))(x)
Since this holds for all
x; we conclude that
(f
+
g
)
+
h
=
f
+
(g
+
h); which is the
associative law for addition of vectors.
Next, if
0 denotes the constant function with value
0, then for any
f
2
V we have that
for all
0

x

1,
(f
+
0)(x)
=
f
(x)
+
0
=
f
(x)
Since this is true for all
x we have that
f
+
0
=
f, which establishes the additive identity
law. Also, we deﬁne
( f
)(x)
=
 (f
(x)) so that for all
0

x

1,
(f
+
( f
))(x)
=
f
(x)
 f
(x)
=
0
from which we see that
f
+
( f
)
=
0: The additive inverse law follows. For the
distributive laws note that for real numbers
a;
b and continuous functions
f
;
g
2
V , we
have that for all
0

x

1,
a(f
+
g
)(x)
=
a(f
(x)
+
g
(x))
=
af
(x)
+
ag
(x)
=
(af
+
ag
)(x)
which proves the ﬁrst distributive law. For the second distributive law, note that for all
0

x

1,
((a
+
b)g
)(x)
=
(a
+
b)g
(x)
=
ag
(x)
+
bg
(x)
=
(ag
+
bg
)(x)
and the second distributive law follows. For the scalar associative law, observe that for
all
0

x

1,
((ab)f
)(x)
=
(ab)f
(x)
=
a(bf
(x))
=
(a(bf
))(x)

130
3. VECTOR SPACES
so that
(ab)f
=
a(bf
), as required. Finally, we see that
(1f
)(x)
=
1f
(x)
=
f
(x)
from which we have the monoidal law
1f
=
f
: Thus,
C
[0;
1] with the prescribed oper-
ations is a vector space.
The preceding example could have just as well been
C
[a;
b]; the set of all continuous
functions on the interval
a

x

b: Indeed, most of what we say about
C
[0;
1] is
equally applicable to the more general space
C
[a;
b]: We stick to the interval
0

x

1
for simplicity. The next example is also based on the “functions as vectors” idea.
EXAMPLE 3.1.8. Let
V
=
ff
(x)
2
C
[0;
1]
j
f
(1=2)
=
0g and
W
=
ff
(x)
2
C
[0;
1]
j
f
(1=2)
=
1g; where each set has the operations of function addition and scalar multiplication as
in Example 3.1.7. One of these sets forms a vector space over the reals, while the other
does not. Determine which.
SOLUTION. Notice that we don’t have to check the commutativity of addition, associa-
tivity of addition, distributive laws, associative law or monoidal law. The reason is that
we already know from the previous example that these laws hold when the operations
of the space
C
[0;
1] are applied to any elements of
C
[0;
1]; whether they belong to
V or
W or not. So the only laws to be checked are the closure laws and the identity laws.
First let
f
(x);
g
(x)
2
V and let
c be a scalar. By deﬁnition of the set
V we have that
f
(1=2)
=
0 and
g
(1=2)
=
0: Add these equations together and we obtain
(f
+
g
)(1=2)
=
f
(1=2)
+
g
(1=2)
=
0
+
0
=
0
It follows that
V is closed under addition with these operations. Furthermore, if we
multiply the identity
f
(1=2)
=
0 by the real number
c we obtain that
(cf
)(1=2)
=
c

f
(1=2)
=
c

0
=
0
It follows that
V is closed under scalar multiplication. Now certainly the zero function
belongs to
V , since this function has value
0 at any argument. Therefore,
V contains an
additive identity element. Finally, we observe that the negative of a function
f
(x)
2
V
is also an element of
V , since
( f
)(1=2)
=
 1

f
(1=2)
=
 1

0
=
0
Therefore, the set
V with the given operations satisﬁes all the vector space laws and is
an (abstract) vector space in its own right.
When we examine the set
W in a similar fashion, we run into a roadblock at the closure
of addition law. If
f
(x);
g
(x)
2
W, then by deﬁnition of the set
W we have that
f
(1=2)
=
1 and
g
(1=2)
=
1: Add these equations together and we obtain
(f
+
g
)(1=2)
=
f
(1=2)
+
g
(1=2)
=
1
+
1
=
2
This means that
f
+
g is not in
W
; so the closure of addition fails. We need go no further.
If only one of the vector space axioms fails, then we do not have a vector space. Hence,
W with the given operations is not a vector space.
Notice that there is a certain economy in this situation. A number of laws did not need
to be checked by virtue of the fact that the sets in question were subsets of existing
vector spaces with the same vector operations. We shall have more to say about this
situation in the next section. Here is another example that is useful and instructive.

3.1. DEFINITIONS AND BASIC CONCEPTS
131
EXAMPLE 3.1.9. Show that the set
S
n of all
n

n real symmetric matrices with the
usual matrix addition and scalar multiplication form a vector space.
SOLUTION. Just as in the preceding example, we don’t have to check the commutativity
of addition, associativity of addition, distributive laws, associative law or monoidal law
since we know that these laws hold for any matrices, symmetric or not. Now let
A;
B
2
S
n
: This means by deﬁnition that
A
=
A
T and
B
=
B
T
: Let
c be any scalar. Then we
have both
(
A
+
B
)
T
=
A
T
+
B
T
=
A
+
B
and
(
cA)
T
=
cA
T
=
cA
It follows that the set
S
n is closed under the operations of matrix addition and scalar
multiplication. Furthermore, the zero
n

n matrix is clearly symmetric, so the set
S
n
has an additive identity element. Finally,
( A)
T
=
 A
T
=
 A; so each element of
S
n has an additive inverse as well. Therefore, all of the laws for a vector space are
satisﬁed, so
S
n together with these operations is an (abstract) vector space.
One of the virtues of abstraction is that it allows us to cover many cases with one state-
ment. For example, there are many simple facts that are deducible from the vector space
laws alone. With the standard vector spaces, these facts seem transparently clear. For
abstract spaces, the situation is not quite so obvious. Here are a few examples of what
can be deduced from deﬁnition.
EXAMPLE 3.1.10. Let
v
2
V
; a vector space and
0 the vector zero. Deduce from the
vector space properties alone that
0v
=
0:
SOLUTION. Certainly we have the scalar identity
0
+
0
=
0: Multiply both sides on the
right by the vector
v to obtain that
(0
+
0)v
=
0v
Now use the distributive law to obtain
0v
+
0v
=
0v
Next add
 (0v
) to both sides (remember, we don’t know it’s
0 yet), use the associative
law of addition to regroup and obtain that
0v
+
(0v
+
( 0v
))
=
0v
+
( 0v
)
Now use the additive inverse law to obtain that
0v
+
0
=
0
Finally, use the identity law to obtain
0v
=
0
which is what we wanted to show.
EXAMPLE 3.1.11. Show that the vector space
V has only one zero element.

132
3. VECTOR SPACES
SOLUTION. Suppose that both
0 and
0
 act as zero elements in the vector space. Use
the additive identity property of
0 to obtain that
0

+
0
=
0

; while the additive identity
property of
0
 implies that
0
+
0

=
0: By the commutative law of addition,
0

+
0
=
0
+
0

: It follows that
0

=
0; whence there can be only one zero element.
There are several other such arithmetic facts that we want to identify, along with the one
of this example. In the case of standard vectors, these facts are obvious, but for abstract
vector spaces, they require a proof similar to the one we have just given. We leave these
as exercises.
Laws of Vector Arithmetic. Let
v be a vector in some vector space
V and let
c be any scalar. Then
1.
0v
=
0
2.
c0
=
0
3.
( c)v
=
c( v
)
=
 (cv
)
4. If
cv
=
0; then
v
=
0 or
c
=
0:
5. A vector space has only one zero element.
6. Every vector has only one additive inverse.
A reminder about notation: just as in matrix arithmetic, for vectors
u;
v

V
; we under-
stand that
u
 v
=
u
+
( v
):
Linear Operators
We were introduced in Section 2.3 of Chapter 2 to the idea of a linear function in the
context of standard vectors. Now that we have a notion of an abstract vector space, we
can examine linearity in this larger setting. We have seen that some of our “vectors”
can themselves be functions, as in the case of the vector space
C
[0;
1] of continuous
functions on the interval
[0;
1]: In order to avoid confusion in cases like this, we prefer
to designate linear functions by the term linear operator. Other common terms for this
object are linear mapping or linear transformation.
Before giving the deﬁnition of linear operator, let us recall some notation that is associ-
ated with functions in general. We identify a function
f with the notation
f
:
D
!
T,
where
D and
T are the domain and target of the function, respectively. This means that
for each
x in the domain
D
; the value
f
(x) is a uniquely determined element in the
target
T
: We want to emphasize at the outset, that there is a difference here between the
target of a function and its range. The range of the function
f is deﬁned as the subset
of the target
range
(f
)
=
fy
j
y
=
f
(x) for some
x
2
D
g
which is just the set of all possible values of
f
(x): For example, we can deﬁne a function
f
:
R
!
R by the formula
f
(x)
=
x
2
: It follows from our speciﬁcation of
f that the
target of
f is understood to be
R, while the range of
f is the set of nonnegative real
numbers.
A function that maps elements of one vector space into another, say
f
:
V
!
W is
sometimes called an operator or transformation. For example, the operator
f
:
R
2
!

Notice in this example that the target of
f is
R
3, which is not the same as the range of
f
;
since elements in the range have nonnegative ﬁrst and third coordinates. From the point
of view of linear algebra, this function lacks the essential feature that makes it really
interesting, namely linearity.
DEFINITION 3.1.12. A function
T
:
V
!
W from the vector space
V into the space
W over the same ﬁeld of scalars is called a linear operator (mapping, transformation)
if, for all vectors
u;
v
2
V and scalars
c;
d, we have
T
(cu
+
dv
)
=
cT
(u)
+
dT
(v
)
By taking
c
=
d
=
1 in the deﬁnition, we see that a linear function
T is additive, that is,
T
(u
+
v
)
=
T
(u)
+
T
(v
): Also, by taking
d
=
0 in the deﬁnition, we see that a linear
function is outative, that is,
T
(cu)
=
cT
(u): As a matter of fact, these two conditions
imply the linearity property, and so are equivalent to it. We leave this fact as an exercise.
By repeated application of the linearity deﬁnition, we can extend the linearity property
to any linear combination of vectors, not just two terms. This means that for any scalars

SOLUTION. If
T is deﬁned by (a) then we show by a simple example that
T fails to be
linear. Let us calculate
T
((1;
0)
+
(0;
1))
=
T
((1;

=
(1;

((0;

=
(1;
0;
0)
+
(0;
0;

=
(1;

These two are not equal, so
T fails to satisfy the linearity property.
Next consider the operator
T deﬁned as in (b). Write
A

and
v

and we see that the action of
T can be given as
T
(v

=
Av
: Now we have already seen
in Section 2.3 of Chapter 2 that the operation of multiplication by a ﬁxed matrix is a
linear operator.
In Chapter 2 the following useful fact was shown, which we now restate for real vectors,
though it is equally valid for standard complex vectors.
THEOREM 3.1.14. Let
A be an
m

n matrix and deﬁne an operator
T
A

by the formula

: Then
T
A is a linear operator.

3. VECTOR SPACES
Abstraction gives us a nice framework for certain key properties of mathematical ob-
jects, some of which we have seen before. For example, in calculus we were taught that
differentiation has the “linearity property.” Now we can view this assertion in a fuller
context: let
V be the space of differentiable functions and deﬁne an operator
T on
V by
the rule
T
(f
(x))
=
f
0
(x): Then
T is a linear operator on the space

3.2. Subspaces
We now turn our attention to the concept of a subspace, which is a rich source of useful
examples of vector spaces. It frequently happens that a certain vector space of interest
is a subset of a larger, and possibly better understood vector space, and that the vector
operations are the same for both spaces. A good example of this situation is given by the
vector space
V of Example 3.1.8 which is a subset of the larger vector space
C
[0;
1] with
both spaces sharing the same deﬁnitions of vector addition and scalar multiplication.
Here is a precise deﬁnition for the subspace idea.
DEFINITION 3.2.1. A subspace of the vector space
V is a subset
W of
V such that
W,
together with the binary operations it inherits from
V , forms a vector space (over the
same ﬁeld of scalars as
V ) in its own right.
Given a subset
W of the vector space
V , we can apply the deﬁnition of vector space
directly to the subset
W to obtain the following very useful test.
THEOREM 3.2.2. Let
W be a subset of the vector space
V
: Then
W is a subspace of
V
if and only if

:

136
3. VECTOR SPACES
PROOF. Let
W be a subspace of the vector space
V
: Then the closure of addition
and scalar multiplication are automatically satisﬁed by the deﬁnition of vector space.
For condition 1, we note that
W must contain a zero element by deﬁnition of vector
space. Let
0
 be this element and
0 the zero element of
V , so that
0

+
0

=
0

: Add
the negative of
0
 (as an element of
V ) to both sides, cancel terms and we see that

0: This shows that
W satisﬁes condition 1.
Conversely, suppose that
W is a subset of
V satisfying the three conditions. Since the
operations of
W are those of the vector space
V , and
V is a vector space, most of
the laws for
W are automatic. Speciﬁcally, the laws of commutativity, associativity,
distributivity and the monoidal law hold for elements of
W
: The additive identity law
follows from condition 1.
The only law that needs any work is the additive inverse law. Let
w
2
W
: By closure of
scalar multiplication,
( 1)w is in
W
: By the laws of vector arithmetic in the preceding
section, this vector is simply
 w. This proves that every element of
W has an additive
inverse in
W
; which shows that
W is a subspace of
V
:
One notable point that comes out of the subspace test is that every subspace of
V con-
tains the zero vector. This is certainly not true of arbitrary subsets of
V and serves to
remind us that, although every subspace is a subset of
V
; not every subset is a subspace.
Confusing the two is a common mistake, so much so that we issue the following
Caution: Every subspace of a vector space is a subset, but not conversely.
EXAMPLE 3.2.3. Which of the following subsets of the standard vector space

SOLUTION. (a) Take

so that
w

W
1
: Next, check closure of
W
1 under addition. Let’s name two general
elements from
W
1, say
u
=
(x
1
;
y
1
;
z
1
) and
v
=
(x
2
;
y
2
;
z

): Then we know from
deﬁnition of
W

x

 2y
1
+
z
1
=
0
x
2
 2y
2

=

We want to show that
u

v
=

;
y

+
y

z

)

W

: So add the two
equations above and group terms to obtain

)
 2(y

y

)
+
(z

This equation shows that the coordinates of
u

v ﬁt the requirement for being an
element of

u

W

: Similarly, if
c is a scalar then we can multiply the
equation that says

z

This shows that the coordinates of
cv ﬁt the requirement for being in

1, i.e.,
cu
2
W
1
:
It follows that
W
1 is closed under both addition and scalar multiplication, so it is a
subspace of
R
3
:
(b) This one is easy. Any subspace must contain the zero vector
(0;
0;
0): Clearly
W
2
does not. Hence it cannot be a subspace. Another way to see it is to notice that closure
under scalar multiplication fails (try multiplying
(1;
1;
1) by
 1).
(c) The only possible choice for arbitrary elements
u;
v, in this space are
u
=
v
=
(0;
0;
0): But then we see that
W
3 obviously contains the zero vector and for any scalar
c
(0;
0;
0)
+
(0;
0;
0)
=
(0;
0;
0)
c(0;
0;
0)
=
(0;
0;
0)
Therefore
W
3 is a subspace of
V by the subspace test.
(d) First of all,
0
2
 0
=
0, which means that
(0;
0;
0)
2
W
4
: Likewise we see that
(1;

2
W
4 as well. But
(1;
1;
0)
+
(1;
1;
0)
=
(2;
2;
0) which is not an element of
W
4 since
2
2
 2
6=
0: Therefore, closure of addition fails and
W
4 is not a subspace of
V by the subspace test.
Part (c) of this example highlights part of a simple fact about vector spaces. Every vector
space
V must have at least two subspaces, namely,
f0g (where
0 is the zero vector in
V ) and
V itself. These are not terribly exciting subspaces, so they are commonly called
the trivial subspaces.
EXAMPLE 3.2.4. Show that the subset
P of
C
[0;
1] consisting of all polynomial func-
tions is a subspace of
C
[0;
1] and that the subset
P
n consisting of all polynomials of
degree at most
n is a subspace of
P
:
SOLUTION. Certainly
P is a subset of
C
[0;
1], since any polynomial is uniquely de-
termined by its values on the interval
[0;
1] and
P contains the zero constant function
which is a polynomial function. Let

which shows that
P is closed under function addition and scalar multiplication. By the
subspace test
P is a subspace of

the subset
P
n passes the subspace test, so it is a subspace of
C
[0;

EXAMPLE 3.2.5. Show that the set of all upper triangular matrices (see page 74) in the
vector space

:

3. VECTOR SPACES
SOLUTION. Since the zero matrix is upper triangular, the subset
W of all upper trian-
gular matrices contains the zero element of
V
: Let
A
=
[a
i;j
] and
B
=
[b
i;j
] be any two
matrices in
W and let
c be any scalar. By deﬁnition of upper triangular, we must have
a
i;j
=
0 and
b
i;j
=
0 if
i
>
j: However,
A
+
B
=
[a
i;j
+
b
i;j
]
cA
=
[ca
i;j
]:
and for
i
>
j we have
a
i;j
+
b
i;j
=
0
+
0
=
0 and
ca
i;j
=
c0
=
0, so that
A
+
B and
cA
are also upper triangular. It follows that
W is a subspace of
V by the subspace test.
There is an extremely useful type of subspace which requires the notion of a linear
combination of the vectors
v

v

;
:

v
n in the vector space
V : an expression of the

where

n are scalars. We can consider the set of all possible linear combi-
nations of a given list of vectors, which is what our next deﬁnition is about.
DEFINITION 3.2.6. Let
v
1
;
v
2
;
:
:
:
;
v
n be vectors in the vector space
V
: The span of
these vectors, denoted by
spanfv
1
;
v

;
:
:
:
;
v
n
g, is the subset of
V consisting of all
possible linear combinations of these vectors, i.e.,

Caution: The scalars we are using really make a difference. For example, if
v
1
=
(1;
0)
and
v
2
=
(0;
1) are viewed as elements of the real vector space
R
2, then
span
fv

;
v

g
=

=
f(c

;
c

)
j
c
1
;
c
2
2
Rg
=
R
2
Similarly, if we view
v
1 and
v
2 as elements of the complex vector space
C
2, then we see
that
span
fv
1
;
v
2
g
=
C
2
: Now
R
2 consists of those elements of
C
2 whose coordinates
have zero imaginary parts, so
R
2 is a subset of
C
2; but these are certainly not equal
sets. By the way,
R
2 is deﬁnitely not a subspace of
C
2 either, since the subset
R
2 is not
closed under multiplication by complex scalars.
We should take note here that the deﬁnition of span would work perfectly well with
inﬁnite sets, as long as we understand that linear combinations in the deﬁnition would
be ﬁnite and therefore not involve all the vectors in the span. A situation in which this
extension is needed is as follows: consider the space
P of all polynomials with the usual
addition and scalar multiplication. It makes perfectly good sense to write
P
=
span
f1;
x;
x
2
;
x
3
;
:
:
:
;
x
n
;
:

since every polynomial is a ﬁnite linear combination of various monomials
x

SOLUTION. Elements of
W
1 are simply scalar multiples of the single vector
(1;
1;
2):
The set of all such multiples gives us a line through the origin
(
0;
0;
0)
: On the other
hand, elements of
W
2 give all possible linear combinations of two vectors
(1;
1;
2) and
(2;
0;
0): The locus of points generated by these combinations is a plane in
R
3 contain-
ing the origin, so it is determined by the points with coordinates
(0;
0;
0);
(1;
1;
2); and
(2;
0;
0): See Figure 3.2.1 for a picture of these spans.
Spans are the premier examples of subspaces. In a certain sense, it can be said that every
subspace is the span of some of its vectors. The following important fact is a very nice
application of the subspace test.
THEOREM 3.2.8. Let

so that the theorem applies to these vectors. Put another way, if we enlarge the list of

In other words

Thus any element of

v

g belongs to

v

g, so the two spans are
equal. This is an algebraic representation of the geometric fact that the three vectors

;
v

;
v
3 belong to the same plane in
R
2 that is spanned by the two vectors
v

v

:
It seems reasonable that we should prefer the spanning set
v
1
;
v
2 to the set
v
1
;
v
2
;
v
3,
since the former is smaller yet carries just as much information as the latter. As a matter
of fact, we would get the same span if we used
v

v

v

v

: The spanning set
v

v

v

3.3. Linear Combinations
We have seen in Section 3.2 that linear combinations give us a rich source of subspaces
for a vector space. In this section we will take a closer look at properties of linear
combinations.

3.3. LINEAR COMBINATIONS
143
Linear Dependence
First we need to make precise the idea of redundant vectors that we encountered in
Example 3.2.10. About lists and sets: Lists involve an ordering of elements (they can
just as well be called ﬁnite sequences), while sets don’t really imply any ordering of
elements. Thus, every list of vectors, e.g.,
v
1
;
v
2
;
v
3, gives rise to a unique set of
vectors
fv
1
;
v
2
;
v
3
g: A different list
v
1
;
v
3
;
v
2 may deﬁne the same set
fv
1
;
v
3
;
v
2
g
=
fv
1
;
v
2
;
v
3
g: Lists can have repeats in them, while sets don’t. For instance, the list
v
1
;
v
2
;
v
1 deﬁnes the set
fv
1
;
v
2
g: The terminology “the vectors
v
1
;
v
2
;
v
3” really
means “the set or a list of vectors consisting of
v
1
;
v
2
;
v
3”; the deﬁnitions below work
perfectly well for either sets or lists.
DEFINITION 3.3.1. The vector
v
i is redundant in the vectors
v
1
;
v
2;
:
:
:
;
v
n if the lin-
ear span
V
=
spanfv
1
;
v
2;
:
:
:
;
v
n
g does not change when
v
i is removed.
EXAMPLE 3.3.2. Which vectors are redundant in the set consisting of
v
1


;
v
2
=

1
1

;
v
3
=

1
2

?
SOLUTION. As in Example 3.2.10, we notice that
v
3
=
( 1)v
1
+
2v
2
Thus any linear combination involving
v
3 can be expressed in terms of
v
1 and
v
2
:
Therefore,
v
3 is redundant in the list
v
1
;
v
2
;
v
3
: But there is more going on here. Let’s
write the equation above in a form that doesn’t single out any one vector:
0
=
( 1)v
1
+
2v
2
+
( 1)v
3
Now we see that we could solve for any of
v
1
;
v
2
;
v
3 in terms of the remaining two
vectors. Therefore, each of these vectors is redundant in the set. However, this doesn’t
mean that we can discard all three and get the same linear span. This is obviously false.
What we can do is discard any one of them, then start over and examine the remaining
set for redundant vectors.
This example shows that what really counts for redundancy is that the vector in question
occur with a nonzero coefﬁcient in a linear combination that equals
0: This situation
warrants its own name:
DEFINITION 3.3.3. The vectors
v
1
;v
2
;
:
:
:
;v
n are said to be linearly dependent if
Linearly
Dependant or
Independent
Vectors
there exist scalars
c

c

;
c
n, not all zero, such that

+
c
2
v

+



+
c
n
v
n
=

(3.3.1)
If these vectors are not linearly dependent, i.e., no nontrivial linear combination of them
is equal to zero, then they are called linearly independent.
For convenience, we will call a linear combination trivial if it equals
0: Just as with re-
dundancy, linear dependence or independence is a property of the list or set in question,
not of the individual vectors. We are going to connect the ideas of linear dependence
and redundancy. Here is the key fact.

144
3. VECTOR SPACES
THEOREM 3.3.4. The list of vectors
v
1
;
v
2;
:
:
:
;
v
n of a vector space has redundant
Redundancy
Test
vectors if and only if it is linearly dependent, in which case the redundant vectors are
those that occur with nonzero coefﬁcient in some linear combination that sums to zero.
PROOF. Observe that if (3.3.1) holds and some scalar, say
c
1, is nonzero, then we
can use the equation to solve for
v
1 as a linear combination of the remaining vectors:
v
1
=
 1
c
1
(c
2
v
2
+
c
3
v
3
+



+
c
n
v
n
)
Thus we see that any linear combination involving
v
1
;
v
2;
:
:
:
;
v
n can be expressed
using only
v
2
;
v
3;
:
:
:
;
v
n
: It follows that
span
fv
2
;
v
3;
:
:
:
;
v
n
g
=
span
fv
1
;
v
2;
:
:
:
;
v
n
g
Conversely, if these spans are equal then
v
1 belongs to the left hand side, so there are
scalars
d
2
;
d
3;
:
:
:
;
d
n such that
v
1
=
d
2
v
2
+
d
3
v
3
+



+
d

v

Now bring all terms to the right hand side and obtain the nontrivial linear combination
 v

2
v
2
+
d
3
v
3
+



+
d
n
v
n
=
0
All of this works equally well for any index other than
1 so the theorem is proved.
It is instructive to examine the simple case of two vectors
v
1
;
v
2
: What does it mean
to say that these vectors are linearly dependent? Simply that one of the vectors can be
expressed in terms of the other. In other words, that each vector is a scalar multiple
of the other. However, matters are more complex when we proceed to three or more
vectors, a point that is often overlooked. So we issue a warning here.
Caution: If we know that
v
1
;
v
2;
:
:
:
;
v
n is linearly dependent, it does not necessarily
imply that one of these vectors is a multiple of one of the others unless
n
=
2: In
general, all we can say is that one of these vectors is a linear combination of the others.

SOLUTION. Consider the vectors in each list to be designated as
v
1
;
v
2
;
v
3
: Let’s try to
see the big picture. The general linear combination can be written as
c

v

c

v

] and
c
=
(c

;
c
2
;
c
3
): Now we see that a nontrivial linear com-
bination that adds up to
0 amounts to a nontrivial solution to the homogeneous equation
Ac
=

so that the solutions to the homogeneous system are
c
=
( c

c

)
=
c
3
( 1;

Take
c
3
=
1 and we have that
 1v

+
2v
2
+
1v
3
=

which shows that
v
1

v

v
3 is a linearly dependent list of vectors.
We’ll solve (b) by a different method. Notice that

=
 1:
It follows that
A is nonsingular, so the only solution to the system
Ac
=
0 is
c
=
0:
Since every linear combination of the columns of
A takes the form
Ac; the vectors
v
1
;
v
2
;
v
3 must be linearly independent.
Finally, we see by inspection in (c) that since
v
3 is a repeat of
v
1, the linear combination
v
1
+
0v
2
 v
3
=
0:
Thus, this list of vectors is linearly dependent. Notice, by the way, that not every coef-
ﬁcient
c
i has to be nonzero.
EXAMPLE 3.3.6. Show that any list of vectors that contains the zero vector is linearly
dependent.
SOLUTION. Let
v
1
;
v
2
;
:
:
:
;
v
n be such a list and suppose that for some index
j,
v
j
=
0: Examine the following linear combination which clearly sums to

This linear combination is nontrivial because the coefﬁcient of the vector
v
j is
1: There-
fore this list is linearly dependent by deﬁnition of dependence.
The Basis Idea
We are now ready for one of the big ideas of vector space theory, the notion of a basis.
We already know what a spanning set for a vector space
V is. This is a set of vec-
tors
v
1
;
v
2
;
:
:
:
;
v
n such that
V
=
span
fv
1
;
v
2
;
:
:
:
;
v
n
g: However, we saw back in
Example 3.2.10 that some spanning sets are better than others because they are more
economical. We know that a set of vectors has no redundant vectors in it if and only if it
is linearly independent. This observation is the inspiration for the following deﬁnition.
DEFINITION 3.3.7. A basis for the vector space
V is a spanning set of vectors
v
1
;
v
2
;
:
:
:
;
v
nwhich is a linearly independent set.
We should take note here that we could have just as well deﬁned a basis as a mini-
mal spanning set, by which we mean a spanning set such that any proper subset is not
spanning set. The proof that this is equivalent to our deﬁnition of basis is left as an
exercise.
Usually we think of a basis as a set of vectors and the order in which we list them
is convenient but not important. Occasionally, ordering is important. In such a situa-
tion we speak of an ordered basis of
v by which we mean a spanning list of vectors
v
1
;
v
2
;
:
:
:
;
v
n which is a linearly independent list.

g yield bases

R
2?
SOLUTION. These are just the vectors of Example 3.2.10 and Example 3.3.2. Referring
back to that Example, we saw that
 v
1
+
2v
2
 v
3
=
0
which told us that we could remove any one of these vectors and get the same span.
Moreover, we saw that these three vectors span
R
2, so the same is true of any two of
them. Clearly, a single vector cannot span
R
2 since the span of a single vector is a line
through the origin. Therefore, the subsets
fv
1
;
v
2
g,
fv
2
;
v
3
g and
fv
1
;
v

g are all bases
of
R
2
:
An extremely important generic type of basis is provided by the columns of the identity
matrix. For future reference, we establish this notation.

: Up to this point, this is
the only sense in which we have used the term “coordinates.” We can see that these
coordinates are strongly tied to the standard basis. Yet
R
3 has many bases. Is there a

147
corresponding notion of “coordinates” relative to other bases? The answer is a deﬁnite
“yes,” thanks to the following fact.

In view of this fact, we may speak of coordinates of a vector relative to a basis. Here is
the notation that we employ:
DEFINITION 3.3.12. If
v
1
;
v
2
;
:
:
:
;
v
n is a basis of the vector space
V and
v

V with
v

n, then the scalars
c
1
;
c

;
:
:
:
;
c
n are called the coordinates
of
v with respect to the basis
v
1
;
v
2
;
:
:
:
;
v
n.
As we have noted, coordinates of a vector with respect to the standard basis are what
we have referred to as “coordinates” so far in this text. Perhaps we should call these the
standard coordinates of a vector, but we will usually stick with the convention that an
unqualiﬁed reference to a vectors coordinates assumes we mean standard coordinates.
Normally vectors in
R
n are given explicitly in terms of their standard coordinates, so
these are trivial to identify. Coordinates with respect to other bases are fairly easy to
calculate if we have enough information about the structure of the vector space.
EXAMPLE 3.3.13. The following vectors form a basis of
R
3:
v
1
=
(1;
1;
0),
v
2
=
(0;
2;
2) and
v
3
=
(1;
0;
1): Find the coordinates of
v
=
(2;
1;
5) with respect to this
basis.
SOLUTION. Notice that the basis
v

v

This is a straightforward system of equations with coefﬁcient matrix

and right hand side

It does not prove that
v
=
( 1;

3), which is plainly false. Only in the case of the
standard basis can we expect that a vector actually equals its vector of coordinates with
respect to the basis.
In general, vectors
v

v

;
:
:
:
;
v
n

R
n are linearly independent if and only if the
system
Ac
=
0 has only the trivial solution, where
A
=
[v
1
;
v
2
;
:
:
:
;
v
n
]: This in turn is
equivalent to the matrix
A being of full column rank
n (see Theorem 2.5.9 of Chapter 2
where we see that these are equivalent conditions for a matrix to be invertible). We can
see how this idea can be extended, and doing so tells us something remarkable. Let
v
1
;
v
2
;
:
:
:
;
v
k be a basis of
V
=
R
n and form the
n

k matrix
A
=
[v
1
;
v
2
;
:
:
:
;
v
k
]:
By the same reasoning as in the example, for any
b
2
V there is a unique solution to
the system
Ax
=
b: In view of the Rank Theorem of Chapter 1 we see that
A has full
column rank. Therefore,
k

n: On the other hand, we can take
b to be any one of
the standard basis vectors
e
j,
j
=
1;
2;
:
:
:
;
n, solve the resulting systems and stack the
solutions vectors together to obtain a solution to the system
AX
=
I
n
: From our rank
inequalities, we see that
n
=
rank
I
n
=
rank
AX

rank
A
=
n
What this shows is that
k
=
n; that is, every basis of
R
n has exactly
n elements in it.
Does this idea extend to abstract vector spaces? Indeed it does, and we shall return to
this issue in Section 3.5.
We are going to visit a problem which comes to us straight from calculus and analytical
geometry (classiﬁcation of conics) and show how the matrix and coordinate tools we
have developed can shed light on this problem.
EXAMPLE 3.3.14. Suppose we want to understand the character of the graph of the
curve

 xy

=

variables by rotating the
xy-axis by

=4 to get a new
x
0
y
0-axis, the graph will become
more intelligible. OK, we do it. The algebraic connection between the variables
x;
y
and
x
0

y
0, resulting from a rotation of

(which we omit) to yield

We might recognize
G(
) as the Givens matrix introduced in Exericse x. This matrix
isn’t exactly what we need for substitution into our curve equation. Rather, we need
x;
y
explicitly. That’s easy enough. Simply invert
G(
) to obtain the rotation matrix
R

)
as
G(

so that

This curve is simply an ellipse with axes

x

y
0-axes, this
ellipse is in so-called “standard form.” For a graph of the ellipse, see Figure 3.3.1.
The change of variables we have just seen can be interpreted as a change of coordinates
in the following sense. Notice that the variables
x and
y are just the standard coordinates

The meaning of the variables
x
0 and

x
0
=
(x
0
;
y
0
) and
write the matrix equation
x
=
R
(
)x
0 out in detail as a linear combination of the
columns of
R
(
):
x

R

u

+

Thus the numbers
x
0 and
y
0 are just the coordinates of the vector
x with respect to a new
basis
u
1
;
u
2 of
R
2. This basis consists of unit vectors in the direction of the
x
0 and
y
0
axes. See Figure 3.3.1 for a picture of the two bases. Thus we see that the matrix
R
(
)
could reasonably be called a change of coordinates matrix or, as it is more commonly
called, a change of basis matrix. Indeed, we can see from this example that the change
of variables we encountered is nothing more than a change from one basis (the standard
one,
e
1
;
e
2) to another (u
1
;
u
2). The reason for a change of basis is that sometimes a
problem looks a lot easier if we look at it using a basis other than the standard one, such
as in our example. The concept of change of basis is explored in more generality in
Section 3.7.

3.4. Subspaces Associated with Matrices and Operators
Certain subspaces are a rich source of information about the behavior of a matrix or
a linear operator. We will deﬁne and explore the properties of these subspaces in this
section.
Subspaces Deﬁned by Matrices
Suppose we are given a matrix A. There are three very useful subspaces that can be
associated with the matrix
A: Understanding these subspaces is a great aid in vector
space calculations that might have nothing to do with matrices per se, such as the deter-
mination of a minimal spanning set for a vector space. We shall follow each deﬁnition
below by an illustration using the following example matrix.
A
=

(3.4.1)
We make the default assumption that the scalars are the real numbers, but the deﬁnitions
we will give can be stated just as easily for the complex numbers.

3.4. SUBSPACES ASSOCIATED WITH MATRICES AND OPERATORS
153
DEFINITION 3.4.1. The column space of the
m

n matrix
A is the subspace
C
(A) of
Column Space
R
m spanned by the columns of
A.
EXAMPLE 3.4.2. Describe the column space of the matrix
A in Equation 3.4.1

Technically, this describes the column space in question, but we can do much better. We
saw in Example 3.2.10 that the vector

1
2

was really redundant since it is a linear
combination of the ﬁrst two vectors. We also see that

 1


=



0

+
1

1

C

=

f



;



g
This description is much better, in that it exhibits a basis of
C
(A):
This example shows that not all the columns of the matrix
A are really needed to span
the entire subspace
C
(A): Clearly, this last expression for
C
(A) is much more econom-
ical than the ﬁrst. How do you think it compares to the containing space
R
2?
DEFINITION 3.4.3. The row space of the
m

n matrix
A is the subspace
R(A) of
R
n
spanned by the transposes of the rows of
A:
The “transpose” part of the preceding deﬁnition seems a bit odd. Why would we want
rows to look like columns? It’s a technicality, but later it will be convenient for us
to have the row spaces live inside a
R
n instead of an
(R
n
)
T
: Remember, we had to
make a choice about
R
n consisting of rows or columns. Just to make the elements of a
row space look like rows, we can always adhere to the tuple notation instead of matrix
notation.
EXAMPLE 3.4.4. Describe the row space of
A in Equation 3.4.1
SOLUTION. We have from deﬁnition that
R(A)
=
spanf(1;
1;
1;
 1);
(0;


R

Now it’s easy to see that neither one of these vectors can be expressed as a multiple
of the other (if we had
c(1;
1;
1;
 1)
=
(0;
1;
2;
1), then read the ﬁrst coordinates and
obtain
c
=
0), so that span is given as economically as we can do, that is, the two vectors
listed constitute a basis of
R(A):

3. VECTOR SPACES
Observe that
N
(A) is the solution set to the homogeneous linear system
Ax
=
0: This
means that null spaces are really very familiar. We were computing these solution sets
back in Chapter 1. We didn’t call them subspaces at the time. Here is an application
of this concept. Let
A be a square matrix. We know that
A is invertible exactly when
the system
Ax
=
0 has only the trivial solution (see Theorem 2.5.9). Now we can
add one more equivalent condition to the long list of equivalences for invertibility:
A is
invertible exactly when
N
(A)
=
f0g: Let us next justify the subspace property implied
by the term “null space.”
EXAMPLE 3.4.6. Use the subspace test to verify that
N
(A) really is a subspace of
R
n
:
SOLUTION. Since
A0
=
0, the zero vector is in
N
(A). Now let
c be a scalar and
u;
v
2
R
n arbitrary elements of
N
(A): By deﬁnition,
Au
=
0 and
Av
=
0: Add these
two equations to obtain that
0
=
0
+
0
=
Au
+
Av
=
A(u
+
v
)
Therefore
u
+
v
2
N
(A): Next multiply the equation
Au
=
0 by the scalar
c to obtain
0
=
c0
=
c(Au)
=
A(cu)
Thus we see from that deﬁnition that
cu
2
N
(A): The subspace test implies that
N
(A)
is a subspace of
R
n
:
EXAMPLE 3.4.7. Describe the null space of the matrix
A of Equation 3.4.1.
SOLUTION. Proceed as in Chapter 1. We ﬁnd the reduced row echelon form of
A,

hand side and solution vector

This is really a wonderful trick! Remember that free variables can take on arbitrary

3.4. SUBSPACES ASSOCIATED WITH MATRICES AND OPERATORS
155
Neither of these vectors is a multiple of the other, so this is as economical an expression
for
N
(A) as we can hope for. In other words, we have exhibited a minimal spanning
set, that is, a basis of
N
(A).

Further, suppose these vectors converge to some limiting vector
x: What could the lim-
iting vector be? (This example relates null spaces to the idea of a limiting state for a
Markov chain as discussed in Example 2.3.4 of Chapter 2.)
SOLUTION. We reason as follows: since the limit of the sequence is
x, we can take the
limits of both sides of the matrix equation above and obtain that
x
=
Ax
=
I
x
so that
0

Therefore the null space of

4=3;
1): In particular,
any multiple of this vector qualiﬁes as a possible limiting vector. If we want a limiting
vector whose entries are nonnegative and sum to
1, then the only choice is the vector
resulting from dividing
(4=3;

(3=7)(4=3;

(4=7;

(0:57143;

:
Interestingly enough, this is the vector that resulted from the calculation on page 66.
An important point that comes out of the previous examples is that we can express a null
space as a simple linear span by using the methods for system solving we developed in
Chapter 1, together with a little algebra.
We conclude this excursion on subspaces with an extremely powerful way of thinking
about the product
Ax; which was ﬁrst introduced in Example 2.2.6 of Chapter 2. We
shall use this idea often.

A can be thought of as the set
of all possible matrix products
Ax, i.e.,
C

=
fAx

R

g
Furthermore, the coefﬁcients of a linear combination
Ax are precisely the entries of the
vector
x: Two important insights follow from these observations: ﬁrstly, we see that the
linear system
Ax
=
b is consistent exactly when
b
2
C
(A): Secondly, we see that the
linear combination of columns of
A with coefﬁcients from the vector
x is trivial, i.e.,
the combination sums to the zero vector, exactly when
x

N

Notice that the linear combination of the previous example is not trivial, i.e., does not

3.4. SUBSPACES ASSOCIATED WITH MATRICES AND OPERATORS
157
Subspaces Deﬁned by a Linear Operator
Suppose we are given a linear operator
T
:
V
!
W
: We immediately have three
spaces we can associate with the operator, namely, the domain
V
; target
W and range
range
(T
)
=
fy
j
y
=
T
(x) for some
x
2
V
g of the operator. The domain and range
are vector spaces by deﬁnition of linear operator. That that range is a vector space is a
nice example of using the subspace test.
EXAMPLE 3.4.11. Show that if
T
:
V
!
W is a linear operator, then
range
(T
) is a
subspace of
W
:
SOLUTION. Apply the subspace test. First, we observe that
range
(T
) contains
T
(0):
We leave it as an exercise for the reader to check that
T
(0) is the zero element of
W
:
Next let
y and
z be in
range
(T
); say
y
=
T
(u) and
z
=
T
(v
): We show closure of
range
(T
) under addition: by the linearity property of
T
y
+
z
=
T
(u)
+
T
(v
)
=
T
(u
+
v
)
2
range
(T
)
where the latter term belongs to
range
(T
) by deﬁnition of image. Finally, we show
closure under scalar multiplication: let
c be a scalar and we obtain from the linearity
property of
T that
cy
=
cT
(u)
=
T
(cu)
2
range
(T
)
where the latter term belongs to
range
(T
) by deﬁnition of range. Thus, the subspace
test shows that
range
(T
) is a subspace of
W
:
Here is another space that has proven to be very useful in understanding the nature of a
linear operator.
DEFINITION 3.4.12. The kernel of the linear operator
T
:
V
!
W is the subspace of
V given by
k
er
(T
)
=
fx
2
V
j
T
(x)
=
0g
The deﬁnition claims that the kernel is a subspace and not merely a subset of the domain.
The proof of this is left to the exercises. The fact is that we have been computing kernels
since the beginning of the text. To see this, suppose that we have a linear transformation
T
:
R
n
!
R
m given by matrix multiplication, that is,
T
A
(x)
=
Ax; for all
x
2
R
n
:
Then
k
er
(T
)
=
fx
2
R
n
j
T
A
(x)
=
0g
=
fx
2
R
n
j
Ax
=
0g
=
N
(A)
In other words, for matrix multiplications kernels are the same thing as null spaces.
Here is one really nice application of kernels. Suppose we are interested in knowing
whether or not a given operator
T
:
V
!
W is one-to-one, i.e., if the equation
T
(u)
=
T
(v
) necessarily implies that
u
=
v
: In general, this is a nontrivial question. If, for
example,
V
=
W
=
R, then we could graph the function
T and try to determine if a
horizontal line cut the graph twice. But for linear operators, the answer is much simpler:

158
3. VECTOR SPACES
THEOREM 3.4.13. If
T
:
V
!
W is a linear operator, then
T is one-to-one if and only
if
k
er
(T
)
=
f0g:
PROOF. If
T is one-to-one, then only one element can map to
0 under
T
: Thus,
k
er
(T
) can consist of only one element. However, we know that
k
er
(T
) contains the
zero vector since it is a subspace of the domain of
T
: Therefore,
k
er
(T
)
=
f0g:
Conversely, suppose that
k
er
(T
)
=
f0g: If
u and
v are such that
T
(u)
=
T
(v
); then
subtract terms and use the linearity of
T to obtain that
0
=
T
(u)
 T
(v
)
=
T
(u)
+
( 1)T
(v
)
=
T
(u
 v
):
It follows that
u
 v
2
k
er
(T
)
=
f0g: Therefore,
u
 v
=
0 and hence
u
=
v
:
Before we leave the topic of one-to-one linear mappings, let’s digest its signiﬁcance
in a very concrete case. The space
P
2
=
spanf1;
x;
x
2
gof polynomials of degree at
most
2 has a basis of three elements, like
R
3 and it seems very reasonable to think that
P
2 is “just like”
R
3 in that a polynomial
p(x)
=
a
+
bx
+
cx
2 is uniquely described
by its vector of coefﬁcients
(a;
b;
c)
2
R
3 and corresponding polynomials and vectors
add and scalar multiply in a corresponding way. Here is the precise version of these
musings: deﬁne an operator
T
:
P
2
!
R
3 by the formula
T
(a
+
bx
+
cx
2
)
=
(a;
b;
c):
One can check that
T is linear, the range of
T is its target,
R
3, and
k
er
(T
)
=
0: By
Theorem 3.4.13 the function
T is one-to-one and maps its domain onto its target. Hence,
it describes a one-to-one correspondence between elements of
P
2 and elements of
R
3
such that sums and scalar products in one space correspond to the corresponding sums
and scalar products in the other. In plain words, this means we can get one of the vector
spaces from the other simply by relabelling elements of one of the spaces. So, in a
very real sense, they are “the same thing.” More generally, whenever there is a one-to-
one linear mapping of one vector space onto another, we say the two vector spaces are
isomorphic, which is a fancy way of saying that they are the same, up to a relabelling of
elements. A one-to-one and onto linear mapping, like our
T, is called an isomorphism.
In summary, there are four important subspaces associated with a linear operator, the
domain, target, kernel and range. In symbols
domain(T
)
=
V
target

)

There are important connections between these subspaces and those associated with a
matrix. Let

deﬁned by matrix multiplication by

3.4. SUBSPACES ASSOCIATED WITH MATRICES AND OPERATORS
159
The proofs of these are left to the exercises. One last example of subspaces associated
with a linear operator
T
:
V
!
W is really a whole family of subspaces. Suppose that
U is a subspace of the domain
V
: Then we deﬁne the image of
U under
T to be the set
T
(U
)
=
fT
(u)
j
u

U
g
Interestingly enough,
T
(U
) is always a subspace of
range
(T
). We leave the proof of
this fact as an exercise. In words, what it says is that a linear operator maps subspaces
of its domain into subspaces of its range.

word precise. Intuitively, it makes sense when we say that
R
2 is “two dimensional”
or that
R
3 is “three dimensional”: we reason that it takes two coordinate numbers to
determine a vector in
R
2 and three for a vector in
R
3
: What can we say about general
vector spaces? Is there some number that is a measure of the size of the vector space?
These are questions we propose to answer in this section. In the familiar cases of geo-
metrical vector spaces, the answers will merely conﬁrm our intuition. The answers will
also enable us to solve this kind of problem, which is a bit more subtle: suppose we
solve a linear system of
5 equations in
10 unknowns and obtain through Gauss-Jordan
elimination a solution that involves
4 free variables, which means that we can express
all
10 unknowns in terms of these
4 free variables. Is it somehow possible, perhaps by
using a totally different method of system solving, to arrive at a similar kind of solution
that involves fewer free variables, say
3? This would, in effect, reduce the “degrees of
freedom” of the system.
We aren’t going to answer this question just yet. This example is rather vague; nonethe-
less, our intuition might suggest that if the free variables really are independent, we

3.5. BASES AND DIMENSION
161
shouldn’t be able to reduce their number. Therefore the answer to the question of this
example should be “no.” What we are really asking is a question about the nature of the
solution set of the system. As a matter of fact, our intuition is correct. Reasons for this
answer will be developed in this section.
The Basis Theorem
We now know that the standard vector spaces always have a basis. Given an abstract
vector space
V , can we be sure that a basis for
V exists? For the type of vector spaces
that we introduced in Section 1, that is, subspaces of the standard vector spaces, we
will see that the answer is an unconditional “yes.” For the more general concept of an
abstract vector space the answer is “sometimes.” The following concept turns out to be
helpful.
DEFINITION 3.5.1. The vector space
V is called ﬁnite dimensional if there is a ﬁnite
Finite
Dimensional
Vector Space
set of vectors
fv
1
;v
2
;
:
:
:
;v
n
g which is a spanning set for
V
:
Examples of ﬁnite dimensional vector spaces are the standard spaces
R
n or
C
n
: As a
matter of fact, we will see shortly that every subspace of a ﬁnite dimensional vector
space is ﬁnite dimensional, which includes most of the vector spaces we have studied
so far. However, some very important vector spaces are not ﬁnite dimensional, and
accordingly, we call them inﬁnite dimensional spaces. Here is an example.
EXAMPLE 3.5.2. Show that the space of all polynomial functions
P is not a ﬁnite di-
mensional space, while the subspaces
P
n are ﬁnite dimensional.
SOLUTION. If
P were a ﬁnite dimensional space, then there would be a ﬁnite spanning
set of polynomials
p
1
(x);
p
2
(x);
:
:
:
;
p
m
(x) for
P
: This means that any other polyno-
mial could be expressed as a linear combination of these polynomials. Let
m be the
maximum of all the degrees of the polynomials
p
j
(x): Notice that any linear combina-
tion of polynomials of degree at most
m must itself be a polynomial of degree at most
m:
(Remember that polynomial multiplication plays no part here, only addition and scalar
multiplication.) Therefore, it is not possible to express the polynomial
q
(x)
=
x
m+1
as a linear combination of these polynomials, which means that they cannot be a basis.
Hence, the space
P has no ﬁnite spanning set.
On the other hand, it is obvious that the polynomial
p(x)
=
a
0
+
a
1
x
+



+
a
n
x
n
is a linear combination of the monomials
1;
x;
:
:
:
;
x
n from which it follows that
P
n is
a ﬁnite dimensional space.
Here is the ﬁrst basic result about these spaces. It is simply a formalization of what we
have already done with preceding examples.
THEOREM 3.5.3. Every ﬁnite dimensional vector space has a basis.
Basis Theorem
PROOF. To see this, suppose that
V is a ﬁnite dimensional vector space with
V
=

fv

;
v

3. VECTOR SPACES
Now if the set
fv
1
;
v
2
;
:
:
:
;
v
n
g has a redundant vector in it, discard it and obtain a
smaller spanning set of
V
: Continue discarding vectors until you reach a spanning set
for
V that has no redundant vectors in it. (Since you start with a ﬁnite set, this can’t go
on indeﬁnitely.) By the redundancy test, this spanning set must be linearly independent.
Hence it is a basis of
V
:
The Dimension Theorem
No doubt you have already noticed that every basis of the vector space
R
2 must have
exactly two elements in it. Similarly, one can reason geometrically that any basis of
R
3
must consist of exactly three elements. These numbers somehow measure the “size”
of the space in terms of the degrees of freedom (number of coordinates) one needs to
describe a general vector in the space. The content of the dimension theorem is that
this number can be unambiguously deﬁned. First, we need a very handy theorem which
is sometimes called the Steinitz substitution principle. This principle is a mouthful to
swallow, so we will precede its statement with an example that illustrates the basic idea.
EXAMPLE 3.5.4. Let
w
1
=
(1;
 1;
0);
w
2
=
(0;
 1;
1);
v
1
=
(0;
1;
0);
v
2
=
(1;
1;
0);
v
3
=
(0;
1;
1): Then
w
1
;
w
2 form a linearly independent set and
v
1
;
v
2
;
v
3 form a
basis of
V
=
R
3 (assume this). Show how to substitute both
w
1 and
w
2 into the set
v
1
;
v
2
;
v
3 while substituting out some of the
v
j and at the same time retaining the basis
property of the set.
SOLUTION. Since
R
3
=
span
fv
1
;
v
2
;
v
3
g, we can express
w
1 as a linear combination
of these vectors. We have a formal procedure for ﬁnding such combinations, but in this
case we don’t have to work too hard. A little trial and error shows
w

so that

v
1 or
v
2 is redundant in the set
w
1
;
v
1
;
v
2
;
v
3
: So discard, say,
v
2, and obtain a spanning set
w
1
;
v
1
;
v
3
: In fact, it is
actually a basis of
V since two vectors can only span a plane. Now start over: express
w
2 as a linear combination of this new basis. Again, a little trial and error shows
w

Therefore
v

w

v

;
v
3
: So discard, say,
v
3, and
obtain a spanning set
w
1
;
w
2
;
v

: Again, this set is actually a basis of
V since two
vectors can only span a plane; and this is the kind of set we were looking for.

otherwise a proper subset of the

test to discard, one at a time, as many of the

all the while preserving the span. Again relabel the

Could this
set be linearly dependent? If so, there must be some equation of linear dependence
among the vectors such that none of the vectors
v
j occurs with a nonzero coefﬁ-
cient; otherwise, according to the redundancy test, such a
v
j could be discarded and
the span preserved. Therefore, there is an equation of dependency involving only the
w
j’s.
This means that the vectors
w

w

contrary to hypothesis. Hence, there is no such linear combination and the vectors

Remember that a vector space always carries a ﬁeld of scalars with it. If we are con-
cerned about that ﬁeld we could specify it explicitly as part of the dimension notation.
For instance, we could write
dim
R
n
=
dim
R
R
n or
dim
C
n
=
dim
C
C

:
Usually, the ﬁeld of scalars is clear and we don’t need the subscript notation.

3. VECTOR SPACES
As a ﬁrst application, let’s dispose of the standard spaces. We already know from Ex-
ample 3.3.10 that these vector spaces have a basis consisting of
n elements, namely the
standard basis
e
1
;
e
2
;
:
:
:
;
e
n
: According to the dimension theorem, this is all we need
to specify dimension of these spaces.
COROLLARY 3.5.7. For the standard spaces we have
dim
R
n
=
n
dim
C
n
=
n
There is one more question we want to answer right away. How do dimensions of a ﬁnite
dimensional vector space
V and a subspace
W of
V relate to each other? Actually, we
don’t even know if
W is ﬁnite dimensional. Our intuition tells us that subspaces should
have smaller dimension. Sure enough, our intuition is right this time! The tool that we
use to conﬁrm this fact is useful in its own right.
COROLLARY 3.5.8. If
W is a subspace of the ﬁnite dimensional vector space
V , then
W is also ﬁnite dimensional and
dim
W

dim
V
with equality if and only if
V
=
W
:
PROOF. Let
w
1
;
w
2
;
:
:
:
;
w
r be a linearly independent set in
W and suppose that
dim
V
=
n: According to the Steinitz substitution principle,
r

n: So there is an
upper bound on the number of elements of a linearly independent set in
W
: Now if
we had that the span of
w
1
;
w
2
;
:
:
:
;
w
r is smaller than
W, then we could ﬁnd a vec-
tor
w

W but not in

w
1
;
w

;
:
:
:
;
w

;
w

would also be linearly independent (we leave this as an exercise). Since we cannot
continue adding vectors indeﬁnitely, we have to conclude that at some point we obtain
a basis
w
1
;
w
2
;
:
:
:
;
w
sfor
W
: Furthermore,
s

n, so we conclude that
W is ﬁnite
dimensional and
dim
W

dim
V
: Finally, if we had equality, then a basis of
W would
be the same size as a basis of
V
: However, Steinitz substitution ensures that any linearly
independent set can be expanded to a basis of
V
: It follows that a basis for
W is also a
basis for
V , whence
W
=
V

3.6. Linear Systems Revisited
We now have some very powerful tools for understanding the nature of solution sets of
the standard linear system
Ax
=
b: This understanding will help us design practical
computational methods for ﬁnding dimension and bases for vector spaces and other
problems as well.
The ﬁrst business at hand is to describe solution sets of non-homogeneous systems.
Recall that every homogeneous system is consistent since it has the trivial solution.
Nonhomogeneous systems are another matter. We already have one criterion, namely
that rank of augmented matrix and coefﬁcient matrix of the system must agree. Here is
one more way to view the consistency of such a system in the language of vector spaces.
THEOREM 3.6.1. The linear system
Ax
=
b of
m equations in
n unknowns is consis-
Consistency in
Terms of

tent if and only if
b

C
(A):
PROOF. The key to this fact is Theorem 3.4.9, which says that the vector
Ax is
a linear combination of the columns of
A with the entries of
x as scalar coefﬁcients.
Therefore, to say that
Ax
=
b has a solution is simply to say that some linear combi-
nation of columns of
A adds up to
b, i.e.,
b

u
=
(2;

w
=

SOLUTION. Theorem 3.6.1 tells us that if
A
=
[v

;
v
2
;
v

], then we need only deter-
mine whether or not the systems

Observe that there is a pivot in the ﬁfth column but not in the fourth column. This
tells us that the system with augmented matrix
[A

with augmented matrix
[A

where
c
3 is an arbitrary scalar. The reason for the non-uniqueness of the coordinates of
u is that the vectors
v
1
;
v
2
;
v
3 are not linearly independent.
The next matter of business is a description of the solution space itself, given that it
is not empty. We already have a pretty good conceptual model for the solution of a
homogeneous system
Ax
=
0: Remember that this is just the null space,
N
(A), of the
matrix
A: In fact, the deﬁnition of
N
(A) is the set of vectors
x such that
Ax
=
0: The
important point here is that we proved that
N
(A) really is a subspace of the appropriate
n dimensional standard space
R
n or
C
n
: As such we can really picture it when
n is
2 or
3:
N
(A) is either the origin, a line through the origin, a plane through the origin, or in
the case
A
=
0; all of
R
3
: What can we say about a non-homogeneous system? Here is
a handy way of understanding these solution sets.
THEOREM 3.6.3.
Suppose the system
Ax
=
b is consistent with a particular solution
Form of
General
Solution
x
0
: Then the general solution
x to this system can be described by the equation
x
=
x
0
+
z
where
z runs over all elements of
N
(A):
PROOF. On the one hand, suppose we are given a vector of the form
x
=
x
0
+
z,
where
Ax
0
=
b and
z
2
N
(A): Then
Ax
=
A(x
0
+
z)
=
Ax
0
+
Az
=
b
+
0
=
b:
Thus
x is a solution to the system. Conversely, suppose we are given any solution
x to
the system and that
x
0 is a particular solution to the system. Then
A(x
 x
0
)
=
Ax
 Ax
0
=
b
 b
=
0
It follows that
x
 x
0
=
z
2
N
(A) so that
x has the required form
x
0
+
z:
This is really a pretty fact, so let’s be clear about what it is telling us. It says that the
solution space to a consistent system, as a set, can be described as the set of all translates
of elements in the null space of
A by some ﬁxed vector. Such a set is sometimes called
an afﬁne set or a ﬂat. When
n is
2 or
3 this says that the solution set is either a single
point, a line or a plane – not necessarily through the origin!

sional space

: Notice that this line does not pass through the origin since

x

R
3
:
Now we turn to another computational matter. How do we ﬁnd bases of vector spaces
prescribed by a spanning set? How do we ﬁnd the linear dependencies in a spanning
set or implement the Steinitz substitution principle in a practical way? We have all the
tools we need now to solve these problems. Let’s begin with the question of ﬁnding a
basis. We are going to solve this problem in two ways. Each has its own merits.
First we examine the row space approach. We require two simple facts.
THEOREM 3.6.5. Let
A be any matrix and
E an elementary matrix. Then
R(A)
=
R(E
A):
PROOF. Suppose the rows of
A are the vectors
r
1
;
r
2
;
:
:
:
;
r
n, so that we have
R(A)
=
span
fr
1
;
r
2
;
:
:
:
;
r
n
g: If
E
=
E
ij, then the effect of multiplication by
E is to
switch the
ith and
jth rows, so the rows of
E
A are simply the rows of
A in a different
order. Hence,
R(A)
=
R(E
A) in this case. If
E
=
E
i
(a), with
a a nonzero scalar,
then the effect of multiplication by
E is to replace the
ith row by a nonzero multiple
of itself. Clearly, this doesn’t change the span of the rows either. To simplify notation,
consider the case
E
=
E
12
(a): Then the ﬁrst row
r
1 is replaced by
r
1
+
ar
2, so that any
combination of the rows of
E
A is expressible as a linear combination of the rows of
A:
Conversely, since
r
1
=
r
1
+
ar
2
 ar
2, we see that any combination of
r
1
;
r
2
;
:
:
:
;
r
n
can be expressed in terms of the rows of
E
A: This proves the theorem.
THEOREM 3.6.6. If the matrix
R is in reduced row echelon form, then the nonzero rows
of
R form a basis of
R(R
):
PROOF. Suppose the rows of
R are given as
r
1
;
r
2
;
:
:
:
;
r
n, so that we have
R(R
)
=
spanfr
1
;
r
2
;
:
:
:
;
r
k
g, where the ﬁrst
k rows of
R are nonzero and the remaining rows
are zero rows. So certainly the nonzero rows span
R(R
): In order for these vectors to
form a basis, they must also be a linearly independent set. If some linear combination
of these vectors is zero, say
0

3.6. LINEAR SYSTEMS REVISITED

we examine the
ith coordinate of this linear combination, corresponding to the column
in which the
ith pivot appears. In that column
r
i has a coordinate value of
1 and all other
r
j have a value of zero. Therefore, the linear combination above yields that
c
i
=
0:
Since this holds for each
i

k, we obtain that all
c
i
=
0 and the nonzero rows must be
linearly independent. It follows that these vectors form a basis of
R(R
):
These theorems are the foundations for the following algorithm for ﬁnding a basis for a
vector space.

From this we see that the vectors

space of

The second algorithm for computing a basis does a little more than ﬁnd a basis: it gives
us a way to tackle the question of what linear combinations sum to zero.

a

]: In other words, the column
c
of coefﬁcients is in the null space of
A: Every solution
c to this system is uniquely
speciﬁed as follows: assign arbitrary values to the free variables, then use the rows of
the reduced row echelon form of
A to solve for each bound variable. This is exactly
what we wanted to show.
In view of this theorem, we see that the columns of
A corresponding to pivot columns
(equivalently, bound variables) in the reduced row echelon form of
A must be them-
selves a linearly independent set. We also see from the proof of this theorem that we can
express any column corresponding to a non-pivot column (equivalently, free variable )
in terms of columns corresponding to bound variables by setting the free variable cor-
responding to this column to
1, and all other free variables to
0: Therefore, the columns
of
A corresponding to pivot columns form a basis of
C
(A): This justiﬁes the following
algorithm for ﬁnding a basis for a vector space.

We can see from this calculation that the ﬁrst and second columns will be pivot columns,
while the third and fourth will not be. According to the column space algorithm,
C

is a two dimensional space with the ﬁrst two columns for a basis.

3.6. LINEAR SYSTEMS REVISITED
171
Just for the record, let’s notice here that Theorem 3.6.8 shows us exactly how to express
the last two columns in terms of the ﬁrst two. From the ﬁrst two rows of the reduced
row echelon form of
A we see that if
c
=
(c
1

c

;
c

c

) and
Ac

c

c

Finally, we consider the problem of ﬁnding a basis for a null space. Actually, we have
already dealt with this problem in an earlier example (Example 3.4.7), but now we will
justify what we did there.

v

v

of
N
(A):
PROOF. The vector
x
=
0 occurs precisely when all the free variables are set equal
to
0, for the bound variables are linear combinations of the free variables. This means
that the only linear combination of the vectors

for which all the coefﬁcients

3.7. *Change of Basis and Linear Operators
How much information do we need to uniquely identify an operator? For a general
operator the answer is: a lot! Speciﬁcally, we don’t really know everything about it
until we know how to ﬁnd its value at every possible argument. This is an inﬁnite
amount of information. Yet we know that in some circumstances we can do better.
For example, to know a polynomial function completely, we only need a ﬁnite amount
of data, namely the coefﬁcients of the polynomial. We have already seen that linear

operators are special. Are they described by a ﬁnite amount of data? The answer is a
resounding “yes” in the situation where the domain and target are ﬁnite dimensional.
Let
T

W be such an operator. Suppose that
B

that there exists a unique set of scalars (the coordinates of

Look closely and we see that the coefﬁcients of these vectors are themselves coordinates
of a matrix product, namely the matrix
A times the column vector of coordinates of
v with respect to the chosen basis of
V
: The result of this matrix multiplication is a
column vector whose entries are the coordinates of
T
(v

W
: So in a certain sense, computing the value of a linear operator amounts to no more
than multiplying a (coordinate) vector by the matrix

3. VECTOR SPACES
Even in the case of an operator as simple as the identity map
I
(v
)
=
v, the matrix of a
linear operator can be useful and interesting.
DEFINITION 3.7.2. Let

;
v
n
g and
C
=
fw
1
;
w
2
;
:
:
:
;
w
n
g both be
bases of
V
: Then the matrix
[I
]
B
;C of the identity map
I
:
V
!
V relative to these
bases is called the change of basis matrix from the basis
C to the basis
B
:
A very fundamental fact about these change of bases matrices is the answer to the fol-
lowing question. Suppose that
T
:
V
!
W and
S
:
U
!
V are linear operators. Can
we relate the matrices of
T
;
S and
T
Æ
S? The answer is as follows.

D

An immediate corollary is that if
T is invertible, then so is the matrix of
T with respect
to any basis. In particular, all change of bases matrices are invertible.
We can now also see exactly what happens when we make a change of basis in the do-
main and target of a linear operator and recalculate the matrix of the operator. Specif-
ically, suppose that
T
:
V
!
W and that
B

B

V and
C
;
C
0 are bases of
W
: Let
P and
Q be the change of basis matrices from
B

C, respec-
tively. Identify a matrix with its operator action by multiplication and we have a chain
of operator maps

NOTATION 3.7.4. If

m is a linear operator, then the matrix of
T with
respect to the standard bases of the domain and target of

We have just obtained a very important insight into the matrix of a linear transformation.
Here is the form it takes for the standard spaces.

We develop the background for this project by way of an example. You might also
review the material of page 66.
EXAMPLE 3.8.1. Suppose we have a communications network that connects ﬁve nodes
which we label
1;
2;
3;

5: Communications between points are not necessarily two-
way. We specify the network by listing ordered pairs
(i;

By a loop we mean a walk that starts and ends at some node, i.e., a sequence of directed
edges connecting a node to itself. For example, the sequence
(3;
5);
(5;
3) is a loop in
our example. It is important to be able to account for loops in such a network. For
one thing, we know that we have two-way communication between any two points in a
loop (start at one point and follow the arrows around the loop till you reach the other).
Find all the loops of this example and formulate an algorithm that one could program to
compute all the loops of the network.
SOLUTION. We recognize this as data that can be modeled by a directed graph (see Ex-
ample 2.3.4). Thus, “nodes” are just vertices in the graphs and connections are edges.
We can draw a picture that contains all the data that we are given by representing each
team, or “vertex”, as a point and then connecting two points with an arrow, or “di-
rected edge”, which points from the winner towards a loser in one of the matches. See
Figure 3.8.1 for a picture of this graph.
It isn’t so simple to eyeball this graph and count all loops. In fact, if you count go-
ing around and around in the same loop as different from the original loop, there are
inﬁnitely many. Perhaps we should be a bit more systematic about it. Let’s count the
smallest loops only, that is, the loops that are not themselves a sum of other loops. It
appears that there are only three of these, namely,
L
1
:
(3;
5);
(5;
3)
L
2
:
(2;
3);
(3;
4);
(4;
2)
L
3
:
(1;
2);
(2;
3);
(3;
1)
There are other loops, e.g.,
L
4
:
(2;
3);
(3;
5);
(5;
3);
(3;
4);
(4;
2): But this is built up
out of
L
1and
L
2
: In a certain sense,
L
4
=
L
1
+
L
2
: There seems to be a “calcu-
lus of loops.” Lurking in the background is another matrix, different from the adja-
cency matrix that we encountered in Chapter 2, that describes all the data necessary
to construct the graph. It is called the incidence matrix of the graph and is given as
follows: the incidence matrix has its rows index by the vertices of the graph and its

180

columns by the edges. If the edge
(i;
j
) is in the graph, then the column correspond-
ing to this edge has a
 1 in its
ith row and a
+1 in its
jth row. All other entries
are
0: In our example we see that the vertex set is
V
=
f1;
2;
3;
4;
5g, the edge set is
E
=
f(1;

(3;

(4;

(1;

trix is

We can now describe all loops. Each column of
A deﬁnes an edge. Thus, linear combi-
nations of these columns with integer coefﬁcients represent a listing of edges, possibly
with repeats. Consider such a linear combination with deﬁning vector of coefﬁcients

When will such a combination represent a loop? For one thing the coefﬁcients should all
be nonnegative integers. But this isn’t enough. Here’s the key idea: we should examine
this combination locally, that is, at each vertex. There we expect the total number of
“in-arrows” ( 1’s) to be exactly cancelled by the total number of “out-arrows” (+1’s).
In other words, each coordinate of
v should be
0 and therefore
c

ﬁnd a basis of
N
(A) by using the null space algorithm. To make our work a little easier,
compute the null space of

Now we see that
v
5 and
v
6 don’t represent loops in the sense that we originally deﬁned
them since we only allow loops to move in the direction of the edge arrow. However,
the basis vectors of coefﬁcients that represent loops as we deﬁned them are
v
4 and
v
8
:
The loop can be expressed algebraically as
1
2
(v
6
 v
5
): Therefore, all possible loops
can be represented by the basis vectors for the null space.
This null space calculation is trying to tell us something. What the null space says is
that if we allowed for paths that moved against the direction of the edge arrows when
the coefﬁcient of the edge is negative, we would have four independent loops. These
“algebraic” loops include our original loops. They are much easier to calculate since
we don’t have to worry about all the coefﬁcients
c
i being of the same sign. They may
not be very useful in the context of communication networks, since they don’t specify
a ﬂow of information; but in the context of electrical circuits they are very important.
In fact, the correct deﬁnition of a “loop” in electrical circuit theory is an element
N
(A)
with integer coefﬁcients.

3. VECTOR SPACES

CHAPTER 4
GEOMETRICAL ASPECTS OF STANDARD SPACES
The standard vector spaces have many important extra features that we have ignored
up to this point. These extra features made it possible to do sophisticated calculations
in the spaces and enhanced our insight into vector spaces by appealing to geometry.
For example, in the geometrical spaces
R
2 and
R
3 that were studied in calculus, it was
possible to compute the length of a vector and angles between vectors. These are visual
concepts that feel very comfortable to us. In this chapter we are going to generalize
these ideas to the standard spaces and their subspaces. We will abstract these ideas to
general vector spaces in Chapter 6.
4.1. Standard Norm and Inner Product
Throughout this chapter vector spaces will be assumed to be subspaces of the standard
vector spaces
R
n or
C
n
:
The Norm Idea
Consider this problem. Can we make sense out of the idea of a sequence of vectors
u
i
converging to a limit vector
u, i.e.,
lim
n!1
u
n
=
u
in standard spaces? What we need is some idea about the length, or norm, of a vector,
so we can say that the length of the difference
u
 u
n should tend to
0 as
n
!
1:
We have seen such an idea in the geometrical spaces
R
2 or
R
3
: There are different
ways to measure length. We shall begin with the most standard method, one which you
have already encountered in calculus. It is one of the outcomes of geometry and the
Pythagorean theorem. There is no compelling reason to stop at geometrical dimensions
of two or three, so here is the general deﬁnition.

Even though we can’t really “see” the ﬁve dimensional vector
y of this example, it is
interesting to note that calculating its length is just as routine as calculating the length
of the three dimensional vector
x: What about complex vectors? Shouldn’t there be an
analogous deﬁnition of norm for such objects? The answer is “yes,” but we have to be
a little careful. We can’t use the same deﬁnition that we did for real vectors. Consider
the vector
x
=
(1;
1
+
i): The sum of the squares of the coordinates is just

This isn’t good. We don’t want “length” to be measured in complex numbers. The ﬁx
is very simple. We already have a way of measuring the length of a complex number
z,
namely the absolute value
j
z
j: So length squared should be
j
z
j

: That is the inspiration
for the following deﬁnition which is entirely consistent with our ﬁrst deﬁnition when
applied to real vectors:

The triangle inequality (which gets its name from the triangle with representatives of
the vectors
u;
v
;
u
+
v as its legs) can be proved easily in two or three dimensional
geometrical space by appealing to the fact that the sum of lengths of any two legs of a
triangle is greater that the length of the third leg. A justiﬁcation for higher dimensions
is a nontrivial piece of algebra that we will postpone until after the introduction of inner
products below.
First we consider a few applications of the norm concept. The ﬁrst of these is the idea
Unit Vectors
of “normalizing” a vector. This means ﬁnding a unit vector, which means a vector of
length
1, that has the same direction as the given vector. This process is sometimes
called “normalization.” How do we do it? The following simple fact helps.

is a unit vector in the same direction as
u:
PROOF. Any two vectors determine the same direction if one is a positive multiple
of the other (actually, this is a deﬁnition of “determining the same direction”). Therefore
we see immediately that
w and
u determine the same direction. Now check the length
of
w and use basic norm law 2 to obtain that

Hence

4) and
v

In order to work the next example we must express the idea of vector convergence
of a sequence
u

;
u

;
:

: to the vector
u in a sensible way. The norm idea makes this
straightforward: to say that the
u
n’s approach the vector
u should mean that the distance
between
u and
u
n goes to
0 as
n
!
1: But norm measures distance. Therefore the
correct deﬁnition is as follows:
DEFINITION 4.1.8. Let
u

;
u

;

: be a sequence of vectors in the vector space
V and
u also a vector in

The Inner Product Idea
In addition to norm concept we had another fundamental tool in our arsenal when we
tackled two and three dimensional geometrical vectors. This tool was the so-called “dot
product” of two vectors. It had many handy applications, but the most powerful of these
was the ability to determine the angle between two vectors. In fact, some authors use
this idea as the basis for deﬁning dot products as follows: let
 be the angle between
representatives of the vectors
u and
v
: (See Figure 4.1.1.) The dot product of
u and
v
is deﬁned to be the quantity
kuk
kv
k
cos

: It turned out that with some trigonometry
and algebra, one could come up with a very convenient form for inner products; for
example, in the two dimensional case, if
u
=
(u
1
;
u
2
) and
v
=
(v
1
;
v
2
), then
u

v
=
u
1
v
1
+
u
2
v
2
(4.1.1)
This made the calculation of dot products vastly easier since we didn’t have to use any
trigonometry to compute it. A particularly nice application was that we could determine
cos
 quite easily from the dot product, namely
cos

=
u

v
jj
u
jj

v

(4.1.2)
We have seen that it is useful to try to extend these geometrical ideas to higher dimen-
sions even if we can’t literally use trigonometry and the like. So what we do is reverse
the sequence of ideas we’ve discussed and take Equation 4.1.1 as the prototype for our
next deﬁnition. As with norms, we are going to have to distinguish carefully between
the cases of real or complex scalars. First we focus on the more common case of real
coefﬁcients.
DEFINITION 4.1.10. Let
u
=
(x
1
;
x

;
:
:
:

) and
v
=

We can see from the ﬁrst form of this deﬁnition where the term “inner product” came
from. Recall from Section 2.4 of Chapter 2 that the matrix product
u
T
v is called the
inner product of these two vectors.
EXAMPLE 4.1.11. Compute the dot product of the vectors

There is a wonderful connection between the standard inner product and the standard
norm for vectors which is immediately evident from the deﬁnitions. Here it is:
jj
u
jj
=
p
u

u
(4.1.3)
Thus computing norms amounts to an inner product calculation followed by a square
root. Actually, we can even avoid the square root and put the equation in the form
jj
u
jj
2
=
u

u
We say that the standard norm is induced by the standard inner product. We would
like this property to carry over to complex vectors. Now we have to be a bit careful.
In general, the quantity
u
T
u may not even be a real number, or may be negative. This
means that
p
u
T
u could be complex, which doesn’t seem like a good idea for measuring
“length.” So how can we avoid this problem? Recall that when we introduced trans-
poses, we also introduced Hermitian transposes and remarked that for complex vectors,
this is a more natural tool than the transpose. Now we can back up that remark! Recall
the deﬁnition for complex norm: for
u
=
(z
1
;
z

;

;
z

Therefore, in our deﬁnition of complex “dot products” we had better replace transposes
by Hermitian transposes. This inspires the deﬁnition

What are the really essential deﬁning properties of these standard inner products? It
turns out that we can answer the question for both real and complex inner products at
once. However, we should bear in mind that most of the time we will be dealing with
real dot products, and in this case all the dot products in questions are real numbers, so
that any reference to a complex conjugate can be omitted.
Basic Inner Product Laws. Let
c be a scalar and
u;
v

V is a
vector space with the standard inner product. Then the following hold.

That (1) is true is immediate from the fact that

u

H
u is a sum of the length
squared of the coordinates of
u: This sum is zero exactly when each term is zero. Con-

v

u, which holds for real vectors but not for complex vectors, where

Conditions (3) and (4) are similarly veriﬁed and left to the exercises. We can also use
(4) to prove this fact for real vectors:
(cu)

v

(cu)

c(v

If we are dealing with complex dot products, matters are a bit trickier. One can show
then that
(cu)

v

c(u

so we don’t quite have the symmetry that we have for real dots.

4.2. Applications of Norms and Inner Products

Now that we have dot products under our belts we can tackle geometrical issues like
angles between vectors in higher dimensions. For the matter of angles, we will stick to
real vector spaces, though we could do it for complex vector spaces with a little extra
work. What we would like to do is take Equation 4.1.2 as the deﬁnition of the angle
between two vectors. There’s one slight problem: how do we know that it will give a
quantity that could be a cosine? After all, cosines only take on values between
 1 and

Take square roots and we have the desired inequality.
This inequality has a number of useful applications. For instance, because of it we
can articulate the following deﬁnition. There is a certain ambiguity in discussing angle
between vectors, since more than one angle works. Actually it’s the cosine of these
angles that is really unique.

We have just seen a very important case of angles between vectors that warrants its own
name. Recall from geometry that two vectors are perpendicular or orthogonal if the
angle between them is

cos

=
0, we see that this amounts to the equation
u

v
=
0: Now we can extend the perpendicularity idea to arbitrary vectors, including
complex vectors.

In the case that one of the vectors is the zero vector, we have the little oddity that the
zero vector is orthogonal to every other vector, since the dot product is always
0 in this
case. Some authors require that
u and
v be nonzero as part of the deﬁnition. It’s a minor
point and we won’t worry about it. When
u and

By parallel vectors we mean two vectors that are nonzero scalar multiples of each other.
Notice that parallel vectors may determine the same or opposite directions. Our next
application of the dot product relates back to a fact that we learned in geometry: given
two nonzero vectors in the plane, it is always possible to resolve one of them into a sum
of a vector parallel to the other and a vector orthogonal to the other (see Figure 4.2.1).
The parallel component was called the projection of one vector along the other. As a
matter of fact, we can develop this same idea in arbitrary standard vector spaces. That is
the content of the following useful fact. Remember, by the way, that “parallel” vectors
simply means that the vectors in question are scalar multiples of each other (any scalar).

Least Squares
EXAMPLE 4.2.10. You are using a pound scale to measure weights for produce sales
when you notice that your scale is about to break. The vendor at the next stall is leaving
and loans you another scale as she departs. Soon afterwards your scale breaks. You
then realize that the new scale is in units you don’t recognize. You happen to have a
some known weights that are approximately
2,
5 and
7 pounds respectively. When you
weigh these items on the new scale you get the numbers
0:9,
2:4 and
3:2: You get your
calculator out and hypothesize that the unit of weight should be some constant multiple

4.2. APPLICATIONS OF NORMS AND INNER PRODUCTS
197
of pounds. Model this information as a system of equations. Is it clear from this system
what the units of the scale are?
SOLUTION. Express the relationship between the weight
p in pounds and the weight
w
in unknown units as
w

c
=
p, where
c is an unknown. Your data show that we have
0:7c
=
2
2:4c
=
5
3:4c
=
7
As a system of three equations in one unknown you see immediately that this overdeter-
mined system (too many equations) is inconsistent. After all, the pound weights were
only approximate and in addition there is always some error in measurement. Conse-
quently, it is not at all clear what the units of the scale are, and we will have to investigate
this problem further. You could just average the three inconsistent values of
c, thereby
obtaining
c
=
(2=0:7
+
5=2:4
+
7=3:4)=3
=
2:3331
It isn’t at all clear that this should be a good strategy.
There really is a better way and it will lead to a slightly different estimate of the number
c: This method, called the method of least squares, was invented by C. F. Gauss to
handle uncertainties in orbital calculations in astronomy.
Here is the basic problem: suppose we have data that leads to a system of equations for
unknowns that we want to solve for, but the data has errors in it and consequently leads
to an inconsistent linear system
Ax
=
b
How do we ﬁnd the “best” approximate solution? One could answer this in many ways.
One of the most commonly accepted ideas is one that goes back to C. F. Gauss: the
quantity so-called residual
r
=
b
 Ax should be
0 so its departure from
0 is a measure
of our error. Thus we should try to ﬁnd a value of the unknown
x that minimizes the
norm of the residual squared, i.e., a “solution”
x so that
jjb
 Axjj
2
is minimized. Such a solution is called a “least squares” solution to the system. This
is used extensively by statisticians, in situations where one has many estimates for un-
known parameters which, taken together, are not perfectly consistent. Let’s try to get a
ﬁx on this problem. Even the 1 variable case is instructive, so let’s use the preceding
example.
In this case the coefﬁcient matrix
A is the column vector
a
=
[0:7;
2:4;
3:4]
T and the
right hand side vector is
b
=
[2;
5;
7]
T
: What we are really trying to ﬁnd is a value
of the scalar
x
=
c such that
b
 Ax
=
b
 xa is a minimum. Here is a geometrical
interpretation: we want to ﬁnd the multiple of the vector
a that is closest to
b: Geometry
suggests that this minimum occurs when
b
 xa is orthogonal to
a, in other words, when
xa is the projection of
b along
a: Inspection of the projection formula shows us that we
must have

Notice that this doesn’t solve any of the original equations exactly, but it is, in a certain
sense, the best approximate solution to all three equations taken together. Also, this
solution is not the same as the average of the solutions to the three equations, which we
computed to be
2:3331:
Now how do we tackle the more general system
Ax
=
b? Since
Ax is just a linear
combination of the columns, what we should ﬁnd is the vector of this form which is
closest to the vector
b: See Figure 6 for a picture of the situation with
n
=
2: Our
experience with the 1-dimensional case suggests that we should require that the residual
be orthogonal to each column of
A; that is,
a

(b
 Ax)

T
i
(b

=

equations at once in the form of the so-called normal equations:

minimum by ﬁnding all partials and setting them equal to

will minimize the norm of the difference

x ranges over all elements of

n
:
The coefﬁcient matrix
B
=
A
T
A of the normal system has some pleasant properties.
For one, it is a symmetric matrix. For another, it is a positive semideﬁnite matrix, by
which we mean that
B is a square (say

n) matrix such that

:
Does there exist a solution to the normal equations? The answer is “yes.” In general,
any solution to the normal equations minimizes the residual norm and is called a least
squares solution to the problem
Ax
=
b: Since we now have two versions of “solution”
for the system
Ax
=
b; we should distinguish between them in situations which may
refer to either. If the vector
x actually satisﬁes the equation
Ax
=
b; we call
x a
genuine solution to the system to contrast it with a least squares solution. Certainly,
every genuine solution is a least squares solution, but the coverse will not be true if the
original system is inconsistent. We leave the veriﬁcations as exercises.

4.2. APPLICATIONS OF NORMS AND INNER PRODUCTS

The normal equations are guaranteed to be consistent – a nontrivial fact – and will have
inﬁnitely many solutions if
A
T
A is a singular matrix. However, we will focus on the
most common case, namely that in which
A is a rank
n matrix. Recall that in this case
we say that
A has full column rank. We can show that the
n

n matrix
A
T
A is also
rank
n: This means that it is an invertible matrix and therefore the solution to the normal
equations is unique. Here is the necessary fact.
THEOREM 4.2.11. Suppose that the
m

n matrix
A has full column rank
n: Then the
n

n matrix
A
T
A also has rank
n and is invertible.
PROOF. Assume
A has rank
n: Now suppose that for some vector
x we have

so that

with
A as its coefﬁcient matrix must have a unique solution. Of course, this solution is
the zero vector. Therefore,
x
=
0: It follows that the square matrix
A

A has rank
n
(and is invertible as well) by Theorem 2.5.9

we could have set up the augmented matrix of the system and found a pivot in the right

Orthogonal Sets of Vectors
In our discussion of bases in Chapter 3, we saw that linear independence of a set of
set of vectors was a key idea for understanding the nature of vector spaces. One of
our examples of a linearly independent set (a basis, actually) was the standard basis
e

e

:
;
e
n of
R
n
: Here
e
i is the vector with a
1 in the
ith coordinate and zeros
elsewhere. In the case of geometrical vectors and
n
=
3, these are just the familiar
i;
j;
k: These vectors have some particularly nice properties that go beyond linear inde-
pendence. For one, each is a unit vector with respect to the standard norm. Furthermore,
these vectors are pairwise orthogonal to each other. These properties are so desirable
that we elevate them to the status of a deﬁnition.

It follows from the deﬁnition of linear independence that the vectors

linearly independent.
Several observations are worth noting:
 The converse of the corollary is false, that is, not every linearly independent
set of vectors is orthogonal. For an example, consider the linearly independent
vectors
v
1
=
(1;
0);
v

(1;
1) in
V
=
R

 The vector

v
k
v
k looks familiar. In fact, it is the projection of the vector
v along the vector
v
k
: Thus, we can say Theorem 6.2.18 in words as follows:
any linear combination of an orthogonal set of nonzero vectors is the sum of its
projections in the direction of each vector in the set.
 The coefﬁcients
c
k of Theorem 6.2.18 are also familiar: they are the coordinates
of
v relative to the basis
v
1
;
v

;
:
:

;
v
n
: This terminology was introduced in
Section 3.3 of Chapter 3. Thus Theorem 6.2.18 shows us that coordinates are
rather easy to calculate with respect to an orthogonal basis. Contrast this with
Example 3.3.13 of Chapter 3.

 Given an orthogonal set of nonzero vectors, it is easy to manufacture an or-
thonormal set of vectors. Simply replace every vector in the original set by the
vector divided by its length.
Orthogonal and Unitary Matrices
In general, if we want to determine the coordinates of a vector
b with respect to a certain
basis of vectors in
R
n or
C
n, we stack the basis vectors together to form a matrix
A,
then solve the system
Ax
=
b for the vector of coordinates
x of
b with respect to this
basis. In fact,
x
=
A
 1
b: Now we have seen that if the basis vectors happen to form
an orthonormal set, the situation is much simpler and we certainly don’t have to ﬁnd
A
 1
: Is this simplicity reﬂected in properties of the matrix
A? The answer is “yes” and
we can see this as follows: suppose that
u
1
;
u
2
;
:
:
:
;
u
n is an orthonormal basis of
R
n
and let
A
=
[
u
1
;
u
2
;
:
:
:
;
u
n
]: Orthogonality says that
u
T
i
u
j
=
Æ
ij
: This means that
the matrix
A
T
A, whose
(i;
j
)th entry is
u
T
n
u
n, is simply
[Æ
ij
]
=
I, that is,
A
T
A
=
I
:
Now recall that Theorem 2.5.9 of Chapter 2 shows that if a matrix acts as an inverse
on one side and the matrices in question are square, then the matrix really is the two-
sided inverse. Hence,
A
 1
=
A
T
: A similar argument works if
u
1
;
u
2
;
:
:
:
;
u
n is an
orthonormal basis of
C
n and we use Hermitian transpose instead of transpose. Matrices
bearing these properties are important enough to have their own names.
DEFINITION 4.3.5. A square matrix
U is called unitary if
U
H
=
U
 1 and
Q is called
orthogonal if
Q is real and
Q
T
=
Q
 1
:
One could allow orthogonal matrices to be complex as well, but these are not particu-
larly useful for us, so in this text we will always assume that orthogonal matrices have
real entries. Since for real matrices
Q, we have
Q
H
=
Q
T , we see from the deﬁnition
that orthogonal matrices are exactly the real unitary matrices.
The naming is traditional in matrix theory, but a bit unfortunate because it sometimes
causes confusion between the terms “orthogonal vectors” and “orthogonal matrix.” By
orthogonal vectors we mean a set of vectors with a certain relationship to each other,
while an orthogonal matrix is a real matrix whose inverse is its transpose. And to make
matters more confusing, there is a close connection between the two terms, since a
square matrix is orthogonal exactly when its columns form an orthonormal set.

Orthogonal and unitary matrices have a certain “rigidity” quality about them which is
nicely illustrated by the rotation matrix
R
(
) that turns up in calculus as coefﬁcients for
a rotational change of basis. The effect of multiplying a vector
x
2
R
2 by
R
(
) is to
rotate the vector counterclockwise through an angle of
 as illustrated in Figure 4.3.1. In
particular, angles between vectors and lengths of vectors are preserved by such a mul-
tiplication. This is no accident of
R
(
), but rather a property of orthogonal and unitary
matrices in general. Here is a statement of these properties for orthogonal matrices. An
analogous fact holds for complex unitary matrices with vectors in
C
n
:

There is one more kind of orthogonal matrix that has turned out to be very useful in
numerical calculations and has a very nice geometrical interpretation as well. It gives
us a very simple way of forming orthogonal matrices directly.

H

v

called a Householder matrix.

The behavior of this example is no accident. Multiplication by a Householder matrix
can be thought of as a geometrical reﬂection that reﬂects the vector
v to
 v and leaves
any vector orthogonal to
v unchanged. This is implied by the following theorem. For a
picture of this geometrical interpretation, see Figure 4.3.2. Notice that in this ﬁgure
V
is the plane perpendicular to
v and the reﬂections are across this plane.

H

4. GEOMETRICAL ASPECTS OF STANDARD SPACES
For the most part we work with real Householder matrices. However, occasionally
complex numbers are a necessary part of the scenery. In such situations we can deﬁne
the complex Householder matrix by the formula
H
v
=
I
 2(vv
H
)=(v
H
v
)
The projection formula (Theorem 4.2.8) remains valid for complex vectors which is
all we need to see that the proof of Theorem 4.3.10 carries over to complex vectors
provided that we replace all transposes by Hermitian transposes.
One might ask if there is any other way to generate orthogonal matrices. In particular, if
we start with a single unit vector, can we embed it as a column in an orthogonal matrix?
The answer is “yes,” and truth of this answer follows from an even stronger statement,
which is reminiscent of the Steinitz substitution principle.
THEOREM 4.3.12. Every orthogonal set of nonzero vectors in a standard vector space
can be expanded to an orthogonal basis of the space.
PROOF. Suppose that the space in question is
R
n and we have expanded our orig-
inal orthogonal set to
v
1
;
v
2
;
:
:
:
;
v
k
; where
k
<
n: We show how to add one more
element. This is sufﬁcient, because by repeating this step we eventually ﬁll up
R
n
: Let
A
=
[v
1
;
v
2
;
:
:
:
;
v
k
]
T and let
v
k
+1 be any nonzero solution to
Ax
=
0; which exists
since
k
<
n: This vector is orthogonal to the
v
1
;
v
2
;
:
:
:
;
v
k
:
We’ll see a more efﬁcient way to perform this calculation when we study the Gram-
Schmidt algorithm in Chapter 6.

v

Form the matrix

Implementation Notes: You will need to set up suitable system of equations, form the
normal equations, and have a computer algebra system solve the problem. For purposes
of illustration, we assume in this project that the tool in use is Mathematica. If not, you
will need to replace these commands with the appropriate ones that your computational
tools provide. The equations in question are formed by letting the variables be a vector
x of “potentials”
x(i); one for each team
i; so that the “potential differences” best
approximate the actual score differences (i.e., point spreads) of the games. To ﬁnd the

4.4. *COMPUTATIONAL NOTES AND PROJECTS

vector
x of potentials you solve the system
Ax
=
b, where
b is the vector of observed
potential differences. N.B: the matrix
A is not the table given above. You will get
one equation for each game played. For example, by checking the
(1;
2)th and
(2;
1)th
entries, we see that CU beat IS by a score of 24 to 12. So the resulting equation for this
game is
x(1)
 x(2)
=
24
 12
=
12: Ideally, the resulting potentials would give you
numbers that would enable you to predict the point spread of an as yet unplayed game:
all you would have to do to determine the spread for team
i versus team
j is calculate
the difference
x(j
)
 x(i): Of course, it doesn’t really work out this way, but this is a
good use of the known data. When you set up this system, you obtain an inconsistent
system. This is where least squares enter the picture. You will need to set up and solve
the normal equations, one way or another. You might notice that the null space of the
resulting coefﬁcient matrix is nontrivial, so this matrix is not full column rank. This
makes sense: potentials are unique up to a constant. To ﬁx this, you could arbitrarily ﬁx
the value of one team’s potential. E.g., set the weakest team’s potential value to zero by
adding one additional equation to the system of the form
x(i)
=
0:
Notes to the Instructor: the data above came from the now defunct Big Eight Confer-
ence. This project works better when adapted to your local environment. Pick a sport in
season at your institution or locale. Have students collect the data themselves, make out
a data table as above, and predict the spread for some (as yet) unplayed games of local
interest. It can be very interesting to make it an ongoing project, where for a number
of weeks the students are required to collect last week’s data and make predictions for
next week based on all data collected to date.

CHAPTER 5
THE EIGENVALUE PROBLEM
The ﬁrst major problem of linear algebra is to understand how to solve the basis linear
system
Ax
=
b and what the solution means. We have explored this system from three
points of view: in Chapter 1 we approached the problem from an operational point
of view and learned the mechanics of computing solutions. In Chapter 2, we took a
more sophisticated look at the system from the perspective of matrix theory. Finally, in
Chapter 3, we viewed the problem from the vantage of vector space theory.
Now it time for us to begin study of the second major problem of linear algebra, namely
the eigenvalue problem. It was necessary for us to tackle the linear systems problem ﬁrst
because the eigenvalue problem is more sophisticated and will require most of the tools
that we have thus far developed. This subject has many useful applications; indeed, it
arose out of these applications. One of the more interesting applications of eigenvalue
theory that we study in this chapter is the analysis of discrete dynamical systems. Such
systems include the Markov chains we have seen in earlier chapters as a special case.
5.1. Deﬁnitions and Basic Properties
What are They?
Good question. Let’s get right to the point.
DEFINITION 5.1.1. Let
A be a square
n

n matrix. An eigenvector of
A is a nonzero
vector
x in
R
n (or
C
n, if we are working over complex numbers), such that for some
scalar
 , we have
Eigenvalues
and
Eigenvectors
Ax
=
x
The scalar
 is called an eigenvalue of the matrix
A, and we say that the vector
x is an
eigenvector belonging to the eigenvalue
. The pair
(;
x) is called an eigenpair for the
matrix
A:
The only kinds of matrices for which these objects are deﬁned are square matrices, so
we’ll assume throughout this Chapter that we are dealing with such matrices.
Caution: Be aware that the eigenvalue
 is allowed to be the
0 scalar, but eigenvectors
x are, by deﬁnition, never the
0 vector.
213

214
5. THE EIGENVALUE PROBLEM
As a matter of fact, it is quite informative to have an eigenvalue
0: This says that the
system
Ax
=
0x
=
0 has a nontrivial solution
x, in other words,
A is not invertible by
Theorem 2.5.9.
Here are a few simple examples of eigenvalues and vectors. Let
A
=

7
4
3
6

;
x
=
( 1;
1) and
y
=
(4;
3): One checks that
Ax
=
( 3;
3)
=
3x and
Ay
=
(40;
30)
=
10y
: It follows that
x and
y are eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues
3 and
10;
respectively.
Why should we have any interest in these quantities? A general answer goes something
like this: knowledge of eigenvectors and eigenvalues gives us deep insights into the
structure of the matrix
A: Here is just one example: suppose that we would like to have
a better understanding of the effect of multiplication of a vector
x by powers of the
matrix
A, that is, of
A
k
x: Let’s start with the ﬁrst power,
Ax: If we knew that
x were
an eigenvector of
A, then we would have that for some scalar
,
Ax
=
x
A
2
x
=
A(Ax)

x
...
A
k
x
=
A(A
k
 1
x)
=



=

k
x
This is very nice, because it reduces something complicated, namely matrix-vector mul-
tiplication, to something simple, namely scalar-vector multiplication.
There are other reasons for the usefulness of the eigenvector/value concept which we
will develop later, but here is one that is fairly immediate: is there any signiﬁcance in
knowing that one of the eigenvalues of
A is
0? Check the deﬁnition of eigenvalue and
we see that this means that
Ax
=
0 for some nonzero vector
x: By Theorem 2.5.9 of
Chapter 2 (page 91) it follows that
A is not invertible. So eigenvalues can tell us about
invertibility.
We need some handles on these quantities. Let’s ask how we could ﬁgure out what
they are for speciﬁc matrices. Here are some of the basic points about eigenvalues and
eigenvectors.
THEOREM 5.1.2. Let
A be a square
n

n matrix. Then
1. The eigenvalues of
A consist of all scalars
 that are solutions to the
nth degree
polynomial equation
det(I
 A)
=
0
2. For a given eigenvalue
, the eigenvectors of the matrix
A belonging to that
eigenvalue consist of all nonzero elements of
N
(I
 A):
PROOF. Note that
x
=
I
x: Thus we have the following chain of thought:
A has
eigenvalue
 if and only if
Ax
=
x, for some nonzero vector
x, which is true if and
only if
0
=
x
 Ax
=
I
x
 Ax
=
(I
 A)x
for some nonzero vector
x: This last statement is equivalent to the assertion that
0
6=
x
2
N
(I
 A): The matrix
I
 A is square, so it has a nontrivial null space precisely

5.1. DEFINITIONS AND BASIC PROPERTIES
215
when it is singular (recall the characterizations of nonsingular matrices in Theorem 2.5.9
of Chapter 2). This occurs only when
det(I
 A)
=
0: If we expand this determinant
down the ﬁrst column, we see that the highest order term involving
 that occurs is the
product of the diagonal terms
(
 a
ii
), so that the degree of the expression
det(I
 A)
as a polynomial in
 is
n: This proves (1).
We saw from this chain of thought that if
 is an eigenvalue of
A, then the eigenvectors
belonging to that eigenvalue are precisely the nonzero vectors
x such that
(I
 A)x
=
0, that is, the nonzero elements of
N
(A), which is what (2) asserts.
Here is some terminology that we will use throughout this chapter.
NOTATION 5.1.3. We call a polynomial monic if the leading coefﬁcient is
1:
For instance,

2
+
2
+
3 is a monic polynomial in
 while
2
2
+

+
1 is not.
DEFINITION 5.1.4. Given a square
n

n matrix
A, the equation
det(I
 A)
=
0 is
called the characteristic equation of
A and the
nth degree monic polynomial
p()
=
det
(I
 A) is called the characteristic polynomial of
A:
Suppose we already know the eigenvalues of
A and want to ﬁnd the eigenvalues of
something like
3A
+
4I
: Do we have to start over to ﬁnd them? The next calculation is
really a useful tool for answering such questions.
THEOREM 5.1.5. If
B
=
cA
+
dI for scalars
d and
c
6=
0, then the eigenvalues of
B
are of the form

=
c
+
d, where
 runs over the eigenvalues of
A; and the eigenvectors
of
A and
B are identical.
PROOF. Let
x be an eigenvector of
A corresponding to the eigenvalue
: Then by
deﬁnition
x
6=0 and
Ax
=
x
Also, we have that
dI
x
=
dx
Now multiply the ﬁrst equation by the scalar
c and add these two equations to obtain
(cA
+
dI
)x
=
B
x
=
(c
+
d)x
It follows that every eigenvector of
A belonging to
 is also an eigenvector of
B be-
longing to the eigenvalue
c
+
d: Conversely, if
y is an eigenvalue of
B belonging to
,
then
B
y
=
y
=
(cA
+
dI
)y
Now solve for
Ay to obtain that
Ay
=
1
c
(
 d)y
so that

=
(
 d)=c is an eigenvalue of
A with corresponding eigenvector
y
: It
follows that
A and
B have the same eigenvectors and their eigenvalues are related by
the formula

=
c
+
d:

SOLUTION. From the calculations given to us, we observe that
x and
y are eigenvec-
tors corresponding to the eigenvalues
3 and
10, respectively, for
A: These are all the
eigenvalues of
A, since the characteristic polynomial of
A is of degree
2; so has only
two roots. According to Theorem 5.1.5, the eigenvalues of

N

Notation: We write
E

(A)

 A):
DEFINITION 5.1.8. By an eigensystem of the matrix
A, we mean a list of all the eigen-
values of
A and, for each eigenvalue
, a complete description of the eigenspace corre-
sponding to
:
The usual way to give a complete description of an eigenspace is to list a basis of the
space. Remember that there is one element of the eigenspace
N
(I
 A) that is not an
eigenvector, namely
0: In any case, the computational route is now clear. To call it an
algorithm is really an abuse of language, since we don’t have a complete computational
description of the root ﬁnding phase, but here it is:
Eigensystem Algorithm. Let
A be an
n

n matrix. To ﬁnd an eigensystem
of
A:
1. Find the scalars that are roots to the characteristic equation
det(I
 A)
=
0:
2. For each scalar
 in (1), use the null space algorithm to ﬁnd a basis of
the eigenspace
N
(I
 A):
As a matter of convenience, it is sometimes a little easier to work with
A
 I when
calculating eigenspaces (because there are fewer extra minus signs to worry about).
This is perfectly OK, since
N
(A
 I
)
=
N
(I
 A): It doesn’t affect the eigenvalues
either, since
det(I
 A)
=

det(A

): Here is our ﬁrst eigensystem calculation.

Therefore a basis of

Concerning this example, there are several interesting points worth noting:
1. Since the
2

2 matrix
A
 I is singular for eigenvalue
, one row should
always be a multiple of the other. Knowing this, we didn’t have to do even the
little row reduction we did above. However, its a good idea to check this; it helps
you avoid mistakes. Remember: any time that row reduction of
A
 I leads to
full rank (only trivial solutions) you have either made an arithmetic error or you
do not have an eigenvalue.
2. This matrix is familiar. In fact,
B
=
(0:1)A is the Markov chain transition
matrix from Example 2.3.4 of Chapter 2. Therefore the eigenvalues of
B are
0:3 and
1, by Example 5.1.9 with
c
=
0:1 and
d
=
0: The eigenvector belonging
to

=
1 is just a solution to the equation
B
x
=
x, which was discussed in
Example 3.4.8 of Chapter 2.
3. The vector

4=3


is also an eigenvector of
A (or

Notice, by the way, that we don’t quite get off the hook in the preceding example if we
are required to ﬁnd the eigenvectors. It will still be some work to compute each of the
relevant null spaces, but much less than it would take for a general matrix.
Example 5.1.10 can be used to illustrate another very important point. The reduced
row echelon form of the matrix of that example is clearly the identity matrix

matrix has eigenvalues
1;

A (would
that eigenvalue calculations were so easy!). In fact, a single elementary row operation
on a matrix can change the eigenvalues. For example, simply multiply the ﬁrst row of
A above by

: This point warrants a warning, since it is the source of a fairly common
mistake.
Caution: The eigenvalues of a matrix

In other words, if we did not enlarge our ﬁeld of scalars to the complex numbers, we
would have to conclude that there are no eigenvalues or eigenvectors! Somehow, this
doesn’t seem like a good idea. It is throwing information away. Perhaps it comes as
no surprise that complex numbers would eventually ﬁgure into the eigenvalue story.
After all, ﬁnding eigenvalues is all about solving polynomial equations, and complex
numbers were invented to overcome the inability of real numbers to provide solutions
to all polynomial equations. Let’s allow complex numbers as the scalars. Now our
eigenspace calculations are really going on in the complex space

In view of the previous example, we are going to adopt the following practice: unless

5. THE EIGENVALUE PROBLEM
The manner in which we list the eigenvalues in this example is intentional. The number
2 occurs twice on the diagonal, suggesting that it should be counted twice. As a matter
of fact,

=
2 is a root of the characteristic equation
(
 2)
2
=
0 of multiplicity
2: Yet there is a curious mismatch here. In all of our examples to this point, we have
been able to come up with as many eigenvectors as eigenvalues, namely the size of the
matrix if we allow complex numbers. In this case there is a deﬁciency in the number
of eigenvectors, since there is only one eigenspace and it is one dimensional. Is this a
failing entirely due to the occurrence of multiple eigenvalues? The answer is no. The
situation is a bit more complicated, as the following example shows.

This example shows that there are two kinds of “multiplicities” of an eigenvector. On
the one hand there is the number of times that the eigenvalue occurs as a root of the
characteristic equation. On the other hand there is the dimension of the corresponding
eigenspace. One of these is algebraic in nature, the other is geometric. Here are the
appropriate deﬁnitions.
DEFINITION 5.1.14. Let
 be a root of the characteristic equation
det(I
 A)
=
0:
Algebraic and
Geometric
Multiplicity
The algebraic multiplicity of
 is the multiplicity of
 as a root of the characteris-
tic equation. The geometric multiplicity of
 is the dimension of the space
E

(A)
=
N
(I
 A):
We categorize eigenvalues as simple or repeated, according to the following deﬁnition.
DEFINITION 5.1.15. The eigenvalue
 of
A is said to be simple if its algebraic multi-
plicity is
1; that is, the number of times it occurs as a root of the characteristic equation
is
1: Otherwise, the eigenvalue is said to be repeated.
In Example 5.1.13 we saw that the repeated eigenvalue

=
2 has algebraic multiplicity
2 in both (a) and (b), but geometric multiplicity
2 in (a) and
1 in (b). What can be said
in general? The following theorem summarizes the facts. In particular, part 2 says that
algebraic multiplicity is always greater than or equal to geometric multiplicity. Part 1
is immediate since a polynomial of degree
n has
n roots, counting complex roots and
multiplicities. We defer the proof of part 2 to the next section.
THEOREM 5.1.16. Let
A be an
n

n matrix with characteristic polynomial
p()
=
det
(I
 A): Then:
1. The number of eigenvalues of
A, counting algebraic multiplicities and complex
numbers, is
n:
2. For each eigenvalue
 of
A, if
m() is the algebraic multiplicity of
, then
1

dim
E

(A)

m()
Now when we wrote that each of the matrices of Example 5.1.13 has eigenvalues

=
1;
2;
2, what we intended to indicate was a complete listing of the eigenvalues of the
matrix, counting algebraic multiplicities. In particular,

=
1 is a simple eigenvalue of
the matrices, while

=
2 is not. The geometric multiplicities of (a) are identical to the
algebraic in (a) but not in (b). The latter kind of matrix is harder to deal with than the
former. Following a time honored custom of mathematicians, we call the more difﬁcult
matrix by a less than ﬂattering name, namely, “defective.”
DEFINITION 5.1.17. A defective matrix is one for which the sum of the geometric mul-
tiplicities is strictly less than the sum of the algebraic multiplicities.
Notice that the sum of the algebraic multiplicities of an
n

n matrix is the size
n of
the matrix. This is due to the fact that the characteristic polynomial of the matrix has
degree
n; hence exactly
n roots, counting multiplicities.

5.2. Similarity and Diagonalization
Diagonalization and Matrix Powers
Eigenvalues: why are they? This is a good question and the justiﬁcation for their exis-
tence and study could go on and on. We will try to indicate their importance by focusing
on one special class of problems, namely, discrete linear dynamical systems. Here is
the deﬁnition of such a system.

224
5. THE EIGENVALUE PROBLEM
DEFINITION 5.2.1. A discrete linear dynamical system is a sequence of vectors
x
(k
)
;
k
=
0;
1;
:
:
:, called states, which is deﬁned by an initial vector
x
(0) and by the rule
x
(k
+1)
=
Ax
(k
)
;
k
=
0;
1;
:
:
:
where
A is a given ﬁxed square matrix, called the transition matrix of the system.
We have seen examples of this kind of system before, namely in Markov chains and
Discrete
Dynamical
System
difference equations. Evidently, the entire sequence of state vectors is determined by
the matrix
A and the initial state
x
(0)
: Here is the sort of question that we would like
to answer: when is it the case that there is a limiting vector
x for this sequence of
vectors and, if so, how does one compute this vector? The answers to these questions
will explain the behavior of the Markov chain that was introduced in Example 2.3.4 of
Chapter 2.
If there is such a limiting vector
x for a Markov chain, we saw in Example 3.4.8 of
Chapter 3 how to proceed: ﬁnd the null space of the matrix
I
 A, that is, the set of
all solutions to the system
(I
 A)x
=0. However, the question of whether or not all
initial states
x
(0) lead to this limiting vector is a more subtle issue which requires the
insights of the next section. We’ve already done some work on this problem. We saw
in Section 2.3 that the entire sequence of vectors is uniquely determined by the initial
vector and the transition matrix
A in the explicit formula
x
(k
)
=
A
k
x
(0)
:
Before proceeding further, let’s consider another example that will indicate why we
would be interested in limiting vectors.
EXAMPLE 5.2.2. By some unfortunate accident a new species of frog has been intro-
duced into an area where it has too few natural predators. In an attempt to restore
the ecological balance, a team of scientists is considering introducing a species of bird
which feeds on this frog. Experimental data suggests that the population of frogs and
birds from one year to the next can be modeled by linear relationships. Speciﬁcally, it
has been found that if the quantities
F
k and
B
k represent the populations of the frogs
and birds in the
kth year, then
B
k
+1
=
0:6B
k
+
0:4F
k
F
k
+1
=
 r
B
k
+
1:4F
k
Here the positive number
r is a kill rate which measures the consumption of frogs by
birds. It varies with the environment, depending on factors such as the availability of
other food for the birds, etc. Experimental data suggests in the environment where the
birds are to be introduced,
r
=
0:35: The question is this: in the long run, will the
introduction of the birds reduce or eliminate the frog population growth?
SOLUTION. The discrete dynamical system concept introduced in the preceding dis-
cussion ﬁts this situation very nicely. Let the population vector in the
kth year be
x
(k
)
=
(B
k
;
F
k
): Then the linear relationship above becomes


B

F


which is a discrete linear dynamical system. Notice that this is different from the
Markov chains we studied earlier, since one of the entries of the coefﬁcient matrix

5.2. SIMILARITY AND DIAGONALIZATION
225
is negative. Before we can ﬁnish solving this example we need to have a better under-
standing of discrete dynamical systems and the relevance of eigenvalues.
Let’s try to understand how state vectors change in the general discrete dynamical sys-
tem. We have
x
(k
)
=
A
k
x
(0)
: So, to understand how a dynamical system works, what
we really need to know is how the powers of the transition matrix A behave. But in
general, this is very hard!
Here is an easy case we can handle: what if
A
=
[a
ij
] is diagonal? Since we’ll make
extensive use of diagonal matrices, let’s use the following notation.
Notation: The matrix

i

Then
P is invertible since the columns of
P are linearly independent. (Remember that
any nonzero solution to
Ax
=
0 would give rise to a nontrivial linear combination of
the column of
A that sums to
0:) Moreover, the equation
AP
=
P
D
; if multiplied on
the left by
P
 1, gives the equation
P
 1
AP
=
D
This is a beautiful equation, because it makes the powers of
A simple to understand.
The procedure we just went through is reversible as well. In other words, if
P is a given
invertible matrix such that
P
 1
AP
=
D, then we can obtain that
AP
=
P
D, identify
the columns of
P by the equation
P
=
[v

] and conclude that the columns of
P are linearly independent eigenvectors of
A: We make the following deﬁnition and
follow it with a simple but key theorem relating similar matrices.
DEFINITION 5.2.5.
A matrix
A is said to be similar to a matrix
B if there exists an
Similar Matrices
invertible matrix
P such that
P
 1
AP
=
B
A simple size check shows that similar matrices have to be square and of the same size.
Furthermore, if
A is similar to
B, then
B is similar to
A: To see this, suppose that
P
 1
AP
=
B and multiply by
P on the left and
P
 1 on the right to obtain that
A
=

Similar matrices have much in common, as the following theorem shows.
THEOREM 5.2.6. Suppose that
A is similar to

: Then:
1. For every positive integer
k,
B
k
=
P

A

P
2. The matrices
A and
B have the same characteristic polynomial, hence the same
eigenvalues.
PROOF. We see that successive terms

k-fold product

to give that

This proves (1). For (2), remember that the determinant distributes over products, so
that we can pull this clever little trick:
det(I

det(P

This proves (2).

5.2. SIMILARITY AND DIAGONALIZATION
227
Now we can see the signiﬁcance of the equation
P
 1
AP
=
D, where
D is diagonal. It
follows from this equation that for any positive integer
k, we have
P

P

multiplying on the left by
P and on the right by

This example showcases a very nice calculation. Given a general matrix
A, when can
we pull off the same calculation? First, let’s give the favorable case a name.
DEFINITION 5.2.8. The matrix
A is diagonalizable if it is similar to a diagonal matrix,
that is, there is an invertible matrix
P and diagonal matrix
D such that
P
 1
AP
=
D
:
In this case we say that
P is a diagonalizing matrix for
A or that
P diagonalizes
A:
The question is, can we be more speciﬁc about when a matrix is diagonalizable? We
can. As a ﬁrst step, notice that the calculations that we began the section with can easily
be written in terms of an
n

n matrix instead of
3

3: What these calculations prove
is the following basic fact.
THEOREM 5.2.9.
The
n

A:
Can we be more speciﬁc about when a linearly independent set of eigenvectors ex-
ists? Actually, we can. Clues about what is really going on can be gleaned from a
re-examination of Example 5.1.13.
EXAMPLE 5.2.10. Apply the results of the preceding discussion to the matrix in part
(b) of Example 5.1.13 or explain why they fail to apply.

5.2. SIMILARITY AND DIAGONALIZATION
229
Hence the eigenspace
E
1
(A) has basis
f( 1;
1;
0)g: All we could come up with here
is two eigenvectors. As a matter of fact, they are linearly independent since one is
not a multiple of the other. But they aren’t enough and there is no way to ﬁnd a third
eigenvector, since we have found them all! Therefore we have no hope of diagonalizing
this matrix according to the diagonalization theorem. The real problem here is that
A is
defective, since the algebraic multiplicity of

=
2 exceeds the geometric multiplicity
of this eigenvalue.
It would be very handy to have some working criterion for when we can manufacture
linearly independent sets of eigenvectors. The next theorem gives us such a criterion.
THEOREM 5.2.11. Let
v
1
;
v
2
;
:
:
:
;
v
k be a set of eigenvectors of the matrix
A such
that corresponding eigenvalues are all distinct. Then the set of vectors
v
1
;
v
2
;
:
:
:
;
v
k
is linearly independent.
PROOF. Suppose the set is linearly dependent. Discard redundant vectors until
we have a smallest linearly dependent subset, say
v
1
;
v
2
;
:
:
:
;
v
m is such a set with
v
i belonging to

i
: All the vectors have nonzero coefﬁcients in a linear combination
that sums to zero, for we could discard the ones that have zero coefﬁcient in the linear
combination and still have a linearly dependent set. So there is some linear combination
of the form

v
k is such that for any eigenvalue

of
A, the subset of all these vectors belonging to

conclusion of the theorem is valid. We leave this as an exercise. Here’s an application
of the theorem which is useful for many problems.
COROLLARY 5.2.12. If the
n

n matrix
A has
n distinct eigenvalues, then
A is diag-
onalizable.
PROOF. We can always ﬁnd one nonzero eigenvector
v
i for each eigenvalue

i of
A: By the preceding theorem, the set
v
1
;
v

;
:
:

;
v
n is linearly independent. Thus
A is
diagonalizable by the Diagonalization theorem.

5. THE EIGENVALUE PROBLEM
Caution: Just because the
n

n matrix
A has fewer than
n distinct eigenvalues, you
may not conclude that it is not diagonalizable.
An example that illustrates this caution is part (a) of Example 5.1.13.

Equation 5.3.2 is the key to understanding how the state vector changes in a discrete
dynamical system. Now we can see clearly that it is the size of the eigenvalues that
governs the growth of successive states. Because of this fact, a handy quantity that
can be associated with a matrix
A (whether it is diagonalizable or not) is the so-called
spectral radius of
A, which we denote by
(A): This number is deﬁned by the formula

in Equation 5.3.1. Then the following are true:

Therefore the sequence of norms

that the eigenvalue powers

k



all other eigenvalues are less than
1 in absolute value. Hence if any coefﬁcient
c

an eigenvector
v
j corresponding to
1 is not zero, the limiting vector is an eigenvector
corresponding to

=
1: Otherwise, the coefﬁcients all tend to
0 and the limiting vector
is
0: Finally, if

We should note that the cases of the preceding theorem are not quite exhaustive. One
possibility that is not covered is the case that

rem 5.3.1 that for every initial state except a multiple of

without bound. Now if we imagine an initial state to be a random choice of values for
the coefﬁcients
c
1 and
c
2, we see that the probability of selecting
c
2
=
0, is for all prac-
tical purposes,
0: Therefore, with probability

c

from which it follows that the subsequent states will tend to arbitrarily large multiples
of the vector
v

2:2794):
Finally, we can offer some advice to the scientists who are thinking of introducing a
predator bird to control the frog population of this example: don’t do it! Almost any
initial distribution of birds and frogs will result in a population of birds and frogs that
grows without bound. Therefore, we will be stuck with both non-indigenous frogs and
birds. To drive the point home, start with a population of
10;
000 frogs and
100 birds.
In

In view of our eigensystem analysis, we know that these numbers are no ﬂuke. Almost
any initial population will grow similarly. The conclusion is that we should try another
strategy or perhaps leave well enough alone in this ecology.

Conveniently, we have already computed the eigenvalues and vectors of
10A in Ex-
ample 5.1.9. There we found eigenvalues

=
3;
10, with corresponding eigenvectors
v
1
=
(1;
 1) and
v
2
=
(4=3;
1), respectively. It follows from Example 5.1.9 that the
eigenvalues of
A are

=
0:3;
1, with the same eigenvectors. Therefore
1 is the dom-
inant eigenvalue. Any initial state will necessarily involve
v
2 nontrivially, since mul-
tiples of
v
1 are not probability distribution vectors (the entries are of opposite signs).
Thus we may apply part 3 of Theorem 5.3.1 to conclude that for any initial state, the
only possible nonzero limiting state vector is some multiple of
v
2
: Which multiple?
Since the sum of the entries of each state vector sum to
1, the same must be true of the
initial vector. Since

Compare this vector with the result obtained by direct calculation in Example 2.2.5.
When do complex eigenvalues occur and what do they mean? In general, all we can say
is that the characteristic polynomial of a matrix, even if it is real, may have complex
roots. This is an unavoidable fact, but it can be instructive. To see how this is so,
consider the following example.
EXAMPLE 5.3.4. Suppose that a discrete dynamical system has transition matrix
A

a

; where
a is a positive real number. What can be said about the states

:
: if the initial state
x
(0) is an arbitrary nonzero vector?
SOLUTION. The eigenvalues of
A are
ai: Now if
a
<
1 then according to part 1 of
Theorem 5.3.1 the limiting state is
0: Part 3 of that theorem cannot occur for our matrix
A since
1 cannot be an eigenvalue. So suppose
a

1: Since the eigenvalues of
A are
distinct, there is an invertible matrix
P such that
P

if

We know that

k
x

: In view of the above equation, we see that the states
x
k
will oscillate around the origin. In the case that
a
=
1 we expect the states to remain
bounded, but if
a
>
1; we expect the values to become unbounded and oscillate in sign.
This oscillation is fairly typical of what happens when complex eigenvalues are present,
though it need not be as rapid as in this example.
Non-Diagonalizable Transition Matrix
How can a matrix be non-diagonalizable? All the examples we have considered so
far suggest that non-diagonalizability is the same as being defective. Put another way,
diagonalizable equals non-defective. This is exactly right, as the following shows.
THEOREM 5.3.5. The matrix
A is diagonalizable if and only if it is non-defective.
PROOF. Suppose that the
n

n matrix
A is diagonalizable. According to the di-
agonalization theorem, there exists a complete linearly independent set of eigenvectors
v
1
;
v
2
;
:
:
:
v
n of the matrix
A: The number of these vectors belonging to a given eigen-
value
 of
A is a number
d() at most the geometric multiplicity of
, since they form a
basis of the eigenspace
E

(A): Hence their number is at most the algebraic multiplicity
m() of
 by Theorem 5.1.16. Since sum of all the numbers
d
() is
n, as is the sum of

236
5. THE EIGENVALUE PROBLEM
all the algebraic multiplicities
m(), it follows that the sum of the geometric multiplic-
ities must also be
n: The only way for this to happen is that for each eigenvalue
, we
have that geometric multiplicity equals algebraic multiplicity. Thus,
A is non-defective.
Conversely, if
A is non-defective, we can produce
m() linearly independent eigen-
vectors belonging to each eigenvalue
: Assemble all of these vectors and we have
n
eigenvectors such that for any eigenvalue
 of
A, the subset of all these vectors belong-
ing to
 is linearly independent. Therefore, the entire set of eigenvectors is linearly
independent by the remark following Theorem 5.2.11. Now apply the diagonalization
theorem to obtain that
A is diagonalizable.
The last item of business in our examination of diagonalization is to prove part 2 of
Theorem 5.1.16, which asserts:
For each eigenvalue
 of
A, if
m() is the algebraic multiplicity of
, then
1

what we wanted to prove.
Our newfound insight into non-diagonalizablematrices is somewhat of a negative nature
– they are defective. Unfortunately, this isn’t much help in determining the behavior of
discrete dynamical systems with a non-diagonalizable transition matrix. If matrices are
not diagonalizable, what simple kind of matrix are they reducible to? There is a very
nice answer to this question; this answer requires the notion of a Jordan block, which
can be deﬁned as a

where the entries off the main diagonal and ﬁrst super-diagonal are understood to be
zeros. This matrix is very close to being a diagonal matrix. Its true value comes from
the following classical theorem, the proof of which is somewhat beyond the scope of
this text. We refer the reader to the textbooks [7] or [6] of the bibliography for a proof.
These texts are an excellent references for higher level linear algebra and matrix theory.
THEOREM 5.3.6.
Every matrix
A is similar to a block diagonal matrix which consists
Jordan

Theorem
of Jordan blocks down the diagonal. Moreover, these blocks are uniquely determined
by
A up to order.
In particular, if
J
=
S
 1
AS, where
J consists of Jordan blocks down the diagonal, we
call
J “the” Jordan canonical form of the matrix
A: This is a slight abuse of language,
since the order of occurrence of the Jordan blocks of
J could vary. To ﬁx ideas, let’s
consider an example.
EXAMPLE 5.3.7. Find all possible Jordan canonical forms for a

5. THE EIGENVALUE PROBLEM
Notice that if all Jordan blocks are
1

1, then the Jordan canonical form of a matrix is
simply a diagonal matrix. Thus, another way to say that a matrix is diagonalizable is to
say that its Jordan blocks are
1

1: In reference to the previous example, we see that if
the matrix has the ﬁrst Jordan canonical form, then it is diagonalizable, while if it has
the second, it is non-diagonalizable.
Now suppose that the matrix
A is a transition matrix for a discrete dynamical system
and
A is not diagonalizable. What can one say? For one thing, the Jordan canonical
form can be used to recover part 1 of Theorem 5.3.1. Part 4 remains valid as well; the
proof we gave does not depend on
A being diagonalizable. Unfortunately, things are
a bit more complicated as regards parts (2) and (3). In fact, they fail to be true, as the
following example shows.
EXAMPLE 5.3.8. Let
A

1 are not a bounded sequence, so that part
2 of the theorem fails to be true. Also, the sequence of vectors
x
(k
) does not converge
to any vector in spite of the fact that
1 is the largest eigenvalue of
A: Thus (3) fails as
well.
In spite of this example, the news is not all negative. It can be shown by way of the
Jordan canonical form that a weaker version of (3) holds: if
(A)
=
1;
1 is the only
eigenvalue of
A of absolute value
1 and the eigenvalue
1 has multiplicity
1; then the
conclusion of (3) in Theorem 5.3.1 holds.

5.4. Orthogonal Diagonalization
Orthogonal and unitary matrices are particularly attractive when we have to deal with
inverses. Recall that one situation which calls for an inverse matrix is that of diago-
nalization. For
A is diagonalizable when there exists an invertible matrix
P such that
P
 1
AP is a diagonal matrix. We are going to explore some very remarkable facts
about Hermitian and real symmetric matrices. These matrices are diagonalizable, and
moreover, diagonalization can be accomplished by a unitary (orthogonal if
A is real)
matrix. This means that
P
 1
AP
=
P
H
AP is diagonal. In this situation we say that
the matrix
A is unitarily (orthogonally) diagonalizable.
Eigenvalue of Hermitian Matrices
As a ﬁrst step, we need to observe a curious property of Hermitian matrices. It turns
out that their eigenvalues are guaranteed to be real, even if the matrix itself is complex.
This is one reason that these matrices are so nice to work with.
THEOREM 5.4.1. If
A is a Hermitian matrix, then the eigenvalues of
A are real.

5.4. ORTHOGONAL DIAGONALIZATION

PROOF. Let
 be an eigenvalue of
A with corresponding nonzero eigenvector
x,
so that
Ax
=

Hence the eigenvalues of

Caution: Although the eigenvalues of a Hermitian matrix are guaranteed to be real, the
eigenvectors may not be real unless the matrix in question is real.
The Principal Axes Theorem
A key fact about Hermitian matrices is the so-called principal axes theorem; its proof
is a simple consequence of the Schur triangularization theorem which is proved in Sec-
tion 5.5. We will content ourselves here with stating the theorem and supplying a proof
for the case that the eigenvalues of
A are distinct. This proof also shows us one way to
carry out the diagonalization process.
THEOREM 5.4.3.
Every Hermitian matrix is unitarily diagonalizable, and every real
Principal Axes
Theorem
Hermitian matrix is orthogonally diagonalizable.
PROOF. Let us assume that the eigenvalues of the
n

A are real. Let these
eigenvalues be

Theorem, namely the matrix

The proof we have just given suggests a practical procedure for diagonalizing a Her-
mitian or real symmetric matrix. The only additional information that we need for the
complete procedure is advice on what to do if the eigenvalue
 is repeated. This is a
sticky point.What we need to do in this case is ﬁnd an orthogonal basis of the eigenspace
E

(A)
=
N
(A
 I
): It is always possible to ﬁnd such a basis using the so-called Gram-
Schmidt algorithm, which is discussed in Chapter 6 or the modiﬁed Gram-Schmidt al-
gorithm discussed on Page 208. For the hand calculations that we do in this chapter, the
worst situation that we will encounter is that the eigenspace
E
 is two-dimensional, say
with a basis

: The main
object of this section is to prove a famous theorem in linear algebra which provides a
nice answer to the following question: if we only wish to use orthogonal (or unitary)
matrices as similarity transformation matrices, what is the simplest form to which a
given matrix
A can be transformed. It would be nice if we could say something like
“diagonal” or “Jordan canonical form.” Unfortunately, neither is possible. However,
upper triangular matrices are very nice special forms of matrices. In particular, we can
see the eigenvalues of an upper triangular matrix at a glance. That makes the follow-
ing theorem extremely attractive. Its proof is also very interesting, in that it actually
suggests an algorithm for computing the so-called Schur triangular form.

THEOREM 5.5.1.
Let A be an arbitrary square matrix. Then there exists a unitary

matrix
U such that

AU is an upper triangular matrix. If
A and its eigenvalues are
real, then
U can be chosen to be orthogonal.
PROOF. We will show how to triangularize
A one column at time. First we show
how to start the process. Compute an eigenvalue

1 of
A and a corresponding eigenvec-
tor
w of unit length in the standard norm. We may assume that the ﬁrst coordinate of
w
is real. If not, replace
w by
e
 i
w where
 is a polar argument of the ﬁrst coordinate
of
w
: This does not affect the length of
w and any multiple of
w is still an eigenvector
of
A. Now let
v
=
w
 e
1, where
e

=
(1;
0;
:

0). We make the convention that
H

: Form the (possibly complex) Householder matrix
H
v
: Since
w

e
1 is real,
it follows from Exercise 3 that
H
v
w
=
e
1
: Now recall that Householder matrices are
unitary and symmetric, so that
H

This new matrix is upper triangular in the ﬁrst
k
+
1 columns, so we can continue in
this fashion until we reach the last column, at which point we set
U
=
V
n to obtain that
U
H
AU is upper triangular. Finally, notice that if the eigenvalues and eigenvectors that
we calculate are real, which would certainly be the case if
A and the eigenvalues of
A
were real, then the Householder matrices used in the proof are all real, so that the matrix
U is orthogonal.

5. THE EIGENVALUE PROBLEM
Of course, the upper triangular matrix
T and triangularizing matrix
U are not unique.
Nonetheless, this is a very powerful theorem. Consider what it says in the case that
A
is Hermitian: the Principal Axes Theorem is a simple special case of it.
COROLLARY 5.5.2. Every Hermitian matrix is unitarily (orthogonally, if the matrix is
Principal Axes
Theorem
real) diagonalizable.
PROOF. Let
A be Hermitian. According to the Schur triangularization theorem
there is a unitary matrix
U such that
U
H
AU
=
R is upper triangular. We check that
R
H
=
 U
H
AU

H
=
U
H
A
H
 U
H

H
=
U
H
AU
=
R
:
Therefore
R is both upper and lower triangular. This makes
R a diagonal matrix and
proves the theorem, except for the fact that
U may be chosen orthogonal if
A is real. To
see this last fact, notice that if
A is real symmetric, then
A and its eigenvalues are real,
so according to the triangularization theorem,
U can be chosen orthogonal.
As a last application of the Schur triangularization theorem, we show the real signiﬁ-
cance of normal matrices. This term has appeared in several exercises. Recall that a
(square) matrix
A is normal if
A
H
A
=
AA
H
:
COROLLARY 5.5.3. A matrix is unitarily diagonalizable if and only if it is normal.
PROOF. It is easy to see that every unitarily diagonalizable matrix is normal. We
leave this as an exercise.
Let
A be normal. According to the Schur triangularization theorem there is a unitary
matrix
U such that
U
H
AU
=
R is upper triangular. But then we have that
R
H
=
U
H

Therefore
R commutes with
R
H
; which means that
R is diagonal by Exercise . This
completes the proof.
Our last application of Schur’s theorem is a far reaching generalization of Theorem 5.1.5.
COROLLARY 5.5.4. Let
f
(x) and
g
(x) be polynomials and
A a square matrix such that
g
(A) is invertible (e.g., g(x)=1). Then the eigenvalues of the matrix

the form

5.6. *The Singular Value Decomposition
The object of this section is to develop yet one more factorization of a matrix that tells
us a lot about the matrix. For simplicity, we stick with the case of a real matrix
A
and orthogonal matrices. However, the factorization we are going to discuss can be
done with complex
A and unitary matrices. This factorization is called the singular
value decomposition (SVD for short). It has a long history in matrix theory, but was
popularized in the sixties as a powerful computational tool. Here is the basic question
that it answers: if multiplication on one side can produce an upper triangular matrix, as
in the QR factorization, how simple a matrix can be produced by multiplying on each
side by a (possibly different) orthogonal matrix? The answer, as you might guess, is a

248
5. THE EIGENVALUE PROBLEM
matrix that is both upper and lower triangular, that is, diagonal. However, veriﬁcation
of this fact is much more subtle than that of one sided factorizations such as the QR
factorization. Here is the key result:

B

is symmetric and its eigenvalues are nonnegative (we leave these facts as exercises).

Computation of Eigensystems
Nowadays, one can use a MAS like MATLAB or Octave on a home PC to ﬁnd a com-
plete eigensystem for, say a

100 matrix, in less than a second. That’s pretty
remarkable and, to some extent, a tribute to the fast cheap hardware commonly avail-
able to the public. But hardware is only part of the story. Bad computational algorithms
can bring the fastest computer to its knees. The rest of the story concerns the remark-
able developments in numerical linear algebra over the past 50 years which have given
us fast reliable algorithms for eigensystem calculation. We can only scratch the surface
of these developments in this brief discussion. At the outset, we rule out the methods
developed in this chapter as embodied in the eigensystem algorithm (Page 216). These
are for simple hand calculations and theoretical purposes. See the polynomial equations
project that follows this discussion for some more comments about root ﬁnding.

5.7. *COMPUTATIONAL NOTES AND PROJECTS

We are going to examine some iterative methods for selectively ﬁnding eigenpairs of a
real matrix whose eigenvalues are real and distinct. Hence the matrix
A is diagonaliz-
able. The hypothesis of diagonalizability may seem too constraining, but there is this
curious aphorism that “numerically every matrix is diagonalizable.” The reason is as
follows: once you perform store and numerical calculations on the entries of
A, you
perturb them a small essentially random amount. This has the effect of perturbing the
eigenvalues of the calculated
A a small random amount. Thus, the probability that any
two eigenvalues of
A are numerically equal is quite small. To focus matters, consider
the test matrix
A

Just for the record, the actual eigenvalues of
A are
 2;
1 and
5 (see Exercise 1 for an
explanation). Now we ask three questions about
A
:
(1) How can we get a ballpark estimate of the location of the eigenvalues of
A?
(2) How can we estimate the dominant eigenpair (;
x) of
A? (Dominant means that

is larger in absolute value than any other eigenvalue of
A.
(3) Given a good estimate of any eigenvalue
 of
A; how can we improve the estimate
and compute a corresponding eigenvector?
One answer to question (1) is the following theorem, which predates modern numerical
analysis, but has proved to be quite useful. Because it helps locate eigenvalues, it is
called a “localization theorem.”

Notice, that the eigenvector looks a lot like a multiple of

looks a lot like

Finally, we turn to question (3). One answer to it is contained in the following algorithm,
known as the inverse iteration method.

Notice that the inverse iteration method is simply the power method applied to the ma-
trix
(A
 I
)
 1
: In fact, it is sometimes called the inverse power method. The scalar
 is called a shift. Here is the secret of success for this method: we assume that
 is
closer to a deﬁnite eigenvalue
 of
A than to any other eigenvalue. But we don’t want
too much accuracy! We need

6=
. Theorem 5.1.5 in Section 1 of this chapter shows
that the eigenvalues of the matrix
A
 I are of the form

  where
 runs over the
eigenvalues of
A: Thus the matrix
A
 I is nonsingular since no eigenvalue is zero,
and Exercise 11 shows us that the eigenvalues of
(A
 I
)
 1 are of the form
1=(
 )
where
 runs over the eigenvalues of
A: Since
 is closer to
 than to any other eigen-
value of
A; the eigenvalue
1=(
 ) is the dominant eigenvalue of
(A
 I
)
 1
; which
is exactly what we need to make the power method work on
(A
 I
)
 1
: Indeed, if

is very close (but not equal!) to
 convergence should be very rapid.
In a general situation, we could now have the Gershgorin circle theorem team up with
inverse iteration. Gershgorin would put us in the right ballpark for values of
 and
inverse iteration would ﬁnish the job. Let’s try this with our test matrix and choices of

in the interval
[ 21;
17] suggested by Gershgorin. Let’s try

=

in tabular form.

There is much more to modern eigenvalue algorithms than we have indicated here. Cen-
tral topics include deﬂation, the QR algorithm, numerical stability analysis and many
other issues. The interested reader might consult more advanced text such as references
such as [5], [4], [8] or [3], to name a few.
Project Topics
Project: Solving Polynomial Equations
In homework problems we solve for the roots of the characteristic polynomial in order
to get eigenvalues. To this end we can use algebra methods or even Newton’s method
for numerical approximations to the roots. This is the conventional wisdom usually
proposed in introductory linear algebra. But for larger problems than the simple
2

2
or
3

3 matrices we encounter, this method can be too slow and inaccurate. In fact,
numerical methods hiding under the hood in a MAS (and some CASs) for ﬁnding eigen-
values are so efﬁcient that it is better to turn this whole procedure on its head. Rather

A and
B are similar matrices, i.e.,

S for

5. THE EIGENVALUE PROBLEM
Now you have the necessary machinery for determining numerically the Jordan canon-
ical form. As a ﬁrst step, one can use a CAS or MAS to ﬁnd the eigenvalues of
A: Of
course, these will only be approximate, so one has to decide how many eigenvalues are
really repeated.
Next, one has to determine the number of Jordan blocks of a given type. Suppose
 is
an eigenvalue and ﬁnd the rank of various powers of
A
 I
: It would help greatly in
understanding how all this counts blocks if you ﬁrst experiment with a matrix already

Project: Classiﬁcation of Quadratic Forms
Recall from calculus that in order to classify all quadratic equations in x and y one went
through roughly three steps. First, do a rotation transformation of coordinates to get rid
of mixed terms like, say,
2xy in the quadratic equation
x
2
+
2xy
 y
2
+
x
 3y
=
4:
Second, do a translation of coordinates to put the equation in a “standard form.” Third,
identify the curve by your knowledge of the shape of a curve in the given standard
form. Standard forms were equations like
x
2
=4
+
y
2
=2
=
1: Also recall from your
calculus study of the conics that it was the second degree terms alone that determined
the nature of a quadratic. For example, the second degree terms of the equation above
are
x
2
+
2xy
 y
2
: The discriminant of the equation was determined by these terms. In
this case the discriminant is 8, which tells us that the curve represented by this equation
is a hyperbola. Finally, recall that when it came to quadric equations, i.e., quadratic
equations in 3 unknowns, your text simply provided some examples in “standard form”
(six of them to be exact) and maybe mumbled something about this list being essentially
all surfaces represented by quadric equations.
Now you are ready for the rest of the story. Just as with curves in x and y, the basic
shape of the surface of a quadric equation in x, y and z is determined by the second
degree terms. Since this is so, we will focus on an example with no ﬁrst degree terms,
namely,
Q(x;
y
;
z
)
=
2x
2
+
4y
2
+
6z
2
 4xy
 2xz
+
2y
z
=
1:
The problem is simply this: ﬁnd a change of coordinates that will make it clear which
of the six standard forms is represented by this surface.
Here is how to proceed:
ﬁrst you must express the so-called “quadratic form”
Q(x;
y
;
z
) in matrix form as
Q(x;
y
;
z
)
=
[x;
y
;
z
]A[x;
y
;
z
]
T
: It is easy to ﬁnd such matrices
A: But any such
A
won’t do. Next, you must replace
A by the equivalent matrix
(A
+
A
T
)=2: (Check
that if
A speciﬁes the quadratic form
Q, then so will
(A
+
A
T
)=2:) The advantage of
this latter matrix is that it is symmetric. Now our theory of symmetric matrices can be
brought to bear. In particular, we know that there is an orthogonal matrix
P such that
P
T
AP is diagonal, provided
A is symmetric. So make the linear change of variables
[x;
y
;
z
]
T
=
P
[x
0
;
y
0
;
z
0
]
T and get that
Q(x;
y
;
z
)
=
[x
0
;
y
0
;
z
0
]P
T
AP
[x
0
;
y
0
;
z
0
]
T
: But
when the matrix in the middle is diagonal, we end up with squares of
x
0,
y
0 and
z
0, and
no mixed terms.
Use the computer algebra system available to you to calculate a symmetric
A and to
ﬁnd the eigenvalues of this
A: From this data alone you will be able to classify the

5.7. *COMPUTATIONAL NOTES AND PROJECTS
257
surface represented by the above equation. Also ﬁnd unit length eigenvectors for each
eigenvalue. Put these together to form the desired orthogonal matrix
P which eliminates
mixed terms.
An outstanding reference on this topic and many others relating to matrix analysis is the
recently republished textbook [1] by Richard Bellman which is widely considered to be
a classic in the ﬁeld.
A Report Topic: Management of Sheep Populations
Description of the problem: You are working for the New Zealand Department of Agri-
culture on a project for sheep farmers. The species of sheep that these shepherds raise
have a life-span of 12 years. Of course, some live longer but they are sufﬁciently few in
number and their reproductive rate is so low that they may be ignored in your popula-
tion study. Accordingly, you divide sheep into 12 age classes, namely those in the ﬁrst
year of life, etc. You have conducted an extensive survey of the demographics of this
species of sheep and obtained the following information about the demographic param-
eters
a
i and
b
i, where
a
i is the reproductive rate for sheep in the
ith age class and
b
i is
the survival rate for sheep in that age class, i.e., the fraction of sheep in that age class
that survive to the
i
+
1th class. (As a matter of fact, this table is related to real data.
The interested reader might consult the article [2] in the bibliography.)

The problem is as follows: in order to maintain a constant population of sheep, shep-
herds will harvest a certain number of sheep each year. Harvesting need not mean
slaughter; it can be accomplished by selling animals to other shepherds, for example. It
simply means removing sheep from the population. Denote the fraction of sheep which
are removed from the
ith age group at the end of each growth period (a year in our case)
by
h
i
: If these numbers are constant from year to year, they constitute a harvesting
policy. If, moreover, the yield of each harvest, i.e., total number of animals harvested
each year, is a constant and the age distribution of the remaining populace is essentially
constant after each harvest, then the harvesting policy is called sustainable. If all the
h
i’s are the same, say
h, then the harvesting policy is called uniform. An advantage
of uniform policies is that they are simple to implement: One selects the sheep to be
harvested at random.
Your problem: Find a uniform sustainable harvesting policy to recommend to shep-
herds, and ﬁnd the resulting distribution of sheep that they can expect with this policy.
Shepherds who raise sheep for sale to markets are also interested in a sustainable pol-
icy that gives a maximum yield. If you can ﬁnd such a policy that has a larger annual
yield than the uniform policy, then recommend it. On the other hand, shepherds who
raise sheep for their wool may prefer to minimize the annual yield. If you can ﬁnd a
sustainable policy whose yield is smaller than that of the uniform policy, make a recom-
mendation accordingly. In each case ﬁnd the expected distribution of your harvesting
policies. Do you think there are optimum harvesting policies of this type? Do you

0: The facts you
need to know (and may assume as standard facts about Leslie matrices) are as follows:
such a matrix will have exactly one positive eigenvalue which turns out to be a simple
eigenvalue (not repeated). Moreover, if at least two adjacent entries of the ﬁrst row
are positive, this eigenvalue will be a dominant eigenvalue, i.e., it is strictly larger than
any other eigenvalue in absolute value. In particular, if the positive eigenvalue is 1,
then starting from any nonzero initial state with nonnegative entries, successive states
converge to an eigenvector belonging to the eigenvalue 1 which has all nonnegative
entries. Scale this vector by dividing it by the sum of its components and one obtains
an eigenvector which is a probability distribution vector, i.e., its entries are nonnegative
and sum to 1. The entries of this vector give the long term distribution of the population
in the various age classes.
In regards to harvesting, let
H be a diagonal matrix with the harvest fractions
h

the diagonal. (Here

is applicable to any harvesting policy, uniform or not. However, in the case of uniform

CHAPTER 6
GEOMETRICAL ASPECTS OF ABSTRACT SPACES
Two basic ideas that we learn in geometry are that of length of a line segment and angle
between lines. We have already seen how to extend the ideas to the standard vector
spaces. The objective of this chapter is to extend these powerful ideas to general linear
spaces. A surprising number of concepts and techniques that we learned in a standard
setting can be carried over, almost word for word, to more general vector spaces. Once
this is accomplished, we will be able to use our geometrical intuition in entirely new
ways. For example, we will be able to have notions of length and perpendicularity for
nonstandard vectors such as functions in a function space. Another application is that
we will be able to give a sensible meaning to the size of the error incurred in solving
a linear system with ﬁnite precision arithmetic. There are many more uses for this
abstraction, as we shall see.
6.1. Normed Linear Spaces
Deﬁnitions and Examples
The basic function of a norm is to measure length and distance, independent of any other
considerations, such as angles or orthogonality. There are different ways to accomplish
such a measurement. One method of measuring length might be more natural for a
given problem, or easier to calculate than another. For these reasons, we would like to
have the option of using different methods of length measurement. You may recognize
the properties listed below from earlier in the text; they are the basic norm laws given in
Section 4.1 of Chapter 4 for the standard norm. We are going to abstract the norm idea
to arbitrary vector spaces.

DEFINITION 6.1.2. A vector space
V , together with a norm
jjjj on the space
V , is
called a normed linear space.

6. GEOMETRICAL ASPECTS OF ABSTRACT SPACES
Notice that if
V is a normed linear space and
W is any subspace of
V , then
W automat-
ically becomes a normed linear space if we simply use the norm of
V on elements of
W
: For obviously all the norm laws still hold, since they hold for elements of the bigger
space
V
:
Of course, we have already studied some very important examples of normed linear
spaces, namely the standard vector spaces
R
n and
C

with the standard norms given by

Notice that when
p
=

important case is that in which
p
=
1 which gives (not surprisingly) the so-called
1-
norm. The last important instance of a
p-norm is one that isn’t so obvious:
p
=
1: It
turns out that the value of this norm is the limit of
p-norms as
p

simple, we’ll supply a separate deﬁnition for this norm.

It may seem a bit odd at ﬁrst to speak of the same vector as having different lengths. You
should take the point of view that choosing a norm is a bit like choosing a measuring
stick. If you choose a yard stick, you won’t measure the same number as you would by
using a meter stick on the same object.

Unit Vectors
Sometimes it is convenient to deal with vectors whose length is one. Such a vector is
called a unit vector. We saw in Chapter 3 that it is easy to concoct a unit vector
u in the
same direction as a given nonzero vector
v when using the standard norm, namely take
u
=
v
jjv
j
j
(6.1.1)
The same formula holds for any norm whatsoever because of norm property (2).
EXAMPLE 6.1.7. Construct a unit vector in the direction of
v
=
(1;
 3;
2;
 1), where
the
1-norm,
2-norm, and
1-norms are used to measure length.
SOLUTION. We already calculated each of the norms of
v in Example 6.1.5. Use these
numbers in Equation 6.1.1 to obtain unit length vectors

From a geometric point of view there are certain sets of vectors in the vector space
V
that tell us a lot about distances. These are the so-called balls about a vector (or point)
v
0 of radius
r whose deﬁnition is as follows:
B
r
(v
0
)
=
f
v

V
j
jjv
 v

r
g
Sometimes these are called closed balls, as opposed to open balls which are deﬁned by
using strict inequality. Here is a situation in which these balls are very helpful: imagine
trying to ﬁnd the distance from a given vector
v
0 to a closed (this means it contains
all points on its boundary) set
S of vectors which need not be a subspace. One way to
accomplish this is to start with a ball centered at
v
0 such that the ball avoids
S: Then
expand this ball by increasing its radius until you have found a least radius
r such that
the ball
B
r
(v
0
) intersects
S nontrivially. Then the distance from
v
0 to this set is this

264
6. GEOMETRICAL ASPECTS OF ABSTRACT SPACES
number
r
: Actually, this is a reasonable deﬁnition of the distance from
v
0 to the set
S:
One expects these balls, for a given norm, to have the same shape, so it is sufﬁcient to
look at the unit balls, that is, the case where
r
=
1:
EXAMPLE 6.1.8. Sketch the unit balls centered at the origin for the
1-norm,
2-norm,
and
1-norms in the space
V
=R
2
:
SOLUTION. In each case it’s easiest to determine the boundary of the ball
B
1
(0), i.e.,
the set of vectors
v
=
(x;
y
) such that
jjv
j
j
=
1: These boundaries are sketched in
Figure 6.1.1 and the ball consists of the boundaries plus the interior of each boundary.
Let’s start with the familiar norm
2-norm. Here the boundary consists of points
(x;
y
)
such that
1
=
jj(x;
y
)j
j
2
=
x
2
+
y
2
which is the familiar circle of radius
1 centered at the origin. Next, consider the
1-norm
in which case
1
=
jj(x;
y
)j
j
1
=
jxj
+
jy
j
It’s easier to examine this formula in each quadrant, where it becomes one of the four
possibilities
x

y
=
1
For example, in the ﬁrst quadrant we get
x
+
y
=
1: These equations give lines which
connect to from a square whose sides are diagonal lines. Finally, for the
1-norm we
have
1
=
jj(x;
y
)j
j
1
=
max
fjxj
;
jy
jg
which gives four horizontal and vertical lines
x
=
1 and
y
=
1 which intersect to
form another square. Thus we see that the unit “balls” for the
1- and
1-norms have
corners, unlike the
2-norm. see Figure 6.1.1 for a picture of these balls.
One more comment about norms.
Recall from Section 4.1 that one of the impor-
tant applications of the norm concept is that it enables us to make sense out of the
idea of limits of vectors.
In a nutshell
lim
n!1
v
n
=
v was taken to mean that
lim
n!1
jjv
n
 v
j
j
=
0: Will we have to have a different notion of limits for dif-
Limit of Vectors
ferent norms? The somewhat surprising answer is “no.” The reason is that given any
two norms
jjjj
a and
jjjj
b on a ﬁnite dimensional vector space, it is always possible to
ﬁnd positive real constants
c and
d such that for any vector
v
jjv

Hence, if
jjv
n
 v
j
j tends to
0 in one norm, it will tend to
0 in the other norm. In this
sense, it can be shown that all norms on a ﬁnite dimensional vector space are equivalent.
Indeed, it can be shown that the condition that
jjv
n
 v
j
j tends to
0 in any one norm
is equivalent to the condition that each coordinate of
v
n converge to the corresponding
coordinate of
v
: We will verify the limit fact in the following example.

lim

6.2. Inner Product Spaces
Deﬁnitions and Examples
We saw in Section 4.2 that the notion of a dot product of two vectors had many handy
applications, including the determination of the angle between two vectors. This dot
product amounted to the “concrete” inner product of the two standard vectors. We now
extend this idea in a setting that allows for real or complex abstract vector spaces.

6.2. INNER PRODUCT SPACES
267
DEFINITION 6.2.1. An (abstract) inner product on the vector space
V is a function
h;
i
which assigns to each pair of vectors
u;
v

V a scalar
h
u;
v
i such that for

and

DEFINITION 6.2.2. A vector space
V , together with an inner product on the space
V ,
is called an inner product space.
Notice that in the case of the more common vector spaces over real scalars, property 2
becomes a commutativity law:
hu;
v
i
=
hv
;
ui
:
Also observe that if
V is an inner product space and
W is any subspace of
V , then
W
automatically becomes an inner product space if we simply use the inner product of
V
on elements of
W
: For obviously all the inner product laws still hold, since they hold
for elements of the bigger space
V
:
Of course, we have the standard examples of inner products, namely the dot products on
R
n and
C
n
: Here is an example of a nonstandard inner product that is useful in certain
engineering problems.
EXAMPLE 6.2.3. For vectors
u

u

) and
v

inner product by the formula
hu;
v
i
=
2u
1
v

+
3u
2
v

Show that this formula satisﬁes the deﬁnition of inner product.
SOLUTION. First we see that
hu;
ui
=
2u
2
1
+
3u
2
2
so the only way for this sum to be
0 is for
u
1
=
u
2
=
0: Hence (1) holds. For (2)
calculate
h
u;
v
i
=
2u

v
1
+
3u
2
v
2
=
2v

u
1
+
3v
2
u
2
=
hv
;
ui
=
h
v
;
ui
since all scalars in question are real. For (3) let
w
=
(w
1
;
w
2
) and calculate
hu;
v
+
w
i
=
2u
1
(v

It follows that this “weighted” inner product is indeed an inner product according to
our deﬁnition. In fact, we can do a whole lot more with even less effort. Consider this
example, of which the preceding is a special case.

then the inner product deﬁned by this matrix is exactly the inner product of Example
6.2.3.
There is an important point to be gleaned from the previous example, namely, that a
given vector space may have more than one inner product on it. In particular,
V
=
R
2
could have the standard inner product – dot products – or something like the previous
example. The space
V , together with each one of these inner products, provide us with
two separate inner product spaces.
Here is a rather more exotic example of an inner product, in that it does not involve one
of standard spaces for its underlying vector space.
EXAMPLE 6.2.5. Let
V
=
C
[0;

[0;

Z

deﬁnes an inner product on the space
V
:

6.2. INNER PRODUCT SPACES

SOLUTION. Certainly
h
f
;
g
i is a real number. Now if
f
(x) is a continuous function then
f
(x)
2 is nonnegative on
[0;
1] and therefore
R

f
(x)
2
dx
=
hf
;
f


0: Furthermore, if
f
(x) is nonzero, then the area under the curve
y
=
f
(
x)
2 must also be positive since
f
(x) will be positive and bounded away from
0 on some subinterval of
[0;
1]: This
establishes property (1) of inner products.
Now let
f

g
(x);
h(x)

: For property (2), notice that

f

which shows that property (4) holds.
Clearly we could similarly deﬁne an inner product on the space
C
[a;
b] of continuous
functions on any ﬁnite interval
[a;
b] just as in the preceding example by changing the
limits of the integrals from
[0;
1] to
[a;
b]: We shall refer to this inner product on a
function space as the standard inner product on a function space.
Following are a few simple facts about inner products that we will use frequently. The
proofs are left to the exercises.

Induced Norms and the CBS Inequality
It is a striking fact that we can accomplish all the goals we set for the standard inner
product with general inner products as well: we can introduce the ideas of angles, or-
thogonality, projections and so forth. We have already seen much of the work that has
to be done, though it was stated in the context of the standard inner products. As a ﬁrst
step, we want to point out that every inner product has a “natural” norm associated with
it.

270
6. GEOMETRICAL ASPECTS OF ABSTRACT SPACES
DEFINITION 6.2.7. Let
V be an inner product space. For vectors
u
2
V , the norm
deﬁned by the equation
jjuj
j
=
p
h
u;
ui
is called the norm induced by the inner product
h;
i on
V
:
As a matter of fact, this idea is not really new. Recall that we introduced the standard
Induced Norm
inner product on
V
=
V
=
R
n or
C
n with an eye towards the standard norm. At the
time it seemed like a nice convenience that the norm could be expressed in terms of the
inner product. It is, and so much so that we have turned this cozy relationship into a
deﬁnition. Is the induced norm really a norm? We have some work to do. The ﬁrst norm
property is easy to verify for the induced norm: from property (1) of inner products we
see that
hu;
ui

0, with equality if and only if
u
=
0: This conﬁrms norm property
(1). Norm property (2) isn’t too hard either: let
c be a scalar and check that
jjcujj
=
p
hcu;
cui
=
p
cc
hu;
ui
=
q
jcj
2
p
hu;
ui
=
jcj
jjujj
Norm property (3), the triangle inequality, remains. This one isn’t easy to verify from
ﬁrst principles. We need a tool that we have seen before, the Cauchy-Bunyakovsky-
Schwarz (CBS) inequality. We restate it below as the next theorem. Indeed, the very
same proof that is given in Theorem 4.2.1 of Chapter 3 carries over word for word
to general inner products over real vector spaces. We need only replace dot products
u

v by abstract inner products
hu;
v
i
: Similarly, the proof of the triangle inequality as
given in Example 4.2.4 of Chapter 3, carries over to establish the triangle inequality for
abstract inner products. Hence property (3) of norms holds for any induced norm.
THEOREM 6.2.8. Let
V be an inner product space. For
u;
v

V , if we use the inner

product of
V and its induced norm, then
j

Just as with the standard dot products, thanks to this inequality, we can formulate the
following deﬁnition.
DEFINITION 6.2.9. For vectors
u;
v
2
V
; an inner product space, we deﬁne the angle

between
u and

 satisfying

We know that

cos
 makes sense.
EXAMPLE 6.2.10. Let
u

(1;

v
=
(1;
1) be vectors in
R
2
: Compute an angle
between these two vectors using the inner product of Example 6.2.3. Compare this to
angle found when one uses the standard inner product in
R

On the other hand, if we use the standard norm then
hu;

from which it follows that
u and

In the previous example, it shouldn’t be too surprising that we can arrive at two different
values for the “angle” between two vectors. Using different inner products to measure
angle is somewhat like measuring length with different norms. Next, we extend the
perpendicularity idea to arbitrary inner product spaces.
DEFINITION 6.2.11. Two vectors
u and
v in the same inner product space are orthog-
onal if
hu;
v
i
=
0:
Note that if
hu;
v
i
=
0; then
hv
;
ui
=
hu;
v
i
=
0: Also, this deﬁnition makes the
zero vector orthogonal to every other vector. It also allows us to speak of things like
“orthogonal functions.” One has to be careful with new ideas like this. Orthogonality
in a function space is not something that can be as easily visualized as orthogonality of
geometrical vectors. Inspecting the graphs of two functions may not be quite enough.
If, however, graphical data is tempered with a little understanding of the particular inner
product in use, orthogonality can be detected.
EXAMPLE 6.2.12. Show that
f
(x)
=
x and
g
(x)
=
x
 2=3 are orthogonal elements
of
C
[0;
1] with the inner product of Example 6.2.5 and provide graphical evidence of
this fact.

)

It follows that
f and
g are orthogonal to each other. For graphical evidence, sketch
f
(x),
g
(x) and
f
(x)g
(x) on the interval
[0;
1] as in Figure 6.2.1. The graphs of
f and
g are not especially enlightening; but we can see in the graph that the area below
f

g
and above the
x-axis to the right of
(2=3;
0) seems to be about equal to the area to the
left of
(2=3;
0) above
f

g and below the
x-axis. Therefore the integral of the product
on the interval
[0;
1] might be expected to be zero, which is indeed the case.
Some of the basic ideas from geometry that fuel our visual intuition extend very ele-
gantly to the inner product space setting. One such example is the famous Pythagorean
Theorem, which takes the following form in an inner product space.

Here is an example of another standard geometrical fact that ﬁts well in the abstract
setting. This is equivalent to the law of parallelograms, which says that the sum of the
squares of the diagonals of a parallelogram is equal to the sum of the squares of all four
sides.

which is what was to be shown.
It would be nice to think that every norm on a vector space is induced from some inner
product. Unfortunately, this is not true, as the following example shows.
EXAMPLE 6.2.15. Use the result of Example 6.2.14 to show that the inﬁnity norm on
V

R

This contradicts Example 6.2.14, so that the inﬁnity norm cannot be induced from an
inner product.
One last example of a geometrical idea that generalizes to inner product spaces is the
notion of projections of one vector along another. The projection formula for vectors of
Chapter 4 works perfectly well for general inner products. Since the proof of this fact
amounts to replacing dot products by inner products in the original formulation of the
theorem (see page 273), we omit it and simply state the result.

Orthogonal Sets of Vectors
We have already seen the development of the ideas of orthogonal sets of vectors and
bases in Chapter 4. Much of this development can be abstracted easily to general inner
product spaces, simply by replacing dot products by inner products. Accordingly, we
can make the following deﬁnition.
DEFINITION 6.2.17. The set of vectors
v
1
;
v
2
;
:
:
:
;
v
n in an inner product space are
said to be an orthogonal set if
h
v
i
;
v
j
i
=
0 whenever
i
6=
j: If, in addition, each vector
has unit length, i.e.,
hv
i
;
v
i
i
=
1 then the set of vectors is said to be an orthonormal set
of vectors.
The proof of the following key fact and its corollary are the same as that of Theo-
rem 6.2.18 in Section 4.3 of Chapter 4. All we have to do is replace dot products by
inner products. The observations that followed the proof of this theorem are valid for
general inner products as well. We omit the proofs and refer the reader to Chapter 4.

Had we used

These polynomials are used extensively in approximation theory and applied mathemat-
ics.

step in the orthogonalizing process, simply replace each vector

SOLUTION. We know that

independent. We leave it to the reader to check that the reduced row echelon form of
A

There are several useful observations about the preceding example which are particu-

 If one encounters an inconvenientfraction, such as the
1
4 in
v

the calculated
v
2 by
4v
2, thereby eliminating the fraction, and yet achieving the
same results in subsequent calculations. The idea here is that for any nonzero

same results.

The Gram-Schmidt algorithm is robust enough to handle linearly dependent spanning
sets gracefully. We illustrate this fact with the following example:
EXAMPLE 6.3.4. Suppose we had used all the columns of
A in Example 6.3.3 instead
of linearly independent ones, labelling them
w

;
w

;
w

;

: How would the Gram-
Schmidt calculation work out?

Interestingly enough, this is the same third vector that we obtained in the example cal-
culation. The upshot of this calculation is that the Gram-Schmidt algorithm can be
applied to any spanning set, provided that one discards any zero vectors that result from
the formula. The net result is still an orthogonal basis.
Application to Projections
We can use the machinery of orthogonal vectors to give a nice solution to a very practical
and important question which can be phrased as follows (see Figure 6.3.1 for a graphical
interpretation of it):
The Projection Problem: Given a ﬁnite dimensional subspace
V of a real inner product
space
W, together with a vector
b
2
W, to ﬁnd the vector
v
2
V which is closest to
b
in the sense that
jj
b
 v
j
j
2 is minimized.
Observe that the quantity
jjb
 v
jj
2 will be minimized exactly when
jjb
 v
j
j is mini-
mized, since the latter is always nonnegative. The squared term has the virtue of avoid-
ing square roots that computing
jjb
 v
j
j requires.
The projection problem looks vaguely familiar. It reminds us of the least squares prob-
lem of Chapter 4, which was to minimize the quantity
jjb
 Axj
j
2where
A is an
m

n
real matrix and
b;
x are standard vectors. Recall that
v
=
Ax is a typical element in
the column space of
A: Therefore, the quantity to be minimized is
jjb
 Axjj
2
=
jj
b
 v
j
j
2
where on the left hand side
x runs over all standard
n-vectors and on the right hand side
v runs over all vectors in the space
V
=
C
(A). The difference between least squares
and projection problem is this: in the least squares problem we want to know the vector
x of coefﬁcients of
v as a linear combination of columns of
A; whereas in the projection

v doesn’t tell us what
x is, but knowing
x easily gives
v since
v

To ﬁnd a solution to the projection problem we need the following key concept.

Notice that in the case of
n
=

of
b along the vector
v
1
: Now we call this the projection of
b into the subspace
V
spanned by
v
1
: This projection has the same nice property that we observed in the case
of standard inner products, namely,
p
=
pro
j
V
b is a multiple of
v
1 which is orthogonal
to
b

see from the next theorem that this is not the case.

write

This proves that there can be only one solution to the projection problem, namely the
one given by the projection formula above.
There is one more point to be established, namely that
pro

b actually solves the
projection problem. This is left to the exercises.
It is worth noting that in proving the preceding theorem, we showed that
pro
j
V
b is
orthogonal to every element of a basis of
V and therefore to every element of
V , since
such elements are linear combinations of the basis elements.
Let us specialize to standard real vectors and inner products and take a closer look at
the formula for the projection operator in the case that

The signiﬁcance of this expression for projections in standard spaces over the reals with
the standard inner product is as follows: computing the projection of a vector into a
subspace amounts to no more than multiplying the vector by a matrix
P which can be
computed from
V
: Even in the case
n
=

pro

v
u
=
(vv

So here we have
P

Projection
Matrices
The general projection matrix
P has some interesting properties. It is symmetric, i.e.,
P
T
=
P
; and idempotent, i.e.,
P
2
=
P
: Therefore, this notation is compatible with the

6.3. GRAM-SCHMIDT ALGORITHM
283
deﬁnition of projection matrix introduced in earlier exercises (see Exercise 8). Symme-
try follows from the fact that

:
It follows that
P
2
=
P
: In general, symmetric idempotent matrices are called projection
matrices. The name is justiﬁed because multiplication by them projects vectors into the
column space of
P
:

The projection problem is closely related to another problem that we have seen before,
namely the least squares problem of Section 4.2 in Chapter 4. Recall that the least
squares problem amounted to minimizing the function
f
(x)
=
jjb
 Axjj
2, which in
turn led to the normal equations. Here
A is an
m

n real matrix. Now consider the
projection problem for the subspace
V
=
C
(A) of
R
m, where
b
2
R
m
: We know
that elements of
C
(A) can be written in the form
v
=
Ax, where
x
2
R
n
: Therefore,
jjb
 Axjj
2
=
jjb
 v
jj
2, where
v ranges over elements of
V
: It follows that when we
solve a least squares problem, we are solving a projection problem as well in the sense
that the vector
Ax is the element of
C
(A) closest to the right hand side vector
b: One
could also develop normal equations for general spanning sets of
V
: An example of this
is given in the exercises.
The normal equations also give us another way to generate projection matrices in the
case of standard vectors and inner products. As above, let the subspace
V
=
C
(A)
of
R
m, and
b
2
R
m
: Assume that
V
=
C
(A) and that the columns of
A are linearly
independent, i.e., that
A has full column rank. Then, as we have seen in Theorem 4.2.11
of Chapter 3, the matrix
A
T
A is invertible and the normal equations
A
T
Ax
=
A
T
b
have the unique solution
x
=
(A

A

It is also true that

example. What is the explanation? Notice that

w

the same, but speciﬁed by different bases. Therefore we should expect the projection
operator to be the same.

6.4. Linear Systems Revisited
Once again, we revisit our old friend,
Ax
=
b, where
A is an
m

n matrix. The notions
of orthogonality can be made to shed still more light on the nature of this system of
equations, especially in the case of a homogeneous system
Ax
=
0: The
kth entry of
the column vector
Ax is simply the
kth row of
A multiplied by the column vector
x:
Designate this row by
r
k and we see that
r
k

x
=
0;
k
=

:
:
:
;
n:
In other words,
Ax
=
0, that is,
x
2
N
(A), precisely when
x is orthogonal (with the
standard inner product) to every row of
A: We will see in Theorem 6.4.4 below that this
means that
x will be orthogonal to any linear combination of the rows of
A: Thus, we
could say
N
(A)
=

R

x
=

R(A)g
(6.4.1)
This is an instance of a very important idea. We are going to digress to put this idea
in a more general context, after which we will return to linear systems with a new
perspective on their meaning.
Orthogonal Complements and Homogeneous Systems
DEFINITION 6.4.1. Let
V be a subspace of an inner product space
W
: Then the orthog-
onal complement of
V in
W is the set
V
?
=
fw
2
W
j
hv
;
w
i
=
0
for all
v
2
V
g
We can see from the subspace test that
V
? is a subspace of
W
: Before stating the basic
facts, we mention that if
U and
V are two subspaces of the vector space
W, then two
other subspaces that we can construct are the intersection and sum of these subspaces.
The former is just the set intersection of the two subspaces and the latter is the set of
elements of the form
u
+
v, where
u
2
U, and
v
2
V
: One can use the subspace test
to verify that these are indeed subspaces of
W (see Exercise 15 of Section 2, Chapter 3.
In fact, it isn’t too hard to see that
U
+
V is the smallest space containing all elements
of both
U and
V
: We can summarize the basic facts about the orthogonal complement
of
V as follows.
THEOREM 6.4.2. Let
V be a subspace of the ﬁnite dimensional inner product space
W
:
Then the following are true:

since
W is closed under sums. Now suppose that

: Let
v

w
: We know
that
v

V and
w
 v is orthogonal to every element of

: It follows that
w

V
?
:
Therefore every element of
W can be expressed as a sum of an element in
V and an
element in
V
?
: This shows that
W

V

V

V

:
To prove 4, let

Certainly the union of the two sets spans

of linear dependence, we could gather all terms involving
v

There is a very useful fact about the orthogonal complement of a ﬁnite dimensional
space that greatly simpliﬁes the calculation of an orthogonal complement. What it says
in words is that a vector is orthogonal to every element of a vector space if and only if
it is orthogonal to every element of a spanning set of the space.

Finally, we return to the subject of solutions to the homogeneous system
Ax
=
b: We
saw at the beginning of this section that the null space of
A consisted of elements that
are orthogonal to the rows of
A: One could turn things around and ask what we can say
about a vector that is orthogonal to every element of the null space of
A: How does it
relate to the rows of
A? This question has a surprisingly simple answer. In fact, there is
a fascinating interplay between row spaces, column spaces and null spaces which can
be summarized in the following theorem:
THEOREM 6.4.7. Let
A be a matrix. Then
Orthogonal
Complements
Theorem
1.
R(A)
?
=
N
(A)
2.
N
(A)
?
=
R(A)
3.
N
(A
T
)
?
=
C
(A)
PROOF. We have already seen item 1 in the discussion at the beginning of this sec-
tion, where it was stated in Equation 6.4.1. For item 2 we take orthogonal complements
of both sides of 1 and use part 5 of Theorem 6.4.2 to obtain that
N
(A)
?
=
 R(A)
?

?
=
R(A)
which proves 2. Finally, for 3 we observe that
R(A
T
)
=
C
(A): Apply 2 with
A
T in
place of
A and the result follows.
The connections spelled out by this theorem are powerful ideas. Here is one example of
how they can be used. Consider the following problem: suppose we are given subspaces
U and
V of the standard space
R
n with the standard inner product (the dot product) in
some concrete form, and we want to compute a basis for the subspace
U
\
V . How do we
proceed? One answer is to use part 1 of Theorem 6.4.3 to see that
(U
\
V
)
?
=
U
?
+
V
?
:
Now use part 5 of Theorem 6.4.2 to obtain that
U
\
V
=
(U
\
V
)
?
?
=
(U
?
+
V
?
)
?
The strategy that this equation suggests is as follows: express
U and
V as row spaces
of matrices and compute bases for the null spaces of each. Put these bases together to
obtain a spanning set for
U
?
+
V
?
: Use this spanning set as the rows of a matrix
B
:
Then the complement of this space is, on the one hand,
U
\
V
; but by the ﬁrst part of
the orthogonal complements theorem, it is also
N
(B
): Therefore
U
\
V
=
N
(B
); so
all we have to do is calculate a basis for
N
(B
); which we know how to do.
EXAMPLE 6.4.8. Find a basis for
U
\
V
; where these subspaces of
R
4 are given as
follows:
U
=
span
f(1;

(0;

V
=

0) and
( 2;
1;
0;

Our last application of the orthogonal complements theorem is another Fredholm alter-
native theorem (compare this to Corollary 2.5.10 of Chapter 2).
COROLLARY 6.4.9. Given a square real linear system
Ax

Fredholm
Alternative
the system is consistent or there is a solution
y to the homogeneous system
A
T
y

y

b

PROOF. Let
V
=
C
(A): By part 3 of Theorem 6.4.2,
R
n
=
V
+
V
?
; where
R
n
has the standard inner product. From part 3 of the orthogonal complements theorem,
C
(A)
=
N
(A
T
)
?
: Take complements again and use part 5 of Theorem 6.4.2 to get
that
V
?
=
N
(A
T
): Now the system either has a solution or not. If the system has no
solution, then by Theorem 3.6.1 of Chapter 3,
b does not belong to
V
=
C
(A): Since
b

b
=
v

y

y

b

On the other hand, if the system has a solution
x, then for any vector
y
2
N
(A) we
have
y
T
Ax

y
T
b: It follows that if
y
T
A

y
T
b
=
0: This completes the
proof.

6.4. LINEAR SYSTEMS REVISITED

The QR Factorization
We are going to use orthogonality ideas to develop one more way of solving the linear
system
Ax
=
b; where the
m

n real matrix
A is full column rank. In fact, if the
system is inconsistent, then this method will ﬁnd the unique least squares solution to
the system. Here is the basic idea: express the matrix
A in the form
A
=
QR
; where
the columns of the
m

n matrix
Q are orthonormal vectors and the
n

n matrix
R is
upper triangular with nonzero diagonal entries. Such a factorization of
A is called a QR
factorization of
A: It follows that the product
Q
T
Q
=
I
n
: Now multiply both sides of
the linear system on the left by
Q
T to obtain that
Q
T
Ax
=
Q
T
QR
x
=
I
R
x
=
Q
T
b
The net result is a simple square system with a triangular matrix which we can solve by
backsolving. That is, we use the last equation to solve for
x
n
; then the next to the last to
solve for
x
n 1
; and so forth. This is the backsolving phase of Gaussian elimination as
we ﬁrst learned it in Chapter 1, before we were introduced to Gauss-Jordan elimination.
One has to wonder why we have any interest in such a factorization, since we already
have Gauss-Jordan elimination for system solving. Furthermore, it can be shown that
ﬁnding a QR factorization is harder by a factor of about 2, that is, requires about twice
as many ﬂoating point operations to accomplish. So why bother? There are many
answers. For one, it can be shown that using the QR factorization has an advantage of
higher accuracy than Gauss-Jordan elimination in certain situations. For another, QR
factorization gives us another method for solving least squares problems. We’ll see an
example of this method at the end of this section.
Where can we ﬁnd such a factorization? As a matter of fact, we already have the
necessary tools, compliments of the Gram-Schmidt algorithm. To explain matters, let’s
suppose that we have a matrix
A
=
[w
1
;
w
2
;
w

] with linearly independent columns.
Application of the Gram-Schmidt algorithm leads to orthogonal vectors
v

the following formulas:

6.5. *Operator Norms
The object of this section is to develop a useful notion of the norm of a matrix. For
simplicity, we stick with the case of a real matrix
A, but all of the results in this section
carry over easily to complex matrices. In Chapters 3 and 5 we studied the concept
of a vector norm, which gave us a way of thinking about the “size” of a vector. We
could easily extend this to matrices, just by thinking of a matrix as a vector which had
been chopped into segments of equal length and restacked as a matrix. Thus, every
vector norm on the space
R
mn of vectors of length
mn gives rise to a vector norm on
the space
R
m;n of
m

n matrices. Experience has shown that, with one exception –
the standard norm, this is not the best way to look for norms of matrices.
After all,
matrices are deeply tied up with the operation of matrix multiplication. It would be
too much to expect norms to distribute over products. The following deﬁnition takes a
middle ground that has proved to be useful for many applications.
DEFINITION 6.5.1. A vector norm
k

n, is said to be a matrix norm if, for all pairs of matrices

Our ﬁrst example of such a norm is called the Frobenius norm; it is the one exception
that we alluded to above.

The most important multiplicative norm comes from a rather general notion. Just as
every inner product “induces” a norm in a natural way, every norm on the standard
spaces induces a norm on matrices in a natural way. This type of norm is deﬁned as
follows.
DEFINITION 6.5.4. The operator norm induced on matrices by a norm on the standard
spaces is deﬁned by the formula
jjAj

: Now a vector has inﬁnity norm
1 if each of its
coordinates is
1 in absolute value. Notice that we can make the
ith entry of
Av as large
as possible simply by choosing
v so that the
jth coordinate of
v is
1 and agrees with

6.5. *OPERATOR NORMS

the sign of
a
ij
: Hence the inﬁnity norm of
Av is the maximum of the row sums of the
absolute values of the entries of
A, as stated in (2).
One of the more important applications of the idea of a matrix norm is the famous
Banach Lemma. Essentially, it amounts to a matrix version of the familiar geometric
series encountered in calculus.

A fundamental idea in numerical linear algebra is the notion of the condition number
of a matrix
A: Roughly speaking, the condition number measures the degree to which
changes in
A lead to changes in solutions of systems
Ax
=
b: A large condition number
means that small changes in
A may lead to large changes in
x: In the case of an invertible
matrix
A, the condition number of
A is deﬁned to be

We leave the proof as an exercise.
We conclude with a very fundamental result for numerical linear algebra. The context
is a more general formulation of the problem which is discussed in Section 6.6. Here
is the scenario: suppose that we desire to solve the linear system
Ax
=
b; where
A is
invertible. Due to arithmetic error or possibly input data error, we end up with a value
x
+
Æ
x which solves exactly a “nearby” system
(A
+
Æ
A)(x
+
Æ
x)
=
b
+
Æ
b: (It
can be shown by using an idea called “backward error analysis” that this is really what
happens when many algorithms are used to solve a linear system.) The question is, what
is the size of the relative error
kÆ
xk=kxk? As long as the perturbation matrix
kÆ
Ak is
reasonably small, there is a very elegant answer.

If we believe that the inequality in the perturbation theorem can be sharp (it can!),
then it becomes clear how the condition number of the matrix
A is a direct factor in
how relative error in the solution vector is ampliﬁed by perturbations in the coefﬁcient
matrix.

theorem below provides a solution to this question: how large an error in the solution

to a linear system can there be, given that we have introduced an error in the right hand
side whose size we can estimate? (Such an error might be due to experimental error or
input error.) The theorem requires an extension of the idea of vector inﬁnity norm to

Now multiply the inequalities 6.6.1 and 6.6.2 together to obtain the asserted inequality

EXAMPLE 6.6.4. Suppose we wish to solve the nonsingular system
Ax
=
b exactly,
where the coefﬁcient matrix
A is as in Example 6.6.2 but the right hand side vector
b
is determined from measured data. Suppose also that the error of measurement is such
that the ratio of the largest error in any coordinate of
b to the largest coordinate of
b
(this ratio is called the relative error) is no more than
0:01 in absolute value. Estimate
the size of the relative error in the solution.
SOLUTION. In matrix notation, we can phrase the problem in this manner: let the
correct value of the right hand side be
b and the measured value of the right hand side
be
~
b, so that the error of measurement is the vector
Æ
b
=

system

: This sets up very nicely for an application of

A Practical QR algorithm
In the preceding section we saw that the QR factorization can be used to solve systems
including least squares. We also saw the factorization as a consequence of the Gram-
Schmidt algorithm. As a matter of fact, the classical Gram-Schmidt algorithm which we
have presented has certain numerical stability problems when used in practice. There
is a so-called modiﬁed Gram-Schmidt algorithm that performs better. However, there

302
6. GEOMETRICAL ASPECTS OF ABSTRACT SPACES
is another approach to QR factorization that avoids Gram-Schmidt altogether. This ap-
proach uses the Householder matrices we introduced in Section 4.3. It is more efﬁcient
and stable than Gram-Schmidt. If you use a MAS to ﬁnd the QR factorization of a
matrix, it is likely that this is the method used by the system.
The basic idea behind this Householder QR is to use a succession of Householder ma-
trices to zero out the lower triangle of a matrix, one column at a time. The key fact
about Householder matrices is the following application of these matrices:
THEOREM 6.6.5. Let
x;
y be nonzero vectors in
R
n of the same length. Then there is a
Householder matrix
H
v such that
H
v
x
=
y.
PROOF. Let
v
=
x
 y. Then we see that
(x
+
y
)
T
(x
 y
)
=
x
T
x
 x
T
y
 y
T
x
+
y
T
y
=
x
T
x
 y
T
y
=
0
since
x and
y have the same length. Now write
x
=
1
2
f
(
x
 y
)
+
(x
+
y
)g
=
p
+
u
and obtain from Theorem 4.3.10 that
H
v
x
=
 p
+
u
=
1
2
f (x
 y
)
+
(x
+
y
)g
=
2y
2
=
y
which is what we wanted to show.
Now we have a tool for massively zeroing out entries in a vector of the form
x
=
(x
1
;
x

;
:
:
:
;
x
n
): Set
y
=
(
k
xk
;
0;
:
:
:
;
0) and apply the preceding theorem to con-
struct Householder
H such that
H
v
x
=
y
: It is standard to choose the
 to be the
negative of the sign of
x
1
: In this way, the ﬁrst term will not cause any loss of accuracy
to subtractive cancellation. However, any choice of
 works ﬁne in theory. We can
picture this situation schematically very nicely by representing possibly nonzero entries
by an ‘’ in the following simple version:
x

it follows that
A
=
QR. Notice that we don’t actually have to carry out the multipli-
cations to compute
Q unless they are needed, and the vectors needed to deﬁne these
Householder matrices are themselves easily stored in a single matrix. What we have
here is just a bit different from the QR factorization discussed in the last section. Here
the matrix
Q is a full
m

m matrix and
R is the same size as
A: Even if
A is not full
column rank, this procedure will work, provided we simply skip construction of
H in
the case that there are no nonzero elements to zero out in some column. Consequently,
we have essentially proved the following theorem, which is sometimes called a full QR
factorization, in contrast to the reduced QR factorization of Theorem 6.4.10.
THEOREM 6.6.6. Let
A be a real
m

n matrix. Then there exists an

m orthogonal

Actually, all of the results we have discussed regarding QR factorization carry over to
complex matrices, provided we replace orthogonal matrices by unitary matrices and
transposes by Hermitian transposes.

for solving least squares problems

(a) Solution by solving the associated normal equations by Gaussian elimination.
(b) Solution by reduced QR factorization obtained by Gram-Schmidt.
(c) Solution by full QR factorization by Householder matrices.

Procedure: First set up the system matrix
A and right hand side matrix
b. Method (a)
is easily implemented on any CAS or MAS. The built-in procedure for computing a
QR factorization will very likely be Householder matrices which will take care of (c).
You will need to check the documentation to verify this. The Gram-Schmidt method of
ﬁnding QR factorization will have to be programmed by you.

6. GEOMETRICAL ASPECTS OF ABSTRACT SPACES
Once you have solved the system by these three methods, make out a table that has the
computed coefﬁcients for each of the three methods. Then make plots of the difference
between the function
f
(x) and the computed polynomial for each method. Discuss your
results.
There are a number of good texts which discuss numerical methods for least squares;
see, e.g., [3]
Project: Approximation Theory
Suppose you work for a manufacturer of calculators, and are involved in the design of
a new calculator. The problem is this : as one of the “features” of this calculator, the
designers decided that it would be nice to have a key which calculated a transcendental
function, namely,
f
(x)
=
sin(
x);
 1

x

1 Your job is to come up with an
adequate way of calculating
f
(x), say with an error no worse than .001
Polynomials are a natural idea for approximating functions. From a designer’s point of
view they are particularly attractive because they are so easy to implement. Given the
coefﬁcients of a polynomial, it is easy to design a very efﬁcient and compact algorithm
for calculating values of the polynomial. Such an algorithm, together with the coefﬁ-
cients of the polynomial, would ﬁt nicely into a small ROM for the calculator, or could
even be microcoded into the chip.
Your task is to ﬁnd a low degree polynomial that approximates
sin(
x) to within the
speciﬁed accuracy. For comparison, ﬁnd a Taylor polynomial of lowest degree for
sin
x
that gives sufﬁcient accuracy. Next, use the projection problem idea to project the func-
tion
sin
x
2
C
[ 1;
1] with the standard inner product, into the subspace
P
n of polyno-
mials of degree at most
n: You will need to ﬁnd the smallest
n that gives a projection
whose difference from
sin
x is at most
0:001 on the interval
[ 1;
1]: Is it lower degree
than the best Taylor polynomial approximation?
Use a CAS to do the computations and graphics. Then report on your ﬁndings. Include
graphs that will be helpful in interpreting your conclusions. Also, give suggestions on
how to compute this polynomial efﬁciently.
A Report Topic: Fourier Analysis

which you exhibit formulas for the Fourier coefﬁcients of a function
f

the form and meaning of the projection formula in this setting. Try to prove that the
trigonometric functions given above are an orthonormal set. At minimum provide a
proof for the ﬁrst three functions.
In the second part you will explore the quality of these approximations for various test
functions. The test functions are speciﬁed on the interval
[ 


] and then this graph is
replicated on adjacent intervals of length
2

the basis of

f(1;

T

(I

det(I

) so
A and

same eigenvalues.
9. Since
x is an eigenvector of
A with eigen-
value
,
Ax
=
x: So
A(cx)
=
c(Ax)
=
c(x)
=
(cx): Therefore
cx is an eigen-
vector of
A with eigenvalue
:
10. Let
 be an eigenvalue of

: So
(I

v
 Av

 v
=

 )v
: Thus if


1
  is an eigenvalue
of
I
 A: Since

eigenvalue of

 A is nonzero. Therefore
I
 A is invertible.
11. Let
 be an eigenvalue of

: If
A is invert-
