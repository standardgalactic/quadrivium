operates in its linear region.
2. Write a KCL equation at the inverting input terminal.
3. Solve the KCL equation and use the solution to find the op amp’s output
voltage.

Step Response of RL and RC
Circuits
1. Identify the variable x(t), which is the inductor current for RL circuits
and capacitor voltage for RC circuits.

−αtcosωdt+B′2e−αtsinωdt, t≥0+;
If α2=ω02, the response is critically damped and iL(t)=If+D′1te−αt+D
′2e−αt, t≥0+
4. If the response is overdamped, calculate s1 and s2 using the equations
in Table 8.3;

In Memoriam
We remember our beloved author, James W. Nilsson, for his lasting legacy to
the electrical and computer engineering field.

The first edition of Electric Circuits was published in 1983. As this book
evolved over the years to better meet the needs of both students and their
instructors, the underlying teaching methodologies Jim established remain
relevant, even in the Eleventh Edition.
Jim earned his bachelor’s degree at the University of Iowa (1948), and his
master’s degree (1952) and Ph.D. (1958) at Iowa State University. He joined
the ISU faculty in 1948 and taught electrical engineering there for 39 years.
He became an IEEE fellow in 1990 and earned the prestigious IEEE
Undergraduate Teaching Award in 1992.

Preface
The Eleventh Edition of Electric Circuits represents the most extensive
revision to the text since the Fifth Edition, published in 1996. Every sentence,
paragraph, subsection, and chapter has been examined to improve clarity,
readability, and pedagogy. Yet the fundamental goals of the text are
unchanged. These goals are:
To build new concepts and ideas on concepts previously presented. This
challenges students to see the explicit connections among the many
circuit analysis tools and methods.
To develop problem-solving skills that rely on a solid conceptual
foundation. This challenges students to examine many different
approaches to solving a problem before writing a single equation.
To introduce realistic engineering experiences at every opportunity. This
challenges students to develop the insights of a practicing engineer and
exposes them to practice of engineering.
Why This Edition?
The Eleventh Edition of Electric Circuits incorporates the following new and
revised elements:
Analysis Methods – This new feature identifies the steps needed to
apply a particular circuit analysis technique. Many students struggle just
to get started when analyzing a circuit, and the analysis methods will
reduce that struggle. Some of the analysis methods that are used most
often can be found inside the book’s covers for easy reference.
Examples – Many students rely on examples when developing and
refining their problem-solving skills. We identified many places in the
text that needed additional examples, and as a result the number of

examples has increased by nearly 35% to 200.
End-of-chapter problems – Problem solving is fundamental to the study
of circuit analysis. Having a wide variety of problems to assign and
work is a key to success in any circuits course. Therefore, some existing
end-of-chapter problems were revised, and some new end-of-chapter
problems were added. Approximately 30% of the problems in the
Eleventh Edition were rewritten.
Fundamental equations and concepts – These important elements in the
text were previously identified with margin notes. In this edition, the
margin notes have been replaced by a second-color background,
enlarged fonts, and a descriptive title for each fundamental equation and
concept. In additional, many equation numbers have been eliminated to
make it easier to distinguish fundamental equations from the many other
equations in the text.
Circuit simulation software – The PSpice® and Multisim® manuals have
been revised to include screenshots from the most recent versions of
these software simulation applications. Each manual presents the
simulation material in the same order as the material is encountered in
the text. These manuals include example simulations of circuits from the
text. Icons identify end-of-chapter problems that are good candidates for
simulation using either PSpice or Multisim.
Solving simultaneous equations – Most circuit analysis techniques in
this text eventually require you to solve two or more simultaneous linear
algebraic equations. Appendix A has been extensively revised and
includes examples of paper-and-pencil techniques, calculator
techniques, and computer software techniques.
Student workbook – Students who could benefit from additional
examples and practice problems can use the Student Workbook, which
has been revised for the Eleventh Edition of the text. This workbook has
examples and problems covering the following material: balancing
power, simple resistive circuits, node voltage method, mesh current
method, Thévenin and Norton equivalents, op amp circuits, first-order
circuits, second-order circuits, AC steady-state analysis, and Laplace

transform circuit analysis.
The Student Workbook now includes access to Video Solutions,
complete, step-by-step solution walkthroughs to representative
homework problems.
Learning Catalytics, a “bring your own device” student engagement,
assessment, and classroom intelligence system is available with the
Eleventh Edition. With Learning Catalytics you can:
Use open-ended questions to get into the minds of students to
understand what they do or don’t know and adjust lectures
accordingly.

program that provides students with personalized feedback and hints and
instructors with diagnostics to track students’ progress. With the
Eleventh Edition, Mastering Engineering will offer new enhanced end-
of-chapter problems with hints and feedback, Coaching Activities, and
Adaptive Follow-Up assignments. Visit www.masteringengineering.com
for more information.
Hallmark Features
Analysis Methods
Students encountering circuit analysis for the first time can benefit from step-

by-step directions that lead them to a problem’s solution. We have compiled
these directions in a collection of analysis methods, and revised many of the
examples in the text to employ these analysis methods.

Chapter Problems
Users of Electric Circuits have consistently rated the Chapter Problems as
one of the book’s most attractive features. In the Eleventh Edition, there are
1185 end-of-chapter problems with approximately 30% that have been
revised from the previous edition. Problems are organized at the end of each
chapter by section.
Practical Perspectives
The Eleventh Edition continues using Practical Perspectives to introduce the
chapter. They provide real-world circuit examples, taken from real-world
devices. Every chapter begins by describing a practical application of the
material that follows. After presenting that material, the chapter revisits
the Practical Perspective, performing a quantitative circuit analysis using the
newly introduced chapter material. A special icon identifies end-of-chapter
problems directly related to the Practical Perspective application. These
problems provide additional opportunities for solving real-world problems
using the chapter material.
Assessment Problems
Each chapter begins with a set of chapter objectives. At key points in the
chapter, you are asked to stop and assess your mastery of a particular
objective by solving one or more assessment problems. The answers to all of
the assessment problems are given at the conclusion of each problem, so you
can check your work. If you are able to solve the assessment problems for a
given objective, you have mastered that objective. If you need more practice,
several end-of-chapter problems that relate to the objective are suggested at
the conclusion of the assessment problems.

Examples
Every chapter includes many examples that illustrate the concepts presented
in the text in the form of a numeric example. There are now nearly 200
examples in this text, an increase of about 35% when compared to the
previous edition. The examples illustrate the application of a particular
concept, often employ an Analysis Method, and exemplify good problem-
solving skills.
Fundamental Equations and
Concepts
Throughout the text, you will see fundamental equations and concepts set
apart from the main text. This is done to help you focus on some of the key
principles in electric circuits and to help you navigate through the important
topics.
Integration of Computer Tools
Computer tools can assist students in the learning process by providing a
visual representation of a circuit’s behavior, validating a calculated solution,
reducing the computational burden of more complex circuits, and iterating
toward a desired solution using parameter variation. This computational
support is often invaluable in the design process. The Eleventh Edition
supports PSpice and Multisim, both popular computer tools for circuit
simulation and analysis. Chapter problems suited for exploration with PSpice
and Multisim are marked accordingly.
Design Emphasis

The Eleventh Edition continues to support the emphasis on the design of
circuits in many ways. First, many of the Practical Perspective discussions
focus on the design aspects of the circuits. The accompanying Chapter
Problems continue the discussion of the design issues in these practical
examples. Second, design-oriented Chapter Problems have been labeled
explicitly, enabling students and instructors to identify those problems with a
design focus. Third, the identification of problems suited to exploration with
PSpice or Multisim suggests design opportunities using these software tools.
Fourth, some problems in nearly every chapter focus on the use of realistic
component values in achieving a desired circuit design. Once such a problem
has been analyzed, the student can proceed to a laboratory to build and test
the circuit, comparing the analysis with the measured performance of the
actual circuit.
Accuracy
All text and problems in the Eleventh Edition have undergone our strict
hallmark accuracy checking process, to ensure the most error-free book
possible.

Prerequisites
In writing the first 12 chapters of the text, we have assumed that the reader
has taken a course in elementary differential and integral calculus. We have
also assumed that the reader has had an introductory physics course, at either
the high school or university level, that introduces the concepts of energy,
power, electric charge, electric current, electric potential, and electromagnetic
fields. In writing the final six chapters, we have assumed the student has had,
or is enrolled in, an introductory course in differential equations.
Course Options
The text has been designed for use in a one-semester, two-semester, or a
three-quarter sequence.
Single-semester course: After covering Chapters 1–4 and Chapters 6–10
(omitting Sections 7.7 and 8.5) the instructor can develop the desired
emphasis by covering Chapter 5 (operational amplifiers), Chapter 11
(three-phase circuits), Chapters 13 and 14 (Laplace methods), or Chapter
18 (Two-Port Circuits).
Two-semester sequence: Assuming three lectures per week, cover the
first nine chapters during the first semester, leaving Chapters 10–18 for
the second semester.
Academic quarter schedule: Cover Chapters 1–6 in the first quarter,
Chapters 7–12 in the second quarter, and Chapters 13–18 in the third
quarter.
Note that the introduction to operational amplifier circuits in Chapter 5 can be
omitted with minimal effect on the remaining material. If Chapter 5 is
omitted, you should also omit Section 7.7, Section 8.5, Chapter 15, and those
assessment problems and end-of-chapter problems that pertain to operational

amplifiers.
There are several appendixes at the end of the book to help readers make
effective use of their mathematical background. Appendix A presents several
different methods for solving simultaneous linear equations; complex
numbers are reviewed in Appendix B; Appendix C contains additional
material on magnetically coupled coils and ideal transformers; Appendix D
contains a brief discussion of the decibel; Appendix E is dedicated to Bode
diagrams; Appendix F is devoted to an abbreviated table of trigonometric
identities that are useful in circuit analysis; and an abbreviated table of useful
integrals is given in Appendix G. Appendix H provides tables of common
standard component values for resistors, inductors, and capacitors, to be used
in solving many end-of-chapter problems. Selected Answers provides
answers to selected end-of-chapter problems.

Electrical engineering is an exciting and challenging profession for anyone
who has a genuine interest in, and aptitude for, applied science and
mathematics. Electrical engineers play a dominant role in developing systems
that change the way people live and work. Satellite communication links, cell
phones, computers, televisions, diagnostic and surgical medical equipment,
robots, and aircraft represent systems that define a modern technological
society. As an electrical engineer, you can participate in this ongoing
technological revolution by improving and refining existing systems and by
discovering and developing new systems to meet the needs of our ever-
changing society.
This text introduces you to electrical engineering using the analysis and
design of linear circuits. We begin by presenting an overview of electrical
engineering, some ideas about an engineering point of view as it relates to
circuit analysis, and a review of the International System of Units. We then
describe generally what circuit analysis entails. Next, we introduce the
concepts of voltage and current. We continue by discussing the ideal basic
element and the need for a polarity reference system. We conclude the
chapter by describing how current and voltage relate to power and energy.
Practical Perspective

Balancing Power
One of the most important skills you will develop is the ability to check your
answers for the circuits you design and analyze using the tools developed in
this text. A common method used to check for valid answers is to calculate
the power in the circuit. The linear circuits we study have no net power, so
the sum of the power associated with all circuit components must be zero. If
the total power for the circuit is zero, we say that the power balances, but if
the total power is not zero, we need to find the errors in our calculation.
As an example, we will consider a simple model for distributing electricity to
a typical home. (Note that a more realistic model will be investigated in the
Practical Perspective for Chapter 9.) The components labeled a and b
represent the source of electrical power for the home. The components
labeled c, d, and e represent the wires that carry the electrical current from the
source to the devices in the home requiring electrical power. The components
labeled f, g, and h represent lamps, televisions, hair dryers, refrigerators, and
other devices that require power.

Once we have introduced the concepts of voltage, current, power, and energy,
we will examine this circuit model in detail, and use a power balance to
determine whether the results of analyzing this circuit are correct.

1.1 Electrical Engineering: An
Overview
The electrical engineering profession focuses on systems that produce,
transmit, and measure electric signals. Electrical engineering combines the
physicist’s models of natural phenomena with the mathematician’s tools for
manipulating those models to produce systems that meet practical needs.
Electrical systems pervade our lives; they are found in homes, schools,
workplaces, and transportation vehicles everywhere. We begin by presenting
a few examples from each of the five major classifications of electrical
systems:
communication systems
computer systems
control systems
power systems
signal-processing systems
Then we describe how electrical engineers analyze and design such systems.
Communication systems are electrical systems that generate, transmit, and
distribute information. Well-known examples include television equipment,
such as cameras, transmitters, receivers, and monitors; radio telescopes, used
to explore the universe; satellite systems, which return images of other
planets and our own; radar systems, used to coordinate plane flights; and
telephone systems.
Figure 1.1 depicts the major components of a modern telephone system that
supports mobile phones, landlines, and international calling. Inside a
telephone, a microphone turns sound waves into electric signals. These
signals are carried to local or mobile exchanges, where they are combined

with the signals from tens, hundreds, or thousands of other telephones. The
form of the signals can be radio waves traveling through air, electrical signals
traveling in underground coaxial cable, light pulses traveling in fiber-optic
cable, or microwave signals that travel through space. The combined signals
are broadcast from a transmission antenna to a receiving antenna. There the
combined signals are separated at an exchange, and each is routed to the
appropriate telephone, where an earphone acts as a speaker to convert the
received electric signals back into sound waves. At each stage of the process,
electric circuits operate on the signals. Imagine the challenge involved in
designing, building, and operating each circuit in a way that guarantees that
all of the hundreds of thousands of simultaneous calls have high-quality
connections.

Computer systems use electric signals to process information ranging from
word processing to mathematical computations. Systems range in size and
power from simple calculators to personal computers to supercomputers that
perform such complex tasks as processing weather data and modeling
chemical interactions of complex organic molecules. These systems include
networks of integrated circuits—miniature assemblies of hundreds,
thousands, or millions of electrical components that often operate at speeds
and power levels close to fundamental physical limits, including the speed of
light and the thermodynamic laws.
Control systems use electric signals to regulate processes. Examples include
the control of temperatures, pressures, and flow rates in an oil refinery; the
fuel–air mixture in a fuel-injected automobile engine; mechanisms such as
the motors, doors, and lights in elevators; and the locks in the Panama Canal.
The autopilot and autolanding systems that help to fly and land airplanes are
also familiar control systems.
Power systems generate and distribute electric power. Electric power, which
is the foundation of our technology-based society, usually is generated in
large quantities by nuclear, hydroelectric, solar, and thermal (coal-, oil-, or
gas-fired) generators. Power is distributed by a grid of conductors that
crisscross the country. A major challenge in designing and operating such a
system is to provide sufficient redundancy and control so that failure of any
piece of equipment does not leave a city, state, or region completely without
power.
Signal-processing systems act on electric signals that represent information.
They transform the signals and the information contained in them into a more
suitable form. There are many different ways to process the signals and their
information. For example, image-processing systems gather massive
quantities of data from orbiting weather satellites, reduce the amount of data
to a manageable level, and transform the remaining data into a video image
for the evening news broadcast. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is
another example of an image-processing system. It takes signals generated by
powerful magnetic fields and radio waves and transforms them into a

detailed, three-dimensional image such as the one shown in Fig. 1.2, which
can be used to diagnose disease and injury.

Considerable interaction takes place among the engineering disciplines
involved in designing and operating these five classes of systems. Thus,
communications engineers use digital computers to control the flow of
information. Computers contain control systems, and control systems contain
computers. Power systems require extensive communications systems to
coordinate safely and reliably the operation of components, which may be
spread across a continent. A signal-processing system may involve a
communications link, a computer, and a control system.
A good example of the interaction among systems is a commercial airplane,
such as the one shown in Fig. 1.3. A sophisticated communications system
enables the pilot and the air traffic controller to monitor the plane’s location,
permitting the air traffic controller to design a safe flight path for all of the
nearby aircraft and enabling the pilot to keep the plane on its designated path.
An onboard computer system manages engine functions, implements the
navigation and flight control systems, and generates video information
screens in the cockpit. A complex control system uses cockpit commands to
adjust the position and speed of the airplane, producing the appropriate
signals to the engines and the control surfaces (such as the wing flaps,
ailerons, and rudder) to ensure the plane remains safely airborne and on the
desired flight path. The plane must have its own power system to stay aloft
and to provide and distribute the electric power needed to keep the cabin
lights on, make the coffee, and activate the entertainment system. Signal-
processing systems reduce the noise in air traffic communications and
transform information about the plane’s location into the more meaningful
form of a video display in the cockpit. Engineering challenges abound in the
design of each of these systems and their integration into a coherent whole.
For example, these systems must operate in widely varying and unpredictable
environmental conditions. Perhaps the most important engineering challenge
is to guarantee that sufficient redundancy is incorporated in the designs,
ensuring that passengers arrive safely and on time at their desired
destinations.

Although electrical engineers may be interested primarily in one area, they
must also be knowledgeable in other areas that interact with this area of
interest. This interaction is part of what makes electrical engineering a
challenging and exciting profession. The emphasis in engineering is on
making things work, so an engineer is free to acquire and use any technique
from any field that helps to get the job done.
Circuit Theory
An electric circuit is a mathematical model that approximates the behavior
of an actual electrical system. Since electric circuits are found in every
branch of electrical engineering, they provide an important foundation for
learning how to design and operate systems such as those just described. The
models, the mathematical techniques, and the language of circuit theory will
form the intellectual framework for your future engineering endeavors.
Note that the term electric circuit is commonly used to refer to an actual
electrical system as well as to the model that represents it. In this text, when
we talk about an electric circuit, we always mean a model, unless otherwise
stated. It is the modeling aspect of circuit theory that has broad applications
across engineering disciplines.
Circuit theory is a special case of electromagnetic field theory: the study of
static and moving electric charges. But applying generalized field theory to
the study of electric signals is cumbersome and requires advanced
mathematics. Consequently, a course in electromagnetic field theory is not a
prerequisite to understanding the material in this book. We do, however,
assume that you have had an introductory physics course in which electrical
and magnetic phenomena were discussed.
Three basic assumptions permit us to use circuit theory, rather than
electromagnetic field theory, to study a physical system represented by an
electric circuit.

1. Electrical effects happen instantaneously throughout a system. We can
make this assumption because we know that electric signals travel at or
near the speed of light. Thus, if the system is physically small, electric
signals move through it so quickly that we can consider them to affect
every point in the system simultaneously. A system that is small enough
so that we can make this assumption is called a lumped-parameter
system.
2. The net charge on every component in the system is always zero. Thus,
no component can collect a net excess of charge, although some
components, as you will learn later, can hold equal but opposite
separated charges.
3. There is no magnetic coupling between the components in a system. As
we demonstrate later, magnetic coupling can occur within a component.
That’s it; there are no other assumptions. Using circuit theory provides
simple solutions (of sufficient accuracy) to problems that would become
hopelessly complicated if we were to use electromagnetic field theory. These
benefits are so great that engineers sometimes specifically design electrical
systems to ensure that these assumptions are met. The importance of
assumptions 2 and 3 becomes apparent after we introduce the basic circuit
elements and the rules for analyzing interconnected elements.
Let’s take a closer look at assumption 1. The question is, “How small does a
physical system have to be to qualify as a lumped-parameter system?” To get
a quantitative answer to this question, remember that electric signals
propagate as waves. If the wavelength of the signal is large compared to the
physical dimensions of the system, we have a lumped-parameter system. The
wavelength λ is the velocity divided by the repetition rate, or frequency, of
the signal; that is, λ=c/f . The frequency f is measured in hertz (Hz). For
example, power systems in the United States operate at 60 Hz. If we use the
speed of light (c=3×108 m/s) as the velocity of propagation, the wavelength is
5×106 m. If the power system of interest is physically smaller than this
wavelength, we can represent it as a lumped-parameter system and use circuit
theory to analyze its behavior. How do we define smaller? A good rule is the
rule of 1/10th: If the dimension of the system is less than 1/10th the
dimension of the wavelength, you have a lumped-parameter system. Thus, as

long as the physical dimension of the power system is less than 5×105 m
(which is about 310 miles), we can treat it as a lumped-parameter system.
Now consider a communication system that sends and receives radio signals.
The propagation frequency of radio signals is on the order of 109 Hz, so the
wavelength is 0.3 m. Using the rule of 1N10th, a communication system
qualifies as a lumped-parameter system if its dimension is less than 3 cm.
Whenever any of the pertinent physical dimensions of a system under study
approaches the wavelength of its signals, we must use electromagnetic field
theory to analyze that system. Throughout this book we study circuits derived
from lumped-parameter systems.
Problem Solving
As a practicing engineer, you will not be asked to solve problems that have
already been solved. Whether you are improving the performance of an
existing system or designing a new system, you will be working on unsolved
problems. As a student, however, you will read and discuss problems with
known solutions. Then, by solving related homework and exam problems on
your own, you will begin to develop the skills needed to attack the unsolved
problems you’ll face as a practicing engineer.
Let’s review several general problem-solving strategies. Many of these
pertain to thinking about and organizing your solution strategy before
proceeding with calculations.
1. Identify what’s given and what’s to be found. In problem solving, you
need to know your destination before you can select a route for getting
there. What is the problem asking you to solve or find? Sometimes the
goal of the problem is obvious; other times you may need to paraphrase
or make lists or tables of known and unknown information to see your
objective.
On one hand, the problem statement may contain extraneous
information that you need to weed out before proceeding. On the other
hand, it may offer incomplete information or more complexities than can

be handled by the solution methods you know. In that case, you’ll need
to make assumptions to fill in the missing information or simplify the
problem context. Be prepared to circle back and reconsider supposedly
extraneous information and/or your assumptions if your calculations get
bogged down or produce an answer that doesn’t seem to make sense.
2. Sketch a circuit diagram or other visual model. Translating a verbal
problem description into a visual model is often a useful step in the
solution process. If a circuit diagram is already provided, you may need
to add information to it, such as labels, values, or reference directions.
You may also want to redraw the circuit in a simpler, but equivalent,
form. Later in this text you will learn the methods for developing such
simplified equivalent circuits.
3. Think of several solution methods and decide on a way of choosing
among them. This course will help you build a collection of analytical
tools, several of which may work on a given problem. But one method
may produce fewer equations to be solved than another, or it may
require only algebra instead of calculus to reach a solution. Such
efficiencies, if you can anticipate them, can streamline your calculations
considerably. Having an alternative method in mind also gives you a
path to pursue if your first solution attempt bogs down.
4. Calculate a solution. Your planning up to this point should have helped
you identify a good analytical method and the correct equations for the
problem. Now comes the solution of those equations. Paper-and-pencil,
calculator, and computer methods are all available for performing the
actual calculations of circuit analysis. Efficiency and your instructor’s
preferences will dictate which tools you should use.
5. Use your creativity. If you suspect that your answer is off base or if the
calculations seem to go on and on without moving you toward a
solution, you should pause and consider alternatives. You may need to
revisit your assumptions or select a different solution method. Or you
may need to take a less conventional problem-solving approach, such as
working backward from a solution. This text provides answers to all of
the Assessment Problems and many of the Chapter Problems so that you
may work backward when you get stuck. In the real world, you won’t be

given answers in advance, but you may have a desired problem outcome
in mind from which you can work backward. Other creative approaches
include allowing yourself to see parallels with other types of problems
you’ve successfully solved, following your intuition or hunches about
how to proceed, and simply setting the problem aside temporarily and
coming back to it later.
6. Test your solution. Ask yourself whether the solution you’ve obtained
makes sense. Does the magnitude of the answer seem reasonable? Is the
solution physically realizable? Are the units correct? You may want to
rework the problem using an alternative method to validate your original
answer and help you develop your intuition about the most efficient
solution methods for various kinds of problems. In the real world,
safety-critical designs are always checked by several independent
means. Getting into the habit of checking your answers will benefit you
both as a student and as a practicing engineer.
These problem-solving steps cannot be used as a recipe to solve every
problem in this or any other course. You may need to skip, change the order
of, or elaborate on certain steps to solve a particular problem. Use these steps
as a guideline to develop a problem-solving style that works for you.

1.2 The International System of
Units
Engineers use quantitative measures to compare theoretical results to
experimental results and compare competing engineering designs. Modern
engineering is a multidisciplinary profession in which teams of engineers
work together on projects, and they can communicate their results in a
meaningful way only if they all use the same units of measure. The
International System of Units (abbreviated SI) is used by all the major
engineering societies and most engineers throughout the world; hence we use
it in this book.
The SI units are based on seven defined quantities:
length
mass
time
electric current
thermodynamic temperature
amount of substance
luminous intensity
These quantities, along with the basic unit and symbol for each, are listed in
Table 1.1. Although not strictly SI units, the familiar time units of minute (60
s), hour (3600 s), and so on are often used in engineering calculations. In
addition, defined quantities are combined to form derived units. Some
quantities, such as force, energy, power, and electric charge, you already
know through previous physics courses. Table 1.2 lists the derived units used
in this book.

In many cases, the SI unit is either too small or too large to use conveniently.
Standard prefixes corresponding to powers of 10, as listed in Table 1.3, are
then applied to the basic unit. Engineers often use only the prefixes for
powers divisible by 3; thus centi, deci, deka, and hecto are used rarely. Also,
engineers often select the prefix that places the base number in the range
between 1 and 1000. Suppose that a time calculation yields a result of 10−5 s,
that is, 0.00001 s. Most engineers would describe this quantity as 10 μs, that
is, 10−5=10×10−6 s, rather than as 0.01 ms or 10,000 ns.

If a signal can travel in a cable at 80% of the speed of light, what length of
cable, in inches, represents 1 ns?
Solution
First, note that 1 ns=10−9 s. Also, recall that the speed of light c=3×108 m/s.
Then, 80% of the speed of light is 0.8c=(0.8)(3×108)=2.4×108 m/s. Using a
product of ratios, we can convert 80% of the speed of light from meters per
second to inches per nanosecond. The result is the distance in inches traveled
in 1 nanosecond:
2.4× 10 8  meters 1 second ⋅ 1 second 10 9  nanoseconds ⋅ 100 centimeters
1 meter ⋅ 1 inch 2.54 centimeters =9.45 inches/nanosecond.
Therefore, a signal traveling at 80% of the speed of light will cover 9.45
inches of cable in 1 nanosecond.

1.3 Circuit Analysis: An Overview
We look broadly at engineering design, specifically the design of electric
circuits, before becoming involved in the details of circuit analysis. This
overview provides you with a perspective on where circuit analysis fits
within the whole of circuit design. Even though this book focuses on circuit
analysis, we try to provide opportunities for circuit design where appropriate.
All engineering designs begin with a need 1, as shown in Fig. 1.4. This need
may come from the desire to improve on an existing design, or it may be
something brand new. A careful assessment of the need results in design
specifications, which are measurable characteristics of a proposed design.
Once a design is proposed, the design specifications 2 allow us to assess
whether or not the design actually meets the need.
Figure 1.4 A conceptual model
for electrical engineering
design.


Figure 1.4 Full Alternative Text
A concept 3 for the design comes next. The concept derives from a complete
understanding of the design specifications coupled with an insight into the
need, which comes from education and experience. The concept may be
realized as a sketch, as a written description, or as some other form. Often the
next step is to translate the concept into a mathematical model. A commonly
used mathematical model for electrical systems is a circuit model 4.
The elements that make up the circuit model are called ideal circuit
components. An ideal circuit component is a mathematical model of an
actual electrical component, like a battery or a light bulb. The ideal circuit
components used in a circuit model should represent the behavior of the
actual electrical components to an acceptable degree of accuracy. The tools of
circuit analysis 5, the focus of this book, are then applied to the circuit.
Circuit analysis uses mathematical techniques to predict the behavior of the
circuit model and its ideal circuit components. A comparison between the
desired behavior, from the design specifications, and the predicted behavior,
from circuit analysis, may lead to refinements in the circuit model and its
ideal circuit elements. Once the desired and predicted behaviors are in
agreement, a physical prototype 6 can be constructed.
The physical prototype is an actual electrical system, constructed from
actual electrical components. Measurements determine the quantitative
behavior of the physical system. This actual behavior is compared with the
desired behavior from the design specifications and the predicted behavior
from circuit analysis. The comparisons may result in refinements to the
physical prototype, the circuit model, or both. This iterative process, in which
models, components, and systems are continually refined, usually produces a
design that accurately satisfies the design specifications and thus meets the
need.
Circuit analysis clearly plays a very important role in the design process.
Because circuit analysis is applied to circuit models, practicing engineers try
to use mature circuit models so that the resulting designs will meet the design
specifications in the first iteration. In this book, we use models that have been
tested for at least 40 years; you can assume that they are mature. The ability

to model actual electrical systems with ideal circuit elements makes circuit
theory extremely useful to engineers.
Saying that the interconnection of ideal circuit elements can be used to
quantitatively predict the behavior of a system implies that we can describe
the interconnection with mathematical equations. For the mathematical
equations to be useful, we must write them in terms of measurable quantities.
In the case of circuits, these quantities are voltage and current, which we
discuss in Section 1.4. The study of circuit analysis involves understanding
the behavior of each ideal circuit element in terms of its voltage and current
and understanding the constraints imposed on the voltage and current as a
result of interconnecting the ideal elements.

1.4 Voltage and Current
The concept of electric charge is the basis for describing all electrical
phenomena. Let’s review some important characteristics of electric charge.
Electric charge is bipolar, meaning that electrical effects are described in
terms of positive and negative charges.
Electric charge exists in discrete quantities, which are integer multiples
of the electronic charge, 1.6022×10−19 C.
Electrical effects are attributed to both the separation of charge and
charges in motion.
In circuit theory, the separation of charge creates an electric force (voltage),
and the motion of charge creates an electric fluid (current).
The concepts of voltage and current are useful from an engineering point of
view because they can be expressed quantitatively. Whenever positive and
negative charges are separated, energy is expended. Voltage is the energy per
unit charge created by the separation. We express this ratio in differential
form as
Definition of Voltage
v=dwdq, (1.1)
where
v=the voltage in volts,w=the energy in joules,q=the charge in coulombs.
The electrical effects caused by charges in motion depend on the rate of
charge flow. The rate of charge flow is known as the electric current, which
is expressed as

Definition of Current
i=dqdt, (1.2)
where
i=the current in amperes,q=the charge in coulombs,t=the time in seconds.
Equations 1.1 and 1.2 define the magnitude of voltage and current,
respectively. The bipolar nature of electric charge requires that we assign
polarity references to these variables. We will do so in Section 1.5.
Although current is made up of discrete moving electrons, we do not need to
consider them individually because of the enormous number of them. Rather,
we can think of electrons and their corresponding charge as one smoothly
flowing entity. Thus, i is treated as a continuous variable.
One advantage of using circuit models is that we can model a component
strictly in terms of the voltage and current at its terminals. Thus, two
physically different components could have the same relationship between
the terminal voltage and terminal current. If they do, for purposes of circuit
analysis, they are identical. Once we know how a component behaves at its
terminals, we can analyze its behavior in a circuit. However, when
developing component models, we are interested in a component’s internal
behavior. We might want to know, for example, whether charge conduction
is taking place because of free electrons moving through the crystal lattice
structure of a metal or whether it is because of electrons moving within the
covalent bonds of a semiconductor material. These concerns are beyond the
realm of circuit theory, so in this book we use component models that have
already been developed.

1.5 The Ideal Basic Circuit Element
An ideal basic circuit element has three attributes.
1. It has only two terminals, which are points of connection to other circuit
components.
2. It is described mathematically in terms of current and/or voltage.
3. It cannot be subdivided into other elements.
Using the word ideal implies that a basic circuit element does not exist as a
realizable physical component. Ideal elements can be connected in order to
model actual devices and systems, as we discussed in Section 1.3. Using the
word basic implies that the circuit element cannot be further reduced or
subdivided into other elements. Thus, the basic circuit elements form the
building blocks for constructing circuit models, but they themselves cannot
be modeled with any other type of element.
Figure 1.5 represents an ideal basic circuit element. The box is blank because
we are making no commitment at this time as to the type of circuit element it
is. In Fig. 1.5, the voltage across the terminals of the box is denoted by v, and
the current in the circuit element is denoted by i. The plus and minus signs
indicate the polarity reference for the voltage, and the arrow placed alongside
the current indicates its reference direction. Table 1.4 interprets the voltage
polarity and current direction, given positive or negative numerical values of
v and i. Note that algebraically the notion of positive charge flowing in one
direction is equivalent to the notion of negative charge flowing in the
opposite direction.

circuit element.

Table 1.4 Interpretation of
Reference Directions in Fig. 1.5
Table 1.4 Full Alternative Text
Assigning the reference polarity for voltage and the reference direction for
current is entirely arbitrary. However, once you have assigned the references,
you must write all subsequent equations to agree with the chosen references.
The most widely used sign convention applied to these references is called
the passive sign convention, which we use throughout this book.

Passive Sign Convention
Whenever the reference direction for the current in an element is in the
direction of the reference voltage drop across the element (as in Fig. 1.5), use
a positive sign in any expression that relates the voltage to the current.
Otherwise, use a negative sign.
We apply this sign convention in all the analyses that follow. Our purpose for
introducing it even before we have introduced the different types of basic
circuit elements is to emphasize that selecting polarity references is not a
function either of the basic elements or the type of interconnections made
with the basic elements. We apply and interpret the passive sign convention
for power calculations in Section 1.6.
Example 1.2 illustrates one use of the equation defining current.
Example 1.2 Relating Current and
Charge
No charge exists at the upper terminal of the element in Fig. 1.5 for t<0. At
t=0, a 5 A current begins to flow into the upper terminal.
1. Derive the expression for the charge accumulating at the upper terminal
of the element for t>0.
2. If the current is stopped after 10 seconds, how much charge has
accumulated at the upper terminal?
Solution

1.6 Power and Energy
Power and energy calculations are important in circuit analysis. Although
voltage and current are useful variables in the analysis and design of
electrically based systems, the useful output of the system often is
nonelectrical (e.g., sound emitted from a speaker or light from a light bulb),
and this output is conveniently expressed in terms of power or energy. Also,
all practical devices have limitations on the amount of power that they can
handle. In the design process, therefore, voltage and current calculations by
themselves are not sufficient to determine whether or not a design meets its
specifications.
We now relate power and energy to voltage and current and at the same time
use the power calculation to illustrate the passive sign convention. Recall
from basic physics that power is the time rate of expending or absorbing
energy. (A water pump rated 75 kW can deliver more liters per second than
one rated 7.5 kW.) Mathematically, energy per unit time is expressed in the
form of a derivative, or
Definition of Power
p=dwdt, (1.3)
where
p=the power in watts,w=the energy in joules,t=the time in seconds.
Thus, 1 W is equivalent to 1 J/s.
The power associated with the flow of charge follows directly from the
definition of voltage and current in Eqs. 1.1 and 1.2, or
p=dwdt=(dwdq)(dqdt),

so
Power Equation
p=vi,(1.4)
where
p=the power in watts,v=the voltage in volts,i=the current in amperes.
Equation 1.4 shows that the power associated with a basic circuit element is
the product of the current in the element and the voltage across the element.
Therefore, power is a quantity associated with a circuit element, and we have
to determine from our calculation whether power is being delivered to the
circuit element or extracted from it. This information comes from correctly
applying and interpreting the passive sign convention (Section 1.5).
If we use the passive sign convention, Eq. 1.4 is correct if the reference
direction for the current is in the direction of the reference voltage drop
across the terminals. Otherwise, Eq. 1.4 must be written with a minus sign. In
other words, if the current reference is in the direction of a reference voltage
rise across the terminals, the expression for the power is
p=−vi.
The algebraic sign of power is based on charge movement through voltage
drops and rises. As positive charges move through a drop in voltage, they
lose energy, and as they move through a rise in voltage, they gain energy.
Figure 1.6 summarizes the relationship between the polarity references for
voltage and current and the expression for power.

We can now state the rule for interpreting the algebraic sign of power:
Interpreting Algebraic Sign of
Power
If the power is positive (that is, if p>0), power is being delivered to the
circuit element represented by the box.
If the power is negative (that is, if p<0), power is being extracted from
the circuit element.
Example 1.3 shows that the passive sign convention generates the correct
sign for power regardless of the voltage polarity and current direction you
choose.
Example 1.3 Using the Passive Sign
Convention
1. Suppose you have selected the polarity references shown in Fig. 1.6(b).
Your calculations for the current and voltage yield the following
numerical results:

i=4 A   and   v=−10 V.
Calculate the power associated with the circuit element and determine
whether it is absorbing or supplying power.
2. Your classmate is solving the same problem but has chosen the
reference polarities shown in Fig. 1.6(c). Her calculations for the current
and voltage show that
i=−4 A   and   v=10 V.
What power does she calculate?
Solution
1. The power associated with the circuit element in Fig. 1.6(b) is
p=−(−10)(4)=40 W.
Thus, the circuit element is absorbing 40 W.
2. Your classmate calculates that the power associated with the circuit
element in Fig. 1.6(c) is
p=−(10)(−4)=40 W.
Using the reference system in Fig. 1.6(c) gives the same conclusion as
using the reference system in Fig. 1.6(b)—namely, that the circuit
element is absorbing 40 W. In fact, any of the reference systems in Fig.
1.6 yields this same result.
Example 1.4 illustrates the relationship between voltage, current, power, and
energy for an ideal basic circuit element and the use of the passive sign
convention.
Example 1.4 Relating Voltage,

Current, Power, and Energy
Assume that the voltage at the terminals of the element in Fig. 1.5, whose
current was defined in Assessment Problem 1.3, is
v=0t<0;v=10e−5000t kV, t≥0.
1. Calculate the power supplied to the element at 1 ms.
2. Calculate the total energy (in joules) delivered to the circuit element.
Solution
1. Since the current is entering the + terminal of the voltage drop defined
for the element in Fig. 1.5, we use a “+” sign in the power equation.
p = vi = (10,000e−5000t)(20e−5000t) = 200,000e
−10,000t W.p(0.001)= 200,000e − 10,000(0.0001) = 200,000e
−10= 200,000(45.4×10−6) = 9.08 W.
2. From the definition of power given in Eq. 1.3, the expression for energy
is
w(t)=∫0tp(x)dx.
To find the total energy delivered, integrate the expresssion for power
from zero to infinity. Therefore,
wtotal=∫0∞200,000e−10,000x dx=200,000e−10,000x−10,000|0∞
=−20e−∞−(−20e−0 )=0+20=20 J.
Thus, the total energy supplied to the circuit element is 20 J.

The power calculations show that components a, b, and d are supplying

are absorbing power. Now check to see if the power balances by finding the
total power supplied and the total power absorbed.

Something is wrong—if the values for voltage and current in this circuit are
correct, the total power should be zero! There is an error in the data, and we
can find it from the calculated powers if the error exists in the sign of a single
component. Note that if we divide the total power by 2, we get −10 W, which
is the power calculated for component d. If the power for component d is
+10 W, the total power would be 0. Circuit analysis techniques from
upcoming chapters can be used to show that the current through component d
should be −1 A, not +1 A as given in Table 1.5.

Summary
The International System of Units (SI) enables engineers to
communicate in a meaningful way about quantitative results. Table 1.1
summarizes the SI units; Table 1.2 presents some useful derived SI
units. (See page 10.)
A circuit model is a mathematical representation of an electrical system.
Circuit analysis, used to predict the behavior of a circuit model, is based
on the variables of voltage and current. (See page 12.)
Voltage is the energy per unit charge created by charge separation
and has the SI unit of volt. (See page 13.)
v=dw/dq
Current is the rate of charge flow and has the SI unit of ampere.
(See page 13.)
i=dq/dt
The ideal basic circuit element is a two-terminal component that
cannot be subdivided; it can be described mathematically in terms of its
terminal voltage and current. (See page 14.)
The passive sign convention uses a positive sign in the expression that
relates the voltage and current at the terminals of an element when the
reference direction for the current through the element is in the direction
of the reference voltage drop across the element. (See page 14.)
Power is energy per unit of time and is equal to the product of the
terminal voltage and current; it has the SI unit of watt. (See page 16.)
p=dw/dt=vi
The algebraic sign of power is interpreted as follows:

If p>0, power is being delivered to the circuit or circuit component.
If p<0, power is being extracted from the circuit or circuit
component. (See page 16.)

inductors
capacitors
In this chapter, we discuss the characteristics of the first three circuit
elements—voltage sources, current sources, and resistors. Although this may
seem like a small number of elements, many practical systems can be
modeled with just sources and resistors. They are also a useful starting point
because of their relative simplicity; the mathematical relationships between
voltage and current in sources and resistors are algebraic. Thus, you will be
able to begin learning the basic techniques of circuit analysis with only
algebraic manipulations.
We will postpone introducing inductors and capacitors until Chapter 6,
because their use requires that you solve integral and differential equations.

However, the basic analytical techniques for solving circuits with inductors
and capacitors are the same as those introduced in this chapter. So, by the
time you need to begin manipulating more difficult equations, you should be
very familiar with the methods of writing them.
Practical Perspective
Heating with Electric Radiators
You want to heat your small garage using a couple of electric radiators. The
power and voltage requirements for each radiator are 1200 W, 240 V. But
you are not sure how to wire the radiators to the power supplied to the
garage. Should you use the wiring diagram on the left or the one on the right?
Does it make any difference?
Once you have studied the material in this chapter, you will be able to answer
these questions and determine how to heat the garage. The Practical
Perspective at the end of this chapter guides you through the analysis of two
circuits based on the two wiring diagrams shown below.

2.1 Voltage and Current Sources
An electrical source is a device capable of converting nonelectric energy to
electric energy and vice versa. For example, a discharging battery converts
chemical energy to electric energy, whereas a charging battery
converts electric energy to chemical energy. A dynamo is a machine that
converts mechanical energy to electric energy and vice versa. For operations
in the mechanical-to-electric mode, it is called a generator. For
transformations from electric to mechanical energy, it is called a motor.
Electric sources either deliver or absorb electric power while maintaining
either voltage or current. This behavior led to the creation of the ideal voltage
source and the ideal current source as basic circuit elements.
An ideal voltage source is a circuit element that maintains a prescribed
voltage across its terminals regardless of the current flowing in those
terminals.
An ideal current source is a circuit element that maintains a prescribed
current through its terminals regardless of the voltage across those
terminals.
These circuit elements do not exist as practical devices—they are idealized
models of actual voltage and current sources.
Using an ideal model for current and voltage sources constrains the
mathematical descriptions of these components. For example, because an
ideal voltage source provides a steady voltage even if the current in the
element changes, it is impossible to specify the current in an ideal voltage
source as a function of its voltage. Likewise, if the only information you have
about an ideal current source is the value of current supplied, it is impossible
to determine the voltage across that current source. We have sacrificed our
ability to relate voltage and current in a practical source for the simplicity of
using ideal sources in circuit analysis.
Ideal voltage and current sources can be further described as either

independent sources or dependent sources.
An independent source establishes a voltage or current in a circuit
without relying on voltages or currents elsewhere in the circuit. The
value of the voltage or current supplied is specified by the value of the
independent source alone.
A dependent source, in contrast, establishes a voltage or current whose
value depends on the value of a voltage or current elsewhere in the
circuit. You cannot specify the value of a dependent source unless you
know the value of the voltage or current on which it depends.
The circuit symbols for the ideal independent sources are shown in Fig. 2.1.
Note that a circle is used to represent an independent source. To completely
specify an ideal independent voltage source in a circuit, you must include the
value of the supplied voltage and the reference polarity, as shown in Fig.
2.1(a). Similarly, to completely specify an ideal independent current source,
you must include the value of the supplied current and its reference direction,
as shown in Fig. 2.1(b).
Figure 2.1 The circuit symbols
for (a) an ideal independent
voltage source and (b) an ideal
independent current source.

 
The circuit symbol for an ideal dependent source is a diamond, as shown in
Fig. 2.2. There are four possible variations because both dependent current
sources and dependent voltage sources can be controlled by either a voltage
or a current elsewhere in the circuit. Dependent sources are sometimes called
controlled sources.
Figure 2.2 (a) (b) Circuit
symbols for ideal dependent
voltage sources and (c) (d) ideal
dependent current sources.


Figure 2.2 Full Alternative Text
To completely specify an ideal dependent voltage-controlled voltage source,
you must identify the controlling voltage, the equation that permits you to
compute the supplied voltage from the controlling voltage, and the reference
polarity for the supplied voltage. For example, in Fig. 2.2(a), the controlling
voltage is vx, the equation that determines the supplied voltage vs is
vs=μvx,
and the reference polarity for vs is as indicated. Note that μ is a multiplying
constant that is dimensionless.
Similar requirements exist for completely specifying the other ideal
dependent sources. In Fig. 2.2(b), the controlling current is ix, the equation
for the supplied voltage vs is
vs=ρix,
the reference polarity is as shown, and the multiplying constant ρ has the
dimension volts per ampere. In Fig. 2.2(c), the controlling voltage is vx, the
equation for the supplied current is is
is=αvx,
the reference direction is as shown, and the multiplying constant α has the
dimension amperes per volt. In Fig. 2.2(d), the controlling current is ix, the
equation for the supplied current is is
is=βix,
the reference direction is as shown, and the multiplying constant β is
dimensionless.
Note that the ideal independent and dependent voltage and current sources
generate either constant voltages or currents, that is, voltages and currents
that are invariant with time. Constant sources are often called dc sources.
The dc stands for direct current, a description that has a historical basis but

can seem misleading now. Historically, a direct current was defined as a
current produced by a constant voltage. Therefore, a constant voltage became
known as a direct current, or dc, voltage. The use of dc for constant stuck,
and the terms dc current and dc voltage are now universally accepted in
science and engineering to mean constant current and constant voltage.
Finally, we note that ideal sources are examples of active circuit elements. An
active element is one that models a device capable of generating electric
energy. Passive elements model physical devices that cannot generate
electric energy. Resistors, inductors, and capacitors are examples of passive
circuit elements. Examples 2.1 and 2.2 illustrate how the characteristics of
ideal independent and dependent sources limit the types of permissible
interconnections of the sources.
Example 2.1 Testing
Interconnections of Ideal Sources
Use the definitions of the ideal independent voltage and current sources to
determine which interconnections in Fig. 2.3 are permitted and which violate
the constraints imposed by the ideal sources.
Figure 2.3 The circuits for
Example 2.1.



Solution
Connection (a) is permitted. Each source supplies voltage across the same
pair of terminals, marked a and b. This requires that each source supply the
same voltage with the same polarity, which they do.
Connection (b) is permitted. Each source supplies current through the same
pair of terminals, marked a and b. This requires that each source supply the
same current in the same direction, which they do.
Connection (c) is not permitted. Each source supplies voltage across the same
pair of terminals, marked a and b. This requires that each source supply the
same voltage with the same polarity, which they do not.
Connection (d) is not permitted. Each source supplies current through the
same pair of terminals, marked a and b. This requires that each source supply
the same current in the same direction, which they do not.
Connection (e) is permitted. The voltage source supplies voltage across the
pair of terminals marked a and b. The current source supplies current through
the same pair of terminals. Because an ideal voltage source supplies the same

voltage regardless of the current, and an ideal current source supplies the
same current regardless of the voltage, this connection is permitted.

Solution
Connection (a) is not permitted. Both the independent source and the
dependent source supply voltage across the same pair of terminals, labeled a

polarity. The independent source supplies 5 V, but the dependent source
supplies 15 V.
Connection (b) is permitted. The independent voltage source supplies voltage
across the pair of terminals marked a and b. The dependent current source
supplies current through the same pair of terminals. Because an ideal voltage
source supplies the same voltage regardless of current, and an ideal current
source supplies the same current regardless of voltage, this is a valid
connection.
Connection (c) is permitted. The independent current source supplies current
through the pair of terminals marked a and b. The dependent voltage source
supplies voltage across the same pair of terminals. Because an ideal current
source supplies the same current regardless of voltage, and an ideal voltage

source supplies the same voltage regardless of current, this is a valid
connection.
Connection (d) is not permitted. Both the independent source and the
dependent source supply current through the same pair of terminals, labeled a
and b. This requires that each source supply the same current in the same
direction. The independent source supplies 2 A, but the dependent source
supplies 6 A in the opposite direction.

2.2 Electrical Resistance (Ohm’s
Law)
Resistance is the capacity of materials to impede the flow of current or, more
specifically, the flow of electric charge. The circuit element modeling this
behavior is the resistor. Figure 2.5 shows the resistor’s circuit symbol, with
R denoting the resistance value of the resistor.
Figure 2.5 The circuit symbol
for a resistor having a
resistance R.
To understand resistance, think about the electrons that make up electric
current moving through, interacting with, and being resisted by the atomic
structure of some material. The interactions convert some electric energy to
thermal energy, dissipated as heat. Many useful electrical devices take
advantage of resistance heating, including stoves, toasters, irons, and space
heaters.
Most materials resist electric current; the amount of resistance depends on the
material. Metals like copper and aluminum have small values of resistance,
so they are often used as wires conducting electric current. When represented

in a circuit diagram, copper or aluminum wiring isn’t usually modeled as a
resistor; the wire’s resistance is so small compared to the resistance of other
circuit elements that we can neglect the wiring resistance to simplify the
diagram.
A resistor is an ideal basic circuit element, which is described mathematically
using its voltage and current. The relationship between voltage and current
for a resistor is known as Ohm’s law, after Georg Simon Ohm, a German
physicist who established its validity early in the nineteenth century.
Consider the resistor shown in Fig. 2.6(a), where the current in the resistor is
in the direction of the voltage drop across the resistor. For this resistor,
Ohm’s law is
Figure 2.6 Two possible
reference choices for the
current and voltage at the
terminals of a resistor and
the resulting equations.

Figure 2.6 Full Alternative Text
2.2-6 Full Alternative Text
Ohm’s Law

v=iR, (2.1)
where
v=the voltage in volts,i=the current in amperes,R=the resistance in ohms.
For the resistor in Fig. 2.6(b), Ohm’s law is
v=−iR, (2.2)
where v, i, and R are again measured in volts, amperes, and ohms,
respectively. We use the passive sign convention (Section 1.5) in determining
the algebraic signs in Eqs. 2.1 and 2.2.
Resistance is measured in the SI unit ohms. The Greek letter Omega ( Ω) is
the standard symbol for an ohm. The circuit diagram symbol for an 8 Ω
resistor is shown in Fig. 2.7.
Figure 2.7 The circuit symbol
for an 8 Ω resistor.
Ohm’s law expresses the voltage as a function of the current. However,
expressing the current as a function of the voltage also is convenient. Thus,
from Eq. 2.1,

i=vR , (2.3)
or, from Eq. 2.2,
i=−vR. (2.4)
The reciprocal of the resistance is referred to as conductance, is symbolized
by the letter G, and is measured in siemens (S). Thus,
G=1R. (2.5)
An 8 Ω resistor has a conductance value of 0.125 S.
Ideal resistors model the behavior of physical devices. The word ideal
reminds us that the resistor model makes several simplifying assumptions
about the behavior of actual resistive devices. Assuming the resistance of the
ideal resistor is constant, so that its value does not vary over time, is the most
important of these simplifications. Most actual resistive devices have a time-
varying resistance, often because the temperature of the device changes over
time. The ideal resistor model represents a physical device whose resistance
doesn’t vary much from some constant value over the time period of interest
in the circuit analysis. In this book, we assume that the simplifying
assumptions about resistance devices are valid, and we thus use ideal
resistors in circuit analysis.
We can calculate the power at the terminals of a resistor in several ways. The
first approach is to use the defining equation (Section 1.6) to calculate the
product of the terminal voltage and current. For the resistor shown in Fig.
2.6(a), we write
p=vi, (2.6)
and for the resistor shown in Fig. 2.6(b), we write
p=−vi. (2.7)
A second method expresses resistor power in terms of the current and the
resistance. Substituting Eq. 2.1 into Eq. 2.6, we obtain

p=vi=(i R)i
So
Power in a Resistor in Terms of
Current
p=i2 R. (2.8)
Likewise, substituting Eq. 2.2 into Eq. 2.7, we have
p=−vi=−(−i R)i=i 2R. (2.9)
Equations 2.8 and 2.9 are identical, demonstrating that regardless of voltage
polarity and current direction, the power at the terminals of a resistor is
positive. Therefore, resistors absorb power from the circuit.
A third method expresses resistor power in terms of the voltage and
resistance. The expression is independent of the polarity references, so
Power in a Resistor in Terms of
Voltage
p=v2R. (2.10)
Sometimes a resistor’s value will be expressed as a conductance rather than
as a resistance. Using the relationship between resistance and conductance
given in Eq. 2.5, we can also write Eqs. 2.9 and 2.10 in terms of the
conductance, or
p=i2G, (2.11)
p=v2G. (2.12)

Equations 2.6–2.12 provide a variety of methods for calculating the power
absorbed by a resistor. Each yields the same answer. In analyzing a circuit,
look at the information provided and choose the power equation that uses that
information directly.
Example 2.3 illustrates Ohm’s law for a circuit with an ideal source and a
resistor. Power calculations at the terminals of a resistor also are illustrated.

Current, and Power for a Simple

1. Calculate the values of v and i.

2. Determine the power dissipated in each resistor.
Solution
1. The voltage va in Fig. 2.8(a) is a drop in the direction of the resistor
current. The resistor voltage is the product of its current and its
resistance, so,
va=(1)(8)=8 V.
The current ib in the resistor with a conductance of 0.2 S in Fig. 2.8(b) is
in the direction of the voltage drop across the resistor. The resistor
current is the product of its voltage and its conductance, so
ib=(50)(0.2)=10 A.
The voltage vc in Fig. 2.8(c) is a rise in the direction of the resistor
current. The resistor voltage is the product of its current and its
resistance, so
vc=−(1)(20)=−20 V.
The current id in the 25 Ω resistor in Fig. 2.8(d) is in the direction of the
voltage rise across the resistor. The resistor current is its voltage divided
by its resistance, so
id=−5025=−2 A.
2. The power dissipated in each of the four resistors is
p8Ω=(8)28=(1)2(8)=8 W(using Eq. 2.10 and Eq. 2.9);

2.3 Constructing a Circuit Model
Let’s now move on to using ideal sources and resistors to construct circuit
models of real-world systems. Developing a circuit model of a device or
system is an important skill. Although this text emphasizes circuit-solving
skills, as an electrical engineer you’ll need other skills as well, one of the
most important of which is modeling.
We develop circuit models in the next two examples. In Example 2.4, we
construct a circuit model based on knowing how the system’s components
behave and how the components are interconnected. In Example 2.5, we
create a circuit model by measuring the terminal behavior of a device.

widely available flashlight.

Thom Lang/Corbis/Getty Imagess
Solution
When a flashlight is regarded as an electrical system, the components of
primary interest are the batteries, the lamp, the connector, the case, and the
switch. Figure 2.10 shows these components. We now consider the circuit
model for each component.
Figure 2.10 The arrangement
of flashlight components.


Figure 2.10 Full Alternative Text
A dry-cell battery maintains a reasonably constant terminal voltage if the
current demand is not excessive. Thus, if the dry-cell battery is operating
within its intended limits, we can model it with an ideal voltage source.
The prescribed voltage is constant and equal to the sum of two dry-cell
values.
The ultimate output of the lamp is light energy, the result of heating the
lamp’s filament to a temperature high enough to cause radiation in the
visible range. We can model the lamp with an ideal resistor. The resistor
accounts for the amount of electric energy converted to thermal energy,
but it does not predict how much of the thermal energy is converted to
light energy. The resistor representing the lamp also predicts the steady
current drain on the batteries, a characteristic of the system that also is of
interest. In this model, Rl symbolizes the lamp resistance.
The connector used in the flashlight serves a dual role. First, it provides
an electrical conductive path between the dry cells and the case. Second,
it is formed into a springy coil that applies mechanical pressure to the
contact between the batteries and the lamp, maintaining contact between
the two dry cells and between the dry cells and the lamp. Hence, in
choosing the wire for the connector, we may find that its mechanical
properties are more important than its electrical properties for the
flashlight design. Electrically, we can model the connector with an ideal
resistor with resistance R1.
The case also serves both a mechanical and an electrical purpose.
Mechanically, it contains all the other components and provides a grip
for the person using the flashlight. Electrically, it provides a connection
between other elements in the flashlight. If the case is metal, it conducts
current between the batteries and the lamp. If it is plastic, a metal strip
inside the case connects the coiled connector to the switch. An ideal
resistor with resistance Rc models the electrical connection provided by
the case.
The switch has two electrical states: on or off. An ideal switch in the on

state offers no resistance to the current, but it offers infinite resistance to
current in the off state. These two states represent the limiting values of
a resistor; that is, the on state corresponds to a zero resistance, called a
short circuit (R=0), and the off state corresponds to an infinite
resistance called an open circuit (R=∞). Figures 2.11(a) and (b) depict a
short circuit and an open circuit, respectively. The symbol shown in Fig.
2.11(c) represents a switch that can be either a short circuit or an open
circuit, depending on the position of its contacts.
Figure 2.11 Circuit symbols.
(a) Short circuit. (b) Open
circuit. (c) Switch.

We now construct the circuit model of the flashlight shown in Fig. 2.10.
Starting with the dry-cell batteries, the positive terminal of the first cell is
connected to the negative terminal of the second cell. The positive terminal of
the second cell is connected to one terminal of the lamp. The other terminal
of the lamp makes contact with one side of the switch, and the other side of
the switch is connected to the metal case. The metal spring connects the metal
case to the negative terminal of the first dry cell. Note that the connected
elements in Fig. 2.10 form a closed path or circuit. Figure 2.12 shows a
circuit model for the flashlight.
Figure 2.12 A circuit model for
a flashlight.

Figure 2.12 Full Alternative Text
Our flashlight example provides some general modeling guidelines.
1. The electrical behavior of each physical component is of primary
interest in a circuit model. In the flashlight model, three very different
physical components—a lamp, a coiled wire, and a metal case—are all
represented by resistors because each circuit component resists the
current flowing through the circuit.
2. Circuit models may need to account for undesired as well as desired
electrical effects. For example, the heat resulting from the lamp
resistance produces the light, a desired effect. However, the heat
resulting from the case and coil resistance represents an unwanted or
parasitic resistance. It drains the dry cells and produces no useful output.
Such parasitic effects must be considered, or the resulting model may
not adequately represent the system.
3. Modeling requires approximation. We made several simplifying
assumptions in developing the flashlight’s circuit model. For example,
we assumed an ideal switch, but in practical switches, contact resistance
may be large enough to interfere with proper operation of the system.
Our model does not predict this behavior. We also assumed that the

coiled connector exerts enough pressure to eliminate any contact
resistance between the dry cells. Our model does not predict the effect of
inadequate pressure. Our use of an ideal voltage source ignores any
internal dissipation of energy in the dry cells, which might be due to the
parasitic heating just mentioned. We could account for this by adding an
ideal resistor between the source and the lamp resistor. Our model
assumes the internal loss to be negligible.
We used a basic understanding of the internal components of the flashlight to
construct its circuit model. However, sometimes we know only the terminal
behavior of a device and must use this information to construct the model.
Example 2.5 presents such a modeling problem.
Example 2.5 Constructing a Circuit

Solution
Plotting the voltage as a function of the current yields the graph shown in Fig.
2.14(a). The equation of the line in this figure is vt=4it, so the terminal
voltage is directly proportional to the terminal current. Using Ohm’s law, the
device inside the box behaves like a 4 Ω resistor. Therefore, the circuit model
for the device inside the box is a 4 Ω resistor, as seen in Fig. 2.14(b).

2.4 Kirchhoff’s Laws
A circuit is solved when we determine the voltage across and the current in
every element. While Ohm’s law is an important tool for solving a circuit, it
may not be enough to provide a complete solution. Generally, we need two
additional algebraic relationships, known as Kirchhoff’s laws, to solve most
circuits.
Kirchhoff’s Current Law
Let’s try to solve the flashlight circuit from Example 2.4. We begin by
redrawing the circuit as shown in Fig. 2.15, with the switch in the on state.
We have labeled the current and voltage variables associated with each
resistor and the current associated with the voltage source, including
reference polarities. For convenience, we use the same subscript for the
voltage, current, and resistor labels. In Fig. 2.15, we also removed some of
the terminal dots of Fig. 2.12 and have inserted nodes. Terminal dots are the
start and end points of an individual circuit element. A node is a point where
two or more circuit elements meet. In Fig. 2.15, the nodes are labeled a, b, c,
and d. Node d connects the battery and the lamp and stretches all the way
across the top of the diagram, though we label a single point for convenience.
The dots on either side of the switch indicate its terminals, but only one is
needed to represent a node, labeled node c.
Figure 2.15

Circuit model of the flashlight with assigned voltage and current
variables.
Figure 2.15 Full Alternative Text
The circuit in Fig. 2.15 has seven unknowns: is, i1, ic, il, v1, vc, and vl.
Recall that vs=3 V, as it represents the sum of the terminal voltages of the
two dry cells. To solve the flashlight circuit, we must find values for the
seven unknown variables. From algebra, you know that to find n unknown
quantities you must solve n simultaneous independent equations. Applying
Ohm’s law (Section 2.2) to each of the three resistors gives us three of the
seven equations we need:
v1=i1R1, (2.13)
vc=icRc, (2.14)
vl=ilRl. (2.15)
What about the other four equations?

Connecting the circuit elements constrains the relationships among the
terminal voltages and currents. These constraints are called Kirchhoff’s laws,
after Gustav Kirchhoff, who first stated them in a paper published in 1848.
The two laws that state the constraints in mathematical form are known as
Kirchhoff’s current law and Kirchhoff’s voltage law.
We can now state Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL):
Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL)
The algebraic sum of all the currents at any node in a circuit equals zero.
To use Kirchhoff’s current law at a node, assign an algebraic sign
corresponding to the current’s reference direction for every current at the
node. Assigning a positive sign to a current leaving the node requires
assigning a negative sign to a current entering a node. Conversely, giving a
negative sign to a current leaving a node requires giving a positive sign to a
current entering a node.
We apply Kirchhoff’s current law to the four nodes in the circuit shown in
Fig. 2.15, using the convention that currents leaving a node are positive. The
four equations are:
node ais−i1=0, (2.16)
node bi1+ic=0, (2.17)
node c−ic−il=0, (2.18)
node dil−is=0. (2.19)
But Eqs. 2.16–2.19 are not an independent set because any one of the four
can be derived from the other three. In any circuit with n nodes, n−1
independent equations can be derived from Kirchhoff’s current law.1 Let’s
disregard Eq. 2.19 so that we have six independent equations, namely, Eqs.
2.13–2.18. We need one more, which we can derive from Kirchhoff’s voltage
law.
1 We say more about this observation in Chapter 4.

Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law
Before we can state Kirchhoff’s voltage law, we must define a closed path or
loop. Starting at an arbitrarily selected node, we trace a closed path in a
circuit through selected basic circuit elements and return to the original node
without passing through any intermediate node more than once. The circuit
shown in Fig. 2.15 has only one closed path or loop. For example, choosing
node a as the starting point and tracing the circuit clockwise, we form the
closed path by moving through nodes d, c, b, and back to node a. We can
now state Kirchhoff’s voltage law (KVL):
Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL)
The algebraic sum of all the voltages around any closed path in a circuit
equals zero.
To use Kirchhoff’s voltage law, assign an algebraic sign (reference direction)
to each voltage in the loop. As we trace a closed path, a voltage will appear
either as a rise or a drop in the tracing direction. Assigning a positive sign to
a voltage rise requires assigning a negative sign to a voltage drop.
Conversely, giving a negative sign to a voltage rise requires giving a positive
sign to a voltage drop.
We now apply Kirchhoff’s voltage law to the circuit shown in Fig. 2.15,
tracing the closed path clockwise and assigning a positive algebraic sign to
voltage drops. Starting at node d leads to the expression
vl−vc+v1−vs=0. (2.20)
Now we have the seven independent equations needed to find the seven
unknown circuit variables in Fig. 2.15.
Solving seven simultaneous equations for the simple flashlight lamp seems
excessive. In the coming chapters, we present analytical techniques that solve
a simple one-loop circuit like the one shown in Fig. 2.15 using a single

equation. Before leaving the flashlight circuit, we observe two analysis
details that are important for the techniques presented in subsequent chapters.
1. If you know the current in a resistor, you also know the voltage across
the resistor because current and voltage are directly related through
Ohm’s law. Thus, you can associate one unknown variable with each
resistor, either the current or the voltage. For example, choose the
current as the unknown variable. Once you solve for the unknown
current in the resistor, you can find the voltage across the resistor. In
general, if you know the current in a passive element, you can find the
voltage across it, greatly reducing the number of simultaneous equations
to solve. In the flashlight circuit, choosing the current as the unknown
variable eliminates the voltages vc, vl, and v1 as unknowns, and reduces
the analytical task to solving four simultaneous equations rather than
seven.
2. When only two elements connect to a node, if you know the current in
one of the elements, you also know it in the second element by applying
Kirchhoff’s current law at the node. When just two elements connect at
a single node, the elements are said to be in series, and you need to
define only one unknown current for the two elements. Note that each
node in the circuit shown in Fig. 2.15 connects only two elements, so
you need to define only one unknown current. Equations 2.16–2.18 lead
directly to
is=i1=−ic=il,
which states that if you know any one of the element currents, you know
them all. For example, choosing is as the unknown eliminates i1, ic, and
il. The problem is reduced to determining one unknown, namely, is.
Examples 2.6 and 2.7 illustrate how to write circuit equations based on
Kirchhoff’s laws. Example 2.8 illustrates how to use Kirchhoff’s laws and
Ohm’s law to find an unknown current. Example 2.9 expands on the
technique presented in Example 2.5 for constructing a circuit model for a
device whose terminal characteristics are known.

2. Test the solution for io by verifying that the total power generated
equals the total power dissipated.
Solution
1. We begin by redrawing the circuit and assigning an unknown current to
the 50 Ω resistor and unknown voltages across the 10 Ω and 50 Ω
resistors. Figure 2.19 shows the circuit. The nodes are labeled a, b, and c
to aid the discussion.
Figure 2.19

The circuit shown in Fig. 2.18, with the unknowns i1, υ1, and
υ1 defined.
Figure 2.19 Full Alternative Text
Because io also is the current in the 120 V source, we have two
unknown currents and therefore must derive two simultaneous equations
involving io and i1. One of the equations results from applying
Kirchhoff’s current law to either node b or c. Summing the currents at
node b and assigning a positive sign to the currents leaving the node
gives
i1−io− 6=0.
We obtain the second equation from Kirchhoff’s voltage law in
combination with Ohm’s law. Noting from Ohm’s law that vo=10io and
v1=50i1, we sum the voltages clockwise around the closed path c-a-b-c
to obtain
−120+10io+50i1=0.
In writing this equation, we assigned a positive sign to voltage drops in
the clockwise direction. Solving these two equations (see Appendix A)

for io and i1 yields
io=−3 A    and    i1=3 A.
2. The power for the 50 Ω resistor is
p50Ω=(i1)2(50)=(3)2(50)=450 W.
The power for the 10 Ω resistor is
p10Ω=(io)2(10)=(−3)2(10)=90 W.
The power for the 120 V source is
p120V=−120io=−120(−3)=360 W.
The power for the 6 A source is
                  p6A=
−v1(6),   and   v1=50i1=50(3)=150 V;   therefore   p6A=−150(6)=
−900 W.
The 6 A source is delivering 900 W, and the 120 V source and the two
resistors are absorbing power. The total power absorbed is p6A+p50Ω
+p10Ω=360+450+90=900 W.
Therefore, the solution verifies that the power delivered equals the
power absorbed.

What circuit model components produce this relationship between
voltage and current? Kirchhoff’s voltage law tells us that the voltage
drops across two components in series add. From the equation, one of
those components produces a 30 V drop regardless of the current, so this
component’s model is an ideal independent voltage source. The other
component produces a positive voltage drop in the direction of the
current it. Because the voltage drop is proportional to the current, Ohm’s
law tells us that this component’s model is an ideal resistor with a value
of 5 Ω. The resulting circuit model is depicted in the dashed box in Fig.
2.21(b).
2. Now we attach a 10 Ω resistor to the device in Fig. 2.21(b) to complete
the circuit. Kirchhoff’s current law tells us that the current in the 10 Ω
resistor equals the current in the 5 Ω resistor. Using Kirchhoff’s voltage
law and Ohm’s law, we can write the equation for the voltage drops
around the circuit, starting at the voltage source and proceeding
clockwise:
−30+5i+10i=0.
Solving for i, we get

i=2 A.
This is the value of current flowing in the 10 Ω resistor, so compute the
resistor’s power using the equation p=i2R:

2.5 Analyzing a Circuit Containing
Dependent Sources
We conclude this introduction to elementary circuit analysis by considering
circuits with dependent sources. One such circuit is shown in Fig. 2.22.
Figure 2.22
A circuit with a dependent source.
Figure 2.22 Full Alternative Text
We want to use Kirchhoff’s laws and Ohm’s law to find vo in this circuit.
Before writing equations, it is good practice to examine the circuit diagram
closely. This will help us identify the information that is known and the
information we must calculate. It may also help us devise a strategy for
solving the circuit using only a few calculations.

A look at the circuit in Fig. 2.22 reveals that:
Once we know io, we can calculate vo using Ohm’s law.
Once we know iΔ, we also know the current supplied by the dependent
source 5iΔ.
The current in the 500 V source is iΔ, using Kirchhoff’s current law at
node a.
There are thus two unknown currents, iΔ and io. We need to construct and
solve two independent equations involving these two currents to produce a
value for vo. This is the approach used in Example 2.10.
Example 2.10 Analyzing a Circuit
with a Dependent Source
Find the voltage vo for the circuit in Fig. 2.22.
Solution
The closed path consisting of the voltage source, the 5 Ω resistor, and the
20 Ω resistor contains the two unknown currents. Apply Kirchhoff’s voltage
law around this closed path, using Ohm’s law to express the voltage across
the resistors in terms of the currents in those resistors. Starting at node c and
traversing the path clockwise gives:
−500+5iΔ+20io=0.
Now we need a second equation containing these two currents. We can’t
apply Kirchhoff’s voltage law to the closed path formed by the 20 Ω resistor
and the dependent current source because we don’t know the value of the
voltage across the dependent current source. For this same reason, we cannot
apply Kirchhoff’s voltage law to the closed path containing the voltage

source, the 5 Ω resistor, and the dependent source.
We turn to Kirchhoff’s current law to generate the second equation. Either
node b or node c can be used to construct the second equation from
Kirchhoff’s current law, since we have already used node a to determine that
the current in the voltage source and the 5 Ω resistor is the same. We select
node b and produce the following equation, summing the currents leaving the
node:
−iΔ+io−5iΔ=0.
Solve the KCL equation for io in terms of iΔ(io=6iΔ), and then substitute this
expression for io into the KVL equation to give
500=5iΔ+20(6iΔ)=125iΔ.
Therefore,
iΔ=500/125=4 A      and       io=6(4)=24 A.
Using io and Ohm’s law for the 20 Ω resistor, we can solve for the voltage
vo:
vo=20io=480 V.
Think about a circuit analysis strategy before beginning to write equations
because not every closed path yields a useful Kirchhoff’s voltage law
equation and not every node yields a useful Kirchhoff’s current law equation.
Think about the problem and select a fruitful approach and useful analysis
tools to reduce the number and complexity of equations to be solved.
Example 2.11 applies Ohm’s law and Kirchhoff’s laws to another circuit with
a dependent source. Example 2.12 involves a much more complicated circuit,
but with a careful choice of analysis tools, the analysis is relatively
uncomplicated.
Example 2.11 Applying Ohm’s Law

and Kirchhoff’s Laws to Find an
Unknown Voltage

Fig. 2.23.

Example 2.11.
Figure 2.23 Full Alternative Text
2. Show that your solution is consistent with the requirement that the total
power developed in the circuit equals the total power dissipated.
Solution

1. A close look at the circuit in Fig. 2.23 reveals that:
There are two closed paths, the one on the left with the current is
and the one on the right with the current io.
Once io is known, we can compute vo using Ohm’s law.
We need two equations for the two currents. Because there are two
closed paths and both have voltage sources, we can apply Kirchhoff’s
voltage law to each, using Ohm’s law to express the voltage across the
resistors in terms of the current in those resistors. The resulting
equations are:
−10+6is=0 and −3is+2io+3io=0.
Solving for the currents yields
is=1.67 A and io=1 A.
Applying Ohm’s law to the 3 Ω resistor gives the desired voltage:
vo=3io=3 V.
2. To compute the power delivered to the voltage sources, we use the
power equation, p=vi, together with the passive sign convention. The
power for the independent voltage source is
p=−10is=−10(1.67)=−16.7 W.
The power for the dependent voltage source is
p=−(3is)io=−(5)(1)=−5 W.
Both sources are supplying power, and the total power supplied is 21.7
W.
To compute the power for the resistors, we use the power equation,
p=i2R. The power for the 6 Ω resistor is

p=(1.67)2(6)=16.7 W.
The power for the 2 Ω resistor is
p=(1)2(2)=2 W.
The power for the 3 Ω resistor is
p=(1)2(3)=3 W.
The resistors all absorb power, and the total power absorbed is 21.7 W,
equal to the total power supplied by the sources.

1. Develop the equations needed to determine the current in each element
of this circuit.
2. From these equations, devise a formula for computing iB in terms of the
circuit element values.
Solution
Carefully examine the circuit to identify six unknown currents, designated i1,
i2, iB, iC, iE, and iCC. In defining these six unknown currents, we observed
that the resistor RC is in series with the dependent current source βiB, so
these two components have the same current. We now must derive six
independent equations involving these six unknowns.
1. We can derive three equations by applying Kirchhoff’s current law to
any three of the nodes a, b, c, and d. Let’s use nodes a, b, and c and label
the currents away from the nodes as positive:
1. i1+ iC−iCC=0,
2. iB+ i2−i1=0,
3. iE−iB−iC=0.
A fourth equation results from imposing the constraint presented by
the series connection of RC and the dependent source:
4. iC=βiB.
We use Kirchhoff’s voltage law to derive the remaining two
equations. We must select two closed paths, one for each
Kirchhoff’s voltage law equation. The voltage across the dependent
current source is unknown and cannot be determined from the
source current βiB, so select two closed paths that do not contain
this dependent current source.
We choose the paths b-c-d-b and b-a-d-b, then use Ohm’s law to
express resistor voltage in terms of resistor current. Traverse the
paths in the clockwise direction and specify voltage drops as

positive to yield
5. V0+iERE−i2R2=0,
6. −i1R1+ VCC−i2R2=0.
2. To get a single equation for iB in terms of the known circuit variables,
you can follow these steps:
Solve Eq. (6) for i1, and substitute this solution for i1 into Eq. (2).
Solve the transformed Eq. (2) for i2, and substitute this solution for
i2 into Eq. (5).
Solve the transformed Eq. (5) for iE, and substitute this solution for
iE into Eq. (3). Use Eq. (4) to eliminate iC in Eq. (3).
Solve the transformed Eq. (3) for iB, and rearrange the terms to
yield
iB=(VCCR2)/(R1+R2)−V0(R1R2)/(R1+R2)+(1+β)RE. (2.21)
Problem 2.38 asks you to verify these steps. Note that once we know iB, we
can easily obtain the remaining currents.

Practical Perspective
Heating with Electric Radiators
Let’s determine which of the two wiring diagrams introduced at the
beginning of this chapter should be used to wire the electric radiators to the

power supplied to the garage. We begin with the diagram shown in Fig. 2.25.
We can turn this into a circuit by modeling the radiators as resistors. The
resulting circuit is shown in Fig. 2.26. Note that each radiator has the same
resistance, R, and is labeled with a voltage and current value.
Figure 2.25
A wiring diagram for two radiators.
Figure 2.26

A circuit based on Fig. 2.25.
Figure 2.26 Full Alternative Text
To find the unknown voltages and currents for the circuit in Fig. 2.26, begin
by using Kirchhoff’s voltage law to sum the voltage drops around the path on
the circuit’s left side:
−240+v1=0  ⇒  v1=240 V.
Now use Kirchhoff’s voltage law to sum the voltage drops around the path on
the circuit’s right side:
−v1+ v2=0    ⇒   v2=v1=240 V.
Remember that the power and voltage specifications for each radiator are
1200 W, 240 V. Therefore, the configuration shown in Fig. 2.25 satisfies the
voltage specification, since each radiator would have a supplied voltage of
240 V.
Next, calculate the value of resistance R that correctly models each radiator.
We want the power associated with each radiator to be 1200 W. Use the
equation for resistor power that involves the resistance and the voltage:
P1=v12R=v22R=P2  ⇒  R=v12P1=24021200=48 Ω.

Each radiator can be modeled as a 48 Ω resistor, with a voltage drop of 240 V
and power of 1200 W. The total power for two radiators is thus 2400 W.
Finally, calculate the power for the 240 V source. To do this, calculate the
current in the voltage source, is, using Kirchhoff’s current law to sum the
currents leaving the top node in Fig. 2.26. Then use is to find the power for
the voltage source.
−is+i1+i2=0  ⇒  is=i1+i2=v1R+v2R=24048 + 24048=10 A.
ps=−(240)(is)=−(240)(10)=−2400 W.
Thus, the total power in the circuit is −2400+2400=0, and the power
balances.
Now look at the other wiring diagram for the radiators, shown in Fig. 2.27.
We know that the radiators can be modeled using 48 Ω resistors, which are
used to turn the wiring diagram into the circuit in Fig. 2.28.
Figure 2.27

Another way to wire two radiators.
Figure 2.28
A circuit based on Fig. 2.27.
Figure 2.28 Full Alternative Text
Start analyzing the circuit in Fig. 2.28 by using Kirchhoff’s voltage law to
sum the voltage drops around the closed path:
−240+vx+ vy=0  ⇒  vx+ vy=240.
Next, use Kirchhoff’s current law to sum to currents leaving the node labeled
a:
−ix+ iy=0  ⇒  ix=iy=i.

The current in the two resistors is the same, and we can use that current in
Ohm’s law equations to replace the two unknown voltages in the Kirchhoff’s
voltage law equation:
48i+ 48i=240=96i  ⇒  i=24096=2.5 A.
Use the current in the two resistors to calculate the power for the two
radiators.
Px=Py=Ri2=(48)(2.5)2=300 W.
Thus, if the radiators are wired as shown in Fig. 2.27, their total power is 600
W. This is insufficient to heat the garage.
Therefore, the way the radiators are wired has a big impact on the amount of
heat that will be supplied. When they are wired using the diagram in Fig.
2.25, 2400 W of power will be available, but when they are wired using the
diagram in Fig. 2.27, only 600 W of power will be available.

Summary
The circuit elements introduced in this chapter are voltage sources,
current sources, and resistors:
An ideal voltage source maintains a prescribed voltage regardless
of the current in the source. An ideal current source maintains a
prescribed current regardless of the voltage across the source.
Voltage and current sources are either independent, that is, not
influenced by any other current or voltage in the circuit, or
dependent, that is, determined by some other current or voltage in
the circuit. (See .)
A resistor constrains its voltage and current to be proportional to
each other. The value of the proportional constant relating voltage
and current in a resistor is called its resistance and is measured in
ohms. (See .)
Ohm’s law establishes the proportionality of voltage and current in a
resistor. Specifically,
v=iR
if the current flow in the resistor is in the direction of the voltage drop
across it, or
v=−iR
if the current flow in the resistor is in the direction of the voltage rise
across it. (See .)
By combining the equation for power, p=vi, with Ohm’s law, we can
determine the power absorbed by a resistor:
p=i2R=v2/R.

(See pages 33–34.)
Circuits have nodes and closed paths. A node is a point where two or
more circuit elements join. When just two elements connect to form a
node, they are said to be in series. A closed path is a loop traced
through connecting elements, starting and ending at the same node and
encountering intermediate nodes only once each. (See pages 39–40.)
The voltages and currents of interconnected circuit elements obey
Kirchhoff’s laws:
Kirchhoff’s current law states that the algebraic sum of all the
currents at any node in a circuit equals zero. (See page 39.)
Kirchhoff’s voltage law states that the algebraic sum of all the
voltages around any closed path in a circuit equals zero. (See page
40.)
A circuit is solved when the voltage across and the current in every
element have been determined. By combining an understanding of
independent and dependent sources, Ohm’s law, and Kirchhoff’s laws,
we can solve many simple circuits.

implemented with three-way and four-way switches. A three-way switch
is a three-terminal, two-position switch, and a four-way switch is a four-

Chapter Objectives
1. Be able to recognize resistors connected in series and in parallel and use
the rules for combining series-connected resistors and parallel-connected
resistors to yield equivalent resistance.
2. Know how to design simple voltage-divider and current-divider circuits.
3. Be able to use voltage division and current division appropriately to
solve simple circuits.
4. Be able to determine the reading of an ammeter when added to a circuit
to measure current; be able to determine the reading of a voltmeter when

5. Understand how a Wheatstone bridge is used to measure resistance.
6. Know when and how to use delta-to-wye equivalent circuits to solve
simple circuits.
This chapter focuses on two important circuit element interconnections:
series connections and parallel connections.
When resistors are connected in series and in parallel, we can combine
these resistors into equivalent resistors, reducing the number of circuit
elements and the circuit’s complexity, and simplifying the circuit
analysis.
When a voltage source is connected to two or more resistors in series,
the supplied voltage divides across the resistors. This common
configuration is used as a voltage divider that outputs a specific
(desired) voltage, smaller than the supplied voltage. We introduce
voltage division, a new tool that simplifies the analysis of these circuits.
When a current source is connected to two or more resistors in parallel,
the supplied current divides among the resistors. This common

configuration is used as a current divider that outputs a specific (desired)
current, smaller than the supplied current. We introduce current division,
a new tool that simplifies the analysis of these circuits.
Finally, we look at three important measurement instruments.
The ammeter, which is a practical application of the current divider, is
used to measure current.
The voltmeter, which is a practical application of the voltage divider, is
used to measure voltage.
The Wheatstone bridge, which introduces two new interconnections
known as delta and wye connections, is used to measure resistance.
Practical Perspective
Resistive Touch Screens
Many mobile phones and tablet computers use touch screens created by
applying a transparent resistive material to the glass or acrylic screens. Two
screens are typically used, separated by a transparent insulating layer. We can
model a touch screen as a grid of resistors in the x-direction and a grid of
resistors in the y-direction. The figure on the right depicts one row of the grid
in the x-direction, with terminals x1 and x2, and one column of the grid in the
y-direction, with terminals y1 and y2.
A separate electronic circuit repeatedly applies a voltage drop across the grid
in the x-direction (between the points x1 and x2), then removes that voltage
and applies a voltage drop across the grid in the y-direction (between points
y1 and y2). When the screen is touched, the two resistive layers are pressed
together, creating a voltage that is sensed in the x-grid and another voltage
that is sensed in the y-grid. These two voltages precisely locate the point
where the screen was touched.

How is the voltage created by touching the screen related to the position
where the screen was touched? How are the properties of the grids used to
calculate the touch position? We will answer these questions in the Practical
Perspective at the end of this chapter. The circuit analysis required to answer
these questions uses some of the new tools developed in this chapter.

3.1 Resistors in Series
In Chapter 2, we learned that two elements connected at a single node are
said to be in series. For example, the seven resistors in Fig. 3.1 are connected
in series. Series-connected circuit elements carry the same current.
Applying Kirchhoff’s current law to each node in the circuit, we can show
that these resistors carry the same current. The series interconnection in Fig.
3.1 requires that
Figure 3.1 Resistors connected

Figure 3.1 Full Alternative Text
is=i1= −i2=i3=i4=−i5=−i6=i7,
so if we know any one of the seven currents, we know them all. Thus, we can
redraw Fig. 3.1 as shown in Fig. 3.2, using the single current is.

Figure 3.2 Series resistors with
a single unknown current is.
Figure 3.2 Full Alternative Text
To find is, we apply Kirchhoff’s voltage law around the single closed loop in
the clockwise direction. Defining the voltage across each resistor as a drop in
the direction of is (Ohm’s law) gives
−vs+isR1+isR2+isR3+isR4+isR5+isR6+isR7=0,
or
vs=is(R1+R2+R3+R4+R5+R6+R7).
This equation tells us we can simplify the circuit in Fig. 3.2 by replacing the
seven resistors with a single equivalent resistor, Req, whose numerical value
is the sum of the individual resistors; that is,
Req=R1+R2+R3+R4+R5+R6+R7

and
vs=isReq.
Thus, we can redraw Fig. 3.2 as shown in Fig. 3.3, which is a much simpler
circuit.

In general, if k resistors are connected in series, the equivalent single resistor

Combining Resistors in Series

Note that the resistance of the equivalent resistor is always larger than the
largest resistor in the series connection.
Think about equivalent resistance by visualizing the series-connected
resistors inside a black box, depicted on the left of Fig. 3.4. (An electrical
engineer uses the term black box to imply an opaque container; that is, the
contents are hidden from view.) The single equivalent resistor is in a second
black box, on the right of Fig. 3.4. We can derive the equation for the
equivalent resistor by writing the equations relating voltage and current for
each black box and finding the condition that makes these two equations
equivalent, given in Eq. 3.1 when k=7.

3.2 Resistors in Parallel
Two elements connected at both of their nodes are said to be in parallel. For
example, the four resistors in the circuit in Fig. 3.5 are in parallel. Parallel-
connected circuit elements have the same voltage across their terminals.
Don’t assume that two elements are parallel connected merely because they
are lined up in parallel in a circuit diagram. The defining characteristic of
parallel-connected elements is that they have the same voltage across their
terminals. In Fig. 3.6, you can see that R1 and R3 are not parallel connected
because, between their respective terminals, another resistor dissipates some
of the voltage.
Figure 3.5 Resistors in parallel.
Figure 3.5 Full Alternative Text

Figure 3.6 Full Alternative Text
We can reduce resistors in parallel to a single equivalent resistor using
Kirchhoff’s current law and Ohm’s law. In Fig. 3.5, we let the currents
i1, i2, i3, and i4 be the currents in the resistors R1 through R4, respectively.
Note that the positive reference direction for each resistor current is through
the resistor from node a to node b. From Kirchhoff’s current law,
is=i1+i2+i3+i4.
The parallel connection of the resistors means that the voltage across each
resistor must be the same. Hence, from Ohm’s law,
i1R1=i2R2=i3R3=i4R4=vs.
Therefore,
i1=vsR1,i2=vsR2,i3=vsR3,andi4=vsR4.
Substituting the expressions for the four branch currents into the KCL
equation and simplifying yields
is=vs (1R1+1R2+1R3+1R4),
from which
isvs=1Req=1R1+1R2+1R3+1R4.

This equation shows that the four resistors in Fig. 3.5 can be replaced by a
single equivalent resistor, thereby simplifying the circuit. The circuit in Fig.
3.7 illustrates the substitution. The equivalent resistance of k resistors
connected in parallel is

parallel resistors shown in Fig.
3.5 with a single equivalent

Combining Resistors in Parallel
1Req=∑i=1k 1Ri=1R1+1R2+ ⋯ + 1Rk.(3.2)

Note that the resistance of the equivalent resistor is always smaller than the
resistance of the smallest resistor in the parallel connection. Using
conductance when dealing with resistors connected in parallel is sometimes
more convenient. In that case, Eq. 3.2 becomes
Geq=∑i=1k Gi=G1+G2+ ⋯ + Gk.
Many times only two resistors are connected in parallel. Figure 3.8 illustrates
this special case. We calculate the equivalent resistance from Eq. 3.2:

1Req=1R1+1R2=R2+R1R1R2,
or
Combining Two Resistors in

Parallel

Thus, for just two resistors in parallel, the equivalent resistance equals the
product of the resistances divided by the sum of the resistances. Remember
that you can only use this result in the special case of just two resistors in
parallel.
Work through Examples 3.1 and 3.2 to practice using series and parallel
simplifications in circuit analysis.

2. Use your results in part (a) to find the power delivered by the current

Solution
1. Our goal is a circuit with the 50 mA current source and a single resistor.
We start simplifying the circuit’s right-hand side, moving left toward the
current source. The 2 kΩ and 3 kΩ resistors are in series and can be
replaced by a single resistor whose value is
2000+3000=5000=5 kΩ.
Figure 3.10(a) shows this simplified circuit where the 20 kΩ and the
5 kΩ resistors are now in parallel. We replace these parallel-connected
resistors with a single equivalent resistor, calculating its value using the
“product over the sum” equation (Eq. 3.3):
Figure 3.10 Simplifying the
circuit in Fig. 3.9.


Figure 3.10 Full Alternative Text
(20,000)(5000)20,000+5000=4000=4 kΩ.
Figure 3.10(b) shows this result, and now we see the two 4 kΩ resistors
are in series. They can be replaced with a single resistor whose value is
4000+4000=8000=8 kΩ.
Figure 3.10(c) shows this simplification. Now the 24 kΩ, 6 kΩ, and
8 kΩ resistors are in parallel. To find their equivalent, we add their
inverses and invert the result (Eq. 3.2):
(124,000+16000+18000)−1=(124,000+424,000+324,000)−1
=(824,000)−1=24,0008=3000=3 kΩ.
The equivalent resistance seen by the current source is 3 kΩ, as shown
in Fig. 3.10(d).
2. The power of the source and the power of the equivalent 3 kΩ resistor
must sum to zero. Using Fig. 3.10(d), we can easily calculate the
resistor’s power using its current and resistance to give
p=(0.05)2(3000)=7.5 W.
The equivalent resistor is absorbing 7.5 W, so the current source must be

delivering 7.5 W.

Solution
Using series-parallel simplifications, we reduce the resistors to the right of
the x-y terminals to a single equivalent resistor. On the circuit’s right-hand

side, the 3 Ω and 6 Ω resistors are in series. We replace this series
combination with a 9 Ω resistor, reducing the circuit to the one shown in Fig.
3.12(a). Then we replace the parallel combination of the 9 Ω and 18 Ω
resistors with a single equivalent resistance of (18×9)/(18 +9), or 6 Ω. Figure

should help you trace through the circuit simplification.

v1=(12)(6)=72 V.
Since v1 is the voltage drop from node x to node y, we can return to the
circuit shown in Fig. 3.12(a) and again use Ohm’s law to calculate i1 and i2.
Thus,
i1=v118=7218=4 A,
i2=v19=729=8 A.
We have found the three specified currents by using series-parallel reductions
in combination with Ohm’s law.
Before leaving Example 3.2, you should verify that the solution satisfies
Kirchhoff’s current law at every node and Kirchhoff’s voltage law around
every closed path. (There are three closed paths that can be tested.) You can
also show that the power delivered by the voltage source equals the total
power dissipated in the resistors, and thus the power in the circuit balances.

The Voltage-Divider Circuit
A voltage-divider circuit produces two or more smaller voltages from a
single voltage supply. This is especially useful in electronic circuits, where a
single circuit may require voltages of + 15 V, −15 V, and +5 V. An example
of a voltage-divider circuit that creates two voltages is shown in Fig 3.14. We
introduce the current i, as shown in Fig. 3.14(b), and recognize (from
Kirchhoff’s current law) that R1 and R2 carry this current. Using Ohm’s law
to determine the resistor voltages from the current i and applying Kirchhoff’s
voltage law around the closed loop yields

Using Ohm’s law and the expression for i, we calculate v1 and v2:

v1=iR1=vsR1R1+R2,(3.4)
v2=iR2=vsR2R1+R2.(3.5)
Equations 3.4 and 3.5 show that v1 and v2 are fractions of vs. Expressed in
words, each fraction is
the resistance across which the divided voltage is definedthe sum of the two re
Because this ratio is always less than 1.0, the divided voltages v1 and v2 are
always less than the source voltage vs.
Work through Example 3.3 to design a simple voltage divider.
Example 3.3 Designing a Simple
Voltage Divider
The voltage divider in Fig. 3.14 has a source voltage of 20 V. Determine the
values of the resistors R1 and R2 to give v1=15 V and v2=5 V.
Solution
From Eqs. 3.4 and 3.5,
15=R1R1+R2(20)and5=R2R1+R2(20).
Unfortunately, these two equations are not independent. If you solve each
equation for R1, you get R1=3R2. An infinite number of combinations of R1
and R2 yield the correct values for y1 and y2. For example, if you choose
R2=10 kΩ, then R1=30 kΩ gives the correct voltages, but if you choose
R2=400 Ω, then R1=1200 Ω gives the correct voltages.
When selecting values for R1 and R2, you should consider the power the
resistors must dissipate and the effects of connecting the voltage-divider
circuit to other circuit components. Example 3.4 uses the voltage divider

designed in Example 3.3 to supply 5 V to a 10 kΩ resistor.
Example 3.4 Adding a Resistive
Load to a Voltage Divider
1. For the voltage divider designed in Example 3.3, suppose resistors
R2=10 kΩ and R1=30 kΩ. Connect a resistor RL=10 kΩ in parallel with
R2 and determine the voltage across RL.
2. Repeat part (a) using resistors R2=400 Ω and R1=1200 Ω, but the same
value of RL.
Solution
1. The voltage divider with the resistor RL is shown in Fig. 3.15. The
resistor RL acts as a load on the voltage-divider circuit. A load on any
circuit consists of one or more circuit elements that draw power from the
circuit. The parallel combination of the two 10 kΩ resistors, one from
the voltage divider and the other the load resistor RL, gives an
equivalent resistance of 5 kΩ. Therefore, from Eq. 3.5,
Figure 3.15 The voltage
divider from Example 3.3
with a resistive load.

Figure 3.15 Full Alternative Text
vo=500030,000+5000(20)=2.86 V.
This is certainly not the 5 V we were expecting the voltage divider to
deliver to the load, because adding the load resistor changed the voltage-
divider circuit.
2. The voltage divider with a different set of resistors and the same load
resistor is shown in Fig. 3.16. Again, we expect the load resistor to
change the voltage-divider circuit. The parallel combination of the
400 Ω and 10 kΩ resistors gives an equivalent resistance of 384.615 Ω.
Therefore, from Eq. 3.5,
Figure 3.16 The voltage
divider from Example 3.3

with a different choice of R1
and R2 resistors and a
resistive load.
Figure 3.16 Full Alternative Text
vo=384.6151200+384.615(20)=4.85 V.
This is much closer to the 5 V we expected the voltage divider to deliver
to the load. The effect of the load resistor is minimal because the load
resistor value is much larger than the value of R2 in the voltage divider.
Figure 3.17 shows a general voltage divider with a load RL connected. The
expression for the output voltage is

Figure 3.17 A voltage divider
connected to a load RL.
Figure 3.17 Full Alternative Text
vo=ReqR1+Reqvs,
where
Req=R2RLR2+RL.
Substituting the expression for Req into the equation for vo and simplifying
yields
vo=R2R1[1+(R2/RL)]+R2vs.(3.6)
Note that Eq. 3.6 reduces to Eq. 3.5 as RL→ ∞, as it should. Equation 3.6

shows that, as long as RL≫R2, the voltage ratio vo/vs is essentially
undisturbed by adding a load to the divider, as we saw in Example 3.4.
Another characteristic of the voltage-divider circuit is its sensitivity to the
tolerances of the resistors. By tolerance we mean a range of possible values.
The resistances of commercially available resistors always vary within some
percentage of their stated value. Example 3.5 illustrates the effect of resistor
tolerances in a voltage-divider circuit.
Example 3.5 The Effect of Resistor
Tolerance on the Voltage-Divider
Circuit
The resistors used in the voltage-divider circuit shown in Fig. 3.18 have a
tolerance of ±10%. Find the maximum and minimum value of vo.
Figure 3.18 The circuit for
Example 3.5.

Figure 3.18 Full Alternative Text
Solution
From Eq. 3.5, the maximum value of vo occurs when R2=110 kΩ (10% high)
and R1=22.5 kΩ (10% low), and the minimum value of vo occurs when
R2=90 kΩ (10% low) and R1=27.5 kΩ (10% high). Therefore
vo(max)=110 k110 k+22.5 k(100)=83.02 V
and
vo(min)=90 k90 k+27.5 k(100)=76.60 V.
If we choose 10% resistors for this voltage divider, the no-load output voltage
will lie between 76.60 and 83.02 V.
The Current-Divider Circuit

The current-divider circuit shown in Fig. 3.19 consists of two resistors
connected in parallel across a current source. It divides the current is between
R1 and R2. What is the relationship between the current is and the current in
each resistor (i1 and i2)? The voltage across the parallel resistors can be
expressed in three ways: as the product of the R1 resistor and its current i1, as
the product of the R2 resistor and its current i2, and as the product of the
equivalent resistance seen by the source and the source current. These three
expressions for the voltage are given as
Figure 3.19 The current-
divider circuit.
Figure 3.19 Full Alternative Text
v=i1R1=i2R2=R1R2R1+R2is.
Therefore,
i1=R2R1+R2is,(3.7)
i2=R1R1+R2is.(3.8)
Equations 3.7 and 3.8 show that when the current divides between two
resistors in parallel, the current in one resistor equals the current entering the
parallel pair multiplied by the other resistance and divided by the sum of the
resistors. See how to design a current divider by working through Example

3.6.
Example 3.6 Designing a Current-
Divider Circuit
Suppose the current source for the current divider shown in Fig. 3.19 is 100
mA. Assuming you have 0.25 W resistors available, what is the largest R2
resistor you can use to get i2=50 mA?
Solution
While you can use Eq. 3.8 to find the ratio of resistors, it should be clear that
if the current in one resistor is 50 mA, the current in the other resistor must
also be 50 mA, so both resistors must have the same value. Therefore, there
are an infinite number of different resistor values which, when used for R1
and R2 will give i2=50 mA. If the resistors have the same value and the same
current, they absorb the same amount of power, which cannot exceed 0.25 W.
From the power equation for resistors,
p=i2R=(0.05)2R=0.25
so
R=0.25(0.05)2=100  Ω.
The largest 0.25 W resistors that can be used to create a current i2=50 mA are
100 Ω resistors.

3.4 Voltage Division and Current
Division
We now introduce two additional and very useful circuit analysis techniques
known as voltage division and current division. These techniques
generalize the results from analyzing the voltage-divider circuit in Fig. 3.14
and the current-divider circuit in Fig. 3.19. We begin with voltage division.
Voltage Division
Consider the circuit shown in Fig. 3.20, where the box on the left contains a
single voltage source or any other combination of basic circuit elements that
results in the voltage v shown in the figure. To the right of the box are n
resistors connected in series. We are interested in finding the voltage drop vj
across an arbitrary resistor Rj in terms of the voltage v. We start by using
Ohm’s law to calculate i, the current through all of the resistors in series, in
terms of the current v and the n resistors:
Figure 3.20 Circuit used to
illustrate voltage division.

Figure 3.20 Full Alternative Text
i=vR1+R2+⋯+Rn=vReq.
The equivalent resistance, Req, is the sum of the n resistor values because the
resistors are in series, as shown in Eq. 3.1. We apply Ohm’s law a second
time to calculate the voltage drop vj across the resistor Rj, substituting v/Req
for i:
Voltage Division Equation
vj=iRj=RjReqv.(3.9)
Equation 3.9 is the voltage division equation. It says that the voltage drop vj
across a single resistor Rj from a collection of series-connected resistors is
proportional to the total voltage drop v across the set of series-connected
resistors. The constant of proportionality is the ratio of the single resistance to
the equivalent resistance of the series-connected set of resistors, or Rj/Req.

Current Division
Now consider the circuit shown in Fig. 3.21, where the box on the left
contains a single current source or any other combination of basic circuit
elements that results in the current i shown in the figure. To the right of the
box are n resistors connected in parallel. We are interested in finding the
current ij through an arbitrary resistor Rj in terms of the current i. We start by
using Ohm’s law to calculate v, the voltage drop across each of the resistors
in parallel, in terms of the current i and the n resistors:
Figure 3.21 Circuit used to
illustrate current division.
Figure 3.21 Full Alternative Text
v=i(R1 || R2||⋯||Rn)=iReq.
The equivalent resistance of n resistors in parallel, Req, can be calculated

using Eq. 3.2. We apply Ohm’s law a second time to calculate the current ij
through the resistor Rj, replacing v with iReq:
Current Division Equation
ij=vRj=ReqRji.(3.10)
Equation 3.10 is the current division equation. It says that the current ij
through a single resistor Rj from a collection of parallel-connected resistors is
proportional to the total current i supplied to the set of parallel-connected
resistors. The constant of proportionality is the ratio of the equivalent
resistance of the parallel-connected set of resistors to the single resistance, or
Req/Rj. Note that the constant of proportionality in the current division
equation is the inverse of the constant of proportionality in the voltage
division equation!
Example 3.7 uses voltage division and current division to solve for voltages
and currents in a circuit.
Example 3.7 Using Voltage Division
and Current Division to Solve a
Circuit
Use current division to find the current io and use voltage division to find the
voltage vo for the circuit in Fig. 3.22.
Figure 3.22 The circuit for
Example 3.7.

Figure 3.22 Full Alternative Text
Solution
We can use Eq. 3.10 if we can find the equivalent resistance of the four
parallel branches containing resistors. Using “+” to represent series-
connected resistors and “||” to represent parallel-connected resistors, the
equivalent resistance is
Req=(36+44)|| 10 ||(40+10+30) || 24
=80 || 10 || 80 || 24=1180+110+180+124=6 Ω.
Applying Eq. 3.10,
io=624(8 A)=2 A.
We can use Ohm’s law to find the voltage drop across the 24 Ω resistor:
v=(24)(2)=48 V.
This is also the voltage drop across the branch containing the 40 Ω, the 10 Ω,
and the 30 Ω resistors in series. Use voltage division to determine the voltage

drop vo across the 30 Ω resistor from the voltage drop across the series-
connected resistors, using Eq. 3.9. The equivalent resistance of the series-
connected resistors is 40+10+30=80 Ω, so
vo=3080(48 V)=18 V.

3.5 Measuring Voltage and Current
Working with actual circuits often requires making voltage and current
measurements. The next two sections explore several common devices used
to make these measurements. The devices are relatively simple to analyze and
offer practical examples of the current- and voltage-divider configurations.
We begin by looking at ammeters and voltmeters.
An ammeter is an instrument designed to measure current; it is placed
in series with the circuit element whose current is being measured.
A voltmeter is an instrument designed to measure voltage; it is placed
in parallel with the element whose voltage is being measured.
Ideal ammeters and voltmeters have no effect on the circuit variable they are
designed to measure. That is, an ideal ammeter has an equivalent resistance
of 0 Ω and functions as a short circuit in series with the element whose
current is being measured. An ideal voltmeter has an infinite equivalent
resistance and functions as an open circuit in parallel with the element whose
voltage is being measured. Figure 3.23 measures the current in R1 using an
ammeter and measures the voltage across R2 using a voltmeter. The ideal
models for these meters in the same circuit are shown in Fig. 3.24.

current in R1, and a voltmeter

voltage across R2.

Figure 3.24 Full Alternative Text
There are two broad categories of meters used to measure continuous
voltages and currents: analog meters and digital meters.
Analog Meters
Analog meters are based on the d’Arsonval meter movement, which includes
a dial readout pointer as shown in Fig. 3.25. The d’Arsonval meter movement
consists of a movable coil placed in the field of a permanent magnet. When
current flows in the coil, it creates a torque on the coil, causing it to rotate and
move a pointer across a calibrated scale. By design, the deflection of the
pointer is directly proportional to the current in the movable coil. The coil is
characterized by both a voltage rating and a current rating. For example, one
commercially available meter movement is rated at 50 mV and 1 mA. This
means that when the coil is carrying 1 mA, the voltage drop across the coil is
50 mV and the pointer is deflected to its full-scale position.
Figure 3.25 A schematic

diagram of a d’Arsonval meter
movement.
Figure 3.25 Full Alternative Text
An analog ammeter consists of a d’Arsonval movement in parallel with a
resistor, as shown in Fig. 3.26. The parallel resistor limits the amount of

current in the movement’s coil by shunting some of it through RA. In
contrast, an analog voltmeter consists of a d’Arsonval movement in series
with a resistor, as shown in Fig. 3.27. Here, the resistor limits the voltage
drop across the meter’s coil. In both meters, the added resistor determines the
full-scale reading of the meter movement.
Figure 3.26 An analog ammeter
circuit.
Figure 3.26 Full Alternative Text
Figure 3.27 An analog
voltmeter circuit.

A diagram shows an analog voltmeter circuit.
Figure 3.27 Full Alternative Text
From these descriptions we see that an analog meter is nonideal; both the
added resistor and the meter movement introduce resistance in the circuit
where the meter is attached. In fact, any instrument used to make physical
measurements extracts energy from the system while making measurements.
The more energy extracted by the instruments, the more severely the
measurement is disturbed. The equivalent resistance of a real ammeter is not
zero, so it adds resistance to the circuit in series with the element whose
current is being read. The equivalent resistance of a real voltmeter is not
infinite, so it adds resistance to the circuit in parallel with the element whose
voltage is being read.
How much these meters disturb the circuit being measured depends on the
effective resistance of the meters compared with the resistance in the circuit.
For example, using the rule of 1/10th, the effective resistance of an ammeter
should be no more than 1/10th of the value of the smallest resistance in the
circuit to be sure that the current being measured is nearly the same with or
without the ammeter. But in an analog meter, the value of resistance is
determined by the desired full-scale reading we wish to make, and it cannot
be arbitrarily selected. Examples 3.8 and 3.9 illustrate how to calculate the
resistance needed in an analog ammeter or voltmeter. The examples also
determine the effective resistance of the meter when it is inserted in a circuit.

Example 3.8 Using a d’Arsonval
Ammeter
1. A 50 mV, 1 mA d’Arsonval movement is to be used in an ammeter with
a full-scale reading of 10 mA. Determine RA.
2. Repeat (a) for a full-scale reading of 1 A.
3. How much resistance is added to the circuit when the 10 mA ammeter is
inserted to measure current?
4. Repeat (c) for the 1 A ammeter.
Solution
1. Look at the analog ammeter circuit in Fig. 3.26. The current in the
ammeter must divide between the branch with the resistor RA and the
branch with the meter movement. From the problem statement we know
that when the current in the ammeter is 10 mA, 1 mA is flowing through
the meter coil, which means that 9 mA must be diverted through RA.
We also know that when the movement carries 1 mA, the voltage across
its terminals is 50 mV, which is also the voltage across RA. Using
Ohm’s law,
9×10−3RA=50×10−3,
or
RA=50/9=5.555 Ω.
2. When the full-scale deflection of the ammeter is 1 A, RA must carry 999
mA when the movement carries 1 mA. In this case,
999×10−3RA=50×10−3,

or
RA=50/999≈50.05 mΩ.
3. Let Rm represent the equivalent resistance of the ammeter. When the
ammeter current is 10 mA, its voltage drop is 50 mV, so from
Ohm’s law,
Rm=0.050.01=5 Ω.
Alternatively, the resistance of the ammeter is the equivalent resistance
of the meter movement in parallel with RA. The resistance of the meter
movement is the ratio of its voltage to its current, or 0.05/0.001=50 Ω.
Therefore,
Rm=50||(50/9)=(50)(50/9)50+(50/9)=5 Ω.
4. For the 1 A ammeter
Rm=0.051=0.05 Ω,
or, alternatively,
Rm=50||(50/999)=(50)(50/999)50+(50/999)=0.05 Ω.
Example 3.9 Using a d’Arsonval
Voltmeter
1. A 50 mV, 1 mA d’Arsonval movement is to be used in a voltmeter in
which the full-scale reading is 150 V. Determine Rv.
2. Repeat (a) for a full-scale reading of 5 V.
3. How much resistance does the 150 V meter insert into the circuit?
4. Repeat (c) for the 5 V meter.

Solution
1. Look at the analog voltmeter circuit in Fig. 3.27. The voltage across the
voltmeter must divide between the resistor Rv and the meter movement.
From the problem statement we know that when the voltage across the
voltmeter is 150 V, the voltage across the meter coil must be 50 mV.
The remaining 149.95 V must be the voltage across Rv. We also know
that when the movement’s voltage drop is 50 mV, its current is 1 mA,
which is also the current in Rv. Using Ohm’s law,
Rv=149.950.001=149,950  Ω.
2. For a full-scale reading of 5 V, the voltage across Rv is 4.95 V and the
current in Rv is still 1 mA, so from Ohm’s law,
Rv=4.950.001=4950  Ω.
3. Let Rm represent the equivalent resistance of the voltmeter. When the
voltage across the voltmeter is 150 V, its current is 1 mA, so from
Ohm’s law,
Rm=15010−3=150,000 Ω.
Alternatively, the resistance of the voltmeter is the equivalent resistance
of Rv in series with the meter movement. The resistance of the meter
movement is the ratio of its voltage to its current, or
50 m V/1 mA=50 Ω. Therefore,
Rm=149,950+50=150,000 Ω.
4. For the 5 V voltmeter,
Rm=510−3=5000 Ω.
or, alternatively,
Rm=4950+50=5000 Ω.

Digital Meters
Digital meters measure the continuous voltage or current signal at discrete
points in time, called the sampling times. The signal is thus converted from
an analog signal, which is continuous in time, to a digital signal, which exists
only at discrete instants in time. A more detailed explanation of the workings
of digital meters is beyond the scope of this text and course. However, you
are likely to see and use digital meters in lab settings because they offer
several advantages over analog meters. They introduce less resistance into the
circuit to which they are connected (though they are still nonideal), are easier
to connect, and take more precise measurements owing to the nature of their
readout mechanism.

3.6 Measuring Resistance—The
Wheatstone Bridge
While many different circuit configurations are used to measure resistance,
here we will focus on just one, the Wheatstone bridge. The Wheatstone
bridge circuit is used to precisely measure resistances of medium values, that
is, in the range of 1 Ω to 1 MΩ. In commercial models of the Wheatstone
bridge, accuracies on the order of ±0.1% are possible. The bridge circuit,
shown in Fig. 3.28, consists of four resistors, a dc voltage source, and a
detector. The resistance of one of the four resistors can be varied, which is
indicated by the arrow through R3. The dc voltage source is usually a battery,
which is indicated by the battery symbol for the voltage source v in Fig. 3.28.
The detector is generally a d’Arsonval movement in the microamp range and
is called a galvanometer. In Fig. 3.28, R1, R2, and R3 are known resistors
and Rx is the unknown resistor.
Figure 3.28 The Wheatstone
bridge circuit.

Figure 3.28 Full Alternative Text
To find the value of Rx, we adjust the variable resistor R3 until there is no
current in the galvanometer. We then calculate the unknown resistor from the
simple expression
Rx=R2R1R3.(3.11)
We derive Eq. 3.11 by applying Kirchhoff’s laws to the bridge circuit. We
redraw the bridge circuit as Fig. 3.29 to show the branch currents in the
bridge. When ig is zero, we say the bridge is balanced. At node a,
Kirchhoff’s current law requires that
Figure 3.29 A balanced
Wheatstone bridge (ig=0).

Figure 3.29 Full Alternative Text
i1=i3,
while at node b, Kirchhoff’s current law requires that
i2=ix.
Now, because ig is zero, the voltage drop across the detector is also zero, so
nodes a and b are at the same potential. Thus, when the bridge is balanced,
Kirchhoff’s voltage law for the clockwise path containing the galvanometer
and resistors R3 and Rx gives
0+Rxix−R3i3=0
so
i3R3=ixRx.

Using Kirchhoff’s voltage law for the path containing the galvanometer and
resistors R1 and R2 gives
i1R1=i2R2.
Divide the first KVL equation by the second KVL equation to give
i3R3i1R1=ixRxi2R2,
Eliminate the currents (because i1 = i3 and i2 = ix) and solve for Rx to get
Eq. 3.11.
Now that we have verified the validity of Eq. 3.11, some comments about the
result are in order. First, note that if R2/R1=1, the unknown resistor Rx
equals R3, so R3 must vary over a range that includes the value Rx. For
example, if the unknown resistance were 1000 Ω and R3 could be varied
from 0 to 100 Ω, the bridge could never be balanced. Thus, to cover a wide
range of unknown resistors, we must be able to vary the ratio R2/R1. In a
commercial Wheatstone bridge, R1 and R2 consist of decimal values of
resistances that can be switched into the bridge circuit. Normally, the decimal
values are 1, 10, 100, and 1000 Ω, so that the ratio R2/R1 can be varied from
0.001 to 1000 in decimal steps. The variable resistor R3 is usually adjustable
in integral values of resistance from 1 to 11,000 Ω.
Second, although Eq. 3.11 implies that Rx can vary from zero to infinity, the
practical range of Rx is approximately 1 Ω to 1 MΩ. Resistances smaller than
1 Ω are difficult to measure on a standard Wheatstone bridge because of
thermoelectric voltages generated at the junctions of dissimilar metals and
because of thermal heating effects—that is, i2R effects. Resistances larger
than 1 MΩ are difficult to measure accurately because of leakage currents. In
other words, if Rx is large, the current leakage in the electrical insulation may
be comparable to the current in the branches of the bridge circuit.
Example 3.10 uses a Wheatstone bridge to measure a range of unknown
resistors.
Example 3.10 Using a Wheatstone

Bridge to Measure Resistance
For the Wheatstone bridge in Fig. 3.30, R3 can be varied from 10 Ω to 2 kΩ.
What range of resistor values can this bridge measure?
Figure 3.30 The circuit for
Example 3.10.
Figure 3.30 Full Alternative Text
Solution

When R3=10 Ω, the bridge is balanced when
Rx=40001000(10)=40 Ω.
When R3=2 kΩ, the bridge is balanced when
Rx=40001000(2000)=8 kΩ.
Therefore, the range of resistor values the bridge can measure is 40 Ω to
8 kΩ.

3.7 Delta-to-Wye (Pi-to-Tee)
Equivalent Circuits
Look again at the Wheatstone bridge in Fig. 3.28; if we replace the
galvanometer with its equivalent resistance Rm, we get the circuit shown in
Fig. 3.31 (p. 76). Because this circuit does not have any series-connected or
parallel-connected resistors, we cannot simplify it using the simple series or
parallel equivalent circuits introduced earlier in this chapter. But the five
interconnected resistors can be reduced to a single equivalent resistor using a
delta-to-wye (Δ-to-Y) or pi-to-tee (π-to-T) equivalent circuit.1
1 Δ and Y structures are present in a variety of useful circuits, not just
resistive networks. Hence, the Δ-to-Y transformation is a helpful tool in
circuit analysis.

The resistors R1, R2, and Rm (or R3, Rm and Rx) in the circuit shown in Fig.
3.31 form a delta (Δ) interconnection because the interconnection looks like
the Greek letter Δ. It is also called a pi interconnection because the Δ can be
reshaped like the Greek letter π without disturbing the electrical equivalence
of the two configurations, as shown in Fig. 3.32.

The resistors R1, Rm, and R3 (or R2, Rm and Rx) in the circuit shown in Fig.
3.31 form a wye (Y) interconnection because the interconnection can be
shaped to look like the letter Y. It is easier to see the Y shape of the
interconnection in Fig. 3.33. The Y configuration is also called a tee (T)
interconnection because the Y structure can be reshaped into a T structure
without disturbing the electrical equivalence of the two structures, as shown
in Fig. 3.33.

Figure 3.34 illustrates the Δ-to-Y (or π-to-T) equivalent circuit
transformation. But we cannot transform the Δ interconnection into the Y
interconnection simply by changing the shape of the interconnections. Saying
the Δ-connected circuit is equivalent to the Y-connected circuit means that
the Δ configuration can be replaced with a Y configuration without changing
the terminal behavior. Thus, if each circuit is placed in a black box, we can’t
tell whether the box contains a set of Δ-connected resistors or a set of Y-
connected resistors by making external measurements. This condition is true
only if the resistance between corresponding terminal pairs is the same for
each box. For example, the resistance between terminals a and b must be the
same whether we use the Δ-connected set or the Y-connected set. For each
pair of terminals in the Δ-connected circuit, compute the equivalent
resistance using series and parallel simplifications. For each pair of terminals
in the Y-connected circuit, compute the equivalent resistance using only
series simplification. The three equivalent resistance equations are

Straightforward algebraic manipulation of Eqs. 3.12–3.14 gives values for the
Y-connected resistors in terms of the Δ-connected resistors. Use these
equations when transforming three Δ-connected resistors into an equivalent Y
connection:
R1=Rb RcRa+Rb+Rc,(3.15)
R2=RcRaRa+Rb+Rc,(3.16)
R3=RaRbRa+Rb+Rc.(3.17)
Reversing the Δ-to-Y transformation also is possible, so we can start with a Y
structure and replace it with an equivalent Δ structure. The expressions for
the three Δ-connected resistors as functions of the three Y-connected resistors
are
Ra=R1R2+R2R3+R3R1R1,(3.18)
Rb=R1R2+R2R3+R3R1R2,(3.19)

Solution
This problem is easy to solve if we can find the equivalent resistance seen by
the source. Begin this simplification by replacing either the upper Δ (100,
125, 25 Ω) or the lower Δ (40, 25, 37.5 Ω) with its equivalent Y. We choose
to replace the upper Δ by computing the three Y resistances, defined in
Fig. 3.36, using Eqs. 3.15 to 3.17. Thus,

R1=100×125250=50 Ω,

Substituting the Y resistors into the circuit shown in Fig. 3.35 produces the
circuit shown in Fig. 3.37. From Fig. 3.37 we can easily calculate the
resistance seen by the 40 V source using series-parallel simplifications:

Fig. 3.38, so the 40 V source delivers current i=40/80=0.5 A and power
p=40(0.5)=20 W is delivered to the circuit.

Practical Perspective
Resistive Touch Screens
Let’s analyze the resistive grid in the x-direction. We model the resistance of
the grid in the x-direction with the resistance Rx, as shown in Fig. 3.39. The
x-location where the screen is touched is indicated by the arrow. Touching
the screen effectively divides the total resistance, Rx, into two separate
resistances α Rx and (1−α)Rx. The resulting voltage drop across the
resistance α Rx is Vx.
Figure 3.39 The resistive touch

screen grid in the x-direction.
Figure 3.39 Full Alternative Text
From the figure you can see that when the touch is on the far right side of the
screen, α=0 and Vx=0. Similarly, when the touch is on the far left side of the
screen, α=1 and Vx=Vs. If the touch is inbetween the two edges of the
screen, the value of α is between 0 and 1 and the two parts of the resistance
Rx form a voltage divider. We can calculate the voltage Vx using the
equation for voltage division:
Vx=αRxαRx+(1−α)RxVs=αRxRxVs=αVs.
We can find the value of α, which represents the location of the touch point
with respect to the far right side of the screen, by dividing the voltage across
the grid resistance starting at the touch point, Vx, by the voltage applied

across the entire resistive grid in the x-direction, Vs:
α=VxVs.
Now we want to use the value of α to determine the x-coordinate of the touch
location on the screen. Typically, the screen coordinates are specified in
terms of pixels (short for “picture elements”). For example, the screen of a
mobile phone is a grid of pixels, with px pixels in the x-direction and py
pixels in the y-direction. Each pixel is identified by its x-location (a number
between 0 and px−1) and its y-location (a number between 0 and py−1). The
pixel with the location (0, 0) is in the upper-left-hand corner of the screen, as
shown in Fig. 3.40.
Figure 3.40 The pixel
coordinates of a screen with px
pixels in the x-direction and py
pixels in the y-direction.

Figure 3.40 Full Alternative Text
Since α represents the location of the touch point with respect to the right side
of the screen, (1−α) represents the location of the touch point with respect to
the left side of the screen. Therefore, the x-coordinate of the pixel
corresponding to the touch point is
x=(1−α)px.
Note that the value of x is capped at (px−1).
Using the model of the resistive screen grid in the y-direction shown in Fig.
3.41, it is easy to show that the voltage created by a touch at the arrow is
given by

Figure 3.41 The resistive touch
screen grid in the y-direction.

Vy=βVs.
Therefore, the y-coordinate of the pixel corresponding to the touch point is
y=(1−β)py,
where the value of y is capped at (py−1). (See Problem 3.72.)

Summary
Series resistors can be combined to obtain a single equivalent resistance
according to the equation
Req=∑i=1kRi=R1+R2+ ⋯ + Rk.
(See page 60.)
Parallel resistors can be combined to obtain a single equivalent
resistance according to the equation
1Req=∑i=1k 1Ri=1R1+1R2+ ⋯ + 1Rk.
When just two resistors are in parallel, the equation for equivalent
resistance can be simplified to give
Req=R1R2R1+R2.
(See pages 61–62.)
When voltage is divided between series-connected resistors, as shown in
the figure, the voltage across each resistor can be found according to the
equations
v1=R1R1+R2vs,
v2=R2R1+R2vs.
(See page 64.)

Voltage division is a circuit analysis tool used to find the voltage drop
across a single resistance from a collection of series-connected
resistances when the voltage drop across the collection is known:
vj=RjReqv,
where vj is the voltage drop across the resistance Rj and v is the voltage
drop across the series-connected resistances whose equivalent resistance
is Req. (See page 68.)
Current division is a circuit analysis tool used to find the current
through a single resistance from a collection of parallel-connected
resistances when the current into the collection is known:
ij=ReqRji,
where ij is the current through the resistance Rj and i is the current into
the parallel-connected resistances whose equivalent resistance is Req.
(See page 69.)
A voltmeter measures voltage and must be placed in parallel with the

voltage being measured. An ideal voltmeter has infinite internal
resistance and thus does not alter the voltage being measured. (See page
70.)
An ammeter measures current and must be placed in series with the
current being measured. An ideal ammeter has zero internal resistance
and thus does not alter the current being measured. (See page 70.)
Digital meters and analog meters have internal resistance, which
influences the value of the circuit variable being measured. Meters based
on the d’Arsonval meter movement deliberately include internal
resistance as a way to limit the current in the movement’s coil. (See
pages 71–73.)
The Wheatstone bridge circuit is used to make precise measurements
of a resistor’s value using four resistors, a dc voltage source, and a
galvanometer. A Wheatstone bridge is balanced when the resistors obey
Eq. 3.11, resulting in a galvanometer reading of 0 A. (See pages 73–74.)
A circuit with three resistors connected in a Δ configuration (or a π
configuration) can be transformed into an equivalent circuit in which the
three resistors are Y connected (or T connected). The Δ-to-Y
transformation is given by Eqs. 3.15–3.17; the Y-to-Δ transformation is
given by Eqs. 3.18–3.20. (See pages 75–77.)

Chapter Objectives
1. Understand and be able to use the node-voltage method to solve a
circuit.
2. Understand and be able to use the mesh-current method to solve a
circuit.
3. Be able to decide whether the node-voltage method or the mesh-current
method is the preferred approach to solving a particular circuit.
4. Understand source transformation and be able to use it to solve a circuit.
5. Understand the concept of the Thévenin and Norton equivalent circuits
and be able to construct a Thévenin or Norton equivalent for a circuit.
6. Know the condition for maximum power transfer to a resistive load and
be able to calculate the value of the load resistor that satisfies this
condition.
This chapter introduces two powerful circuit analysis techniques: the node-
voltage method and the mesh-current method. The power of these methods
comes from their ability to describe complex circuits using a minimum
number of simultaneous equations. The alternative—applying Kirchhoff’s
laws and Ohm’s law—becomes cumbersome for complex circuits.
We also introduce new techniques for simplifying circuits: source
transformations and Thévenin and Norton equivalent circuits. Adding these
skills to your existing knowledge of series-parallel reductions and Δ-to-Y
transformations greatly expands your ability to simplify and solve complex
circuits.
Finally, we explore the concepts of maximum power transfer and
superposition. You will learn to use Thévenin equivalent circuits to establish
the conditions needed to ensure maximum power is delivered to a resistive
load. Superposition helps us analyze circuits that have more than one

independent source.
Practical Perspective
Circuits with Realistic Resistors
In the last chapter, we examined the effect of imprecise resistor values on the
performance of a voltage divider. Resistors are manufactured for only a small
number of discrete values, and any given resistor from a batch of resistors
will vary from its stated value within some tolerance. Resistors with a
tolerance of 1% are more expensive than resistors with a tolerance of 10%. If
we know that a particular resistor must be very close to its stated value for the
circuit to function correctly, we can then decide to spend the extra money
necessary to achieve a tighter tolerance on that resistor’s value.
Therefore, we want to predict the effect of varying the value of each resistor
in a circuit on the output of that circuit, a technique known as sensitivity
analysis. Once we have presented additional circuit analysis methods, the
topic of sensitivity analysis will be examined.

4.1 Terminology
Before discussing the node-voltage and mesh-current methods of circuit
analysis, we must define a few basic terms. So far, all the circuits presented
have been planar circuits—that is, those circuits that can be drawn on a
plane with no crossing branches. A circuit that is drawn with crossing
branches still is considered planar if it can be redrawn with no crossing
branches. For example, the circuit shown in Fig. 4.1(a) can be redrawn as
Fig. 4.1(b); the circuits are equivalent because all the node connections have
been maintained. Therefore, Fig. 4.1(a) is a planar circuit because it can be
redrawn as one. Figure 4.2 shows a nonplanar circuit—it cannot be redrawn
in such a way that all the node connections are maintained and no branches
overlap. Identifying a circuit as planar or nonplanar is important, because

verify that it is planar.

the node-voltage method is applicable to both planar and nonplanar
circuits;
the mesh-current method is limited to planar circuits.
Describing a Circuit—The
Vocabulary
When ideal basic circuit elements (Section 1.5) are interconnected to form a
circuit, the resulting interconnection is described in terms of nodes, paths,
loops, branches, and meshes. Two of these terms, nodes and loops, were
defined in Section 2.4. Now we’ll define the rest of these terms. For your
convenience, all of these definitions are presented in Table 4.1. The table also
includes examples of each definition taken from the circuit in Fig. 4.3, which
are developed in Example 4.1.

2. The essential nodes are b, c, e, and g.
3. The branches are v1, v2, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, and I.
4. The essential branches are v1−R1, R2−R3, v2−R4, R5, R6, R7, and I.
5. The meshes are v1−R1−R5−R3−R2, v2−R2−R3−R6−R4,  R5−R7−R6,
and R7−I.
6. R1−R5−R6 is a path, but it is not a loop (because it does not have the
same starting and ending nodes), nor is it an essential branch (because it
does not connect two essential nodes). v2−R2 is also a path but is
neither a loop nor an essential branch, for the same reasons.
7. v1−R1−R5−R6−R4−v2 is a loop but is not a mesh because there are two
loops within it. I−R5−R6 is also a loop but not a mesh.

Simultaneous Equations—How
Many?
Recall that we need b independent equations to solve a circuit with b
unknown currents. In Fig. 4.3, for example, the circuit has nine branches with
unknown currents, so b=9; we need nine independent equations to solve for
the unknown currents. Some of the equations can be written by applying
Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL) to a set of the circuit’s nodes. In fact, if the
circuit has n nodes, we can derive n−1 independent equations by applying
Kirchhoff’s current law to any set of n−1 nodes.1 To obtain the rest of the
needed b−(n−1) equations, we apply Kirchhoff’s voltage law (KVL) to circuit
loops or meshes.
1 Applying KCL to the last unused node (the nth node) does not generate an
independent equation. See Problem 4.4.
To reduce the number of independent equations needed, we can use essential
nodes and essential branches instead of nodes and branches. This is because
the number of essential nodes in a circuit is less than or equal to the number
of nodes, and the number of essential branches is less than or equal to the
number of branches. Thus, our systematic method for writing the necessary
equations to solve for the circuit’s unknown currents is as follows:
Count the number of essential nodes, ne.
Count the number of essential branches, be, where the current is
unknown.
Write ne−1 equations by applying KCL to any set of ne−1 nodes.
Write be−(ne−1) equations by applying KVL around a set of be−(ne−1)
loops or meshes.
Remember that the voltage for each component in every loop or mesh must
be known or must be described in terms of the component’s current using
Ohm’s law.

Let’s illustrate our systematic approach by applying it to the circuit from
Example 4.1, as seen in Example 4.2.
Example 4.2 Using Essential Nodes
and Essential Branches to Write
Simultaneous Equations
The circuit in Fig. 4.4 has six essential branches, denoted i1 − i6, where the
current is unknown. Use the systematic approach to write the six equations
needed to solve for the six unknown currents.
Figure 4.4 The circuit shown in
Fig. 4.3 with six unknown
branch currents defined.

Figure 4.4 Full Alternative Text
Solution
The essential nodes in the circuit are labeled b, c, e, and g, so ne=4. From the
problem statement we know that the number of essential branches where the
current is unknown is be=6. Note that there are seven essential branches in
the circuit, but the current in the essential branch containing the current
source is known. We need to write six independent equations because there
are six unknown currents.

We derive three of the six independent equations by applying Kirchhoff’s
current law to any three of the four essential nodes. We use the nodes b, c,
and e to get
−i1+i2+i6−I=0,i1−i3−i5=0,i3+i4−i2=0.
We derive the remaining three equations by applying Kirchhoff’s voltage law
around three meshes. Remember that the voltage across every component in
each mesh must be known or must be expressed as the product of the
component’s resistance and its current using Ohm’s law. Because the circuit
has four meshes, we need to dismiss one mesh. We eliminate the R7−I mesh
because we don’t know the voltage across I.2 Using the other three meshes
gives

4.2 Introduction to the Node-
Voltage Method
The node-voltage method generates independent simultaneous equations by
applying Kirchoff’s current law at the essential nodes of the circuit. Solving
the simultaneous equations yields the voltage drops between all but one of
the essential nodes and a reference essential node. You can use these voltages
to calculate voltages and currents for every component in the circuit, thereby
solving the circuit. We illustrate the step-by-step procedure using the circuit
in Fig. 4.5.
Figure 4.5 A circuit used to
illustrate the node-voltage
method of circuit analysis.
Figure 4.5 Full Alternative Text
Step 1 is to make a neat layout of the circuit so that no branches cross and to

mark the essential nodes on the circuit diagram, as in Fig. 4.6. This circuit
has three essential nodes (ne=3); therefore, we need two (ne−1) KCL
equations to describe the circuit.
Figure 4.6 The circuit shown in
Fig. 4.5 with a reference node
and the node voltages.
Figure 4.6 Full Alternative Text
Step 2 is to select one of the three essential nodes as a reference node.
Although in theory the choice is arbitrary, there is often an obvious and
practical choice. Choosing the reference node becomes easier with practice.
For example, the node with the most branches is usually a good choice, so we
select the lower node in Fig. 4.5 as the reference node. The reference node is
identified by the symbol ▼, as in Fig. 4.6. Complete this step by labeling the
remaining essential node voltages on the circuit diagram. A node voltage is
defined as the voltage rise from the reference node to a nonreference essential
node. For this circuit, we must define two node voltages, which are denoted

v1 and v2 in Fig. 4.6.
In Step 3 we generate the KCL equations. To do this, write the current
leaving each branch connected to a nonreference node as a function of the
node voltages and sum the currents to zero in accordance with Kirchhoff’s
current law. Let’s look at node 1. Ohm’s law tells us that the current leaving
node 1 through the 1 Ω resistor equals the voltage across the resistor (v1 –
10) divided by its resistance (1 Ω). That is, the current equals (v1−10)/1 .
Figure 4.7 depicts these observations. Repeating this reasoning, the current
leaving node 1 through the 5 Ω resistor is v1/5, and the current leaving node
1 through the 2 Ω resistor is (v1−v2)/2. Because the sum of the three currents
leaving node 1 must equal zero, we can write the KCL equation at node 1 as
Figure 4.7 Computation of the
branch current i.
Figure 4.7 Full Alternative Text
v1−101+v15+v1−v22=0. (4.1)

Repeating the process for node 2 gives
v2−v12+v210−2=0. (4.2)
Note that the first term in Eq. 4.2 is the current leaving node 2 through the
2 Ω resistor, the second term is the current leaving node 2 through the 10 Ω
resistor, and the third term is the current leaving node 2 through the current
source.
In Step 4, solve the simultaneous equations (see Appendix A). Equations 4.1
and 4.2 are the two simultaneous equations that describe the circuit in terms
of the node voltages v1 and v2. Solving for v1 and v2 yields
v1=10011=9.09 V,v2=12011=10.91 V.
Step 5 uses the node voltages to solve for the remaining unknowns in the
circuit. Once the node voltages are known, all branch currents can be
calculated. Once these are known, the component voltages and powers can be
calculated.
A condensed version of the node-voltage method is shown in Analysis

Solution

1. We begin by noting that the circuit has two essential nodes; thus, we
need to write a single KCL equation. Step 1: Identify the two essential
nodes. Step 2: Select the lower node as the reference node and define
the unknown node voltage as v1. Figure 4.9 illustrates these decisions.
Step 3: Write a KCL equation at the nonreference essential node by
summing the currents leaving node 1:

Step 4: Solve the equation for v1, giving
v1=40 V.

Step 5: Use the node voltage v1 and Ohm’s law to find the requested
branch currents:
ia=50−v15=50−405=2 A,ib=v110=4010=4 A,ic=v140=4040=1 A.
2. The power associated with the 50 V source is
p50V=−50ia=−100 W (delivering).
The power associated with the 3 A source is
p3A=−3v1=−3(40)=−120 W (delivering).
We check these calculations by noting that the total delivered power is
220 W. The total power absorbed by the three resistors is
4(5)+16(10)+1(40) or 220 W, which equals the total delivered power.

4.3 The Node-Voltage Method and
Dependent Sources
If the circuit contains dependent sources, the KCL equations must be
supplemented with the constraint equations imposed by the dependent
sources. We will modify Step 3 in the node-voltage method to accommodate
dependent sources. Example 4.4 illustrates the application of the node-
voltage method to a circuit containing a dependent source.
Example 4.4 Using the Node-
Voltage Method with Dependent
Sources
Use the node-voltage method to find the power dissipated in the 5 Ω resistor
in the circuit shown in Fig. 4.10.
Figure 4.10 The circuit for
Example 4.4.

Figure 4.10 Full Alternative Text
Solution
1. Step 1: Identify the circuit’s three essential nodes. We will need two
KCL equations to describe the circuit.
2. Step 2: Since four branches terminate on the lower node, we select it as
the reference node and label the node voltages at the remaining essential
nodes. The results of the first two steps are shown in Fig. 4.11.
Figure 4.11 The circuit
shown in Fig. 4.10, with a
reference node and the node
voltages.

Figure 4.11 Full Alternative Text
3. Step 3: Generate the simultaneous equations by applying KCL at the
nonreference essential nodes. Summing the currents leaving node 1
gives the equation
v1−202+v120+v1−v25=0.
Summing the currents leaving node 2 yields
v2−v15+v210+v2−8iϕ2=0.
As written, these two node-voltage equations contain three unknowns,
namely, v1, v2, and iϕ. We need a third equation, which comes from the
constraint imposed by the dependent source. This equation expresses the
controlling current of the dependent source, iϕ, in terms of the node
voltages, or
iϕ=v1−v25.
As you can see, we need to modify Step 3 in the node-voltage procedure
to remind us to write a constraint equation whenever a dependent source
is present.

4. Step 3: Write a KCL equation at each nonreference essential node. If the
circuit contains dependent sources, write a dependent source constraint
equation that defines the controlling voltage or current of the dependent
source in terms of the node voltages.
The condensed form for Step 3 is shown in Analysis Method 4.2.

3. Write a KCL equation for every nonreference essential node.
If there are dependent sources, write a constraint equation for

5. Step 4: Solve for v1, v2, and iϕ, giving
v1=16 V, v2=10 V, and iϕ=1.2 A.
6. Step 5: Use the node voltage values to find the current in the 5 Ω resistor
and the power dissipated in that resistor:
iφ=v1−v25=16−105=1.2 A,
p5Ω=5iφ2=5(1.2)2=7.2 W.
A good exercise to build your problem-solving intuition is to reconsider
this example, using node 2 as the reference node. Does it make the
analysis easier or harder?

4.4 The Node-Voltage Method:
Some Special Cases
Let’s explore the special case in which a voltage source is the only element
between two essential nodes. The five-step node-voltage method still applies
as long as we modify Step 2.
As an example, let’s look at the circuit in Fig. 4.12. There are three essential
nodes in this circuit, which means two simultaneous equations are needed.
Apply Steps 1 and 2 to identify the essential nodes, choose a reference node,
and label the remaining nodes. Notice that the 100 V source constrains the
voltage between node 1 and the reference node to 100 V. We now modify
Step 2 in order to take advantage of this simplification.
Figure 4.12 A circuit with a
known node voltage.

Figure 4.12 Full Alternative Text
Step 2: Pick and label a reference node, then label the node voltages at the
remaining essential nodes. If a voltage source is the only element between an
essential node and the reference node, replace the node voltage label with the
value of the voltage source.
Thus, we can replace the voltage v1 in the circuit with its value, 100 V, as
shown in Fig. 4.13.
Figure 4.13 The circuit in Fig.
4.12 with the node voltage v1
replaced with its value, 100 V.
Figure 4.13 Full Alternative Text
Now Step 3 requires only a single KCL equation at node 2:
v2−10010+v250−5=0. (4.3)

In Step 4, solve Eq. 4.3 for v2:
v2=125 V.
Knowing v2, we can calculate the current in every branch. Use Step 5 to
verify that the current into node 1 in the branch containing the independent
voltage source is 1.5 A.
As another example, consider the circuit shown in Fig. 4.14, which has four
essential nodes and requires three simultaneous equations. However, two
essential nodes are connected by an independent voltage source, and two
other essential nodes are connected by a current-controlled dependent voltage
source. Making simple modifications to the node-voltage method allows us to
take advantage of these observations.
Figure 4.14 A circuit with a
dependent voltage source
connected between nodes.
Figure 4.14 Full Alternative Text

There are several possibilities for the reference node. The nodes on each side
of the dependent voltage source look attractive because, if chosen, one of the
node voltages would be either +10iϕ (left node is the reference) or −10iϕ
(right node is the reference). The lower node looks even better because one
node voltage is immediately known (50 V) and five branches terminate there.
We therefore opt for the lower node as the reference.
Figure 4.15 shows the redrawn circuit, after Steps 1 and 2. Notice that we
introduced the current i because we cannot express the current in the
dependent voltage source branch as a function of the node voltages v2 and
v3. We write a KCL equation at node 2 to give
Figure 4.15. The circuit shown
in Fig. 4.14 with the selected
node voltages defined.

v2−505+v250+i=0, (4.4)

and at node 3 to give
v3100−i−4=0. (4.5)
We eliminate i simply by adding Eqs. 4.4 and 4.5 to get
v2−505+v250+v3100−4=0. (4.6)
We will continue the steps of the node-voltage method after we introduce a
new concept, the supernode.
The Concept of a Supernode
When a voltage source is between two essential nodes, we can combine those
nodes and the source to form a supernode. Let’s apply the supernode concept
to our circuit from Fig. 4.15. Figure 4.16 shows the circuit redrawn with a
supernode created by combining nodes 2 and 3. We can remember to look for
supernodes by modifying Step 2 one final time:
Figure 4.16 Combining nodes 2
and 3 to form a supernode.

Figure 4.16 Full Alternative Text
Step 2: Pick and label a reference node, then label the node voltages at the
remaining essential nodes. If a voltage source is the only element between an
essential node and the reference node, replace the node voltage label with the
value of the voltage source. If a voltage source is the only element between
two nonreference essential nodes, combine the two essential nodes and the
voltage source into a single supernode.
Step 3 also needs to be modified. Obviously, Kirchhoff’s current law must
hold for supernodes, so we can write a single KCL equation for the
supernode. The supernode also constrains the difference between the node
voltages used to create the supernode to the value of the voltage source
within the supernode. We therefore need to write a supernode constraint
equation. Thus, we arrive at the final version of Step 3.
Step 3: Write a KCL equation at each supernode, then write a KCL equation
at each remaining nonreference essential node where the voltage is unknown.
If there are any dependent sources, write a dependent source constraint
equation for each one, and if there are any supernodes, write a supernode
constraint equation for each one.

The final version of the node-voltage method can be found in the end-of-
chapter Summary; a condensed version is given in Analysis Method 4.3.
Node-Voltage Method
1. Identify each essential node.
2. Pick and label a reference node; then label the node voltage at the
remaining essential nodes.
If a voltage source is the only element between an essential node
and the reference node, replace the node voltage label with the
value of the voltage source.
If a voltage source is the only element between two nonreference
essential nodes, combine the nodes and the source into a single
supernode.
3. Write a KCL equation for each supernode and every remaining
nonreference essential node where the voltage is unknown.
If there are dependent sources, write a constraint equation for each
one.
If there are supernodes, write a constraint equation for each one.
4. Solve the equations to find the node voltage values and any other
unknowns.
5. Solve the circuit using the values from Step 4 to find component

Analysis Method 4.3 Complete form of the node-voltage method.
We can now use Step 3 to create the equations for the circuit in Fig. 4.16.
First, write the KCL equation for the supernode. Starting with the 5 Ω branch
and moving counterclockwise around the supernode, we generate the

equation
v2−505+v250+v3100−4=0, (4.7)
which is identical to Eq. 4.6. Creating a supernode at nodes 2 and 3 has made
writing this equation much easier. Next, write the supernode constraint
equation by setting the value of the voltage source in the supernode to the
difference between the two node voltages in the supernode:
v3−v2=10iφ. (4.8)
Finally, express the current controlling the dependent voltage source as a
function of the node voltages:
iϕ=v2−505. (4.9)
Use Step 5 to solve Eqs. 4.7, 4.8, and 4.9 for the three unknowns v2, v3, and
iϕ to give
v2=60 V,            v3=80 V,      and        iφ=2 A.
Let’s use the node-voltage method to analyze the amplifier circuit first
introduced in Section 2.5 and shown again in Fig. 4.17. When we analyzed
this circuit using Ohm’s law, KVL, and KCL in Section 2.5, we faced the
task of writing and solving six simultaneous equations. Work through
Example 4.5 to see how the node-voltage method can simplify the circuit
analysis.

Use the node-voltage method to find iB in the amplifier circuit shown in Fig.

Solution
Step 1: We identify the four essential nodes, which are labeled a, b, c, and d.
Step 2: Choose node d as the reference node. Then label the voltages at the
remaining three essential nodes. Step 3: Before writing equations, we notice
two special cases. The voltage source VCC in the branch connecting node a
and the reference node constrains the voltage between those nodes, so
va=VCC, and the voltage source V0 in the branch between nodes b and c
constrains the voltage between those nodes and creates a supernode. The
results of Steps 1 and 2 and the modifications prompted by the special cases
are depicted in Fig. 4.18.
Figure 4.18 The circuit shown
in Fig. 4.17, with voltages and
the supernode identified.

Figure 4.18 Full Alternative Text
Continuing Step 3, write the supernode KCL equation to give
vbR2+vb−VCCR1+vcRE−βiB=0. (4.10)

Now write the dependent source constraint equation, which defines the
controlling current iB in terms of the node voltages. Since iB is the current in
a voltage source, we cannot use Ohm’s law, so instead, write a KCL equation
at node c:
iB=vcRE−βiB. (4.11)
The last part of Step 3 is the supernode constraint equation
vb−vc=V0. (4.12)
Step 3 gave us three equations with three unknowns. To solve these
equations, we use back-substitution to eliminate the variables vb and vc.
Begin by rearranging Eq. 4.11 to give
iB=vcRE(1+β). (4.13)
Next, solve Eq. 4.12 for vc to give
vc=vb−V0. (4.14)
Substituting Eqs. 4.13 and 4.14 into Eq. 4.10 and rearranging yields
vb[1R1+1R2+1(1+β)RE]=VCCR1+V0(1+β)RE. (4.15)
Solving Eq. 4.15 for vb yields
vb=VCCR2(1+β)RE+V0R1R2R1R2+(1+β)RE(R1+R2). (4.16)
You should verify that, when Eq. 4.16 is combined with Eqs. 4.13 and 4.14,
the solution for iB is
iB=(VCCR2)/(R1+R2)−V0(R1R2)/(R1+R2)+(1+β)RE, (4.17)
which is identical to Eq. 2.21. (See Problem 4.31.) Using the node-voltage
method to analyze this circuit reduces the problem from manipulating six
simultaneous equations (see Problem 2.38) to manipulating three
simultaneous equations.

4.5 Introduction to the Mesh-
Current Method
Before we learn about the mesh-current method for solving circuits, let’s
summarize the node-voltage method. The node-voltage method presented in
Sections 4.2–4.4 is used to solve a circuit by writing simultaneous KCL
equations at essential nodes. If a dependent source is present, a dependent
source constraint equation is required. Special cases exist when a voltage
source is the only component in a branch connecting two essential nodes. If
one of the essential nodes is the reference node, the node voltage at the other
node is the value of the voltage source and no KCL equation is required at
that node. If neither of the essential nodes is the reference node, the two
nodes and the voltage source are combined into a supernode. A KCL
equation is written for the supernode as well as a supernode constraint
equation. The simultaneous equations are solved to find the node voltages,
and the node voltages can be used to find the voltage, current, and power for
every circuit component.
We now turn to the mesh-current method, presented in Sections 4.5–4.7. The
mesh-current method is used to solve a circuit by writing simultaneous KVL
equations for the circuit’s meshes. If a dependent source is present, a
dependent source constraint equation is required. Special cases exist when a
current source is a component of a mesh. If a current source is a component
in only one mesh, the mesh current must have the same value as the current
source and no KVL equation is needed for that mesh. If a current source is
shared by two adjacent meshes, the two meshes are combined to form a
supermesh. A KVL equation is written for the supermesh as well as a
supermesh constraint equation. The simultaneous equations are solved to find
the mesh currents, and the mesh currents can be used to find the voltage,
current, and power for every circuit component.
Did you notice the symmetries in the descriptions of the node-voltage method
and the mesh-current method? In engineering, this symmetry is called
duality, and we will encounter it throughout this text. In comparing the two

circuit analysis techniques, we see that essential nodes and meshes are duals,
KVL and KCL are duals, voltages and currents are duals, supernodes and
supermeshes are duals, and so on. Recognizing the existence of duality can
help you master the techniques for circuit analysis presented in this book.
Applying the Mesh-Current Method
Recall from the terms defined in Table 4.1 that a mesh is a loop that does not
contain any other loops. You should review the definitions of loop and path
in Table 4.1, too. A mesh current is the current that exists on the perimeter
of a mesh. We represent a mesh current on a circuit diagram using a curved
arrow that follows the mesh perimeter, where the arrowhead indicates the
current’s direction.
Just like the node-voltage method, the mesh-current method is a step-by-step
procedure. Let’s use the mesh-current method for the circuit shown in Fig.
4.19 to solve for the currents i1, i2, and i3. Because the circuit has two
meshes, we expect to write two simultaneous equations.
Figure 4.19 A circuit used to
illustrate development of the
mesh-current method of circuit
analysis.

Figure 4.19 Full Alternative Text
In Step 1, we identify the meshes using a directed curved arrow that follows
the perimeter of the mesh.
Step 2 labels the mesh currents using the labels ia and ib. The results of Steps
1 and 2 are shown in Fig. 4.20. We can see from this figure that the branch
current i1 equals the mesh current ia and that the branch current i2 equals the
mesh current ib. Note that to avoid confusion we use different names for the
branch currents and the mesh currents in this circuit.
Figure 4.20 Mesh currents ia
and ib.

Figure 4.20 Full Alternative Text
In Step 3, we write the KVL equation for each mesh. Let’s start with the
mesh whose mesh current is ia. Pick a starting point anywhere on the
perimeter of the mesh and sum the voltage drops for each component in the
mesh in the direction of the mesh current until you return to the starting point.
Start below the 100 V source and travel in the clockwise direction of the
mesh current. The first voltage is due to the 100 V source and has the value –
100. The next voltage is across the 4 Ω resistor, whose current is ia, so from
Ohm’s law the voltage is 4ia. The next voltage is across the 10 Ω resistor,
whose current is (ia – ib), so from Ohm’s law the voltage is 10(ia – ib). We
are back to the starting point, so KVL tells us that the sum of these three
voltages is zero:
−100+4ia+10(ia−ib)=0.
Repeat this process to get the KVL equation for the ib mesh. Remember that
you can start anywhere on the perimeter of this mesh, so let’s start at the left
of the 5 Ω resistor. Again we determine the voltage drops for each component
in the direction of the ib mesh. The voltage drop for the 5 Ω resistor is 5ib,
the voltage drop for the 40 V source is 40, and the voltage drop for the 10 Ω
resistor is 10(ib – ia). We have returned to the starting point, so KVL tells us
that the sum of these three voltages is zero:
5ib+40+10(ib−ia)=0.

In Step 4, we solve these simultaneous mesh current equations (see Appendix
A) to find that the mesh current values are
ia=10 A
and
ib=4 A.
Step 5 uses the mesh currents to solve for the currents, voltages, and power
for all components in the circuit. Let’s calculate the three branch currents to
illustrate:
i1=ia=10 A,
i2=ib=4 A,
i3=ia−ib=6 A.
The ability to calculate the branch currents using the mesh currents is crucial
to the mesh-current method of circuit analysis. Once you know the mesh
currents, you also know the branch currents. And once you know the branch
currents, you can compute any voltages or powers of interest. A condensed
version of the mesh-current method is given in Analysis Method 4.4.
Mesh-Current Method
1. Identify the meshes with curved directed arrows that follow the
perimeter of each mesh.
2. Label the mesh currents for each mesh.
3. Write the KVL equations for each mesh.

powers and a branch voltage.

2. Calculate the voltage vo across the 8 Ω resistor.

Solution
1. Step 1: We identify the three meshes in the circuit and draw the mesh
currents as directed curved arrows following the perimeter of each mesh.
It is best to define all mesh currents in the same direction.
Step 2: Label the mesh currents; the results of the first two steps are
depicted in Fig. 4.22.
Figure 4.22 The three mesh
currents used to analyze the
circuit shown in Fig. 4.21.
Figure 4.22 Full Alternative Text
Step 3: We use KVL to generate an equation for each mesh by summing
the voltages in the direction of the mesh current. In the ia mesh, start just
below the 40 V source and sum the voltages in the clockwise direction
to give

−40+2ia+8(ia−ib)=0.
In the ib mesh, start below the 8 Ω resistor and sum the voltages in the
clockwise direction to give
8(ib−ia)+6ib+6(ib−ic)=0.
In the ic mesh, start below the 6 Ω resistor and sum the voltages in the
clockwise direction to give
6(ic−ib)+4ic+20=0.
Step 4: Solve the three simultaneous mesh current equations from Step 3
to give
ia=5.6 A,ib=2.0 A,ic=−0.80 A.
Step 5: Use the mesh currents to find the power for each source. The
mesh current ia equals the branch current in the 40 V source, so the
power associated with this source is
p40V=−40ia=−224 W.
The minus sign means that this source is delivering power to the
network. The current in the 20 V source equals the mesh current ic;
therefore
p20 V=20ic=−16 W.
The 20 V source also is delivering power to the network.
2. The branch current in the 8 Ω resistor in the direction of the voltage drop
vo is ia−ib. Therefore
vo=8(ia−ib)=8(3.6)=28.8 V.

the sum equal to zero. The three mesh-current equations are
5(i1−i2)+20(i1−i3)−50=0,
5(i2−i1)+1i2+4(i2−i3)=0,

unknown currents:
i1=29.6 A,i2=26 A,i3=28 A,iϕ=1.6 A.
5. Step 5: Use the mesh currents to find the power for the 4 Ω resistor. The
current in the 4 Ω resistor oriented from left to right is i3−i2, or 2 A.
Therefore, the power dissipated is
p4Ω=(i3−i2)2(4)=(2)2(4)=16 W.
What if you had not been told to use the mesh-current method? Would
you have chosen the node-voltage method? It reduces the problem to
finding one unknown node voltage because of the presence of two
voltage sources between essential nodes. We say more about making
such choices in Section 4.8.

4.7 The Mesh-Current Method:
Some Special Cases
Recall that voltage sources present special cases when using the node-voltage
method (Section 4.4). So, it is no surprise that current sources present special
cases when using the mesh-current method. There are two special cases, one
that occurs when a current source is in a single mesh, and the other that
occurs when a current source is shared by two adjacent meshes.
When a current source is in a single mesh, the value of the mesh current is
known, since it must equal the current of the source. Therefore, we label the
mesh current with its value, and we do not need to write a KVL equation for
that mesh. This leads to the following modification in Step 2 of the mesh-
current method.
Step 2: Label the mesh current for each mesh; if there is a current source in a
single mesh, label the mesh current with the value of the current source.
This special case is illustrated in Example 4.8.
Example 4.8 A Special Case in the
Mesh-Current Method
Use the mesh-current method to find branch currents ia, ib, and ic in the
circuit for Example 4.3, repeated here as Fig. 4.25.
Figure 4.25 The circuit for
Example 4.8.

Figure 4.25 Full Alternative Text
Solution
1. Step 1: Use directed arrows that traverse the mesh perimeters to identify
the three mesh currents.
2. Step 2: Label the mesh currents as i1, i2, and i3. The modification in
Step 2 reminds us to look for current sources, and the i3 mesh has a
current source that is not shared by any other mesh. Therefore, the i3
mesh current equals the current supplied by the source. Note that i3 and
the current source are in opposite directions, so the current in this mesh
should be labeled −3 A. The results of Steps 1 and 2 are shown in Fig.
4.26.
Figure 4.26 The circuit
shown in Fig. 4.25 with the
mesh currents identified and
labeled.

Figure 4.26 Full Alternative Text
3. Step 3: Write the KVL equations for the meshes whose mesh currents
are unknown, which in this example are the i1 and i2 meshes.
Remember to pick a starting point anywhere along the mesh, sum the
voltages in the direction of the mesh current, and set the sum equal to
zero when you return to the starting point. The resulting simultaneous
mesh current equations are
−50+5i1+10(i1−i2)=0and10(i2−i1)+40(i2−(−3))=0.
4. Step 4: Solving the simultaneous mesh current equations gives
i1=2 Aandi2=−2 A.
5. Step 5: Finally, we use the mesh currents to calculate the branch currents
in the circuit, ia, ib, and ic.
ia=i1=2 A,ib=i1−i2=4 A, ic=i2+3=1 A.
These are the same branch current values as those calculated in Example
4.3. Which of the two circuit analysis methods is better when calculating
the branch currents? Which method is better when calculating the power
associated with the sources?
Now we turn our attention to the other special case, created by a current

source that is shared between two adjacent meshes. The circuit shown in Fig.
4.27 depicts this situation. Applying Steps 1 and 2, we define the mesh
currents ia, ib, and ic, as well as the voltage across the 5 A current source. In
Step 3, we write the KVL equations for each mesh; let’s start with mesh a
and pick the starting point just below the 100 V source. The first two voltages
we encounter when we traverse the mesh in the direction of the mesh current
are −100 V and 3(ia – ib). But when we get to the current source, we must
label the voltage drop across it as v and use this variable in the equation.
Thus, for mesh a:
Figure 4.27 A circuit
illustrating mesh analysis when
a branch contains an
independent current source.

Figure 4.27 Full Alternative Text
−100+3(ia−ib)+v+6ia=0. (4.18)
The same situation arises in mesh c, to give
50+4ic−v+2(ic−ib)=0. (4.19)
We now add Eqs. 4.18 and 4.19 to eliminate v; when simplified, the result is
−50+9ia−5ib+6ic=0. (4.20)
We will complete Steps 4 and 5 in the mesh-current method after introducing
a new concept, the supermesh.
The Concept of a Supermesh
When a current source is shared between two meshes, we can combine these
meshes to form a supermesh, which traverses the perimeters of the two
meshes and avoids the branch containing the shared current source. Figure
4.28 illustrates the supermesh concept. Using a modified Step 3, we write a
KVL equation around the supermesh (denoted by the dashed line), using the
original mesh currents to give
Figure 4.28 The circuit shown
in Fig. 4.27, illustrating the
concept of a supermesh.

Figure 4.28 Full Alternative Text
−100+3(ia−ib)+2(ic−ib)+50+4ic+6ia=0,
which simplifies to
−50+9ia−5ib+6ic=0. (4.21)
Note that Eqs. 4.20 and 4.21 are identical. Thus, the supermesh has
eliminated the need for introducing the unknown voltage across the current
source.
The KVL equation for the b mesh is
10ib+2(ib−ic)+3(ib−ia)=0. (4.22)
We have two simultaneous equations, Eqs. 4.21 and 4.22, but three
unknowns. Remember that the presence of a supernode in the node-voltage
method requires a KCL equation at the supernode and a supernode constraint
equation that defines the difference between the node voltages in the

supernode as the value of the voltage source in the supernode. In a like
manner, the presence of a supermesh in the mesh-current method requires a
KVL equation around the supermesh and a supermesh constraint equation
that defines the difference between the mesh currents in the supermesh as the
value of the shared current source. From Fig. 4.28, the supermesh constraint
equation is
ic−ia=5. (4.23)
The final version of Steps 2 and 3 in the mesh-current method reminds us
how to handle current sources in our circuits:
Step 2: Label the mesh current for each mesh; if there is a current source
in a single mesh, label the mesh current with the value of the source. If
there is a current source shared between two meshes, create a supermesh
by combining the two meshes and mentally erasing the current source.
Step 3: Write a KVL equation around each supermesh and each single
mesh where the mesh current is unknown. If there is a dependent source,
write a constraint equation defining the controlling quantity for the
dependent source in terms of the mesh currents. If there is a supermesh,
write a supermesh constraint equation that defines the difference
between the two mesh currents in the supermesh as the value of the
shared current source.
The final version of the mesh-current method can be found in the end-of-
chapter Summary; a condensed version is given in Analysis Method 4.6.
Mesh-Current Method
1. Identify the meshes with curved directed arrows that follow the
perimeter of each mesh.
2. Label the mesh currents for each mesh.
If a current source is in a single mesh, label the mesh current with
the value of the current source.

If a current source is shared between two meshes, combine the
meshes to create a supermesh and mentally erase the current
source.
3. Write the KVL equations for each supermesh and each single mesh
where the current is unknown.
If there are dependent sources, write a dependent source constraint
equation for each.
If there are supermeshes, write a supermesh constraint equation for
each.
4. Solve the KVL equations and any constraint equations to find the
mesh-current values and other unknowns.
5. Solve the circuit using mesh currents from Step 4 to find component
currents, voltages, and power values.

to solve the amplifier circuit from Example 4.5.

Use the mesh-current method to find iB for the amplifier circuit in Fig. 4.29.

Solution
1. Step 1: Use directed arrows that traverse the mesh perimeters to identify
the three mesh currents.
2. Step 2: Label the mesh currents as ia, ib, and ic. Then recognize the
current source that is shared between the ia and ic meshes. Combine
these meshes, bypassing the branch with the shared current source, to
create a supermesh. The result of the first two steps is the circuit shown
in Fig. 4.30.
Figure 4.30 The circuit
shown in Fig. 4.29, depicting
the supermesh created by the
presence of the dependent
current source.

Figure 4.30 Full Alternative Text
3. Step 3: Using KVL, sum the voltages around the supermesh in terms of
the mesh currents ia, ib, and ic to obtain
R1ia+vCC+RE(ic−ib)−V0=0. (4.24)
The KVL equation for mesh b is

R2ib+V0+RE(ib−ic)=0. (4.25)
The constraint imposed by the dependent current source is
iB=ib−ia. (4.26)
The supermesh constraint equation is
βiB=ib−ic. (4.27)
4. Step 4: Use back-substitution to solve Eqs. 4.24–4.27. Start by
combining Eqs. 4.26 and 4.27 to eliminate iB and solve for ic to give
ic=(1+β)ia−βib. (4.28)
We now use Eq. 4.28 to eliminate ic from Eqs. 4.24 and 4.25:
[R1+(1+β)RE]ia−(1+β)REib=V0−VCC,(4.29)
−(1+β)REia+[R2+(1+β)RE]ib=−V0.(4.30)
You should verify that the solution of Eqs. 4.29 and 4.30 for ia and ib
gives
ia=V0R2−VCCR2−VCC(1+β)RER1R2+(1+β)RE(R1+R2), (4.31)
ib=−V0R1−(1+β)REVCCR1R2+(1+β)RE(R1+R2). (4.32)
5. Step 5: Use the two mesh currents from Eqs. 4.31 and 4.32, together
with the definition for iB in Eq. 4.26, to find iB. You should verify that
the result is the same as that given by Eq. 2.21.

4.8 The Node-Voltage Method
Versus the Mesh-Current Method
It is natural to ask, “When is the node-voltage method preferred to the mesh-
current method and vice versa?” As you might suspect, there is no clear-cut
answer. Asking a number of questions, however, may help you identify the
more efficient method before plunging into the solution process:
Does one of the methods result in fewer simultaneous equations to
solve?
Is there a branch between two essential nodes that contains only a
voltage source? If so, making one of the essential nodes the reference
node and using the node-voltage method reduces the number of
equations to be solved.
Is there a mesh containing a current source that is not shared with an
adjacent mesh? If so, using the mesh-current method allows you to
reduce the number of equations to be solved.
Will solving some portion of the circuit give the requested solution? If
so, which method is most efficient for solving just the pertinent portion
of the circuit?
Perhaps the most important observation is that, for any situation, some time
spent thinking about the problem in relation to the various analytical
approaches available is time well spent. Examples 4.10 and 4.11 illustrate the
process of deciding between the node-voltage and mesh-current methods.
Example 4.10 Understanding the
Node-Voltage Method Versus Mesh-

Current Method
Find the power dissipated in the 300 Ω resistor in the circuit shown in Fig.
4.31.
Figure 4.31 The circuit for
Example 4.10.
Figure 4.31 Full Alternative Text
Solution
To find the power dissipated in the 300 Ω resistor, we need to find either the

current in the resistor or the voltage across it. The mesh-current method
yields the current in the resistor; this approach requires solving five mesh
equations, as depicted in Fig. 4.32, and a dependent source constraint
equation, for a total of six simultaneous equations.
Figure 4.32 The circuit shown
in Fig. 4.31, with the five mesh
currents.
Figure 4.32 Full Alternative Text
Let’s now consider using the node-voltage method. The circuit has four
essential nodes, and therefore only three node-voltage equations are required
to describe the circuit. The dependent voltage source between two essential

nodes forms a supernode, requiring a KCL equation and a supernode
constraint equation. We have to sum the currents at the remaining essential
node, and we need to write the dependent source constraint equation, for a
total of four simultaneous equations. Thus, the node-voltage method is the
more attractive approach.
1. Step 1: We begin by identifying the four essential nodes in the circuit of
Fig. 4.31. The three black dots at the bottom of the circuit identify a
single essential node, and the three black dots in the middle of the circuit
are the three remaining essential nodes.
2. Step 2: Select a reference node. Two essential nodes in the circuit in Fig.
4.31 merit consideration. The first is the reference node in Fig. 4.33,
where we also defined the three node voltages v1, v2, and v3, and
indicated that nodes 1 and 3 form a supernode because they are
connected by a dependent voltage source. If the reference node in Fig.
4.33 is selected, one of the unknown node voltages is the voltage across
the 300 Ω resistor, namely, v2 in Fig. 4.33. Once we know this voltage,
we calculate the power in the 300 Ω resistor by using the expression
p300Ω=v22/300.
Figure 4.33 The circuit
shown in Fig. 4.31, with a
reference node.

Figure 4.33 Full Alternative Text
The second node worth considering as the reference node is the bottom
node in the circuit, as shown in Fig. 4.34. If this reference node is
chosen, one of the unknown node voltages is eliminated because
vb=50iΔ. We would need to write two KCL equations and a dependent
source constraint equation, and solve these three simultaneous
equations. However, to find either the current in the 300 Ω resistor or the
voltage across it requires an additional calculation once we know the
node voltages va and vc.
Figure 4.34 The circuit
shown in Fig. 4.31 with an

alternative reference node.
Figure 4.34 Full Alternative Text
3. Step 3: We compare these two possible reference nodes by generating
two sets of KCL equations and constraint equations. The first set
pertains to the circuit shown in Fig. 4.33, and the second set is based on
the circuit shown in Fig. 4.34.
Set 1 (Fig. 4.33)
At the supernode,
v1100+v1−v2250+v3200+v3−v2400+v3−(v2+128)500
+v3+256150=0.

At v2,
v2300+v2−v1250+v2−v3400+v2+128−v3500=0.
The dependent source constraint equation is
iΔ=v2300.
The supernode constraint equation is
v1−v3=50iΔ.
Set 2 (Fig. 4.34); remember that vb=50iΔ.
At va,
va200+va−256150+va−50iΔ100+va−vc300=0.
At vc,
vc400+vc+128500+vc−50iΔ250+vc−va300=0.
The dependent source constraint equation is
iΔ=vc−va300.
4. Step 4: Solve each set of equations.
5. Step 5: Verify that both solutions lead to a power calculation of 16.57 W
dissipated in the 300 Ω resistor.

Voltage and Mesh-Current Methods
Find the voltage vo in the circuit shown in Fig. 4.35.

Figure 4.35 The circuit for
Example 4.11.
Figure 4.35 Full Alternative Text
Solution
We first consider using the mesh-current method.
1. Step 1: Identify the three mesh currents in the circuit using directed
arrows that follow the mesh perimeters.
2. Step 2: Label the three mesh currents. Because there are two currents
sources, each shared by two meshes, we can combine all three meshes
into a single supermesh that traverses the perimeter of the entire circuit
and avoids the two branches with current sources. The result of these
two steps is shown in Fig. 4.36.

Figure 4.36 The circuit
shown in Fig. 4.35 with the
three mesh currents.
Figure 4.36 Full Alternative Text
3. Step 3: Write the KCL equation for the supermesh:
−193+4ia+2.5ib+2ic+0.8vθ+8ic+7.5ib+6ia=0.
The supermesh constraint equations are
ib−ia=0.4vΔandic−ib=0.5,
and the two dependent source constraint equations are
vΔ=2icandvθ=−7.5ib.
4. Step 4: We must solve the five simultaneous equations generated in Step

3.
5. Step 5: We need one additional equation to find vo from the mesh
current ia:
vo=193−10ia.
Now let’s consider using the node-voltage method.
6. Step 1: There are four essential nodes in the circuit of Fig. 4.35,
identified by the four black dots in the figure.
7. Step 2: We can make the unknown voltage vo one of the three node
voltages by choosing the bottom left node as the reference node. After
labeling the remaining two node voltages, we have the circuit in Fig.
4.37.
Figure 4.37 The circuit
shown in Fig. 4.35 with node
voltages.

Figure 4.37 Full Alternative Text
8. Step 3: The KCL equations are
vo−19310−0.4vΔ+vo−va2.5=0,
va−vo2.5−0.5+va−(vb+0.8vθ)10=0,
vb7.5+0.5+vb+0.8vθ−va10=0.
The dependent source constraint equations are
vθ=−vbandvΔ=2[va−(vb+0.8vθ)10].
9. Step 4: Once we solve these five simultaneous equations, we have the
value of vo without writing an additional equation, so Step 5 is not
needed.
Based on the comparison of the two methods, the node-voltage method
involves a bit less work. You should verify that both approaches give
vo=173 V.

4.9 Source Transformations
We are always interested in methods that simplify circuits. Series-parallel
reductions and Δ-to-Y transformations are already on our list of simplifying
techniques. We now expand the list with source transformations. A source
transformation allows a voltage source in series with a resistor to be
replaced by a current source in parallel with the same resistor or vice versa.
Figure 4.38 shows a source transformation. The double-headed arrow
emphasizes that a source transformation is bilateral; that is, we can start with
either configuration and derive the other.
Figure 4.38 Source
transformations.

Figure 4.38 Full Alternative Text

We need to find the relationship between vs and is that guarantees the two
configurations in Fig. 4.38 are equivalent with respect to nodes a and b.
Equivalence is achieved if any resistor RL has the same current and thus the
same voltage drop, whether connected between nodes a and b in Fig. 4.38(a)
or Fig. 4.38(b).
Suppose RL is connected between nodes a and b in Fig. 4.38(a). Using
Ohm’s law, we find that the current in RL is
iL=vsR+RL. (4.33)
Now suppose the same resistor RL is connected between nodes a and b in
Fig. 4.38(b). Using current division, we see that the current in RL is
iL=RR+RLis. (4.34)
If the two circuits in Fig. 4.38 are equivalent, these resistor currents must be
the same. Equating the right-hand sides of Eqs. 4.33 and 4.34 and simplifying
gives the condition of equivalence:
is=vsR. (4.35)
When Eq. 4.35 is satisfied for the circuits in Fig. 4.38, the current in RL
connected between nodes a and b is the same for both circuits for all values
of RL. If the current in RL is the same for both circuits, then the voltage drop
across RL is the same for both circuits, and the circuits are equivalent at
nodes a and b. If the polarity of vs is reversed, the orientation of is must be
reversed to maintain equivalence.
Example 4.12 uses source transformations to simplify a circuit-analysis
problem.
Example 4.12 Using Source
Transformations to Solve a Circuit

4.39 and state whether the 6 V source is absorbing or delivering the power.
Figure 4.39 The circuit for
Example 4.12.
Figure 4.39 Full Alternative Text
Solution
If we study the circuit shown in Fig. 4.39, we see ways to simplify the circuit
by using source transformations. But we must simplify the circuit in a way
that preserves the branch containing the 6 V source. Therefore, begin on the
right side of the circuit with the branch containing the 40 V source. We can
transform the 40 V source in series with the 5 Ω resistor into an 8 A current
source in parallel with a 5 Ω resistor, as shown in Fig. 4.40(a).
Figure 4.40 Step-by-step
simplification of the circuit
shown in Fig. 4.39.


Figure 4.40 Full Alternative Text

Next, replace the parallel combination of the20 Ω and 5 Ω resistors with a
4 Ω resistor. This 4 Ω resistor is in parallel with the 8 A source and therefore
can be replaced with a 32 V source in series with a 4 Ω resistor, as shown in
Fig. 4.40(b). The 32 V source is in series with 20 Ω of resistance and, hence,
can be replaced by a current source of 1.6 A in parallel with 20 Ω, as shown
in Fig. 4.40(c). The 20 Ω and 30 Ω parallel resistors can be reduced to a
single 12 Ω resistor. The parallel combination of the 1.6 A current source and
the 12 Ω resistor transforms into a voltage source of 19.2 V in series with
12 Ω. Figure 4.40(d) shows the result of this last transformation. The current
in the direction of the voltage drop across the 6 V source is (19.2−6)/16, or
0.825 A. Therefore, the power associated with the 6 V source is
p6V=(6) (0.825)=4.95 W
and the voltage source is absorbing power.
Practice your circuit analysis skills by using either the node-voltage method
or the mesh-current method to solve this circuit and verify that you get the
same answer.
A couple of questions arise from the source transformation depicted in Fig.
4.40.
What happens if there is a resistance Rp in parallel with the voltage
source?
What happens if there is a resistance Rs in series with the current
source?
In both cases, the resistance can be removed to create a simpler equivalent
circuit with respect to terminals a and b. Figure 4.41 summarizes this
observation. The two circuits depicted in Fig. 4.41(a) are equivalent with
respect to terminals a and b because they produce the same voltage and
current in any resistor RL inserted between nodes a and b. The same can be
said for the circuits in Fig. 4.41(b). Example 4.13 illustrates an application of
the equivalent circuits depicted in Fig. 4.41.

3. Find the power developed by the 8 A current source.
Solution
1. We begin by removing the 125 Ω and 10 Ω resistors because the 125 Ω
resistor is connected in parallel with the 250 V voltage source and the
10 Ω resistor is connected in series with the 8 A current source. We also
combine the series-connected resistors in the rightmost branch into a

Now use a source transformation to replace the series-connected 250 V
source and 25 Ω resistor with a 10 A source in parallel with the 25 Ω
resistor, as shown in Fig. 4.44. We can then use Kirchhoff’s current law
to combine the parallel current sources into a single source. The parallel
resistors combine into a single resistor. Figure 4.45 shows the result.
Hence vo=20 V.

2. We need to return to the original circuit in Fig. 4.42 to calculate the
power associated with the sources. While a resistor connected in parallel
with a voltage source or a resistor connected in series with a current

source can be removed without affecting the terminal behavior of the
circuit, these resistors play an important role in how the power is
dissipated throughout the circuit. The current supplied by the 250 V
source, represented as is, equals the current in the 125 Ω resistor plus the
current in the 25 Ω resistor. Thus,
is=250125+ 250−2025=11.2 A.
Therefore, the power developed by the voltage source is
p250V(developed)=(250) (11.2)=2800 W.
3. To find the power developed by the 8 A current source, we first find the
voltage across the source. If we let vs represent the voltage across the
source, positive at the upper terminal of the source, we obtain

4.10 Thévenin and Norton
Equivalents
At times in circuit analysis, we want to concentrate on what happens at a
specific pair of terminals. For example, when we plug a toaster into an outlet,
we are interested primarily in the voltage and current at the terminals of the
toaster. We have little or no interest in the effect that connecting the toaster
has on voltages or currents elsewhere in the circuit supplying the outlet. We
can expand this interest in terminal behavior to a set of appliances, each
requiring a different amount of power. We then are interested in how the
voltage and current delivered at the outlet change as we change appliances. In
other words, we want to focus on the behavior of the circuit supplying the
outlet, but only at the outlet terminals.
Thévenin and Norton equivalents are circuit simplification techniques. These
equivalent circuits retain no information about the internal behavior of the
original circuit and focus only on terminal behavior. They are extremely
valuable when analyzing complex circuits where one portion of the circuit is
fixed, so it can be replaced by a simple Thévenin or Norton equivalent, and
another portion of the circuit is changing. Although here we discuss them as
they pertain to resistive circuits, Thévenin and Norton equivalent circuits may
be used to represent any circuit made up of linear elements.
The Thévenin equivalent circuit is the simplest equivalent for a given circuit
and consists of a single voltage source in series with a single resistor. The
Norton equivalent circuit is the source transform of the Thévenin equivalent
circuit. To better grasp the concept of a Thévenin equivalent circuit, imagine
a circuit with a complex interconnection of resistors, independent sources,
and dependent sources, as shown in Fig. 4.46(a). We are interested in
simplifying this complex circuit with respect to the terminals a and b. The
simplified equivalent circuit, shown in Fig. 4.46(b), is the series combination
of a voltage source VTh and a resistor RTh called the Thévenin equivalent
circuit. It is equivalent to the original circuit in the sense that, if we connect
the same load across the terminals a and b of each circuit, we get the same

voltage and current at the terminals of the load. This equivalence holds for all
possible values of load resistance.
Figure 4.46 (a) A general
circuit. (b) The Thévenin
equivalent circuit.
 

The Thévenin Equivalent
To represent the original circuit by its Thévenin equivalent, we must calculate
the Thévenin voltage VTh and the Thévenin resistance RTh. First, we note
that if the load resistance is infinitely large, we have an open-circuit
condition. The open-circuit voltage at the terminals a and b in the circuit
shown in Fig. 4.46(b) is VTh. By hypothesis, this must be the same as the
open-circuit voltage at the terminals a and b in the original circuit. Therefore,
to find the Thévenin voltage VTh, calculate the open-circuit voltage in the
original circuit.
Reducing the load resistance to zero gives us a short-circuit condition. If we
place a short circuit across the terminals a and b of the Thévenin equivalent
circuit, the short-circuit current directed from a to b is
isc=VThRTh. (4.36)
By hypothesis, this short-circuit current must be identical to the short-circuit
current that exists in a short circuit placed across the terminals a and b of the
original network. From Eq. 4.36,
RTh=VThisc. (4.37)
Thus, the Thévenin resistance is the ratio of the open-circuit voltage to the
short-circuit current. Work through Example 4.14 to see how to find the
Thévenin equivalent of a circuit.
Example 4.14 Finding a Thévenin
Equivalent
Find the Thévenin equivalent of the circuit in Fig. 4.47.
Figure 4.47 A circuit used to

illustrate a Thévenin
equivalent.
Figure 4.47 Full Alternative Text
Solution
To find the Thévenin equivalent of the circuit shown in Fig. 4.47, we first
calculate the open-circuit voltage vab. Note that when the terminals a, b are
open, there is no current in the 4 Ω resistor. Therefore the open-circuit
voltage vab is identical to the voltage across the 3 A current source, labeled
v1. We find the voltage by solving a single KCL equation. Choosing the
lower node as the reference node, we get
v1−255+v120−3=0.
Solving for v1 yields
v1=32 V=VTh.

Hence, the Thévenin voltage for the circuit is 32 V.
The next step is to place a short circuit across the terminals a and b and
calculate the resulting short-circuit current. Figure 4.48 shows the circuit with
the short in place. Note that the short-circuit current is in the direction of the
open-circuit voltage drop across the terminals a and b. If the short-circuit
current is in the direction of the open-circuit voltage rise across the terminals,
a minus sign must be inserted in. Eq. 4.37.
Figure 4.48 The circuit shown
in Fig. 4.47 with terminals a
and b short-circuited.
Figure 4.48 Full Alternative Text
The short-circuit current (isc) is found easily once v2 is known. Therefore,
the problem reduces to finding v2 with the short in place. Again, if we use the
lower node as the reference node, the KCL equation at the node labeled v2 is

v2−255+ v220−3+ v24=0.
Solving for v2 gives
v2=16 V.
Hence, the short-circuit current is
isc=164=4 A.
We now find the Thévenin resistance by substituting the numerical values for
the Thévenin voltage, VTh, and the short-circuit current, isc, into Eq. 4.37:
RTh=VThisc=324=8 Ω.
Figure 4.49 shows the Thévenin equivalent for the circuit shown in Fig. 4.45.
Figure 4.49 The Thévenin
equivalent of the circuit shown
in Fig. 4.47.

Figure 4.49 Full Alternative Text
You should verify that, if a 24 Ω resistor is connected across the terminals a
and b in Fig. 4.47, the voltage across the resistor will be 24 V and the current
in the resistor will be 1 A, as would be the case with the Thévenin circuit in
Fig. 4.49. This same equivalence between the circuits in Figs. 4.47 and 4.49
holds for any resistor value connected between nodes a and b.
The Norton Equivalent
A Norton equivalent circuit consists of an independent current source in
parallel with the Norton equivalent resistance, as shown in Fig. 4.50. We can
derive it directly from the original circuit by calculating the open-circuit
voltage and the short-circuit current, just as we did when calculating the
Thévenin equivalent. The Norton current equals the short-circuit current at
the terminals of interest, and the Norton resistance is the ratio of the open-
circuit voltage to the short-circuit current, so it is identical to the Thévenin
resistance:
Figure 4.50 (a) A general
circuit. (b) The Norton
equivalent circuit.

 
IN=isc;
RN=vocisc=RTh. (4.38)
If we already have a Thévenin equivalent circuit, we can derive the Norton
equivalent circuit from it simply by making a source transformation.
Using Source Transformations
Sometimes we can use source transformations to derive a Thévenin or Norton

equivalent circuit. This technique works best when the network contains only
independent sources. Dependent sources require us to retain the identity of
the controlling voltages and/or currents, and this constraint usually prohibits
simplification of the circuit by source transformations. Work through
Example 4.15 to see how a series of source transformations leads to a Norton
equivalent circuit.
Example 4.15 Finding a Norton
Equivalent
Find the Norton equivalent of the circuit in Fig. 4.47 by making a series of
source transformations.
Solution
We start on the left side of the circuit and transform the series-connected 25
V source and 5 Ω resistor to a parallel-connected 5 A source and 5 Ω resistor,
as shown in Step 1 of Fig. 4.51. Use KCL to combine the parallel-connected
5 A and 3 A sources into a single 8 A source, and combine the parallel-
connected 5 Ω and 25 Ω resistors into a single 4 Ω resistor, as shown in Step
2 of Fig. 4.51. Now transform the parallel-connected 8 A source and 4 Ω
resistor to a series-connected 32 V source and 4 Ω resistor, and combine the
two series-connected 4 Ω resistors into a single 8 Ω resistor, as shown in Step
3 of Fig. 4.51. Note that the result of Step 3 is the Thévenin equivalent circuit
we derived in Example 4.12. Finally, transform the series-connected 32 V
source and 8 Ω resistor into a parallel-connected 4 A source and 8 Ω resistor,
which is the Norton equivalent circuit, as shown in Step 4 of Fig. 4.51.

Find the Thévenin equivalent for the circuit containing dependent sources
shown in Fig. 4.52.
Figure 4.52 A circuit used to
illustrate a Thévenin equivalent
when the circuit contains
dependent sources.

Figure 4.52 Full Alternative Text
Solution
The first step in analyzing the circuit in Fig. 4.52 is to recognize that the
current labeled ix must be zero. (Note the absence of a return path for ix to
enter the left-hand portion of the circuit.) The open- circuit, or Thévenin,
voltage is the voltage across the 25 Ω resistor. Since ix=0,
VTh=vab=(−20i)(25)=−500i.
The current i is
i=5−3v2000=5−3VTh2000.
In writing the equation for i, we recognize that the Thévenin voltage is
identical to v. When we combine these two equations, we obtain
VTh=−5 V.
To calculate the short-circuit current, we place a short circuit across a and b.
When the terminals a and b are shorted together, the control voltage v is

reduced to zero. Therefore, with the short in place, the circuit shown in Fig.
4.52 becomes the one shown in Fig. 4.53. With the short circuit shunting the
25 Ω resistor, all of the current from the dependent current source appears in
the short, so
Figure 4.53 The circuit shown
in Fig. 4.52 with terminals a
and b short-circuited.
Figure 4.53 Full Alternative Text
isc=−20i.
As the voltage controlling the dependent voltage source has been reduced to
zero, the current controlling the dependent current source is
i=52000=2.5 mA.
Combining these two equations yields a short-circuit current of

isc=−20(2.5)=−50 mA.
From isc and VTh we get
RTh=vThisc=−5−0.05=100 Ω.

4.11 More on Deriving the Thévenin
Equivalent
We can calculate the Thévenin resistance, RTh, directly from the circuit
rather than calculating it as the ratio of the open-circuit voltage to the short-
circuit current (Eq. 4.37). If the circuit contains only independent sources and
resistors, we can determine RTh by deactivating all independent sources and
then calculating the resistance seen looking into the network at the designated
terminal pair. A voltage source is deactivated by replacing it with a short
circuit, while a current source is deactivated by replacing it with an open
circuit. Example 4.17 illustrates this direct method for determining RTh.
Example 4.17 Finding the Thévenin
Equivalent Resistance Directly from
the Circuit
Find RTh the circuit shown in Fig. 4.55.
Figure 4.55 A circuit used to
illustrate a Thévenin
equivalent.

Figure 4.55 Full Alternative Text
Solution
Deactivating the independent sources simplifies the circuit to the one shown
in Fig. 4.56. The resistance seen looking into the terminals a and b is denoted
Rab, which consists of the 4 Ω resistor in series with the parallel combination
of the 5 and 20 Ω resistors. Thus,
Figure 4.56 The circuit shown
in Fig. 4.55 after deactivation of
the independent sources.

Figure 4.56 Full Alternative Text
Rab=RTh=4+5× 2025=8 Ω.
Note that deriving RTh directly from the circuit is much simpler than finding
RTh from Eq. 4.37, as we did in Example 4.14.
If the circuit or network contains dependent sources, a direct method for
finding the Thévenin resistance RTh is as follows. We first deactivate all
independent sources, and then we apply either a test voltage source or a test
current source to the Thévenin terminals a and b. The Thévenin resistance
equals the ratio of the voltage across the test source to the current delivered
by the test source. Example 4.18 illustrates this alternative procedure for
finding RTh, using the same circuit as Example 4.16.
Example 4.18 Finding the Thévenin
Equivalent Resistance Using a Test
Source
Find the Thévenin resistance RTh for the circuit in Fig. 4.52, using the test

source method.
Solution
Begin by deactivating the independent voltage source and exciting the circuit
from the terminals a and b with either a test voltage source or a test current
source. If we apply a test voltage source, we will know the voltage of the
dependent voltage source and hence the controlling current i. Therefore, we
opt for the test voltage source. Figure 4.57 shows the circuit for computing
the Thévenin resistance.
Figure 4.57 An alternative
method for computing the
Thévenin resistance.
Figure 4.57 Full Alternative Text
The test voltage source is denoted vT, and the current that it delivers to the

circuit is labeled iT. To find the Thévenin resistance, we solve the circuit for
the ratio of the voltage to the current at the test source; that is, RTh=vT/iT.
From Fig. 4.57,
iT=vT25+20i,i=−3vT2000.
We then substitute the expression for i into the equation for iT and solve the
resulting equation for the ratio iT/vT:
iT=vT25−60vT2000,
iTvT=125−6200=505000=1100.
The Thévenin resistance is the inverse of the ratio iT/vT, so
RTh=vTiT=100 Ω.
In a network containing only resistors and dependent sources, the Thévenin
equivalent voltage VTh=0 and the Norton equivalent current IN=0. It should
be clear that if the circuit you start with has no independent sources, its
equivalent circuit cannot have any independent sources either. Therefore, the
Thévenin and Norton equivalents for a circuit with only dependent sources
and resistors is a single equivalent resistance, whose value must be
determined using the test source method. The procedure is illustrated in
Example 4.19.
Example 4.19 Finding the Thévenin
Equivalent of a Circuit with
Dependent Sources and Resistors
Find the Norton equivalent for the circuit in Fig. 4.58.

Figure 4.58 Full Alternative Text
Solution
The circuit in Fig. 4.58 has no independent sources. Therefore, the Norton
equivalent current is zero, and the Norton equivalent circuit consists only of
the Norton resistance, RN. Applying a test source to the terminals a and b is
the only way to determine RN. We have applied a test current source, whose
value is iT, as shown in Fig. 4.59. Analyze this circuit to calculate the voltage
across the test source, vT, and then calculate the Norton equivalent resistance
using the ratio of vT to iT.

Fig.4.58 with a test current

Write a KCL equation at the top essential node to give
iT=vT20+10−vx6+vT30.
Use voltage division to find the voltage across the 10 Ω resistor:
vx=1020+10vT=vT3.
Then,
iT=vT30−vT18+vT30=vT90.
Therefore, the Norton equivalent of the circuit in Fig. 4.58 is a single resistor
whose resistance RN=vT/iT=90 Ω.

We conclude this discussion of Thévenin and Norton equivalents with one
final example of their application in circuit analysis. Sometimes we can use a
Thévenin equivalent to simplify one portion of a circuit, thereby greatly
simplifying analysis of the larger network. Let’s return to the amplifier circuit
first introduced in Section 2.5 and subsequently analyzed in Sections 4.4 and
4.7. Study Example 4.20 to see how a Thévenin equivalent of one portion of
this circuit helps us in the analysis of the whole circuit.

We now derive an equation for iB by summing the voltages around the left

VTh=RThiB+V0+RE(1+β)iB,

iB=VTh−V0RTh+ (1+β)RE. (4.41)

expression obtained in Eq. 2.25. Note that once we have incorporated the
Thévenin equivalent into the original circuit, we can obtain the solution for

4.12 Maximum Power Transfer
Circuit analysis plays an important role in the analysis of systems designed to
transfer power from a source to a load. This text discusses power transfer in
two basic types of systems.
Systems Optimized for Maximum Efficiency Power utility systems
are a good example of this type because they generate, transmit, and
distribute large quantities of electric power. If a power utility system is
inefficient, a large percentage of the power generated is lost in the
transmission and distribution processes, and thus wasted. We will look
at these types of systems in Sections 9.10 and 9.11.
Systems Optimized for Maximum Power Communication and
instrumentation systems are good examples because when information
(data) is transmitted via electric signals, the power available at the
transmitter or detector is limited. Thus, transmitting as much of this
power as possible to the receiver (load) is desirable. In such
applications, the amount of power being transferred is small, so the
transfer efficiency is not a primary concern. Here we consider maximum
power transfer in systems that can be modeled by a purely resistive
circuit.
Maximum power transfer can best be described with the aid of the circuit
shown in Fig. 4.63. We assume a resistive network containing independent
and dependent sources and a designated pair of terminals, a and b, to which a
load, RL, is connected. The problem is to determine the value of RL that
permits maximum power delivery to RL. The first step in this process is to
recognize that a resistive network can always be replaced by its Thévenin
equivalent. Therefore, we redraw the circuit shown in Fig. 4.63 as the one
shown in Fig. 4.64. Replacing the original network by its Thévenin
equivalent greatly simplifies the task of finding RL. To derive RL, begin by
expressing the power dissipated in RL as a function of the three circuit
parameters VTh, RTh, and RL. Thus

Figure 4.63 A circuit describing
maximum power transfer.
Figure 4.63 Full Alternative Text
Figure 4.64 A circuit used to
determine the value of RL for
maximum power transfer.

Figure 4.64 Full Alternative Text
p=i2 RL=(VThRTh+RL)2RL. (4.42)
Next, we recognize that for a given circuit, VTh and RTh will be fixed.
Therefore, the power dissipated is a function of the single variable RL. To
find the value of RL that maximizes the power, we use elementary calculus to
write an equation for the derivative of p with respect to RL:
dpdRL=VTh2[(RTh+RL)2−RL⋅ 2(RTh+RL)(RTh+RL)4].
The derivative is zero and p is maximized when
(RTh+RL)2=2RL(RTh + RL).
Solving for the load resistance RL yields
Condition for Maximum Power
Transferred to a Resistive Load

RL=RTh. (4.43)
Thus, maximum power transfer occurs when the load resistance RL equals
the Thévenin resistance RTh. To find the maximum power delivered to RL,
substitute Eq. 4.43 into Eq. 4.42:
Maximum Power Transferred to a
Resistive Load
pmax=VTh2RL(2RL)2=VTh24RL. (4.44)
Analyzing a circuit to calculate the load resistor required for maximum power
transfer is illustrated in Example 4.21.

The Thévenin resistance is
RTh=(150)(30)180=25  Ω
Replacing the circuit to the left of the terminals a and b with its
Thévenin equivalent gives us the circuit shown in Fig. 4.66, so RL must

4.13 Superposition
A linear system obeys the principle of superposition, which states that
whenever a linear system is excited, or driven, by more than one independent
source of energy, the total response is the sum of the individual responses. An
individual response is the result of an independent source acting alone.
Because we are dealing with circuits made up of interconnected linear-circuit
elements, we can apply the principle of superposition directly to the analysis
of such circuits when they are driven by more than one independent energy
source. At present, we restrict the discussion to simple resistive networks;
however, the principle is applicable to any linear system.
Superposition is applied in both the analysis and design of circuits. In
analyzing a complex circuit with multiple independent voltage and current
sources, there are often fewer, simpler equations to solve when the effects of
the independent sources are considered one at a time. Applying superposition
can thus simplify circuit analysis. Be aware, though, that sometimes applying
superposition actually complicates the analysis, producing more equations to
solve than with an alternative method. Superposition is required only if the
independent sources in a circuit are fundamentally different. In these early
chapters, all independent sources are dc sources, so superposition is not
required. We introduce superposition here in anticipation of later chapters in
which circuits will require it.
Superposition is applied in design to synthesize a desired circuit response that
could not be achieved in a circuit with a single source. If the desired circuit
response can be written as a sum of two or more terms, the response can be
realized by including one independent source for each term of the response.
This approach to the design of circuits with complex responses allows a
designer to consider several simple designs instead of one complex design.
We demonstrate the superposition principle in Example 4.22.
Example 4.22 Using Superposition

shown in Fig. 4.67.

Solution
We begin by finding the branch currents resulting from the 120 V voltage
source. We denote those currents with a prime. Replacing the ideal current
source with an open circuit deactivates it; Fig. 4.68 shows this. The branch
currents in this circuit are the result of only the voltage source.

We can easily find the branch currents in the circuit in Fig. 4.68 once we
know the node voltage across the 3 Ω resistor. Denoting this voltage v1,

from which
v1=30 V.
Now we can write the expressions for the branch currents i′1 − i′4 directly:

i′2=303=10 A,
i′3=i′4=306=5 A.

To find the component of the branch currents resulting from the current
source, we deactivate the ideal voltage source and solve the circuit shown in
Fig. 4.69. The double-prime notation for the currents indicates they are the
components of the total current resulting from the ideal current source.

We determine the branch currents in the circuit shown in Fig. 4.69 by first
solving for the node voltages across the 3 and 4 Ω resistors, respectively.
Figure 4.70 shows the two node voltages. The two KCL equations that
describe the circuit are

voltages v3 and v4.

v33+v36+v3−v42=0,v4−v32+ v44 +12=0.
Solving the simultaneous KCL equations for v3 and v4, we get
v3=−12 V,v4=−24 V.
Now we can write the branch currents i″1 through i″4 directly in terms of the
node voltages v3 and v4:
i″1=−v36=126=2 A,
i″2=v33=−123=−4 A,
i″3=v3−v42=−12+242=6 A,
i″4=v44=−244=−6 A.
To find the branch currents in the original circuit, that is, the currents i1, i2,
i3, and i4 in Fig. 4.67, we simply add the single-primed currents to the
double-primed currents:
i1=i′1+ i″1=15+2=17 A,i2=i′2+ i″2=10−4=6 A,i3=i′3+ i″3=5+6=11 A,i4=i
′4+ i″4=5−6=−1 A.

You should verify that the currents i1, i2, i3, and i4 have the correct values
for the branch currents in the circuit shown in Fig. 4.67.
When applying superposition to linear circuits containing both independent
and dependent sources, you must recognize that the dependent sources are
never deactivated. Example 4.23 applies superposition when a circuit
contains both dependent and independent sources.

Solution
We begin by finding the component of vo resulting from the 10 V source.
Figure 4.72 shows the circuit. With the 5 A source deactivated, v′Δ must
equal (−0.4v′Δ) (10). Hence, v′Δ must be zero, the branch containing the two

4v″Δ+ vb−2i″Δ=50.
We now use

vb=2i″Δ+ v″Δ
to find the value for v″Δ. Thus,
5v″Δ=50,  or  v″Δ=10 V.
From the node a equation,
5v″0=80,  or  v″0=16 V.
The value of vo is the sum of v′o and v″o, or 24 V.

Practical Perspective
Circuits with Realistic Resistors
It is not possible to fabricate identical electrical components. For example,
resistors produced from the same manufacturing process can vary in value by
as much as 20%. Therefore, in creating an electrical system, the designer
must consider the impact that component variation will have on the
performance of the system. Sensitivity analysis permits the designer to
calculate the impact of variations in the component values on the output of
the system. We will see how this information enables a designer to specify an
acceptable component value tolerance for each of the system’s components.
Consider the circuit shown in Fig. 4.74. We will use sensitivity analysis to
determine the sensitivity of the node voltages v1 and v2 to changes in the
resistor R1. Using the node-voltage method, we derive the expressions for v1
and v2 as functions of the circuit resistors and source currents. The results are
given in Eqs. 4.45 and 4.46:

Figure 4.74 Circuit used to
introduce sensitivity analysis.
Figure 4.74 Full Alternative Text
v1=R1{R3R4Ig2− [R2(R3+R4)+R3R4]Ig1}(R1+R2)(R3+R4)+R3R4, (4.45)
v2=R3R4[(R1+R2)Ig2−R1Ig1](R1+R2) (R3+R4)+ R3R4. (4.46)
The sensitivity of v1 with respect to R1 is found by differentiating Eq. 4.45
with respect to R1, and similarly the sensitivity of v2 with respect to R1 is
found by differentiating Eq. 4.46 with respect to R1. We get
dv1d R1=[R3R4+R2(R3+R4)] {R3R4Ig2−[R3R4+R2(R3+R4)]Ig1}
[(R1+R2)(R3+R4)+R3R4]2, (4.47)
dv2d R1=R3R4{R3R4Ig2−[R2(R3+R4)+ R3R4]Ig1}[(R1+R2)
(R3+R4)+R3R4]2. (4.48)
We now consider an example with actual component values to illustrate the
use of Eqs. 4.47 and 4.48.

Example
Assume the nominal values of the components in the circuit in Fig. 4.74 are:
R1=25 Ω; R2=5 Ω; R3=50 Ω; R4=75 Ω; Ig1=12 A; and Ig2=16 A. Use
sensitivity analysis to predict the values of v1 and v2 if the value of R1 is
different by 10% from its nominal value.
Solution
From Eqs. 4.45 and 4.46 we find the nominal values of v1 and v2. Thus
v1=25{3750(16)−[5(125)+3750]12}30(125)+3750=25 V, (4.49)
and
v2=3750[30(16)−25(12)]30(125)+3750=90 V. (4.50)
Now from Eqs. 4.47 and 4.48 we can find the sensitivity of v1 and v2 to
changes in R1. Hence,
dv1dR1=[3750+5(125)]−{ 3750(16)−[3750+5(125)]12 }[(30)
(125)+3750]2=712 V/Ω, (4.51)
and
dv2dR1=3750{ 3750(16)−[5(125)+3750]12 }](7500)2=0.5 V/Ω. (4.52)
How do we use the results given by Eqs. 4.51 and 4.52? Assume that R1 is
10% less than its nominal value, that is, R1=22.5 Ω. Then ΔR1=−2.5 Ω and
Eq. 4.51 predicts that Δv1 will be
Δv1=(712)(−2.5)=−1.4583 V.
Therefore, if R1 is 10% less than its nominal value, our analysis predicts that
v1 will be

v1=25−1.4583=23.5417 V. (4.53)
Similarly, for Eq. 4.52 we have
Δv2=0.5(−2.5)=−1.25 V,
v2=90−1.25=88.75 V. (4.54)
We attempt to confirm the results in Eqs. 4.53 and 4.54 by substituting the
value R1=22.5 Ω into Eqs. 4.45 and 4.46. When we do, the results are
v1=23.4780 V,
v2=88.6960 V.
Why is there a difference between the values predicted from the sensitivity
analysis and the exact values computed by substituting for R1 in the
equations for v1 and v2? We can see from Eqs. 4.47 and 4.48 that the
sensitivity of v1 and v2 with respect to R1 is a function of R1 because R1
appears in the denominator of both Eqs. 4.47 and 4.48. This means that as R1
changes, the sensitivities change; hence, we cannot expect Eqs. 4.47 and 4.48
to give exact results for large changes in R1. Note that for a 10% change in
R1, the percent error between the predicted and exact values of v1 and v2 is
small. Specifically, the percent error in v1=0.2713% and the percent error in
v2=0.0676%.
From this example, we can see that a tremendous amount of work is involved
if we are to determine the sensitivity of v1 and v2 to changes in the remaining
component values, namely, R2, R3, R4, Ig1, and Ig2. Fortunately, PSpice2
has a sensitivity function that will perform sensitivity analysis for us. The
sensitivity function in PSpice calculates two types of sensitivity. The first is
known as the one-unit sensitivity, and the second is known as the 1%
sensitivity. In the example circuit, a one-unit change in a resistor would
change its value by 1 Ω and a one-unit change in a current source would
change its value by 1 A. In contrast, 1% sensitivity analysis determines the
effect of changing resistors or sources by 1% of their nominal values.
2 See the PSpice supplement that accompanies this text.
The result of PSpice sensitivity analysis of the circuit in Fig. 4.69 is shown in

Table 4.2. Because we are analyzing a linear circuit, we can use superposition
to predict values of v1 and v2 if more than one component’s value changes.
For example, let us assume R1 decreases to 24 Ω and R2 decreases to 4 Ω.
From Table 4.2 we can combine the unit sensitivity of v1 to changes in R1
and R2 to get
Table 4.2 PSpice Sensitivity
Analysis Results

Table 4.2 Full Alternative Text
Δv1ΔR1+ Δv1ΔR2=0.5833−5.417=−4.8337 V/Ω.

Similarly,
Δv2ΔR1+Δv2ΔR2=0.5+6.5=7.0 V/Ω.
Thus, if both R1 and R2 decreased by 1 Ω, we would predict
v1=25+ 4.8227=29.8337 V,
v2=90−7=83 V.
If we substitute R1=24 Ω and R2=4 Ω into Eqs. 4.45 and 4.46, we get
v1=29.793 V,
v2=82.759 V.
In both cases, our predictions are within a fraction of a volt of the actual node
voltage values.
Circuit designers use the results of sensitivity analysis to determine which
component value variation has the greatest impact on the output of the circuit.
As we can see from the PSpice sensitivity analysis in Table 4.2, the node
voltages v1 and v2 are much more sensitive to changes in R2 than to changes
in R1. Specifically, v1 is (5.417/0.5833) or approximately 9 times more
sensitive to changes in R2 than to changes in R1, and v2 is (6.5/0.5) or 13
times more sensitive to changes in R2 than to changes in R1. Hence, in the
example circuit, the tolerance on R2 must be more stringent than the
tolerance on R1 if it is important to keep v1 and v2 close to their nominal
values.

Summary
For the topics in this chapter, mastery of some basic terms, and the
concepts they represent, is necessary. Those terms are node, essential
node, path, branch, essential branch, mesh, and planar circuit. Table
4.1 provides definitions and examples of these terms. (See page 95.)
Two new circuit analysis techniques were introduced in this chapter:
The node-voltage method works with both planar and nonplanar
circuits. The steps in the node-voltage method are in Table 4.3.(See
page 135.)
Table 4.3 Steps in the
Node-Voltage Method and
the Mesh-Current Method

Table 4.3 Full Alternative Text
The mesh-current method works only with planar circuits. The

steps in the mesh-current method are in Table 4.3. (See page 135.)
Several new circuit simplification techniques were introduced in this
chapter:
Source transformations allow us to exchange a voltage source
(vs) and a series resistor (R) for a current source (is) and a parallel
resistor (R) and vice versa. The combinations must be equivalent in
terms of their terminal voltage and current. Terminal equivalence
holds, provided that
is=vsR.
(See page 115–116.)
Thévenin equivalents and Norton equivalents allow us to simplify a
circuit composed of sources and resistors into an equivalent circuit
consisting of a voltage source and a series resistor (Thévenin) or a
current source and a parallel resistor (Norton). The simplified circuit and
the original circuit must be equivalent in terms of their terminal voltage
and current. Note that
1. The Thévenin voltage (VTh) is the open-circuit voltage across the
terminals of the original circuit;
2. The Thévenin resistance (RTh) is the ratio of the Thévenin voltage
to the current in a short circuit connecting the terminals of the
original circuit;
3. The Norton equivalent is obtained by performing a source
transformation on a Thévenin equivalent.
(See page 118–121.)
Maximum power transfer is a technique for calculating the maximum
value of p that can be delivered to a load, RL. Maximum power transfer
occurs when RL=RTh, the Thévenin resistance as seen from the resistor
RL. The equation for the maximum power transferred is

p=VTh24RL.
(See page 126–127.)
In a circuit with multiple independent sources, superposition allows us
to activate one source at a time and calculate voltages and currents due
to each source. To determine the voltages and currents that exist when
all independent sources are active, sum the voltages and currents that
resulted from each of the sources. Dependent sources are never
deactivated when applying superposition. (See page 129.)

7. 5.7 A More Realistic Model for the Operational Amplifier

Chapter Objectives
1. Be able to name the five op amp terminals and describe and use the
voltage and current constraints and the resulting simplifications they
lead to in an ideal op amp.
2. Be able to analyze simple circuits containing ideal op amps and
recognize the following op amp circuits: inverting amplifier, summing
amplifier, noninverting amplifier, and difference amplifier.
3. Understand the more realistic model for an op amp and be able to use
this model to analyze simple circuits containing op amps.
This chapter analyzes circuits containing sources, resistors, and a new
component, the operational amplifier (op amp). Unlike sources and resistors,
the op amp is not an ideal basic circuit element. Instead, it is a complicated
integrated circuit consisting of many electronic components such as
transistors and diodes that are beyond the scope of this text. We can use op
amps in introductory circuits, however, by taking a black box approach that
focuses solely on the terminal behavior of the op amp (not on its internal
structure or the currents and voltages that exist in this structure).
Operational amplifier circuits were first used as basic building blocks in
analog computers. The term operational refers to op amp circuits that
implement mathematical operations such as integration, differentiation,
addition, sign changing, and scaling. While the range of applications has
broadened beyond implementing mathematical operations, the original name
for the circuit persists.
We do not introduce new circuit analysis techniques in this chapter. Instead,
we apply tools we have already introduced to analyze and design interesting
and useful op amp circuits that perform scaling, addition, and subtraction.
Once we introduce inductors and capacitors in Chapter 6, we will present op
amp circuits that integrate and differentiate electric signals.

Initially, we employ an ideal model of the op amp’s terminal behavior. At the
conclusion of this chapter, we consider a more realistic op amp model that
employs a dependent source. This provides additional opportunities to
practice analyzing circuits with these sources.
Practical Perspective
Strain Gages
How could you measure the amount of bending in metal cables, such as the
ones shown in the figure, without physically contacting the cables? One
method uses a strain gage, which is a type of transducer. A transducer is a
device that measures a quantity by converting it into a more convenient form.
The quantity we wish to measure in the metal bar is the bending angle, but
measuring the angle directly is quite difficult and could even be dangerous.
Instead, we attach a strain gage (shown in the line drawing here) to the metal
bar. A strain gage is a grid of thin wires whose resistance changes when the
wires are lengthened or shortened, according to the equation
ΔR=2RΔLL,
where R is the resistance of the gage at rest, ΔL /L is the fractional
lengthening of the gage (which is the definition of “strain”), 2 is a constant
typical of the manufacturer’s gage factor, and ΔR is the change in resistance
due to the bending of the bar. Typically, pairs of strain gages are attached to
opposite sides of a bar. When the bar is bent, the wires in one pair of gages
get longer and thinner, increasing the resistance, while the wires in the other
pair of gages get shorter and thicker, decreasing the resistance.


Horiyan/Shutterstock
How can the change in resistance be measured? One way would be to use an
ohmmeter. However, the change in resistance experienced by the strain gage
is typically much smaller than an ohmmeter can measure accurately. Usually,
the pairs of strain gages are connected to form a Wheatstone bridge, and the
voltage difference between two legs of the bridge is measured. We use an op
amp circuit to amplify, or increase, the voltage difference to make an accurate
measurement. After we introduce the operational amplifier and some of the
important circuits that employ them, we conclude with an analysis of a strain
gage circuit that measures the bending in the metal bar.


5.1 Operational Amplifier
Terminals
We begin by looking at the terminal behavior of a commercially available op
amp, the μA 741. Fairchild Semiconductor introduced this widely used device
in 1968. This op amp is available in several different packages. For our
discussion, we assume an eight-lead DIP.1 Figure 5.1 shows a top view of the
package, with the terminals, their names, and numbers. We focus on the
following terminals:
1 DIP is an abbreviation for dual in-line package. This means that the
terminals on each side of the package are in line and that the terminals on
opposite sides of the package also line up.
inverting input,
noninverting input,
output,
positive power supply (V+),
negative power supply (V−).
Figure 5.1 The eight-lead
DIP package (top view).


Figure 5.1 Full Alternative Text
The remaining three terminals are of little or no concern. The two offset null
terminals may be used in an auxiliary circuit that compensates for
performance degradation owing to aging and imperfections. These terminals
are seldom used because degradation is usually negligible. Terminal 8 is an
unused terminal; NC stands for no connection, which means that the terminal
is not connected to the op amp circuit.
Figure 5.2 shows a common circuit symbol for an op amp that contains the
five terminals of primary interest. Because word labels are inconvenient in
circuit diagrams, we simplify the terminal designations in the following way.
The noninverting input terminal is labeled plus (+), and the inverting input
terminal is labeled minus (−). The power supply terminals, which are always
drawn outside the triangle, are marked V+ and V−. The terminal at the apex
of the triangle is always understood to be the output terminal. Figure 5.3
summarizes these simplifications.

5.2 Terminal Voltages and Currents
We now describe the behavior of the op amp using the terminal voltages and
currents. The voltage variables are measured from a common reference
node.2 Figure 5.4 shows the five voltage variables with their reference
polarities.
2 The common node is external to the op amp. It is the reference terminal of
the circuit in which the op amp is embedded.
Figure 5.4 Terminal voltage
variables.

Figure 5.4 Full Alternative Text
All voltages are considered as voltage rises from the common node, a
convention we also used in the node-voltage analysis method. A positive
supply voltage (VCC) is connected between V+ and the common node. A
negative supply voltage (−VCC) is connected between V− and the common
node. The voltage between the inverting input terminal and the common node
is denoted vn. The voltage between the noninverting input terminal and the
common node is designated as vp. The voltage between the output terminal
and the common node is denoted vo.
Figure 5.5 shows the current variables with their reference directions, all of
which are into the terminals of the operational amplifier: in is the current into
the inverting input terminal; ip is the current into the noninverting input
terminal; io is the current into the output terminal; ic+ is the current into the
positive power supply terminal; and ic− is the current into the negative power
supply terminal.

Figure 5.5 Full Alternative Text
The terminal behavior of the op amp as a linear circuit element is
characterized by constraints on the input voltages and the input currents. The
voltage constraint is derived from the voltage transfer characteristic of the op
amp integrated circuit, pictured in Fig. 5.6.
Figure 5.6 The voltage transfer
characteristic of an op amp.

Figure 5.6 Full Alternative Text
The voltage transfer characteristic describes how the output voltage varies as
a function of the input voltages—that is, how voltage is transferred from the
input to the output. Note that the op amp’s output voltage is a function of the
difference between its input voltages, vp−vn. The equation for the voltage
transfer characteristic is
vo={−VCCA(vp−vn)<−VCC,A(vp−vn)−VCC≤A(vp
−vn)≤+VCC,+ VCCA(vp−vn)>+VCC. (5.1)
We see from Fig. 5.6 and Eq. 5.1 that the op amp has three distinct regions of
operation: negative saturation, linear region, and positive saturation. When
the magnitude of the input voltage difference (|vp−vn|) is small, the op amp
behaves as a linear device, so the output voltage is a linear function of the
input voltages. More specifically, the output voltage is equal to the difference

between the input voltages times the multiplying constant, or gain, A.
Outside this linear region are two saturation regions. When the output of the
op amp saturates, the op amp behaves as a nonlinear device; its output
voltage is no longer a linear function of the input voltages.
OP AMP Input Voltage Constraints
When we confine the op amp to its linear operating region, a constraint is
imposed on the input voltages, vp and vn. The constraint is based on typical
numerical values for VCC and A in Eq. 5.1. For most op amps, the
recommended dc power supply voltages seldom exceed 20 V, and the gain,
A, is rarely less than 10,000, or 104. We see from both Fig. 5.6 and Eq. 5.1
that in the linear region, the magnitude of the input voltage difference (|vp
− vn|) must be less than 20/104, or 2 mV.
Node voltages in the circuits we study are typically much larger than 2 mV,
so a voltage difference of less than 2 mV means the two voltages are
essentially equal. Thus, when an op amp is constrained to its linear operating
region and the node voltages are much larger than 2 mV, the constraint on the
input voltages of the op amp is
Input Voltage Constraint for an OP
AMP
vp=vn. (5.2)
Note that Eq. 5.2 characterizes the relationship between the input voltages for
an ideal op amp—that is, an op amp whose value of A is infinite.
We can use Eq. 5.2 only if the op amp is confined to its linear operating
region. The op amp stays in its linear region if the op amp circuit includes a
signal path from the op amp’s output terminal to its inverting input terminal.
This configuration is known as negative feedback because the signal is fed
back from the output and is subtracted from the input signal. The negative

feedback causes the input voltage difference to decrease. Because the output
voltage is proportional to the input voltage difference, the output voltage is
also decreased, and the op amp operates in its linear region.
If a circuit containing an op amp does not provide a negative feedback path
from the op amp output to the inverting input, then the op amp will normally
saturate. But even if the circuit provides a negative feedback path for the op
amp, linear operation is not guaranteed. So how do we know whether the op
amp is operating in its linear region?
The answer is, we don’t! We deal with this dilemma by assuming linear
operation, performing the circuit analysis, and then checking our results for
contradictions. For example, suppose we assume that an op amp in a circuit is
operating in its linear region, and we compute the output voltage of the op
amp to be 10 V. On examining the circuit, we discover that VCC is 6 V,
resulting in a contradiction, because the op amp’s output voltage can be no
larger than VCC. Thus, our assumption of linear operation was invalid, and
the op amp output must be saturated at 6 V.
We have identified a constraint on the input voltages that is based on the
voltage transfer characteristic of the op amp, the assumption that the op amp
is restricted to its linear operating region, and typical values for VCC3 and A.
Equation 5.2 represents the voltage constraint for an ideal op amp, that is,
with a value of A that is infinite.
3 The positive and negative power supply voltages do not have to be equal in
magnitude. In the linear operating region, vo must lie between the two supply
voltages. For example, if V+=15 V and V-=-10 V, then −10 V≤vo≤15 V.
OP AMP Input Current Constraints
We now turn our attention to the constraint on the input currents. Analysis of
the op amp integrated circuit reveals that the equivalent resistance seen by the
input terminals of the op amp is very large, typically 1 MΩ or more. Ideally,
the equivalent input resistance is infinite, resulting in the current constraint

Input Current Constraint for an
Ideal OP AMP
ip=in=0.(5.3)
Note that the current constraint is not based on assuming that the op amp is
confined to its linear operating region, as was the voltage constraint.
Together, Eqs. 5.2 and 5.3 form the constraints on terminal behavior that
define our ideal op amp model.
From Kirchhoff’s current law we know that the sum of the currents entering
the operational amplifier is zero, or
ip+in+io+ic++ic−=0.
Substituting the constraint given by Eq. 5.3 into this KCL equation gives
io=−(ic++ ic−).
The equation for io tells us that, even though the current at the input terminals
is negligible, there may still be appreciable current at the output terminal.
When we use Eqs. 5.2 and 5.3 in analyzing a circuit with an op amp, we are
effectively using an ideal model of that op amp. Let’s summarize the circuit
analysis steps:
Analyzing a Circuit With an Ideal
OP AMP
1. Check for a negative feedback path. If it exists, assume the op amp
operates in its linear region.
2. Write a KCL equation at the inverting input terminal.

3. Solve the KCL equation and use the solution to find the op amp’s output
voltage.
4. Compare the op amp’s output voltage to the power supply voltages to
determine if the op amp is operating in its linear region or if it is
saturated.
Analysis Method 5.1 Analyzing an ideal op amp circuit with a negative
feedback path.
1. Step 1: Check for the presence of a negative feedback path; if it exists,
we can assume the op amp is operating in its linear region.
2. Step 2: Write a KCL equation at the inverting input terminal, using the
input current constraint (Eq. 5.3), the value of vn (Eq. 5.2), and Ohm’s
law to find the currents. This equation will usually contain the unknown
voltage at the op amp’s output terminal.
3. Step 3: Solve the KCL equation and calculate the voltage at the op
amp’s output terminal.
4. Step 4: Compare the voltage at the op amp’s output terminal to the
power supply voltages to determine whether the op amp is actually in its
linear region or whether it has saturated.
These steps are summarized in Analysis Method 5.1. Example 5.1 analyzes
an op amp circuit using this analysis method.

1. Calculate vo if va=1 V and vb=0 V.
2. Repeat (a) for va=1 V and vb=2 V.
3. If va=1.5 V, specify the range of vb that avoids amplifier saturation.
Solution
1. Step 1: A negative feedback path exists from the op amp’s output to its
inverting input through the 100 kΩ resistor, so we assume the op amp is

confined to its linear operating region.
Step 2: The voltage at the inverting input terminal is 0 because vp=vb=0
from the connected voltage source, and vn=vp from the voltage
constraint in Eq. 5.2.
Step 3: Use KCL to sum the currents entering the node labeled vn to get
i25+i100-in=0.
Remember that in is the current entering the inverting op amp terminal.
From Ohm’s law,
i25=va−vn25,000=1−025,000=125,000;i100=vo−vn100,000=vo
−0100,000=vo100,000.
The current constraint requires in=0. Substituting the values for the three
currents into the KCL equation, we obtain
125+vo100=0.
Hence, vo is -4V.
Step 4: Because vo lies between ±10 V, our assumption that the op amp
is in its linear region of operation is confirmed.
2. Using the same steps as in (a), we get
vp=vb=vn=2V,i25=−i100.i25=va−vn25,000=1−225,000=
−125,000 ;i100=vo−vn100,000=vo−2100,000 .
Therefore, vo=6V. Again, vo lies within ±10 V.
3. As before, vn=vp=vb, and i25=-i100. Because va=1.5 V,
1.5-vb25,000=vo-vb100,000 .
Solving for vb as a function of vo gives

vb=15(6+vo).
Now, if the amplifier operates within its linear region, −10V≤vo≤10V.
Substituting these limits on vo into the expression for vb, we find the
range for vb is
−0.8V≤vb≤3.2V.

5.3 The Inverting-Amplifier Circuit
This section and the three that follow present some important op amp circuits.
We begin with the inverting-amplifier circuit, shown in Fig. 5.8. This circuit
contains an ideal op amp, two resistors (Rf and Rs), a voltage source (vs), and
a short circuit connecting the noninverting input terminal and the common
node.
Figure 5.8 An inverting-
amplifier circuit.

Figure 5.8 Full Alternative Text
We can analyze this circuit to obtain an expression for the output voltage, vo,
as a function of the source voltage, vs. Starting with Step 1, we note the
circuit’s negative feedback path, so assume the op amp is in its linear
operating region. In Step 2, the voltage constraint of Eq. 5.2 sets the voltage
at vn=0, because the voltage at vp=0. Step 3 generates a single KCL equation
at the inverting terminal of the op amp, given as
is+if=in.
From Ohm’s law,
is=vsRs,if=voRf.
Now we invoke the constraint stated in Eq. 5.3, namely,
in=0.
Substituting the expressions for is, if, and in into the KCL equation and
solving for vo yields
Inverting Amplifier Equation
vo=−RfRsvs.(5.4)
Note that the output voltage is an inverted, scaled replica of the input. The
sign reverses, or inverts, from input to output. The scaling factor, or gain, is
the ratio Rf/Rs,which is usually greater than 1, so |vo|>|vs|. Hence, we call
this circuit an inverting amplifier.
Using Step 4, we see that the result given by Eq. 5.4 is valid only if the op
amp shown in the circuit in Fig. 5.8 is operating in its linear region. Even if
the op amp is not ideal, Eq. 5.4 is a good approximation. (We demonstrate
this in Section 5.7.) Equation 5.4 specifies the gain of the inverting amplifier
with the external resistors Rf and Rs. In Step 4, the upper limit on the gain,
Rf/Rs, is determined by the power supply voltages and the value of the signal

voltage vs. If we assume equal power supply voltages, that is, V+=−V
−=VCC, we get
|vo | ≤VCC,  |RfRsvs| ≤ VCC,          RfRs≤|VCCvs|.
For example, if VCC=15 V and vs=10 mV, the ratio Rf/Rs must be less than
1500.
In the inverting amplifier circuit shown in Fig. 5.8, the resistor Rf provides
the negative feedback connection. That is, it connects the output terminal to
the inverting input terminal. If Rf is removed, the feedback path is opened
and the amplifier is said to be operating open loop. Figure 5.9 shows the
open-loop operation.
Figure 5.9 An inverting
amplifier operating open loop.
Figure 5.9 Full Alternative Text

Opening the feedback path drastically changes the behavior of the circuit. To
understand the open-loop circuit, we do not replace the op amp with its ideal
model; although A and the input resistance are both large, they are not
infinite. Now the output voltage is
vo=−Avn, (5.5)
assuming as before that V+=−V−=VCC ; then | vn | < VCC/A for linear
operation. Because the inverting input current is almost zero, the voltage drop
across Rs is almost zero, and the inverting input voltage nearly equals the
signal voltage, vs ; that is, vn≈vs. Hence, the op amp can operate open loop in
the linear mode only if | vs | < VCC/A. If |vs| >VCC/A, the op amp simply
saturates. In particular, if vs<−VCC/A, the op amp saturates at +VCC, and if
vs>VCC/A, the op amp saturates at −VCC. Because the relationship shown in
Eq. 5.5 occurs when there is no feedback path, the value of A is often called
the open-loop gain of the op amp.
Example 5.2 uses the inverting-amplifier equation to design an inverting
amplifier using realistic resistor values.
Example 5.2 Designing an Inverting
Amplifier
1. Design an inverting amplifier (see Fig. 5.8) with a gain of 12. Use ±15 V
power supplies and an ideal op amp.
2. What range of input voltages, vs, allows the op amp in this design to
remain in its linear operating region?
Solution
1. We need to find two resistors whose ratio is 12 from the realistic resistor
values listed in Appendix H. There are lots of different possibilities, but
let’s choose Rs=1 kΩ and Rf=12 kΩ. Use the inverting-amplifier

equation (Eq. 5.4) to verify the design:
vo=−RfRsvs=−12,000 1000 vs=−12vs.
Thus, we have an inverting amplifier with a gain of 12, as shown in Fig.
5.10.

amplifier for Example 5.2.

2. Solve two different versions of the inverting-amplifier equation for vs,
first using vo=+15 V and then using vo=−15 V:

   15=−12vs so  vs=−1.25 V;−15=−12vs  so  vs=1.25 V.
Thus, if the input voltage is greater than or equal to −1.25 V and less
than or equal to +1.25 V, the op amp in the inverting amplifier will
remain in its linear operating region.

5.4 The Summing-Amplifier Circuit
Figure 5.11 shows a summing amplifier with three input voltages. The output
voltage of a summing amplifier is an inverted, scaled sum of the voltages
applied to the input of the amplifier. We can find the relationship between the
output voltage vo and the three input voltages, va, vb, and vc,using Analysis
Method 5.1.
Figure 5.11 A summing
amplifier.
Figure 5.11 Full Alternative Text
The summing amplifier has a negative feedback path that includes the resistor

Rf, so in Step 1 we assume the op amp is in its linear region. We then use the
ideal op amp voltage constraint in Step 2 together with the ground imposed
by the circuit at vp to determine that vn=vp=0. In Step 3, we write a KCL
equation at the inverting input terminal, using Ohm’s law to specify the
current in each resistor in terms of the voltage across that resistor, to get
vn−vaRa+vn−vbRb+vn−vcRc+vn−voRf+in=0.
Apply the voltage constraint from Step 2 and the current constraint in=0 to
the KCL equation, then solve for vo to get
Inverting Summing-Amplifier
Equation
vo=−(RfRava+RfRbvb+RfRcvc).(5.6)
Equation 5.6 shows that the output voltage is an inverted, scaled sum of the
three input voltages. According to Step 4, this equation is valid only if the
value of vo is between the two power supply voltages.
If Ra=Rb=Rc=Rs, then Eq. 5.6 reduces to
vo=−RfRs(va+vb+vc).
Finally, if we make Rf=Rs, the output voltage is just the inverted sum of the
input voltages. That is,
vo=−(va+vb+vc).
Although we analyzed the summing amplifier with three input signals, the
number of input voltages can be increased or decreased as needed. For
example, you might wish to sum 16 individually recorded audio signals to
form a single audio signal. The summing-amplifier configuration in Fig. 5.11
could include 16 different input resistors whose values specify different
amplification factors for each of the input audio tracks. The summing
amplifier thus plays the role of an audio mixer. As with inverting-amplifier

circuits, the scaling factors in summing-amplifier circuits are determined by
the external resistors Rf, Ra, Rb, Rc, …, Rn.
Example 5.3 uses the summing-amplifier equation to design an inverting
summing amplifier.
Example 5.3 Designing a Summing
Amplifier
1. Design a summing amplifier (see Fig. 5.11) whose output voltage is
vo=−4va−vb−5vc.
Use an ideal op amp with ±12 V power supplies and a 20 kΩ feedback
resistor.
2. Suppose va=2 V and vc=−1 V. What range of input voltages for vb
allows the op amp in this design to remain in its linear operating region?
3. Suppose va=2 V, vb=3 V, and vc=−1 V. Using the input resistor values
found in part (a), how large can the feedback resistor be before the op
amp saturates?
Solution
1. Use the summing-amplifier equation (Eq. 5.6) and the feedback resistor
value to find the three input resistor values:
−RfRa=−4soRa=20 k4=5 kΩ;−RfRb=−1soRb=20 k1=20 kΩ;−RfRc=
−5soRc=20 k5=4 kΩ.
The resulting circuit is shown in Fig. 5.12.

amplifier for Example 3.3(a).
Figure 5.12 Full Alternative Text
2. Substitute the values for va and vc into the equation for vo given in the
problem statement to get
vo=−4(2)−vb−5(−1)=−3−vb.
Solving this equation for vb in terms of vo gives
vb=−3−vo.
Now substitute the two power supply voltages for the output voltage to

find the range of vb values that keeps the op amp in its linear region:
−15 V≤vb≤9 V.
3. Starting with the summing-amplifier equation, Eq. 5.6, substitute the
input resistor values found in part (a) and the specified input voltage
values. Remember that the feedback resistor is an unknown in this
equation:
vo=−Rf5000(2)−Rf20,000(3)−Rf4000(−1)=−6Rf20,000.
From this equation, it should be clear that if the op amp saturates, it will
do so at its negative power supply value, −12 V. Using this voltage for
vo in the above equation and solving for the feedback resistance gives
Rf=40 kΩ.
Given the specified input voltages, this is the largest value of feedback
resistance that keeps the op amp in its linear region.

5.5 The Noninverting-Amplifier
Circuit
Figure 5.13 depicts a noninverting-amplifier circuit. We use Analysis Method
5.1 to find the expression for the output voltage as a function of the source
voltage vg. Starting with Step 1, we note that the noninverting-amplifier
circuit has a negative feedback path with the resistor Rf, so we assume that
the op amp is in its linear region. In Step 2, the voltage constraint equation
(Eq. 5.2) tells us that vn=vp. However, the voltage at the noninverting
terminal is not 0 because the terminal is not connected to the common node.
The current constraint equation (Eq. 5.3) tells us the noninverting input
current is zero. Since this current equals the current in the resistor Rs, there is
no voltage drop across Rs and vp=vg. Therefore, vn=vg as well.
Figure 5.13 A noninverting
amplifier.

In Step 3, we write a KCL equation at the noninverting terminal, using the
result of Step 2 and the current constraint equation to give
vgRs+vg−voRf=0.
Solve the KCL equation for vo to get
Noninverting-Amplifier Equation
vo=Rs+RfRsvg.(5.7)
From Step 4 we know that keeping the op amp in its linear region requires
that

Rs+RfRs<|VCCvg|.
Once again, the ideal op amp assumption allows us to express the output
voltage as a function of the input voltage and the external resistors Rs and Rf.
Example 5.4 illustrates the design of a noninverting amplifier using realistic
resistor values.

1. Design a noninverting amplifier (see Fig. 5.13) with a gain of 6. Assume
the op amp is ideal.
2. Suppose we wish to amplify a voltage vg, where −1.5 V ≤ vg ≤ + 1.5 V.
What are the smallest power supply voltages that could be used with the
resistors selected in part (a) to ensure that the op amp remains in its
linear region?
Solution
1. Using the noninverting-amplifier equation (Eq. 5.7),
vo=Rs+RfRsvg=6vg so Rs+Rf Rs =6.
Therefore,
Rs+Rf=6Rs,     so     Rf=5Rs.
Look at the realistic resistor values listed in Appendix H. Let’s
choose Rf=10 kΩ, so Rs=2 kΩ. But there is not a 2 kΩ resistor in
Appendix H. We can create an equivalent 2 kΩ resistor by combining
two 1 kΩ resistors in series. We can use a third 1 kΩ resistor for Rg. The
resulting circuit is shown in Fig. 5.14.

2. Solve two different versions of the noninverting-amplifier equation for
vo, first using vg=+1.5 V and then using vg=−1.5 V:
vo=6(1.5)=9 V;vo=6(−1.5)=−9 V.
Thus, if we use ±9 V power supplies for the noninverting amplifier
designed in part (a) and −1.5 V≤vg≤ +1.5 V, the op amp will remain in
its linear operating region. The circuit resulting from the analysis in

parts (a) and (b) is shown in Fig. 5.14, with V+=9 V and V−=−9 V.

5.6 The Difference-Amplifier
Circuit
The output voltage of a difference amplifier is proportional to the difference
between the two input voltages. To demonstrate, we analyze the difference-
amplifier circuit shown in Fig. 5.15, using Analysis Method 5.1. In Step 1,
we note the negative feedback path that includes the resistor Rb and thereby
assume the op amp is in its linear region. In Step 2, we use the voltage
constraint equation (Eq. 5.2) to recognize that vn=vp. Now we need an
expression for vp. Let’s focus on the subcircuit at the noninverting input;
employing the current constraint equation (Eq. 5.3), we note that there is no
current into the noninverting input. Therefore, the current in the vb source
remains in the loop containing that source and the resistors Rc and Rd. The
voltage at the noninverting terminal is the voltage across Rd, which we can
find using voltage division:
vp=RdRc+Rdvb=vn.
Figure 5.15 A difference
amplifier.

Figure 5.15 Full Alternative Text
At Step 3, write a KCL equation at the inverting terminal, employing the
current constraint equation again to see that the current into the inverting
terminal is zero:
vn−vaRa+vn−voRb=0.
Solving the KCL equation for vo as a function of both va and vn, we get
vo=(Ra+RbRa)vn−(RbRa)va.
Substituting the equation for vn into the equation for vo gives the desired
relationship:

Difference-Amplifier Equation
vo=Rd(Ra+Rb)Ra(Rc+Rd)vb−RbRava.(5.8)
Equation 5.8 shows that the output voltage is proportional to the difference
between a scaled replica of vb and a scaled replica of va. In general, the
scaling factor applied to vb is not the same as that applied to va. However,
the scaling factor applied to each input voltage can be made equal by setting
RaRb=RcRd. (5.9)
When Eq. 5.9 is satisfied, the expression for the output voltage reduces to
Simplified Difference-Amplifier
Equation
vo=RbRa(vb−va).(5.10)
If Eq. 5.9 is satisfied, the output voltage is a scaled replica of the difference
between the input voltages vb and va. As in the previous ideal amplifier
circuits, the scaling is controlled by the external resistors. Furthermore, the
relationship between the output voltage and the input voltages is not affected
by connecting a nonzero load resistance across the output of the amplifier.
Follow Example 5.5 to design a difference amplifier using realistic resistor
values.
Example 5.5 Designing a Difference

1. Design a difference amplifier (see Fig. 5.15) that amplifies the

difference between two input voltages by a gain of 8, using an ideal op
amp and ±8 V power supplies.
2. Suppose va=1 V in the difference amplifier designed in part (a). What
range of input voltages for vb will allow the op amp to remain in its
linear operating region?
Solution
1. Using the simplified difference-amplifier equation (Eq. 5.10),
vo=RbRa(vb−va)=8(vb−va)  so  Rb Ra =8.
We want two resistors whose ratio is 8. Look at the realistic resistor
values listed in Appendix H. Let’s choose Rb=12 kΩ, so Ra=1.5 kΩ,
although there are many other possibilities. Note that the simplified
difference-amplifier equation requires that
RaRb=Rc Rd.
A simple choice for Rc and Rd is Rc=Ra=1.5 kΩ and Rd=Rb=12 kΩ.
The resulting circuit is shown in Fig. 5.16.

2. Using va=1, solve two different versions of the simplified difference-
amplifier equation (Eq. 5.10) for vb in terms of vo. Then substitute the
two limiting values for the output voltage, vo=+8 V and vo=−8 V:
vb=vo8+1=88+1=2 V;vb=vo8+1=−88+1=0 V.
Thus, if va=1 V in the difference amplifier from part (a), the op amp will
remain in its linear region if 0 V≤vb≤+2 V.

The Difference Amplifier—Another
Perspective

Let’s examine the difference-amplifier behavior more closely by redefining
its inputs in terms of two other voltages. The first is the differential mode
input, which is the difference between the two input voltages in Fig. 5.15:
vdm=vb−va. (5.11)
The second is the common mode input, which is the average of the two input
voltages in Fig. 5.15:
vcm=(va+vb)/2. (5.12)
Using Eqs. 5.11 and 5.12, we can now represent the original input voltages,
va and vb, in terms of the differential mode and common mode voltages, vdm
and vcm:
va=vcm−12vdm, (5.13)
vb=vcm+12vdm. (5.14)
Substituting Eqs. 5.13 and 5.14 into Eq. 5.8 gives the output of the difference
amplifier in terms of the differential mode and common mode voltages:
vo=[ RaRd−RbRcRa(Rc+Rd) ]vcm+ [ Rd(Ra+Rb)+Rb(Rc+Rd)2Ra(Rc+Rd)
]vdm=Acmvcm+Admvdm,(5.15)
where Acm is the common mode gain and Adm is the differential mode gain.
Now, substitute Rc=Ra and Rd=Rb, which are possible values for Rc and Rd
that satisfy Eq. 5.9, into Eq. 5.15:
vo=(0)vcm+(RbRa)vdm. (5.16)
Thus, an ideal difference amplifier has Acm=0, amplifies only the differential
mode portion of the input voltage, and eliminates the common mode portion
of the input voltage. Figure 5.17 shows a difference-amplifier circuit with
differential mode and common mode input voltages in place of va and vb.

Equation 5.16 provides an important perspective on the function of the
difference amplifier. In many applications it is the differential mode signal
that contains the information of interest, while the common mode signal
represents the noise found in all electric signals. For example, an
electrocardiograph electrode measures the voltages produced by your body
that regulate your heartbeat. These voltages have very small magnitudes
compared with the electrical noise that the electrode picks up from lights and

other electrical equipment in the room. The noise appears as the common
mode portion of the measured voltage, whereas the heart rate voltages
comprise the differential mode portion. Thus, an ideal difference amplifier
(one whose resistors satisfy Eq. 5.9) amplifies only the voltage of interest and
suppresses the noise.
Measuring Difference-Amplifier
Performance—The Common Mode
Rejection Ratio
An ideal difference amplifier has zero common mode gain and nonzero (and
usually large) differential mode gain. Two factors influence the ideal
common mode gain—resistance mismatches (that is, Eq. 5.9 is not satisfied)
or a nonideal op amp (that is, Eqs. 5.2 and 5.3 are not satisfied). We focus
first on how resistance mismatches affect the performance of a difference
amplifier.
Suppose that resistor values are chosen that do not precisely satisfy Eq. 5.9.
Instead, the relationship among the resistors Ra, Rb, Rc, and Rd is
RaRb=(1−∈)RcRd,
so
Ra=(1−∈)Rc and Rb=Rd,
or
Rd=(1−∈)Rb and Ra=Rc, (5.17)
where ∈ is a very small number. We can see the effect of this resistance
mismatch on the common mode gain of the difference amplifier by
substituting Eq. 5.17 into Eq. 5.15 and simplifying the expression for Acm:
Acm=Ra(1−∈)Rb−RaRbRa[Ra+(1−∈)Rb]=−∈RbRa+(1−∈)Rb≈

−∈RbRa+Rb.(5.18)
The approximation in Eq. 5.18 is valid because ∈ is very small, and
therefore (1−∈) is approximately 1. Note that when the resistors in the
difference amplifier satisfy Eq. 5.9, ∈=0 and Eq. 5.18 gives Acm=0.
Now calculate the effect of the resistance mismatch on the differential mode
gain by substituting Eq. 5.17 into Eq. 5.15 and simplifying the expression for
Adm:
Adm=(1−∈)Rb(Ra+Rb)+Rb[Ra+(1−∈)Rb]2Ra[Ra+(1−∈)Rb]=RbRa[
1−(∈/2)RaRa+(1−∈)Rb ]≈RbRa[ 1−(∈/2)RaRa+Rb ].(5.19)
We use the same rationale for the approximation in Eq. 5.19 as in the
computation of Acm. When the resistors in the difference amplifier satisfy
Eq. 5.9, ∈=0 and Eq. 5.19 gives Adm=Rb/Ra.
The common mode rejection ratio (CMRR) measures a difference
amplifier’s performance. It is defined as the ratio of the differential mode
gain to the common mode gain:
CMRR=|AdmAcm|.(5.20)
The larger the CMRR, the closer the difference amplifier’s behavior is to
ideal. We can see the effect of resistance mismatch on the CMRR by
substituting Eqs. 5.18 and 5.19 into Eq. 5.20:
CMRR≈| RbRa[1−(Ra∈/2)/(Ra+Rb)]−∈Rb/(Ra+Rb) |≈| Ra(1−∈/2)+Rb
−∈Ra |≈| 1+Rb/Ra−∈ |.(5.21)
From Eq. 5.21, if the resistors in the difference amplifier are matched, ∈=0
and CMRR= ∞. Even if the resistors are mismatched, we can minimize the
impact of the mismatch by making the differential mode gain (Rb/Ra) very
large, thereby making the CMRR large.
The second reason for nonzero common mode gain is a nonideal op amp.
Remember that the op amp is itself a difference amplifier because in the
linear operating region, its output is proportional to the difference of its

inputs; that is, vo=A(vp−vn). The output of a nonideal op amp is not strictly
proportional to the difference between the inputs (the differential mode input)
but also includes a common mode signal. Internal mismatches in the
integrated circuit components make the behavior of the op amp nonideal, in
the same way that the resistor mismatches in the difference-amplifier circuit
make its behavior nonideal. Even though a discussion of nonideal op amps is
beyond the scope of this text, note that the CMRR is used to rate op amps in
practice by assessing how nearly ideal an op amp’s behavior is.
Example 5.6 examines how resistor mismatches affect the CMRR of a
difference amplifier.
Example 5.6 Calculating the CMRR
1. Suppose the Rc resistor in the difference amplifier designed in Example
5.5, shown in Fig. 5.16, is 10% larger than its nominal value. All other
resistor values are unchanged. Calculate the common mode gain, the
difference mode gain, and the CMRR for the difference amplifier.
2. Repeat part (a) assuming the Rd resistor value is 10% larger than its
nominal value and all other resistor values are unchanged.
Solution
1. Use the common mode gain equation in Eq. 5.15 with
Rc=1500(1.1)=1650 Ω to get
Acm=(1500)(12,000)−(12,000)(1650)1500(1650+12,000)=−0.0879.
Then use the difference mode gain equation in Eq. 5.15 with
Rc=1500(1.1)=1650 Ω to get
Adm=12,000(1500+12,000)+12,000(1650+12,000)2(1500)
(1650+12,000)=7.956.

The CMRR (Eq. 5.20) is thus
CMRR=|7.956−0.0879|=90.5.
2. Use the common mode gain equation in Eq. 5.15 with
Rd=12,000(1.1)=13,200 Ω to get
Acm=(1500)(13,200)−(12,000)(1500)1500(1500+13,200)=0.08163.
Then use the difference mode gain equation in Eq. 5.15 with
Rd=12,000(1.1)=13,200 Ω to get
Adm=13,200(1500+12,000)+12,000(1500+13,200)2(1500)
(1500+13,200)=8.0408.
The CMRR (Eq. 5.20) is thus
CMRR=|8.04080.08163|=98.5.

5.7 A More Realistic Model for the
Operational Amplifier
We now consider a more realistic model, shown in Fig. 5.18, that predicts the
performance of an op amp in its linear region of operation. This model
includes three modifications to the ideal op amp: (1) a finite input resistance,
Ri; (2) a finite open-loop gain, A; and (3) a nonzero output resistance, Ro.
Figure 5.18 An equivalent
circuit for an operational
amplifier.

Figure 5.18 Full Alternative Text
When using the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 5.18, the assumptions that
vn=vp (Eq. 5.2) and in=ip=0 (Eq. 5.3) are invalid. Equation 5.1 is also invalid
because the output resistance, Ro, is not zero.
Although the presence of A, Ri and Ro makes op amp circuit analysis more
cumbersome, it remains straightforward. To illustrate, we use the equivalent
circuit shown in Fig. 5.18 when analyzing both an inverting and a
noninverting amplifier. We begin with the inverting amplifier.

Analyzing an Inverting-Amplifier
Circuit Using a More Realistic Op
Amp Model
The circuit for the inverting amplifier, using the op amp circuit shown in Fig.
5.18, is depicted in Fig. 5.19. We can find the output voltage, vo, as a
function of the source voltage, vs, by writing two KCL equations at the nodes
labeled a and b in Fig. 5.19. Note that vp=0 due to the external short-circuit
connection at the noninverting input terminal. The equations are:
node a:vn−vsRs+vnRi+vn−voRf=0,node b:vo−vnRf+vo−A(−vn)Ro=0.
Figure 5.19 An inverting-
amplifier circuit.

Figure 5.19 Full Alternative Text
We rearrange the KCL equations, preparing to use either back-substitution or
Cramer’s method to solve for vo:
(1Rs+1Ri+1Rf)vn−1Rfvo=1Rsvs,(ARo−1Rf)vn+(1Rf+1Ro)vo=0.
Solving for vo yields

vo=−A+(Ro/Rf)RsRf(1+A+RoRi)+(RsRi+1)+RoRfvs. (5.22)
Note that Eq. 5.22 reduces to Eq. 5.4 as Ro→0, Ri→ ∞, and A→ ∞.
If the inverting amplifier shown in Fig. 5.19 has a load resistance, RL, at its
output terminal, the relationship between vo and vs is
vo=−A+(Ro/Rf)RsRf(1+A+RoRi+RoRL)+(1+RoRL)(1+RsRi)+RoRfvs.
Analyzing a Noninverting-Amplifier
Circuit Using a More Realistic Op
Amp Model
Using the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 5.18 to analyze a noninverting
amplifier, we obtain the circuit depicted in Fig. 5.20. Here, the voltage source
vg in series with the resistance Rg represents the signal source. The resistor
RL denotes the load on the amplifier. We derive an expression for vo as a
function of vg by writing KCL equations at nodes a and b:
node a:vnRs+vn−vgRg+Ri+vn−voRf=0, (5.23)
node b:vo−vnRf+voRL+vo−A(vp−vn)Ro=0. (5.24)
Figure 5.20 A noninverting-
amplifier circuit.

Figure 5.20 Full Alternative Text
The current in Rg is the same as in Ri, so
vp−vgRg=vn−vgRi+Rg. (5.25)
Use Eq. 5.25 to eliminate vp from Eq. 5.24, giving
vn(1Rs+1Rg+Ri+1Rf)−vo(1Rf)=vg(1Rg+Ri),vn[ ARiRo(Ri+Rg)−1Rf

]+vo(1Rf+1Ro+1RL)=vg[ ARiRo(Ri+Rg) ].
Solving for vo yields
vo=[(Rf+Rs)+(RsRo/ARi)]vgRs+RoA(1+Kr)+RfRs+(Rf+Rs)(Ri+Rg)ARi,
(5.26)
where
Kr=Rs+RgRi+Rf+RsRL+RfRs+RfRg+RgRsRiRL.
Note that Eq. 5.26 reduces to Eq. 5.7 when Ro→0, A→ ∞, and Ri→ ∞. For
the unloaded (RL=∞) noninverting amplifier, Kr reduces to (Rs+Rg)/Ri and
the expression for vo becomes
vo=[(Rf+Rs)+RsRo/ARi]vgRs+RoA(1+Rs+RgRi)+1ARi[RfRs+(Rf+Rs)
(Ri+Rg)].(5.27)
Example 5.7 analyzes a noninverting-amplifier circuit that employs the more
realistic op amp model.

Note how close this value is to the gain of 6 specified and achieved in
Example 5.5 using the ideal op amp model.
2. From part (a), when vg=1 V, vo=5.9988 V. Now use Eq. 5.23 to solve
for vn in terms of vo and vg:
vn(12 k+11 k+100 k+110 k)
=1100 k+1 k+5.998810 k;vn=0.999803 V.
Use Eq. 5.25 to solve for vp:
vpRg(vn−vg)Ri+Rg+vg=1 k(0.999803−1)100 k+1 k+1=0.999996 V.
3. Using the results from part (b), we find that the voltage difference at the
op amp input terminals is

vp−vn=192.895 μV.
While this voltage difference is very small, it is not zero, as we assume
when using the ideal op amp model.
4. The current in the signal source is the current in the resistor Rg. Using
Ohm’s law,
ig=vg−vpRg=1−0.9999961000=3.86 nA.

Practical Perspective
Strain Gages
Changes in the shape of elastic solids are of great importance to engineers
who design structures such as aircraft frames that twist, stretch, or bend when

subjected to external forces. To use strain gages, you need information about
the physical structure of the gage, methods of bonding the gage to the surface
of the structure, and the orientation of the gage relative to the forces exerted
on the structure. Strain gage measurements are important in many
engineering applications, and knowledge of electric circuits is germane to
their proper use.
The circuit shown in Fig. 5.22 provides one way to measure the change in
resistance experienced by strain gages in applications like the one in the
chapter opener. As we will see, this circuit is the familiar difference
amplifier, with the strain gage bridge providing the two voltages whose
difference is amplified. The pair of strain gages that are lengthened once the
bar is bent have the values R+ΔR in the bridge feeding the difference
amplifier, whereas the pair of strain gages that are shortened have the values
R−ΔR. We will analyze this circuit to discover the relationship between the
output voltage, vo and the change in resistance, ΔR experienced by the strain
gages.
Figure 5.22 An op amp circuit
used for measuring the change
in strain gage resistance.

Figure 5.22 Full Alternative Text
To begin, assume that the op amp is ideal. Writing the KCL equations at the
inverting and noninverting input terminals of the op amp, we see
vref−vnR + ΔR=vnR − ΔR+vn−voRf, (5.28)
vref− vpR − ΔR=vpR + ΔR+vpRf. (5.29)
Now rearrange Eq. 5.29 to get an expression for the voltage at the
noninverting terminal of the op amp:
vp=vref(R−ΔR)(1R+ΔR+1R−ΔR+1Rf). (5.30)
As usual, we will assume that the op amp is operating in its linear region, so
vp=vn, and the expression for vp in Eq. 5.30 must also be the expression for
vn. We can thus substitute the right-hand side of Eq. 5.30 for vn in Eq. 5.28

and solve for vo. After some algebraic manipulation,
vo=Rf(2ΔR)R2−(ΔR)2vref. (5.31)
Because the change in resistance experienced by strain gages is very small,
(ΔR)<<R2 so R2−(ΔR)2≈ R2 and Eq. 5.31 becomes
vo≈RfR2Δvref,
where Δ=ΔR/R. By adjusting the value of Rf, we can amplify the small
change in resistance to get a large, measurable output voltage, as long as the
output voltage value is between the two power supply values.

Summary
The operational amplifier (op amp) is a complex electronic circuit with
two input terminals, two power supply terminals and one output
terminal. The voltage at the inverting input terminal is vn, the voltage at
the noninverting input terminal is vp, and the voltage at the output
terminal is vo, all with respect to a common node. The current into the
inverting input terminal is in, while the current into the noninverting
input terminal is ip. (See page 152.)
The equation that defines the voltage transfer characteristic of an ideal
op amp is
vo={−VCC,A(vp−vn)<−VCC,A(vp−vn),−VCC≤A(vp
−vn)≤+VCC,+ VCC,A(vp−vn)>+VCC,
where A is a proportionality constant known as the open-loop gain, and
VCC represents the power supply voltages. (See page 153.)
A feedback path between an op amp’s output and its inverting input can
constrain the op amp to its linear operating region where vo=A(vp−vn).
(See page 153.)
A voltage constraint exists when the op amp is confined to its linear
operating region due to typical values of VCC and A. If the ideal
modeling assumptions are made—meaning A is assumed to be infinite
—the ideal op amp model is characterized by the voltage constraint
vp=vn.
(See page 153.)
A current constraint further characterizes the ideal op amp model,
assuming the ideal input resistance of the op amp integrated circuit is
infinite. This current constraint is given by

ip=in=0.
(See page 154.)
To analyze an ideal op amp circuit, follow these steps:
Check for the presence of a negative feedback path; if it exists, we
can assume the op amp is operating in its linear region.
Write a KCL equation at the inverting input terminal, using the
input current constraint (Eq. 5.3), the value of vn, and Ohm’s law
to find the currents. This equation will usually contain the unknown
voltage at the op amp’s output terminal.
Solve the KCL equation and determine the voltage at the op amp’s
output terminal.
Compare the voltage at the op amp’s output terminal to the power
supply voltages to determine whether the op amp is actually in its
linear region or whether it has saturated.
An inverting amplifier is an op amp circuit producing an output voltage
that is an inverted, scaled replica of the input. (See page 156.)
A summing amplifier is an op amp circuit producing an output voltage
that is a scaled sum of the input voltages. (See page 158.)
A noninverting amplifier is an op amp circuit producing an output
voltage that is a scaled replica of the input voltage. (See page 160.)
A difference amplifier is an op amp circuit producing an output voltage
that is a scaled replica of the input voltage difference. (See page 162.)
The two voltage inputs to a difference amplifier can be used to calculate
the common mode and difference mode voltage inputs, vcm and vdm.
The output from the difference amplifier can be written in the form
vo=Acmvcm+Admvdm,

where Acm is the common mode gain and Adm is the differential mode
gain. (See page 164.)
In an ideal difference amplifier, Acm=0. To measure how nearly ideal a
difference amplifier is, we use the common mode rejection ratio:
CMRR=|AdmAcm|.
An ideal difference amplifier has an infinite CMRR. (See page 166.)
We considered both a simple, ideal op amp model and a more realistic
model in this chapter. The differences between the two models are as
follows:

1. Know and be able to use the equations for voltage, current, power, and
energy in an inductor; understand how an inductor behaves in the
presence of constant current; and understand the requirement that the
current be continuous in an inductor.
2. Know and be able to use the equations for voltage, current, power, and
energy in a capacitor; understand how a capacitor behaves in the
presence of constant voltage; and understand the requirement that the
voltage be continuous in a capacitor.
3. Be able to combine inductors with initial conditions in series and in
parallel to form a single equivalent inductor with an initial condition; be
able to combine capacitors with initial conditions in series and in
parallel to form a single equivalent capacitor with an initial condition.
4. Understand the basic concept of mutual inductance and be able to write
mesh-current equations for a circuit containing magnetically coupled
coils using the dot convention correctly.
Here we introduce inductors and capacitors, the last two ideal circuit
elements mentioned in Chapter 2. Fortunately, the circuit analysis techniques
you learned in Chapters 3 and 4 apply to circuits containing inductors and
capacitors as well. Once you understand the terminal behavior of these
elements in terms of current and voltage, you can use Kirchhoff’s laws to
describe any interconnections with the other basic elements.
Like other components, inductors and capacitors are easier to describe in
terms of circuit variables rather than electromagnetic field variables. Hence,
Sections 6.1 and 6.2 briefly review the field concepts underlying inductors
and capacitors before focusing on the circuit descriptions. These sections also
examine energy in inductors and capacitors. Energy can be stored in both
magnetic and electric fields, so inductors and capacitors can store energy. For
example, energy can be stored in an inductor and then released to fire a spark

plug, or stored in a capacitor and then released to fire a strobe light. In ideal
inductors and capacitors, you can extract only as much energy as you have
stored. Because inductors and capacitors cannot generate energy, they are
classified as passive elements.
Section 6.3 describes circuit simplification using series and parallel
combinations of capacitors or inductors.
In Sections 6.4 and 6.5, we consider two circuits linked by a magnetic field
and thus magnetically coupled. The voltage induced in one circuit is related
to the time-varying current in the other circuit by a parameter known as
mutual inductance. The practical significance of magnetic coupling unfolds
as we study the relationships between current, voltage, power, and several
new parameters specific to mutual inductance. We introduce these
relationships here and then describe their utility in a device called a
transformer in Chapters 9 and 10.
Practical Perspective
Capacitive Touch Screens
The Practical Perspective in Chapter 3 used a grid of resistors to create a
touch screen for a phone or computer monitor. But resistive touch screens
have some limitations, the most important of which is that the screen can
only process a single touch at any instant in time (see Problem 3.75). This
means a resistive touch screen cannot process the “pinch” gesture used by
many devices to enlarge or shrink the image on the screen.
Multi-touch screens use a different component within a grid below the screen
—capacitors. When you touch a capacitive touch screen, the capacitor’s value
changes, causing a voltage change. Once you have learned the basic behavior
of capacitors and know how they combine in series and in parallel, we will
present two possible designs for a multi-touch screen using a grid of
capacitors.

6.1 The Inductor
An inductor is an electrical component that opposes any change in electrical
current. It is composed of a coil of wire wound around a supporting core
whose material can be magnetic or nonmagnetic. The behavior of inductors is
based on phenomena associated with magnetic fields. The source of the
magnetic field is charge in motion, or current. If the current is varying with
time, the magnetic field is varying with time. A time-varying magnetic field
induces a voltage in any conductor linked by the field. The circuit parameter
of inductance relates the induced voltage to the current.
Figure 6.1(a) shows an inductor, represented graphically as a coiled wire. Its
inductance is symbolized by the letter L and is measured in henrys (H).
Assigning the reference direction of the current in the direction of the voltage
drop across the terminals of the inductor, as shown in Fig. 6.1(b), and using
the passive sign convention yields
Figure 6.1 (a) The graphic
symbol for an inductor with an
inductance of L henrys. (b)
Assigning reference voltage and
current to the inductor,
following the passive sign
convention.

The Inductor v–i Equation
v=Ldidt,(6.1)
where v is measured in volts, L in henrys, i in amperes, and t in seconds. If
the current reference is in the direction of the voltage rise, Eq. 6.1 is written
with a minus sign.
Note from Eq. 6.1 that the voltage across the terminals of an inductor is
proportional to the time rate of change of the current in the inductor. We can
make two important observations here. First, if the current is constant, the
voltage across the ideal inductor is zero. Thus, the inductor behaves as a short
circuit in the presence of a constant, or dc, current. Second, current cannot
change instantaneously in an inductor; that is, the current cannot change by a
finite amount in zero time. Equation 6.1 tells us that this change would
require an infinite voltage, and infinite voltages are not possible. For
example, when someone opens the switch on an inductive circuit in an actual
system, the current initially continues to flow in the air across the switch, a

phenomenon called arcing. The arc across the switch prevents the current
from dropping to zero instantaneously.
Example 6.1 illustrates the application of Eq. 6.1 to a simple circuit.

7. Yes, at t=0. Note that the voltage can change instantaneously across the
terminals of an inductor, even though the current in the inductor cannot

Current in an Inductor in Terms of
the Voltage Across the Inductor
Equation 6.1 expresses the voltage across the terminals of an inductor as a
function of the current in the inductor. Now we express the current as a
function of the voltage. To find i as a function of v, start by multiplying both
sides of Eq. 6.1 by a differential time dt:
v dt=L(didt) dt.
Multiplying the rate at which i varies with t by a differential change in time
generates a differential change in i, so the expression simplifies to
v dt=L di.
We next integrate both sides of the simplified expression. For convenience,
we interchange the two sides of the equation and write
L ∫i(t0)i(t)dx=∫t0tv dτ.
Note that we use x and τ as the variables of integration, so i and t become
limits on the integrals. Then, divide both sides of the integral equation by L
and solve for the inductor current to get
The Inductor i–v Equation
i(t)=1L ∫t0tv dτ+i(t0),(6.2)
where i(t0) is the value of the inductor current at the time when we initiate
the integration, namely, t0. In many practical applications, t0 is zero and Eq.
6.2 becomes
i(t)=1L ∫0tv dτ+i(0).

Equations 6.1 and 6.2 both give the relationship between the voltage and
current at the terminals of an inductor. In both equations, the reference
direction for the current is in the direction of the voltage drop across the
terminals. Pay attention to the algebraic sign of i(t0). If the initial current
direction and the reference direction for i are the same, the initial current is
positive. If the initial current is in the opposite direction, it is negative.
Example 6.2 illustrates the application of Eq. 6.2.

In Example 6.2, i approaches a constant value of 2 A as t increases. We say
more about this result after discussing the energy stored in an inductor.
Power and Energy in the Inductor

The power and energy relationships for an inductor can be derived directly
from the current and voltage relationships. If the current reference is in the
direction of the voltage drop across the terminals of the inductor, the power is
p=vi.(6.3)
Remember that power is in watts, voltage is in volts, and current is in
amperes. If we express the inductor voltage as a function of the inductor
current, the expression for inductor power becomes
Power in an Inductor
p=Lididt.(6.4)
We can also express the current in terms of the voltage:
p=v[1L ∫t0tv dτ+i(t0)].
We can use Eq. 6.4 to find the energy stored in the inductor. Power is the
time rate of expending energy, so
p=dwdt=Lididt.
Multiplying both sides by a differential time gives the differential relationship
dw=Li di.
Integrate both sides of the differential relationship, recognizing that the
reference for zero energy corresponds to zero current in the inductor. Thus
∫0w dx=L ∫0iy dy,
so
Energy in an Inductor

w=12Li2.(6.5)
As before, we use different symbols of integration to avoid confusion with
the limits placed on the integrals. In Eq. 6.5, the energy is in joules,
inductance is in henrys, and current is in amperes. Example 6.3 applies Eqs.
6.3 and 6.5 to the circuits in Examples 6.1 and 6.2 to examine power and
energy in these circuits.
Example 6.3 Determining the
Current, Voltage, Power, and
Energy for an Inductor

vertically to allow easy assessment of each variable’s behavior.
2. In what time interval is energy being stored in the inductor?
3. In what time interval is energy being extracted from the inductor?
4. What is the maximum energy stored in the inductor?
5. Evaluate the integrals

and comment on their significance.
6. Repeat (a)–(c) for Example 6.2.
7. In Example 6.2, why is there a sustained current in the inductor as the
voltage approaches zero?
Solution

1. The plots of i and v follow directly from the expressions for i and v
obtained in Example 6.1. Applying Eq. 6.3,
p = vi = [ e −5t ( 1−5t ) ]( 10t e −5t ) = 10t e −10t ( 1−5t ) W.
Applying Eq. 6.5,
w=12Li=12(0.1)(10te−5t)2=5t2e−10t J.
The plots of i, v, p, and w are shown in Fig. 6.8.

p, and w versus t for
Example 6.1.

2. When the energy curve increases, energy is being stored. Thus, from
Fig. 6.8, energy is being stored in the time interval 0 to 0.2 s. This
corresponds to the interval when p>0.
3. When the energy curve decreases, energy is being extracted. Thus, from
Fig. 6.8, energy is being extracted in the time interval 0.2 s to ∞. This
corresponds to the interval when p<0.
4. Equation 6.5 tells us that energy is at a maximum when current is at a
maximum; the graphs in Fig. 6.8 confirm this. From Example 6.1,
imax=0.736 A. Therefore, wmax=27.07 mJ.
5. From part (a),
p=10te−10t(1−5t)=10te−10t=50t2e−10t.
Thus
∫ 0 0.2 p dt = 10 [ e −10t 100 ( −10t−1 ) ] 0 0.2 −50 { t 2 e −10t −10 +  2
10 [ e −10t 100 ( −10t−1 ) ] } 0 0.2 = 0.2 e −2 =27.07 mJ,
∫ 0.2 ∞ p dt = 10 [ e −10t 100 ( −10t−1 ) ] 0.2 ∞ − 50 { t 2 e −10t −10 + 2
10 [ e −10t 100 ( −10t−1 ) ] } 0.2 ∞ = −0.2 e −2 =−27.07 mJ.
Based on the definition of p, the area under the plot of p versus t
represents the energy expended over the interval of integration. Hence,
integrating the power between 0 and 0.2 s represents the energy stored in
the inductor during this time interval. Integrating p between 0.2 s and
infinity gives the energy extracted. Note that in this time interval, all the
energy originally stored is removed, so after the current peak, no energy
is stored in the inductor.
6. The plots of i, v, p, and w follow directly from the expressions for v and
i given in Example 6.2 and are shown in Fig. 6.9. Note that in this case
the power is always positive, and hence energy is always being stored
during the voltage pulse.

7. The inductor stores energy when the voltage pulse is applied. Because
the inductor is ideal, the energy cannot dissipate after the voltage
subsides to zero, and thus current continues to circulate in the circuit.

examine later in this text.

6.2 The Capacitor
A capacitor is an electrical component consisting of two conductors separated
by an insulator or dielectric material. The capacitor is the only device other
than a battery that can store electrical charge. The behavior of capacitors is
based on phenomena associated with electric fields. The source of the electric
field is separation of charge, or voltage. If the voltage is varying with time,
the electric field is varying with time. A time-varying electric field produces
a displacement current in the space occupied by the field. The circuit
parameter of capacitance relates the displacement current to the voltage,
where the displacement current is equal to the conduction current at the
terminals of the capacitor.
The circuit symbol for a capacitor is two short parallel conductive plates, as
shown in Fig. 6.10(a). The capacitance is represented by the letter C and is
measured in farads (F). Because the farad is an extremely large quantity of
capacitance, practical capacitor values usually lie in the picofarad (pF) to
microfarad (μF) range.
Figure 6.10 (a) The circuit
symbol for a capacitor. (b)
Assigning reference voltage and
current to the capacitor,
following the passive sign
convention.

The capacitor’s symbol reminds us that capacitance occurs whenever
electrical conductors are separated by a dielectric, or insulating, material.
This condition implies that electric charge is not transported through the
capacitor. Although applying a voltage to the terminals of the capacitor
cannot move a charge through the dielectric, it can displace a charge within
the dielectric. As the voltage varies with time, the displacement of charge
also varies with time, causing what is known as the displacement current.
The displacement current is indistinguishable from the conduction current at
the capacitor’s terminals. The current is proportional to the rate at which the
voltage across the capacitor varies with time, so
Capacitor i–v Equation
i=Cdvdt,(6.6)

where i is measured in amperes, C in farads, v in volts, and t in seconds. In
Fig. 6.10(b), the current reference is in the direction of the voltage drop
across the capacitor. Using the passive sign convention, we write Eq. 6.6 with
a positive sign. If the current reference is in the direction of the voltage rise,
Eq. 6.6 is written with a minus sign.
Two important observations follow from Eq. 6.6. First, if the voltage across
the terminals is constant, the capacitor current is zero because a conduction
current cannot be established in the dielectric material of the capacitor. Only
a time-varying voltage can produce a displacement current. Thus, a capacitor
behaves as an open circuit in the presence of a constant voltage. Second,
voltage cannot change instantaneously across the terminals of a capacitor.
Equation 6.6 indicates that such a change would produce infinite current, a
physical impossibility.
Equation 6.6 gives the capacitor current as a function of the capacitor voltage.
To express the voltage as a function of the current, we multiply both sides of
Eq. 6.6 by a differential time dt and then integrate the resulting differentials:
i dt=C dv  or ∫v(t0)v(t)dx=1C ∫t0ti dτ.
Carrying out the integration of the left-hand side of the second equation and
rearranging gives
Capacitor v–i Equation
v(t)=1C ∫t0ti dτ+v(t0).(6.7)
In many practical applications of Eq. 6.7, the initial time is zero; that is, t0=0.
Thus, Eq. 6.7 becomes
v(t)=1C ∫0t i dτ+v(0).
We can easily derive the power and energy relationships for the capacitor.
From the definition of power,

Capacitor Power Equation
p=vi=Cvdvdt,(6.8)
or
p=i[1C∫t0ti dτ+v(t0)].
Combining the definition of energy with Eq. 6.8 yields
dw=Cv dv,
from which
∫0wdx=C∫0vy dy,
or
Capacitor Energy Equation
w=12Cv2.(6.9)
In deriving Eq. 6.9, the reference for zero energy corresponds to zero voltage.
Examples 6.4 and 6.5 illustrate the current, voltage, power, and energy
relationships for a capacitor.
Example 6.4 Determining Current,
Voltage, Power, and Energy for a
Capacitor
The voltage pulse across the terminals of a 0.5 μF capacitor is:

v(t)={0,t≤0 s;4t V,0 s≤t≤1 s;4e−(t−1) V,t≥1 s.

2. Sketch the voltage, current, power, and energy as functions of time. Line
up the plots vertically.
3. Specify the time interval when energy is being stored in the capacitor.
4. Specify the time interval when energy is being delivered by the
capacitor.
5. Evaluate the integrals
∫01p dt and∫1∞p dt
and comment on their significance.
Solution
1. From Eq. 6.6,
i={(0.5 μ)(0)=0,t<0s;(0.5 μ )(4)=2 μA,0 s<t<1 s;(0.5 μ )(−4e−(t−1))=−2e
−(t−1)μA,t>1 s.
The expression for the power is derived from Eq. 6.8:

The energy expression follows directly from Eq. 6.9:

3. Energy is being stored in the capacitor whenever the power is positive.
Hence, energy is being stored in the interval from 0 to 1 s.
4. Energy is being delivered by the capacitor whenever the power is
negative. Thus, energy is being delivered for all t greater than 1 s.
5. The integral of p  dt is the energy associated with the time interval
corresponding to the integral’s limits. Thus, the first integral represents
the energy stored in the capacitor between 0 and 1 s, whereas the second
integral represents the energy returned, or delivered, by the capacitor in
the interval 1 s to ∞:
∫01p dt=∫018t dt=4t2|01=4 μJ,
∫1∞p dt=∫1∞(−8e−2(t−1))dt=(−8)e−2(t−1)−2|1∞=−4 μJ.
The voltage applied to the capacitor returns to zero as time increases, so
the energy returned by this ideal capacitor must equal the energy stored.

For 20 μs≤t≤40 μs,
v(20×10−6)=12.5×109(20×10−6)2=5 V.
Then,

For t≥40 μs,
v=10 V,p=vi=0,w=12Cv2=10 μJ.

3. Note that the power is always positive for the duration of the current
pulse, which means that energy is continuously being stored in the
capacitor. When the current returns to zero, the stored energy is trapped
because the ideal capacitor cannot dissipate energy. Thus, a voltage
remains on the capacitor after its current returns to zero.

6.3 Series-Parallel Combinations of
Inductance and Capacitance
Just as series-parallel combinations of resistors can be reduced to a single
equivalent resistor, series-parallel combinations of inductors or capacitors can
be reduced to a single inductor or capacitor.
Inductors in Series and Parallel
Figure 6.13 shows inductors in series. The series connection means the
inductors all have the same current, so we define only one current for the
series combination. The voltage drops across the individual inductors are
Figure 6.13 Inductors in series.
Figure 6.13 Full Alternative Text
v1=L1didt, v2=L2didt, and v3=L3didt.
The voltage across the series connection is
v=v1+v2+v3=(L1+L2+L3)didt.

Thus, the equivalent inductance of series-connected inductors is the sum of
the individual inductances. For n inductors in series,
Combining Inductors in Series
Leq=∑i=1nLi.(6.10)
If the original inductors carry an initial current of i(t0), the equivalent
inductor carries the same initial current. Figure 6.14 shows the equivalent
circuit for series inductors carrying an initial current.

Figure 6.14 Full Alternative Text
Inductors in parallel have the same terminal voltage, so the current in each
inductor is a function of the terminal voltage and the initial current in that
inductor. For the three inductors in parallel shown in Fig. 6.15, the currents
for the individual inductors are

The current entering the top node shared by the three parallel inductors is the
sum of the inductor currents:
i=i1+i2+ i3.
Substituting the expressions for i1, i2, and i3 into the sum yields
i=(1L1+1L2+1L3)∫t0tv dτ+i1(t0)+i2(t0)+i3(t0).(6.11)
The expression for the current as a function of the voltage for a single
equivalent inductor is
i=1Leq∫t0tv dτ + i(t0).(6.12)
Comparing Eq. 6.12 with Eq. 6.11 yields

Capacitors in Series and Parallel

Capacitors connected in series can be reduced to a single equivalent
capacitor. The reciprocal of the equivalent capacitance is equal to the sum of
the reciprocals of the individual capacitances. The initial voltage on the
equivalent capacitor is the algebraic sum of the initial voltages on the
individual capacitors. Figure 6.17 and the following equations summarize
these observations for n series-connected capacitors:

Now the 8 mH, 6 mH, and 10 mH inductors are in series. Combining
them gives
Leq=0.008+0.006+0.010=0.024=24 mH.
2. The initial current in the equivalent inductor, i, is the same as the current
entering the node to the left of the 24 mH inductor. The KCL equation at
that node, summing the currents entering the node, is

Therefore, the initial current in the equivalent inductor is i = 4 A.

Next, combine the 6 μF capacitor from the first simplification with the

Finally, combine the 20 μF from the previous simplification with the 20

Inductor and Capacitor Symmetry
We introduced the concept of symmetry, or duality, in Chapter 4. In that
chapter, we recognized several examples of duality, including
essential nodes and meshes;
KCL and KVL;
the node voltage method and the mesh current method.
There are also examples of duality in Sections 6.1 through 6.3; these are
summarized in Table 6.1. From this table we note many dual relationships,
including

Capacitor Duality

voltage and current;
open circuits and short circuits;
inductance and capacitance;
series connections and parallel connections.
Recognizing the symmetry in the characteristics of inductors and capacitors
makes it easier to understand and remember these characteristics.

6.4 Mutual Inductance
A time-varying current in an inductor coil creates a time-varying magnetic
field that surrounds that coil, as we saw in Section 6.1. Inductance relates the
voltage drop across an inductor to the time-varying current in that inductor.
As you will see, it makes sense to rename this parameter self-inductance.
Now we consider circuits containing two inductors with time-varying
currents, each creating a time-varying magnetic field. In these circuits, the
magnetic field generated by one coil’s current envelops the other coil and
vice versa, thereby magnetically coupling the two inductors and the circuits
that contain them. Figure 6.23 shows an example of such a circuit, where L1
and L2 are the self-inductances of the individual inductors and M is the
mutual inductance associated with the magnetic coupling. Note the double-
headed arrow adjacent to M; the arrows indicate the pair of coils with this
value of mutual inductance. We need this notation to accommodate circuits
with more than one pair of magnetically coupled coils.
Figure 6.23 Two magnetically
coupled coils.

Figure 6.23 Full Alternative Text
The mesh-current method is the easiest way to analyze circuits with
magnetically coupled inductors. Following Analysis Method 4.6 (page 110),
in Step 1 we identify the meshes, and in Step 2 we label the mesh currents.
The result is shown in Fig. 6.24. In Step 3, we write a KVL equation around
each mesh, summing the voltages across each mesh component. There will be
two voltages across each inductor coil because the coils are magnetically
coupled. One voltage is the self-induced voltage, which is the product of the
self-inductance of the coil and the first derivative of that coil’s current. The
other voltage is the mutually induced voltage, which is the product of the
mutual inductance of the coils and the first derivative of the current in the
other coil. Consider the inductor on the left in Fig. 6.24 with self-inductance
L1. The self-induced voltage across this coil is L1(di1/dt), and the mutually
induced voltage across this coil is M(di2/dt). But what about the polarities of
these two voltages?
Figure 6.24 Coil currents i1
and i2 used to describe the
circuit shown in Fig. 6.23.

The circuit on the left shows an inductor L1 on the right wire, a
resistor R1 on the top wire, and an independent voltage source, v
sub g, on the left wire. Mesh current in this circuit is indicated by a
clockwise pointing curved arrow, i1.
The circuit on the right shows an inductor L2 on the left wire and a
resistor R2 on the right wire. The mesh current in this circuit is
indicated by an anticlockwise pointing curved arrow, i2.
Mutual inductance of two coils is marked as M, with a double sided
arrow pointing to both inductors.
Using the passive sign convention, we find that the self-induced voltage is a
voltage drop in the direction of the current producing the voltage. But the
polarity of the mutually induced voltage depends on the way the inductor
coils are wound in relation to the reference direction of coil currents.
Showing the details of mutually coupled windings is very cumbersome.
Instead, we use the dot convention to determine the mutually induced
voltage polarities. A dot is placed on one terminal of each winding, as shown
in Fig. 6.25. These dots carry the sign information, so we can draw the
inductor coils schematically rather than showing how they wrap around a
core structure.
Figure 6.25 The circuit of Fig.
6.24 with dots added to the coils
indicating the polarity of the
mutually induced voltages.

Figure 6.25 Full Alternative Text
The dot convention can be summarized as follows:
Dot Convention for Magnetically Coupled Inductor Coils
When the reference direction for a current enters the dotted terminal of a coil,
the reference polarity of the voltage that it induces in the other coil is positive
at its dotted terminal.
Or, stated alternatively,
Alternate Dot Convention
When the reference direction for a current leaves the dotted terminal of a coil,
the reference polarity of the voltage that it induces in the other coil is
negative at its dotted terminal.
Usually, dot markings will be provided for you in the circuit diagrams in this
text, as they are in Fig. 6.25. Let’s use the dot convention to complete Step 3
in the mesh current method. Start with the mesh on the left in Fig. 6.25 and
sum the voltages around the mesh in the direction of the i1 mesh current to
get
−vg + i1R1 + L1di1dt−Mdi2dt=0,

The first three terms in the sum, including their signs, should be familiar to
you. Look at the fourth term: note that the i2 current enters the undotted
terminal of the L2 inductor and creates a mutually induced voltage across the
L1 inductor that is positive at its undotted terminal. This is a voltage rise with
respect to the direction of i1, so the sign of Mdi2/dt in the sum is negative.
Now consider the mesh on the right in Fig. 6.25, and sum the voltages around
the mesh in the direction of the i2 mesh current to get
i2R2+L2di2dt−Mdi1dt=0.
Look at the third term in the sum: the i1 current enters the dotted terminal of
the L1 inductor and creates a mutually induced voltage across the L2 inductor
that is positive at its dotted terminal. This is a voltage rise with respect to the
direction of i2, so the sign of Mdi1/dt in the sum is negative. Figure 6.26
shows the self- and mutually induced voltages across both inductor coils,
together with their polarity marks.

mutually induced voltages

two coils and the mode of each winding in a magnetically coupled circuit.

established by iD inside the coupled coils and label this field ϕD.
1 See discussion of Faraday’s law on page 203.
4. Arbitrarily pick one terminal of the second coil—say, terminal A—and
assign a current into this terminal, showing the current as iA.
5. Use the right-hand rule to determine the direction of the flux established
by iA inside the coupled coils and label this flux ϕA.
6. Compare the directions of the two fluxes ϕD and ϕA. If the fluxes have
the same reference direction, place a dot on the terminal of the second
coil where the test current (iA) enters. If the fluxes have different
reference directions, place a dot on the terminal of the second coil where
the test current leaves. In Fig. 6.27, the fluxes ϕD and ϕA have the same
reference direction, and therefore a dot goes on terminal A.
The second procedure determines the relative polarities of magnetically
coupled coils experimentally. This method is used when it is impossible to
determine how the coils are wound on the core. One experimental method is
to connect a dc voltage source, a resistor, a switch, and a dc voltmeter to the
pair of coils, as shown in Fig. 6.28. The shaded box covering the coils
implies that physical inspection of the coils is not possible. The resistor R
limits the magnitude of the current supplied by the dc voltage source.

the voltmeter’s positive terminal. If the deflection is downscale, place a dot
on the coil terminal connected to the voltmeter’s negative terminal.

i2=1−52e−5t+ 51e−4t A.
Solution
1. Follow the steps in Analysis Method 4.6. Steps 1 and 2 identify the
meshes and label the mesh currents, as shown in Fig. 6.29. In Step 3, we

write a KVL equation for each mesh where the current is unknown.
Summing the voltages around the i1 mesh yields
4di1dt+8ddt(ig − i2)+20(i1−i2)+5(i1−ig)=0.
Look carefully at the second term in this equation and make certain you
understand how the dot convention was used. Note that the voltage
across the 4 H coil due to the current (ig−i2), that is, 8d(ig− i2)/dt, is a
voltage drop in the direction of i1, so this term has a positive sign.
The KVL equation for the i2 mesh is
20(i2−i1)+ 60i2+16ddt(i2−ig)−8di1dt=0.
Look carefully at the fourth term in this equation and make certain you
understand how the dot convention was used. The voltage induced in the
16 H coil by the current i1, that is, 8di1/dt, is a voltage rise in the
direction of i2, so this term has a negative sign.
2. To check the validity of i1 and i2, we begin by testing the initial and
final values of i1 and i2. We know by hypothesis that i1(0)=i2(0)=0.
From the given solutions we have
i1(0)=4+64−68=0,
i2(0)=1−52+51=0.
Now we observe that as t approaches infinity, the source current (ig)
approaches a constant value of 16 A, and therefore the magnetically
coupled coils behave as short circuits. Hence, at t=∞ the circuit reduces
to that shown in Fig. 6.30. From Fig. 6.30 we see that at t=∞ the three
resistors are in parallel across the 16 A source. The equivalent resistance
is 3.75 Ω, and thus the voltage across the 16 A current source is 60 V.

These values agree with the final values predicted by the solutions for i1
and i2:
i1(∞)=4+64(0)−68(0)=4 A,
i2(∞)=1−52(0)+51(0)=1 A.
Finally, we check the solutions to see if they satisfy the differential
equations derived in (a). We will leave this final check to the reader via

6.5 A Closer Look at Mutual
Inductance
Here we take a closer look at self-inductance, and then we turn to a deeper
inspection of mutual inductance, examining the limitations and assumptions
made in Section 6.4.
A Review of Self-Inductance
Michael Faraday, who studied inductance in the early 1800s, envisioned a
magnetic field consisting of lines of force surrounding the current-carrying
conductor. Picture these lines of force as energy-storing elastic bands that
close on themselves. As the current increases and decreases, the elastic bands
(that is, the lines of force) spread and collapse about the conductor. The
voltage induced in the conductor is proportional to the number of lines that
collapse into, or cut, the conductor. This image of induced voltage is
expressed by Faraday’s law:
v=dλdt,(6.18)
where λ is the flux linkage, measured in weber-turns.
So, how is Faraday’s law related to inductance as defined in Section 6.1?
Let’s look at the coil depicted in Fig. 6.31. The lines threading the N turns,
labeled ϕ, represent the magnetic lines of force that make up the magnetic
field, which has a spatial orientation and a strength. Use the right-hand rule to
determine the spatial orientation: When the fingers of the right hand are
wrapped around the coil and point in the direction of the current, the thumb
points in the direction of that portion of the magnetic field inside the coil.
Figure 6.31 Representation of a

magnetic field linking an N-
turn coil.
Figure 6.31 Full Alternative Text
To determine the magnetic field strength, begin by defining flux linkage,
introduced in Faraday’s law (Eq. 6.18). The flux linkage is the product of the
magnetic field, ϕ, measured in webers (Wb), and the number of turns linked
by the field, N:
λ=Nϕ.
The magnitude of the flux, ϕ, is related to the magnitude of the coil current by
the relationship
φ=PNi
where N is the number of turns on the coil, and P is the permeance of the
space occupied by the flux. When the space containing the flux is made up of
magnetic materials (such as iron, nickel, and cobalt), the permeance varies
with the flux, giving a nonlinear relationship between ϕ and i. But when the

space containing the flux is composed of nonmagnetic materials, the
permeance is constant, giving a linear relationship between ϕ and i. Note that
the flux is also proportional to the number of turns on the coil.
Here, we assume that the core material—the space containing the flux—is
nonmagnetic. Then, substituting the expressions for flux (ϕ) and flux linkage
(λ) into Eq. 6.18 takes us from Faraday’s law to the inductor equation:
v = dλ dt = d(Nϕ) dt = N dϕ dt =N d dt (PNi) = N 2 P di dt =L di dt . (6.19)
The polarity of the induced voltage in the circuit in Fig. 6.31 depends on the
current creating the magnetic field. For example, when i is increasing, di/dt is
positive and v is positive, so energy is required to establish the magnetic
field. The product vi gives the rate at which energy is stored in the field.
When i is decreasing, di/dt is negative, v is negative, and the field collapses
about the coil, returning energy to the circuit.
Given this deeper look at self-inductance, we now reexamine mutual
inductance.
The Concept of Mutual Inductance
Figure 6.32 shows two magnetically coupled coils. Use the procedure
presented in Section 6.4 to verify that the dot markings on the two coils agree
with the direction of the coil windings and currents shown. The number of
turns on each coil are N1 and N2, respectively. Coil 1 is energized by a time-
varying current source that establishes the current i1 in the N1 turns. Coil 2 is
not energized and is open. The coils are wound on a nonmagnetic core. The
flux produced by the current i1 can be divided into two components, labeled
ϕ11 and ϕ21. The flux component ϕ11 is the flux produced by i1 that links
only the N1 turns. The component ϕ21 is the flux produced by i1 that links
both the N2 and N1 turns. The first digit in the flux subscript gives the coil
number, and the second digit refers to the coil current. Thus, ϕ11 is a flux
linking coil 1 and produced by a current in coil 1, whereas ϕ21 is a flux
linking coil 2 and produced by a current in coil 1.

Figure 6.32 Two magnetically
coupled coils.
Figure 6.32 Full Alternative Text
The total flux linking coil 1 is ϕ1, the sum of ϕ11 and ϕ21:
ϕ1=ϕ11+ϕ21.
The flux ϕ1 and its components ϕ11 and ϕ21 are related to the coil current i1
as follows:
ϕ1=P1N1i1,
ϕ11=P11N1i1,
ϕ21=P21N1i1,
where P1 is the permeance of the space occupied by the flux ϕ1, P11 is the
permeance of the space occupied by the flux ϕ11, and P21 is the permeance
of the space occupied by the flux ϕ21. Combining these four equations and
simplifying yields the relationship between the permeance of the space
occupied by the total flux ϕ1 and the permeances of the spaces occupied by

its components ϕ11 and ϕ21:
P1=P11+P21.(6.20)
We use Faraday’s law to derive expressions for v1 and v2:
v 1 = d λ 1 dt = d( N 1 ϕ 1 ) dt = N 1 d dt ( ϕ 11 + ϕ 21 ) = N 1 2 ( P 11 + P
21 ) d i 1 dt = N 1 2 P 1 d i 1 dt = L 1 d i 1 dt , (6.21)
and
v 2 = d λ 2 dt = d( N 2 ϕ 21 ) dt = N 2 d dt ( P 21 N 1 i 1 ) = N 2 N 1 P 21 d i
1 dt = M 21 d i 1 dt .
The coefficient of di1/dt in the equation for v1 is the self-inductance of coil 1.
The coefficient of di1/dt in the equation for v2 is the mutual inductance
between coils 1 and 2. Thus
M21=N2N1P21.(6.22)
The subscript on M specifies an inductance that relates the voltage induced in
coil 2 to the current in coil 1.
Figure 6.33 again shows two magnetically coupled coils, but now coil 2 is
energized by a time-varying current source (i2) and coil 1 is open. The total
flux linking coil 2 is
Figure 6.33 The magnetically
coupled coils of Fig. 6.32, with
coil 2 excited and coil 1 open.

Figure 6.33 Full Alternative Text
ϕ2=ϕ22+ ϕ12.
The flux ϕ2 and its components ϕ22 and ϕ12 are related to the coil current i2
as follows:
ϕ2=P2N2i2,
ϕ22=P22N2i2,
ϕ12=P12N2i2.
The voltages v2 and v1 are
v2=dλ2dt=N22P2di2dt=L2di2dt,v1=dλ1dt=ddt(N1ϕ12)=N1N2P12di2dt=M12
(6.23)
The coefficient of mutual inductance that relates the voltage induced in coil 1
to the time-varying current in coil 2 is
M12=N1N2P12.(6.24)
For nonmagnetic materials, the permeances P12 and P21 are equal, so from
Eqs. 6.22 and 6.24,
M12=M21=M.

Hence, for linear circuits with just two magnetically coupled coils, attaching
subscripts to the coefficient of mutual inductance is not necessary.
Mutual Inductance in Terms of Self-
Inductance
Here we derive the relationship between mutual inductance and self-
inductance. From Eqs. 6.21 and 6.23,
L1=N12P1,
L2=N22P2,
so
L1L2=N12N22P1P2.
Use Eq. 6.20 and the corresponding expression for P2 to write
L1L2=N12N22(P11+P21)(P22+P12).
But for a linear system, P21=P12, so the expression for L1L2 becomes
L1L2=(N1N2P12)2(1+P11P12)(1+P22P12)
=M2(1+P11P12) (1+P22P12).(6.25)
Now replace the two terms involving permeances by a single constant,
defined as
1k2=(1+P11P12) (1+P22P12).(6.26)
Substituting Eq. 6.26 into Eq. 6.25 and rearranging yields
M2=k2L1L2
or

Relating Self-Inductances and
Mutual Inductance
M=kL1L2,(6.27)
where the constant k is called the coefficient of coupling. From Eq. 6.26,
1k2≥1 so k≤1.
In fact, the coefficient of coupling must lie between 0 and 1, or
0≤k≤1.(6.28)
The coefficient of coupling is 0 when the two coils have no common flux;
that is, when ϕ12=ϕ21=0. This condition implies that P12=0, and Eq. 6.26
indicates that 1/k2= ∞, or k=0. If there is no flux linkage between the coils,
obviously M is 0.
The coefficient of coupling is equal to 1 when ϕ11 and ϕ22 are 0. This
condition implies that all the flux that links coil 1 also links coil 2, so
P11=P22=0, which represents an ideal state. In reality, winding two coils so
that they share precisely the same flux is physically impossible. Magnetic
materials (such as alloys of iron, cobalt, and nickel) create a space with high
permeance and are used to establish coefficients of coupling that approach
unity. (We say more about this important quality of magnetic materials in
Chapter 9.)
Energy Calculations
We conclude by calculating the total energy stored in magnetically coupled
coils. Along the way, we confirm two observations made earlier: For linear
magnetic coupling, (1) M12=M21=M, and (2) M=kL1L2, where 0≤k≤1.
Look at the circuit shown in Fig. 6.34. Initially, assume that the currents i1

and i2 are zero and that this zero-current state corresponds to zero energy
stored in the coils. Then let i1 increase from zero to some arbitrary value I1
and compute the energy stored when i1=I1. Because i2=0, the total power
input into the pair of coils is v1i1, and the energy stored is
Figure 6.34 The circuit used to
derive the basic energy
relationships.
Figure 6.34 Full Alternative Text
∫0W1dw=L1∫0I1i1di1,
W1=12L1I12.
Now we hold i1 constant at I1 and increase i2 from zero to some arbitrary
value I2. During this time interval, the voltage induced in coil 2 by i1 is zero
because I1 is constant. The voltage induced in coil 1 by i2 is M12di2/dt.
Therefore, the power input to the pair of coils is
p=I1M12di2dt+i2v2.
The total energy stored in the pair of coils when i2=I2 is
∫W1Wdw=∫0I2I1M12di2+∫0I2L2i2di2,

or
W=W1+I1I2M12+12L2I22,
=12L1I12+12L2I22+I1I2M12.(6.29)
If we reverse the procedure—that is, if we first increase i2 from zero to I2
and then increase i1 from zero to I1—the total energy stored is
W=12L1I12+12L2I22+I1I2M21.(6.30)
Equations 6.29 and 6.30 express the total energy stored in a pair of linearly
coupled coils as a function of the coil currents, the self-inductances, and the
mutual inductance. Note that the only difference between these equations is
the coefficient of the current product I1I2. We use Eq. 6.29 if i1 is established
first and Eq. 6.30 if i2 is established first.
When the coupling medium is linear, the total energy stored is the same
regardless of the order used to establish I1 and I2 because the resultant
magnetic flux depends only on the final values of i1 and i2, not on how the
currents reached their final values. If the resultant flux is the same, the stored
energy is the same. Therefore, for linear coupling, M12=M21. Also, because
I1 and I2 are arbitrary values of i1 and i2, respectively, we represent the coil
currents by their instantaneous values i1 and i2. Thus, at any instant of time,
the total energy stored in the coupled coils is
w(t)=12L1i12+12L2i22+Mi1i2.(6.31)
We derived Eq. 6.31 by assuming that both coil currents entered dotted
terminals. We leave it to you to verify that, if one current enters a dotted
terminal while the other leaves such a terminal, the algebraic sign of the term
Mi1i2 reverses. Thus, in general,
Energy Stored in Magnetically
Coupled Coils

w(t)=12L1i12+12L2i22±Mi1i2.(6.32)
We can use Eq. 6.32 to show that M cannot exceed L1L2. The magnetically
coupled coils are passive elements, so the total energy stored can never be
negative. If w(t) can never be negative, Eq. 6.32 indicates that
12L1i12+12L2i22−Mi1i2
when i1 and i2 are either both positive or both negative. The limiting value of
M occurs when
12L1i12+12L2i22−Mi1i2=0.(6.33)
To find the limiting value of M, we add and subtract the term i1i2L1L2 to the
left-hand side of Eq. 6.33. Doing so generates a term that is a perfect square:
(L12i1−L22i2)2+i1i2(L1L2−M)=0.(6.34)
The squared term in Eq. 6.34 can never be negative, but it can be zero.
Therefore, w(t)≥0 only if
L1L2≥ M,(6.35)
which is another way of saying that
M=kL1L2  (0≤k≤1).
We derived Eq. 6.35 by assuming that i1 and i2 are either both positive or
both negative. However, we get the same result if i1 and i2 have opposite
signs because in this case we obtain the limiting value of M by selecting the
plus sign in Eq. 6.32.
Work through Example 6.9 to practice calculating the coupling coefficient
and the stored energy for magnetically coupled coils.

2. Calculate the energy stored in the coupled coils when i1=10 A and
i2=15 A.
3. If the coupling coefficient is increased to 1 and i1=10 A, what value of
i2 results in zero stored energy?
Solution
1. k=ML1L2=0.04(0.025)(0.1)=0.8.
2. w=12(0.025)(10)2+12(0.1)(15)2+(0.04)(10)(15)=18.5 J.
3. When k=1, M=(0.025)(0.1)=0.05=50mH. The energy in the coils is now
12(0.025)(10)2+12(0.1)(i2)2+(0.05)(10)(i2)=0
so i2 must satisfy the quadratic equation
0.05i22 + 0.5i2 + 1.25 = 0.
Use the quadratic formula to find i2:
i2=−0.5±0.52−4(0.05)(1.25)2(0.05)=−5 A.
You should verify that the energy is zero for this value of i2, when k=1.

Practical Perspective
Capacitive Touch Screens
Capacitive touch screens are often used in applications where two or more
simultaneous touch points must be detected. We will discuss two designs for
a multi-touch screen. The first design employs a grid of electrodes, as shown
in Fig. 6.35. When energized, a small parasitic capacitance, Cp, exists
between each electrode strip and ground, as shown in Fig. 6.36(a). When the
screen is touched, say at position x, y on the screen, a second capacitance
exists due to the transfer of a small amount of charge from the screen to the
human body, which acts like a conductor. This introduces a second
capacitance at the point of touch with respect to ground, as shown in Fig.
6.36(b).
Figure 6.35 Multi-touch screen

with grid of electrodes.
Figure 6.35 Full Alternative Text
Figure 6.36 (a) Parasitic
capacitance between electrode
and ground with no touch; (b)
Additional capacitance
introduced by a touch.

Figure 6.36 Full Alternative Text
A touch-screen controller is continually monitoring the capacitance between
the electrodes in the grid and ground. If the screen is untouched, the
capacitance between every electrode in the x-grid and ground is Cp; the same
is true for the capacitance between every electrode in the y-grid and ground.

When the screen is touched at a single point, Ct and Cp combine in parallel.
The equivalent capacitance between the x-grid electrode closest to the touch
point and ground is now
Ctx=Ct+Cp.
Likewise, the equivalent capacitance between the y-grid electrode closest to
the touch point and ground is now
Cty=Ct+Cp.
Thus, a screen touch increases the capacitance between the electrodes and
ground for the x- and y-grid electrodes closest to the touch point.
What happens when there are two simultaneous points where the screen is
touched? Assume that the first touch point has coordinates x1, y1 and the
second touch point has coordinates x2, y2. Now there are four screen
locations that correspond to an increase in capacitance: x1, y1; x1, y2; x2, y1;
and x2, y2. Two of those screen locations match the two touch points, and the
other two points are called “ghost” points because the screen was not touched
at those points. Therefore, this method for implementing a capacitive touch
screen cannot accurately identify more than a single touch point.
Most modern capacitive touch screens do not use the “self-capacitance”
design. Instead of measuring the capacitance between each x-grid electrode
and ground, and each y-grid electrode and ground, the capacitance between
each x-grid electrode and each y-grid electrode is measured. This capacitance
is known as “mutual” capacitance and is shown in Fig. 6.37(a).

capacitance between an x-grid
and a y-grid electrode; (b)

Figure 6.37 Full Alternative Text
When the screen is touched, say at position x, y on the screen, a second
capacitance again exists due to the transfer of a small amount of charge from
the screen to the human body. The second capacitance exists at the point of
touch with respect to ground, as shown in Fig. 6.37(b). Therefore, whenever
there is a change in the mutual capacitance, Cmxy, the screen touch point can
be uniquely identified as x, y. If the screen is touched at the points x1, y1 and
x2, y2 then precisely two mutual capacitances change: Cmx1y1 and Cmx2y2.
There are no “ghost” points identified, as there were in the self-capacitance
design. The mutual capacitance design produces a multi-touch screen capable
of identifying two or more touch points uniquely and accurately.

Summary
Inductance is a linear circuit parameter that relates the voltage induced
by a time-varying magnetic field to the current producing the field. (See
page 184.)
Capacitance is a linear circuit parameter that relates the current induced
by a time-varying electric field to the voltage producing the field. (See
page 189.)
Inductors and capacitors are passive elements; they can store and release
energy, but they cannot generate or dissipate energy. (See page 182.)
The instantaneous power at the terminals of an inductor or capacitor can
be positive or negative, depending on whether energy is being delivered
to or extracted from the element.
An inductor:
does not permit an instantaneous change in its terminal current,
does permit an instantaneous change in its teminal voltage, and
behaves as a short circuit in the presence of a constant terminal
current. (See page 184.)
A capacitor:
does not permit an instantaneous change in its terminal voltage,
does permit an instantaneous change in its terminal current, and
behaves as an open circuit in the presence of a constant terminal
voltage. (See page 190.)
Equations for voltage, current, power, and energy in ideal inductors and

capacitors are given in Table 6.1. (See page 198.)
Inductors in series or in parallel can be replaced by an equivalent
inductor. Capacitors in series or in parallel can be replaced by an
equivalent capacitor. The equations are summarized in Table 6.1. The
table includes the initial conditions for series and parallel equivalent
circuits involving inductors and capacitors.
Mutual inductance, M, is the circuit parameter relating the voltage
induced in one circuit to a time-varying current in another circuit.
Specifically,
v1=L1di1dt+ M12di2dt
v2=M21di1dt+L2di2dt,
where v1 and i1 are the voltage and current in circuit 1, and v2 and i2
are the voltage and current in circuit 2. For coils wound on nonmagnetic
cores, M12=M21=M. (See page 199.)
The dot convention establishes the polarity of mutually induced
voltages:
When the reference direction for a current enters the dotted terminal of a
coil, the reference polarity of the voltage that the current induces in the
other coil is positive at its dotted terminal.
Or, alternatively,
When the reference direction for a current leaves the dotted terminal of a
coil, the reference polarity of the voltage that the current induces in the
other coil is negative at its dotted terminal.
(See page 199.)
The relationship between the self-inductance of each winding and the
mutual inductance between windings is
M=kL1L2.

The coefficient of coupling, k, is a measure of the degree of magnetic
coupling. By definition, 0≤k≤1. (See page 206.)
The energy stored in magnetically coupled coils in a linear medium is
related to the coil currents and inductances by the relationship
w=12L1i12+12L2i22± Mi1i2.

sense in terms of the known behavior of the circuit they purport to
describe?” With these thoughts in mind, test the expressions of Example

1. 6.51 PRACTICAL PERSPECTIVE _ Suppose a capacitive touch screen
that uses the mutual-capacitance design, as shown in Fig. 6.37, is
touched at the point x, y. Determine the mutual capacitance at that point,
C′mxy, in terms of the mutual capacitance at the point without a touch,
Cmxy, and the capacitance introduced by the touch, Ct.
2. 6.52

PRACTICAL PERSPECTIVE _
1. Assume the parasitic capacitance in the self-capacitance design,
Cp=30 pF, and the capacitance introduced by a touch is 15 pF (see
Fig. 6.36[b]). What is the capacitance at the touch point with
respect to ground for the x-grid and y-grid electrodes closest to the
touch point?
2. Assume the mutual capacitance in the mutual- capacitance design,
Cmxy=30 pF, and the capacitance introduced by a touch is 15 pF
(see Fig. 6.37[b]). What is the mutual capacitance between the x-
and y-grid electrodes closest to the touch point?
3. Compare your results in parts (a) and (b)—does touching the screen
increase or decrease the capacitance in these two different
capacitive touch screen designs?
3. 6.53
PRACTICAL PERSPECTIVE _
1. As shown in the Practical Perspective, the self-capacitance design
does not permit a true multi-touch screen—if the screen is touched
at two difference points, a total of four touch points are identified,
the two actual touch points and two ghost points. If a self-
capacitance touch screen is touched at the x, y coordinates (2.1,
4.3) and (3.2, 2.5), what are the four touch locations that will be
identified? (Assume the touch coordinates are measured in inches
from the upper left corner of the screen.)
2. A self-capacitance touch screen can still function as a multi-touch
screen for several common gestures. For example, suppose at time
t1 the two touch points are those identified in part (a), and at time
t2 four touch points associated with the x, y coordinates (1.8, 4.9)
and (3.9, 1.8) are identified. Comparing the four points at t1 with
the four points at t2, software can recognize a pinch gesture—
should the screen be zoomed in or zoomed out?

3. Repeat part (b), assuming that at time t2 four touch points
associated with the x, y coordinates (2.8, 3.9) and (3.0, 2.8) are
identified.

2. Be able to determine the step response of both RL and RC circuits.
3. Know how to analyze circuits with sequential switching.
4. Be able to analyze op amp circuits containing resistors and a single
capacitor.
In this chapter, we focus on circuits that consist only of sources, resistors, and
either (but not both) inductors or capacitors. We call these circuits RL
(resistor-inductor) and RC (resistor-capacitor) circuits. In Chapter 6, we saw
that inductors and capacitors can store energy. We analyze RL and RC
circuits to determine the currents and voltages that arise when energy is either
released or acquired by an inductor or capacitor in response to an abrupt
change in a dc voltage or current source.
We divide our analysis of RL and RC circuits into three phases.
First Phase: Find the currents and voltages that arise when stored energy
in an inductor or capacitor is suddenly released to a resistive network.
This happens when the inductor or capacitor is abruptly disconnected
from its dc source. Thus, we can reduce the circuit to one of the two
equivalent forms shown in Fig. 7.1 on page 222. These currents and
voltages characterize the natural response of the circuit because the
nature of the circuit itself, not external sources of excitation, determines
its behavior.

the circuits for natural

response. (a) RL circuit. (b)
RC circuit.
 
Second Phase: Find the currents and voltages that arise when energy is
being acquired by an inductor or capacitor when a dc voltage or current
source is suddenly applied. This response is called the step response.
Third Phase: Develop a general method for finding the response of RL
and RC circuits to any abrupt change in a dc voltage or current source. A
general method exists because the process for finding both the natural
and step responses is the same.

Figure 7.2 (page 222) shows the four general configurations of RL and RC
circuits. Note that when there are no independent sources in the circuit, the
Thévenin voltage or Norton current is zero, and the circuit reduces to one of
those shown in Fig. 7.1; that is, we have a natural-response problem.

RL and RC circuits are also known as first-order circuits because their
voltages and currents are described by first-order differential equations. No
matter how complex a circuit may appear, if it can be reduced to a Thévenin

or Norton equivalent connected to the terminals of an equivalent inductor or
capacitor, it is a first-order circuit. If the original circuit has two or more
inductors or capacitors, they must be interconnected so that they can be
replaced by a single equivalent element.
Practical Perspective
Artificial Pacemaker
The muscle that makes up the heart contracts due to rhythmical electrical
impulses. Pacemaker cells control the impulse frequency. In adults, the
pacemaker cells establish a resting heart rate of about 72 beats per minutes.
Sometimes, however, damaged pacemaker cells produce a very low resting
heart rate (a condition known as bradycardia) or a very high resting heart rate
(a condition known as tachycardia). When either happens, a normal heart
rhythm can be restored by implanting an artificial pacemaker that mimics the
pacemaker cells by delivering electrical impulses to the heart. Examples of
internal and external artificial pacemakers are shown in the figures below.
Artificial pacemakers are very small and lightweight. They have a
programmable microprocessor that adjusts the heart rate based on several
parameters, an efficient battery with a life of up to 15 years, and a circuit that
generates the pulse. The simplest circuit consists of a resistor and a capacitor.
After we introduce and study the RC circuit, we will look at an RC circuit
design for an artificial pacemaker.

After introducing the techniques for analyzing the natural and step responses
of first-order circuits, we will discuss three special cases:
Sequential switching (circuits in which switching occurs at two or more
instants in time);
Circuits with an unbounded response;
The integrating amplifier circuit (containing an ideal op amp).

7.1 The Natural Response of an RL
Circuit
We can describe the natural response of an RL circuit using the circuit shown
in Fig. 7.3. We assume that the independent current source generates a
constant current Is and that the switch has been in a closed position for a long
time. We define the phrase a long time more accurately later in this section.
For now it means that all currents and voltages have reached a constant value.
Thus only constant, or dc, currents exist in the circuit just before the switch
opens, and the voltage across the inductor is zero (Ldi/dt=0). Therefore,
before the stored energy is released,
Figure 7.3 An RL circuit.
Figure 7.3 Full Alternative Text
The inductor behaves like a short circuit;
The entire source current Is appears in the inductive branch; and

There is no current in either R0 or R.
To find the natural response, we find the voltage and current at the terminals
of the resistor R after the switch has been opened—that is, after the source
and its parallel resistor R0 have been disconnected and the inductor begins
releasing energy. If we let t=0 denote the instant when the switch is opened,
we find v(t) and i(t) for t≥0. For t≥0, the circuit shown in Fig. 7.3 reduces to
the one shown in Fig. 7.4.
Figure 7.4 The circuit shown in
Fig. 7.3, for t≥0.
Figure 7.4 Full Alternative Text
Deriving the Expression for the
Current
To find i(t), we write an expression involving i, R, and L for the circuit in
Fig. 7.4 using Kirchhoff’s voltage law. Summing the voltages around the
closed loop gives
Ldidt+Ri=0,(7.1)

where we used the passive sign convention. Equation 7.1 is a first-order
ordinary differential equation because it involves the ordinary derivative of
the unknown, di/dt, and the highest order derivative appearing in the equation
is 1.
We can go one step further in describing this equation. The coefficients in the
equation, R and L, are constants; that is, they are not functions of either the
dependent variable i or the independent variable t. Thus, the equation can
also be described as an ordinary differential equation with constant
coefficients.
To solve Eq. 7.1, we divide by L, move the term involving i to the right-hand
side, and then multiply both sides by a differential time dt. The result is
didtdt=−RLi dt.
Next, we recognize the left-hand side of this equation simplifies to a
differential change in the current i, that is, di. We now divide through by i,
getting
dii=−RLdt.
We obtain an explicit expression for i as a function of t by integrating both
sides. Using x and y as variables of integration yields
∫i(t0)i(t)dxx=−RL∫t0tdy,
where i(t0) is the current at time t0 and i(t) is the current at time t. Here, t0=0.
Therefore, carrying out the indicated integration gives
lni(t)i(0)=−RLt.
Based on the definition of the natural logarithm, we can solve for the current
to get
i(t)=i(0)e−(R/L)t.
Recall from Chapter 6 that the inductor current cannot change
instantaneously. Therefore, in the first instant after the switch has been

opened, the current in the inductor remains unchanged. If 0− is the time just
prior to switching and 0+ is the time immediately following switching, then
Initial Inductor Current
i(0−)=i(0+)=I0.(7.2)
I0 is the inductor’s initial current, as in Fig. 7.1(a), and has the same direction
as the reference direction of i. Hence, the equation for the current becomes
i(t)=I0e−(R/L)t,   t≥0.
Figure 7.5 shows this response, where the current has an initial value I0 and
decreases exponentially toward zero as t increases.
Figure 7.5 The current
response for the circuit shown
in Fig. 7.4.

Figure 7.5 Full Alternative Text
Note that the expression for i(t) includes the term e−(R/L)t. The coefficient of
t—namely, R/L—determines the rate at which the current approaches zero.
The reciprocal of this coefficient is the time constant of the circuit, denoted
Time Constant for RL Circuit
τ=LR.(7.3)
Using the time constant, we write the expression for current as
Natural Response of an RL Circuit
i(t)=I0e−t/τ,   t≥0,(7.4)
Now we have a step-by-step method for finding the natural response of an RL
circuit.

1. Step 1: Determine the initial current, I0, in the inductor. This usually
involves analyzing the circuit for t<0.
2. Step 2: Calculate the time constant, τ. To do this, you need to find the
equivalent resistance attached to the inductor for t≥0.
3. Step 3: Write the equation for the inductor current for t≥0 by substituting
the values for the initial current and the time constant into Eq. 7.4.
4. Step 4: Calculate any other quantities of interest, such as resistor current
and voltage, using resistive circuit analysis techniques.
This method is summarized in Analysis Method 7.1 and is illustrated in
Example 7.1.

1.  
1. Step 1: To determine the initial current in the inductor, draw the

circuit in Fig. 7.6 for t<0. The switch has been closed for a long
time prior to t=0, so we know the inductor voltage is zero at t=0–
and the inductor can be replaced by a short circuit. The result is
shown in Fig. 7.7. The short circuit shunts all of the resistors, so it
has all of the current from the source. Therefore, the current in the
inductor at t=0– is 20 A and
Figure 7.7 The circuit for
Example 7.1 when t<0.

I0=iL(0−)=iL(0+)=20A.
2. Step 2: To calculate the time constant, τ, we need to find the
equivalent resistance attached to the inductor when t≥0. To do this,
draw the circuit in Fig. 7.6 for t≥0. Since the switch is now open,
the current source and its parallel resistor are removed from the
circuit, as shown in Fig. 7.8. From this circuit you can see that the
equivalent resistance attached to the inductor is
Figure 7.8 The circuit for

Example 7.1 when t≥0.

and the time constant of the circuit is
τ=LReq=210=0.2s.
3. Step 3: Write the equation for the inductor current by substituting
the values for the initial current and the time constant into Eq. 7.4
to give
iL(t)=I0e−t/τ=20e−t/0.2=20e−5tA,   t≥0.
4. Step 4: We use resistive circuit analysis in the remaining parts of
this problem to find additional currents and voltages.
2. We find the current in the 40 Ω resistor in Fig. 7.8 using current
division; that is,
io=−iL1010+ 40.

Note that this expression is valid for t≥0+ because io=0 at t=0–, so the
resistor current io changes instantaneously. Thus,
io(t)=−0.25iL(t)=−4e−5tA,   t≥0+.
3. We find the voltage vo in Fig. 7.8 by applying Ohm’s law:
vo(t)=40io=−160e−5t V,   t≥0+.
4. The power dissipated in the 10 Ω resistor in Fig. 7.8 is
p10Ω(t)=vo210=2560e−10t W,   t≥0+.
The total energy dissipated in the 10 Ω resistor is
w10Ω(t)=∫0∞2560e−10t dt=256 J.
The initial energy stored in the 2 H inductor is
w(0)=12LiL2(0)=12(2)(20)2=400 J.
Therefore, the percentage of energy dissipated in the 10 Ω resistor is
256400(100)=64%.

Deriving the Expressions for
Voltage, Power, and Energy
We derive the voltage across the resistor in Fig. 7.4 using Ohm’s law:
v=iR=I0R e−t/τ,   t≥0+.(7.5)
Note that while the current is defined for t≥0 (Eq. 7.4), the voltage is defined
only for t≥0+, not at t=0. At t=0 a step change occurs in the voltage. For t<0,

the derivative of the current is zero, so the voltage is also zero (v=Ldi/dt=0).
Thus
v(0−)=0,v(0+)=I0R,
where v(0+) is obtained from Eq. 7.5 with t=0+1.1. The value of the voltage
at t=0 is undefined owing to the step change at t=0. Thus, we use t≥0+ when
defining the region of validity for the voltage in Eq. 7.5.
1We can define the expressions 0− and 0+ more formally. The expression
x(0−) refers to the limit of the variable x as t→0 from the left, or from
negative time. The expression x(0+) refers to the limit of the variable x as
t→0 from the right, or from positive time.
We derive the power dissipated in the resistor from any of the following
expressions:
p=vi,   p=i2R,   or   p=v2R.
Whichever form is used, the resulting expression can be reduced to
p=I02R e−2t/τ,   t≥0+.
The energy delivered to the resistor during any interval of time after the
switch has been opened is
w=∫0tpdx=∫0tI02Re−2x/τdx=τ2I02R(1−e−2t/τ)=L2RI02R(1−e−2t/
τ)=12LI02(1−e−2t/τ),t≥0+.
Note from the energy equation that as t becomes infinite, the energy
dissipated in the resistor approaches the initial energy stored in the inductor.
The Significance of the Time
Constant
The time constant is an important parameter for first-order circuits. You can

express the time elapsed after switching as an integer multiple of τ. For
example, one time constant after the inductor begins releasing its stored
energy to the resistor, the current has been reduced to e−1, or approximately
0.37 of its initial value.
Table 7.1 gives the value of e−t/τ for integer multiples of τ from 1 to 10. Note
that the current is less than 1% of its initial value when the elapsed time
exceeds five time constants. So, five time constants after switching has
occurred, the currents and voltages have essentially reached their final values.
After switching, the changes to the currents and voltages are momentary
events and represent the transient response of the circuit.
Table 7.1 Value of e−t/τ For t
Equal to Integral Multiples of τ

Table 7.1 Full Alternative Text
By contrast, the phrase a long time implies that five or more time constants
have elapsed, for first-order circuits. The response that exists a long time after
switching is called the steady-state response. The phrase a long time then
also means the time it takes the circuit to reach its steady-state value.
The time constant also represents the time required for the current to reach its
final value if the current continues to change at its initial rate. To illustrate,
we evaluate di/dt at 0+ and assume that the current continues to change at this
rate:
didt(0+)=−I0τe−0+/τ=−I0τ.
Now, if i starts at I0 and decreases at a constant rate of I0/τ amperes per
second, the expression for i becomes

i=I0− I0τt.
This expression indicates that i would reach its final value of zero in τ
seconds. Figure 7.9 shows how this graphic interpretation can be used to
estimate a circuit’s time constant from a plot of its natural response. Such a
plot could be generated on an oscilloscope measuring output current.
Drawing the tangent to the natural-response plot at t=0 and reading the value
at which the tangent intersects the time axis gives the value of τ. This allows
you to determine the time constant of a circuit even if you don’t know its
component values.

Up to this point, we have dealt with circuits having a single inductor. But the
techniques presented apply to circuits with multiple inductors if the inductors
can be combined into a single equivalent inductor. Example 7.2 finds the
natural response of an RL circuit that contains two inductors.

Solution
1. The key to finding currents i1, i2, and i3 lies in knowing the voltage v(t).
We can easily find v(t) if we simplify the circuit shown in Fig. 7.10 to
the equivalent form shown in Fig. 7.11. The parallel inductors combine
to give an equivalent inductance of 4 H, carrying an initial current of 12
A. The resistive network reduces to a single resistance of 40 || [4+

(15 || 10)]=8 Ω. We can now use Analysis Method 7.1.

7.10.
Figure 7.11 Full Alternative Text
1. Step 1: The initial current in the inductor in Fig. 7.11 is I0=12 A.
2. Step 2: The equivalent resistance attached to the inductor in Fig.
7.11 is 8 Ω. Therefore, the time constant is
τ=LR=48=0.5 s.
3. Step 3: The inductor current in Fig. 7.11 is
i(t)=I0e−t/τ=12e−t/0.5=12e−2tA,   t≥0.
4. Step 4: We will use additional circuit analysis techniques to find
the currents i1, i2, and i3. To begin, note that in Fig. 7.11,
v(t)=8i(t), so
v(t)=96e−2t V,   t≥0+.

From the circuit in Fig. 7.10, we see that that v(t)=0 at t=0−, so the
expression for v(t) is valid for t≥0+. After obtaining v(t), we can
calculate i1 and i2 using the relationship between current and
voltage in inductors:
i1=15∫0t96e−2x dx−8=1.6−9.6e−2t A,t≥0,i2=120∫0t96e−2x dx− 4=
−1.6−2.4e−2t A,t≥0.
We will use two steps to find i3; in the first step, calculate the
voltage across the parallel 15 Ω and 10 Ω resistors using voltage
division. Calling that voltage v15||10, positive at the top of the
circuit, we get
v15||10=15||104+15||10v=610(96e−2t)=57.6e−2tV,   t≥0+.
Now use Ohm’s law to calculate i3, giving
i3=v15||1010=5.76e−2tA,   t≥0.+
Note that the expressions for the inductor currents i1 and i2 are
valid for t≥0, whereas the expression for the resistor current i3 is
valid for t≥0+.
2. The initial energy stored in the inductors is
w=12(5)(8)2+12(20)(4)2=320J.
3. As t → ∞, i1 → 1.6A and i2 → −1.6 A. Therefore, a long time after the
switch opens, the energy stored in the two inductors is
w=12(5)(1.6)2+ 12(20)(−1.6)2=32 J.
4. We obtain the total energy delivered to the resistive network by
integrating the expression for the instantaneous power from zero to
infinity:
w=∫0∞pdt=∫0∞(96e−2t)(12e−2t)dt=1152e−4t−4|0∞=288  J.
This result is the difference between the initially stored energy (320 J)

and the energy trapped in the parallel inductors (32 J). Also, note that
the equivalent inductor for the parallel inductors (which predicts the
terminal behavior of the parallel combination) has an initial energy of
12(4)(12)2=288 J; that is, the energy stored in the equivalent inductor
represents the amount of energy that will be delivered to the resistive
network at the terminals of the original inductors.

7.2 The Natural Response of an RC
Circuit
The form of an RC circuit’s natural response is analogous to that of an RL
circuit. Consequently, we don’t treat the RC circuit in as much detail as we
did the RL circuit.
We develop the natural response of an RC circuit using the circuit shown in
Fig. 7.12. Begin by assuming that the switch has been in position a for a long
time, allowing the loop containing the dc voltage source Vg, the resistor R1,
and the capacitor C to reach a steady-state condition. Recall from Chapter 6
that a capacitor behaves as an open circuit in the presence of a constant
voltage, so the source voltage appears across the capacitor terminals. In
Section 7.3, we will discuss how the capacitor voltage builds to the steady-
state value of the dc voltage source. Here it is important to remember that
when the switch is moved from position a to position b (at t=0), the voltage
on the capacitor is Vg. Because there can be no instantaneous change in the
voltage at the terminals of a capacitor, the problem reduces to solving the
circuit shown in Fig. 7.13.

We can easily find the voltage v(t) by writing a KCL equation. Using the
lower node between R and C as the reference node and summing the currents
away from the upper node between R and C gives
Cdvdt+ vR=0.(7.6)
Comparing Eq. 7.6 with Eq. 7.1, you should see that the mathematical
techniques used to find i(t) in the RL circuit can be used to find v(t) in the RC
circuit. We leave it to you to show that
v(t)=v(0)e−t/RC,   t≥0.
As we have already noted, the initial voltage on the capacitor equals the
voltage source voltage Vg, or
Capacitor Voltage
v(0−)=v(0)=v(0+)=Vg=V0,(7.7)
where V0 denotes the initial voltage on the capacitor. The time constant for
the RC circuit equals the product of the resistance and capacitance, namely,
Time Constant for RC Circuit
τ=RC.(7.8)
Therefore, the general expression for the voltage becomes
Natural Response of an RC Circuit
v(t)=V0e−t/τ,   t≥0,(7.9)
which indicates that the natural response of an RC circuit is an exponential
decay of the initial voltage. The time constant RC governs the rate of decay.

3. Step 3: Write the equation for the capacitor voltage for t≥0 by
substituting the values for the initial voltage and the time constant into

1. 
1. Step 1: Determine the initial capacitor voltage V0 by drawing the

the values for V0 and τ into Eq. 7.9:

4. Step 4: Determine the remaining quantities using resistive circuit
analysis techniques for the circuit in Fig. 7.17.
2. To find vo(t) in Fig. 7.17, note that the resistive circuit forms a voltage
divider across the terminals of the capacitor. Thus
vo(t)=240×103||60×10332×103+(240×103||60×103)vC(t)=0.6(100e
−25t)=60e−25tV,   t≥0+.
This expression for vo(t) is valid for t≥0+ because vo(0−) is zero. Thus,
we have an instantaneous change in the voltage across the 240 kΩ
resistor.

Solution
1. Once we know v(t), we can obtain the current i(t) from Ohm’s law.
After determining i(t), we can calculate v1(t) and v2(t) because the

voltage across a capacitor is a function of the capacitor current. To find
v(t), we replace the series-connected capacitors with an equivalent
capacitor. It has a capacitance of 4 μF and is charged to a voltage of 20
V. Therefore, the circuit shown in Fig. 7.18 reduces to the one shown in
Fig. 7.19. We can now use Analysis Method 7.2 to determine v(t).

1. Step 1: The initial voltage across the capacitor in Fig. 7.19 is
V0=20 V.
2. Step 2: The resistance attached to the capacitor in Fig. 7.19 is
250 kΩ. Therefore, the time constant is τ=(250×103)(4×10−6)=1 s.
3. Step 3: Write the equation for the capacitor voltage by substituting
the values for V0 and τ in Eq. 7.9 to give
v(t)=20e−t V,   t≥0.

4. Step 4: Determine the currents and voltages requested using the
techniques described at the start of the Solution.
For the circuit in Fig. 7.19, use Ohm’s law to find the current i(t):
i(t)=v(t)250,000=80e−t μA,   t≥0+.
Knowing i(t), we calculate the expressions for v1(t) and v2(t) for the
circuit in Fig. 7.18:
v1(t)=−15×10−6∫0t80×10−6e−xdx−4=(16e−t−20) V,   t≥0,v2(t)=
−120×10−6∫0t80×10−6e−xdx+24=(4e−t+20) V,t≥0.
2. The initial energy stored in C1 is
w1=12(5×10−6)(4)2=40 μJ.
The initial energy stored in C2 is
w2=12(20×10−6)(24)2=5760 μJ.
The total energy stored in the two capacitors is
wo=40+5760=5800 μJ.
3. As t→ ∞,
v1→−20V and v2→+20V.
Therefore, the energy stored in the two capacitors is
w∞=12(5×10−6)(−20)2+12(20×10−6)(20)2=5000 μJ.
4. The total energy delivered to the 250 kΩ resistor is
w=∫0∞pdt=∫0∞(20e−t)(80×10−6e−t)dt=800 μJ.
Comparing the results obtained in (b) and (c) shows that

800 μJ=(5800−5000) μJ.
The energy stored in the equivalent capacitor in Fig. 7.19 is 12(4×10–6)
(20)2=800 μJ. Because this capacitor predicts the terminal behavior of
the original series-connected capacitors, the energy stored in the
equivalent capacitor is the energy delivered to the 250 kΩ resistor.

7.3 The Step Response of RL and
RC Circuits
The response of a circuit to the sudden application of a constant voltage or
current source is called the step response of the circuit. In this section, we
find the step response of first-order RL and RC circuits by describing the
currents and voltages generated when either dc voltage or current sources are
suddenly applied. We also show how the circuit responds when energy is
being stored in the inductor or capacitor. We begin with the step response of
an RL circuit.
The Step Response of an RL Circuit
We modify the first-order circuit shown in Fig. 7.2(a) by adding a switch and
develop the step response of an RL circuit using the resulting circuit, shown
in Fig. 7.20. We assume a nonzero initial current i(0), so the inductor has
stored energy at the time the switch is closed. We want to find the
expressions for the current in the circuit and for the voltage across the
inductor after the switch has been closed. We use circuit analysis to derive
the differential equation that describes the circuit in terms of the variable of
interest, and then we use elementary calculus to solve the equation, just as we
did in Section 7.1.
Figure 7.20 A circuit used to
illustrate the step response of a
first-order RL circuit.

Figure 7.20 Full Alternative Text
After the switch in Fig. 7.20 has been closed, KVL requires that
Vs=Ri+Ldidt,(7.10)
which can be solved for the current by separating the variables i and t and
then integrating. We begin by solving Eq. 7.10 for the derivative di /dt :
didt=−Ri+ VsL=−RL(i− VsR).
Next, we multiply both sides of the equation for di/dt by a differential time
dt. This step reduces the left-hand side of the equation to a differential change
in the current. Thus
di=−RL(i−VsR)dt.
We now separate the variables in the equation for di to get
dii−(Vs/R)=−RLdt,
and then integrate both sides. Using x and y as variables for the integration,
we obtain
∫I0i(t)dxx−(Vs/R)=−RL∫0tdy,

where I0 is the current at t=0 and i(t) is the current at any t>0. Evaluating the
integrals gives
lni(t) − (Vs/R)I0−(Vs/R)=−RLt,
from which
i(t)−(Vs/R)I0−(Vs/R)=e−(R/L)t,
or
i(t)=VsR+(I0−VsR)e−(R/L)t.(7.11)
Equation 7.11 indicates that after the switch is closed, the current changes
exponentially from its initial value I0 to a final value If=Vs/R. The time
constant of the circuit, τ=L/R, determines the rate of change. We can
determine the final value of the current by analyzing the circuit in Fig. 7.20 as
t→∞, and we can calculate the time constant by finding the equivalent
resistance attached to the inductor in the circuit shown in Fig. 7.20 for t≥0.
Now express the equation for inductor current (Eq. 7.11) in terms of the
initial value of the current, the final value of the current, and the time
constant of the circuit to give
Step Response of an RL Circuit
i(t)=If+(I0−If)e−t/τ.(7.12)
Using Eq. 7.12, we can construct a step-by-step procedure to calculate the
step response of an RL circuit.
1. Step 1: Determine the initial current, I0, in the inductor. This usually
involves analyzing the circuit for t<0.
2. Step 2: Calculate the time constant, τ. To do this, you need to find the
equivalent resistance attached to the inductor for t≥0.
3. Step 3: Calculate the final value of the inductor current, If, by analyzing

the circuit as t approaches infinity.
4. Step 4: Write the equation for the inductor current when t≥0 by
substituting the values for the initial current, the time constant, and the
final current into Eq. 7.12.
5. Step 5: Calculate any other quantities of interest, such as resistor current
and voltage, using resistive circuit analysis techniques.
This method is summarized in Analysis Method 7.3 and is applied to a
specific circuit in Example 7.5.

Response of an RL Circuit
The switch in the circuit shown in Fig. 7.21 has been in position a for a long
time. At t=0, the switch moves from position a to position b. The switch is a

make-before-break type; that is, the connection at position b is established
before the connection at position a is broken, so the inductor current is
continuous.

5. Plot both i(t) and v(t) versus t.
Solution
1. Use Analysis Method 7.3 to find the inductor current.
1. Step 1:Determine the initial current in the inductor. To do this,
draw the circuit in Fig. 7.21 when t<0 and the switch is in position
a, as shown in Fig. 7.22. Note that since the switch has been in
position a for a long time, the inductor behaves like a short circuit
that carries all of the current from the 8 A current source.
Therefore, I0=−8 A because the inductor current and the source
current are in opposite directions.

2. Step 2:Calculate the time constant for the circuit. Start by drawing
the circuit in Fig. 7.21 when t≥0 and the switch is in position b, as
shown in Fig. 7.23. Then determine the Thévenin equivalent
resistance for the circuit attached to the inductor. Since the circuit

attached to the inductor is already a Thévenin equivalent circuit, the
Thévenin equivalent resistance is 2 Ω and τ=0.2/2=0.1 s.

3. Step 3:Calculate the final value for the inductor current. To do this,
draw the circuit in Fig. 7.21 as t→∞, when the switch is in position
b, as shown in Fig. 7.24. Since the switch has been in position b for
a long time, the inductor behaves like a short circuit, as seen in Fig.
7.24, and the current can be found from Ohm’s law. Therefore,
If=24/2=12 A.

4. Step 4:Write the equation for the inductor current when t≥0 by
substituting the values for the initial current, the time constant, and
the final current into Eq. 7.12 to give

5. Step 5:Calculate any other quantities of interest, which we do in the
remainder of this example.
2. The voltage across the inductor is
v=Ldidt=0.2(200e−10t)=40e−10t V,   t≥0+.
The initial inductor voltage is
v(0+)=40V.
3. Yes. In the instant after the switch has been moved to position b, the
inductor current is 8 A counterclockwise around the newly formed
closed path. This current causes a 16 V drop across the 2 Ω resistor. This
voltage drop adds to the 24 V drop across the source, producing a 40 V
drop across the inductor.
4. We find the time at which the inductor voltage equals 24 V by solving

the expression
24=40e−10t
for t:
t=110 ln 4024=51.08 ms.
5. Figure 7.25 shows the graphs of i(t) and v(t) versus t. Note that at the
instant of time when the current equals zero, the inductor voltage equals
the source voltage of 24 V, as predicted by Kirchhoff’s voltage law.

Observations on the Step Response
of an RL Circuit
Let’s take a closer look at the RL step response of the circuit shown in Fig.
7.20. If the initial energy in the inductor is zero, I0 is zero and Eq. 7.11
reduces to
i(t)=VsR−VsRe−(R/L)t.(7.13)
One time constant after the switch has been closed, the current will have
reached approximately 63% of its final value, or
i(τ)=VsR−VsRe−1≈0.6321VsR.
If the current were to continue to increase at its initial rate, it would reach its
final value at t=τ; that is, because
didt=−VsR(−1τ)e−t/τ=VsLe−t/τ,
the initial rate at which i(t) increases is
didt(0)=VsL.
If the current were to continue to increase at this rate, the expression for i

would be
i=VsLt,(7.14)
so at t=τ,
i=VsLLR=VsR.
Equations 7.13 and 7.14 are plotted in Fig. 7.26. The values for i(τ) and If are
also shown in this figure.
Figure 7.26 The step response
of the RL circuit shown in Fig.
7.20 when I0=0

Figure 7.26 Full Alternative Text
The voltage across an inductor is Ldi/dt, so from Eq. 7.11, for t≥0+,
v=L(−RL)(I0−VsR)e−(R/L)t=(Vs−I0R)e−(R/L)t.(7.15)
The voltage across the inductor is zero before the switch is closed because the
inductor is behaving like a short circuit. The voltage equation indicates that
the inductor voltage jumps to Vs−I0R at the instant the switch is closed and

then decays exponentially to zero.
Does the value of v at t=0+ make sense? Because the initial current is I0 and
the inductor prevents an instantaneous change in current, the current is I0 in
the instant after the switch has been closed. The voltage drop across the
resistor is I0R, so the voltage across the inductor is the source voltage minus
the resistor voltage, that is, Vs−I0R.
When the initial inductor current is zero, Eq. 7.15 simplifies to
v=Vse−(R/L)t.
If the initial current is zero, the voltage across the inductor jumps to Vs when
the switch closes. We also expect the inductor voltage to approach zero as t
increases because the current in the circuit is approaching the constant value
of Vs/R. Figure 7.27 shows the plot of the simplified voltage equation and the
relationship between the time constant and the initial rate at which the
inductor voltage is decreasing.
Figure 7.27 Inductor voltage
versus time.

Figure 7.27 Full Alternative Text
We can also describe the voltage v(t) across the inductor in Fig. 7.20 directly,
without first calculating the circuit current. We begin by noting that the
voltage across the resistor is the difference between the source voltage and
the inductor voltage. Using Ohm’s law, we write
i(t)=VsR− v(t)R,
where Vs is a constant. Differentiating both sides with respect to time yields
didt=−1Rdvdt.
Then, if we multiply each side of this equation by the inductance L, we get an
expression for the voltage across the inductor on the left-hand side, or
v=− LRdvdt.

Putting this differential equation into standard form yields
dvdt+RLv=0.(7.16)
You should verify (in Problem 7.39) that the solution to Eq. 7.16 is identical
to that given in Eq. 7.15.
At this point, a general observation about the step response of an RL circuit is
pertinent. (This observation will prove helpful later.) When we derived the
differential equation for the inductor current, we obtained Eq. 7.10, which we
can rewrite as
didt+RLi=VsL.(7.17)
Observe that Eqs. 7.16 and 7.17 have the same form. Specifically, each
equates the sum of the first derivative of the variable and a constant times the
variable to a constant value. In Eq. 7.16, the constant on the right-hand side
happens to be zero; hence, this equation takes on the same form as the
natural-response equations in Section 7.1. In both Eq. 7.16 and Eq. 7.17, the
constant multiplying the dependent variable is the reciprocal of the time
constant; that is, R/L=1/τ. We will encounter a similar situation in the
derivations for the step response of an RC circuit. In Section 7.4, we will use
these observations to develop a general approach to finding the natural and
step responses of RL and RC circuits.
The Step Response of an RC Circuit
We can find the step response of a first-order RC circuit by analyzing the
circuit shown in Fig. 7.28. For mathematical convenience, we choose the
Norton equivalent of the network connected to the equivalent capacitor.
Summing the currents away from the top node in Fig. 7.28 generates the
differential equation
Figure 7.28 A circuit used to

illustrate the step response of a
first-order RC circuit.
Figure 7.28 Full Alternative Text
CdvCdt+ vCR=Is.
Dividing both sides of the differential equation by C gives
dvCdt+vCRC=IsC.(7.18)
Comparing Eq. 7.18 with Eq. 7.17 reveals that the form of the solution for vC
is the same as that for the current in the inductive circuit, namely, Eq. 7.11.
Therefore, by substituting the appropriate variables and coefficients, we can
write the solution for vC directly. The translation requires that Is replace Vs,
C replace L, 1/R replace R, and V0 replace I0. We get
vC=IsR+(V0−IsR)e−t/RC,   t≥0.(7.19)
Equation 7.19 indicates that after the switch has been closed, the voltage
changes exponentially from its initial value V0 to a final value Vf=IsR. The
time constant of the circuit, τ=RC, determines the rate of change. We can
determine the final value of the voltage by analyzing the circuit in Fig. 7.28
as t→0, and we can calculate the time constant by finding the equivalent

resistance attached to the capacitor in the circuit shown in Fig. 7.28 for t≥0.
Now express the equation for capacitor voltage (Eq. 7.19) in terms of the
initial value of the voltage, the final value of the voltage, and the time
constant of the circuit to give
Step Response of an RC Circuit
v(t)=Vf+(V0−Vf)e−t/τ.(7.20)
Using Eq. 7.20, we can construct a step-by-step procedure to calculate the
step response of an RC circuit.
1. Step 1: Determine the initial voltage, V0, across the capacitor. This
usually involves analyzing the circuit for t<0.
2. Step 2: Calculate the time constant, τ. To do this, you need to find the
equivalent resistance attached to the capacitor for t≥0.
3. Step 3: Calculate the final value of the capacitor voltage, Vf, by
analyzing the circuit as t approaches infinity.
4. Step 4: Write the equation for the capacitor voltage when t≥0 by
substituting the values for the initial voltage, the time constant, and the
final voltage into Eq. 7.20.
5. Step 5: Calculate any other quantities of interest, such as resistor current
and voltage, using resistive circuit analysis techniques.
This method is summarized in Analysis Method 7.4.

5. Calculate other quantities of interest using the capacitor voltage.
Analysis Method 7.4 Finding the RC step response.
A similar derivation for the current in the capacitor yields the differential
equation
didt+1RCi=0.(7.21)
Equation 7.21 has the same form as Eq. 7.16, so the solution for i is obtained
by using the same translations used for the solution of Eq. 7.18. Thus
i=(Is−V0R)e−t/RC,   t≥0+,(7.22)
where V0 is the initial voltage across the capacitor.
We obtained Eqs. 7.19 and 7.22 by applying a mathematical analogy to the
solution for the step response of the RL circuit. Let’s see whether these
solutions for the RC circuit make sense in terms of known circuit behavior.
From Eq. 7.19, we have already observed that the initial capacitor voltage is
V0, the final capacitor voltage is IsR, and the time constant of the circuit is
RC. Also note that the solution for vC is valid for t≥0. These observations are
consistent with the behavior of a capacitor in parallel with a resistor when
driven by a constant current source.
Equation 7.22 predicts that the current in the capacitor at t=0+ is Is−V0/R.
This prediction makes sense because the capacitor voltage cannot change
instantaneously, and therefore the initial current in the resistor is V0/R. The
capacitor branch current changes instantaneously from zero at t=0− to Is
−V0/R at t=0+. The capacitor current is zero at t= ∞.

response of a first-order RC circuit.

1. Step 1:Determine the initial voltage across the capacitor by
analyzing the circuit in Fig. 7.29 for t<0. Do this by redrawing the
circuit with the switch in position 1, as shown in Fig. 7.30. Note
that the capacitor behaves like an open circuit because the switch
has been in position 1 for a long time. The capacitor’s initial

7.29. Begin by drawing the circuit in Fig. 7.29 with the switch in
position 2, as shown in Fig. 7.31(a). Then find the Norton
equivalent with respect to the terminals of the capacitor. Begin by
computing the open-circuit voltage, which is given by the −75V
source divided across the 40 kΩ and 160 kΩ resistors:

Voc=160×103(40+160)×103(−75)=−60 V.
Next, calculate the Thévenin resistance, as seen to the right of the
capacitor, by shorting the −75V source and making series and
parallel combinations of the resistors:
RTh=8000+40,000 || 160,000=40 kΩ
The value of the Norton current source is the ratio of the open-
circuit voltage to the Thévenin resistance, or −60/(40×103)=

−1.5mA. The resulting Norton equivalent circuit is shown in Fig.
7.31(b). From Fig. 7.31(b) we see that the equivalent resistance
attached to the capacitor is 40 kΩ, so the time constant is
τ=RC=(40×103)(0.25×10−6)=10ms .
2. Step 3:Calculate the final value of the capacitor voltage by
analyzing the circuit in Fig. 7.29 as t→∞. The circuit is shown in
Fig. 7.32, and since the switch has been in position 2 for a long
time, the capacitor behaves like an open circuit. The final capacitor
voltage equals the voltage across the 40 kΩ resistor, so

values for initial capacitor voltage, time constant, and final
capacitor voltage into Eq. 7.20 to give
vo=Vf+(V0-Vf)e-t/τ=-60+[30-(-60)]e-t/0.01=-60+90e-100tV,   t=0.

4. Step 5:We calculate the other quantity of interest, io, in part (b).
2. Write the solution for io using the relationship between current and
voltage in a capacitor to give
io=Cdvodt=(0.25×10-6)(-9000e-100t)=-2.25e-100t mA.
Because dvo(0−)/dt=0, the expression for io clearly is valid only for
t≥0+.

We can construct a general approach to finding either the natural response or

differential equations all have the same form. To generalize the solution of
these four possible circuits, we let x(t) represent the unknown quantity, where
x(t) represents the circuit variable that is required to be continuous for all
time. Thus, x(t) is the inductor current for RL natural- and step-response
circuits and is the capacitor voltage for RC natural- and step-response
circuits. From Eqs. 7.16, 7.17, 7.18, and 7.21, we know that the differential
equation describing both the natural and step responses of the RL and RC
circuits takes the form
dxdt+xτ=K,
where the value of the constant K is zero for the natural response and nonzero
for the step response.
How are the natural and step responses of RL circuits different, and how are
they the same? Compare the circuits we analyzed to determine the natural and
step responses of RL circuits using Figs. 7.3 and 7.20. The step-response
circuit contains an independent source for t≥0, but the natural-response
circuit does not. Now compare the analysis of the RL natural response and
the RL step response (Analysis Methods 7.1 and 7.3). There is one extra
calculation in the step-response analysis that computes the final value of the
inductor current. We can make Analysis Methods 7.1 and 7.3 exactly the
same by recognizing that the final value of the inductor current in the natural-
response circuit is 0. These same observations hold when comparing both the
natural and step responses of RC circuits (Figs. 7.12 and 7.28) and the
natural-response analysis and step-response analysis of RC circuits (Analysis
Methods 7.2 and 7.4). So we can make Analysis Methods 7.2 and 7.4 exactly
the same by recognizing that the final value of the capacitor voltage in the
natural-response circuit is 0.

Next, let’s look at how the step response of an RL circuit is similar to and
different from the step response of an RC circuit. Comparing Analysis
Methods 7.2 and 7.4, we identify four important differences:
In the RL circuit, we find the inductor current for t≥0; in the RC circuit,
we find the capacitor voltage for t≥0.
We analyze the RL circuit when t<0 to find the initial inductor current;
we analyze the RC circuit when t<0 to find the initial capacitor voltage.
We analyze the RL circuit when t≥0 to find the equivalent resistance
attached to the inductor and use it to calculate the circuit’s time constant,
τ=L/R; we analyze the RC circuit when t≥0 to find the equivalent
resistance attached to the capacitor and use it to calculate the circuit’s
time constant, τ=RC.
We analyze the RL circuit as t→∞ to find the final inductor current; we
analyze the RC circuit as t→∞ to find the final capacitor voltage. If the
circuit exhibits a natural response instead of a step response, we know
that the final values are zero without performing circuit analysis.
Based on these comparisons, we can create a general step-by-step method to
calculate the natural and step responses of both RL and RC circuits.
1. Step 1:Identify the variable x(t), which is the quantity that is required to
be continuous for all time. This is the inductor current in RL circuits and
the capacitor voltage in RC circuits.
2. Step 2:Calculate the initial value X0, by analyzing the circuit to find x(t)
for t<0.
3. Step 3:Calculate the time constant, τ, for the circuit by analyzing the
circuit for t≥0 to find the equivalent resistance attached to the inductor
or capacitor. For RL circuits, τ=L/R, and for RC circuits, τ=RC.
4. Step 4:Calculate the final value Xf, by analyzing the circuit to find x(t)
as t→∞. If the circuit exhibits a natural response, Xf=0, so no
calculation is needed.

5. Step 5:Write the equation for x(t) by substituting the initial value X0, the
time constant τ, and the final value Xf, into the expression

x(t)= Xf+(X0−Xf)e−t/τ, t≥0.(7.23)
6. Step 6:Use x(t) to find any other quantities of interest in the circuit.
These general steps are summarized in Analysis Method 7.5. Examples

responses of RC or RL circuits.

4. What is the expression for io(t) when t≥0?
5. What is the expression for vo(t) when t≥0?
6. Find vo(0−) and vo(0+).
Solution
Use Analysis Method 7.5.
1. Step1: Identify the inductor current, io, as the variable of interest,
because this is an RL circuit.
Step2: Calculate the initial value of io. The switch has been closed for a
long time, so the inductor behaves like a short circuit. Therefore, the
current through the inductor is the current in the 25 Ω resistor. Using
current division, the current in the 25 Ω resistor is [(100||25)/25]
(0.075)=60 mA, so I0=io(0)=60 mA.
2. Step3: Calculate the time constant τ=L/R. When t≥0, the equivalent
resistance attached to the inductor is the series combination of the 100 Ω
and 25 Ω resistors, or 125 Ω and. Therefore,
τ=0.05125=0.4ms.
3. Step4: Calculate the final value for the inductor current, If. This is a
natural-response problem because for t≥0 there is no source in the
circuit. Eventually, all of the energy stored in the inductor before the
switch opens is dissipated by the resistors and the inductor current is
zero, so If=0.
4. Step5: Write the equation for the inductor current by substituting the
values for Io, τ, and If into Eq. 7.23 to give

io(t)=If+(I0−If)e−t/τ=0+(0.06−0)e−t/0.4×10−3
=60e−2500tmA,   t≥0.
5. Step6: Use the inductor current to find the voltage across the 100 Ω,
using Ohm’s law. The result is
vo(t)=−100io=−6e−2500t V,   t≥0+.
6. From part (a), when t<0 the switch is closed, and the current divides
between the 100 Ω and 25 Ω resistors. We know that the current in the
25 Ω is 60 mA, so the current in the 100 Ω must be 75–60=15 mA.
Using Ohm’s law,
vo(0−)=100(0.015)=1.5V.
From part (e)
vo(0+)=−6e−2500(0+) =−6V.
There is a discontinuity in the voltage across the 100 Ω resistor at t=0.

3. How long after the switch is in position b does the capacitor voltage

4. Plot vC(t) and i(t) versus t.
Solution
Use Analysis Method 7.5.
1. 
1. Step 1: Identify the capacitor voltage, vC, as the variable of
interest, because this is an RC circuit.
2. Step 2: Calculate the initial value of vC. The switch has been in
position a for a long time, so the capacitor looks like an open
circuit. Therefore, the voltage across the capacitor is the voltage
across the 60 Ω resistor. Using voltage division, the voltage across
the 60 Ω resistor is [60/(60+20)](40)=30 V, positive at the lower

terminal of the resistor. But vC is positive at the upper terminal of
the capacitor, so V0=vC(0)=−30 V.
3. Step 3: Calculate the time constant τ=RC. When t≥0, the equivalent
resistance attached to the capacitor has the value 400 kΩ.
Therefore,
τ=(400×103)(0.5×10−6)=0.2s.
4. Step 4: Calculate the final value for the capacitor voltage, Vf. As
t→∞, the switch has been in position b for a long time, and the
capacitor behaves like an open circuit in the presence of the 90 V
source. Because of the open circuit, there is no current in the
400 kΩ resistor, so Vf=90 V.
5. Step 5: Write the equation for capacitor voltage by substituting the
values for Vo, τ, and Vf into Eq. 7.23 to give
vC(t)=Vf+(V0−Vf)e−t/τ=90+(−30−90)e−t/0.2=90−120e
−5t V,   t≥0.
2. Step6: Use the relationship between voltage and current for capacitors to
find the capacitor voltage. The result is
i(t)=CdvCdt=(0.5×10−6)[ −5(−120e−5t) ]=300e−5tμA,   t≥0+.
3. To find how long the switch must be in position b before the capacitor
voltage becomes zero, we solve the equation derived in (a) for the time
when vC(t)=0:
120e−5t=90 or e5t=12090,
so
t=15 ln (43)=57.54 ms.
Note that when vC=0, the voltage drop across the 400 kΩ resistor is 90
V so i=225 μA.

Solution
Use Analysis Method 7.5.
1. 
1. Step 1: Identify the inductor current, i, as the variable of interest,
because this is an RL circuit.
2. Step 2: Calculate the initial value of i. The switch has been open for
a long time, so from Ohm’s law, the initial current in the inductor is
20/(1+3)=5 A. Thus, I0=i(0)=5 A.
3. Step 3: Calculate the time constant τ=L/R. When t≥0, the switch is
closed, shunting the 3 Ω resistor. The remaining resistance attached
to the inductor has the value 1 Ω. Therefore,
τ=80×10−31=80 ms.
4. Step 4: Calculate the final value for the inductor current. As t→∞,
the switch has been closed for a long time, and the inductor
behaves like a short circuit in the presence of the 20 V source.
Using Ohm’s law, the current in the inductor is 20/1=20 A, so
If=20 A.
5. Step 5: Write the equation for inductor current by substituting the
values for Io, τ, and If into Eq. 7.23 to give
i(t)=If+(I0−If)e−t/τ=20+(5−20)e−t/0.08=20−15e−12.5tA,   t≥0.
2. Step6: Use the relationship between voltage and current for inductors to
find the inductor voltage. The result is
v(t)=Ldidt=(80×10−3)[ −12.5(−15e−12.5t) ]=15e−12.5tV,   t≥0+.

1. For the circuit in Fig. 7.37, the magnetically coupled coils can be
replaced by a single inductor having an inductance of

Leq=L1L2−M2L1+L2−2M=45−3618−12=1.5 H.
(See Problem 6.38.) It follows that the circuit in Fig. 7.37 can be
simplified, as shown in Fig. 7.38. We can apply Analysis Method 7.5 to
the circuit in Fig. 7.38.

Fig. 7.37 with the
magnetically coupled coils

Figure 7.38 Full Alternative Text
1. Step 1: Identify the inductor current, io, as the variable of interest,
because this is an RL circuit.
2. Step 2: Calculate the initial value of i. By hypothesis, there is no
initial energy stored in the coils, so there is no initial current in the
equivalent 1.5 H inductor. Thus, I0=i(0)=0.

3. Step 3: Calculate the time constant τ=L/R. When t≥0, the switch is
closed and the resistance attached to the inductor has the value
7.5 Ω. Therefore,
τ=1.57.5=0.2s.
4. Step 4: Calculate the final value for the inductor current. As t→∞,
the switch has been closed for a long time, and the inductor
behaves like a short circuit in the presence of the 120 V source.
Using Ohm’s law, the current in the inductor is 120/7.5=16 A, so
If=16 A.
5. Step 5: Write the equation for inductor current by substituting the
values for Io, τ, and If into Eq. 7.23 to give
io(t)=If+(I0−If)e−t/τ=16+(0−16)e−t/0.2=16−16e−5tA,   t≥0.
6. Step 6: Use the inductor current and the relationship between
voltage and current for inductors to find the inductor voltage. The
result is
v(t)=Ldidt=(1.5)[ −5(−16e−5t) ]=120e−5tV,   t≥0+.
To find i1 and i2 we use KVL for the mesh containing the coupled
coils in Fig. 7.37 to see that
3di1dt+ 6di2dt=6di1dt + 15di2dt
or
di1dt=−3di2dt.
It also follows from Fig. 7.37 and KCL that io=i1+ i2, so
diodt=di1dt+di2dt=−3di2dt+di2dt=−2di2dt.
Therefore
80e−5t=−2di2dt.

Because i2(0) is zero, we have
i2=∫0t−40e−5x dx=−8 + 8e−5t A,   t≥0.
Using io=i1+ i2, we get
i1=(16−16e−5t)−(−8+8e−5t)=24−24e−5tA,   t≥0.
2. First, we observe that io(0), i1(0), and i2(0) are all zero, which is
consistent with the statement that no energy is stored in the circuit at the
instant the switch is closed. Then we observe that vo(0+)=120 V, which
is consistent with the fact that io(0)=0. Now we see that the solutions for
i1 and i2 are consistent with the solution for vo by observing
vo=3di1dt+ 6di2dt=360e−5t− 240e−5t=120e−5t V,   t≥0+,
or
vo=6di1dt+ 15di2dt=720e−5t− 600e−5t=120e−5t V,   t≥0+.
The final values of i1 and i2 can be checked using flux linkages. The
flux linking the 3 H coil (λ1) must be equal to the flux linking the 15 H
coil (λ2) because
vo=dλ1dt=dλ2dt.
Now
λ1=3i1+ 6i2  Wb-turns
and
λ2=6i1+15i2 Wb-turns.
Regardless of which expression we use, we obtain
λ1=λ2=24−24e−5t  Wb-turns.
Note the solution for λ1 or λ2 is consistent with the solution for vo.

The final value of the flux linking either coil 1 or coil 2 is 24 Wb-turns;
that is,
λ1(∞)=λ2(∞)=24  Wb-turns.
The final value of i1 is
i1(∞)=24 A
and the final value of i2 is
i2(∞)=−8 A.
The consistency between these final values for i1 and i2 and the final
value of the flux linkage can be seen from the expressions:
λ1(∞)=3i1(∞)+ 6i2(∞)=3(24) + 6(−8)=24  Wb-
turns,λ2(∞)=6i1(∞)+15i2(∞)=6(24)+15(−8)=24 Wb-turns.
The final values of i1 and i2 can only be checked via flux linkage
because at t= ∞ the two coils are ideal short circuits. We cannot use
current division when the two branches have no resistance

7.5 Sequential Switching
Whenever switching occurs at two or more distinct times in a circuit, we have
sequential switching. For example, a single, two-position switch may be in
position 1 at t1 and in position 2 at t2, or multiple switches may be opened or
closed in sequence. We determine the voltages and currents generated by a
switching sequence using the techniques described previously in this chapter,
primarily Analysis Method 7.5. We derive the expressions for v(t) and i(t) for
a given position of the switch or switches and then use these solutions to
determine the initial conditions for the next position of the switch or
switches.
With sequential switching problems, a premium is placed on obtaining the
initial value x(t0). Recall that anything but inductive currents and capacitive
voltages can change instantaneously at the time of switching. Thus, solving
first for inductive currents and capacitive voltages is even more pertinent in
sequential switching problems. Drawing the circuit that pertains to each time
interval in such a problem is often helpful in the solution process.
Examples 7.11 and 7.12 illustrate the analysis techniques for circuits with
sequential switching. The first example is a natural-response problem with
two switching times, and the second is a step-response problem.
Example 7.11 Analyzing an RL

The two switches in the circuit shown in Fig. 7.39 have been closed for a

Solution
1. We use Analysis Method 7.5 to solve this problem.

1. Step 1: Identify the inductor current, iL, as the variable of interest,
because this is an RL circuit.
2. Step 2: Calculate the initial value of i. For t<0 both switches are
closed, causing the 150 mH inductor to short-circuit the 18 Ω
resistor. The equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 7.40. We determine
the initial current in the inductor by solving for iL(0−) in the circuit
shown in Fig. 7.40. After making several source transformations,
we find iL(0−) to be 6 A, so I0=6 A.
Figure 7.40 The circuit
shown in Fig. 7.39, for t<0.
Figure 7.40 Full Alternative Text
3. Step 3: Calculate the time constant τ=L/R. For 0≤t≤35 ms, switch 1
is open (switch 2 is closed), which disconnects the 60 V voltage
source and the 4 Ω and 12 Ω resistors from the circuit. The inductor
is no longer behaving as a short circuit (because the dc source is no
longer in the circuit), so the 18 Ω resistor is no longer short-
circuited. The equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 7.41. Note that the
equivalent resistance across the terminals of the inductor is the

parallel combination of 9 Ω and 18 Ω, or 6 Ω. Therefore,
Figure 7.41 The circuit
shown in Fig. 7.39, for
0≤t≤35 ms.
Figure 7.41 Full Alternative Text
τ=0.156=25ms.
4. Step 4:Calculate the final value for the inductor current. For
0≤t≤35 ms there is no source in the circuit, so during this time
period we have a natural-response problem and the final value of
the inductor current is zero. Thus, If=0.
5. Step 5:Write the equation for the inductor current for 0≤t≤35 ms by
substituting the values for Io, τ, and If into Eq. 7.23 to give
iL(t)=If+(I0−If)e−t/τ=0+(6−0)e−t/0.025=6e−40tA,0≤t≤35 ms.
Now we repeat Steps 2–5 for t≥35 ms.
6. Step 2:Calculate the initial value of the inductor current for this

time segment. When t=35ms, the value of the inductor current is
determined from the inductor current equation for the previous time
segment because the inductor current must be continuous for all
time. So,
iL(35×10−3)=6e−40(35×10−3)=6e−1.4=1.48A.
Thus, for t≥35 ms, I0=1.48 A.
7. Step 3:Calculate the time constant τ=L/R. For t≥35 ms, both
switches are open, and the circuit reduces to the one shown in Fig.
7.42. Note that the equivalent resistance across the terminals of the
inductor is the series combination of 3 Ω and 6 Ω or 9 Ω.
Therefore,
Figure 7.42 The circuit
shown in Fig. 7.39, for
t≥35 ms.
Figure 7.42 Full Alternative Text
τ=0.159=16.67ms.

8. Step 4:Calculate the final value for the inductor current. For
t≥35 ms there is no source in the circuit, so during this time period
we have a natural-response problem, and the final value of the
inductor current is zero. Thus, If=0.
9. Step 5:Write the equation for inductor current when t≥35 ms by
substituting the values for Io, τ, and If into Eq. 7.23 to give
iL(t)=If+ (I0−If)e−(t−t0)/τ=0 + (1.48−0)e−(t−0.035)/0.01667=1.48e
−60(t−0.035)A, t≥35 ms.
Note that when switch 2 is opened, the time constant changes and
the exponential function is shifted in time by 35 ms.
10. Step 6:Use the inductor current to solve the remaining parts of this
problem.
3. The 18 Ω resistor is in the circuit only during the first 35 ms of the
switching sequence. During this interval, the voltage across the resistor
is
vL=0.15ddt(6e−40t)=−36e−40t V,0<t<35 ms.
The power dissipated in the 18 Ω resistor is
p=vL218=72e−80t W, 0<t<35ms.
Hence, the energy dissipated is
w=∫00.03572e−80t dt=72−80e−80t|00.035=0.9(1−e−2.8)=845.27 mJ.
The initial energy stored in the 150 mH inductor is
w0=12(0.15)(6)2=2.7J=2700 mJ.
Therefore, (845.27/2700) × 100, or 31.31% of the initial energy stored in
the 150 mH inductor is dissipated in the 18 Ω resistor.
4. For 0<t<35ms, the voltage across the 3 Ω resistor is

v3Ω=(vL9)(3)=13vL=−12e−40t V.
Therefore, the energy dissipated in the 3 Ω resistor in the first 35 ms is
w3Ω=∫00.035(−12e−40t)23dt=0.6(1−e−2.8)=563.51 mJ.
For t>35ms, the current in the 3 Ω resistor is
i3Ω=iL=(6e−1.4)e−60(t−0.035) A.
Hence, the energy dissipated in the 3 Ω resistor for t>35 ms is
w3Ω=∫0.035∞3i3Ω2dt=∫0.035∞3(6e−1.4)2(e−60(t−0.035))2dt=108e
−2.8× e−120(t−0.035)−120|0.035∞=108120e−2.8=54.73 mJ.
The total energy dissipated in the 3 Ω resistor is
w3Ω(total)=563.51+ 54.73=618.24 mJ.
The percentage of the initial energy stored is
618.242700×100=22.90%.
5. Because the 6 Ω resistor is in series with the 3 Ω resistor, the energy
dissipated and the percentage of the initial energy stored will be twice
that of the 3 Ω resistor:
w6Ω(total)=1236.48 mJ,
and the percentage of the initial energy stored is 45.80%. We check
these calculations by observing that
1236.48+ 618.24 + 845.27=2699.99 mJ
and
31.31+22.90+ 45.80=100.01%.
The small discrepancies in the summations are the result of roundoff

errors.

1. Derive the numerical expression for the voltage across the capacitor.
2. Plot the capacitor voltage versus time.
3. When will the voltage on the capacitor equal 200 V?
Solution
1. We use Analysis Method 7.5 to solve this problem.
1. Step 1: Identify the capacitor voltage, v, as the variable of interest,
because this is an RC circuit.
2. Step 2:Calculate the initial value of v. For t<0, the capacitor is
initially uncharged, so V0=v(0)=0 V.
3. Step 3:Calculate the time constant t=RC. When 0≤t≤15 ms, the
equivalent resistance attached to the capacitor has the value
100 kΩ. Therefore,
τ=(100×103)(0.1×10−6)=10 ms.
4. Step 4:Calculate the final value for the capacitor voltage, Vf. If the
switch were to remain in position b for a long time, the capacitor
would eventually behave like an open circuit in the presence of the
400 V source. Because of the open circuit, there would be no
current in the 100 kΩ resistor, so Vf=400 V.
5. Step 5:Write the equation for capacitor voltage by substituting the
values for Vo, τ, and Vf into Eq. 7.23 to give
v(t)=Vf+(V0−Vf)e−t/τ=400+(0−400)e−t/0.01=400−400e
−100t V,0≤t≤15 ms.
Now we repeat Steps 2–5 for the next time interval, t≥15 ms.
6. Step 2:Calculate the initial value of v. At t=15 ms, the capacitor

voltage is determined by the equation we derived for the previous
time interval. So,
v(0.015)=400−400e−100(0.015)=400−400e−1.5=310.75 V.
Thus, V0=v(0.015)=310.75 V.
7. Step 3:Calculate the time constant t=RC. When t≥15 ms, the
equivalent resistance attached to the capacitor has the value 50 kΩ.
Therefore,
τ=(50×103)(0.1×10−6)=5 ms.
8. Step 4:Calculate the final value for the capacitor voltage, Vf. For
t≥15 ms, the switch remains in position c for a long time, and there
is no source in the circuit. During this time interval, the circuit
exhibits a natural response, so Vf=0.
9. Step 5:Write the equation for capacitor voltage by substituting the
values for Vo, τ, and Vf into Eq. 7.23 to give
v(t)=Vf +  (V0−Vf)e−(t−t0)/τ=0 + (310.75−0)e−(t
−0.015)/0.005=310.75e−200(t−0.015) V,   t≥15 ms.
10. Step 6:Use the capacitor voltage to solve the remaining parts of this
problem.
2. Figure 7.44 shows the plot of v versus t.

3. The plot in Fig. 7.44 reveals that the capacitor voltage will equal 200 V
at two different times: once in the interval between 0 and 15 ms and
once after 15 ms. We find the first time by solving the expression
200=400−400e−100t1,
which yields t1=6.93 ms. We find the second time by solving the
expression
200=310.75e−200(t2−0.015).
In this case, t2=17.20 ms.

7.6 Unbounded Response
A circuit response may grow, rather than decay, exponentially with time.
This type of response, called an unbounded response, is possible if the
circuit contains dependent sources. In circuits with an unbounded response,
the Thévenin equivalent resistance with respect to the terminals of either an
inductor or a capacitor is negative. This negative resistance generates a
negative time constant, and the resulting currents and voltages increase
without limit. In an actual circuit, a component eventually breaks down or
saturates, halting the unbounded response.
We cannot use Analysis Method 7.5 to analyze a circuit with an unbounded
response because calculating a final value of voltage or current is not
possible. Instead, we must derive the differential equation describing the
circuit’s response and then solve it using the separation of variables
technique. Example 7.13 analyzes a circuit with an unbounded response to
illustrate this technique.

Unbounded Response in an RC

2. Assume that the capacitor short-circuits when its terminal voltage
reaches 150 V. How many milliseconds elapse before the capacitor
short-circuits?
Solution
1. We need to write the differential equation that describes the capacitor
voltage, vo. To make this task easier, let’s simplify the circuit attached
to the capacitor by replacing it with its Thévenin equivalent. This
subcircuit is shown in Fig. 7.46, and as you can see, it does not contain
an independent source. Thus, the Thévenin equivalent consists of a
single resistor. To find the Thévenin equivalent resistance for the circuit
in Fig. 7.46, we use the test-source method (see Example 4.18, p. 124),
where vT is the test voltage and iT is the test current. Writing a KCL
equation at the top node, we get
Figure 7.46 The test-source
method used to find RTh.

Figure 7.46 Full Alternative Text
iT=vT10×103−7(vT20×103)+vT20×103
Solving for the ratio vT/iT yields the Thévenin resistance:
RTh=vTiT=−5 kΩ.
We replace the two resistors and the dependent source in Fig. 7.45 with
RTh to get the circuit shown in Fig. 7.47. For t≥0, write a KCL equation
at the top node to construct the differential equation describing this
circuit:

(5×10−6)dvodt+vo−5000=0
Dividing by the coefficient of the first derivative yields
dvodt− 40vo=0.
This equation has the same form as Eq. 7.1, so we can find vo(t) using
the same separation of variables technique applied to Eq. 7.1 (see p.
223). Thus, the capacitor voltage is
vo(t)=10e40t V,   t≥0.
2. vo=150 V when e40t=15. Therefore, 40t=ln 15, and t=67.70 ms.

Problems 7.87 and 7.88.
As an engineer, you should be aware that interconnected circuit elements may
create unbounded responses. If such interconnections are unintended, the
resulting circuit may experience unexpected, and potentially dangerous,
component failures.

7.7 The Integrating Amplifier
We are now ready to analyze an integrating-amplifier circuit, shown in Fig.
7.48, which is based on the op amp presented in Chapter 5. This circuit
generates an output voltage proportional to the integral of the input voltage.
In Fig. 7.48, we added the branch currents if and is, along with the node
voltages vn and vp, to aid our analysis. We assume that the op amp is ideal.
Write a KCL equation at the inverting input node, and remember that the
current into the ideal op amp at its input terminals is zero, to get
Figure 7.48 An integrating
amplifier.

Figure 7.48 Full Alternative Text
if+is=0.
Also, the ideal op amp constrains the voltages at its two input terminals to
give
vn=vp.
In the integrating amplifier circuit, vp=0, so using Ohm’s law
is=vsRs,
and using the relationship between voltage and current for a capacitor,
if=Cfdvodt.
Substituting the expressions for is and if into the KCL equation and solving
for dvo/dt, we get
dvodt=−1RsCfvs.
Multiplying both sides of this equation by a differential time dt and then
integrating from t0 to t generates the equation
vo(t)=− 1RsCf∫t0tvs dy+vo(t0).(7.24)
In Eq. 7.24, t0 represents the instant in time when we begin the integration.
Thus, vo(t0) is the value of the output voltage at that time. Also, because
vn=vp=0, vo(t0) is identical to the initial voltage on the feedback capacitor
Cf.
Equation 7.24 states that the output voltage of an integrating amplifier equals
the initial value of the voltage on the capacitor plus an inverted (minus sign),
scaled (1/RsCf) replica of the integral of the input voltage. If no energy is
stored in the capacitor when integration commences, Eq. 7.24 reduces to
vo(t)=−1RsCf∫t0tvs dy.
For example, assume that the input voltage is the rectangular voltage pulse

shown in Fig. 7.49. Assume also that the initial value of vo(t) is zero at the
instant vs steps from 0 to Vm. Using Eq. 7.24, we see that
Figure 7.49 An input voltage
signal.
Figure 7.49 Full Alternative Text
vo=−1RsCfVmt+ 0, 0≤t≤t1.
When t lies between t1 and 2s1,
vo=−1RsCf∫t1t (−Vm) dy−1RsCfVmt1=VmRsCft− 2VmRsCft1,t1≤t≤2t1.
Figure 7.50 shows a plot of vo(t) versus t. Clearly, the output voltage is an
inverted, scaled replica of the integral of the input voltage.

Figure 7.50 The output voltage
of an integrating amplifier.
Figure 7.50 Full Alternative Text
The output voltage is proportional to the integral of the input voltage only if
the op amp operates within its linear range—that is, if it doesn’t saturate.
Examples 7.14 and 7.15 further illustrate the analysis of the integrating
amplifier.
Example 7.14 Analyzing an
Integrating Amplifier
Assume that the numerical values for the voltage shown in Fig. 7.49 are
Vm=50 mV and t1=1 s. We apply this voltage to the integrating-amplifier
circuit shown in Fig. 7.48. The circuit parameters of the amplifier are

Rs=100 kΩ, Cf=0.1 μF, and VCC=6 V. The capacitor’s initial voltage is zero.

For 1≤t≤2 s,
vo=(5t−10) V.

Example 7.15 Analyzing an
Integrating Amplifier that Has
Sequential Switching
At the instant the switch makes contact with terminal a in the circuit shown in
Fig. 7.52, the voltage on the 0.1 μF capacitor is 5 V. The switch remains at
terminal a for 9 ms and then moves instantaneously to terminal b. How many
milliseconds after making contact with terminal b does the op amp saturate?

Figure 7.52 The circuit for
Example 7.15.
Figure 7.52 Full Alternative Text
Solution
The expression for the output voltage during the time the switch is at terminal
a is
vo=−1(100×103)(0.1×10−6)∫0t(−10)dy+(−5)=(−5+1000t) V.
Thus, 9 ms after the switch makes contact with terminal a, the output voltage

is 1000(9×10–3)–5=4 V. Note that the op amp does not saturate during its
first 9 ms of operation.
The expression for the output voltage after the switch moves to terminal b is
vo=−1(100×103)(0.1×10−6)∫9×10−3t8dy+4=−800(t−9×10−3)+4=
(11.2−800t) V.
When the switch is at terminal b, the voltage is decreasing, and the op amp
eventually saturates at −6 V. Therefore, we set the expression for vo equal to
−6 V to obtain the saturation time ts:
11.2−800ts=−6,
or
ts=21.5 ms.
Thus, the integrating amplifier saturates 21.5 ms after making contact with
terminal b.
From the examples, we see that the integrating amplifier can perform the
integration function very well but only within specified limits that avoid
saturating the op amp. The op amp saturates because charge accumulates on
the feedback capacitor. We can prevent saturation by placing a resistor in
parallel with the feedback capacitor. We examine such a circuit in Chapter 8.
Note that we can convert the integrating amplifier to a differentiating
amplifier by interchanging the input resistance Rs and the feedback capacitor
Cf. Then
vo=−RsCfdvsdt.
We leave the derivation of this expression as an exercise for you. The
differentiating amplifier is seldom used because in practice it is a source of
unwanted or noisy signals.
Finally, we can use an inductor instead of a capacitor to create both
integrating- and differentiating-amplifier circuits. Since it is easier to

fabricate capacitors for integrated-circuit devices, inductors are rarely used in
integrating amplifiers.

Practical Perspective
Artificial Pacemaker
The RC circuit shown in Fig. 7.53 can be used in an artificial pacemaker to
establish a normal heart rhythm by generating periodic electrical impulses.
The box labeled “controller” behaves as an open circuit until the voltage drop
across the capacitor reaches a preset limit. Once that limit is reached, the
capacitor discharges its stored energy in the form of an electrical impulse to
the heart, starts to recharge, and then the process repeats.
Figure 7.53 An artificial
pacemaker circuit.

Figure 7.53 Full Alternative Text
Before we develop the analytical expressions that describe the circuit’s
behavior, let’s get a feel for how the circuit works. First, when the controller
behaves like an open circuit, the dc voltage source will charge the capacitor
via the resistor R, toward a value of Vs volts. But once the capacitor voltage
reaches Vmax, the controller behaves like a short circuit, enabling the
capacitor to discharge. Once the capacitor discharge is complete, the
controller again acts like an open circuit and the capacitor starts to recharge.
This cycle of charging and discharging the capacitor establishes the desired
heart rhythm, as shown in Fig. 7.54.
Figure 7.54 Capacitor voltage
versus time for the circuit in
Fig. 7.55.

Figure 7.54 Full Alternative Text
In drawing Fig. 7.54, we have chosen t=0 at the instant the capacitor starts to
charge. This plot also assumes that the circuit has reached the repetitive stage
of its operation and that the time to discharge the capacitor is negligible when
compared to the recharge time. We need an equation for vC(t) as a function
of Vs, R, and C to design the artificial pacemaker circuit.
To begin the analysis, we assume that the circuit has been in operation for a
long time. Let t=0 at the instant when the capacitor has completely
discharged and the controller is acting as an open circuit. From the circuit we
find the initial and final values of the capacitor voltage and the circuit’s time
constant:
V0=vC(0)=0;
Vf=vC(∞)=Vs; and τ=RC.
To find the capacitor voltage while the capacitor is charging, substitute the
initial and final values of the capacitor voltage and the circuit’s time constant
into Eq. 7.23 and simplify to get
vC(t)=Vs (1−e−t/RC).

Suppose the controller is programmed to generate an electrical pulse that
stimulates the heart when vC=0.75 Vs=Vmax. Given values of R and C, we
can determine the resulting heart rate, H, in beats per minute as follows:
H=60−RC ln 0.25 [beats per minute]
A more realistic design problem requires you to calculate the value of
resistance, R, given Vmax as a percentage of Vs, C, and the desired heart rate
in beats per minute. Developing an equation for resistance, R, is the focus of
Problem 7.106.

Summary
A first-order circuit may be reduced to a Thévenin (or Norton)
equivalent connected to either a single equivalent inductor or capacitor.
(See page 220.)
The natural response is the currents and voltages that exist when stored
energy is released to a circuit that contains no independent sources. (See
page 220.)
The time constant of an RL circuit equals the equivalent inductance
divided by the Thévenin resistance as viewed from the terminals of the
equivalent inductor. (See page 223.)
The time constant of an RC circuit equals the equivalent capacitance
times the Thévenin resistance as viewed from the terminals of the
equivalent capacitor. (See page 229.)
The step response is the currents and voltages that result from abrupt
changes in dc sources connected to a circuit. Stored energy may or may
not be present at the time the abrupt changes take place. (See page 233.)
Analysis Method 7.5 can be used to find the solution for the natural and
step responses of both RL and RC circuits:
1. Step 1: Identify the variable x(t), which is the quantity that is
required to be continuous for all time. This is the inductor current
in RL circuits and the capacitor voltage in RC circuits.
2. Step 2: Calculate the initial value X0, by analyzing the circuit to
find x(t) for t<0.
3. Step 3: Calculate the time constant, τ, for the circuit by analyzing
the circuit for t≥0 to find the equivalent resistance attached to the
inductor or capacitor. For RL circuits, τ=L/R, and for RC circuits,
τ=RC.

4. Step 4: Calculate the final value Xf, by analyzing the circuit to find
x(t) as t→∞. If the circuit exhibits a natural response, Xf=0, so no
calculation is needed.
5. Step 5: Write the equation for x(t) by substituting the initial value
X0, the time constant τ, and the final value Xf, into the expression
x(t)= Xf+(X0−Xf)e−t/τ, t≥0.
6. Step 6: Use x(t) to find any other quantities of interest in the circuit.
(See page 242.)
Sequential switching in first-order circuits is analyzed by dividing the
analysis into time intervals corresponding to specific switch positions.
Initial values for a particular interval are determined from the solution
corresponding to the immediately preceding interval. (See page 246.)
An unbounded response occurs when the Thévenin resistance is
negative, which is possible when the first-order circuit contains
dependent sources. (See page 250.)
An integrating amplifier consists of an ideal op amp, a capacitor in the
negative feedback branch, and a resistor in series with the signal source.
It outputs the integral of the signal source, within specified limits that
avoid saturating the op amp. (See page 252.)

3. 7.99 PSPICEMULTISIM The circuit shown in Fig. P 7.99 is known as
an astable multivibrator and finds wide application in pulse circuits. The
purpose of this problem is to relate the charging and discharging of the
capacitors to the operation of the circuit. The key to analyzing the circuit
is to understand the behavior of the ideal transistor switches T1 and T2.
The circuit is designed so that the switches automatically alternate
between on and off. When T1 is off, T2 is on and vice versa. Thus in the
analysis of this circuit, we assume a switch is either on or off. We also
assume that the ideal transistor switch can change its state
instantaneously. In other words, it can snap from off to on and vice
versa. When a transistor switch is on, (1) the base current ib is greater
than zero, (2) the terminal voltage vbe is zero, and (3) the terminal
voltage vce is zero. Thus, when a transistor switch is on, it presents a
short circuit between the terminals b,e and c,e. When a transistor switch
is off, (1) the terminal voltage vbe is negative, (2) the base current is
zero, and (3) there is an open circuit between the terminals c,e. Thus
when a transistor switch is off, it presents an open circuit between the
terminals b,e and c,e. Assume that T2 has been on and has just snapped
off, while T1 has been off and has just snapped on. You may assume
that at this instance, C2 is charged to the supply voltage VCC, and the
charge on C1 is zero. Also assume C1=C2 and R1=R2=10RL.

Chapter Objectives
1. Be able to determine the natural response and the step response of

2. Be able to determine the natural response and the step response of series
RLC circuits.
In this chapter, we discuss the natural response and step response of circuits
containing a resistor, an inductor, and a capacitor, known as RLC circuits.
We limit our analysis to two simple structures: the parallel RLC circuit and
the series RLC circuit.
We begin with the natural response of a parallel RLC circuit and cover this
material in two sections: one section discusses the solution of the second-
order differential equation that describes the circuit, and the other presents the
three distinct forms that the solution can take. After introducing these three
forms, we show that the same forms apply to the step response of a parallel
RLC circuit as well as to the natural and step responses of series RLC
circuits. The chapter concludes with an introduction to an op-amp-based
circuit whose output is also characterized by a second-order differential
equation.
Parallel RLC Circuits
We characterize the natural response of a parallel RLC circuit by finding the
voltage across the parallel branches created by the release of energy stored in
the inductor or capacitor, or both. The circuit is shown in Fig. 8.1 on page
274. The initial voltage on the capacitor, V0, represents the initial energy
stored in the capacitor. The initial current in the inductor, I0, represents the
initial energy stored in the inductor. You can find the individual branch
currents after determining the voltage.

Practical Perspective
Clock for Computer Timing
The digital circuits found in most computers require a timing signal that
synchronizes the operation of the circuits. Consider a laptop computer whose
processor speed is 2 GHz. This means that the central processing unit for this
computer can perform about 2×109 simple operations every second.
The timing signal, produced by a clock generator chip, is typically a square
wave with the required clock frequency. The square wave is obtained from a
sinusoidal wave with the required clock frequency. Typically, the sinusoidal
wave is generated by a precisely cut quartz crystal with an applied voltage.
The crystal produces a stable frequency suitable for synchronizing digital
circuits.
We can also generate a sinusoidal wave using a circuit with an inductor and a
capacitor. By choosing the values of inductance and capacitance, we can
create a sinusoid with a specific frequency. We will examine such a design
once we have presented the fundamental concepts of second-order circuits.

8.1 Introduction to the Natural
Response of a Parallel RLC Circuit
To find the natural response of the circuit shown in Fig. 8.1, we begin by
deriving the differential equation that the voltage v satisfies. We choose to
find the voltage because it is the same for each component. Once we know
the voltage, we can find every branch current by using the current–voltage
relationship for the branch component. We write the differential equation for
the voltage using KCL to sum the currents leaving the top node, where each
current is expressed as a function of the unknown voltage v:
vR+1L∫0tv dτ+I0+Cdvdt=0.
We eliminate the integral in the KCL equation by differentiating once with
respect to t, and because I0 is a constant, we get
1R dvdt+vL+Cd2vdt2=0.
We now divide the equation by the capacitance C and arrange the derivatives
in descending order:
d2vdt2+1RC dvdt + vLC=0. (8.1)
Equation 8.1 is an ordinary, second-order differential equation with constant
coefficients because it describes a circuit with both an inductor and a
capacitor. Therefore, we also call RLC circuits second-order circuits.
The General Solution of the Second-
Order Differential Equation
We can’t solve Eq. 8.1 by separating the variables and integrating, as we
were able to do with the first-order equations in Chapter 7. Instead, we solve

Eq. 8.1 by assuming that the voltage is of the form
v=Aest, (8.2)
where A and s are unknown constants.
Why did we choose an exponential form for v, given in Eq. 8.2? The reason
is that Eq. 8.1 requires the sum of the second derivative of v, and the first
derivative of v times a constant, and v times a constant equal zero for all
values of t. This can occur only if higher-order derivatives of v have the same
form as v. The exponential function satisfies this criterion. Furthermore, note
that the solutions of the first-order equations we derived in Chapter 7 were all
exponential; thus, it seems reasonable to assume that the solution of the
second-order equation is also exponential.
If Eq. 8.2 is a solution of Eq. 8.1, it must satisfy Eq. 8.1 for all values of t.
Substituting Eq. 8.2 into Eq. 8.1 generates the expression
As2est+ AsRCest+ AestLC=0,
or
Aest(s2+sRC+1LC)=0,
which can be satisfied for all values of t only if A is zero or the parenthetical
term is zero because est≠0 for any finite values of st. We cannot use A=0 as a
general solution because to do so implies that the voltage is zero for all time
—a physical impossibility if energy is stored in either the inductor or
capacitor. Therefore, in order for Eq. 8.2 to be a solution of Eq. 8.1, the
parenthetical term must be zero, or
Characteristic Equation, Parallel
RLC Circuit
s2+sRC+1LC=0.(8.3)

Equation 8.3 is called the characteristic equation of the differential equation
because the roots of this quadratic equation determine the mathematical
character of v(t).
The two roots of Eq. 8.3 are
s1=−12RC+(12RC)2− 1LC,
s2=−12RC−(12RC)2− 1LC .
If either root is substituted into Eq. 8.2, v satisfies the differential equation in
Eq. 8.1, regardless of the value of A. Therefore, both
v=A1es1t and
v=A2es2t
satisfy Eq. 8.1. Denoting these two solutions v1 and v2, respectively, we can
show that their sum also is a solution. Specifically, if we let
v=v1+v2=A1es1t+A2es2t,
then
dvdt=A1s1es1t+ A2s2es2t,
d2vdt2=A1s12es1t+A2s22es2t.
Substituting these expressions for v and its first and second derivatives into
Eq. 8.1 gives
A1es1t(s12+ 1RCs1+1LC)+A2es2t(s22+1RCs2+1LC)=0.
But each parenthetical term is zero because by definition s1 and s2 are roots
of the characteristic equation. Hence, the natural response of the parallel RLC
circuit shown in Fig. 8.1 is
v=A1es1t+A2es2t. (8.4)
In Eq. 8.4, the constants s1 and s2, which are the roots of the characteristic
equation, are determined by the circuit parameters R, L, and C. The constants
A1 and A2 are determined by the initial conditions for the inductor and the

capacitor.
To find the natural response (Eq. 8.4), we begin by finding the roots of the
characteristic equation, s1 and s2, which we first wrote in terms of the circuit
parameters. We now rewrite them as follows:
s1=−α+α2−ω02, (8.5)
s2=−α−α2−ω02, (8.6)
where

These results are summarized in Table 8.1.

Parameters of the Parallel RLC
Circuit

Table 8.1 Full Alternative Text
The exponent of e must be dimensionless, so both s1 and s2 (and hence α and
ω0) must have the dimension of the inverse of time, or frequency. To
distinguish among the frequencies s1, s2, α, and ω0, we use the following
terminology: s1 and s2 are the complex frequencies, α is the neper frequency,
and ω0 is the resonant radian frequency. The full significance of this
terminology unfolds as we move through the remaining chapters of this book.
These frequencies all have the dimension of angular frequency per time. For
the complex frequencies, the neper frequency, and the resonant radian
frequency, we specify values using the unit radians per second (rad/s).
The form of the roots s1 and s2 depends on the values of α and ω0. There are
three possibilities.
If ω02<α2, both roots will be real and distinct. For reasons to be
discussed later, we call the voltage response overdamped.

If ω02>α2, both s1 and s2 will be complex and, in addition, will be
conjugates of each other. In this situation, we call the voltage response
underdamped.
If ω02=α2, s1 and s2 will be real and equal. Here, we call the voltage
response critically damped.
As we shall see, damping affects the way the voltage response reaches its
final (or steady-state) value. We discuss each case separately in Section 8.2.
Example 8.1 illustrates how the values of R, L, and C determine the
numerical values of s1 and s2.

Solution
1. For the given values of R, L, and C,
α=12RC=12(200)(0.2×10−6)=12,500rad/s,
ω02=1LC=1(50×10−3)(0.2×10−6)=108rad2/s2.
From Eqs. 8.5 and 8.6,
s1=−12,500+(12,500)2−108=−12,500+7500=−5000 rad/s,s1=
−12,500−(12,500)2−108=−12,500−7500=−20,000 rad/s.
2. The voltage response is overdamped because ω02<α2.
3. For R=312.5 Ω,
α=12RC=12(312.5)(0.2×10−6)=8000rad/s,

Since ω02 remains at 108 rad2/s2,
s 1 = −8000+ ( 8000 ) 2 − 10 8 = −8000+j6000rad/s,
s 2 = −8000− ( 8000 ) 2 − 10 8 = −8000−j6000rad/s.
(In electrical engineering, the imaginary number −1 is represented by the
letter j because the letter i represents current.)
In this case, the voltage response is underdamped since ω02>α2.

8.2 The Forms of the Natural
Response of a Parallel RLC Circuit
In this section, we find the natural response for each of the three types of
damping: overdamped, underdamped, and critically damped. As we have
already seen, the values of s1 and s2 determine the type of damping. We need
to find values for the two coefficients A1 and A2 so that we can completely
characterize the natural response given in Eq. 8.4. This requires two
equations based on the following observations:
The initial value of the voltage in Eq. 8.4 must be the same as the initial
value of the voltage in the circuit.
The initial value of the first derivative of the voltage in Eq. 8.4 must be
the same as the initial value of the first derivative of the voltage in the
circuit.
As we will see, the natural-response equations, as well as the equations for
evaluating the unknown coefficients, are slightly different for each of the
three types of damping. This is why the first task that presents itself when
finding the natural response is to determine whether the response is
overdamped, underdamped, or critically damped.
The Overdamped Response
When the roots of the characteristic equation are real and distinct, the
response of a parallel RLC circuit is overdamped. The solution for the
voltage is
Parallel RLC Natural Response:

Overdamped
v=A1es1t+ A2es2t,(8.9)
where s1 and s2 are the roots of the characteristic equation. The constants A1
and A2 are determined by the initial conditions, specifically from the values
of v(0+) and dv(0+)/dt, which in turn are determined from the initial voltage
on the capacitor, V0, and the initial current in the inductor, I0.
To determine the values of A1 and A2, we need two independent equations.
The first equation sets the initial value v from Eq. 8.9 equal to the initial
value of v in the circuit, which is the initial voltage for the capacitor, V0. The
resulting equation is
v(0+)=A1+A2=V0. (8.10)
The second equation sets the initial value of dv/dt from Eq. 8.9 equal to the
initial value of dv/dt in the circuit. The initial value of dv/dt from Eq. 8.9 is
dv(0+)dt=s1A1+s2A2.
But how do we find the initial value of dv/dt from the circuit? Remember that
dv/dt appears in the equation relating voltage and current for a capacitor,
iC=Cdvdt.
We can solve the capacitor equation for dv/dt and find its initial value in
terms of the initial current in the capacitor:
dv(0+)dt=iC(0+)C.
Now we use KCL to find the initial current in the capacitor. We know that the
sum of the three branch currents at t=0+ must be zero. The initial current in
the resistive branch is the initial voltage V0 divided by the resistance, and the
initial current in the inductive branch is I0. Using the reference system
depicted in Fig. 8.5, we obtain

iC(0+)=−V0R−I0.
Now we have the second equation needed to find the values of A1 and A2 in
Eq. 8.9:
dv(0+)dt=A1s1+A2s2=1C(−V0R−I0). (8.11)
The method for finding the voltage for the parallel RLC circuit in Fig. 8.5 is
as follows:
1. Step 1: Determine the initial values of capacitor voltage, V0, and
inductor current, I0, by analyzing the parallel RLC circuit for t<0.
2. Step 2: Determine the values of the neper frequency, α, and the resonant
radian frequency, ω0, using the values of R, L, and C and the equations
in Table 8.1.
3. Step 3: Compare α2 and ω02. If α2>ω02, the response is overdamped:
v(t)=A1es1t+A2es2t,t≥0.
4. Step 4: If the response is overdamped, calculate the values of s1 and s2
from α and ω0, using the equations in Table 8.1.
5. Step 5: If the response is overdamped, calculate the values of A1 and A2
by solving Eqs. 8.10 and 8.11 simultaneously:
A1+A2=V0;
A1s1+A2s2=1C(−V0R−I0).
6. Step 6: Write the equation for v(t) from Step 3 using the results from
Steps 4 and 5. Find any desired branch current using the relationship
between voltage and current for the component in the branch.
A condensed version of this method is given in Analysis Method 8.1.

parallel RLC circuit.

Solution
1. We use Analysis Method 8.1 to find the voltage.
1. Step 1: Determine the initial values of capacitor voltage, V0, and
inductor current, I0; since these values are given in the problem
statement, no circuit analysis is required.
2. Step 2: Determine the values of α and ω0 using the equations in
Table 8.1:
α=12RC=12(200)(0.2×10−6)=12,500 rad/s,
ω02=1LC=1(50×10−3)(0.2×10−6)=108 rad2/s2.
3. Step 3: Compare α2 and ω02; since α2>ω02, the response is
overdamped and
v(t)=A1es1t+A2es2t, t≥0.

4. Step 4: Since the response is overdamped, calculate the values of s1
and s2:
s1=-a+a2-ω02=-12,500+(12,500)2-
108=-12,500+7500=-5000 rad/s;s2=-a-a2-ω02=-12,500-(12,500)2-
108=-12,500-7500=-20,000 rad/s.
5. Step 5: Since the response is overdamped, calculate the values of
A1 and A2 by simultaneously solving
A1+A2=V0=12;
A1s1+A2s2=1C(−V0R−I0) so
−5000A1−20,000A2=10.2×10−6(−12200−0.03)=−450,000.
Solving,
A1=−14 V and A2=26 V.
6. Step 6: Write the equation for v(t) using the results from Steps 4
and 5:
v(t)=(−14e−5000t+26e−20,000t) V, t≥0.

Example 8.3 Calculating Branch
Currents in the Natural Response of
a Parallel RLC Circuit
Derive the expressions for the three branch currents iR, iL, and iC in
Example 8.2 (Fig. 8.6) during the time the stored energy is being released.
Solution
We know the voltage across the three branches from the solution in Example
8.2 is
v(t)=(−14e−5000t+26e−20,000t) V, t≥0.
The current in the resistive branch is then
iR(t)=v(t)200=(−70e−5000t+130e−20,000t) mA, t≥0.
There are two ways to find the current in the inductive branch. One way is to
use the integral relationship that exists between the current and the voltage at
the terminals of an inductor:
iL(t)=1L∫0tvL(x) dx+I0.
A second approach is to find the current in the capacitive branch first and
then use the fact that iR+iL+iC=0. Let’s use this approach. The current in the
capacitive branch is
i C ( t ) = C dv dt = 0.2× 10 −6 ( 70,000 e −5000t −520,000 e −20,000t ) = (
14 e −5000t −104 e −20,000t ) mA, t≥ 0 + .

Now find the inductive branch current from the relationship
i L ( t ) = − i R ( t )− i C ( t ) = ( 56 e −5000t −26 e −20,000t ) mA, t≥0.
We leave it to you, in Assessment Problem 8.2, to show that the integral
relationship between voltage and current in an inductor leads to the same
result. Note that the expression for iL agrees with the initial inductor current,
as it must.

The Underdamped Voltage
Response
When ω02>α2, the roots of the characteristic equation are complex numbers,
and the response is underdamped. For convenience, we express the roots s1
and s2 as

s 1 =−a+ −( ω 0 2 − a 2 ) =−a+ j ω 0 2 − a 2 =−a+j ω d , (8.12)
s 2 =−a−j ω d , (8.13)
where
Damped Radian Frequency
ωd=ω02−α2.(8.14)
The term ωd is called the damped radian frequency. Later we explain the
reason for this terminology.
The underdamped voltage response of a parallel RLC circuit is
Parallel RLC Natural Response
v(t)=B1e−αt cos ωdt+B2e−αt sin ωdt,(8.15)
which follows from Eq. 8.9. In making the transition from Eq. 8.9 to Eq.
8.15, we use the Euler identity:
e±jθ= cos θ±j sin θ.
Thus,
v( t ) = A 1 e ( −α+j ω d )t + A 2 e −( α+j ω d )t = A 1 e −αt e j ω d t + A 2 e
−αt e −j ω d t = e −αt ( A 1  cos  ω d t+j A 1  sin  ω d t+ A 2  cos  ω d t−j A 2
sin  ω d t) = e −αt [ ( A 1 + A 2 ) cos  ω d t+j( A 1 − A 2 ) sin  ω d t ].
At this point in the transition from Eq. 8.9 to Eq. 8.15, replace the arbitrary
constants A1+A2 and j(A1−A2) with new arbitrary constants denoted B1 and
B2 to get
v = e −αt ( B 1  cos  ω d t+ B 2  sin  ω d t ) = B 1 e −αt  cos  ω d t+ B 2 e −αt
sin  ω d t.

The constants B1 and B2 are real, not complex, because the voltage is a real
function. Don’t be misled by the fact that B2=j(A1−A2). In this underdamped
case, A1 and A2 are complex conjugates, and thus B1 and B2 are real. (See
Problems 8.22 and 8.23.) Defining the underdamped response in terms of the
coefficients B1 and B2 yields a simple expression for the voltage, v. We
determine B1 and B2 in the same way that we found A1 and A2 for the
overdamped response—by solving two simultaneous equations. The first
equation sets the initial value v from Eq. 8.15 equal to the initial value of v in
the circuit. The second equation sets the initial value of dv/dt from Eq. 8.15
equal to the initial value of dv/dt in the circuit. Note that the initial values of
v and dv/dt in the circuit are the same in both the underdamped and
overdamped cases. For the underdamped response, the two simultaneous
equations that determine B1 and B2 are
υ( 0 + )= B 1 = V 0 , (8.216)
dυ( 0 + ) dt =−α B 1 + ω d B 2 = 1 C ( − V 0 R − I 0 ). (8.17)
The overall process for finding the underdamped response is the same as that
for the overdamped response, although the response equations and the
simultaneous equations used to find the constants are slightly different. We
can modify Steps 3, 4, and 5 in the method for finding the voltage for the
parallel RLC circuit to accommodate the differences.
1. Step 3: Compare α2 and ω02. If α2>ω02, the response is overdamped:
v(t)=A1es1t+A2es2t, t≥0.
If α2<ω02, the response is overdamped:
v(t)=B1eαt cos ωdt+B2eαt sin ωdt, t≥0.
2. Step 4: If the response is overdamped, calculate the values of s1 and s2
from α and ω0, using the equations in Table 8.1. If the response is
underdamped, calculate the value of ωd from
ωd=ω02−α2.
3. Step 5: If the response is overdamped, calculate the values of A1 and A2

by solving Eqs. 8.10 and 8.11 simultaneously:
A 1 + A 2 = V 0 ; A 1 s 1 + A 2 s 2 = 1 C ( − V 0 R − I 0 ).
If the response is underdamped, calculate the values of B1 and B2 by
solving Eqs. 8.16 and 8.17 simultaneously:
B1=V0;
−αB1+ωdB2=1C(−V0R−I0).
These modified steps are condensed in Analysis Method 8.2. We examine the
characteristics of the underdamped response following Example 8.4, which
analyzes a circuit whose response is underdamped.

Characteristics of the Underdamped
Response
Let’s look at the general nature of the underdamped response. From Eq. 8.15
and the plot in Fig. 8.9 we know that the voltage alternates, or oscillates
between positive and negative values. The voltage oscillates because there
are two types of energy-storage elements in the circuit: the inductor and the

capacitor. (A mechanical analogy of this electric circuit is that of a mass
suspended on a spring, where oscillation is possible because energy can be
stored in both the spring and the moving mass.) The oscillation rate is fixed
by vd and the oscillation amplitude decreases exponentially at a rate
determined by α, so α is also called the damping factor or damping
coefficient. That explains why ωd is called the damped radian frequency.
If there is no damping, α=0 and the frequency of oscillation is ω0. Whenever
there is a dissipative element, R, in the circuit, α is not zero and the frequency
of oscillation, ωd, is less than ω0. Thus, when α is not zero, the frequency of
oscillation is said to be damped. As the dissipative losses in the circuit
decrease, the persistence of the oscillations increases, and the frequency of
the oscillations approaches ω0. In other words, as R→∞, the energy
dissipation in the circuit in Fig. 8.8 approaches zero because p=v2/R→0. As
R→∞, α→0 and ωd→ω0; thus, the voltage oscillates and its amplitude does
not decay.
In Example 8.4, if R is increased to infinity, the solution for v(t) becomes
v(t)=98 sin 1000t V, t≥0.
In this case, the oscillation is sustained at a frequency of 1000 rad/s and the
maximum amplitude of the voltage is 98 V.
Let’s examine the qualitative differences between an underdamped and an
overdamped response. In an underdamped system, the response oscillates, or
“bounces,” about its final value. This oscillation is also called ringing. In an
overdamped system, the response approaches its final value without ringing
or in what is sometimes described as a “sluggish” manner. When specifying
the desired response of a second-order system, you have two options:
Reach the final value in the shortest time possible, without concern for
the small oscillations about that final value that will eventually cease.
Therefore, design the system components to achieve an underdamped
response.
Do not allow the response to exceed its final value, perhaps to ensure
that components are not damaged. Therefore, design the system

components to achieve an overdamped response, and accept a relatively
slow rise to the final value.
The Critically Damped Voltage
Response
The response of a parallel RLC circuit is critically damped when ω02=α2, or
ω0=α. When a circuit is critically damped, the response is on the verge of
oscillating, and the roots of the characteristic equation are real and equal:
s1=s2=−α=−12RC. (8.18)
If we substitute s1=s2=−α, into the voltage equation (Eq. 8.9), the equation
becomes
v=(A1+A2)e−αt=A0e−αt,
where A0 is an arbitrary constant. But this expression for v cannot satisfy two
independent initial conditions (V0, I0) with only one constant, A0.
Thus, when the roots of the characteristic equation are equal, the solution for
the differential equation (Eq. 8.1) must take a different form, namely,
Parallel RLC Natural Response–
Critically Damped
v(t)=D1te−αt+D2e−αt.(8.19)
This solution involves a simple exponential term plus the product of a linear
term and an exponential term. The justification of Eq. 8.19 is left for an
introductory course in differential equations.
There are only two unknowns in Eq. 8.19, D1 and D2. We find their values in

the same way we found A1 and A2 for the overdamped response and B1 and
B2for the underdamped response—by solving two simultaneous equations.
One equation sets the initial value v from Eq. 8.19 equal to the initial value of
v in the circuit. The second equation sets the initial value of dv/dt from Eq.
8.19 equal to the initial value of dv/dt in the circuit. Note that the initial
values of v and dv/dt in the circuit are the same in the underdamped,
overdamped, and critically damped cases. For the critically damped response,
the two simultaneous equations that determine D1 and D2 are
υ( 0 + )= D 2 = V 0 , (8.20)
dυ( 0 + ) dt = D 1 −α D 2 = 1 C ( − V 0 R − I 0 ). (8.21)
The overall process for finding the critically damped response is the same as
that for the overdamped and underdamped responses, but again, the response
equation and the simultaneous equations used to find the constants are
slightly different. We can modify Steps 3, 4, and 5 in the method for finding
the voltage for the parallel RLC circuit to accommodate the differences.
1. Step 3: Compare α2 and ω02. If α2>ω02, the response is overdamped:
v(t)=A1es1t+A2es2t, t≥0.
If α2<ω02, the response is overdamped:
v(t)=B1eαt cos ωdt+B2eαt sin ωdt, t≥0.
If α2=ω02, the response is critically damped:
v(t)=D1te−αt+D2e−αt, t≥0.
2. Step 4: If the response is overdamped, calculate the values of s1 and s2
from α and ω0, using the equations in Table 8.1. If the response is
underdamped, calculate the value of ωd from
ωd=ω02−α2.
If the response is critically damped, you can skip this step.

3. Step 5: If the response is overdamped, calculate the values of A1 and A2
by solving Eqs. 8.10 and 8.11 simultaneously:
A1+A2=V0;
A1s1+A2s2=1C(−V0R−I0).
If the response is underdamped, calculate the values of B1 and B2 by
solving Eqs. 8.16 and 8.17 simultaneously:
B1=V0;
If the response is critically damped, calculate the values of D1 and D2
by solving Eqs. 8.20 and 8.21 simultaneously:
D 2 = V 0 ; D 1 −α D 2 = 1 C ( − V 0 R − I 0 ).

Analysis Method 8.3 The natural response of parallel RLC circuits.
You will rarely encounter critically damped systems in practice, largely
because ω0 must equal α exactly. Both of these quantities depend on circuit
parameters, and in a real circuit it is very difficult to choose component
values that satisfy an exact equality relationship. Even so, Example 8.5
illustrates the approach for finding the critically damped response of a
parallel RLC circuit.
(Note that the equations in the last three rows assume that the reference
direction for the current in every component is in the direction of the
reference voltage drop across that component.)

in a critically damped voltage response.
2. Calculate v(t) for t≥0.
3. Plot v(t) versus t for 0≤t≤7 ms.
Solution
1. From Example 8.4, we know that ω02=106. Therefore, for critical
damping,
α=103=12RC,

or
R=106(2000)(0.125)=4000 Ω.
2. Follow the steps in Analysis Method 8.3 to find the voltage v.
1. Step 1: Determine the initial values of capacitor voltage, V0, and
inductor current, I0; since these values are given in Example 8.4,
no circuit analysis is required.
2. Step 2: From part (a), we know that α=ω0=1000 rad/s.
3. Step 3: Compare α2 and ω02; since α2=ω02, the response is
critically damped and
v(t)=D1te−αt+D2e−αt, t≥0.
4. Step 4: Since the response is critically damped, this step is not
needed.
5. Step 5: Since the response is critically damped, calculate the values
of D1 and D2:
D 2 = V 0 = 0; D 1 −α D 2 = 1 C ( − V 0 R − I 0 ) so D 1 −1000
D 2 = 1 125× 10 −9 ( −0 4000 −( −12.25× 10 −3 ) ) = 98,000.
Therefore,
D1=98,000 V/s and D2=0 V

8.3 The Step Response of a Parallel
RLC Circuit
Now we find the step response of a parallel RLC circuit, represented by the
circuit shown in Fig. 8.11. The step response results from the sudden
application of a dc current source. Energy may or may not be stored in the
circuit when the current source is applied. We develop a general approach to
the step response by finding the current in the inductive branch (iL).
Figure 8.11 A circuit used to
describe the step response of a
parallel RLC circuit.
Figure 8.11 Full Alternative Text
Why do we find the inductor current? Remember that for the natural
response, we found the voltage because it was the same for all of the parallel-
connected components, and we could use the voltage to find the current in
any branch. But to find the step response, we need to satisfy three constraints.

Two of the constraints are established by the initial values of the capacitor
voltage and the inductor current, just as in the natural-response problem. For
the step-response problem, a third constraint arises from a nonzero final value
that exists because there is a source in the circuit for t≥0.
We draw the circuit in Fig. 8.11 as t→∞. In the presence of the dc current
source, the capacitor behaves like an open circuit, and the inductor behaves
like a short circuit, which shunts the resistor. The resulting circuit is shown in
Fig. 8.12, where we see that the only nonzero final value is the inductor
current. This explains why we find the inductor current and not the voltage in
the parallel RLC step response.
Figure 8.12 The circuit in Fig.
8.11 as t→∞
Figure 8.12 Full Alternative Text
To find the inductor current iL in the circuit in Fig. 8.11, we begin with a
KCL equation for the circuit’s top node:
iL+iR+ iC=I,
or
iL+vR+ Cdvdt=I. (8.22)

Because
v=LdiLdt,
we get
dvdt=Ld2iLdt2.
Now we can write Eq. 8.22 using only the inductor current and its first and
second derivatives, to give
iL+LRdiLdt+LCd2iLdt2=I.
For convenience, we divide through by LC and rearrange terms:
d2iLdt2+1RC diLdt+iLLC=ILC. (8.23)
Compare Eq. 8.23 with Eq. 8.1—they have the same form, but note the
nonzero constant on the right-hand side of Eq. 8.23. Before showing how to
solve Eq. 8.23 directly, we find its solution indirectly. When we know the
solution of Eq. 8.23, explaining the direct approach will be easier.
The Indirect Approach
We can solve for iL indirectly by first finding the voltage v. We use the
techniques introduced in Section 8.2 because the differential equation that v
must satisfy is identical to Eq. 8.1. To see this, we simply return to Eq. 8.22
and express iL as a function of v; thus
1L∫0tvdτ+I0+vR+Cdvdt=I,
where I0 is the initial current in the inductor. Differentiating once with
respect to t reduces the right-hand side to zero because I is a constant and
eliminates I0 from the left-hand side for the same reason. Thus
vL+1R dvdt+ Cd2vdt2=0,

or
d2vdt2+1RCdvdt+vLC=0.
As discussed in Section 8.2, the solution for v depends on the roots of the
characteristic equation. Thus, the three possible solutions are
v= A 1 e s 1 t  +  A 2 e s 2 t , v= B 1 e −αt  cos  ω d t+  B 2 e −αt  sin  ω d t, v=
D 1 t e −αt +  D 2 e −αt .
A word of caution: Because there is a source in the circuit for t>0, you must
take into account the value of the source current at t=0+ when you evaluate
the coefficients in the three expressions for v.
To find the three possible solutions for iL, we substitute the three expressions
for v into Eq. 8.22. When this has been done, you should be able to verify
that the three solutions for iL will be
Parallel RLC Step-Response Forms
i L =I+ A 1 ' e s 1 t + A 2 ' e s 2 t  ( overdamped ) (8.24)
i L =I+ B 1 ' e −αt  cos  ω d t+ B 2 ' e −αt  sin  ω d t ( underdamped ) (8.25)
i L =I+ D 1 ' t e −αt   D 2 ' e −αt  ( critically damped ) (8.26)
where A′1, A′2, B′1, B′2, D′1, and D′2, are arbitrary constants. In each case,
the primed constants can be found indirectly in terms of the arbitrary
constants associated with the voltage solution. However, this approach is
cumbersome.
The Direct Approach
As we have just seen, the solution for a second-order differential equation
with a constant forcing function equals the forced response, plus a response
function identical in form to the natural response. Thus, we can always write
the solution for the step response in the form

i=If+{function of the same formas the natural response},
or
v=Vf+{function of the same formas the natural response},
where If and Vf represent the final value of the response function. The final
value may be zero, as we saw for the voltage v in the circuit in Fig. 8.12.
As we have already noted, the only quantity with a nonzero final value in the
circuit of Fig. 8.11 is the inductor current. Let’s look at how to alter the
parallel RLC natural-response method to construct a method for finding the
parallel RLC step response for the inductor current.
1. Step 1: Determine the initial values of capacitor voltage, V0, and
inductor current, I0, by analyzing the parallel RLC circuit for t<0, In this
step, we also need to find the final value of the inductor current, If, by
analyzing the circuit as t→∞.
2. Step 2: Determine the values of the neper frequency, α, and the resonant
radian frequency, ω0, using the values of R, L, and C. No modifications
are needed for this step.
3. Step 3: Compare α2 and ω02. Here we replace the natural response for
the voltage with the step response for the inductor current, given in Eqs.
8.24–8.26.
4. Step 4: If the response is overdamped, calculate the values of s1 and s2.
If the response is underdamped, calculate the value of ωd. If the
response is critically damped, you can skip this step. No changes are
needed in this step.
5. Step 5: Calculate the values of the A′, B′, and D′ coefficients by
simultaneously solving two equations. To construct the first equation,
we evaluate the expression for iL(t) from Step 3 at t=0+ and set it equal
to the initial inductor current, I0. For example, in the overdamped case
the first equation is

If+A′1+A′2=I0;
in the underdamped case, the first equation is
If+B′1=I0;
and in the critically damped case, the first equation is
If+D′2=I0.
To construct the second equation, we find the diL/dt from the inductor
current in Step 3, evaluate it at t=0+, and set it equal to the initial value
of diL/dt from the circuit. How do we find diL/dt from the circuit? We
use the relationship between voltage and current in an inductor to get
diL(0+)dt=vL(0+)L=V0L.
In the overdamped case, the second equation is
A′1s1+A′2s2=V0L;
in the underdamped case, the second equation is
−αB′1+ωdB′2=V0L;
and in the critically damped case, the second equation is
D′1−αD′2=V0L.
6. Step 6: Write the equation for iL(t) from Step 3 using the results from
Steps 4 and 5. Find the voltage v and the remaining branch currents
using the relationship between voltage and current for the component in
each branch.
The steps for finding the step response of a parallel RLC circuit are
condensed into Analysis Method 8.4. All of the equations you will need are
collected in Table 8.3. Examples 8.6–8.10 illustrate how to use Table 8.3 and

Figure 8.13 Full Alternative Text
Solution

Follow the steps in Analysis Method 8.4.
1. Step 1: The initial values of capacitor voltage, V0, and inductor current,
I0 are both zero because the initial stored energy is zero. As t→∞, the
capacitor behaves like an open circuit and the inductor behaves like a
short circuit that shunts the resistor, so all of the current from the source
is in the inductor. Thus, If=24 mA.
2. Step 2: Using the equations in the second row of Table 8.3,
α=12RC=12(400)(25×10−9)=50,000rad/s;
ω0=1LC=1(0.025)(25×10−9)=40,000rad/s.
3. Step 3: Compare α2 and ω02; since α2>ω02, the response is
overdamped and from Table 8.3,
iL(t)=If+A′1es1t+A′2es2t, t≥0.
4. Step 4: Calculate s1 and s2 using the equations in the third row of Table
8.3:
s 1 = −α+ α 2 − ω 0 2 =−50,000+ 50, 000 2 −40, 000 2 =
−50,000+30,000=−20,000rad/s; s 2 = −α− α 2 − ω 0 2 =−50,000− 50,
000 2 −40, 000 2 = −50,000−30,000=−80,000rad/s.
5. Step 5: Calculate the values of A1′ and A2′ by simultaneously solving
the equations from row 4 in Table 8.3:
If+A′1+A′2=Io so 0.024+A′1+A′2=0;
s1A′1+s2A′2=VoL so −20,000A′1−80,000A′2=0.
Solving,
A′1=−32mA and A′2=8mA.
6. Step 6: Write the equation from Step 3 using the results from Steps 4

Solution
Follow the steps in Analysis Method 8.4.
1. Step 1: From Step 1 of Example 8.6, V0=0, I0=0, If=24 mA.
2. Step 2: Since only R has changed, ω0=40,000 rad/s, from Example 8.6
and
α=12RC=12(625)(25×10−9)=32,000rad/s.
3. Step 3: Compare α2 and ω02; since α2<ω02, the response is
underdamped and from Table 8.3,
iL(t)=If+B′1e−αtcosωdt+B′2e−αtsinωdt, t≥0.
4. Step 4: Calculate ωd using the equation in the second row of Table 8.3:
ωd=ω02−α2=40,0002−32,0002=24,000rad/s.
5. Step 5: Calculate the values of B1′ and B2′ by simultaneously solving
the equations from row 5 in Table 8.3:
If+B′1=Io so 0.024+B′1=0;
−αB′1+ωdB′2=VoL so −32,000B′1+24,000B′2=0.
Solving,

B′1=−24mA and B′2=−32mA.
6. Step 6: Write the equation from Step 3 using the results from Steps 4
and 5 to give
iL(t)=(24−24e−32,000tcos24,000t−32e−32,000tsin24,000t)mA, t≥0.

Solution
Follow the steps in Analysis Method 8.4.
1. Step 1: From Step 1 of Example 8.6,
V0=0, I0=0, If=24 mA.
2. Step 2: Since only R has changed,
ω0=40,000 rad/s,
and from the second row of Table 8.3
α=12RC=12(500) (25×10−9)=40,000 rad/s.
3. Step 3: Compare α2 and ω02; since α2=ω02, the response is critically
damped and from Table 8.3,

iL(t)=If+D′1te−αt+D′2e−αt, t≥0.
4. Step 4: The response is critically damped, so this step is not needed.
5. Step 5: Calculate the values of D1′ and D2′ by simultaneously solving
the equations from row 6 in Table 8.3:
If+D′2=Io so 0.024+D′2=0.029;
D′1−αD′2=VoL so D′1−40,000D′2=2000.
Solving,
D′1=2.2×106mA/s and D′2=5mA.
6. Step 6: Write the equation from Step 3 using the results from Steps 4
and 5 to give
iL(t)=(24−2.2×106te−40,000t+5e−40,000t)mA,  t≥0.
Example 8.9 Comparing the Three-
Step Response Forms
1. Plot on a single graph, over a range from 0 to 220μs, the overdamped,
underdamped, and critically damped responses derived in Examples
8.6–8.8.
2. Use the plots of (a) to find the time required for iL to reach 90% of its
final value.
3. On the basis of the results obtained in (b), which response would you
specify in a design that puts a premium on reaching 90% of the final
value of the output in the shortest time?
4. Which response would you specify in a design that must ensure that the
final value of the current is never exceeded?

Solution
1. See Fig. 8.14.
Figure 8.14 The current plots
for Example 8.9.
Figure 8.14 Full Alternative Text

2. The final value of iL is 24 mA, so we can read the times off the plots
corresponding to iL=21.6mA. Thus, tod=130 μs, tcd=97 μs, and
tud=74 μs.
3. The underdamped response reaches 90% of the final value in the fastest
time, so it is the desired response type when speed is the most important
design specification.
4. From the plot, you can see that the underdamped response overshoots
the final value of current, whereas neither the critically damped nor the
overdamped response produces currents in excess of 24 mA. Although
specifying either of the latter two responses would meet the design
specification, it is best to use the overdamped response. It would be
impractical to require a design to achieve the exact component values
that ensure a critically damped response.
Example 8.10 Finding Step
Response of a Parallel RLC Circuit
with Initial Stored Energy
Energy is stored in the circuit in Example 8.8 (Fig. 8.13, with R=500Ω) at the
instant the dc current source is applied. The initial current in the inductor is
29 mA, and the initial voltage across the capacitor is 50 V. Find iL(t) for t≥0
and v(t) for t≥0.
Solution
Follow Analysis Method 8.4.
1. Step 1: From the problem statement, V0=50 V and I0=29 mA. The final
value of the inductor current is unchanged from the problem in Example
8.8, so If=24 mA.

2. Step 2: From Example 8.8, α=40,000 rad/s and ω0=40,000 rad/s.
3. Step 3: Compare α2 and ω02; since α2=ω02, the response is critically
damped and from Table 8.3,
iL(t)=If+D′1te−αt+D′2e−αt, t≥0.
4. Step 4: The response is critically damped, so this step is not needed.
5. Step 5: Calculate the values of D1′ and D2′ by simultaneously solving
the equations from row 6 in Table 8.3:
If+D′2=Io so 0.024+D′2=0.029;
D′1−αD′2=VoL so D′1−40,000D′2=500.025=2000.
Solving,
D′1=2.2×106mA/s and D′2=5mA.
6. Step 6: Write the equation from Step 3 using the results from Steps 4
and 5 to give
iL(t)=(24−2.2×106te−40,000t+5e−40,000t)mA, t≥0.
We can get the expression for v(t),t≥0 by using the relationship between the
voltage and current in an inductor:
v( t ) = L  d i L dt = (25× 10 −3 )[(2.2× 10 6 ) (−40,000)t e −40,000t + 2.2 × 
10 6 e −40,000t + (5) (−40,000) e −40,000t ]× 10 −3 = ( −2.2× 10 6 t e
−40,000t +50 e −40,000t )V, t≥0.
To check this result, let’s verify that the initial voltage across the inductor is
50 V:
v(0)=−2.2 × 106(0)(1) + 50(1)=50 V.

8.4 The Natural and Step Response
of a Series RLC Circuit
The procedures for finding the natural or step responses of a series RLC
circuit are the same as those used to find the natural or step responses of a
parallel RLC circuit because both circuits are described by differential
equations that have the same form. For the natural-response problem, we
solve for the current because it is the same for all circuit components. We
begin by summing the voltages, expressed in terms of the current, around the
closed path in the circuit shown in Fig. 8.15. Thus
Figure 8.15 A circuit used to
illustrate the natural response
of a series RLC circuit.
Figure 8.15 Full Alternative Text
Ri+Ldidt+1C∫0tidτ + V0=0.

We now differentiate once with respect to t to get
Rdidt + Ld2idt2+ iC=0,
which we can rearrange as
d2idt2+RL didt+iLC=0. (8.27)
Comparing Eq. 8.27 with Eq. 8.1 reveals that they have the same form.
Therefore, to find the solution of Eq. 8.27, we follow the same process that
led us to the solution of Eq. 8.1.
From Eq. 8.27, the characteristic equation for the series RLC circuit is
Characteristic Equation, Series
RLC Circuit
s2+RLs+1LC=0.(8.28)
The roots of the characteristic equation are
s1,2=−R2L ± (R2L)2− 1LC,
or
s1,2=−α±α2 − ω02.
The neper frequency (α) for the series RLC circuit is
Neper Frequency, Series RLC
Circuit
α=R2L rad/s,(8.29)

and the expression for the resonant radian frequency is
Resonant Radian Frequency, Series
RLC Circuit
ω0=1LC rad/s.(8.30)
Note that the equation for the neper frequency of the series RLC circuit
differs from that of the parallel RLC circuit, but the equations for the resonant
radian frequencies are the same.
The current response will be overdamped, underdamped, or critically damped
according to whether ω02< α2, ω02> α2, or ω02=α2, respectively. Thus, the
three possible solutions for the current are as follows:
Series RLC Natural-Response
Forms
i(t)= A 1 e s 1 t + A 2 e s 2 t  ( overdamped ), (8.31)
i(t)= B 1 e −αt  cos  ω d t + B 2 e −αt  sin  ω d t (underdamped), (8.32)
i(t)= D 1 t e −αt   D 2 e −αt  ( critically damped ). (8.33)
Once you know the current you can find the voltage across any circuit
element.
Let’s look at how to alter the parallel RLC natural-response method to
construct a method for finding the series RLC natural response for the
circuit’s current.
1. Step 1: Determine the initial values of capacitor voltage, V0, and
inductor current, I0, by analyzing the RLC circuit. This step is
unchanged.

2. Step 2: Determine the values of the neper frequency, α, and the resonant
radian frequency, ω0, using the values of R, L, and C. While the
equation for ω0 is the same for both circuits, the equation for α is
different: for the parallel RLC, α=1/(2RC), and for the series RLC,
α=R/(2L).
3. Step 3: Compare α2 and ω02 to determine the response form. Use the
appropriate equation for the circuit current from Eqs. 8.31–8.33.
4. Step 4: If the response is overdamped, calculate the values of s1 and s2.
If the response is underdamped, calculate the value of ωd. If the
response is critically damped, you can skip this step. No changes are
needed in this step.
5. Step 5: Calculate the values of the A, B, and D coefficients by
simultaneously solving two equations. To construct the first equation,
we evaluate the expression for i(t) from Step 3 at t=0+ and set it equal to
the initial inductor current, I0. For example, in the overdamped case the
first equation is
A′1+A′2=I0;
in the underdamped case, the first equation is
B′1=I0;
and in the critically damped case, the first equation is
D′2=I0.
To construct the second equation, we find di/dt from the circuit current
in Step 3, evaluate it at t=0+ and set it equal to the initial value of di/dt
from the circuit. How do we find the initial value of di/dt from the
circuit? We use the relationship between voltage and current in an
inductor to get
di(0+)dt=vL(0+)L.
But we don’t know the initial voltage across the inductor, so we use

KVL to find it. We know that the sum of the three component voltages
at t=0+ must be zero. The voltage across the resistor at t=0+ is the
product of the initial current (I0) and the resistance, and the voltage
across the capacitor at t=0+ is V0. Using the reference system in Fig.
8.15, we obtain
vL(0+)=−RI0−V0.
So the initial value of di/dt from the circuit is
di(0+)dt=1L(−RI0−V0).
Thus, in the overdamped case, the second equation is
A ′ 1 s 1 + A ′ 2 s 2 = 1 L ( −R I 0 − V 0 )
in the underdamped case, the second equation is
−α B ′ 1 + ω d B ′ 2 =( −R I 0 − V 0 );
;
and in the critically damped case, the second equation is
D ′ 1 −α D ′ = 1 L ( −R I 0 − V 0 ).
6. Step 6: Write the equation for i(t) from Step 3 using the results from
Steps 4 and 5. Find the voltage for any component using its relationship
between voltage and current.
The steps for finding the natural response for a parallel RLC circuit are
condensed into Analysis Method 8.5. All of the equations you will need are
collected in Table 8.4.

Analysis Method 8.5 The natural response of series RLC circuits.

To verify that the procedure for finding the step response of a series RLC
circuit is similar to that for a parallel RLC circuit, we show that the
differential equation that describes the capacitor voltage in Fig. 8.16 has the
same form as the differential equation that describes the inductor current in
Fig. 8.11. Applying KVL to the circuit shown in Fig. 8.16 gives

V=Ri+Ldidt+ vC.
The current (i) is related to the capacitor voltage (vC) by the expression
i=CdvCdt,
from which
didt=Cd2vCdt2.

Substitute the expressions for the current and its first derivative into the KVL
equation to get
d2vCdt2+RLdvCdt+vCLC=VLC. (8.34)
Equation 8.34 has the same form as Eq. 8.23; therefore, the procedure for
finding vC parallels that for finding iL. The three possible solutions for vC
are as follows:
PARALLEL RLC STEP-
RESPONSE FORMS
υ c = V f + A 1 ' e s 1 t + A 2 ' e s 2 t  ( overdamped ), (8.35)
υ c = V f + B 1 ' e −αt  cos  ω d t + B 2 ' e −αt  sin  ω d t (underdamped),
(8.36)
υ c = V f D 1 ' t e −αt   D 2 ' e −αt  ( critically damped ). (8.37)
where Vf is the final value of vC. Hence, from the circuit shown in Fig. 8.15,
the final value of vC is the dc source voltage V.
Let’s look at how to alter the series RLC natural-response method (Analysis
Method 8.5) to find the series RLC step response for the capacitor voltage.
1. Step 1: Determine the initial values of capacitor voltage, V0, and
inductor current, I0, by analyzing the RLC circuit. In this step, we also
need to find the final value of the capacitor voltage, Vf, by analyzing the
circuit as t→∞.
2. Step 2: Determine the values of the neper frequency, α, and the resonant
radian frequency, ω0, using the values of R, L, and C. No modifications
are needed for this step.
3. Step 3: Compare α2 and ω02. Here we replace the natural response for
the current with the step response for the capacitor voltage, given in Eqs.
8.35–8.37.

4. Step 4: If the response is overdamped, calculate the values of s1 and s2.
If the response is underdamped, calculate the value of ωd. If the
response is critically damped, you can skip this step. No changes are
needed in this step.
5. Step 5: Here we calculate the values of the A′, B′, and D′ coefficients by
simultaneously solving two equations. To construct the first equation,
we evaluate the expression for vC(t) from Step 3 at t=0+ and set it equal
to the initial capacitor voltage, V0. For example, in the overdamped case
the first equation is
Vf+A′1+A′2=V0;
in the underdamped case, the first equation is
Vf+B′1=V0;
and in the critically damped case, the first equation is
Vf+D′2=V0.
To construct the second equation, we find dvC/dt from the capacitor
voltage in Step 3, evaluate it at t=0+ and set it equal to the initial value
of dvC/dt from the circuit. How do we find dvC/dt at t=0+ from the
circuit? We use the relationship between voltage and current in a
capacitor to get
dvC(0+)dt=iC(0+)C=I0C.
In the overdamped case, the second equation is
A′1s1+A′2s2=I0C;
in the underdamped case, the second equation is
−αB′1+ωdB′2=I0C;
and in the critically damped case, the second equation is

D′1−αD′2=I0C.
6. Step 6: Here we must write the equation for vC(t) from Step 3 using the
results from Steps 4 and 5. Find the current i and the remaining
component voltages using the relationships between voltage and current.
The steps for finding the step response for a series RLC circuit are condensed
into Analysis Method 8.6. All of the equations you will need are collected in
Table 8.5.

10 −6 ) = 10 8 rad 2 /s 2 .
3. Step 3: Compare α2 and ω02; since α2<ω02, the response is
underdamped and from row 5 in Table 8.4,
i(t)=B1e−αtcosωdt+B2e−αtsinωdt, t≥0.
4. Step 4: Since the response is underdamped, calculate the value of
ωd from row 2 in Table 8.4:
ωd=ω02−α2=108−28002=9600rad/s.
5. Step 5: Since the response is underdamped, calculate the values of
B1 and B2 by simultaneously solving the equations from row 5 in
Table 8.4:
B1=Io=0;
−αB1+ωdB2=1L(−RIo−Vo) so
−2800B1+9600B2=10.1(−(560)(0)−100)=−1000

i(t)=−0.1042e−2800tsin 9600t A, t≥0.
2. To find vC(t), we can use either of the following relationships:

Solution
This is a step-response problem because there is a source in the circuit for
t≥0; follow Analysis Method 8.6, which uses Table 8.5.
1. Step 1: Determine the initial values of capacitor voltage, V0, and
inductor current, I0, and the final value of the capacitor voltage, Vf.
From the problem statement and the circuit configuration, V0=0, I0=0,
and Vf=48 V.
2. Step 2: Determine the values of α and ω0 using the equations in Table

3. Step 3: Compare α2 and ω02; since α2>ω02, the response is
overdamped and from row 4 in Table 8.5:
vC(t)=Vf+A′1es1t+A′2es2t, t≥0.
4. Step 4: Since the response is overdamped, calculate the values of s1 and

s2 from row 2 in Table 8.5:
s 1 = −α+ α 2 − ω 0 2 =−6250+ 6250 2 − 5000 2 = −6250+3750=
−2500rad/s; s 2 = −α− α 2 − ω 0 2 =−6250− 6250 2 − 5000 2 =
−6250−3750=−10,000rad/s.
5. Step 5: Since the response is overdamped, calculate the values of A1′
and A2′ by simultaneously solving the equations from row 4 in Table
8.5:
V f + A ′ 1 + A ′ = V o  so 48+ A ′ 1 + A ′ 2 =0; s 1 A ′ 1 + s 2 A ′ 2

8.5 A Circuit with Two Integrating
Amplifiers
A circuit containing two integrating amplifiers connected in cascade1 is also a
second-order circuit; that is, the output voltage of the second integrator is
related to the input voltage of the first by a second-order differential equation.
We begin our analysis of a circuit containing two cascaded amplifiers with
the circuit shown in Fig. 8.19.
1 In a cascade connection, the output signal of the first amplifier (vo1 in Fig.
8.19) is the input signal for the second amplifier.
Figure 8.19 Two integrating
amplifiers connected in

Figure 8.19 Full Alternative Text
We derive the differential equation that defines the relationship between vo
and vg., assuming that the op amps are ideal. Begin the derivation by
summing the currents at the inverting input terminal of the first integrator:
0−vgR1+C1ddt(0−vo1)=0.
Simplifying and rearranging, we get
dvo1dt=−1R1C1vg. (8.38)
Now, sum the currents away from the inverting input terminal of the second
integrating amplifier:
0−vo1R2+C2ddt(0−vo)=0,
or

dvodt=−1R2C2vo1.
Differentiating both sides of this equation gives
d2vodt2=−1R2C2dvo1dt.
We find the differential equation that governs the relationship between vo
and vg by substituting for dvo1/dt, using Eq. 8.38:
d2vodt2=1R1C11R2C2vg. (8.39)
Example 8.13 illustrates the step response of a circuit containing two
cascaded integrating amplifiers.

No energy is stored in the circuit shown in Fig. 8.20 when the input voltage
vg jumps instantaneously from 0 to 25 mV.

Example 8.13.

Figure 8.20 Full Alternative Text
1. Derive the expression for vo(t) for 0≤t≤tsat.
2. Find the time tsat when the circuit saturates.
Solution
1. Figure 8.20 indicates that the amplifier scaling factors are
1 R 1 C 1 = 1000 ( 250 )( 0.1 ) =40, 1 R 2 C 2 = 1000 ( 500 )( 1 ) =2.
Now, because vg=25mV for t>0, Eq. 8.39 becomes
d2vodt2=(40)(2)(25×10−3)=2.
To solve for vo, we let

g(t)=dvodt,
then,
dg(t)dt=2,anddg(t)=2dt.
Hence
∫g(0)g(t)dy=2∫0tdx,
from which
g(t)−g(0)=2t.
However,
g(0)=dvo(0)dt=0,
because the energy stored in the circuit initially is zero, and the op amps
are ideal. (See Problem 8.59.) Then,
dvodt=2t,andvo=t2+ vo(0).
But vo(0)=0, so the expression for vo becomes
vo=t2,0≤t≤tsat.
2. The second integrating amplifier saturates when vo reaches 9 V or t=3s.
But it is possible that the first integrating amplifier saturates before t=3s.
To explore this possibility, use Eq. 8.38 to find dvo1/dt:
dvo1dt=−40(25)×10−3=−1.
Solving for vo1 yields
vo1=−t.
Thus, at t=3s, vo1=−3V, and, because the power supply voltage on the
first integrating amplifier is ±5V, the circuit reaches saturation when the

second amplifier saturates. When one of the op amps saturates, we no
longer can use the linear model to predict the behavior of the circuit.

Figure 8.21 depicts a variation of the circuit shown in Fig. 8.19. Recall from
Section 7.7 that the op amp in the integrating amplifier saturates due to the
feedback capacitor’s accumulation of charge. Here, a resistor is placed in
parallel with each feedback capacitor (C1 and C2) to overcome this problem.
We derive the equation for the output voltage, vo, and determine the impact
of these feedback resistors on the integrating amplifiers from Example 8.13.

We begin the derivation of the second-order differential equation that relates
vo1 to vg by summing the currents at the inverting input node of the first
integrator:
0−vgRa+0−vo1R1+C1ddt(0−vo1)=0.
Simplifying and rearranging, we get
dvo1dt+1R1C1vo1=−vgRaC1.
For convenience, we let τ1=R1C1 and write Eq. 8.41
dvo1dt+vo1τ1=−vgRaC1. (8.40)

Next, sum the currents at the inverting input terminal of the second
integrator:
0−vo1Rb+0−voR2+C2ddt(0−vo)=0.
Simplifying and rearranging, we get
dvodt+voτ2=−vo1RbC2, (8.41)
where τ2=R2C2. Differentiating both sides of Eq. 8.40 yields
d2vodt2+1τ2dvodt=−1RbC2dvo1dt.
From Eq. 8.40,
dvo1dt=−vo1τ1−vgRaC1,
and from Eq. 8.41,
vo1=−RbC2dvodt−RbC2τ2vo.
Finally, eliminate vo1 and dvo1/dt from the second-order differential
equation and obtain the desired relationship:
d2vodt2+ (1τ1+1τ2)dvodt+(1τ1τ2)vo=vgRaC1RbC2. (8.42)
From Eq. 8.42, the characteristic equation is
s2+ (1τ1+1τ2)s+1τ1τ2=0.
The roots of the characteristic equation are real, namely,
s 1 = −1 τ 1 , s 2 = −1 τ 2 .

The parameters for the circuit shown in Fig. 8.21 are Ra=100 kΩ,
R1=500 kΩ, C1=0.1 μF, Rb=25kΩ, R2=100 kΩ, and C2=1 μF. The power
supply voltage for each op amp is ±6V. The signal voltage (vg) for the
cascaded integrating amplifiers jumps from 0 to 250 mV at t=0. No energy is
stored in the feedback capacitors at the instant the signal is applied.
1. Find differential equation that governs vo.
2. Find vo(t) for t≥0.
3. Find the differential equation that governs vo1.
4. Find vo1(t) for t≥0.
Solution
1. From the numerical values of the circuit parameters, we have
τ1=R1C1=0.05 s; τ2=R2C2=0.10 s, and vg/RaC1RbC2=1000 V/s2.
Substituting these values into Eq. 8.42 gives
d2vodt2+30dvodt+200vo=1000.
2. The roots of the characteristic equation are s1=−20rad/s and s2=
−10rad/s. The final value of vo is the product of the input voltage and
the gain of each stage because the capacitors behave as open circuits as
t→ ∞. Thus,
vo(∞)=(250×10−3)(−500)100(−100)25=5 V.
The solution for vo thus takes the form:

vo=5+A′1e−10t + A′2e−20t.
With vo(0)=0 and dvo(0)/dt=0, the numerical values of A′1 and A′2 are
A′1=−10 V and A′2=5 V. Therefore, the solution for vo is
vo(t)=(5−10e−10t+5e−20t) V,t≥0.
The solution assumes that neither op amp saturates. We have already
noted that the final value of vo is 5 V, which is less than 6 V; hence, the
second op amp does not saturate. The final value of vo1 is (250×10−3)
(−500/100), or −1.25V. Therefore, the first op amp does not saturate,
and our assumption and solution are correct.
3. Substituting the numerical values of the parameters into Eq. 8.40
generates the desired differential equation:
dvo1dt+20vo1=−25.
4. We have already noted the initial and final values of vo1, along with the
time constant τ1. Thus, we write the solution in accordance with
Analysis Method 7.5, developed in Section 7.4:
v o1 = −1.25+ [ 0−( −1.25 ) ] e −20t = −1.25+1.25 e −20t  V,t≥0.

will discover that its output is an undamped sinusoid, which a computer’s

clock generator could use instead of the typical quartz crystal oscillator. We
will be able to specify the frequency of the clock by selecting appropriate
values for the inductor and capacitor.

Figure 8.22 Full Alternative Text
Since this is a series RLC natural-response problem, we follow Analysis
Method 8.5, which uses Table 8.4. Remember that R=0 for t≥0.
1. Step 1: Determine the initial values of capacitor voltage,V0, and
inductor current, I0. How does the circuit behave when t<0? When the
switch is in the a position, all of the components are connected. The
capacitor acts like an open circuit, whose voltage is V0, and the inductor
acts like a short circuit, whose current is I0. The capacitor and inductor
have the same voltage, and since the inductor’s voltage is 0, V0=0. The
current in the inductor is the current in the loop containing the voltage
source, the resistor, and the inductor, which is V0=VS/RS.
2. Step 2: Determine the values of α and ω0 using the equations in Table

8.4:
α = R 2L = 0 2L =0, ω 0 2 = 1 LC .
3. Step 3: Compare α2 and ω02; since α2<ω02, the response is
underdamped and from row 5 in Table 8.4:
i(t)=B1e−αtcosωdt+B2e−αtsinωdt, t≥0.
4. Step 4: Since the response is underdamped, calculate the value of ωd
from row 2 in Table 8.4:
ωd=ω02−α2=ω02−02=ω0.
5. Step 5: Since the response is underdamped, calculate the values of B1
and B2 by simultaneously solving the equations from row 5 in Table
8.4:
B1=Io=VSRS
−αB1+ωdB2=1L(−RSIo−Vo) so
−(0)B1+ω0B2=1L(−(0)(VSRS)−0)=0
Solving,
B1=VSRS and B2=0.
6. Step 6: Write the equation for i(t) using the results from Steps 4 and 5:
i(t)=VSRSe−(0)tcosω0t,t≥0.
We can now use the expression for the current in the circuit to find the
voltage output by the capacitor:
vo(t)=1C∫0ti(x)dx=1C∫0tVSRScosω0xdx=VSω0RSCsinω0t,t≥0.
By choosing values for L and C, we can use the circuit in Fig. 8.22 to
generate an undamped sinusoid when t≥0 for a computer’s clock generator.
So why is a quartz crystal used to generate the sinusoid for the clock

generator instead of the LC circuit of Fig. 8.22? Remember that our analysis
of the LC circuit assumed that the inductor and capacitor are ideal. But ideal
inductors and capacitors do not exist—real inductors and capacitors have a
small amount of resistance. We leave it to you to examine the effect of this
small amount of resistance on the performance of an LC oscillator in the
Chapter Problems.

Summary
The characteristic equation for both the parallel and series RLC
circuits has the form
s2+2αs+ω02=0,
where α=1/2RC for the parallel circuit, α=R/2L for the series circuit, and
ω02=1/LC for both the parallel and series circuits. (See pages 275 and
297.)
The roots of the characteristic equation are
s1,2=−α±α2−ω02.
(See page 276.)
The form of the natural and step responses of series and parallel RLC
circuits depends on the values of α2 and ω02; such responses can be
overdamped, underdamped, or critically damped. These terms
describe the impact of the dissipative element (R) on the response. The
neper frequency, α, reflects the effect of R. (See pages 276 and 277.)
To determine the natural response of a parallel RLC circuit, follow the
steps in Analysis Method 8.3, using the equations in Table 8.2. (See
page 287.)
To determine the step response of a parallel RLC circuit, follow the
steps in Analysis Method 8.4, using the equations in Table 8.3. (See
page 292.)
To determine the natural response of a series RLC circuit, follow the
steps in Analysis Method 8.5, using the equations in Table 8.4. (See
page 299.)
To determine the step response of a series RLC circuit, follow the steps

in Analysis Method 8.6, using the equations in Table 8.5. (See page
301.)
When two integrating amplifiers with ideal op amps are connected in
cascade, the output voltage of the second integrator is related to the
input voltage of the first by an ordinary, second-order differential
equation. Therefore, the techniques developed in this chapter may be
used to analyze the behavior of a cascaded integrator. (See pages 303
and 304.)
We can overcome the limitation of a simple integrating amplifier—the
saturation of the op amp due to charge accumulating in the feedback
capacitor—by placing a resistor in parallel with the capacitor in the
feedback path. (See page 305.)

Thus far, we have focused on circuits with constant sources; in this chapter
we are now ready to consider circuits energized by sinusoidal voltage or
current sources. For these circuits, we will calculate the values of the
specified output voltages and currents in the steady state. This means we will
not know the complete response of the circuits, which in general is the sum of
the transient (or natural) response and the steady-state response. Our analysis
will only characterize a circuit’s response once the transient component has

decayed to zero.
Sinusoidal sources and their effect on circuit behavior form an important area
of study for several reasons.
Generating, transmitting, distributing, and consuming electric energy
occurs under essentially sinusoidal steady-state conditions.
Understanding sinusoidal behavior makes it possible to predict the
behavior of circuits with nonsinusoidal sources.
Specifying the behavior of an electrical system in terms of its steady-
state sinusoidal response simplifies the design. If the system satisfies the
specifications, the designer knows that the circuit will respond
satisfactorily to nonsinusoidal inputs.
The remaining chapters of this book are largely based on the techniques used
when analyzing circuits with sinusoidal sources. Fortunately, the circuit
analysis and simplification techniques from Chapters 1–4 work for circuits
with sinusoidal as well as dc sources, so some of the material in this chapter
will be very familiar to you. The challenges of sinusoidal analysis include
developing the appropriate component models, writing the equations that
describe the resulting circuit, and working with complex numbers.
Practical Perspective
A Household Distribution Circuit
Power systems that generate, transmit, and distribute electrical power are
designed to operate in the sinusoidal steady state. The standard household
distribution circuit used in the United States supplies both 120 V and 240 V.
Consider the following situation. At the end of a day of fieldwork, a farmer
returns to his farmstead, checks his hog confinement building, and finds to
his dismay that the hogs are dead. The problem is traced to a blown fuse that

caused a 240 V fan motor to stop. The loss of ventilation led to the
suffocation of the livestock. The interrupted fuse is located in the main switch
that connects the farmstead to the electrical service.
Before the insurance company settles the claim, it wants to know if the
electric circuit supplying the farmstead functioned properly. The lawyers for
the insurance company are puzzled because the farmer’s wife, who was in the
house on the day of the accident convalescing from minor surgery, was able
to watch TV during the afternoon. Furthermore, when she went to the kitchen
to start preparing the evening meal, the electric clock indicated the correct
time. The lawyers have hired you to explain why the electric clock in the
kitchen and the television set in the living room continued to operate after the
fuse in the main switch blew.
We will explore this situation and answer the question after learning how to
calculate the steady-state response of circuits with sinusoidal sources.

9.1 The Sinusoidal Source
A sinusoidal voltage source (independent or dependent) produces a voltage
that varies sinusoidally with time. A sinusoidal current source (independent
or dependent) produces a current that varies sinusoidally with time. We begin
by reviewing the sinusoidal function, using a voltage source as an example,
but our observations also apply to current sources.
We can express a sinusoidally varying function with either the sine function
or the cosine function. Although they work equally well, we cannot use both
functional forms simultaneously. We will use the cosine function throughout
our discussion. Hence, we write a sinusoidally varying voltage as
v=Vm cos (ωt + ϕ). (9.1)
To aid discussion of the parameters in Eq. 9.1, we show the voltage versus
time plot in Fig. 9.1. The coefficient Vm gives the maximum amplitude of
the sinusoidal voltage. Because ±1 bounds the cosine function, ±Vm bounds
the amplitude, as seen in Fig. 9.1. You can also see that the sinusoidal
function repeats at regular intervals; therefore, it is a periodic function. A
periodic function is characterized by the time required for the function to pass
through all its possible values. This time is the period of the function, T. and
is measured in seconds. The reciprocal of T gives the number of cycles per
second, or the frequency, of the periodic function, and is denoted f, so
f=1T. (9.2)
Figure 9.1 A sinusoidal voltage.

Figure 9.1 Full Alternative Text
A cycle per second is called a hertz, abbreviated Hz. (The term cycles per
second rarely is used in contemporary technical literature.)
Now look at the coefficient of t in Eq. 9.1. Omega (ω) represents the angular
frequency of the sinusoidal function and is related to both T and f:
ω=2πf=2π/T (radians/second). (9.3)
Equation 9.3 tells us that the cosine (or sine) function passes through a
complete set of values each time its argument, ωt, passes through
2π rad (360°). From Eq. 9.3, we see that whenever t is an integral multiple of
T, the argument ωt increases by an integral multiple of 2π rad.
The angle ϕ in Eq. 9.1 is the phase angle of the sinusoidal voltage. It
determines the value of the sinusoidal function at t=0; therefore, it fixes the
point on the periodic wave where we start measuring time. Changing the

phase angle ϕ shifts the sinusoidal function along the time axis but has no
effect on either the amplitude (Vm) or the angular frequency (ω). Note, for
example, that reducing ϕ to zero shifts the sinusoidal function shown in Fig.
9.1 ϕ/ω time units to the right, as shown in Fig. 9.2. When compared with a
sinusoidal function with ϕ=0, a sinusoidal function with a positive ϕ is shifted
to the left, while a sinusoidal function with a negative ϕ is shifted to the right.
(See Problem 9.4.)
Figure 9.2 The sinusoidal
voltage from Fig. 9.1 shifted to
the right when ϕ=0.
Figure 9.2 Full Alternative Text

Remember that ωt and ϕ must carry the same units because the argument of
the sinusoidal function is (ωt+ϕ). With ωt expressed in radians, you would
expect ϕ to also be in radians. However, ϕ normally is given in degrees, and
ωt is converted from radians to degrees before the two quantities are added.
The conversion from radians to degrees is given by
(number of degrees)=180∘π (number of radians).
Another important characteristic of the sinusoidal voltage (or current) is its
rms value. The rms value of a periodic function is defined as the square root
of the mean value of the squared function. Hence, if v=Vmcos(ωt+ϕ), the rms
value of v is
Vrms=1T∫t0t0+TVm2 cos2(ωt + ϕ) dt. (9.4)
Note from Eq. 9.4 that we obtain the mean value of the squared voltage by
integrating v2 over one period (that is, from t0 to t0 + T) and then dividing by
the range of integration, T. Note further that the starting point for the
integration t0 is arbitrary.
The quantity under the square root sign in Eq. 9.4 reduces to Vm2/2. (See
Problem 9.7.) Hence, the rms value of v is
RMS Value of a Sinusoidal Voltage
Source
Vrms=Vm2. (9.5)
The rms value of the sinusoidal voltage depends only on the maximum
amplitude of v, namely, Vm. The rms value is not a function of either the
frequency or the phase angle. In Chapter 10, we explain the importance of the
rms value and use it extensively to calculate power in circuits with sinusoidal
sources.
We can completely describe a specific sinusoidal signal if we know its

frequency, phase angle, and amplitude. Examples 9.1, 9.2, and 9.3 illustrate
these basic properties of the sinusoidal function. In Example 9.4, we calculate
the rms value of a periodic function, and in so doing we clarify the meaning
of root mean square.
Example 9.1 Finding the
Characteristics of a Sinusoidal
Current
A sinusoidal current has a maximum amplitude of 20 A. The current passes
through one complete cycle in 1 ms. The magnitude of the current at t=0 is 10
A.
1. What is the frequency of the current in hertz?
2. What is the frequency in radians per second?
3. Write the expression for i(t) using the cosine function. Express ϕ in
degrees.
4. What is the rms value of the current?
Solution
1. From the statement of the problem, T=1ms; hence,
f=1/T=1/0.001=1000Hz.
2. ω=2πf=2π(1000)=2000π rad/sec.
3. We have
i(t) = I m  cos(ωt + ϕ) = 20 cos(2000πt + ϕ)A,

but i(0)=10A. Therefore, 10=20 cos ϕ, so ϕ=60°. Thus, the expression
for i(t) becomes
i(t)=20cos(2000πt+60°)A.
4. From Eq. 9.5, the rms value of a sinusoidal current is Im/2. Therefore,
the rms value is 20/2, or 14.14 A.
Example 9.2 Finding the
Characteristics of a Sinusoidal
Voltage
A sinusoidal voltage is given by the expression v=300 cos(120πt+30∘) V.
1. What is the period of the voltage in milliseconds?
2. What is the frequency in hertz?
3. What is the magnitude of v at t=2.778 ms?
4. What is the rms value of v?
Solution
1. From the expression for v, ω=120π rad/s. Because ω=2π/T, T=2π/
ω=160 s, or 16.667 ms.
2. The frequency is 1/T, or 60 Hz.
3. From (a), ω=2π/16.667; thus, at t=2.778 ms, ωt is nearly 1.047 rad, or
60°. Therefore, v(2.778 ms)=300 cos (60° + 30°)=0 V.
4. Vrms=300/2=212.13 V.

Example 9.3 Translating a Sine
Expression to a Cosine Expression
We can translate the sine function to the cosine function by subtracting
90° (π/2 rad) from the argument of the sine function.
1. Verify this translation by showing that
sin (ωt + θ)=cos (ωt + θ−90°).
2. Use the result in (a) to express sin (ωt + 30°) as a cosine function.
Solution
1. Verification involves direct application of the trigonometric identity
cos(α − β)=cos α cos β + sin α sin β.
We let α=ωt + θ and β=90°. From the trigonometric identity,
cos(ωt+θ−90°)=cos(ωt+θ) cos(90°)+sin (ωt+θ) sin(90°).
Since cos 90°=0 and sin 90°=1, we have
cos(ωt+θ−90°)=sin(ωt+θ).
2. From (a) we have
sin( ωt + 30° ) = cos( ωt + 30°−90° ) = cos( ωt−60° ).

Solution
From the definition of rms, the rms value of i is
Irms=1T∫t0t0+Ti2dt.

Interpreting the integral under the square root sign as the area under the
squared function for an interval of one period helps us find the rms value.
The squared function, with the area between 0 and T shaded, is shown in Fig.
9.4. Notice that the area under the squared current for an interval of one
period is equal to four times the area under the squared current for the
interval 0 to T/4 seconds; that is,
Figure 9.4 i2 versus t.
Figure 9.4 Full Alternative Text
∫t0t0+Ti2dt=4∫0T/4i2dt.
The analytical expression for i in the interval 0 to T/4 is
i=4IpTt, 0<t<T/4.
The area under the squared function for one period is
∫t0t0+Ti2dt=4∫0T/416Ip2T2t2dt=Ip2T3.
The mean, or average, value of the function is simply the area for one period

divided by the period. Thus
imean=1T Ip2T3=13Ip2.
The rms value of the current is the square root of this mean value. Hence
Irms=Ip3.

9.2 The Sinusoidal Response
As stated in the Introduction, this chapter focuses on the steady-state
response to sinusoidal sources. But we begin by characterizing the total
response, which will help you keep the steady-state solution in perspective.
The circuit shown in Fig. 9.5 describes the general problem, where vs is a
sinusoidal voltage described by
vs=Vm cos (ωt + ϕ).
Figure 9.5 An RL circuit
excited by a sinusoidal voltage
source.
Figure 9.5 Full Alternative Text
For convenience, we assume the circuit’s initial current is zero, and we
measure time from the moment the switch is closed. We want to find i(t) for

t≥0, using a method similar to the one used when finding the step response of
an RL circuit (Chapter 7). But here, the voltage source is time-varying
sinusoidal voltage rather than a constant voltage. Applying KVL to the circuit
in Fig. 9.5 gives us the ordinary differential equation
Ldidt + Ri=Vm cos(ωt + ϕ). (9.6)
The solution for Eq. 9.6 is discussed in an introductory course in differential
equations. We ask those of you who have not yet studied differential
equations to accept that the solution for i is
i=−VmR2 + ω2L2cos (ϕ − θ)e−(R/L)t + VmR2 + ω2L2 cos (ωt + ϕ − θ),(9.7)
where
θ=tan−1(ωLR).
Thus, we can easily determine θ for a circuit driven by a sinusoidal source of
known frequency. We can check that Eq. 9.7 is valid by showing that it
satisfies Eq. 9.6 for all values of t≥0; this exercise is left for your exploration
in Problem 9.9.
Look carefully at the two terms on the right-hand side of Eq. 9.7. The first
term is a decaying exponential function whose time constant is τ=L/R. This
term is the transient component of the current because it decays to zero as
t→0. Remember from Chapter 7 that this transient component has less than
1% of its initial value when t=5τ.
The second term is a cosine whose frequency is ω, the same as the frequency
of the voltage source. This is the steady-state component of the current
because it persists as long as the switch remains closed and the source
continues to supply the sinusoidal voltage. In this chapter, we find only the
steady-state response of circuits with sinusoidal sources; that is, we find the
response once its transient component has decayed to zero. We develop a
technique for calculating the steady-state response directly, thus avoiding the
problem of solving the differential equation. However, when we use this
technique, we cannot find either the transient component or the total
response.

Using the steady-state component of Eq. 9.7, we identify four important
characteristics of the steady-state solution:
1. The steady-state solution is a cosine function, just like the circuit’s
source.
2. The frequency of the solution is identical to the frequency of the source.
This condition is always true in a linear circuit when the circuit
parameters, R, L, and C, are constant. (If frequencies in the solution are
not present in the source, there is a nonlinear element in the circuit.)
3. The maximum amplitude of the steady-state response, in general, differs
from the maximum amplitude of the source. For the circuit in Fig. 9.5,
the maximum amplitude of the current is Vm/R2+ω2L2, while the
maximum amplitude of the source is Vm.
4. The phase angle of the steady-state response, in general, differs from the
phase angle of the source. For the circuit being discussed, the phase
angle of the current is ϕ − θ, and that of the voltage source is ϕ.
These characteristics motivate the phasor method, which we introduce in
Section 9.3. Note that finding only the steady-state response means finding
only its maximum amplitude and phase angle. The waveform and frequency
of the steady-state response are already known because they are the same as
the circuit’s source.

Problem 9.10.

9.3 The Phasor
A phasor is a complex number that carries the amplitude and phase angle
information of a sinusoidal function.1 The phasor concept is rooted in Euler’s
identity, which relates the exponential function to the trigonometric function:
1 You can review complex numbers by reading Appendix B.
1You can review complex numbers by reading Appendix B.
e±jθ=cos θ ± j sin θ.
Euler’s identity gives us another way of representing the cosine and sine
functions. We can think of the cosine function as the real part of the
exponential function and the sine function as the imaginary part of the
exponential function; that is,
cos θ=R{ejθ}
and
sin θ=I{ejθ},
where R means “the real part of” and I means “the imaginary part of.”
Because we chose to use the cosine function to represent sinusoidal signals
(see Section 9.1), we can apply Euler’s identity directly. In particular, we
write the sinusoidal voltage function given in Eq. 9.1 by replacing the cosine
function with the real part of the complex exponential:
v=Vm cos (ωt + ϕ)
=VmR{ej(ωt + ϕ)}
=VmR{ejωtejϕ}.
We can move the constant Vm inside the argument of the R function without
altering the equation. We can also reverse the order of the two exponential

functions inside the argument and write the voltage as
v=R{Vmejϕejωt}.
In this expression for the voltage, note that the quantity Vmejϕ is a complex
number that carries the amplitude and phase angle of the cosine function we
started with (Eq. 9.1). We define this complex number as the phasor
representation, or phasor transform, of the given sinusoidal function. Thus
Phasor Transform
V=Vmejϕ=P{Vm cos(ωt+ϕ)}, (9.8)
where the notation P{Vm cos (ωt+ϕ)} is read as “the phasor transform of
Vmcos(ωt+ϕ).” Thus, the phasor transform transfers the sinusoidal function
from the time domain to the complex-number domain, which is also called
the frequency domain, since the response depends, in general, on ω. As in
Eq. 9.8, throughout this book we represent a phasor quantity by using a
boldface capital letter.
Equation 9.8 is the polar form of a phasor, but we also can express a phasor
in rectangular form. Thus, we rewrite Eq. 9.8 as
V=Vm cos ϕ + jVm sin ϕ.
Both polar and rectangular forms are useful in circuit applications of the
phasor concept.
We see from Eq. 9.8 that phasors always have the form Aejϕ, where A is the
amplitude of the underlying voltage or current. It is common to abbreviate
phasors using the angle notation A ϕ ∘ , where
A ϕ ∘ ≡A e jϕ .
We use this angle notation extensively in the material that follows.

Inverse Phasor Transform
Using Eq. 9.8, we can transform a sinusoidal function to a phasor. We can
also reverse the process; that is, we can transform a phasor back to the
original sinusoidal function. If V=100 − 26 ∘  V, the expression for v is
100 cos (ωt−26°) V because we have decided to use the cosine function for
all sinusoids. Notice that the phasor cannot give us the value of ω because it
carries only amplitude and phase information. When we transform a phasor
to the corresponding time-domain expression, we use the inverse phasor
transform function, as shown in the equation
Inverse Phasor Transform
P−1{Vmejθ}=R{Vmejθejωt}=Vmcos(ωt+θ°) (9.9)
where the notation P−1{Vmejϕ} is read as “the inverse phasor transform of
Vmejϕ.” Using Eq. 9.9, we find the inverse phasor transform by multiplying
the phasor by ejωt and extracting the real part of the product.
Before applying the phasor transform to circuit analysis, we use it to solve a
problem with which you are already familiar: adding sinusoidal functions.
Example 9.5 shows how the phasor transform greatly simplifies this type of
problem.
Example 9.5 Adding Cosines Using
Phasors
If y1=20 cos (ωt − 30°) and y2=40 cos (ωt + 60°), express y=y1 + y2 as a
single sinusoidal function.
1. Solve by using trigonometric identities.

2. Solve by using the phasor concept.
Solution
1. First, we expand both y1 and y2, using the cosine of the sum of two
angles, to get
y1=20 cos ωt cos 30° + 20 sin ωt sin30°;
y2=40 cos ωt cos 60° − 40 sin ωt sin60°.
Adding y1 and y2, we obtain
y = ( 20 cos 30° + 40 cos 60° ) cos ωt + ( 20 sin 30° − 40 sin 60° ) sin ωt =
37.32 cos ωt − 24.64 sin ωt.
To combine these two terms, we treat the coefficients of the cosine and
sine as sides of a right triangle (Fig. 9.6) and then multiply and divide
the right-hand side by the hypotenuse. Our expression for y becomes
y = 44.72( 37.32 44.72  cos ωt −  24.64 44.72  sin ωt ) = 44.72(
cos 33.43° cos ωt − sin 33.43° sin ωt ).
Figure 9.6 A right triangle
used in the solution for y.

Figure 9.6 Full Alternative Text
Again, we invoke the identity involving the cosine of the sum of two
angles and write
y=44.72 cos (ωt+33.43°).
2. The sum of the two cosines is
y=20 cos(ωt−30°)+40 cos(ωt+60°).
Use Euler’s identity to rewrite the righthand side of this equation as
y=R{20e−j30°ejω}+R{40ej60°ejω}
=R{20e−j30°ejω+40ej60°ejω}.
Factoring out the term ejω from each term gives
y=R{(20e−j30°+40ej60°)ejω}.
We can calculate the sum of the two phasors using the angle notation:
20 −30° +40 60° = ( 17.32−j10 )+( 20+j34.64 ) = 37.32+j24.64 =
44.72∠33.43°.
Therefore,

y = R{ 44.72 e j33.43° e jω } = 44.72cos ( ωt+33.43° ).
Adding sinusoidal functions using phasors is clearly easier than using
trigonometric identities. Note that it requires the ability to move back
and forth between the polar and rectangular forms of complex numbers.

9.4 The Passive Circuit Elements in
the Frequency Domain
Applying the phasor transform in circuit analysis is a two-step process.
1. Establish the relationship between the phasor current and the phasor
voltage at the terminals of the passive circuit elements. We complete this
step in this section, analyzing the resistor, inductor, and capacitor in the
phasor domain.
2. Develop the phasor-domain version of Kirchhoff’s laws, which we
discuss in Section 9.5.
The V-I Relationship for a Resistor
From Ohm’s law, if the current in a resistor is i=Imcos(ωt + θi), the voltage at
the terminals of the resistor, as shown in Fig. 9.7, is
v = R[ I m  cos ( ωt +  θ i ) ] = R I m [ cos ( ωt +  θ i ) ],
Figure 9.7 A resistive element

where Im is the maximum amplitude of the current in amperes and θi is the
phase angle of the current.
The phasor transform of this voltage is
V=R I m e j θ i =R I m θ i .
But I m θ i is the phasor representation of the sinusoidal current, so we can
write the voltage phasor as

which states that the phasor voltage at the terminals of a resistor is the
resistance times the phasor current—the phasor version of Ohm’s law. Figure
9.8 shows the circuit diagram for a resistor in the frequency domain.

Equation 9.10 contains an important piece of information—namely, that at
the terminals of a resistor, there is no phase shift between the current and
voltage. Figure 9.9 depicts this phase relationship, where the phase angle of
both the voltage and the current waveforms is 60°. The signals are said to be
in phase because they both reach corresponding values on their respective
curves at the same time (for example, they are at their positive maxima at the
same instant).

the voltage and current at the
terminals of a resistor are in

The V-I Relationship for an
Inductor
We derive the relationship between the phasor current and phasor voltage at
the terminals of an inductor by assuming a sinusoidal current and using
Ldi/dt to establish the corresponding voltage. Thus, for i=Im cos (ωt + θi), the
expression for the voltage is

v=Ldidt=−ωLImsin(ωt + θi).
We now replace the sine function with the cosine function:
v=−ωLIm cos(ωt+θi−90°).
The phasor representation of the voltage is then
V = −ωL I m e j( θ i −90° ) = −ωL I m e j θ i e −j90° = jωL I m e j θ i = jωL I
m ∠ θ i .
Note that, in deriving the expression for the phasor voltage, we used the
identity
e−j90°=cos 90° − j sin 90°=−j.
Also, I m θ i is the phasor representation of the sinusoidal current, so we can
express the phasor voltage in terms of the phasor current:
Relationship Between Phasor
Voltage and Phasor Current for an
Inductor
V=jωLI. (9.11)
Equation 9.11 states that the phasor voltage at the terminals of an inductor
equals jωL times the phasor current. Figure 9.10 shows the frequency-domain
equivalent circuit for the inductor. Note that the relationship between phasor
voltage and phasor current for an inductor also applies for the mutual
inductance in one coil due to current flowing in another mutually coupled
coil. That is, the phasor voltage at the terminals of one coil in a mutually
coupled pair of coils equals jωM times the phasor current in the other coil.

domain equivalent circuit for
an inductor.
Figure 9.10 Full Alternative Text
We can rewrite Eq. 9.11 as
V=( ωL 90° ) I m θ i =ωL I m ( θ i +90)° ,
which indicates that the voltage and current are out of phase by exactly90°,
Specifically, the voltage leads the current by 90°, or, equivalently, the current
lags the voltage by 90°. Figure 9.11 illustrates the concept of voltage leading
current or current lagging voltage. For example, the voltage reaches its
negative peak exactly 90° before the current reaches its negative peak. The
same observation can be made with respect to the zero-going-positive
crossing or the positive peak.

phase relationship between the
current and voltage at the

terminals of an inductor

Figure 9.11 Full Alternative Text
We can also express the phase shift in seconds. A phase shift of 90°
corresponds to one-fourth of a period; hence, the voltage leads the current by
T/4, or 14f second.
The V-I Relationship for a
Capacitor

To determine the relationship between the phasor current and phasor voltage
at the terminals of a capacitor, we start with the relationship between current
and voltage for a capacitor in the time domain,
i=Cdvdt,
and assume that
v=Vm cos(ωt + θv).
Therefore,
i=Cdvdt=−ωCVmsin(ωt+θv).
We now rewrite the expression for the current using the cosine function:
i=−ωCVmcos(ωt+θv−90°).
The phasor representation of the current is
I=−ωC V m e j( θ v −90° ) =−ωC V m e j θ v e −j90° =jωC V m e j θ v =jωC
V m θ v .
Since V m θ v is the phasor representation of the sinusoidal voltage, we can
express the current phasor in terms of the voltage phasor as
I=jωCV.
Now express the voltage phasor in terms of the current phasor, to conform to
the phasor equations for resistors and inductors:
Relationship Between Phasor
Voltage and Phasor Current for a
Capacitor

V=1jωCI (9.12)
Equation 9.12 demonstrates that the equivalent circuit for the capacitor in the
phasor domain is as shown in Fig. 9.12.

The voltage across the terminals of a capacitor lags behind the current by 90°.
We can show this by rewriting Eq. 9.12 as
V = ( 1 ωC −90° ) I m θ i ° = I m ωC ( θ i  − 90)° .
Thus, we can also say that the current leads the voltage by 90°. Figure 9.13
shows the phase relationship between the current and voltage at the terminals
of a capacitor.

Impedance and Reactance
We conclude this discussion of passive circuit elements in the frequency
domain with an important observation. When we compare Eqs. 9.10, 9.11,
and 9.12, we note that they are all of the form

Definition of Impedance
V=ZI, (9.13)
where Z represents the impedance of the circuit element. Solving for Z in Eq.
9.13, you can see that impedance is the ratio of a circuit element’s voltage
phasor to its current phasor. Thus, the impedance of a resistor is R, the
impedance of an inductor is jωL, the impedance of mutual inductance is jωM,
and the impedance of a capacitor is 1/jωC. In all cases, impedance is
measured in ohms. Note that, although impedance is a complex number, it is
not a phasor. Remember, a phasor is a complex number that results from the
phasor transform of a cosine waveform. Thus, although all phasors are
complex numbers, not all complex numbers are phasors.
Impedance in the frequency domain is the quantity analogous to resistance,
inductance, and capacitance in the time domain. The imaginary part of the
impedance is called reactance. The values of impedance and reactance for
each of the component values are summarized in Table 9.1.

Reactance Values

And, finally, a reminder. The passive sign convention holds in the frequency
domain. If the reference direction for the current phasor in a circuit element is
in the direction of the voltage phasor rise across the element, you must insert
a minus sign into the equation that relates the voltage phasor to the current
phasor.
Work through Example 9.6 to practice transforming circuit components from
the time domain to the phasor domain.

9.5 Kirchhoff’s Laws in the
Frequency Domain
Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law in the
Frequency Domain
We begin by assuming that v 1 ,  v 2 , . . .,  v n represent voltages around a
closed path in a circuit. We also assume that the circuit is operating in a
sinusoidal steady state. Thus, Kirchhoff’s voltage law requires that
v1 + v2 + ⋯ + vn=0,
which in the sinusoidal steady state becomes
Vm1 cos(ωt + θ1) + Vm2 cos(ωt + θ2) + ⋯ + Vmn cos(ωt + θn)=0.
We now use Euler’s identity to write the KVL equation as
R {Vm1ejθ1ejωt} + R {Vm2ejθ2ejωt} +…+ R {Vmnejθnejωt}=0.
which we simplify as
R {Vm1ejθ1ejωt + Vm2ejθ2ejωt + ⋯ + Vmnejθnejωt}=0.
Factoring the term ejωt from each term yields
R {(Vm1ejθ1 + Vm2ejθ2 + ⋯ + Vmnejθn)ejωt}=0,
or
R{(V1 + V2 + ⋯ + Vn)ejωt}=0.
But ejωt≠0, so

KVL in the Frequency Domain
V1 + V2 + ⋯ + Vn=0, (9.14)
which is the statement of Kirchhoff’s voltage law as it applies to phasor
voltages.
Kirchhoff’s Current Law in the
Frequency Domain
A similar derivation applies to a set of sinusoidal currents. Thus, if
i1 + i2 + ⋯ + in=0,
then
KCL in the Frequency Domain
I1 + I2 + ⋯ + In=0, (9.15)
where I1, I2, …, In are the phasor representations of the individual currents
i1, i2, …, in. Thus, Eq. 9.15 states Kirchhoff’s current law as it applies to
phasor currents.
Equations 9.13, 9.14, and 9.15 form the basis for circuit analysis in the
frequency domain. Note that Eq. 9.13 has the same algebraic form as Ohm’s
law and that Eqs. 9.14 and 9.15 state Kirchhoff’s laws for phasor quantities.
Therefore, you can use all the techniques developed for analyzing resistive
circuits to find phasor currents and voltages. No new analytical techniques
are needed; the basic circuit analysis and simplification tools covered in
Chapters 2–4 can all be used to analyze circuits in the frequency domain.
Phasor-circuit analysis consists of two fundamental tasks: (1) You must be
able to construct the frequency-domain model of a circuit; and (2) you must

be able to manipulate complex numbers and/or quantities algebraically.
Example 9.7 illustrates the use of KVL in the frequency domain.
Example 9.7 Using KVL in the
Frequency Domain
1. Use the results from Example 9.6 to calculate the phasor voltage drop,
from left to right, across the series combination of the resistive and
inductive impedances in Fig. 9.15.
2. Use the phasor voltage found in (a) to calculate the steady-state voltage
drop, from left to right, across the series combination of resistor and
inductor in Fig. 9.14.

1. Using KVL, the phasor voltage drop from left to right in Fig. 9.15 is
V= V 1 + V 2 = 5 45° +2.5 135° = 5.59 71.565° V.
2. To find the steady-state voltage drop across the resistor and inductor in
Fig. 9.14, we need to apply the inverse phasor transform to the phasor V
from part (a). We need the frequency of the current defined in Example
9.6, which is ω=1000 rad/s:

9.6 Series, Parallel, and Delta-to-
Wye Simplifications
The rules for combining impedances in series or parallel and for making
delta-to-wye transformations are the same as those for resistors. The only
difference is that combining impedances involves the algebraic manipulation
of complex numbers.
Combining Impedances in Series
Impedances in series can be combined into a single equivalent impedance
whose value is the sum of the individual impedances. The circuit shown in
Fig. 9.16 defines the problem in general terms. The impedances
Z1, Z2, …, Zn are connected in series between terminals a,b. When
impedances are in series, they carry the same phasor current I. From Eq.
9.13, the voltage drop across each impedance is Z1I, Z2I, …, ZnI, and from
Kirchhoff’s voltage law,
V ab = Z 1 I +  Z 2 I +...+  Z n I = ( Z 1  +  Z 2  + ... +  Z n )I.

The equivalent impedance between terminals a,b is
Combining Impedances in Series

Remember from Chapter 3 that we can use voltage division to find the
voltage across a single component from a collection of series-connected
components whose total voltage is known (Eq. 3.9). We derived the voltage
division equation using the equation for the equivalent resistance of series-
connected resistors. Using the same process, we can derive the voltage
division equation for frequency-domain circuits, where Vs is the voltage
applied to a collection of series-connected impedances, Vj is the voltage
across the impedance Zj, and Zeq is the equivalent impedance of the series-
connected impedances:

Example 9.8.

Figure 9.17 Full Alternative Text
Solution
1. From the expression for vs, we have ω=5000 rad/s. Therefore, the
impedance of the inductor is
ZL=jωL=j(5000)(32 × 10−3)=j160 Ω,
and the impedance of the capacitor is
ZC=j−1ωC=−j1(5000)(5×10−6)=−j40 Ω
The phasor transform of vs is
V s =750  30°  V.
Figure 9.18 illustrates the frequency-domain equivalent circuit of the
circuit shown in Fig. 9.17.
2. Using voltage division, we see that the phasor voltage V is proportional
to the source voltage; from Eq. 9.17,
V= −j40 90+j160−j40 ( 750 30° )=200 −113.13° V.

Note that we used Eq. 9.16 to find the equivalent impedance of the
series-connected impedances in the circuit.
3. Find the steady-state voltage v using the inverse phasor transform of V
from part (b). Remember that the source frequency is 5000 rad/s:

Figure 9.19 depicts the parallel connection of impedances. Note that when
impedances are in parallel, they have the same voltage across their terminals.
We derive Eq. 9.18 directly from Fig. 9.19 by combining Kirchhoff’s current
law with the phasor-domain version of Ohm’s law, that is, Eq. 9.13. From
Fig. 9.19,

Canceling the common voltage term from both sides gives us Eq. 9.18.
From Eq. 9.18, for the special case of just two impedances in parallel,
Zab=Z1Z2Z1+Z2. (9.19)
We can also express Eq. 9.18 in terms of admittance, defined as the
reciprocal of impedance and denoted Y. Thus
Y=1Z=G+jB (siemens).
Admittance is a complex number whose real part, G, is called conductance

and whose imaginary part, B, is called susceptance. Like admittance,
conductance and susceptance are measured in siemens (S). Replacing
impedances with admittances in Eq. 9.18, we get
Yab=Y1+Y2+⋯+Yn.
The admittance of each of the ideal passive circuit elements also is worth

Finally, remember from Chapter 3 that we can use current division to find the
current in a single branch from a collection of parallel-connected branches
whose total current is known (Eq. 3.10). We derived the current division
equation using the equation for the equivalent resistance of parallel-
connected resistors. Using the same process, we can derive the current
division equation for frequency-domain circuits, where Is is the current
supplied to a collection of parallel-connected impedances, Ij is the current in
the branch containing impedance Zj, and Zeq is the equivalent impedance of
the parallel-connected impedances:

Y1=110=0.1 S,
the admittance of the second branch is
Y2=16+j8=0.06−j0.08S.
and the admittance of the third branch is

The admittance of the three branches is

Solution
It is not possible to simplify the circuit in Fig. 9.23 using series and parallel
combinations of impedances. But if we replace either the upper delta (abc) or
the lower delta (bcd) with its Y equivalent, we can simplify the resulting
circuit by series-parallel combinations. To decide which delta to replace, find
the sum of the impedances around each delta. This quantity forms the
denominator for the equivalent Y impedances. The sum around the lower
delta is 30+j40, so we choose to transform the lower delta to its equivalent Y.
The Y impedance connecting to terminal b is

Z1=(20+j60)(10)30+j40=12+j4Ω,
the Y impedance connecting to terminal c is
Z2=10(−j20)30+j40=−3.2−j2.4 Ω,
and the Y impedance connecting to terminal d is
Z3=(20+j60)(−j20)30+j40=8−j24 Ω.

We can simplify the circuit in Fig. 9.24 by making series-parallel

and the impedance of the acn branch is
Zacn=63.2+j2.4−j2.4−3.2=60 Ω.
Note that the abn branch is in parallel with the acn branch. Therefore, we may
replace these two branches with a single branch having an impedance of
Zan=(60)(12)72=10 Ω.
Combining this 10 Ω resistor with the impedance between n and d reduces
the circuit to the one shown in Fig. 9.25. From that circuit,

Once we know I0, we can work back through the equivalent circuits to find
the branch currents in the original circuit. We begin by noting that I0 is the

Vnd=(8−j24)I0=96−j32 V.
We can now calculate the voltage Van because
V=Van+Vnd
where V is the phasor voltage of the source and Vnd is known. Thus
Van=120−(96−j32)=24+j32 V.
We now compute the branch currents Iabn and Iacn using Van and the
equivalent impedance of each branch:
Iabn=24+j3212=2+j83A,Iacn=24+j3260=410+j815A.
In terms of the branch currents defined in Fig. 9.23,
I1=Iabn=2+j83A,I2=Iacn=410+j815A.
We check the calculations of I1 and I2 by noting that
I1+I2=2.4+j3.2=I0.
To find the branch currents I3, I4, and I5, we must first calculate the voltages
V1 and V2. Referring to Fig. 9.23, we note that

We have now reduced the circuit to a simple series connection. We calculate
the current I0 by dividing the voltage of the source by the total series
impedance:
I 0 = 36−j12 12−j16 = 1.56+j1.08 A.
Now multiply I0 by the impedance 10−j19 to get V0
V0=(1.56+j1.08)(10−j19)=36.12−j18.84 V.
You can verify this result by using voltage division to calculate V0.

Solution
We first determine the Thévenin equivalent voltage. This voltage is the open-
circuit voltage appearing at terminals a,b. We choose the reference for the
Thévenin voltage as positive at terminal a. We can make two source
transformations using the 120 V, 12 Ω, and 60 Ω circuit elements to simplify
the left-hand side of the circuit. These transformations must preserve the
identity of the controlling voltage Vx because of the dependent voltage

source.
The first source transformation replaces the series combination of the 120 V
source and 12 Ω resistor with a 10 A current source in parallel with 12 Ω.
Next, we replace the parallel combination of the 12 and 60 Ω resistors with a
single 10 Ω resistor. Finally, we replace the parallel-connected 10 A source
and 10 Ω resistor with a 100 V source in series with 10 Ω. Figure 9.33 shows
the resulting circuit.

We added the current I to Fig. 9.33; note that once we know its value, we can
compute the Thévenin voltage. Use KVL to find I by summing the voltages
around the closed path in the circuit. Hence
100=10I−j40I+120I+10Vx=(130−j40)I+10Vx.
We relate the controlling voltage Vx to the current I by noting from Fig. 9.33
that
Vx=100−10I.

Then,
I= −900 30−j40 =−10.8 −j14.4 A.
Finally, we note from Fig. 9.33 that
VTh=10Vx+120I=10(100−10I)+120I=1000+20(-10.8−j14.4)=784−j288 V.
We can find the Thévenin impedance using any of the techniques in Sections
4.10–4.11 for finding Thévenin resistance. We use the test-source method in
this example. We begin by deactivating all independent sources in the circuit,
and then we apply either a test-voltage source or a test-current source to the
terminals of interest. The ratio of the voltage to the current at the test source
is the Thévenin impedance. Figure 9.34 presents the result of applying this
technique to the circuit shown in Fig. 9.32 while preserving the identity of
Vx.

9.8 The Node-Voltage Method
In Sections 4.2–4.4, we introduced the node-voltage method of circuit
analysis, culminating in Analysis Method 4.3 (p. 102). We can use this
analysis method to find the steady-state response for circuits with sinusoidal
sources. We need to make a few modifications:
If the circuit is in the time domain, it must be transformed to the
appropriate frequency domain. To do this, transform known voltages
and currents to phasors, replace unknown voltages and currents with
phasor symbols, and replace the component values for resistors,
inductors, mutually coupled coils, and capacitors with their impedance
values.
Follow the steps in Analysis Method 4.3 to find the values of the
unknown voltage and current phasors of interest.
Apply the inverse phasor transform to the voltage and current phasors to
find the steady-state values of the corresponding voltages and currents in
the time domain.
Example 9.13 illustrates these steps. Assessment Problem 9.12 and many of
the chapter problems give you an opportunity to use the node-voltage method
to solve for steady-state sinusoidal responses.
Example 9.13 Using the Node-
Voltage Method in the Frequency

A. We also replace the currents ia, ib, ic, and ix with corresponding phasor
symbols Ia, Ib, Ic, and Ix. Then we replace the inductor and capacitor values
with their impedances, using the frequency of the source:
ZL=j(500)(4×10-3)=j2Ω;ZC=-j(500)(400×10-6)=-j5Ω.
The resulting frequency-domain circuit is shown in Fig. 9.37.

1. Step 1: The circuit has three essential nodes, two at the top and one on
the bottom. We will need two KCL equations to describe the circuit.
2. Step 2: Four branches terminate on the bottom node, so we select it as
the reference node and label the node voltages at the remaining essential
nodes. The results of the first two steps are shown in Fig. 9.38 .

−10.6+V110+V1−V21+j2=0

V2−V11+j2+V2−j5+V2−20Ix5=0.
The circuit has a dependent source, so we need a dependent source
constraint equation that defines Ix in terms of the node voltages:
Ix=V1−V21+j2.
4. Step 4: Solve the three equations from Step 3 for V1, V2, and Ix:
V1=68.4-j16.8 V,V2=68-j26 V,Ix=3.76+j1.68 A.
5. Step 5: Use the phasor values from Step 4 to find the three branch
currents from Fig. 9.37 :

I a = V 1 10 =6.84−j1.68 A=7.04 −13.8°  A, I b = V 2 −20 I x 5 =

We find the steady-state values of the branch currents in the time-
domain circuit of Fig. 9.37 by applying the inverse phasor transform to
the results of Step 5. Remember that the frequency of the current source
in the circuit is 500 rad/s. The results are

9.9 The Mesh-Current Method

currents in resistive circuits. Finally, apply the inverse phasor transform to
the phasor voltages and currents to find the steady-state voltages and currents
in the time domain. We use the mesh current method to analyze a frequency-

The circuit in Fig. 9.40 has a dependent source, so we need a constraint
equation that defines Ix in terms of the mesh currents. The resulting
equation is
Ix=I1−I2.
4. Step 4: Solving the simultaneous equations in Step 3 gives
I1=-26-j52 A,I2=-24-j58 A,Ix=-2+j6 A.
5. Step 5: Finally, we use the mesh-current phasors from Step 4 to find the

9.10 The Transformer
A transformer is a device based on the magnetic coupling that characterizes
mutually coupled inductor coils. Transformers are used in both
communication and power circuits. In communication circuits, the
transformer is used to match impedances and eliminate dc signals from
portions of the system. In power circuits, transformers are used to establish ac
voltage levels that facilitate the transmission, distribution, and consumption
of electrical power. We need to know how a transformer behaves in the
sinusoidal steady state when analyzing both communication and power
systems. In this section, we will discuss the sinusoidal steady-state behavior
of the linear transformer, which is found primarily in communication
circuits. In Section 9.11, we will present the ideal transformer, which is
used to model the ferromagnetic transformers found in power systems.
When analyzing circuits containing mutually coupled inductor coils, we use
the mesh-current method. The node-voltage method is hard to use when
mutual inductance is present because the currents in the coupled coils cannot
be written by inspection as functions of the node voltages.
The Analysis of a Linear
Transformer Circuit
A simple transformer is formed when two coils are wound on a single core
to ensure magnetic coupling. Figure 9.41 shows the frequency-domain circuit
model of a system that uses a transformer to connect a load to a source. The
transformer winding connected to the source is called the primary winding,
and the winding connected to the load is called the secondary winding. The
transformer circuit parameters are
R1=the resistance of the primary winding,
R2=the resistance of the secondary winding,

L1=the self-inductance of the primary winding,
L2=the self-inductance of the secondary winding,
M=the mutual inductance.
Figure 9.41 The frequency
domain circuit model for a
transformer used to connect a
load to a source.
Figure 9.41 Full Alternative Text
The internal voltage of the sinusoidal source is Vs, and the internal
impedance of the source is Zs. The impedance ZL represents the load
connected to the secondary winding of the transformer. The phasor currents
I1 and I2 are the primary and secondary currents of the transformer,

respectively.
We analyze the circuit in Fig. 9.41 to find I1 and I2 as functions of the circuit
parameters Vs, Zs, R1, L1, L2, R2, M, ZL, and ω. Let’s write the two KVL
equations that describe the circuit:
Vs=(Zs+R1+jωL1)I1-jωMI2,0=-jωMI1+(R2+jωL2+ZL)I2.
We define
Z 11 = Z s + R 1 + j ω L 1 , (9.27)
Z 22 = R 2 + j ω L 2 + Z L , (9.28)
where Z11 is the total self-impedance of the mesh containing the primary
winding of the transformer and Z22 is the total self-impedance of the mesh
containing the secondary winding. Using the impedances defined in Eqs. 9.27
and 9.28, we solve the mesh-current equations for I1 and I2to give
I1=Z22Z11Z22+ω2M2Vs, (9.29)
I2=jωMZ11Z22+ω2M2Vs=jωMZ22I1. (9.30)
We are also interested in finding the impedance seen when we look into the
transformer from the terminals a and b. The internal source voltage VS is
attached to an equivalent impedance whose value is the ratio of the source-
voltage phasor to the primary current phasor, or
VsI1=Zint=Z11Z22+ω2M2Z22=Z11+ω2M2Z22.
The impedance at the terminals of the source is Zint − Zs, so
Zab=Z11+ω2M2Z22−Zs=R1+jωL1+ω2M2(R2+jωL2+ZL). (9.31)
Note that the impedance Zab is independent of the magnetic polarity of the
transformer because the mutual inductance M appears in Eq. 9.31 as a
squared quantity. The impedance Zab is interesting because it describes how
the transformer affects the impedance of the load as seen from the source.
Without the transformer, the load would be connected directly to the source,
and the source would see a load impedance of ZL; with the transformer, the
load is connected to the source through the transformer, and the source sees a

load impedance that is a modified version of ZL, as seen in the third term of
Eq. 9.31.
Reflected Impedance
The third term in Eq. 9.31 is called the reflected impedance (Zr) because it
is the equivalent impedance of the secondary coil and load impedance
transmitted, or reflected, to the primary side of the transformer. Note that the
reflected impedance exists because of the mutual inductance. If the two coils
are not coupled, M is zero, Zr is zero, and Zab is the self-impedance of the
primary coil.
To consider reflected impedance in more detail, we first express the load
impedance in rectangular form:
ZL=RL+jXL,
where the load reactance XL carries its own algebraic sign. That is, XL is a
positive number if the load is inductive and a negative number if the load is
capacitive. We can now write the reflected impedance in rectangular form:
Z r = ω 2 M 2 R 2 + R L +j( ω L 2 + X L ) = ω 2 M 2 [( R 2 + R L )−j(ω L 2
+ X L )] ( R 2 + R L ) 2 + (ω L 2 + X L ) 2 = ω 2 M 2 |  Z 22   | 2  [( R 2 + R
L )−j(ω L 2 + X L )]. 9.32
The derivation of Eq. 9.32 uses the fact that, when ZL is written in
rectangular form, the self-impedance of the mesh containing the secondary
winding is
Z22=R2+RL+j(ωL2+XL).
In Eq. 9.32 we see that the self-impedance of the secondary circuit is
reflected into the primary circuit by a scaling factor of (ωM/| Z22 |)2, and that
the sign of the reactive component (ωL2+XL) is reversed. Thus, the linear
transformer reflects the complex conjugate of the self-impedance of the
secondary circuit (Z22*) into the primary winding with a scalar multiplier.

Example 9.15 analyzes a circuit with a linear transformer.

5. The scaling factor by which Z22* is reflected is 8/9.
6. The impedance seen looking into the primary terminals of the
transformer is the impedance of the primary winding, Z11, plus the
reflected impedance, Zr; thus
Zab=200+j3600+800+j800=1000+j4400 Ω.
7. The Thévenin voltage is the open-circuit value of Vcd, which equals
j1200 times the open-circuit value of I1. The open-circuit value of I1 is
I 1 = 300  0° 700+j3700 = 79.67  −79.29°  mA.
Therefore
V Th = j1200(79.67  −79.29° )× 10 −3 = 95.60  10.71°  V.
The Thévenin impedance equals the impedance of the secondary
winding, plus the impedance reflected from the primary when the
voltage source is replaced by a short circuit. Thus

9.11 The Ideal Transformer
An ideal transformer consists of two magnetically coupled coils having N1
and N2 turns, respectively, and exhibiting these three properties:
1. The coefficient of coupling is unity (k=1).
2. The self-inductance of each coil is infinite (L1=L2=∞).
3. The coil losses, due to parasitic resistance, are negligible.
Understanding the behavior of ideal transformers begins with Eq. 9.31, which
describes the impedance at the terminals of a source connected to a linear
transformer. We repeat this equation in the following discussion and examine
it further.
Exploring Limiting Values
Equation 9.31, repeated here as Eq. 9.33, defines the relationship between the
input impedance (Zab) and load impedance (ZL) for a linear transformer:
Zab=Z11+ω2M2Z22−Zs
=R1+jωL1+ω2M2(R2+jωL2+ZL). (9.33)
Let’s consider what happens to Eq. 9.33 as L1 and L2 each become infinitely
large and, at the same time, the coefficient of coupling approaches unity.
Transformers wound on ferromagnetic cores can approach these conditions.
Even though such transformers are nonlinear, we can obtain some useful
information using an ideal model that ignores the nonlinearities.
To show how Zab changes when k=1 and L1 and L2 approach infinity, we
first introduce the notation
Z22=R2+RL+j(ωL2+XL)=R22+jX22

and then rearrange Eq.9.33:
Z ab = R 1 + ω 2 M 2 R 22 R 22 2 + X 22 2 +j( ω L 1 − ω 2 M 2 X 22 R 22 2
+ X 22 2 ) = R ab +j X ab . (9.34)
At this point, we must be careful with the imaginary part of Zab because, as
L1 and L2 approach infinity, Xab is the difference between two large
quantities. Thus, before letting L1 and L2 increase, we write the imaginary
part of Zab as
Xab=ωL1−(ωL1)(ωL1)X22R222+X222=ωL1 (1−ωL2X22R222+X222),
where we recognize that, when k=1, M2=L1L2. Putting the term multiplying
ωL1 over a common denominator gives
Xab=ωL1(R222+ωL2XL+XL2R222+X222).
Factoring ωL2 out of the numerator and (ωL2)2 out of the denominator, then
simplifying, yields
Xab=L1L2XL+(R222+XL2)/ωL2(R22/ωL2)2+[1+(XL/ωL2)]2.
As k approaches 1.0, the ratio L1/L2 approaches the constant value of
(N1/N2)2. This follows from the relationship between L1 and N1 (Eq. 6.21),
the relationship between L2 and N2 (Eq. 6.23), and the fact that, as the
coupling becomes extremely tight, the two permeances P1 and P2 become
equal. The expression for Xab simplifies to
Xab=(N1N2)2 XL,
as L1→∞, L2→∞, and k→1.0.
The same reasoning leads to simplification of the reflected resistance in Eq.
9.34:
ω2M2R22R222+X222=L1L2R22=(N1N2)2R22.
Substituting the simplified forms for Xab and the reflected resistance in Eq.
9.34 yields

Zab=R1+(N1N2)2R2+(N1N2)2(RL+jXL).
Compare this expression for Zab with the one given in Eq. 9.33. We see that
when the coefficient of coupling approaches unity and the self-inductances of
the coupled coils approach infinity, the transformer reflects the secondary
winding resistance and the load impedance to the primary side by a scaling
factor equal to the turns ratio (N1/N2) squared. Hence, we may describe the
terminal behavior of the ideal transformer in terms of two characteristics.
First, the magnitude of the volts per turn is the same for each coil, or
|V1N1|=|V2N2|. (9.35)
Second, the magnitude of the ampere-turns is the same for each coil, or
|I1N1|=|I2N2|. (9.36)
We use magnitude signs in Eqs. 9.35 and 9.36 because we have not yet
established reference polarities for the currents and voltages; we discuss the
removal of the magnitude signs shortly.
Figure 9.44 shows two lossless (R1=R2=0) magnetically coupled coils. We
use Fig. 9.44 to validate Eqs. 9.35 and 9.36. In Fig. 9.44(a), coil 2 is open; in
Fig. 9.44(b), coil 2 is shorted. Although we carry out the following analysis
in terms of sinusoidal steady-state operation, the results also apply to
instantaneous values of v and i.

Determining the Voltage and
Current Ratios
Note in Fig. 9.44(a) that the voltage at the terminals of the open-circuit coil is
entirely the result of the current in coil 1; therefore,

V2=jωMI1.
The current in coil 1 is
I1=V1jωL1.
Thus,
V2=ML1V1.
For unity coupling (k=1), the mutual inductance equals L1L2, so the
expression for V2 becomes
V2=L2L1 V1.
For unity coupling, the flux linking coil 1 is the same as the flux linking coil
2, so we need only one permeance to describe the self-inductance of each
coil. Thus,
V2=N22PN12PV1=N2N1V1
or
Voltage Relationship for an Ideal
Transformer
V1N1=V2N2. (9.37)
Summing the voltages around the shorted coil of Fig. 9.44(b) yields
0=−jωMI1+jωL2I2,
which, when k=1, gives
I1I2=L2M=L2L1L2=L2L1=N2N1.

Therefore,

I1N1=I2N2. (9.38)
Figure 9.45 shows the graphic symbol for an ideal transformer. The vertical
lines in the symbol represent the layers of magnetic material from which
ferromagnetic cores are often made. Coils wound on a ferromagnetic core
behave very much like an ideal transformer, for several reasons. The
ferromagnetic material creates a space with high permeance. Thus, most of
the magnetic flux is trapped inside the core material, establishing tight
magnetic coupling between coils that share the same core. High permeance
also means high self-inductance because L=N2P. Finally, ferromagnetically
coupled coils efficiently transfer power from one coil to the other.
Efficiencies in excess of 95% are common, so neglecting losses is a valid
approximation for many applications.

Determining the Polarity of the
Voltage and Current Ratios
We now turn to the removal of the magnitude signs from Eqs. 9.35 and 9.36.
Note that magnitude signs do not appear in Eqs. 9.37 and 9.38 because we
established reference polarities for voltages and reference directions for
currents in Fig. 9.44. In addition, we specified the magnetic polarity dots of
the two coupled coils.
The rules for assigning the proper algebraic sign to Eqs. 9.35 and 9.36 are as
follows:
Dot Convention for Ideal
Transformers
If the coil voltages V1 and V2 are both positive or negative at the dot-marked
terminals, use a plus sign in Eq. 9.35. Otherwise, use a negative sign.
If the coil currents I1 and I2 are both directed into or out of the dot-marked
terminals, use a minus sign in Eq. 9.36. Otherwise, use a plus sign.
The four circuits shown in Fig. 9.46 illustrate these rules.

The turns ratio for the two windings is an important parameter of the ideal

Solution
1. We begin by transforming the circuit to the frequency domain. The

an impedance of j2 Ω; and the 125 μH inductor has an impedance of

Writing a KCL equation for the left-hand mesh in Fig. 9.49 gives
2500  0° =( 0.25 + j 2 ) I 1  +  V 1 .

Using the relationship between V1 and V2 for the ideal transformer and
using Ohm’s law to express V2 in terms of I2, we have
V1=10V2=10[(0.2375+j0.05)I2].
Because
I2=10I1
we have
V1=10(0.2375+j0.05)(10I1)=(23.75+j5)I1.
Therefore
2500  0° =( 24+j7 ) I 1 ,
or
I 1 =100  −16.26°  A.
Thus, the steady-state expression for i1 is
i1=100cos(400t−16.26°)A.
2. V 1 = 2500 0°  − ( 100  −16.26° )( 0.25 + j2 ) = 2420−j185=2427.06 
−4.37°  V.
Hence, in the steady state
v1=2427.06 cos(400t−4.37°) V.
3. I 2 =10 I 1 =1000  −16.26°  A.
Therefore, in the steady state
i2=1000cos(400t−16.26°) A.
4. V 2 =0.1 V 1 =242.71  −4.37°  V,

so in the steady state,

Using an Ideal Transformer for
Impedance Matching
Ideal transformers can be used to increase or decrease the impedance level of
a load, as illustrated by the circuit shown in Fig. 9.50. The impedance seen by
the practical voltage source (Vs in series with Zs) is V1/I1. The voltage and
current at the terminals of the load impedance (V2 and I2) are related to V1
and I1 by the transformer turns ratio; thus
V1=V2a,
Figure 9.50 Using an ideal
transformer to couple a load to
a source.

Figure 9.50 Full Alternative Text
and
I1=aI2.
Therefore, the impedance seen by the practical source is
ZIN=V1I1=1a2 V2I2,
but the ratio V2/I2 is the load impedance ZL, so the expression for ZIN
becomes
ZIN=1a2ZL. (9.40)
Thus, the ideal transformer’s secondary coil reflects the load impedance back
to the primary coil, with the scaling factor 1/a2.
Note that the ideal transformer changes the magnitude of ZL but does not
affect its phase angle. Whether ZIN is greater or less than ZL depends on the
turns ratio a.The ideal transformer—or its practical counterpart, the
ferromagnetic core transformer—can be used to match the magnitude of ZL
to the magnitude of Zs. We will discuss why this may be desirable in Chapter
10.
Ideal transformers are also used to increase or decrease voltages from a
source to a load, as we will see in Chapter 10. Thus, ideal transformers are
used widely in the electric utility industry, where it is desirable to decrease,
or step down, the voltage level at the power line to safer residential voltage
levels.

9.12 Phasor Diagrams
When we analyze the sinusoidal steady-state operation of a circuit using
phasors, a diagram of the phasor currents and voltages can give us additional
insight into the circuit’s behavior. A phasor diagram shows the magnitude
and phase angle of each phasor quantity in the complex-number plane. Phase
angles are measured counterclockwise from the positive real axis, and
magnitudes are measured from the origin of the axes. For example, Fig. 9.51
shows the phasor quantities 10  30° , 12  150° , 5  −45° , and 8  −170° .
Figure 9.51 A graphic
representation of phasors.
Figure 9.51 Full Alternative Text

Because constructing phasor diagrams for circuits usually involves both
currents and voltages, we use two different magnitude scales, one for currents
and one for voltages. Visualizing a phasor on the complex-number plane is a
good way to check your calculations. For example, suppose you convert the
phasor −7–j3 to polar form. Before making your calculation, you should
anticipate a magnitude greater than 7 and an angle in the third quadrant that is
more negative than −135° or less positive than 225°, as illustrated in Fig.
9.52.

Solution

According to KCL, the sum of the currents IR, IL, and IC must equal the
source current Is. If we assume that the phase angle of the voltage Vm is
zero, we can draw the current phasors for each of the components. The
current phasor for the inductor is
I L = V m   0° j( 5000 )( 0.2× 10 −3 ) = V m   - 90° ,
whereas the current phasor for the capacitor is
I C = V m   0° −j( 5000 )(50× 10 −6 ) =4 V m   90° ,
and the current phasor for the resistor is
I R = V m   0° R = V m R   0° .
These phasors are shown in Fig. 9.54. The phasor diagram also shows the
source current phasor, sketched as a dashed line, which must be the sum of
the current phasors of the three circuit components and must be at an angle
that is 45° more positive than the current phasor for the resistor. As you can
see, summing the phasors makes an isosceles triangle, so the length of the
current phasor for the resistor must equal 3Vm. Therefore, the value of the
resistor is 13 Ω.

We begin by assuming zero capacitance across the load. After constructing
the phasor diagram for the zero-capacitance case, we can add the capacitor
and study its effect on the amplitude of Vs, holding the amplitude of VL
constant. Figure 9.56 shows the frequency-domain equivalent of the circuit in
Fig. 9.55. We added the phasor branch currents I, Ia, and Ib to Fig. 9.56 to

phasors before and after the capacitor is added.

Figure 9.57 Full Alternative Text
Relating the phasor diagram to the circuit shown in Fig. 9.56, we make the

following observations:
We choose VL as our reference because we are holding its amplitude
constant. For convenience, we place this phasor on the positive real axis.
We know that Ia is in phase with VL and that its magnitude is |VL|/R2.
(On the phasor diagram, the magnitude scale for the current phasors is
independent of the magnitude scale for the voltage phasors.)
We know that Ib lags behind VL by 90° and that its magnitude is |VL|/
ωL2.
The current I is equal to the sum of Ia and Ib.
The voltage drop across R1 is in phase with the current I, and the
voltage drop across jωL1 leads I by 90°.
The source voltage is given by Vs=VL + (R1 + jωL1)I.
The completed phasor diagram shown in Step 6 of Fig. 9.57 shows the
amplitude and phase angle relationships among all the currents and voltages
in Fig. 9.56.
Now add the capacitor branch shown in Fig. 9.58. We are holding VL
constant, so we construct the phasor diagram for the circuit in Fig. 9.58
following the same steps as those in Fig. 9.57, except that, in Step 4, we add
the capacitor current Ic to the diagram, where Ic leads VL by 90°, with
|IC|=|VLωC|. Figure 9.59 shows the effect of Ic on the current I: Both the
magnitude and phase angle of I change as the magnitude of Ic changes. As I
changes, so do the magnitude and phase angle of the voltage drop across the
impedance (R1+jωL1), resulting in changes to the magnitude and phase angle
of Vs. The phasor diagram shown in Fig. 9.60 depicts these observations. The
dashed phasors represent the pertinent currents and voltages before adding
the capacitor.

Thus, comparing the dashed phasors of I, R1I, jωL1I, and Vs with their solid
counterparts clearly shows the effect of adding C to the circuit. In particular,
adding the capacitor reduces the source voltage amplitude while maintaining
the load voltage amplitude. Practically, this result means that, as the load
increases (i.e., as Ia and Ib increase), we can add capacitors to the system
(i.e., increase Ic), so that under heavy load conditions we can maintain VL
without increasing the amplitude of the source voltage.

Practical Perspective
A Household Distribution Circuit

After determining the loads on the three-wire distribution circuit prior to the
interruption of fuse A, you are able to construct the frequency-domain circuit
model shown in Fig. 9.61. The impedances of the wires connecting the source
to the loads are assumed negligible.
Figure 9.61 The three-wire
household distribution circuit
model.

Figure 9.61 Full Alternative Text
Let’s begin by calculating all of the branch current phasors in the figure, prior
to the interruption of Fuse A. We calculate I4, I5, and I6 using Ohm’s law:
I 4 = 120 24 =5 0° A; I 5 = 120 12 =10 0° A; I 6 = 240 8.4+j6.3
=18.29−j13.71A=22.86 −36.87° A.
We calculate I1, I2, and I3 using KCL and the other branch currents:
I 1 = I 4 + I 6 =23.29−j13.71A=27.02 −30.5° A; I 2 = I 5 − I 4 =5 0° A; I 3 =
I 5 + I 6 =28.29−j13.71A=31.44 −25.87° A.
Now calculate those same branch current phasors after Fuse A is interrupted.
We assume that the fan motor behaves like a short circuit when it stalls, and
the interrupted fuse behaves like an open circuit. The circuit model now looks
like Fig. 9.62. To analyze this circuit, we write two mesh current equations
using the mesh current phasors shown in Fig. 9.62:
12(Ia-Ib)=120;24Ib+12(Ib-Ia)=0.
Figure 9.62 The circuit in Fig.
9.61 after Fuse A is interrupted
and the fan motor stalls.

Figure 9.62 Full Alternative Text
Solving the mesh current equations, we get
Ia=15 A;Ib=5A.
Using these mesh current phasors to calculate the new branch current phasors
from Fig. 9.61, we get
I 1 = 0A; I 2 = I 3 = I a =15A; I 6 = I b =5A; I 4 = I 1 − I 6 =−5A; I 5 = I 2 + I
4 =10A.
We can see that even though Fuse A is interrupted and the I1 branch current
is zero, all of the other branch currents are nonzero. The television and clock

continued to operate because they are represented by the 12 Ω load that still
has an ample supply of current.

Summary
The general equation for a sinusoidal source is
v=Vm cos(ωt + ϕ) (voltage source),
or
i=Im cos(ωt + ϕ) (current source),
where Vm (or Im) is the maximum amplitude, ω is the frequency, and ϕ
is the phase angle. (See page 320.)
The frequency, ω, of a sinusoidal response is the same as the frequency
of the sinusoidal source driving the circuit. The amplitude and phase
angle of the response are usually different from those of the source. (See
page 323.)
The best way to find the steady-state voltages and currents in a circuit
driven by sinusoidal sources is to perform the analysis in the frequency
domain. The following mathematical transforms allow us to move
between the time and frequency domains.
The phasor transform (from the time domain to the frequency
domain):
V=Vmejϕ=P{Vmcos(ωt+ϕ)}.
The inverse phasor transform (from the frequency domain to the
time domain):
P−1{Vmejϕ=R{Vmejϕejωt}.
(See pages 324–325.)
In a circuit with a sinusoidal source, the voltage leads the current by 90°

at the terminals of an inductor, and the current leads the voltage by 90°
at the terminals of a capacitor. (See pages 327–331.)
Impedance (Z) relates the phasor current and phasor voltage for
resistors, inductors, and capacitors in an equation that has the same form
as Ohm’s law,
V=ZI,
where the reference direction for I obeys the passive sign convention.
The reciprocal of impedance is admittance (Y), so another way to
express the current-voltage relationship for resistors, inductors, and
capacitors in the frequency domain is
V=I/Y.
(See pages 330 and 336.)
The equations for impedance and admittance for resistors, inductors, and
capacitors are summarized in Table 9.3.
Table 9.3 Impedance and
Related Values

All of the circuit analysis techniques developed in Chapters 2–4 for
resistive circuits also apply to sinusoidal steady-state circuits in the
frequency domain. These techniques include KVL, KCL, series, and
parallel combinations of impedances, voltage and current division, node-
voltage and mesh-current methods, Thévenin and Norton equivalents,
and source transformation.
The two-winding linear transformer is a coupling device made up of
two coils wound on the same nonmagnetic core. Reflected impedance
is the impedance of the secondary circuit as seen from the terminals of
the primary circuit, or vice versa. The reflected impedance of a linear
transformer seen from the primary side is the complex conjugate of the
self-impedance of the secondary circuit scaled by the factor
(ωM/|Z22|)2. (See pages 347–349.)
The two-winding ideal transformer is a linear transformer with the
following special properties: perfect coupling (k=1), infinite self-
inductance in each coil (L1=L2=∞), and lossless coils (R1=R2=0). The
circuit behavior is governed by the turns ratio a=N2/N1. In particular,
the volts per turn is the same for each winding, or
V1N1=±V2N2,
and the ampere turns are the same for each winding, or
N1I1=±N2I2.

Chapter Objectives
1. Understand the following ac power concepts, their relationships to one
another, and how to calculate them in a circuit:
Instantaneous power;
Average (real) power;
Reactive power;
Complex power; and
Power factor.
2. Understand the condition for maximum real power delivered to a load in
an ac circuit and be able to calculate the load impedance required to
deliver maximum real power to the load.
3. Be able to calculate all forms of ac power in ac circuits with linear
transformers and in ac circuits with ideal transformers.
Nearly all electric energy is supplied by sinusoidal voltages and currents.
Thus, after our Chapter 9 discussion of sinusoidal circuits, we now consider
sinusoidal steady-state power calculations. We are primarily interested in the
average power delivered to or supplied by a pair of terminals in the sinusoidal
steady state. We also present other power quantities, including reactive
power, complex power, and apparent power.
We begin and end this chapter with two concepts that should be very familiar
to you from previous chapters: the basic equation for power (Section 10.1)
and maximum power transfer (Section 10.6). In between, we discuss the
general techniques for calculating power, which will be familiar from your
studies in Chapters 1 and 4, although some additional mathematical
techniques are required here to deal with sinusoidal, rather than dc, signals.
We also revisit the rms value of a sinusoid, briefly introduced in Chapter 9,

because it is used extensively in power calculations.
A wide variety of problems deal with the delivery of energy to do work,
ranging from determining the power rating for safely and efficiently
operating an appliance to designing the vast array of generators, transformers,
and wires that provide electric energy to household and industrial consumers.
Thus, power engineering is an important and exciting subdiscipline in
electrical engineering.
Practical Perspective
Vampire Power
Even when we are not using many of the common electrical devices found in
our homes, schools, and businesses, they can still be consuming power. This
“standby power” can run an internal clock, charge batteries, display time or
other quantities, monitor temperature or other environmental measures, or
search for signals to receive. Devices such as microwave ovens, DVRs,
televisions, remote controls, and computers all consume power when not in
use.
The ac adapters used to charge many portable devices are a common source
of standby power. Even when the device is unplugged from the adapter, the
adapter can continue to consume power if it is plugged into the wall outlet.
Because the plug on the adapter looks somewhat like vampire fangs, standby
power has become known as “vampire power.” It is power that is used even
while we sleep.
How much vampire power do electrical devices in our home use over the
course of a year? Is there a way to reduce or eliminate vampire power? These
questions are explored in the Practical Perspective example at the end of the
chaptertext and in the chapter problems.

10.1 Instantaneous Power
Consider the familiar circuit in Fig. 10.1. Here, v and i are steady-state
sinusoidal signals, given by
Figure 10.1 The black box
representation of a circuit used
for calculating power.
Figure 10.1 Full Alternative Text
v=Vmcos(ωt+θv),i=Imcos(ωt+θi),
where θv is the voltage phase angle and θi is the current phase angle. Using
the passive sign convention, we find that the power at any instant of time is
p=vi.
This is instantaneous power. Instantaneous power is measured in watts
when the voltage is in volts and the current is in amperes.

Because the circuit operates in the sinusoidal steady state, we can choose any
convenient reference for zero time. It is convenient to define zero time at the
instant the current passes through a positive maximum. This reference system
requires a shift of both the voltage and current by θi. Thus, the equations for
voltage and current become
v=Vm cos (ωt+θv−θi),(10.1)
i=Imcosωt.(10.2)
When we substitute Eqs. 10.1 and 10.2 into the power equation, the
expression for the instantaneous power becomes
p=VmImcos(ωt+θv−θi)cosωt.
We could use this equation directly to find the average power. Instead, we
use a couple of trigonometric identities to construct a much more informative
expression. We begin with the trigonometric identity1
1 See Appendix F.
cos α cos β=12cos (α−β)+12cos (α+β)
and let α=ωt+ θv− θi and β=ωt to give
p=VmIm2cos(θv−θi)+VmIm2cos(2ωt+θv−θi).
Now use the trigonometric identity
cos (α+β)=cos α cos β− sin α sin β
to expand the second term on the right-hand side of the expression for p,
which gives
Instantaneous Power
p=VmIm2cos (θv−θi)+VmIm2cos (θv− θi) cos 2ωt−VmIm2sin (θv− 
θi) sin 2ωt.(10.3)

Examine the three terms on the right-hand side of Eq. 10.3. The first term is a
constant; it is not a function of time. The other two terms are sinusoids, each
with a frequency that is double the frequency of the voltage and current in
Eqs. 10.1 and 10.2. You can make these same observations in the plot of Fig.
10.2, which depicts v, i, and p, assuming θv=60° and θi=0°. You can see that
the frequency of the instantaneous power is twice the frequency of the
voltage or current. Therefore, the instantaneous power goes through two
complete cycles for every cycle of either the voltage or the current.
Figure 10.2 Instantaneous
power, voltage, and current
versus ωt for steady-state
sinusoidal operation.


Figure 10.2 Full Alternative Text
Also note that the instantaneous power may be negative for a portion of each
cycle. When the power is negative, the energy stored in the inductors or
capacitors is being extracted. The instantaneous power varies with time when
a circuit operates in the sinusoidal steady state. As a result, some motor-
driven appliances (such as refrigerators) experience vibration and require
resilient motor mountings to prevent excessive vibration.
In the next section, we use Eq. 10.3 to find the average power at the terminals
of the circuit in Fig. 10.1 and also introduce the concept of reactive power.

10.2 Average and Reactive Power
As we have already noted, Eq. 10.3 has three terms, which we can rewrite as
follows:
p=P+P cos 2ωt−Q sin 2ωt,(10.4)
where
Average (Real) Power
P=VmIm2cos(θv−θi),(10.5)
Reactive Power
Q=VmIm2sin(θv−θi).(10.6)
P is the average power, and Q is the reactive power. Average power is
sometimes called real power because it describes the power in a circuit that
is transformed from electric to nonelectric energy. Although the two terms
are interchangeable, we primarily use the term average power in this text.
It is easy to see why P is called the average power: it is the average of the
instantaneous power over one period. In equation form,
P=1T∫tot0+Tp dt,(10.7)
where T is the period of the sinusoidal function. The limits on the integral
imply that we can initiate the integration process at any convenient time t0
but that we must terminate the integration exactly one period later. (We could
integrate over nT periods, where n is an integer, provided we multiply the
integral by 1/nT.)

We could find the average power by substituting Eq. 10.3 directly into Eq.
10.7 and integrating. But the average value of p is given by the first term on
the right-hand side of Eq. 10.3 because the integral of both cos 2ωt and
sin 2ωt over one period is zero. Thus, the average power is given in Eq. 10.5.
We can develop a better understanding of all the terms in Eq. 10.4 and the
relationships among them by examining the power in circuits that are purely
resistive, purely inductive, or purely capacitive.
Power for Purely Resistive Circuits
If the circuit between the terminals in Fig. 10.1 is purely resistive, the voltage
and current are in phase, which means that θv= θi. Equation 10.4 then reduces
to
p=P+P cos 2ωt.
The instantaneous power for a resistor is called the instantaneous real
power. Figure 10.3 shows a graph of p for a purely resistive circuit with
ω=377 rad/s. By definition, the average power, P, is the average of p over one
period. Looking at the graph, we see that P=1 for this circuit. Note that the
instantaneous real power can never be negative, which is seen in its equation
and is also shown in Fig. 10.3. In other words, power cannot be extracted
from a purely resistive network. Resistors dissipate electric energy in the
form of thermal energy.
Figure 10.3 Instantaneous
power and average power for a
purely resistive circuit.

Figure 10.3 Full Alternative Text
Power for Purely Inductive Circuits
If the circuit between the terminals in Fig. 10.1 is purely inductive, the
current lags the voltage by 90° (that is, θi=θv− 90°); therefore, θv− θi=+90°.
The expression for the instantaneous power then reduces to

p=−Qsin2ωt.
In a purely inductive circuit, the average power is zero, and energy is not
transformed from electric to nonelectric form. Instead, the instantaneous
power in a purely inductive circuit is continually exchanged between the
circuit and the source driving the circuit, at a frequency of 2ω. When p is
positive, energy is stored in the magnetic fields associated with the inductive
elements, and when p is negative, energy is extracted from the magnetic
fields.
We measure the power of purely inductive circuits using the reactive power
Q. The name reactive power recognizes an inductor as a reactive element; its
impedance is purely reactive. Note that average power P and reactive power
Q carry the same dimension. To distinguish between average and reactive
power, we use the units watt (W) for average power and var (volt-amp
reactive, or VAR) for reactive power. Figure 10.4 plots the instantaneous
power for a purely inductive circuit, assuming ω=377 rad/s and Q=1 VAR.
Figure 10.4 Instantaneous
power, average power, and
reactive power for a purely
inductive circuit.

Figure 10.4 Full Alternative Text
Power for Purely Capacitive

Circuits
If the circuit between the terminals in Fig. 10.1 is purely capacitive, the
current leads the voltage by 90° (that is, θi= θv+ 90°); thus, θv− θi=−90°. The
expression for the instantaneous power then becomes
p=−Qsin2ωt.
Again, the average power is zero, and energy is not transformed from electric
to nonelectric form. Instead, the power is continually exchanged between the
source driving the circuit and the electric field associated with the capacitive
elements. Figure 10.5 plots the instantaneous power for a purely capacitive
circuit, assuming ω=377 rad/s and Q=−1 VAR.
Figure 10.5 Instantaneous
power, average power, and
reactive power for a purely
capacitive circuit.

Figure 10.5 Full Alternative Text
Note that the decision to use the current as the reference (see Eq. 10.2) means
that Q is positive for inductors (because θv− θi=90°) and negative for

capacitors (because θv− θi=−90°). Power engineers recognize this difference
in the algebraic sign of Q by saying that inductors demand (or absorb)
magnetizing vars and capacitors furnish (or deliver) magnetizing vars. We
say more about this convention later.
The Power Factor
The angle θv− θi is used when computing both average and reactive power
and is referred to as the power factor angle. The cosine of this angle is called
the power factor, abbreviated pf, and the sine of this angle is called the
reactive factor, abbreviated rf. Thus
Power Factor
pf=cos(θv−θi),(10.8)
rf=sin(θv−θi).
Even if you know the value of the power factor, you cannot determine the
power factor angle because cos (θv−θi)=cos (θi− θv). To completely describe
this angle, we use the phrases lagging power factor and leading power
factor. Lagging power factor means that current lags voltage—hence, an
inductive load. Leading power factor means that current leads voltage—
hence, a capacitive load. Both the power factor and the reactive factor are
convenient quantities to use in describing electrical loads.
Example 10.1 illustrates the interpretation of P and Q using numerical
calculations.
Example 10.1 Calculating Average
and Reactive Power
1. Calculate the average power and the reactive power at the terminals of

the network shown in Fig. 10.6 if
Figure 10.6 A pair of
terminals used for
calculating power.

2. State whether the network inside the box is absorbing or delivering
average power.
3. State whether the network inside the box is absorbing or supplying
magnetizing vars.
Solution
1. Because i is expressed in terms of the sine function, the first step in
calculating P and Q is to rewrite i as a cosine function:
i=4 cos (ωt−105°) A.

We now calculate P and Q directly from Eqs. 10.5 and 10.6, using the
passive sign convention. Thus
P=12(100)(4) cos[ 15∘−(−105∘) ]=−100 W,Q=12100(4) sin[ 15∘
−(−105∘) ]=173.21 VAR.
2. The value of P is negative, so the network inside the box is delivering
average power to the terminals.
3. The value of Q is positive, so the network inside the box is absorbing
magnetizing vars at its terminals.

Appliance Ratings
Average power is used to quantify the power needs of household appliances.
Your monthly electric bill is based on the number of kilowatt-hours used by
the household. Table 10.1 presents data for some common appliances,
including the average hours per month and the number of months the

appliance is used, the annual kilowatt-hour (kwh) consumption, and the
annual cost of operation. For example, a coffee maker has a monthly use of
30 hours, or one hour per day, is used every month of the year, and consumes
60 kwh per year, at a cost of about $10. Therefore, the coffee maker
consumes 60 kwh/360 hours=0.167 kW=167 W of power during the hour it
operates each day.

The branch circuit supplying the outlets in a typical home kitchen is wired

breaker. Assume that the following 120 V appliances are in operation at the
same time: a coffee maker, microwave, dishwasher, and older refrigerator.
Will the circuit be interrupted by the protective device?
Solution
We have already estimated that the average power used by the coffee maker
is 167 W. Using Table 10.1, we find that the average power used by the other
three appliances is

Pmicrowave=101(9)(12)=0.935 kW=935 W,Pdishwasher=293(30)
(12)=0.814 kW=814 W,Prefrigerator=533(720)(12)=0.062 kW=62 W.
The total average power used by the four appliances is
Ptotal=167+935+814+62=1978 W.
The total current in the protective device is
I=PtotalV=1978120=16.5 A.
Since the current is less than 20 A, the protective device will not interrupt the
circuit.

10.3 The rms Value and Power
Calculations
When we introduced the rms value of a sinusoidal voltage (or current) in
Section 9.1, we mentioned that it would play an important role in power
calculations. We now discuss this role.
Assume a sinusoidal voltage is applied to the terminals of a resistor, as shown
in Fig. 10.7, and that we want to determine the average power delivered to
the resistor. From Eq. 10.7,
Figure 10.7 A sinusoidal
voltage applied to the terminals
of a resistor.
P=1T∫t0t0+TVm2 cos2(ωt+ ϕv)R dt=1R[ 1T∫t0t0+TVm2 cos2(ωt+ ϕv) dt ].
From Eq. 9.4, we see that the bracketed term is the rms value of the voltage
squared. Therefore, the average power delivered to R is

P=Vrms2R.
If the resistor has a sinusoidal current, say, Im cos (ωt+ ϕi), the average power
delivered to the resistor is
P=Irms2R.
The rms value is also referred to as the effective value of the sinusoidal
voltage (or current). The rms value has an interesting property: Given an
equivalent resistive load, R, and an equivalent time period, T, the rms value
of a sinusoidal source delivers the same energy to R as does a dc source of
the same value. For example, a dc source of 100 V delivers the same energy
in T seconds that a sinusoidal source of 100 V(rms) delivers, assuming
equivalent load resistances (see Problem 10.16). Figure 10.8 demonstrates
this equivalence. The effect of the two sources is identical with respect to
energy delivery. So we use the terms effective value and rms value
interchangeably.
Figure 10.8 The effective value
of vs [100 V(rms)] delivers the
same power to R as the dc
voltage vs [100 V(dc)].

Figure 10.8 Full Alternative Text
The average power given by Eq. 10.5 and the reactive power given by Eq.
10.6 can be written in terms of effective values:
P=VmIm2cos (θv− θi)=Vm2Im2cos (θv− θi)=VrmsIrmscos(θv−θi)(10.9)
and, by similar manipulation,
Q=VrmsIrmssin (θv− θi).(10.10)

Using the effective values of sinusoidal signals in power calculations is so
widespread that we specify the voltage and current ratings of circuits and
equipment using rms values. For example, the voltage rating of residential
electric wiring is often 240 V/120 V service. These voltages are the rms
values of the sinusoidal voltages supplied by the utility company, which
provides power at two voltage levels, accommodating low-voltage appliances
(such as televisions) and higher-voltage appliances (such as electric ranges).
Appliances such as electric lamps, irons, and toasters all carry rms ratings on
their nameplates. For example, a 120 V, 100 W lamp has a resistance of
1202/100, or 144 Ω, and draws an rms current of 120/144, or 0.833 A. The
peak value of the lamp current is 0.8332, or 1.18 A.
The phasor transform of a sinusoidal function may also be expressed as an
rms value. The magnitude of the rms phasor is equal to the rms value of the
sinusoidal function. We indicate that a phasor is based on an rms value using
either an explicit statement, a parenthetical “rms” adjacent to the phasor’s
units, or the subscript “rms.”
In Example 10.3, we use rms values to calculate power.
Example 10.3 Determining Average
Power Delivered to a Resistor by a
Sinusoidal Voltage
1. A sinusoidal voltage having a maximum amplitude of 625 V is applied
to the terminals of a 50 Ω resistor. Find the average power delivered to
the resistor.
2. Repeat (a) by first finding the current in the resistor.
Solution

1. The rms value of the sinusoidal voltage is 625/2, or approximately
441.94 V. The average power delivered to the 50 Ω resistor is
P=Vrms2R=(441.94)250=3906.25 W.
2. The maximum amplitude of the current in the resistor is 625/50, or 12.5
A. The rms value of the current is 12.5/2, or approximately 8.84 A.
Hence, the average power delivered to the resistor is
P=(8.84)250=3906.25 W.

10.4 Complex Power
Before discussing the methods for calculating real and reactive power in
circuits operating in the sinusoidal steady state, we introduce and define
complex power. Complex power is the complex sum of real power and
reactive power, or
Complex Power
S=P+jQ.(10.11)
As you will see, we can compute the complex power using the voltage and
current phasors for a circuit. Equation 10.11 can then be used to determine
the average and reactive power, because P=R{S} and Q=I {S}.
Complex power has the same units as average or reactive power. However, to
distinguish complex power from both average and reactive power, we use the
units volt-amps (VA). Thus, we use volt-amps for complex power, watts for
average power, and vars for reactive power, as summarized in Table 10.2.
Table 10.2 Three Power
Quantities and Their Units

Complex power provides a geometric relationship among several different
power quantities. In Eq. 10.11, envision P, Q, and |S| as the sides of a right
triangle, as shown in Fig. 10.9. We can show that the angle θ in the power
triangle is the power factor angle θv− θi. For the right triangle shown in Fig.
10.9,
Figure 10.9 A power triangle.
Figure 10.9 Full Alternative Text
tanθ=QP.
But from the definitions of P and Q (Eqs. 10.5 and 10.6, respectively),
QP=(VmIm/2) sin (θv− θi)(VmIm/2) cos (θv− θi)=tan(θv−θi).
Therefore, θ=θv− θi. The geometric relationships for a right triangle mean
that the four power triangle dimensions (the three sides and the power factor
angle) can be determined if any two of the four are known.
The magnitude of complex power is referred to as apparent power.
Specifically,
Apparent Power

|S|=P2+Q2.(10.12)
Apparent power, like complex power, is measured in volt-amps. The apparent
power, or volt-amp, requirement of a device designed to convert electric
energy to a nonelectric form is more useful than the average power
requirement. The apparent power represents the volt-amp capacity required to
supply the average power used by the device. As you can see from the power
triangle in Fig. 10.9, unless the power factor angle is 0° (that is, the device is
purely resistive, pf=1, and Q=0), the volt-amp capacity required by the device
is larger than the average power used by the device.
Many appliances (including refrigerators, fans, air conditioners, fluorescent
lighting fixtures, and washing machines) and most industrial loads operate at
a lagging power factor. The power factor of these loads can be corrected
either by adding a capacitor to the device itself or by connecting capacitors
across the line feeding the load; the latter method is often used for large
industrial loads. Many of the problems at the end of the chapter explore
methods for correcting a lagging power factor load and improving the
operation of a circuit.
Example 10.4 uses a power triangle to calculate several quantities associated
with power in an electrical load.
Example 10.4 Calculating Complex
Power
An electrical load operates at 240 V(rms). The load absorbs an average power
of 8 kW at a lagging power factor of 0.8.
1. Calculate the complex power of the load.
2. Calculate the impedance of the load, Z.
Solution

1. Because the power factor is lagging, we know that the load is inductive
and that the algebraic sign of the reactive power is positive. From the
power triangle shown in Fig. 10.10,
Figure 10.10 A power
triangle.
Figure 10.10 Full Alternative Text
P=|  S  | cos θ,Q=|  S  | sin θ.
Since cos θ=0.8, we know that sin θ=0.6. Therefore
| S |=Pcosθ=80000.8=10,000=10 kVA,Q=| S |sinθ=(10,000)(0.6)=6 kvar,
and
S=P+jQ=8+j6 kVA.
2. From the problem statement, we know that P = 8 kW for the load. Using
Eq. 10.9,
P=VrmsIrms cos (θv− θi)=(240)Irms (0.8)=8000 W.

Solving for Irms,
Irms=41.67 A(rms).
We already know the angle of the load impedance because it is the
power factor angle:
θ=cos −1(0.8)=36.87°.
We also know that θ is positive because the power factor is lagging,
indicating an inductive load. Compute the load impedance magnitude
using its definition as the ratio of the magnitude of the load voltage to
the magnitude of the load current:
| Z | = | Vrms || Irms |=24041.67=5.76.
Hence,
Z=5.76  36.87° Ω=4.608+j3.456 Ω.

10.5 Power Calculations
We now develop additional equations for calculating real, reactive, and
complex power. We begin by combining Eqs. 10.5, 10.6, and 10.11 to get
S = V m I m 2 cos( θ υ − θ i )+j V m I m 2 sin( θ υ − θ i ) = V m I m 2 [cos( θ
υ − θ i )+jsin( θ υ − θ i )] = V m I m 2 e j( θ υ − θ i ) = 1 2 V m I m ( θ υ − θ i
) .
If we use the rms values of the sinusoidal voltage and current, the expression
for the complex power becomes
S=VrmsIrms (θv− θi).
Therefore, if the phasor current and voltage are known at a pair of terminals,
the complex power associated with that pair of terminals is either one half the
product of the phasor voltage and the conjugate of the phasor current, or the
product of the rms phasor voltage and the conjugate of the rms phasor
current. We can show this for the rms phasor voltage and current in Fig.
10.11 as follows:

S=VrmsIrms*.(10.13)
Note that Irms*=Irmse−jθi follows from Euler’s identity and the
trigonometric identities cos (−θ)=cos(θ) and sin (−θ)=− sin (θ):
Irmse−jθi=Irmscos(−θi)+jIrmssin(−θi)=Irmscos(θi)−jIrmssin(θi)=Irms*.
If the voltage and current phasors are not specified as rms values, the
derivation technique used for Eq. 10.13 yields
S=12VI*.(10.14)
Both Eqs. 10.13 and 10.14 use the passive sign convention. If the current
reference is in the direction of the voltage rise across the terminals, we insert
a minus sign on the right-hand side of each equation.
Example 10.5 uses Eq. 10.14 in a power calculation, with the phasor
representation of the voltage and current from Example 10.1

2. State whether the network inside the box is absorbing or delivering
average power.
3. State whether the network inside the box is absorbing or supplying

Solution

1. From Eq. 10.14,
S=12(100  15°)(4  +105°)=200  120°=−100+j173.21 VA.
Once we calculate the complex power, we can read off both the real and
reactive powers, because S=P+jQ. Thus
P=−100 W,Q=173.21 var.
2. The value of P is negative, so the network inside the box is delivering
average power to the terminals.
3. The value of Q is positive, so the network inside the box is absorbing
magnetizing vars at its terminals.
Alternate Forms for Complex
Power
Equations 10.13 and 10.14 have several useful variations. We use the rms
form of the equations throughout because voltages and currents are most
often given as rms values in power computations.
The first variation of Eq. 10.13 replaces the voltage with the product of the
current times the impedance. We can always represent the circuit inside the
box of Fig. 10.11 by an equivalent impedance, as shown in Fig. 10.13. Then,
Figure 10.13 The general
circuit of Fig. 10.11 replaced
with an equivalent impedance.

Vrms=ZIrms.
Replacing the rms voltage phasor in Eq. 10.13 yields
S=Z IrmsIrms*= | Irms |2 Z= | Irms |2(R + jX)=| Irms|2R+j |Irms|2X=P+jQ,
(10.15)
from which
P=|Irms|2R=12Im2R,(10.16)
Q=|Irms|2X=12Im2X.(10.17)
In Eqs. 10.15 and 10.17, X is the reactance of either the equivalent
inductance or the equivalent capacitance of the circuit. Remember that
reactance is positive for inductive circuits and negative for capacitive circuits.
A second variation of Eq. 10.13 replaces the current with the voltage divided
by the impedance:
S=Vrms(VrmsZ)*=|Vrms|2Z*=P+jQ.(10.18)
Note that if Z is a pure resistive element,
P=|Vrms|2R,(10.19)

and if Z is a pure reactive element,
Q=|Vrms|2X.(10.20)
In Eq. 10.20, X is positive for an inductor and negative for a capacitor.
Examples 10.6–10.8 demonstrate various power calculations in circuits
operating in the sinusoidal steady state.
Example 10.6 Calculating Average
and Reactive Power
In the circuit shown in Fig. 10.14, a load having an impedance of 39+j26 Ω is
fed from a voltage source through a line having an impedance of 1+j4 Ω. The
source voltage is 250 V(rms).

Example 10.6.

Figure 10.14 Full Alternative Text
1. Calculate the load current phasor IL and voltage phasor VL.
2. Calculate the average and reactive power delivered to the load.
3. Calculate the average and reactive power delivered to the line.
4. Calculate the average and reactive power supplied by the source.
Solution
1. The line and load impedances are in series across the voltage source, so
the load current equals the voltage divided by the total impedance, or
IL=250 0°40+j30=4−j3=5  −36.87° A (rms).
Because the voltage is given as an rms value, the current value is also

rms. The load voltage is the product of the load current and load
impedance:
VL=(39 + j26)IL=234−j13=234.36 −3.18° V (rms).
2. Use Eq. 10.13 to find the average and reactive power delivered to the
load. Therefore
S=VLIL*=(234−j13)(4+j3)=975 + j650 VA.
Thus, the load is absorbing an average power of 975 W and a reactive
power of 650 var.
3. Because the line current is known, the average and reactive power
delivered to the line are most easily calculated using Eqs. 10.16 and
10.17. Thus
P=(5)2(1)=25 W,Q=(5)2(4)=100 var.
Note that the reactive power associated with the line is positive because
the line reactance is inductive.
4. We can calculate the average and reactive power delivered by the source
by adding the complex power delivered to the line to that delivered to
the load, or
S=25+j100+975+j650=1000+j750 VA.
The complex power at the source can also be calculated from Eq. 10.13:
Ss=−250IL*.
The minus sign is inserted in Eq. 10.13 whenever the current reference
is in the direction of a voltage rise. Thus
Ss=−250(4+j3)=−(1000+j750) VA.
The minus sign implies that both average power and magnetizing
reactive power are being delivered by the source. This result agrees with

the previous calculation of S, as it must, because the source supplies all
the average and reactive power absorbed by the line and load.
Example 10.7 Calculating Power in
Parallel Loads
The two loads in the circuit shown in Fig. 10.15 can be described as follows:
Load 1 absorbs 8 kW at a leading power factor of 0.8. Load 2 absorbs 20
kVA at a lagging power factor of 0.6.

2. Determine the apparent power required to supply the loads, the

3. Given that the frequency of the source is 60 Hz, compute the value of
the capacitor that would correct the power factor to 1 if placed in
parallel with the two loads. Recalculate the values in (b) for the load
with the corrected power factor.
Solution
1. All voltage and current phasors in this problem are rms values. Note
from the circuit diagram in Fig. 10.15 that Is=I1 + I2. The total complex
power absorbed by the two loads is
S=(250)Is*=(250)(I1+I2)*=(250)I1*+(250)I2*=S1+S2.
We can sum the complex powers geometrically, using the power
triangles for each load, as shown in Fig. 10.16. By hypothesis,

triangle for load 1; (b) The
power triangle for load 2; (c)

S1=8000−j8000(.6)
(.8)=8000−j6000 VA,S2=20,000(.6)+j  20,000(.8)=12,000+j16,000 VA.
It follows that
S=20,000+j10,000 VA,
and
Is*=20,000+j10,000250=80+j40 A(rms).

Therefore
Is=80−j40=89.44 −26.57° A(rms).
Thus, the power factor of the combined load is
pf=cos(0+26.57°)=0.8944 lagging.
The power factor of the two loads in parallel is lagging because the net
reactive power is positive.
2. The apparent power supplied to the two loads is
|S|=|20,000+j10,000|=22.36 kVA.
The magnitude of the current supplying this apparent power is
|Is|=|80−j40|=89.44 A(rms).
The average power lost in the line results from the current in the line
resistance:
Pline=|Is|2R=(89.44)2(0.05)=400 W.
Note that the power supplied totals 20,000+400=20,400 W, even though
the loads require a total of only 20,000 W.
3. As we can see from the power triangle in Fig. 10.16(c), we can correct
the power factor to 1 if we place a capacitor in parallel with the existing
loads that supplies 10 kVAR of magnetizing reactive power. The value
of the capacitor is calculated as follows. First, find the capacitive
reactance from Eq. 10.20:
X=| Vrms |2Q=(250)2−10,000=−6.25 Ω.
Recall that the reactive impedance of a capacitor is −1/ωC, and
ω=2π(60)=376.99 rad/s, because the source frequency is 60 Hz. Thus,
C=−1ωX=−1(376.99)(−6.25)=424.4 μF.

Adding the capacitor as the third load is represented in geometric form
as the sum of the two power triangles shown in Fig. 10.17. When the
power factor is 1, the apparent power and the average power are the
same, as seen from the power triangle in Fig. 10.17(c). Therefore, once
the power factor has been corrected, the apparent power is
Figure 10.17 (a) The sum of
the power triangles for loads
1 and 2; (b) The power
triangle for a 424.4 μF
capacitor at 60 Hz; (c) The
sum of the power triangles in

|S|=P=20 kVA.
The magnitude of the current that supplies this apparent power is
|Is|=20,000250=80 A(rms).
The average power lost in the line is thus reduced to
P line=|Is|2R=(80)2(0.05)=320 W.
Now, the power supplied totals
20,000+320=20,320 W.
Note that the addition of the capacitor has reduced the line loss by 20%,
from 400 W to 320 W.

2. Calculate the average and reactive powers associated with each source in
the circuit.

3. Verify that the average power delivered equals the average power

Solution
1. The complex power delivered to the (1+j2) Ω impedance is
S1=12V1I1*=P1+jQ1=12(78−j104)
(−26+j52)=12(3380+j6760)=1690+j3380 VA.
Thus, this impedance is absorbing an average power of 1690 W and a
reactive power of 3380 VAR. The complex power delivered to the
(12−j16) Ω impedance is
S2=12V2I2*=P2+jQ2=12(72+j104)(−2−j6)=240−j320 VA.
Therefore, the impedance in the vertical branch is absorbing 240 W and
delivering 320 VAR. The complex power delivered to the (1+j3) Ω
impedance is
S3=12V3I3*=P3+jQ3=12(150−j130)(−24+j58)=1970+j5910 VA.
This impedance is absorbing 1970 W and 5910 VAR.
2. The complex power associated with the independent voltage source is
Ss=−12VsI1*=Ps+jQs=−12(150)(−26+j52)=1950−j3900 VA.
Note that the independent voltage source is absorbing an average power
of 1950 W and delivering 3900 VAR. The complex power associated
with the current-controlled voltage source is
Sx=12(39Ix)(I2*)=Px+jQx=12(−78+j234)(−24+j58)=−5850−j5070 VA.
Both average power and magnetizing reactive power are being delivered
by the dependent source.

3. The total power absorbed by the passive impedances and the
independent voltage source is
Pabsorbed=P1+P2+P3+Ps=5850 W.
The dependent voltage source is the only circuit element delivering
average power. Thus
Pdelivered=5850 W.
Magnetizing reactive power is being absorbed by the two horizontal
branches. Thus
Qabsorbed=Q1+Q3=9290 VAR.
Magnetizing reactive power is being delivered by the independent
voltage source, the capacitor in the vertical impedance branch, and the
dependent voltage source. Therefore
Qdelivered=9290 VAR.

10.6 Maximum Power Transfer
Recall from Chapter 4 that certain systems—for example, those that transmit
information via electric signals—need to transfer a maximum amount of
power from the source to the load. We now determine the condition for
maximum power transfer in sinusoidal steady-state networks, beginning with
Fig. 10.19. We must determine the load impedance ZL that maximizes the
average power delivered to terminals a and b. Any linear network can be
replaced by a Thévenin equivalent circuit, so we will use the circuit in Fig.
10.20 to find the value of ZL that results in maximum average power
delivered to ZL.
Figure 10.19 A circuit
describing maximum power
transfer.
Figure 10.19 Full Alternative Text

Figure 10.20 The circuit shown
in Fig. 10.19, with the network

Figure 10.20 Full Alternative Text
For maximum average power transfer, ZL must equal the conjugate of the
Thévenin impedance; that is,
Condition for Maximum Average
Power Transfer
ZL=ZTh*.(10.21)

We derive Eq. 10.21 by a straightforward application of elementary calculus.
We begin by expressing ZTh and ZL in rectangular form:
ZTh=RTh+jXTh,ZL=RL+jXL.
In these impedance equations, the reactance term carries its own algebraic
sign—positive for inductance and negative for capacitance. We assume that
the Thévenin voltage amplitude is an rms value. We also use the Thévenin
voltage as the reference phasor, that is, the phasor whose phase angle is 0°.
Then, from Fig. 10.20, the rms value of the load current I is
I=VTh(RTh+RL)+j(XTh+XL).
The average power delivered to the load is
P=|I|2RL.
Therefore,
P=|VTh|2RL(RTh+RL)2+(XTh+XL)2.(10.22)
In Eq. 10.22, remember that VTh, RTh, and XTh are fixed quantities,
whereas RL and XL are independent variables. Therefore, to maximize P, we
must find the values of RL and XL that make both ∂P/∂RL and ∂P/∂XL zero.
From Eq. 10.22,
∂P∂XL=−| VTh |22RL(XL + XTh)[(RL + RTh)2 + (XL + XTh)2]2,∂P∂RL=|
VTh |2[(RL + RTh)2 + (XL + XTh)2−2RL(RL + RTh)][(RL+RTh)2+
(XL+XTh)2]2.
From its equation, ∂P/∂XL is zero when
XL=−XTh.
From its equation, ∂P/∂RL is zero when
RL=RTh2 + (XL+XTh)2.

Note that when we combine the expressions for XL and RL, both partial
derivatives are zero when ZL=ZTh*.
The Maximum Average Power
Absorbed
When ZL=ZTh*, we can use the circuit in Fig. 10.20 to calculate the
maximum average power that is delivered to ZL. The rms load current is
VTh/2RL because ZL=ZTh*, and the maximum average power delivered to
the load is
Pmax=|VTh|2RL4RL2=14 |VTh|2RL.(10.23)
If the Thévenin voltage phasor is expressed using its maximum amplitude
rather than its rms amplitude, Eq. 10.23 becomes
Pmax=18 Vm2RL.(10.24)
Maximum Power Transfer When
ZL is Restricted
Maximum average power can be delivered to ZL only if ZL can be set equal
to the conjugate of ZTh. In some situations, this is not possible. First, RL and
XL may be restricted to a limited range of values. To maximize power in this
situation, set XL as close to −XTh as possible and then adjust RL as close to
RTh2+(XL+XTh)2 as possible (see Example 10.10).
A second type of restriction occurs when the magnitude of ZL can be varied,
but its phase angle cannot. Under this restriction, maximum power is
delivered to the load when the magnitude of ZL is set equal to the magnitude
of ZTh; that is, when
|ZL|=|ZTh|.

The proof of this is left to you as Problem 10.45.
For purely resistive networks, maximum power transfer occurs when the load
resistance equals the Thévenin resistance. Note that we first derived this
result in the introduction to maximum power transfer in Chapter 4.
Examples 10.9–10.11 calculate the load impedance ZL that produces
maximum average power transfer to the load, for several different situations.
Example 10.12 finds the condition for maximum power transfer to a load for
a circuit with an ideal transformer.

Solution
1. To begin, determine the Thévenin equivalent with respect to the load

shown in Fig. 10.21 to the one shown in Fig. 10.22. Use voltage division

Figure 10.22 Full Alternative Text
VTh=−j6 4+j3−j6(160°)=19.2  −53.13°=11.52−j15.36 V.
To find the Thévenin impedance, deactivate the source in Fig. 10.22 and
calculate the impedance seen looking into the terminals a and b. Thus,
ZTh=−j6||(4+j3)=(−j6)(4+j3)4+j3−j6=5.76−j1.68 Ω.
For maximum average power transfer, the load impedance must be the
conjugate of ZTh, so
ZL=5.76+j1.68 Ω.
2. We calculate the maximum average power delivered to ZL using the
circuit in Fig. 10.23, which has the Thévenin equivalent of the original
network attached to the load impedance calculated in part (a). From Fig.

2. Assume that the load resistance can be varied between 0 and 4000 Ω and
that the capacitive reactance of the load can be varied between 0 and
−2000 Ω. What settings of RL and XL transfer the most average power
to the load? What is the maximum average power that can be transferred
under these restrictions?
Solution

1. If there are no restrictions on RL and XL, maximum average power is
delivered to the load if the load impedance equals the conjugate of the
Thévenin impedance. Therefore we set
RL=3000 Ω  and  XL=−4000 Ω,
or
ZL=3000−j4000 Ω.
Because the source voltage is an rms value, the average power delivered
to ZL is
P=14 1023000=253 mW=8.33 mW.
2. Now RL and XL are restricted, so first we set XL as close to −4000 Ω as
possible; thus, XL=−2000 Ω. Next, we set RL as close to RTh2+
(XL+XTh)2 as possible. Thus
RL=30002+(−2000+4000)2=3605.55 Ω.
Since RL can be varied from 0 to 4000 Ω, we can set RL to 3605.55 Ω.
Therefore, the load impedance value is
ZL=3605.55−j2000 Ω.
For this value of ZL, the value of the load current is
Irms=10  0°6605.55+j2000=1.4489  −16.85° mA(rms).
The average power delivered to the load is
P=(1.4489×10−3)2(3605.55)=7.57 mW.
This is the maximum power delivered to a load with the specified
restrictions on RL and XL. Note that this is less than the 8.33 mW that
can be delivered if there are no restrictions, as we found in part (a).

Example 10.11 Finding Maximum
Power Transfer with Impedance
Angle Restrictions
A load impedance having a constant phase angle of −36.87° is connected
across the terminals a and b in the circuit shown in Fig. 10.24. The magnitude
of ZL is varied until the average power delivered is maximized under the
given restriction.
1. Specify ZL in rectangular form.
2. Calculate the average power delivered to ZL.
Solution
1. When only the magnitude of ZL can be varied, maximum power is
delivered to the load when the magnitude of ZL equals the magnitude of
ZTh. So,
|ZL|=|ZTh|=|3000+j4000|=5000 Ω.
Therefore,
ZL=5000  −36.87°=4000−j3000 Ω.
2. When ZL equals 4000−j3000 Ω, the load current is
Irms=107000+j1000=1.4142  −8.13° mA(rms),
and the average power delivered to the load is
P=(1.4142×10−3)2(4000)=8 mW.
This quantity is the maximum power that can be delivered by this circuit

to a load impedance whose angle is constant at −36.87°. Again, this
quantity is less than the maximum power that can be delivered if there
are no restrictions on ZL.

The ideal transformer imposes the following constraints on the variables
V1, V2, I1, and I2:
V2=14V1,  I1=−14I2.
The open-circuit value of I2 is zero; hence, I1 is zero. It follows that
V1=840  0° V(rms),  V2=210  0° V(rms).

From Fig. 10.26 we note that VTh is the negative of V2, because there is
no current in the 20  Ω resistor. Hence
VTh=−210  0° V(rms).
We determine the short-circuit current using the circuit in Fig. 10.27.

Practical Perspective
Vampire Power
Vampire power, or standby power, may cost you more than you think. The
average household has about 40 electrical products that draw power, even
when they are turned off. Approximately 5% of typical residential power
consumption can be attributed to standby power. Table 10.3 provides the
power consumption for several different devices. Notice that when a device is
“off” it is often still consuming power.
Table 10.3 Average power
consumption of common
electrical devices

Table 10.3 Full Alternative Text
*Data in this table from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory report (http:/
/standby.lbl.gov/standby.html).

+This value is the average of the power measured for many types of each
device.
Consider a typical mobile phone charger. According to the values given in
Table 10.3, when the charger is detached from the phone it consumes only a
fraction of the power required when the charger is attached to the phone and
the phone is charging. Suppose you charge your phone for three hours each
day but leave the charger plugged into the wall outlet 24 hours a day. Recall
that the electric company charges you based on the number of kilowatt-hours
(kWh) you use in a given month. A device that uses 1000 W of power
continuously over one hour has consumed 1 kWh. Let’s calculate the number
of kilowatt-hours used by the phone charger in one month:
P[kWh]=30[3(3.68)+21(0.26)]1000=1.8 kWh
Now do the calculation again, this time assuming that you unplug the charger
when it is not being used to charge the phone:
P[kWh]=30[3(3.68)+21(0)]1000=0.33 kWh
Keeping the charger plugged in when you are not using it consumes more
than 5 times the power needed to charge your phone every day. You can
therefore minimize the cost of vampire power by unplugging electrical
devices if they are not being used.
Why does the phone charger consume power when not plugged into the
phone? The electronic circuitry in your phone uses 5 V(dc) sources to supply
power. The phone charger must transform the 120 V(rms) signal supplied by
the wall outlet into a signal that can be used to charge the phone. Phone
chargers can use linear transformers, together with other circuitry, to output
the voltage needed by the phone.
Consider the circuit in Fig. 10.29. The linear transformer is part of the
circuitry used to reduce the voltage supplied by the source to the level
required by the phone. The additional components needed to complete this
task are not shown in the circuit. When the phone is unplugged from the
circuit in Fig. 10.29, but the circuit is still connected to the 120 V(rms)
source, there is still a path for the current, as shown in Fig. 10.30. The current

is

The real power, delivered by the voltage source and supplied to the resistors,
is
P=(Rs+R1)|I|2.
This is the vampire power being consumed by the phone charger even when
it is not connected to the phone.

Summary
Instantaneous power is the product of the instantaneous terminal
voltage and current, or p=±vi. The positive sign is used when the
reference direction for the current is from the positive to the negative
reference polarity of the voltage. The frequency of the instantaneous
power is twice the frequency of the voltage (or current). (See page 376.)
Average power is the average value of the instantaneous power over
one period. It is the power converted from electric to nonelectric form
and vice versa, so it is also called real power. Average power is given by
P=12VmIm cos(θv−θi)
=VrmsIrms cos(θv−θi).
(See page 377.)
Reactive power is the electric power exchanged between the magnetic
field of an inductor and the source that drives it or between the electric
field of a capacitor and the source that drives it. Reactive power is never
converted to nonelectric power. Reactive power is given by
Q=12VmIm sin(θv − θi)
=VrmsIrms sin(θv−θi).
Both average power and reactive power can be expressed in terms of
either peak (Vm, Im) or rms (Vrms,Irms) current and voltage. RMS
values, also called effective values, are widely used in both household
and industrial applications. (See page 378.)
The power factor is the cosine of the phase angle between the voltage
and the current:
pf=cos(θv−θi).
The terms lagging and leading, added to the description of the power

factor, indicate whether the current is lagging or leading the voltage and
thus whether the load is inductive or capacitive. (See page 379.)
The reactive factor is the sine of the phase angle between the voltage
and the current:
rf=sin(θv−θi).
(See page 379.)
Complex power is the complex sum of the real and reactive powers, or
S = P+j Q = 1 2  V I * = V rms I rms * 2 = | I rms | 2 Z= | V rms | 2 Z * .
(See page 384.)
Apparent power is the magnitude of the complex power:
|S|=P2+Q2.
(See page 385.)
The watt is used as the unit for both instantaneous and real power. The
var (volt amp reactive, or VAR) is used as the unit for reactive power.
The volt-amp (VA) is used as the unit for complex and apparent power.
(See page 385.)
Maximum power transfer occurs in circuits operating in the sinusoidal
steady state when the load impedance is the conjugate of the Thévenin
impedance as viewed from the terminals of the load impedance. (See
page 393.)

circuit.
2. Know how to analyze a balanced, three-phase wye-delta connected
circuit.
3. Be able to calculate power (average, reactive, and complex) in any
three-phase circuit.
We use three-phase circuits to generate, transmit, distribute, and consume
large blocks of electric power. The comprehensive analysis of such systems
is a field of study in its own right; we cannot cover it in a single chapter.
Fortunately, an understanding of the steady-state sinusoidal behavior of
balanced three-phase circuits is sufficient for engineers who do not specialize
in power systems. We analyze balanced three-phase circuits using several
shortcuts based on circuit-analysis techniques discussed in earlier chapters.
The basic structure of a three-phase system consists of voltage sources
connected to loads by means of transformers and transmission lines. To
analyze such a circuit, we can reduce it to a voltage source connected to a
load via a line. The omission of the transformer simplifies the discussion
without jeopardizing a basic understanding of the three-phase system. Figure
11.1 on page 414 shows a basic circuit. A defining characteristic of a
balanced three-phase circuit is that it contains a set of balanced three-phase
voltages at its source. We begin by considering these voltages, and then we
move to the voltage and current relationships for the Y-Y and Y-Δ circuits.
After considering voltage and current in such circuits, we conclude with
sections on power and power measurement.

Practical Perspective
Transmission and Distribution of
Electric Power
In this chapter, we introduce circuits that are designed to handle large blocks
of electric power. These are the circuits used to transport electric power from
generating plants to both industrial and residential customers. We introduced
a very basic residential customer circuit in the design perspective for Chapter
1. Now we introduce the type of circuit that delivers electric power to an
entire residential subdivision.
One of the requirements imposed on electric utilities is to maintain the rms
voltage level at the customer’s premises. Whether lightly loaded, as at 3:00
a.m., or heavily loaded, as at midafternoon on a hot, humid day, the utility
must supply the same rms voltage. To satisfy this requirement, utility systems

place capacitors at strategic locations in the distribution network. The
capacitors supply magnetizing vars close to the loads requiring them,
adjusting the power factor of the load. We illustrate this concept after we
have analyzed balanced three-phase circuits.

11.1 Balanced Three-Phase Voltages
A set of balanced three-phase voltages consists of three sinusoidal voltages
that have identical amplitudes and frequencies but are out of phase with each
other by exactly 120°. We refer to the three phases as a, b, and c, and use the
a-phase as the reference phase. The three voltages are referred to as the a-
phase voltage, the b-phase voltage, and the c-phase voltage.
Only two possible phase relationships can exist between the a-phase voltage
and the b- and c-phase voltages. One possibility is for the b-phase voltage to
lag the a-phase voltage by 120°, in which case the c-phase voltage must lead
the a-phase voltage by 120°. This phase relationship is known as the abc (or
positive) phase sequence. Using phasor notation, we see that the abc phase
sequence is
V a = V m   0° , V b = V m   −120° , V c = V m   +120° . (11.1)
The only other possibility is for the b-phase voltage to lead the a-phase
voltage by 120°, in which case the c-phase voltage must lag the a-phase
voltage by 120°. This phase relationship is known as the acb (or negative)
phase sequence. In phasor notation, the acb phase sequence is
V a = V m   0° , V b = V m    +120° , V c = V m    −120° . (11.2)
Figure 11.2 shows the phasor diagrams of the voltages in Eqs. 11.1 and 11.2.
The phase sequence is the clockwise order of the subscripts around the
diagram, starting from Va. You can use the phasor diagrams to show that the
sum of the three phasor voltages in a balanced set is zero. This important
characteristic can also be derived from Eq. 11.1 or 11.2 to give

a balanced set of three-phase

voltages. (a) The abc (positive)
sequence. (b) The acb
(negative) sequence.

Va + Vb + Vc=0.
Because the sum of the phasor voltages is zero, the sum of the instantaneous
voltages also is zero; that is,
va + vb + vc=0.
Now that we know the nature of a balanced set of three-phase voltages, we
can state the first of the analytical shortcuts alluded to in the introduction to
this chapter: if we know the phase sequence and one voltage in the set, we
know the entire set. Thus, for a balanced three-phase system, once we
determine the voltages (or currents) in one phase, we can use the 120° phase
angle difference and the phase sequence to find the voltages or currents in the
remaining two phases.

11.2 Three-Phase Voltage Sources
A three-phase voltage source is a generator with three separate windings
distributed around the periphery of the stator. Each winding comprises one
phase of the generator. The rotor of the generator is an electromagnet driven
at synchronous speed by a prime mover, such as a steam or gas turbine.
Rotation of the electromagnet induces a sinusoidal voltage in each winding.
The phase windings are designed so that the sinusoidal voltages induced in
them are equal in amplitude and out of phase with each other by 120°. The
phase windings are stationary with respect to the rotating electromagnet, so
the frequency of the voltage induced in each winding is the same. Figure 11.3
shows a sketch of a two-pole three-phase source.
Figure 11.3 A sketch of a three-
phase voltage source.

There are two ways of interconnecting the separate phase windings to form a
three-phase source: as a wye (Y) or as a delta (Δ). Figure 11.4 shows both,
with ideal voltage sources modeling the phase windings of the three-phase
generator. The common terminal in the Y-connected source, labeled n in Fig.
11.4(a), is called the neutral terminal of the source, which may or may not
be available for external connections.

When constructing a circuit model of a three-phase generator, we need to
consider the impedance of each phase winding. Sometimes it is so small
(compared with other impedances in the circuit) that we don’t include it in
the generator model; the model then consists solely of ideal voltage sources,
as in Fig. 11.4. If the impedance of each phase winding is not negligible, we
connect an inductive winding impedance in series with an ideal sinusoidal
voltage source in each phase. Because the winding construction in each phase
is the same, we make the winding impedances in each phase identical. Figure
11.5 shows two models of a three-phase generator, one using a Y connection
and the other using a Δ connection. In both models, Rw is the winding
resistance, and Xw is the inductive reactance of the winding.

Because both three-phase sources and three-phase loads can be either Y-
connected or Δ-connected, the basic circuit in Fig. 11.1 represents four
different configurations:

We begin by analyzing the Y-Y circuit. The remaining three configurations
can be reduced to a Y-Y equivalent circuit, so analysis of the Y-Y circuit is
the key to solving all balanced three-phase arrangements. We then illustrate
how to transform a Y-Δ circuit to a Y-Y circuit and leave the analysis of the
Δ-Y and Δ-Δ circuits to you in the Problems.

11.3 Analysis of the Wye-Wye
Circuit
Figure 11.6 illustrates a general Y-Y circuit, in which we included a fourth
conductor that connects the source neutral to the load neutral. A fourth
conductor is possible only in the Y-Y arrangement. For convenience, we
transformed the Y connections into “tipped-over tees.” In Fig. 11.6, Zga, Zgb,
and Zgc represent the internal impedance associated with each phase winding
of the voltage generator; Zl1, Zlb and Zlc represent the impedance of the
lines connecting a phase of the source to a phase of the load; Z0 is the
impedance of the neutral conductor connecting the source neutral to the load
neutral; and ZA, ZB, and ZC represent the impedance of each phase of the
load.

We can describe this circuit with a single KCL equation. Using the source
neutral as the reference node and letting VN denote the node voltage between
the nodes N and n, we get
VNZ0 + VN−Va′nZA + Zla + Zga + VN−Vb′nZB + Zlb + Zgb + VN−Vc

′nZC + Zlc + Zgc=0.
What happens to the KCL equation if the three-phase circuit in Fig. 11.6 is
balanced? To answer this question, we must formally define a balanced three-
phase circuit. A three-phase circuit is balanced if it satisfies the following
criteria:
Conditions for a Balanced Three-
Phase Circuit
1. The voltage sources form a balanced three-phase set.
2. The impedance of each phase of the voltage source is the same.
3. The impedance of each line is the same.
4. The impedance of each phase of the load is the same.
There is no restriction on the impedance of the neutral conductor; its value
has no effect on whether the system is balanced.
The circuit in Fig. 11.6 is balanced if
1. Va′n, Vb′n, and Vc′n are a set of balanced three-phase voltages.
2. Zga=Zgb=Zgc.
3. Zla=Zlb=Zlc.
4. ZA=ZB=ZC.
If the circuit in Fig. 11.6 is balanced, we can rewrite the KCL equation at VN
as
VN(1Z0 + 3Zϕ)=Va′n + Vb′n + Vc′nZϕ,(11.3)

where
Zφ=ZA+Zla+Zga=ZB+Zlb+Zgb=ZC+Zlc+Zgc.
The right-hand side of Eq. 11.3 is zero because by hypothesis the numerator
is a set of balanced three-phase voltages and Zϕ is not zero. The only value of
VN that satisfies Eq. 11.3 is zero. Therefore, for a balanced three-phase
circuit,
VN=0.(11.4)
When a three-phase circuit is balanced, VN is zero, so the voltage between
the source neutral, n, and the load neutral, N, is zero. Consequently, the
current in the neutral conductor is zero, so we can either remove the neutral
conductor from a balanced Y-Y configuration (I0=0) or replace it with a short
circuit between the nodes n and N (VN=0). Both equivalents are convenient
to use when modeling balanced three-phase circuits.
If the three-phase circuit in Fig. 11.6 is balanced, the three line currents are
IaA=Va'n-VNZA+Zla+Zga=Va'nZϕ,IbB=Vb'n-
VNZB+Zlb+Zgb=Vb'nZϕ,IcC=Vc'n-VNZC+Zlc+Zgc=Vc'nZϕ. (11.5)
From these equations, we see that the three line currents form a balanced set;
that is, the current in each line is equal in amplitude and frequency and is
120° out of phase with the other two line currents. Thus, if we calculate the
current IaA and we know the phase sequence, we have a shortcut for finding
IbB and IcC. This is the same shortcut used to find the b- and c-phase source
voltages from the a-phase source voltage.
Terminology
We use Fig. 11.6 to define some important terms.
Line voltage is the voltage across any pair of lines. In Fig. 11.6, the
three line voltages at the load are VAB, VBC, and VCA.

Phase voltage is the voltage across a single phase. In Fig. 11.6, the three
phase voltages at the load are VAN, VBN, and VCN.
Line current is the current in a single line. In Fig. 11.6, the three line
currents are IaA, IbB, and IcC.
Phase current is the current in a single phase. In Fig. 11.6, the three
phase currents for the load are IAN, IBN, and ICN.
From Fig. 11.6 you can see that when the load is Y-connected; the line
current and phase current in each phase are identical, but the line voltage and
phase voltage in each phase are different.
The Greek letter phi (ϕ) is widely used in the literature to denote a per-phase
quantity. Thus, Vϕ, Iϕ, Zϕ, Pϕ, and Qϕ are interpreted as voltage-per-phase,
current-per-phase, impedance-per-phase, real power-per-phase, and reactive
power-per-phase, respectively.
Since three-phase systems are designed to handle large blocks of electric
power, all voltage and current specifications are rms values. When voltage
ratings are given, they refer specifically to the rating of the line voltage. Thus,
when a three-phase transmission line is rated at 345 kV, the value of the line-
to-line voltage is 345,000 V(rms). In this chapter, we express all voltages and
currents as rms values.
Constructing a Single-Phase
Equivalent Circuit
We can use Eq. 11.5 to construct an equivalent circuit for the a-phase of the
balanced Y-Y circuit. From this equation, the line current in the a-phase is the
voltage generated in the a-phase winding of the generator divided by the total
impedance in the a-phase of the circuit. Thus, Eq. 11.5 describes the circuit
shown in Fig. 11.7, in which the neutral conductor has been replaced by a
short circuit. The circuit in Fig. 11.7 is the single-phase equivalent circuit
for a balanced three-phase circuit. Once we solve this circuit, we can write

down the voltages and currents in the other two phases, using the
relationships among the phases. Thus, drawing a single-phase equivalent
circuit is an important first step in analyzing a balanced three-phase circuit.
Figure 11.7 A single-phase
equivalent circuit.
Figure 11.7 Full Alternative Text
Note that the current in the neutral conductor in Fig. 11.7 is IaA. This is not
the same as the current in the neutral conductor of the balanced three-phase
circuit, which is
Io=IaA + IbB + IcC.
Thus, the circuit shown in Fig. 11.7 gives the correct value of the line current
but only the a-phase component of the neutral current. In a balanced three-
phase circuit, the line currents form a balanced three-phase set, and Io=0.
Once we know the line current (IaA) in Fig. 11.7, we know the phase current

(IAN) because they are equal. We can also use Ohm’s law to calculate the
phase voltage (VAN) from the phase current and the load impedance. But
how do we calculate the line voltage, VAB? The line voltage is not even
shown in the single-phase equivalent circuit in Fig. 11.7. In a Y-connected
load, the line voltages and the phase voltages are related. Using Fig. 11.8, we
can describe those relationships using KVL:
Figure 11.8 Line-to-line and
line-to-neutral voltages.
Figure 11.8 Full Alternative Text

V AB = V AN − V BN , V BC = V BN − V CN , V CA = V CN − V AN .
To derive the relationship between the line voltages and the phase voltages,
we assume a positive, or abc, sequence. Using the phase voltage in the a-
phase as the reference,
V AN = V ϕ   0° , V BN = V ϕ  −120° , V CN = V ϕ    +120° ,
where Vϕ represents the magnitude of the phase voltage. Substituting the
phase voltages into the equations for the line voltages yields
VAB=Vϕ  0°  − Vϕ  −120° =3Vϕ 30° ,(11.6)
VBC=Vϕ  −120°  − Vϕ  120° =3Vϕ −90° , (11.7)
VCA=Vϕ  120°  − Vϕ  0° =3Vϕ 150° . (11.8)
Equations 11.6–11.8 reveal that
1. The magnitude of the line voltage is 3 times the magnitude of the phase
voltage.
2. The line voltages form a balanced three-phase set.
3. The set of line voltages leads the set of phase voltages by 30°
We leave it to you to demonstrate that for a negative sequence, the only
change is that the set of line voltages lags the set of phase voltages by 30°.
The phasor diagrams shown in Fig. 11.9 summarize these observations. Here,
again, is a shortcut in the analysis of a balanced system: If you know any
phase voltage in the circuit, say VBN, you can determine the corresponding
line voltage, which is VBC, and vice versa.

2. The a-phase line current is the voltage in the a-phase divided by the total
impedance in the a-phase:
I aA = 120  0° (0.2 + 0.8 + 39) + j(0.5 + 1.5 + 28) = 120  0° 40 + j30 =
2.4  −36.87°  A.

For a positive phase sequence,
I bB = 2.4 −156.87°  A, I cC = 2.4 83.13°  A.
3. The line current and the phase current in the a-phase are equal. The
phase voltage across the load in the a-phase is the product of the single-
phase impedance of the load and the phase current in the load:
V AN = (39 + j28)(2.4 −36.87°) = 115.22 −1.19° V.
For a positive phase sequence,
VBN=115.22  −121.19°  V,
VCN=115.22  118.81°  V.
4. For a positive phase sequence, the magnitude of the line voltages is 3
times the magnitude of the phase voltages, and the line voltages lead the
phase voltages by 30°. Thus
V AB = ( 3   30° ) V AN = 199.58   28.81°  V, V BC = 199.58  −91.19°
 V, V CA = 199.58  148.81°  V.
5. The phase voltage of the source in the a-phase is the voltage of the ideal
source minus the voltage across the source impedance. Therefore,
V an = 120 − (0.2 + j0.5)(2.4  −36.87° ) = 120 − 1.29  31.33° = 118.90 
− j0.67 = 118.90  −0.32°  V.
For a positive phase sequence,
V bn = 118.90  −120.32° V, V cn = 118.90  119.68° V.
6. The line voltages at the source terminals are
V ab = ( 3   30° ) V an = 205.94   29.68°  V, V bc = 205.94  −90.32°  V,
V ca = 205.94  149.68°  V.
7. Changing the phase sequence has no effect on the single-phase
equivalent circuit. The three line currents are

I aA = 2.4  −36.87°  A, I bB = 2.4  83.13°  A, I cC = 2.4  −156.87°  A.
The phase voltages at the load are
V AN = 115.22   −1.19°  V, V BN = 115.22   118.81°  V, V CN =
115.22   −121.19°  V.
For a negative phase sequence, the line voltages lag the phase voltages
by 30°:
V AB = ( 3   30° ) V AN = 199.58  −31.19°  V, V BC = 199.58  88.81°
 V, V CA = 199.58  −151.19°  V.
The phase voltages at the terminals of the generator are
V an = 118.90   −0.32°  V, V bn = 118.90 119.68°  V, V cn = 118.90 
−120.32°  V.
The line voltages at the terminals of the generator are
V ab = ( 3   −30° ) V an = 205.94  −30.32°  V, V bc = 205.94  89.68°  V,
V ca = 205.94  −150.32°  V.

11.4 Analysis of the Wye-Delta
Circuit
A balanced, three-phase, Y-Δ circuit is shown in Fig. 11.11. From this circuit
you can see that the line voltage and the phase voltage in each phase of the
load are the same. For example, VAN=VAB. But the line current and the
phase current in each phase of the load are not the same. This is an important
difference when comparing the Y-Δ circuit with the Y-Y circuit, where the
line and phase currents are the same in each phase of the load but the line and
phase voltages are different.
Figure 11.11 A balanced three-
phase Y-Δ system.

Figure 11.11 Full Alternative Text
When the load in a three-phase circuit is connected in a delta, it can be
transformed into a wye by using the delta-to-wye transformation discussed in
Section 9.6. When the load is balanced, the impedance of each leg of the wye
is one-third the impedance of each leg of the delta, or

Relationship between Delta-
Connected and Wye-Connected

ZY=ZΔ3, (11.9)
which follows directly from Eqs. 9.21–9.23. After the Δ load has been
replaced by its Y equivalent, the a-phase can be modeled by the single-phase
equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 11.12.
Figure 11.12 A single-phase
equivalent circuit.
Figure 11.12 Full Alternative Text
We use this circuit to calculate the line currents, and we then use the line
currents to find the currents in each phase of the original Δ-connected load.

The relationship between the line currents and the phase currents in each
phase of the delta can be derived using the circuit shown in Fig. 11.11. We
assume a positive phase sequence and let Iϕ represent the magnitude of the
phase current. Then
I AB = I ϕ    0° , I BC = I ϕ   −120° , I CA = I ϕ   120° .
In writing these equations, we arbitrarily selected IAB as the reference
phasor.
We can write the line currents in terms of the phase currents by applying
KCL at the nodes labeled A, B, and C in Fig. 11.11:
I aA = I AB  −  I CA = I ϕ    0°  −  I ϕ    120° = 3 I ϕ   −30° , (11.10)
I bB = I BC  −  I AB = I ϕ   −120°  −  I ϕ   0° = 3 I ϕ   −150° , (11.11)
I cC = I CA  −  I BC = I ϕ   120°  −  I ϕ   −120° = 3 I ϕ  90° . (11.12)
Comparing the line currents and the phase currents reveals that the magnitude
of the line currents is 3 times the magnitude of the phase currents and that the
set of line currents lags the set of phase currents by 30°.
We leave it to you to verify that, for a negative phase sequence, the line
currents are still 3 times larger than the phase currents, but they lead the
phase currents by 30°. Thus, we have a shortcut for calculating line currents
from phase currents (or vice versa) for a balanced three-phase Δ-connected
load. Figure 11.13 summarizes this shortcut graphically. Example 11.2
analyzes a balanced three-phase circuit having a Y-connected source and a Δ-
connected load, using a single-phase equivalent circuit.

Delta Circuit
The Y-connected source in Example 11.1 feeds a Δ-connected load through a

2. Calculate the line currents IaA, IbB, and IcC.
3. Calculate the phase voltages at the load terminals.
4. Calculate the phase currents of the load.
5. Calculate the line voltages at the source terminals.

Example 11.2.

Figure 11.14 Full Alternative Text
118.5 + j85.83=39.5 + j28.6 Ω/ϕ.
2. The a-phase line current is the source voltage in the a-phase divided by
the sum of the impedances in the a-phase:
I aA = 120  0° (0.2 + 0.3 + 39.5) + j(0.5 + 0.9 + 28.6) = 120  0° 40 + j30
=2.4  −36.87°  A.
Hence
I bB = 2.4  −156.87°  A, I cC = 2.4  83.13°  A.
3. Because the load is Δ connected, the phase voltages are the same as the
line voltages. To calculate the line voltages, we first calculate VAN
using the single-phase equivalent circuit in Fig. 11.14:

V AN = (39.5 + j28.6)(2.4  −36.87° ) = 117.04  −0.96°  V.
Because the phase sequence is positive, the line voltage VAB is
V AB = ( 3   30° )  V AN = 202.72  29.04°  V.
Therefore
V BC = 202.72  −90.96°  V, V CA = 202.72  149.04°  V.
4. The phase currents of the load can be calculated directly from the line
currents:
I AB = ( 1 3   30° )  I aA = 1.39  −6.87°  A.
Once we know IAB, we also know the other load phase currents:
I BC = 1.39  −126.87°  A, I CA = 1.39  113.13°  A.
Note that we can check the calculation of IAB by using the previously
calculated VAB and the impedance of the Δ-connected load; that is,
I AB = V AB Z ϕ = 202.72  29.04° 118.5 + j85.8 = 1.39   −6.87°  A.
5. To calculate the line voltage at the terminals of the source, we first
calculate Van. Figure 11.14 shows that Van is the voltage drop across
the line impedance plus the load impedance, so
V an = (39.8 + j29.5)(2.4  −36.87° ) = 118.90  −0.32°  V.
The line voltage Vab is
V ab = ( 3   30° ) V an , = 205.94  29.68°  V.
Therefore
V bc = 205.94  −90.32°  V, V ca = 205.94  149.68°  V.

11.5 Power Calculations in Balanced
Three-Phase Circuits
So far, we have analyzed balanced three-phase circuits using a single-phase
equivalent circuit to determine line currents, phase currents, line voltages,
and phase voltages. We now calculate power for balanced three-phase
circuits. We begin by considering the average power delivered to a balanced
Y-connected load.
Average Power in a Balanced Wye
Load
Figure 11.15 shows a Y-connected load, along with its pertinent currents and
voltages. We calculate the average power associated with any one phase by
using the techniques introduced in Chapter 10. Using Eq. 10.9, we express
the average power associated with the a-phase as
Figure 11.15 A balanced Y load
used to introduce average
power calculations in three-
phase circuits.

Figure 11.15 Full Alternative Text
PA=|VAN||IaA|cos (θvA−θiA), (11.13)
where θvA and θiA denote the phase angles of VAN and IaA, respectively.
Using the notation introduced in Eq. 11.13, we can find the power associated
with the b- and c-phases:
PB=|VBN||IbB| cos (θvB−θiB), (11.14)
PC=|VCN||IcC| cos (θvC−θiC). (11.15)
In Eqs. 11.13–11.15, all phasor currents and voltages use the rms value of the
sinusoidal function they represent.

In a balanced three-phase system, the magnitude of each line-to-neutral
voltage is the same, as is the magnitude of each phase current. The argument
of the cosine functions is also the same for all three phases. We introduce the
following notation to take advantage of these observations:
V ϕ = | V AN |=| V BN |=| V CN |, I ϕ = | I aA |=| I bB |=| I cC |,
and
θϕ=θvA − θiA=θvB − θiB=θvC − θiC.
Moreover, for a balanced system, the power delivered to each phase of the
load is the same, so
PA=PB=PC=Pϕ=VϕIϕcosθϕ,
where Pϕ represents the average power per phase. The total average power
delivered to the balanced Y-connected load is simply three times the power
per phase, or
PT=3Pϕ=3VϕIϕcosθϕ. (11.16)
Expressing the total power in terms of the rms magnitudes of the line voltage
and current is also desirable. If we let VL and IL represent the rms
magnitudes of the line voltage and current, respectively, we can modify Eq.
11.16 as follows:
Total Real Power in a Balanced
Three-Phase Load
PT=3(VL3)ILcos θϕ=3VLIL cos θϕ.(11.17)
In deriving Eq. 11.17, we recognized that, for a balanced Y-connected load,
the magnitude of the phase voltage is the magnitude of the line voltage
divided by 3, and that the magnitude of the line current is equal to the
magnitude of the phase current. When using Eq. 11.17 to calculate the total

power delivered to the load, remember that θϕ is the phase angle between the
phase voltage and current.
Reactive and Complex Power in a
Balanced Wye Load
We can also calculate the reactive power and complex power associated with
any phase of a Y-connected load using the techniques introduced in Chapter
10. For a balanced load, the expressions for the reactive power are
Qϕ=VϕIϕ sinθϕ,
Total Reactive Power in a Balanced
Three-Phase Load
QT=3Qϕ=3VLIL sinθϕ.(11.18)
Use Eq. 10.13 to express the complex power of any phase. For a balanced Y-
connected load,
Sϕ=VANIaA*=VBNIbB*=VCNIcC*=VϕIϕ*,
where Vϕ and Iϕ represent a phase voltage and current for the same phase.
Thus, in general,
Sϕ=Pϕ + jQϕ=VϕIϕ*,
Total Complex Power in a Balanced
Three-Phase Load

ST=3Sϕ=3VLILθϕ°. (11.19)
Power Calculations in a Balanced
Delta Load
If the load is Δ-connected, the calculation of power—reactive or complex—is
basically the same as that for a Y-connected load. Figure 11.16 shows a Δ-
connected load, along with its pertinent currents and voltages. The power
associated with each phase is
Figure 11.16 A Δ-connected
load used to discuss power
calculations.

Figure 11.16 Full Alternative Text
P A = | V AB || I AB |cos ( θ vAB  −  θ iAB ), P B = | V BC || I BC | cos ( θ
vBC  −  θ iBC ), P C = | V CA || I CA | cos ( θ vCA  −  θ iCA ).
For a balanced load,
| V AB | = | V BC |=| V CA |= V ϕ , | I AB | = | I BC |=| I CA |= I ϕ , θ vAB −
θ iAB = θ vBC − θ iBC = θ vCA − θ iCA = θ ϕ ,
and
PA=PB=PC=Pϕ=VϕIϕcosθϕ.

Thus, whether you have a balanced Y- or Δ-connected load, the average
power per phase is equal to the product of the rms magnitude of the phase
voltage, the rms magnitude of the phase current, and the cosine of the angle
between the phase voltage and current.
The total average power delivered to a balanced Δ-connected load is
PT=3Pϕ=3VϕIϕcosθϕ=3VL(IL3) cos θϕ=3VLILcos θϕ.
Note that this equation is the same as Eq. 11.17. The expressions for reactive
power and complex power also are the same as those developed for the Y
load:
Q ϕ = V ϕ I ϕ  sin θ ϕ ; Q T = 3 Q ϕ =3 V ϕ I ϕ  sin θ ϕ ; S ϕ = P ϕ  + j Q ϕ =
V ϕ I ϕ * ; S T = 3 S ϕ = 3 V L I L   θ ϕ .
Instantaneous Power in Three-
Phase Circuits
Although we are primarily interested in average, reactive, and complex power
calculations, computing the total instantaneous power is also important. In a
balanced three-phase circuit, this power has an interesting property: it is
invariant with time! Thus, the torque developed at the shaft of a three-phase
motor is constant, which in turn means less vibration in machinery powered
by three-phase motors.
Let the instantaneous line-to-neutral voltage vAN be the reference, and, as
before, θϕ is the phase angle θvA−θiA. Then, for a positive phase sequence,
the instantaneous power in each phase is
p A = v AN i aA = V m I m cosωt cos (ωt −  θ ϕ ), p B = v BN i bB = V m I m
cos (ωt − 120°) cos (ωt −  θ ϕ  − 120°), p C = v CN i cC = V m I m
cos (ωt + 120°) cos (ωt −  θ ϕ  + 120°),
where Vm and Im represent the maximum amplitude of the phase voltage and

line current, respectively. The total instantaneous power is the sum of the
instantaneous phase powers, which reduces to 1.5VmImcosθϕ; that is,
pT=pA + pB + pC=1.5VmImcos θϕ.
Note that this result is consistent with Eq. 11.16 since Vm=2Vϕ and Im=2Iϕ
(see Problem 11.31).
Examples 11.3–11.5 illustrate power calculations in balanced three-phase
circuits.
Example 11.3 Calculating Power in

2. Calculate the total average power delivered to the load.
3. Calculate the total average power lost in the line.
4. Calculate the total average power lost in the generator.
5. Calculate the total number of magnetizing vars absorbed by the load.
6. Calculate the total complex power delivered by the source.
Solution
1. From Example 11.1, Vϕ=115.22 V, Iϕ=2.4 A, and θϕ=−1.19 
− (−36.87)=35.68°. Therefore
P ϕ = (115.22)(2.4) cos 35.68° = 224.64 W.

The power per phase may also be calculated from Iϕ2Rϕ, or
Pϕ=(2.4)2(39)=224.64 W.
2. The total average power delivered to the load is PT=3Pϕ=673.92 W. We
calculated the line voltage in Example 11.1, so we can also use Eq.
11.17:
P T = 3 (199.58)(2.4) cos 35.68° = 673.92 W.
3. The total power lost in the line is
Pline=3(2.4)2(0.8)=13.824 W.
4. The total internal power lost in the generator is
Pgen=3(2.4)2(0.2)=3.456 W.
5. The total number of magnetizing vars absorbed by the load is
Q T = 3 (199.58)(2.4) sin 35.68° = 483.84 VAR.
6. The total complex power associated with the source is
S T = 3 S ϕ =−3(120)(2.4)  36.87° = −691.20 − j518.40 VA.
The minus sign indicates that the average power and magnetizing
reactive power are being delivered to the circuit. We check this result by
calculating the total average and reactive power absorbed by the circuit:
P = 673.92 + 13.824 + 3.456 = 691.20 W (check), Q = 483.84 + 3 (2.4) 2
(1.5) + 3 (2.4) 2 (0.5) = 483.84 + 25.92 + 8.64 = 518.40 VAR(check).

V ϕ = V AB =202.72  29.04°  V, I ϕ = I AB =1.39  −6.87°  A.
Using Eq. 11.19, we have
S T = 3(202.72  29.04° )(1.39  6.87° ) = 682.56 + j494.21 VA.
2. The total average power at the sending end of the distribution line equals
the total average power delivered to the load plus the total average
power lost in the line; therefore
P input = 682.56 + 3 (2.4) 2 (0.3) = 687.74 W.
The fraction of the average power reaching the load is 682.56/687.74, or
99.25%. Nearly 100% of the average power at the input is delivered to
the load because the resistance of the line is quite small compared to the
load resistance.
Example 11.5 Calculating Three-
Phase Power with an Unspecified
Load
A balanced three-phase load requires 480 kW at a lagging power factor of
0.8. The load is fed from a line having an impedance of 0.005 + j0.025 Ω/ϕ.

The line voltage at the terminals of the load is 600 V.
1. Construct a single-phase equivalent circuit of the system.
2. Calculate the magnitude of the line current.
3. Calculate the magnitude of the line voltage at the sending end of the
line.
4. Calculate the power factor at the sending end of the line.
Solution
1. Figure 11.17 shows the single-phase equivalent circuit. We arbitrarily
selected the line-to-neutral voltage at the load as the reference.

phase equivalent circuit for
Example 11.5.

2. The line current IaA* appears in the equation for the complex power of
the load:
(6003)IaA*=(160 + j120)103 VA.
Solving for IaA* we get
IaA*=577.35   36.87° A.
Therefore,
I aA =577.35  −36.87°  A.
The magnitude of the line current is the magnitude of IaA, so
IL=577.35 A.
We obtain an alternative solution for IL from the expression
P T = 3 V L I L cos θ p = 3 (600) I L (0.8) = 480,000 W; I L = 480,000 3
(600)(0.8) = 1000 3 = 577.35 A.
3. To calculate the magnitude of the line voltage at the sending end, we
first calculate Van. From Fig. 11.17,
V an = V AN  +  Z ℓ I aA = 600 3  + (0.005 + j0.025)(577.35  −36.87° )
= 357.51  1.57°  V.
Thus
V L = 3 | V an | = 619.23 V.
4. The power factor at the sending end of the line is the cosine of the phase
angle between Van. and I aA  :
pf = cos  [1.57° − (−36.87°)] aA = cos 38.44° = 0.783 lagging.
An alternative method for calculating the power factor is to first

calculate the complex power at the sending end of the line:
S ϕ = (160 + j120) 10 3  +  (577.35) 2 (0.005 + j0.025) =
161.67 + j128.33 kVA = 206.41  38.44°  kVA.
The power factor is
pf = cos 38.44° = 0.783 lagging.
Finally, if we calculate the total complex power at the sending end, after
first calculating the magnitude of the line current, we can use this value
to calculate VL. That is,
3 V L I L = 3(206.41) ×  10 3 , V L = 3(206.41) ×  10 3 3 (577.35) , =
619.23 V.

11.6 Measuring Average Power in
Three-Phase Circuits
The instrument used to measure power in three-phase circuits is the
electrodynamometer wattmeter. It contains two coils. One coil, called the
current coil, is stationary and is designed to carry a current proportional to
the load current. The second coil, called the potential coil, is movable and
carries a current proportional to the load voltage. The important features of
the wattmeter are shown in Fig. 11.18.
Figure 11.18 The key features
of the electrodynamometer
wattmeter.


Figure 11.18 Full Alternative Text
The average deflection of the pointer attached to the movable coil is
proportional to the product of the rms current in the current coil, the rms
voltage impressed on the potential coil, and the cosine of the phase angle
between the voltage and current. The pointer deflects in a direction that
depends on the instantaneous polarity of the current-coil current and the
potential-coil voltage. Therefore, each coil has one terminal with a polarity
mark—usually a plus sign—but sometimes the double polarity mark ± is
used. The wattmeter deflects upscale when (1) the polarity-marked terminal
of the current coil is toward the source, and (2) the polarity-marked terminal
of the potential coil is connected to the same line in which the current coil has
been inserted.
The Two-Wattmeter Method
Consider a general network inside a box, with power supplied by n
conducting lines. Such a system is shown in Fig. 11.19. If we wish to
measure the total power at the terminals of the box, we need to know n−1
currents and voltages. This follows because if we choose one terminal as a
reference, there are only n−1 independent voltages. Likewise, only n−1
independent currents can exist in the n conductors entering the box. Thus, the
total power is the sum of n−1 product terms; that is, p=v1i1 + v2i2 + ⋯ + vn
−1in−1.
Figure 11.19 A general circuit
whose power is supplied by n
conductors.

Figure 11.19 Full Alternative Text
Applying this general observation, we can see that for a three-conductor
circuit, whether balanced or not, we need only two wattmeters to measure the
total power. For a four-conductor circuit, we need three wattmeters if the
three-phase circuit is unbalanced, but only two wattmeters if it is balanced,
because in the latter case there is no current in the neutral line. Thus, only
two wattmeters are needed to measure the total average power in any
balanced three-phase system.
The two-wattmeter method determines the magnitude and algebraic sign of
the average power indicated by each wattmeter. We can describe the basic
problem using the circuit shown in Fig. 11.20, where the two wattmeters are
indicated by the shaded boxes and labeled W1 and W2. The coil notations cc
and pc stand for current coil and potential coil, respectively. The current coils
of the wattmeters are inserted in lines aA and cC, making line bB the
reference line for the two potential coils. The load is Y-connected, and its

per-phase impedance is Zϕ=|Z|  θ. This is a general representation, as any Δ-
connected load can be represented by its Y equivalent; furthermore, for the
balanced case, the impedance angle θ is unaffected by the Δ-to-Y
transformation.
Figure 11.20 A circuit used to
analyze the two-wattmeter
method of measuring average
power delivered to a balanced
load.

Figure 11.20 Full Alternative Text
We now develop general equations for the readings of the two wattmeters,
making the following assumptions.
The current drawn by the potential coil of the wattmeter is negligible
compared with the line current measured by the current coil.

The loads can be modeled by passive circuit elements, so the phase
angle of the load impedance (θ in Fig. 11.20) lies between −90° (pure
capacitance) and +90° (pure inductance).
The phase sequence is positive.
From our introductory discussion of the average deflection of the wattmeter
and the placement of wattmeter 1 in Fig. 11.20, we note that the wattmeter
reading, W1, is
W1=|VAB||IaA| cos θ1 (11.20)
=VLIL cos θ1.
It follows that
W2=|VCB||IcC| cos θ2 (11.21)
=VLIL cos θ2.
In Eq. 11.20, θ1 is the phase angle between VAB and IaA, and in Eq. 11.21,
θ2 is the phase angle between VCB and IcC.
To calculate W1 and W2, we express θ1 and θ2 in terms of the impedance
angle θ, which is also the same as the phase angle between the phase voltage
and current. For a positive phase sequence,
θ1=θ + 30°=θϕ + 30°, (11.22)
θ2=θ − 30°=θϕ − 30°. (11.23)
The derivation of Eqs. 11.22 and 11.23 is left as an exercise (see Problem
11.46). When we substitute Eqs. 11.22 and 11.23 into Eqs. 11.20 and 11.21,
respectively, we get
W 1 = V L I L cos ( θ ϕ  + 30°), W 2 = V L I L cos ( θ ϕ  − 30°).
To find the total power, we add W1 and W2; thus
P T = W 1  +  W 2 =2 V L I L cos θ ϕ cos 30° = 3 V L I L cos θ ϕ ,
which is the expression for the total average power in a three-phase circuit,

given in Eq. 11.17. Therefore, we have confirmed that the sum of the two
wattmeter readings is the total average power.
A closer look at the expressions for W1 and W2 reveals the following about
the readings of the two wattmeters:
1. If the power factor is greater than 0.5, both wattmeters read positive.
2. If the power factor equals 0.5, one wattmeter reads zero.
3. If the power factor is less than 0.5, one wattmeter reads negative.
4. Reversing the phase sequence will interchange the readings on the two
wattmeters.
Example 11.6 and Problems 11.41–11.52 illustrate these observations.
Example 11.6 Computing
Wattmeter Readings in Three-Phase
Circuits
Calculate the reading of each wattmeter in the circuit in Fig. 11.20 if the
phase voltage at the load is 120 V and
1. Zϕ=8 + j6 Ω;
2. Zϕ=8 − j6 Ω;
3. Zϕ=5 + j5 3 Ω; and
4. Zϕ=10  −75°  Ω.
5. Verify for (a)–(d) that the sum of the wattmeter readings equals the total
power delivered to the load.

Solution
1. Z ϕ = 10  36.87°  Ω,  V L =120  3  V, I L = 120/10=12 A. W 1 = (120 3 )
(12) cos (36.87° + 30°)=979.75 W, W 2 = (120 3 )(12) cos (36.87° 
− 30°)=2476.25 W.
The power factor is cos 36.87∘=0.8, so as expected, both wattmeter
readings are positive.
2. Z ϕ = 10  −36.87°  Ω,  V L =120  3  V, I L = 120/10=12 A. W 1 = (120 3
)(12) cos (−36.87° + 30°)=2476.25 W, W 2 = (120 3 )(12) cos (−36.87° 
− 30°)=979.75 W.
The power factor is cos −36.87∘=0.8, so as expected, both wattmeter
readings are positive. But the readings on the wattmeters are
interchanged when compared to the results of part (a) because the sign
of the power factor angle changed, which has the same impact on the
wattmeter readings as a change in phase sequence.
3. Z ϕ = 5(1 + j 3 )=10  60°  Ω,  V L =120  3  V, and  I L =12 A. W 1 = (120
3 )(12) cos (60° + 30°)=0, W 2 = (120 3 )(12) cos (60° − 30°)=2160 W.
The power factor is cos 60∘=0.5, so as expected, one of the wattmeter
readings is zero.
4. Z ϕ = 10   −75°  Ω,  V L =120 3  V, I L =12 A. W 1 = (120 3 )
(12) cos (−75° + 30°)=1763.63 W, W 2 = (120 3 )(12) cos (−75° − 30°)=
−645.53 W.
The power factor is cos −75∘=0.26, so as expected, one wattmeter
reading is negative.
5. For each load impedance value, the real power delivered to a single
phase of the load is IL2RL, where RL is the resistive impedance of the
load. Since the three-phase circuit is balanced, the total real power
delivered to the three-phase load is 3IL2RL.

For the impedance in part (a),
P T = 3 ( 12 ) 2 ( 8 )=3456 W, W 1  +  W 2 =
979.75 + 2476.25=3456 W.
For the impedance in part (b),
P T = 3 ( 12 ) 2 ( 8 )=3456 W, W 1  +  W 2 = 2476.25 + 979.75=3456 W.
For the impedance in part (c),
P T = 3 ( 12 ) 2 ( 5 )=2160 W, W 1  +  W 2 = 0 + 2160=2160 W.
For the impedance in part (d),
Z φ = 2.5882−j9.6593 Ω so P T = 3 ( 12 ) 2 ( 2.5882 )=1118.10 W, W 1
 +  W 2 = 1763.63 − 645.53=1118.10 W.

Practical Perspective
Transmission and Distribution of
Electric Power
At the start of this chapter we noted that utilities must maintain the rms
voltage level at their customer’s premises. Although the acceptable deviation
from a nominal level may vary among different utilities, we will assume that
the tolerance is ±5%. Thus, a nominal rms voltage of 120 V could range from
114 V to 126 V. We also pointed out that strategically located capacitors can
be used to support voltage levels.
The circuit shown in Fig. 11.21 represents a substation in a municipal system.

We assume that the system is balanced, the line-to-line voltage at the
substation is 13.8 kV, the impedance of the distribution line is 0.6+j4.8Ω/φ,
and the load at the substation at 3:00 p.m. on a hot, humid day in July is
3.6 MW and 3.6 magnetizing MVAR.

The line current can be calculated from the expression for the complex power
at the substation. Thus,

13,8003IaA*=(1.2 + j1.2)106.
It follows that
IaA*=150.61 + j150.61 A
or
IaA=150.61 − j150.61 A.
The line-to-neutral voltage at the generating plant is the voltage drop across
the load, VAN, plus the voltage across the transmission line, so
V an = 13,800 3   0°  + (0.6 + j4.8)(150.61 − j150.61) =
8780.74 + j632.58=8803.50  4.12°  V.
Therefore, the magnitude of the line voltage at the generating plant is

|Vab|=3(8803.50)=15,248.11 V.
We are assuming the utility is required to keep the voltage level within ±5%
of the nominal value. This means the magnitude of the line-to-line voltage at
the power plant should not exceed 14.5 kV nor be less than 13.1 kV. The
magnitude of the line voltage at the generating plant exceeds 14.5 kV, so
could cause problems for customers.
To address this problem, connect a capacitor bank to the substation bus that
supplies the magnetizing vars required by the load. Now the generator does
not need to supply this reactive power, the load has a unity power factor, and
the line current IaA becomes
IaA=150.61 + j0 A.
Therefore, the voltage at the generating plant necessary to maintain a line-to-
line voltage of 13,800 V at the substation is
V an = 13,800 3   0°  + (0.6 + j4.8)(150.61 − j0) = 8057.80 + j722.94=8090.17 
5.13°  V.
Hence
|Vab|=3(8090.17)=14,012.58 V.
This voltage level falls within the allowable range of 13.1 kV to 14.5 kV.

Summary
A set of balanced three-phase voltages consists of three sinusoidal
voltages that have identical amplitudes and frequencies but are out of
phase with each other by exactly 120°. For the abc (or positive) phase
sequence,
V a = V m   0° ,      V b = V m   −120° ,      V c = V m   120° .
For the acb (or negative) phase sequence,
V a = V m   0° ,      V b = V m   120° ,      V c = V m   − 120° .
(See 414)
Three-phase systems can be unbalanced or balanced. A three-phase
system is balanced when the following conditions are satisfied:
1. The voltage sources form a balanced three-phase set.
2. The impedance of each phase of the voltage source is the same.
3. The impedance of each line is the same.
4. The impedance of each phase of the load is the same.
(See page 417.)
A single-phase equivalent circuit is used to calculate the line current
and the phase voltage in one phase of the Y-Y structure. The a-phase is
normally chosen for this purpose. If the structure is not Y-Y, any Δ
connections should be transformed into equivalent Y connections before
creating a single-phase equivalent circuit. (See 418.)
Once we know the line current and phase voltage in the a-phase
equivalent circuit, we can use analytical shortcuts to find any current or

voltage in a balanced three-phase circuit, based on the following facts:
The b- and c-phase currents and voltages are identical to the a-
phase current and voltage except for a 120° shift in phase. The
direction of the phase shift depends on the phase sequence.
The set of line voltages is out of phase with the set of phase
voltages by ±30°. The plus sign corresponds to the positive phase
sequence, while the minus sign corresponds to the negative phase
sequence.
In a Y-Y circuit, the magnitude of a line voltage is 3 times the
magnitude of a phase voltage.
The set of line currents is out of phase with the set of phase
currents in Δ-connected sources and loads by ∓30°. The minus sign
corresponds to the positive phase sequence, while the plus sign
corresponds to the negative phase sequence.
The magnitude of a line current is 3 times the magnitude of a phase
current in a Δ-connected source or load.
(See pages 419 and 423.)
The techniques for calculating per-phase average power, reactive power,
and complex power are identical to those introduced in Chapter 10. (See
page 425.)
The total real, reactive, and complex power can be determined either by
multiplying the corresponding per-phase quantity by 3 or by using the
expressions based on line current and line voltage, as given by Eqs.
11.17, 11.18, and 11.19. (See 426.)
The total instantaneous power in a balanced three-phase circuit is
constant and equals 1.5VmImpf. (See 427.)
A wattmeter measures the average power delivered to a load by using a
current coil connected in series with the load and a potential coil

connected in parallel with the load. (See 430.)
The total average power in a balanced three-phase circuit can be
measured by summing the readings of two wattmeters connected in two
different phases of the circuit. (See 432.)

Chapter Objectives
1. Be able to calculate the Laplace transform of a function using the
definition of Laplace transform, the Laplace transform table, and/or a
table of operational transforms.
2. Be able to calculate the inverse Laplace transform using partial fraction
expansion and the Laplace transform table.
3. Be able to find and plot the poles and zeros for a rational function in the
s-domain.
4. Understand and know how to use the initial-value theorem and the final-
value theorem.
We now introduce the Laplace transform, which forms the basis of a
powerful technique that is widely used to analyze linear, lumped-parameter
circuits. We need the Laplace transform analysis technique because we can
use it to solve the following types of problems.
Finding the transient behavior of circuits whose describing equations
consist of more than a single node-voltage or mesh-current differential
equation. In other words, analyzing multiple-node and multiple-mesh
circuits that are described by sets of linear differential equations.
Determining the transient response of circuits whose signal sources vary
in ways more complicated than the simple dc level jumps considered in
Chapters 7 and 8.
Calculating the transfer function for a circuit and using it to find the
steady-state sinusoidal response of that circuit when the frequency of the
sinusoidal source is varied. We discuss the transfer function in Chapter
13.
Relating the time-domain behavior of a circuit to its frequency-domain
behavior, in a systematic fashion.

In this chapter, we define the Laplace transform, discuss its pertinent
characteristics, and present a systematic method for transforming expressions
from the frequency domain to the time domain.
Practical Perspective
Transient Effects
As we learned in Chapter 9, power delivered from electrical wall outlets in
the United States can be modeled as a sinusoidal voltage or current source,
where the frequency of the sinusoid is 60 Hz. We used the phasor transform,
introduced in Chapter 9, to find the steady-state response of a circuit to a
sinusoidal source.
But in many cases, we need to consider the complete response of a circuit to
a sinusoidal source. Remember that the complete response has two parts—the
steady-state response that takes the same form as the input to the circuit, and
the transient response that decays to zero as time progresses. When a circuit’s
source is a 60 Hz sinusoid, the steady-state response is also a 60 Hz sinusoid
whose magnitude and phase angle can be calculated using phasor circuit
analysis. The transient response depends on the components that make up the
circuit, the values of those components, and the way the components are
interconnected. Once the source is switched into the circuit, the voltage and
current for every circuit component are the sum of a transient expression and
a steady-state expression.
The transient part of the voltage and current eventually decays to zero. But,
initially, the sum of the transient part and the steady-state part might exceed
the voltage or current rating of the circuit component. This is why it is
important to determine the complete response of a circuit. The Laplace
transform techniques introduced in this chapter can be used to find the
complete response of a circuit to a sinusoidal source.
Consider the RLC circuit shown below, comprised of components from
Appendix H and powered by a 60 Hz sinusoidal source. As detailed in

Appendix H, the 10 mH inductor has a current rating of 40 mA. The
amplitude of the sinusoidal source has been chosen so that this rating is not
exceeded in the steady state. Once we have presented the Laplace transform
method, we will be able to determine whether this current rating is exceeded
when the source is first switched on and both the transient and steady-state
components of the inductor current exist.

12.1 Definition of the Laplace
Transform
The Laplace transform of a function is given by the expression
Laplace Transform
L {f(t)}=∫0∞f(t)e−st dt,(12.1)
where the symbol L {f(t)} is read “the Laplace transform of f(t).”
The Laplace transform of f(t) is also denoted F(s); that is,
F(s)=L {f(t)}. (12.2)
This notation emphasizes that when the integral in Eq. 12.1 has been
evaluated, the resulting expression is a function of s. In our applications, t
represents the time domain and s represents the frequency domain. Note that
the dimension of s must be reciprocal time, or frequency, because the
exponent of e in the integral of Eq. 12.1 must be dimensionless. The Laplace
transform transforms the problem from the time domain to the frequency
domain. Once we solve the problem in the frequency domain, we inverse-
transform the solution back to the time domain.
Recall that the phasor is also a transform. As we know from Chapter 9, it
converts a sinusoidal signal into a complex number for easier, algebraic
computation of circuit values. After determining the phasor value of a signal,
we transform it back to its time-domain expression. Both the Laplace
transform and the phasor transform exhibit an essential feature of
mathematical transforms: They create a new domain to make the
mathematical manipulations easier. After finding the unknown in the new
domain, we inverse-transform it back to the original domain.

In circuit analysis, we use the Laplace transform to transform a set of
integrodifferential equations in the time domain to a set of algebraic
equations in the frequency domain. We can therefore find the solution for an
unknown quantity by solving a set of algebraic equations.
Before we illustrate some of the important properties of the Laplace
transform, some general comments are in order. First, note that the integral in
Eq. 12.1 is improper because the upper limit is infinite. Thus, we are
confronted immediately with the question of whether the integral converges.
In other words, does a given f(t) have a Laplace transform? Obviously, the
functions of primary interest in engineering analysis have Laplace
transforms; otherwise we would not be interested in the transform. In linear
circuit analysis, we excite circuits with sources that have Laplace transforms.
Excitation functions such as tt or et2, which do not have Laplace transforms,
are of no interest here.
Second, because the lower limit on the integral is zero, the Laplace transform
ignores f(t) for negative values of t. That is, F(s) is determined by the
behavior of f(t) only for positive values of t. To emphasize that the lower
limit is zero, Eq. 12.1 is frequently referred to as the one-sided, or
unilateral, Laplace transform. In the two-sided, or bilateral, Laplace
transform, the lower limit is − ∞. We do not use the bilateral form here;
hence, F(s) is understood to be the one-sided transform.
The Laplace transform’s lower limit creates a concern: what happens when
f(t) has a discontinuity at the origin? If f(t) is continuous at the origin, like the
function in Fig. 12.1(a), f(0) is not ambiguous. However, if f(t) has a finite
discontinuity at the origin, like the function in Fig. 12.1(b), should the
Laplace transform integral include or exclude the discontinuity? That is,
should we make the lower limit 0− and include the discontinuity, or choose
0+as the lower limit and exclude the discontinuity? (We use the notation 0−
and 0+ to denote values of t just to the left and right of the origin,
respectively.) Actually, we may choose either as long as we are consistent.
For reasons we explain later, we choose 0− as the lower limit.

discontinuous function at the

Because we are using 0− as the lower limit, we note that the integral from 0−
to 0+ is zero, except when the discontinuity at the origin is an impulse
function. We discuss this situation in Section 12.3. The two functions shown
in Fig. 12.1 have the same unilateral Laplace transform because there is no
impulse function at the origin for the function in Fig. 12.1(b).
The one-sided Laplace transform ignores f(t) for t<0−. We use initial
conditions to account for what happens prior to 0−. Thus, the Laplace
transform predicts the response to a function that begins after initial
conditions have been established.
In the discussion that follows, we divide the Laplace transforms into two
types: functional transforms and operational transforms. A functional
transform is the Laplace transform of a specific function, such as sinωt, t, e
−at, and so on. An operational transform defines a general mathematical
property of the Laplace transform, such as finding the transform of the
derivative of f(t). Before considering functional and operational transforms,

we introduce the step and impulse functions.

12.2 The Step Function
When a circuit contains a switch, a change in the switch position creates
abrupt changes in currents and voltages, as we have seen in previous
chapters. An abrupt change is represented mathematically as a discontinuity,
which can occur at any instant in time. We represent such discontinuities in
the functions that describe the currents and voltages using step and impulse
functions.
Figure 12.2 illustrates the step function.The symbol for the step function is
Ku(t). The mathematical definition of the step function is
Figure 12.2 The step function.
Figure 12.2 Full Alternative Text
Ku(t)=0, t<0,Ku(t)=K, t>0. (12.3)
If K is 1, the function in Eq. 12.3 is the unit step, u(t).

The step function is not defined at t=0. If we need to define the transition
between 0− and 0+, we assume that it is linear and that
Ku(0)=0.5K.
As before, 0− and 0+ represent symmetric points arbitrarily close to the left
and right of the origin. Figure 12.3 illustrates the linear transition from 0− to
0+.
Figure 12.3 The linear
approximation to the step
function.
Figure 12.3 Full Alternative Text
A discontinuity may occur at some time other than t=0; for example, it may
occur in sequential switching. A step that occurs at t=a is represented by the

function Ku(t−a). Thus
Ku(t−a)=0, t<a,Ku(t−a)=K, t>a.
If a>0, the step occurs to the right of the origin, and if a<0, the step occurs to
the left of the origin. The step function’s value is 0 when the argument t−a is
negative, and it is K when the argument is positive. Figure 12.4 illustrates a
step that occurs at t=a.
Figure 12.4 A step function
occurring at t=a when a>0.
Figure 12.4 Full Alternative Text
A step function equal to K for t<a is written as Ku(a−t). Thus
Ku(a−t)=K,    t<a,Ku(a−t)=0,     t<a,
The discontinuity is to the left of the origin when a<0. This type of step is
shown in Fig. 12.5.

Figure 12.5 Full Alternative Text
We can add two step functions to create a function that describes a finite-
width pulse. For example, the function K[u(t−1) − u(t−3)] has the value K for
1<t<3 and the value 0 everywhere else, so it is a finite-width pulse of height
K initiated at t=1 and terminated at t=3. In defining this pulse, think of the
step function u(t−1) as “turning on” the constant value K at t=1, and the step
function −u(t−3) as “turning off” the constant value K at t=3. We use step
functions to turn on and turn off linear functions at desired times in Example
12.1.

Solution
The function shown in Fig. 12.6 is made up of linear segments, so it is a
piecewise linear function. You have probably seen such functions defined
using a different functional form for each of its time segments. For this
function, the piecewise-linear definition is
=0,t≤0;=2t,0s≤t≤1s;f(t)=−2t+4,1s≤t≤3s;=2t−8,3s≤t≤4s;=0,t≥4s.
We can construct a single continuous definition for this function using step
functions to initiate and terminate each linear segment at the proper times. In
other words, we use the step function to turn on and turn off the three
nonzero pieces of the function:
+2t, on at t=0, off at t=1;−2t+4, on at t=1, off at t=3;+2t
−8, on at t=3, off at t=4.
These straight line segments and their equations are shown in Fig. 12.7. The
expression for f(t), valid for all values of t, is

12.3 The Impulse Function
An impulse is a signal of infinite amplitude and zero duration. Such signals
don’t exist in nature, but some circuit signals come very close to
approximating this definition, so a mathematical model of an impulse is
useful. For example, the impulse function1 enables us to define the derivative
at a discontinuity, such as the one in the function of Fig. 12.1(b), and thus to
define the Laplace transform of that derivative. Also, voltage and current
impulses occur in circuit analysis either because of a switching operation or
because the circuit is excited by an impulsive source. We will analyze these
situations in Chapter 13, but here we define the impulse function generally.
1The impulse function is also known as the Dirac delta function.
Describing the Impulse Function
We describe the impulse function by considering how we would define the
derivative of the function in Fig. 12.1(b) at its discontinuity. First, we assume
that the function varies linearly across the discontinuity, as shown in Fig.
12.8. In this figure, note that as ϵ→0, an abrupt discontinuity occurs at the
origin. When we differentiate the function, the derivative between −ϵ and +ϵ
is constant, with a value of 1/2ϵ. For t>ϵ, the derivative is −ae−a(t−ε). Figure
12.9 shows these observations graphically. As ϵ approaches zero, the value of
f′(t) between ±ϵ  approaches infinity. At the same time, the duration of this
large value is approaching zero. Furthermore, the area under f′(t) between ±ϵ 
remains constant as ϵ→0. In this example, the area is unity. As ϵ  approaches
zero, we say that the function between ±ϵ approaches a unit impulse
function, denoted Δ(t). Thus, the derivative of f(t)at the origin approaches a
unit impulse function as ϵ  approaches zero, or

of the discontinuity in Fig.
12.1(b), assuming a linear
transition between −ϵ  and +ϵ .

the function shown in Fig. 12.8.

Figure 12.9 Full Alternative Text
f′(0)→Δ(t) as ϵ →0.
If the area under the impulse function curve is other than unity, the impulse
function is denoted KΔ(t), where K is the area. K is often referred to as the
strength of the impulse function.
To summarize, an impulse function is created from a variable-parameter
function whose parameter approaches zero. The variable-parameter function
must exhibit the following three characteristics as the parameter approaches
zero:
1. The amplitude of the function approaches infinity.
2. The duration of the function approaches zero.

3. The area under the variable-parameter function is constant as the
parameter changes.
Many different variable-parameter functions have these three characteristics.
In Fig. 12.8, we used a linear function f(t)=0.5t/ϵ +0.5. Another example of a
variable-parameter function with the three characteristics is the exponential
function:
f(t)=K2ϵe−|t|/ϵ.
As ϵ approaches zero, the function becomes infinite at the origin and at the
same time decays to zero in an infinitesimal length of time.
Figure 12.10 illustrates f(t) as ϵ→0. An impulse function is created as ε→0 if
the area under the function is independent of ϵ. Thus,
Figure 12.10 A variable-
parameter function used to
generate an impulse function.

ϵ|0∞=K2 + K2=K,
so the area under the curve is constant and equal to K units. Therefore, as
ϵ→0, f(t)→KΔ(t).
Defining the Impulse Function and
Its Sifting Property
Mathematically, the impulse function is defined as
∫−∞∞KΔ(t)dt=K; (12.4)
Δ(t)=0,t≠0. (12.5)
Equation 12.4 states that the area under the impulse function is constant. This

area represents the strength of the impulse. Equation 12.5 states that the
impulse is zero everywhere except at t=0. An impulse that occurs at t=a is
denoted KΔ(t−a). The graphic symbol for the impulse function is an arrow.
The strength of the impulse is given parenthetically next to the head of the
arrow. Figure 12.11 shows the impulses KΔ(t) and KΔ(t−a).
Figure 12.11 A graphic
representation of the impulse
KΔ(t) and KΔ(t−a).
Figure 12.11 Full Alternative Text
An important property of the impulse function is the sifting property, which
is expressed as
∫−∞∞f(t)Δ(t−a)dt=f(a), (12.6)
where we assume the function f(t) is continuous at t=a, the location of the

impulse. Equation 12.6 shows that the impulse function sifts out all values of
f(t) except the one at t=a. Equation 12.6 follows from Eqs. 12.4 and 12.5,
noting that Δ(t−a) is zero everywhere except at t=a, and hence the integral
can be written
∫−∞∞f(t)Δ(t−a) dt=∫a−ϵa+ϵf(t)Δ(t−a) dt.
But because f(t) is continuous at a, it takes on the value f(a) as t→a, so
∫ a−ϵ a+ϵ f ( a )Δ( t−a )dt = f( a ) ∫ a−ϵ a+ϵ Δ ( t−a ) dt = f( a ).
Laplace Transform and Derivatives
of the Impulse Function
We use the sifting property of the impulse function to find its Laplace
transform:
L { Δ( t ) }= ∫ 0 − ∞ Δ ( t ) e −st  dt= e −s(0) =1,
which is an important Laplace transform. We can also define the derivatives
of the impulse function and the Laplace transform of these derivatives. We
discuss the first derivative, along with its transform, and then state the result
for the higher-order derivatives.
The function illustrated in Fig. 12.12(a) generates an impulse function as
ϵ→0. Figure 12.12(b) shows the derivative of this impulse-generating
function, which is defined as the derivative of the impulse [Δ′(t)] as ϵ→0.
The derivative of the impulse function sometimes is referred to as a moment
function, or unit doublet.

To find the Laplace transform of Δ′(t), we apply the defining integral to the
function shown in Fig. 12.12(b) and, after integrating, let ϵ→0. Then
ℒ { Δ′(t) }=limϵ→0[ ∫ −ϵ 0− 1ϵ2e−st dt  +  ∫ 0+ ϵ (−1ϵ2)e−stdt ]=limϵ→0esϵ
+e−sϵ−2sϵ2=limϵ→0sesϵ−se−sϵ2ϵs=limϵ→0s2esϵ+s2e−sϵ2s=s.
We used l’Hôpital’s rule twice in this derivation, to evaluate the
indeterminate form 0/0.
Higher-order derivatives can be generated in a similar manner (see Problem
12.6), and the defining integral can then be used to find the Laplace
transforms. The Laplace transform of the nth derivative of the impulse
function is
L {Δ(n)(t)}=sn.
Finally, note that the derivative of a step function is an impulse function; that

is,
Δ(t)=du(t)dt.
Figure 12.13 depicts the relationship between the impulse function and the
step function. The function shown in Fig. 12.13(a) approaches a unit step
function as ϵ→0. The function shown in Fig. 12.13(b)—the derivative of the
function in Fig. 12.13(a)—approaches a unit impulse as ϵ→0.

The impulse function is an extremely useful concept in circuit analysis, and
we say more about it in the following chapters. We introduced the concept
here so that we can include discontinuities at the origin in our definition of
the Laplace transform.

12.4 Functional Transforms
The Laplace transform of a specified function of t is called a functional
transform. Because we are using the unilateral, or one-sided, Laplace
transform, we define all functions to be zero for t<0−.
We derived one functional transform pair in Section 12.3, where we showed
that the Laplace transform of the unit impulse function equals 1. Next, we
find the Laplace transform of the unit step function at the origin, where
ℒ{ u(t) }= ∫ 0∞ f(t)e−st dt= ∫ 0+∞ 1e−stdt=e−st−s|0+∞=1s.
Thus, the Laplace transform of the unit step function is 1/s.

discontinuity at the origin is zero.

12.5 Operational Transforms
Operational Laplace transforms define how mathematical operations
performed on f(t) affect its Laplace transform, F(s). Operational transforms
also define how mathematical operations performed on F(s) affect its
corresponding time-domain function f(t). The operations we consider include
(1) multiplication by a constant; (2) addition and subtraction; (3)
differentiation; (4) integration; (5) translation in the time domain; (6)
translation in the frequency domain; and (7) scale changing.
Multiplication by a Constant
From the defining integral, if
L {f(t)}=F(s),
then
L {Kf(t)}=KF(s).
Thus, multiplication of f(t) by a constant corresponds to multiplying F(s) by
the same constant.
Addition and Subtraction
Addition and subtraction in the time domain translates into addition and
subtraction in the frequency domain. Thus if
ℒ{ f1(t) }=F1(s),ℒ{ f2(t) }=F2(s),ℒ{ f3(t) }=F3(s),
then
L {f1(t)+f2(t)−f3(t)}=F1(s)+F2(s)−F3(s).

Use the defining integral to derive this operation transform by recognizing
that the integral of a sum of functions equals the sum of each function’s
integral.
Differentiation
We use the definition of the Laplace transform to find the operational
transform for differentiation in the time domain:
ℒ{ df(t)dt }=∫0−∞[ df(t)dt ]e−st dt.
We integrate by parts to evaluate this integral. Let u=e−st and dv=[df(t)/dt] dt
to give
ℒ{ df(t)dt }=e−stf(t)|0−∞ − ∫0−∞f(t)(−se−stdt).
Because we are assuming that f(t) has a Laplace transform, evaluating e
−stf(t) at t=∞ gives zero. We complete the evaluation of the integral to get
−f(0−) + s∫0−∞f(t)e−stdt=sF(s)−f(0−).
Thus, the Laplace transform of the derivative of f(t) is
L{df(t)dt}=sF(s)−f(0−).
This important result shows that differentiation in the time domain transforms
to an algebraic operation in the s domain.
Use the Laplace transform of the first derivative of f(t) to find the Laplace
transform of higher-order derivatives. For example, to find the Laplace
transform of the second derivative of f(t), we first let
g(t)=df(t)dt.
Now we find the Laplace transform of g(t):
G(s)=sF(s)−f(0−).

But because
dg(t)dt=d2f(t)dt2,
we know
L{dg(t)dt}=L{d2f(t)dt2}=sG(s) − g(0−).
Therefore,
L{d2f(t)dt2}=s2F(s) − sf(0−) − df(0−)dt.
We find the Laplace transform of the nth derivative by successively applying
the preceding process, which leads to the general result
L{dnf(t)dtn}=snF(s)−sn−1f(0−)−sn−2df(0−)dt
− sn−3d2f(0−)dt2 − ⋯ − dn−1f(0−)dtn−1.
Integration
We find the Laplace transform of the integral of f(t) by again applying the
defining integral:
ℒ{ ∫0−tf(x) dx }=∫0−∞[ ∫0−tf(x) dx ] e−st dt.
Integrate by parts to evaluate the integral on the right-hand side of this
expression. Let
u=∫0−tf(x) dx,dv=e−st dt.
Then
du=f(t) dt,v=−e−sts.
The integration-by-parts formula yields
ℒ{ ∫0−tf(x)dx }=−e−sts∫0−tf(x)dx|0−∞+∫0−∞e−stsf(t) dt.

The first term on the right-hand side is zero at both the upper and lower
limits. The value at the lower limit is zero because both limits on the integral
are the same. The value at the upper limit is zero because e−st→0as t→∞.
The second term on the right-hand side is F(s)/s; therefore
L{∫0−tf(x) dx}=F(s)s,
which reveals that integration in the time domain transforms to multiplication
by 1/s in the s domain. We have therefore demonstrated that the Laplace
transform translates a set of integrodifferential equations into a set of
algebraic equations.
Translation in the Time Domain
If we start with any function f(t) u(t), we can represent the same function,
translated in time by the constant a, as f(t−a) u(t−a).2 To find the Laplace
transform of f(t−a) u(t−a), start with the defining integral:
2Note that throughout we multiply any arbitrary function f(t) by the unit step
function u(t) to ensure that the resulting function is defined for all positive
time.
ℒ{ (t−a) u(t−a) }=∫0−∞u(t−a)f(t−a)e−st dt=∫a∞f(t−a)e−st dt.
In writing this equation, we took advantage of u(t−a)=0 for t<a. Now change
the variable of integration by letting x=t−a. Then x=0 when t=a, x=∞ when
t=∞ and dx=dt. Rewrite the integral as
ℒ{ f(t−a) u(t−a) }=∫0∞f(x)e−s(x+a) dx=e−sa∫0∞f(x)e−sx dx=e−asF(s).
Thus
L {f(t−a) u(t−a)}=e−asF(s), a>0.
Translation in the time domain corresponds to multiplication by an
exponential in the frequency domain.

For example, knowing that
L {tu(t)}=1s2,
we can use this operational transform to find the Laplace transform of (t
−a) u(t−a):
L {(t−a) u(t−a)}=e−ass2.
Translation in the Frequency
Domain
Translation in the frequency domain corresponds to multiplication by an
exponential in the time domain:
L {e−atf(t)}=F(s+a),
which follows from the defining integral. Problem 12.15 asks you to derive
this result.
We can use this operational transform to derive new transform pairs. Thus,
knowing that
L {cos ωt}=ss2+ω2,
we use the effect of translation in the frequency domain to deduce that
L {e−at cos ωt}=s+a(s+a)2+ω2.
Scale Changing
The scale-change property gives the relationship between f(t) and F(s) when
the time variable is multiplied by a positive constant:

L {f(at)}=1aF(sa), a>0.
The derivation is left to Problem 12.16. The scale-change property is
particularly useful in experimental work, when time-scale changes are made
to assist in building a model of a system.
We use this operational transform to formulate new transform pairs. Thus,
knowing that
L {cos t}=ss2+1,
we use the effect of scale changing to show that
L {cos ωt}=1ω s/ω(s/ω)2 + 1=ss2 + ω2.

12.6 Applying the Laplace
Transform
We now use the Laplace transform to solve the ordinary integrodifferential
equations that describe the behavior of a lumped-parameter circuit, such as
the one shown in Fig. 12.16. We assume that no initial energy is stored in the
circuit at the instant the switch is opened. The problem is to find the time-
domain expression for v(t) when t≥0.
Figure 12.16 A parallel RLC
circuit.
Figure 12.16 Full Alternative Text
We begin by writing the integrodifferential equation that v(t) must satisfy,
using a single KCL equation to describe the circuit. Summing the currents
away from the top node in the circuit gives:
v(t)R + 1ℒ∫0tv(x) dx+ Cdv(t)dt=Idcu(t).
Note that we represented the switch opening at t=0 with the product of the

source current and the unit step function, Idcu(t).
We transform the KCL equation into the s-domain using four operational
transforms (multiplication by a constant, addition, integration, and
differentiation) and one functional transform (unit step) to get
V(s)R + 1LV(s)s + C[sV(s) − v(0−)]=Idc(1s).
The result is an algebraic equation with one unknown variable, V(s). We are
assuming that the circuit parameters R, L, and C, as well as the source current
Idc, are known; the initial voltage on the capacitor v(0−) is zero because the
initial energy stored in the circuit is zero. Thus, we have reduced the problem
to solving an algebraic equation.
Solving for V(s) gives
V(s)(1R+1sL+sC)=Idcs,V(s)=Idc/Cs2+(1/RC)s+(1/LC).
To find v(t), we must inverse-transform the expression for V(s). We denote
this inverse operation as
v(t)=L−1{V(s)}.
The inverse transform, which takes the solution from the s-domain to the time
domain, is the subject of Section 12.7. In that section, we also present a final,
critical step: checking the validity of the resulting time-domain expression.
This final step is not unique to the Laplace transform; it is always a good idea
to test any derived solution to be sure it makes sense in terms of known
system behavior.
Before continuing, we simplify the notation by dropping the parenthetical t in
time-domain expressions and the parenthetical s in frequency-domain
expressions. We use lowercase letters for all time-domain variables, and we
represent the corresponding s-domain variables with uppercase letters. Thus
ℒ{ v }=V     or v=ℒ−1{ V },ℒ{ i }=I   ori=ℒ−1{ I },ℒ{ f }=F orf=ℒ−1{
F },
and so on.

Example 12.2 supplies component values for the circuit in Fig, 12.16 and
uses Laplace transforms to predict the circuit’s output voltage.
Example 12.2 Using Laplace
Transforms to Predict a Circuit’s
Response
Suppose for the circuit in Fig. 12.16, Idc=24 mA, R=400Ω, L=25 mH, and
C=25 nF. There is no energy stored in the circuit when the switch opens at
t=0. Find the Laplace transform of v(t) and use it to predict the functional
form of v(t).
Solution
Using the expression for V(s) found for the circuit in Fig. 12.16,
V(s)=Idc/Cs2+(1/RC)s+(1/ℒC)=0.024/(25×10−9)s2+[ 1/(400)(25×10−9) ]s+[
1/(0.025)(25×10−9) ]=96×104s2+105s+16×108
The expression for V(s) is not a familiar functional Laplace transform, so we
cannot use Tables 12.1 or 12.2 to find its inverse transform. But note that we
can rewrite the denominator of V(s) as the product of two factors:
V(s)=96×104(s+20,000)(s+80,000).
Now, recognize that we can write V(s) as the sum of two terms, with each
factor appearing in the denominator of one term:
V(s)=K1(s+20,000)+K2(s+80,000).
Each of these terms looks like a familiar Laplace transform. Using the
transform for the exponential function (Table 12.1) and the operational

transforms for multiplication by a constant and addition (Table 12.2) we
predict that v(t) is the sum of two exponential terms in the form e−20,000t
and e−80,000t.

12.7 Inverse Transforms
The expression for V(s) in Example 12.2 is a rational function of s. This
means we can write V(s) as a ratio of two polynomials in s where only
integer powers of s appear in the polynomials. For linear, lumped-parameter
circuits with constant component values, the s-domain expressions for the
unknown voltages and currents are always rational functions of s. (For
verification, work Problems 12.27–12.31.) If we can inverse-transform
rational functions of s, we can find the time-domain expressions for the
voltages and currents. This section presents a straightforward and systematic
technique for finding the inverse transform of a rational function.
In general, we need to find the inverse transform of a function that has the
form
F(s)=N(s)D(s)=ansn+an−1sn−1+⋯+a1s+a0bmsm+bm−1sm−1+⋯+b1s+b0.
(12.7)
The coefficients a and b are real constants, and the exponents m and n are
positive integers. The ratio N(s)/D(s) is called a proper rational function if
m>n, and an improper rational function if m≤n. Only a proper rational
function can be expanded as a sum of partial fractions. This restriction poses
no problem, as we show at the end of this section.
Partial Fraction Expansion: Proper
Rational Functions
A proper rational function is expanded into a sum of partial fractions by
writing a term or a series of terms for each root of D(s). Thus, D(s) must be
factored before we construct a partial fraction expansion. For each distinct
root of D(s), a single term appears in the sum of partial fractions. For each
multiple root of D(s) of multiplicity r, the sum of partial fractions contains r
terms. For example, in the rational function

s+6s(s+3)(s+1)2,
the denominator has four roots. Two of these roots are distinct—namely, at
s=0 and s=−3. A multiple root of multiplicity 2 occurs at s=−1. Thus, the
partial fraction expansion takes the form
s+6s(s+3)(s+1)2≡K1s+K2s+3+K3(s+1)2+K4s+1.
To find the inverse transform from the sum of partial fractions, we identify
the f(t) corresponding to each term in the sum using the functional and
operational transform tables. Use Tables 12.1 and 12.2 to verify that
L−1{K1s+K2s+3+K3(s+1)2+K4s+1}   =(K1+K2e−3t+K3te−t+K4e−t)u(t).
Now we need to find the numerator coefficients (K1,K2,K3,…) that appear in
each partial fraction term. There are only four different types of partial
fraction terms because the roots of D(s) can be (1) real and distinct; (2)
complex and distinct; (3) real and repeated; or (4) complex and repeated. We
develop a technique to determine the numerator coefficient for each type of
partial fraction term. Before doing so, a few general comments are in order.
We used the identity sign ≡ in the partial fraction expansion to emphasize that
expanding a rational function into a sum of partial fractions establishes an
identical equation. This means that both sides of the equation must be the
same for all values of the variable s. Also, the identity relationship must hold
when the same mathematical operation is applied to both sides. These
observations will help us calculate the coefficient values.
Before creating a partial fraction expansion, you should verify that the
rational function is proper. This check is important because the procedure for
finding the partial fraction coefficients will not prevent you from generating
invalid results if the rational function is improper. We present a procedure for
checking the coefficients, but you can avoid wasted effort by always asking,
“Is F(s) a proper rational function?”
Partial Fraction Expansion: Distinct

Real Roots of D(s)
Let’s find the partial fraction expansion of a proper rational function whose
denominator has distinct real roots. For example,
F(s)=N(s)(s+p1)(s+p2)(s+p3)≡K1(s+p1)+K2(s+p2)+K3(s+p3).
To find K1 for the first partial fraction term, we multiply both sides of the
identity by the denominator beneath K1 to get
N(s)(s+p2)(s+p3)≡K1+K2(s+p1)(s+p2)+K3(s+p1)(s+p3).
Then when we evaluate both sides of the identity for s=−p1, which is the root
of the partial fraction term whose coefficient is K1:
N(s)(s+p2)(s+p3)|s=−p1                         ≡K1+K2(s+p1)(s+p2)|s=−p1+K3(s+p1)
(s+p3)|s=−p1=K1.
The right-hand side is always the desired K, and the left-hand side is always
its numerical value. To find K2 and K3, repeat the steps used to find K1.
Example 12.3 illustrates this process.
Example 12.3 Finding the Inverse
Laplace Transform when F(s) has
Distinct Real Roots
Use partial fraction expansion to find the inverse Laplace transform of
F(s)=96(s+5)(s+12)s(s+8)(s+6).
Solution

The partial fraction expansion of F(s) is
F(s)=96(s+5)(s+12)s(s+8)(s+6)≡K1s+K2(s+8)+K3(s+6).
To find the value of K1, we multiply both sides by s and then evaluate both
sides at s=0:
96(s+5)(s+12)(s+8)(s+6)|s=0≡K1+K2ss+8|s=0+K3ss+6|s=0,
or
96(5)(12)8(6)=K1=120.
To find the value of K2, we multiply both sides by s+8 and then evaluate
both sides at s=−8:
96(s+5)(s+12)s(s+6)|s=−8     ≡K1(s+8)s|s=−8+K2+K3(s+8)(s+6)|s=−8,
or
96(−3)(4)(−8)(−2)=K2=−72.
Then K3 is
96(s+5)(s+12)s(s+8)|s=−6=K3=48.
Therefore,
96(s+5)(s+12)s(s+8)(s+6)=120s−72(s+8)+48(s+6).
It is a good idea to test this result. While the choice of test values is
completely open, we choose values that are easy to verify. For example,
testing at either −5 or −12 is convenient because in both cases the left-hand
side reduces to zero. Choosing −5 yields
120−5−723+481=−24−24+48=0,
whereas testing −12 gives

120−12−72−4+48−6=−10+18−8=0.
Now find the inverse transform of F(s) using the tables of functional and
operational transforms (Tables 12.1 and 12.2):
L−1{96(s+5)(s+12)s(s+8)(s+6)}=(120−78e−8t+48e−6t) u(t).

Partial Fraction Expansion: Distinct
Complex Roots of D(s)
We begin by noting that if F(s) describes the Laplace transform of a voltage
or current in a physically realizable circuit, the factors of D(s) that have
complex roots will always come in conjugate pairs. Let’s assume that
F(s)=A(s+z1)(s+α−jβ)(s+α+jβ)≡K1(s+α−jβ)+K2(s+α+jβ).
Here we assume that z1 is a real number.
We find the unknown coefficients, K1 and K2, using the same technique we
employed when the factors of D(s) were real and distinct. As you will see, the
only difference is that the algebra involves complex numbers. To find K1, we
multiply both sides of the identity by the denominator beneath K1 to get
A(s+z1)(s+α+jβ)≡K1+K2(s+α−jβ)(s+α+jβ).
Then when we evaluate both sides of the identity for s=−α+jβ, which is the
root of the partial fraction term whose coefficient is K1:
A(s+z1)(s+α+jβ)|s=−α+jβ≡K1+K2(s+α−jβ)(s+α+jβ)|s=−α+jβ=K1.
We evaluate the left-hand side of the identity to get an expression for K1:
K1=A(−α+z1+jβ)(j2β)=A2+j(α−z12β).
As expected, K1 is a complex number. We repeat the steps used to find K1
when finding the expression for K2:
A(s+z1)(s+α−jβ)=K1(s+α+jβ)(s+α−jβ)+K2;
A(s+z1)(s+α−jβ)|s=−α−jβ=K1(s+α+jβ)(s+α−jβ)|s=−α−jβ=K2;
K2=A(−α+z1−jβ)(−j2β)=A2−j(α−z12β).
Compare the expression for K1 with the expression for K2; K1 and K2 are
conjugates. This will always be the case when D(s) has complex roots, so we

need only calculate one coefficient, since the other is its conjugate. We can
use the following general polar form for K1 and K2:
K1=|K|ejθ and K2=|K|e−jθ.
Using the polar form for the general coefficients K1 and K2, we can find the
inverse Laplace transform of F(s), with the help of the functional and
operational transform tables (Tables 12.1 and 12.2) and Euler’s identity:
ℒ−1{ | K |ejθs+α−jβ+| K |e−jθs+α+jβ }=| K |ejθe−(α−jβ)t+| K |e−jθe−(α
+jβ)t=| K |e−αtej(βt+θ)+| K |e−αte−j(βt+θ)=| K |e−αt[ cos(βt+θ)+jsin(βt+θ) ]+|
K |e−αt[ cos(βt+θ)−jsin(βt+θ) ]=2| K |e−αtcos(βt+θ).
Because distinct complex roots appear frequently in lumped-parameter linear
circuit analysis, we summarize these results with a new transform pair.
Whenever D(s) contains distinct complex roots—that is, factors of the form
(s+α−jβ)(s+α+jβ)—a pair of terms of the form
Ks+α−jβ+K*s+α+jβ
appears in the partial fraction expansion, where the partial fraction coefficient
is, in general, a complex number. In polar form,
K= | K | e jθ =| K | θ , (12.8)
where |K| denotes the magnitude of the complex coefficient. Then
K * =| K | e −jθ =| K |  −θ . (12.9)
The pair of complex conjugate partial fraction terms always inverse-
transforms as
L−1{Ks+α−jβ+K*s+α+jβ}
=2|K|e−αt cos (βt+θ). (12.10)
In applying Eq. 12.10, it is important to note that K is defined as the
coefficient associated with the denominator s+α−jβ, and K* is defined as the
coefficient associated with the denominator s+α+jβ.

Example 12.4 finds the inverse Laplace transform of an s-domain function
with distinct complex roots.
Example 12.4 Finding the Inverse
Laplace Transform when F(s) has
Distinct Complex Roots
Use partial fraction expansion to find the inverse Laplace transform of
F(s)=100(s+3)(s+6)(s2+6s+25).
Solution
We begin by noting that F(s) is a proper rational function. Next we find the
roots of the quadratic term s2+6s+25:
s2+6s+25=(s+3−j4)(s+3+j4).
With the denominator in factored form, we create the partial fraction
expansion:
100(s+3)(s+6)(s2+6s+25)≡                           K1s+6+K2s+3−j4+K2*s+3+j4.
Find K1 and K2 using the same process employed in Example 12.3:
K1=100(s+3)s2+6s+25|s=−6=100(−3)25=−12,K2=100(s+3)(s+6)(s+3+j4)|s=
−3+j4=100(j4)(3+j4)(j8)=6−j8=10e−j53.13°.
Thus
100(s+3)(s+6)(s2+6s+25)     ≡
−12s+6+10  −53.13°s+3−j4+10  53.13°s+3+j4.

Before inverse-transforming the terms in the partial fraction expansion, we
check the expansion numerically. We test using s=−3 because the left-hand
side reduces to zero at this value:
F(s)=−123+10 −53.13°−j4+10 53.13°j4=−4+2.5 36.87°_+2.5 −36.87°_=
−4+2.0+j1.5+2.0−j1.5=0.

Partial Fraction Expansion:
Repeated Real Roots of D(s)
We describe two methods for finding the partial fraction coefficients for
terms generated by a multiple root with multiplicity r. Method A requires you
to solve several simultaneous algebraic equations. Method B is a
modification of the process we have been using to find the coefficients for the
partial fraction terms associated with distinct roots. Both methods begin with
the identity relating the original s-domain function, which must be a proper
rational function, and its partial fraction expansion:
N(s)D(s)≡K1(s+p)r+K2(s+p)r−1+⋯+Kr(s+p)
Method A
1. Combine all terms in the partial fraction expansion over the common
denominator, D(s). Call the numerator of this new function N1(s).
2. Collect all of the terms in the numerator N1(s) according to their power
of s. The coefficient of each power of s will include some of the
unknown partial fraction coefficients.
3. Equate the coefficient of each power of s in N1(s) with the coefficient of
the corresponding power of s in N(s). The result is a collection of
simultaneous equations whose unknowns are the partial fraction
coefficients.
4. Solve the simultaneous equations to find the partial fraction coefficients.

Method B
1. Multiply both sides of the identity defining the partial fraction expansion
by the multiple root raised to its rth power. Call the resulting identity Ir.
2. Find K in the numerator of the factor raised to the rth power by
evaluating both sides of Ir at the multiple root.
3. To find K in the numerator of the factor raised to the (r–1) power,
differentiate both sides of Ir with respect to s. Call the resulting identity
I(r−1). Evaluate both sides of I(r−1) at the multiple root. The right-hand
side is always the desired K, and the left-hand side is always its
numerical value.
4. Repeat Step 3 to find the remaining partial fraction coefficients by
differentiating I(r−1) to get I(r−2) and so on. In total, you will have
differentiated Ir(r–1) times.
Example 12.5 uses Method A to find the inverse Laplace transform for an s-
domain function with repeated real roots.
Example 12.5 Finding the Inverse
Laplace Transform when F(s) has
Repeated Real Roots
Use partial fraction expansion to find the inverse Laplace transform of
F(s)=100(s+25)s(s+5)3.
Solution
We begin by noting that F(s) is a proper rational function. Next we find
partial fraction expansion of F(s):

100(s+25)s(s+5)3≡K1s+K2(s+5)3+K3(s+5)2+K4s+5.
We will use Method A to find the partial fraction coefficients. Begin by
multiplying the numerator and denominator of each term in the partial
fraction expansion with an expression that creates a denominator of s(s+5)3
in each term:
100(s+25)s(s+5)3≡K1(s+5)3s(s+5)3+K2ss(s+5)3                                   +K3s(s+5)s
Combine the terms on the right-hand side over their common denominator,
and expand the resulting numerator by collectiong the coefficients for each
power of s. The numerator on the right-hand side is
(K1+K4)s3+(15K1+K3+10K4)s2               +(35K1+K2+5K3+25K4)s               +
(125K1).
Equate the coefficients of each power of s in the numerators on the right-hand
side and left-hand side to create four simultaneous equations:
K1+K4=0;15K1+K3+10K4=0;35K1+K2+5K3+25K4=100;125K1=2500.
Solve the simultaneous equations to find
K1=20;K2=−400;K3=−100;K4=−20.
Therefore, the partial fraction expansion is
100(s+25)s(s+5)3≡20s−400(s+5)3−100(s+5)2−20s+5.
At this point, we can check our expansion by testing both sides at s=−25; for
this value of s, both sides should equal zero. The result of evaluating the
partial fraction expansion at s=−25 is
20−25−400(−20)3−100(−20)2−20(−20)=0.
Use the functional and operational transform tables (Tables 12.1 and 12.2) to
transform each term in the partial fraction expansion. Thus, the inverse
transform of F(s) is

L−1{100(s+25)s(s+5)3}=[20−200t2e−5t−100te−5t−20e−5t]u(t).

Partial Fraction Expansion:
Repeated Complex Roots of D(s)

We can find the coefficients of the partial fraction terms corresponding to
repeated complex roots using either Method A or Method B. The algebra
involves complex numbers. Recall that complex roots always appear in
conjugate pairs and that the coefficients associated with a conjugate pair are
also conjugates, so that only half the Ks need to be evaluated. We illustrate
the process using Method B in Example 12.6.
Example 12.6 Finding the Inverse
Laplace Transform when F(s) has
Repeated Complex Roots
Use partial fraction expansion to find the inverse Laplace transform of
F(s)=768(s2+6s+25)2.
Solution
After factoring the denominator polynomial, we write
F(s)=768(s+3−j4)2(s+3+j4)2≡K1(s+3−j4)2+K2s+3−j4+K1*
(s+3+j4)2+K2*s+3+j4.
Now we need to evaluate only K1 and K2, because K1* and K2* are
conjugate values. We use Method B to find these two partial fraction
coefficients.
The value of K1 is
K1=768(s+3+j4)2|s=−3+j4=768(j8)2=−12.
To find the value of K2, multiply F(s) by (s+3–j4)2, find the first derivative
of the result with respect to s, and evaluate for s=–3+j4:

K2=dds[ 768(s+3+j4)2 ]s=−3+j4=−2(768)(s+3+j4)3|s=−3+j4=−2(768)
(j8)3−j3=3 −90°.
From the values for K1 and K2, K1*=−12, and K2*=j3=3 90°. Group the
partial fraction expansion by conjugate terms to obtain
F(s)=[ −12(s+3−j4)2+−12(s+3+j4)2
]                          + [3 ∠ −90°_(s+3−j4) + 3 ∠ 90°_(s+3+j4)].
Inverse-transform F(s) by applying the functional and operational transforms
(Tables 12.1 and 12.2) to the terms in the partial fraction expansion. The
result is f(t)=[−24te−3t cos 4t+6e−3t cos (4t−90°)]u(t).

SELF-CHECK: Also try Chapter Problem 12.43(b).
Note that if F(s) has a real root a of multiplicity r in its denominator, the
partial fraction expansion has a term of the form
K(s+a)r.
The inverse transform of this term is
L−1{K(s+a)r}=Ktr−1e−at(r−1)!u(t). (12.11)

If F(s) has a complex root of α+jβ of multiplicity r in its denominator, the
partial fraction expansion has a conjugate pair of terms in the form
K(s+α−jβ)r+K*(s+α+jβ)r.
The inverse transform of this pair is
ℒ−1{ | K |θ(s+α−jβ)r+| K |−θ(s+α+jβ)r }   =[ 2| K |tr−1(r−1)! e−αt cos (βt+θ)

Equations 12.11 and 12.12 are the key to finding the inverse transform for
any partial fraction expansion with repeated roots. One further note regarding
these two equations: In circuit analysis problems, r is seldom greater than 2.
Therefore, the inverse transform of a rational function can be handled with
four transform pairs. Table 12.3 lists these pairs.

Partial Fraction Expansion:
Improper Rational Functions
An improper rational function can always be written as the sum of a
polynomial and a proper rational function. The polynomial is then inverse-
transformed into impulse functions and derivatives of impulse functions,
while the proper rational function is inverse-transformed by the techniques
outlined in this section.
We illustrate the procedure in Example 12.7.
Example 12.7 Finding the Inverse
Laplace Transform of an Improper
Rational Function
Use partial fraction expansion to find the inverse Laplace transform of
F(s)=s4+13s3+66s2+200s+300s2+9s+20.
Solution
The order of the numerator is 4, while the order of the denominator is 2, so
F(s) is an improper rational function. To write it as the sum of a polynomial
and a proper rational function, divide the denominator into the numerator
until the remainder is a proper rational function. The result is
F(s)=
(s2+9s+20)s2+4s+10                                     s4+13s3+66s2+200s+300=s2+4s+10+

Next, expand the proper rational function into a sum of partial fractions:
30s+100s2+9s+20=30s+100(s+4)(s+5)≡−20s+4+50s+5.
Replace the proper rational function in F(s) with the partial fraction
expansion to get
F(s)=s2+4s+10−20s+4+50s+5.
Using the tables of functional and operational transforms (Tables 12.1 and
12.2) we can now inverse-transform F(s). Hence
f(t)=d2Δ(t)dt2+4dΔ(t)dt+10Δ(t)−(20e−4t−50e−5t) u(t).

12.8 Poles and Zeros of F(s)
The rational function of Eq. 12.7 can also be expressed as the ratio of two
factored polynomials. In other words, we can write F(s) as
F(s)=K(s+z1)(s+z2)⋯(s+zn)(s+p1)(s+p2)⋯(s+pm), (12.13)
where K is the constant an/bm.
The roots of the denominator polynomial, that is, −p1, −p2, −p3, …, −pm, are
called the poles of F(s); they are the values of s at which F(s) becomes
infinitely large. The roots of the numerator polynomial, that is, −z1, −z2, −z3,
…, −zn are called the zeros of F(s); they are the values of s at which F(s)
becomes zero. We can visualize the poles and zeros of F(s) as points on a
complex s plane. In the complex s plane, we use the horizontal axis to plot
the real values of s and the vertical axis to plot the imaginary values of s.
Example 12.8 finds the poles and zeros for two different functions of s and
plots the locations of the poles and zeros on the complex plane.

Find the poles and zeros of F1(s) and plot them on the complex s-plane.
2. Suppose F2(s) is given by
F2(s)=8s2+120s+4002s4+20s3+70s2+100s+48.

Find the poles and zeros of F2(s) and plot them on the complex s-plane.
Solution
1. Begin by factoring out a constant in the numerator and denominator of
F1(s). Then factor the numerator and denominator polynomials. The
result is
F1(s)=40(s3+11s2+55s+125)4(s4+22s3+220s2+1000s)=10(s+5)(s+3-j4)
(s+3+j4)s(s+10)(s+6-j8)(s+6+j8).
The poles of F1(s) are at 0, −10, −6+j8, and −6−j8. The zeros are at −5,
−3+j4, and −3−j4. Figure 12.17 shows the poles and zeros plotted on the
s plane, where X’s represent poles and O’s represent zeros.

(s+4).
The zeros of F2(s) are −5 and −10. The poles of F2(s) are −1, −2, −3, and −4.
They are plotted in the complex s-plane in Fig. 12.18. Note that F2(s) also
has a second-order zero at infinity because for large values of s the function
reduces to 4/s2, and F2(s)=0 when s=∞. In general, F(s) can have either an
rth-order pole or an rth-order zero at infinity. In this text, we are interested in

the poles and zeros located in the finite s plane. Therefore, when we refer to
the poles and zeros of a rational function of s, we are referring to the finite
poles and zeros.

12.9 Initial- and Final-Value
Theorems
The initial- and final-value theorems enable us to determine the behavior of
f(t) at 0 and ∞ from F(s). Hence, we can check the initial and final values of
f(t) to see if they conform to known circuit behavior, before actually finding
the inverse transform of F(s).
The initial-value theorem states that
Initial-Value Theorem
limt→0+f(t)=lims→∞sF(s),(12.14)
and the final-value theorem states that
Final-Value Theorem
limt→∞f(t)=lims→0sF(s).(12.15)
The initial-value theorem assumes that f(t) does not have an impulse function
at the origin. The final-value theorem is valid only if the poles of F(s), except
for a first-order pole at the origin, lie in the left half of the s plane.
To prove Eq. 12.14, we start with the operational transform of the first
derivative:
ℒ{ dfdt }=sF(s)−f(0−)=∫0−∞dfdte−stdt.
Now we take the limit as s→∞:
lims→∞ [sF(s)−f(0−)]=lims→∞∫0−∞dfdte−stdt. (12.16)

Observe that the right-hand side of Eq. 12.16 can be written as
lims→∞ (∫0−0+dfdte0dt+∫0+∞dfdte−stdt).
As s→∞, (df/dt)e−st→0; hence, the second integral vanishes in the limit. The
first integral reduces to f(0+)−f(0−), which is independent of s. Thus, the
right-hand side of Eq. 12.16 becomes
lims→∞∫0−∞dfdte−stdt=f(0+)−f(0−).
Because f(0−) is independent of s, the left-hand side of Eq. 12.16 can be
written as
lims→∞[sF(s)−f(0−)]=lims→0[sF(s)]−f(0−).
Therefore,
lims→∞sF(s)=f(0+)=limt→0+f(t),
which completes the proof of the initial-value theorem.
The proof of the final-value theorem also starts with the operational
transform of the first derivative. Here we take the limit as s→0:
lims→0[sF(s)−f(0−)]=lims→0(∫0−∞dfdte−stdt). (12.17)
The integration is with respect to t and the limit operation is with respect to s,
so the right-hand side of Eq. 12.17 reduces to
lims→0(∫0−∞dfdte−stdt)=∫0−∞dfdtdt.
Because the upper limit on the integral is infinite, this integral may also be
written as a limit process:
∫0−∞dfdt dt=limt→∞∫0−tdfdydy,
where we use y as the symbol of integration to avoid confusion with the
upper limit on the integral. Carrying out the integration on the right-hand side
gives

limt→∞[f(t)−f(0−)]=limt→∞[f(t)]−f(0−).
Substituting this expression into the right-hand side of Eq. 12.17 gives
lims→0[sF(s)]−f(0−)=limt→∞[f(t)]−f(0−).
Since f(0−) cancels, we get
lims→0sF(s)=limt→∞f(t),
which completes the proof of the final value theorem.
The final-value theorem is useful only if f(∞) exists. This condition is true
only if all the poles of F(s), except for a single pole at the origin, lie in the left
half of the s plane.
Example 12.9 applies the initial- and final-value theorems to the s-domain
function from Example 12.2.
Example 12.9 Applying the Initial-
and Final-Value Theorems
Suppose for the circuit in Fig. 12.16, Idc=24 mA, R=400 Ω, L=25 mH, and
C=25 nF. There is no energy stored in the circuit when the switch opens at
t=0. In Example 12.2, we found the Laplace transform of v(t) is
V(s)=96×104s2+105s+16×108.
Use the initial- and final-value theorems to predict the initial and final values
of v(t) and verify that V(s) correctly predicts the values of v(0+) and v(∞)
from the circuit.
Solution

From the initial-value theorem,
lims→∞sV(s)=lims→∞96×104ss2+105s+16×108.
To evaluate the limit on the right-hand side, divide numerator and
denominator by the highest power of s in the denominator, in this case s2,
and find the limit as 1/s→0:
lims→∞96×104ss2+105s+16×108
=lim1/s→096×104(1/s)1+105(1/s)+16×108(1/s)2=01+0+0=0=limt→0v(t)=v(0
Since the problem states that there is no energy stored in the circuit prior to
the switch opening at t=0, we have confirmed that the initial voltage is zero.
Before applying the final-value theorem, find the poles of V(s). They are
−20,000 and −80,000, so both lie in the left-half complex plane, and we can
use the final-value theorem to get
lims→0sV(s)=lims→096×104ss2+105s+16×108=0.
As we expected from the circuit, as t→∞, the final-value theorem gives
v(∞)=0. Thus, V(s) correctly predicts the initial and final values of v(t).

sinusoidal source.

circuit with a 60 Hz sinusoidal
source.
Figure 12.19 Full Alternative Text
We use Laplace methods to determine the complete response of the inductor
current, iL(t). To begin, use KVL to sum the voltage drops around the circuit,
in the clockwise direction:

15iL(t)+0.01diLdt+1100×10−6∫0tiL(x)dx=cos120πt
Using Tables 12.1 and 12.2, we find the Laplace transform of the KVL
equation:
15IL(s)+0.01sIL(s)+104ILs=ss2+(120π)2
Solve this equation for IL(s):
IL(s)=100s2[s2+1500s+106][s2+(120π2)].
Note that the expression for IL has two complex conjugate pairs of poles, so
the partial fraction expansion of IL(s) will have four terms:
IL(s)=K1(s+750−j661.44)+K1*(s+750+j661.44)                  +K2(s−j120π)+K2*
(s+j120π).
Determine the values of K1andK2:
K1=100s2[ s+750s+j661.44 ][ s2+(120π)2 ]|s=
−750+j661.44=0.07357−97.89°,K2=100s2[s2+1500s+106]
[s+j120π]|s=j120π=0.01834556.61°.
Therefore, the s-domain expression for the inductor current is
IL=0.07357−97.89°(s+750−j661.44)+0.0735797.89°
(s+750+j661.44)                     +0.01834556.61°(s−j120π)+0.018345−56.61°
(s+j120π).
Finally, we use Table 12.3 to calculate the inverse Laplace transform and find
iL:
iL=147.14e−750t cos (661.44t
−97.89°)                   +36.69 cos (120πt+56.61°) mA.
The first term in the inductor current is the transient response, which will
decay to zero in about 7 ms. The second term in the inductor current is the
steady-state response, which has the same frequency as the 60 Hz sinusoidal
source and will persist as long as this source is connected in the circuit. Note

that the amplitude of the steady-state response is 36.69 mA, which is less
than the 40 mA current rating of the inductor. But the transient response has
an initial amplitude of 147.14 mA, far greater than the 40 mA current rating.
Calculate the value of the inductor current at t=0:
iL(0)=147.14(1) cos(−97.89°)+36.69 cos(56.61°)=−6.21μA.
Clearly, the transient part of the response does not cause the inductor current
to exceed its rating initially. But we need a plot of the complete response to
determine whether or not the current rating is ever exceeded, as shown in Fig.
12.20.
Figure 12.20 Plot of the
inductor current for the circuit
in Fig. 12.19.

Figure 12.20 Full Alternative Text
The plot suggests we check the value of the inductor current at 1 ms:
iL(0.001)=147.14e−0.75 cos (−59.99°)+36.69 cos (78.21°)=42.4 mA

Thus, the current rating is exceeded in the inductor, at least momentarily. If
we determine that we never want to exceed the current rating, we should
reduce the magnitude of the sinusoidal source. This example illustrates the
importance of considering the complete response of a circuit to a sinusoidal
input, even if we are satisfied with the steady-state response.

Summary
The Laplace transform is a tool for converting time-domain equations
into frequency-domain equations, according to the following general
definition:
L{ f(t) }=∫0∞f (t)e−st dt=F(s),
where f(t) is the time-domain expression and F(s) is the frequency-
domain expression. (See page 446.)
The step function Ku(t) describes a function that experiences a
discontinuity from one constant level to another at some point in time. K
is the magnitude of the jump; if K=1, Ku(t) is the unit step function.
(See page 447.)
The impulse function KΔ(t) is defined as
∫−∞∞KΔ(t)dt=K,                   Δ(t)=0, t≠0.
K is the strength of the impulse; if K=1, KΔ(t) is the unit impulse
function. (See page 449.)
A functional transform is the Laplace transform of a specific function.
Important functional transform pairs are summarized in Table 12.1. (See
page 453.)
Operational transforms define the general mathematical properties of
the Laplace transform. Important operational transform pairs are
summarized in Table 12.2. (See page 458.)
In linear lumped-parameter circuits, F(s) is a rational function of s. (See
page 460.)
If F(s) is a proper rational function, the inverse transform is found by a
partial fraction expansion. (See page 461.)

If F(s) is an improper rational function, it can be inverse-transformed by
first expanding it into a sum of a polynomial and a proper rational
function. (See page 469.)
F(s) can be expressed as the ratio of two factored polynomials. The roots
of the denominator are called poles and are plotted as Xs on the complex
s plane. The roots of the numerator are called zeros and are plotted as 0s
on the complex s plane. (See page 470.)
The initial-value theorem states that
limt→0+ f(t)=lims→∞ sF(s).
The theorem assumes that f(t) contains no impulse functions. (See page
472.)
The final-value theorem states that
limt→∞ f(t)=lims→0+ sF(s).
The theorem is valid only if the poles of F(s), except for a first-order
pole at the origin, lie in the left half of the s plane. (See page 472.)
The initial- and final-value theorems allow us to predict the initial and
final values of f(t) from an s-domain expression. (See page 474.)

Chapter Objectives
1. Be able to transform a circuit into the s domain using Laplace
transforms; be sure you understand how to represent the initial
conditions on energy-storage elements in the s domain.
2. Know how to analyze a circuit in the s domain and be able to transform
an s-domain solution back to the time domain.
3. Understand the definition and significance of the transfer function and
be able to calculate the transfer function for a circuit using s-domain
techniques.
4. Know how to use a circuit’s transfer function to calculate the circuit’s
unit impulse response, its unit step response, and its steady-state
response to a sinusoidal input.
The Laplace transform has two characteristics that make it an attractive tool
for circuit analysis.
It transforms a set of linear constant-coefficient differential equations
into a set of linear polynomial equations, which are easier to manipulate
and solve.
It automatically introduces into the polynomial equations the initial
values of the current and voltage variables. Thus, initial conditions are
an inherent part of the transform process. (This contrasts with the
classical approach to the solution of differential equations, in which
initial conditions are considered when the unknown coefficients are
evaluated.)
We begin this chapter by showing how to avoid writing time-domain
integrodifferential equations and transforming them into the s domain. In
Section 13.1, we’ll develop the s-domain circuit models for resistors,
inductors, and capacitors. Then we can transform entire circuits into the s
domain and write the s-domain equations directly. Section 13.2 reviews

Ohm’s and Kirchhoff’s laws for s-domain circuits. After establishing these
fundamentals, we apply the Laplace transform method to a variety of circuit
problems in Section 13.3, using the circuit analysis and simplification tools
first introduced for resistive circuits.
After solving for the circuit response in the s domain, we inverse-transform
back to the time domain, using partial fraction expansion (as demonstrated in
Chapter 12). As before, checking the final time-domain equations in terms of
the initial conditions and final values is an important step in the solution
process.
We introduce a new concept, the transfer function, in Section 13.4. The
transfer function for a circuit is the ratio of the Laplace transform of its output
to the Laplace transform of its input. In Chapters 14 and 15, we’ll use the
transfer function in circuit design, but here we focus on using it for circuit
analysis. We continue this chapter with a look at the role of partial fraction
expansion (Section 13.5) and the convolution integral (Section 13.6) when
using the transfer function in circuit analysis. We conclude with a discussion
of the impulse function in circuit analysis.
Practical Perspective
Surge Suppressors
When using personal computers and other sensitive electronic equipment, we
need to provide protection from voltage surges. These surges can occur
during a lightning storm or just by switching an electrical device on or off. A
commercially available surge suppressor is shown in the accompanying
figure.
How can flipping a switch to turn on a light or turn off a hair dryer cause a
voltage surge? At the end of this chapter, we will answer that question using
Laplace transform techniques to analyze a circuit. We will illustrate how a
voltage surge can be created by switching off a resistive load in a circuit
operating in the sinusoidal steady state.

13.1 Circuit Elements in the s
Domain
A three-step procedure transforms each circuit element into an s-domain
equivalent circuit.
1. Write the time-domain equation relating the terminal voltage to the
terminal current.
2. Laplace transform the time-domain equation to generate an algebraic
relationship between the s-domain current and voltage.
3. Construct a circuit model that satisfies the relationship between the s-
domain current and voltage.
Note the s-domain dimensions: the s-domain voltage dimension is volt-
seconds [V-s], the s-domain current dimension is ampere-seconds [A-s], and
thus the s-domain voltage-to-current ratio dimension is volts per ampere, or
ohms. An impedance in the s domain is measured in ohms, and an admittance
is measured in siemens. We use the passive sign convention in all the
derivations.
A Resistor in the s Domain
We begin with the resistor. From Ohm’s law,
v=Ri.
Because R is a constant, the Laplace transform of Ohm’s law is
V=RI, (13.1)
where
V=L {v} and I=L {i}.

From Eq. 13.1 we see that the s-domain equivalent circuit of a resistor is a
resistance of R ohms that carries a current of I ampere-seconds and has a
terminal voltage of V volt-seconds.
Figure 13.1 shows the time- and frequency-domain circuits of the resistor.
Note that going from the time domain to the frequency domain does not
change the resistance element.

Time domain. (b) Frequency
domain.
 
An Inductor in the s Domain

Figure 13.2 shows an inductor carrying an initial current of I0 amperes. The
time-domain equation relating the terminal voltage to the terminal current is
Figure 13.2 An inductor of L
henrys carrying an initial
current of I0 amperes.
v=Ldidt.
The Laplace transform of the inductor equation gives
V=L[sI−i(0−)]=sLI−LI0. (13.2)
One circuit configuration that satisfies Eq. 13.2 is an impedance of sL ohms
in series with an independent voltage source of LI0 volt-seconds, as shown in
Fig. 13.3. Note that the polarity marks on the voltage source LI0 agree with
the minus sign in Eq. 13.2. Note also that LI0 carries its own algebraic sign;
that is, if the initial value of i is opposite to the reference direction for i, then
I0 has a negative value.

equivalent circuit for an
inductor of L henrys carrying
an initial current of I0
amperes.
Figure 13.3 Full Alternative Text
We can also solve Eq. 13.2 for the current I and then construct the circuit to
satisfy the resulting equation. The current I is given by
I=V+LI0sL=VsL+I0s.

The s-domain equivalent circuit that satisfies this equation is an impedance of
sL ohms in parallel with an independent current source of I0/s ampere-
seconds,
There are two other ways to construct the s domain circuit in Fig. 13.4: (1)
find the Norton equivalent of the circuit shown in Fig. 13.3 or (2) start with
the inductor current as a function of the inductor voltage in the time domain
and then Laplace transform the resulting integral equation. We leave these
two approaches to Problems 13.1 and 13.2.

equivalent circuit for an
inductor of L henrys carrying
an initial current of I0
amperes.
Figure 13.4 Full Alternative Text

If the initial energy stored in the inductor is zero, that is, if I0=0, the s-
domain equivalent circuit is an inductor with an impedance of sL ohms.
Figure 13.5 shows this circuit.

circuit for an inductor when
the initial current is zero.
A Capacitor in the s Domain
A capacitor with initial stored energy also has two s-domain equivalent
circuits. Figure 13.6 shows a capacitor initially charged to V0 volts. The
capacitor current is

farads initially charged to V0

volts.

i=Cdvdt.
Transforming the capacitor equation yields
I=C[sV−v(0−)]=sCV−CV0, (13.3)
so the s-domain current I is the sum of two branch currents. One branch
contains an admittance of sC siemens, and the second branch contains an
independent current source of CV0 ampere-seconds. Figure 13.7 shows this
parallel equivalent circuit.

equivalent circuit for a

To derive the other equivalent circuit for the charged capacitor, solve Eq.
13.3 for V:
V=(1sC)I+V0s.
Figure 13.8 shows the circuit that satisfies the equation for capacitor voltage,
which is a series combination of an impedance and an independent voltage
source.

equivalent circuit for a
capacitor initially charged to

Figure 13.8 Full Alternative Text
In the equivalent circuits shown in Figs. 13.7 and 13.8, V0 carries its own
algebraic sign. In other words, if the polarity of V0 is opposite to the
reference polarity for v, V0 is a negative quantity. If the initial voltage on the
capacitor is zero, both equivalent circuits reduce to an impedance of 1/sC
ohms, as shown in Fig. 13.9.
Figure 13.9 The s-domain
circuit for a capacitor when the
initial voltage is zero.

In Chapter 9 we used the phasor transform to turn a time-domain circuit into
a frequency-domain circuit. In this chapter, we use the s-domain equivalent
circuits, summarized in Table 13.1, to transform a time-domain circuit into
the s domain. When the time-domain circuit contains inductors and capacitors
with initial stored energy, you need to decide whether to use the parallel or
series s-domain equivalent circuit. With a little forethought and some
experience, the best choice is often evident.

Domain Equivalent Circuits


Table 13.1 Full Alternative Text

13.2 Circuit Analysis in the s
Domain
Before presenting a method for using the s-domain equivalent circuits in
analysis, we make some important observations.
If no energy is stored in the inductor or capacitor, the relationship
between the s-domain voltage and current for each passive element is:
Ohm’s law in the s-domain
V=ZI,(13.4)
where Z is the s-domain impedance of the element. Thus, a resistor has
an impedance of R ohms, an inductor has an impedance of sL ohms, and
a capacitor has an impedance of 1/sC ohms. The relationship contained
in Eq. 13.4 also appears in Figs. 13.1(b), 13.5, and 13.9. Equation 13.4 is
known as Ohm’s law in the s domain. The reciprocal of the impedance
is admittance. Therefore, the s-domain admittance of a resistor is 1/R
siemens, an inductor has an admittance of 1/sL siemens, and a capacitor
has an admittance of sC siemens.
The rules for combining impedances and admittances in the s domain
are the same as those for frequency-domain circuits. Thus, series-
parallel simplifications and Δ-to-Y conversions also are applicable to s-
domain analysis.
Kirchhoff’s laws apply to s-domain currents and voltages because an
operational Laplace transform states that the Laplace transform of a sum
of time-domain functions equals the sum of the Laplace transforms of
the individual functions (see Table 12.2). The algebraic sum of the
currents at a node is zero in the time domain, so the algebraic sum of the
Laplace-transformed currents is also zero. A similar statement holds for

the algebraic sum of the Laplace-transformed voltages around a closed
path. The s-domain version of Kirchhoff’s laws is
at every node in a circuit, alg  ∑ I=0 , (13.5)
around every closed path in a circuit, alg  ∑ V=0 . (13.6)
Therefore, because Ohm’s law, KVL, and KCL hold in the s domain, all of
the circuit analysis techniques developed in Chapters 2–4 for resistive circuits
can be used to analyze circuits in the s-domain. These techniques include
combining impedances in series and parallel to find equivalent impedances,
voltage division and current division, the node-voltage method and the mesh-
current method, source transformation, and Thévenin and Norton equivalent
circuits. This leads us to the following step-by-step procedure for using
Laplace transform techniques to analyze circuits.
1. Step 1 determines the initial current in each inductor and the initial
voltage across each capacitor by analyzing the time-domain circuit for
t<0.
2. Step 2 transforms each independent voltage or current source defined by
time-domain functions into the s domain using the functional and
operational transforms in Tables 12.1 and 12.2.
3. Step 3 transforms voltages and currents represented by time-domain
symbols such as v(t) and i(t) into corresponding s-domain symbols such
as V and I.
4. Step 4 transforms any remaining components in the time-domain circuit
into the s domain using the circuits in Table 13.1. When inductors and
capacitors have nonzero initial values, calculated in Step 1, these initial
conditions are represented by independent sources in series or parallel
with the component impedances.
5. Step 5 analyzes the resulting s-domain circuit using the techniques
developed for resistive circuits in Chapters 2–4. The analysis produces
s-domain voltages and currents that should each be represented as a ratio
of two polynomials in s.

6. Step 6 applies the initial- and final-value theorems to the s-domain
functions from Step 5 to check the values of the corresponding time-
domain functions at t=0 and t=∞. Note that it might not be possible to
apply one or both of these theorems, depending on the form of the s-
domain function.
7. Step 7 represents each s-domain voltage and current of interest as a
partial fraction expansion and then uses Table 12.3 to inverse-Laplace-
transform the s-domain voltages and currents back to the time domain.
This analysis method yields the complete response to any circuit whose
voltage and current sources have Laplace transforms. This method represents
the most comprehensive circuit analysis technique presented in this text and
is summarized in Analysis Method 13.1. Example 13.1 applies the first five
steps in Analysis Method 13.1 to a time-domain circuit.
Laplace Transform Method

2. Laplace-transform independent voltage and current functions using
Tables 12.1 and 12.2.

domain symbols.
4. Transform remaining circuit components into the s domain using
Table 13.1.
5. Analyze the s-domain circuit using resistive circuit analysis
techniques; represent the resulting s-domain voltages and currents as
ratios of polynomials in s.
6. Use the initial- and final-value theorems to check the s-domain
voltages and currents.

parallel.
1. Express the admittance of this parallel combination of elements as a
rational function of s.
2. Compute the numerical values of the zeros and poles.
Solution
1. We use Analysis Method 13.1 to transform the three parallel-connected
components from the time domain to the s domain.
1. Step 1: There are no initial conditions for the inductor and
capacitor.
2. Step 2: There are no voltage or current sources.
3. Step 3: There are no symbolic voltages or currents.
4. Step 4: Because there are no initial conditions, each component is
represented by its s-domain impedance:
ZR=500 Ω;ZL=0.016s Ω;ZC=125×10−9s=40×106s Ω.
The s-domain circuit is shown in Fig. 13.10.

2. The numerator factors are (s+40,000+j30,000) and (s+40,000−j30,000).
Therefore the zeros are −40,000+j30,000 and −40,000−j30,000. There is
a pole at 0.

13.3 Applications
We now use Analysis Method 13.1 to find the complete response of several
example circuits. We start with two familiar circuits from Chapters 7 and 8 to
show that the Laplace transform approach yields the same results found using
the first- and second-order circuit analysis techniques. Example 13.2 solves
an RC circuit, and Example 13.3 solves an RLC circuit.
Example 13.2 The Natural Response
of an RC Circuit
The circuit in Fig. 13.11 was analyzed in Example 7.3 using first-order circuit
analysis techniques. Use the Laplace transform method to find vo(t) for t≥0+.
Figure 13.11 The RC circuit for
Example 13.2.
Figure 13.11 Full Alternative Text

Solution
Apply the Laplace transform method using Analysis Method 13.1.
1. Step 1: Determine the initial voltage across the capacitor by analyzing
the circuit in Fig. 13.11 for t<0. Because the switch has been in position
x for a long time, the capacitor behaves like an open circuit. The voltage
across the open circuit V0=100 V.
2. Step 2: For t≥0, there are no voltage or current sources in the circuit, so
we can skip this step.
3. Step 3: The voltage across the 240 kΩ resistor is represented in the s
domain as V, as shown in Fig. 13.12.
4. Step 4: The impedance of the three resistors is their resistance. The
impedance of the capacitor is
ZC=1sC=10.5×10−6s=2×106sΩ.
Because the capacitor has an initial condition, we must decide whether
to represent it using a series-connected voltage source or a parallel-
connected current source, as shown in Table 13.1. Here we use the
series-connected voltage source, whose value is V0/s=100/s V-s. The s-
domain circuit that results from Steps 1–4 is shown in Fig. 13.12.
Figure 13.12 The circuit in
Fig. 13.11 for t≥0

domain.

Figure 13.12 Full Alternative Text
5. Step 5: Begin by combining the parallel-connected 240 kΩ and 60 kΩ
resistors into a single equivalent 48 kΩ resistor whose voltage is Vo.
Now use voltage division to find Vo:
Vo=48,000(2×106/s)+32,000+48,000(100s)=60s+25.
6. Step 6: Use the initial- and final-value theorems to show that the initial
value of vo is 60 V and final value of vo is zero, as we expect from the
circuit in Fig. 13.11.
lims→∞sVo=lims→∞60ss+25=lim(1/s)→0601+
(25/s)=601+0=60=limt→0vo(t);lims→0sVo=lims→060ss+25=60(0)0+2
7. Step 7: Since Vo is already a partial fraction, we can use the transforms
in Table 12.3 to find vo:
vo(t)=L−1{60s+25}=60e−25tu(t)V.
This matches the voltage found in Example 7.3 using first-order circuit
analysis methods.

Example 13.3 The Step Response of
an RLC Circuit
Consider the circuit in Fig. 13.13, where the initial current in the inductor is
29 mA and the initial voltage across the capacitor is 50 V. This circuit was
analyzed in Example 8.10 using second-order circuit analysis techniques. Use
the Laplace transform method to find v(t) for t≥0.
Figure 13.13 The parallel RLC
circuit for Example 13.3.
Figure 13.13 Full Alternative Text
Solution
Apply the Laplace transform method using Analysis Method 13.1.
1. Step 1: Both initial conditions are given in the problem statement, so we
can skip this step.
2. Step 2: We can describe the parallel combination of the current source
and the switch in Fig. 13.13 as 24u(t) mA. The Laplace transform of this
function is 24/s mA-s, which is the current source value in the s-domain

circuit in Fig. 13.14.
3. Step 3: The voltage across the 240 kΩ resistor is represented in the s
domain as V, as shown in Fig. 13.12.
4. Step 4: The impedance of the resistor is its resistance. The impedance of
the inductor is
ZL=sL=0.025s=s40Ω
and the impedance of the capacitor is
ZC=1sC=125×10−9s=40×106sΩ.
Both the inductor and capacitor have nonzero initial conditions. We
must decide whether to represent them as series-connected voltage
sources or as parallel-connected current sources, as shown in Table 13.1.
Here we use parallel-connected current sources because the resulting
circuit has only parallel-connected components. The value of the current
source in parallel with the inductor is I0/s=0.029/s A-s, with the current
arrow directed down. The value of the current source in parallel with the
capacitor is C V 0 =(50)(25× 10 −9 )=1.25 μ V-s with the current arrow
directed up. The s-domain circuit that results from Steps 1–4 is shown in
Fig. 13.14.

5. Step 5: Begin by combining the three parallel-connected impedances
into a single equivalent impedance:
Zeq=(s40×106+40s+1500)−1=40×106ss2+80,000s+16×108Ω.
To find the voltage across this equivalent impedance, multiply by the
sum of the three parallel-connected currents:
V=Zeq(0.024s+1.25×10−6−0.029s)=50s−20×104s2+80,000s+16×108V-
s.
6. Step 6: Use the initial and final value theorems to predict the initial and
final values of v:
lims→∞sV=lims→∞50s2−20×104ss2+80,000s+16×108=lim(1/s)→050−
(0)16×108=0=limt→∞v(t).
The initial-value theorem predicts the correct initial voltage from the
problem statement, V0=50 V. To confirm the final value of the voltage,
envision the circuit in Fig. 13.13 as t→∞. The inductor is behaving like
a short circuit, and the capacitor is behaving like an open circuit in
parallel with the short circuit. Therefore, the final value of capacitor
voltage in the circuit is zero, as predicted by the final-value theorem.
7. Step 7: The partial fraction expansion of V is
V=50s−20×104(s+40,000)2=−2.2×106(s+40,000)2+50(s+40,000).

Now use the transforms in Table 12.3 to find v:
v(t)=L−1{ −2.2×106(s+40,000)2+50(s+40,000) }=(−2.2×106te
−40,000t+50e−40,000t)u(t)V.
This matches the voltage found in Example 8.10 using second-order

Next, we analyze a circuit with a sinusoidal source using Laplace methods.
Phasor methods, presented in Chapter 9, were used to analyze circuits with
sinusoidal sources but have an important limitation—they only produce the
steady-state response of the circuit, not the complete response. Recall that the
complete response consists of both the steady-state and the transient
response. Laplace methods do not have this limitation, so they produce a
circuit’s complete response to a sinusoidal source, as seen in Example 13.4.
Example 13.4 Analyzing a Circuit
with a Sinusoidal Source
The circuit in Fig. 13.15 has no initial stored energy. At t=0, the switch closes
and the circuit is driven by a sinusoidal source v(t)=15 cos 40,000t V. Use
Laplace methods to find i(t) for t≥0.
Figure 13.15 The circuit for
Example 13.4.

Figure 13.15 Full Alternative Text
Solution
Apply the Laplace transform method using Analysis Method 13.1.
1. Step 1: There is no initial stored energy, so both initial conditions are
zero.
2. Step 2: Using the functional and operational transform tables (Tables
12.1 and 12.2), we see that the Laplace transform of v(t) is
V=L{15 cos 40,000t}=15ss2+40,0002V-s.
This is the value of the voltage source for the s-domain circuit in Fig.
13.16.

3. Step 3: The current is represented in the s domain as I, as shown in Fig.
13.16.
4. Step 4: The impedance of the resistor is its resistance. The impedance of
the inductor is
ZL=sL=0.0625s=s16Ω
and the impedance of the capacitor is
ZC=1sC=110×10−9s=108s Ω.
The s-domain circuit that results from Steps 1–4 is shown in Fig. 13.16.

5. Step 5: To find the current I, divide the source voltage by the sum of the
impedances:
I=15ss2+40,00024000+108s+s16=240s2(s2+40,0002)
(s2+64,000s+16×108)A-s.
6. Step 6: Use the initial value theorem to predict the initial value of i:
lim x→∞ sI= lim s→ ∞ 240 S 3 ( S 2 +40, 000 2 )( s 2 +64,000s+16× 10
8 ) = lim (1/s)→0 240( 1 s ) [ 1+ ( 40,000 s ) 2 ][ 1+( 60,000 s )+( 16× 10
8 s 2 ) ] = 0 ( 1 )( 1 ) =0= lim t→0 i(t).
The initial-value theorem predicts correctly that the initial current is
zero. We cannot use the final-value theorem to predict the final current
because I has two poles on the imaginary axis at ±j40,000 rad/s.
7. Step 7: The partial fraction expansion of I is
I=240s2(s2+40,0002)(s2+64,000s+16×108)=K1s

−j40,000+K1*s+j40,000+K2s+32,000−j24,000+K2*s+32,000+j24,000.
Finding K1 and K2,
K1=240s2(s+j40,000)
(s2+64,000s+16×108)|s=j40,000=1.875×10−3;K2=240s2(s2+40,0002)
(s+32,000+j24000)|s=−32,000+j40,000=3.125×10−3−126.87°.
Now use the transforms in Table 12.3 to find v:
i(t)=L−1{ 1.875×10−3s
−j40,000+1.875×10−3s+j40,000+3.125×10−3−126.87°s+32,000−j24,000
}=[ 3.75 cos 40,000t+6.25e−32,000t cos(24,000t−126.87°) ]u(t)mA.
The first term in the expression for i(t) is the steady-state response. Its
frequency matches the frequency of the source, and this term persists for
all time. You should use the phasor methods from Chapter 9 to verify
this result. The second term in the expression for i(t) is the transient
response, or the natural response. Note that it decays to zero as t→∞.
This part of the response is independent of the voltage source and is
based only on the passive component values and their interconnections.

Until now, we avoided analyzing circuits with inductors and capacitors that
have two or more meshes, or three or more essential nodes. Such circuits are
described by two or more simultaneous differential equations, and the
techniques for solving these systems of equations are beyond the scope of
this text. However, using Laplace techniques, we can transform a circuit into
the s domain and write a set of simultaneous algebraic equations, whose
solution is much more manageable. Example 13.5 illustrates this by solving a
circuit with two meshes.

Solution
Apply the Laplace transform method using Analysis Method 13.1.
1. Step 1: There is no initial stored energy, so both initial conditions are
zero.
2. Step 2: The series connection of the 336 V dc voltage source and the
switch can be described in the time domain as 336u(t) V. Using the
functional and operational transform tables (Tables 12.1 and 12.2), the
Laplace transform of this voltage is
L{336u(t)}=336sV-s.
This is the value of the voltage source for the s-domain circuit in Fig.
13.18.
3. Step 3: The currents are represented in the s domain as I1 and I2, as
shown in Fig. 13.18.
4. Step 4: The impedance of the resistors is their resistance. The impedance

of the inductors is
ZL1=sL1=8.4s Ω;ZL2=sL2=10s Ω.
The s-domain circuit that results from Steps 1–4 is shown in Fig. 13.18.

5. Step 5: The two KVL equations are
336s=(42+8.4s)I1−42I2,0=−42I1+(90+10s)I2.
Using Cramer’s method, we get

Δ=| 42+8.4s−42−4290+10s |=84(s2+14s+24)=84(s+2)(s+12),N1=| 336/s
−42090+10s |=3360(s+9)s,N2=| 42+8.4s336/s−420 |=14,112s.
Therefore,
I1=N1Δ=40(s+9)s(s+2)(s+12),I2=N2Δ=168s(s+2)(s+12).
6. Step 6: Use the initial-value theorem to predict the initial values of i1
and i2:
lims→∞sI1=lims→∞40(s+9)(s+2)(s+12)=lim(1/s)→040[ (1/s)+9(1/s)2 ]
(1+(2/s))(1+(12/s))=0(1)
(1)=0=limt→0i1(t);lims→∞sI2=lims→∞168(s+2)
(s+12)=lim(1/s)→0168(1/s)2(1+(2/s))(1+(12/s))=0(1)(1)=0=limt→0i2(t)
The initial-value theorem predicts correctly that the initial currents are
zero. Now use the final-value theorem to predict the values of i1 and i2
as t→∞:
lims→0sI1=lims→040(s+9)(s+2)(s+12)=40(9)(2)
(12)=15A=limt→∞i1(t);lims→0sI2=lims→0168(s+2)(s+12)=168(2)
(12)=7A=limt→∞i2(t).
To verify these values, consider the circuit in Fig. 13.16 as t→∞. The
inductors now behave like short circuits, as shown in Fig. 13.19.

Fig 13.17 as t→∞

The two KVL equations that describe this circuit are
42i1f−42i2f=336;−42i1f+90i2f=0.
Solving, we find the final value of i1 is 15 A and the final value of i2 is
7 A, as predicted by the final value theorem.
7. Step 7: Expanding I1 and I2 into a sum of partial fractions gives
I1=15s−14s+2−1s+12,I2=7s−8.4s+2+1.4s+12.
We obtain the expressions for i1 and i2 by inverse- transforming I1 and
I2, using Table 12.3:
i1=(15−14e−2t−e−12t)u(t) A,i2=(7−8.4e−2t+1.4e−12t)u(t) A.
One final test involves calculating the voltage drop across the 42 Ω
resistor using three different methods. From the circuit, the voltage
across the 42 Ω resistor (positive at the top) is
v=42(i1−i2)=336−8.4di1dt=48i2+10di2dt.

You should verify that regardless of which expression is used, the
voltage is
v=(336−235.2e−2t−100.80e−12t)u(t)V.
We are thus confident that the solutions for i1 and i2 are correct.

Solution
Apply the Laplace transform method using Analysis Method 13.1.
1. Step 1: There is no initial stored energy, so both initial conditions are
zero.
2. Step 2: The series connection of the 480 V dc voltage source and the
switch can be described in the time domain as 480u(t) V. Using the
functional and operational transform tables (Tables 12.1 and 12.2), the
Laplace transform of this voltage is
L{480u(t)}=480sV-s.
This is the value of the voltage source for the s-domain circuit in Fig.
13.21.
3. Step 3: The capacitor current and voltage are represented in the s domain
as IC and VC, as shown in Fig. 13.21.

4. Step 4: The impedance of the resistors is their resistance. The
impedances of the inductor and capacitor are
ZL=sL=0.002s=s500Ω;ZC=1sC=15×10−6s=2×105sΩ.
The s-domain circuit that results from Steps 1–4 is shown in Fig. 13.21.

5. Step 5: The Thévenin voltage is the open-circuit voltage across
terminals a and b. Under open-circuit conditions, there is no voltage
across the 60 Ω resistor. Using voltage division,
VTh=(480/s)(0.002s)20+0.002s=480s+104.
The Thévenin impedance seen from terminals a and b equals the 60 Ω
resistor in series with the parallel combination of the 20 Ω resistor and

the inductive impedance. Thus
ZTh=60+0.002s(20)20+0.002s=80(s+7500)s+104.
Using the Thévenin equivalent, we reduce the circuit shown in Fig.
13.21 to the one shown in Fig. 13.22.
Figure 13.22 A simplified
version of the circuit shown
in Fig. 13.21, using a
Thévenin equivalent.

In this circuit, the capacitor current IC equals the Thévenin voltage
divided by the total series impedance. Thus,
IC=480s+10480(s+7500)s+104+2×105s=6s(s+5000)2.
6. Step 6: Use the initial- and final-value theorems to predict the initial and

final values of iC:
lims→∞sIC=lims→∞6s2(s+5000)2=lim(1/s)→06(1+
(5000/s))2=6(1)2=6A=limt→0iC(t);lims→0sIC=lims→06s2(s+5000)2=0
Let’s calculate the initial capacitor current from the circuit in Fig. 13.20.
The initial inductor current is zero and the initial capacitor voltage is
zero, so the initial capacitor current is 480/(20+60) or 6 A, which agrees
with the prediction of the initial-value theorem. The final value of the
capacitor current is zero because as t→∞ in the circuit shown in Fig.
13.20, the capacitor behaves like an open circuit. This final capacitor
current also agrees with the prediction of the final-value theorem.
7. Step 7: The partial fraction expansion of IC is
IC=−30,000(s+5000)2+6s+5000,
and its inverse transform is
iC=(−30,000te−5000t+6e−5000t)u(t) A.
Suppose we also want to find the voltage drop across the capacitor, vC.
Once we know iC, we could find vC by integration in the time domain:
vC=2×105∫0−t(6−30,000x)e−5000x dx.
Although the integration is not difficult, we can avoid it altogether by
first finding the s-domain expression for Vc and then using the inverse
transform to find vC. Thus
VC=1sCIC=2×105s6s(s+5000)2=12×105(s+500)2,
and
vC=12×105te−5000tu(t) V.

Solution
Apply the Laplace transform method using Analysis Method 13.1.
1. Step 1: Because the switch has been in position a for a long time, both
inductors behave like short circuits. The current in the 2 H inductor is

i1(0−)=5 A and i2(0−)=0.

2. Step 2: For t≥0, there is no independent source in the circuit, so we can
skip this step.
3. Step 3: The currents in the two coils are represented in the s domain as
I1 and I2.

we replace the magnetically coupled coils with a T-equivalent circuit.1

Solving for I2 yields
I2=2.5(s+1)(s+3).
6. Step 6: Use the initial- and final-value theorems to predict the initial and
final values of i2:
lims→∞sI2=lims→∞2.5s(s+1)(s+3)=lim(1/s)→02.5(1/s)(1+(1/s))(1+

(3)=0=limt→∞i2(t).
The initial- and final-value theorems correctly predict the initial and
final values of the current i2 for the circuit in Fig. 13.23.
7. Step 7: The partial fraction expansion of I2 is
I2=1.25s+1−1.25s+3.
Using Table 12.3, the inverse Laplace transform of I2 is
i2=(1.25e−t−1.25e−3t)u(t) A.
Figure 13.26 shows a plot of i2 versus t. This response makes sense in
terms of the known physical behavior of the magnetically coupled coils.
A current can exist in the L2 inductor only if there is a time-varying
current in the L1 inductor. As i1 decreases from its initial value of 5 A,
i2 increases from zero and then approaches zero as i1 approaches zero.

13.4 The Transfer Function
The transfer function is defined as the s-domain ratio of the Laplace
transform of the output (response) to the Laplace transform of the input
(source). As we will see, the transfer function characterizes a circuit’s
behavior in a single s-domain expression, without revealing what components
make up the circuit or how those components are interconnected. In
computing the transfer function, we only consider circuits where all initial
conditions are zero. If a circuit has multiple independent sources, we can find
the transfer function for each source and use superposition to find the
response to all sources.
The transfer function is
Definition of a Transfer Function
H(s)=Y(s)X(s),(13.7)
where Y(s) is the Laplace transform of the output signal, and X(s) is the
Laplace transform of the input signal. Note that the transfer function depends
on what is defined as the output signal. Consider, for example, the series
circuit shown in Fig. 13.30. If the current is defined as the output signal of
the circuit,
Figure 13.30 A series RLC
circuit.

Figure 13.30 Full Alternative Text
H(s)=IVg=1R+sL+1/sC=sCs2LC+RCs+1.
In deriving H(s), we recognized that I corresponds to the output Y(s) and Vg
corresponds to the input X(s).
If, instead, the capacitor voltage is defined as the output signal of the circuit
shown in Fig. 13.30, then the transfer function is
H(s)=VVg=1/sCR+sL+1/sC=1s2LC+RCs+1.
Thus, because circuits may have multiple sources and because the definition
of the output signal of interest can vary, a single circuit can generate many
transfer functions. Remember that when multiple sources are involved, no
single transfer function can represent the total output; transfer functions
associated with each source must be combined using superposition to yield
the total response. Example 13.9 illustrates the computation of a transfer
function for known numerical values of R, L, and C.

Solution
1. Use Analysis Method 13.1 to construct and analyze the s-domain circuit.

1. Step 1: The circuit in Fig. 13.31 has no initial stored energy, an
assumption we always make when calculating a circuit’s transfer
function. Therefore, we can skip this step.
2. Step 2: There are no independent sources described by a time-
domain function in this circuit, so we can skip this step.
3. Step 3: Represent the source and output voltages using Vg and Vo,
respectively, as shown in Fig. 13.32.
4. Step 4: The impedance of the resistors is their resistance. The
impedances of the inductor and capacitor are
ZL=sL=0.05s Ω;ZC=1sC=1s(10−6)=106s Ω.
The s-domain circuit resulting from Steps 1–4 is shown in Fig.
13.32.

equivalent circuit for the
circuit shown in Fig. 13.31.

Figure 13.32 Full Alternative Text
5. Step 5: From the problem statement, the transfer function is the
ratio of Vo/Vg. Writing a node-voltage equation at the upper node
and summing the currents leaving the node gives
Vo−Vg1000 + Vo250 + 0.05s=Vos106=0.
Solving for Vo yields
Vo=1000(s + 5000)Vgs2 + 6000s + 25 × 106.
Hence, the transfer function is
H(s)=VoVg=1000(s+5000)s2+6000s+25×106.
2. The poles of H(s) are the roots of the denominator polynomial.
Therefore
−p1=−3000−j4000,
−p2=−3000+j4000.
The zeros of H(s) are the roots of the numerator polynomial; thus, H(s)

The Location of Poles and Zeros of H(s)
For linear lumped-parameter circuits, H(s) is always a rational function of s.
Complex poles and zeros always occur in conjugate pairs. The poles of H(s)
must lie in the left half of the s plane if the response to a bounded source (one
whose values lie within some finite bounds) is to be bounded. The zeros of
H(s) may lie in either the right half or the left half of the s plane.
With these general characteristics in mind, we next discuss the role that H(s)
plays in determining the circuit’s output.

13.5 The Transfer Function in
Partial Fraction Expansions
Using the definition of a circuit’s transfer function (Eq. 13.7), we can find the
circuit’s output by multiplying the transfer function and the circuit’s input:
Y(s)=H(s)X(s). (13.8)
We have already noted that H(s) is a rational function of s; X(s) also is a
rational function of s for the time-domain functions of most interest in circuit
analysis (see Table 12.1).
Expanding the right-hand side of Eq. 13.8 into a sum of partial fractions
produces a term for each pole of H(s) and X(s). The terms generated by the
poles of H(s) correspond to the transient components of the total response.
The terms generated by the poles of X(s) correspond to the steady-state
components of the response, which exist after the transient components have
become negligible. Example 13.10 illustrates these general observations.
Example 13.10 Analyzing the
Transfer Function of a Circuit
The circuit in Example 13.9 (Fig. 13.31) is driven by a voltage source whose
voltage increases linearly with time, namely, vg=50tu(t) V.
1. Use the transfer function to find vo.
2. Identify the transient component of the response.
3. Identify the steady-state component of the response.
4. Sketch vo versus t for 0≤t≤1.5 ms.

Solution
1. From Example 13.9,
H(s)=1000(s+5000)s2+6000s+25×106.
The Laplace transform of the source voltage is 50/s2; therefore, the s-
domain expression for the output voltage is
Vo=1000(s+5000)(s2+6000s+25×106) 50s2.
The partial fraction expansion of Vo is
Vo=K1s+3000−j4000          + K1*s+3000+j4000+K2s2+K3s.
We evaluate the coefficients K1,K2, and K3 by using the techniques
described in Section 12.7:
K1=55 × 10−4  79.70°;K1*=55 × 10−4  −79.70°,K2=10,K3=−4×10−4.
Using Table 12.3, the time-domain expression for vo is
vo=[105×10−4e−3000tcos (4000t+79.70°)+10t−4×10−4]u(t)V.
2. The transient component of vo is
105×10−4e−3000t cos (4000t + 79.70°).
Note that this term is generated by the poles (−3000+j4000) and
(−3000−j4000) of the transfer function.
3. The steady-state component of the response is
(10t−4×10−4)u(t) V.
These two terms are generated by the second-order pole (K/s2) of the
input voltage.

4. Figure 13.33 shows a sketch of vo versus t. Note that the deviation from
the steady-state solution 10,000t−0.4mV is imperceptible after
approximately 1 ms.

Observations on the Use of H(s) in Circuit Analysis
Example 13.10 related the components that make up a circuit’s response to
the poles of the transfer function, H(s), and the poles of the circuit’s input in
the s domain, using a partial fraction expansion. However, the example raises
questions about driving a circuit with an increasing ramp voltage that
generates an increasing ramp response. Eventually, excessive voltage will
cause the circuit components to fail, and then our linear model is invalid. But
some practical applications have input ramp functions that increase to some
maximum value over a finite time interval, so the response to a ramp input is
important. If the time it takes for the ramp to reach its maximum value is long
compared with the time constants of the circuit, the solution assuming an
unbounded ramp is valid for this finite time interval.
Here are some additional observations about a circuit’s transfer function,
defined in Eq. 13.7.
If the circuit’s input is delayed by a seconds,
L{x(t−a)u(t−a)}=e−asX(s),
then from Eq. 13.8, the circuit’s output is
Y(s)=H(s)X(s)e−as.
If y(t)=L−1{H(s)X(s)}, then,
y(t−a)u(t−a)=L−1{H(s)X(s)e−as}.
Therefore, delaying the input by a seconds delays the output by a
seconds. A circuit that exhibits this characteristic is time invariant.
If the circuit’s input is a unit impulse, the circuit’s output equals the
inverse transform of the transfer function. Thus, if
x(t)=δ(t), thenX(s)=1

and
Y(s)=H(s).
Hence,
y(t)=h(t),
so the inverse transform of the transfer function equals the unit impulse
response of the circuit.
A circuit’s unit impulse response is also its natural response because
applying an impulsive source is equivalent to instantaneously storing
energy in the circuit (see Section 13.8). The subsequent release of this
stored energy is the circuit’s natural response (see Problem 13.84).
A circuit’s unit impulse response, h(t), contains enough information to
compute the response to any source that drives the circuit. We can
extract a circuit’s response to an arbitrary source from the circuit’s unit
impulse response, using the convolution integral. This technique is
demonstrated in the next section.

13.6 The Transfer Function and the
Convolution Integral
The convolution integral relates the output y(t) of a linear time-invariant
circuit to the input x(t) of the circuit and the circuit’s impulse response h(t).
The integral relationship can be expressed in two ways:
Convolution Integral
y(t)=∫−∞∞h(λ)x(t−λ) dλ=∫−∞∞h(t−λ)x(λ) dλ.(13.9)
We are interested in the convolution integral for several reasons.
We can find a circuit’s output for any input by working entirely in the
time domain. This is beneficial when x(t) and h(t) are known only
through experimental data. In such cases, using Laplace transform
methods may be awkward or even impossible, as we would need to
compute the Laplace transform of experimental data.
The convolution integral introduces the concepts of memory and the
weighting function into analysis. The concept of memory enables us to
predict, to some degree, how closely the output waveform replicates the
input waveform, using the impulse response (or the weighting function)
h(t).
The convolution integral provides a formal procedure for finding the
inverse transform of products of Laplace transforms.
To derive Eq. 13.9, we assume that the circuit is linear and time invariant.
Because the circuit is linear, the principle of superposition is valid, and
because it is time invariant, the response delay and the input delay are the
same. Consider Fig. 13.34, in which the block containing h(t) represents any
linear time-invariant circuit whose impulse response is known, x(t) represents

the input signal and y(t) represents the output signal. We also assume the
following:

of a general circuit.

x(t) is the general signal shown in Fig. 13.35(a).

Approximating x(t) with a

Figure 13.35 Full Alternative Text
x(t)=0 for t<0−. Once we derive the convolution integral assuming
x(t)=0 for t<0−, extending the integral to include excitation functions
that exist for all time is straightforward.
A discontinuity in x(t) at the origin (between 0− and 0+) is permitted.
Begin by approximating x(t) with a series of rectangular pulses of uniform
width Δλ, as shown in Fig. 13.35(b). Thus
x(t)=x0(t)+x1(t)+⋯+xi(t)+⋯,
where xi(t) is a rectangular pulse that equals x(λi) between λi and λi+1 and is
zero elsewhere. Note that the ith pulse can be expressed using step functions;
that is,
xi(t)=x(λi){u(t−λi)−u[t−(λi+Δλ)]}.

Continue to approximate x(t) by making the pulse width Δλ so small that we
can approximate the ith component using an impulse function of strength
x(λi)Δλ. Figure 13.35(c) shows this impulse representation, where the
brackets beside each arrow represent the impulse strength. The impulse
representation of x(t) is
x(t)=x(λ0)Δλδ(t−λ0)+x(λ1)Δλδ(t−λ1)+⋯                    +x(λi)Δλδ(t−λi)+⋯
.
When we represent x(t) with a series of impulse functions (which occur at
equally spaced intervals of time, that is, at λ0, λ1, λ2, …), the output function
y(t) is the sum of uniformly delayed impulse responses. The strength of each
response depends on the strength of the impulse driving the circuit. For
example, let’s assume that the unit impulse response of the circuit represented
by the box in Fig. 13.34 is the exponential decay function shown in Fig.
13.36(a). Then the approximation of y(t) is the sum of the impulse responses
shown in Fig. 13.36(b).

approximation of y(t). (a) The
impulse response of the box
shown in Fig. 13.34. (b)
Summing the impulse
responses.

Figure 13.36 Full Alternative Text

Analytically, the expression for y(t) is
y(t)=x(λ0)Δλh(t−λ0)+x(λ1)Δλh(t−λ1)+x(λ2)Δλh(t−λ2)+⋯+x(λi)Δλh(t−λi)+⋯
.
As Δλ→0, the sum approaches a continuous integral, or
∑i=∞∞x(λi)h(t−λi)Δλ→∫0∞x(λ)h(t−λ) dλ.
Therefore,
y(t)=∫0∞x(λ)h(t−λ) dλ.
If x(t) exists over all time, then the lower limit on the integral is −∞. Thus, in
general,
y(t)=∫−∞∞x(λ)h(t−λ) dλ,
which is the second form of the convolution integral given in Eq. 13.9.
To derive the first form of the integral in Eq. 13.9, we change the variable of
integration in the second form of the integral. Let u=t−λ, and then du=−dλ,
u=−∞ when λ=∞, and u=+∞ when λ=−∞. Now we can write
y(t)=∫∞−∞x(t−u)h(u)(−du),
or
y(t)=∫−∞∞x(t−u)h(u)(du).
Since u is a symbol of integration, this integral is equivalent to the first form
of the convolution integral, Eq. 13.9.
The convolution integral relating y(t), h(t), and x(t), (Eq. 13.9), is often
written using a shorthand notation:
y(t)=h(t)*x(t)=x(t)*h(t), (13.10)
where the asterisk represents the integral relationship between h(t) and x(t).

Thus, h(t)*x(t) is read as “h(t) is convolved with x(t)” and implies that
h(t)*x(t)=∫−∞∞h(λ)x(t−λ) dλ,
whereas x(t)*h(t) is read as “x(t) is convolved with h(t)” and implies that
x(t)*h(t)=∫−∞∞x(λ)h(t−λ) dλ.
The integrals in Eq. 13.9 give the most general relationship for the
convolution of two functions. However, when we apply the convolution
integral, we can change the lower limit to zero and the upper limit to t. Then
we can write Eq. 13.9 as
y(t)=∫0th(λ)x(t−λ) dλ=∫0tx(λ)h(t−λ) dλ.
We change the limits for two reasons. First, for physically realizable circuits,
h(t) is zero for t<0 because there is no impulse response before you apply an
impulse. Second, we start measuring time at the instant we turn on the input
x(t); therefore x(t)=0 for t<0−.
A graphic interpretation of the convolution integrals (Eq. 13.9) helps us use
convolution as a computational tool. We begin with the first integral and
assume that the circuit’s impulse response is the exponential decay function
shown in Fig. 13.37(a) and its input function has the waveform shown in Fig.
13.37(b). In each of the plots, we replace t with λ, the symbol of integration.
Replacing λ with −λ folds the excitation function over the vertical axis, as
shown in Fig 13.37(d). The folding operation explains why Eq. 13.9 is called
the convolution integral. Replacing −λ with t−λ slides the folded function to
the right, as shown in Fig. 13.37(d).

At any specified value of t, the output function y(t) is the area under the
product function h(λ)x(t−λ), as shown in Fig. 13.37(e). This plot explains
why we can set the lower limit on the convolution integral to zero and the
upper limit to t. For λ<0, the product h(λ)x(t−λ) is zero because h(λ) is zero.
For λ>t, the product h(λ)x(t−λ) is zero because x(t−λ) is zero.
Figure 13.38 shows the second form of the convolution integral. Once again,
the product function in Fig. 13.38(e) explains why we use zero for the lower
limit and t for the upper limit.

1. Begin by finding the unit impulse response of the circuit. The s-domain
equivalent of the circuit in Fig. 13.39(a) replaces the inductor with an
impedance of s Ω and the two voltages with Vo and Vi. Using voltage
division,
Vo=1s+1Vi.
When vi is a unit impulse function δ(t), Vi=1 and H(s)=Vo/ Vi=1/(s+1).
Then,
vo=h(t)=e−tu(t),
from which

h(λ)=e−λu(λ).
Using the first form of the convolution integral in Eq. 13.9, we construct
the impulse response and folded input function shown in Fig. 13.40,
which helps us select the convolution integral limits. As we slide the
folded input function to the right, we break the integration into three
intervals: 0≤t≤5; 5≤t≤10; and 10≤t≤∞. The integration intervals
correspond to points where the input function’s definition changes.

interval.

We mentioned at the beginning of this section that the convolution integral
introduces the concepts of memory and the weighting function into circuit
analysis. The graphical interpretation of the convolution integral is the easiest
way to understand these concepts. We can view the folding and sliding of a
circuit’s input function on a time scale divided into past, present, and future
time intervals. The vertical axis represents the present value of x(t), with past
values to the right of the vertical axis and future values to the left. Figure
13.43 shows this description of x(t), using the input function from Example
13.11.
Figure 13.43 The past, present,
and future values of the input
function.

Figure 13.43 Full Alternative Text
When we combine the past, present, and future views of x(t−τ) with the
impulse response of the circuit, we see that the impulse response weights x(t)
according to present and past values. For example, Fig. 13.41 shows that the
impulse response in Example 13.11 gives less weight to past values of x(t)
than to the present value of x(t). In other words, the circuit “remembers” less
and less about past input values. Therefore, in Fig. 13.42, vo quickly
approaches zero when the present value of the input is zero (that is, when
t>10 s). Since the present value of the input receives more weight than the
past values, the output quickly approaches the present value of the input.
Because the convolution integral uses the product of x(t−λ) and h(λ), the
impulse response is considered the circuit’s weighting function. The
weighting function, in turn, determines how much memory the circuit has.
Memory represents how accurately the circuit’s response matches its input.
For example, if the impulse response, or weighting function, is flat, as shown
in Fig. 13.44(a), it gives equal weight to all values of x(t), past and present.
Such a circuit has a perfect memory. However, if the impulse response is an

impulse function, as shown in Fig. 13.44(b), it gives no weight to past values
of x(t) and the circuit has no memory.

functions. (a) Perfect memory.
(b) No memory.


Figure 13.44 Full Alternative Text
The more memory a circuit has, the more distortion exists between the
circuit’s input waveform and its output. We can demonstrate this by
assuming that the circuit has no memory, that is, h(t)=Aδ(t), and then noting
from the convolution integral that
y(t) = ∫ 0 t h(λ)x(t−λ) dλ = ∫ 0 t Aδ(λ)x(t−λ) dλ = Ax(t).
The expression for y(t) shows that, if the circuit has no memory, the output is
a scaled replica of the input.
The circuit shown in Example 13.11 illustrates the distortion between input
and output for a circuit that has some memory. This distortion is clear when
we plot the input and output waveforms on the same graph, as in Fig. 13.45.

output waveforms for Example

13.7 The Transfer Function and the
Steady-State Sinusoidal Response
Once we have computed a circuit’s transfer function, we can use it to find the
steady-state response to a sinusoidal input. To show this, we assume that
x(t)=A cos (ωt+ϕ),
and then we use Eq. 13.8 to find the steady-state solution of y(t). To find the
Laplace transform of x(t), we first write x(t) as
x(t)=A cos ωt cos ϕ−A sin ωt sin ϕ,
from which
X(s) = (A cos ϕ)s s 2 + ω 2 − (A sin ϕ)ω s 2 + ω 2 = A(s cos ϕ−ω sin ϕ) s 2 +
ω 2 .
Substituting the expression for X(s) into Eq. 13.8 gives the s-domain
expression for the response:
Y(s)=H(s)A(s cos ϕ−ω sin ϕ)s2+ω2.
Think about the partial fraction expansion of Y(s). The number of terms in
the expansion depends on the number of poles of H(s). Because H(s) is not
specified, we write the expansion of Y(s) as
Y(s)= K 1 s−jω + K 1 * s+jω + ∑ terms generated by the poles of H(s).
The first two terms in the partial fraction expansion correspond to the
complex conjugate poles of the sinusoidal input because s2+ω2=(s−jω)
(s+jω). But the terms corresponding to the poles of H(s) do not contribute to
the steady-state response of y(t), because all these poles lie in the left half of
the s plane. Consequently, the corresponding time-domain terms approach
zero as t increases. Thus, only the first two partial fraction terms determine

the steady-state response, so we only have to calculate a single partial
fraction coefficient, K1:
K 1 = H(s)A(s cos ϕ−ω sin ϕ) s+jω | s=jω = H(jω)A(jω cos ϕ−ω sin ϕ) 2jω =
H(jω)A(cos ϕ+j sin ϕ) 2 = 1 2 H(jω)A e jϕ .
In general, H(jω) is a complex number, which we can write in polar form as
H(jω)=|H(jω)|ejθ(ω).
We see that the transfer function’s magnitude, |H(jω)|, and its phase angle,
θ(ω), vary with the frequency ω. Substituting the polar form for H(jω) into
the equation for K1 and simplifying, we see that the expression for K1
becomes
K1=A2|H(jω)|ej[θ(ω)+ϕ].
We find the steady-state component for y(t) by inverse-transforming the first
two terms in the partial fraction expansion of Y(s), ignoring the terms
generated by the poles of H(s). Thus
Sinusoidal Steady-State Response
computed Using a Transfer
Function
yss(t)=A|H(jω)| cos [ωt+ϕ+θ(ω)],(13.11)
which tells us how to find a circuit’s steady-state response to a sinusoidal
input using the circuit’s transfer function:
Determine the input sinusoid’s magnitude, A, frequency, ω, and phase
angle, ϕ
Evaluate the circuit’s transfer function, H(s), for s=jω.

Transform H(jω) into polar form, with a magnitude |H(jω)| and a phase
angle θ.
Write the steady-state output as a cosine with the amplitude A|H(jω)|, a
phase angle of ϕ+θ, and a frequency of ω.
Example 13.12 uses a circuit’s transfer function to find its sinusoidal steady-
state response.

Figure 13.46 Full Alternative Text
Solution
From Example 13.9,
H(s)=1000(s+5000)s2+6000s+25×106.
The frequency of the voltage source is 5000 rad/s, so we evaluate H(j5000):
H( j5000 ) = 1000( 5000+j5000 ) −25× 10 6 +j5000( 6000 )+25× 10 6 = 1+j1
j6 = 1−j1 6 = 2 6 −45° .
Then, from Eq. 13.11,
v o ss = ( 120 ) 2 6  cos ( 5000t+30°−45° ) = 20 2  cos ( 5000t−15° ) V.
The relationship between H(s) and H(jω) provides a link between the time
domain and the frequency domain. Using Eq. 13.11, we can find the
sinusoidal steady-state response of a circuit by evaluating H(jω).
Theoretically, we can reverse the process; instead of using H(s) to find H(jω),
we can use H(jω) to find H(s). To do so, we determine H(jω) experimentally

and then construct H(s) from the data. Once we know H(s), we can find the
circuit’s response to other inputs. While this experimental approach is not
always possible, in some cases it does provide a way to find H(s) for a circuit
whose components and their values are unknown.
The transfer function is also used to find a circuit’s frequency response, a
concept we introduce in the next chapter.

13.8 The Impulse Function in
Circuit Analysis
Circuit analysis uses impulse functions to represent a switching operation or
because a circuit’s input is an impulsive source. We can use Laplace
transform methods to determine the impulsive currents and voltages created
during switching, and to find a circuit’s response to an impulsive source. To
begin, we create an impulse function with a switching operation.
Switching Operations
We use two different circuits to create an impulse function with a switching
operation: a capacitor circuit, and a series inductor circuit.
Capacitor Circuit
 In the circuit shown in Fig. 13.47, the capacitor C1 is charged to an initial
voltage of V0 at the time the switch is closed. The initial charge on C2 is
zero. We want to find the expression for i(t) as R→0. Figure 13.48 shows the
s-domain equivalent circuit, and we use Ohm’s law to find the s-domain
current I:
Figure 13.47 A circuit showing
the creation of an impulsive
current.

Figure 13.47 Full Alternative Text
Figure 13.48 The s-domain
equivalent circuit for the
circuit shown in Fig. 13.47.

Figure 13.48 Full Alternative Text
I = V 0 /s R+(1/s C 1 )+(1/s C 2 ) = V 0 /R s+(1/R C e ) ,
where the equivalent capacitance C1C2/(C1+C2) is replaced by Ce.
We inverse-transform the expression for I using Table 12.3 to get
i=(V0Re−t/RCe) u(t),
which indicates that as R decreases, the initial current (V0/R) increases and
the time constant (RCe) decreases. Thus, as R gets smaller, the current starts
from a larger initial value and then drops off more rapidly. Figure 13.49
shows these characteristics of i.
Figure 13.49 The plot of i(t)
versus t for two different values
of R.

Figure 13.49 Full Alternative Text
As R approaches zero, the initial value of i approaches infinity and the
duration of i approaches zero. If the area under the current function is
independent of R, i approaches an impulse function. Physically, the total area

under the i versus t curve represents the total charge transferred to C2 after
the switch is closed. Thus
Area=q=∫0−∞V0Re−t/RCedt=V0Ce,
so the total charge transferred to C2 equals V0Ce coulombs and is
independent of R. Thus, as R approaches zero, the current approaches an
impulse with strength V0Ce; that is,
i→V0Ceδ(t).
The physical interpretation of this expression says that when R=0, a finite
amount of charge is transferred to C2 instantaneously. Set R=0 in the circuit
of Fig. 13.47 to see why we get an instantaneous transfer of charge. With
R=0, closing the switch creates a contradiction: we apply a voltage across a
capacitor whose initial voltage is zero. The capacitor voltage can change
instantaneously only if there is an instantaneous transfer of charge. When the
switch is closed, the voltage across C2 does not jump to V0 but to its final
value of
v2=C1V0C1+C2.
We leave the derivation of v2 to you (see Problem 13.83).
If we set R=0 at the outset, Laplace transform analysis predicts the impulsive
current response. Thus,
I=V0/s(1/sC1)+(1/sC2)=C1C2V0C1+C2=CeV0.
In writing this equation for I, we use the capacitor voltages at t=0−. The
inverse transform of I, which is constant, is the constant times the impulse
function; therefore,
i=CeV0δ(t).
Example 13.13 uses Laplace methods to analyze an inductor circuit whose
output contains an impulse.

Example 13.13 A Series Inductor
Circuit with an Impulsive Response
The switch in the circuit shown in Fig. 13.50 has been closed for a long time.
At t=0 it opens. Use Laplace methods to find the output voltage, vo, and the
current in the 3 H inductor, i1.
Figure 13.50 The circuit for
Example 13.13.
Figure 13.50 Full Alternative Text
Solution
Use Analysis Method 13.1 to construct and analyze the s-domain circuit.
1. Step 1: For t<0, the switch is closed, and the inductors behave like short
circuits. The current in the 2 H inductor is zero, since there is no source
in that part of the circuit. The current in the 3 H inductor is

100/10=10 A.
2. Step 2: The combination of the dc voltage source and the switch is
defined by the time-domain function 100u(t). The Laplace transform of
this function is 100/s V-s, which labels the voltage source in the s-
domain circuit in Fig. 13.51.
3. Step 3: Represent the output voltage and current using Vo and I1,
respectively, as shown in Fig. 13.51. Note that in the s-domain circuit,
the current in both inductors is the same.
4. Step 4: The impedance of the resistors is their resistance. The impedance
of the inductors is sL. We also need to represent the nonzero initial
current in the 3 H inductor using either a series-connected voltage
source or a parallel-connected current source. Here, we choose the
voltage source, so the resulting s-domain circuit has a single mesh. The
voltage source has the value LI0=3(10)=30 V-s. The s-domain circuit
resulting from Steps 1–4 is shown in Fig. 13.51.
Figure 13.51 The s-domain
equivalent circuit for the
circuit shown in Fig. 13.50.

Figure 13.51 Full Alternative Text
5. Step 5: From the circuit in Fig. 13.51, we find Vo using voltage
division:
Vo=2s+155s+25(100s+30)=12s2+130s+300s2+5s.
Now use Ohm’s law to find I1:
I1=(100/s)+305s+25=6s+20s(s+5).
6. Step 6: We will discuss initial and final values in this circuit after we
find the output voltage and current, so for now we skip this step.
7. Step 7: The expression for Vo is an improper rational function, so before
we find its partial fraction expansion we must divide numerator by
denominator to get
Vo=12s2+130s+300s2+5s=12+70s+300s(s+5).
The second term is a proper rational function of s, so we can find the
partial fraction expansion:
Vo=12+60s+10(s+5).

Using Tables 12.1–12.3, we can inverse-Laplace-transform Vo to get
vo=12δ(t)+(60+10e−5t)u(t)V.
The partial fraction expansion for I1 is
I1=6s+20s(s+5)=4s+2(s+5).
Using Table 12.3, we can inverse-Laplace-transform I1 to get
i1=(4+2e−5t)u(t)A.
Do the solutions for the output voltage and current in the circuit of Fig. 13.50
make sense? Before the switch is opened, the current in the 3 H inductor is 10
A, and the current in the 2 H inductor is 0 A. From the equation for i1 derived
in Example 13.13, we know that at t=0+, the current in both inductors is 6 A.
This means the current in the 3 H inductor changes instantaneously from 10
to 6 A, while the current in the 2 H inductor changes instantaneously from 0
to 6 A. Then, the current decreases exponentially from 6 A to a final value of
4 A. This final value is easily verified from the circuit; that is, it should equal
100/25, or 4 A. Figure 13.52 shows these characteristics of i1 and i2.
Figure 13.52 The inductor
currents versus t for the circuit
shown in Fig. 13.50.

Figure 13.52 Full Alternative Text
Do these instantaneous jumps in the inductor current make sense in terms of
the physical behavior of the circuit? First, note that when the switch opens in
Fig. 13.50, the two inductors are in series. Any impulsive voltage appearing
across the 3 H inductor must be exactly balanced by an impulsive voltage
across the 2 H inductor because the sum of the impulsive voltages around a
closed path must equal zero. Faraday’s law states that the induced voltage is
proportional to the change in flux linkage (v=dλ/dt). Therefore, the change in
flux linkage must sum to zero. In other words, the total flux linkage
immediately after switching is the same as that before switching. For the
circuit here, the flux linkage before switching is

λ=L1i1+L2i2=3(10)+2(0)=30 Wb-turns.
Immediately after switching, it is
λ=(L1+L2)i(0+)=5i(0+).
Therefore,
i1(0+)=30/5=6 A.
Thus, the solution for i1 in Example 13.13 agrees with the principle of the
conservation of flux linkage.
We now test the validity of vo from Example 13.13. First, we check the
impulsive term 12δ(t). The instantaneous jump of i2 from 0 to 6 A at t=0
means the derivative of i2 contains the impulse 6δ(t). This current impulse
results in a 12δ(t) impulse in the voltage across the 2 H inductor. For
t>0, di2/dt=di1/dt=−10e−5tA/s. The voltage vo is the sum of the voltage
across the 15 Ω resistor and the voltage across the 2 H inductor:
v o = 15(4+2 e −5t )+2(−10 e −5t ) = (60+10 e −5t )u(t) V.
This expression agrees with the last two terms of vo from Example 13.13.
Thus, the expression for vo does make sense in terms of known circuit
behavior.
We can also check the instantaneous drop from 10 to 6 A in the current i1.
This drop means the derivative of i1 contains the impulse −4δ(t). Therefore,
the voltage across L1 includes the impulse −12δ(t). This impulse exactly
balances the impulse included in the voltage across L2; that is, the sum of the
impulsive voltages around a closed path equals zero.
Impulsive Sources
Impulse functions can appear in circuit sources as well as circuit outputs.
These sources are called impulsive sources. An impulsive source creates a
finite amount of energy in the circuit instantaneously. A mechanical analogy
is striking a bell with an impulsive clapper blow. After the energy has been
transferred to the bell, the natural response of the bell determines the tone

emitted (that is, the frequency of the resulting sound waves) and the tone’s
duration.
In the circuit shown in Fig. 13.53, an impulsive voltage source with a
strength of V0 volt-seconds is applied to a series connection of a resistor and
an inductor. When the voltage source is applied, the initial energy in the
inductor is zero, so the initial current is zero. There is no voltage drop across
R, so the impulsive voltage source appears directly across L. The impulsive
voltage across the inductor creates an instantaneous current. The current is
Figure 13.53 An RL circuit
excited by an impulsive voltage
source.
Figure 13.53 Full Alternative Text

i=1L∫0−tV0δ(x) dx.
The integral of δ(t) over any interval that includes zero is 1, so
i(0+)=V0L A.
Thus, in an infinitesimal moment, the impulsive voltage source has stored
energy in the inductor, given by
w=12L(V0L)2=12V02LJ.
The initial current V0/L now decays to zero due to the natural response of the
circuit; that is,
i=V0Le−t/τu(t),
where τ=L/R. Remember from Chapter 7 that the natural response occurs as
passive elements release or store energy. When a circuit is driven by an
impulsive source, the total response is completely defined by the natural
response; the duration of the impulsive source is so infinitesimal that it does
not create a forced response.
We can also derive the inductor current using the Laplace transform method.
Figure 13.54 shows the s-domain equivalent of the circuit in Fig. 13.53. From
this circuit,
Figure 13.54 The s-domain
equivalent circuit for the
circuit shown in Fig. 13.53.

I=V0R+sL=V0/Ls+(R/L),
The inverse Laplace transform is
i=V0Le−(R/L)t=V0Le−t/τu(t).
Thus, the Laplace transform method gives the correct solution for i≥0+.
Finally, we consider the case in which internally generated impulses and
externally applied impulses occur simultaneously. As we see in Example
13.14, the Laplace transform method automatically ensures the correct
solution for t>0+ if inductor currents and capacitor voltages at t=0− are used
in constructing the s-domain equivalent circuit and if externally applied
impulses are represented by their transforms.

Solution
Note that the circuit in Fig. 13.55 was created from the circuit for Example
13.13 (Fig. 13.50) by adding an impulsive voltage source of 50δ(t) in series

corresponds to the time-domain circuit in Fig. 13.50. The s-domain circuit is
in Fig. 13.51. To find the s-domain circuit corresponding to the circuit in Fig.
13.55, we add another voltage source in series, whose value is L{50δ(t)}=50
V-s. The s-domain equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 13.56.

Figure 13.56 Full Alternative Text
From this circuit, the expression for I1 is

I1=(100/s)+50+305s+25=16s+20s(s+5).
The partial fraction expansion of I1 is
I1=4s+12s+5,
and the inverse Laplace transform of I1 is
i1=(4+12e−5t)u(t)A.
The expression for Vo is
Vo=(2s+15)I1=32s2+280s+300s(s+5),
which is an improper rational function. Before we can find the partial fraction
expansion, we divide the numerator of Vo by its denominator to get
Vo=32+120s+300s(s+5)
.
The partial fraction expansion of Vo is then
Vo=32+60s+60s+5
and the inverse Laplace transform of Vo is
vo=32δ(t)+(60+60e−5t)u(t)V.
As before, we test the results of Example 13.14 to see whether they make
sense. From the expression for i1, we see that the current in L1 and L2 is 16
A at t=0+. In Example 13.13, at the instant the switch opens, i1 decreases
from 10 to 6 A and i2 increases from 0 to 6 A. Superimposed on these
changes is a 10 A current in L1 and L2, due to the impulsive voltage source;
that is,
i1=13+2∫0−t50δ(x)dx=10 A.
Therefore, i1 increases suddenly from 10 to 16 A, while i2 increases
suddenly from 0 to 16 A. The final value of both currents is 4 A. Figure 13.57

shows i1 and i2 graphically.
Figure 13.57 The inductor
currents versus t for the circuit
shown in Fig. 13.55.

Figure 13.57 Full Alternative Text
We can also find the abrupt changes in i1 and i2 without using superposition.

The sum of the impulsive voltages across the 3 H and 2 H inductors equals
50δ(t). Thus, the change in flux linkage must sum to 50; that is,
Δλ1+Δλ2=50.
Because λ=Li, we get
3Δi1+2Δi2=50.
But because i1 and i2 must be equal after the switch opens,
i1(0−)+Δi1=i2(0−)+Δi2.
Thus,
10+Δi1=0+Δi2.
Solving for Δi1 and Δi2 yields
Δ i 1 = 6 A, Δ i 2 = 16 A.
These expressions agree with the previous check.
Figure 13.57 also indicates that the derivatives of i1 and i2 will contain an
impulse at t=0. Specifically, the derivative of i1 will have an impulse of 6δ(t),
and the derivative of i2 will have an impulse of 16δ(t). Figure 13.58
illustrates the derivatives of i1 and i2.
Figure 13.58 The derivatives of
i1 and i2.

Figure 13.58 Full Alternative Text
Now let’s turn to the expression for the output voltage, vo, found in Example
13.14. The impulsive component 32δ(t) agrees with the impulse 16δ(t) that
characterizes di2/dt at the origin. The term (60e−5t+60) agrees with the fact
that for t>0+,
vo=15i2+2di2dt=15i1+2di1dt.
We test the impulsive component of di1/dt by noting that it produces an
impulsive voltage of (3)6δ(t), or 18δ(t), across L1. This voltage, added to
32δ(t) across L2, gives us 50δ(t). Thus, the algebraic sum of the impulsive
voltages around the mesh is zero.
To summarize, the Laplace transform will correctly predict the impulsive
currents and voltages created by switching. However, the s-domain
equivalent circuits must be based on initial conditions at t=0−, that is, on the
initial conditions that exist prior to the switching. The Laplace transform will
correctly predict the response to impulsive input sources by representing
these sources in the s domain by their Laplace transforms.

Practical Perspective
Surge Suppressors
As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, voltage surges can occur in a
circuit that is operating in the sinusoidal steady state. We use Laplace
transform methods to see how a voltage surge is created between the line and
neutral conductors of a household circuit when a load is switched off during
sinusoidal steady-state operation.
Consider the circuit shown in Fig. 13.59, which models a household circuit
with three loads, one of which is switched off at t=0. To simplify the analysis,
we assume that the line-to-neutral voltage, V0, is 120 0°V , a standard
household voltage, and that when the load is switched off at t=0, the value of
Vg does not change. After the switch is opened, we can construct the s-
domain circuit, as shown in Fig. 13.60. Note that because the phase angle of
the voltage across the inductive load is 0°, the initial current through the
inductive load is 0. Therefore, only the line inductance has a nonzero initial
condition, which is modeled in the s-domain circuit as a voltage source with
the value LlI0, as seen in Fig. 13.60.

Just before the switch is opened at t=0, each of the loads has a steady-state
sinusoidal voltage with a peak magnitude of 1202=169.7 V. All of the current
in the line from the voltage source divides among the three loads. When the
switch is opened at t=0, all of the current in the line appears in the remaining
resistive load because the inductive load current is 0 at t=0 and the inductor
current cannot change instantaneously. Therefore, the voltage drop across the
remaining loads can experience a surge as the line current is directed through
the resistive load.
For example, if the initial current in the line is 25 A (rms) and the impedance
of the resistive load is12 Ω, the voltage drop across the resistor surges from
169.7 V to (25)(2)(12)=424.3 V when the switch is opened. If the resistive
load cannot handle this amount of voltage, it needs to be protected with a
surge suppressor such as the one shown at the beginning of the chapter.

Summary
We can represent each of the circuit elements as an s-domain equivalent
circuit by Laplace-transforming the voltage-current equation for each
element:
Resistor: V=RI
Inductor: V=sLI−LI0
Capacitor: V=(1/sC)I+Vo/s
In these equations, V=L{v}, I=L{i}, I0 is the initial current through the
inductor, and V0 is the initial voltage across the capacitor. (See pages
484–485.)
Using Steps 1–4 in Analysis Method 13.1, we can transform the time-
domain circuit into the s domain. Table 13.1 summarizes the equivalent
circuits for resistors, inductors, and capacitors in the s domain. (See
page 486.)
Solve the s-domain equivalent circuit in Analysis Method 13.1, Step 5,
by writing algebraic equations using the circuit analysis techniques from
resistive circuits. Step 6 checks the resulting s-domain voltages and
currents using the initial- and final-value theorems, where possible. Step
7 finds the partial fraction expansion for the s-domain voltages and
currents, and uses Table 12.3 to find the inverse Laplace transforms.
(See page 487.)
Circuit analysis in the s domain is particularly advantageous for solving
transient response problems in linear lumped parameter circuits when
initial conditions are known. It is also useful for problems involving
multiple simultaneous mesh-current or node-voltage equations because
it reduces problems to algebraic rather than differential equations. (See
page 489.)

The transfer function is the s-domain ratio of a circuit’s output to its
input. It is defined as
H(s)=Y(s)X(s),
where Y(s) is the Laplace transform of the output signal, and X(s) is the
Laplace transform of the input signal. (See page 500.)
The partial fraction expansion of the product H(s)X(s) yields a term for
each pole of H(s) and X(s). The H(s) terms correspond to the transient
component of the total response, while the X(s) terms correspond to the
steady-state component. (See page 503.)
If a circuit is driven by a unit impulse, x(t)=δ(t), then the response of the
circuit equals the inverse Laplace transform of the transfer function,
y(t)=L−1{H(s)}=h(t). ( See pages 504–505.)
When a circuit is time-invariant, delaying the input by a seconds delays
the output by a seconds. (See page 504.)
The output of a circuit, y(t), can be computed by convolving the input,
x(t), with the impulse response of the circuit, h(t) :
y( t ) = h( t ) * x( t ) = ∫ 0 t h( λ )x( t−λ ) dλ = x( t ) * h( t ) = ∫ 0 t x( λ )h(
t−λ ) dλ.
A graphical interpretation of the convolution integral usually helps you
to compute y(t). (See pages 505 and 508.)
We can use the transfer function of a circuit to compute its steady-state
response to a sinusoidal source. To do so, make the substitution s=jω in
H(s) and represent the resulting complex number as a magnitude and
phase angle. If
x( t ) = Acos( ωt + ϕ ), H( jω ) = | H( jω ) | e jθ( ω ) ,
then
yss(t)=A|H(jω)| cos[ωt + ϕ + θ(ω)].

(See page 512.)
Laplace transform analysis correctly predicts impulsive currents and
voltages arising from switching and impulsive sources. You must ensure
that the s-domain equivalent circuits are based on initial conditions prior
to the switching, that is, at t=0−. (See page 520.)

Up to this point in our analysis of circuits with sinusoidal sources, the source
frequency has been held constant. In this chapter, we analyze the effect of
varying source frequency on circuit voltages and currents. The result of this
analysis is the frequency response of a circuit.
We’ve seen in previous chapters that a circuit’s response depends on the
types of elements in the circuit, the way the elements are connected, and the
element impedances. Varying the frequency of a sinusoidal source does not
change the element types or their connections, but it does change the
capacitor and inductor impedances because these impedances are functions of
frequency.
We can design circuits whose output signals reside within a desired

frequency range, excluding all other frequencies that appear in the circuit’s
input. Such circuits are called frequency-selective circuits. Many devices
that communicate via electric signals, such as telephones, radios, televisions,
and satellites, employ frequency-selective circuits.
Frequency-selective circuits are also called filters because they filter out
certain input signals on the basis of frequency. Note that no practical
frequency-selective circuit can perfectly or completely filter out selected
frequencies. Rather, filters attenuate—that is, weaken or lessen the effect of
—any input signals with frequencies outside the desired frequency band. For
example, your home stereo system may have a graphic equalizer. Each band
in the graphic equalizer is a filter that amplifies sounds (audible frequencies)
in the frequency range of the band and attenuates frequencies outside of that
band. Thus, the graphic equalizer enables you to change the sound volume in
each frequency band.

We begin this chapter by analyzing circuits from each of the four major
categories of filters: low pass, high pass, band pass, and band reject. The
transfer function of a circuit is the starting point for the frequency response
analysis. Pay close attention to the similarities among the transfer functions
of circuits that perform the same filtering function. We will employ these
similarities when designing filter circuits in Chapter 15.
Practical Perspective
Pushbutton Telephone Circuits
A pushbutton telephone produces tones that you hear when you press a
button. You may have wondered about these tones. How are they used to tell
the telephone system which button was pushed? Why are tones used at all?
Why do the tones sound musical? How does the phone system tell the
difference between button tones and the normal sounds of people talking or
singing?
The telephone system was designed to handle audio signals—those with
frequencies between 300 Hz and 3 kHz. Thus, all signals from the system to
the user have to be audible—including the dial tone and the busy signal.
Similarly, all signals from the user to the system have to be audible, including
the signal that the user has pressed a button. It is important to distinguish
button signals from the normal audio signal, so a dual-tone-multiple-
frequency (DTMF) design is employed. When a number button is pressed, a
unique pair of sinusoidal tones with very precise frequencies is sent by the
phone to the telephone system. The DTMF frequency and timing
specifications make it unlikely that a human voice could produce the exact
tone pairs, even if the person were trying. In the central telephone facility,
electric circuits monitor the audio signal, listening for the tone pairs that
signal a number. In the Practical Perspective example at the end of the
chapter, we will examine the design of the DTMF filters used to determine
which button has been pushed.

14.1 Some Preliminaries
Recall from Section 13.7 that a circuit’s transfer function provides an easy
way to compute the steady-state response to a sinusoidal input. There, we
considered only fixed-frequency sources. To study the frequency response of
a circuit, we replace a fixed-frequency sinusoidal source with a varying-
frequency sinusoidal source. The transfer function is still an immensely
useful tool because the magnitude and phase of the output signal depend only
on the magnitude and phase of the transfer function H(jω), which vary as a
function of the source frequency ω. Note that this method of analyzing the
output of a circuit as its input frequency varies assumes that we can vary the
input frequency without changing its magnitude or phase angle.
To further simplify this first look at frequency-selective circuits, we will also
restrict our attention to cases where both the input and output signals are
sinusoidal voltages, as illustrated in Fig. 14.1. Thus, the circuit’s transfer
function will be the ratio of the Laplace transform of the output voltage to the
Laplace transform of the input voltage, or H(s)=Vo(s) / Vi(s). We should
keep in mind, however, that for a particular application, a current may be
either the input signal or output signal of interest.

The signals passed from the input to the output fall within a band of
frequencies called the passband. Input voltages outside this band have their
magnitudes attenuated by the circuit and are thus effectively prevented from
reaching the circuit’s output. Frequencies not in a circuit’s passband are in its
stopband. Frequency-selective circuits are categorized by the location of the
passband.
We can identify the type of frequency-selective circuit by examining its
frequency response plot. A frequency response plot shows how a circuit’s
transfer function (both amplitude and phase) changes as the source frequency
changes. A frequency response plot has two parts.

A graph of |H(jω)| versus frequency ω, called the magnitude plot.
A graph of θ(jω) versus frequency ω, called the phase angle plot.
The ideal frequency response plots for the four major categories of filters are
shown in Figs. 14.2 and Figure 14.3. Figure 14.2 illustrates the ideal plots for
a low-pass and a high-pass filter, respectively. Both filters have one passband
and one stopband, which are defined by the cutoff frequency that separates
them. The names low pass and high pass are derived from the magnitude
plots: a low-pass filter passes signals at frequencies lower than the cutoff
frequency from the input to the output, and a high-pass filter passes signals
at frequencies higher than the cutoff frequency. Thus, the terms low and high
as used here do not refer to any absolute values of frequency, but rather to
relative values with respect to the cutoff frequency.

Note from the graphs for both these filters (as well as those for the bandpass
and bandreject filters in Fig. 14.3) that the phase angle plot for an ideal filter
varies linearly in the passband. It is of no interest outside the passband
because there the magnitude is zero. Linear phase variation is necessary to
avoid phase distortion.
The two remaining categories of filters each have two cutoff frequencies.
Figure 14.3(a) illustrates the ideal frequency response plot of a bandpass
filter, which passes a source voltage to the output only when the source
frequency is within the band defined by the two cutoff frequencies. Figure
14.3(b) shows the ideal plot of a bandreject filter, which passes a source
voltage to the output only when the source frequency is outside the band

defined by the two cutoff frequencies. The bandreject filter thus rejects, or
stops, the source voltage from reaching the output when its frequency is
within the band defined by the cutoff frequencies.
In specifying a filter using any of the circuits from this chapter, it is important
to note that the magnitude and phase angle characteristics are not
independent. In other words, the characteristics of a circuit that result in a
particular magnitude plot will also dictate the form of the phase angle plot
and vice versa. For example, once we select a desired form for the magnitude
response of a circuit, the phase angle response is also determined.
Alternatively, if we select a desired form for the phase angle response, the
magnitude response is also determined. Although there are some frequency-
selective circuits for which the magnitude and phase angle behavior can be
independently specified, these circuits are not presented here.
The next sections present examples of circuits from each of the four filter
categories. These circuits represent only a few of the many circuits that act as
filters. As you read, focus your attention on trying to identify what properties
of a circuit determine its behavior as a filter. For example, you should note
the various forms of the transfer functions that perform the same filtering
function. Identifying the form of a filter’s transfer function will ultimately
help you in designing filter circuits for particular applications.
All of the filters in this chapter are passive filters because their behavior
depends only on passive elements: resistors, capacitors, and inductors.
Usually, the largest output amplitude a passive filter can achieve equals the
input amplitude. The only passive filter described in this chapter that can
amplify its output is the series RLC resonant filter. Also, if you place an
impedance in series with the source or in parallel with the load, the maximum
output amplitude will decrease. Because many practical filter applications
require amplification (a ratio of output-to-input amplitude greater than 1),
passive filters have some significant disadvantages. Many active filter
circuits, introduced in Chapter 15, provide amplification, and thereby
overcome this passive filter disadvantage.

14.2 Low-Pass Filters
Two circuits that behave as low-pass filters are the series RL circuit and the
series RC circuit. Let’s investigate the circuit characteristics that affect the
cutoff frequency.
The Series RL Circuit—Qualitative
Analysis
A series RL circuit is shown in Fig. 14.4(a). The circuit’s input is a sinusoidal
voltage source with varying frequency. The circuit’s output is the voltage
across the resistor. Suppose the source frequency starts very low and
increases gradually. We know that the behavior of the ideal resistor does not
change because its impedance is independent of frequency. But consider how
the behavior of the inductor changes.

pass filter. (b) The equivalent

Recall that the impedance of an inductor is jωL. At low frequencies, the
inductor’s impedance is very small compared with the resistor’s impedance,
and the inductor effectively functions as a short circuit. The term low
frequencies thus refers to any frequencies for which ωL<<R. The equivalent
circuit for ω=0 is shown in Fig. 14.4(b). In this equivalent circuit, the output
voltage and the input voltage are equal both in magnitude and in phase angle.
As the frequency increases, the impedance of the inductor increases relative
to that of the resistor. Increasing the inductor’s impedance causes a
corresponding increase in the magnitude of the voltage drop across the
inductor and a corresponding decrease in the output voltage magnitude.
Increasing the inductor’s impedance also introduces a shift in phase angle
between the inductor’s voltage and current, resulting in a phase angle
difference between the input and output voltage. The output voltage always
lags the input voltage, and as the frequency increases, this phase lag
approaches 90∘.
At high frequencies, the inductor’s impedance is very large compared with
the resistor’s impedance, and the inductor thus functions as an open circuit,
effectively blocking the flow of current in the circuit. The term high

frequencies thus refers to any frequencies for which ωL>>R. The equivalent
circuit for ω=∞ is shown in Fig. 14.4(c), where the output voltage magnitude
is zero. The phase angle of the output voltage is 90∘ more negative than that
of the input voltage, so the output lags the input by 90°.
Based on the behavior of the output voltage magnitude, this series RL circuit
selectively passes low-frequency inputs to the output, and it blocks high-
frequency inputs from reaching the output. The circuit’s response to varying
input frequency is shown in Fig. 14.5, and these plots represent the frequency
response of the series RL circuit in Fig. 14.4(a). The upper plot shows how
|H(jω)| varies with frequency. The lower plot shows how θ(jω) varies with
frequency. Appendix E presents a method for constructing these plots.

response plot for the series RL
circuit in Fig. 14.4(a).

We have also superimposed the ideal magnitude plot for a low-pass filter
from Fig. 14.2(a) on the magnitude plot of the RL filter in Fig. 14.5 (see the
dashed line). There is an obvious difference between the magnitude plots of
an ideal filter and an actual RL filter. The ideal filter exhibits a discontinuity
in magnitude at the cutoff frequency, ωc, which creates an abrupt transition
between the passband and the stopband. While this is, ideally, how we would
like our filters to perform, it is not possible to use real components to
construct a circuit with an abrupt transition in magnitude. Circuits acting as
low-pass filters have a magnitude response that transitions gradually between
the passband and the stopband. Hence, the magnitude plot of a real circuit
requires us to define what we mean by the cutoff frequency, ωc.
Defining the Cutoff Frequency
We need to define the cutoff frequency, ωc, for realistic filter circuits because
the magnitude plot does not allow us to identify a single frequency that
divides the passband and the stopband. The definition for cutoff frequency
widely used by electrical engineers is the frequency for which the transfer
function magnitude is decreased by the factor 1/2 from its maximum value:
Cutoff Frequency Definition
|H(jωc)|=12Hmax, (14.1)
where Hmax is the maximum magnitude of the transfer function. It follows
from Eq. 14.1 that the passband of a filter is defined as the range of
frequencies for which the amplitude of the output voltage is at least 70.7% of
the maximum possible amplitude.
Defining the cutoff frequency using the constant 1 / 2 is not an arbitrary
choice. Examining another consequence of the cutoff frequency explains this
choice. Recall from Section 10.5 that the average power delivered by any

circuit to a load is proportional to VL2, where VL is the amplitude of the
voltage drop across the load:
P=12VL2R.
If the circuit has a sinusoidal voltage source, Vi(jω), then the load voltage is
also a sinusoid, and its amplitude is a function of the frequency ω. We define
Pmax as the value of the average power delivered to a load when the
magnitude of the load voltage is maximum:
Pmax=12VLmax2R.
If we vary the frequency of the sinusoidal voltage source, Vi(jω), the load
voltage is a maximum when the magnitude of the circuit’s transfer function is
also a maximum:
VLmax=Hmax|Vi|. (14.2)
Now consider what happens to the average power when the frequency of the
voltage source is ωc. Using Eqs. 14.1 and 14.2, the magnitude of the load
voltage at ωc is
|VL(jωc)|=|H(jωc)||Vi| =12Hmax|Vi| =12VLmax.
Now, compute the power delivered to the load at the cutoff frequency:
P(jωc)=12|VL2(jωc)|R =12(12VLmax)2R =12VLmax2/2R =Pmax2.
We see that, at the cutoff frequency ωc, the average power delivered by the
circuit is one half the maximum average power. Thus, ωc is also called the
half-power frequency. In the filter’s passband, the average power delivered
to a load is at least 50% of the maximum average power.
The Series RL Circuit—
Quantitative Analysis

Now that we have defined the cutoff frequency for filter circuits, we can
analyze the series RL circuit to find the relationship between the component
values and the cutoff frequency for this low-pass filter. We begin by
constructing the s-domain equivalent of the circuit in Fig. 14.4(a), assuming
the initial conditions are zero. The resulting equivalent circuit is shown in
Fig. 14.6. The voltage transfer function for this circuit is
Figure 14.6 The s-domain
equivalent for the circuit in
Fig. 14.4(a).
Figure 14.6 Full Alternative Text
H(s)=Vo(s)Vi(s)=R/Ls+R/L. (14.3)
To study the frequency response, we make the substitution s=jω in Eq. 14.3:
H(jω)=R/Ljω+R/L.

We can now separate H(jω) into two equations. The first defines the transfer
function magnitude as a function of frequency; the second defines the transfer
function phase angle as a function of frequency:
|H(jω)|=R/Lω2+(R/L)2, (14.4)
θ(jω)=−tan−1(ωLR).
Close examination of Eq. 14.4 provides the quantitative support for the
magnitude plot shown in Fig. 14.5.
When ω=0, the denominator and the numerator are equal and |H(j0)|=1.
This means that at ω=0, the input voltage is passed to the output
terminals without a change in the voltage magnitude.
As the frequency increases, the numerator of Eq. 14.4 is unchanged, but
the denominator gets larger. Thus, |H(jω)| decreases as the frequency
increases, as shown in the plot in Fig. 14.5. Likewise, as the frequency
increases, the phase angle changes from its dc value of 0°, becoming
more negative.
As ω→∞, the denominator of Eq. 14.4 approches infinity and |H(j∞)|=0,
as seen in Fig. 14.5. As ω→∞, the phase angle approaches −90°, as seen
from the phase angle plot in Fig. 14.5.
Using Eq. 14.4, we can compute the cutoff frequency, ωc. Remember that ωc
is defined as the frequency at which |H(jωc)|=(1 / 2)Hmax. For the low-pass
filter, Hmax=|H(j0)|=1, as seen in Fig. 14.5. Thus, for the circuit in Fig.
14.4(a),
|H(jωc)|=12|1|=R/Lωc2+(R/L)2.
.
Solving for ωc, we get
Cutoff Frequency for RL Filters
ωc=RL.(14.5)

Equation 14.5 provides an important result. The cutoff frequency, ωc, can be
set to any desired value by appropriately selecting values for R and L. We
can therefore design a low-pass filter with whatever cutoff frequency is
needed. Example 14.1 demonstrates the design potential of Eq. 14.5.
Example 14.1 Designing a Low-Pass
Filter
Electrocardiology is the study of the electric signals produced by the heart.
These signals maintain the heart’s rhythmic beat and are measured by an
instrument called an electrocardiograph. This instrument must be capable of
detecting periodic signals whose frequency is about 1 Hz (the normal heart
rate is 72 beats per minute). The instrument must operate in the presence of
sinusoidal noise consisting of signals from the surrounding electrical
environment, whose fundamental frequency is 60 Hz—the frequency at
which electric power is supplied.
Choose values for R and L in the circuit of Fig. 14.4(a) such that the resulting
circuit could be used in an electrocardiograph to filter out any noise above
10 Hz and pass the electric signals from the heart at or near 1 Hz. Then
compute the magnitude of Vo at 1 Hz, 10 Hz, and 60 Hz to see how well the
filter performs.
Solution
The problem is to select values for R and L that yield a low-pass filter with a
cutoff frequency of 10 Hz. From Eq. 14.5, we see that R and L cannot be
specified independently to generate a value for ωc. Therefore, let’s choose a
commonly available value of L, 100 mH. Before we use Eq. 14.5 to compute
the value of R needed to obtain the desired cutoff frequency, we need to
convert the cutoff frequency from hertz to radians per second:
ωc=2π(10)=20π rad / s.

Now, solve for the value of R that, together with L=100mH, will yield a low-
pass filter, with a cutoff frequency of 10 Hz:
R=ωcL=(20π)(100 × 10−3)=6.28Ω.
We can compute the magnitude of Vo using the equation |Vo|=|H(jω)| ⋅ |Vi|:
|Vo(ω)|=R / Lω2+ (R / L)2|Vi|=20πω2+ 400π2|Vi|.
Table 14.1 summarizes the computed magnitude values for the frequencies 1
Hz, 10 Hz, and 60 Hz. As expected, the input and output voltages have the
same magnitudes at the low frequency because the circuit is a low-pass filter.
At the cutoff frequency, the output voltage magnitude has been reduced by
1/2 from the unity passband magnitude. At 60 Hz, the output voltage
magnitude has been reduced by a factor of about 6, achieving the desired
attenuation of the noise that could corrupt the signal the electrocardiograph is
designed to measure.

A Series RC Circuit

The series RC circuit shown in Fig. 14.7 also behaves as a low-pass filter. We
can verify this via the same qualitative analysis used previously. In fact, such
a qualitative examination is an important problem-solving step that you
should get in the habit of performing when analyzing filters. Doing so
enables you to predict the filtering characteristics (low pass, high pass, etc.)
and thus also predict the general form of the transfer function. If the
calculated transfer function matches the qualitatively predicted form, you
have an important accuracy check.
Figure 14.7 A series RC low-
pass filter.
Figure 14.7 Full Alternative Text
Note that the circuit’s output is defined as the voltage across the capacitor.
We again use three frequency regions to determine how the series RC circuit

in Fig. 14.7 behaves:
Zero frequency (ω=0): The impedance of the capacitor is infinite, and
the capacitor acts as an open circuit. The input and output voltages are
thus the same.
Frequencies increasing from zero: The impedance of the capacitor
decreases relative to the impedance of the resistor, and the source
voltage divides between the resistive impedance and the capacitive
impedance. The output voltage is thus smaller than the source voltage.
Infinite frequency (ω=∞): The impedance of the capacitor is zero, and
the capacitor acts as a short circuit. The output voltage is thus zero.
Based on this analysis, the series RC circuit functions as a low-pass filter.
Example 14.2 explores this circuit quantitatively.
Example 14.2 Designing a Series RC
Low-Pass Filter
For the series RC circuit in Fig. 14.7:
1. Find the transfer function between the source voltage and the output
voltage.
2. Determine an equation for the cutoff frequency in the series RC circuit.
3. Choose values for R and C that will yield a low-pass filter with a cutoff
frequency of 3 kHz.
Solution
1. To derive an expression for the transfer function, we first construct the
s-domain equivalent of the circuit in Fig. 14.7, as shown in Fig. 14.8.

Using s-domain voltage division on the equivalent circuit, we find
Figure 14.8 The s-domain
equivalent for the circuit in
Fig. 14.7.
Figure 14.8 Full Alternative Text
H(s)=1RCs+1RC.
Now, substitute s=jω and compute the magnitude of the resulting
expression:
|H(jω)|=1RCω2+ (1RC)2.
2. At the cutoff frequency ωc, |H(jω)| is equal to (1 / 2)Hmax. For a low-
pass filter, Hmax=H(j0), and for the circuit in Fig. 14.8, H(j0)=1. We
can then describe the relationship among the quantities R, C, and ωc:

|H(jωc)|=12(1)=1RCωc2+(1RC)2.
Solving this equation for ωc, we get
Cutoff Frequency for RC Filters
ωc=1RC.
3. From the results in (b), we see that the cutoff frequency is determined by
the values of R and C. Because R and C cannot be determined
independently, let’s choose C=1 μF. Given a choice, we will usually
specify a value for C first, rather than for R, because the number of
available capacitor values is much smaller than the number of resistor
values. Remember that we have to convert the specified cutoff
frequency from 3 kHz to (2π)(3) krad / s:
R=1ωcC=1(2π)(3×103)(1×10−6)=53.05 Ω.
Figure 14.9 summarizes the two low-pass filter circuits we have analyzed.
Look carefully at the transfer functions and notice their similar form—they
differ only in the terms that specify the cutoff frequency. We can therefore
identify a general form for the transfer functions of these two low-pass filters:

filters, the series RL and the
series RC, together with their
transfer functions and cutoff
frequencies.

Filters
H(s)=ωcs+ωc.(14.6)
Any circuit with a voltage ratio described by Eq. 14.6 would behave as a low-
pass filter with a cutoff frequency of ωc. The problems at the end of the
chapter give you other examples of circuits with this voltage ratio.

Relating the Frequency Domain to
the Time Domain
Finally, you might have noticed one other important relationship. Recall our
discussion of the natural responses of the first-order RL and RC circuits in
Chapter 7. An important parameter for these circuits is the time constant, τ,
which characterizes the shape of the time response. For the RL circuit, the
time constant has the value L / R (Eq. 7.3); for the RC circuit, the time
constant is RC (Eq. 7.8). Compare the time constants to the cutoff
frequencies for these circuits and notice that
τ=1/ωc. (14.7)
This result is a direct consequence of the relationship between the time
response of a circuit and its frequency response, as revealed by the Laplace
transform. The discussion of memory and weighting as represented in the
convolution integral of Section 13.6 shows that as ωc→ ∞, the filter has no
memory, and the output approaches a scaled replica of the input; that is, no
filtering has occurred. As ωc→0, the filter has increased memory, and the
output voltage is a distortion of the input because filtering has occurred.

14.3 High-Pass Filters
Now we examine two circuits that function as high-pass filters. Once again,
they are the series RL circuit and the series RC circuit. We will see that the
same series circuit can act as either a low-pass or a high-pass filter,
depending on where the output voltage is defined. We will also determine the
relationship between the component values and the cutoff frequency of these
filters.
The Series RC Circuit—Qualitative
Analysis
A series RC circuit is shown in Fig. 14.10(a). In contrast to its low-pass
counterpart in Fig. 14.7, the output voltage here is defined across the resistor,
not the capacitor. Because of this, the effect of the changing capacitive
impedance is different than it was in the low-pass configuration.

equivalent circuit at ω=0; and
(c) the equivalent circuit at
ω=∞.

14.3-5 Full Alternative Text

14.3-5 Full Alternative Text

14.3-5 Full Alternative Text
At ω=0, the capacitor behaves like an open circuit, so there is no current in
the resistor. This is illustrated in the equivalent circuit in Fig. 14.10(b). In this
circuit, there is no voltage across the resistor and vo=0. The circuit filters out
the low-frequency input voltage before it reaches the circuit’s output.
As the frequency of the voltage source increases, the impedance of the
capacitor decreases relative to the impedance of the resistor, and the source

voltage is now divided between the capacitor and the resistor. The output
voltage magnitude thus begins to increase.
When the frequency of the source is infinite (ω=∞), the capacitor behaves as
a short circuit, so the capacitor voltage is zero. This is illustrated in the
equivalent circuit in Fig. 14.10(c). In this circuit, the input and output
voltages are the same.
The phase angle difference between the input and output voltages also varies
as the frequency of the source changes. For ω=∞, the output voltage is the
same as the input voltage, so the phase angle difference is zero. As the
frequency of the source decreases and the impedance of the capacitor
increases, a phase shift is introduced between the voltage and the current in
the capacitor. This creates a phase difference between the input and output
voltages. The phase angle of the output voltage leads that of the source
voltage. When ω=0, this phase angle difference reaches its maximum of
+90°.
Based on our qualitative analysis, we see that when the output is defined as
the voltage across the resistor, the series RC circuit behaves as a high-pass
filter. The components and connections are identical to the low-pass series
RC circuit, but the choice of output is different. Thus, we have confirmed the
earlier observation that the filtering characteristics of a circuit depend on the
definition of the output as well as on circuit components, values, and
connections.
Figure 14.11 shows the frequency response plot for the series RC high-pass
filter. For reference, the dashed lines indicate the magnitude plot for an ideal
high-pass filter. We now turn to a quantitative analysis of this same circuit.

response plot for the series RC
circuit in Fig. 14.10(a).


Figure 14.11 Full Alternative Text
The Series RC Circuit—
Quantitative Analysis
To begin, construct the s-domain equivalent of the circuit in Fig. 14.10(a), as
shown in Fig. 14.12. We use voltage division to find the transfer function:
Figure 14.12 The s-domain
equivalent of the circuit in Fig.
14.10(a).

Figure 14.12 Full Alternative Text
H(s)=Vo(s)Vi(s)=ss+1/RC.
Making the substitution s=jω gives
H(jω)=jωjω+1/RC.
Next, we separate H(jω) into two equations. The first is the equation
describing the magnitude of the transfer function; the second is the equation
describing the phase angle of the transfer function:
|H(jω)|=ωω2+(1/RC)2, ω(jω)=90°-tan-1?RC. (14.8)
A close look at the equations for the magnitude and phase angle of the
transfer function confirms the shape of the frequency response plot in Fig.
14.11. Using Eq. 14.8, we can calculate the cutoff frequency for the series
RC high-pass filter. Recall that at the cutoff frequency, the magnitude of the
transfer function is (1 / 2)Hmax. For a high-pass filter, Hmax=|H(jω)|

ω→∞=|H(j∞)|, as seen from Fig. 14.11. We can construct an equation for ωc
by setting the left-hand side of Eq. 14.8 to (1 / 2)|H(j∞)|, noting that for this
series RC circuit, |H(j∞)|=1:
12=ωcωc2+(1/RC)2.
Solving for ωc, we get
ωc=1RC. (14.9)
Equation 14.9 presents a familiar result. The cutoff frequency for the series
RC circuit has the value 1/RC, whether the circuit is configured as a low-pass
filter in Fig. 14.7 or as a high-pass filter in Fig. 14.10(a). This is not a
surprising result, as we have already discovered a connection between the
cutoff frequency, ωc, and the time constant, τ, of a circuit.
Example 14.3 analyzes a series RL circuit, this time configured as a high-
pass filter. Example 14.4 examines the effect of adding a load resistor at the
output of the filter.

2. Use the result from (a) to determine an equation for the cutoff frequency

frequency of 15 kHz.
Solution
1. Begin by constructing the s-domain equivalent of the series RL circuit,
as shown in Fig. 14.14. Then use voltage division to find the transfer
function:

H(s)=ss+R / L.
Making the substitution s=jω, we get
H(jω)=jωjω+R / L.
Notice that this equation has the same form as the equation for the series
RC high-pass filter.
2. To find an equation for the cutoff frequency, first compute the
magnitude of H(jω):
|H(jω)|=ωω2+ (R / L)2.

Then, as before, we set the left-hand side of this equation to (1 / 2)Hmax,
based on the definition of the cutoff frequency ωc. Remember that
Hmax=|H(j∞)| for a high-pass filter, and for the series RL circuit,
|H(j∞)|=1. We solve the resulting equation for the cutoff frequency:
12=ωcωc2 + (R / L)2,ωc=RL.
This is the same cutoff frequency we computed for the series RL low-
pass filter.
3. Using the equation for ωc computed in (b), we find that it is not possible
to specify values for R and L independently. Therefore, let’s arbitrarily
select a value of 500 Ω for R. Remember to convert the cutoff frequency
to radians per second:
L=Rωc=500(2π)(15,000)=5.31 mH.
Example 14.4 Loading the Series

Solution
1. Begin by transforming the circuit in Fig. 14.15 to the s-domain, as
shown in Fig. 14.16. Use voltage division across the parallel
combination of inductor and load resistor to compute the transfer
function:

Note that ωc is the cutoff frequency of the loaded filter.
2. For the unloaded RL high-pass filter from Example 14.3(c), the
passband magnitude is 1, and the cutoff frequency is 15 kHz. For the
loaded RL high-pass filter, R=RL=500 Ω, so K=1 / 2. Thus, for the
loaded filter, the passband magnitude is (1)(1 / 2)=1 / 2, and the cutoff
frequency is (15,000)(1 / 2)=7.5kHz. A sketch of the magnitude plots of
the loaded and unloaded circuits is shown in Fig. 14.17.

plots for the unloaded RL

high-pass filter of Fig 14.13
and the loaded RL high-pass
filter of Fig. 14.15.


Figure 14.17 Full Alternative Text
Let’s compare the transfer functions of the unloaded filter in Example 14.3
and the loaded filter in Example 14.4. Both transfer functions are in the form:
H(s)=Kss+K(R / L),
with K=1 for the unloaded filter and K=RL / (R+RL) for the loaded filter.
Note that the value of K for the loaded circuit reduces to the value of K for
the unloaded circuit when RL→∞; that is, when there is no load resistor.
The cutoff frequencies for both filters can be seen directly from their transfer
functions. In both cases, ωc=K(R / L), where K=1 for the unloaded circuit,
and K=RL / (R+RL) for the loaded circuit. Again, the cutoff frequency for the
loaded circuit reduces to that of the unloaded circuit when RL→∞. Because
RL / (R+RL)< 1, the effect of the load resistor is to reduce the passband
magnitude by the factor K and to lower the cutoff frequency by the same
factor.
We predicted these results at the beginning of this chapter. When the output
voltage amplitude of a passive high-pass filter is maximum, it equals the
amplitude of the filter’s input voltage. Placing a load across the filter, as we
did in Example 14.4, decreases the output voltage amplitude. If we need to
amplify signals in the passband, we must turn to active filters, such as those
discussed in Chapter 15.
The effect of a load on a filter’s transfer function poses another dilemma in
circuit design. We typically begin with a transfer function specification and
then design a filter to meet that specification. We may or may not know what
the load on the filter will be. Ideally, we want the filter’s transfer function to
remain the same regardless of the load on it, but this is not possible for the
passive filters presented here.
Figure 14.18 summarizes the high-pass filter circuits we have analyzed.
Looking at the expressions for H(s), we see that they differ only in the
denominator, which includes the cutoff frequency. As we did with the low-
pass filters in Eq. 14.6, we state a general form for the transfer function of

these two high-pass filters:

filters, the series RC and the
series RL, together with their

H(s)=ss+ωc. (14.10)
Any circuit with a voltage ratio described by Eq. 14.10 would behave as a
high-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of ωc. The problems at the end of the
chapter give you other examples of circuits with this voltage ratio.
We have drawn attention to another important relationship. We have
discovered that a series RC circuit has the same cutoff frequency whether it is
configured as a low-pass filter or as a high-pass filter. The same is true of a
series RL circuit. Given the connection between the cutoff frequency of a
filter circuit and its time constant, we should expect the cutoff frequency to
be a characteristic parameter of the circuit whose value depends only on the
circuit components, their values, and the way they are connected.

14.4 Bandpass Filters
The next filters we examine are those that pass voltages within a band of
frequencies to the output while filtering out voltages at frequencies outside
this band. These filters are somewhat more complicated than the low-pass
and high-pass filters of the previous sections. As we have already seen in Fig.
14.3(a), ideal bandpass filters have two cutoff frequencies, ωc1 and ωc2,
which identify the passband. For realistic bandpass filters, these cutoff
frequencies are again defined as the frequencies for which the magnitude of
the transfer function equals (1 / 2)Hmax.
Center Frequency, Bandwidth, and
Quality Factor
Besides the cutoff frequencies ωc1 and ωc2, three other important parameters
characterize a bandpass filter. The first is the center frequency, ωo, defined
as the frequency for which a circuit’s transfer function is purely real. Another
name for the center frequency is the resonant frequency. This is the same
name given to the frequency that characterizes the natural response of the
second-order circuits in Chapter 8 because they are the same frequencies!
When a circuit is driven at the resonant frequency, we say that the circuit is in
resonance because the frequency of the forcing function is the same as the
natural frequency of the circuit. The center frequency is the geometric center
of the passband; that is, ωo=ωc1ωc2. For bandpass filters, the magnitude of
the transfer function is maximum at the center frequency (Hmax=|H(jωo)|).
The second parameter is the bandwidth, β, which is the width of the
passband. The final parameter is the quality factor Q, which is the ratio of
the center frequency to the bandwidth. The quality factor describes the width
of the passband, independent of its location on the frequency axis. It also
describes the shape of the magnitude plot, independent of frequency.

Although five different parameters characterize bandpass filters—ωc1, ωc2,
ωo, β, and Q—only two of the five can be specified independently. That is,
once we specify any two of these parameter values, the other three can be
calculated from the dependent relationships among them. We explore these
relationships next, as we derive expressions for the five characteristic
parameters in terms of the component values for two RLC circuits that act as
bandpass filters.
The Series RLC Circuit—
Qualitative Analysis
Figure 14.19(a) depicts a series RLC circuit. We want to consider the effect
of changing the source frequency on the magnitude of the output voltage. As
before, changes to the source frequency result in changes to the impedance of
the capacitor and the inductor. This time, the qualitative analysis is somewhat
more complicated because the circuit has both an inductor and a capacitor.

At ω=0, the capacitor behaves like an open circuit, and the inductor behaves
like a short circuit. The equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 14.19(b). The open
circuit representing the capacitor impedance prevents current from reaching
the resistor, and the resulting output voltage is zero.
At ω→∞, the capacitor behaves like a short circuit, and the inductor behaves
like an open circuit. The equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 14.19(c). The
inductor now prevents current from reaching the resistor, and again the
output voltage is zero.
But what happens in the frequency region between ω=0 and ω=∞? Between
these two extremes, both the capacitor and the inductor have finite
impedances. In this region, the source voltage divides among the capacitor,
inductor, and resistor. Remember that the capacitor impedance is negative,
whereas the inductor impedance is positive. Thus, at some frequency, the
capacitor impedance and the inductor impedance have equal magnitudes and

opposite signs; the two impedances cancel out, so the output voltage equals
the source voltage. This special frequency is the center frequency, ωo. On
either side of ωo, the output voltage is less than the source voltage. Note that
at ωo, the series combination of the inductor and capacitor behaves like a
short circuit.
The frequency response plot for the circuit in Fig. 14.19(a) is shown in Fig.
14.20. The ideal bandpass filter magnitude plot is overlaid (as a dashed line)
on the transfer function magnitude plot for comparison.

Now consider what happens to the transfer function phase angle. At the
center frequency, ωo, the phase angles of the input and output voltages are
equal, so the phase angle of the transfer function is zero. As the frequency
decreases, the capacitor phase angle is larger than the inductor phase angle.
Because the capacitor contributes positive phase shift, the transfer function
phase angle is positive. At very low frequencies, the transfer function phase
angle is +90°.
Conversely, if the frequency increases from the center frequency, the inductor
phase angle is larger than the capacitor phase angle. The inductor contributes
negative phase shift, so the transfer function phase angle is negative. At very
high frequencies, the transfer function phase angle is−90°. The plot of the
transfer function phase angle is shown in Fig. 14.20.
The Series RLC Circuit—
Quantitative Analysis
We begin by drawing the s-domain equivalent for the series RLC circuit, as
shown in Fig. 14.21. Using voltage division, we find that the transfer function
equation is
Figure 14.21 The s-domain
equivalent for the circuit in Fig.
14.19(a).

Figure 14.21 Full Alternative Text
H(s)=(R/L)ss2+(R/L)s+(1/LC). (14.11)
As before, we substitute s=jω into Eq. 14.11 and produce the equations for
the magnitude and the phase angle of the transfer function:
|H(jω)| =ω(R/L)[(1/LC)−ω2]2+[ω(R/L)]2, (14.12)
θ(jω)=90∘−tan−1[ω(R/L)(1/LC)−ω2].
Now calculate the five parameters that characterize this RLC bandpass filter.
Recall that the center frequency, ωo, is defined as the frequency for which the
circuit’s transfer function is purely real. The transfer function for the RLC
circuit in Fig. 14.21 will be real when the capacitor and inductor impedances
sum to zero:
jωoL+1jωoC=0.
Solving for ωo, we get
Center Frequency
ωo=1LC.(14.13)

Next, calculate the cutoff frequencies, ωc1 and ωc2. Remember that at the
cutoff frequencies, the magnitude of the transfer function is (1 / 2)Hmax.
Because Hmax=|H(jωo)|, we find Hmax by substituting Eq. 14.13 into Eq.
14.12:
Hmax=|H(jωo)|=ωo(R / L)[(1 / LC)−ωo2]2 + (ωoR / L)2=(1 / LC)(R / L)
[(1 / LC)−(1 / LC)]2 + [(1 / LC)(R / L)]2=1.
Now set the left-hand side of Eq. 14.12 to (1 / 2)Hmax (which equals 1 / 2)
and prepare to solve for ωc:
12=ωc(R / L)[(1 / LC)−ωc2]2 + (ωcR / L)2=1[(ωcL/R)−(1/ωcRC)]2+1.
We can equate the denominators of the two sides of this expression and
simplify to get
±1=ωcLR−1ωcRC.
Rearrange to get the following quadratic equation:
ωc2±RLωc−1LC=0.
The solution of the quadratic equation yields four values for the cutoff
frequency. Only two of these values are positive and have physical
significance; they identify the passband of this filter:
Cutoff Frequencies, Series RLC
Filters
ωc1=−R2L+(R2L)2+(1LC),(14.14)
ωc2=R2L + (R2L)2+ (1LC).(14.15)
We can use Eqs. 14.14 and 14.15 to confirm that the center frequency, ωo, is
the geometric mean of the two cutoff frequencies:

Relationship Between Center
Frequency and Cutoff Frequencies
ωo=ωc1⋅ ωc2
=[−R2L+(R2L)2+(1LC)][R2L+(R2L)2+(1LC)]=1LC.
Recall that the bandwidth of a bandpass filter is defined as the difference
between the two cutoff frequencies. Because ωc2>ωc1 we can compute the
bandwidth by subtracting Eq. 14.14 from Eq. 14.15:
Relationship Between Bandwidth
and Cutoff Frequencies
β=ωc2− ωc1
=[R2L+(R2L)2+ (1LC)]− [−R2L+(R2L)2+ (1LC)],
so
Bandwidth, Series RLC Filters
β=RL.(14.16)
The quality factor, the last of the five characteristic parameters, is defined as
the ratio of center frequency to bandwidth. Using Eqs. 14.13 and 14.16:
Relationship Among Quality Factor,
Center Frequency and Bandwidth
Q=ωoβ

=1 / LC(R / L),
so
Quality Factor, Series RLC Filters
Q=LR2C.(14.17)
We now have five parameters that characterize the series RLC bandpass
filter: two cutoff frequencies, ωc1 and ωc2, which delimit the passband; the
center frequency, ωo, at which the magnitude of the transfer function is
maximum; the bandwidth, β, a measure of the width of the passband; and the
quality factor, Q, a second measure of passband width. Remember, only two
of these parameters can be specified independently in a design. We have
already observed that the quality factor is the ratio of the center frequency to
the bandwidth. We can also rewrite the equations for the cutoff frequencies in
terms of the center frequency and the bandwidth:
ωc1=−β2+(β2)2+ωo2,ωc2=β2+(β2)2+ωo2.
Alternative forms for these equations express the cutoff frequencies in terms
of the quality factor and the center frequency (see Problem 14.18):
ωc1=ωo⋅[−12Q+1+(12Q)2],ωc2=ωo⋅[12Q+1+(12Q)2].
Examples 14.5, 14.6, and 14.7 illustrate the design of bandpass filters,
introduce another RLC circuit that behaves as a bandpass filter, and examine
the effects of source resistance on the characteristic parameters of a series
RLC bandpass filter.
Example 14.5 Designing a Bandpass
Filter
A graphic equalizer is an audio amplifier that allows you to select different

levels of amplification within different frequency regions. Using the series
RLC circuit in Fig. 14.19(a), choose values for R, L, and C that yield a
bandpass circuit able to select inputs within the 1 kHz–10 kHz frequency
band. Such a circuit might be used in a graphic equalizer to select this
frequency band from the larger audio band (generally 0–20 kHz) prior to
amplification.
Solution
We need to compute values for R, L, and C that produce a bandpass filter
with cutoff frequencies of 1 kHz and 10 kHz. There are many possible
approaches to a solution. For instance, we could use Eqs. 14.14 and 14.15,
which specify ωc1 and ωc2 in terms of R, L, and C. Because of the form of
these equations, the algebraic manipulations might get complicated. Instead,
we will calculate the center frequency, ωo, from the cutoff frequencies and
then use Eq. 14.13 to compute L and C from ωo. Next we will calculate the
bandwidth, β, from the cutoff frequencies and finally, use Eq. 14.16 to
compute R from β. While this approach involves several computational steps,
each calculation is fairly simple.
Any approach we choose will provide only two equations—insufficient to
solve for the three unknowns—because of the dependencies among the
bandpass filter characteristics. Thus, we need to select a value for either R, L,
or C and use the two equations we’ve chosen to calculate the remaining
component values. Here, we arbitrarily choose 1μF as the capacitor value.
We compute the center frequency as the geometric mean of the cutoff
frequencies:
fo=fc1fc2=(1000)(10,000)=3162.28Hz.
Next, use Eq. 14.13 to find L using C and the center frequency, which must
be converted to radians/sec:
L=1ωo2C=1[ 2π(3162.28) ]2(10−6)=2.533 mH.

The bandwidth is the difference between the two cutoff frequency values, so
β=ωc2−ωc1=10,000−1000=9 kHz.
Now convert the bandwidth to radians/sec and use Eq. 14.16 to calculate R:
R=βL=[2π(9000)](2.533×10−3)=143.24 Ω.
To check whether these component values produce the bandpass filter we
want, substitute them into Eqs. 14.14 and 14.15. We find that
ωc1=6283.19rad / s (1000Hz),ωc2=62,831.85rad / s(10,000 Hz),
which are the cutoff frequencies specified for the filter.
This example reminds us that only two of the five bandpass filter parameters
can be specified independently. The other three parameters can be computed
from the two that are specified. In turn, these five parameter values depend
on the three component values, R, L, and C, of which only two can be
specified independently. It is almost always easiest to calculate the center
frequency and bandwidth from whatever two parameters are specified, and
then use Eqs. 14.13 and 14.16 to calculate the two unknown component
values.
Example 14.6 Designing a Parallel
RLC Bandpass Filter
1. Show that the RLC circuit in Fig. 14.22 is also a bandpass filter by
deriving an expression for the transfer function H(s). Note that this
circuit is a parallel RLC circuit with the parallel-connected current
source and resistor source-transformed to a series-connected voltage
source and resistor. This permits us to continue defining the filter
transfer functions as ratios of output to input voltages.

1. Compute the center frequency, ωo.
2. Calculate the cutoff frequencies, ωc1 and ωc2, the bandwidth, β, and the
quality factor, Q.
3. Compute values for R and L to yield a bandpass filter with a center
frequency of 5 kHz and a bandwidth of 200 Hz, using a 5μF capacitor.
Solution
1. Begin by transforming the circuit in Fig. 14.22 to the s domain; the
result is shown in Fig. 14.23. We can find the transfer function for the s-
domain circuit using voltage division if we first compute the equivalent
impedance of the parallel combination of L and C, identified as Zeq(s)
in Fig. 14.23:

Figure 14.23 The s-domain
equivalent of the circuit in
Fig. 14.22.
Figure 14.23 Full Alternative Text
Zeq=sL||1sC=(sL)(1/sC)sL+(1/sC)=sLs2LC+1.
Now,
H(s)=Vo(s)Vi(s)=ZeqR+Zeq=sRCs2+sRC+1LC.
2. To find the center frequency, we need to calculate the frequency for
which the transfer function magnitude is maximum. Substituting s=jω in
H(s),
|H(jω)|=ωRC(1LC−ω2)2+ (ωRC)2=11+(ωRC−1ωLR)2.
The magnitude of this transfer function is maximum when
(1LC−ω2)2=0.

Thus,
ωo=1LC
and
Hmax=|H(jωo)|=1.
3. At the cutoff frequencies, the magnitude of the transfer function is
(1 / 2)Hmax=1 / 2. Substituting this constant on the left-hand side of the
magnitude equation and simplifying, we get
[ωcRC− 1ωcLR]=±1.
Rearranging this equation once again produces two quadratic equations
for the cutoff frequencies, with four solutions. Only two of them are
positive and therefore have physical significance:
Cutoff Frequencies, Parallel RLC
Filters
ωc1=−12RC+(12RC)2+ 1LC,ωc2=12RC +(12RC)2+ 1LC.
We compute the bandwidth from the cutoff frequencies:
β=ωc2− ωc1
Bandwidth, Parallel RLC Filters
β=ωc2−ωc1=1RC.
Finally, use the definition of quality factor to calculate Q:

Quality Factor, Parallel RLC
Filters
Q=ωoβ=R2CL. 
Notice that once again we can specify the cutoff frequencies for this
bandpass filter in terms of its center frequency and bandwidth:
ωc1=−β2+(β2)2+ ωo2,
ωc2=β2+(β2)2+ ωo2.
4. Use the equation for bandwidth in (c) to compute a value for R, given
C=5μF. Remember to convert the bandwidth to radians/sec:
R=1βC=1(2π)(200)(5×10−6)=159.15 Ω.
Using the value of capacitance and the equation for center frequency in
(b), compute the inductor value:
L=1ωo2C=1[2π(5000)]2(5×10−6)=202.64 μH.
Example 14.7 Determining Effect of
a Nonideal Voltage Source on a
RLC Bandpass Filter
For each of the bandpass filters we have constructed, we have always
assumed an ideal voltage source, that is, a voltage source with no series
resistance. When we design with a filter using values of R, L, and C whose
equivalent impedance has a magnitude close to the actual impedance of the
voltage source, it is not valid to assume the voltage source is ideal. In this
example, we determine the effect of the nonzero source resistance Ri on the
series RLC bandpass filter characteristics.

1. Determine the transfer function for the circuit in Fig. 14.24.

Example 14.7.

2. Sketch the magnitude plot for the circuit in Fig. 14.24, using the values
for R, L, and C from Example 14.5 and setting Ri=R. On the same
graph, sketch the magnitude plot for the circuit in Example 14.5, where
Ri=0.
Solution
1. Begin by transforming the circuit in Fig. 14.24 into the s domain, as
shown in Fig. 14.25. Now construct the transfer function using voltage
division:

H(s)=RLss2+(R+RiL)s+1LC.
Substitute s=jω and calculate the transfer function magnitude:
|H(jω)|=RLω(1LC−ω2)2+ (ωR+RiL)2.
The center frequency, ωo, is the frequency at which this transfer
function magnitude is maximum, which is
ωo=1LC.
At the center frequency, the maximum magnitude is

Hmax=|H(jωo)|=RRi+R.
The cutoff frequencies can be computed by setting the transfer function
magnitude equal to (1 / 2)Hmax:
ωc1=− R+Ri2L+(R+Ri2L)2+ 1LC,ωc2=R+Ri2L+(R+Ri2L)2+ 1LC.
The bandwidth is calculated from the cutoff frequencies:
β=ωc2−ωc1=R+RiL.
Finally, the quality factor is computed from the center frequency and the
bandwidth:
Q=ωoβ=L/CR+Ri.
From this analysis, note that we can write the transfer function of the
series RLC bandpass filter with nonzero source resistance as
H(s)=Kβss2+βs+ωo2,
where
K=RR+Ri.
Note that when Ri=0, K=1 and the transfer function is
H(s)=βss2+βs+ωo2.
2. The circuit in Example 14.5 has a center frequency of 3162.28 Hz and a
bandwidth of 9 kHz, and Hmax=1. If we use the same values for R, L,
and C in the circuit in Fig. 14.24 and let Ri=R, then the center frequency
remains at 3162.28 kHz, but β=(R+Ri) / L=18 kHz, and
Hmax=R / (R+Ri)=1 / 2. The transfer function magnitudes for these two
bandpass filters are plotted on the same graph in Fig. 14.26.
Figure 14.26 The magnitude

plots for a series RLC
bandpass filter with a zero
source resistance and a
nonzero source resistance.
Figure 14.26 Full Alternative Text
If we compare the characteristic parameter values for the filter with Ri=0 to
the values for the filter with Ri≠0, we see the following:
The center frequencies are the same.

The maximum transfer function magnitude for the filter with Ri≠0 is
smaller than that for the filter with Ri=0.
The bandwidth for the filter with Ri≠0 is larger than that for the filter
with Ri=0. Thus, the cutoff frequencies and the quality factors for the
two circuits are also different.
Adding a nonzero source resistance to a series RLC bandpass filter leaves the
center frequency unchanged but widens the passband and reduces the
passband magnitude.
Here we see the same design challenge we saw when adding a load resistor to
the high-pass filter. We would like to design bandpass filters with filtering
properties that are unchanged by the internal resistance of the voltage source.
Unfortunately, this is not possible for filters constructed from passive
elements. In Chapter 15, we will discover that active filters are insensitive to
changes in source resistance and thus are better suited to designs in which
this is an important issue.
Figure 14.27 summarizes the two RLC bandpass filters we have studied. Note
that the expressions for the circuit transfer functions have the same form. As
we have done previously, we can create a general form for the transfer
functions of these two bandpass filters:

equations for the transfer
function, center frequency, and
bandwidth of each.

Transfer Function for Bandpass
Filters
H(s)=βss2+βs+ωo2.(14.18)
Any circuit with the transfer function in Eq. 14.18 acts as a bandpass filter
with a center frequency ωo and a bandwidth β.
In Example 14.7, we saw that the transfer function can also be written in the
form
H(s)=Kβss2+βs+ωo2,
where the values for K and β depend on whether the series resistance of the
voltage source is zero or nonzero.
Relating the Frequency Domain to
the Time Domain
It should come as no surprise that the parameters characterizing the frequency
response of RLC bandpass filters and the parameters characterizing the time
response of RLC circuits are related. Consider the series RLC circuit in Fig.
14.19(a). In Chapter 8 we discovered that the natural response of this circuit
is characterized by the neper frequency (α) and the resonant frequency (ωo).
These parameters were expressed in terms of the circuit components in Eqs.
8.29 and 8.30, which are repeated here for convenience:
α=R2L,ωo=1LC .
We see that the same parameter ωo is used to characterize both the time

response and the frequency response. That’s why the center frequency is also
called the resonant frequency. The bandwidth and the neper frequency are
related by the equation
β=2α. (14.19)
Recall that the natural response of a series RLC circuit may be underdamped,
overdamped, or critically damped. The transition from overdamped to
underdamped occurs when ωo2=α2. Consider the relationship between α and
β from Eq. 14.19 and the definition of the quality factor Q. The transition
from an overdamped to an underdamped response occurs when Q=1 / 2.
Thus, a circuit whose frequency response contains a sharp peak at ωo,
indicating a high Q and a narrow bandwidth, will have an underdamped
natural response. Conversely, a circuit whose frequency response has a broad
bandwidth and a low Q will have an overdamped natural response.

SELF-CHECK: Also try Chapter Problems 14.26 and 14.30.

14.5 Bandreject Filters
We turn now to the last of the four filter categories—the bandreject filter.
This filter passes source voltages outside the band between the two cutoff
frequencies to the output (the passband) and attenuates source voltages before
they reach the output at frequencies between the two cutoff frequencies (the
stopband). Bandpass filters and bandreject filters thus perform
complementary functions in the frequency domain.
Bandreject filters and bandpass filters have the same characteristic
parameters: the two cutoff frequencies, the center frequency, the bandwidth,
and the quality factor. Again, only two of these five parameters can be
specified independently.
We examine two circuits that function as bandreject filters and then derive
equations relating the circuit component values to the characteristic
parameters for each circuit.
The Series RLC Circuit—
Qualitative Analysis
Figure 14.28(a) shows a series RLC circuit. Although the circuit components
and connections are identical to those in the series RLC bandpass filter in
Fig. 14.19(a), the output voltage is now defined across the inductor- capacitor
pair. As we saw in the case of low- and high-pass filters, the same circuit may
perform two different filtering functions, depending on the definition of the
output voltage.

We have already noted that at ω=0, the inductor behaves like a short circuit
and the capacitor behaves like an open circuit, as shown in Fig, 14.28(b). At
ω=∞, these roles switch, as shown in Fig. 14.28(c). In both equivalent
circuits, the output voltage is defined across an open circuit, so the output and
input voltages have the same magnitude. This series RLC bandreject filter
circuit then has two passbands—one below the lower cutoff frequency and
the other above the upper cutoff frequency.
Between these two passbands, both the inductor and the capacitor have finite
impedances of opposite signs. As the frequency is increased from zero, the
inductor impedance increases and the capacitor impedance decreases.
Therefore, the phase shift between the input and the output approaches −90°
as ωL approaches 1 / ωC. As soon as ωL exceeds 1 / ωC, the phase shift

jumps to +90° and then approaches zero as ω continues to increase.
At some frequency between the two passbands, the impedances of the
inductor and capacitor are equal but have opposite signs, so their sum is zero.
Thus, at this frequency, the series combination of the inductor and capacitor
acts like a short circuit, and the output voltage magnitude is zero. This is the
center frequency of the series RLC bandreject filter.
Figure 14.29 presents a sketch of the frequency response for the series RLC
bandreject filter from Fig. 14.28(a). Note that the magnitude plot is overlaid
with that of the ideal bandreject filter from Fig. 14.3(b). Our qualitative
analysis has confirmed the shape of the magnitude and phase angle plots. We
now turn to a quantitative analysis of the circuit to confirm this frequency
response and to compute values for the parameters that characterize this
response.

After transforming to the s domain, as shown in Fig. 14.30, we use voltage
division to find the transfer function equation:

Figure 14.30 Full Alternative Text
H(s)=sL+1sCR+sL+1sC=s2+1LCs2+RLs+1LC.
Substituting jω for s in H(s), we generate equations for the transfer function
magnitude and the phase angle:
|H(jω)| =|1LC−ω2|(1LC−ω2)2+(ωRL)2,θ(jω)=−tan−1(ωRL1LC−ω2).
Note that the equations for the transfer function magnitude and phase angle

confirm the frequency response shape pictured in Fig. 14.29, which we
developed from the qualitative analysis.
We use the circuit in Fig. 14.30 to calculate the center frequency. For the
bandreject filter, the center frequency is still defined as the frequency for
which the sum of the impedances of the capacitor and inductor is zero. In the
bandpass filter, the magnitude at the center frequency was a maximum, but in
the bandreject filter, this magnitude is a minimum. This is because in the
bandreject filter, the center frequency is in the stopband, not in the passband.
Because the sum of the capacitor and inductor impedances is zero at the
center frequency,
ωo=1LC.
Substituting 1/LC for ωo in the equation for the transfer function magnitude
shows that |H(jωo)|=0.
The cutoff frequencies, the bandwidth, and the quality factor are defined and
calculated for the bandreject filter and the bandpass filter in exactly the same
way. Note that for the bandreject filter, Hmax=|H(j0)|=|H(j∞)|, and for the
series RLC bandreject filter in Fig. 14.28(a), Hmax=1. Thus,
ωc1=−R2L+(R2L)2+1LC,ωc2=R2L+(R2L)2+1LC.
These equations are the same as Eqs. 14.14 and 14.15.
Use the cutoff frequencies to generate an expression for the bandwidth, β:
β=R/L.
This equation is the same as Eq. 14.16.
Finally, the center frequency and the bandwidth produce an equation for the
quality factor, Q:
Q=LR2C.
This equation and Eq. 14.17 are the same.

Again, we can represent the expressions for the two cutoff frequencies in
terms of the bandwidth and center frequency, as we did for the bandpass
filter:
ωc1=−β2+(β2)2+ωo2,ωc2=β2+(β2)2+ωo2.
Alternative forms for these equations express the cutoff frequencies in terms
of the quality factor and the center frequency:
ωc1=ωo⋅[−12Q+1+(12Q)2],ωc2=ωo⋅[12Q+1+(12Q)2].
Example 14.8 presents the design of a series RLC bandreject filter.
Example 14.8 Designing a Series
RLC Bandreject Filter
Using the series RLC circuit in Fig. 14.28(a), compute the component values
that yield a bandreject filter with a bandwidth of 250 Hz and a center
frequency of 750 Hz. Use a 100 nF capacitor. Compute values for R, L, ωc1,
ωc2, and Q.
Solution
We begin by using the definition of quality factor to compute its value for
this filter:
Q=ωo / β=3.
Use Eq. 14.13 to compute L, remembering to convert ωo to radians per
second:
L=1ωo2C=1[2π(750)]2(100 × 10−9)=450 mH.
Use Eq. 14.16 to calculate R:

R=βL=2π(250)(450×10−3)=707 Ω.
The values for the center frequency and bandwidth can be used to compute
the two cutoff frequencies:
ωc1=−β2+(β2)2+ ωo2=3992.0 rad / s,ωc2=β2+(β2)2+ ωo2=5562.8 rad / s.
The cutoff frequencies are at 635.3 Hz and 885.3 Hz. Their difference is
885.3−635.3=250Hz, confirming the specified bandwidth. The geometric
mean is (635.3)(885.3)=750Hz, confirming the specified center frequency.
As you might suspect by now, another configuration that produces a
bandreject filter is a parallel RLC circuit. The analysis details of the parallel
RLC circuit are left to Problem 14.40, and the results are summarized in Fig.
14.31, along with the series RLC bandreject filter. As we did for other
categories of filters, we can state a general form for the transfer functions of
bandreject filters, replacing the constant terms with β and ωo:

Practical Perspective
Pushbutton Telephone Circuits
In the Practical Perspective at the start of this chapter, we described the dual-
tone-multiple-frequency (DTMF) system used to signal that a button has been
pushed on a pushbutton telephone. A key element of the DTMF system is the
DTMF receiver—a circuit that decodes the tones produced by pushing a
button and determines which button was pushed.
In order to design a DTMF receiver, we need a better understanding of the
DTMF system. As you can see from Fig. 14.32, the buttons on the telephone
are organized into rows and columns. The pair of tones generated by pushing
a button depends on the button’s row and column. The button’s row
determines its low-frequency tone, and the button’s column determines its
high-frequency tone.1 For example, pressing the “6” button produces
sinusoidal tones with the frequencies 770Hz and 1477Hz.
1A fourth high-frequency tone is reserved at 1633 Hz. This tone is used
infrequently and is not produced by a standard 12-button telephone.
Figure 14.32 Tones generated
by the rows and columns of
telephone pushbuttons.


Figure 14.32 Full Alternative Text
At the telephone switching facility, bandpass filters in the DTMF receiver
first detect whether tones from both the low-frequency and high-frequency
groups are simultaneously present. This test rejects many extraneous audio
signals that are not DTMF. If tones are present in both bands, other filters are
used to select among the possible tones in each band so that the frequencies
can be decoded, identifying a unique button. Additional tests are performed
to prevent false button detection. For example, only one tone per frequency
band is allowed; the high- and low-band frequencies must start and stop
within a few milliseconds of one another to be considered valid; and the high-
and low-band signal amplitudes must be sufficiently close to each other.
You may wonder why bandpass filters are used instead of a high-pass filter
for the high-frequency group of DTMF tones and a low-pass filter for the
low-frequency group of DTMF tones. The reason is that the telephone system
uses frequencies outside of the 300 −3kHz band for other signaling purposes,
such as ringing the phone’s bell. Bandpass filters prevent the DTMF receiver
from erroneously detecting these other signals.

Summary
A frequency selective circuit, or filter, enables signals at certain
frequencies to reach the output, and it attenuates signals at other
frequencies to prevent them from reaching the output. The passband
contains the frequencies of those signals that are passed; the stopband
contains the frequencies of those signals that are attenuated. (See page
538.)
The cutoff frequency, ωc, separates frequencies in the stopband from
frequencies in the passband. At the cutoff frequency, the magnitude of
the transfer function equals (1 / 2)Hmax. (See page 540.)
A low-pass filter passes voltages at frequencies below ωc and attenuates
frequencies above ωc. Any circuit with the transfer function
H(s)=ωcs+ωc
functions as a low-pass filter. (See page 545.)
A high-pass filter passes voltages at frequencies above ωc and
attenuates voltages at frequencies below ωc. Any circuit with the
transfer function
H(s)=ss+ωc
functions as a high-pass filter. (See page 549.)
Bandpass filters and bandreject filters each have two cutoff frequencies,
ωc1 and ωc2. These filters are further characterized by their center
frequency (ωo), bandwidth (β), and quality factor (Q). These
quantities are defined as
ωo=ωc1⋅ ωc2,β=ωc2− ωc1,Q=ωo / β.
(See pages 553 and 554.)

A bandpass filter passes voltages at frequencies within the passband,
which is between ωc1 and ωc2. It attenuates frequencies outside of the
passband. Any circuit with the transfer function
H(s)=βSs2+βS+ωo2
functions as a bandpass filter. (See page 559.)
A bandreject filter attenuates voltages at frequencies within the
stopband, which is between ωc1 and ωc2. It passes frequencies outside
of the stopband. Any circuit with the transfer function
H(s)=s2+ ωo2s2+βS+ ωo2
functions as a bandreject filter. (See page 563.)
Adding a load to the output of a passive filter changes its filtering
properties by altering the location and magnitude of the passband.
Replacing an ideal voltage source with one whose source resistance is
nonzero also changes the filtering properties of the rest of the circuit,
again by altering the location and magnitude of the passband. (See page
548 and 557.)

1. Know the op amp circuits that behave as first-order low-pass and high-
pass filters and be able to calculate component values for these circuits
to meet specifications of cutoff frequency and passband gain.
2. Be able to design filter circuits starting with a prototype circuit and use

Active filter circuits, which employ op amps, can be configured as low-pass
filters, high-pass filters, bandpass filters and bandreject filters, just like the
passive circuits we analyzed in Chapter 14. Active filter circuits have several
advantages over their passive counterparts.
Active circuits can produce bandpass and bandreject filters without
using inductors. This is advantageous because inductors are usually
large, heavy, and costly, and they can introduce electromagnetic field
effects that compromise the desired frequency response characteristics.
Active filters provide control over passband amplification that is not
available in passive filter circuits. Examine the transfer functions of all
the filter circuits from Chapter 14 and you will notice that the maximum
magnitude does not exceed 1. This is not surprising, since most of the
transfer functions in Chapter 14 were derived using voltage division.
Active filters permit us to specify both the filtering characteristics and a
passband gain, an advantage over passive filters.

Active filters can have resistive loads at their outputs whose presence
does not alter the filter characteristics due to the properties of ideal op
amps. This is another advantage of active filters, as both the cutoff
frequency and the passband magnitude of passive filters can change
when a resistive load is added at the output.
Thus, we can implement filter designs using active circuits when physical
size, passband amplification, and load variation are important parameters in
the design specifications.
In this chapter, we analyze a few of the many filter circuits that use op amps.
You will see how these op amp circuits overcome the disadvantages of
passive filter circuits. We will also combine basic op amp filter circuits to
achieve specific frequency responses and to attain a more nearly ideal filter
response. Note that throughout this chapter we assume that every op amp
behaves as an ideal op amp.
Practical Perspective
Bass Volume Control
The circuits we analyze in this chapter are frequency selective, which means
that the circuit’s behavior depends on its sinusoidal input frequency. These
filter circuits play important roles in many audioelectronic applications.

Audioelectronic systems such as radios, CD players, and home stereo
systems often provide separate volume controls labeled “treble” and “bass.”
These controls allow you to set the volume of high-frequency audio signals
(“treble”) and the volume of low-frequency audio signals (“bass”)
independently. Adjusting the amplification (boost) or attenuation (cut) in
these two frequency bands allows you to customize the sound with more
precision than you get using a single volume control.

volume control circuit composed of a single op amp together with resistors
and capacitors. An adjustable resistor controls the amplification in the bass
frequency range.

15.1 First-Order Low-Pass and
High-Pass Filters
Consider the circuit in Fig. 15.1. When the frequency of the source is varied,
only the impedance of the capacitor is affected. At very low frequencies, the
capacitor acts like an open circuit, and the op amp circuit acts like an
inverting amplifier with a gain of −R2 / R1. At very high frequencies, the
capacitor acts like a short circuit that connects the op amp’s output to ground.
The op amp circuit in Fig. 15.1 thus functions as a low-pass filter with a
passband gain of −R2 / R1.
Figure 15.1 A first-order low-
pass filter.

Figure 15.1 Full Alternative Text
To confirm this qualitative assessment, we compute the transfer function
H(s)=Vo(s) / Vi(s). Note that the circuit in Fig. 15.1 has the general form of
the circuit shown in Fig. 15.2, where the impedance in the input path (Zi) is
the resistor R1, and the impedance in the feedback path (Zf) is the parallel
combination of the resistor R2 and the capacitor impedance 1/sC.
Figure 15.2 A general op amp
circuit.

Figure 15.2 Full Alternative Text
The circuit in Fig. 15.2 has the same configuration as the inverting amplifier
circuit from Chapter 5, so its transfer function is −Zf / Zi. Therefore, the
transfer function for the circuit in Fig. 15.1 is
H(s)=−ZfZi=−R2 ||(1sC)R1=−Kωcs+ωc, (15.1)
where
K=R2R1, (15.2)
and
ωc=1R2C. (15.3)
Note that Eq. 15.1 has the same form as the general equation for low-pass
filters given in Eq. 14.6, with an important difference: the gain in the

passband, K, is set by the ratio R2 / R1. The op amp low-pass filter thus
permits the passband gain and the cutoff frequency to be specified
independently.
A Note About Frequency Response
Plots
Frequency response plots, introduced in Chapter 14, provide valuable insight
into the way a filter circuit functions. Thus, we make extensive use of
frequency response plots in this chapter, too. The frequency response plots in
Chapter 14 have two components—a plot of the transfer function magnitude
versus frequency and a plot of the transfer function phase angle, in degrees,
versus frequency. The two plots are usually stacked on top of one another so
that they can share the same frequency axis.
In this chapter, we use a special type of frequency response plot called the
Bode plot. Bode plots are discussed in detail in Appendix E, which includes
information about how to construct these plots by hand. You will probably
use a computer to construct Bode plots, so here we summarize the special
features of these plots. Bode plots differ from the frequency response plots in
Chapter 14 in two important ways.
A Bode plot uses a logarithmic axis for the frequency values instead of a
linear axis. This permits us to plot a wider range of frequencies of
interest. Normally, we plot three or four decades of frequencies, say
from 102 rad / s to 106 rad / s, or 1 kHz to 1 MHz, choosing the
frequency range where the transfer function characteristics are changing.
If we plot both the magnitude and phase angle plots, they share the
frequency axis.
The Bode magnitude is plotted in decibels (dB) versus the log of the
frequency, instead of plotting the absolute magnitude versus linear
frequency. The decibel is discussed in Appendix D. Briefly, if the
magnitude of the transfer function is |H(jω)|, its value in dB is given by

AdB=20 log10| H(jω)|.
Note that although | H(jω)| is an unsigned quantity, AdB is a signed quantity.
When AdB=0, the transfer function magnitude is 1, since 20 log10(1)=0.
When AdB< 0, the transfer function magnitude is between 0 and 1, and when
AdB>0, the transfer function magnitude is greater than 1. Finally, note that
20 log10|1 / 2 | =−3 dB.
Recall that at a filter’s cutoff frequency the transfer function’s magnitude has
been reduced from its maximum value by 1 / 2. Translating this definition to
magnitude in dB, we find that a transfer function’s magnitude at its cutoff
frequency has been reduced from its maximum magnitude by 3 dB. For
example, if the magnitude of a low-pass filter in its passband is 26 dB, the
magnitude used to find the cutoff frequency is 26−3=23 dB.
Example 15.1 illustrates the design of a first-order low-pass filter to meet
desired specifications of passband gain and cutoff frequency; it also
illustrates a Bode magnitude plot of the filter’s transfer function.
Example 15.1 Designing a Low-Pass
Op Amp Filter
Using the circuit shown in Fig. 15.1, calculate values for C and R2 that,
together with R1=1Ω, produce a low-pass filter having a gain of 1 in the
passband and a cutoff frequency of 1 rad / s. Find the transfer function for this
filter and use it to sketch a Bode magnitude plot of the filter’s frequency
response.
Solution
Equation 15.2 gives the passband gain in terms of R1 and R2, so we use it to
calculate the required value of R2:

R2=KR1=(1)(1)=1Ω.
Now use Eq. 15.3 to calculate C and satisfy the cutoff frequency
specification:
C=1R2ωc=1(1)(1)=1F.
The transfer function for the low-pass filter is given by Eq. 15.1:
H(s)=−Kωcs+ωc=−1s+1.
The Bode plot of | H(jω)| is shown in Fig. 15.3. We have just designed a
prototype low-pass op amp filter. It uses a resistor value of 1Ω and a
capacitor value of 1 F, and it has a cutoff frequency of 1 rad / s. As we shall
see in the next section, prototype filters provide a useful starting point for the
design of filters that use more realistic component values to achieve a desired
frequency response.

magnitude plot of the low-pass
filter from Example 15.1.

You may have recognized the circuit in Fig. 15.1 as the integrating amplifier
circuit introduced in Chapter 7. They are indeed the same circuit, so
integrating in the time domain corresponds to low-pass filtering in the
frequency domain. This relationship between integration and low-pass
filtering is also evident from the operational Laplace transform for integration
derived in Chapter 12.
The circuit in Fig. 15.4 is an active first-order high-pass filter. This circuit
also has the general form of the circuit in Fig. 15.2, only now the impedance
in the input path is the series combination of R1 and 1/sC , and the
impedance in the feedback path is the resistor R2. The transfer function for
the circuit in Fig 15.4 is thus
Figure 15.4 A first-order high-
pass filter.

where
K=R2R1, (15.5)
and
ωc=1R1C. (15.6)
The form of the transfer function given in Eq. 15.4 is the same as that in Eq.
14.10, the equation for passive high-pass filters. Again, the active filter can
have a passband gain greater than 1.
Example 15.2 designs an active high-pass filter that must meet frequency
response specifications from a Bode plot.

Example 15.2 Designing a High-Pass
Op Amp Filter
Figure 15.5 shows the Bode magnitude plot of a high-pass filter. Using the
active high-pass filter circuit in Fig. 15.4, calculate values of R1 and R2 that
produce the desired magnitude response. Use a 0.1 μF capacitor. If a 10 kΩ
load resistor is added to this filter, how will the magnitude response change?
Figure 15.5 The Bode
magnitude plot of the high-pass
filter for Example 15.2.


Figure 15.5 Full Alternative Text
Solution
Begin by writing a transfer function that has the magnitude plot shown in Fig.
15.5. To do this, note that the gain in the passband is 20 dB; therefore, K=10.
Also note that the 3 dB point is 500 rad/s, which must be the filter’s cutoff
frequency. Equation 15.4 is the transfer function for a high-pass filter, so the
transfer function that has the magnitude response shown in Fig. 15.5 is given
by
H(s)=−10ss+500.
Next, equate this transfer function with Eq. 15.4:
H(s)=−10ss+500=−(R2 / R1)ss+(1 / R1C).
Equating the numerators and denominators and then simplifying, we get two
equations:
10=R2R1, 500=1R1C.
Using the specified value of C (0.1 μF), we find
R1=20kΩ, R2=200 kΩ.
The circuit is shown in Fig. 15.6.
Figure 15.6 The high-pass filter
for Example 15.2.

Figure 15.6 Full Alternative Text
Because we have made the assumption that the op amp is ideal, adding any
load resistor, regardless of its resistance, has no effect on the filter circuit.
Thus, the magnitude response of a high-pass filter with a load resistor is the
same as that of a high-pass filter with no load resistor, which is depicted in
Fig. 15.5.

15.2 Scaling
When designing and analyzing filter circuits, it is convenient to use
component values like 1Ω, 1 H, and 1 F because any computations required
are simple. Unfortunately, these values are unrealistic for specifying practical
components, and they result in filters with undesirable characteristics, like a
cutoff frequency of 1 rad/s. But we can use scaling to transform the
convenient component values into realistic values and transform undesirable
filter characteristics into desirable ones. There are two types of scaling:
magnitude and frequency.
Magnitude Scaling
We scale a circuit in magnitude by multiplying the impedance at a given
frequency by the scale factor km. Thus, we multiply all resistors and
inductors by km and all capacitors by 1 / km. If we let unprimed variables
represent the initial values of the parameters, and we let primed variables
represent the scaled values of the variables, we have
R′=kmR,  L′=kmL,  and  C′=C/km.
Note that km is by definition a positive real number that can be either less
than or greater than 1.
Frequency Scaling
We scale a circuit in frequency by changing the circuit’s component values
so that at the new frequency, the impedance of each element is the same as it
was at the original frequency. Because resistive impedance is independent of
frequency, resistors are unaffected by frequency scaling. If we let kf denote
the frequency scale factor, inductor and capacitor values are both multiplied
by 1 / kf. Thus, for frequency scaling,

R′=R,  L′=L/kf,  and  C′=C/kf.
The frequency scale factor kf is also a positive real number that can be less
than or greater than 1.
A circuit can be scaled simultaneously in both magnitude and frequency. The
scaled values (primed) in terms of the original values (unprimed) are
Component Scale Factors
R ′ = k m R, L ′ = k m k f L, C ′ = 1 k m k f C. (15.7)
The Use of Scaling in the Design of
Filters
When designing filters, follow these steps to use scaling:
Select the cutoff frequency, ωc, to be 1 rad/s (if you are designing low-
or high-pass filters), or select the center frequency, ωo, to be 1 rad/s (if
you are designing bandpass or bandreject filters).
Select a 1 F capacitor and calculate the values of the resistors needed to
give the desired passband gain (if you are designing an active filter) and
the 1 rad/s cutoff or center frequency.
Use scaling to compute more realistic component values that give the
desired cutoff or center frequency.
Example 15.3 illustrates the scaling process in general, and Example 15.4
illustrates the use of scaling in the design of a low-pass filter.
Example 15.3 Scaling a Series RLC

Filter
The passive series RLC filter shown in Fig. 15.7 has a center frequency of
1 / LC=1 rad/s, a bandwidth of R / L=1 rad/s, and thus a quality factor of 1.
Use scaling to compute new values of R and L that yield a circuit with the
same quality factor but with a center frequency of 500 Hz. Use a 2 μF
capacitor.
Figure 15.7 The series RLC
circuit for Example 15.3.
Figure 15.7 Full Alternative Text
Solution

Compute the frequency scale factor that will shift the center frequency from
1 rad/s to 500 Hz. Remember, the unprimed variables represent values before
scaling, whereas the primed variables represent values after scaling.
kf=ω′oωo=2π(500)1=3141.59.
Now, use Eq. 15.7 to compute the magnitude scale factor that, together with
the frequency scale factor, will yield a capacitor value of 2 μF:
km=1kfCC′=1(3141.59)(2×10−6)=159.155.
Use Eq. 15.7 again to compute the magnitude- and frequency-scaled values
of R and L:
R′=kmR=159.155Ω,
L′=kmkfL=50.66mH.
With these component values, the center frequency of the series RLC circuit
is
1 / LC=3141.61 rad/s or 500Hz,
and the bandwidth is
R / L=3141.61 rad/s or 500Hz;
thus, the quality factor is still 1.
Example 15.4 Scaling a Prototype
Low-Pass Op Amp Filter
Use the prototype low-pass op amp filter from Example 15.1, along with
magnitude and frequency scaling, to compute the resistor values for a low-
pass filter with a gain of 5, a cutoff frequency of 1000 Hz, and a feedback
capacitor of 10 nF. Construct a Bode plot of the resulting transfer function’s
magnitude.

Solution
To begin, use frequency scaling to place the cutoff frequency at 1000 Hz:
kf=ω′c / ωc=2π(1000)/1=6283.185,
where the primed variable has the new value and the unprimed variable has
the old value of the cutoff frequency. Then compute the magnitude scale
factor that, together with kf=6283.185, will scale the capacitor to 10 nF:
km=1kfCC′=1(6283.185)(10−8)=15,915.5.
Since resistors are scaled only by using magnitude scaling,
R′1=R′2=kmR=(15,915.5)(1)=15,915.5Ω.
Finally, we need to meet the passband gain specification. We can adjust the
values of either R′1 or R′2 because K=R′2/R′1. If we adjust R′2, we will
change the cutoff frequency because ω′c=1 / R′2C′. Therefore, we can adjust
the value of R′1 to alter only the passband gain:
R′1=R′2 / K=(15,915.5) / (5)=3183.1Ω.
The final component values are
R′1=3183.1Ω, R′2=15,915.5Ω, C′=0.01μF.
The transfer function of the filter is given by
H(s)=−31,415.93s+6283.185.
The Bode plot of this transfer function’s magnitude is shown in Fig. 15.8.

15.3 Op Amp Bandpass and
Bandreject Filters
We now analyze and design op amp circuits that act as bandpass and
bandreject filters. Our initial approach is motivated by the Bode plot
construction shown in Fig. 15.9. We can see from the plot that the bandpass
filter consists of three separate elements:
A unity-gain low-pass filter whose cutoff frequency is ωc2, the larger of
the two cutoff frequencies.
A unity-gain high-pass filter whose cutoff frequency is ωc1, the smaller
of the two cutoff frequencies.
A gain component to provide the desired passband gain.
Figure 15.9 Constructing the
Bode magnitude plot of a
bandpass filter.


Figure 15.9 Full Alternative Text
These three subcircuits are cascaded in series. The subcircuit transfer
functions are multiplied to form the cascade transfer function, and the
subcircuit magnitude plots are added to create the cascade magnitude plot.
This method of constructing an active bandpass filter and its corresponding
magnitude response assumes that the lower cutoff frequency (ωc1) is
significantly smaller than the upper cutoff frequency (ωc2). The resulting
filter is called a broadband bandpass filter because the band of frequencies
passed is wide. The formal definition of a broadband filter requires that the
two cutoff frequencies satisfy the equation
ωc2ωc1≥2.
As illustrated by the Bode plot construction in Fig. 15.9, we require that the
magnitude of the high-pass filter be unity at the cutoff frequency of the low-
pass filter and that the magnitude of the low-pass filter be unity at the cutoff
frequency of the high-pass filter. Then the bandpass filter will have the cutoff
frequencies specified by the low-pass and high-pass filters. We need to
determine the relationship between ωc1 and ωc2 that will satisfy the
requirements illustrated in Fig. 15.9.
We can construct a circuit consisting of three subcircuits by cascading a low-
pass op amp filter, a high-pass op amp filter, and an inverting amplifier (see
Section 5.3), as shown in Fig. 15.10(a). Figure 15.10(a) is called a block
diagram. Each block represents a component or subcircuit, and the output of
one block is the input to the next, in the direction indicated. We want to
establish the relationship between ωc1 and ωc2 that will permit each
subcircuit to be designed independently, without concern for the other
subcircuits in the cascade. This reduces the bandpass filter design to the
design of a unity-gain first-order low-pass filter, a unity-gain first-order high-
pass filter, and an inverting amplifier, each of which is a simple circuit.

amp bandpass filter. (a) The
block diagram. (b) The circuit.
Figure 15.10 Full Alternative Text
15.3-5 Full Alternative Text
The transfer function of the cascaded bandpass filter is the product of the
transfer functions of the three cascaded subcircuits:

H( s ) = V o V i = ( − ω c2 s+ ω c2 )( −s s+ ω c1 )( − R f R i ) = −K ω c2 s (
s+ ω c1 )( s+ ω c2 ) = −K ω c2 s s 2 +( ω c1 + ω c2 )s+ ω c1 ω c2 . (15.8)
Equation 15.8 is not in the standard form for the transfer function of a
bandpass filter discussed in Chapter 14, namely,
HBP=βss2+βs+ωo2.
In order to convert Eq. 15.8 into the form of the standard transfer function for
a bandpass filter, we require that
ωc2≫ωc1
When the upper cutoff frequency is much larger than the lower cutoff
frequency,
(ωc1+ωc2)≈ωc2,
and the transfer function for the cascaded bandpass filter in Eq. 15.8 becomes
H(s)=−Kωc2ss2+ωc2s+ωc1ωc2.
Thus, if the bandpass filter specifications include an upper cutoff frequency
that is much larger than the lower cutoff frequency, we can design each
subcircuit of the cascaded circuit independently. We compute the values of
RL and CL in the low-pass filter to give us the desired upper cutoff
frequency, ωc2:
ωc2=1RLCL.
We compute the values of RH and CH in the high-pass filter to give us the
desired lower cutoff frequency,ωc1:
ωc1=1RHCH.
Now we compute the values of Ri and Rf in the inverting amplifier to provide
the desired passband gain. To do this, we consider the magnitude of the
bandpass filter’s transfer function, evaluated at the center frequency, ωo:

|  H( j ω o )  |  = | −K ω c2 ( j ω o ) ( j ω o ) 2 +  ω c2 ( j ω o )+ ω c1 ω c2 | = K
ω c2 ω c2 = K.
Recall from Chapter 5 that the gain of the inverting amplifier is Rf / Ri.
Therefore,
|H(jωo)|=RfRi.
Any choice of resistors that satisfies this equation will produce the desired
passband gain.
Example 15.5 illustrates the design process for the cascaded bandpass filter.
Example 15.5 Designing a
Broadband Bandpass Op Amp
Filter
Design a bandpass filter for a graphic equalizer to provide an amplification of
2 within the band of frequencies between 100 and 10,000 Hz. Use 0.2 μF
capacitors.
Solution
We can design each subcircuit in the cascade and meet the specified cutoff
frequency values only if the upper cutoff frequency is much larger than the
lower cutoff frequency. In this case, ωc2=100ωc1, so we can say that
ωc2≫ωc1. Begin with the low-pass filter, whose cutoff frequency is ωc2.
From Eq. 15.3,
ω c2 = 1 R L C L =2π( 10000 ), R L = 1 [ 2π( 10000 ) ]( 0.2× 10 −6 ) ≈ 80Ω.
Next, we turn to the high-pass filter, whose cutoff frequency is ωc2. From
Eq. 15.6,

ω c1 = 1 R H C H =2π( 100 ), R H = 1 [ 2π( 100 ) ]( 0.2× 10 −6 ) ≈ 7958Ω.
Finally, we need the gain stage. Two resistors are required, so one of the
resistors can be selected arbitrarily. Let’s select a 1 kΩ resistor for Ri. Then,
R f = 2( 1000 ) = 2000Ω = 2kΩ.
The resulting circuit is shown in Fig. 15.11. We leave it to you to show that
the magnitude of this circuit’s transfer function is reduced by 1 / 2 from its
maximum value at both cutoff frequencies, verifying the validity of the
assumption ωc2≫ωc1.

We can use a subcircuit approach when designing op amp bandreject filters,
too, as illustrated in Fig. 15.12. Like the bandpass filter, the bandreject filter
consists of three separate elements.

A summing amplifier that provides the desired gain in the passbands.
There are important differences between the three subcircuits that comprise
the bandpass filter and those that comprise the bandreject filter. The cutoff
frequencies of the low-pass and high-pass filters are obviously different—in
the bandpass filter, the low-pass filter subcircuit has a cutoff frequency of
ωc2, and in the bandreject filter, the low-pass filter subcircuit has a cutoff
frequency of ωc1. The cutoff frequencies for the high-pass filter subcircuit
are also reversed. The most important difference is that the three subcircuits
in the bandreject filter cannot be cascaded in series because they do not
combine additively on the Bode plot. Instead, the low-pass and high-pass
filters act in parallel, and a summing amplifier combines their outputs and
provides the passband gain. Figure 15.13 shows this design both in block
diagram form and as a circuit.

Again, it is assumed that the two cutoff frequencies for the bandreject filter
are widely separated so that the resulting design is a broadband bandreject
filter, and ωc2≫ωc1. Then each subcircuit in the parallel design can be
created independently, and the cutoff frequency specifications will be
satisfied. The transfer function of the resulting circuit is the sum of the low-
pass and high-pass filter transfer functions. From Fig. 15.13(b),
H( s ) = ( − R f R i )[ − ω c1 s+ ω c1 + −s s+ ω c2 ] = R f R i ( ω c1 ( s+ ω c2
)+s( s+ ω c1 ) ( s+ ω c1 )( s+ ω c2 ) ) = R f R i ( s 2 +2 ω c1 s+ ω c1 ω c2 (s+
ω c1 )(s+ ω c2 ) ). (15.9)
As we saw in the cascaded bandpass filter design, the two cutoff frequencies
for the transfer function in Eq. 15.9 are ωc1 and ωc2 only if ωc2≫ωc1. Then
the cutoff frequencies are given by the equations
ω c1 = 1 R L C L , ω c2 = 1 R H C H .
In the two passbands (as s→0 and s→∞), the gain of the transfer function is
Rf / Ri. Therefore,
K=RfRi.
As with the design of the cascaded bandpass filter, we have six unknowns
and three equations. Typically, we choose a commercially available capacitor
value for CL and CH. Then we use the equations for the cutoff frequencies of
the low-pass and high-pass filters, calculating RL and RH to meet the
specified cutoff frequencies. Finally, we choose a value for either Rf or Ri
and then use the equation for K to compute the other resistance to meet the
passband gain specification.
The magnitude of the transfer function in Eq. 15.9 at the center frequency,
ωo=ωc1ωc2, is
| H(j ω o ) |  = | R f R i ( (j ω o ) 2 +2 ω c1 (j ω o )+ ω c1 ω c2 (j ω o ) 2 +( ω
c1 + ω c2 )(j ω o )+ ω c1 ω c2 ) | = R f R i 2 ω c1 ω c1 + ω c2 ≈ R f R i 2 ω
c1 ω c2 .
If ωc2≫ωc1, then |H(jωo)|≪2Rf/Ri (because ωc1/ωc2≪1), so the magnitude

at the center frequency is much smaller than the passband magnitude. Thus,
the bandreject filter successfully rejects frequencies near the center frequency
but only if the specifications meet the requirements of a broadband filter.
Example 15.6 illustrates the design process for the parallel bandreject filter.

15.13(b). The Bode magnitude plot of the filter is shown in Fig. 15.14. Use
0.5 μF capacitors in your design.
Figure 15.14 The Bode
magnitude plot for the circuit
to be designed in Example 15.6.


Figure 15.14 Full Alternative Text
Solution
From the Bode magnitude plot in Fig. 15.14, we see that the bandreject
filter’s cutoff frequencies are 100 rad/s and 2000 rad/s and its passband gain
is 3. Thus, ωc2=20ωc1, so we make the assumption that ωc2≫ωc1. Let’s
begin with the prototype low-pass filter from Example 15.1 and use scaling to
meet the specifications for cutoff frequency and capacitor value. The
frequency scale factor kf is 100, which shifts the cutoff frequency from
1 rad/s to100 rad/s. The magnitude scale factor km is 20,000, which, together
with the frequency scale factor, scales the capacitor from 1 F to 0.5 μF. Using
these scale factors results in the following scaled component values:
R L = 20 kΩ, C L = 0.5 μF.
The resulting cutoff frequency of the low-pass filter component is
ωc1=1RLCL=1(20×103)(0.5×10−6)=100 rad/s.
We use the same approach to design the high-pass filter, starting with the
prototype high-pass op amp filter. Here, the frequency scale factor is
kf=2000, shifting the cutoff frequency from 1  rad/s  to 2000  rad/s . The
magnitude scale factor is km=1000, which, together with the frequency scale
factor, scales the capacitor from 1 F to 0.5 μF. The scaled component values
are
R H = 1kΩ, C H = 0.5μF.
Finally, because the cutoff frequencies are widely separated, we can use the
ratio Rf / Ri to create the passband gain of 3. Let’s choose Ri=1 kΩ, as we are
already using that resistance for RH. Then Rf=3 kΩ, and
K=Rf/Ri=3000/1000=3. The resulting active broadband bandreject filter
circuit is shown in Fig. 15.15.

bandreject filter circuit

Now let’s check our assumption that ωc2≫ωc1 by calculating the actual gain
at the specified cutoff frequencies. We do this by making the substitutions
s=j100 and s=j2000 into the transfer function for the parallel bandreject filter,
Eq. 15.9, and calculating the resulting magnitude. You should verify that the
magnitude at the specified cutoff frequencies is greater than the magnitude of
3 / 2=2.12 that we expect. Therefore, our rejecting band is more narrow than
specified in the problem statement.

Problems 15.30 and 15.31.

15.4 Higher-Order Op Amp Filters
None of the filter circuits we have examined so far, whether passive or active,
are ideal. Remember from Chapter 14 that an ideal filter has a discontinuity at
the cutoff frequency, which sharply divides the passband and the stopband.
Although we cannot hope to construct a linear circuit with a discontinuous
frequency response, we can construct circuits with a sharper, yet still
continuous, transition at the cutoff frequency.
Cascading Identical Filters
How can we obtain a sharper transition between the passband and the
stopband? One approach is suggested by the Bode magnitude plots in Fig.
15.16. This figure shows the Bode magnitude plots of a cascade of identical
prototype low-pass filters and includes plots of a single filter, two in cascade,
three in cascade, and four in cascade. You can see that the transition from the
passband to the stopband becomes sharper as more filters are added to the
cascade. The rules for constructing Bode plots (from Appendix E) tell us that
with one filter, the transition occurs with an asymptotic slope of 20 decibels
per decade (dB/dec). Because circuits in cascade are additive on a Bode
magnitude plot, a cascade with two filters has a transition with an asymptotic
slope of 20+20=40 dB / dec; for three filters, the asymptotic slope is
60 dB/dec, and for four filters, it is 80 dB/dec, as seen in Fig. 15.16.
Figure 15.16 The Bode
magnitude plot of a cascade of
identical prototype first-order
filters.


Figure 15.16 Full Alternative Text
In general, an n-element cascade of identical low-pass filters will transition
from the passband to the stopband with a slope of 20 ndB / dec. Figure 15.17
shows both the block diagram and the circuit diagram for such a cascade. We
compute the transfer function for a cascade of n prototype low-pass filters by
multiplying the individual transfer functions:

identical unity-gain low-pass
filters. (a) The block diagram.

15.4-5 Full Alternative Text
H( s ) = ( −1 s+1 )( −1 s+1 )⋯( −1 s+1 ) = (−1) n (s+1) n . (15.10)
A cascade of first-order low-pass filters yields a higher-order filter. From Eq.
15.10, a cascade of n first-order filters produces an nth-order filter because
the transfer function has n poles, and the filter has a final slope of 20n dB/dec
in the transition band.
There is an important issue yet to be resolved, as you will see if you look
closely at Fig. 15.16. As the order of the low-pass filter is increased by
adding prototype low-pass filters to the cascade, the cutoff frequency
changes. For example, in a cascade of two first-order low-pass filters, the
magnitude of the resulting second-order filter at 1 rad/s, the cutoff frequency
of the single prototype low-pass filer, is−6dB. The cutoff frequency of the
second-order filter is not 1 rad/s. In fact, the cutoff frequency is less than
1 rad/s.
Therefore, we need to find the cutoff frequency of the nth-order filter formed
in the cascade of n first-order filters. Then we can use frequency scaling to
calculate component values that move the cutoff frequency to its specified

location. The cutoff frequency, ωcn, satisfies the equation |H(jω)| =1 / 2:
H( s ) = ( −1 ) n ( s+1 ) n , |  H( j ω cn ) |  = | 1 ( j ω cn + 1 ) n |= 1 2 , 1 ( ω cn
2 + 1 ) n = 1 2 , 1 ω cn 2 +1 = ( 1 2 ) 2/n , 2 n = ω cn 2 + 1, ω cn = 2 n −1.
(15.11)
Let’s use Eq. 15.11 to find the cutoff frequency of a fourth-order unity-gain
low-pass filter constructed from a cascade of four prototype low-pass filters:
ωc4=24−1=0.435 rad/s.
Thus, we can design a fourth-order low-pass filter with the cutoff frequency
ωc by starting with a fourth-order cascade consisting of prototype low-pass
filters and then scaling the components by kf=ωc / 0.435.
We can build a higher-order low-pass filter with a nonunity gain by adding an
inverting amplifier circuit to the cascade. Example 15.7 illustrates the design
of a fourth-order low-pass filter with nonunity gain.
Example 15.7 Designing a Fourth-
Order Low-Pass Active Filter
Design a fourth-order low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 500 Hz and a
passband gain of 10. Use 1 μF capacitors. Sketch the Bode magnitude plot for
this filter.
Solution
Our design cascades four prototype low-pass filters. We have already used
Eq. 15.11 to calculate the cutoff frequency for the resulting fourth-order low-
pass filter as 0.435 rad/s. A frequency scale factor of kf=7222.39 will scale
the component values to give a 500 Hz cutoff frequency. A magnitude scale
factor of km=138.46, together with the frequency scale factor, scales the
capacitor value from 1 F to 1 μF. The scaled component values are thus

R=138.46Ω;  C=1μF.
Add an inverting amplifier stage with a gain of Rf/Ri=10 to satisfy the
passband gain specification. As usual, we can arbitrarily select one of the two
resistor values. Because we are already using 138.46Ω resistors, let
Ri=138.46Ω; then,
Rf=10Ri=1384.6Ω.
The circuit for this cascaded fourth-order low-pass filter is shown in Fig.
15.18. It has the transfer function

magnitude plot for the fourth-
order low-pass filter designed

Figure 15.19 Full Alternative Text
By cascading identical low-pass filters, we can increase the asymptotic slope
in the transition between passband and stopband, but our approach has a
serious shortcoming: The gain of the filter is not constant between zero and
the cutoff frequency ωc. Remember that in an ideal low-pass filter, the
passband magnitude is 1 for all frequencies below the cutoff frequency. But
in Fig. 15.16, we see that the passband magnitude is less than 1 (0 dB), even
for frequencies much less than the cutoff frequency.
We can understand why the passband magnitude is not ideal by looking at the
magnitude of the transfer function for a unity-gain low-pass nth-order
cascade. Because
H(s)=ωcnn(s+ωcn)n,
the magnitude is
|  H( jω ) | = ω cn n ( ω 2 +  ω cn 2 ) n = 1 ( ( ω/ ω cn ) 2 +1 ) n .
As we can see from this expression, when ω≪ωcn, the denominator is
approximately 1, and the magnitude of the transfer function is also nearly 1.
But as ω→ωcn, the denominator becomes larger than 1, so the magnitude
becomes smaller than 1. Because the cascade of low-pass filters results in this
nonideal behavior in the passband, other approaches are used when designing
higher-order filters. One such approach is examined next.
Butterworth Filters
A unity-gain Butterworth low-pass filter has a transfer function whose
magnitude is
| H(jω) |= 1 1+ ( ω/ ω c ) 2n , (15.12)
where n is an integer that denotes the order of the filter.1

1This filter was developed by the British engineer S. Butterworth and
reported in Wireless Engineering 7 (1930): 536–541.
When studying Eq. 15.12, note the following:
The cutoff frequency is ωc rad/s for all values of n.
If n is large enough, the denominator is always close to unity when
ω<ωc.
In the expression for | H(jω)|, the exponent of ω / ωc is always even.
This last observation is important because only even exponents exist in
circuits with resistors, inductors, capacitors and op amps. (See Problem
15.33.)
Given an equation for the magnitude of the transfer function, how do we find
H(s)? We can simplify the derivation for H(s) by using a prototype filter, so
we set ωc equal to 1 rad/s in Eq. 15.12. As before, we will use scaling to
transform the prototype filter to a filter that meets the given specifications.
To find H(s), first note that if N is a complex quantity, then | N |2=NN*,
where N* is the conjugate of N. It follows that
|H(jω)|2=H(jω) H(−jω).
But because s=jω, we can write
|H(jω)|2=H(s) H(−s).
Now observe that s2=−ω2. Thus,
| H( jω ) | 2 = 1 1+ ω 2n = 1 1+ ( ω 2 ) n = 1 1+ ( − s 2 ) n = 1 1+ ( −1 ) n s 2n
,
or
H(s) H(−s)=11+(−1)ns2n.

Follow these steps to find H(s) for a given value of n:
1. Find the roots of the polynomial
1+(−1)ns2n=0.
2. Assign the left-half plane roots to H(s) and the right-half plane roots to
H(−s).
3. Combine terms in the denominator of H(s) to form first- and second-
order factors.
Example 15.8 illustrates this process.
Example 15.8 Calculating
Butterworth Transfer Functions
Find the Butterworth transfer functions for n=2 and n=3.
Solution
For n=2, we find the roots of the polynomial
1+(−1)2s4=0.
Rearranging terms, we find
s 4 =−1=1 180 ∘ .
Therefore, the four roots are
s 1 = 1 45 ∘ = 1 /  2 +j /  2 , s 2 = 1 135 ∘ = −1 /  2  +j /  2 , s 3 = 1 225 ∘ =
−1 /  2 + −j /  2 , s 4 = 1 315 ∘ = 1 /  2 +−j /  2 .
Roots s2 and s3 are in the left-half plane. Thus,

H( s ) = 1 ( s+1 /  2 −j /  2 )( s+1 /  2 +j /  2 ) = 1 ( s 2 + 2 s+ 1 ) .
For n=3, we find the roots of the polynomial
1+(−1)3s6=0.
Rearranging terms,
s6=10∘=1360∘.
Therefore, the six roots are
s 1 = 1 0 ∘ = 1, s 2 = 1 60 ∘ = 1 / 2+j 3  / 2, s 3 = 1 120 ∘ = −1 / 2+j 3  / 2, s
4 = 1 180 ∘ = −1 + j0, s 5 = 1 240 ∘ = −1 / 2+−j 3  / 2, s 6 = 1 300 ∘ =
1 / 2 + −j 3  / 2.
Roots s3, s4, and s5 are in the left-half plane. Thus,
H( s ) = 1 ( s+1 )( s+1 / 2−j 3  / 2 )( s+1 / 2+j 3  / 2 ) = 1 ( s+1 )( s 2 +s+1 ) .
Note that the roots of the Butterworth polynomial are always equally spaced
around the unit circle in the s plane. To assist in the design of Butterworth
filters, Table 15.1 lists the Butterworth polynomials up to n=8.

Butterworth Filter Circuits
Now that we know how to specify the transfer function for a Butterworth
filter circuit (either by calculating the poles of the transfer function directly or
by using Table 15.1), we need to design a circuit with such a transfer
function. Notice the form of the Butterworth polynomials in Table 15.1. They
are the product of first- and second-order factors; therefore, we can construct
a circuit whose transfer function has a Butterworth polynomial in its
denominator by cascading active filter circuits, each of which provides one of
the needed factors. Figure 15.20 presents a block diagram of a cascade whose
transfer function has a fifth-order Butterworth polynomial in its denominator.

and second-order circuits with
the indicated transfer functions

Butterworth filter with

Figure 15.20 Full Alternative Text
All odd-order Butterworth polynomials include the factor (s+1), so all odd-
order Butterworth filter circuits must have a subcircuit with the transfer
function H(s)=1/(s+1). This is the transfer function of the prototype low-pass
active filter from Fig. 15.1. So what remains is to find a circuit whose transfer
function has the form H(s)=1/(s2+ b1s+1).
Such a circuit is shown in Fig. 15.21. To analyze this circuit, write the s-
domain KCL equations at the noninverting terminal of the op amp and at the
node labeled Va:
V a − V i R +( V a − V o )s C 1 + V a − V o R = 0, V o s C 2 + V o − V a R =
0.

transfer function for the

Figure 15.21 Full Alternative Text
Simplifying the two KCL equations yields
(2+RC1s)Va−(1+RC1s)Vo=Vi,
−Va+(1+RC2s)Vo=0.
Use back-substitution to eliminate Va:
(2+RC1s)(1+RC2s)Vo−(1+RC1s)Vo=Vi.
Then, rearrange this equation to write the transfer function for the circuit in
Fig. 15.21:
H(s)=VoVi=1R2C1C2s2+2RC1s+1R2C1C2.
Finally, set R=1Ω; then
H(s)=1C1C2s2+2C1s+1C1C2. (15.13)

Equation 15.13 has the form required for the second-order circuit in the
Butterworth cascade. To get a transfer function of the form
H(s)=1s2+b1s+1,
we use the circuit in Fig. 15.21 and choose capacitor values so that
b1=2C1and 1=1C1C2. (15.14)
We have thus outlined the procedure for designing an nth-order Butterworth
low-pass filter circuit with a cutoff frequency of ωc=1 rad/s and a gain of 1 in
the passband. We can use frequency scaling to calculate revised capacitor
values that yield any specified cutoff frequency, and we can use magnitude
scaling to provide more realistic or practical component values in our design.
Cascading an inverting amplifier circuit provides a passband gain other than
1.
Example 15.9 illustrates this design process.
Example 15.9 Designing a Fourth-
Order Low-Pass Butterworth Filter
Design a fourth-order Butterworth low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of
500 Hz and a passband gain of 10. Use as many 1kΩ resistors as possible.
Compare the Bode magnitude plot for this Butterworth filter with that of the
identical cascade filter in Example 15.7.
Solution
From Table 15.1, we find that the fourth-order Butterworth polynomial is
(s2+0.765s+1)(s2+1.848s+1).
We will thus need a cascade of two second-order filters to get the fourth-

order transfer function and an inverting amplifier circuit to get a passband
gain of 10. The circuit is shown in Fig. 15.22.
Figure 15.22 A fourth-order
Butterworth filter with
nonunity gain.
Figure 15.22 Full Alternative Text
The first stage of the cascade is a circuit whose transfer function has the
polynomial (s2+0.765s+1) in its denominator. From Eq. 15.14,

c 1a = 2 0.765 = 2.61F, c 2a = 1 2.61 = 0.38F.
The second stage of the cascade is a circuit whose the transfer function has
the polynomial (s2+1.848s+1) in its denominator. From Eq. 15.14,
C 1b = 2 1.848 = 1.08F, C 2b = 1 1.08 = 0.924F.
These values for C1a, C2b, C1b, and C2b yield a fourth-order Butterworth
filter with a cutoff frequency of 1 rad/s. A frequency scale factor of
kf=3141.6 will move the cutoff frequency to 500 Hz. A magnitude scale
factor of km=1000 allows us to use 1 kΩ resistors in place of 1 Ω resistors.
The resulting scaled component values are
R = 1 kΩ, C 1 = 831 nF, C 2 = 121 nF, C 3 = 344 nF, C 4 = 294 nF.
Finally, we need to specify the resistor values in the inverting amplifier stage
to yield a passband gain of 10. Let R1=1 kΩ; then
Rf=10R1=10kΩ.
Figure 15.23 compares the magnitude responses of the fourth-order identical
cascade filter from Example 15.7 and the Butterworth filter we just designed.
Note that both filters provide a passband gain of 10 (20 dB) and a cutoff
frequency of 500 Hz, but the Butterworth filter is closer to an ideal low-pass
filter due to its flatter passband and steeper rolloff at the cutoff frequency.
Thus, the Butterworth design is preferred to the identical cascade design.

the magnitude responses for a

The Order of a Butterworth Filter
You have probably noticed that the higher the order of the Butterworth filter,
the closer the transfer function magnitude is to that of an ideal low-pass filter.
In other words, as n increases, the magnitude stays close to unity in the
passband, the transition band narrows, and the magnitude stays close to zero
in the stopband. At the same time, as the order increases, the number of
circuit components increases. Thus, when designing a filter, determining the
smallest value of n that will meet the filtering specifications is an important
first step.
The filtering specifications for a low-pass filter usually define the abruptness
of the transition region, as shown in Fig. 15.24. Once Ap, ωp, As, and ωs are
specified, the order of the Butterworth filter can be determined.
Figure 15.24 Defining the
transition region for a low-pass
filter.

Figure 15.24 Full Alternative Text
For the Butterworth filter,
Ap=20 log1011+ωp2n=−10log10(1+ωp2n),
As=20 log1011+ωs2n=−10log10(1+ωs2n).

It follows from the definition of the logarithm that
10−0.1Ap=1+ωp2n,
10−0.1As=1+ωs2n.
Now, solve for ωpn and ωsn and find the ratio (ωs / ωp)n. We get
(ωsωp)n=10−0.1As−110−0.1Ap−1=σsσp,
where the symbols σs and σp have been introduced for convenience.
From the expression for σs/σp we can write
n log10(ωs / ωp)=log10(σs / σp),
or
n=log10(σs/σp)log10(ωs/ωp). (15.15)
We can simplify Eq. 15.15 if ωp is the cutoff frequency because then Ap
equals −20log102, and σp=1. Hence
n=log10σslog10(ωs/ωp).
One further simplification is possible. We are using a Butterworth filter to
achieve a steep transition region. Therefore, the filtering specification will
make 10−0.1As≫1. Thus
σs≈10−0.05As,
log10σs≈−0.05As.
Therefore, a good approximation for the calculation of n is
n=−0.05Aslog10(ωs/ωp). (15.16)
Note that ωs / ωp=fs / fp, so we can work with frequencies specified in either
radians per second or hertz to calculate n.
The order of the filter must be an integer; hence, in using either Eq. 15.15 or

Eq. 15.16, we select the nearest integer value greater than the result given by
the equation. Examples 15.10 and 15.11 illustrate the use of Eqs. 15.15 and
15.16.
Example 15.10 Determining the

1000 Hz and a gain of no more than −50 dB at 6000 Hz.
2. What is the actual gain in dB at 6000 Hz?
Solution
1. Because the cutoff frequency is specified, we know σp=1. We also note
from the specification that 10−0.1(−50) is much greater than 1. Hence,
we can use Eq. 15.16 with confidence:
n=(−0.05)(−50)log10(6000 / 1000)=3.21.
Therefore, we need a fourth-order Butterworth filter.
2. We can use Eq. 15.12 to calculate the actual gain at 6000 Hz. The gain
in decibels will be
K=20 log10(11+68)=−62.25dB.
Example 15.11 An Alternate
Approach to Determining the Order
of a Butterworth Filter

1. Determine the order of a Butterworth filter whose magnitude is 10 dB
less than the passband magnitude at 500 Hz and at least 60 dB less than
the passband magnitude at 5000 Hz.
2. Determine the cutoff frequency of the filter (in hertz).
3. What is the actual gain of the filter (in decibels) at 5000 Hz?
Solution
1. Because the cutoff frequency is not given, we use Eq. 15.15 to
determine the order of the filter:
σ p = 10 −0.1( −10 ) −1 = 3, σ s = 10 −0.1( −60 ) −1 ≈ 1000, ω s  /  ω p =
f s  /  f p =5000 / 500 = 10, n = log 10 ( 1000 / 3 ) log 10 ( 10 ) = 2.52.
Therefore, we need a third-order Butterworth filter to meet the
specifications.
2. Knowing that the gain at 500 Hz is −10 dB, we can determine the cutoff
frequency. From Eq. 15.12 we can write
−10 log10[1+(ω / ωc)6]=−10,
where ω=1000π rad/s. Therefore
1+(ω / ωc)6=10,
and
ω c = ω 9 6 = 2178.26 rad / s.
It follows that
fc=346.68 Hz.
3. The actual gain of the filter at 5000 Hz is

K = −10  log 10 [ 1+ ( 5000 / 346.68 ) 6 ] = −69.54 dB.
Butterworth High-Pass, Bandpass,
and Bandreject Filters
An nth-order Butterworth high-pass filter has a transfer function with the nth-
order Butterworth polynomial in the denominator, just like the nth-order
Butterworth low-pass filter. But in the high-pass filter, the numerator of the
transfer function is sn, whereas in the low-pass filter, the numerator is 1.
Again, we use a cascade approach in designing the Butterworth high-pass
filter. The first-order factor is achieved by including a prototype high-pass
filter (Fig. 15.4, with R1=R2=1Ω, and C=1 F) in the cascade.
To produce the second-order factors in the Butterworth polynomial, we need
a circuit with a transfer function of the form
H(s)=s2s2+b1s+ 1.
Such a circuit is shown in Fig. 15.25.
Figure 15.25 A second-order
Butterworth high-pass filter
circuit.

Figure 15.25 Full Alternative Text
This circuit has the transfer function
H(s)=VoVi=s2s2+2R2Cs+1R1R2C2.
Setting C=1 F yields
H(s)=s2s2+2R2s+1R1R2. (15.17)
Thus, we can realize any second-order factor in a Butterworth polynomial of
the form (s2+b1s+1) by including in the cascade the second-order circuit in
Fig. 15.25 with resistor values that satisfy Eq. 15.18:
b1=2R2and 1=1R1R2. (15.18)
At this point, we pause to make a couple of observations about the circuits in
Figs. 15.21 and 15.25 and their prototype transfer functions 1 / (s2+ b1s+1)
and s2 / (s2+ b1s+1).

The high-pass circuit in Fig. 15.25 was obtained from the low-pass
circuit in Fig. 15.21 by interchanging resistors and capacitors.
The prototype transfer function of a high-pass filter can be obtained
from that of a low-pass filter by replacing s in the low-pass expression
with 1/s (see Problem 15.46).
These observations are important because they are true in general.
We can use frequency and magnitude scaling to design a Butterworth high-
pass filter with practical component values and a cutoff frequency other than
1 rad / s. Adding an inverting amplifier to the cascade will accommodate
designs with nonunity passband gains. The problems at the end of the chapter
include several Butterworth high-pass filter designs.
Now that we can design both nth-order low-pass and high-pass Butterworth
filters with arbitrary cutoff frequencies and passband gains, we can combine
these filters in cascade (as we did in Section 15.3) to produce nth-order
Butterworth bandpass filters. We can combine these filters in parallel with a
summing amplifier (again, as we did in Section 15.3) to produce nth-order
Butterworth bandreject filters. Example 15.12 illustrates the design of a
Butterworth bandpass filter.
Example 15.12 Designing a
Butterworth Bandpass Filter
Design the bandpass filter from Example 15.5 using a cascade of a fourth-
order low-pass Butterworth filter, a fourth-order high-pass Butterworth filter,
and an inverting amplifier. The filter should provide an amplification of 2
within the band of frequencies between 100 and 10,000 Hz and use as many
2 kΩ resistors and 0.2 μF capacitors as possible.
Solution

The circuit is shown in Fig. 15.26. The first two stages in the cascade form
the fourth-order low-pass Butterworth filter, which should have a cutoff
frequency of 10,000 Hz. We have already designed the prototype fourth-
order low-pass Butterworth filter in Example 15.9, so R=1 Ω and
C 1a = 2.61 F, C 2a = 0.38 F, C 1b = 1.08 F, C 2b = 0.924 F.

Butterworth bandpass filter for
Example 15.12.


Figure 15.26 Full Alternative Text
This prototype low-pass filter has a cutoff frequency of 1  rad/s , so to move
the cutoff frequency to 10,000 Hz we need a frequency scale factor
kf=20,000π. To use 2 kΩ resistors, we need to scale the 1 Ω resistors using a
magnitude scale factor km=2000. The scaled capacitor values are
C 1a = 20.77 nF, C 2a = 3.02 nF, C 1 b = 8.59 nF, C 2b = 7.35 nF.
The next two stages in the cascade form the fourth-order high-pass
Butterworth filter, which should have a cutoff frequency of 100 Hz. To
design the prototype filter, let C=1 F. The first stage of the prototype high-
pass filter must have a transfer function whose denominator is the
Butterworth polynomial (s2+0.765 s+1). From Eq. 15.18,
R 2a = 2 0.765 =2.61 Ω,   R 1a = 1 R 2a = 1 2.61 =0.38 Ω.
The second stage of the prototype high-pass filter must have a transfer
function whose denominator is the Butterworth polynomial (s2+1.848 s+1).
From Eq. 15.18,
R 2b = 2 1.848 =1.08 Ω,   R 1b = 1 R 2b = 1 1.08 =0.924 Ω.
This prototype high-pass filter has a cutoff frequency of 1  rad/s , so to move
the cutoff frequency to 100 Hz, we need a frequency scale factor kf=200π. To
use 0.2 μF capacitors, we need a magnitude scale factor km=7957.747. The
scaled resistor values are
R 1a = 3023.94 Ω, R 2a = 20,769.72 Ω, R 1 b = 7352.96 Ω, R 2b = 8594.37 
Ω.
The final stage of the cascade in Fig. 15.26 is the inverting amplifier, which
must have a gain of 2. Let’s use R=2 kΩ, so Rf=2R=4 kΩ.

15.5 Narrowband Bandpass and
Bandreject Filters
We can only implement broadband or low-Q bandpass and bandreject filters
when using the cascade and parallel subcircuit designs from the previous
sections. This limitation is due principally to the form of the transfer
functions for cascaded bandpass and parallel bandreject filters—they only
have discrete real poles. The largest quality factor we can achieve with
discrete real poles arises when the cutoff frequencies, and thus the pole
locations, are the same. As an example, consider the transfer function for a
bandpass filter created from a cascade of a first-order low-pass filter and a
first-order high-pass filter, where both filters have the same cutoff frequency:
H( s ) = ( − ω c s+ ω c )( −s s+ ω c ) = s ω c s 2 +2 ω c s+  ω c 2 = 0.5βs s 2
+βs+ ω c 2 .
This equation is in the standard form of the transfer function of a bandpass
filter, and thus we can determine the bandwidth and center frequency
directly:
β = 2 ω c , ω o 2 = ω c 2 .
From the equations for bandwidth and center frequency and the definition of
Q, we see that
Q=ωoβ=ωc2ωc=12.
Thus, with discrete real poles, the highest quality bandpass filter (or
bandreject filter) we can achieve has Q=1 / 2.
To build active filters with high-quality factor values, we need an op amp
circuit whose transfer function has complex conjugate poles. Figure 15.27
depicts one such circuit for us to analyze. At the inverting input of the op
amp, write a KCL equation to get

Va1 / sC=−VoR3.
Figure 15.27 An active high-Q
bandpass filter.
Figure 15.27 Full Alternative Text
Solving for Va,
Va=−VosR3C.
At the node labeled Va,, write a KCL equation to get
Vi−VaR1=Va−Vo1 / sC+Va1 / sC+VaR2.

Solving for Vi,
Vi=(1+2sR1C+R1/R2)Va−sR1CVo.
Substituting the equation for Va into the equation for Vi and then
rearranging, we get an expression for the transfer function Vo / Vi:
H(s)=−sR1Cs2+2R3Cs+1ReqR3C2, (15.19)
where
Req=R1 || R2=R1R2R1+R2.
Equation 15.19 is in the standard form for a bandpass filter transfer function;
that is,
H(s)=−Kβss2+ βs+ωo2,
so we can equate terms and solve for the values of the resistors that will
achieve a specified center frequency (ωo), quality factor (Q), and passband
gain (K):
β = 2 R 3 C ; Kβ = 1 R 1 C ; ω o 2 = 1 R eq R 3 C 2 .
Let’s define the prototype version of the circuit in Fig. 15.27 as a bandpass
filter with ωo=1 rad/s and C=1 F. Then the expressions for R1, R2, and R3
can be given in terms of the desired quality factor and passband gain. You
should verify (in Problem 15.57) that for the prototype circuit, the
expressions for R1, R2, and R3 are
R 1 = Q / K, R 2 = Q / ( 2 Q 2 −K ), R 3 = 2Q. (15.20)
Use scaling to achieve the desired center frequency and to specify practical
values for the circuit components. This design process is illustrated in
Example 15.13.
Example 15.13 Designing a High-Q

Bandpass Filter
Design a bandpass filter, using the circuit in Fig. 15.27, that has a center
frequency of 3000 Hz, a quality factor of 10, and a passband gain of 2. Use
0.01 μF capacitors in your design. Compute the transfer function of your
circuit, and sketch a Bode plot of its magnitude response.
Solution
Since Q=10 and K=2, the values for R1, R2, and R3 in the prototype circuit,
from Eq. 15.20, are
R 1 = Q K = 10 2 =5 Ω, R 2 = Q 2 Q 2 −K = 10 200−2 = 10 198  Ω, R 3 =
2Q=2( 10 )=20 Ω .
The scaling factors are kf=6000π, to move the center frequency from 1 rad/s
to 3000 Hz, and km=108/kf, so we can use 0.01 μF capacitors. After scaling,
R 1 = 26.5 kΩ, R 2 = 268.0 Ω, R 3 = 106.1  kΩ.
The circuit is shown in Fig. 15.28.

Substituting the values of resistance and capacitance in Eq. 15.19 gives the
transfer function for this circuit:
H(s)=−3770ss2+ 1885.0s+355 × 106.

bandpass filter defined in the example. A Bode plot of its magnitude response
is sketched in Fig. 15.29.

The parallel implementation of a bandreject filter that combines low-pass and
high-pass filter components with a summing amplifier has the same low-Q
restriction as the cascaded bandpass filter. The circuit in Fig. 15.30 is an
active high-Q bandreject filter known as the twin-T notch filter because of
the two T-shaped parts of the circuit at the nodes labeled a and b.
Figure 15.30 A high-Q active
bandreject filter.

Figure 15.30 Full Alternative Text
We begin analyzing this circuit by writing a KCL equation at the node

labeled Va:
(Va−Vi)sC+ (Va−Vo)sC+ 2(Va−σVo)R=0
or
Va[2sCR+2]−Vo[sCR+2σ]=sCRVi.
Writing a KCL equation at the node labeled Vb yields
Vb−ViR+Vb−VoR+ (Vb−σVo)2sC=0
or
Vb[2+2RCs]−Vo[1+2σRCs]=Vi.
Writing a KCL equation at the noninverting input terminal of the top op amp
gives
(Vo−Va)sC+ Vo−VbR=0
or
−sRCVa−Vb+(sRC+1)Vo=0.
From the three KCL equations, we can use Cramer’s rule to solve for Vo:
V o = | 2( RCs+1 ) 0 sCR V i 0 2( RCs+1 ) V i −RCs −1 0 | | 2( RCs+1 ) 0 −(
RCs+2σ ) 0 2( RCs+1 ) −( 2σRCs+1 ) −RCs −1 RCs+1 | = ( R 2 C 2 s 2 +1)
V i R 2 C 2 s 2 +4RC(1−σ)s+1 .
Rearranging this equation for Vo, we can solve for the transfer function:
H(s)=VoVi=(s2+1R2C2)[s2+4(1−σ)RCs+1R2C2], (15.21)
which is in the standard form for the transfer function of a bandreject filter:
H(s)=s2+ω02s2+βs+ω02.

Therefore,
ω o 2 = 1 R 2 C 2 , β = 4(1−σ) RC .
In this circuit, we have three parameters (R, C, and σ) and two design
constraints (ωo and β). Thus, one parameter is chosen arbitrarily; it is usually
the capacitor value because it normally has the fewest commercially available
options. Once C is chosen,
R = 1 ω o C , σ= = 1− β 4 ω o =1− 1 4Q . (15.22)
Example 15.14 illustrates the design of a high-Q active bandreject filter.
Example 15.14 Designing a High-Q
Bandreject Filter
Design a high-Q active bandreject filter (based on the circuit in Fig. 15.30)
with a center frequency of 5000 rad/s and a bandwidth of 1000 rad/s. Use
1 μF capacitors in your design.
Solution
In the bandreject prototype filter, ωo=1 rad/s, R=1Ω, and C=1 F. Once ωo
and Q are determined from the filter specifications, C can be chosen
arbitrarily, and R and σ can be found from Eqs. 15.22. From the
specifications, ωo=5000 rad/s and Q=5. Using Eqs. 15.22, we see that
R = 1 ω o C = 1 ( 5000 )( 10 −6 ) =200Ω, σ = 1− 1 4Q =1− 1 4( 5 ) =0.95.
Therefore, we need resistors with the values 200Ω (R), 100Ω (R/2), 190Ω
(σR), and 10Ω [(1−σ)R] . The final design is depicted in Fig. 15.31, and the

Practical Perspective
Bass Volume Control
We now look at an op amp circuit that can be used to control audio signal
amplification in the bass range. Signals in the audio range have frequencies
from 20 Hz to20 kHz. The bass range includes frequencies up to 300 Hz. The
volume control circuit and its frequency response are shown in Fig. 15.33.

We can select a desired frequency response curve from the family of curves
in Fig. 15.33(b) by adjusting the potentiometer in Fig. 15.33(a).
Figure 15.33 (a) Bass volume
control circuit; (b) Bass volume

response.
Figure 15.33 Full Alternative Text

15.5-6 Full Alternative Text
Study the frequency response curves in Fig. 15.33(b) and note the following.
The gain in dB can be either positive or negative. If the gain is positive,
a signal in the bass range is amplified or boosted. If the gain is negative,
the signal is attenuated or cut.
It is possible to select a response curve that has unity gain (zero dB) for
all frequencies in the bass range. As we shall see, if the potentiometer is
set at its midpoint, the circuit will have no effect on signals in the bass
range.
As the frequency increases, all frequency response curves approach zero
dB or unity gain. Hence, the volume control circuit will have no effect

on signals in the upper end, or treble range, of the audio frequencies.
We need to find the transfer function, Vo / Vs, for the circuit in Fig. 15.33(a)
in order to analyze the circuit’s frequency response. To find the transfer
function, we transform the circuit into the s domain as shown in Fig. 15.34.
The node voltages Va and Vb have been labeled in the circuit to support
node-voltage analysis. The position of the potentiometer is determined by the
numerical value of α, as noted in Fig. 15.34.
Figure 15.34 The s-domain
circuit for the bass volume
control. Note that α determines
the potentiometer setting, so
0≤α≤1.

Figure 15.34 Full Alternative Text
To find the transfer function, we write the three KCL equations at the nodes
labeled Va and Vb, and at the inverting input of the op amp:
V a ( 1−α ) R 2 +  V a − V s R 1 + ( V a − V b )s  C 1 = 0; V b α R 2 + ( V b −
V a )s  C 1 +  V b − V o R 1 = 0; V a ( 1−α ) R 2 +  V b α R 2 = 0.
Solve the three node-voltage equations to find Vo as a function of Vs and
hence the transfer function H(s):
H(s)=VoVs=−(R1+ αR2+R1R2C1s)R1+(1−α)R2+R1R2C1s.
It follows directly that
H(jω)=−(R1+αR2+jωR1R2C1)[R1+(1−α)R2+jωR1R2C1].

Now let’s verify that this transfer function generates the family of frequency
response curves depicted in Fig. 15.33(b). First note that when α=0.5 the
magnitude of H(jω) is unity for all frequencies, that is,
|H(jω)|=|R1+0.5R2+jωR1R2C1||R1+ 0.5R2+jωR1R2C1|=1.
When ω=0, we have
|H(j0)|=R1+αR2R1+(1−α)R2.
Observe that |H(j0)| at α=1 is the reciprocal of |H(j0)| at α=0; that is
|H(j0)|α=1=R1+R2R1=1|H(j0)|α=0.
In fact, this reciprocal relationship holds for all frequencies, not just ω=0. For
example, α=0.4 and α=0.6 are symmetric about α=0.5 and
H(jω)α=0.4=−(R1+0.4R2)+jωR1R2C1(R1+ 0.6R2)+jωR1R2C1
while
H(jω)α=0.6=−(R1+0.6R2)+jωR1R2C1(R1+0.4R2)+jωR1R2C1.
Hence
H(jω)α=0.4=1H(jω)α=0.6.
The volume control circuit can either amplify or attenuate its input signal,
depending on the value of α.
The numerical values of R1, R2, and C1 are based on two design
specifications. The first specification is the passband amplification or
attenuation in the bass range (as ω→0). The second specification is the
frequency at which this passband amplification or attenuation is changed by
3 dB. The component values that satisfy the specifications are calculated with
α equal to either 1 or 0.
As we have already observed, the maximum gain will be (R1+R2) / R1, and
the maximum attenuation will beR1 / (R1+R2). If we assume

(R1+R2)/R1≫1, then the amplification (or attenuation) will differ by 3dB
from its maximum value whenω=1 / R2C1. This can be seen by noting that
|H( j 1 R 2 C 1 ) | α=1 = | R 1 + R 2 +j R 1 | | R 1 +j R 1 | = | R 1 + R 2 R 1 | |
1+j1 | ≈ 1 2 ( R 1 + R 2 R 1 ) and |H( j 1 R 2 C 1 ) | α=0 = | R 1 +j R 1 | | R 1
+ R 2 +j R 1 | = | 1+j1 | | R 1 + R 2 R 1 +j1| ≈ 2 ( R 1 R 1 + R 2 ).

Summary
Active filters consist of op amps, resistors, and capacitors. They can be
configured as low-pass, high-pass, bandpass, and bandreject filters.
They overcome many of the disadvantages associated with passive
filters. (See page 572.)
A prototype low-pass filter has component values of R1=R2=1Ω and
C=1F, and it produces a unity passband gain and a cutoff frequency of
1rad / s. The prototype high-pass filter has the same component values
and also produces a unity passband gain and a cutoff frequency of
1rad / s. (See pages 575 and 576.)
Magnitude scaling can be used to alter component values without
changing the frequency response of a circuit. For a magnitude scale
factor of km, the scaled (primed) values of resistance, capacitance, and
inductance are
R′=kmR, L′=kmL, and C′=C / km.
(See page 577.)
Frequency scaling can be used to shift the frequency response of a
circuit to another frequency region without changing the overall shape
of the frequency response. For a frequency scale factor of kf, the scaled
(primed) values of resistance, capacitance, and inductance are
R′=R, L′=L / kf, and C′=C / kf.
(See page 578.)
Components can be scaled in both magnitude and frequency, with the
scaled (primed) component values given by
R′=kmR, L′=(km / kf)L, and C′=C / (kmkf).

(See page 578)
The design of active low-pass and high-pass filters can begin with a
prototype filter circuit. Scaling can then be applied to shift the frequency
response to the desired cutoff frequency, using component values that
are commercially available. (See page 578.)
An active broadband bandpass filter can be constructed using a cascade
of a low-pass filter with the bandpass filter’s upper cutoff frequency, a
high-pass filter with the bandpass filter’s lower cutoff frequency, and
(optionally) an inverting amplifier gain stage to achieve nonunity gain in
the passband. Bandpass filters implemented in this fashion must be
broadband filters(ωc2≫ωc1), so that each op amp circuit in the cascade
can be specified independently. (See page 579.)
An active broadband bandreject filter can be constructed using a parallel
combination of a low-pass filter with the bandreject filter’s lower cutoff
frequency and a high-pass filter with the bandreject filter’s upper cutoff
frequency. The outputs are then fed into a summing amplifier, which can
produce nonunity gain in the passband. Bandreject filters implemented
in this way must be broadband filters(ωc2≫ωc1), so that the low-pass
and high-pass filter circuits can be designed independently. (See page
585.)
Higher-order active filters have multiple poles in their transfer functions,
resulting in a sharper transition from the passband to the stopband and
thus a more nearly ideal frequency response. (See page 588.)
The transfer function of an nth-order Butterworth low-pass filter with a
cutoff frequency of 1rad / s can be determined from the equation
H(s)H(−s)=11+(−1)ns2n
by
finding the roots of the denominator polynomial
assigning the left-half plane roots to H(s)

writing the denominator of H(s) as a product of first- and second-
order factors
(See page 591–592.)
The fundamental problem in the design of a Butterworth filter is to
determine the order of the filter. The filter specification usually defines
the sharpness of the transition band in terms of the quantities Ap, ωp,
As, and ωs. From these quantities, we calculate the smallest integer
larger than the solution to either Eq. 15.15 or Eq. 15.16. (See page 596.)
A cascade of second-order low-pass op amp filters (Fig. 15.21) with 1 Ω
resistors and capacitor values chosen to produce each factor in the
Butterworth polynomial will produce an even-order Butterworth low-
pass filter. Adding a prototype low-pass op amp filter will produce an
odd-order Butterworth low-pass filter. (See page 593.)
A cascade of second-order high-pass op amp filters (Fig. 15.25) with 1 F
capacitors and resistor values chosen to produce each factor in the
Butterworth polynomial will produce an even-order Butterworth high-
pass filter. Adding a prototype high-pass op amp filter will produce an
odd-order Butterworth high-pass filter. (See page 598.)
For both high- and low-pass Butterworth filters, frequency and
magnitude scaling can be used to shift the cutoff frequency from 1rad / s
and to include realistic component values in the design. Cascading an
inverting amplifier will produce a nonunity passband gain. (See page
598.)
Butterworth low-pass and high-pass filters can be cascaded to produce
Butterworth bandpass filters of any order n. Butterworth low-pass and
high-pass filters can be combined in parallel with a summing amplifier
to produce a Butterworth bandreject filter of any order n. (See page
599.)
If a high-Q, or narrowband, bandpass, or bandreject filter is needed, the
cascade or parallel combination will not work. Instead, the circuits
shown in Figs. 15.27 and 15.30 are used with the appropriate design

equations. Typically, capacitor values are chosen from those
commercially available, and the design equations are used to specify the
resistor values. (See page 600 and 603.)

15. 15.48 The purpose of this problem is to guide you through the analysis

P15.48.
1. Analyze the circuit qualitatively and convince yourself that the
circuit is a low-pass filter with a passband gain of R2/R1.
2. Support your qualitative analysis by deriving the transfer function
Vo/Vi. (Hint: In deriving the transfer function, represent the
resistors with their equivalent conductances, that is, G1=1/R1, and
so forth.) To make the transfer function useful in terms of the
entries in Table 15.1, put it in the form

H(s)=−Kbos2+b1s+bo.
3. Now observe that we have five circuit components—R1, R2, R3,
C1, and C2—and three transfer function constraints—K, b1, and
bo. At first glance, it appears we have two free choices among the
five components. However, when we investigate the relationships
between the circuit components and the transfer function
constraints, we see that if C2 is chosen, there is an upper limit on
C1 in order for R2(G2) to be realizable. With this in mind, show
that if C2=1 F, the three conductances are given by the expressions
G 1 = K G 2 ; G 3 =( b o G 2 ) C 1 ; G 3 = ( b o G 2 ) C 1 ; G 2 = b
1 ± b 1 2 −4 b o (1+K) C 1 2(1+K) .
For G2 to be realizable,
C1≤b124bo(1+K).

1. Be able to calculate the trigonometric form of the Fourier coefficients
for a periodic waveform using the definition of the coefficients and the
simplifications possible if the waveform exhibits one or more types of
symmetry.

In this chapter, we find the steady-state response of circuits to periodic,
nonsinusoidal, inputs. A periodic function repeats itself every T seconds, so
T is the period of the function. For example, the function plotted in Fig. 16.1
on 620 is a periodic waveform that is not a sinusoid.
Figure 16.1 A periodic
waveform.

Figure 16.1 Full Alternative Text
A periodic function satisfies the relationship
f(t)=f(t±nT),(16.1)
where n is an integer (1, 2, 3, …) and T is the period. The function shown in
Fig. 16.1 is periodic because
f(t0)=f(t0−T)=f(t0+T)=f(t0+2T)=⋯
for any arbitrarily chosen value of t0. Note that T is the smallest time interval
that a periodic function may be shifted (either left or right) to produce a
function that is identical to itself.
Why are we interested in the response of circuits to inputs that are periodic
but not sinusoids? One reason is that many electrical sources of practical
value generate such waveforms. Here are a few examples.
A nonfiltered electronic rectifier driven from a sinusoidal source
produces a rectified sine wave that is not sinusoidal but is periodic.
Figures 16.2(a) and (b) on page 620 show the waveforms of the full-

wave and half-wave sinusoidal rectifiers, respectively.
The sweep generator used to control the electron beam of a cathode-ray
oscilloscope produces a periodic triangular wave like the one shown in
Fig. 16.3 on page 620.
Function generators, which are used to test equipment in a laboratory,
are designed to produce nonsinusoidal periodic waveforms, including
square waves, triangular waves, and rectangular waves. Figure 16.4 on
620 illustrates typical waveforms output by a function generator.
A power generator is designed to produce a sinusoidal waveform but
cannot produce a pure sine wave. Instead, it produces a distorted
sinusoidal wave that is still periodic. We can use the analysis techniques
in this chapter to determine the consequences of a circuit with a slightly
distorted sinusoidal voltage.
Any nonlinearity in an otherwise linear circuit creates a nonsinusoidal
periodic function. The rectifier circuit mentioned earlier is one example
of this phenomenon. Magnetic saturation, which occurs in both
machines and transformers, is another example of a nonlinearity that
generates a nonsinusoidal periodic function. An electronic clipping
circuit, which uses transistor saturation, is yet another example.

Practical Perspective
Active High-Q Filters
An important characteristic of bandpass and bandreject filters is the quality
factor, Q, as we discovered in Chapters 14 and 15. The quality factor
provides a measure of how selective the filter is at and near its center
frequency. For example, an active bandpass filter with a large value of Q will
amplify signals at or near its center frequency and will attenuate signals at all
other frequencies. In contrast, a bandreject filter with a small value of Q will
not effectively distinguish between signals at the center frequency and signals
at frequencies quite different from the center frequency.
We can test the quality factor of a bandpass or bandreject filter using a
periodic signal. For example, to test the quality factor of a bandpass filter,
input a square wave whose frequency is the same as the center frequency of
the bandpass filter and analyze the output. In this chapter, we learn that any
periodic signal can be represented as a sum of sinusoids. The frequencies of
the sinusoids include the frequency of the periodic signal and integer

multiples of that frequency. So the input square wave, whose frequency is ω,
consists of a sum of sinusoids at the frequencies ω, 2ω, 3ω, and so on. If the
bandpass filter has a high-quality factor, its output will be nearly sinusoidal
because it filtered out all of the sinusoids that make up the square wave
except the one at ω. If the filter has a low-quality factor, its output will still
look like a square wave because the filter passed many of the sinusoids that
make up the input square wave to the output. We present an example at the
end of this chapter.

Nonsinusoidal periodic functions are also important when analyzing
nonelectrical systems. Problems involving mechanical vibration, fluid flow,
and heat flow all make use of periodic functions. In fact, the study and
analysis of heat flow in a metal rod led the French mathematician Jean
Baptiste Joseph Fourier (1768–1830) to the trigonometric series
representation of a periodic function. This series bears his name and is the
starting point for finding the steady-state response of a circuit to a periodic
input.

16.1 Fourier Series Analysis: An
Overview
A periodic function can be represented by an infinite sum of sine and cosine
functions that are harmonically related, as Fourier discovered while
investigating heat-flow problems. Specifically, the frequency of every
trigonometric term in the infinite series is an integer multiple, or harmonic, of
the fundamental frequency, ω0, of the periodic function. Thus, if f(t) is
periodic, Fourier showed that it can be expressed as
Fourier Series Representation of a
Periodic Function
f(t)=av+∑n=1∞an cos nωot+bn sin nω0t,(16.2)
where n is the integer sequence 1, 2, 3, ….
In Eq. 16.2, av, an, and bn are known as the Fourier coefficients and are
calculated from f(t). We discuss these calculations in Section 16.2. The term
ω0 (which equals 2π/T) represents the fundamental frequency of the
periodic function f(t). The integer multiples of ω0—that is, 2ω0, 3ω0, 4ω0,
and so on—are known as the harmonic frequencies of f(t). Thus, 2ω0 is the
second harmonic, 3ω0 is the third harmonic, and nω0 is the nth harmonic of
f(t).
Before learning how to find a circuit’s response to a periodic input using a
Fourier series representation of that input, we first look at the process in
general terms. We can express all the periodic functions of interest in circuit
analysis using a Fourier series. But not every periodic function has a Fourier
series representation. The conditions on a periodic function f(t) that ensure it
can be expressed as a convergent Fourier series (known as Dirichlet’s

conditions) are as follows.
1. f(t) is single-valued.
2. f(t) has a finite number of discontinuities in the periodic interval.
3. f(t) has a finite number of maxima and minima in the periodic interval.
4. The integral
∫t0t0+T|f(t)| dt
exists.
All periodic functions encountered in circuit analysis satisfy Dirichlet’s
conditions. These are sufficient, not necessary conditions. Thus, if f(t) meets
these requirements, we know that we can express it as a Fourier series.
However, if f(t) does not meet these requirements, we still may be able to
express it as a Fourier series. The necessary conditions on f(t) are not known.
After we have determined f(t) and calculated the Fourier coefficients (av, an,
and bn), we replace the periodic source with a dc source (av) and sinusoidal
sources, all connected in series. Each source represents a term in the Fourier
series representation of the periodic input. Then, we use superposition to
calculate the response to each source. The sum of the individual responses
gives us the total steady-state response. The steady-state response to each
sinusoidal source is most easily found using the phasor methods of Chapter 9.
The procedure just outlined involves no new circuit analysis techniques. It
produces the Fourier series representation of the steady-state response;
consequently, the functional form of the response is unknown. Furthermore,
the output waveform is expressed as an infinite sum, so we can only estimate
its shape by adding a sufficient number of its terms together. While the
Fourier series method for finding the steady-state response of a circuit to a
periodic input does have some drawbacks, it introduces a way of thinking
about a problem that is as important as getting quantitative results. In fact, the
conceptual picture is even more important, in some respects, than the
quantitative one.

16.2 The Fourier Coefficients
Using the definition of a periodic function over its fundamental period, we
determine the Fourier coefficients from the relationships
Fourier Coefficients
av=1T∫​t0+Tt0f(t) dt, (16.3)
ak=2T∫​t0+Tt0f(t) cos kω0t dt, (16.4)
bk=2T∫​t0+Tt0f(t) sin kω0t dt. (16.5)
In Eqs. 16.4 and 16.5, the subscript k indicates the kth coefficient in the
integer sequence 1, 2, 3, …. Note that av is the average value of f(t), ak is
twice the average value of f(t) cos kω0t, and bk is twice the average value of
f(t) sin kω0t.
We derive Eqs. 16.3–16.5 from Eq. 16.2 by recalling the following integral
relationships, which hold when m and n are integers:
∫t0t0+Tsin mω0t dt=0,for all m,∫t0t0+Tcos mω0t dt=0,for all m,∫t0t0+Tcos mω0
We leave you to verify these equations in Problem 16.5.
To derive Eq. 16.3, integrate both sides of Eq. 16.2 over one period:
∫t0t0+Tf(t) dt=∫t0t0+T(av+∑n=1∞ancos  nω0t+bn sin  nω0t) dt=∫t0t0+Tavdt+∑
Solving for av gives us Eq. 16.3.
To derive the expression for the kth value of an, we first multiply Eq. 16.2 by
cos kω0t and then integrate both sides over one period of f(t) :
∫ t 0 t 0 +T f( t ) cos k ω 0 t dt = ∫ t 0 t 0 +T a v  cos k ω 0 t dt             +  ∑ n=1
∞ ∫ t 0 t 0 +T ( a n  cos n ω 0 t cos k ω 0 t+ b n  sin n ω 0 t cos k ω 0 t ) dt

           =0+ a k ( T 2 )+0.
Solving for ak yields the expression in Eq. 16.4.
We obtain the expression for the kth value of bn by first multiplying both
sides of Eq. 16.2 by sin kω0t and then integrating each side over one period
of f(t). You should complete the derivation of Eq. 16.5 in Problem 16.6. In
Example 16.1 we use Eqs. 16.3–16.5 to find the Fourier coefficients for a
specific periodic function.

Solution
To find av, ak, and bk using Eqs. 16.3–16.5, we must choose the starting time
t0. For the periodic voltage of Fig. 16.5, the best choice for t0 is zero. Any
other choice makes the required integrations more cumbersome. The
expression for v(t) between 0 and T is
v(t)=(VmT)t.
The equation for av is
av=1T∫0T(VmT)t dt=12Vm.
This is clearly the average value of the waveform in Fig. 16.5.
The equation for the kth value of an is
ak=2T∫0T(VmT)t cos kω0t dt=2VmT2(1k2ω02 cos kω0t+tkω0 sin kω0t)|0T=2
1k2ω02 (cos 2πk−1) ]=0     for all k.
Notice that we used the relationship between T and ω0, T=2π/ω0, when
evaluating the integral at its upper limit.
The equation for the kth value of bn is
bk=2T∫0T(VmT) t sin kω0t dt=2VmT2 (1k2ω02 sin kω0t 
− tkω0 cos kω0t)|0T=2VmT2 (0−Tkω0 cos 2πk)=−Vmπk.

Finding the Fourier coefficients, in general, is tedious. Therefore, anything
that simplifies the task is beneficial. Fortunately, when a periodic function
possesses certain types of symmetry, we can find its Fourier coefficients with
fewer computations. In Section 16.3, we discuss how symmetry affects the
coefficients in a Fourier series.

16.3 The Effect of Symmetry on the
Fourier Coefficients
Four types of symmetry make the task of evaluating the Fourier coefficients
easier:
even-function symmetry,
odd-function symmetry,
half-wave symmetry,
quarter-wave symmetry.
The effect of each type of symmetry on the Fourier coefficients is discussed
in the following sections.
Even-Function Symmetry
A function is defined as even if
Even Function
f(t)=f(−t).(16.6)
Figure 16.6 illustrates an even periodic function. Functions that satisfy Eq.
16.6 are said to be even because polynomial functions with only even
exponents possess this characteristic.
Figure 16.6 An even periodic

function, f(t)=f(−f).
Figure 16.6 Full Alternative Text
For even periodic functions, the equations for the Fourier coefficients reduce
to
av=2T∫0T/2f(t) dt, (16.7)
ak=4T∫0T/2f(t) cos kω0t dt, (16.8)
bk=0,for all k. (16.9)
Note that all the b coefficients are zero if the periodic function is even. This
means that the Fourier series representation of an even periodic function
consists only of the constant term and cosine terms—there are no sine terms.
This is not surprising because the cosine function is even, but the sine
function is not.
The derivations of Eqs. 16.7–16.9 follow directly from Eqs. 16.3–16.5. In
each derivation, we select t0=−T/2 and then break the interval of integration

into the range from −T/2 to 0 and 0 to T/2, For example,
av=1T∫−T/2T/2f(t) dt=1T∫−T/20f(t) dt+1T∫0T/2f(t) dt.
Now we change the variable of integration in the first integral on the right-
hand side of the equation for av. We let t=−x and note that f(t)=f(−x)=f(x)
because the function is even. Note that x=T/2 when t=−T/2 and dt=−dx. Then
∫−T/20f(t) dt=∫T/20f(x) (−dx)=∫0T/2f(x) dx,
which shows that the integral from −T/2 to 0 is identical to the integral from
0 to T/2. This completes the derivation of Eq. 16.7.
The derivation of Eq. 16.8 proceeds along similar lines. Here,
a k = 2 T ∫ 0 −T/2 f(t) cos k ω 0 t dt + 2 T ∫ T/2 0 f(t) cos k ω 0 t dt,
but
∫ −T/2 0 f(t) cos k ω 0 t dt = ∫ T/2 0 f(x) cos (−k ω 0 x)(−dx) = ∫ 0 T/2
f(x) cos k ω 0 x dx.
As before, the integral from −T/2 to 0 is the same as the integral from 0 to
T/2. Replacing the first integral in the equation for ak with a copy of
the second integral and simplifying yields Eq. 16.8.
All the b coefficients are zero when f(t) is an even periodic function because
the integral from −T/2 to 0 is the negative of the integral from 0 to T/2; that
is,
∫ −T/2 0 f(t) sin k ω 0 t dt = ∫ T/2 0 f(x) sin (−k ω 0 x)(−dx) = ∫ 0 T/2 f(x) sin k
ω 0 x dx.
When we use Eqs. 16.7 and 16.8 to find the Fourier coefficients, the interval
of integration must be between 0 and T/2.
Odd-Function Symmetry

A function is defined as odd if
Odd Function
f(t)=−f(−t).(16.10)
Functions that satisfy Eq. 16.10 are said to be odd because polynomial
functions with only odd exponents have this characteristic. Figure 16.7 shows
an odd periodic function.
Figure 16.7 An odd periodic
function f(t)=−f(−f).
Figure 16.7 Full Alternative Text
The expressions for the Fourier coefficients are

av=0; (16.11)
ak=0,for all k; (16.12)
bk=4T∫0T/2f(t) sin kω0t dt. (16.13)
Note that all the a coefficients are zero if the periodic function is odd. This
means that the Fourier series representation of an odd periodic function
consists only of sine terms; there are no cosine terms. This is not surprising
because the sine function is odd, but the cosine function is even. It also
means that the average value of an odd function is always zero because the
constant term, av, is always zero.
We use the same process to derive Eqs. 16.11–16.13 that we used to derive
Eqs. 16.7–16.9. We leave the derivations to you in Problem 16.7.
If a periodic function has even or odd symmetry, the symmetry can be
destroyed by shifting the function along the time axis. This also means that if
a periodic function lacks even or odd symmetry, it may be possible to shift
the function along the time axis to create this symmetry. For example, the
triangular function shown in Fig. 16.8(a) is neither even nor odd. However,
we can make the function even by shifting it left, as shown in Fig. 16.8(b), or
odd by shifting it right, as shown in Fig. 16.8(c).

where can make a periodic
function even, odd, or neither.

Half-Wave Symmetry
A periodic function possesses half-wave symmetry if it satisfies the
constraint
Half-Wave Symmetry
f(t)=−f(t−T/2).(16.14)
Equation 16.14 states that a periodic function has half-wave symmetry if,
after it is shifted one-half period and inverted, it is identical to the original
function. For example, the functions shown in Figs. 16.7 and 16.8 have half-
wave symmetry, whereas those in Figs. 16.5 and 16.6 do not. Note that half-
wave symmetry is not determined by where [&t|=|0&], as seen in Fig.
16.8.t=0.
If a periodic function has half-wave symmetry, both ak and bk are zero for
even values of k. Moreover, av also is zero because the average value of a
function with half-wave symmetry is zero. The expressions for the Fourier
coefficients are
av=0, (16.15)
a k = 0 for k even; a k = 4 T ∫ 0 T/2 f( t ) sin k ω 0 t dt, for k odd; (16.16)
b k = 0 for k even; b k = 4 T ∫ 0 T/2 f( t ) sin k ω 0 t dt, for k odd. (16.17)
We derive Eqs. 16.15–16.17 by starting with Eqs. 16.3–16.5 and choosing the
interval of integration as −T/2 to T/2. We then divide this range into the
intervals −T/2. to 0 and 0 to T/2. For example, the derivation for ak is
a k = 2 T ∫ t 0 t 0 +T f( t ) cos k ω 0 t dt = 2 T ∫ −T/2 T/2 f( t ) cos k ω 0 t dt =
2 T ∫ −T/2 0 f( t ) cos k ω 0 t dt + 2 T ∫ 0 T/2 f( t ) cos k ω 0 t dt.
Now we change a variable in the first integral on the right-hand side of the

equation for ak. Specifically, we let
t=x−T/2.
Then
x=T/2,          when t=0;x=0,               when t=−T/2;dt=dx.
We rewrite the first integral as
∫−T/20f(t) cos kω0t dt=∫0T/2f(x−T/2) cos kω0(x−T/2) dx.
Note that
cos kω0(x−T/2)=cos (kω0x−kπ)=cos kπ cos kω0x
and that, by hypothesis,
f(x−T/2)=−f(x).
Therefore,
∫−T/20f(t) cos kω0t dt=∫0T/2[−f(x)] cos kπ cos kω0x dx.
Incorporating this integral into the equation for ak gives
ak=2T(1−cos kπ)∫0T/2f(t) cos kω0tdt.
But cos kπ is 1 when k is even and −1 when k is odd. Therefore, we get the
expressions for ak given in Eqs. 16.16.
We leave it to you to verify that this same process can be used to derive Eqs.
16.17 (see Problem 16.8).
We summarize our observations by noting that the Fourier series
representation of a periodic function with half-wave symmetry has zero
average value and contains only odd harmonics.

Quarter-Wave Symmetry
The term quarter-wave symmetry describes a periodic function that has
half-wave symmetry and, in addition, symmetry about the midpoint of the
positive and negative half-cycles. The function illustrated in Fig. 16.9(a) has
quarter-wave symmetry about the midpoint of the positive and negative half-
cycles. The function in Fig. 16.9(b) does not have quarter-wave symmetry,
although it does have half-wave symmetry.

A periodic function that has quarter-wave symmetry can always be made
either even or odd by the proper choice of the point where t=0. For example,
the function shown in Fig. 16.9(a) is odd and can be made even by shifting
the function T/4 units either right or left along the t axis. However, the
function in Fig. 16.9(b) can never be made either even or odd.
To take advantage of quarter-wave symmetry when calculating the Fourier
coefficients, you must choose the point where t=0 to make the function either
even or odd. If the function is made even, then
av=0,because of half-wave symmetry;ak=0,for k even,because of half-
wave symmetry;ak=8T∫0T/4f(t) cos kω0t dt,     for k odd;bk=0,for all k,because
(16.18)
Equations 16.18 result from the function’s quarter-wave symmetry in
addition to its being even. Remember that if a function has quarter-wave

symmetry, it also has half-wave symmetry, so we can eliminate av and ak for
k even. Comparing the expression for ak, k odd, in Eqs. 16.18 with Eqs.
16.16, shows that when an even function also has quarter-wave symmetry,
we can shorten the range of integration from 0 to T/2 to 0 to T/4. We leave
the derivation of Eqs. 16.18 to you in Problem 16.9.
If the quarter-wave symmetric function is made odd,
av=0,because the function is odd;ak=0,for all k,because the function is odd;bk=
wave symmetry;bk=8T∫0T/4f(t) sin kω0t dt,for k odd. (16.19)
Equations 16.19 are a direct consequence of the function being both odd and
quarter-wave symmetric. Again, quarter-wave symmetry allows us to shorten
the interval of integration from 0 to T/2 to 0 to T/4. We leave the derivation
of Eqs. 16.19 to you in Problem 16.10.
Example 16.2 shows how symmetry simplifies the task of finding the Fourier
coefficients.

Solution
We begin by looking for symmetry in the waveform. We find that the
function is odd and has half-wave and quarter-wave symmetry. Because the
function is odd, all the a coefficients are zero; that is, av=0 and ak=0 for all k.
Because the function has half-wave symmetry, bk=0 for even values of k.
Because the function has quarter-wave symmetry, the expression for bk for
odd values of k is
bk=8T∫0T/4i(t) sin kω0t dt.
In the interval 0≤t≤T/4, the expression for i(t) is
i(t)=4ImTt.

16.4 An Alternative Trigonometric
Form of the Fourier Series
When analyzing a circuit with a periodic input voltage, we could replace the
input voltage with a collection of series-connected voltage sources, where
each source corresponds to a term in the Fourier series representation of the
periodic voltage. This would mean that for every harmonic frequency, there
is a source for the sine term and a source for the cosine term at that
frequency.
Instead, to simplify the circuit and our analysis of it, we combine the sine and
cosine terms at the same harmonic frequency into a single term. Then, we can
transform the circuit into the phasor domain for each harmonic frequency,
where the combined source is represented as a single phasor quantity. Thus,
we write the Fourier series in Eq. 16.2 as
f(t)=av+∑n=1∞An cos (nω0t−θn), (16.20)
where An and θn are defined as
a n −j b n = a n 2 + b n 2   − θ n = A n   − θ n . (16.21)
We derive Eqs. 16.20 and 16.21 using the phasor method to add the cosine
and sine terms in Eq. 16.2. We begin by expressing the sine functions as
cosine functions; that is, we rewrite Eq. 16.2 as
f(t)=av+∑n=1∞an cos nω0t+bn cos (nω0t−90∘).
Adding the terms under the summation sign by using phasors gives
P {an cos nω0t}=an 0 ∘
and
P {bn cos (nω0t−90∘)}=bn − 90 ∘ =−jbn.

Then
P {an cos (nω0t+bn cos (nω0t−90°)}=an−jbn=an2+bn2−θn=An−θn.
The right-hand sides of this expression correspond to Eq. 16.21. When we
inverse phasor-transform both sides of this expression, we get
an cos nω0t+bn cos (nω0t−90∘)=P−1{An−θn}=An cos (nω0t−θn).
After substituting the right-hand side for the argument of the summation in
the expression for f(t), we get Eq. 16.20. If the periodic function is either
even or odd, An reduces to either an (even) or bn (odd), and θn is either 0°
(even) or 90° (odd).

16.5 An Application
Let’s use a Fourier series representation of a periodic input voltage to find the
steady-state output voltage of a linear circuit, which is the RC circuit shown
in Fig. 16.12(a). The circuit’s input voltage is the periodic square wave
shown in Fig. 16.12(b). The output voltage is defined across the capacitor.

square-wave voltage.

16.5-4 Full Alternative Text
First, we represent the periodic voltage with its Fourier series. The waveform
in Fig. 16.12(b) has odd, half-wave, and quarter-wave symmetry, so the only
nonzero Fourier coefficients are the bk coefficients for odd values of k:
bk=8T∫0T/4Vmsin kω0t dt=4Vmπ    k(k is odd).
Then the Fourier series representation of vg is
vg=4Vmπ∑n=1,3,5,…∞1nsin nω0t.
Writing the series in expanded form, we have
vg=4Vmπsin ω0t+4Vm3πsin 3ω0t+4Vm5πsin 5ω0t+4Vm7πsin7ω0t+⋯.
The voltage source, vg, in Fig. 16.12(a) can be replaced by infinitely many
series-connected sinusoidal sources. Each source is a sine function whose
frequency is an odd multiple of the square wave’s frequency. We use the
principle of superposition to find the contribution of each source to the output
voltage.
For each sinusoidal source, the phasor-domain expression for the output
voltage is

Vo=Vg1+jωRC.
Since all of the voltage sources are expressed as sine functions, we interpret a
phasor using the sine instead of the cosine. In other words, when we go from
the phasor domain back to the time domain, we simply write the time-domain
expressions as sin(ωt + θ) instead of cos(ωt+θ).
The phasor output voltage due to the sinusoidal source at the fundamental
frequency is
Vo1=(4Vm/π)−0∘1+jω0RC.
Writing Vo1 in polar form gives
V o1 = (4 V m ) π 1+ ω 0 2 R 2 C 2 − β 1 ,
where
β1=tan−1 ω0RC.
Inverse-phasor-transform Vo1 to get the time-domain expression for the
fundamental frequency component of vo:
vo1=4Vmπ1+ω02R2C2sin (ω0t−β1).
We derive the third-harmonic component of the output voltage in a similar
manner. The third-harmonic phasor output voltage is
Vo3=(4Vm/3π)−0∘1+j3ω0RC=4Vm3π1+9ω02R2C2−β3,
where
β3=tan−13ω0RC.
The time-domain expression for the third-harmonic output voltage is
vo3=4Vm3π1+9ω02R2C2sin (3ω0t−β3).
Hence, the expression for the kth-harmonic component of the output voltage

is
vok=4Vmkπ1+k2ω02R2C2sin (kω0t−βk)     (k is odd),
where
βk=tan−1kω0RC     (k is odd).
We now write down the Fourier series representation of the output voltage:
vo(t)=4Vmπ∑n=1,3,5,…∞sin (nω0t−βn)n1+(nω0RC)2. (16.22)
We derived an analytic expression for the steady-state output, but the shape
of vo(t), and its functional form, are not apparent from the equation. As we
mentioned earlier, this is a disadvantage of the Fourier series approach.
The Fourier series representation of vo(t) in Eq. 16.22 does provide some
information about the steady-state output voltage, if we focus on the
frequency response of the circuit. For example, if C is large, 1/nω0C is small
for the higher-order harmonics. Thus, the capacitor short circuits the high-
frequency components of the input waveform, and the higher-order
harmonics in the Fourier series representation of vo(t) are negligible
compared to the lower-order harmonics. For large C, we can approximate
vo(t) as
v o ≈ 4 V m π ω 0 RC ∑ n=1,3,5,… ∞ 1 n 2 sin (n ω 0 t− 90 ∘ ) ≈ −4 V m π
ω 0 RC ∑ n=1,3,5,… ∞ 1 n 2 cos n ω 0 t . (16.23)
Equation 16.23 shows that the amplitude of the harmonic in the output
voltage is decreasing by 1/n2, while the amplitude of the harmonic in the
input voltage decreases by 1/n. If C is so large that only the fundamental
component is significant, then to a first approximation
vo(t)≈−4Vmπω0RCcos ω0t,
and Fourier analysis tells us that the square-wave input is deformed into a
sinusoidal output.
Now let’s see what happens as C→0. The circuit shows that vo and vg are the

same when C=0, because the capacitive branch looks like an open circuit at
all frequencies. Equation 16.22 predicts the same result because, as C→0,
vo=4Vmπ∑n=1,3,5,…∞1nsin nω0t.
Therefore vo→vg as C→0.
Thus, Fourier series representation for vo(t) predicts that the output will be a
highly distorted replica of the input waveform if C is large, and a reasonable
replica if C is small. In Chapter 13, we looked at the distortion between the
input and output in terms of how much memory the system weighting
function had. In the frequency domain, we look at the distortion between the
steady-state input and output in terms of how the amplitude and phase of each
harmonic component are altered as it is transmitted through the circuit. When
the circuit significantly alters the amplitude and phase relationships among
the harmonics at the output relative to that at the input, the output is a
distorted version of the input. Thus, in the frequency domain, we speak of
amplitude distortion and phase distortion.
For the RC circuit in Fig. 16.12(a), amplitude distortion is present because
the amplitudes of the input harmonics decrease as 1/n, whereas the
amplitudes of the output harmonics decrease as
1n 11 + (nω0RC)2.
This circuit also exhibits phase distortion because the phase angle of each
input harmonic is zero, whereas that of the nth harmonic in the output signal
is −tan−1nω0RC.
An Application of the Direct
Approach to the Steady-State
Response
For the simple RC circuit shown in Fig. 16.12(a), we can find the steady-state

response without using the Fourier series representation of the periodic input
voltage. Doing this extra analysis here adds to our understanding of the
Fourier series approach.
To find the steady-state expression for vo, we reason as follows. The square-
wave input voltage alternates between charging the capacitor toward +Vm
and −Vm. After the circuit reaches steady-state operation, this alternate
charging becomes periodic. From our analysis of the first-order RC circuit in
Chapter 7, we know that an abrupt change in the input voltage results in an
output voltage that is exponential. Thus, the steady-state waveform of the
capacitor voltage for the RC circuit shown in Fig. 16.12(a) looks like the
waveform shown in Fig. 16.13.
Figure 16.13 The steady-state
waveform of vo for the circuit
in Figure 16.12(a).

Figure 16.13 Full Alternative Text
The analytic expressions for vo(t) in the time intervals 0≤t≤T/2 and T/2≤t≤T
are
vo=Vm+(V1−Vm)e−t/RC,                       0≤t≤T/2;vo=−Vm+(V2+Vm)e−[t
−(T/2)]/RC,      T/2≤t≤T.
We derive these equations by using the methods of Chapter 7, as summarized
by Eq. 7.23. The value of V2 is the value of vo(t) at the end of the
interval0≤t≤T/2:
vo(T/2)=V2=Vm+(V1−Vm)e−T/2RC,
and the value of V1 is the value of vo(t) at the end of the interval T/2≤t≤T:
vo(T)=V1=−Vm+(V2+Vm)e−T/2RC.

Solving these equations for V1 and V2 yields
V2=−V1=Vm(1−e−T/2RC)1+e−T/2RC.
Substituting the expressions for V1 and V2 into the equations for vo(t)gives
vo=Vm−2Vm1+e−T/2RCe−t/RC,     0≤t≤T/2, (16.24)
and
vo=−Vm+2Vm1+e−T/2RCe−[t−(T/2)]/RC,     T/2≤t≤T. (16.25)
Equations 16.24 and 16.25 indicate that vo(t) has half-wave symmetry, so the
average value of vo is zero. This result agrees with the Fourier series solution
for the steady-state response—namely, that because the input voltage has no
dc component, the output voltage cannot have a dc component. Equations
16.24 and 16.25 also show the effect of changing the size of the capacitor. If
C is small, the exponential functions quickly vanish, vo=Vm between 0 and
T/2, and vo=−Vm between T/2 and T. In other words, vo→vg as C→0. If C
is large, the output waveform becomes triangular in shape, as Fig. 16.14
shows. Note that for large C, we may approximate the exponential terms e
−t/RC and e−[t−(T/2)]/RC by the linear terms 1−(t/RC) and 1−{[t
−(T/2)]/RC}, respectively. Equation 16.23 gives the Fourier series of this
triangular waveform.

state response.

Figure 16.14 summarizes the results. The dashed line in Fig. 16.14 is the
input voltage, the solid colored line depicts the output voltage when C is
small, and the solid black line depicts the output voltage when C is large.
Finally, we verify that the steady-state response of Eqs. 16.24 and 16.25 is
equivalent to the Fourier series solution in Eq. 16.22. To do so, we derive the
Fourier series representation of the periodic function described by Eqs. 16.24
and 16.25. We have already noted that the periodic voltage response has half-
wave symmetry. Therefore, the Fourier series contains only odd harmonics.
For k odd,
ak=4T∫0T/2(Vm−2Vme−t/RC1+e−T/2RC)cos kω0t dt=−8RCVmT[1+
(kω0RC)2]     (k is odd), (16.26)

−8kω0VmR2C2T[1+(kω0RC)2]     (k is odd). (16.27)

To show that Eqs. 16.26 and 16.27 are consistent with Eq. 16.22, we must
prove that
ak2+bk2=4Vmkπ11+(kω0RC)2, (16.28)
and that
akbk=−kω0RC. (16.29)
You can verify Eqs. 16.26–16.29 in Problems 16.23 and 16.24. Equations
16.28 and 16.29 are used with Eqs. 16.20 and 16.21 to derive the Fourier
series expression in Eq. 16.22; we leave the details to you in Problem 16.25.
With this illustrative circuit, we showed how to use the Fourier series in
conjunction with the principle of superposition to find the steady-state
response to a periodic input voltage. Again, the principal shortcoming of the
Fourier series approach is the difficulty of ascertaining the output waveform.
However, by considering a circuit’s frequency response, we can deduce a
reasonable approximation of the steady-state response, using a finite number
of terms in the Fourier series representation. (See Problems 16.29 and 16.30.)

14.31, the transfer function is
H(s)=s2+1/LCs2+s/RC+1/LC=s2+25×104s2+100s+25×104.
To find the terms in the Fourier series representation of vo, evaluate
H(s) for s=jω, where ω is the frequency of the term in vg. Then, multiply
by the phasor representation of that term in vg, and inverse-phasor-
transform the result to find the corresponding term in vo. Note that we
are using the sine function, instead of the cosine function for the phasor
transform and its inverse.
For ω=100 rad/s:
H(j100)=

For ω=300 rad/s:

For ω=500 rad/s:

(3.2)=0.
For ω=700 rad/s:
H(j700)=

For ω=900 rad/s:

(0.99−9.13∘)(1.78)=1.76−9.13∘.
Therefore, the first five terms in the Fourier series representation of the
steady-state output voltage are
vo=15.99sin(100t−2.4°)+5.24sin(300t
−10.6°)+0sin500t+2.2sin(700t+16.26°)+1.76sin(900t+9.13°)+…V.
3. As noted in part (a), the circuit in Fig. 16.15 is a bandreject filter. It has
a center frequency of 1/LC=500 rad/s, a bandwidth of 1/RC=100 rad/s,
and a quality of 5, so it is a selective filter. Its cutoff frequencies are
452.494 rad/s and 552.494 rad/s. The magnitude of vo at 500 rad/s, the
center frequency of the filter, is zero, exactly what we should expect
from a bandreject filter. The magnitudes of vo at the frequencies outside
the passband defined by the cutoff frequencies are very close to the
magnitudes of vg at those frequencies. This is also the behavior we
expect from a selective bandreject filter.

16.6 Average-Power Calculations
with Periodic Functions
Given the Fourier series representation of the voltage and current at a pair of
terminals in a linear lumped-parameter circuit, we can express the average
power at the terminals as a function of the harmonic voltages and currents.
Using the trigonometric form of the Fourier series from Eq. 16.20, we find
that the periodic voltage and current at the circuit’s terminals are
v=Vdc+∑n=1∞Vncos (nω0t−θvn),i=Idc+∑n=1∞Incos (nω0t−θin).
The notation used in the equations for voltage and current is defined as
follows:
Vdc=the amplitude of the dc voltage component,Vn=the amplitude of thenth-
harmonic voltage,θvn=the phase angle of thenth-harmonic voltage,Idc=the
amplitude of the dc current component,In=the amplitude of thenth-harmonic
current,θin=the phase angle of thenth-harmonic current.
We assume that the current is in the direction of the voltage drop across the
terminals, so, using the passive sign convention, the instantaneous power at
the terminals is vi. The average power is
P=1T∫t0t0+Tp dt=1T∫t0t0+Tvi dt.
To find the expression for the average power, we substitute the expressions
for voltage and current into the equation for average power and integrate. At
first glance, this appears to be a formidable task because the product vi
requires multiplying two infinite series. However, the only terms to survive
integration are the products of voltage and current at the same frequency.
(See Problem 16.5.) Therefore, the equation for average power reduces to
P=1TVdcIdct|t0t0+T+∑n=1∞1T∫t0t0+TVnIncos (nω0t−θvn)cos (nω0t
−θin) dt.

Now, using the trigonometric identity
cos α cos β=12 cos(α − β) + 12 cos(α + β).
we simplify the expression for P to
P=VdcIdc+1T∑n=1∞VnIn2∫t0t0+T[cos(θvn−θin)+cos (2nω0t−θvn−θin)]dt.
The second term under the integral sign integrates to zero, so
P=VdcIdc+∑n=1∞VnIn2cos(θvn−θin). (16.30)
Equation 16.30 states that the total average power delivered by a periodic
signal is the sum of the average powers associated with each harmonic
voltage and current. Currents and voltages of different frequencies do not
interact to produce average power. Example 16.5 computes the average
power delivered by a periodic voltage.
Example 16.5 Calculating Average
Power for a Circuit with a Periodic
Voltage Source
Assume that the periodic square-wave voltage in Example 16.3 is applied
across the terminals of a 15Ω resistor. The value of Vm is 60 V, and the value
of T is 5 ms.
1. Write the first five nonzero terms of the Fourier series representation of
v(t). Use the trigonometric form given in Eq. 16.20.
2. Calculate the average power associated with each term in (a).
3. Calculate the total average power delivered to the 15Ω resistor.
4. What percentage of the total power is delivered by the first five terms of
the Fourier series?

Solution
1. The dc component of v(t) is
av=(60)(T/4)T=15V.
From Example 16.3 we have
A1=2 60/π=27.01V,θ1=45°,A2=60/π=19.10V,θ2=90°,A3=202/
π=9.00V,θ3=135°,A4=0,θ4=0°,A5=5.40V,θ5=45°,ω0=2πT=2π(1000)5=4
Thus, using the first five nonzero terms of the Fourier series,
v( t ) = 15+27.01cos( 400πt−45° ) + 19.10cos( 800πt−90° ) + 9.00cos(
1200πt−135° ) + 5.40cos( 2000πt−45° ) + ⋯ V.
2. The voltage is applied to the terminals of a resistor, so we can find the
power associated with each term as follows:
Pdc=15215=15W,P1=12 27.01215=24.32W,P2=12 19.10215=12.16W,P3
3. To obtain the total average power delivered to the 15Ω resistor, we first
calculate the rms value ofv(t):
Vrms=(60)2(T/4)T=900=30V.
The total average power delivered to the 15Ω resistor is
PT=30215=60W.
4. The total power delivered by the first five nonzero terms is
P=Pdc+P1+P2+P3+P5=55.15W.
This is (55.15/60) (100), or 91.92% of the total.

16.7 The rms Value of a Periodic
Function
The rms value of a periodic function can be expressed in terms of the Fourier
coefficients; by definition,
Frms=1T∫t0t0+Tf(t)2dt.
Replacing f(t) with its Fourier series representation gives
Frms=1T∫t0t0+T[av+∑n=1∞An cos (nω0t−θn)]2 dt.
The integral of the squared time function simplifies because the only terms
whose integral over one period are not zero are the square of the dc term and
the square of the terms at each frequency. Therefore,
Frms=1T (av2T+∑n=1∞T2An2)= av2+∑n=1∞An22= av2+∑n=1∞(An2)2.
(16.31)
We can use Eq. 16.31 to find the rms value of a periodic function by adding
the square of the rms value of each harmonic to the square of the dc value
and taking the square root of that sum. For example, let’s assume that a
periodic voltage is represented by the finite series
v = 10+30cos( ω 0 t− θ 1 )+20cos( 2 ω 0 t− θ 2 ) + 5cos( 3 ω 0 t− θ 3
) + 2cos( 5 ω 0 t− θ 5 ).
The rms value of this voltage is
V=102 + (30/2)2 + (20/2)2 + (5/2)2 + (2/2)2=764.5=27.65V.
Because the number of terms in a Fourier series representation of a periodic
function is usually infinite, Eq. 16.31 yields an estimate of the actual rms
value. We illustrate this result in Example 16.6.

Example 16.6 Estimating the rms
Value of a Periodic Function
Use Eq. 16.31 to estimate the rms value of the voltage in Example 16.5.
Solution
From Example 16.5,
Vdc=15V,V1=27.01/2V,        the rms value of the fundamental,V2=19.10/2V, 
Therefore,
Vrms=152 + (27.012)2 + (19.102)2 + (9.002)2 + (5.402)2=28.76V.
From Example 16.5, the actual rms value is 30 V. We can get closer to this
value by including more and more harmonics in Eq. 16.31. For example, if
we include the harmonics through k=9, the estimated rms value is 29.32 V.

16.8 The Exponential Form of the
Fourier Series
The exponential form of the Fourier series is a concise representation of the
series, given by
f(t)=∑n=−∞∞Cnejnω0t, (16.32)
where
Cn=1T∫t0t0+Tf(t)e−jnω0t dt. (16.33)
To derive Eqs. 16.32 and 16.33, start with Eq. 16.2 and replace the cosine
and sine functions with their exponential equivalents:
cosnω0t=ejnω0t+e−jnω0t2,sinnω0t=ejnω0t−e−jnω0t2j.
Substituting the exponential equivalents into Eq. 16.2 gives
f(t)=av +∑n=1∞an2(ejnω0t + e−jnω0t) + bn2j(ejnω0t − e−jnω0t)=av + 
∑n=1∞(an−jbn2)ejnω0t + (an+jbn2)e−jnω0t. (16.34)
Now we define Cn as
Cn=12(an−jbn)=An2∠ −θn_,n=1, 2, 3, ⋯.
From the definition of Cn,
Cn=12[2T∫t0t0+Tf(t) cosnω0tdt − j 2T∫t0t0+Tf(t) sinnω0tdt]=1T∫t0t0+Tf(t)
(cosnω0t−jsinnω0t) dt=1T∫t0t0+Tf(t) e−jnω0tdt,
which completes the derivation of Eq. 16.33. To complete the derivation of
Eq. 16.32, we first observe from Eq. 16.33 that
C0=1T∫t0t0+Tf(t)dt=av.

Next we note that
C−n=1T∫t0t0+Tf(t)ejnω0tdt=Cn*=12(an+jbn).
Substituting the expressions for C0, Cn, and Cn* into Eq. 16.34 yields
f(t)=C0+∑n=1∞(Cnejnω0t+Cn*e−jnω0t)=∑n=0∞Cnejnω0t+∑n=1∞Cn*e
−jnω0t.
Note that the second summation on the right-hand side is equivalent to
summing Cnejnω0t from −1 to −∞; that is,
∑n=1∞Cn*e−jnω0t=∑n=−1−∞Cnejnω0t.
Because the summation from −1 to −∞ is the same as the summation from
−∞ to −1, we can rewrite f(t) as
f(t)=∑n=0∞Cnejnω0t+∑−∞−1Cnejnω0t=∑−∞∞Cnejnω0t,
which completes the derivation of Eq. 16.32.
We can also find the rms value of a periodic function using the complex
Fourier coefficients. From Eqs. 16.21 and 16.31,
Frms=av2+∑n=1∞an2+bn22,|Cn|=an2+bn22,C02=av2.
Therefore:
Frms=C02+2∑n=1∞|Cn|2. (16.35)

Using −τ/2 as the starting point for the integration, we have, from Eq. 16.33,

Since v(t) has even symmetry, bn=0 for all n, and we expect Cn to be real.
Moreover, the amplitude of Cn follows a (sinx)/x distribution, as indicated
when we rewrite
Cn=VmτT sin (nω0τ/2)nω0τ/2.

16.9 Amplitude and Phase Spectra
As we have noted, we generally cannot visualize what a periodic function
looks like in the time domain from its Fourier series representation.
Nevertheless, we recognize that the Fourier coefficients characterize the
periodic function completely.
We can describe a periodic function by plotting the amplitude and phase
angle of each term in its Fourier series versus frequency. The plot of each
term’s amplitude versus the frequency is called the amplitude spectrum of
f(t), and the plot of each term’s phase angle versus the frequency is called the
phase spectrum of f(t). Because the amplitude and phase angle are defined at
discrete frequency values (that is, at ω0, 2ω0, 3ω0, …), these plots are also
called line spectra.
Amplitude and phase spectra plots are based on either Eq. 16.20 (An and
−θn) or Eq. 16.32 (Cn). We focus on Eq. 16.32 and leave the plots based on
Eq. 16.20 to the problems. For example, consider the periodic voltage in Fig.
16.16. From Example 16.6,
Cn=VmτTsin (nω0τ/2)nω0τ/2,
From the expression for Cn, we see that the amplitude spectrum is bounded
by the envelope of the |(sinx)/x| function. Figure 16.17 provides the plot of |
(sinx)/x| versus x, where x is in radians. It shows that the function’s value is
zero whenever x is an integral multiple of π. Replacing ω0 with 2π/T in the
argument of the sine function in the expression for Cn,
Figure 16.17 The plot of (sin
x)/x versus x.

Figure 16.17 Full Alternative Text
nω0(τ2)=nπ τT=nπT/τ.
We can therefore deduce that the amplitude spectrum goes through zero
whenever nτ/T is an integer. As the reciprocal of τ/T becomes an increasingly
larger integer, the number of harmonics between every π radians increases. If
nπ/T is not an integer, the amplitude spectrum still follows the |(sinx)/x|
envelope. However, the envelope is not zero at an integral multiple of ω0.
Because Cn is real for all n, the phase angle associated with Cn is either zero
or 180°, depending on its algebraic sign.
Now, what happens to the amplitude and phase spectra if f(t) is shifted along
the time axis? To find out, we shift the periodic voltage in Example 16.6 t0
units to the right. By hypothesis,
v(t)=∑n=−∞∞Cnejnω0t.
Therefore
v(t−t0)=∑n=−∞∞Cnejnω0(t−t0)=∑n=−∞Cne−jnω0t0ejnω0t,

which indicates that shifting the origin has no effect on the amplitude
spectrum, because
|Cn|=|Cne−jnω0t0|.
However, the phase spectrum has changed to −(θn + nω0t0) rads.
Example 16.8 plots the amplitude and phase spectra for a specific instance of
the periodic voltage in Example 16.7.
Example 16.8 Plotting the
Amplitude and Phase Spectra for a

Solution
a)
Substituting the values for Vm and t into the expression for Cn from Example
16.7 and simplifying, we get
Cn=sin(nπ/5)nπ/5.
The values of Cn for n between –10 and +10 are tabulated at right. Since Cn

is a real number for all values of n, its magnitude is the absolute value of Cn
and its phase angle is 0° if Cn is positive and 180° if Cn is negative. The
amplitude and phase spectra are plotted in Fig. 16.18.

Consider the narrowband op amp bandpass filter shown in Fig. 16.20(a). The

know that the square wave is composed of an infinite sum of sinusoids, one
sinusoid at the same frequency as the square wave and all of the remaining
sinusoids at integer multiples of that frequency. What effect will the filter
have on this input sum of sinusoids?

vg(t)=4Aπ∑n=1,3,5,…∞1n sin nπ2 cosnω0t
where A=15.65πV. The first three terms of this Fourier series are given by
vg(t)=62.6cosω0t−20.87cos3ω0t+12.52cos5ω0t−…V.
The period of the square wave is 50π μs, so the frequency of the square wave
is 40,000 rad/s.
The transfer function for the bandpass filter in Fig. 16.20(a) is
H(s)=Kβss2+βs+ω02
where K=400/313, β=2000 rad/s, ω0=40,000 rad/s. This filter has a quality
factor of 40,000/2000=20. Note that the center frequency of the bandpass
filter equals the frequency of the input square wave.
Multiply each term of the Fourier series representation of the square wave,

represented as a phasor, by the transfer function H(s) evaluated at the
frequency of the term in the Fourier series to get the representation of the
output voltage of the filter as a Fourier series:
vo(t)=−80 cosω0t−0.5 cos 3ω0t+0.17 cos 5ω0t+⋯V.
Notice the selective nature of the bandpass filter, which effectively amplifies
the fundamental frequency component of the input square wave and
attenuates all of the harmonic components.
Now make the following changes to the bandpass filter of Fig. 16.20(a)—let
R1=391.25Ω, R2=74.4Ω, R3=1kΩ, and C1=C2=0.1μF. The transfer function
for the filter, H(s), has the same form given above, but now K=400/313,
β=20,000 rad/s, ω0=40,000 rad/s. The passband gain and center frequency are
unchanged, but the bandwidth has increased by a factor of 10. This makes the
quality factor 2, and the resulting bandpass filter is less selective than the
original filter. We can see this by looking at the output voltage of the filter as
a Fourier series:
vo(t)=−80 cos ω0t−5 cos 3ω0t+1.63 cos 5ω0t+⋯V.
At the fundamental frequency, the output has the same amplification factor,
but the higher harmonic components have not been attenuated as significantly
as they were when the filter with Q=20 was used. Figure 16.21 plots the first
three terms of the Fourier series representations of the input square wave and
the resulting output waveforms for the two bandpass filters. Note the nearly

Summary
A periodic function is a function that repeats itself every T seconds. A
period is the smallest time interval (T) that a periodic function can be
shifted to produce a function identical to itself. (See page 618.)
The Fourier series is an infinite series used to represent a periodic
function. The series consists of a constant term and infinitely many
harmonically related cosine and sine terms. (See page 621.)
The fundamental frequency is the frequency determined by the
fundamental period (f0=1/T or ω0=2πf0). (See page 621.)
The harmonic frequency is an integer multiple of the fundamental
frequency. (See page 621.)
The Fourier coefficients are the constant term and the coefficient of
each cosine and sine term in the series. (See Eqs. 16.3–16.5.) (See page
622.)
Five types of symmetry are used to simplify the computation of the
Fourier coefficients:
even, in which all sine terms in the series are zero;
odd, in which all cosine terms and the constant term are zero;
half-wave, in which all even harmonics are zero;
quarter-wave, half-wave, even, in which the series contains only
odd harmonic cosine terms;
quarter-wave, half-wave, odd, in which the series contains only odd
harmonic sine terms.
(See page 625.)

In the alternative form of the Fourier series, each harmonic represented
by the sum of a cosine and sine term is combined into a single term of
the form Ancos(nω0t−θn). (See page 631.)
For steady-state response, the Fourier series of the output signal is
determined by first finding the output for each component of the input
signal. The individual responses are added (superimposed) to form the
Fourier series of the output signal. The response to the individual terms
in the input series is found by either frequency domain or s-domain
analysis. (See page 633.)
The waveform of the output signal is difficult to obtain without the aid
of a computer. Sometimes the frequency response (or filtering)
characteristics of the circuit can be used to ascertain how closely the
output waveform matches the input waveform. (See page 635.)
Only harmonics of the same frequency interact to produce average
power. The total average power is the sum of the average powers
associated with each frequency. (See page 640.)
The rms value of a periodic function can be estimated from the Fourier
coefficients. (See Eqs. 16.31 and 16.35.) (See page 641.)
The Fourier series of a periodic signal may also be written in
exponential form by using Euler’s identity to replace the cosine and sine
terms with their exponential equivalents. (See page 642.)
An amplitude spectrum plots the amplitudes of a function’s Fourier
series representation versus discrete frequencies. A phase spectrum plots
the phase angles of a function’s Fourier series representation versus
discrete frequencies. These plots help to visualize the transformation of
a circuit’s input signal to its output signal. (See page 645.)

Chapter Objectives
1. Be able to calculate the Fourier transform of a function using any or all
of the following:
The definition of the Fourier transform;
Laplace transforms;
Mathematical properties of the Fourier transform;
Operational transforms.
2. Know how to use the Fourier transform to find the response of a circuit.
3. Understand Parseval’s theorem and be able to use it to answer questions
about the energy contained within specific frequency bands.
In Chapter 16, we represented periodic functions with a Fourier series. This
series describes the periodic function using the frequency-domain attributes
of amplitude and phase angle. The Fourier transform extends this
frequency-domain representation to functions that are not periodic. But we
have already transformed aperiodic functions from the time domain to the
frequency domain, using the Laplace transform. You may wonder, then, why
yet another type of transformation is necessary.
Strictly speaking, the Fourier transform is not a new transform. It is a special
case of the bilateral Laplace transform, with the real part of the complex
frequency set to zero. However, in terms of a physical interpretation, the
Fourier transform is better viewed as a limiting case of a Fourier series. We
present this point of view in Section 17.1, where we derive the Fourier
transform equations.
The Fourier transform is more useful than the Laplace transform in certain
communications theory and signal-processing applications. Although we
cannot pursue the Fourier transform in depth, its introduction here seems

appropriate while the ideas underlying the Laplace transform and the Fourier
series are still fresh in your mind.
Practical Perspective
Filtering Digital Signals
It is common to use telephone lines to communicate information from one
computer to another. As you may know, computers represent all information
as collections of 1’’s and 0’’s. The value 1 is represented as a voltage, usually
5 V, and 0 is represented as 0 V, as shown below. The telephone line has a
frequency response characteristic that is similar to a low-pass filter. We can
use Fourier transforms to understand the effect of transmitting a digital value
using a telephone line that behaves like a filter.

17.1 The Derivation of the Fourier
Transform
We derive the Fourier transform, viewed as a limiting case of a Fourier series
and using the exponential form of the series:
f(t)=∑n=−∞∞Cnejnω0t, (17.1)
where
Cn=1T∫−T/2T/2f(t)e−jnω0t dt. (17.2)
In Eq. 17.2, we elected to start the integration at t0=-T/2.
If the period T increases without limit, f(t) transitions from a periodic to an
aperiodic function. In other words, if T is infinite, f(t) never repeats itself and
hence is aperiodic. As T increases, the separation between adjacent harmonic
frequencies becomes smaller and smaller. In particular,
Δω=(n+1)ω0−nω0=ω0=2πT,
and as T gets larger and larger, the incremental separation Δω approaches a
differential separation dω. Therefore,
1T→dω2π     as    T→∞.
As the period increases, the frequency is no longer a discrete variable but is
instead a continuous variable, or
nω0→ω     as    T→∞.
We can also see from Eq. 17.2 that, as the period increases, the Fourier
coefficients Cn get smaller. In the limit, Cn→0 as T→∞. This result makes
sense because we expect the Fourier coefficients to vanish when the function
is no longer periodic. Note, however, the limiting value of the product CnT;

that is,
CnT→∫−∞∞f(t)e−jωt dt     as     T→∞.
In writing the limiting value of CnT, we replaced nω0 with ω. The integral
represents the Fourier transform of f(t) and is denoted
Fourier Transform
F(ω)=F{f(t)}=∫−∞∞f(t)e−jωt dt.(17.3)
We obtain an explicit expression for the inverse Fourier transform by
investigating the limiting form of Eq. 17.1 as T→∞. We begin by multiplying
and dividing Eq. 17.1 by T:
f(t)=∑n=−∞∞(CnT)ejnω0t(1T).
As T→∞, the summation approaches integration, CnT→F(ω), nω0→ω, and
1/T→dω/2π. Thus, in the limit, f(t) becomes
Inverse Fourier Transform
f(t)=12π∫−∞∞F(ω)ejωt dω.(17.4)
Equations 17.3 and 17.4 define the Fourier transform. Equation 17.3
transforms the time-domain expression f(t) into its corresponding frequency-
domain expression F(ω). Equation 17.4 defines the inverse operation,
transforming F(ω) intof(t).
Let’s now derive the Fourier transform of the pulse shown in Fig. 17.1. Note
that this pulse corresponds to the periodic voltage in Example 16.7 if we let
T→∞. The Fourier transform of v(t) comes directly from Eq. 17.3:
V(ω)=∫−τ/2τ/2Vme−jωt dt=Vme−jωt(−jω)|−τ/2τ/2=Vm−jω(−2jsinωτ2),

Figure 17.1 A voltage pulse.
Figure 17.1 Full Alternative Text
which can be written in the form (sinx)/x by multiplying the numerator and
denominator by τ/2. Then,
V(ω)=Vmτsinωτ/2ωτ/2. (17.5)
For the periodic voltage pulses in Example 16.7, the expression for the
Fourier coefficients is
Cn=VmτTsin nω0τ/2nω0τ/2. (17.6)
Compare Eqs. 17.5 and 17.6. Note that as the time-domain function goes
from periodic to aperiodic, the amplitude spectrum goes from a discrete line
spectrum to a continuous spectrum. Furthermore, the envelope of the line
spectrum has the same shape as the continuous spectrum. Thus, as T
increases, the lines in the spectrum get closer together and their amplitudes

get smaller, but their envelope doesn’’t change shape. The physical
interpretation of the Fourier transform V(ω) is therefore a measure of the
frequency content of v(t). Figure 17.2 illustrates these observations. The
amplitude spectrum plot is based on the assumption that τ is constant and T is
increasing.

17.2 The Convergence of the
Fourier Integral
A function of time f(t) has a Fourier transform if the integral in Eq. 17.3
converges. If f(t) is a well-behaved function that differs from zero over a
finite interval of time, convergence is no problem. Well-behaved implies that
f(t) is single valued and encloses a finite area over the range of integration. In
practical terms, all pulses of finite duration that interest us are well-behaved
functions. The evaluation of the Fourier transform of the rectangular pulse
discussed in Section 17.1 illustrates this point.
If f(t) is different from zero over an infinite interval, the convergence of the
Fourier integral depends on the behavior of f(t) as t→∞. A single-valued
function that is nonzero over an infinite interval has a Fourier transform if the
integral
∫−∞∞|  f(t)  | dt
exists and if any discontinuities in f(t) are finite. An example is the decaying
exponential function illustrated in Fig. 17.3. The Fourier transform of f(t) is

exponential function Ke-atu(t).

A third important group of functions has great practical interest, but these
functions do not, in a strict sense, have Fourier transforms. For example, the
integral in Eq. 17.3 doesn’’t converge if f(t) is a constant. The same can be
said if f(t) is a sinusoidal function, cos ω0t, or a step function, Ku(t). These
functions are very important in circuit analysis, but, to include them in
Fourier analysis, we must resort to the following mathematical
manipulations.
Create a function in the time domain that has a Fourier transform and at
the same time can be made arbitrarily close to the function of interest.
Call the approximating function f′(t).
Find the Fourier transform of the approximating function, F′(ω), and
then evaluate the limiting value of F′(ω) as f'(t) approaches f(t).
Define the limiting value of F′(ω) as the Fourier transform of f(t).
Example 17.1 illustrates this three-step process.

The Fourier transform of f'(t) is
F′(ω)=∫−∞0Ae∈te−jωtdt+∫0∞Ae−∈te−jωtdt.
Evaluating the integrals gives
F′(ω)=A∈−jω+A∈+jω=2∈A∈2+ ω2.
This function generates an impulse function at ω=0 as ∈→0. You can verify
this result by showing that
F′(ω) approaches infinity at ω=0 as ∈→0.
The width of F′(ω) approaches zero as ∈→0.
The area under F′(ω) is independent of ∈.
The area under F′(ω) is the strength of the impulse and is
∫−∞∞2∈A∈2+ ω2dω=4∈A∫0∞dω∈2+ ω2=2πA.

In the limit, f'(t) approaches a constant A, and F′(ω) approaches an impulse
function 2πAΔ(ω). Therefore, the Fourier transform of a constant A is
defined as 2πAΔ(ω), or
F{A}=2πAΔ(ω).

In Section 17.4, we say more about Fourier transforms defined through a

limit process. Before doing so, in Section 17.3, we use the Laplace transform
to find the Fourier transform of functions for which the Fourier integral
converges.

17.3 Using Laplace Transforms to
Find Fourier Transforms
We can use a table of unilateral, or one-sided, Laplace transform pairs to find
the Fourier transform for functions whose Fourier integral converges. The
Fourier integral converges when the poles of F(s) lie in the left half of the s
plane. Note that if F(s) has poles in the right half of the s plane or along the
imaginary axis, f(t) does not satisfy the constraint that ∫−∞∞|  f(t)  | dt exists.
The following rules apply when using Laplace transforms to find the Fourier
transforms of such functions.
1. If f(t) is zero for t≤0−, replace s by jω in the Laplace transform of f(t) to
get the Fourier transform of f(t). Thus
ℱ{ f(t) }=ℒ{ f(t) }s=jω.(17.7)
2. A negative-time function is nonzero for negative values of time and zero
for positive values of time. The Fourier transform of a negative-time
function exists because the range of integration on the Fourier integral
goes from -∞ to +∞. To find the Fourier transform of such a negative-
time function, reflect the function over to the positive time domain and
find its one-sided Laplace transform. Replace s with -jω in the Laplace
transform to get the Fourier transform of the original time function.
Therefore,
F{f(t)}=L{f(-t)}s=-jω. (17.8)
3. Functions that are nonzero over all time can be resolved into positive-
and negative-time functions. We use Eqs. 17.7 and 17.8 to find the
Fourier transform of the positive- and negative-time functions,
respectively. The Fourier transform of the original function is the sum of
the two transforms. Thus, if we let

f+(t)=f(t)(for t>0),f−(t)=f(t)(for t<0),
then
f(t)=f+(t) + f-(t)
and
F{ f(t) }=F{ f+(t) }+F{ f−(t) }=L{ f+(t) }s=jω+L{ f−(−t) }s=−jω. (17.9)
If f(t) is even, Eq. 17.9 reduces to
F{f(t)}=L{f(t)}s=jω+L{f(t)}s=-jω.
If f(t) is odd, then Eq. 17.9 becomes
F{f(t)}=L{f(t)}s=jω-L{f(t)}s=-jω.
Example 17.2 uses the Laplace transform to find the Fourier transform.
Example 17.2 Finding the Fourier
Transform from the Laplace
Transform
Use the Laplace transform to find the Fourier transform for each of the
following functions:
1. f(t)=0,t≤0−;f(t)=e−at cos ω0t, t≥0+.
2. f(t)=0,t ≥ 0+;f(t)=eatcos ω0t, t ≤ 0−.
3. f(t)=e-a|t|.
Solution

1. Using Rule 1, find the Laplace transform of f(t) and substitute jω for s to
get F(ω). Therefore,
F{f(t)}=s+a(s+a)2+ω02|s=jω=jω+a(jω+a)2+ω02.
2. This is a negative-time function. Using Rule 2, reflect the function over
to the positive-time domain to get
f(−t)=0,(for t≤0−);f(−t)=e−atcosω0t,(for t≥0+).
Both f(t) and its mirror image are plotted in Fig. 17.5. The Fourier
transform of f(t) is
Figure 17.5 The reflection of
a negative-time function over
to the positive-time domain.

F{ f(t) }=L{ f(−t) }s=−jω=s+a(s+a)2+ω02|s=−jω=−jω+a(−jω+a)2+ω02.
3. This function is defined for all positive and negative time. Using Rule 3,
we find that the positive- and negative-time functions are
f+(t)=e-at   and   f-(t)=eat.
Find the Laplace transform of f+(t) and f-(-t):
L{ f+(t) }=1s+a,L{ f−(−t) }=1s+a.
Therefore, from Eq. 17.9,
F{ e−a| t | }=1s + a|s=jω + 1s + a|s=−jω=1jω+a+1−jω+a=2aω2+a2.

17.4 Fourier Transforms in the
Limit
As we pointed out in Section 17.2, the Fourier transforms of several practical
functions must be defined by a limit process. We now return to these types of
functions and develop their transforms.
The Fourier Transform of a Signum
Function
We showed that the Fourier transform of a constant A is 2πAΔ(ω) in
Example 17.1. Another function of interest is the signum function, defined as
+1 for t>0 and -1 for t<0. The signum function is denoted sgn(t) and can be
expressed in terms of unit step functions as
sgn (t)=u(t)-u(-t). (17.10)
Figure 17.6 shows the function graphically.
Figure 17.6 The signum
function.

Figure 17.6 Full Alternative Text
To find the signum function’’s Fourier transform, create a function that
approaches the signum function in the limit:
sgn (t)=lim∈→0[e-∈tu(t)-e∈tu(-t)],   ∈>0.
The function inside the brackets, plotted in Fig. 17.7, has a Fourier transform
because the Fourier integral converges. Since f(t) is an odd function, its
Fourier transform is:
Figure 17.7 A function that
approaches sgn (t) as ∈
approaches zero.

Figure 17.7 Full Alternative Text
F {f(t)}=1s +∈|s=jω−1s +∈|s=−jω=1jω + ∈−1−jω + ∈=−2jωω2+∈2.
As ∈→0, f(t)→sgn(t), and F {f(t)}→2/jω. Therefore,
ℱ{sgn (t)}=2jω.
The Fourier Transform of a Unit
Step Function
To find the Fourier transform of a unit step function, we use the Fourier
transforms of a constant and the signum function. Note that the unit step
function can be expressed as
u(t)=12+12sgn (t).
Thus,

F { u(t) }=F { 12 }+F { 12sgn (t) }=πΔ(ω)+1jω.
The Fourier Transform of a Cosine
Function
To find the Fourier transform of cos ω0t, we return to the inverse-transform
integral of Eq. 17.4 and observe that if
F(ω)=2πΔ(ω-ω0),
then
f(t)=12π∫−∞∞[2πΔ(ω−ω0)]ejωt dω.
Using the sifting property of the impulse function, we simplify f(t) to
f(t)=ejω0t.
Therefore,
F {ejω0t}=2πΔ(ω-ω0).
We now use the Fourier transform of ejω0t to find the Fourier transform of
cos ω0t because
cos ω0t=ejω0t+e-jω0t2.
Thus,
F { cos ω0t }=12(F { ejω0t }+F {e−jω0t })=12[2πΔ(ω−ω0)+2πΔ(ω
+ω0)]=πΔ(ω−ω0)+πΔ(ω+ω0).
The Fourier transform of sin ω0t involves similar manipulation, which we
leave for Problem 17.4. Table 17.1 presents a summary of the transform pairs
of the important elementary functions.

Table 17.1 Fourier Transforms
of Elementary Functions
We now turn to the properties of the Fourier transform that help us describe
aperiodic time-domain behavior in terms of frequency-domain behavior.

17.5 Some Mathematical Properties
We begin by noting that F(ω) is a complex quantity and can be expressed in
either rectangular or polar form. Thus, from the defining integral,
F(ω)=∫−∞∞f(t)e−jωtdt=∫−∞∞f(t)(cos ωt−j sin ωt) dt=∫−∞∞f(t) cos ωt dt−j∫
−∞∞f(t) sin ωt dt.
Now we let
A(ω)=∫−∞∞f(t) cos ωt dtB(ω)=∫−∞∞f(t) sin ωt dt.
Thus, using the definitions for A(ω) and B(ω), we get
F(ω)=A(ω)+jB(ω)=| F(ω) |ejθ(ω).
We can make the following observations about F(ω):
The real part of F(ω)—that— is, A(ω)—is an even function of ω, so
A(ω)=A(-ω).
The imaginary part of F(ω)——that is, B(ω)——is an odd function of
ω, so B(ω)=-B(-ω).
The magnitude of F(ω)—that— is, A2(ω)+B2(ω)—is— an even
function of ω.
The phase angle of F(ω)—that is, θ(ω)=tan-1B(ω)/A(ω)—is an odd
function of ω.
Replacing ω by -ω generates the conjugate of F(ω), so F(-ω)=F*(ω).
Hence, if f(t) is an even function, F(ω) is real, and if f(t) is an odd function,
F(ω) is imaginary. If f(t) is even,
A(ω)=2∫0∞f(t)cos ωt dt (17.11)

and
B(ω)=0.
If f(t) is an odd function,
A(ω)=0
and
B(ω)=−2∫0∞f(t)sin ωt dt.
We leave the derivations for you as Problems 17.10 and 17.11.
If f(t) is an even function, its Fourier transform is an even function, and if f(t)
is an odd function, its Fourier transform is an odd function. Moreover, if f(t)
is an even function, from the inverse Fourier integral,
f(t)=12π∫−∞∞F(ω)ejωtdω=12π∫−∞∞A(ω)ejωtdω=12π∫−∞∞A(ω)
(cosωt+jsinωt)dω=12π∫−∞∞A(ω)cosωt dω+0=22π∫0∞A(ω)cosωt dω.(17.12)
Now compare Eq. 17.12 with Eq. 17.11. Note that, except for a factor of
1/2π, these two equations have the same form. Thus, the waveforms of A(ω)
and f(t) become interchangeable if f(t) is an even function.
For example, we have already observed that a rectangular pulse in the time
domain produces a frequency spectrum of the form (sin ω)/ω. Specifically,
Eq. 17.5 expresses the Fourier transform of the voltage pulse shown in Fig.
17.1. Hence, a rectangular pulse in the frequency domain must be generated
by a time-domain function of the form (sin t)/t. We can illustrate this
transform by finding the time-domain function f(t) corresponding to the
frequency spectrum shown in Fig. 17.8. From Eq. 17.12,
Figure 17.8 A rectangular
frequency spectrum.

f(t)=22π∫0ω0/2M cos ωt dω=2M2π(sin ωtt)|0ω0/2=12π(Msin ω0t/2t/2)=12π (M
We say more about the frequency spectrum of a rectangular pulse in the time
domain versus the rectangular frequency spectrum of (sin t)/t after we
introduce Parseval’’s theorem.

17.6 Operational Transforms
Fourier transforms, like Laplace transforms, can be classified as functional
and operational. So far, we have concentrated on the functional transforms.
We now discuss some of the important operational Fourier transforms, which
are similar to the operational Laplace transforms in Chapter 12. Hence, we
leave their proofs to you as Problems 17.12–17.19.
Multiplication by a Constant
From the defining integral, if
F {f(t)}=F(ω),
then
F {Kf(t)}=KF(ω).
Thus, multiplication of f(t) by a constant corresponds to multiplying F(ω) by
that same constant.
Addition (Subtraction)
Addition (subtraction) in the time domain translates into addition
(subtraction) in the frequency domain. Thus, if
F{f1(t) }=F1(ω),F{ f2(t) }=F2(ω),F{ f3(t) }=F3(ω),
then
F {f1(t)-f2(t)+f3(t)}=F1(ω)-F2(ω)+F3(ω),
which is derived by substituting the algebraic sum of time-domain functions

into the defining integral.
Differentiation
The Fourier transform of the first derivative of f(t) is
F {df(t)dt}=jωF(ω).
The nth derivative of f(t) is
F {dnf(t)dtn}=(jω)nF(ω).
These equations are valid if f(t) is zero at ±∞.
Integration
If
g(t)=∫−∞tf(x) dx,
then
F {g(t)}=F(ω)jω.
This equation is valid if
∫−∞∞f(x) dx=0.
Scale Change
Dimensionally, time and frequency are reciprocals. Therefore, when time is
expanded, frequency is compressed (and vice versa), as reflected in the
functional transform

F {f(at)}=1aF(ωa),   a>0.
Note that when 0<a<1.0, time is expanded, whereas when a>1.0, time is
compressed.
Translation in the Time Domain
Translating a function in the time domain alters the phase spectrum and
leaves the amplitude spectrum unchanged. Thus
F {f(t-a)}=e-jωaF(ω).
If a is positive in this equation, the time function is delayed (shifted to the
right on the time axis), and if a is negative, the time function is advanced
(shifted to the left on the time axis).
Translation in the Frequency
Domain
Translation in the frequency domain corresponds to multiplication by the
complex exponential in the time domain:
F {ejω0tf(t)}=F(ω-ω0).
Modulation
Amplitude modulation varies the amplitude of a sinusoidal carrier. If the
carrier signal is f(t), the modulated carrier is f(t)cos ω0t. The amplitude
spectrum of the modulated carrier is one-half the amplitude spectrum of f(t)
and is centered at ±ω0, so,
F {f(t)cos ω0t}=12F(ω-ω0)+12F(ω+ω0).

Convolution in the Time Domain
Convolution in the time domain corresponds to multiplication in the
frequency domain. In other words,
y(t)=∫−∞∞x(λ)h(t−λ) dλ
becomes
F {y(t)}=Y(ω)=X(ω)H(ω). (17.13)
Equation 17.13 is important in Fourier transform applications because it
states that the output’s transform Y(ω) is the product of the input’s transform
X(ω) and the system function H(ω). We say more about this relationship in
Section 17.7.
Convolution in the Frequency
Domain
Convolution in the frequency domain corresponds to finding the Fourier
transform of the product of two time functions. Thus, if
f(t)=f1(t) f2(t),
then
F(ω)=12π∫−∞∞F1(u)F2(ω−u) du.
Table 17.2 summarizes these 10 operational transforms and another
operational transform that we introduce in Example 17.3.

Transforms

Example 17.3 Deriving an
Operational Fourier Transform
Find the Fourier transform for the function f(t)=tnf(t), assuming that
F(ω)=F {f(t)} is known.
Solution
From the definition of the Fourier transform in Eq. 17.3,
F(ω)=∫−∞∞f(t)e−jωtdt.
Take the derivative of both sides with respect to the frequency ω and
simplify:
dF(ω)dω=∫−∞∞ddω[ f(t)e−jωtdt]=−j∫−∞∞tf(t)e−jωtdt=−jF {tf(t) }.
Therefore,
F {tf(t)}=jdF(ω)dω.
Repeat this process, taking the second derivative of both sides of Eq. 17.3
with respect to ω:
d2F(ω)dω2=∫−∞∞d2dω2[ f(t)e−jωtdt ]=∫−∞∞(−jt)(−jt)f(t)e−jωtdt=(−j)2F {
t2f(t) }.
Therefore,
F {t2f(t)}=(j)2d2F(ω)dω2.
Now take the nth derivative of both sides of Eq. 17.3 with respect to ?:
dnF(ω)dωn=∫−∞∞dndωn[ f(t)e−jωtdt ]=∫−∞∞(−jt)nf(t)e−jωtdt=(−j)nF { tnf(t)
}.

Replacing (-j)n with 1/jn, we get
F {tnf(t)}=(j)ndnF(ω)dωn.
Therefore, the effect of multiplying a function by tn in the time domain
corresponds to finding the nth derivative of the function’’s Fourier transform
with respect to ω.

17.7 Circuit Applications
The Laplace transform is used more often than the Fourier transform when
finding a circuit’’s response to a nonperiodic input. This is because the
Laplace transform integral converges for a wider range of input functions and
it accommodates initial conditions. We can certainly use the Fourier
transform to find a circuit’s response to an input using Eq. 17.13, which
relates the transform of the output Y(ω) to the transform of the input X(ω)
and the transfer function H(ω) of the circuit. Note that H(ω) is the familiar
H(s), with s replaced by jω.
Example 17.4 uses the Fourier transform to find the response of a circuit.
Example 17.4 Using the Fourier
Transform to Find the Transient
Response
Use the Fourier transform to find io(t) in the circuit shown in Fig. 17.9. The
current source ig(t) is the signum function 20 sgn(t) A.
Figure 17.9 The circuit for
Example 17.4.

Figure 17.9 Full Alternative Text
Solution
The Fourier transform of the input is
Ig(ω)=F{ 20 sgn(t) }=20(2jω)=40jω.
The transfer function of the circuit is the ratio of Io to Ig, which we can find
using current division in the s domain:
Io=1ǁ(3+s)3+sIg=14+sIg.
Therefore,
H(s)=14+s
and

H(ω)=14+jω.
The Fourier transform of io(t) is
Io(ω)=Ig(ω)H(ω)=40jω(4+jω).
Expanding Io(ω) into a sum of partial fractions yields
Io(ω)=K1jω+K24+jω.
Evaluating K1 and K2 gives
K1=404=10,K2=40−4=−10.
Therefore
Io(ω)=10jω-104+jω.
Find the output current in the time domain using the functional and
operational Fourier transform tables, Tables 17.1 and 17.2. The result is
io(t)=F−1[ Io(ω) ]=5 sgn(t)−10e−4tu(t).
Figure 17.10 shows the response. Does the solution make sense in terms of
known circuit behavior? The answer is yes, based on the following analysis.
The current source delivers -20 A to the circuit between -∞ and 0, and
because the current is constant, the inductor behaves like a short circuit over
this time interval. Therefore, the resistance in each branch determines how
the -20 A divides between the two branches. One-fourth of the -20 A appears
in the io branch, so io is -5 A for t<0. When the current source jumps from
-20 A to +20 A at t=0, io approaches its final value of +5 A exponentially.
The equivalent resistance with respect to the inductor’s terminals is 4 Ω, so
the time constant of the exponential rise for t>0 is 14 s.

versus t.

Figure 17.10 Full Alternative Text
An important characteristic of the Fourier transform is that it gives us the
steady-state response to a sinusoidal input. There is no transient component
in the response because the Fourier transform of cos ω0t assumes that the
function exists over all time. Example 17.5 illustrates this feature.
Example 17.5 Using the Fourier
Transform to Find the Sinusoidal
Steady-State Response
Suppose the current source in the circuit in Example 17.4 (Fig. 17.9) changes
to a sinusoid, given by
ig(t)=50cos 3t A.
Use the Fourier transform method to find io(t).

Solution
The transform of the input current is
Ig(ω)=50π[Δ(ω-3)+Δ(ω+3)].
As before, the transfer function of the circuit is
H(ω)=14 + jω.
The transform of the current response then is
Io(ω)=50π Δ(ω-3) + Δ(ω+3)4 + jω.
To find the inverse transform of Io(ω) we begin with the inverse Fourier
transform intergral in Eq. 17.4, and then use the sifting property of the

17.8 Parseval’’s Theorem
Parseval’’s theorem relates the energy of a time-domain function having
finite energy to the Fourier transform of that function. Imagine that the time-
domain function f(t) is either the voltage across or the current in a 1 Ω
resistor. The energy of this function then is
W1Ω=∫−∞∞f2(t) dt.
Parseval’’s theorem says that we can also calculate this energy using a
frequency-domain integral:
W1Ω=∫−∞∞f2(t) dt=12π∫−∞∞| F(ω) |2 dω. (17.14)
Therefore, we can calculate the 1 Ω energy associated with f(t) either by
integrating the square of f(t) over all time or by integrating the square of the
magnitude of the Fourier transform of f(t) over all frequencies and
multiplying by 1/2π. Parseval’’s theorem is valid if both integrals exist.
The average power of time-domain signals with finite energy is zero when
averaged over all time. Therefore, when comparing such signals, we use the
energy content of the signals instead of their average power. Using a 1 Ω
resistor when making the energy calculation is convenient and lets us
compare the energy content of voltages and currents.
We begin deriving Eq. 17.14 by rewriting the left-hand side as f(t) times itself
and then expressing one f(t) in terms of the inversion integral:
∫−∞∞f2(t) dt=∫−∞∞f(t) f(t) dt=∫−∞∞f(t)[ 12π∫−∞∞F(ω)e jωt dω ] dt.
We move f(t) inside the interior integral because the integration is with
respect to ω, and then we factor the constant 1/2π outside both integrals.
Then,
∫−∞∞f2(t) dt=12π∫−∞∞[ ∫−∞∞F(ω) f(t)e jωt dω ] dt.

We reverse the order of integration and then factor F(ω) out of the integral
with respect to t. Thus
∫−∞∞f2(t) dt=12π∫−∞∞F(ω)[ ∫−∞∞f(t)e jωt dt ] dω.
The bracketed integral is F(-ω), so
∫−∞∞f2(t) dt=12π∫−∞∞F(ω) F(−ω) dω.
In Section 17.5, we noted that F(-ω)=F*(ω). Thus, the product F(ω) F(-ω) is
the magnitude of F(ω) squared, completing the derivation of Eq. 17.14. We
also noted that | F(ω) | is an even function of ω. Therefore, we can also write
Eq. 17.14 as
∫−∞∞f2(t) dt=1π∫0∞|F(ω)|2 dω. (17.15)
Demonstrating Parseval’’s Theorem
To demonstrate Eq. 17.15, suppose
f(t)=e-a|t|.
Substituting this f(t) into the left-hand side of Eq. 17.15 and evaluating the
left-hand side, we get
∫−∞∞e−2a| t | dt=∫−∞0e2at dt+∫0∞e−2at dt=e2at2a|−∞0+e−2at
−2a|0∞=12a+12a=1a.
The Fourier transform of f(t) is
F(ω)=2aa2+ω2,
and therefore the right-hand side of Eq. 17.15 evaluates to
1π∫0∞4a2(a2+ω2)2 dω=4a2π12a2 (ωω2+a2+1atan−1ωa) |0∞=2π (0+π2a
−0−0)=1a.

Note that both the left-hand side and the right-hand side of Eq. 17.15 evaluate
to 1/a.
Interpreting Parseval’’s Theorem
A physical interpretation of Parseval’’s theorem tells us that the magnitude of
the Fourier transform squared, | F(ω) |2, is an energy density (in joules per
hertz). To see this, change the variable of integration on the right-hand side of
Eq. 17.15, using ω=2πf. The result is
1π∫0∞| F(2πf) |22π df=2∫0∞| F(2πf) |2 df,
where | F(2πf) |2df is the energy in an infinitesimal band of frequencies (df),
and the total 1 Ω energy associated with f(t) is the sum (integral) of
| F(2πf) |2df over all frequencies.
We can also calculate the portion of the total energy for a specified frequency
band. For example, the 1 Ω energy in the frequency band from ω1 to ω2 is
W1Ω=1π∫ω1ω2|F(ω)|2 dω. (17.16)
Note that if we write the frequency-domain integral using
12π∫−∞∞| F(ω) |2 dω
instead of
1π∫0∞| F(ω) |2 dω,
we can rewrite Eq. 17.16 as
W1Ω=12π∫−ω2−ω1| F(ω) |2dω+12π∫ω2ω1| F(ω) |2dω. (17.17)

The current in a 40 Ω resistor is

Solution
The total energy dissipated in the 40 Ω resistor is
W40Ω=40∫0∞400e−4t dt=16,000 e−4t−4|0∞=4000 J.
We can check this total energy calculation with Parseval’’s theorem:
F(ω)=202+jω.
Therefore
|  F(ω) |=204+ω2
and
W40Ω=40π∫0∞4004+ω2 dω=16,000π (12 tan−1ω2|0∞)=8000π (π2)=4000 J.
The energy associated with the frequency band 0≤ω≤23 rad/s is
W40Ω=40π∫0234004+ω2 dω=16,000π (12 tan
−1 ω2|023)=8000π(π3)=80003 J.

1. What percentage of the input signal’’s 1 Ω energy is available in the

2. What percentage of the output energy is associated with the frequency

Solution
1. The 1 Ω energy in the input signal is
Wi=∫0∞(15e−5t)2 dt=225e−10t−10|0∞=22.5J.
The Fourier transform of the output voltage is
Vo(ω)=Vi(ω)H(ω),
where
Vi(ω)=155+jωH(ω)=1/RC1/RC+jω=1010+jω.
Hence
Vo(ω)=150(5+jω)(10+jω)|Vo(ω)|2=22,500(25+ω2)(100+ω2).
The 1 Ω energy available in the filter’’s output is
Wo=1π∫0∞22,500(25+ω2)(100+ω2) dω.
We can evaluate the integral using a sum of partial fractions:
22,500(25+ω2)(100+ω2)=30025+ω2-300100+ω2.
Then
Wo=300π{ ∫0∞dω25+ω2−∫0∞dω100+ω2 }=300π [ 15 (π2)−110 (π2)
]=15 J.

The energy available in the output signal therefore is 66.67% of the
energy available in the input signal; that is,
η=1522.5(100)=66.67%.
2. The output energy associated with the frequency range 0≤ω≤10 rad/s is
W′o=300π{ ∫010dω25 + ω2 −∫010dω100 + ω2 }=300π (15 tan
−1 105−110 tan−1 1010)=30π (2π2.84−π4)=13.64 J.
The total 1 Ω energy in the output signal is 15 J, so the percentage
associated with the frequency range 0 to 10 rad/s is 90.97%.

17.8-7 Full Alternative Text
The Fourier transform of the voltage pulse is plotted in Fig. 17.15(b).
Solution
To begin, substitute the Fourier transform of the voltage pulse into Eq. 17.16:
W=1π∫02π/τVm2τ2sin2ωτ/2(ωτ/2)2 dω.
To evaluate this integral, let x=ωτ/2, so dx=(τ/2)dω. Note that when ω=2π/τ,
x=π. Using these substitutions, the energy equation becomes
W=2Vm2τπ∫0πsin2xx2 dx.
Now we can integrate by parts. Let u=sin2x and dv=dx/x2, so du=2 sin x cos

x dx=sin 2x dx and v=-1/x. Therefore,
∫0πsin2xx2 dx=−sin2xx|0π−∫0π−1x sin 2x dx=0+∫0πsin 2xx dx
and
W=4Vm2τπ∫0πsin 2x2x dx.
To evaluate this integral, make another substitution of variables to get the
form sin y/y. Let y=2x so dy=2 dx, and y=2π when x=π. The resulting
equation is
W=2Vm2τπ∫02πsin yy dy.
The integral’s value can be found using an online calculator.1 Its value is
1.41815, so
1http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?
i=integrate+sin+x+%2F+x+from+0+to+2*pi
W=2Vm2τπ(1.41815).
To find the total 1 Ω energy associated with v(t), use either the time-domain
integral or the frequency-domain integral in Eq. 17.14. The total energy is
Wt=Vm2τ.
The fraction of the total energy associated with the band of frequencies
between 0 and 2π/τ is
η=WWt=2Vm2τ(1.41815)π(Vm2τ)=0.9028.
Therefore, approximately 90% of the energy associated with v(t) is contained
in the dominant portion of the amplitude spectrum.
Note that the plots in Fig. 17.15 show that as the width of the voltage pulse
(τ) becomes smaller, the dominant portion of the amplitude spectrum (that is,
the spectrum from -2π/τ to 2π/τ) spreads out over a wider range of
frequencies. This result agrees with our earlier comments about the

operational transform involving a scale change–when time is compressed,
frequency is expanded and vice versa. To transmit a single rectangular pulse
with reasonable fidelity, the bandwidth of the system must be at least wide
enough to accommodate the dominant portion of the amplitude spectrum.
Thus, the cutoff frequency should be at least 2π/τ rad/s, or 1/τ Hz.

Practical Perspective
Filtering Digital Signals
To understand the effect of transmitting a digital signal on a telephone line,
consider a pulse that represents a digital value of 1, as shown in Fig. 17.15(a),
with Vm=5 V and τ=1 µs. The Fourier transform of this pulse is shown in
Fig. 17.15(b), where the amplitude Vmτ=5 µV and the first positive zero-
crossing on the frequency axis is 2π / τ=6.28 Mrad / s=1 MHz.
Note that the digital pulse representing the value 1 is ideally a sum of an

infinite number of frequency components. But the telephone line cannot
transmit all of these frequency components. Typically, the line has a
bandwidth of 10 MHz, meaning that it is capable of transmitting only those
frequency components below 10 MHz. This causes the original pulse to be
distorted once it is received by the computer on the other end of the telephone
line, as seen in Fig. 17.16.

Summary
The Fourier transform gives a frequency-domain description of an
aperiodic time-domain function. Depending on the nature of the time-
domain signal, one of three approaches to finding its Fourier transform
may be used:
If the time-domain signal is a well-behaved pulse of finite duration,
the integral that defines the Fourier transform is used. (See page
662.)
If the one-sided Laplace transform of f(t) exists and all the poles of
F(s) lie in the left half of the s plane, F(s) may be used to find F(ω).
(See page 666.)
If f(t) is a constant, a signum function, a step function, or a
sinusoidal function, the Fourier transform is found by using a limit
process. (See page 668.)
Functional and operational Fourier transforms that are useful in circuit
analysis are tabulated in Tables 17.1 and 17.2. (See pages 670 and 675.)
The Fourier transform accommodates both negative- time and positive-
time functions and therefore is suited to problems whose signals start at
t=-∞. In contrast, the unilateral Laplace transform is suited to problems
with initial conditions and signals that exist for t>0. (See page 677.)
The Fourier transform of a response signal y(t) is
Y(ω)=X(ω)H(ω),
where X(ω) is the Fourier transform of the input signal x(t) and H(ω) is
the transfer function H(s) evaluated at s=jω. (See page 677.)
The magnitude of the Fourier transform squared is a measure of the
energy density (joules per hertz) in the frequency domain (Parseval’’s

theorem). Thus, the Fourier transform permits us to associate a fraction
of the total energy contained in f(t) with a specified band of frequencies.

1. 18.1 The Terminal Equations
2. 18.2 The Two-Port Parameters
3. 18.3 Analysis of the Terminated Two-Port Circuit
4. 18.4 Interconnected Two-Port Circuits

Chapter Objectives
1. Be able to calculate any set of two-port parameters with any of the
following methods:
Circuit analysis;
Measurements made on a circuit;
Converting from another set of two-port parameters using Table
18.1.
2. Be able to analyze a terminated two-port circuit to find currents,
voltages, impedances, and ratios of interest using Table 18.2.
3. Know how to analyze a cascade interconnection of two-port circuits.
We have frequently focused on the behavior of a circuit at a specified pair of
terminals. We introduced the Thévenin and Norton equivalent circuits to
simplify circuit analysis relative to one pair of terminals. But in some
electrical systems, a signal is fed into one pair of terminals, processed by the
system, and extracted at a second pair of terminals. We can simplify the
analysis of such systems using two pairs of terminals, each representing the
points, or ports, where signals are either input or output.
In this chapter, we present circuits that have one input and one output port.
Figure 18.1 on page 694 illustrates the basic two-port building block. We
make several assumptions when using the two-port model in Fig. 18.1 to
represent a circuit:
There is no energy stored within the circuit.
There are no independent sources within the circuit; dependent sources,
however, are permitted.
The current into a given port equals the current out of that port; that is,

i1=i′1 and i2=i′2.
All external connections must be made to either the input port or the
output port; no connections can be made between ports, that is, between
terminals a and c, a and d, b and c, or b and d.
These assumptions limit the types of circuits that can be represented by a
two-port model.
When we represent a circuit using a two-port model, we are only interested in
the circuit’s terminal variables (i1, v1, i2, and v2). We cannot use the two-
port model to find the currents and voltages inside the circuit. We have
already used such terminal behavior when analyzing operational amplifier
circuits. In this chapter, we formalize that approach by introducing the two-
port parameters.
Practical Perspective
Characterizing an Unknown Circuit
Up to this point, whenever we wanted to create a model of a circuit, we
needed to know what types of components make up the circuit, the values of
those components, and the interconnections among those components. But
what if we want to model a circuit that is inside a “black box,” where the
components, their values, and their interconnections are hidden?
In this chapter, we will discover that by making two simple measurements on
such a black box, we can create a model consisting of just four values—the
two-port parameter model for the circuit. We can then use the two-port
parameter model to predict the behavior of the circuit once we have attached
a power source to one of its ports and a load to the other port.
In this example, suppose we have found a circuit, enclosed in a casing, with
two wires extending from each side, as shown below. The casing is labeled
“amplifier,” and we want to determine whether or not it would be safe to use

this amplifier to connect a cd player modeled as a 2 V source to a speaker
modeled as a 32 Ω resistor with a power rating of 100 W.

18.1 The Terminal Equations
When we consider a circuit to be a two-port network, we want to relate the
current and voltage at one port to the current and voltage at the other port.
Figure 18.1 shows the reference polarities of the terminal voltages and the
reference directions of the terminal currents. The references at each port are
symmetric with respect to each other; that is, at each port the current is
directed into the upper terminal, and at each port the voltage rises from the
lower to the upper terminal.
Figure 18.1 The two-port
building block.
Figure 18.1 Full Alternative Text
The most general two-port network describes the circuit in the s domain. For
purely resistive circuits, we can analyze the time-domain circuit to find its

two-port network description. Two-port networks used to find sinusoidal
steady-state responses can be constructed by finding the appropriate s-domain
expressions and then replacing s with jω, or by using phasor techniques
directly. Here, we write all equations in the s domain; resistive networks and
sinusoidal steady-state solutions become special cases. Figure 18.2 shows the
basic building block in terms of the s-domain variables I1, V1, I2, and V2.
Figure 18.2 The s-domain two-
port basic building block.
Figure 18.2 Full Alternative Text
Only two of the four terminal variables are independent. Thus, for any circuit,
once we specify two of the variables, we can find the two remaining
unknowns. For example, knowing V1 and V2 and the circuit within the box,
we can find I1 and I2. The two-port network description consists of two
simultaneous equations. However, there are six different ways in which to
combine the four variables:
V1=z11I1+ z12I2,V2=z21I1+z22I2;(18.1)

I1=y11V1+y12V2,I2=y21V1+y22V2; (18.2)
V1=a11V2−a12I2,I1=a21V2−a22I2; (18.3)
V2=b11V1−b12I1,I2=b21V1−b22I1; (18.4)
V1=h11I1+h12V22,I2=h21I1+h22V22; (18.5)
I1=g11V1+g12I22,V2=g21V1+g22I22. (18.6)
These six sets of equations may also be considered as three pairs of
mutuallyinverse relations. The first set, Eqs. 18.1, gives the input and output
voltages asfunctions of the input and output currents. The second set, Eqs.
18.2, gives the inverserelationship, that is, the input and output currents as
functions of the inputand output voltages. Equations 18.3 and 18.4 areinverse
relations, as are Eqs. 18.5 and 18.6.
The coefficients of the current and/or voltage variables on the right-handside
of Eqs. 18.1–18.6 are called the parameters of thetwo-port circuit. Thus,
when using Eqs. 18.1, we refer to the z parameters of the circuit. Similarly,
we refer to the y parameters, the a parameters, the b parameters, the h
parameters, and the g parameters of the network.

18.2 The Two-Port Parameters
Wecan determine the parameters for any circuit by computation or
measurement. Thecomputations or measurements we need come from the
parameter equations. Forexample, suppose we want to find the z parameters
for a circuit. FromEqs. 18.1,
z11=V1I1|I2=0Ω, (18.7)
z12=V1I2|I1=0Ω, (18.8)
z21=V2I1|I2=0Ω, (18.9)
z22=V2I2|I1=0Ω. (18.10)
Equations 18.7–18.10 revealthat the four z parameters can be described as
follows:
z11 is the impedance seen looking intoport 1 when port 2 is open.
z12 is a transfer impedance. It is theratio of the port 1 voltage to the port
2 current when port 1 is open.
z21 is a transfer impedance. It is theratio of the port 2 voltage to the port
1 current when port 2 is open.
z22 is the impedance seen looking intoport 2 when port 1 is open.
Therefore, the impedance parametersmay be either calculated or measured by
first opening port 2 and determining theratios V1/I1 and V2/I1, and then
opening port 1 and determining the ratios V1/I2 and V2/I2.
Equations 18.7–18.10 showwhy the parameters in Eqs.18.1 are called the z
parameters.Each parameter is the ratio of a voltage to a current and therefore
is animpedance with the dimension of ohms.
We use the same process todetermine the remaining two-port parameters,
which are either calculated ormeasured. Finding a two-port parameter
requires that a port be either opened orshorted. The two-port parameters are

either impedances, admittances, ordimensionless ratios. The dimensionless
ratios are either ratios of two voltagesor two currents. Equations18.11–18.15
summarize these observations.
y11=I1V1|V2=0S,y12=I1V2|V1=0S,y21=I2V1|V2=0S, y22=I2V2|V1=0S.
(18.11)
a11=V1V2|I2=0,a12=−V1I2|V2=0Ω,a21=I1V2|I2=0S,a22=−I1I2|V2=0.
(18.12)
b11=V2V1|I1=0, b12=−V2I1|V1=0Ω,b21=I2V1|I1=0S, b22=−I2I1|V1=0.
(18.13)
h11=V1I1|V2=0Ω, h12=V1V2|I1=0,h21=I2I1|V2=0, h22=I2V2|I1=0S.
(18.14)
g11=I1V1|I2=0S,g12=I1I2|V1=0,g21=V2V1|I2=0,g22=V2I2|V1=0Ω. (18.15)
We also give descriptive names to the reciprocal sets of two-port parameters.
The impedance and admittance parameters are grouped into the immittance
parameters. An immittance is either an impedance or an admittance. The a
and b parameters are called the transmission parameters because they
describe the voltage and current at one end of the two-port network in terms
of the voltage and current at the other end. The immittance and transmission
parameters are the natural choices for relating the two-port variables because
they relate either voltage to current variables or input to output variables. In
contrast, the h and g parameters relate an input voltage and output current to
an output voltage and input current. Therefore, the h and g parameters are
called hybrid parameters.
Example 18.1 calculates the z parameters for a resistive circuit by analyzing
the circuit. Example 18.2 illustrates how a set of measurements made at the
terminals of a two-port circuit can be used to calculate the a parameters.

Solution
The circuit is purely resistive, so the s-domain circuit is also purely resistive.
There are many ways to find the two-port parameter values. Here, we note
that with port 2 open, that is, I2=0, we can apply a 1 A current source at port
1 and use circuit analysis to find V1 and V2. With those two voltages, we can
find z11 and z21. The circuit is shown in Fig. 18.4.

To find V1 for the circuit in Fig. 18.4, find the equivalent resistance seen by

Then,
V1=Zeq(1)=10 V
and
z11=V1I1|I2=0=101=10Ω.

Now use voltage division to find V2 for the circuit in Fig. 18.4, noting that
the voltage across the series combination of the 5 Ω and 15 Ω resistors is
V1=10 V:
V2=1515+5V1=7.5 V,
so
z21=V2I1|I2=0=7.51=7.5Ω.
Next we leave port 1 open, that is, I1=0, apply a 1 A current source at port 2,
and use circuit analysis to find V1 and V2. With those two voltages, we can
find z22 and z12. The circuit is shown in Fig. 18.5. To find V2 for the circuit
in Fig. 18.5, find the equivalent resistance seen by the 1 A current source:
Zeq=15ǁ(5+20)=9.375Ω.

the voltage across the series combination of the 5 Ω and 20 Ω resistors is

so
z12=V1I2|I1=0=7.51=7.5Ω.
Example 18.2 Finding the a

Parameters from Measurements
A two-port circuit is operating in the sinusoidal steady state. With port 2
open, a voltage of 150 cos 4000t V is applied to port 1. Two measurements
are made: the current into port 1 is 25 cos (4000t−45°) A, and the voltage
across port 2 is 100 cos (4000t+15°) V. Then, port 2 is short-circuited, and a
voltage of 30 cos 4000t V is applied to port 1. Two more measurements are
made: the current into port 1 is 1.5 cos (4000t+30°) A, and the current into
port 2 is 0.25 cos (4000t+ 150°) A. Find the a parameters that describe the
sinusoidal steady-state behavior of the circuit.
Solution
Phasor-transforming the first set of measurements gives
V1=150  0° V,I1=25  -45° A,V2=100 15° V,I2=0 A.
From Eqs. 18.12,

Phasor-transforming the second set of measurements gives

Therefore

Relationships Among the Two-Port
Parameters
All six sets of two-port parameter equations relate to the same variables.
Therefore, every set of two-port parameters must be related to every other set
of these parameters. In other words, if we know one set of two-port
parameters, we can derive all the other sets from the known set. The
equations used to calculate any single two-port parameter from any set of
two-port parameters are given in Table 18.1.

Table 18.1 Parameter
Conversion Table


We do not derive all the relationships listed in Table 18.1 because of the
amount of algebra involved. To illustrate the general process, we derive the
relationships between the z and y parameters and between the z and a
parameters. To find the z parameters as functions of the y parameters, begin
by solving Eqs. 18.2 for V1 and V2. We then compare the coefficients of I1
and I2 in the resulting expressions to the coefficients of I1 and I2 in Eqs.
18.1. From Eqs. 18.2,
V1=| I1y12I2y22 || y11y12y21y22 |=y22ΔyI1−y12ΔyI2,V2=| y11I1y21I2 |
Δy=−y21ΔyI1+y11ΔyI2.
Comparing these expressions for V1 and V2 with Eqs. 18.1 shows
z11=y22Δy,z12=−y12Δy,z21=−y21Δy,z22=y11Δy.
To find the z parameters as functions of the a parameters, we rearrange Eqs.
18.3 in the form of Eqs. 18.1 and then compare coefficients. From the second
equation in Eqs. 18.3,
V2=1a21I1+a22a21I2.
Therefore, substituting this expression for V2 into the first equation of Eqs.
18.3 yields
V1=a11a21I1+(a11a22a21−a12)I2.
Comparing these expressions for V1 and V2 with Eqs. 18.1 gives
z11=a11a21,z12=Δaa21.z21=1a21,z22=a22a21.
Example 18.3 illustrates the usefulness of the parameter conversion table.
Example 18.3 Finding h Parameters
from Measurements and Table 18.1

Two sets of measurements are made on a two-port resistive circuit. The first
set is made with port 2 open, and the second set is made with port 2 short-
circuited. The results are as follows:


Find the h parameters of the circuit.
Solution
We can find h11 and h21 directly from the short-circuit test:
h11=V1I1|V2=0=24×10−320×10−6=1.2 kΩ,h21=I2I1|V2=0=10−320×10−6=5
The parameters h12 and h22 cannot be obtained directly from the open-
circuit test. However, a check of Eqs. 18.7–18.15 indicates that the four a
parameters can be derived from the test data. Therefore, h12 and h22 can be
obtained through the conversion table. Specifically,
h12=Δaa22,h22=a21a22.
The a parameters are
a11=V1V2|I2=0=10×10−3−40=−0.25×10−3,a21=I1V2|I2=0=10×10−6−40=
−0.25×10−6 S,a12=−V1I2|V2=0=−24×10−310−3=−24 Ω,a22=−I1I2|V2=0=
−20×10−610−3=−20×10−3.
The numerical value of Δa is
Δa=a11a22−a12a21=5×10−6−6×10−6=−10−6.
Thus
h12=Δaa22=−10−6−20×10−3=5×10−5,h22=a21a22=
−0.25×10−6−20×10−3=12.5 μS.

Reciprocal Two-Port Circuits
A two-port circuit is reciprocal if interchanging an ideal voltage source at
one port with an ideal ammeter at the other port produces the same ammeter
reading. A two-port circuit is also reciprocal if interchanging an ideal current
source at one port with an ideal voltmeter at the other port produces the same
voltmeter reading. Relationships exist among reciprocal two-port parameters,
as shown in Table 18.2. For a reciprocal two-port circuit, only three
calculations or measurements are needed to determine a set of parameters.
Table 18.2 Two-Port
Parameter Relationships for
Reciprocal Circuits

A reciprocal two-port circuit is symmetric if its ports can be interchanged

without altering terminal current and voltage values. Figure 18.6 shows four
examples of symmetric two-port circuits. In these circuits, additional
relationships exist among the two-port parameters, as shown in Table 18.2. If
a circuit is both reciprocal and symmetric, then only two calculations or
measurements are necessary to determine all the two-port parameters.
Example 18.4 determines whether a circuit is reciprocal and symmetric.

1. Attach a 15 V source to the terminals a and d and calculate the reading
on an ammeter attached between terminals c and d. Then attach a 15 V
source to the terminals c and d and calculate the reading on an ammeter
attached between terminals a and d. Is the circuit reciprocal?
2. Find the y parameters for the circuit and determine whether or not it is
symmetric.
Solution
1. A 15 V source is attached between nodes a and d, and an ammeter is
attached between terminals c and d. The resulting circuit is shown in
Fig. 18.8. To find the ammeter current, begin by writing a KCL equation
at node b to determine the voltage between nodes b and d, Vbd.
Remember that an ideal ammeter behaves like a short circuit, so
Vbd60+Vbd−1530+Vbd20=0,
Figure 18.8 The circuit in
Fig. 18.7, with a voltage
source and an ammeter
attached.

Figure 18.8 Full Alternative Text
and Vbd=5 V. Therefore, the current I in the ammeter is the sum of the
current in the 10 Ω resistor and the current in the 20 Ω resistor:
I=520+1510=1.75 A.
Now interchange the voltage source and ammeter as shown in Fig. 18.9.
Again, we write a KCL equation at node b to determine the voltage Vbd,
remembering that the ideal ammeter behaves like a short circuit. Then,
Vbd60+Vbd30+Vbd−1520=0,
Figure 18.9 The circuit
shown in Fig. 18.7, with the
voltage source and ammeter

interchanged.
Figure 18.9 Full Alternative Text
so Vbd=7.5 V. The ammeter current I is the sum of the current in the 30 
Ω resistor and the current in the 20 Ω resistor:
I=7.530+1510=1.75 A.
Since both ammeter readings are the same, the circuit in Fig. 18.7 is
reciprocal.
2. We can use the analysis results for the circuit in Fig. 18.8 to find two of
the y parameters. Attaching the ammeter between nodes c and d is the
same as setting V2=0 in Fig. 18.7. Also, I2 in Fig. 18.7 equals −I in Fig.
18.8, and I1 in Fig. 18.7 is the sum of the currents in the 30 Ω and 20 Ω
resistors in Fig. 18.8. Therefore,
I2=−I=−1.75A,I1=15−530+1510=5530A,

so
y11=I1V1|V2=0=55/3015=1199S,y21=I2V1|V2=0=−1.7515=−760S.
We have already shown that the circuit in Fig. 18.7 is reciprocal, so
y12=y21=−7/60 S.
We can use the analysis results for the circuit in Fig. 18.9 to find y22,
because attaching the ammeter between nodes a and d is the same as
setting V1=0 in Fig. 18.7. Also, I1 in Fig. 18.7 is the sum of the currents
in the 10 Ω and 20 Ω resistors in Fig. 18.9. Therefore,
I1=15−7.520+1510=1.875 A
so
y22=I2V2|V1=0=1.87515=0.125 S.
Note that y11≠y22, so the circuit in Fig. 18.7 is not symmetric.

18.3 Analysis of the Terminated
Two-Port Circuit
A terminated two-port circuit usually has a source attached at port 1 and a
load attached at port 2, as shown in the s-domain circuit of Fig. 18.10. In this
circuit, Zg is the internal source impedance, Vg the internal source voltage,
and ZL is the load impedance. To analyze this circuit, we find the terminal
currents and voltages as functions of the two-port parameters, Vg, Zg, and
ZL.
Figure 18.10 A terminated two-
port model.
Figure 18.10 Full Alternative Text
Six characteristics of the terminated two-port circuit define its terminal

behavior:
the input impedance Zin=V1/I1, or the admittance Yin=I1/V1;
the output current I2;
the Thévenin voltage and impedance (VTh, ZTh) with respect to port 2;
the current gain I2/I1;
the voltage gain V2/V1;
the voltage gain V2/Vg.
The Six Characteristics in Terms of
the z Parameters
To illustrate how these six characteristics are derived, we find their
expressions using the z parameters of the two-port portion of the circuit.
Table 18.3 summarizes the expressions involving the y, a, b, h, and g
parameters.
Table 18.3 Terminated Two-
Port Equations


We find the expression for each characteristic using one set of two-port
equations, along with the two constraint equations imposed by the source
applied at port 1 and the load applied at port 2. Using the z parameters, the
circuit in Fig. 18.10 is described by the following four equations:
V1=z11I1+z12I2, (18.16)
V2=z21I1+z22I2, (18.17)
V1=Vg−I1Zg, (18.18)
V2=−I2ZL. (18.19)
Let’s find the impedance seen looking into port 1, that is, Zin=V1/I1. In Eq.
18.17, replace V2 with −I2ZL and solve the resulting expression for I2:
I2=−z21I1ZL+z22. (18.20)
Then substitute this equation into Eq. 18.16 and solve for Zin:
Zin=z11−z12z21z22+ZL.
To find the output current I2, we first solve Eq. 18.16 for I1 after replacing
V1 with the right-hand side of Eq. 18.18. The result is
I1=Vg−z12I2z11+Zg. (18.21)
We now substitute Eq. 18.21 into Eq. 18.20 and solve the resulting equation
for I2:
I2=−z21Vg(z11+Zg)(z22+ZL)−z12z21.
The Thévenin voltage with respect to port 2 equals V2 when I2=0. With
I2=0, Eq. 18.17 reduces to
V2|I2=0=z21I1. (18.22)
But when I2=0, Eq. 18.21 becomes I1=Vg/(z11+Zg). Substituting this
expression for I1 into Eq. 18.22 yields the open-circuit value of V2:
V2|I2=0=VTh=z21Zg+z11Vg.

The Thévenin, or output, impedance is the ratio V2/I2 when Vg is replaced
by a short circuit. When Vg is zero, Eq. 18.18 reduces to
V1=−I1Zg. (18.23)
Substituting Eq. 18.23 into Eq. 18.16 and solving for I1 gives
I1=−z12I2z11+Zg.
Now use this expression to replace I1 in Eq. 18.17, resulting in
V2I2|Vg=0=ZTh=z22−z12z21z11+Zg.
The current gain I2/I1 comes directly from Eq. 18.20:
I2I1=−z21ZL+z22.
To derive the expression for the voltage gain V2/V1, we start by replacing I2
in Eq. 18.17 with its value from Eq. 18.19; thus
V2=z21I1+z22(−V2ZL). (18.24)
Next, solve Eq. 18.16 for I1 as a function of V1 and V2:
z11I1=V1−z12(−V2ZL)
or
I1=V1z11+z12V2z11ZL. (18.25)
Finally, replace I1 in Eq. 18.24 with Eq. 18.25 and solve the resulting
expression for V2/V1:
V2V1=z21ZLz11ZL+z11z22−z12z21=z21ZLz11ZL+Δz.
To derive the voltage ratio V2/Vg, we first combine Eqs. 18.16, 18.18, and
18.19 to find I1 as a function of V2 and Vg:
I1=z12V2ZL(z11+Zg)+Vgz11+Zg. (18.26)

Then, starting with Eq. 18.17, use Eq. 18.26 to substitute for I1 and Eq. 18.19
to substitute for I2. The result is an expression involving only V2 and Vg:
V2=z21z12V2ZL(z11+Zg)+z21Vgz11+Zg−z22ZLV2,
which we can rearrange to get the desired voltage ratio:
V2Vg=z21ZL(z11+Zg)(z22+ZL)−z12z21.

Example 18.5.

Figure 18.11 Full Alternative Text
Solution
1. To find V2, we have two choices from the entries in Table 18.3. We
could find I2 and then find V2 from the relationship V2=−I2ZL, or we
could find the voltage gain V2/Vg and calculate V2 from the gain. Let’s
use the latter approach. For the b-parameter values given, we have
Δb=b11b22−b12b21=(−20)(−0.2)−(−3000)(−0.002)=−2.
From Table 18.3,
V2Vg=ΔbZLb12+b11Zg+b22ZL+b21ZgZL=(−2)(5000)−3000+
(−20)500+(−0.2)5000+[ −0.002(500)(5000) ]=1019.
Then,
V2=(1019)500=263.160° V.
2. The average power delivered to the 5000Ω load is

P2=|V2|22(5000)=263.1622(5000)=6.93 W.
3. To find the average power delivered to the input port, we first find the
input impedance Zin. From Table 18.3,
Zin=b22ZL+b12b21ZL+b11=(−0.2)
(5000)−3000−2×10−3(5000)−20=4003=133.33 Ω.
Now I1 follows directly:
I1=VgZg+Zin=500500+133.33=789.47 mA.
The average power delivered to the input port is
P1=|I1|2Zin2=(0.78947)2(133.33)2=41.55 W.
4. The load impedance for maximum power transfer equals the conjugate
of the Thévenin impedance seen looking into port 2. From Table 18.3,
ZTh=b11Zg+b12b21Zg+b22=(−20)(500)−3000(−2×10−3)
(500)−0.2=13,0001.2=10,833.33 Ω.
Therefore ZL=ZTh*=10,833.33Ω.
5. To find the maximum average power delivered to ZL, we first find V2
from the voltage-gain expression V2/Vg. When ZL is 10,833.33Ω, this
gain is
V2Vg=ΔbZLb12+b11Zg+b22ZL+b21ZgZL=(−2)(10,833.33)(−3000)+
(−20)(500)+(−0.2)(10,833.33)+(−0.002)(500)(10,833.33)=0.8333.
Thus
V2=(0.8333)(500)=416.67 V,
and
PL(maximum)=12416.67210,833.33=8.01 W.

18.4 Interconnected Two-Port
Circuits
Synthesizing a large, complex system is usually made easier by first
designing subsections of the system and then interconnecting the subsections.
If the subsections are modeled by two-port circuits, we will need to analyze
interconnected two-port circuits to complete the system design.
Two-port subsystem circuits can be interconnected in five ways: (1) in
cascade, (2) in series, (3) in parallel, (4) in series-parallel, and (5) in parallel-
series. Figure 18.12 depicts these five basic interconnections.

Figure 18.12 Full Alternative Text
We analyze and illustrate only the cascade connection in this section. The
cascade connection is important because it occurs frequently in the modeling
of large systems. The a parameters are best suited for describing the cascade
connection. We analyze the cascade connection using the circuit shown in
Fig. 18.13, where a single prime denotes a parameters in the first circuit and a
double prime denotes a parameters in the second circuit. The output voltage
and current of the first circuit are labeled V′2 and I′2, and the input voltage
and current of the second circuit are labeled V′1 and I′1. The problem is to
derive the a-parameter equations that relate V2 and I2 to V1 and I1. In other
words, we want to construct the equations
V1=a11V2−a12I2,I1=a21V2−a22I2, (18.27)
Figure 18.13 A cascade
connection.
Figure 18.13 Full Alternative Text

where the a parameters are given explicitly in terms of the a parameters of the
individual circuits.
We begin the derivation by noting from Fig. 18.13 that
V1=a′11V′2−a′12I′2,I1=a′21V′2−a′22I′2. (18.28)
The interconnection means that V′2=V′1 and I′2=−I′1. Substituting these
constraints into Eqs. 18.28 yields
V1=a′11V′1+a′12I′1, (18.29)
I1=a′21V′1+a′22I′1.
The voltage V′1 and the current I′1 are related to V2 and I2 through the a
parameters of the second circuit:
V′1=a″11V2−a″12I2, (18.30)
I′1=a″21V2−a″22I2.
We substitute Eqs. 18.30 into Eqs. 18.29 to generate the relationships
between V1, I1 and V2, I2:
V1=(a′11a″11+a′12a″21)V2−(a′11a″12+a′12a″22)I2,I1=(a′21a″11+a′22a
″21)V2−(a′21a″12+a′22a″22)I2.
By comparing these expressions for V1 and I1 to Eqs. 18.27, we get the
desired expressions for the a parameters of the interconnected networks,
namely,
a11=a′11a″11+a′12a″21, (18.31)
a12=a′11a″12+a′12a″22, (18.32)
a21=a′21a″11+a′22a″21, (18.33)
a22=a′21a″12+a′22a″22. (18.34)
If more than two units are connected in cascade, the a parameters of the
equivalent two-port circuit can be found by successively reducing the original
set of two-port circuits one pair at a time.
Example 18.6 illustrates how to use Eqs. 18.31–18.34 to analyze a cascade

connection with two amplifier circuits.
Example 18.6 Analyzing Cascaded
Two-Port Circuits
Two identical amplifiers are connected in cascade, as shown in Fig. 18.14.
Each amplifier is described using its h parameters. The values are
h11=1000Ω, h12=0.0015, h21=100, and h22=100 μS. Find the voltage gain
V2/Vg.

Example 18.6.
Figure 18.14 Full Alternative Text
Solution

The first step in finding V2/Vg is to convert from h parameters to a
parameters. The amplifiers are identical, so one set of a parameters describes
the amplifiers:
a′11=−Δhh21=+0.05100=5×10−4,a′12=−h11h21=−1000100=−10 Ω,a′21=
−h22h21=−100×10−6100=−10−6 S,a′22=−1h21=−1100=−10−2.
Next we use Eqs. 18.31–18.34 to compute the a parameters of the cascaded
amplifiers:
a11=a′11a′11+ a′12a′21=25×10−8+(−10)(−10−6)=10.25×10−6,
a12=a′11a′12+a′12a′22=(5×10−4)(−10)+(−10)(−10−2)=0.095 Ω,
a21=a′21a′11+ a′22a′21=(−10−6)(5×10−4)+(−0.01)(−10−6)=9.5×10−9 S,
a22=a′21a′12+a′22a′22=(−10−6)(−10)+(−10−2)2=1.1×10−4.
From Table 18.3,
                         V2Vg=ZL(a11+a21Zg)ZL+a12+a22Zg=104[
10.25×10−6+9.5×10−9(500)
]104+0.095+1.1×10−4(500)                                   =1040.15+0.095+0.055                  
Thus, an input signal of 150 μV is amplified to an output signal of 5 V.

Practical Perspective

Characterizing an Unknown Circuit
We make the following measurements to find the h parameters for our “black
box” amplifier:
With Port 1 open, apply 50 V at Port 2. Measure the voltage at Port 1
and the current at Port 2:
V1=50 mV; I2=2.5 A.
With Port 2 short-circuited, apply 2.5 mA at Port 1. Measure the voltage
at Port 1 and the current at Port 2:
V1=1.25 V; I2=3.75 A.
Calculate the h parameters according to Eqs. 18.14:
h11=V1I1|V2=0=1.250.0025=500  
Ω;h12=V1V2|I1=0=0.0550=10−3;h21=I2I1|V2=0=3.750.0025=1500;h22=I2V
Now we use the terminated two-port equations to determine whether or not it
is safe to attach a 2 V(rms) source with a 100 Ω internal impedance to Port 1
and use this source together with the amplifier to drive a speaker modeled as
a 32 Ω resistance with a power rating of 100 W. Begin by finding the value of
I2 from Table 18.3:
I2=h21Vg(1+h22ZL)(h11+Zg)−h12h21ZL=1500(2)[ 1+(0.05)(32) ][
500+100 ]−(1500)(10−3)(32)=1.98 A  (rms).
Then, calculate the power delivered to the 32 Ω speaker:
P=RI22=(32)(1.98)2=126 W.
The amplifier would thus deliver 126 W to the speaker, which is rated at 100
W, so it would be better to use a different amplifier or buy a more powerful
speaker.

Summary
The two-port model is used to describe the performance of a circuit in
terms of the voltage and current at its input and output ports. (See page
694.)
The model is limited to circuits in which
no independent sources are inside the circuit between the ports;
no energy is stored inside the circuit between the ports;
the current into the port is equal to the current out of the port; and
no external connections exist between the input and output ports.
(See page 692.)
Two of the four terminal variables (V1, I1, V2, I2) are independent;
therefore, only two simultaneous equations involving the four variables
are needed to describe the circuit. (See page 694.)
The six possible sets of simultaneous equations involving the four
terminal variables are called the z-, y-, a-, b-, h-, and g-parameter
equations. See Eqs. 18.1–18.6. (See page 694.)
The equations are written in the s domain. The dc values of the
parameters are obtained by setting s=0, and the sinusoidal steady-state
values are obtained by setting s=jω. (See page 694.)
Any set of two-port parameters can be calculated or measured by
invoking appropriate short-circuit and open-circuit conditions at the
input and output ports. See Eqs. 18.7–18.15. (See pages 695 and 696.)
The relationships among the six sets of two-port parameters are given in
Table 18.1. (See page 699.)

A two-port circuit is reciprocal if interchanging an ideal voltage source
at one port with an ideal ammeter at the other port produces the same
ammeter reading. The effect of reciprocity on the two-port parameters is
given in Table 18.2. (See page 701.)
A reciprocal two-port circuit is symmetric if its ports can be
interchanged without disturbing the values of the terminal currents and
voltages. The added effect of symmetry on the two-port parameters is
given in Table 18.2. (See page 701.)
The performance of a two-port circuit connected to a Thévenin
equivalent source and a load is summarized by the relationships given in
Table 18.3. (See page 704.)
Large networks can be divided into subnetworks by means of
interconnected two-port models. The cascade connection was used in
this chapter to illustrate the analysis of interconnected two-port circuits.

Appendix A The Solution of Linear
Simultaneous Equations
Circuit analysis frequently requires us to solve a set of linear simultaneous
equations. We present several different solution methods here—some that
employ engineering calculators or personal computers, and others that require
just a pencil and paper. Most of the methods begin by placing the system of
equations in matrix form. You should review matrices and matrix arithmetic,
topics found in most intermediate-level algebra texts.

A.1 Preliminary Steps
To solve a set of simultaneous equations, we begin by organizing the
equations into a standard form. To do this, collect all terms containing an
unknown variable on the left-hand side of each equation and place all
constants on the right-hand side. Then, arrange the equations in a vertical
stack such that each variable occupies the same horizontal position in every
equation. For example, in Eqs. A.1, the variables i1, i2, and i3 occupy the
first, second, and third position, respectively, on the left-hand side of each
equation:
21i1−  9i2−12i3= −33,−3i1 + 6i2−  2i3 =3,−8i1−4i2+22i3=50. (A.1)
Once the equations are in this standard form, you can write the equations
using matrix notation as
[21−9−12 −36−2 −8−422][i1i2i3]=[ −33350].
We can abbreviate the set of equations in matrix form as AX=B, where A is
the matrix of coefficients that multiply the variables, X is the vector of the
variables, and B is the vector of constants from the right-hand side of the
equations. When written in this abbreviated form, we can solve for the vector
of unknowns by finding the inverse of the A matrix and multiplying it by the
B vector:
X=A −1B.
If any equation is missing one or more variables, the missing variables can be
inserted by making their coefficients zero. Thus, Eqs. A.2 are written in
standard form as shown by Eqs. A.3:
2υ1−υ2=4,4υ2+3υ3=16,7υ1+2υ3=5; (A.2)
2υ1−  υ2+0υ3=4,0υ1+4υ2+3υ3=16,7υ1+0υ2+2υ3=5.
Equation A.3 is written using matrix form as

[3−10043702][υ1υ2υ3]=[4165].

A.2 Calculator and Computer
Methods
Most calculators recommended for engineering students can solve a set of
simultaneous algebraic equations. Because there are many different
calculators, it is impractical to provide directions or an example here. Instead,
we provide the general steps for using your calculator to solve equations; you
should refer to the manual for your specific calculator or search for
instructions on the web.
1. Input the problem dimension by specifying the number of unknowns.
2. Create the A matrix, which is the matrix of coefficients that multiply the
unknowns on the left-hand sides of the equations.
3. Create the B array, which is the array of constants on the right-hand
sides of the equations.
4. Use the “solve” function (which has different names for different
calculators) for the matrix A and the array B, to calculate the array X
that contains the values of the unknowns.
Most calculators can solve simultaneous equations that have real number
coefficients and complex number coefficients. Some can even solve
simultaneous equations whose coefficients include symbols.
There are many different computer programs that can solve a set of algebraic
equations. We present two examples: Excel, the spreadsheet application, and
MATLAB, the matrix-based programming language. You should explore the
options available and pick the software that works best for you.
Using Excel

Figure A.1 uses Excel to solve the simultaneous equations given in Eqs. A.1.
Note that Excel can only solve simultaneous equations whose coefficients are
real numbers. To begin, enter the A matrix in a square collection of cells and
enter the B vector in a column of cells. You can label the matrix and vector,
as shown in the figure, but this is not required. Then highlight a column of
cells for the vector X, which will contain the values of the unknowns. The
number of cells in this column must equal the number of unknowns. Type the
following function in the function box:
= MMULT(MINVERSE(start_cell, end_cell),b1:bn)
Figure A.1 Using Excel to solve
the simultaneous equations in
Eqs. A.1.

Figure A.1 Full Alternative Text
and simultaneously press the Ctrl-Shift-Enter keys. This will enter the values
for the X vector into the highlighted cells and also will surround the function
with braces, as shown in Fig. A.1. The function MINVERSE(start_cell,
end_cell) calculates the inverse of a matrix. The matrix values occupy square
collection of cells whose upper left cell is start_cell and whose lower right
cell is end_cell. The MMULT(R, S) multiplies two matrices, R and S,
supplied as arguments.
Using MATLAB
There are several ways to solve a system of simultaneous equations using
MATLAB. Figure A.2 illustrates one method to solve Eqs. A.1. It begins by
defining the three unknown variables and the three simultaneous equations.
Then, the function equationsToMatrix(eq, var) constructs the A matrix and
the B vector from the equations supplied in the function’s first argument,
using the variables specified in the function’s second argument. Finally, the
function linsolve(A, B) calculates the values of the unknowns by inverting
the matrix supplied in the function’s first argument and then multiplying by
the vector supplied in the function’s second argument. Note that, unlike
Excel, the simultaneous equations specified in MatLab can have complex
numbers as coefficients on the left-hand side and constants on the right-hand
side.

equations in Eqs. Eqs. A.1.

A.3 Paper-and-Pencil Methods
We present two methods that do not require an engineering calculator or
computer software: back-substitution and Cramer’s method. Both methods
are easy to use when solving two or three simultaneous equations. If you
have four or more simultaneous equations, you should solve them with your
calculator or computer because the paper-and-pencil methods are quite
complicated. Both back-substitution and Cramer’s method work for equations
with real numbers, with complex numbers, or even with symbols as
coefficients and constants.
Back-Substitution
The back-substitution method picks one equation and solves it for one
unknown in terms of the remaining unknowns. The solution is used to
eliminate that unknown in the remaining equations. This process is repeated
until only one equation and one unknown remain. To illustrate, we will solve
Eqs. A.2 using back-substitution. Begin by solving the third equation for υ3,
to get
υ3=2.5−3.5υ1.
Now eliminate υ3 in the remaining equations:
2υ1−υ2=4,
4υ2+3(2.5−3.5υ1)=16.
Next, solve the first of the two remaining equations for υ2, to get
υ2=2υ1−4.
Eliminate υ2 in the other equation:
4(2υ1−4)+3(2.5−3.5υ1)=16.

Simplify and solve for υ1:
−2.5υ1=24.5 so υ1=24.5 −2.5= −9.8 V.
Finally, use this value for υ1 to find the remaining unknowns:
υ2=2υ1−4=2(−9.8)−4= −23.6 V, υ3=2.5−3.5υ1=2.5−3.5(−9.8)=36.8 V.
There is another way to solve a set of simultaneous equations with the back-
substitution method. Begin by picking any two equations, and multiply one or
both equations by a different constant such that when the resulting equations
are added together, one of the unknowns is eliminated. For example, consider
the first two equations in Eqs. A.3. If we multiply the first equation by the
constant 4 and add the resulting equation to the second equation, we
eliminate υ2:
8υ1−4υ2+0υ3=16+0υ1+4υ2+3υ3=16_8υ1+0υ2+3υ3=32.
Now multiply this new equation by 2, and multiply the third equation in Eqs.
A.3 by −3. Then add the two equations together to eliminate υ3:
16υ1+6υ3=64+−21υ1+−6υ3= −15_ −5υ1+0υ3= 49.
Therefore,
υ1=49 −5= −9.8 V.
We can substitute the value of υ1 back into the first equation in Eqs. A.3 to
find υ2 and then substitute the value of υ2 back into the second equation in
Eqs. A.3 to find υ3. You should complete these final steps to verify the
values.
Cramer’s Method
We can also use Cramer’s method to solve a set of simultaneous equations.
The value of each unknown variable is the ratio of two determinants. If we let
N, with an appropriate subscript, represent the numerator determinant and Δ

represent the denominator determinant, then the kth unknown xk is
xk=NkΔ. (A.4)
The denominator determinant Δ is the same for every unknown variable and
is called the characteristic determinant of the set of equations. The
numerator determinant Nk varies with each unknown.
The characteristic determinant is the determinant of the A matrix. For
example, the characteristic determinant of Eqs. A.3 is
Δ=[2−10043702].
To find the determinant, rewrite the first two columns to the right of the
determinant to get
Δ=[2−10043702] 2−10470
.
There are now five columns. Sum the products of the left-to-right diagonals
for the first three columns; then subtract the sum of products of the right-to-
left diagonals for the last three columns:
Δ=(2⋅4⋅2)+(−1⋅3⋅7)+
(0⋅0⋅0)−(0⋅4⋅7)−(2⋅3⋅0)−(−1⋅0⋅2)=16−21+0−0−0−0= −5.
Note that this shortcut method for finding a determinant works only for
square matrices of dimension 3. To find the determinant for a matrix whose
dimension is larger than 3, consult a reference on determinants.
To construct the numerator determinant Nk, replace the kth column in the
characteristic determinant with the values in the B vector. For example, the
numerator determinants for evaluating υ1, υ2, and υ3 in Eqs. A.3 are
N1=[ 4−101643502 ]=(4⋅4⋅2)+(−1⋅3⋅5)+
(0⋅16⋅0)−(0⋅4⋅5)−(4⋅3⋅0)−(−1⋅16⋅2)=49,
N2=[2400163752]=(2⋅16⋅2)+(4⋅3⋅7)+
(0⋅0⋅5)−(0⋅16⋅7)−(2⋅3⋅5)−(4⋅0⋅2)=118,

and
N3=[2−140416705]=(2⋅4⋅5)+(−1⋅16⋅7)+
(4⋅0⋅0)−(4⋅4⋅7)−(2⋅16⋅0)−(−1⋅0⋅5)= −184.
Using Cramer’s method in Eq. A.4, we can solve for υ1, υ2, and υ3:
υ1=N1Δ=49 −5= −9.8 V,υ2=N2Δ=118 −5= −23.6 V,
and
υ3=N3Δ= −184 −5=36.8 V.

A.4 Applications
The following examples demonstrate the various techniques for solving a
system of simultaneous equations generated from circuit analysis.
Example A.1
Use Cramer’s method to solve for the node voltages υ1 and υ2 in Eqs. 4.1
and 4.2.
Solution
The first step is to rewrite Eqs. 4.1 and 4.2 in standard form. Collecting the
coefficients of υ1 and υ2 on the left-hand side and moving the constant terms
to the right-hand side of the equations gives us
1.7υ1−0.5υ2=10,−0.5υ1+0.6υ2=   2.
Rewriting this set of equations in AX=B format gives us
[1.7−0.5 −0.50.6][υ1υ2]=[102].
Using Cramer’s method (Eq. A.4), we can write expressions for the unknown
voltages:
υ1=|10−0.520.6||1.7−0.5 −0.50.6|,
υ2=|1.710 −0.52||1.7−0.5 −0.50.6|.
The shortcut for calculating the determinant for a matrix of dimension 3 does
not work for matrices of dimension 2. Instead, there is a different shortcut for
these matrices. Starting at the top of the first column, find the product along
the left-to-right diagonal. Then subtract the product along the right-to-left
diagonal that starts at the top of the second column. Thus,

υ 1 = | 10 −0.5 2 0.6 | | 1.7 −0.5  −0.5 0.6 | = ( 10 )( 0.6 )−( −0.5 )( 2 ) ( 1.7 )(
0.6 )−( −0.5 )( −0.5 ) = 6+1 1.02−0.25 =9.09  V, υ 2 = | 1.7 10 −0.5 2 | | 1.7
−0.5 −0.5 0.6 | = ( 1.7 )( 2 )−( 10 )( −0.5 ) ( 1.7 )( 0.6 )−( −0.5 )( −0.5 ) =
3.4+5 1.02−0.25 =10.91 V.
Example A.2
Use Excel to find the three mesh currents in the circuit in Fig. 4.24.
Solution
The equations that describe the circuit in Fig. 4.24 were derived in Example
4.7. There are three KVL equations:
5(i1−i2)+20(i1−i3)−50=0,5(i2−i1)+1i2+4(i2−i3)=0,20(i3−i1)+4(i3−i2)+15io=
There is also a dependent source constraint equation:
io=i1−i3.
Putting these four equations in standard form, we get
25i1−5i2−20i3+0io=50, −5i1+10i2−4i3+0io=0, 
−20i1−4i2+24i3+15io=0,i1−0i2−i3−io=0.
Rewriting this set of equations in AX=B format gives us
[25−5−200 −510−40 −20−4241510−1−1][i1i2i3io]=[50000].
The Excel solution is shown in Fig. A.3. The mesh currents are i1=29.6 A,
i2=26 A, and i3=28 A, and the controlling current for the dependent source is
io=1.6 A.

Solution

Summing the voltages around mesh 1 generates the equation

Summing the voltages around mesh 2 produces the equation
(12−j16)(I2−I1)+(1+j3)I2+39Ix=0.
The current controlling the dependent voltage source is
Ix=(I1−I2).
Converting these three equations into standard form, we get
(13+j14)I1+(−12+j16)I2+0Ix=150,(−12+j16)I1+
(13+j13)I2+39Ix=0,I1−I2−Ix=0.

Let G=1/R and collect the coefficients of V1 and V2 to get
(G+2sC)V1−sCV2 =GVg,−sCV1+(G+2sC)V2 =sCVg.
Solve the first equation for V2 to get
V2=(G+2sC)sC V1−GsC Vg.

Substitute this expression into the second equation to eliminate V2:
−sCV1+(G+2sC)[(G+2sC)sC V1−GsC Vg]=sCVg.
Rearrange and simplify this equation to find the expression for V1:
(G+2sC)2−(sC)2sC V1=G(G+2sC)+(sC)2sC Vg,

V 1 = G( G+2sC )+ ( sC ) 2 ( G+2sC ) 2 − ( sC ) 2   V g = ( G 2 +2sCG+ s 2
C 2 ) ( G 2 +4sCG+3 s 2 C 2 )   V g .
Finally, substitute this expression for V1 into the equation for V2; rearrange
and simplify to find the expression for V2:
V2=(G+2sC)sC [(G2+2sCG+s2C2)(G2+4sCG+3s2C2) Vg]−GsC Vg,

Appendix B Complex Numbers
Complex numbers allow us to find the square root of negative numbers. For
example, consider the equation x2+8x+41=0. From the quadratic formula, we
know that the two values of x that satisfy this equation are
x1,2=−8±82−4(41)2=−4±−25.
Therefore, this equation has no solution in a number system that excludes
complex numbers. Complex numbers, and the ability to manipulate them
algebraically, are extremely useful in circuit analysis.

B.1 Notation
There are two ways to designate a complex number: with the cartesian, or
rectangular, form or with the polar, or trigonometric, form. In rectangular
form, a complex number is written as a sum of a real component and an
imaginary component; hence
n=a+jb,
where a is the real component, b is the imaginary component, and j is, by
definition, −1.1
1You may be more familiar with the notation i=−1. In electrical engineering,
i is used as the symbol for current, and hence in electrical engineering
literature, j is used to denote −1.
In polar form, a complex number is written in terms of its magnitude (or
modulus) and angle (or argument); hence
n=cejθ
where c is the magnitude, θ is the angle, e is the base of the natural logarithm,
and, as before, j=−1. The symbol θ° is frequently used in place of ejθ, so the
polar form can also be written as
n=c  θ° .
When we write a complex number in polar form, we typically use the angle
notation. But when we perform mathematical operations using complex
numbers in polar form, we use the exponential notation because the rules for
manipulating an exponential quantity are well known. For example, because
(yx)n=yxn, then (ejθ)n=ejnθ; because y−x=1/yx, then e−jθ=1/ejθ; and so
forth.
Since there are two ways of expressing the same complex number, we need
to relate one form to the other. The transition from polar to rectangular form

makes use of Euler’s identity:
e±jθ=cos θ ± j sin θ.
A complex number in polar form can be put in rectangular form by writing
cejθ=c(cos θ + jc sin θ)=c(cos θ + jc sin θ)=a + jb.
The transition from rectangular to polar form uses right triangle ​geometry,
namely,
a + jb=(a2+b2)ejθ=cejθ,
where
tan θ=b/a.
The expression for tan θ does not specify the quadrant where the angle θ is
located. We can determine the location of θ using a graphical representation
of the complex number.

B.2 The Graphical Representation
of a Complex Number
A complex number is represented graphically on a complex-number plane,
where the horizontal axis represents the real component and the vertical axis
represents the imaginary component. The angle of the complex number is
measured counterclockwise from the positive real axis. The plot of the
complex number n=a + jb=c  θ° , assuming that a and b are both positive, is
shown in Fig. B.1.
Figure B.1 The graphical
representation of a + jb when a
and b are both positive.

Figure B.1 Full Alternative Text
This plot makes very clear the relationship between the rectangular and polar
forms. Any point in the complex-number plane is uniquely defined by giving
either its distance from each axis (that is, a and b) or its radial distance from
the origin (c) and the angle with respect to the positive real axis, θ.
It follows from Fig. B.1 that θ is in the first quadrant when a and b are both
positive, in the second quadrant when a is negative and b is positive, in the
third quadrant when a and b are both negative, and in the fourth quadrant
when a is positive and b is negative. These observations are illustrated in Fig.
B.2, where we have plotted 4+j3, −4+j3, −4−j3, and 4−j3.
Note that we can also specify θ as a clockwise angle from the positive real
axis. Thus, in Fig. B.2(c), we could also designate −4−j3 as 5  −143.13° . In
Fig. B.2(d), we observe that 5   323.13° =5   −36.87° . It is customary to
express θ in terms of negative values when θ lies in the third or fourth
quadrant, so that −180∘≤θ≤180∘.
The conjugate of a complex number is formed by reversing the sign of its
imaginary component. Thus, the conjugate of a+jb is a−jb, and the conjugate
of −a+jb is −a−jb. When we write a complex number in polar form, we
construct its conjugate by reversing the sign of the angle θ. Therefore, the
conjugate of c θ° is c −θ° . The conjugate of a complex number is designated
with an asterisk, so n* is understood to be the conjugate of n. Figure B.3
shows two complex numbers and their conjugates plotted on the complex-
number plane. Note that conjugation reflects a complex number about the real
axis.

B.3 Arithmetic Operations
Addition (Subtraction)
When adding or subtracting complex numbers, we express the numbers in
rectangular form. Addition involves adding the real parts of the complex
numbers to form the real part of the sum and adding the imaginary parts to
form the imaginary part of the sum. Thus, if we are given
n1=8+j16
and
n2=12−j3,
then
n1+n2=(8+12)+j(16−3)=20+j13.
Subtraction follows the same rule. Thus
n2−n1=(12−8)+j(−3−16)=4−j19.
If the numbers to be added or subtracted are given in polar form, they are first
converted to rectangular form. For example, if
n 1 =10   53.13°
and
n 2 =5   −135° ,
then
n1 + n2=6+j8−3.535−j3.535=

(6−3.535)+j(8−3.535)=2.465 + j4.465=5.10  61.10°,
and
n1−n2=6+j8−(−3.535−j3.535)=9.535+j11.535=14.966  50.42°.
Multiplication (Division)
When multiplying or dividing complex numbers, the numbers can be written
in either rectangular or polar form. In most cases, polar form is more
convenient. As an example, let’s find the product n1n2 when n1=8+j10 and
n2=5−j4. Using rectangular form, we have
n1n2=(8+j10)(5−j4)=40−j32+j50+40=80+j18=82 12.68°.
If we use polar form, we find the product of two complex numbers by
multiplying their magnitudes and adding their angles. For example,
n1n2=(12.81 51.34°)(6.40−38.66° )=82 12.68°=80+j18.
The first step in dividing two complex numbers in rectangular form is to
multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator.
This makes the denominator a real number. We then divide the real number
into the new numerator. As an example, let’s calculate n1/n2, where n1=6+j3
and n2=3−j1. We have
n 1 n 2 = 6+j3 3−j1 = ( 6+j3 )( 3+j1 ) ( 3−j1 )( 3+j1 ) = 18+j6+j9−3 9+1 =
15+j15 10 =1.5+j1.5 = 2.12   45° .
In polar form, we calculate n1/n2 by dividing the magnitudes and subtracting
the angles. For example,
n1n2=6.71 26.57°3.16 −18.43°=2.12 45°=1.5+j1.5.

B.4 Useful Identities
In working with complex numbers and quantities, the following identities are
very useful:
± j2=±1,(−j)(j)=1,j=1−j,e±jπ=−1,e±jπ/2=±j.
Given that n=a + jb=c  θ° , it follows that
n n * = a 2 + b 2 = c 2 , n +  n * = 2a, n −  n * = j2b, n/ n * = 1  2θ° .

B.5 The Integer Power of a Complex
Number
To raise a complex number to an integer power k, begin by expressing the
complex number in polar form. Then, to find the kth power of a complex
number, raise its magnitude to the kth power and multiply its angle by k.
Thus
n k = ( a+jb ) k = (c e jθ ) k = c k e jkθ = c k ( cos kθ + j sinkθ ).
For example,
(2 e j12° ) 5 = 2 5 e j60° =32 e j60° = 16+j27.71,
and
( 3+j4 ) 4 = (5 e j53.13° ) 4 = 5 4 e j212.52° = 625 e j212.52° = −527−j336.

B.6 The Roots of a Complex
Number
To find the kth root of a complex number, we solve the equation
xk − cejθ=0,
which is an equation of the kth degree and therefore has k roots.
To find the k roots (x1, x2, …, xk), we first note that
cejθ=cej(θ + 2π)=cej(θ + 4π)=⋯.
It follows that
x 1 = (c e jθ ) 1/k = c 1/k e jθ/k , x 2 = [c e j( θ+2π ) ] 1/k = c 1/k e j( θ+2π )/k
, x 3 = [c e j( θ+4π ) ] 1/k = c 1/k e j( θ+4π )/k ,
⋮⋅
We continue this process until the roots start repeating. This will happen
when the multiple of π is equal to 2k. For example, let’s find the four roots of
81ej60°. We have
x 1 = 81 1/4 e j60/4 =3 e j15° , x 2 = 81 1/4 e j(60 + 360)/4 =3 e j105° , x 3 =
81 1/4 e j(60 + 720)/4 =3 e j195° , x 4 = 81 1/4 e j(60 + 1080)/4 =3 e j285° , x
5 = 81 1/4 e j(60 + 1440)/4 =3 e j375° =3 e j15° .
Here, x5 is the same as x1, so the roots have started to repeat. Therefore, we
know the four roots of 81ej60° are the values given by x1, x2, x3, and x4.
Note that the roots of a complex number lie on a circle in the ​complex-
number plane. The radius of the circle is c1/k. The roots are uniformly
distributed around the circle, and the angle between adjacent roots is 2π/k
radians or 360/k degrees. The four roots of 81ej60° are plotted in Fig. B.4.

Appendix C More on Magnetically
Coupled Coils and Ideal
Transformers
C.1 Equivalent Circuits for
Magnetically Coupled Coils
It is sometimes convenient to model magnetically coupled coils with an
equivalent circuit that does not include magnetic coupling. Consider the two
magnetically coupled coils shown in Fig. C.1. The resistances R1 and R2
represent the winding resistance of each coil. The goal is to replace the
magnetically coupled coils inside the shaded area with a set of inductors that
are not magnetically coupled. Before deriving the equivalent circuits, we
must point out an important restriction: The voltage between terminals b and
d must be zero. In other words, we must be able to short together terminals b
and d without disturbing the voltages and currents in the original circuit. This
restriction is imposed because, while the equivalent circuits we develop have
four terminals, two of those four terminals are shorted together. Thus, the
same requirement is placed on the original circuits.
Figure C.1 The circuit used to
develop an equivalent circuit
for magnetically coupled coils.

Figure C.1 Full Alternative Text
We begin by writing the two equations that relate the terminal voltages v1
and v2 to the terminal currents i1 and i2. For the given references and
polarity dots,
v1=L1di1dt + Mdi2dt(C.1)
and
v2=Mdi1dt + L2di2dt.(C.2)
The T-Equivalent Circuit
How can we arrange uncoupled inductors in a circuit that can be described by
Eqs. C.1 and C.2? If we regard Eqs. C.1 and C.2 as mesh-current equations
with i1 and i2 as the mesh currents, we need one mesh with a total inductance
of L1 and a second mesh with a total inductance of L2. Also, the two meshes
must have a common inductance of M. The T-equivalent circuit shown in
Fig. C.2 satisfies these requirements.

Figure C.2 The T-equivalent
circuit for the magnetically
coupled coils of Fig. C.2.
Figure C.2 Full Alternative Text
You should verify that the equations relating v1 and v2 to i1 and i2 reduce to
Eqs. C.1 and C.2. Note the absence of magnetic coupling between the
inductors and the zero voltage between b and d.
The π-Equivalent Circuit
We can derive a π-equivalent circuit for the magnetically coupled coils
shown in Fig. C.1 by solving Eqs. C.1 and C.2 for the derivatives di1/dt and
di2/dt. We treat the resulting expressions as a pair of node-voltage equations.
Find di1/dt and di2/dt using Cramer’s method:

di1dt=|v1Mv2L2||L1MML2|=L2L1L2−M2v1−ML1L2−M2v2;(C.3)
di2dt=|L1v1Mv2|L1L2−M2=−ML1L2−M2v1+L1L1L2−M2v2.(C.4)
Now we solve for i1 and i2 by multiplying both sides of Eqs. C.3 and C.4 by
dt and then integrating:
i1=i1(0) + L2L1L2−M2∫0tv1 dτ − ML1L2 − M2∫0tv2 dτ(C.5)
and
i2=i2(0)−ML1L2−M2∫0tv1 dτ + L1L1L2−M2∫0tv2 dτ.(C.6)
If we regard v1 and v2 as node voltages, Eqs. C.5 and C.6 describe a circuit
like the one shown in Fig. C.3.
Figure C.3 The circuit used to
derive the -equivalent circuit
for magnetically coupled coils.

Figure C.3 Full Alternative Text
To find LA, LB, and LC as functions of L1, L2, and M, write the equations
for i1 and i2 in Fig. C.3 and compare them with Eqs. C.5 and C.6. Thus
i1=i1(0) + 1LA∫0tv1 dτ + 1LB∫0t(v1−v2) dτ=i1(0) + (1LA + 1LB)∫0tv1 dτ 
− 1LB∫0tv2 dτ
and
i2=i2(0) + 1LC∫0tv2 dτ + 1LB∫0t(v1−v2) dτ=i2(0) + 1LB∫0tv1 dτ + (1LB + 1LC
Then
1LB=ML1L2−M2,
1LA=L2−ML1L2−M2,
1LC=L1−ML1L2−M2.
Incorporate the expressions for LA, LB, and LC into the circuit shown in Fig.
C.3 to get the π-equivalent circuit for the magnetically coupled coils shown in
Fig. C.1. The result is shown in Fig. C.4.

circuit for the magnetically
coupled coils of Fig. C.1.

Figure C.4 Full Alternative Text
Note that the initial values of i1 and i2 are explicit in the π-equivalent circuit
but implicit in the T-equivalent circuit. If we want to find the sinusoidal
steady-state behavior of circuits containing mutual inductance, we can
assume that the initial values of i1 and i2 are zero. We can thus eliminate the
current sources in the π-equivalent circuit, and the circuit shown in Fig. C.4
simplifies to the one shown in Fig. C.5.

The mutual inductance carries its own algebraic sign in the T- and π-
equivalent circuits. In other words, if the magnetic polarity of the coupled
coils is reversed from that given in Fig. C.1, the algebraic sign of M reverses.
A reversal in magnetic polarity requires moving one polarity dot without
changing the reference polarities of the terminal currents and voltages.
Example C.1 illustrates the application of the T-equivalent circuit.

L1−M=9−3=6H;L2−M=4−3=1H;M=3H.

Then

and
I2=136−j8900−j2100=59.63   63.43° mA.
2. When the polarity dot is moved to the lower terminal of the secondary
coil, M has a value of −3H in the T-equivalent circuit. Before analyzing
the new T-equivalent circuit, we note that reversing the algebraic sign of
M has no effect on the solution for I1 and shifts I2 by 180°. Therefore,
we anticipate that
I1=63.25   −71.57°  mA
and

I2=59.63   −116.57°  mA.
Now let’s analyze the new T-equivalent circuit. With M=−3H, the three
inductances in the equivalent circuit are
L1−M=9−(−3)=12H;L2−M=4−(−3)=7H;M=−3H.
At an operating frequency of 400 rad/s, the frequency-domain equivalent

and
I2=−8−j56900+j300=59.63   −116.57°  mA.

C.2 The Need for Ideal
Transformers in the Equivalent
Circuits
The inductors in the T- and π-equivalent circuits of magnetically coupled
coils can have negative values. For example, if L1=3mH, L2=12mH, and
M=5mH, the T-equivalent circuit requires an inductor of −2mH, and the π-
equivalent circuit requires an inductor of −5.5mH. These negative inductance
values do not create a problem if you use the equivalent circuits in
computations. However, if you want to build the equivalent circuits using
circuit components, the negative reactance can only be achieved using
capacitors. But whenever the frequency of the sinusoidal source changes, you
must change the capacitor used to generate the negative reactance. For
example, at a frequency of 50 krad/s, a −2mH inductor has an impedance of
−j100 Ω. This impedance can be modeled with a 0.2 μF capacitor. If the
frequency changes to 25 krad/s, the −2mH inductive impedance changes to
−j50 Ω. and we need a 0.8 μF capacitor. If the frequency is varied
continuously, using a capacitor to simulate negative inductance is
impractical.
Instead of using capacitors to create negative reactance, you can include an
ideal transformer in the equivalent circuit. This doesn’t completely solve the
problem because ideal transformers can only be approximated. However, in
some situations the approximation is satisfactory, so knowing how to use an
ideal transformer in the T- and π-equivalent circuits of magnetically coupled
coils is an important tool.
An ideal transformer can be used in two different ways in either the T-
equivalent or the π-equivalent circuit. Figure C.12 shows the two
arrangements for each type of equivalent circuit. To verify any of the
equivalent circuits in Fig. C.12, we must show that the equations relating v1
and v2 to di1/dt and di2/dt are identical to Eqs. C.1 and C.2. To demonstrate,
we validate the circuit shown in Fig. C.12(a); we leave it to you to verify the

circuits in Figs. C.12(b), (c), and (d).

v1=(L1 − Ma) di1dt + Ma ddt (i1 + i0)
and
v0=(L2a2 − Ma) di0dt + Ma ddt (i0 + i1).
The ideal transformer imposes constraints on v0 and i0 :
v0=v2a;
i0=ai2.
Substituting the constraint equations into the expressions for v1 and v0 from
the circuit gives
v1=L1di1dt + Ma ddt(ai2)
and
v2a=L2a2 ddt(ai2) + Ma di1dt.

Simplifying, we get,
v1=L1di1dt + Mdi2dt
and
v2=Mdi1dt + L2di2dt.
These expressions for v1 and v2 are identical to Eqs. C.1 and C.2. Thus, the
circuit shown in Fig. C.13 is equivalent to the magnetically coupled coils
shown inside the box in Fig. C.1 because the terminal behavior of these two
circuits is the same.
When we showed that the circuit in Fig. C.13 is equivalent to the
magnetically coupled coils in Fig. C.1, we placed no restrictions on the turns
ratio a. Therefore, an infinite number of equivalent circuits are possible.
However, we can always find a turns ratio that makes all of the inductances
positive. Two values of a are of particular interest:
a=ML1, (C.7)
and
a=L2M, (C.8)
The value of a given by Eq. C.7 eliminates the inductances L1 − M/a and
a2L1−aM from the T-equivalent circuits and the inductances (L1L2 
− M2)/(a2L1 − aM) and a2(L1L2−M2)/(a2L1−aM) from the π-equivalent
circuits. The value of a given by Eq. C.8 eliminates the inductances (L2/a2) 
− (M/a) and L2−aM from the T-equivalent circuits and the inductances
(L1L2−M2)/(L2−aM) and a2(L1L2−M2)/(L2−aM) from the π-equivalent
circuits.
Also note that when a=M/L1, the circuits in Figs. C.12(a) and (c) are
identical, and when a=L2/M, the circuits in Figs. C.12(b) and (d) are
identical. Figures C.14 and C.15 summarize these observations. We can use
the relationship M=kL1L2 to derive the inductor values in Figs. C.14 and
C.15 as functions of the self-inductances L1 and L2, and the coupling

coefficient k. Then, the values of a given by Eqs. C.7 and C.8 will reduce the
number of inductances needed in the equivalent circuit and guarantee that all
the inductances will be positive.

Because the N2 coil is open,
V2=jωMI1.
Since ωL1≫R1, the current I1 is
I1=V1jωL1.
Substituting the expression for I1 into the equation for V2 and rearranging
yields
(V2V1)I2=0=ML1.

Thus, the ratio M/L1 equals the ratio of the terminal voltages when I2=0.
To experimentally determine the ratio L2/M, reverse the procedure; that is,
coil 2 is energized and coil 1 is left open. Then
L2M=(V2V1)I1=0.
Example C.2 illustrates how to replace magnetically coupled coils with an
equivalent circuit that includes an ideal transformer and positive inductor
values.

Consider the circuit we analyzed in part (b) of Example C.1, which replaced
the magnetically coupled coils in Fig. C.6 (with the polarity dot on the

The equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. C.11 and must use a capacitor to
represent the negative reactance. Repeat the analysis in Example C.1(b). but
now replace the magnetically coupled coils with the equivalent circuit in Fig.

From Example C.1(b) we know that L1=9 H, L2=4 H, and M=−3 H. We need
to calculate the coupling coefficient k, the turns ratio a, and the inductor

k=ML1L2=3(9)(4)=0.5,
a=ML1=−39=−13,
L1(1k2−1)=9(10.52−1)=27H.
Note that in calculating the coupling coefficient, we ignore the sign of the
mutual inductance because this sign represents the location of the polarity
marks and has no effect on the amount of coupling between the coils.

Using the values we calculated, we can replace the magnetically coupled
coils in Fig. C.6 with the equivalent circuit in Fig. C.14(a). Remember that
the source frequency is 400 rad/sec. The result is the circuit in Fig. C.17. We
have defined the currents and voltages for the ideal transformer, so we can
write the equations for this circuit. There are three meshes, so we will write
three KVL equations using the mesh currents I1, Ia, and Ib. Then we use the
dot convention for ideal transformers to write the equations relating the
phasor currents Ia and Ib, and the phasor voltages Va and Vb:

Appendix D The Decibel
The decibel was introduced by telephone engineers to characterize the power
loss across the cascaded circuits used to transmit telephone signals. Figure
D.1 defines the problem.
Figure D.1 Three cascaded
circuits.
Figure D.1 Full Alternative Text
There, pi is the power input to the system, p1 is the power output of circuit A,
p2 is the power output of circuit B, and po is the power output of the system.
The power gain of each circuit is the ratio of the power out to the power in.
Thus
σA=p1pi, σB=p2p1, and σC=pop2.
The overall power gain of the system is the product of the individual gains, or
popi=p1pi p2p1 pop2=σAσBσC.
We can replace the multiplication of power ratios with addition if we use the
logarithm; that is,

log10popi=log10σA+log10σB+log10σC.
The log of a power ratio was named the bel, in honor of Alexander Graham
Bell. Thus, we calculate the overall power gain, in bels, by summing the
power gains, also in bels, of each segment of the transmission system. In
practice, the bel is an inconveniently large quantity. One-tenth of a bel is a
more useful measure of power gain—hence the decibel. The number of
decibels equals 10 times the number of bels, so
Number of decibels=10 log10popi.
When we use the decibel as a measure of power ratios, in some situations the
resistance seen looking into the circuit equals the resistance loading the
circuit, as illustrated in Fig. D.2. When the input resistance equals the load
resistance, we can convert the power ratio to either a voltage ratio or a current
ratio:
p o p i = υ out 2 / R L υ in 2 / R in = ( υ out υ in ) 2
or
p o p i = i out 2 / R L i in 2 / R in = ( i out i in   ) 2
Figure D.2 A circuit in which
the input resistance equals the
load resistance.

Figure D.2 Full Alternative Text
These equations show that the number of decibels becomes
Number of decibels=20 log10υoutυin =20 log10ioutiin. (D.1)
The definition of the decibel used in Bode diagrams (see Appendix E) is
borrowed from the results expressed by Eq. D.1, since these results apply to
any transfer function involving a voltage ratio, a current ratio, a voltage-to-
current ratio, or a current-to-voltage ratio. You should keep the original
definition of the decibel firmly in mind because it is of fundamental
importance in many engineering applications.
When you are working with transfer function amplitudes expressed in
decibels, having a table that translates the decibel value to the actual value of
the output/input ratio is helpful. Table D.1 gives some useful pairs. The ratio
corresponding to a negative decibel value is the reciprocal of the positive
ratio. For example, −3 dB corresponds to an output/input ratio of 1/1.41, or
0.707. Interestingly, −3 dB corresponds to the half-power frequencies of the
filter circuits discussed in Chapters 14 and 15.
Table D.1 Some dB-Ratio Pairs

The decibel is also used as a unit of power when it expresses the ratio of a
known power to a reference power. Usually, the reference power is 1 mW,
and the power unit is written dBm, which stands for “decibels relative to one
milliwatt.” For example, a power of 20 mW corresponds to ±13 dBm.
AC voltmeters commonly provide dBm readings that assume not only a 1
mW reference power but also a 600 Ω reference resistance (a value
commonly used in telephone systems). Since a power of 1 mW in 600 Ω
corresponds to 0.7746 V (rms), that voltage is read as 0 dBm on the meter.
For analog meters, there usually is exactly a 10 dB difference between
adjacent ranges. Although the scales may be marked 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, and so
on, in fact 3.16 V on the 3 V scale lines up with 1 V on the 1 V scale.
Some voltmeters provide a switch to choose a reference resistance (50, 135,
600, or 900 Ω) or to select dBm or dBV (decibels relative to one volt).

Appendix E Bode Diagrams
The frequency response plot is a very important tool for analyzing a circuit’s
behavior. Up to this point, we have shown qualitative sketches of the
frequency response without discussing how to create these plots. The best
way to generate and plot the amplitude and phase data is to use a computer;
we can rely on it to give us accurate numerical plots of |H(jω)| and θ(jω)
versus ω. But we can create preliminary sketches of the frequency response
using Bode diagrams.
A Bode diagram is a graphical technique that approximates a system’s
frequency response. These diagrams are named to recognize the pioneering
work of H. W. Bode.1 They are most useful for systems whose transfer
function poles and zeros are reasonably well separated.
1See H. W. Bode, Network Analysis and Feedback Design (New York: Van
Nostrand, 1945).
A Bode diagram consists of two separate plots: One shows how the transfer
function amplitude varies with frequency, and the other shows how the
transfer function phase angle varies with frequency. The Bode diagram plots
are constructed using semilog graph paper to accommodate a wide range of
frequencies. In both the amplitude and phase plots, the frequency is plotted
on the horizontal log scale. The amplitude and phase angle are plotted on the
linear vertical scale.

E.1 Real, First-Order Poles and
Zeros
First, we consider a transfer function, H(s), with poles and zeros that are real
and distinct. We introduce the procedure for constructing a Bode diagram
using
H(s)=K(s+z1)s(s+p1),
from which
H(jω)=K(jω+z1)jω(jω+p1).
To begin, put the expression for H(jω) in a standard form, which we derive
by dividing out the poles and zeros:
H(jω)=Kz1(1+jω/z1)p1(jω)(1+jω/p1).
Next we let Ko equal Kz1/p1, and express H(jω) in polar form:
H( jω )= K o | 1+jω/ z 1 | ψ 1 ( | ω | 90° )( | 1+jω/ p 1 | β 1 )
= K o | 1+jω/ z 1 | | ω || 1+jω/ p 1 | ( ψ 1 −90°− β 1 ) .
Therefore,
|H(jω)|=Ko|1+jω/z1|ω|1+jω/p1|,(E.1)
θ(jω)=ψ1−90°−β1.(E.2)
By definition, the phase angles ψ1 and β1 are
ψ1= tan  −1ω/z1;β1= tan  −1ω/p1.
The Bode diagram includes the plots of Eq. E.1 (amplitude) and Eq. E.2
(phase) as functions ofω.

E.2 Straight-Line Amplitude Plots
Notice from Eq. E.1 that the amplitude plot requires us to multiply and divide
values associated with the poles and zeros of H(s). We can transform the
multiplication and division into addition and subtraction if we express |H(jω)|
as a logarithmic value: the decibel (dB).2 The amplitude of H(jω) in decibels
is
2See Appendix D for more information regarding the decibel.
AdB=20 log10|H(jω)|.
Expressing Eq. E.1 in terms of decibels gives
 A dB = 20  log 10 K o | 1+jω/ z 1 | ω| 1+jω/ p 1 |   = 20  log 10 K o +20  log
10 | 1  + jω/ z 1 |  − 20  log 10 ω−20  log 10 | 1  + jω/ p 1 |. (E.3)
To construct a plot of Eq. E.3 versus frequency ω, we plot each term in the
equation separately and then combine the separate plots graphically. The
terms in Eq. E.3 are easy to plot because they can be approximated by
straight lines.
The plot of 20 log10Ko is a horizontal straight line because Ko is not a
function of frequency. The value of this term is positive for Ko>1, zero for
Ko=1, and negative for Ko<1.
Two straight lines approximate the plot of 20 log10|1+jω/z1|. For small
values of ω, the magnitude |1+jω/z1| is approximately 1, and therefore
20 log10|1+jω/z1|→0 as ω→0.
For large values of ω, the magnitude |1 + jω/z1| is approximately ω/z1, and
therefore
20 log10|1+jω/z1|→20 log10(ω/z1) as ω→∞.

On a log frequency scale, 20 log10(ω/z1) is a straight line with a slope of 20
dB/decade (a decade is a 10-to-1 change in frequency). This straight line
intersects the 0 dB axis at ω=z1. This value of ω is called the corner
frequency. Thus, two straight lines can approximate the amplitude plot of a
first-order zero, as shown in Fig. E.1.

plot of a first-order zero.

The plot of −20 log10ω is a straight line having a slope of −20 dB/decade that
intersects the 0 dB axis at ω=1. Two straight lines approximate the plot of

of ω, the straight line 20 log10(ω/p1) has a slope of −20 dB/decade. Figure

−83.72°; 20 log10 0.1094= −19.22 dB.
These two magnitude values are plotted in Fig. E.5.
4. The frequency of vi is 500 rad/sec. As we can see from the Bode plot in
Fig. E.5, the value of AdB at ω=500  rad/s is approximately −12.5 dB.
Therefore,
|H(j500)|=10(−12.5/20)=0.24
and
Vo=|H(j500)|Vi=(0.24)(5)=1.19 V.
To calculate the actual value of |H(jω)|, substitute ω=500 into the
equation for |H(jω)|:
H(j500)=0.11(j500)(1+j50)(1+j5)=0.22∠ −77.54°_.
Thus, the actual output voltage magnitude for the specified signal source
at a frequency of 500  rad/s is
Vo=|H(j500)|Vi=(0.22)(5)=1.1 V.

E.3 More Accurate Amplitude Plots
We can make the straight-line plots for first-order poles and zeros more
accurate by correcting the amplitude values at the corner frequency, one-half
the corner frequency and twice the corner frequency. At the corner frequency,
the actual value in decibels is
AdBc=±20 log10|1+j1| =±20 log102 ≈±3 dB.
The actual value at one-half the corner frequency is
AdBc/2=±20 log10|1+j12 | =±20 log1054 ≈±1 dB.
At twice the corner frequency, the actual value in decibels is
AdB2c=±20 log10|1 + j2| =±20 log105 ≈±7 dB.
In these three equations, the plus sign applies to a first-order zero, and the
minus sign applies to a first-order pole. The straight-line approximation of
the amplitude plot is 0 dB at both the corner frequency and at one-half the
corner frequency, and is ±6 dB at twice the corner frequency. Hence, the
corrections are ±3 dB at the corner frequency and ±1 dB at both one-half the
corner frequency and twice the corner frequency. Figure E.6 summarizes
these corrections.
Figure E.6 Corrected
amplitude plots for a first-
order zero and pole.


Figure E.6 Full Alternative Text
If the poles and zeros of H(s) are widely separated, you can include these
corrections into the overall amplitude plot and produce a reasonably accurate
curve. However, if the poles and zeros are close together, the overlapping
corrections are difficult to evaluate, so estimating the amplitude characteristic
using the uncorrected straight-line plot is a better choice. Use a computer to
create an accurate amplitude plot in the frequency range of interest.

E.4 Straight-Line Phase Angle Plots
We can also use straight-line approximations to plot the transfer function
phase angle versus frequency. Using the transfer function phase angle in Eq.
E.2, we know that the phase angle associated with the constant Ko is zero,
and the phase angle associated with a first-order zero or pole at the origin is a
constant ±90°. For a first-order zero or pole not at the origin, the straight-line
approximations are as follows:
For frequencies less than one-tenth the corner frequency, the phase angle
is approximated by zero.
For frequencies greater than 10 times the corner frequency, the phase
angle is approximated by ±90°.
Between one-tenth the corner frequency and 10 times the corner
frequency, the phase angle plot is a straight line with the value 0° at one-
tenth the corner frequency,  ±45° at the corner frequency, and ±90° at 10
times the corner frequency.
Throughout, the plus sign applies to the first-order zero and the minus sign to
the first-order pole. Figure E.7 depicts the straight-line approximation for a
first-order zero and pole. The dashed curves show the exact plot of the phase
angle versus frequency. Note how closely the straight-line plot approximates
the actual phase angle plot. The maximum deviation between the straight-line
plot and the actual plot is approximately 6°.

3. Using the results from Example E.1(e) and Example E.2(b), compute the
steady-state output voltage if the source voltage is given by υi(t)=10  cos
(500t−25°) V.
Solution
1. From Example E.1,
H(jω)=0.11(jω)[1+j(ω/10)]
[1+j(ω/100)]=0.11|jω||1 + j(ω/10)||1 + j(ω/100)|   (ψ1−β1−β2) .
Therefore,
θ(jω)=ψ1−β1−β2,
where
ψ 1  = 90°, β 1  = tan  −1 ( ω/10 ), and β 2  = tan  −1 ( ω/100 ).
We construct the straight-line approximation of θ(jω) by adding ψ1=90°
and the straight-line approximations for −β1 and −β2, all of which are
depicted in Fig. E.8.

−83.72°_.
Thus,
θ(j50)= −15.25°,θ(j500)= −77.54°,
and
θ(j1000)= −83.72°.
These three phase angles are identified in Fig. E.8.
3. The frequency of the input voltage is 500 rad/sec. Therefore,
 Vo=|H(j500)|Vi =(0.22)(10) =2.2 V,
and
 θo=θ(j500)+θi = −77.54°−25° = −102.54°.
Thus,
υo(t)=2.2cos(500t−102.54°) V.

E.5 Bode Diagrams: Complex Poles
and Zeros
We now consider how to construct a Bode diagram when the transfer
function has complex poles and zeros. Let’s focus on constructing the
amplitude and phase angle plots for a transfer function with a pair of complex
poles. Once you understand the rules for handling complex poles, you can
apply these rules, with minor adjustments, to create plots for a pair of
complex zeros.
The complex poles and zeros of H(s) always appear in conjugate pairs. When
H(s) has complex poles, the first step in constructing a Bode diagram for H(s)
is to combine the conjugate pair into a single quadratic term. Thus, for
H(s)=K(s+α−jβ)(s+α+jβ),
we first rewrite the product (s+α−jβ)(s+α+jβ) as
(s+α)2+β2=s2+2αs+α2+β2.
When making Bode diagrams, we write the quadratic term in a more
convenient form:
s2+2αs+α2+β2=s2+2ζωns+ωn2.
Comparing the two forms shows that
ωn2=α2+β2
and
ζωn=α.
The term ωn is the corner frequency of the quadratic term, and ζ is the
damping coefficient of the quadratic term. If ζ<1, the roots of the quadratic

term are complex, and if ζ≥1, the roots are real. Assuming that ζ<1, we
rewrite the transfer function as
H(s)=Ks2+2ζωns+ωn2.
We then write the transfer function in standard form by dividing through by
ωn2, so
H(s)=Kωn2  11+(s/ωn)2+2ζ(s/ωn),
from which
H(jω)=Ko1−(ω2/ωn2)+j(2ζω/ωn),
where
Ko=Kωn2.
We replace the ratio ω/ωn by a new variable, u. Then
H(jω)=Ko1 − u2  + j2ζu.
Now we write H(jω) in polar form:
H(jω)=Ko|(1 − u2)  + j2ζu|∠β1_,
from which
AdB=20 log10|H(jω)| =20 log10Ko− 20 log10|(1 − u2) + j2ζu|,
and
θ(jω)= −β1= − tan  −12ζu1−u2.

E.6 Straight-Line Amplitude Plots
for Complex Poles
The expression −20 log10|1 − u2  + j2ζu| represents the quadratic term’s
contribution to the amplitude of H(jω). Because u=ω/ωn, u→0 as ω→0, and
u→∞ as ω→∞. To see how the term behaves as ω ranges from 0 to∞, we
note that
−20 log10|(1 − u2)+j2ζu|= −20 log10(1 − u2)2  + 4ζ2u2 (E.4)
= −10 log10[u4  + 2u2(2ζ2 − 1)  + 1].
Then, as u→0,
−10 log10[u4+2u2(2ζ2−1)+1]→0,
and as u→∞,
−10 log10[u4+2u2(2ζ2−1)+1]→ −40 log10u.
From these limiting expressions, we see that the approximate amplitude plot
consists of two straight lines. For ω<ωn, the straight line lies along the 0 dB
axis, and for ω>ωn, the straight line has a slope of −40dB/decade. These two
straight lines join on the 0 dB axis at u=1 or ω=ωn. Figure E.9 shows the
straight-line approximation for a quadratic term with ζ<1.

E.7 Correcting Straight-Line
Amplitude Plots for Complex Poles
Corrections to the straight-line amplitude plot for a pair of complex poles
depend on the damping coefficient ζ. Figure E.10 shows the effect of ζ on the
amplitude plot. Note that when ζ is very small, a large peak in the amplitude
occurs in the neighborhood of the corner frequency ωn(u=1). When ζ≥1/2,
the corrected amplitude plot lies entirely below the straight-line
approximation. The straight-line amplitude plot can be corrected by locating
four points on the actual curve. These four points correspond to (1) one-half
the corner frequency, (2) the frequency at which the amplitude reaches its
peak value, (3) the corner frequency, and (4) the frequency at which the
amplitude is zero.

Eq. E.4 with respect to u and find the value of u where the derivative is zero.

At the cutoff frequency, the magnitude of the transfer function, |H(jωc)|,
is 3 dB less than the maximum magnitude. From the corrected plot, the
cutoff frequency appears to be about 55 rad/s, almost the same as that
predicted by the straight-line Bode diagram.

E.8 Phase Angle Plots for Complex
Poles
The phase angle plot for a pair of complex poles is a plot of θ(jω)= − tan  
−1[2ζu/(1−u2)]. The phase angle is zero at zero frequency and is −90° at the
corner frequency. It approaches −180° as ω (and, therefore, u) becomes large.
As in the case of the amplitude plot, ζ determines the exact shape of the phase
angle plot. Figure E.14 shows the effect of ζ on the phase angle plot.
Figure E.14 The effect of ζ on
the phase angle plot.

We can make a straight-line approximation of the phase angle plot for a pair
of complex poles. We do so by drawing three line segments:
For ω≤(4.81 −ζ)ωn, draw a horizontal line at 0°;
For ω≥(4.81ζ)ωn, draw a horizontal line at –180°;
For (4.81 −ζ)ωn≤ω≤(4.81ζ)ωn, draw a straight line connecting the 0°
phase angle at (4.81 −ζ)ωn to the –180° phase angle at (4.81ζ)ωn. This
line passes through –90° at ωn and has a slope of −132/ζ degrees/decade
(−2.3/ζ rad/decade).
Figure E.15 depicts the straight-line approximation for ζ=0.3 and shows the
actual phase angle plot. We see that the straight line is a good approximation
of the actual curve near the corner frequency, but the error is quite large near
the two points where the straight lines intersect. In Example E.4, we
summarize our discussion of Bode diagrams.

3. Use the straight-line amplitude plot to determine the type of filter
represented by this circuit and then estimate its cutoff frequency.

4. Find the actual cutoff frequency.
5. Make a straight-line phase angle plot of H(jω).
6. Using the plot in (e), find the phase angle at the estimated cutoff

7. Find the phase angle at the actual cutoff frequency found in (d).
Solution
1. Transform the circuit in Fig. E.16 to the s-domain and then use voltage
division to get
H(s)=RL s+1LC s2+RL s+1LC .
Substituting the component values from the circuit gives
H(s)=4(s+25)s2+4s+100.
2. The first step in making Bode diagrams is to put H(jω) in standard form.
Because H(s) contains a quadratic factor, we first check the value of ζ.
We find that ζ=0.2 and ωn=10, so
H(s)=s/25 +11 +(s/10)2 +0.4(s/10),
from which
H( jω )= | 1 +jω/25 | ψ 1 | 1− ( ω/10 ) 2  +j0.4ω/10 | β 1  .
Note that for the quadratic term, u=ω/10. The amplitude of H(jω) in
decibels is
A dB = 20  log 10 | 1+jω/25 | −20  log 10 [ | 1− ( ω 10   ) 2   +   j0.4( ω
10   ) | ],
and the phase angle is

θ(jω)=ψ1−β1,
where
ψ1= tan  −1(ω/25),β1= tan  −10.4(ω/10)1−(ω/10)2.
Figure E.17 shows the amplitude plot and includes the plots of the two
terms that make up AdB.

plot for Example E.4.

The X-axis plots frequency omega in rad per second, and
marks 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, and 1000. The Y-axis plots
Amplitude A in dB, ranging from minus 80 to 60 in
increments of 20. A grid of horizontal and vertical lines
spaced unevenly is drawn all over this graph. The graph shows

plot of 20 log 10 mod 1 plus j omega over 25 as a broken line
that runs horizontally from (0, 10) to (0, 25), and then moves
with an upward slope to reach (2000, 40).
A second plot of minus 20 log 10 mod 1 minus (omega over
10) squared plus j 0.4 multiplied by omega over 10| is shown
as a broken line that moves with a downward slope from (0,
10) to (1000, minus 80).
The Amplitude plot A sub dB = 20 log 10 |H(j omega)| is
shown as a colored line that runs horizontally from the origin
to (0, 10), then moves with a downward slope to (30, minus
18), and then continues downward with a slightly less steeper
slope to reach (500, minus 40).
3. The straight-line amplitude plot in Fig. E.17 indicates that the circuit is a
low-pass filter. At the cutoff frequency, the amplitude of H(jω) is 3 dB
less than the amplitude in the passband. From the plot, we predict that
the cutoff frequency is approximately 13 rad/s.
4. To solve for the actual cutoff frequency, replace s with jω in H(s),
compute the expression for |H(jω)|, set |H(jωc)|=(1/2 )Hmax=1/2, and
solve for ωc. First,
H(jω)=4(jω)+100(jω)2+4(jω)+100.
Then,
|H(jωc)|=(4ωc)2+1002(100−ωc2)2+(4ωc)2=12.
Solving for ωc gives us
ωc=16 rad/s.
5. Figure E.18 shows the phase angle plot, as well as plots of the two
angles −ψ1 and −β1. Note that the straight-line segment of θ(ω) between
1.0 and 2.5 rad/s does not have the same slope as the segment between
2.5 and 100 rad/s.

Figure E.18 The phase angle
plot for Example E.4.
Figure E.18 Full Alternative Text

6. From the phase angle plot in Fig. E.18, we estimate the phase angle at
the estimated cutoff frequency of 13  rad/s to be −65°.
7. We can compute the exact phase angle at the actual cutoff frequency by
substituting s=j16 into the transfer function H(s):
H(j16)=4(j16+25)(j16)2+4(j16)+100.
Computing the phase angle, we see
θ(jωc)=θ(j16)= −125.0°.
Note the large error in the predicted angle. In general, straight-line phase
angle plots do not give satisfactory results in the frequency band where
the phase angle is changing. The straight-line phase angle plot is useful
only in predicting the general behavior of the phase angle, not in
estimating actual phase angle values at particular frequencies.

with a downward slope from (2.5, minus 40) to (100, minus 180), from where
it continues to run horizontally.
The phase angle plot is shown as a colored line, theta of omega, that runs
horizontally from the origin to (0, 1), then moves with a downward slope to
intersect minus B1 angled plot at (2.5, minus 40), and then continues
downward with a slightly less steeper slope up to (100, minus 105)
(approximately). The line then rises up slightly to reach (200, minus 90) from
where it continues to run horizontally.
