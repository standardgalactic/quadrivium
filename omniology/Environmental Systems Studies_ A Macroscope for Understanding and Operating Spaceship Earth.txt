 Preface 
 As environmental problems become increasingly important today, we already see 
many undergraduate and graduate schools featuring their own educational or 
research programs related to the environment. At the same time, many academic 
 ﬁ elds have become associated with environmental sciences and studies, although no 
broad consensus actually exists yet about a systematic structure to connect those 
 ﬁ elds. In many cases it seems that groups of individuals or academic societies would 
like to see that system of scholarship focused mainly on their own areas of special-
ization. Having been af ﬁ liated with a number of academic societies, I have noticed 
that the types of people involved differ with each society, and even when consider-
ing a similar topic, their ways of thinking are quite different. I am constantly amazed 
at how diverse the approaches can be for people of different backgrounds, even 
among colleagues who specialize in the same environmental problem. 
 If we de ﬁ ne the  ﬁ eld of medicine as one that heals or prevents illness by explain-
ing the physiological mechanisms of the human body, then environmental studies 
could be considered the  ﬁ eld of medicine for the Earth. It makes extensive use of the 
knowledge of science and is a  ﬁ eld of study with the practical objectives and appli-
cations of ensuring the continued well-being and survival of humanity. Environmental 
studies must grow into a  ﬁ eld of study that investigates how to protect the life and 
health of the living body known as the Earth by bringing together, in an interdisci-
plinary manner, knowledge from other established academic  ﬁ elds. Just as many 
items are included in a health checkup for the human body, a variety of indicators 
have been developed to determine the health of the global environment. We must 
further develop such indicators, use them to monitor the health of the Earth, and 
then apply the  ﬁ ndings to prevent and treat the ills. 
 The environmental  ﬁ eld is deep and wide. When we get into the speci ﬁ cs of 
individual phenomena, even the experts cannot agree among themselves. I have 
been fortunate to have had many opportunities to learn from numerous experts, 
however, and through this experience, I have searched in my own way to  ﬁ nd com-
mon methods of analysis and thinking to approach environmental problems as 
“environmental systems studies” by looking at problems from an overarching 

vi
 perspective, identifying their core essence, and considering the conceptual  structures 
needed to come up with countermeasures. For quite some time I have wished to 
compile this material into one volume as a service to anyone who might want to 
approach environmental problems methodically from these foundations—whether 
they are students or are already working professionals, and regardless of back-
ground, whether it be the sciences, the humanities, or any other discipline. 
 One of the challenges in environmental systems studies, for both instructors and 
students, is the dearth of suitable textbooks. There are many good compilations on 
speci ﬁ c subjects, but it is dif ﬁ cult to  ﬁ nd any one source that students can use to 
learn about the various dimensions of environmental issues in just one volume. The 
aim of this book is to cover the many key points required to understand the key 
issues in a way that offers knowledge in economics and other areas in the humani-
ties to persons specialized in the sciences, and conversely, that provides information 
related to sciences—such as climate change and resource circulation—to persons 
specialized in the humanities. Indeed, this is exactly what I wish to achieve with a 
systems approach to understanding environmental problems. With this publication, 
it is my hope that readers will be able to “connect the dots” of knowledge in their 
minds, so that those dots can reveal themselves as lines, and the lines can combine 
to become planes and networks. This is a challenge to bring together knowledge 
from various academic  ﬁ elds and investigate how to protect the health of the Earth. 
 Motivated by these thoughts mentioned above, I wrote the Japanese version of 
this book in 2008. Subsequently, I wished to publish the same material in English 
for a much wider audience. It took considerably longer than I planned, however, for 
many reasons. It was not a simple translation from Japanese to English, but it was 
also a challenge to rethink the issues from the ground up. It was something like 
transplanting Japanese trees in a foreign land, and for doing this work I am very 
grateful to Mr. Randal Helten and Ms Kazuko Watanabe for their valuable advice 
and suggestions.

 1.1  Introduction: How to Address Environmental Problems 
 Nowadays, the amount of information available about environmental issues is grow-
ing dramatically. But are we drowning in this sea of information? Confronted by this 
 ﬂ ood of information, we tend to believe what we see in the media or hear from people 
around us and to be indifferent to anything not reported in the media. As a result, 
people may have a tendency to simply accept whatever is reported, instead of digging 
deeper to understand the underlying causes of what they hear stated. Thus, without 
realizing it, it is as if this information has us under a state of mind control. This state 
is both a feature and a hazard of living in our modern information-based society. 
What, then, is the best way to understand environmental issues? Above all, it is impor-
tant that we make our best effort to understand the issues correctly from a scienti ﬁ c 
basis. Actually, however, this is not as easy as one might think. In fact, one might say 
it is almost impossible. There are many issues on which leading scientists in a certain 
 ﬁ eld cannot agree about the scienti ﬁ c conclusions even among themselves. 
 Environmental issues are connected with human values and thought. Indeed, it is 
humans who are the perpetrators of environmental problems. To address these prob-
lems, it is humanity that must do something, but any action is likely to incur costs, 
and any time someone attempts to change the status quo, there will be resistance 
from someone whose interests differ. Whatever the human activity, there will almost 
certainly be some form of environmental impact, and those impacts create both 
victims and bene ﬁ ciaries. Furthermore, the extent of positives and negatives will 
vary—by country, by region, by person, and so on. Inevitably, there will also be dif-
ferences in the level of understanding and perception of problems, making it dif ﬁ cult 
to achieve a common perception and consensus. 
 We use the environment as a resource, and in some cases we damage it. We also 
enjoy economic bene ﬁ ts from the use of the environment. One could say there is a 
trade-off relationship between the environment and the economy. If the scale of the 
problem is large, however, the situation actually reverses. Global warming is one 
such example. If the world’s average temperature increases by more than 3°C—for 
 Chapter 1

Nature and Humanity

1 Seeing and Understanding Connections Between Nature and Humanity
example, by 5°—the impacts could be enormous. Even though certain regions may 
bene ﬁ t, on the whole the negative impacts would be overwhelming. This scenario 
would unfold in the future—and humans tend to give greater weight to real rewards 
today than to undetermined future losses. So, there will always be someone of the 
opinion that urgent action is not needed, making it hard to reach consensus or a 
common understanding—whether it be in relationship to the scienti ﬁ c analysis of 
the actual phenomena or about the actions that society must take. 
 In the face of challenges such as these, what is the best way for a person to cope 
objectively with the variety of information available and form one’s own opinions 
and stances? Environmental problems are indeed “problems” because they demand 
solutions. It is not enough to simply think of them as phenomena to be analyzed. It 
is also necessary to grasp the nature and urgency of the problem, to propose suitable 
solutions, and to implement the solutions. The role of technology to that end is 
important, but technologies used to handle the problem may also spawn new prob-
lems of their own. This consequence is similar to  ﬁ ghting a disease with a miracle 
cure that turns out to have devastating side effects. Furthermore, it is not enough to 
simply use technology to solve a problem. It is also necessary to have control 
through legislation, as well as economic incentives, education, and, amongst others, 
 ﬁ rm political will and social consensus to take actions to protect the environment. 
 1.2  Relationship Between Nature and Humans 
 One feature of environmental problems is their breadth. The problems are diverse, 
and many of them cannot be properly understood without a background in the natu-
ral sciences, engineering, economics, and a variety of other disciplines. Not only are 
they broad, each separate problem is also very deep. Meanwhile, if we become too 
narrowly focused on one problem, our thinking becomes partitioned and we may 
fail to “see the forest for the trees.” When choosing a map, if you know your destina-
tion well, it is  ﬁ ne to use a close-up, detailed map of the neighborhood to begin with, 
but if you are visiting for the  ﬁ rst time, it would be best to use the local map only 
after looking at the large-scale map of the city. Environmental problems are also like 
this. They require a combination of both a macro-level understanding of the over-
arching aspects and a micro-level understanding of the details. If we look objec-
tively at the status of our knowledge today we are likely to get the impression that 
humanity has accumulated a vast amount of knowledge about micro-aspects, and 
that experts are plentiful, but we may still be weak when it comes to looking at 
problems at the macro level and prescribing effective solutions. 
 This book tries to see “environmental systems” as the synergistic  relationships 
created by interactions between nature and humans. It aims at developing 
a framework of “environmental systems studies” that analyzes those relation-
ships systematically. These efforts are still a work in progress, but the author 
strongly believes in the importance of an approach that tackles these phases as 
 systems—an approach that looks at environmental problems in terms of their 
causes, mechanisms, response technologies, socioeconomic aspects, and  institutions. 

3
1.4 Understanding Environmental Systems: How Should We See Complex Issues? 
The starting point to think about this is the relationship between environmental 
space and human activity at both local and global levels. In the process, we come 
upon the fundamental issues of how large a human population and how much 
 economic activity can be supported under the qualitative and quantitative con-
straints on the resources available in a given region. It is necessary to understand 
global-level climate and meteorological systems—particularly relating to energy, 
atmospheric, and water cycles—and to think about what constraints are placed 
on human economic activity by the resource base, that is, the land, water, forests, 
biodiversity, food, fossil fuels, mineral resources, and so on, and about the 
 systems and technologies needed to overcome those constraints. 
 To read this book is also a challenge for the reader to bring together knowl-
edge from various academic  ﬁ elds and investigate how to protect the health of 
the Earth.  
 1.3  Perceiving That Which Is Not Obvious 
 Behold a picture of a face. If you use a magnifying glass, it will appear merely as a 
collection of dots. If you reduce the magni ﬁ cation, however, at a certain point it will 
begin to look like a face again. Sometimes, if you try this same type of process on 
information that at  ﬁ rst glance appears to be random and devoid of any particular 
meaning, signi ﬁ cant information will reveal itself. The term “emergence” captures 
the concept of this kind of phenomenon  [ 1,  2 ] . 
 If you look at the Milky Way in the night sky using a telescope with a suitable 
magni ﬁ cation, you will see a collection of countless stars. The magni ﬁ cation must 
be just right: too low, and you can see the galaxy but not that it contains many stars; 
too high, and you can see individual stars, but not the features of the galaxy. 
 We who live upon the Earth cannot see the whole planet, but seen from a satellite 
orbiting above it appears clearly as something  ﬂ oating in space—truly a spaceship. 
The ancient  ﬁ gures and lines drawn in the Naska Desert of Peru similarly only 
reveal their true shapes when viewed from the sky above. Small things, too, reveal 
themselves when seen through the lens of a microscope. One frame of a movie  ﬁ lm 
is nothing but a snapshot, but if you run a series of images through a projector, the 
change over time recreates a story. 
 1.4  Understanding Environmental Systems: How Should 
We See Complex Issues? 
 To understand the relationships between nature and humanity, it is necessary to 
analyze the many elements that make them up as well as their interrelationships. 
Returning to our metaphor, if we use a microscope with the proper magni ﬁ cation, 
we can enlarge and see the interrelationships between humanity and nature that 

4
1 Seeing and Understanding Connections Between Nature and Humanity
cannot be seen with the naked eye, and conversely, by telescope we can better 
understand the overall phenomenon. By viewing a series of still photos in rapid 
succession, we can compress and see long-term changes, and conversely, if we 
view them slowly, we can view rapid changes stretched out over time. 
 The common thread here is that rather than just taking the available information at 
face value, we must be selective and discover the interconnections between bits of 
information. By this effort we discover what is most meaningful. A good example is 
when we take the data from a scienti ﬁ c experiment and convert it into a line graph or 
bar graph: the numbers cease to be just numbers and reveal meaningful information. 
 Even if you discover order by looking at  ﬁ gures and graphs, however, this step alone 
will not solve problems. We must also discover the principles functioning behind this 
order. This imperative could even be considered as a basic principle of environmental 
systems studies. Referring to this as a basic principle may make it sound dif ﬁ cult, but it 
is suf ﬁ cient to think of this as a pillar of theoretical thought—a guide for thinking. 
 Specialists have a tendency to inject jargon into their communications, which 
may intimidate nonspecialists. The environmental  ﬁ elds are no exception. People 
who make themselves familiar with the knowledge and concepts that frequently 
arise when debating issues in a certain  ﬁ eld will  ﬁ nd themselves having a marked 
improvement in their understanding of those issues. Such knowledge will also give 
them a growing capacity to decipher and interpret the data. 
 1.5  The Role of Environmental Systems Analysis: 
Making the Invisible Visible 
 This book advocates “environmental systems studies” as a system of scholarship to 
methodically analyze a variety of environmental issues and phenomena. It is within 
a  ﬁ eld relating to the environment—environmental studies—and puts an emphasis 
particularly on the systems approach. 
 Even in today’s world, despite tremendous scienti ﬁ c progress, an overwhelm-
ing number of complex natural phenomena have not yet been fully explained. 
Human activities—consisting of socioeconomic systems—are interconnected in 
complex ways and are further complicated by the complexity of individual and 
group interests, desires, and values. The intricate connections between nature and 
humans involve many factors, consisting of complex systems tied together through 
feedback loops. 
 The term complex systems used here refers to more than just the literal meaning 
of systems that are complex. In recent years a  ﬁ eld of research into complex systems 
has emerged to examine the common features of such systems  [ 3– 8 ] . 
 One characteristic of complex systems is the special correlations that arise 
between inputs and outputs. For example, certain values for input variables will 
produce extreme outputs, such as phenomena known as catastrophe and chaos  [ 9 ] . 
The game of Othello is one such example. The interesting thing about the game is 
that one player’s turn can suddenly reverse his or her position. It is a simple system 

5
1.5 The Role of Environmental Systems Analysis: Making the Invisible Visible 
but can behave in a complex way. Actually, the concept of “emergence” mentioned 
earlier also arose from research into complex systems. 
 A major role of environmental systems studies is to make the invisible visible or 
make the complex easier to see, by unraveling complex problems. The  ﬁ rst step starts 
with clarifying the connections among the various elements that connect humanity and 
nature and understanding the characteristics of systems as the sum of interrelation-
ships. Here it is important to be careful about the degree of detail when analyzing the 
elements. As we saw in the foregoing example about a photograph of a face, if it is too 
detailed, we will only see the collection of dots. It is therefore essential to choose the 
appropriate level of magni ﬁ cation to see the features of the human face. In other words, 
depending on the subject of analysis, it is essential to use the proper time scale and 
spatial scale, and with human groupings as well, it is essential to decide on which level 
to examine, be it the world, the country, the municipality, or the individual. 
 To analyze a complex system, it is not always best to obtain the most elements 
possible. The larger phenomena we see, whether natural or socioeconomic, are 
macro-level phenomena, but they cannot be recreated at the macro level simply as 
the summation of micro-elements. This limitation can be understood from the fact 
that modern economics consists of macroeconomics, which deals with the perfor-
mance of the whole economy of nations, regions, and the world, and microeconom-
ics, which studies the behavior of individual households and  ﬁ rms. Similarly, 
physics is made up of thermodynamics, which delineates the macroscopic bulk 
properties of materials and statistical mechanics that provides a molecular-level 
interpretation of macroscopic thermodynamics. 
 The Earth’s climate system—the circulation of air and water driven by solar 
energy—could also be considered as a type of complex system that is the subject of 
environmental studies  [ 10 ] . Other examples of complex systems are the ecosystems 
created through interactions among living things, which continue to evolve in 
response to this climate system  [ 11,  12 ] . The business cycles created by human 
economic activities provide other examples  [ 13 ] . 
 To analyze such systems, we must have both a macro- understanding of large-
scale behavior and a micro- analysis of detailed system constituents. Depending on 
the nature of the problem, a middle approach may also be required that focuses 
attention on the subsystems which constitute the systems. Ecosystems consist of a 
large number of diverse species, and although we may view them broadly as indi-
vidual systems, it is also necessary to look at ecosystems at the level of each species 
and the individuals within them and, in fact, even at the cellular and genetic levels. 
 The subjects of environmental systems analysis also include many problems 
that cannot be explained by numbers alone. Good examples of this point include 
the urban amenities, the visual attractiveness of landscapes and livability of neigh-
borhoods. Another point to note is that even if one understood the relationships 
between humanity and nature, this would not automatically make decision making 
happen. The question of what priority to give the environment when comprehen-
sively evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of various factors and making 
policy decisions depends on how the various players in society—individual 
 citizens, corporations, and so on—value the environment. One other important 

6
1 Seeing and Understanding Connections Between Nature and Humanity
function of environmental systems studies is to continue providing comprehensible 
and accurate information on the environment that can help with the consensus 
building and decisionmaking of our society.  
 1.6  Nature and Humanity: Understanding the Connections 
 For detailed analyses of environmental problems, it is important to have an under-
standing of both natural phenomena and the socioeconomic activities that affect 
them. Research into speci ﬁ c natural phenomena falls under existing academic 
 ﬁ elds that specialize in such areas as meteorology, biology, ecology, atmospheric 
chemistry, and oceanography. An important function of environmental systems 
analysis is to utilize the  ﬁ ndings of these disciplines to analyze the impacts of 
human activities on the environment and, conversely, to examine the effects of 
those impacts on humans. A detailed understanding of human activities—in other 
words, socioeconomic analysis—is another important pillar of such efforts. 
 Consider global warming, for example. What amount of greenhouse gases 
would be emitted if current technologies were applied for the next 50 or 100 years 
and if economic growth in each country continues according to a certain scenario? 
What would be the impact on global warming? Or, if we shift to other technology 
systems, how would the outcomes change, and how would the outcomes affect the 
world? These are key themes to be addressed. 
 Many similar problems exist for individual river systems, lakes, seas, and so on. 
For example, key themes for Lake Biwa in Japan would relate to pollution from 
development around the lake. How polluted is the lake? What are the causes? And 
what methods are available to clean it up? The systems under consideration consist 
of many constituent factors. It is important to conduct research on the relevant fac-
tors, which have many detailed components. Without that research, it would be 
dif ﬁ cult to understand the entire system. An adequate understanding of those com-
ponents is a precondition, but the special role of environmental systems studies is to 
help us understand the systems that are created by the interconnection between 
nature and human society. 
 Figure  1.1 shows the concept of environmental systems studies and their role in 
environmental management. 
 1.7  Facilitating Rational Decision-Making 
 The foregoing discussion about environmental studies and environmental sys-
tems studies is based on the implicit assumption that human judgment and deci-
sion making are rational and reasonable. Humans are, however, often described 
as “Homo economicus”  [  14  ] . They are rational and narrowly self-interested 
actors. In the face of their own desires, they can easily ignore long-term and 
uncertain information. Special consideration is needed to prepare and present 

7
1.7 Facilitating Rational Decision-Making
information in ways that can cause changes in human behavior. To examine one 
such attempt, let us consider the activities of the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC). 
 The IPCC was established in 1988 to synthesize available human knowledge 
about global warming. It consists of a few thousand scientists and policy of ﬁ cials 
from countries around the world who investigate and discuss these topics. The IPCC 
conducts analyses and assessments to address various questions. For example, is 
global warming really occurring  [ 10 ] ? What might be its impacts  [ 15 ] ? How much 
might future temperatures and sea levels rise if current world population growth and 
economic growth continue? And, what would be the effects of various technological 
and economic countermeasures  [ 16 ] ? 
 Regarding countermeasures, the IPCC considers a wide spectrum of possibilities 
for future predictions and conducts analysis using different scenarios. These detailed 
analyses are based on a mountain of literature from around the world. The IPCC 
also summarizes the essence of its  ﬁ ndings into easy-to-understand and condensed 
formats, so that policymakers and others can understand the key  ﬁ ndings  [ 17 ] . 
This work is a labor of making it easier to see that which had been dif ﬁ cult to see. 
 Although environmental studies often focus at the regional level, the important 
thing at every level is that they clarify environmental changes that may have escaped 
notice even though they occur right before our eyes. Such studies provide informa-
tion about what these changes mean to local human activities, to human society and 
economy; what conditions should be sustained locally; and to that end, what kinds 
of measures or methods might be undertaken. Through this work, environmental

systems studies contribute to rational decision making. This kind of information 
also helps improve citizens’ and corporations’ understanding of environmental 
problems, which leads to local consensus building and to the implementation of 
effective measures based on that consensus. 
 In every discipline, the pure pursuit of knowledge is obviously a good thing. 
This fundamental scholarship also exists in environmental systems studies, which in 
many cases do not necessarily seek practical applications. Certain themes—for 
example, What is the value of nature for humanity? How can attitudes favorable to 
the environment be formed? What are the different views held in human societies 
about environmental problems and how should those differences be resolved? etc.—
are ultimately about the relationships between nature and humanity, although it is 
true that they can also contribute to environmental management. 
 1.8  Policy Decisions on Development and Conservation 
 The human act of using nature is often referred to as development  [ 18,  19 ] . Human 
activity consists of a countless number of acts of “development,” and the issue of 
environmental protection could be seen as relating to one’s assessment of the envi-
ronmental impacts brought about by those acts. This issue also relates to con ﬂ icts 
between two typical stances on the relationship between nature and humanity: 
whether to prioritize development or to prioritize the environment. One stance 
seeks, to the greatest extent possible, to eliminate the interference of humans in 
nature. The other accepts the idea that humanity can actively exploit nature for its 
own bene ﬁ t. These are also the differences between “ecocentrism” and “anthropo-
centrism,” as described later in Chap.   7  [ 20,  21 ] . 
 If we were to accept one extreme, there would be no need for environmental 
studies. Just like other animals, humans could live as a part of nature and simply 
accept the destiny that nature gives us. If we were to accept the other extreme, 
humans could completely ignore nature, and again there would be no need for envi-
ronmental studies. For humanity to live on Earth, we need to have harmony with the 
environment, but our hand on the environment must not be too careless; often we 
must act to control our desires, and it is here that the need and the role exist for 
scholarship specializing in environmental issues. 
 Human cleverness and technology have given us the ability to predict, to some 
extent, the impacts we have on nature, and we also have the ability, to some extent, 
to avoid the negative impacts that return from nature to us. We would be wise to use 
those abilities to moderate our own activities. Others may have different thoughts on 
this point, but the author personally believes that by improving our understanding of 
the connection between humanity and nature, we can realize a more positive rela-
tionship with nature. 
 We must also recognize, however, that humanity is not omnipotent when it 
comes to controlling and managing the environment. In fact, our powers are 

9
1.9 Macro and Micro: Grand Views and Detailed Analysis
extremely limited. Furthermore, even if we were able to accurately predict our 
impacts on the environment, it is not entirely self-evident what actions we 
should take. The choice to engage in a behavior that will affect the environment 
is taken because it is expected to have some kind of bene ﬁ t for society, or at 
least for certain people in society; thus, it is dif ﬁ cult to obtain complete consen-
sus of all members of society when it comes to stopping or preventing this 
behavior. So there is the challenge. If we weigh the merits of development 
against the demerits of negative impacts on the environment, what will be the 
correct judgment? 
 Recently, advances in environmental economics have produced research meth-
odologies to carry out cost–bene ﬁ t analyses and quantify both the positives and 
negatives of development in monetary terms. Numbers cannot solve everything, 
however. Certain values cannot be represented quantitatively, and these values differ 
with each person, culture, and era. Also, such approaches run the serious risk of 
trying pass judgment on the big picture based only on selected information extracted 
from the whole. 
 1.9  Macro and Micro: Grand Views and Detailed Analysis 
 Environmental studies themselves are a system of scholarship that aims to help us 
to understand the connection between humanity and nature, and to create a positive 
relationship between the two. To that end, it is necessary to recognize and under-
stand the mutual relationships between nature and humanity, by using a variety of 
techniques and methodologies; environmental studies are structured as a collection 
of the knowledge required for that purpose. Both macro- and micro-approaches are 
necessary in environmental studies: these could be called macro-environmental 
studies and micro-environmental studies. 
 Macro-environmental studies take the broad perspective of the relationships 
between human activities and the environment at the level of the entire globe, con-
tinents, countries, cities, and watersheds. This system of scholarship analyzes envi-
ronmental space—in other words, the environmental constraints on human activities, 
and the potential scope of human activities within those constraints. 
 Medicine as a  ﬁ eld deals with human health and illness, and it includes both 
basic and clinical medicine. Similarly, environmental studies deal with the health 
and ills of the Earth, and we could say this  ﬁ eld includes both basic environmental 
studies and clinical environmental studies. The environmental systems studies that 
the author wishes to discuss here are based on the search to bridge basic and clinical 
environmental studies with an aim to examining the relationships between nature 
and humanity and to improve human activities and decision making. They are rooted 
more in the macro rather than the micro-domain. We must never forget, however, 
that this macro area of study is possible only because of the accumulation of vast 
amounts of knowledge and new discoveries in the micro-domain.

 2.1  The Earth and Humanity 
 2.1.1  Spaceship Earth 
 The Earth is a planet  ﬂ oating in space. Its size is  ﬁ nite, as are the resources present 
here. So long as the sun continues to burn during its long life, however, the Earth 
will continue to receive solar energy. With the exception of meteors and the like 
from space, solar energy is the only resource that can be obtained from beyond the 
Earth in any sustained manner. Solar energy, therefore, is the key factor that can 
really ensure sustainability on Earth. 
 The drive to exceed the limits of our  ﬁ nite resources—in response to the need for 
more land and food, for example—has fostered human intelligence. Human pros-
perity today is the result. Human creativity, science and technology should rightly 
be dedicated to overcoming the limits we face, and indeed, those are the real drivers 
of progress and development. Short of moving to another planet, however, there is 
no other way that we can overcome the physical and quantitative limits that are 
determined by the size of this planet known as the Earth. 
 The concepts of the Earth as a spaceship, and of “Spaceship Earth,” clearly adopt 
this line of thought. This term was  ﬁ rst used by architect and thinker R. Buckminster 
Fuller in his book  Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth (1963), and it was further 
popularized by a 1966 paper written by economist Kenneth E. Boulding titled “The 
Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth”  [ 1,  2 ]. 
 Fuller, Boulding, and other thinkers tell us clearly that the Earth’s resources are 
 ﬁ nite and that it is impossible to sustain an “open economy” based on the presump-
tion of unlimited resources. Fuller points out that it is solar energy that the Earth can 
continuously receive from outside and tells us the folly of continuing to consume 
the  ﬁ nite fossil fuels that have accumulated over the long history of the Earth. 
Boulding referred to a “cowboy economy” as a wasteful one that ignores the 
 ﬁ niteness of resources and wrote that in the future a “closed economy” must keep 
economic activity within a cyclical global ecological system. This is nothing less 
 Chapter 2

12

than today’s concept of the “circular economy”  [ 3 ] . The global population in the 
1960s when those works were published was still under four billion. Today it is over 
seven billion. The ideas they proposed are increasingly relevant today. 
 2.1.2  A Shrinking Planet 
 The cause of environmental problems could be attributed to the rapid increase in 
resource and energy consumption associated with population and economic growth. 
For humanity, the world is quickly becoming a smaller place, and we are like a  ﬁ sh 
whose body has grown too big for its  ﬁ sh tank. The air and food in the tank have 
begun to run out, and the water is becoming polluted from excretion. That the Earth 
was a body  ﬂ oating in space has been known since ancient Greece. Even so, for a 
long time after that, much of the Earth was an enormous unknown domain. The  ﬁ rst 
time the author felt the smallness of the Earth was when he traveled from Japan to 
Brazil on the opposite side of the Earth. The  ﬂ ight from Tokyo via New York to Sao 
Paolo took 24 h. Although this was a great distance, this experience drove home the 
point that anyone could circle the entire globe by  ﬂ ying for merely 48 h. 
 In 1969, man  ﬁ rst stood on the face of the moon during the United States’ Apollo 
11 space mission. The Earth seen from the moon is four times larger than the moon 
seen from the Earth, and it sparkles blue (Fig.  2.1 ). Our planet is the Spaceship 
Earth that carries seven billion people and many other living things. Our challenge 
is learning how to operate it. Apollo 11 succeeded despite a number of technical 
problems. Failure of a small component or a small system error could have resulted 
in a serious accident. In a way, environmental problems are similar to breakdowns 
and system errors on our spaceship. We must come to realize that a small failure 
could lead to the ruin of Spaceship Earth. 
 2.1.3  Humanity and Environment: Interconnected 
 Environment could be seen as nothing less than the entire Earth that humanity lives 
on: it is everything that  ﬂ ourishes around us, thanks to the interactions of solar 
energy, atmosphere, water, soil, and all living things. Humans are living things that 
live by taking resources from the natural world and using the environment. What is 
different between humans and other living things is that humans are the only ani-
mals with the capacity to control and manage their environment according to our 
will through the advanced knowledge that we possess and the technologies born 
from that knowledge. 
 Controlling and managing nature is a very dif ﬁ cult thing, however. Nature also 
has the destructive power we can see in typhoons, hurricanes, storms,  ﬂ oods, 
earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and tsunamis. Humans do not have the power to 

13
2.1 The Earth and Humanity
directly prevent the occurrence of these extreme events, but by predicting the path 
of typhoons, hurricanes, and storms, and by building breakwaters to hold back 
 ﬂ oods, we do have the capacity to reduce the damage they cause. Meanwhile, as 
a result of the expansion of the size and extent of human activities, large changes 
are occurring in nature itself. 
 Until now the condition of the global environment has changed in accordance 
with the rhythms of nature—the rules of evolution of the universe—but those 
rhythms are changing as a result of human activities. Global warming has become a 
matter of serious concern for all of humanity today, although in the past 4.6 billion 
years of the Earth’s history there were periods much hotter and much colder than 
today. The phenomenon of climate change itself as a process of nature is neither 
right nor wrong, neither good nor bad  [ 4– 6 ] . 
 The problem is that the rhythms of nature have been disrupted by human activities, 
and those changes are having enormous impacts not only on humanity, but on all things 
living on Earth. The most serious among these impacts is the extinction of species. 
Already in the past there have been innumerable species extinctions and new appear-
ances through the processes of evolution of life, so extinction in itself is not a extraor-
dinary event. The problem is that we humans are causing environmental changes that 
exceed the capacity of species to adapt and evolve in response to changes  [ 7– 9 ] .  
 2.1.4  Recognizing and Understanding the Finiteness of the Earth 
 Since the dawn of history, or at least since the beginning of agriculture and the creation 
of human settlements, the human population has continued to grow and the human con-
sumption of resources has climbed steadily. It is almost self-evident that our consump-
tion of resources cannot possibly continue to increase forever. We must therefore ask 
 Fig. 2.1   Planet earth as seen from the moon 
 

14
2 Operating Our Spaceship Earth
ourselves this: What is the  optimum human population on the Earth? And how many 
humans  can  live on Earth? The  ﬁ rst factor to consider is food production. Various theo-
ries put the maximum at between ten billion and twenty billion people, depending on the 
calculations for arable land area and agricultural output based on crop production per 
hectare. The numbers may be disputed, but there is undisputedly a limit  [ 10 ] . 
 To continue living decent lives on this planet—Spaceship Earth—the challenge 
facing us is to  ﬁ nd rational ways to use its resources. Rational use here does not 
mean the unilateral exploitation of resources. It means suppressing the use of 
resources by using technology intelligently and dramatically changing the very 
methods of resource use, and we refer to all this as environmental management or 
environmental protection. Environmental management requires that we rationally 
limit the human appetite for resource consumption and to do that we need science 
and technology, as well as a collection of policy and economic methods  [ 11 ] . 
Moreover, there are many aspects of this discussion that involve subjective and 
personal values, so there is also an important role for environmental philosophy, 
environmental ethics and other dimensions of human thought  [ 12– 14 ] . 
 2.1.5  Recognizing the Limits to Growth 
 It is possible to predict the sustainable limits of human population and scale of 
human activities on Earth, but this challenge involves a variety of factors and com-
plex relationships, so the debate is not as simple as one might hope. The  ﬁ rst attempt 
to systematically express an opinion regarding this problem on a global scale was 
the report by the Club of Rome released in 1970, called  The Limits to Growth  [ 15– 17 ] . 
The basis for the report was a simulation of the world’s future population, economic 
activity, industrial production, resource use, and environment, led by Dennis 
Meadows and Donella Meadows who were at the time graduate students at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
 It is obvious that Earth has a  ﬁ nite size, so it must be impossible to continue 
allowing population, gross domestic product, resource consumption, and pollution 
to grow exponentially forever at a certain percent per year. At a certain point, we 
will obviously crash into some limits. When the report was released, however, crit-
ics attacked it, saying that the analytical methods were crude, and that the report 
underestimated the capacity of the market economy system to correct itself, as well 
as the potential for technological advances  [ 18,  19 ] . 
 An enormous amount of research has been conducted since then to predict 
the world’s future, aided with improved data base and signi ﬁ cant advances in 
computing. Indeed, if we examine the  ﬁ ndings of  The Limits to Growth , they do 
seem crude in the light of more recent research based on the latest models and 
vast amounts of elaborate data. To this day, however, the original basic approach 
and framework of analysis are entirely valid. 
 Now we must ask how we can circumvent the limits to growth. There are num-
ber of possible responses to this question. The  ﬁ rst is optimism. The basis for this 

15
2.1 The Earth and Humanity
is a  ﬁ rm belief in the self-regulating or self-correcting nature of economies and 
societies. This is something close to the belief in the “invisible hand” referred to 
in economics  [  20 ] . If we run out of oil, its price will rise, and rising price will 
accelerate the development and introduction of nuclear power and renewable 
energies, thereby preventing any problems. And even if some problems arise, they 
will eventually be corrected. Humans are intelligent, so they will without fail take 
rational action before problems become too serious. That is the thinking behind 
the optimistic response. 
 Optimism may be a good thing, but do humans really act that rationally? Could 
our emphasis on economic gain possibly cause irreversible negative changes to the 
environment? It may be too late to take action if we realize we have exceeded the 
limits only after exceeding them. Whether it be global warming or the logging of 
vast tracts of forests in the Amazon, it is extremely dif ﬁ cult to restore original con-
ditions after changes have occurred. Many environmental changes are indeed irre-
versible  [ 21,  22 ] . When we think about such risks, it becomes clear that there is an 
extremely important role for people who take the pessimistic view and continue to 
ring the warning bells. 
 What we must pay attention to here is the issue of time scales. If we look at time 
scales of tens or hundreds of years, mutual feedback works between human activi-
ties and their environment to create some kind of balance. Human economic activi-
ties change the environment, and then humans are forced to adapt to those changes 
in the environment. If we look at the short term, however, this mutual relationship 
may become imbalanced. The result is known as “overshoot”  [ 15 ] . 
 During Japan’s period of rapid economic growth after World War II, industrial 
production expanded without regard to the environment, setting off pollution 
problems  [ 23 ] . The trigger that caused a correction was the sudden oil shock in 1973. 
The rate of economic growth slowed as a result of the rapid rise in oil prices, and 
the economy descended into chaos as people panicked and hoarded goods. 
Triggered by the oil shock, however, Japan’s economic growth settled at a more 
moderate level, and Japanese corporations, particularly in the manufacturing 
industry, gained a new interest in environmental countermeasures and energy 
conservation. 
 The irony is that it was the oil crisis that helped create a better balance between 
the economy and the environment. Seen this way, the oil crisis may indeed have 
been an adjustment wrought by the “invisible hand.” 
 2.1.6  The Dif ﬁ culty of Prediction 
 While the author was writing this manuscript, from July through December 2008, 
the international price of crude oil plummeted from a record high of nearly 150 dol-
lars per barrel down to less than 40 dollars per barrel. At the same time the global 
economy was tossed about by rapid shrinking of credit markets, triggered by the 
sub-prime loan crisis in the United States, causing a serious downturn in the global 

16
2 Operating Our Spaceship Earth
economy. National governments around the world found themselves facing an eco-
nomic crisis on a scale that apparently occurs only once every 100 years. Fervently 
hoping for an economic recovery, they were using all their tools of  ﬁ nancial and 
 ﬁ scal policy: no one was con ﬁ dent that these policy prescriptions would bring about 
the desired effects. The crisis was foreseen more than a year earlier, but the actual 
conditions worsened much more quickly than predicted, and pessimism further 
accelerated a negative spiral of pessimism. 
 This situation is rich with implications when we consider global environmental 
problems. The global environmental system, similar to the global economic system, 
is a complex system involving interactions among innumerable factors. In a com-
plex system such as this, a certain order is generally maintained in overall equilib-
rium for a certain period of time, but from time to time the response to a small 
disturbance can cause a large reaction, triggering rapid changes  [ 24,  25 ] . This 
sequence may be similar to major accidents in which a small error triggers a large 
accident through a subsequent chain of errors. If corrective action is taken at an 
early stage there may be no problem, but once the chain of errors gains momentum, 
it may run out of control. This risk is something we must not forget when it comes 
to the operation of Spaceship Earth. 
 2.2  Environmental Space 
 2.2.1  Absorptive Capacity/Carrying Capacity of the Environment 
 There is a certain number of  ﬁ sh that can be raised in one aquarium tank. If you do 
not put pebbles into the bottom of the tank, grow seaweed, provide aeration with a 
pump, and so on, the water will become depleted of oxygen, the water will become 
polluted, and the  ﬁ sh will die. Spaceship Earth is similar. 
 A certain limit exists for the allowable amount of human activities on the Earth: 
this could be called “environmental space.” Besides the environmental space of the 
entire planet, a city, a watershed, a lake, or the sea will also have a certain amount 
of environmental space. For the entire planet or for speci ﬁ c regions, we must ask 
ourselves how to control the relationships between nature and humanity. What 
amount of human activity is permitted  quantitatively within constraints of environ-
mental space? How can we change our activities  qualitatively if we assume that 
there are quantitative limits? 
 The most basic environmental factors for living things involve climatic and 
meteorological conditions such as temperature, humidity, sunlight, and rain. The 
climate and meteorological systems—which include the atmosphere and water cir-
culation, that is wind and air currents, evaporation, cloud formation, precipitation, 
and river ﬂ ows—are driven by the energy from the sun and determine the survival 
of living things, humans included. 

17
2.2 Environmental Space
 Climate and meteorological systems were always thought of as being driven by 
nature and beyond human in ﬂ uence. Today, we know that nature is being changed 
by the pressure of human activities. Local climates can change if forestlands are 
converted to farmland and water resources are overused for irrigation. 
Overconsumption of coal, oil, and other fossil fuels raises the concentration of car-
bon dioxide in the atmosphere, triggering global warming as a result of the green-
house effect  [ 4 ] . 
 Further meanwhile, the chloro ﬂ uorocarbons used as refrigerants in refrigerators 
and propellants in spray cans are themselves strong greenhouse gases. At the same 
time, they also destroy the stratospheric ozone layer, increasing the amount of ultra-
violet light reaching the Earth, especially in places like Antarctica, South America, 
and Australia, raising concern about the threat of rising skin cancer rates  [ 26 ] . 
 Changes are also occurring at the city level. Traf ﬁ c congestion and air pollution 
are worsening due to increasing automobile traf ﬁ c, and energy consumption contin-
ues to increase from transportation, air-conditioning of buildings, and electrical 
machines. The loss of urban greenery, replaced by concrete buildings and asphalt 
roads, is causing the urban heat island effect  [ 27 ] . 
 The common factor among all these examples is that there are certain limits in 
the quantity and type of activities that humans are able to do in relationship to the 
environment. Table  2.1 demonstrates environmental resources allocated to one per-
son. The land area allotted to one person, or the global total land area divided by the 
world population in 2005, is 20.9 are, of which cultivated arable land area is only 
7.6 are (or 760 m 2 ). Here, 1 are equals to 100 m 2 , or 1 ha is 10,000 m 2 . Today, this 
cultivated arable land area can produce the global average of 341 kg of grain per 
capita, which is just enough to support the increasing world population.  
 2.2.2  How to Determine Environmental Space 
 The approaches to calculate and assess the environmental space of a region or the 
entire Earth depend on the item being considered, on the size of the target region, 
and on the timescale. In any region, there will be limits to the sustainable size of 
human population and the amount of activity  [ 28  ] . For the simplest example, it is 
worth considering how many people can live on a remote island. 
 Easter Island in the South Paci ﬁ c has become famous for its monumental  moai 
stone statues. In the third or fourth century  ad , this island was apparently covered 
with subtropical vegetation of palm trees, shrubs, and grass. People migrated to the 
island, and the population at its peak is estimated at about 20,000. The Clearing of 
the forests for farming and other uses left the island devoid of all trees. Because the 
forests were gone the topsoil was eroded away, the farmland depleted, and the lack 
of wood meant that no longer could anyone even make canoes for  ﬁ shing. Evidently, 
wars broke out between different tribes on the island, the human population plum-
meted, and the people eventually abandoned making their stone statues. 

18

 An interesting comparison is the Edo period in Japan (1603–1868  ad ), which 
maintained an isolated economy during two and a half centuries of seclusion poli-
cies  [ 29 ] . Japan admittedly has a vaster land area than Easter Island, the environ-
ment is more diverse, and the country enjoys abundant resources from the mountains, 
seas, and nature. The Japanese archipelago receives abundant precipitation thanks 
to its location in the temperate monsoon region, and the forests were able to grow 
well in mountainous geography. Of particular note, however, is that the size of pop-
ulation that could be sustained by the Japanese islands was entirely determined by 
food productivity. As a result, years of bad weather meant starvation for many. 
 2.2.3  Using Technology to Expand Environmental Space 
 Environmental space is not a  ﬁ xed quantity. It is possible to increase the amount of 
space by using technology. Some of the factors that affect food productivity include 
soil fertility, water, and weather; there are many other factors. Figure  2.2 . shows land 
area harvested and grain production of the world. Today it is possible to produce more 
than 6 metric tons of grains (rice, wheat, etc.) per hectare of arable land in Japan. 
In the Edo period, rice was measured in  koku,  with one  koku equal to 150 kg of rice 
(2.5 sacks of about 60 kg each), which was the minimum amount of rice a person 
needed to survive for a year. So productivity today would be equivalent to about 40 
 koku  per hectare, but land productivity during the Edo period was about 10–20  koku 
per hectare, much lower than it is today, although it varied by region. Thus, by these

 ﬁ gures, it is possible to estimate the livelihoods and economic output of that era, and 
the Japanese population did not exceed 30 million people during the Edo period.  
 As of 2002, the total cultivated land area worldwide was about 15.6 million km 2 , and 
grain production per land area was about 1.4 tons/ha. This works out to 341 kg per per-
son. Today’s high productivity (measured as harvest amount per hectare) is possible 
thanks largely to selective crop breeding and the use of agrochemicals such as fertilizers 
and pesticides. One could say this productivity is the result of technological progress in 
agriculture. We are already using most of the land suitable for agriculture, however, so 
large future increases in cultivated land area are unlikely. This limitation means that to 
respond to population growth we need large increases in output per hectare.  
 2.2.4  Limiting Factors and Trade: Time and Space 
 Environmental space depends on how the boundary conditions of time and space are 
determined. During the Edo period, Japan’s carrying capacity based on rice-centered 
food production was about 30 million people. Today however, Japan depends on food 
from overseas for about 60% of its caloric intake, and the population is hundred and 
twenty  ﬁ ve million people. These changes are possible because of the bene ﬁ ts of trade. 
 International trade is one means to increase the environmental space of a region. 
In the past, European powers solved their land and resource constraints by claiming

many other regions of the world as colonies. Today, however, the populations of 
developing countries in Asia, Africa, and elsewhere are increasing, and their own 
demand for resources is growing rapidly. One fear today is that the history that 
unfolded on Easter Island may unfold for the entire world. 
 Incidentally, some resources can simply not be transferred easily. One of these is 
land, and another is water. Today groundwater from France is poured into plastic 
bottles and shipped to convenience stores in Japan, but it is simply not economically 
feasible to transport large volumes of water from overseas to Japan for agriculture 
or industry. Yet some people predict that during this century, water shortages around 
the world will intensify and turn water into a strategic commodity like oil, and huge 
tankers will be used to transport water around the world. 
 Today’s globalized economic system is supported by transportation systems that 
can send large amounts of resources to faraway places. This is all made possible by 
oil. Ships, automobiles, and airplanes cannot operate without oil. Our generation 
today is swallowing up fossil fuel stocks that we should be leaving for future gen-
erations; we are reducing the remaining environmental space on the Earth. 
 Fossil fuels are a stock of solar energy that was collected through plant photosyn-
thesis during the course of the long history of the Earth, over hundreds of millions of 
years. If fossil fuel stocks were to run out, and we had to sustain today’s high standard 
of living only with the  ﬂ ow of solar energy, the global population that could be carried 
would have to be much smaller than today. This change would occur because the land 
now being used for food production would have to be converted to production of fuels 
such as bioethanol. Conversely, if it were possible to reduce the global population to 
half the current level in the next 100 or 200 years, humanity could probably manage 
quite well using solar energy and biofuels instead of fossil fuels. The use of nuclear 
power and nuclear safety issues, however, are matters of serious concern.  
 2.2.5  Climate Change 
 Global warming, or the rising average temperature of Earth’s atmosphere and oceans 
since the late nineteenth century, is the most pressing problem today, demanding 
urgent responses from humanity. 
 There is a correlation between concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmo-
sphere and the rise of average temperatures on the planet. To limit the predicted warm-
ing within a certain range, it is necessary to reduce the total greenhouse gas emissions 
from human activities to within certain limits. This is none other than the environmen-
tal space of the Earth from the perspective of preventing global warming. 
 At the Earth Summit—the United Nations Conference on Environment and 
Development—held in Brazil in 1992, countries of the world signed the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which requires 
them to report to the convention secretary on the amounts of greenhouse gases they 
emit each year. In 1997, the third conference of the parties (or COP3) to the 
Convention was held in Kyoto, resulting in the Kyoto Protocol, which contains 
national emission reduction targets for developed countries, including the United 

21
2.2 Environmental Space
States, Japan, and countries in the European Union. It is not easy, however, to 
achieve the Protocol’s national reduction targets, and in fact the United States with-
drew from its commitment to the Kyoto Protocol in 2001, saying that any decision 
was meaningless if it did not include large emitters such as China and India. 
 Today, in the 2010s, countries are discussing a shared target of greater reduction 
in worldwide greenhouse gas emissions to stop global warming. Some countries in 
the European Union, including the United Kingdom and Germany, are considering 
bolder reductions of 80% by 2050. This series of activities is a framework to assess 
and to limit human activities within the boundaries of our global environmental 
space, from the perspective of allowable limits of total greenhouse gas emissions. 
This threshold should not be simply interpreted as something that will restrict 
human endeavors. Why not? Because it is exactly when confronted with constraints 
that human intelligence is stimulated, innovative new technologies are developed, 
and new paths forward are discovered. 
 2.2.6  Air Pollution, Water Pollution 
 The problem of air pollution is a typical example of environmental problems brought 
on by modern industry. The sources of air pollution include the burning of coal and 
oil in factories and power plants, as well as fuel combustion by automobiles. During 
the 1960s, Japan experienced serious air pollution in industrial cities such as 
Yokkaichi, Kawasaki, and Kitakyushu. 
 We can recall how awful the air pollution was in Japanese cities including Tokyo 
at the time of rapid economic growth in the 1960s. Indeed, in Tokyo at the time, 
there was a surge in respiratory disorders such as asthma, which we now know is 
associated with air pollution. The pollution spawned a powerful citizens’ movement 
that demanded prompt countermeasures, and the governments and industry ulti-
mately responded with measures to clean the air. If we are to protect our health, 
pollutant concentrations in air and water (including rivers, lakes, and oceans) must 
be maintained below certain levels. Environmental quality standards are used to set 
those quantitative indicators  [ 23 ] . 
 To achieve and maintain environmental quality standards, the amounts of pollut-
ants emitted from sources such as factories, buildings, and automobiles must be 
reduced. For that reduction it is necessary to establish regulations to keep the con-
centrations of pollutants in emissions and ef ﬂ uent below certain levels. However, 
even if the pollution concentrations from individual sources are reduced, if the num-
ber of sources grows, the concentrations in the environment will not decline. 
In large metropolises such as like Tokyo and in industrial parks containing many 
factories, it is not effective to simply regulate individual sources. The answer is to 
introduce an overall reduction formula that establishes an upper limit on total emis-
sions of air pollutants for an entire region. 
 In Japan, pollutants from surrounding areas  ﬂ ow into enclosed seas (e.g., Seto 
Inland Sea, Tokyo Bay and Ise Bay) and lakes (e.g., Lake Biwa and Kasumigaura). 
The sources of the ef ﬂ uent include households, farms, livestock operations, and 

22
2 Operating Our Spaceship Earth
other non-point sources, distributed along the rivers that  ﬂ ow into the seas and lakes. 
These areas have successfully made large reductions in the pollutant loads from 
urban households by improving sewage treatment facilities, but it is not as easy to 
reduce non-point sources such as farmland. For this purpose, a total reduction 
method has been established that controls the total volumes of biological oxygen 
demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). 
 Thus, total pollutant load controls introduced for urban areas, industrial zones, 
and enclosed seas and lakes are designed with consideration of the regional environ-
mental space for air and water pollution, and can be effective in controlling the total 
amounts of emissions of pollutants generated by human activities. Figure  2.3 .
explains this concept of environmental space, where a region is represented by a 
tank that has a capacity to assimilate and self-clean pollutants and regenerate itself. 
Some portions of pollutants are released to the outside or removed by control tech-
nology. If the incoming load exceeds a certain limit, spillover of pollutants will 
cause environmental pollution. 
 2.2.7  Dispersion, Dilution, and the Environment’s 
Self-cleaning Capacity 
 To quantitatively assess the environmental space for polluting substances, research 
must be conducted using model-based computer simulations to scienti ﬁ cally ana-
lyze and assess a variety of processes involving polluting substances, which can 
 Fig. 2.3   Concept of environmental space 
 

23
2.2 Environmental Space
include dispersion, advection, dilution, chemical reactions in the environment, 
absorption in soil, bioaccumulation, bio-decomposition, and other mechanisms. 
 Nature does have the capacity to clean itself. The air pollutants emitted from 
smokestacks are carried away by the wind and air currents together with the smoke. 
Ef ﬂ uent discharged into rivers will be diluted by the currents if the  ﬂ ow volume is 
adequate. Organic waste such as human waste and kitchen waste will be decom-
posed by microbes in nature. When the scale of human activities was low, there 
were no major problems with simply  ﬂ ushing ef ﬂ uent into the environment, thanks 
to the self-cleaning capacity of nature, but there are limits to that capacity. All over 
Japan, large-scale industrial complexes were constructed along the seashores in 
some places, and as a result of the discharge of huge amounts of exhaust gases and 
wastewater into the environment, the environmental space was quickly exceeded 
locally in many cities and regions. 
 The water in Dokai Bay of Kitakyushu City is clean and catches of shrimp and 
 ﬁ sh are abundant today, but in the 1960s it was known as the “Sea of Death” 
(Fig.  2.4 ). Factory and household ef ﬂ uent turned the color of water in the harbor 
black, and it became a cocktail mix of various chemical substances. There were 
even stories that photographic  ﬁ lm could be developed simply by submerging it in 
this water. In Tokyo’s Tama River, large numbers of  ﬁ sh would frequently die off 
from the discharge of ef ﬂ uent of cyanide compounds and other toxic substances 
from metal plating factories upstream. Near Minamata City, the Ariake Sea was 
polluted from organic mercury discharged from a chemical factory, and local resi-
dents who ate contaminated  ﬁ sh became af ﬂ icted with Minamata disease. 
 Sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides and other air pollutants emitted from factories and 
automobiles are present in higher concentrations near the sources, raising concerns 
about health impacts on local residents. And that is not all. Pollutants dissolve into 
raindrops and mist in the atmosphere and are carried along by air currents. They can 
then be carried hundreds or thousands of kilometers from the original source and 
then fall as acid rain.

24
2 Operating Our Spaceship Earth
 Acid rain in direct contact with tree leaves can cause leaf wilt, and when it falls 
onto the soil there can also be impacts on the plants as a result of chemical reactions 
with soil constituents. Generally, the damage is less in alkaline soils such as lime-
stone, but in acidic soils the damage could include large die-offs of trees. During the 
1970s and 1980s, many lakes in Sweden and Finland became acidic and  ﬁ sh died 
off because of pollution carried on air currents from countries such as the United 
Kingdom and Germany. 
 In southern Germany, pollution from the industrial areas of the Ruhr region was 
transformed into acidic rain and mist, and many trees in forested areas known as the 
“Black Forest” died of the damage. The scene of trees dead and standing or dead 
and fallen all around was a strange sight to see; the words “death of the forest ( Walt 
sterben in German)” convey the general perception one could have there, and it trig-
gered the rise of environmental awareness and the development of new social move-
ments in Germany and other European countries. 
 The thing we can understand from these examples is that the de ﬁ nition and 
meaning of environmental space change with scales of time and space. If we take 
the example of air pollution in cities and industrial areas, from the perspective of 
protecting the health of local residents it is important to keep the pollution concen-
trations below a certain level in the vicinity of sources. In the case of acid rain, 
because the problems can occur thousands of kilometers from the source, it is nec-
essary to think on international and continental scales. In Europe, the Convention on 
Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution was concluded in 1979, and under the 
Helsinki Protocol in 1985, countries agreed to reduce their sulfur oxide emissions 
by at least 30%. This agreement later became a model for the Kyoto Protocol, 
intended to stop climate change by setting emission reduction targets for countries. 
 2.2.8  A Time Bomb Called Chemical Pollution 
 Discussions to this point have been based on assumptions about nature’s environ-
mental restorative capacity and self-cleaning capacity. Water bodies and soil that 
have been contaminated by toxic heavy metals and chemicals cannot be expected to 
clean themselves, however. 
 The mud at the bottom of Dokai Bay and Minamata Bay contained accumulated 
toxic substances. Because these would then dissolve into the water, the only solu-
tion to remove the contaminants was to dredge the mud. Furthermore, in the case of 
Minamata Bay, it was not suf ﬁ cient to dredge: the  ﬁ nal solution included the capsu-
lation of pollution in place by land- ﬁ lling 58 ha in the polluted bay. 
 Soil contamination from heavy metals and other chemical substances is often 
discovered at former factory sites. In such cases, it is necessary to carry in soil from 
other locations or to remove the contaminated soil. 
 The famous Tsukiji  ﬁ sh market in Tokyo has become too small for its needs, so 
plans have been devised to move it to Toyosu in Tokyo’s Koto Ward. When soil 
analysis was conducted at the planned new site, however, in May 2008  concentrations 

25
2.2 Environmental Space
of benzene, a hazardous substance, were detected at 43,000 times regulated stan-
dards. The cleaning of the contaminated soil will reportedly cost tens of billions of 
yen. Such soil contamination problems occur around the world. In past eras when 
less attention was given to chemical risks, toxic substances were often buried in the 
ground and ef ﬂ uent containing toxic substances was discharged onto the ground 
without much thought for the consequences. Besides such problems with former 
factory sites, there are also risks posed by laboratories and research institutes that 
may have used chemicals, radioisotopes, and hazardous substances. In the United 
States, there are reportedly thousands of such sites, but because of the lack of 
records, in many cases the pollution is discovered only after the soil is dug up for 
construction of new facilities on the sites. Such cases of chemicals being suddenly 
discovered are referred to as “chemical time bombs.” 
 If the area affected by the pollution is limited, cleaning may be possible to some 
extent, but total removal would be impossible. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) 
are one such example. PCBs were often used as insulators in electrical transformers, 
and were the substances that in 1968 caused the Kanemi Yusho disease, a case of 
poisoning from contaminated cooking oil from the Kanemi Company in Japan. 
Because these are extremely stable chemicals, they do not easily decompose, and 
can easily accumulate in the bodies of animals, particularly in fatty tissue, if they 
enter the food chain. High concentrations of PCBs have been detected in the bodies 
of Inuit people in Alaska. PCBs dissolved into seawater become concentrated in 
 ﬁ sh, then further concentrated at higher levels in the bodies of seals that eat the  ﬁ sh, 
and remain in the bodies of the people who eat the seals. 
 Similar problems occur with agrochemicals such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloro-
ethane (DDT) and benzene hexachloride (BHC). Common factors of these chemi-
cals are that they are persistent (do not easily decompose), are bioaccumulative, can 
travel great distances, and are toxic to human health and ecosystems. The general 
term for them is persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Because of concerns about 
POPs pollution on a global scale, the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic 
Pollutants was concluded between countries and entered into force in 2004. 
 2.2.9  Environmental Control on Spaceship Earth 
 In the past, the world was covered with a much greater area of forest than today. 
Humans increased their food production by converting the forested land to agricul-
tural land, allowing the human population to grow. The Industrial Revolution resulted 
in dramatic advances in science and technology and made possible the mass produc-
tion of products. The bene ﬁ ts extended also to agricultural production, where the 
large-scale use of fertilizers and pesticides, as well as the mechanization of agricul-
ture resulted in large increases in agricultural harvests per hectare. But humanity 
cannot completely monopolize the Earth for its own purposes. In recent years, the 
use of Earth observation satellites has allowed scientists to learn, little by little, about 
the conditions on Mars, Jupiter, and other planets in our solar system. Among the 

26
2 Operating Our Spaceship Earth
most astounding realizations are the  ﬁ ndings that human life on Earth is thanks to a 
miraculous combination of conditions that make it possible for us to live here. 
 The expansion of human activity is destroying the exquisite balance of the global 
environment. Thus, it must be the hand of humanity that corrects the disruption. It 
is to this end that the international community has decided to abolish the manufac-
turing and use of chloro ﬂ uorocarbons (Montreal Protocol) and to reduce the emis-
sions of greenhouse gases (Kyoto Protocol). These steps could be seen as none other 
than measures for environmental control on Spaceship Earth. If such measures fail, 
the fate of humanity may turn out similar to the fate of  ﬁ sh in a tank after the envi-
ronmental controls fail. Spaceship Earth is complex, however, and running it prop-
erly is much easier said than done.

 3.1  Water Planet: The Earth 
 3.1.1  Earth’s Atmosphere 
 In 1961, the former Soviet Union succeeded in launching the  ﬁ rst manned satellite 
into space. It was Yuri Gagarin, the cosmonaut on that spaceship, who commented 
that from space the Earth appeared blue, but what he actually said were poetic words 
to the effect that “The color of the Earth was a soft, pale blue, and its border with 
the endless black of space was a very gentle curve and beautiful.” When we hear 
“blue” we often associate it with the blue color of water, but the blue of the Earth as 
seen from space is actually the blue resulting from the diffusion of light through the 
atmosphere. This is the same reason the sky above us looks blue. 
 The Earth is wrapped in an atmosphere. The troposphere accounts for 80% of the 
mass of the atmosphere and extends 11 km above the surface of the Earth. If the 
Earth were compared to an egg, the atmosphere would actually be considerably 
thinner than the eggshell. This thin layer is also where we  ﬁ nd the oxygen that is so 
essential for our survival. The oceans and atmosphere absorb the energy from the 
sun, which drives an enormous circulation system consisting of the tide, ocean cur-
rents, wind, air currents, evaporation, and precipitation. It is this system that de ﬁ nes 
the existence of a multitude of living things on the Earth. 
 Today the amount of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) in the global atmosphere amounts to 
about three trillion tons. Every year about 25 billion tons are emitted from the con-
sumption of fossil fuels, and about half that amount remains in the atmosphere. If 
the current trend accelerates further, the concentrations of carbon dioxide in the 
atmosphere will double in the next 100 years, driving further global warming. 
The problem is the current extent and speed of growth of human activities in rela-
tionship to the size of the Earth  [ 1 ] .

 3.1.2  Water Circulation 
 The Earth is known as the water planet. Its oceans hold 13.7 × 10 18  tons of seawater. 
Every second, 4.20 million tons of water evaporate from ocean and land surfaces, and 
the same amount falls as precipitation. These  ﬁ gures give a sense of the scale of cycling 
of evaporated moisture and precipitation that is circulated by energy from the sun  [ 2 ] . 
 On the Earth today, ice sheets or glaciers are only present on the poles, as well as 
in high mountains in the Himalayas, the Alps, the Andes, and other very high moun-
tains, but in the past there were periods when the entire Earth was covered with ice 
and other times when there was none. 
 The 4.6-billion-year history of the Earth since the birth of the solar system is 
magni ﬁ cent. The story of geotectonic movement, volcanic activity, meteorites, the 
birth and evolution of life, and the ascent of  Homo sapiens is a fascinating one. 
There were periods when huge trees much thicker than those growing today grew 
on the Earth and gigantic dinosaurs  ﬂ ourished, and other times when the entire 
Earth was a snowball covered with ice a thousand meters thick, and times when 
many species went extinct  [ 3,  4 ] . 
 Today carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has a concentration of about 360 parts 
per million (ppm), but if this were to fall below 10 ppm, the Earth could become a 
snowball again. In the past, after being an ice ball, the Earth would warm up again 
and all the ice would melt. This behavior occurred because volcanic activity sup-
plied huge amounts of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The partial pressure of 
carbon dioxide is said to have been as high as 0.1 atm sometime in the past, an 
amount about 30 times the current level. 
 It is not only carbon dioxide but also other atmospheric constituents that have 
changed dramatically, including the amount of oxygen in the air. Changes such as 
these occurred over time spans of millions to hundreds of millions of years. 
The important concerns for us now are changes over the next 100 years or so—
roughly one human lifetime—but we are today facing the most dangerous levels of 
global warming in the past 10,000 years. 
 3.2  Global Climate 
 3.2.1  Global Warming in an Interglacial Period 
 During the 1970s, the majority of books on climate change were expounding the 
theory that the Earth would eventually enter a period of cooling. The Earth today is 
in an interglacial period, so it was assumed that eventually the planet would return 
to a glacial period. Some publications did touch upon the greenhouse effect caused 
by an atmospheric buildup of carbon dioxide and the potential for global warming, 
but the literature on this matter was very basic. It was only in the 1980s that scien-
tists became truly concerned among themselves with global warming. 

31
3.2 Global Climate
 The solar system and the Earth were formed about 4.6 billion years ago, and 
since that time the Earth has gone through many cycles of warming and cooling in 
its history. During the past several hundred million years, there have been repeated 
glacial periods on a cycle of between 40,000 and 100,000 years, and the most recent 
glacial period ended about 15,000 years ago. 
 A convincing explanation for the arrival of the cyclical glacial periods is that they 
are caused by cyclical variations in the Earth’s orbit around the sun: this is known 
as the Milankovitch theory  [ 5 ] . The point in the orbital path closest to the sun is 
known as the perihelion; it is at that point when the distance from sun to Earth is the 
shortest that the Earth becomes hotter. Furthermore, the orientation of the Earth’s 
rotational axis (or geographic axis) is not constant. Even a slight increase in the 
inclination of the axis will increase the amount of incoming solar energy to the 
poles, which will cause ice to melt, with implications for the global climate. 
 The theory that the Earth is currently in an interglacial period and that a glacial 
period will return someday is probably correct. The theory that the Earth will 
undergo warming from greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide emitted by 
anthropogenic sources is also correct. The global warming that the world is con-
cerned about today speci ﬁ cally means the rise in the average temperature of Earth’s 
atmosphere and oceans since the late nineteenth century, and this global warming is 
occurring during an interglacial period. If one thinks about it this way, many com-
mon misunderstandings will evaporate. 
 3.2.2  Time Scales: The Key to Understanding the Issues 
 The arrival of a glacial period is a phenomenon that occurs with a frequency of tens 
of thousands of years, but the increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide from anthro-
pogenic emissions is something that has been occurring in just the past 200 years or 
so. From this point forward, will the Earth warm up or cool down? To address this 
question, the concept of time scale is very important. For what period of time will 
the warming continue, and when will cooling begin again? It is dif ﬁ cult to predict 
these accurately, but one hint of an answer comes from examining the changes in the 
global climate after the end of the most recent glacial period. 
 The Earth from about 7,000 to 5,000 years ago was considerably warmer than it is 
today. There are various scienti ﬁ c terms to describe this period, including the climatic 
optimum (hypsithermal) period and thermal maximum  [  6  ] . During this period, the 
global average temperatures were between about 0.5 °C and 2 °C warmer than in the 
mid-twentieth century. The degree of warmth actually depended on the latitude, sea-
son, and location. Near the North Pole the average annual temperatures were more 
than 4°C warmer than today, while scientists believe that temperatures at mid- and 
lower latitudes, closer to the equator, were not much different from today. Evidently, 
Scandinavia and other locations in northwestern Europe were warmer, but conversely, 
southern Europe was even colder than today. These conclusions are drawn based on 
analysis of tree rings and of fossilized pollen stored in the ground layer.

 3.2.3  Jomon Marine Transgression 
 The early Jomon period in Japanese history lasted from about 6,000 to 5,000 years 
ago, and this period corresponded to the hypsithermal. The sea level at the time was 
4 or 5 m higher than it is today, and because the ocean came much further inland than 
today, it is referred to as the Jomon marine transgression (as imaged by Fig.  3.1 ). 
Evidence of this situation is provided by the discovery of ancient shell mounds in 
Saitama Prefecture and other locations inland, even 100 km distant from the present 
sea in Japan. Vegetation was also different. The land was covered with evergreens 
and broadleaf deciduous forests. At the Sannai-Maruyama site in what is now Aomori 
City (northern Japan), one can  ﬁ nd the 4,000–5,500 year-old remains of a Jomon 
period settlement, which shows signs that people tended many chestnut trees, a spe-
cies that normally grows in warmer regions. The site is on a hill located 3 km from 
the present-day coastline, but in those days the sea came right to the base of the hill.  
 Starting about 5,000 years ago, the Earth gradually began to cool. The warm 
region around Aomori eventually became cooler, making it unsuitable to grow 
chestnuts as a food for the people. The sea level gradually dropped and sandy 
beaches began to appear, but these changes would have posed dif ﬁ culties for 
 ﬁ shing. Until then, people could catch  ﬁ sh close to where they lived, but now 
they were forced to row out further offshore. At its peak in the early Jomon 
period, the human population on the Japanese archipelago is estimated to have 
exceeded 200,000 people, but it is estimated that the population dropped to less 
than 100,000 in the late Jomon period, from 3,000 to 2,300 years before the pres-
ent day. 
 After the hypsithermal, it appears there was a global cooling trend. This change 
apparently occurred over several thousand years. The change was not exactly as simple 
as that, however, as there were alternating warmer periods and colder periods on a cycle 
of several hundred years, which had enormous impacts on the emergence of civiliza-

tion and human history. One could say that these changes virtually created human 
history.  
 3.2.4  Medieval Warm Period and Recent Cooling 
 In Europe, during the Medieval Ages (about 800–1300  ad ), the climate was warmer, 
so it is known as the Medieval Warm Period. Conversely, the period 1400–1900  ad 
was cooler, so it is known as the Little Ice Age, or the modern Mini Ice Age. Reports 
by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and others have veri ﬁ ed 
the Medieval Warm Period and Mini Ice Age as fact in Europe, but they take the 
position that this conclusion cannot be applied worldwide. However, even if the 
warming was limited to Europe, the Medieval Warm Period and Mini Ice Age both 
lasted a few hundred years, which indicates that changes on time scales such as 
these do occur worldwide, or at least in certain regions  [ 7 ] . 
 The global climate is controlled not only by variations in the Earth’s orbital 
path and rotational axis and by changes in concentrations of greenhouse gases, 
but also by other factors, such as sunspot activity and material ejected from 
volcanic activity. Volcanoes can eject huge amounts of ash, and if this rises into 
the stratosphere and remains there for a while, the amount of sunlight reaching 
the Earth’s surface will decrease, resulting in a cooling of the climate. 
Furthermore, many times immemorial volcanic activity has emitted huge 
amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere from the Earth, contributing to 
warming. 
 One theory suggests that the modern Mini Ice Age was associated with volcanic 
eruptions. The Great Tenmei Famine occurred between 1782 and 1788 in Japan. 
At about this time, in 1783, two large volcanic eruptions occurred in Iceland, and in 
Japan, Mount Iwaki and Mount Asama also erupted. It is possible that these erup-
tions caused climate cooling and crop damage in the entire Northern Hemisphere, 
including Europe and Japan, and some theories postulate that these were the cause 
of the Great Tenmei Famine in Japan, mostly in the Tohoku (northeast) region of the 
country. Furthermore, in Europe, the climatic cooling may have been a factor con-
tributing to the French Revolution in 1789. 
 The Great Tenpo Famine occurred in Japan from 1835 to 1839 and the Great 
Irish Famine from 1845 to 1849. The Great Irish Famine was caused by a potato 
blight, and 1.5 million people may have died in Ireland from starvation or disease 
caused by malnutrition. Agricultural productivity at the time in Europe was low 
because of the cooling of the climate, but food shortages were mitigated somewhat 
thanks to potatoes, which would grow even in depleted soil. After this famine, 
European countries experienced skyrocketing prices of farm produce, and this was 
a major reason that motivated people to emigrate to the new continent of America. 
Viewed in this way, although the famine in Ireland may not have been directly trig-
gered by crop damage from the cooler temperatures, the cooler climate was cer-
tainly a contributing factor.

 3.3  The Advance of Global Warming 
 3.3.1  IPCC Fourth Assessment Report 
 It is virtually certain that the Earth will experience warming during the twenty- ﬁ rst cen-
tury. The cause is carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases emitted from human activ-
ities. Some still hold doubts about carbon dioxide as a major culprit causing the warming, 
but there is no question that the Earth’s temperature has been rising recently. 
 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has the mandate of 
gathering together the latest available scienti ﬁ c knowledge about global warming, 
and conducting analysis and assessments on response technologies and policies, as 
well as impacts of warming. It publishes “Assessment Reports” every 5 years or so, 
bringing together scienti ﬁ c knowledge from several thousand experts worldwide on 
the topic of global warming, and has signi ﬁ cant in ﬂ uence on international politics 
as well as national policies  [ 8– 11 ] . 
 The IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report, released in May 2007, stated clearly as a 
scienti ﬁ c fact that warming is under way, and concluded that human activities are 
the cause. Figure  3.2 shows the change in the atmospheric concentration of carbon 
dioxide, while Fig.  3.3 shows the results of analysis of changes in average surface 
temperatures worldwide, based on meteorological data collected continuously from 
various locations worldwide since the middle of the nineteenth century. To smooth 
out the large variations in annual data, a thick line is used to show changes in the 
5-year moving average. This approach levels out the annual variations, clearly 
showing a rising trend in temperature. Quantitatively, the surface temperature of the 
Earth rose by 0.74 °C (± 0.32 °C) over the 100 years from 1905 through 2005. 
 This  ﬁ gure shows that temperatures have been increasing since the 1980s, by 
about 0.5 °C over a 20-year period. It was during the 1980s that climate scholars 
began to seriously discuss the possibility of global warming from carbon dioxide 
and other gases. The IPCC was established in 1988. At  ﬁ rst, the scientists who pre-
dicted warming may not have been entirely con ﬁ dent in their predictions, but more 
recently the degree of certainty has been grown increasingly stronger as a result of 
the growing body of observational data. 
 A further warming of between 1 °C and 6 °C is being predicted for the next 
100 years. The actual amount of warming will be affected by the amount of carbon 
dioxide emissions, which in turn depends on the amount of fossil fuels used for 
human economic activities. Besides carbon dioxide, other powerful greenhouse 
gases include methane and chloro ﬂ uorocarbons and their atmospheric concentra-
tions are also a matter of great concern. 
 The gases covered by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change are carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), methane (CH 4 ), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), CFC alterna-
tives (i.e., hydro ﬂ uorocarbons, or HFCs, and per ﬂ uorocarbons, or PFCs), and sulfur 
hexa ﬂ uoride (SF6). Today the greenhouse effect caused by substances other than car-
bon dioxide is becoming stronger, but carbon dioxide still accounts for a little more 
than half of the total effect. The G8 Summit in 2008 agreed to seek international con-

35

sensus to reduce worldwide emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases 
by more than 50% by the year 2050. Although the United States had been dragging its 
feet, at last it too agreed on the need to take drastic action on climate change. 
 The global climate system could be compared to a large rock sitting on slope. At 
 ﬁ rst it is very dif ﬁ cult to move, but once it starts rolling, the motion becomes very

3 Understanding the Global Climate System
dif ﬁ cult to stop. If it starts to accelerate, it could roll down the hill with frightening 
speed. The continued melting of ice in places such as the Arctic and the Himalayas 
since the year 2000 is beginning to  ﬁ t this metaphor more than ever. 
 3.3.2  The Speed of Global Warming 
 There are two major problems with global warming. First, it is being caused by 
humans. Second, it is advancing quickly. Climate change in the past was a natural 
phenomenon, and all humans had to do was to adapt to it. Since the industrial revo-
lution, however, anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases have been growing 
at an accelerating rate, and it is humans that are causing the current problem of 
global warming. Humans are causing global warming through all their actions that 
consume energy—room heating, television viewing, computer use, and automobile 
transport. We know these facts today, but not enough people are willing to abandon 
their lifestyles of convenience and comfort. 
 As mentioned earlier, it was the 1980s when global warming from carbon dioxide 
and other greenhouse gases  ﬁ rst began to attract attention, and from then until the pres-
ent day, the global average temperatures have been rising noticeably. Changes in the 
Earth’s average temperature are affected by a variety of concurrent cycles lasting tens 
of thousands of years, thousands of years, and hundreds of years. During this present 
warming period, it appears that the warming effect caused by greenhouse gases is start-
ing to be expressed more strongly than the other factors that affect climate. 
 If human production and consumption activities continue to grow at the current 
pace, within roughly the next 50–100 years, basically between 2050 and 2100, the 
concentration of greenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere may rise to as much as 
two or three times the current level, which could cause warming to temperatures 
that exceed the warmest period that ever occurred in the past 10,000 years. In such 
a scenario, the global warming could occur extremely rapidly, on a short timescale 
of decades. This type of change would be at a rate that could be detected through an 
individual’s own observations and experiences during one human lifetime. 
This shift could mean that by the time people who are in their teens and twenties 
today reach old age, the winter temperatures in San Francisco would be as warm as 
they are in Los Angeles today, and the winters in Tokyo would be like Okinawa 
today. These are changes that people could clearly notice themselves. 
 3.3.3  Global Warming: Accelerating 
 Once a warming trend begins, the effects grow like a snowball. Global temperature 
increases are mitigated somewhat thanks to the re ﬂ ection of solar light back into space by 
the surface of ice and snow in places such as the Arctic, Antarctica, the Himalayas, and the 
Alps. As the ice is melted by rising temperatures, however, the land and sea surfaces that 
were previously covered by ice will be exposed, allowing solar heat to be absorbed and 
warming the land and sea surfaces, further accelerating the rate of melting. 

37
3.3 The Advance of Global Warming
 Indeed, since the beginning of this new century, the recession of glaciers in the 
Himalayas and Andes has been noticeable to the eye. The shrinking of the Arctic ice 
pack during the summer months has also been dramatically rapid. The author was 
raised in a part of Japan that typically had heavy snow in winter. When we did not 
have enough places to pile up the shoveled snow, we would spread dirt on top of the 
snow to melt it as quickly as possible. If a lot of rain fell, the runoff would also cre-
ate tunnels under the snow pile, which would increase the rate of melting. The same 
type of thing is happening with glaciers. If a glacier melts a little, streams form 
beneath it. If that happens, the glacier begins to slip forward more easily, and when 
pushed, will break loose from the ground below it. It is in this way that large chunks 
of glaciers in Antarctica are collapsing and falling into the sea. 
 The ocean plays an enormous role in regulating the global environment. Many 
of the pollutants from terrestrial sources end up in the oceans after being carried 
down rivers or being dissolved in rain. The environmental space of the oceans is 
enormous, but even so, it still is  ﬁ nite. About half the carbon dioxide emitted into 
the atmosphere from the combustion of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas 
is eventually absorbed by the oceans. A huge amount of carbon dioxide is dis-
solved by the oceans, but solubility drops as the water temperature rises, meaning 
that the capacity of the oceans to absorb carbon dioxide declines, with the result 
that the oceans will start to release large amounts of that same gas into the 
atmosphere. 
 Meanwhile, serious impacts also affect marine life when the oceans absorb more 
carbon dioxide. The rise of carbonate concentrations in the seawater could make 
certain marine regions more acidic. If that happens, the calcium carbonate shells of 
plankton and other basic creatures in the marine food chain will dissolve, causing 
impacts on marine life over vast regions of the oceans. 
 The death of coral caused by warmer water temperatures leads to another serious 
problem. If seawater temperatures rise above 30 °C, the  zooxanthellae (photosyn-
thesizing unicellular algae) that live in symbiosis with the coral will decline. Coral 
get their energy from the photosynthesis of these  zooxanthellae , and if warm tem-
peratures continue for too long, the coral will die. What may have been a colorful 
red and yellow reef will die and turn white—a phenomenon known as  coral bleach-
ing . Coral plays the important role of sequestering carbon dioxide into the oceans in 
the form of calcium carbonate, so the death of corals will reduce carbon sequestra-
tion and further accelerate warming. 
 What impact will warming have on the climates of regions around the world? 
The answer depends on the interactions of factors such as seasonal air pressure 
distribution, amount of sunlight, sea surface temperatures, and other factors, so 
precise predictions are dif ﬁ cult to make, but one major cause for concern is poten-
tial changes in precipitation patterns. Warming could increase the amount of 
evaporation from the sea surface, so total rainfall may increase, but there could be 
geographic and seasonal variations in rainfall distribution. Even though the rain-
fall may increase in the Asian monsoon region, the inland continental regions in 
Eurasia may receive less rainfall and become dry out. In addition, although giant 
typhoons and hurricanes could bring heavy rainfall during the rainy season, dry 

38
3 Understanding the Global Climate System
seasons may end up with absolutely no rainfall, and the dry seasons may last 
longer. 
 Right now, the Amazon and other areas are already rapidly losing their tropical 
rainforests, but global warming could further accelerate deserti ﬁ cation and the loss 
of forests. Furthermore, if the permafrost in Siberia and other cold regions warms 
up, the methane and other greenhouse gases now locked up in the frozen ground 
could be released into the atmosphere. 
 Clearly, warming has a variety of impacts on the global environment, and those 
impacts have feedback effects that will further accelerate the pace of warming. 
The further the warming trend continues, the more momentum it gains. 
 3.3.4  Large-Scale Ocean Circulation: The Great Ocean 
Conveyor Belt 
 Large-scale ocean circulation has an enormous impact on global climate. There are 
two types of circulation: wind-driven (powered by the wind), and thermohaline 
(affected by water temperature and salinity). It is the latter that has the greatest 
impact on the global climate. 
 Seawater is cooled in the cold polar regions of the planet whereas it is warmed 
near the equator. Cold saline seawater is dense and tends to sink down to deeper 
levels. Thus, in the North Atlantic and regions near the Antarctic, it sinks as deep as 
2,000 m below the surface, a process referred to as overturn. This water then circu-
lates the world as “deep water,” and rises again (upwelling) where it is warmed in 
tropical and subtropical regions (in the Paci ﬁ c Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, and Indian 
Ocean). The warmed seawater returns again as surface water to the place where it 
previously overturned and sinks again to become deep water. This current, referred 
to as the ocean conveyor belt, functions to carry solar energy absorbed in tropical 
and subtropical seas toward the poles (Fig.  3.4 ). This phenomenon explains why 
some regions of the world, such as the Scandinavian Peninsula on the continent 
adjacent to the North Atlantic region are comparatively warm despite their rela-
tively high latitudes. The rate of  ﬂ ow of the deep currents is very slow, taking about 
2,000 years for one complete cycle of the world’s oceans. 
 If Arctic ice continues melting, the freshwater will dilute the overturning seawa-
ter, reducing its salinity level. If that happens, the force of sinking will be weakened, 
and the motion of the conveyor belt will also be weakened. If this happens, the 
impacts on continental climates will be enormous. The ocean conveyor belt stopped 
numerous times during the Earth’s history, but if such a condition occurs, some 
regions of the planet may become colder even while the Earth’s overall temperature 
increases. Thus, it is possible that the climate will become colder in countries of 
Western Europe and the Scandinavian Peninsula and other places where it is rela-
tively warm for the latitude. Countries of the European Union have a good reason to 
be keen to take global warming countermeasures.

 3.4  How Can We Know the Future? 
 3.4.1  Future Predictions 
 Today, the average temperature of the Earth’s surface is steady at about 15 °C. These 
conditions have created a favorable environment for human life for many developed 
countries in the middle latitudes, including many European countries and Japan. 
However, if there is an increase in the amount of greenhouse gases such as carbon 
dioxide, which today accounts for only 0.036% of the atmosphere, the Earth will 
warm up. If humanity continues to carelessly burn fossil fuels such as oil and coal 
as it is doing now, the average temperature of the Earth in 100 years is likely to 
increase between 2 °C and 3 °C, according to conservative estimates, and poten-
tially by as much as 6 °C. 
 If the temperature rises by 6 °C, areas such as the American Midwest, which is 
now one of the “granaries of the world,” may turn into deserts, and countries in the 
lower latitudes near the equator will become unbearably hot. It is also possible 
that warmer climates in northern Canada, Siberia, and in northern Europe may 
make these regions more comfortable to live in, while the melting of Arctic ice 
may turn the Arctic Ocean into a strategic route for marine transportation. Not 
only that, in a few hundred years, sea levels are likely to rise 5 or 6 m above cur-
rent levels.

3 Understanding the Global Climate System
 3.4.2  Weather Forecasts and Global Warming Predictions 
 Discussions about the future of climate change are more about possible scenarios 
than about accurate predictions. Enormous progress has been made in research to 
recreate the global climate system by simulations using supercomputers, and the 
certainty and accuracy of predictions are steadily improving as more observational 
data come in. Nevertheless, it is extremely dif ﬁ cult to make completely accurate 
predictions. This situation is very similar to the problems relating to the daily 
weather forecast. Although the accuracy of weather forecasts has become very 
good, they still miss the mark quite often. Nevertheless, forecasts of the landfall of 
a typhoons or occurrence of a heavy rainstorm become more accurate immediately 
before the events, so it is always safer to take them seriously. People who try to 
interpret a forecast to their own liking and go about outdoors while ignoring an 
approaching storm are likely to run into trouble. 
 Global warming predictions today could be described as being at the level equiv-
alent to that at which we can identify the emergence of a tropical low pressure sys-
tem over the Paci ﬁ c Ocean and predict that it will develop into a large typhoon. We 
can imagine a number of scenarios for how big the typhoon will become and what 
path it may take, but we are not yet at the stage where we can accurately predict 
what is going to happen. Nevertheless, because there is a relatively high likelihood 
that it will develop into a super typhoon, and that it may directly strike the region 
you live in, you should take preparations seriously. You are free to hope that its path 
will miss you, but if you are complacent and simply count on being lucky, there is a 
strong chance that you will face some hardship. 
 At least one big difference exists between weather forecasts and climate change 
predictions: while weather forecasts are almost entirely about natural phenomena, 
climate change prediction is about phenomena that involve human causes. Climate 
change trends will be strongly determined by the impacts of the future actions of 
human society. This may be an extreme scenario, but if humanity were to immedi-
ately cut fossil fuel consumption by more than 90%, global warming caused by 
human factors would cease to be a problem. Furthermore, in contrast to short-range 
weather forecasts that predict the weather over the coming week, days, or hours, 
climate change predictions picture the next 50–100 years of the Earth’s future. 
 3.4.3  Attitudes About the Future 
 Humans have a tendency to believe that which is convenient for them and to avoid 
believing that which is not. We also tend to be driven by economic motives. If there 
were promise of big pro ﬁ ts, some people would tend to ignore even warnings of an 
approaching typhoon or storm. Even worse, if a government or industry believes 
that certain information may be “inconvenient,” they will sometimes actively sup-
press that information or distort it to their advantage. 

41
3.4 How Can We Know the Future?
 In her 1962 book, titled  Silent Spring , Rachel Carson, using the example of a 
spring when no birds sang, called attention to the risks of using the pesticide DDT 
and other chemical substances  [ 12 ] . The chemical industry attempted to counter her 
assertions by pouring enormous funds into research, and tried to convince the world 
that pesticides were not dangerous. She was not a scientist in this  ﬁ eld, and her argu-
ments did actually contain some scienti ﬁ c errors, so she had to  ﬁ ght hard to defend 
herself. Her work, however, elicited a huge response from the American public, and 
eventually the United States government had to change its pest control program. 
 During the 1970s, the world was alerted to the potential for chloro ﬂ uorocarbons 
to destroy the planet’s ozone layer, and the need for measures to stop their use 
became an international issue. Eventually, the manufacturing, use, and trade of 
chloro ﬂ uorocarbons became regulated under the Vienna Convention (1985) and 
Montreal Protocol (1987), although the path to get there was not easy. At the time, 
industries took a negative stance and opposed international regulations, claiming 
that the impacts of regulation on the economy and employment would be too high. 
 In 2007, former vice president of the United States and 2004 presidential con-
tender Al Gore was co-recipient, with the IPCC, of the Nobel Peace Prize for his 
contributions to the spread of awareness about global environmental issues. 
The title of his book was  An Inconvenient Truth  [ 13 ] . 
 In Japan, concern about global warming is extremely high, and this issue is cov-
ered extensively on television and in print and other media, but the tone of the media 
coverage here has been different from what the public has seen in most of the 
domestic media compiled in the United States. The Bush Administration (2000–
2008) held the view that global warming was still no more than an academic theory 
and rejected the idea that it was occurring. Thus, the response of Americans to 
global warming has been subdued. 
 The past 100 years of history have been  ﬁ lled with scienti ﬁ c and technological 
progress, major wars, and much change. If we re ﬂ ect upon the past, we realize how 
dif ﬁ cult it is to predict the distant future. Nevertheless, there is nothing more unset-
tling than trying to navigate the seas without a compass. It is exactly because 
Columbus believed in the existence of a new continent that he succeeded in crossing 
the ocean. Even though there is much uncertainty about the future of the global 
environment, it is essential that we share some common ideas about trends and our 
overall direction. The IPCC, established to deal with global warming issues, is 
intended to negotiate exactly those needs. 
 3.4.4  Model-Based Simulations 
 The purposes of simulations using models are to identify the various factors that 
drive and affect complex systems, to clarify the interrelationships among the fac-
tors, and then, by combining the factors in certain ways, to test the model and see 
how closely it recreates the real situation. The  ﬁ rst warning to the world from this 
type of research was  The Limits to Growth , published by the Club of Rome in 1971 

42
3 Understanding the Global Climate System
 [ 14 ] . Although the contents of this report attracted much criticism, it still deserves 
the highest praise for analyzing humanity’s activities and the Earth’s resources 
together as one system. 
 It is, of course, desirable that models recreate reality as accurately as possible, 
but there will always be limits to the number of variables and parameters that can be 
included in any analysis, even when using a powerful computer. The number of fac-
tors involved in real systems could almost be described as in ﬁ nite, In some cases, 
even small factors involved in a complex system could, through nonlinear effects, 
trigger huge changes in the system. 
 It is worth asking this hypothetical question: If a computer were created that 
could perform calculations thousands of times faster than today’s computers, would 
predictions be more accurate? In response, there are two problems involved here. 
The  ﬁ rst is the enormous number of factors that make up the global climate system. 
The second is the inherent complexity of the system. For simulations, the entire 
world surface is divided into grids, and the  ﬁ ner the divisions, the larger will be the 
number of unit cells. In addition, the oceans and atmosphere require vertical divi-
sions as well. Also the more precise the units of time used, the more numbers that 
will have to be processed. On top of this, it is also necessary to solve the equations 
numerically to determine variables such as the movement of air and water, as well 
as temperature, humidity, cloud formation and rainfalls. The computations will 
become monumentally large. This is the biggest challenge, but if computers make 
further dramatic advances, and we also obtain many more observational data, we 
will likely be able to overcome the technological hurdles someday. 
 The second problem, which is of a different nature, is that we are dealing with 
complex systems. We sometimes hear something like “if a butter ﬂ y  ﬂ aps its wings 
in Beijing, it will cause a hurricane in New York.” This concept originated from a 
meteorologist named Edward N. Lorenz, who noticed that if the values of input 
parameters were changed only slightly in familiar simple equations, the results 
could be dramatically different  [ 15 ] . This sensitivity can be true of nonlinear equa-
tions. If a system contains nonlinear equations, it becomes extremely dif ﬁ cult from 
the outset to predict outcomes, but if the outcome is dramatically affected by the 
value of an input parameter, it inherently becomes extremely dif ﬁ cult or even impos-
sible to make an accurate prediction. 
 Furthermore, human activities—economics and politics and the like—have the 
power to affect the amounts of greenhouse gases emitted. And even though humans 
do have the power to shape those activities, the reality is that the interests and ulte-
rior motives differ with each country and even with each person. As a result, people 
may not be able to control emissions as much as they wish they could. When con-
cerned with systems of this nature, it is critical to re ﬁ ne the data as much as possible 
to reproduce the actual conditions. At the same time, it is important to pay attention 
to the mechanisms and consider what factors interact to cause certain effects in the 
phenomenon being studied, and to seek approaches and insights into ways the sys-
tem should be managed.

 4.1  Biodiversity: Gifts of Nature 
 4.1.1  The Threat of Mass Extinction 
 Next to global warming, another major issue of this century is the crisis of biologi-
cal diversity. In fact, many biologists believe that a mass extinction of species is 
already underway  [ 1– 4 ] . 
 Within the next few decades, the habitat of many wild animals—chimpanzees, 
gorillas, orangutans, lions, tigers, elephants, rhinoceros, and so on—will be affected 
by further destruction of their wildlife habitat, and experts are concerned that within 
a few decades, these animals will only be able to live in the limited con ﬁ nes of pro-
tected areas and zoos. It is not only these large mammals that risk extinction, but a 
surprising number of other species as well  [ 5 ] . 
 About 1.75 million species have been discovered and named to date, although there 
are differences in the species de ﬁ nitions and classi ﬁ cation methods used by experts. 
Actually, an even greater number of species has not yet been discovered: some experts 
believe the total number of species may be 30 million or even 100 million  [ 6 ] . 
 Covering only 7% of the world’s land area, tropical forests are a treasure trove of 
life, providing habitat for more than half of all species. The tropical forests of 
Central America and Southeast Asia, in particular, are host to an extremely high 
number of species, earning the countries in these regions with so many endemic 
species the label of “megadiversity” countries. However, encroachment by human 
development is causing a rapid decrease of tropical forest area, triggering the extinc-
tion of many species  [ 7 ] . 
 According to the Red List of Threatened Species released by the International Union 
for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), as of 2008, there were 164,52,189 described 
species, and research into 44,838 of these species found that a total of 16,928 plant and 
animal species were endangered (Table  4.1 ). This number includes 1,141 species of 
mammals (21% of all described mammals) and 1,222 species of birds (12% of all 
described birds). Of these, 150 animal and 11 plant species are in Japan  [ 8,  9 ] .

4.1 Biodiversity: Gifts of Nature
 These numbers are only those species that have been discovered and described, 
but in addition to these, an enormous number has not yet even been discovered, of 
which many are going extinct before discovery—at an estimated rate of 50,000–
150,000 species per year. It is estimated from fossil analysis and other research 
that the background extinction rate is about 1 species going extinct per million 
species per year. If we assume the current number of species to be hundred mil-
lion, the background extinction rate would be about 100 species per year, so this 
means that the current rate of extinction is about 1,000 (between 500 and 1,500) 
times the background rate  [ 4 ] .  
 4.1.2  Biodiversity and Evolution 
 The term “biodiversity”  ﬁ rst appeared about 1985. It was coined from the term used 
until then, “biological diversity,” the idea that many living things are interacting to 
maintain the richness and balance of ecosystems. 
 It is useful to consider three levels—ecosystem, species, and genetic—when 
de ﬁ ning biodiversity. Diversity at the lowest genetic level, that is, genetic diversity, 
could be described as diversity within a species, from differences between individu-
als and differences between populations (Fig.  4.1 ). To take a human example, this 
would refer to the differences between individual people and also to differences 
between groups such as Japanese and Scandinavians. Even within a species, there 
may be different characteristics caused by genetic differences, such as in the shape 
and behavior of individuals. Diversity within a given species raises the chances of 
survival through adaptation, as a species, to environmental change. 
 Species diversity could be described as diversity among species, and relates to 
the existence of many species, as already mentioned. Ecosystems are created by the 
interactions among many species, and thus the extinction of species poses threats to 
ecosystems. 
 Ecosystem diversity is the diversity of a system created by the mutual interrela-
tionships of a variety of species. Even the same forest or coral reef will contain 
many differences resulting from location and environmental conditions, which is 
why there are so many diverse ecosystems on Earth. Ecosystems are composed of a 
balance among the many species they contain. Thus, if even only just one species is 
removed, the overall balance could suffer. 
 In response to changes in the global environment, at all levels—genetic, spe-
cies and ecosystem—life has gone through change as it  ﬂ ourishes, declines, and 
goes extinct—in other words, evolves. For example, in a cold environment, indi-
viduals adapted to the cold will have more chances to survive and pass on their 
cold-resistant DNA to offspring, so that DNA will  ﬂ ourish. On the other hand, 
some DNA will disappear. This dynamism woven together by genetic diversity at 
the individual level has ensured species and ecosystem diversity. Genetic diver-
sity, through the process of evolution, connects the past, the present, and the 
future of life systems.

 4.1.3  The Causes of Mass Extinctions 
 It is said that  ﬁ ve mass extinctions have occurred on the Earth, and this present one 
is being referred to by some as the sixth mass extinction  [ 3 ] . The most recent mass 
extinction event is famous for being the extinction of the dinosaurs 65 million years 
ago, at the end of the Cetaceous Period in geologic time. In contrast to the past mass 
extinctions, which are thought to have been caused by natural calamities such as 
crustal movement, volcanic activity, climate aberrances, and collisions with huge 
meteors, human activities are the main cause of the mass extinction currently under 
way, which is referred to as the Holocene extinction event. 
 Humans have a history of causing extinction of many species by placing pressure 
on other species through hunting and other activities. Today as well we continue to 
threaten other species by invading wildlife habitat as a part of “development” activi-
ties, and poaching animals for economic gain, for example, to obtain ivory and 
alligator skins. Conversely, the reduction of certain human activities that sustain-
ably maintained an ecosystem may result in the deterioration of that ecosystem. One 
example of this process is Japan’s  satoyama (coppice forests near villages), which 
once  ﬂ ourished but have fallen into disuse  [ 10 ] . 
 Ecosystems are vulnerable to climate change: warmer atmospheric temperatures 
are increasing the threat of species extinction. Japan is the home of diverse forest 
ecosystems, ranging from subtropical to subarctic forests, but if the average tempera-
ture rises by 3 °C over the next 100 years as a result of global warming, the current 
ecosystem distribution will have to migrate about 500 km to higher latitudes, or 
500 m higher in altitude. This  ﬁ gure means migrating at 50 km or 50 m per decade, 
a relatively rapid rate to which plants may not be able to adapt. The rise of atmo-
spheric and seawater temperatures has an especially large impact on mangroves, 
coral reefs, and alpine species, resulting in more species becoming going extinct. 
 Also, because of the destruction of the ozone layer, more harmful ultraviolet rays 
are reaching the Earth’s surface, and this is believed to be causing the rapid extinc-
tion of amphibians that are vulnerable to ultraviolet rays, such as salamanders and 
many species of frogs. Chemicals are also causing major problems. Killi ﬁ sh and 
water striders were often seen in creeks and streams of the Japanese countryside 
before the country’s period of rapid economic growth of the 1960s, but they became 
 Fig. 4.1   The three levels of

4.2 Free Beneﬁts: Ecosystem Functions and Services
a rare sight after the introduction of agricultural chemicals for modern farming. 
Large numbers of abnormal shell ﬁ sh with both male and female characteristics have 
been discovered, affected by manmade chemicals known as endocrine disruptors 
(also known as environmental hormones) in the environment, which raise concerns 
about the impacts of these chemicals on the reproduction of species  [ 11 ] . 
 Exotic species transported by humans into new areas have caused the destruction 
of endemic ecosystems in many places around the world. One example is in Japan’s 
Lake Biwa, where the endemic species of carp are plummeting in number as a result 
of the introduction of more aggressive and nonnative black bass  ﬁ sh. 
 4.1.4  Biodiversity: A Health Indicator for the Global 
Environment 
 The current state of biodiversity—facing mass extinction—is sounding a warning 
bell about human activities. Among the animals, the greatest concern about extinc-
tion is for amphibians, which are susceptible to the effects of endocrine disruptors 
as well as stronger ultraviolet rays as a result of ozone depletion. According to the 
IUCN (2008), 1,905 species of amphibians (30%) face extinction  [ 9 ] . 
 Amphibians are the  ﬁ rst animals that came onto the land from the oceans. They 
arrived on land 350 million years ago and survived three mass extinctions, but how 
will they be affected by the current crisis? 
 The term “climate canary” was coined in recent years  [ 12 ] . Miners in the past 
would carry canaries into coal mines to warn them of the presence of carbon monox-
ide and other harmful gases, as canaries are more sensitive than humans to toxic 
gases. That was the origin of the term “canary in a coal mine.” Thus, a climate canary 
would be an animal that is susceptible to the impacts of climate change. In that sense, 
frogs and other amphibians could be considered the “canaries of global warming.” 
 Humans are members of the global ecological system, and our survival depends on 
the existence of other species. As the mass extinction of species continues, will it be 
possible for humans to survive without any disruptions? It would be wiser to see the 
protection of biodiversity as something closely connected with the future security of 
humanity. Indeed, the state of not only the amphibians but biodiversity as a whole 
would be an excellent indicator of the health of the global environment. By maintain-
ing that health, we will be able to continue bene ﬁ ting from the gifts of nature.  
 4.2  Free Bene ﬁ ts: Ecosystem Functions and Services 
 4.2.1  The Value of Genetic Resources 
 Why is biodiversity so important? Although biologists and ecologists have a good 
basis to answer that question, there is also a strong answer from the perspective of 
economics  [ 13– 15 ] . 

50
4 Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service: Indicators of the Global Environment
 The most direct way to grasp the economic value of biodiversity is through the 
value of resources such as food and timber. The debate at this level is more about the 
value of species of rice, wheat, cedar, or cypress, for example, but even within a 
species there are special traits such as hardiness in certain environments, higher 
productivity or faster growth. The issue here is the value of individuals that carry the 
DNA for these traits, which really makes this an issue of the value of the DNA and 
leads to the commonly-used term “genetic resources.” 
 Recently, genetic resources have attracted special attention in connection with the 
development of pharmaceutical drugs. Since long ago, humans have used a variety of 
plants and animals for medicines, as is popularly known with Chinese traditional 
medicine. Today, however, in the development of new drugs there have been many 
cases in which researchers extract chemical substances from the plants and animals 
used by indigenous peoples around the world, investigate the medicinal effects, and 
then synthesize the substances arti ﬁ cially. A well-known example is the anti-malarial 
drug quinine, from a substance that was originally extracted from the bark of the cin-
chona tree and used as an anti-fever agent by indigenous people in South America. 
 A vast number of species in the world are not yet known to humanity, and many 
are thought to hold the clues to development of new medicines, but their careless 
harvesting and the impacts of human activities could lead to their extinction. 
Biodiversity is richest in tropical forests and such areas, for example, as China’s 
Quinhai and Yunnan provinces, and local indigenous people are becoming increas-
ingly opposed to the monopolization by Western pharmaceutical companies of the 
pro ﬁ ts arising from the development of drugs. Countries have con ﬂ icting interests 
when it comes to access to genetic resources. 
 4.2.2  Ecosystem Services: Gifts from the Environment 
 It is easy to appreciate the value of biodiversity as a resource, but besides that, 
humanity bene ﬁ ts in many ways from biodiversity in ways that we cannot see. 
Oxygen is created from plant photosynthesis, and the forests of Amazon and other 
places supply an enormous amount of oxygen to the atmosphere. Forests cover 70% 
of Japan’s land surface. They store in their roots and trunks a huge amount of the 
rain that falls on them, and they prevent  ﬂ oods and landslides. Forests also help to 
smooth out extremes of heat and cold, and create a comfortable climate. 
 Ecosystems are also for humans a source of scenic beauty as well as the other 
bene ﬁ ts such as spiritual calm, rest, recreation, and amenities. These types of func-
tions of ecosystems are known as ecological services, gifts of nature, and environ-
mental bene ﬁ ts. The loss of biodiversity reduces the functions of ecosystem 
necessary for all living things, as well as ecosystem services and the resilience of 
ecosystems to withstand environmental change. Our survival and well-being are 
dependent upon the ecosystem services we enjoy for free. Indeed, much research 
has attempted to calculate the monetary value of those services  [ 15 ] .

4.3 Protecting Biodiversity
 4.2.3  Biotechnology and Biomimicry 
 There is growing expectation for the development of biotechnology, such as the 
manufacturing of food and chemicals using living things, and technologies that use 
microbes to treat ef ﬂ uent and waste. 
 Similar to biotechnology is the concept of “biomimicry,” the development of 
new technologies by mimicking and obtaining hints from forms and functions found 
in nature. Biomimicry is an attempt to be in harmony with nature by copying natural 
systems as closely as possible. 
 Volkswagen produced the Beetle, nicknamed after an insect, but Mercedes-Benz 
recently revealed a concept car that imitates the plump shape of a box ﬁ sh swimming 
in the sea. Even though the car is shaped like a box, which gives it plenty of interior 
space, it has low wind resistance and excellent fuel ef ﬁ ciency. Hints about harmony 
with nature are hidden in the shapes of insects, birds,  ﬁ sh, and plants, and in this 
sense as well, there is value in biodiversity. 
 4.2.4  A Mirror of Human Society: Animal Society 
 We are learning more about ourselves by studying societies of other animals, includ-
ing not only primates such as the chimpanzee and gorilla, closely related to humans, 
but also a variety of other animals. Primate research is being conducted not only 
through observation at the behavioral and biological level but also the genetic level, 
and researchers have found the differences between primates and humans to be 
much less than originally thought. 
 The relationships between individuals in troops of the Japanese macaque 
(snow monkey) are rich with implications about human relationships. Thus, the 
protection of biodiversity is important also to allow us as humans to learn more 
about ourselves.  
 4.3  Protecting Biodiversity 
 4.3.1  Nature Protection and Biodiversity Conservation 
 Since the 1970s when the then-unfamiliar term biological diversity  ﬁ rst came into 
use, many different types of work that until then had been referred to as nature pro-
tection came together into the concept of biodiversity conservation. 
 It is worth noting the difference in the meaning of the words “preservation” 
and “conservation.” The former is closer to  protecting nature for nature itself , 
while the latter is closer to  protecting nature for humans . Conservation means 

52
4 Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service: Indicators of the Global Environment
preserving biodiversity so that humans may use it: protecting and using. Similar 
to giving a monetary value to ecosystem services, which allows us to incorpo-
rate that value into modern economics, the idea of conservation carries an 
anthropocentric concept that something should be protected because it can be 
useful for humans. On the other hand, protection is based on the stance that 
biodiversity has value in itself; stated more strongly, this means that all life has 
intrinsic value and should be protected, whether it be the species or the 
individual. 
 Just as indicated by these differences in the meaning of terms, acute con ﬂ icts 
often arise in the  ﬁ eld and in the world as the consequence of differing intent. 
 4.3.2  The Convention on Biodiversity 
 The Convention on Biological Diversity is a comprehensive international treaty on 
the conservation of biodiversity on a global scale. It was opened for signature at the 
Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, at the same time as the Framework 
Convention on Climate Change, and entered into force in 1993. The convention 
does not specify individual species or particular ecosystems. 
 The three objectives of the convention can be summed up as follows: (1) conser-
vation of biological diversity together with their habitats, (2) the sustainable use of 
its components, and (3) the fair and equitable sharing of bene ﬁ ts arising from the 
utilization of genetic resources. 
 The “together with their habitats” in the  ﬁ rst goal is an important point in this 
convention. The implication is that it is not enough to simply conserve species 
in protected areas and zoos. The convention clearly states that it is about the 
conservation of biodiversity and sustainable use. In addition, in its third objec-
tive the convention incorporates the views of developing countries, which 
strongly advocated for the sharing of the bene ﬁ ts of genetic resources, and rec-
ognizes the sovereign right of nations over their natural resources. Some devel-
oped countries are dissatis ﬁ ed with this aspect, as they want the free use of 
genetic resources from developing countries for their own biotechnology indus-
tries and genetic engineering. For this reason, just as with the Framework 
Convention on Climate Change, the United States has not yet rati ﬁ ed the 
Convention on Biodiversity (as of June 2012). 
 In addition to those already mentioned, other international agreements for the 
protection of nature are listed in Table  4.2 . The Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety 
(under the Convention on Biodiversity) was created to prevent possible negative 
impacts on the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity from “living 
modi ﬁ ed organisms” (LMOs)—organisms that have been modi ﬁ ed by modern bio-
technologies, including genetically modi ﬁ ed organisms.

 4.3.3  The Growing Importance of Biodiversity as Resource 
 When it comes to resources known as biodiversity, there are clear differences in the 
stances of developing countries, which have rich genetic resources, and developed 
countries, which are interested in using them. This is the basis of a confrontational 
framework between countries that have the resources and countries which have the 
technologies. 
 Although developing countries are host to rich genetic resources, until now in 
many cases only the developed countries bene ﬁ ted from them, so some developing 
countries assert that they have not received adequate compensation. Developing 
countries are aware that medicinal herbs and other materials have been used as 
genetic resources, and viewing this as “indigenous knowledge” or “local knowl-
edge,” they have begun to demand the protection of intellectual property rights of 
such knowledge more strongly than before.

 5.1  How Should We View the Changing World? 
 5.1.1  Laws of Change 
 Even though we may claim to have superior intelligence, humans are only one spe-
cies that happened to appear on this planet we call Earth, and we are not above the 
laws of evolution. With our powerful weapons of technology, however, we do have 
some capacity to dominate the environment. Nevertheless, that capacity is not all 
powerful. 
 It often happens that when we do something we believe will solve one problem, 
a negative outcome occurs through a chain of reactions. The dif ﬁ cult thing about 
discussing the effects of human behavior on the environment is predicting these 
chain reactions. The world we live in is made up of both orderly behavior on larger 
trends and random variability. One good example of this point is a comparison of 
changes in the global climate and the weather. Besides the changes over the four 
seasons, there are also changes in temperature from day to day, as well as changes 
within each day. Just when it seems that good weather has continued for a while, 
suddenly we may experience a severe storm or cold snap. There are also large waves 
of climate change that occur in cycles with timescales ranging from a few 100 years 
to tens of thousands or millions of years. 
 The climate system is a good example of a complex system that we also happen 
to experience in our daily lives  [ 1– 5 ] . Even though good weather may continue for 
some time, it is absolutely certain that the rain will fall again 1 day, although it is 
quite dif ﬁ cult to accurately predict when that day will come. In Japan we know that 
typhoons will occur when the season changes from summer to autumn each year, 
but it is very dif ﬁ cult to predict exactly when one will occur and which path it will 
take. Prediction is dif ﬁ cult for complex systems, but there are certain laws of change 
that they share in common, and we consider these now.

 5.1.2  Limits to Growth: Goats on a Deserted Island 
 With an abundance of food and an absence of predators, the number of individuals 
of a species will increase exponentially—this is true whether it be humans, wildlife, 
or microbes. In the real world, however, the amount of available food and space is 
limited, so the maximum number of individuals has a certain limit. In such cases, a 
logistic curve is helpful to explain changes in the numbers of individuals. With a 
logistic curve, the number of individuals grows exponentially when the number is 
small, but as the number increases, the growth rate declines and asymptotically 
approaches a limit. This curve resembles an elongated letter “S” tipped to one side 
and is commonly called the sigmoid curve (Fig.  5.1 )  [ 6,  7 ] . 
 Besides being applied to human populations, the logistic curve is also used for 
predicting annual sales of products such as automobiles, home appliances, and cell 
phones. In the case of television, the market was saturated when every household 
had a black-and-white television, but this was repeated again when each new prod-
uct came onto the market—such as the color television, the thin-screen television, 
and so on. Figure  5.2 shows several superimposed logistic curves. 
 An important point about the logistic curve is that as the number of individuals 
approaches saturation, the growth rate slows down. Here, the mechanism that causes 
this effect is a key factor. In the case of domesticated animals, things are  ﬁ ne if 
humans manage the numbers, but if left up to nature they are likely to eat until they 
run out of food. The Ogasawara Islands off the coast of Japan are a group of remote 
islands rich in biodiversity. People introduced goats to these islands for their meat, 
but some escaped into the wild and multiplied out of control. They ate plants right 
to their roots, pushing even rare plants to the brink of extinction. Efforts are now 
underway to exterminate the goat from the island. 
 In the case of manufactured products, if the market becomes saturated, there is 
no way to increase sales other than through the introduction of appealing new prod-
ucts attractive to consumers. Manufacturers that fail to properly manage such a situ-
ation could end up driving each other bankrupt through price wars. 
 5.1.3  The Lion or the Deer: Which Is Strongest? 
 We are told that dinosaurs once ruled the Earth. But what does it really mean to be 
the dominant species? Dinosaurs were the best adapted to the conditions of the 
global environment in that era. Species that are unable to adapt to major environ-
mental changes cannot avoid extinction, regardless of how they may have  ﬂ ourished 
previously. Environmental change could come from external factors of cataclysmic 
proportions, or they could come from mutual interactions between species. 
The former might include a collision with a large meteor, tectonic activity, volcanic 
eruptions, tsunamis,  ﬂ oods, and so on. Regarding species interactions, the example 
of the lion and the deer as a model in mathematical biology is ripe with meaning.

 If there is an abundant deer population, lions will prey upon them and multiply. 
If they do so, the lions will run out of deer to eat and start to die of starvation. 
Eventually, the deer will begin to multiply, and again the lions will begin to 
increase. Through such a framework, the number of lions and deer will increase 
and decrease repeatedly in what is known as a “limit cycle,” as illustrated in 
Fig.  5.3  [ 8,  9 ] .  
 This model is useful to understand phenomena in which two or more entities 
mutually interact. Similar cycles can be observed with the numbers of crimes and 
police, the spread of communicable diseases, and the supply and demand of prod-
ucts. If the number of crimes increases, the city increases the police force, but then 
crimes decrease, so the police force is reduced, in an ongoing cycle. Epidemics also 
behave this way. After large numbers of people have caught the disease and died a 
virus can  ﬁ nd no new hosts, so at one point the disease stops spreading, but later it 
begins to spread again. 
 The nuance of this model is that it is dif ﬁ cult to tell which is strong and which is 
weak—the lion or the deer. If too successful at hunting, the fate of the “strong” lion 
will actually be determined by the “weak” deer. 
 5.1.4  Paradigm Shift: From Caterpillar to Butter ﬂ y 
 In nature, besides changes in population numbers, there are also changes of state or 
phase. For example, water changes from solid state to liquid and then to gas in what 
is known as phase transitions. The transformation of a caterpillar into a chrysalis 
and then a butter ﬂ y is also a fascinating example of transformation (Fig.  5.4 ). 
 Fig. 5.3   Limit cycles of two species. The strong (e.g., the lion, a carnivore) and the weak (e.g., the 
deer, a herbivore) are actually mutually dependent. Their numbers go through oscillating cycles of 
 ﬂ ourishing and declining

5.2 Earth from the Thermodynamic Perspective
 In the human world there are transformations of political regimes (e.g., revolu-
tions, transfers of power by political parties) and economic systems (e.g., from 
socialism to a market economy). One feature of these transitions is the sudden 
change that occurs at the turning point. Major changes in governments as a result of 
elections are often referred to as paradigm shifts, as are revolutions of political 
systems. 
 Many phase transitions occur in the natural world. Examples include the phase 
changes from ice into water then water vapor, the magnetization of metal, and the 
superconductivity of liquid helium. When ice changes phase to become water, heat 
applied from an external source makes the water molecules move more rapidly by 
thermal motion. The binding between molecules weakens, and at a certain point, a 
transition occurs. In human society as well, there are cases when individuals in a 
group are together and associated, then suddenly separate. With environmental 
problems as well, it often happens that rapid changes occur in society when some-
thing suddenly triggers a wave of public attention on an issue in which people ini-
tially may have had no interest.

 5.2.1  Order, Disorder, and Entropy 
 In recent years, the term entropy has appeared often in debates about energy issues, 
resource recycling, life, ecosystems, and sustainability  [ 10,  11 ] . It is not a purpose 
of this chapter to expound on entropy at length, but there are a few valuable points 
to be made for this discussion. The concept of entropy can be useful to understand 
the core essence of certain economic and environmental problems  [ 12,  13 ] . 
To understand nature and human society, it is certainly useful to use the entropy 
concept, which originates from physics, but we must be aware that there are limits 
to its application for these issues. The term may give the impression of being pro-
found, but because it is certainly not easy to understand the concept correctly, there 
is a risk that people may fail to make a critical analysis.

5 An Evolutionary View of the Environment
 Explained in terms of statistical probability, entropy is a measure of the state of 
randomness. Go is an ancient strategic board game for two players, played with 
black and white stones. If there are two piles of Go stones, one pile white and the 
other black, a slight knock will make the piles collapse, mixing the two colors of 
stones. By an increase in the randomness of the system, entropy has increased. But 
no matter how long you wait, the mixed stones will not on their own separate them-
selves into black and white again. If there were only a few stones of each color, by 
coincidence they might separate that way, but if there were 100 or 1,000 of them, it 
would simply not occur. 
 The inside of a room tends to become messy, but a messy room will not create 
order on its own. Sugar water and salt water may mix, but there is no way that a 
mixed solution will separate itself again into sugar water and salt water. These are 
metaphors for the law of increasing entropy. An increase of entropy means that 
order over time transforms itself into a state of disorder. For example, an animal 
carcass or dead plant returns back to the soil, a product deteriorates and becomes 
waste and ends up in pieces—all these examples are in line with the law of increas-
ing entropy  [ 14,  15 ] . When ice melts to become water and water vaporizes, the 
bonding between water molecules weakens and randomness increases; these are 
phase transitions in the direction of greater entropy. 
 Because the explanation of entropy relates to resources and energy, we defer that 
discussion to Chap.   9 . It is important to note, however, that the explanation of Go 
pieces is simply an illustrative example, different from the thermodynamic entropy. 
Information entropy is also different from thermodynamic entropy. It is important to 
be aware that there are differences between entropy of physical quantities such as 
energy and temperature (thermodynamic entropy) and entropy as a metaphorical 
concept for states of randomness or disorder  [ 16 ] . 
 5.2.2  Steady-State Open Systems and the Earth 
 The foregoing is a rather dated discussion about entropy, describing a state of 
equilibrium in a closed system that has no external material exchange outside the 
system. In the latter half of the twentieth century, thermodynamics began to tar-
get open systems with external energy and material exchange in systems that 
were not in equilibrium—the  thermodynamics of irreversible processes . This 
breakthrough was the achievement of Ilya Prigogine, laureate for the Nobel Prize 
in Chemistry in 1977  [ 5 ] . 
 The theory developed by Prigogine and his co-workers de ﬁ ned the amount of 
entropy production and proposed that entropy production become minimal in a 
steady-state open system in a state of nonequilibrium. If a low gas  ﬂ ame heats water 
in a kettle, the heat from the gas  ﬂ ame reaches a balance with the heat escaping from 
the surface of the kettle, and the temperature becomes stable. If you put sawdust into 
the kettle at this point, you can see convection occurring in the kettle. Such a sys-
tem, maintaining a certain state (structure) while exchanging energy and material 

61
5.2 Earth from the Thermodynamic Perspective
with the environment, is called a steady-state open system  [ 1,  2 ] . Large-scale ocean 
circulation is also a steady-state open system on the Earth. The human body is also 
a steady-state open system that uses food as an energy source, maintains cell metab-
olism, and maintains body temperature at about 36°C through regulatory functions 
of perspiration and so on. The term “homeostasis” is used to describe the property 
of a system to regulates its internal environment and maintain a stable condition. 
 Living things constantly take in material from the outside world, metabolize it, 
and then emit waste back to the outside world: this is none other than a steady-state 
open system in nonequilibrium. Prigogine and his co-workers studied special cases 
of spatial patterns and cyclical phenomena for various systems, including material 
diffusion, thermal diffusion, chemical reactions, and electrochemical reactions. 
Their research did not reach the point of explaining complex things such as biologi-
cal phenomena, but their work was signi ﬁ cant for being extremely rich with impli-
cations for further thought. They gave us a glimmer of light to help understand life 
forms and ecosystems  [ 15,  16 ] . 
 5.2.3  Material Circulation and Entropy in Nature 
 Life creates order from disorder. Organisms, humans included, obtain the energy 
necessary to sustain life through physicochemical transformations to material taken 
in from external sources, and sustain that activity while creating new material. 
Starch when metabolized converts easily into carbon dioxide and water, resulting in 
an increase in entropy. The reverse reaction does not easily occur. Living things, 
however, accomplish this effortlessly. 
 Plants, through photosynthesis, create carbohydrates (sucrose, glucose, starch, 
etc.) from water and carbon dioxide in the air, and it is clear that they are reducing 
entropy—even if we just consider the process in which they select and take in 
sparsely distributed carbon dioxide molecules from the air. Animals, through chem-
ical reactions aided by a variety of enzymes, are able to digest food, synthesize 
proteins, and perform work through their muscles. Life forms maintain the order in 
their own selves, going against the law of increasing entropy by the workings of 
vitamins, hormones, enzymes and other chemicals, incorporating complex genetic 
information, and so on. 
 To sustain their lives, living things synthesize complex chemicals (starch, sugars, 
amino acids, proteins, enzymes, vitamins, etc.) from simply structured molecules 
such as CO 2 and H 2 O, create living tissue, and keep their internal systems function-
ing. All this is nothing short of truly amazing. These workings of living things cre-
ate internal programs that seem to be designed for the very purpose of sustaining the 
organism’s own life and are engaged in self-organization to achieve that purpose. 
This capability of living organisms is the capacity to create order, which functions 
to decrease entropy. 
 This function of life to reduce entropy may seem to contradict the second law of 
thermodynamics which states that entropy in the universe increases over time, but 

62
5 An Evolutionary View of the Environment
that law applies to closed systems, which have no exchange of energy or material 
with the outside world. In contrast, the Earth is an open system that receives solar 
energy from outside. It is thanks to solar energy that plants can reduce entropy 
through photosynthesis. 
 The foregoing discussion is about biological functions at the cellular or indi-
vidual level, but it is worth noting that all living things on Earth together make 
up an ecological system. Within this ecological system, living things both eat and 
are eaten, and material circulates within this cycle of the food chain. Within this 
material circulation, it is essential to have both primary producers that conduct 
photosynthesis and decomposers which decompose organic matter such as ani-
mal waste and carcasses. 
 Material circulation on the global ecological system could be broadly described 
as being composed of the functions of both primary producers that reduce entropy 
and decomposers which increase entropy. Although solar energy is necessary for 
the basic producers, heat is generated in the decomposition processes: this heat is 
emitted into space through atmospheric circulation. 
 5.2.4  Human Activity and Entropy 
 A child was handed a bottle containing a mixture of sugar and salt and ordered to 
separate the sugar and salt before the next morning, but an army of ants came along 
and helped by separating out only the sugar. This is from a children’s story the 
author heard once, but let us examine it more closely. A mixture of sugar and salt is 
in a high state of entropy, but if sugar is only with sugar and salt only with salt, the 
situation is in a low state of entropy. Seen this way, the task for the ants in the story 
was to work hard to reduce the entropy of the mixture. 
 Bees  ﬂ y all day from  ﬂ ower to  ﬂ ower, collecting nectar to produce honey. We are 
told that bees need millions of  ﬂ ights to produce 1 kg of honey. In the city of Nagoya, 
with a population of 2.2 million people, garbage is collected twice a week. It is 
labor-intensive work to collect thousands of bags each round. A mixed pile of black 
Go stones and white Go stones can also be sorted through the work of humans. If 
we see the task of collecting and sorting scattered items as actually reducing entropy, 
then human labor or physical work can be seen as providing energy and at the same 
time reducing entropy. In this kind of debate, the concept of entropy is useful, but as 
stated earlier, entropy here differs from the entropy of thermodynamics. 
Thermodynamic entropy is related to the randomness of positions and velocities of 
an astronomical number of atoms and molecules—a number of the order of the 
Avogadro constant (6 × 10 23 ). Sugar and salt grains, when in solid state, are big 
enough to be seen by using a magnifying glass, and in one view there might be 
somewhere of the order of about 1,000 visible grains. In this case, even if sugar 
 grains are mixed with salt  grains , there is little change in thermodynamic entropy. 
If  solutions of salt and sugar are mixed, however, there is a change in the entropy, 
because this is a mixture at the molecular level. In the case of a mixture of black and 

63
5.2 Earth from the Thermodynamic Perspective
white Go pieces, the difference in black and white color is not a difference in phys-
ico-chemical properties; in this case, the entropy of this mixture would be best seen 
as information entropy. 
 That was somewhat of a digression, but even though those examples differ from 
thermodynamic entropy, the concept of entropy is useful when considering the 
degree of randomness and order in a system. In the various systems with which we 
are concerned, it is a statistical and probabilistic reality that there is a tendency to go 
from order to disorder, whereas living things—at both the molecular and the macro 
level—act to create order from disorder and randomness. 
 5.2.5  Environmental Issues and Entropy 
 When we consider environmental issues from the perspective of entropy, we must 
look at the metabolisms of material transformation behind environmental phenom-
ena, and the accompanying transfers of energy and heat. There are three major top-
ics to consider here. 
 First is the issue of ef ﬁ ciency of energy use. The use of energy—whether it be 
fossil fuel, nuclear power, or whatever—inevitably generates heat, but there are lim-
its to the amount of heat that can be used effectively. A vast amount of energy is 
present in the environment in the form of heat, but there are constraints on how it can 
be used effectively. On that point, energy consists of “usable energy” and “unusable 
energy”, and an “increase of entropy” is a “decrease of the amount of usable energy” 
or an “increase of the amount of unusable energy.” In other words, this is a “deterio-
ration in the quality of energy.” These points are discussed again in Chap.   9 . 
 The second topic is the issue of resource recycling as an issue of deterioration in 
the quality of resources. The process of extracting ore from the below the ground 
and re ﬁ ning it into high-purity metals means transforming entropy from a high state 
to a low state. Mixing used resources means increasing the entropy that someone 
had gone to the trouble of reducing. The emission of chemical substances into 
the environment is also a behavior that increases entropy. Diffusion of pollutants in 
the environment and mixing of used resources are the changes that increase entropy, 
and we may de ﬁ ne a low entropy state as a desirable condition  [ 11 ] . The result 
might be a value system with a preference for behavior that does not increase 
entropy. This example is just one possible type of value system; in itself, entropy 
has no ethical signi ﬁ cance. 
 The third topic to consider is the dynamics of the global ecological system—
including biological systems, through the prism of entropy theory. This discussion 
is based on thermodynamics in a steady-state open system, as described above. 
Discussions in entropy economics are wide ranging, but some thinkers assert that 
the energy use and material circulation under current models of industrial produc-
tion are not compatible with the global ecosystem that sustains life; in other words, 
not in harmony with the natural world’s inherent functions and capacity relating to 
material circulation. If we were to take this argument further, the ultimate model for 

64
5 An Evolutionary View of the Environment
a society with sound material cycles would be something like Edo-period Japan, for 
example, as its economy was based upon agriculture, forestry, and  ﬁ sheries activi-
ties that were compatible with material circulation in the natural world. Many 
con ﬂ icting opinions can be expressed on these topics, but it is certainly worthwhile 
to consider the perspective of thermodynamics when analyzing the life-supporting 
structure of the global ecosystem. 
 5.2.6  The Earth as a Heat Engine 
 The temperature near the equator on the surface of the moon rises to 120°C in the 
lunar afternoon and drops to minus 70°C at night. This is a huge daily variation. 
This temperature variation is repeated every day (1 lunar day is equivalent to 
1 month on Earth). The Earth also has temperature variations between day and 
night, but these are not as extreme as on the moon. The reason for the Earth’s more 
moderate temperature changes is that it has both atmospheric and water 
circulation. 
 On the moon, the incoming energy from the sun heats the moon’s surface, and 
then escapes from the heated moon surface directly into space. In contrast, about 
30% of the energy coming to the Earth escapes back into space by re ﬂ ection from 
surfaces including snow and ice cover and clouds, but the remaining energy warms 
the Earth’s surface, atmosphere, and water, which then drive atmospheric convec-
tion and water evaporation. 
 This atmospheric circulation on the Earth resembles the operation of a heat 
engine. Air conditioners collect heat inside a room and release it outside by using an 
electrical compressor to repeat a cycle of compressing and liquefying a refrigerant 
and then expanding and vaporizing it again. The Earth, similarly, releases heat from 
its surface into space, through cycles of water evaporation and precipitation. 
Air warmed at the Earth’s surface rises, but as it rises, the temperature of the air 
drops by adiabatic expansion. The air that has cooled at a higher altitude sinks 
because it is heavy, whereas the temperature of the air rises in response to adiabatic 
compression. The warming of a strong wind as it blows down a mountain is exactly 
the same, known as the Foehn phenomenon. 
 If we look only at the balance of energy entering and leaving the Earth, the law 
of energy conservation (the  ﬁ rst law of thermodynamics) is preserved. On this point, 
everything is the same as on the moon. It is not possible, however, for life to exist 
under such extreme temperature variations as on the moon. What differs from the 
moon is that the energy the Earth receives from the sun is transformed into thermal 
energy in the air and water, and the circulation of atmosphere and water thereby 
maintains a relatively constant air temperature. Furthermore, solar energy is used by 
plants in photosynthesis and linked with material circulation in ecosystems through 
the food chain. This description shows that to understand the dynamics of the global 
ecosystem, it is necessary to use concepts of thermodynamics in a steady-state open 
system. Entropy increases because of the steady generation of waste from life 

65
5.2 Earth from the Thermodynamic Perspective
 processes in the global ecosystem. By transferring energy from the Earth into space, 
the internal buildup of entropy is prevented and material circulation is established. 
This line of thought offers new insight to understanding the global ecosystem 
 Despite recent progress, the  ﬁ eld of thermodynamics for open steady-state sys-
tems is still in the process of development, so many inferences and analogies are 
still needed for us to understand the global ecosystem. There is no doubt that human 
activities are causing enormous impacts on and changes to the global ecosystem and 
material circulation, but there are still no answers about how much of this can be 
tolerated, and it is unclear how far entropy theory can go beyond general discus-
sions to provide quantitative answers. 
 5.2.7  Is Global Warming Real?: The Role of Water 
and Water Vapor 
 It is a fact that average global temperatures have been rising, based on 150 years of 
data. Some debate still remains, however, as to whether the warming is happening 
because of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and whether the warming trend will 
continue. Let us consider these issues brie ﬂ y here. 
 The reason you feel heat when you hold your hand near a charcoal  ﬁ re is that 
heat is radiated from the charcoal  ﬁ re, but this heat is actually electromagnetic radi-
ation. Sunlight also feels warm because it is electromagnetic radiation from the sun. 
But even though both are electromagnetic waves, the electromagnetic radiation 
emitted from high-temperature bodies such as the sun has a relatively larger compo-
nent of short wavelengths, whereas the radiation from a low-temperature body has 
a relatively larger component of long wavelengths. 
 A charcoal  ﬁ re, when fanned, will burn more strongly and the  ﬂ ame color will 
turn from red to orange. In the late 1800s the German steel industry was  ﬂ ourishing 
as a result of the Industrial Revolution. The color and temperature of industrial blast 
furnaces was therefore an important technical matter, so researchers began to study 
the relationship between temperature and the wavelength spectrum of electromag-
netic waves emitted from heated objects. It was Max Planck who reached some 
conclusions and developed the famous formula now known as Planck’s law. It is 
well-known that his work led to the birth of quantum mechanics at the beginning of 
the twentieth century. 
 Planck’s law tells us that most of the light coming from the sun, with an abso-
lute surface temperature of radiation of 6,000 K contains electromagnetic radia-
tion with a wavelength of about 0.5  m m, whereas a body at about human body 
temperature (absolute temperature about 300 K) contains mostly infrared radia-
tion at a wavelength of about 10  m m. The star Sirius is bluish in color, and this is 
because it is hotter than our sun and its radiation contains a larger component of 
shorter wavelengths. Infrared rays are emitted from the Earth’s land and sea sur-
faces that have been warmed by incoming energy from the sun, but greenhouse 
gases such as carbon dioxide have properties by which they absorb this infrared 

66
5 An Evolutionary View of the Environment
radiation. The absorbed energy is converted into kinetic energy in molecules of 
carbon dioxide and other gases, and this warms the air. In the end, however, the 
heat accumulated in the air ultimately escapes to space from the upper limits of 
the atmosphere. Whether or not greenhouse gases are present, the total amount of 
energy that enters the Earth’s atmosphere from the sun and the total amount of 
energy that escapes into space from the Earth’s atmosphere are the same. This 
situation closely resembles the steady state mentioned earlier when heating a ket-
tle of water with a low gas  ﬂ ame. 
 The greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide is also similar to a person wear-
ing clothes for protection from the cold. It is thanks to the “clothing” of greenhouse 
gases that the atmosphere is maintained at temperatures comfortable enough for 
humans to live in, but if we wear heavy clothing, we will become hot and start to 
perspire. At this point, it is important to mention the functions of water and moisture 
relating to the global climate. Actually, water vapor (H 2 O) causes a greenhouse 
effect exactly as do carbon dioxide and methane, and in fact water vapor is more 
potent than these gases are and accounts for more than 60% of the greenhouse effect 
in the global climate. Furthermore, water plays a major role in the global climate in 
many other ways—through snow and ice cover, the evaporation of water, cloud 
formation, precipitation, large-scale ocean circulation, and so on. Snow and ice 
cover directly re ﬂ ect solar rays and prevent the Earth from warming up, water evap-
oration plays the role of carrying heat from near the Earth’s surface up into the 
atmosphere, and an increase of cloud cover would prevent solar radiation from 
reaching the Earth’s surface. 
 But even though water vapor has a strong greenhouse effect, the reason that it has 
not attracted much attention as a major cause of the currently observed warming is 
that, unlike other greenhouse gases, it is not the result of anthropogenic emissions. 
On the other hand, the atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and 
other gases are rising along with the level of human activities, so their emission 
trends and warming trends are correlated. These are the reasons that those gases are 
seen as the causes of warming. 
 If we look closely, there is certainly some room to challenge the decision to 
blame global warming on anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide and other 
gases, but we must not forget that if the planet warms up and the amount of 
evaporation increases, snow and ice cover will decline and the warming will 
accelerate further. 
 In contrast to warming, factors that cause global climate to cool include volcanic 
eruptions and air pollution. There have been times in history when volcanic ashes 
have remained in the atmosphere for some time, blocking the sun’s rays and causing 
climate cooling to occur. Similarly, particulate matter (aerosols) from coal burning 
has a cooling effect on the climate, as is also true of an increase in cloud cover. 
 Climate change has occurred in the past without anthropogenic causes, and some 
factors other than anthropogenic ones—water and water vapor, for example—may 
be having a major effect on the warming currently underway. Nevertheless, humans 
are also causing other changes in hydrological cycles, through forest logging, water 
resource exploitation, and modifying the Earth’s surface with cities and roads. 

67
5.2 Earth from the Thermodynamic Perspective
Global warming is something that must be considered not simply in terms of the 
emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases but in the context of the whole range of 
human activities. 
 5.2.8  Forests and Seas 
 The discussion jumps a bit here, but let us now consider another example of material 
circulation in the natural world. 
 In 1988,  ﬁ shers along the Nishibetsu River in eastern Hokkaido launched a 
tree-planting campaign to increase the number of  ﬁ sh, and this movement has 
now spread nationwide in Japan. But why is it  ﬁ shermen who are planting trees? 
In the past,  ﬁ shers were able to catch many salmon in this river, but the  ﬁ sh popu-
lation had plummeted. It occurred to them that the reason for the decline was that 
forests in riparian zones and other areas had been lost because of land develop-
ment for dairy farms. 
 In the living world, material circulation works through the food chain. Various 
nutrients are needed for organisms to grow, and these nutrients are absorbed from 
the soil by plant roots, circulate through many living things via the food chain, and 
again are returned to the soil after being decomposed by microorganisms in the soil. 
Because rain falls onto the land, however, many nutrients are washed from the soil 
into rivers and carried to the sea. If this continues for a long time, the soil must 
eventually be depleted of nutrients. This does not occur, however, because of a 
reverse  ﬂ ow of nutrients. For example, seabirds catch and eat  ﬁ sh, and the nutrients 
are carried by bird droppings from the sea back to the land. Salmon and trout swim 
back up rivers to spawn, after which their carcasses also return nutrients to the land. 
Nutrient cycles such as these sustain biological phenomena on Earth. 
 The human practice of taking  ﬁ sh such as sardines and herring and using them as 
fertilizer is also based on the notion of returning nutrients from the ocean to the 
land. The use of chemical fertilizers leads to nutrients being washed out to sea, 
causing eutrophication and problems such as algal blooms, which occurs because 
the natural nutrient cycle has been disrupted. Marine ecosystems need primary pro-
ducers that grow through photosynthesis, such as phytoplankton,  wakame, and kelp 
seaweed. To grow, they need nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen, but they 
cannot absorb those elements unless they also have iron present. The iron that organ-
isms can absorb must be in the form of ferric ions; if the iron is in the form of iron 
oxide they cannot absorb it. 
 In a thick forest, so much humus accumulates on the forest  ﬂ oor that oxygen can-
not reach it. Here the fallen leaves are decomposed by bacteria and other organisms, 
producing organic matter. This organic matter reacts and interacts with a variety of 
other materials, forming fulvic acid, which is water soluble. This fulvic acid and the 
associated fulvic acid iron are soluble in water, without becoming iron oxides. This 
fulvic acid iron  ﬂ ows in the river out to the sea and is involved in biological produc-
tion in the sea water. 

68
5 An Evolutionary View of the Environment
 The tree-planting activities in Japan, mentioned above, are actually working to 
restore the nutrient cycle as a part of the material circulation that is so important for 
the global ecosystem. This is an example of the forests sustaining the oceans. 
 5.2.9  Humans: Small Size, Big Impact 
 The global ecological system is a complex system created through interactions 
between a constantly-changing climate and biodiversity. By the ways in which they 
adapt to these changes, other changes occur at the genetic level, by which the special 
characteristics of life forms either develop or disappear, with the result being evolu-
tion. There is neither good nor bad in evolution caused by the forces of the natural 
world, but human activities are having enormous impacts on the processes of evolu-
tion. We must be reminded, however, of the metaphor of the lions, which may seem 
to be dominant but will die out if they eat all the deer upon which they prey. 
 We do not know if we humans will end up as a  ﬂ eeting presence on a page in the 
history of evolution in the global ecological system, but we are a dangerous pres-
ence that is risking a destructive knockout blow to the other species that make up the 
biological diversity sharing Spaceship Earth with us. It is extremely dif ﬁ cult to pre-
dict the future of the Earth, which bears the features of a complex system. In fact it 
is truly impossible to predict. As with the Earth’s climate, it is certain that warm and 
cold periods will continue to come and go, but long-term cycles last millions or 
hundreds of thousands of years and short-term cycles last hundreds of years, mak-
ing it dif ﬁ cult to accurately predict the effects of interactions between the rhythms 
of nature and the impacts of human behavior. Nevertheless, it appears certain that, 
whatever the cause, the Earth will become warmer during the twenty- ﬁ rst century. 
 Can it be that only humans, with their advanced intelligence, can be completely 
free from the laws of evolution? Is the very existence of humans with our capabili-
ties and traits the inevitable product of evolution? Or is this all just coincidence? 
These are interesting questions to ponder.

 6.1  Earth History, Human History 
 6.1.1  An Instant in Time 
 When our human ancestors still lived only in Africa, the population was apparently 
only about 100,000. This  ﬁ gure is estimated from current numbers of chimpanzees 
and other anthropoid apes. Ten thousand years ago, when the Earth began to warm 
up at the end of the last Ice Age, humans adapted to the changing global environ-
ment and began to engage in settled cultivation. Five thousand to six thousand years 
before the present day, humans began to live together in settlements and urban civi-
lizations developed in the basins of the Nile and Yellow Rivers. In ancient Egypt 
and the Xia, Yin, and Shang dynasties in China, populations grew to a few million 
people, and the world’s total human population is estimated to have exceeded ten 
million. At their peaks about 2000 years ago, the populations of the Roman Empire 
 [ 1 ] and the Han Empire both exceeded 50 million, and the estimated total world 
population was 200–300 million, including large populations in what are now India 
and Mexico. The human population  ﬁ rst exceeded one billion in about 1800. 
In 2012, our population exceeded seven billion. 
 Humans dominate the Earth today. But it was only 250 years ago, after the Industrial 
Revolution, that we were  ﬁ rst able to exert such control through our science and tech-
nology. A scant 10,000 years have passed since humans  ﬁ rst began settled cultivation. 
Will the modern civilization that we currently take for granted turn out to be nothing 
but the momentary blossoming of a  ﬂ ower in the long history of the Earth?  
 6.1.2  Economy and Ecology 
 In recent years, the term “eco” has come into common use as an alternative for 
“environment.” Its recent use comes from the English word “ecology.” “Economics”

also begins with the same “eco.” The origin of “eco” is the ancient Greek word 
 oikos , which originally meant household, house, or family. How could it be that 
both “economy” and “ecology” come from the same roots? 
 Modern society has corporations and a great variety of other organizational 
structures, but in ancient Greece, where farming and raising livestock were the 
core productive activities, the  oikos  (family) was the basic unit of society. Families 
had a master, family members, and slaves, and possessed a certain amount of 
farmland and grazing land. They were almost completely self-suf ﬁ cient, running 
on solar energy  [  2 ] . The size of the grain harvest and number of animals were 
determined by factors such as the amount of land owned, amount of sunshine, 
temperature, and rainfall. 
 Imagining the situation of families in ancient Greece, we can understand now 
how both economy and ecology can have the same origin. Economy had to do with 
managing the family on the earnings from farm produce harvested and sold. The 
word “economics” has similar origins, associated with the home economics of 
managing the family income and expenditures. On the other hand, “ecology” was 
concerned with the natural conditions that determined how much income could be 
earned, including the size of crops to plant and how many livestock to raise.  
 6.1.3  Closed Economy, Open Economy 
 An economy based on agriculture and livestock and mostly affected by the blessings 
of the heavens and earth is what economist Kenneth E. Boulding referred to as a 
closed economy  [ 3 ] . This is an economy that operates within relatively small 
regional con ﬁ nes and does not engage in much interregional trade. In ancient 
Greece, all necessities—clothing, food, housing, etc.—were obtained from the 
 harvests from nature, and all waste had to return to nature. During that era, economy 
and ecology were basically the same thing. 
 The separation of the two “ecos” came with the birth of the modern industrial 
civilization, as a result of the Industrial Revolution at the end of the eighteenth cen-
tury. Motive power before the Industrial Revolution came from human and animal 
power. The fastest transport was the speed of a horse running. After the Industrial 
Revolution, humanity had at its disposal unprecedented power and speed, through 
the use of steam engines and, eventually, internal combustion engines. As a result, 
humanity was able to excavate and exploit on a vast scale buried resources such as 
fossil fuels, metals, and minerals, and to use them as if their supply was endless. 
This was the beginning of the “open economy,” or cowboy economy, as Boulding 
called it. Eventually, huge amounts of commodities could be carried enormous 
 distances, by rail, ship, automobile, or airplane. 
 It was fossil fuels that sustained the Industrial Revolution. About 100 years after 
the start of the Industrial Revolution in England—by the end of the nineteenth 
century—steel was being used abundantly in Europe and America. In 1853, an 
American navy  ﬂ eet, known in Japan as the Kurobune, or Black Ships, appeared 

73
6.1 Earth History, Human History
offshore of Edo and eventually compelled Japan to open to the West. Those ships 
were clad in iron, making them appear black. The  ﬁ rst transcontinental railroad 
opened in 1869 in the United States, and the Eiffel Tower, with its monumental 
structure made of iron, was completed in 1889 for the World Exposition in Paris. 
In Europe, at the end of the nineteenth century, architecture and decorative art 
often used iron as a material for what was known as Art Nouveau. The First World 
War was a con ﬂ ict that consumed huge amounts of iron in guns, canons, cannon-
balls and warships. 
 The model of industrialization based on coal and iron is still alive and well today 
in the twenty- ﬁ rst century. China is a good example of this. After the Second World 
War, China experimented with nation building under a communist regime using 
socialism. The philosophy of Mao Tse-tung put an emphasis on agriculture, farm-
ers, and farm villages, and in the sense that he attempted to achieve economic devel-
opment by using only resources within the country rather than depending on the 
outside. His philosophy was one of a closed economy. This experiment failed, how-
ever, and from 1979 onward under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping, the country 
shifted toward an open policy. In terms of economic openness, China also moved 
toward an open economy in terms of resource use. The consumption of coal and 
iron increased rapidly. Annual iron production in China during the 1950s was about 
 ﬁ ve million tons. By 2007, production had risen to 2.6 billion tons of coal and 500 
million tons of iron. In a way, this all makes sense if we realize that China is now 
achieving its own delayed Industrial Revolution. 
 6.1.4  Agricultural Civilization 
 Archaeologists have made many interesting discoveries about where and when 
agriculture  ﬁ rst began. It is said that the cultivation of wheat and barley began about 
9000  bc in the region around present-day Palestine. This cultivation was propagated 
to Egypt and Mesopotamia, where large-scale irrigated farming began in the river 
basins of the Nile, Tigris, and Euphrates. There are several theories about the exact 
timing, but it seems that this likely occurred about 5000  bc . Agriculture also began 
along the Yellow River and Yangtze River in China. Evidence suggests that wheat 
cultivation arrived in northern China from Mesopotamia via Central Asia, whereas 
rice cultivation came to southern China via a different route. 
 Large-scale irrigated agriculture made it possible to produce and store large 
amounts of grain. Agriculture produced large surpluses, which freed people from 
having to dedicate their days completely to obtaining food and allowed them to 
produce goods such as pottery and bronze, and this led to the building of civiliza-
tions. It is possible that climate change after the end of the last Ice Age caused the 
extinction of the animals that humans hunted, so they ceased their nomadic roaming 
and had to cope with the new problem of securing food. It is also possible that under 
the new environmental conditions, humans discovered wild grains, millet, and legu-
minous plants, and began to cultivate them. In Japan, traces have been found at the 

74
6 Transforming Our Society: Low Carbon, Coexistence with Nature…
Sannai-Maruyama site in Aomori Prefecture indicating that the people cultivated 
chestnut trees during the Jomon period. Discoveries such as these have been made 
through research into pollen buried in ancient ground layers. 
 The conversion of grasslands to cultivated land and the creation of water courses 
for irrigation marked the beginning of human activities that alter and manage nature. 
It has never exactly been easy, however, for humans to manage nature. The water 
that was so essential for agriculture was controlled by natural conditions such as 
sunshine and precipitation. Lack of rain would mean a drought; too much rain, how-
ever, the  ﬁ elds would be washed away by  ﬂ ooding. 
 If irrigated farming continues for long, ground salt dissolves in the water and 
then is deposited on the ground surface. In a country of abundant rainfall such as 
Japan, the salt is washed away by the rain, but in arid regions like Central Asia, it 
gradually builds up on the ground surface, eventually making the land unsuitable for 
agriculture: this is referred to as salinization of soil. One theory suggests that the 
ancient Mesopotamian and Indus Valley civilizations collapsed as a result of soil 
salinization, which was caused by irrigated farming over many years. 
 The productivity of an agricultural civilization is strongly in ﬂ uenced by the area of 
land that can be used as farmland and by the productivity of the land. And land pro-
ductivity is determined by such factors as the nutrients in the soil, natural conditions 
such as hours of sunlight and amount of precipitation, the use of farm implements 
such as hoes and harrows, irrigation infrastructure, and farming methods. In any case, 
because agriculture was the source of production, the crop sizes were largely affected 
by climate conditions. This situation is exactly the same as for agriculture nowadays 
 [ 4  ] . Today, however, recombinant DNA technology makes it possible to use selec-
tively pest-resistant and climate-resilient crops that produce high yields.  
 6.1.5  Links Between Climate and the Industrial Revolution 
 During the Medieval Warm Period, the Vikings of Scandinavia became active and 
discovered Greenland and the American continent. The cooling of the climate dur-
ing the Little Ice Age was a huge blow to agriculture. Also, in China and surround-
ing areas, climate change forced northern nomads to descend southward in response 
to a lack of feed grass for their animals, and this had a major impact on Chinese 
history and dynastic change. 
 There is an argument that the cooler climate of the modern Little Ice Age was a 
trigger for the Industrial Revolution. In England and other European countries, 
wood fuel was needed for warmth in the cooler climate conditions, which led to the 
clearing of their forests. Thus, to  ﬁ nd a replacement for  ﬁ rewood, it was necessary 
to dig for coal, and this led to the invention of the steam locomotive, which was used 
to remove water in coal mines as well as to transport the coal to industrial sites. 
 So cooling may have brought on the Industrial Revolution, and the massive use 
of fossil fuels has brought on global warming. There is a profound connection 
between climate and history. The three great civilizations of Egypt, Mesopotamia, 

75
6.1 Earth History, Human History
and China were the products of climate change. All together, the global ecosystem 
and the human activities that depend on it make up one interactive system. Climate 
warming and cooling, and the changes attendant in the climate such as changes in 
precipitation, aridity, and humidity—these have had huge impacts on human activi-
ties. To adapt to climate conditions, humans changed their lifestyles and societal 
systems and developed technologies. The very history of humanity—the social 
 disruptions, human migrations, wars, and so on—is a product of repeated cycles of 
climate processes over hundreds, thousands, and tens of thousands of years  [ 4 ] . 
 6.1.6  The Industrial Revolution and Modern 
Industrial Civilization 
 Modern industrial civilization emerged at the end of the eighteenth century, with the 
Industrial Revolution in England. The deciding factor here was James Watt’s improve-
ment of the steam engine in 1785. A prototype steam engine had already existed, but 
it was Watt who succeeded in converting the steam engine’s energy from piston motion 
to rotational motion (Fig.  6.1 ). This was the birth of the reciprocating steam engine.  
 The steam engine brought about dramatic changes in human society. It was 
used to pump water out of coal mines, which helped to dramatically increase coal 
production. Railways were created, and the speed and carrying capacity of trans-
portation jumped signi ﬁ cantly. Coal provided the power for steam engines, and 
the railways made of iron made it possible to carry the mined coal great distances.

6 Transforming Our Society: Low Carbon, Coexistence with Nature…
The steam engine was also used in textile machines, which led to mass production 
of cotton yarn and the expansion of the cotton spinning industry. 
 Besides the steam engine, another important development early in the eighteenth 
century was a new iron-making process that used coke. Until then, wood charcoal was 
used in iron making, but that method required the large-scale logging of forests. At the 
time, England was suffering from a severe shortage of timber because forests had been 
cut down for fuel, which resulted in serious problems for iron production. Thanks to 
the steam engine and the use of coke in the steel-making process, iron could be mass 
produced, and this made it possible to manufacture machines and ships and other 
things from iron, and also made possible the construction of railroads. 
 Steam engines also had an enormous impact on the development of cities. Until 
then, factories were built along rivers to allow the use of water power, but the steam 
engine made it possible to construct factories in the suburbs away from rivers. The 
result was that emerging commercial and industrial cities such as Manchester and 
Glasgow experienced further growth. 
 The emergence of the key technology of the steam engine caused enormous 
changes in the economy, society, and even in politics. After the reciprocating steam 
engine came the steam turbine and other technological innovations such as the inter-
nal combustion engine that used petroleum-based fuel, but the basic framework of 
civilization born of the steam engine and coal has essentially remained unchanged. 
This is a civilization constructed on fossil fuels such as coal and oil—the “fossil fuel 
civilization.” In this sense, this is also a “high-carbon society,” and its manifestation 
is the automobile (Fig.  6.2 ). 
 Fig. 6.2   The Ford model T
Note: In 1908, Ford Motor Company produced the  ﬁ rst affordable automobile. Since then, automo-
biles have been a symbol of the prosperity of high-carbon society. Today, a hundred years later,

comes next in the age of transition to a low carbon society. Source of picture:   http://en.wikipedia.

6.2 Aiming for Sustainability
 Incidentally, China and Japan also had iron-making processes based on wood char-
coal. Japanese writer and historian Ryotaro Shiba theorized that the reason China lost 
its forests was logging for production of iron over its long history. In ancient Japan, a 
group by the name of “Tatarashi” made iron in the mountains of the Chugoku district 
of the country. In the legend of the  Yamata no Orochi (a mythical  eight-headed ser-
pent), red blood poured from the beast and the story tells that a sword was discovered 
in its body. One interpretation is that there was an iron-making group in the moun-
tains, that it cut many trees, and that heavy rains caused a washout of reddish soil.  
 6.1.7  A New Civilization: Low-Carbon Societies 
 The emergence of global warming as an issue clearly shows us the limits of the fos-
sil fuel civilization. Today humanity is beginning to search for ways to become a 
civilization based on technological systems that do not depend on fossil fuels. It is 
of historic signi ﬁ cance that the term “low-carbon society” has come into common 
use recently. So now we must ask: exactly what is a low-carbon society? Simply 
stated, it is a society that uses the least possible amount of fossil fuels such as oil and 
coal. The ideal would be a society that does not use fossil fuels at all—a “decarbon-
ized society” or a “carbon-free society.” 
 If it was the appearance of the steam engine that brought about the modern indus-
trial civilization—that is, the fossil fuel civilization—what technology holds the key 
to a low-carbon society? Can nuclear power replace fossil fuels as a source of energy? 
Or can renewable energy such as solar energy or biofuels do the job? Or will it perhaps 
be innovative technology such as nuclear fusion? Based on the progress in science and 
technology that we have witnessed in our own lifetime, and re ﬂ ecting back upon the 
major socioeconomic changes we have experienced, we cannot help but feel that it is 
extremely dif ﬁ cult to predict the future. The capacity of the large computer we  ﬁ rst 
began to use in about 1970 is no comparison to one of today’s personal computers. It 
was beyond imagination that the Internet would spread as far and wide as it has. 
On the other hand, some technologies such as power generation from nuclear fusion 
have not made the progress people had expected or hoped would occur. 
 If nuclear power or some other future development of fusion power can replace 
fossil fuels, humanity may be released from energy constraints. But will the sce-
nario be desirable for spaceship Earth? After being released from one constraint, it 
is likely we will crash into another. History is an endless repetition of this kind of 
endeavor, and there are no  ﬁ nal answers. 
 6.2  Aiming for Sustainability 
 6.2.1  What Is Sustainability? 
 The principle of “sustainable development” was presented as a core concept at the 
Earth Summit in 1992, but what exactly is it? By way of background, it was the 

78
6 Transforming Our Society: Low Carbon, Coexistence with Nature…
World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED), established by 
the United Nations, that made the preparations for the Earth Summit. The commis-
sion’s  ﬁ nal report, issued in 1987 and titled “Our Common Future,” was the  ﬁ rst 
place this principle appeared  [  5,  6 ] . It de ﬁ nes sustainable development as develop-
ment that “meets the needs of the present without sacri ﬁ cing the ability of future 
generations to meet their own needs.” At  ﬁ rst glance this may not seem to be the 
easiest concept to grasp. 
 Recent debate about pension systems in Japan gives some good material to 
 consider what sustainability really is. Pension systems are designed to maintain 
sustainability by having the younger working generation bear the burden of paying 
for the system, but as a result of the trend to lower birthrates and aging of society 
in Japan, there are now relatively fewer young people, and eventually the system 
could collapse. Increasing the size of the government’s  ﬁ scal de ﬁ cit as an eco-
nomic strategy is another way to transfer economic burdens to the future. Indeed, 
de ﬁ cit  ﬁ nancing by government is public spending to meet the “needs of the pres-
ent generation.” An excessively heavy burden placed on future generations may 
render them unable to meet their own needs. 
 Economist Herman Daly proposed three precepts for the sustainable use of 
resources, the gist of which can be summarized as follows: (1) the rate of use of 
“renewable resources” (forests,  ﬁ sheries resources, etc.) must not exceed the ability 
of the ecosystem to regenerate the resources; (2) the use of “nonrenewable resources” 
(fossil fuels, minerals, etc.) must be at a pace that does not exceed the rate of devel-
opment of renewable substitutes; and (3) the emissions of pollutants must not exceed 
nature’s self-cleaning capacity (or environmental space)  [ 7 ] . The second principle 
here may be slightly dif ﬁ cult to grasp, but if we take the example of oil, anticipating 
the fact that oil will be depleted in the future, we should take a portion of the pro ﬁ ts 
from the use of oil and invest it into the development of renewable natural energy to 
compensate for the depletion of the  ﬁ nite resources. 
 As for the sustainability of natural resources, there is a famous argument about 
the substitutability between “natural capital” (as in an old-growth forest) and 
“manmade capital” (as in a plantation forest). There is a stance that the natural 
capital has its intrinsic value that cannot be substituted by manmade capital, and 
we must strictly maintain the renewal capacity of the natural capital. There is 
another stance that if the function is the same, it is acceptable to substitute man-
made capital for natural capital. The former is valued as “strong sustainability” and 
the latter as “weak sustainability.”  
 6.2.2  Waves and Cycles in the Environment and Economy 
 We seem to believe that it is entirely normal to expect an economy to always continue 
growing, but can we really expect that to happen? During this century the world 
population is generally expected to continue increasing, but if the world population 
started to actually decrease, what would be the implications for the economy? 

79
6.2 Aiming for Sustainability
 It is well known that the economy moves in waves, but it is important to also 
realize that economic waves greatly affect the general level of interest in environ-
mental problems, the willingness to tackle them, and the size of investments in the 
environment. A growing economy means rising consumption of energy and 
resources, and also a steadily growing burden on the environment, but a growing 
economy also boosts investment in research and development, and facilitates prog-
ress in efforts to seek harmony between the environment and human activities. 
Conversely, during a recession, the consumption of both resources and energy drops, 
and overall investment into research and development also tends to drop. 
 In our experience of the past 50 years or so, there have been several waves in the 
environment and economy. During the period of rapid economic growth from the 
1960s through to the oil shock of 1973, Japan experienced many problems with 
industrial pollution, but it also turned into a period of large investment into pollution 
prevention. The 1980s were rather like a winter for domestic environmental policy 
in this country. Nevertheless, at the international level, the issue of global warming 
was taken up seriously, and along with the end of the Cold War between the East 
and West, and the expansion of the European Union eastward, the international 
community made some progress in environmental policies, with Europe leading the 
way. During the 1990s, even though Japan suffered from the after-effects of its burst 
economic bubble, it still made considerable progress in environmental policies, 
spurred on by an international tailwind. 
 6.2.3  The Drivers of Progress 
 Various global economy and technology scenarios have been developed to help 
 predict future global warming, but not one of them includes a scenario for an extended 
period of negative growth for the global economy  [  8 ] . This seems somewhat strange. 
The basis for economic forecasting is our experience of, at the most, the past 100 years 
or so. There have been anomalies in history, such as Great Depression that started in 
1929 and the Second World War from 1939 to 1945, but the general assumption has 
been that human society will continually move in the direction of progress, expan-
sion, and development. Actually, however these things are not guaranteed. 
 The real driver of human progress is the power of science and technology, and 
the source of this power is none other than human creativity. New inventions, dis-
coveries, and technological developments have created new products, promoted 
human health, and extended human life through advances in medicine  [ 9 ] . For sus-
tainable development from now on, the key issue is whether we can develop and 
spread technologies that will contribute to both environmental improvements and 
economic growth. In 2008, Barack Obama, as newly elected President of the United 
States, announced initiatives that would create much employment through invest-
ment in areas such as improving buildings to boost energy ef ﬁ ciency; expansion of 
public transport and rail freight; development of advanced power grid systems; 
wind power, solar power; advanced biofuels, and so on. 

80
6 Transforming Our Society: Low Carbon, Coexistence with Nature…
 The macroeconomic model of economic growth tells us that by diverting a 
 portion of current production to invest for the future it is possible to increase future 
production capacity, and we are told that this facilitates sustainable economic 
growth. If the economy falls into a recession, however, the private sector has fewer 
funds to invest, so the role of governments becomes more important. 
 Aiming for economic revitalization during the 1980s when the economy was in 
recession, the United Kingdom’s Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and United 
States’ President Ronald Reagan were among the leaders promoting neoliberalism 
with its focus on the role of private sector activity. As this book is being written in 
early 2009, those two countries are both embracing policies that enlarge the role of 
government. This step is made necessary by circumstances, although many people 
are concerned about growing  ﬁ scal de ﬁ cits. With combined national and local 
 government  ﬁ scal de ﬁ cits of more than 800 trillion yen, or 1.6 times gross domestic 
product, Japan too is in a serious situation today. In this context, we are being tested 
as to whether or not we can read the trends and make the right economic and 
 environmental decisions. 
 6.2.4  Societies with Sound Material Cycle 
 On the surface, the “metabolic” mechanisms of input and transformation of resources 
and energy associated with human activities seem to resemble what happens in natu-
ral ecosystems. Humans live by eating food every day, digesting it, and excreting the 
waste, and the natural world contains ecosystems that completely recycle this waste. 
Sustainable systems incorporate mechanisms to maintain this kind of steady state. 
The natural world has perfect recycling systems based on metabolic mechanisms. In 
contrast, our modern industrial civilization is built upon the mass consumption of 
buried resources such as fossil fuels and minerals. The products produced are dif ﬁ cult 
to dispose, and some of them become hazardous waste that accumulates in the envi-
ronment. This scene is very different from recycling in the natural world. 
 The  ﬁ eld of “industrial ecology” has appeared as a discipline that analyzes the 
material  ﬂ ows generated arti ﬁ cially from human activities in modern industrial 
societies. Since about 1980, experts have been attempting to redesign the material 
circulation systems of our modern industrial civilization based on lessons from the 
natural world. Related concepts included reducing resource inputs and environmen-
tal pollutant generation to the smallest possible levels per unit of production, and 
these measures led to the concepts of “eco-ef ﬁ ciency,” “factor four” (doubling 
wealth, halving resource use), and “zero emissions”  [ 9– 12 ] . The concept of “sound 
material-cycle society” (or a “recycling-based society,” in Japanese  junkangata 
shakai ) was born in response to the serious issue of trying to stop the constantly 
growing volume of waste in society. Japan even passed the “Basic Law for 
Establishing a Sound Material-Cycle Society” into law in 2000. 
 We must not forget, however, that large differences still exist between the 
material cycle of the natural or biological world and the materials cycle in modern 

81
6.2 Aiming for Sustainability
industrial society. The former is powered by solar energy and is based upon plant 
photosynthesis and circulation in the food chain, the latter upon fossil fuels and 
nuclear power. Many industrial products contain a variety of regular and rare 
 metals as well as persistent chemicals, which when left in the environment can 
become substances hazardous to ecosystems. In contrast, “manufacturing” in the 
natural world was self-organizing through the long processes of evolution, so any-
thing created that has  ﬁ nished its purpose is decomposed again naturally, and 
nothing toxic remains. 
 During this century, manufacturing technology will change dramatically. 
One day, we will probably be able to recycle and reuse most of the existing above-
ground stock of metals, and we will probably be able to create high-performance 
materials using biotechnology. It may be also possible that computers will use 
biochips or neural circuits instead of today’s solid state integrated circuit chips. 
The key to success may be the improved understanding of and learning from the 
miraculous functions of living things and ecosystems, and the development of 
technologies that mimic them.  
 6.2.5  Social and Economic Paradigm Shifts: Dematerialization, 
Less Ownership, More “Servicizing” 
 The concept of “sound material cycle” originated in Germany in the 1990s from the 
concept of “Extended Producer Responsibility”  [ 13 ] . People thought it was unac-
ceptable for municipal governments to bear all the responsibility of collecting and 
disposing of household waste. The manufacturers and retail stores that made or sold 
the products that ended up as waste should bear some responsibility. This concept 
was quickly embraced in Japan, which quickly enacted the legislation for a sound 
material-cycle society. 
 A fundamental shift in thinking is still needed to incorporate the concept of 
extended producer responsibility into the economic system that we will simply take 
for granted. 
 Today when we purchase a product, we take ownership of that item, and when we 
are  ﬁ nished with it, the used product becomes waste. But if the manufacturer were to 
take the item back again, the ownership would revert back to the manufacturer. 
In such a scenario, it would be more sensible to  lease  the item instead of  purchasing 
it. In that case, the ownership would stay with the manufacturer throughout, and the 
user would enter into a leasing contract with the manufacturer. This is already exactly 
how we expect things to happen with a rental apartment or an of ﬁ ce. 
 Let us consider how this would work with an automobile. What is the reason 
that we purchase a car? Do we own cars as status symbols? Or are they for the 
purpose of transport? Even if you own a luxury import car, what is the point in 
owning it if you have little opportunity to drive and it stays parked most of the 
time? If the car is only driven occasionally, it would be much cheaper to rent a nice 
car only when needed. 

82
6 Transforming Our Society: Low Carbon, Coexistence with Nature…
 Property and consumer durables (e.g., houses, automobiles, household appli-
ances) have both ownership value and “usership” (or service) value. Societies in the 
future may place more importance on the value of use, or the value of service that 
the item can provide rather than on ownership. Ultimately the outcome is decided 
by consumer preferences, but people could choose to lease or rent the car of their 
choice just when they need to use it. This attitude could be a way for society to 
achieve a major transformation toward “servicizing,” shifting away from ownership 
and instead placing value on the services they can obtain from things. 
 6.2.6  Transition Toward a Low-Carbon Society 
 Technological progress since the Industrial Revolution has been remarkable, but it 
is fossil fuels that were the driving force behind economic growth. Fossil fuels made 
possible the production of great amounts of iron, and as a raw material iron made it 
possible to build tall buildings, ships, automobiles, and other many items. Almost 
all forms of transport—automobiles, ships, aircraft, and others—depend on fossil 
fuels and internal combustion engines for motive power. 
 A low-carbon society is one that has shifted away from its dependence on fossil 
fuels. Expanded use of nuclear power might be one way to follow this path, but it 
comes with safety concerns, and there are also risks such as the proliferation of 
nuclear weapons and terrorism in politically unstable countries or regions. Within 
Japan, the natural energy that can be used anywhere is solar energy. It may be 
dif ﬁ cult to have solar replace all uses of fuels, but in small and medium cities with 
good climatic conditions, it is possible to use solar to meet almost all noncommer-
cial energy demand, such as for heating and cooling. 
 The automobile was a phenomenon of the fossil fuel civilization, which is a 
high-carbon society. Diverting biofuels to automobile use sets up competition for 
agricultural resources between production for food and production for fuel, so there 
are quantitative constraints on the use of biofuels as a solution. Today, Brazil and 
the United States show great potential for biofuel production, and there are concerns 
that biofuels could be the next strategic commodity after oil. Ultimately, however, 
we must redesign our cities and transport systems to allow us to live without depend-
ing on the automobile. 
 During the  ﬁ rst half of this century, economic growth will continue in countries with 
large populations such as China, India, and Brazil. Some are strongly concerned about 
the pressures of resource demand in these countries. The above-the-ground stock of 
iron in industrialized countries exceeds 10 tons per capita, but in China it is still only 
about 2 tons per capita. Even if that country’s annual production of 685 million tons in 
2011 was an anomaly, iron is still needed in China, so production is likely to continue 
until aboveground stocks reach at least two or three times the current level. 
 The foregoing may seem relatively pessimistic, but there is also hope. Japan is 
already experiencing low birthrates and the aging of society. There is a big chance that 
population growth rates in developing countries will be below current projections. 

83

If world population growth rate slows after the middle of this century, the pressure on 
the environment will quickly decline. What Japan is experiencing now is already 
proof of that. Basic commodities such as iron are already being recycled extensively, 
so the amount of new production from raw materials (or virgin resources) can be 
expected to drop dramatically in the future. 
 Biotechnology holds much promise as a core technology for a low-carbon 
society, but for that to happen, it is essential that biodiversity be preserved. 
Biotechnology is likely to be a critical technology, whether it be for food, biofu-
els, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, or environmental remediation. In the end, we 
must aim simultaneously for three goals: a low-carbon society, coexistence with 
nature, and sound material cycle (Fig.  6.3 ).

 7.1  Who Owns the Environment? 
 7.1.1  The Tragedy of the Commons 
 “The Tragedy of the Commons” is a metaphor rich with implications for the essence 
of environmental issues, and those words formed the title of an article by biologist 
Garrett Hardin, published in 1968 in the journal  Science  [ 1 ] . Hardin’s basic scenario 
is based on a common pasture (the “commons”) where many herders may graze 
their cattle. All is  ﬁ ne when the total number of cattle is low, because even as the 
herders increase their herds, there is still adequate capacity in the pasture. As the 
number of cattle increases further, however, the capacity for grazing drops, and the 
pasture gradually becomes crowded. Eventually, further increases in the number of 
cattle push the pasture pass a critical point at which it is irreversibly damaged. 
 The main points of this metaphor are that individuals—each seeming to act ratio-
nally—will act in a way that crosses a critical point with an undesirable result for 
society overall, and that behavior based on short-sighted desires of individuals will 
result in the over usage of shared resources. Looking around, we can see many 
examples of these dynamics. If just one factory dumps a relatively small amount of 
ef ﬂ uent into the environment, there may be no serious problems. If many factories 
operate similarly, however, the pollution will exceed the environmental capacity of 
the river, and not only might the local residents suffer from illness, the factories 
might  ﬁ nd themselves unable to continue operations. Traf ﬁ c jams and damage to 
public parks also share similarities with these dynamics. 
 In Hardin’s metaphor, all herders have as much access to the pasture as they like. 
It might be possible to avoid irreversible damage to the pasture, however, if the 
pasture has an owner and some usage restrictions are imposed, or if an owner 
charges a usage fee, or if a wise person proposes limits on the number of cattle that 
can be allowed to graze there and everyone respects that limit.

7 The Environment as a Commons: How Should It Be Managed?
 7.1.2  Why Does the Tragedy of the Commons Exist? 
 Three factors end up causing excessive use in the tragedy of the commons: 
(1) a system of free access, (2) externality, and (3) short-sighted self-interest. A 
system of free access—with resources that are shared and available for anyone to 
use—can lead to excessive use as a result of the ambiguity of ownership or usage 
rights; the management structure is not clear, so each individual can act as he or she 
wishes. We discuss externality further in Chap.   8 , but for the moment we de ﬁ ne this 
as the impact of individual behavior on the life of other individuals that takes place 
in the absence of economic transaction. Short-sighted self-interest is a characteristic 
by which individuals choose to act in pursuit of their own short-term pro ﬁ ts. 
 The  ﬁ rst two factors relate to the common features of what may be classi ﬁ ed as 
public goods, such as roads and parks; for these, ways are needed to prevent exces-
sive use and congestion. To begin with, owners or managers must clarify the system 
of management. To this end, the parties who depend on the commons need to decide 
on shared rules for management, and this is where a variety of laws and interna-
tional treaties relating to environmental protection come in. For matters that have 
not yet been formally put in writing, often this function is ful ﬁ lled by customs and 
conventions that have been observed by the local community. Another approach is 
through economic means, by internalizing the costs and bene ﬁ ts of environmental 
management into economic behavior. The introduction of emissions trading sys-
tems and environmental taxes for greenhouse gases is also in line with this type of 
approach; these are solutions that follow the principles of the market economy. 
 A complete management system as mentioned above may automatically prevent 
behavior based on short-sighted self-interest, but another approach to change indi-
vidual behavior is through proactive environmental education and provision of 
improved information. 
 7.1.3  The Prisoner’s Dilemma 
 The “prisoner’s dilemma” is another metaphor that attempts to explain why individu-
als in a commons may behave in a short-sighted and uncoordinated fashion  [ 2,  3 ] . 
 In the United States, it is common for prosecutors to negotiate with criminals 
to obtain evidence to settle a case. In one version of this metaphor, prisoners A 
and B, who committed a crime together, have been apprehended and are in soli-
tary cells where they cannot communicate with each other. Because both of them 
have committed other minor crimes, neither can avoid a 1-year prison sentence, 
but if evidence is found for the crime in question they could get 10 years in prison. 
The prosecutor tells A that if he remains silent but B exposes who committed the 
crime, the prosecutor will seek 10 years imprisonment for A, but if A confesses 
 ﬁ rst, then his sentence may be reduced to 3 years. The prosecutor engages in the 
same negotiation with B. In this case, if both prisoners remain silent, both will be 
imprisoned for only 1 year. The worst case for them would be that both prisoners 

87
7.1 Who Owns the Environment?
confess, in which case both would spend 8 years in prison (slightly reduced for 
having confessed). If one prisoner remains silent but the other confesses, the silent 
one will spend 10 years in prison, and the one who confessed only 3 years. 
 Let us imagine for a moment what goes on in the mind of each prisoner. If they 
can trust each other, both will remain silent, but if they cannot trust each other, they 
will both confess. This metaphor closely resembles the psychological aspects of the 
individuals in the use of a commons: each individual believes that even if he or she 
behaves with restraint, others will not exercise restraint. The result will be excessive 
use of the commons. 
 To avoid the prisoner’s dilemma, parties must communicate with each other and 
cooperate based on mutual trust. These conclusions are important when dealing 
with environmental problems. 
 7.1.4  The Global Commons 
 The term “commons” simply means “common land” or “common property,” but the 
term for “common” can imply two situations: (1) the common owners are clearly 
known, and (2) the common owners are not clearly known or they are numerous and 
unidenti ﬁ able. 
 In the days before today’s market economy became so pervasive, local commu-
nities in many places in the world jointly managed common farmland, pastureland, 
forestland, wells, and other natural resources, in ways that allowed them to continue 
using the resource sustainably without exceeding the regenerative capacity of the 
environment. In some cases there were clearly articulated rules in the local 
 communities, and in other cases implicit rules that set forth the rights and responsi-
bilities of commons users. This was possible when the number of people involved 
in the commons was small enough that people could identify each other directly. 
 Problems begin to arise if the users are unidenti ﬁ able and numerous, or if the 
large number makes it dif ﬁ cult to form consensus on the rules of management, or if 
the rules are dif ﬁ cult to enforce because of the presence of “free riders” who believe 
they are likely to face no penalty if they alone violate the rules. This is exactly the 
problem we can see today in the use of “environmental resources” such as the global 
atmosphere and oceans as dumping grounds for waste, under our globalized eco-
nomic and industrial systems. Humanity has recently begun to see our planet’s 
atmosphere and oceans as “global commons” and to establish ways to manage them. 
Examples can be seen in the international treaties concerning climate change, the 
ozone layer, and other global commons. 
 International treaties and agreements—the rules for all of humanity to participate 
in management of the global commons—are essential, but a dif ﬁ cult problem arises 
regarding how to negotiate with the con ﬂ icting interests of developed and develop-
ing countries. The Rio Declaration and Framework Convention on Climate Change 
address this problem with the phrase “common but differentiated responsibility” 
 [ 4 ] . It was ultimately possible to reach consensus with developing countries by 

88
7 The Environment as a Commons: How Should It Be Managed?
 recognizing that even though developed countries—with a long history of 
 modernization and industrialization—have greater responsibility, all members of 
the international community share some responsibility. 
 7.1.5  Anthropocentrism and Ecocentrism 
 People may come across slogans like “Let’s protect the global environment together,” 
and “The Earth belongs to everyone.” Behind these slogans is the abstract idea that 
the environment is the shared property of all people in a community—or all citizens 
in a country, or even for all of humanity on the planet—and some ambiguity about 
which entity should protect the environment. This brings us to a big question: 
Who owns the environment and who should take responsibility to protect it? 
 Ultimately, the global environment is necessary for all living species, not just for 
the one species known as  Homo sapiens . One stance on environmental protection is 
“anthropocentrism,” which asserts that humans have a privileged position among all 
species. Another stance is “ecocentrism,” which puts the rights of all species on 
equal terms with those of humans. Environmental philosophers and ethicists aside, 
people most probably vacillate between the two positions. 
 The  ﬁ rst principle in the “Rio Declaration on Environment and Development” 
adopted at the Rio Summit in 1992, was this: “Human beings are at the centre of 
concerns for sustainable development. They are entitled to a healthy and productive 
life in harmony with nature”  [ 5,  6 ] . These words, while candidly recognizing that it 
is humans who are causing environmental problems and who hold the keys to solu-
tions, do not state that humans must cease their activities. While stating the con-
straint of being in “harmony with nature,” it also says that humans are “entitled” to 
a healthy and productive life. This text was the result of negotiations to re ﬂ ect devel-
oping countries’ assertions that they too had the right to seek prosperity, but it is 
obviously an articulation of an anthropocentric stance on the environment and 
development. 
 In contrast to anthropocentrism, ecocentrism recognizes that the global eco-
system is based on coexistence, with all species engaged in interactions with 
others; human beings are only one constituent in this system. Similar terms 
include “non-anthropocentrism” and “biocentrism.”  
 7.1.6  Deep Ecology 
 “Deep ecology” is one brand of ecocentrism that was  ﬁ rst proposed in 1973 by 
Norwegian philosopher Arne Næss  [ 6 ] . At the time, a strong consumers’ movement 
was in ﬂ uential in the public debate in Europe and the United States, as evidenced by 
the popularity of consumer advocate Ralph Nader, and the environmental protection 
movement was also strong. In that context, Næss asserted that “shallow

7.1 Who Owns the Environment?
 environmentalism” sought solutions to environmental problems by reforming 
 economic and political systems, while “deep ecology” sought internal reforms of 
the human consciousness about nature. He explained that by reforming our internal 
attitudes by realizing that all things in the biosphere are equal, we can be liberated 
from mass consumption, the subjugation of nature, and the chasing of fads that 
modern civilization has wrought. 
 The foundations of anthropocentrism were formed by Christian teachings that 
God created Man; that much is certain. Western countries where Christianity is 
strong also happen to be where ecocentrism was born. One might conclude that 
Eastern thought—such as the teachings of Buddhism about reincarnation and its 
warnings against the destruction of life—is close to ecocentrism, and apparently 
Næss was in ﬂ uenced by Eastern thought, but there is little evidence that Asians 
actively in ﬂ uenced this debate. 
 There may be many ways to think about environmental protection—whether the 
approach be anthropocentrism, ecocentrism, or something else—and people may 
have different views that vary depending on the individual, country, or even reli-
gion, but thinking and stances on this topic can be summarized generally in a few 
categories. If we put the “cowboy economy” thinking that says it is completely 
acceptable for humans to use all the resources they want on the far right, and “deep 
ecology” on the far left, then in the middle are other representative stances, such as 
“neo-classical environmental economics,” “resource economics,” and “ecological 
economics.” These we discuss in more detail in Chap. 8 under the topic of 
 “environmental economics.” Figure  7.1 illustrates the relationship between various 
environmental thoughts and disciplines.  
 7.1.7  Who Owns the Environment? 
 Long ago, no one claimed ownership of the land, forest, water, or air—the many 
resources of the Earth. In economic terms these were “free goods.” Over time, it 
came about that the persons who cleared the land became considered as its own-
ers, but private land ownership did not just begin suddenly. In some countries, 
land that  ﬁ rst belonged to the state was allocated to individuals, and that was the 
start of the private ownership of land. Eventually, a small number of landowners 
held vast tracts of land, and a large number of farmers owned no land—and this 
bipolarization became a major problem in many societies. It was in the twenti-
eth century that Russia and China had revolutions attempting to resolve this 
problem. 
 Today, almost all land in the world is the territory of a state, but one exception is 
Antarctica. The Antarctic Treaty, concluded in 1959, froze countries’ territorial 
claims on this continent. In the global climate system, the roles of the Antarctic and 
the Arctic are exceedingly important. If human activity in the Antarctic increases 
for reason of resource development, the ice will melt further, and there are concerns 
about this causing serious impacts on the global climate system.

 Most of the Earth’s water resource resides in the oceans. International law 
incorporates the concept of “high seas” (or “international waters”), but who “owns” 
the vast amount of water in the Paci ﬁ c Ocean? There are no regulatory provisions 
to answer this question. Rain falls to the Earth from the sky and  ﬂ ows through riv-
ers. In this case, there are many examples of national laws on water usage rights, 
water drawing rights, or some similar form of rights. In the past, many con ﬂ icts 
were fought before rights were established for access to water resources, but once 
rights were established, many of the problems were resolved.  
 7.1.8  Air and Water Are Not Free: Managing the Dumping 
Grounds 
 Long ago, water and air were free, but today the situation is very different. We now 
purchase drinking water in plastic bottles, and even the air has ceased to be a com-
pletely free good. Air and water are vital resources for the survival of living things, 
but there are two dimensions to be considered. First, living things need these 
resources for respiration and to sustain the body. Second, living things need them 
as a place to dispose of waste material and waste heat. These two dimensions are 
inextricably linked: if a large amount of waste is disposed here, the air and water

will both become polluted, their quality as resources will deteriorate, and the 
 existence of living things will be at risk. 
 Environmental issues newly emerged as the problem of management of air and 
water (rivers, lakes, oceans) in the context of the disposal of waste generated in the 
course of human activities. Because the amount of disposed pollutants, greenhouse 
gases and other wastes increased suddenly, restrictions were imposed on the 
 disposal of waste, and fees were put into place for the use of air and water as a 
dumping ground for waste. Alternatively, it became necessary to purchase rights or 
obtain permits to “dump.” Examples of such tools are surcharges on industrial 
ef ﬂ uent, or emissions trading for greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. Land is 
similar. No one now can dispose of waste just anywhere, and when it is hauled to a 
designated land ﬁ ll in the Tokyo metropolitan area, for example, the disposal fee is 
10,000–20,000 yen per ton. 
 The air we breathe is still a free good, but limits are now being imposed on how 
much we can use the atmosphere to dispose of air pollutants (carbon dioxide, sulfur 
dioxide, etc.). Polluters should either pay to dump into the atmosphere (e.g., a car-
bon tax, or a fee of a few thousand yen per ton of carbon dioxide or other emissions 
from fossil fuel sources), or purchase usage rights (emission rights). In this sense, 
the time has come to turn the atmosphere—until now a free good—into something 
with a price on it and for which we must pay for the right to use. 
 Above we discussed sustainable joint management by local people sometimes 
works well for a local commons, but for a global commons such as the atmosphere, 
it is not so easy to reach consensus on joint management. Under such a situation, a 
price is set on something that was until now a free good, or some other economic 
method is used to establish user rights and then trade them on the market. Already 
the world is starting to implement such methods. 
 7.2  Managing Local Commons Sustainably 
 7.2.1  The Tragedy of the Commons Revisited 
 In Hardin’s version of the tragedy of the commons, the commons ends up damaged, 
but does that metaphor always  ﬁ t? Are humans always pursuing their individual 
interests and so indifferent to the common good? It is worth noting that there are 
various possible types of commons. The “local commons,” or common property 
jointly managed by local people, is one example with a real history of self-regula-
tion and sustainable management by local entities. 
 Japan has a long history with an approach like a common land ( iriaichi ) for vil-
lage forests ( satoyama ) and woodlands ( sanrin ), where villagers thinned the trees to 
obtain  ﬁ rewood and charcoal and also procured forest material and fallen leaves for 
use as compost. Each village had its own regulations for use and management of the 
commons, and villagers respected them. These rules played a big role in protecting 
the  satoyama , a landscape of which is shown in Fig.  7.2 . These customs were in 

92
7 The Environment as a Commons: How Should It Be Managed?
place before the establishment of modern law during the Meiji period (from late 
1800s to early 1900s), during which many of the village- or clan-held lands became 
state property. Under civil law, access rights became recognized as real rights and 
villagers were able to possess those rights to log and use these lands. 
 In medieval England, there was widespread use of the three- ﬁ eld system (using 
rotation of cultivated, pasture, and fallow land) of farming in rectangular  ﬁ elds within 
the lands granted by a feudal lord, and there was also a year-to-year rotation of the 
land farmers were allowed to use. Access rights were granted for the forests, pas-
tures, and meadows near the villages to allow grazing, wood collection, and peat 
collection. Grazing rights were valuable, and detailed rules intended to  prevent over-
grazing dictated the type and number of livestock that could be allowed to graze. 
This system ensured that organic material to provide soil nutrients was  circulated 
within the region, and that land productivity was maintained in a  sustainable way.  
 7.2.2  Another Tragedy of the Commons: Neglect 
and Abandonment 
 The original concept of “tragedy of the commons” referred to the excessive use of 
natural resources, but a tragedy can equally occur from lack of use. Before our mod-
ern commercial economies, voluntary rules and contractual relationships among 
community members were often used as social systems to manage the commons 
and ensure a sustainable local supply of resources. These systems made it possible 
to continue enjoying the gifts of nature for free without overexploitation, but with 
the commercialization of the economy many of these systems are collapsing. 
 In sixteenth-century England, the enclosure movement increased the number of 
farmers without access to land as common land was taken into private ownership. 
The growth of the spinning industry had boosted demand for wool, with the result 
that land that previously alternated between use for cultivation and grazing was 
converted into larger pasturelands. The same kind of movement occurred in the 
eighteenth century during the Industrial Revolution.

7.2 Managing Local Commons Sustainably
 In post-War Japan’s process of industrialization and urbanization, the system of 
the local commons ceased to function properly as farming and mountain village 
populations declined and local communities weakened, and at the same time, 
demand for  ﬁ rewood and charcoal decreased, making it unnecessary to thin the 
forests and obtain wood. In Thailand and other countries, commercial logging 
expanded under government guidance, but this led to forest loss and also weakened 
local communities. 
 Japanese farming villages also have a long history of jointly managing farmland 
and pastureland. Many cases remain today as joint-use of forests and joint owner-
ship of forests. The  satoyama and  sanrin were sustainable and excellent systems of 
using nature, managing nature, and protecting nature on shared land. The fact that 
these systems are in decline means that Japan risks losing these long-cherished rural 
landscapes that were places of interaction and harmony between people and nature. 
The threats today, however, are not from the overuse of commons, but rather from 
their neglect and even abandonment. The reason for abandonment is, simply stated, 
a drop in productive value. These are the outcomes of structural changes from indus-
trialization and the failure of government agricultural policies. 
 7.2.3  Ways to Manage the Local Commons 
 If  satoyama and other forms of local commons can survive without being aban-
doned, there are ways to manage them without letting them be overexploited. On the 
other hand, with air pollution, river pollution, and global warming, we are less con-
cerned about their abandonment, but more concerned about overexploitation of 
environment resources as dumping grounds of pollutants and wastes. For issues 
such as global warming, all of humanity must be involved in the management of the 
global commons. In contrast, for a local commons, it is possible for the local com-
munity or a citizen group to guide its management. 
 Many farm lands and pasture lands were lost in England as the Industrial 
Revolution progressed, and people became concerned about the loss of the amenity 
functions of nature. Citizens of London, Manchester, and other cities became active 
in movements to protect open spaces as places of amenity and recreation, and one 
result was the creation of public parks as spaces for public access. It was in this 
context that the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty was 
established in England in 1895. 
 If the regional scope is well de ﬁ ned, the atmosphere and rivers can also be man-
aged as a local commons by local communities. Examples include the water manage-
ment policies of Gujo Hachiman, an historic town in Japan’s Gifu Prefecture, or the 
ban on vehicles powered by internal-combustion engines in the Swiss town of 
Zermatt. Key features where local commons are successfully maintained stably and 
for the long term often include the following: (1) individuals clearly recognize the 
existence of the commons and the community accepts it as legitimate; (2) manage-
ment and monitoring systems have been properly established and the scale is small 

94
7 The Environment as a Commons: How Should It Be Managed?
enough to prevent free riders from exploiting the system; (3) the resources in  question 
are essential for the survival or livelihoods of the local people; and (4) rights and 
obligations relating to the use and management of the commons are fair.  
 7.3  Managing the “Negative Commons” 
 7.3.1  The Negative Commons: Unpopular Facilities 
 We have discussed local commons and global commons, and saw that a local 
commons can be sustainably managed if the local community decides on rules for 
its management. But the commons typically discussed so far has valuable uses as 
a resource, such as common land and public parks. We could label these as “posi-
tive local commons,” which suggests the existence of something we could call a 
“negative local commons.” Examples might include a garbage incineration plant, 
a municipal waste land ﬁ ll, or a reprocessing plant or storage site for nuclear waste. 
As a recent example, we could also mention treatment facilities for toxic chemi-
cals such as PCBs. 
 These facilities all are involved with the treatment of waste and are owned or 
managed by the state, the local government, or a special corporation, so they do not 
strictly meet the conditions for being “public goods” that would involve common 
ownership, common use, or nonexcludable use by individuals. This is simply 
because, for example, in Japan today the latest technologies are being used and the 
government or public sector is entirely in charge of their administration. 
 A common urban sight in developing countries is the scene of garbage simply 
piling up in empty lots, where people dispose of trash as they wish. Japanese cities 
were in a similar condition until the 1960s, and what was labeled the Tokyo Garbage 
War occurred in the 1960s when Koto Ward residents fought to prevent trucks from 
carrying garbage through their neighborhoods to a garbage land ﬁ ll site on reclaimed 
land in Tokyo Bay. If left to their own devices, people may tend to simply throw 
their garbage out anywhere, so disposal sites are established to prevent that, but then 
problems arise with site selection and operation of the facilities. Why? It is because 
the site becomes a “negative local commons.” Facilities such as nuclear power 
plants, airports, and garbage incineration plants are needed for the public bene ﬁ t, 
and people may understand their value, but many do not want such a facility built 
where they live: this is where the term NIMBY or NIMBYISM originated, which 
stands for “Not In My Back Yard.” 
 There are various reasons that someone might not want a facility built in their 
own neighborhood, but one typical reason is the fear that it will be the locals who 
become victims in the event of some kind of accident. The degree and nature of 
fear about facilities differ depending on the facility. For example, with one the 
chance of an accident may be small, but if one does happen the damage may be 
serious. With others, accidents may occur more frequently, but their scale of dam-
age may be minor.  

95
7.3 Managing the “Negative Commons”
 7.3.2  Risk Familiarity Reduces Fear 
 Even though the risk of being exposed to radiation from a nuclear power plant 
accident is less than the risk of X-ray exposure in a medical checkup, experts have 
found that the public in Japan is more afraid of the former; public concerns about 
nuclear accidents mounted after the nuclear crisis in Fukushima in 2011. The prob-
ability of a giant meteor striking the Earth is once in about one million to tens of 
millions of years, so the likelihood of this happening in one’s lifetime is virtually 
nil. The likelihood of getting struck and hurt by a bicycle on the road is much 
greater. Even so, some people are more afraid of being struck by a meteor. 
 American psychologist Paul Slovic has studied public perceptions about the risks 
of extreme events and the big differences between experts and the average person in 
the understanding of risk  [ 7 ] . The word “risk” is itself dif ﬁ cult to de ﬁ ne, but here we 
will refer to it as both the probability of an accident or extreme events occurring and 
the extent of damage in the case of accident. In research targeting American percep-
tions, Slovic identi ﬁ ed two factors in risk awareness: “dread” risk, which is a feeling 
based on the expected extent of damage in the event of an accident, and “unknown” 
risk, which is the lack of knowledge about the situation or phenomenon. 
 Slovic studied 81 subjects and created a conceptual map of the degree of fear 
people felt about the subject and how much (or how little) they knew about the 
subject. Figure  7.3  is a plot of these subjects. Comparing a nuclear power plant 
accident with nuclear war, American citizens are more afraid of nuclear war, and 
believe that they know more about it. Conversely, they do not believe they know 
much about nuclear power. Regarding automobile accidents, even though the 
chance of personally being hurt in an accident is relatively high, individuals think 
they know much about it and are not very afraid. Regarding the risks of drinking 
alcohol and smoking, they feel they know them well and are not very afraid. What 
we can understand from this research is that we have less fear for things that we 
experience on a daily basis. As we get accustomed to something we stop being 
afraid of it, and if we are hearing about it regularly in the media, we begin to think 
that we know a lot about it. For things that people typically do not experience on a 
day-to-day basis, there is a tendency to feel excessive fear, because they do not 
have a direct sense of the probability of an accident occurring or the extent of dam-
age if an accident does occur.  
 7.3.3  Waste Incineration Plants: The Dioxin Problem 
 Waste incineration plants are typical “NIMBY” facilities, but in Tokyo, their emis-
sions stacks punctuate the urban skyline. Because Japan has policies that require 
waste be handled with inside the municipality that produces it, the waste cannot be 
transported elsewhere. In a large metropolis like Tokyo, the only option is to build 
an incineration plant in each ward of the city, even if that means locating the plant 
right beside a business district or residential area. 

96
7 The Environment as a Commons: How Should It Be Managed?
 In the 1990s, the issue of dioxins emitted from incineration plants all over Japan 
became a major public concern, but by replacing the old facilities with those using 
the latest technology, it became possible to reduce dioxin emissions quite rapidly to 
only a few percent of the original levels. In Tokyo today, incineration plant stacks 
are present among the tall buildings, and it seems that waste incineration facilities 
are an accepted part of life in large cities. 
 Plans are being developed to build incineration plants in cities such as Beijing 
and Seoul, but residents there have expressed strong concern and opposition. 
According to comparative research, citizens in Seoul have a stronger sense of dread 
about waste incineration facilities than in Nagoya Japan. This is probably the result 
of fewer cases of incineration plants and a shorter history of having been built in 
Seoul so far compared to cities in Japan. Even though incineration plants are still 
generally disliked by Japanese citizens today, they have had longer experience of 
them being built in their cities and with touring such facilities, so the level of appre-
hension has diminished (Fig.  7.4 ).

7.3 Managing the “Negative Commons”
 7.3.4  Different Approaches for Different Types of Commons 
 Generally, commons could be described as local or global. Global commons 
require international rules such as treaties for their management. Even though 
some people still think that biodiversity issues are more related to the local com-
munity level, there is growing awareness that biodiversity should be managed as 
a global issue, and international treaties have been created to address this issue. 
For local commons that are valued for their potential to be used as “resources”—
such as public parks and village forests—it is possible to avoid  excessive use by 
creating resources  management rules, if the number of parties involved is not too 
large. But Japan today is experiencing the deterioration of some commons such as 
village forests because of the lack of use and the lack of people to manage the 
commons. 
 The environment is often used as a dumping ground for waste (examples include 
air and water pollution, greenhouse gases, municipal waste, and nuclear waste). 
Various ways can be used to control this use including regulations to control the 
disposal of waste, systems for charging fees (environmental taxes, etc.), and sys-
tems that make it mandatory to obtain a right (or permit) for disposal. 
 Nuclear power and waste incineration plants are necessary for the public bene ﬁ t, 
but because citizens are strongly concerned about accidents, such facilities could be 
viewed as “negative commons.” People have a tendency to have excessive concern 
about the risks that they do not experience on a day-to-day basis. Expert data on the

probability of an accident occurring and the extent of damage in the case of an 
 accident occurs are often not effective in alleviating concerns. The Japanese experi-
ence with waste incineration plants shows that familiarity with risk reduces fear.

 8.1  The Dawn of Environmental Economics 
 8.1.1  The Global Environment and Economics 
 Neoclassical economics is a body of economic theory that took shape at the begin-
ning of the twentieth century. It largely ignored the environment for many years. 
Goods and services traded on the market are given or attached a value. Air, water, 
and ecosystems, however, were used as free goods—or virtually for free—so no 
market existed for them  [ 1– 3 ] . They were overconsumed because they had no charge 
attached and could be used any way anyone wished. The result was pollution and 
environmental deterioration. 
 From a fairly early stage, Arthur Cecil Pigou and other economists did, in fact, 
discuss external effects of economic activities—bene ﬁ ts and losses that do not pass 
through the markets—but industrial pollution and other types of pollution did not 
immediately become major topics of research in economics  [ 4 ] . It was during the 
1960s, with the problems of industrial pollution already erupting, that economists 
became aware of the shortcomings of mainstream economic theory. Finally, global-
scale problems such as global warming and the loss of tropical forests triggered an 
awakening, and at last the connections between the global environment and the 
economy came into the spotlight. 
 The global climate system and ecosystems had not been seriously addressed in 
economics until this point, but a new economics emerged in the 1980s, called “eco-
logical economics,” that paid attention to the interconnectedness between the global 
ecosystem and economic systems  [ 5,  6  ] . Under this new  ﬁ eld, scholars began to 
assess the economic value of natural resources such as natural ecosystems and non-
polluted oceans, rivers, and atmosphere  [ 7 ] . “Resource economics” also emerged as 
another sub ﬁ eld of economics. This sub ﬁ eld incorporates into economic statistics 
the inventories of natural resources such as water and forests in countries and

regions, seeks to grasp the material  ﬂ ows associated with economic activities, and 
attempts to analyze the relationship between the economy and impacts on resources 
and the environment. 
 8.1.2  The Branches of Environmental Economics 
 There are two major streams in economics today: modern economics and Marxian 
economics  [ 8,  9 ] . Generally, if the word “economics” is used, modern economics is 
being referred to. The Earth’s size is  ﬁ nite, and the usable resources are also  ﬁ nite. 
Economics is a discipline that considers how to utilize those  ﬁ nite resources, create 
value, and distribute that value that has been produced. The resources referred to in 
economics (i.e., economic resources) include not only natural resources, such as 
timber and mineral resources, but also all factors that can be mobilized to produce 
value, including human labor, knowledge and technological knowhow, equipment 
and facilities, and land. 
 Neoclassical economics—the foundation upon which modern economics is 
built—has become a body of theory that excels in its universality and applicability 
by excluding personal subjectivity or values and instead making extensive use of 
quantitative analysis. With the collapse of the socialist economic systems of the 
former Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries, the popularity of Marxian eco-
nomics appears to have faded. Nevertheless, when considering environmental 
problems, there is still much to learn from Marxian economics and its origins—the 
works of classical economists such as Adam Smith, Thomas Malthus, and David 
Ricardo  [  10 ] . 
 The Industrial Revolution that occurred in England at the end of the eighteenth 
century wrought enormous changes in society. Railroads, made possible by the 
steam engine, enabled the transport of large volumes of goods at great speeds. 
Machines such as the power loom dramatically boosted industrial production. 
Industrial towns such as Manchester and Glasgow grew quickly as more and more 
laborers moved from the countryside to cities to work in factories. Capitalists run-
ning the factories became wealthy, but an increasing number of laborers had no 
choice but to toil under poor working conditions to make a living. The laborers’ 
working and living conditions at that time were poor, and it was common for women 
and children to labor for long hours. Photographs of England’s streets in the nine-
teenth century show rows of chimneys of coal-burning factories and the backdrop of 
skies  ﬁ lled with black smoke (Fig.  8.1 ). 
 Early economics—in other words, classical economics—was born out of these 
conditions in England after the Industrial Revolution. Adam Smith published  The 
Wealth of Nations in 1776. He argued that through the workings of free competition, 
the “invisible hand” of the market would bring the greatest wealth, and this argu-
ment led to the creation of the intellectual framework for the “laissez-faire” approach 
to the political economy. In his treaties  Principle on Population  Thomas Malthus 
discussed the social problems brought about by the  ﬁ niteness of land resources and 

101

population increases. David Ricardo presented the “labor theory of value,” which 
states that human labor generates value and determines the value of products, and 
this line of thought continued on in Marxian economics. Malthus’s debate provided 
the starting point for contemporary debate about limits to growth  [ 11 ] . 
 Today a number of schools and sub ﬁ elds in economics relate to the environment, 
but a broad view of these reveals two main streams. One starts with neoclassical-type 
modern economics and incorporates environmental elements into that structure. 
The other starts with an emphasis on fundamental insights about the value of the 
environment and the signi ﬁ cance of environmental protection. The former, in a sense, 
is based on the orthodox stream of modern economics, and attempts to incorporate 
into economics the environmental elements that previously were treated as external 
diseconomies. In contrast, the latter contends—from a new perspective—with the 
many problems taken up by eighteenth- and nineteenth-century classical economics 
and Marxian economics, and from it have emerged a variety of new branches of 
thought, including “ecological economics” and “entropy economics”  [  12– 17 ] .  
 8.1.3  Market Failure and Environmental Taxes 
 The problems of industrial pollution and other forms of pollution that erupted around 
the world from the 1960s through the 1970s came as a big shock to modern econom-
ics. Until then, economists had almost completely ignored industrial pollution, with

its attendant damage to human health and ecosystems. The neoclassical school’s 
doctrine was that the market was all powerful to realize the optimal allocation of 
resources by the price mechanism: ef ﬁ cient distribution of resources was achieved by 
a balance of the supply and demand of goods being transacted through the market. 
The problem, however, was that damage from pollution was generated without pass-
ing through the market: this is referred to as an external diseconomy. There was not 
a market in which transaction of polluters and victims take place; polluters dumped 
pollution, and victims could not do much about it. 
 Even if it was somewhat unrealistic to believe that the market was all powerful, 
and that every problem could be solved if left to the regulating functions of the 
market, the fact that the problem of pollution occurred in the market economy 
system presented a serious concern. This was a failure of the market, or “market 
failure.” It was as if a weakness in economics had been exposed. Economists sug-
gested that external diseconomies could be incorporated into the economic system, 
however, with environmental taxes and other tools. The market failure could be 
corrected and problems resolved within the framework of the market economy. 
With that, the debate settled down. 
 When pressed to deal with the issue of industrial pollution, economists were able 
to contain this theoretical problem within the framework of economics by using the 
“silver bullet” of environmental taxes. Eventually, however, the scope of debate 
about environmental problems expanded, and a string of new challenges sprung 
forth—global warming, the need for compatibility between human activities and 
ecosystems, the conservation of biodiversity, resource circulation, sustainable devel-
opment, and other issues. To address these challenges, it was necessary to tackle 
them at a more profound level—by considering the global climate system, ecosys-
tem mechanisms, resource recycling, and other phenomena—and actively conduct 
research on these aspects through ecological economics  [ 15,  18 ] . These sub ﬁ elds of 
new science, not con ﬁ ned in the narrow span of economics, offered diverse views 
and deeper insights about the relationships between economic sustainability and the 
regenerative capacity of a resource known as the environment, and about the value 
of biodiversity and other topics. Much of the thinking and debate is still at the 
abstract stage, but it is gradually  ﬁ ltering through society, and in the process 
in ﬂ uencing humanity’s approach toward environmental problems. 
 Meanwhile, one major strength of modern economics is its effective use of the 
tools of numerical analysis. Mathematical models and statistics have facilitated 
quantitative discussions on the economic impacts of global warming and other envi-
ronmental problems. 
 8.1.4  Market and Government Failures 
 The concept of external diseconomies (or “negative externalities”) arose from the 
debate about market failure. We buy what we need on the market, and anything 
bought and sold on the market has a price. But many things are not bought and sold 

103
8.1 The Dawn of Environmental Economics
on the market and therefore have no price attached. Externalities (or “external 
economies”) are positives or bene ﬁ ts that occur outside the market, and conversely, 
negatives or losses are external diseconomies. 
 The rise in local property values when a new train station is built is an external 
economy, but the drop in local property values when a nuisance facility (e.g., a 
waste incineration plant) is built is an external diseconomy. The loss of a work 
opportunity when your commuter train is late because of an accident is also an 
external diseconomy. Market failures associated with environmental protection 
occur for various reasons. However, one major reason is excessive use of a resource 
(i.e., the environment) because it is in many cases a free good that anyone can use 
or access freely, and ownership is not clear, so nobody makes a serious effort to 
preserve the resource. 
 Letting livestock eat as much grass as they like in a communal pasture is for the 
herders an externality. In this case, as suggested in Chap.   7 , it is possible to avoid 
the “tragedy of the commons” by allocating property rights (rights and responsibili-
ties relating to use and management of the commons) to stakeholders. Meanwhile, 
illness caused by air pollution from a factory is an external diseconomy, but if after 
negotiations the factory pays the victims compensation for the damages—even if 
there is some debate about whether or not the amount is fair—the external disec-
onomy becomes internalized. In other words, what was external to the economy has 
now been taken into the market in this case. In reality, however, the factories often 
just continue polluting, and the victims have to pay the price. 
 Market failure should not occur if externalities are successfully internalized in 
the market. Actually, however, another type of failure may occur because of inap-
propriate government intervention. Self-interested administrators wanting to build 
their own power will sometimes enact public policies that are popular but not best 
for the people. Government often operates public enterprises that enjoy a monopoly 
free from market competition. Government trying to meet con ﬂ icting goals often 
enforces multiple measures that contradict one another. Government failures also 
arise as a consequence of the illogics of voting. There are many different kinds of 
government failures as with market failures. 
 8.1.5  Private Costs and Social Costs 
 In the market economy,  ﬁ rms generate pollution while trying to maximize pro ﬁ ts. 
An individual’s self-interested behavior of driving a car causes traf ﬁ c congestion 
and air pollution. Both are negative factors for the economy (external disecono-
mies), and society is forced to bear extra costs because of them. These are called 
social costs, a topic studied by economist Karl William Kapp  [ 19 ] . Hirofumi Uzawa 
is another economist well known for his work on social costs, including those caused 
by automobiles  [ 20 ] . 
 Arthur Cecil Pigou considered social costs to be failures and shortcomings of the 
market economy, and he developed the foundations of “welfare economics,” a branch 

104
8 Economics of the Environment
of economics that addresses ways to resolve these problems within the  market econ-
omy. As shown in Fig.  8.2 , the price and supply of a product will generally be deter-
mined at point A, the intersection of the market demand curve and a  ﬁ rm’s marginal 
cost curve. A  ﬁ rm’s marginal cost curve typically does not include social costs, so 
this is called the private marginal cost curve. The social cost curve is produced by 
adding the social costs on top of the private marginal cost curve. The  ﬁ rm is obtain-
ing unfair pro ﬁ ts because it is not bearing the social costs, so normally the price and 
supply of the product would be at point B, the intersection of the social marginal cost 
curve and the demand curve. Thus, an environmental tax as envisioned by Pigou 
would be a tax imposed on a product that is equal to the size of the gap between the 
social cost and the private cost: this is referred to as a Pigovian tax.  
 8.1.6  Upstream, Downstream, Polluter Pays or Bene ﬁ ciary Pays: 
The Coase Theorem 
 Water resource management in a river basin involves the overlapping problems of 
both external economies and diseconomies between regions upstream and down-
stream. If a forest is well tended in the headwaters upstream, areas downstream will 
have a stable supply of water to use and damage from  ﬂ ooding will be reduced. 
Conversely, if the forest upstream is poorly tended, the water storage capacity of the 
forest upstream will be reduced, and  ﬂ ooding will be more likely to occur down-
stream. Furthermore, if the areas upstream are cleared, developed, and contribute to 
water pollution, the areas downstream will not have access to good-quality water. 
 To manage such a situation, penalties (or surcharges) could be imposed on the 
polluters upstream. Alternatively, parties downstream could pay parties upstream to 
have them conserve the headwater forests or stop development that would cause pol-
lution. The  ﬁ rst approach follows the polluter pays principle (PPP), and the  second, 
the bene ﬁ ciary pays principle (BPP). Another approach is the victim pays principle.

8.1 The Dawn of Environmental Economics
 Economist Ronald Coase presented the argument that whether the PPP or BPP 
approach is taken, the effect (the level of welfare) will be the same for society as a 
whole (the total of all effects on the polluters and the victims)  [ 21 ] . This view was 
labeled the Coase theorem. The best method for society to choose depends on which 
one is easiest for stakeholders to accept. This argument is not valid, however, in 
cases where extra time or costs (transaction costs) are required to reach consensus 
or negotiate among the parties. 
 Many airborne pollutants are carried on the wind to Japan from China, including 
yellow dust from arid regions in western China and photochemical smog. If these coun-
tries were to follow the polluter pays principle, Japan would demand that China pay its 
own costs for preventive countermeasures. Because Japan was the more prosperous of 
the two, however, the most realistic solution was for Japan to provide assistance to 
China to carry out the countermeasures. This could be an example of the victim pays 
principle. On the other hand, if China becomes prosperous enough from economic 
growth, the structure of negotiations could be expected to change in the future.  
 8.1.7  What Is the Value of the Environment? 
 Society generally accepts that the environment is important, should be protected, 
and has value. This brings us to a big question: What is the  value of the environ-
ment? Three main approaches can help us consider this question. The  ﬁ rst approach 
recognizes that the environment itself has intrinsic value. This way of thinking is 
associated with ecocentrism, discussed in Chap.   6 , and one could say it is close to 
being a set of values, almost of a religious nature. Another way of saying this is 
simply to assert that all life on Earth is inherently precious, without forcing a discus-
sion on the economic value of biodiversity, ecosystems, and nature. 
 The second approach attempts to assess the environment for its utility value as a 
resource. This is the approach of modern economics, itself based on anthropocen-
trism. It is important to note that much of the value obtained from environmental 
resources is in fact the effect of external economies (or external diseconomies 
avoided) and cannot be directly measured by market prices. Thus, for example, if air 
and water pollution result in damage to the health of victims, economists could 
attempt to measure the value of  unpolluted air and water based on the avoided medi-
cal costs of treating victims, based on the reasoning that pollution causes the living 
environment to deteriorate. Similarly, the value of forests could be assessed from 
the capacity of the forest to recharge the water supply and provide water resources, 
the avoided costs of  ﬂ ood damage prevented by a forest’s water conservation capac-
ity, the revenues from forests as a tourism resource and source of amenities, and 
other service functions  [ 14 ] . Attempts have also been made to calculate the value of 
biodiversity based on the potential for new drug development from the materials 
extracted from wild plants and animals for Eastern medicine, and other beneﬁ ts. 
 The third approach is to assess value from the perspectives of ecological eco-
nomics and entropy economics. These schools of thought assert that the monetary 
value of the environment is not something to be debated directly, and that the focus 

106
8 Economics of the Environment
of attention should be on the importance of the ecological functions ful ﬁ lled by 
resource circulation on Earth. The global ecosystem, based on plant photosynthesis 
and the circulation of air and water, already has sustainable cycles of material circu-
lation. Entropy economics asserts that humanity must create economic systems that 
do not disrupt the material circulation of nature. This line of discussion is producing 
a growing number of assessments of the negative aspects of current industrial pro-
duction systems that are not compatible with the global ecosystem. This line of 
reasoning is similar to Marxian economics, in that it critically identi ﬁ es the  ﬂ aws of 
capitalism but does little to contribute to economic management in practice. 
 8.1.8  What About Future Generations? 
 In the context of assessing the utility value of resources under the second approach 
just described, a question often asked is this: How should society today consider 
value for future generations? This question is similar to an investment question. 
What is the difference in value between a million yen today and a million yen that 
can only be used in the future, as in the case of a bank term deposit that cannot be 
cashed before maturity? 
 If an annual interest rate of 5% is paid on a term deposit of $1,000 starting today, 
in 10 years it will be worth nearly $1,630: this means that $1,000 today and the 
approximately $1,630 in 10 years have the same value. Conversely, we can interpret 
this as meaning that the future $1,000 is only worth about $610 today in present 
value. This method of evaluating discounts the future value, but how should the 
discount rate be determined? 
 The discount rate is critical when discussing long-term issues. If it is too big, the 
future value (or damage being considered) will be assessed too low, and this effec-
tively means neglecting or ignoring the distant future. In ecological economics, 
some scholars reject the very concept of the discount rate. Others say that it should 
be set as closest to zero. 
 8.2  Environmental Economics and Environmental Policy 
 8.2.1  Environmental Information and Consumer Behavior 
 When we desire or want to purchase a product, it is because we expect some kind of 
satisfaction from that product. In economics this is referred to as utility. Consumers, 
under budget constraints, tend to behave in a way that maximizes utility, using prod-
uct price as the signal. When intending to select a certain product, a consumer has a 
variety of thoughts interacting in the mind. Behind our consumer behavior a variety 
of factors are at work, one of which might be consideration of environmental 
impacts, and consumers weigh these all in an integrated way when deciding whether 
to buy a particular product at a particular price. 

107
8.2 Environmental Economics and Environmental Policy
 How is the price of the environment re ﬂ ected in consumer utility? Consider 
products A and B, which have exactly the same functions but are priced differently. 
Product A is priced high because environmental considerations are adequately 
incorporated into its designs and production process, while product B is produced 
with no environmental consideration, resulting in a low price. Which product will a 
consumer choose? Common sense might suggest that the choice would be for the 
lower-priced product B. In this case, it would mean that consumer is not aware that 
the higher price is required for environmental measures of Product A, and as a result 
selects the cheaper product. 
 Regarding environmental considerations in the product, if the same regulations 
apply to all manufacturers, and the manufacturers observe the regulations to the 
same standard, it would be rational for the consumer’s selection behavior to favor a 
cheaper product. In some cases, however, manufacturers may have voluntarily 
undertaken a variety of environmental measures, having tuned in to a consumer 
preference for environmental protection. In that case, if detailed product informa-
tion is provided, consumers with an interest in environmental protection might 
select the environment-friendly product even if the price is higher. 
 How can anyone determine how environmentally friendly a product is? One 
method to answer this question is a life-cycle assessment (LCA), described in more 
detail in Chap.   9 . This method attempts to assess the environmental impacts embod-
ied in a product, based on the resource inputs, pollutants, and waste generated dur-
ing the life of the product, through production, use, and disposal—from the “cradle 
to the grave.” 
 8.2.2  Green Gross Domestic Product and Attempts 
to Measure Happiness 
 If the economy is strong, products sell well, wages and bonuses increase, and 
 people feel more prosperous. Various indicators are used to judge economic condi-
tions—including the jobless rate, consumer prices, machinery orders received, and 
other indicators—but gross domestic product (GDP) is still used as the most impor-
tant index today. 
 Debate began in the 1970s to challenge the idea that GDP is really the true measure 
of the well-being or happiness of citizens. Japan’s economic growth rate was high at 
the time, but the damage from industrial pollution and deterioration of the natural 
environment made people begin to feel that there was a disconnect between the num-
bers and the feeling of quality of life. Scholars began to consider what became known 
as “green GDP,” which incorporates environmental value into the index. 
 A country’s GDP is ultimately a measure of the total of goods and services pro-
duced in its economy. Production requires the inputs of various factors, including 
labor, capital (including civil infrastructures, factories, equipment and facilities), 
land, mineral resources, and others, but resources such as air, water, and nature are 
almost completely overlooked in typical economic indicators. When a product is 
produced, its value is calculated as a part of the GDP, but any pollution or damage 

108
8 Economics of the Environment
caused by the production process is ignored. Economic statistics today do not 
 calculate the hardship suffered by pollution victims, but do count the increase in 
GDP caused by the payment of a victim’s medical treatment costs. Many feel that 
this omission is not right. Meanwhile, nature (biodiversity, ecosystems, etc.) surviv-
ing in a country generates a variety of environmental services, although their bene ﬁ ts 
are ignored in GDP calculations. 
 Since the early 1990s Japan’s economic growth has been relatively stagnant, and 
the government has done all it can to increase the GDP itself. It seems that the 
debate about a green GDP has lost some momentum. On the other hand, some prog-
ress is being made with discussions about environmental taxes—which attach a 
value to the environment, formerly treated as a free good—and the introduction of 
emissions trading. If ownership and prices were attached to the good we know as the 
environment, then the value of that good would be incorporated into the GDP. 
 8.2.3  Smart Policy Selection 
 Environmental management can be broadly classi ﬁ ed by type of approach: com-
mand and control approaches through legislation, economic approaches through 
market mechanisms, and voluntary approaches by  ﬁ rms, consumers, and other enti-
ties. The following criteria are useful when comparing and selecting a policy mea-
sure for environmental management:
 1.  Effectiveness: Will it achieve objectives for environmental improvement or 
conservation? 
 2.  Ef ﬁ ciency: Is it cost-effective? If different options will achieve the same objec-
tive, the least-cost option is desirable. 
 3.  Equity: Who will bene ﬁ t and who will bear the costs? Is the allocation of costs 
and bene ﬁ ts fair for stakeholders? 
 4.  Administrative and transaction costs: Are the personnel and organizational costs 
for implementation reasonable? Will the time and effort required to achieve con-
sensus among stakeholders be reasonable? 
 5.  Long-term results (dynamic ef ﬁ ciency): Even if there are short-term costs, what 
will be the long-term results through new technological development and inno-
vation? The long-term bene ﬁ ts should be considered. 
 6.  Social acceptance: Can the measure gain the support and agreement of stake-
holders (voters, local community people, corporations, etc.)? 
 Whichever policy measure is selected, it is important to analyze its effects. A 
major element in that review will be analysis of the economic costs and bene ﬁ ts. 
Such a review should also incorporate ways to assess virtual value, because the 
environment may not necessarily be assessed in terms of market value. For example, 
because no market attaches an explicit price to the value of beautiful scenery, com-
fortable cities, or pure air, some assessments determine value from the price people 
are willing to pay (WTP), travel costs, and other survey data. 

109
8.2 Environmental Economics and Environmental Policy
 8.2.4  Equity: Fairness Between Regions, Generations 
 Ultimately, much of the con ﬂ ict of opinion that arises relating to environmental 
issues comes from the issue of equity—different views on fairness in the distribu-
tion of pro ﬁ ts and allocation of costs. With a local commons, the resolution of dif-
ferences is achieved in some cases according to the rule of law, through mediation, 
or a court decision based on national legislation. For the global commons, however, 
humanity does not yet have an effective system to handle matters of this sort. 
 The reality of the global commons raises major issues in terms of inter-regional 
and inter-generational equity. Some developing countries have expressed the view 
that developed countries are the main cause of today’s global environmental prob-
lems, and therefore they oppose any restrictions of their own right to develop them-
selves. Furthermore, the problems caused by current generations will ultimately be 
left behind as a negative legacy or debt that may obstruct future generations’ poten-
tial development, even though they have no opportunity to express their views about 
policy decisions today. 
 The legal concept of justice includes concepts of equity and fairness, but ethical 
judgment of this sort is not addressed openly in economics. For example, the public 
tends to interpret the polluter pays principle with the ethical nuance that the polluter 
is in the wrong and should therefore compensate the victim for damages. In eco-
nomics, on the other hand, the interpretation is simply that for the economy it is 
most ef ﬁ cient for the polluter to bear the social cost of pollution. 
 8.2.5  Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading 
 Under the Kyoto Protocol, to prevent global warming, national targets were estab-
lished for developed countries’ annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The tar-
gets were for a reduction by 2010 compared to emissions in 1990 (e.g., 8% for the 
United States, 7% for the European Union, and 6% for Japan), but the United States 
subsequently withdrew from the Protocol, and it is not certain whether the European 
Union and Japan have achieved their targets (as of June 2012). 
 The fact that emission amounts were settled upon effectively means that permis-
sion is required to emit that amount of GHG emissions into the atmosphere. If a 
large number of entities tried to obtain permission, however, the result would be 
mass confusion. To solve this problem, various ideas were proposed, including the 
use of emission permits and emission rights that could be traded on the market. This 
concept is referred to as “cap and trade,” because a total (cap) is set for emissions, 
and then the rights to emit are traded. 
 The city of Shanghai in China imposed a certain limit on the number of car 
license plates it issued to prevent a rapid increase in the number of private automo-
biles on the road. Now, anyone wishing to buy an automobile must compete with 
others to get a license in the auction market. This stratagem looks very similar to a 
cap-and-trade system. 

110
8 Economics of the Environment
 The initial allocation is the most dif ﬁ cult problem faced when issuing emission 
permits or allocating emission rights. Because many entities already emit GHGs, 
the question is how to deal with existing emitters and with new emitters. One way 
to resolve this problem would be to issue emission permits or emission rights to 
existing emitters for their current emissions, but this would give an advantage to 
those parties who have not made an effort to reduce their emissions until now and a 
disadvantage to those who have already made an effort. Thus, such an approach 
would not be equitable. Exactly the same problem arose when establishing the 
national emission targets for the Kyoto Protocol. Indeed, the Japanese government 
claimed that Japan ended up with a disadvantageous agreement because it had 
already made strenuous efforts for energy conservation during the 1970s and 1980s 
before the protocol was put into force. 
 Discussions are now actively underway both internationally and domestically to 
create detailed framework designs for GHG emissions trading. Sales have already 
begun of carbon credits—a product that represents the GHG emission reductions 
achieved by an entity’s own efforts. For example, if a company replaces its old 
equipment with new, more ef ﬁ cient equipment, and thereby reduces its GHG emis-
sions, it is able to sell credits for that amount of reduction. Conversely, corporations 
that expect to increase their GHG emissions along with increased production are 
able to purchase these credits. This framework is not for emission rights or emission 
permits, but because it involves the trading of emissions achieved or expected (emis-
sion units), it is referred to as emissions trading. 
 Emissions trading is an attractive system that can bring in revenues in the event of 
successful efforts to reduce GHG emissions, but for the system to function, it is impor-
tant to be able to show that the assessment of reductions can be trusted. Thus, besides 
establishing markets to trade credits, it is also necessary to establish systems to audit and 
verify the credits. Within the European Union region, a GHG emissions trading scheme 
(The European Union Emission Trading Scheme, or EU ETS) is already operating. In 
Japan, the Tokyo metropolitan government has introduced its emissions trading  [ 22 ] .  
 8.2.6  Environmental Macroeconomics: Thinking 
the Environmental Implications 
of Environmental Policies 
 Environmental policy such as emissions regulations and global warming counter-
measures generally involves new expenditures, which may slow economic growth 
in the short term. It is therefore not unusual for environmental policies to be 
opposed by those who emphasize the possible negative impacts on the economy, 
although environmental policies can also actually have positive impacts on the 
macro-economy in the long term through technological innovation and structural 
transformations in society and the economy. As for the economic impacts of global 
warming countermeasures, research teams around the world have conducted  studies 
using simulations with macroeconomic models to make predictions; such studies 

111
8.2 Environmental Economics and Environmental Policy
form the basis for some analyses in Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC) reports on future scenarios of countermeasures and their effectiveness. 
Meanwhile, upon request by the British government, economist Nicholas Stern 
(formerly Senior Vice-President of the World Bank) prepared the “Stern Review 
on the Economics of Climate Change” (released in October 2006)  [  23 ] . 
 Often referred to as the Stern review, this report frankly discusses the uncertainty 
and dif ﬁ culty of making future projections on the economy and environment, exam-
ines the risk that the damage from global warming could be more serious than being 
predicted at the time, and concludes that the best strategy would be to take immedi-
ate and decisive action. It states that to avoid the most severe impacts of global 
warming, it is necessary to limit GHG concentrations (counting all GHGs, con-
verted to carbon dioxide equivalent), currently at about 430 ppm, to between 500 
and 550 ppm, and that to do that, annual GHG emissions must be cut from current 
levels by 25% by 2050. The “Stern Review” presents the view that with annual 
expenditures of about 1% of GDP, it would be possible to achieve these reductions 
while maintaining economic growth. 
 The report state that, as speci ﬁ c measures, emissions trading should be imple-
mented, low-carbon and highly ef ﬁ cient technologies need to be developed, forest 
logging should be banned, and so on, but even when the costs of such measures are 
counted, sustainable economic growth would still be achieved. If one assumes that 
the world GDP in 2050 will be about three or four times the current level, GHG 
emissions per unit of GDP must drop to about one quarter of current levels. 
Meanwhile, there are concerns that if temperatures rise by 5°C or 6°C because of 
global warming, the damage could exceed 5% of world GDP, and if we consider 
risks and impacts more broadly, losses could reach 20% of GDP. If it were possible 
to avoid this scale of damage by spending about 1% of GDP per year, the wisest 
choice would be to carry out the countermeasures. 
 8.2.7  Seeking for Win–Win Approaches 
 Human activity in modern society is often considered only in relationship to eco-
nomic activity. In contrast to our self-suf ﬁ ciency in primeval times by gathering 
what we needed from nature, human behavior in modern society is all incorporated 
into the market economy system, which runs on money in many aspects of our lives. 
Economic activity produces wealth when we gather resources from the natural 
world, processing the material with human labor and technology to produce a good 
that has added value, exchange the good for other goods produced, and consume 
them. It is through the adjustment of supply and demand through prices—in other 
words, the market—that this economic activity is most ef ﬁ ciently controlled. 
 The market is not all powerful, however, and it can be argued that a variety of 
problems in the world are the result of market failure. A typical problem is the 
excessive consumption of resources or the deterioration of resources, which can be 
traced to the fact that environmental resources such as air, water, and soil can easily 

112
8 Economics of the Environment
be used by anyone as free goods or almost nearly for free. Pollution of air and water 
are typical examples of these dynamics. We could say that one role of environmen-
tal management is to control, by various measures, the use of environmental 
resources that previously have been treated as free goods. There are two typical 
methods: attaching prices to the environment by imposing taxes or levies, and creat-
ing a market to trade environmental resources. 
 Environment problems and the economy are inextricably connected. If the econ-
omy slows, the purchase desire of individuals weakens, the consumption of energy 
and resources declines, and the burden on the environment is reduced. This reduced 
burden is something desirable for the environment, but other consequences are less 
desirable. People may see their own incomes decline, and may even risk losing their 
jobs. The welfare of society could decline, and public safety may worsen. If all this 
happens, a nation’s top priority would be to somehow revitalize the economy, stimu-
late consumer purchasing, and make various attempts to restore consumption to 
higher levels. This is the nature of the balance, or imbalance, between the economy 
and the environment today. 
 The important thing now is to choose a desirable path for both the economy and 
environment. For this, we need a shift in demand toward products and services that 
are good for the environment. If oil prices stayed at high levels, the worldwide use 
of solar energy and biofuels would increase; these energy sources have not yet 
grown to their potential because their costs are high compared to the price of fossil 
fuels. It is therefore desirable to raise the price of oil, at a rate that does not cause 
sudden disruptions in the economy, to promote more rational use of that scarce 
resource, and also as a measure against global warming. Economies always experi-
ence repeat cycles of growth and recession. The key challenge is to invest in the 
environment even when the economy is in recession, with an eye to the future.

 9.1  Economic Activity, Resources, and Energy 
 9.1.1  Resource Productivity, Energy Productivity 
 Industrial activity today requires the inputs of enormous amounts of natural 
resources, including metals, timber, oil, stone, gravel, and other minerals. In 2004, 
Japan’s nominal gross domestic product (GDP) was 570 trillion yen, matched by 
natural resource inputs totaling 1.7 billion tons: this signi ﬁ es 336,000 yen of GDP 
per ton of natural resource inputs. This measure is referred to as “resource produc-
tivity,” and the national government’s Basic Plan for Establishing a Sound Material-
Cycle Society includes the target of raising this to about 420,000 yen in 2015. 
Meanwhile, in terms of energy, Japan’s primary energy supply was 562 million 
tons (oil equivalent), which means that Japan produced about 1 million yen of 
GDP per ton of oil equivalent energy input. This measure is referred to as “energy 
productivity.” Both resource productivity and energy productivity are improving; 
compared to 1975, the former has improved by a factor of 2.0 and the latter by a 
factor of 1.4  [ 1 ] .  
 9.1.2  Visible and Hidden Resource Flows 
 Resources come in many types of value. Diamonds and rare metals have very high 
value in a small volume, whereas materials such as gravel are bulky and less valu-
able. Rare metals, including rare earth metals, are used in electronic products, and 
even small quantities have tremendous importance in the workings of electronic 
technology. 
 Resources covered by economic statistics and analysis concern only those 
items that are priced and traded on the market. In the case of rocks and gravel, 
only the quantities used as construction material are included in economic

 indicators, although enormous amounts of soil, rock, and gravel are moved about 
at construction sites and through the extraction of buried resources at mines. 
Material  ﬂ ows traded in the economy are considered “visible  ﬂ ows,” but resource 
inputs not recorded in economic statistics are referred to as “hidden  ﬂ ows”  [ 1 ] . 
Examples include the soil excavated at construction sites, the rubble and tailings 
at mining sites, soil eroded from cultivated land, and trees cut down but not har-
vested as timber in logging operations. These hidden  ﬂ ows have also been called 
“ecological rucksacks.” 
 For every ton of coal mined, it is necessary to move about 4.9 tons of dirt and 
rock. For 1 ton of iron, the  ﬁ gure is 5.2 tons, and for copper it is 450 tons. To extract 
100 g of gold, 95 tons of dirt and rock must be moved. The reason that rare metals 
such as gold and platinum are so expensive is that they do not exist in abundance, 
and also that these hidden  ﬂ ows are re ﬂ ected in the price. In the case of rare metals, 
the price re ﬂ ects both the rarity of supply and the dif ﬁ culty of extraction. It is fasci-
nating to analyze the relationship between the price of elements and the amount of 
effort required to extract an element from the environment, or the relationship 
between price and entropy transformation  [ 2 ] . 
 9.1.3  Embodied Energy 
 When a product is manufactured, energy is used as an input into a variety of pro-
cesses, including raw material extraction, production at the factory, and transport. 
If we change our perspective, we can consider the energy incorporated into a prod-
uct or service to include not only the direct energy input to produce and provide the 
product or service to the market, but also the energy incorporated  indirectly through 
intermediate material inputs. This concept is referred to as “embodied energy” and 
is sometimes also called “life cycle energy”  [  3 ] . 
 The inverse of energy productivity indicates how much energy (tons of oil equiv-
alent) is embodied per million yen of GDP. Table  9.1 shows more detail, based on 
an industry sector-by-sector analysis using input–output tables. Figures were 
obtained for 399 industry sectors for the input–output table used, and the same value 
was applied to different products produced in the same industry sector  [ 4 ] . As a 
ballpark  ﬁ gure, a purchase worth 1 million yen (or about 12,000 U.S. dollars) 
involves the energy consumption of about 1 ton of oil equivalent, and about 2.3 tons 
of carbon dioxide emissions (or 1 kg oil equivalent of energy and 2.3 kg carbon 
dioxide per 1,000 yen). Envisioning carbon dioxide in its form as dry ice is a useful 
way to imagine it.  
 If we now consider food, the amount of energy consumed at various stages before 
the food enters our mouths is several times the amount of food calories we take into 
our bodies. For example, fuel is consumed by cultivation equipment, tractors, and 
 ﬁ shing boats, and it is also consumed during refrigeration and canning processes, 
transportation, distribution, and even refrigeration and cooking at home.

 Note : This table shows the results of calculating the kilograms of oil equivalent as energy input, 
and the number of kilograms of carbon dioxide emitted, per thousand yen of  ﬁ nal demand in each 
industry, based on  ﬁ gures from Japan’s 1995 industrial input–output tables (399 categories). 
Conversion for physical quantities can be done by applying these  ﬁ gures to product unit price. The 
same  ﬁ gures are applied to all products produced in the same industry, even if a different product. 
Although there are some differences depending on the item, average is about 1 kg oil equivalent of 
energy input per thousand yen, and about 3 kg carbon dioxide emitted per thousand yen. Envisioning 
dry ice is a useful way to understand carbon dioxide through direct experience 
 When we attempt to reduce energy consumption, we have a tendency to focus 
only on the visible direct energy consumption, but all consumption activities, 
whether related to clothing, food, housing, or whatever, can consume energy indi-
rectly in the form of embodied energy. This awareness of embodied environmental 
loads can also be applied to items other than energy, such as water resources, total 
material input, and other resource inputs, and is very important to help understand 
the meaning of life-cycle assessments (LCAs), as discussed below. 

118
9 Resources, Energy, and Environmental Load
 It is worth noting that Marxian economics use the labor theory of value, which 
states that the price of a manufactured product represents the human labor embod-
ied in the product. Labor, in physics terms, is referred to as “work”; the energy 
source for human labor is food, which is itself solar energy that has been trans-
formed  [  5 ] . Today, however, energy as an input into production is more a matter of 
machines than human labor; thus, the proportion of energy input from fossil fuels 
is overwhelmingly larger than from humans. This is also why, in our economy 
today, the price of products is very much affected by the amount of fossil fuels 
used in their production.  
 9.1.4  Resource and Energy Flows Associated 
with Human Activities 
 A variety of materials are consumed each day to support the survival and activities 
of the average person in Japan today: 1.4 kg of food, 320 l of water, and the equiva-
lent of 2.4 kg oil equivalent of energy (oil equivalent: total includes household 
energy use and automobile use;  ﬁ gures as of 2000). As a result, a variety of waste 
and pollutants are generated each day: 1.1 kg of garbage (municipal waste), 320 l of 
wastewater, and carbon dioxide amounting to the equivalent of 8.8 kg of dry ice. 
 These  ﬁ gures represent the resources and energy associated with direct consump-
tion by individuals, but in addition to these amounts, energy is also consumed by 
industrial and commercial activities. Ultimately all these activities are being carried 
out in support of the human economic activities to make our af ﬂ uent lifestyles 
 possible, so it would be fair to consider the consumption from industrial and 
 commercial activities as consumption on behalf of individuals. Including all those 
numbers would result in quite a large  ﬁ gure per person: daily carbon dioxide emission 
amounting to the equivalent of 30 kg of dry ice or about half of our body weight. 
 To protect the environment, individuals must get a grasp on the quantitative 
amounts of resources and energy they consume, as well as the environmental loads 
generated by their consumption. Then, by making improvements in their lifestyles, 
they must continue making efforts to actually achieve the reductions wherever 
possible. Environmental accounting of households and  ﬁ rms is one way to help 
attain a quantitative grasp of the situation. 
 9.1.5  Urban Activities and Resource Circulation 
 Today about 70–80% of the population in developed countries lives in cities, and 
developing countries are urbanizing rapidly as well. The future of the Earth will 
depend on the future of cities. It is clear that if we are to make our societies on 
Earth sustainable, we must make our cities sustainable. Cities are places many 
people gather to live and engage in economic activities. Cities take in vast amounts 
of resources to sustain those activities and then discharge into the environment 

119
9.1 Economic Activity, Resources, and Energy
(atmosphere, water, and soil) the vast amounts of waste generated through those 
activities. In this sense, cities are like ecosystems as demonstrated in Fig.  9.1 .  
 If a city’s scale of activities becomes too large, then material and energy cycles 
cease to function properly, constraining the city’s further economic growth and 
causing a variety of environmental problems. This situation resembles the city hav-
ing poor blood circulation, similar to a blockage of the blood vessels. Therefore, the 
 ﬂ ows of resources and energy, as well as the amount of waste generated from these 
 ﬂ ows, are important indicators for the environmental impacts of urban activities on 
the environment  [ 6,  7 ] . 
 The physical components of a city include housing and commercial buildings as 
well as roads and other forms of infrastructure. Activities in a city include the vast 
 ﬂ ows of people, goods and materials, energy, and information. Thus, the inside of a 
city is like the mesh of a network—roads, rails, water and sewer lines, electrical and 
gas grids, and communications lines. 
 These networks, if compared to the human body, are similar to the networks of 
blood vessels and nerves: the equivalent to blood and nerve signals  ﬂ owing through 
the system would be materials, energy, and information. The arterial blood  ﬂ owing 
from the lungs circulates through the body and picks up waste matter from each part 
of the body as it becomes venous blood. In the body, the liver, kidneys, and other 
organs are charged with the role of processing the waste matter. The equivalent in a 
city would be the environmental facilities such as water puri ﬁ cation plants, sewage 
treatment plants and garbage treatment facilities.

 9.1.6  Ecological Footprint 
 To sustain those activities, those within cities depend heavily upon resources from 
outside. Much of the food ingested by city residents is transported from outside the 
city (as illustrated in Fig.  9.1 ). Enormous amounts of soil, water, fertilizers, chemi-
cals, equipment and machines, and fuel are consumed to support the af ﬂ uent food 
habits of urban citizens. Canadian economist William Rees proposed the concept 
“ecological footprint” to represent the total land required to supply the food and 
timber products used in a city, in addition to the forest land needed to absorb the 
carbon dioxide generated by the city  [ 8 ] . 
 The area of London is 1,580 km 2 . Some researchers found the city’s ecological 
footprint to be an amazing 125 times that  ﬁ gure, equivalent to 80% of the total land 
area of England  [  9 ] . The result for Tokyo and other Japanese cities is roughly similar. 
Japan imports almost half of its food from overseas, and uses an enormous amount 
of land, water, and other resources overseas to produce its food and timber.  
 9.1.7  Transportation, Environmental Burden, 
and Compact Cities 
 Mobility, or freedom of movement, is a basic human demand. Thus, the number of 
cars on the road is increasing rapidly, even in developing countries with relatively low 
per-capita incomes. As cities spread out and cover more land area, it is necessary to 
connect areas within cities to each other, and also cities to other cities, via ef ﬁ cient and 
rapid transport systems. To this end, many cities in Europe and North America devel-
oped networks of subways, trams, and buses, starting at the end of the nineteenth 
century. During the twentieth century, however, with the rise of the automobile, cities 
were created that depended completely on personal car transport—and they are char-
acterized by having lower population density and being decentralized  [ 10 ] . 
 Thus, transport is a critical topic to create cities with low environmental impacts. 
First, innovative automotive technologies must be developed to dramatically 
improve fuel economy. Second, there should be a shift away from the use of private 
cars in favor of public transport. Third, cities themselves must be redesigned to 
increase the ef ﬁ ciency of energy use—including not only transport systems but 
also land use, city layout, and citizen lifestyles. Partly in response to the shrinking 
population and the aging of society, local cities in Japan are moving toward com-
pact-city designs that involve less horizontal movement. They are doing this by 
zoning for taller buildings and concentrating more land uses into the city center 
that were previously allowed to spread into the suburbs without any master plan. 
The city of Aomori in northern Japan is one such example where new approaches 
to planning are being used. 
 Older cities in Europe are also trending toward compact-city designs, bringing 
back tram systems and introducing new light rail transit (LRT) systems. Meanwhile, 
the urban planning trend in younger cities in developing countries is still to pro-

121
9.2 Life-Cycle Assessment
mote car dependency. Some cities are expanding without any clear vision of urban 
development, and even though their road infrastructure is already inadequate, the 
number of cars on the road is increasing rapidly. Without a change in course, energy 
consumption and carbon dioxide emissions can only increase.  
 9.1.8  Environmental Resource Accounting and Material 
Flow Analysis 
 The variety of things traded as economic goods are actually natural resources that 
have been transformed, so we could say that natural resources are the ultimate 
source of economic activities. Despite that, modern economic statistics incorporate 
virtually no data about natural resources. To rectify this, efforts are being made to 
incorporate accounting for natural resources into the system of national accounts 
(SNA), which provides economic statistics; discussions are underway about how to 
incorporate statistics on the stocks and  ﬂ ows of natural resources, including forests, 
soil, water, air, biodiversity, and other environmental elements. Known as natural 
resource accounting, this is closely connected with “green GDP”  [ 11 ] . With these 
kinds of statistics, we can expect that together with regular reporting on economic 
activities we will also have access to statistics on the loss of forests, changes in 
quantity and quality of water resources, changes in air pollution, degradation of soil, 
and so on. At the moment, however, this work is still at the research stage in many 
countries and international organizations  [ 12– 14 ] . 
 The Japanese government  [ 1 ] has announced national targets for resource pro-
ductivity, and research is actively being conducted into material  ﬂ ow analysis 
(MFA), which analyzes resource inputs into and outputs from economic activities. 
Conventional MFA has paid attention to material quantities, but there are limitations 
to assessments based on quantity alone. For example, some dioxins are extremely 
toxic, even in miniscule amounts. For this reason, research is being conducted 
focusing on the properties of substances. 
 9.2  Life-Cycle Assessment 
 9.2.1  What Is an “Environmentally Friendly” Product? 
 In recent years, people often see products that advertisers claim are environmen-
tally friendly, or eco-friendly. Let us consider what “environmentally friendly” 
really means. Some brands of household appliances on the market—televisions 
and air conditioners, for example—consume less electricity, and in effect emit 
fewer carbon dioxide emissions, while offering the same features and functions as 
other products. However, many consumers pay more attention to the price than to 
these claims. A salesperson at an appliance shop may tell a customer that even 

122
9 Resources, Energy, and Environmental Load
though a certain product is more expensive than another, the customer will save on 
electricity charges because the product is energy ef ﬁ cient and thus in the end is a 
better deal. 
 If we wish to consider whether the product purchased is truly environmentally 
friendly, we should consider not only it usage at home, but also whether the factory 
polluted the air and water in the product’s manufacturing process. Going even fur-
ther, we would also have to consider the parts and raw materials used in the product, 
because pollution has been discharged through the mining, extraction, transport, 
and re ﬁ ning processes associated with the iron, copper, aluminum, and other metals 
in the product. 
 The question of whether something is environmentally friendly is not just a prob-
lem relating to individual products. There are many problems relating to technological 
systems that support society. For example, which is better: a highway or a railroad? A 
densely planned city with tall buildings or a decentralized city with many single-
family homes? Waste incineration or material recycle of waste? Actually, because of 
a lack of clear assessment yardsticks to compare such alternatives, in many cases the 
conclusion will differ, depending on the method of analysis and assessment. Let us 
consider this problem now, by examining the idea of a LCA, developed to assess the 
environmental performance of products.  
 9.2.2  LCA of Products 
 A LCA, stated simply, is a way to assess the total environmental impacts of a prod-
uct over its entire life, “from the cradle to the grave.” For a given product, it involves 
all stages from the resource extraction through product manufacturing, transport, 
use, and disposal, conducts a quantitative assessment of the environmental impacts 
generated and interpret their implications for the local and global environment and 
ecosystems. For manufacturing processes, the calculation of environmental burden 
includes the mining and extraction of raw materials for making the product, as well 
as their transport, and the manufacturing of equipment and facilities used in manu-
facturing processes at the factory  [ 15– 18 ] . 
 For products, in principle, the assessment is to enable the comparison of items 
that offer similar functions and services. For example, for a consumer good or con-
sumer durable, such as a television, for instance, a comparison might be made 
between an LCD screen and plasma display of the same size; for automobiles, it 
might be between a gasoline-powered car and a hybrid car of the same size. For 
product LCAs, this point should be strictly observed. Similar products providing a 
certain equivalent service must be compared. It would be dif ﬁ cult to make a com-
parison if the functions are completely different, for example, as comparing a televi-
sion and a car. 
 Environmental household accounting systems have also been developed to record 
the items purchased and money spent for them and to analyze the environmental 
impact caused by consumer behavior of individuals. In this accounting system, LCA 

123
9.2 Life-Cycle Assessment
data can be incorporated for various commodities and wastes. If manufacturers were 
to publish data about many products, individuals would be able to better assess the 
products they have bought. 
 9.2.3  To What Can LCA Be Applied? 
 As a pioneering example of LCA, the Coca-Cola Company conducted an assess-
ment when plastic bottles made from polyethylene terephthalate (PET)  ﬁ rst appeared 
on the market in 1969. This was a comparative analysis to determine which was 
better—a returnable glass bottle, or a throwaway PET bottle. It was in 1991 that 
LCA came into broader use, and this was because the International Organization for 
Standardization (ISO) began work to consider the topic. The ISO’s focus in the area 
of LCA is on products, and it has produced agreed-upon guidelines for ensuring that 
information is objective and standardized, to facilitate comparisons of data from 
different countries and corporations  [ 13,  14 ] . 
 The principle of comparing items that offer the same functions and services is 
important to ensure that evaluations are objective, but there is a gray zone in their 
de ﬁ nition. For example, a comparison of wine and beer is not entirely impossible 
for the same amount of alcohol, but it would not be possible to compare differences 
in strength and taste. Meanwhile, there is much demand for comparisons of the 
environmental friendliness of technological systems. Examples of such compari-
sons might be between an aircraft and a high-speed train for a roundtrip between 
Paris and London, or the comparison between a coal- ﬁ red thermal power plant and 
a nuclear power plant. Furthermore, other themes to study in the future include 
assessments to provide input when improving urban infrastructure and facilities, 
such as roads, rail, and waterworks. These assessments might cover the total burden 
on the environment from present to the future, including construction and transport, 
maintenance, and operation. 
 9.2.4  Life-Cycle Inventory Analysis 
 The  ﬁ rst step of an LCA is a life cycle inventory analysis, which is concerned mainly 
with the work of gathering and calculating concrete data. Data are collected about 
the resource and energy inputs associated with the manufacturing, use, and disposal 
stages of the target product, as well as the product produced and waste emitted, and 
then a type of input–output table is prepared relating to resources and environmental 
burden (Fig.  9.2 ). 
 The conventional way to do this is the bottom-up method, which involves calcu-
lations after listing all the details on the parts, materials, and manufacturing pro-
cesses. The question of how much detail to pursue for each item depends on the 
level of detail obtainable in data for each item. There are certain limits on the extent 
of what can be determined by this method, so a country’s input–output tables are 

124
9 Resources, Energy, and Environmental Load
often used in tandem. If input–output tables are used, however, the number of 
classi ﬁ cations of items is limited to the number of sectors in the input–output tables 
(about 400 for Japan), because all products produced in a certain industry will be 
treated in the same way. 
 After the inventory analysis, the next step is a life cycle impact assessment, 
which is an analysis and assessment of the size and importance of each impact, 
based on the inventory analysis data, for each separate category of environmental 
impact (for example, global warming, air pollution and eutrophication). 
 Finally, the foregoing results are evaluated, interpreted, and summarized in a 
report, in a form that is compatible with the original objectives and scope of study, 
and then a critical review is conducted to con ﬁ rm whether the adopted methodology 
and data are reasonable and scienti ﬁ cally valid. 
 9.2.5  Life Cycle Impact Assessment 
 In reality, LCAs in many cases do not go beyond the inventory analysis stage, 
because no absolutely reliable method yet exists for impact assessment. Actually, 
this is not only a problem with product LCAs, and in fact is the cause of confusion 
and debate about the comparison of various technology systems, so let us discuss 
this in more detail. 
 There are many types of environmental impacts. Some are global and affect the 
entire world, such as global warming and ozone depletion. Others are on a regional 
scale spanning several countries or an entire continent, such as acid rain. Still others 
are relatively con ﬁ ned to a certain area, such as air pollution in a city, or eutrophica-
tion of a river or lake. Even if the focus is on just one product, the impacts are broad 
and deep, and it would be extremely dif ﬁ cult to provide a de ﬁ nitive answer to the

question about the priorities, for example global problems or localized problems. 
The category of greenhouse gases includes not only the much-discussed carbon 
dioxide, but also other substances. For instance, chloro ﬂ uorocarbons (CFCs) are not 
only ozone-depleting substances but also a cause of global warming. Thus, a proper 
impact assessment should be developed to address such complex relationships. 
Discussions are still underway on many points such as this, but the framework for 
analysis is generally moving in the direction explained below. 
 The  ﬁ rst is a classi ﬁ cation according to the type of environmental impact—global 
warming, ozone layer depletion, local air pollution, eutrophication, and other issues. 
The second is characterization of each classi ﬁ ed environmental impact—an assess-
ment of the relative importance and role of each emission. For example, in the case 
of global warming, it is possible to evaluate the roles of various greenhouse gases in 
relationship to their global warming potential (GWP), which is the strength of the 
greenhouse effect based on molecular structure. In the case of eutrophication, there 
is an assessment method available using algal growth factor (AGF). The third is an 
integrated assessment using a system of weighting of different impacts. 
 Regarding the  ﬁ nal point, weighting, there are attempts to develop an indicator 
to evaluate problems that are completely different in character and in detail, and 
this issue presents some dif ﬁ cult questions. For example, there is the question of 
whether it is possible to summarize in a single indicator the importance of meat, 
rice, and vegetables as food. An initiative is underway to decide on priority levels 
using questionnaire surveys on public perception on the relative importance and 
weight of different environmental factors, but there is still much debate about how 
far this can be satis ﬁ ed. 
 In Japan, the Industrial Policy Research Institute is proposing the “Life-cycle 
Impact Assessment Method Based on Endpoint Modeling” (LIME), which con-
verts all environmental impacts to monetary terms and expresses them in numbers. 
At present, there may be no more convenient method to assess impacts, so under 
the circumstances it might be a practical option, but it is important to be aware of 
its limitations when applying it.  
 9.2.6  LCA: Good, But Not Perfect 
 Thanks to ISO’s initiatives to promote standardization, great strides have been 
made relating to LCA for products in terms of data preparation and interpretation 
and other assessment procedures. If we look at LCAs impact on the behavior of 
industry players and consumers, however, one could say that the situation today is 
still not ideal. We must improve consistency in the conditions for comparative 
analysis, system boundaries or spatial and temporal extent of analysis, compati-
bility of background data, impact assessments and interpretation, and improved 
methodology is still underway. 
 Anyone who tries to conduct an LCA immediately must encounter the shortage 
of data. In many cases, data must be borrowed from elsewhere, which means that 

126
9 Resources, Energy, and Environmental Load
there is little guarantee of their reliability. Published corporate data in some cases 
consist of the results only, and the actual details may be guarded as secret or 
con ﬁ dential. There is also confusion relating to environmental impacts and inter-
pretation. If we look at only one aspect and ignore others, it is possible to come to 
different conclusions than if we looked at another aspect. 
 LCA can only be effective if we identify products with equivalent functions, and 
then focus the debate on the aspects that are different. When working with different 
functions, it is necessary to properly consider the properties of products, system 
boundaries, and data compatibility. 
 9.3  Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation 
 9.3.1  Japan and the United States: Options Differ 
 The discussion in Chap.   6 suggests that a major challenge for this century will be 
the creation of the low-carbon society. Let us consider the issue here from a 
 perspective of energy. 
 Energy problems involve two dimensions:  ﬁ rst, the development of alternative 
energy sources to replace fossil fuels, particularly oil; and second, the improvement 
of energy use ef ﬁ ciency. In his inauguration speech in January 2009, incoming 
United States’ President Barack Obama declared, “We will harness the sun and the 
winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories.” But is this possible? The 
Bush Administration took a negative stance toward action on global warming, but 
the fact is that the United States possesses enormous potential for the development 
and use of renewal energy, including photovoltaic power generation in the vast des-
ert areas of Arizona and Nevada, wind power generation in Texas and California, 
and biofuels from corn grown in the agricultural belt of the Midwest. 
 In his speech, President Obama declared that Americans will “build electric grids 
and digital lines,” and “restore science to its rightful place,” but made no mention of 
nuclear power, nuclear fusion, or space development. In terms of wind power, 
Germany is currently number one in the world with 21.8 million kW of capacity, 
followed by the United States, with 16.8 million kW. The total power generation 
capacity of Japanese electrical utilities is about 230 million kW, but of that, wind 
power generation provides only 1.67 million kW (1,409 windmills) (all  ﬁ gures as of 
end of 2007). Ideal sites for wind power generation are places that have consistently 
strong winds such as in Shimokita Peninsula, Aomor (Fig.  9.3 ), but the rotors make 
noise, so there are strict constraints on where wind turbines can be installed; thus, 
Japan does not offer much development potential for this type of energy. 
 Meanwhile, biofuel development potential is also limited in Japan, as the country 
imports 40% of its food, so whether we should use farmland for biofuel production 
is a question. The most promising options in Japan are the greater use of solar energy, 
and improvements in demand-side ef ﬁ ciency in energy use—in other words, energy 
conservation. Biomass could also be important as a means to utilize the  forests, 

127
9.3 Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation
which account for 68% of Japan’s land area. President Obama’s declaration that he 
would use renewable energy to fuel cars is perhaps a re ﬂ ection of the American car-
based society, and the mention of running factories may appeal to Americans’ love 
of big things. Japanese aesthetics and special skills reside more with small and deli-
cate things. The common expression  mottainai  (dissatisfaction about waste when 
something’s intrinsic value is not properly utilized) is also an indication of traditional 
Japanese character. The potential for energy conservation in Japan depends on the 
Japanese inclination for these things. We certainly hope that President Obama’s poli-
cies emphasizing the environment will succeed. But Japan, a country with only one 
twenty- ﬁ fth the land area of the United States, must take a different approach.  
 9.3.2  Solar Power: Large-Scale Centralized, 
or Small-Scale Decentralized? 
 The amount of solar energy entering the Earth’s atmosphere at a perpendicular angle 
amounts to 1.37 kW/m 2 ; this  ﬁ gure is referred to as the solar constant. After entering 
the atmosphere, solar energy is absorbed and scattered by molecules of air. The solar 
energy that reaches the ground is the sum total of the amount that reaches the ground 
 directly  (direct insolation, which  can  be focused by a lens) and the amount that 
reaches the ground after being  scattered  in the atmosphere (diffuse insolation, which 
 cannot  be focused by a lens), and this is called the net surface solar irradiation. 
 Direct insolation in February in Matsumoto (on the Japanese island of central 
Honshu in Japan) amounts to 0.93 kW/m 2 (value for perpendicular rays). The Direct 
insolation might feel hotter during the hot summers, but if one were to measure the 
perpendicular rays, the value is higher in the winter, thanks to the clearer air. Net 
surface solar irradiation is affected by the latitude and weather conditions at each 
location, but the average for all of Japan is 0.14 kW/m 2 . This is the value for a hori-
zontal surface, and in fact is the average of all daytime and nighttime hours for the 
year, so it is only about one tenth of the solar constant. Today, the ef ﬁ ciency of 
 Fig. 9.3   Wind power stations in Shimokita Peninsula, Aomori, Japan 
 

128
9 Resources, Energy, and Environmental Load
 photovoltaic power generation is about 20%, so to obtain 1 kW of electricity, about 
35 m 2 of surface is required if that surface is horizontal. This value of total solar 
radiation on the right may seem small, but 1 km 2 of land receives 140,000 kW, 
which is not so small. A surface of 100 km 2 receives 14 million kW, so photovoltaic 
cells rated at 20% ef ﬁ ciency would produce 2.8 million kW, which is comparable 
with the output of a nuclear or thermal power plant. 
 The building of large-scale solar power plants (e.g., mega-solar power plants) 
using so much land area, however, is not always practical in Japan. Japan has a high 
population density and a small amount of open land, so one good option might be to 
use every available sun-facing wall and roof on homes and buildings to generate 
power. The problem, however, is that power generation and electricity use  ﬂ uctuate 
with weather conditions and time of day or night. 
 Solar energy exists in great abundance, but there are still obstacles to using it 
effectively. To begin with, the upfront cost of equipment is high. Furthermore, as the 
supplied amount of energy with weather conditions, many technical issues remain 
when it comes to using solar together with power supplied by electrical utilities. In 
the past, the Japanese power system was built based on the need for ef ﬁ ciency by 
constructing large power plants, but in the future it will be necessary to also con-
sider incorporating small-scale distributed systems. To turn all this into a stable 
system, Japan will have to invest in new energy infrastructure. If the problem of cost 
could be overcome, technological constraints would pose no serious obstacles, but 
the fate of solar power will likely be determined by the price of fossil fuels and the 
degree of urgency and action on global warming countermeasures, and, further, 
concerns about the risks of nuclear power plant accidents. 
 The use of solar energy has tremendous potential in developing countries that do 
not yet have large-scale centralized power distribution systems. This point can be 
appreciated if one considers how the use of wireless mobile phones has skyrocketed 
in developing countries, which were delayed in their installation of infrastructure of 
 ﬁ xed-line telephone networks. It is exactly because extensive power distribution 
systems do not exist, conversely, that it is probably easy to build electrical power 
systems on a small, local basis. Meanwhile, in regions that are late embarking on the 
path of economic development, a simple device known as a solar cooker is an excel-
lent solution. This is a device with a parabolic mirror about 1.2 m in diameter that 
focuses and collects solar heat for cooking. It is an interesting method. 
 9.3.3  The First and Second Laws of Thermodynamics 
 Energy has various uses, but one of the largest categories of energy demand in the 
residential and commercial sectors is for room heating and cooling, and for hot 
water supply. These requirements utilize energy in the form of heat, but in reality, it 
is wasteful to use high-quality sources of energy such as oil and electricity just for 
heating. Heat is a low-quality form of energy present all around us. Its effective use 
is the key to energy conservation in the residential and commercial sectors. 

129
9.3 Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation
 People often talk of “consuming” energy or “consuming” electricity, but these 
expressions actually contradict the  ﬁ rst law of thermodynamics (or the law of energy 
conservation). Energy is always conserved; electricity consumed to do work is sim-
ply converted into heat. It is not possible, however, to convert all the energy that has 
been changed to heat back into energy to again do work. This is the second law of 
thermodynamics (or the entropy law). 
 Let us explain the second law of thermodynamics in basic terms. There is high-
quality energy and low-quality energy, and when energy is used the  amount of 
energy does not change, but its  quality will always deteriorate. Low-quality energy 
is dif ﬁ cult to use even if one wishes to use it effectively, as it is in an inconvenient 
form. Oil and electricity represent high-quality forms of energy: they can easily be 
used to power automobiles and motors. Low-quality energy such as the heat in hot 
water, for example, cannot be easily used to move something. After oil or electricity 
has been used, the energy deteriorates into the low-quality energy that takes the 
form of heat. 
 9.3.4  Subdivided Energy: Dif ﬁ cult to Use 
 We have described heat as a low-quality form of energy, but let us consider what 
that means. The true identity of heat can be described as the kinetic energy of atoms 
and molecules that form an object. A ball thrown into the air will lose speed to wind 
resistance and eventually fall. The kinetic energy in the ball is lost to air friction, but 
a large portion of that becomes kinetic energy in air molecules, raising the air tem-
perature by an imperceptible amount. We could say that some of the mechanical 
energy of the ball has been dissipated as heat. 
 One key to understanding the dissipation of energy is the difference between the 
macroscopic and microscopic degrees of freedom. The things we use in day-to-day 
life are macroscopic objects, such as balls and pencils, for example. The mechanical 
energy of macroscopic objects (kinetic energy and potential energy) is determined 
by their velocity and position. In contrast, the microscopic degree of freedom relates 
to the position and momentum of atoms and molecules that make up the object. The 
objects we handle day to day, no matter how small, are made up of atoms and mol-
ecules that number on the order of Avogadro’s constant (6 × 10 23 ). 
 The true nature of heat is energy distributed with the microscopic degree of free-
dom of huge numbers such as this. It is as if energy has been separated into a count-
less number of pieces. If energy that was distributed with a macroscopic degree of 
freedom is distributed into a countless number of molecules, then it all becomes 
dissipated, making it impossible to completely recover: this is because the number 
of atoms and molecules making up the object is astronomically large (the number of 
degrees of microscopic freedom). In a way, the law of increasing entropy uses this 
astronomically large number to play a trick. 
 A person holding a thousand dollar bill can make a meaningful purchase, but if 
that same amount of money is distributed among 1,000 people, each person receiving 

130
9 Resources, Energy, and Environmental Load
only 1 dollar, no one will be able to purchase anything of great value. If 10,000 
people receive only 10 cents per person, their options are even less. The total amount 
of money has not changed, but the buying power of the individual portions becomes 
almost useless. To make one large purchase someone would have to gather together 
the dispersed money, but that would not be easy to do. The dissipation of energy as 
heat is similar to this. 
 9.3.5  Exergy: Available Energy 
 Heat is present in the world around us in many forms, such as in the water left after a 
hot bath, for example, or  ﬂ owing out of the heat exhaust of air-conditioning equipment. 
The quality of energy of this heat is not high, but the amount is large. Thus, one impor-
tant challenge to improving environmental technology is to  ﬁ nd ways to effectively use 
this heat. The concept of “exergy” is useful when considering these matters. 
 Generally speaking, the term  exergy refers to the amount of energy that can be 
extracted from an object by exploiting differences in condition between the object 
and the external environment. The hotter an object, the more thermal energy it 
 contains, but to extract that energy it is necessary to use a temperature difference 
with the surroundings (i.e., a low-temperature heat reservoir). If the temperature 
difference is zero, it is not possible to extract heat, regardless of how hot the object 
is. The exergy would be zero and it would not be possible to convert the heat into 
work. In other words, the amount of energy that can be effectively extracted from an 
object is determined by the temperature of that object and the temperature differ-
ence between it and the surrounding environment. Thus, the amount of exergy is 
determined by the relationship of an object with its surrounding environment. 
 For instance, the amount of exergy of water at 50°C is different when the sur-
rounding air is 0°C compared to when the air is 30°C. When the outside air tempera-
ture is 30°C, the temperature difference is 20°C, but when the outside temperature is 
0°C, the temperature difference is 50°C. It is therefore in the latter case that the 
energy that can be effectively extracted from the water—the exergy—is larger. This 
example focuses on the temperature difference between an object and its surrounding 
environment. Conditions in which the surrounding environment has higher pressure, 
or higher concentration, also have exergy. Moreover, when the surrounding environ-
ment has a lower temperature, lower pressure, or lower concentration, these are 
 conditions in which energy can be extracted by using the difference in conditions 
between the object and the surrounding environment, so they also contain exergy. 
 Many things in the world around us contain unutilized exergy. For example, the 
wastewater discharged from households into the sewerage system has a higher 
temperature than the local river water. Snow that has fallen during the winter, if 
piled up and stored under cover until summer, will have a temperature lower than 
its surroundings. In each case, exergy exists because of the difference in tempera-
ture. Exergy is also present in the different salt concentrations where freshwater 
and saltwater mix. 

131
9.3 Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation
 Energy, entropy, and exergy—all these terms come from Greek origins.  En is a 
pre ﬁ x that means “in” or “within.” If we attach  ergon , which means “function, task, 
or work,” we have  energy (latent power to do work); if we attach  tropy , which means 
change or transform, we have  entropy (qualitative changes caused within something 
or internalize change). Finally, if we add the pre ﬁ x  ex , meaning “outside” or “exter-
nal,” to  ergon , we get  exergy . In other words, exergy is energy that can be drawn out 
of something. 
 9.3.6  Ef ﬁ cient Use of Energy Using Heat Pumps 
 The heat in the hot water after a bath cannot easily be used to operate a machine, but 
it can be put into a hot water bottle to keep a person warm. The best way to use the 
low-quality energy effectively is to use heat as heat. Heat pump technology is for 
exactly this purpose, and it is employed widely in household air-conditioning and 
refrigeration equipment. Air conditioners and similar equipment contain a type of 
substance used as a refrigerant. Examples include chloro ﬂ uorocarbon (CFC) gases—
which became a problem because of their destructive impact on the Earth’s ozone 
layer—and their alternatives (CFC alternatives). When changing state from liquid to 
gas (vaporizing), refrigerants take heat from their surroundings, and conversely, when 
they change state from gas to liquid (condensing) they release heat to the surround-
ings. One property of gases is that their temperature drops from adiabatic expansion, 
and on the other hand temperature rises from adiabatic compression. 
 When a compressor forces a refrigerant to alternately expand and compress, the 
refrigerant’s temperature falls and rises. If a refrigerant in a cool, condensed state is 
put into an object warmer than the refrigerant, the refrigerant will take heat from the 
object. Conversely, if a refrigerant in a warmer, vaporized state is put into contact 
with an object cooler than the refrigerant it will transfer heat to the object and be 
condensed. By repeating this cycle, it is possible to take heat from a low-temperature 
object and transfer it to a high-temperature object. From the perspective of a cool 
object, this is cooling, but from the perspective of a hot object, this is heating. 
 The amount of heat that can be transferred by a heat pump is several times larger 
than the work energy required to operate the compressor. This statement may appear 
to violate the law of conservation of energy, but actually it is only transferring heat 
as heat. The main point is that the energy is not being converted into work. To do 
work with a steam engine, for example, high-temperature steam is needed, and for 
this it is necessary to burn coal to heat water. In contrast, the thermal energy required 
to heat or cool a building is needed only to maintain the room temperature. Calculated 
in terms of exergy, the amount of thermal energy required is small—an amount that 
a heat pump can easily draw from the surrounding environment. 
 Thus heat pumps are ef ﬁ cient, because they do not heat the air directly, in con-
trast to electrical or oil heaters. To understand how a heat pump works, let us 
consider the concept of “Carnot ef ﬁ ciency” for a moment. Nicolas Léonard Sadi 
Carnot was a French scientists who, in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth 

132
9 Resources, Energy, and Environmental Load
centuries, studied the question of the maximum amount of mechanical work that 
can be extracted using the temperature difference between two objects, one a 
high-temperature heat source (absolute temperature,  T 1 ), and one a low-tempera-
ture heat source (absolute temperature,  T 0 ). He reached the conclusion that the 
maximum amount of work  E that can be extracted from the thermal quantity  Q 
transferred from a high-temperature heat source to a low-temperature heat source 
could be calculated by the following equation, where   h is the Carnot ef ﬁ ciency.

 The principle of the heat pump makes use of the reverse of the Carnot cycle. That 
is, instead of extracting work  E by transferring heat  Q from a high-temperature 
source to a low-temperature heat source, by having an external source do the work 
 E (i.e., for moving a compressor), the heat  Q is transferred from the low-tempera-
ture heat source  T 0 to the high-temperature heat source  T 1 . The amount of heat 
transferred  Q divided by the electricity consumed  E produces the coef ﬁ cient of 
performance (COP), whose theoretical limit is the inverse of the Carnot ef ﬁ ciency 
(1/ h ). Figure  9.4 illustrates the principle of the heat pump. 
 In Japan, a government-sponsored award program called the “Top Runner” pro-
gram was launched to recognize products, such as automobiles and household 
appliances, that have the best energy ef ﬁ ciency in their category, and it is helping to 
dramatically improve the ef ﬁ ciency of air conditioners and refrigerators in this 
country. The COP value of air conditioners has increased from about 3.0 in 1990 to 
6.0 today (2009) as a result. Even in cold places such as Hokkaido in northern 
Japan, the temperature below ground is almost constant year-round; in winter it is 
considerably warmer than the air temperature outdoors. In such a region, it is pos-
sible to draw heat from the ground using a heat pump and use it to heat a room. 
 9.3.7  Biomass Energy 
 In the past, the main fuels used in Japan were  ﬁ rewood and charcoal. The amount of 
carbon stored in trees growing in Japanese forests varies depending on the tree 
species, but is generally about 60–100 tons/ha. Assuming an average of 80 tons/ha, 
and assuming that about 70% of Japan’s land area is covered by forests, the total 
would be about 2 billion tons. This is a rough indication of the amount of carbon 
sequestered (not counting the amount contained in forest soil) in forests in all of 
Japan. Incidentally, Japan’s carbon dioxide emissions amount to about 370 million 
tons (in terms of carbon equivalent) per year. If we assume an average tree age of 
30 years, the annual amount of carbon  ﬁ xation is about 70 million tons, but this is 
only if the amount of logging is in balance with the amount of tree planting, so the 
net increase or decrease would be zero. 

133
9.3 Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation
 The Japanese government’s Kyoto Protocol Target Achievement Plan declares 
the intent to use tree planting to achieve a 3.8% reduction (13 million tons) as part 
of the national 6% emissions reduction target from 1990 levels, but this has to 
come from planting of new trees, so this plan will not be so easy to achieve. As the 
previous numbers indicate, even if Japan managed all of forests properly, the usable 
amount of timber would be a maximum of about 70 million tons (carbon equiva-
lent). In reality, forest management in the mountains is dif ﬁ cult work, and after 
subtracting the amount of energy used for logging operations, plus transporting 
and processing the timber, the net amount of usable biomass from forests is not as 
large as one would hope, although there is good potential for using it in local cities 
closer to the forests. 
 In addition to wood and charcoal, other forms of biomass include food waste 
(kitchen waste, food leftovers, unused food, etc.), sewage sludge, and animal waste. 
These wastes can be fermented to produce methane, which can be mixed with 
municipal natural gas and then used. Until the 1970s, many households in India 
used simple systems to produce methane from human waste for use as a cooking 
fuel, but such systems have almost completely disappeared. 
 Modern cities have installed technology systems such as large-scale sewage sys-
tems, garbage incineration plants, and electricity and gas supply systems, making it 
dif ﬁ cult to use decentralized resources and energy at the level of the individual or 
household. The human waste collected at the sewage plant could be used as a raw 
material to produce methane, but because it is not pro ﬁ table at present, little prog-
ress is being made with this use of the sewage sludge. Methods also exist to produce

 methane from kitchen waste in urban garbage without incinerating it, but in Japan, 
municipal waste is incinerated for sanitary reasons. 
 One of the problems with the technology systems that sustain modern society is 
that once they have been installed, they cannot be easily changed. Even if a new 
system is superior, change is still dif ﬁ cult, because modi ﬁ cations of the installed 
system will result in some waste of previously invested funds. In this sense, it is 
worth noting that developing countries may have more  ﬂ exibility than developed 
countries when it comes to introducing new technology systems because of their 
later development. 
 9.4  Environmental Choices: Not Simple 
 9.4.1  Criteria for Comparative Assessments 
 Debate often rages about which products and technology systems are better for the 
environment, or what are their most desirable characteristics. Actually, this question 
may not be so easy to answer. To begin with, when making a comparison, one chal-
lenge is sorting out the conditions or criteria. An automobile and a television have 
different functions, so it is dif ﬁ cult to compare the two. When making comparisons 
it is essential to discriminate the functions, and it is important to carefully consider 
to what extent that is even possible. 
 Next comes the issue of the reliability of the data being used. It is not always 
possible to obtain reliable data about the various aspects of a product or technol-
ogy system. Without the cooperation of companies it is dif ﬁ cult to obtain reliable 
 ﬁ gures on the amount of resource inputs or environmental impacts per unit of 
production of a product or material. Even if data have been provided, it is often 
extremely dif ﬁ cult for an outsider to verify their reliability, so collaboration for 
data collection and improvement and information disclosure from industry are 
essential. 
 The biggest problem is that there is no consensus yet on how to interpret the 
data on the use of resources or the generation of environmental impacts. In the 
case of LCA, even if the inventory analysis has been done properly, the next 
problem is how to do the impact assessment. In many cases, depending on the 
assessed categories, the results of the assessment will differ. It might be possible 
to impose some kind of weighting system on the assessment categories, based 
on public opinion surveys, for example, to standardize the assessment items, as 
done in LCA, but there are many divergent opinions on this. There is also the 
problem of deciding how far to go in considering the spatial or time scales of the 
impacts. 
 Furthermore, people do not choose products or technology systems just based on 
the environmental dimension alone, so it is necessary to conduct integrated analyses 
together with other factors, such as convenience and economic ef ﬁ ciency. 

135
9.4 Environmental Choices: Not Simple
 9.4.2  Top-Down Management for Macro-level Objectives, 
Informed Choice for Micro-level Behavior 
 In day-to-day life, many people have probably experienced times when they were 
frugal on the little things, but wasteful on the big things. When buying little 
things we may pay attention to a difference of even 1 yen, but when shopping for 
large items we might be less careful about price. Similar things occur when 
selecting products. It is certainly a good thing to pay attention to the environmen-
tal friendliness of each separate product. Economic systems, however, consist of 
countless intricately interrelated factors. Something that we thought may have 
been good on one dimension, may, through a variety of linkages, have unfore-
seen negative impacts. 
 Modern economic theory on consumption and production asserts that the self-
interested actions of consumers and producers will result in the optimum and 
most ef ﬁ cient resource allocation. Consumers with limited budgets make choices 
about the goods they purchase in such a way as to maximize their utility. One 
person, instead of spending money on food, might prefer to save money for cloth-
ing, and another person might make the opposite choice. That freedom of choice 
is up to the individual, but because they have budget constraints, it is not possible 
to purchase more than their  ﬁ nite funds permit. When making choices on the 
purchase of each time, consumers choose the things that they believe will make 
them happiest, based on the limited information in their possession, even if they 
sometimes feel it is dif ﬁ cult to decide. It is not assumed that all individuals will 
behave in the same way; in fact, that diversity of individuals’ behavior is one of 
the excellent aspects of the market economy. Ultimately, consumer behavior also 
has an impact on the behavior of the producers that supply the products, so if 
proper competition exists among producers, each will establish the product 
development strategy they believe to be best. 
 It is worth noting that the essential element for the market to function 
ef ﬁ ciently is correct information. The behavior of individuals who have better 
information will gradually have an effect on producers and on other consumers. 
For the bene ﬁ t of the environment, it is desirable that consumers purchase prod-
ucts that are environmentally friendly, but it is dif ﬁ cult to forcibly control con-
sumer behavior, and moreover, it is not practical to attempt to do so. The important 
thing is to provide information that consumers can rely on, and then leave the 
decisions up to their rational choice. 
 These days, the quality and quantity of information held by consumers relating 
to the environment is rising dramatically, and producers are also paying attention to 
the environment as a factor that can enhance product appeal. It is important to main-
tain momentum in this direction. At the same time, society as a whole must set 
carbon dioxide emission reduction targets, by country and by region, establish 
macro-level management targets for things such as resource productivity, and mobi-
lize everyone to  ﬁ nd ways to achieve those targets. 

136

 9.4.3  The Role of Government in Choosing Technology Systems 
 The foregoing discussion applies to cases in which consumers have the freedom to 
make the choice, but when it comes to the selection of technology systems for soci-
ety, it is governmental policies and decisions that play the most important role. For 
example, in designing cities that will have low energy consumption, the urban plan-
ning normally decided by municipal governments is extremely important in terms 
of land use, public transport, building design, solid waste management and con-
struction and maintenance of public infrastructures  [ 7 ] . 
 Policy decisions by governments, particularly for public works projects, should 
consider the environment, keeping many issues in mind as already stated. 
Governments must conduct a careful examination of the details of alternatives, 
data quality and availability, and choice of environmental indicators and interpre-
tation. Depending on which criteria are given the greatest priority, assessments 
could lead to completely different conclusions. Ultimately, in many cases the 
decision is made based on analysis using currently available information, and in 
the face of considerable opposition. In some cases it eventually turns out that the 
 ﬁ nal decision was not the best choice, and at that point it is sometimes not possi-
ble to modify the choice.  
 9.4.4  Waste: Incinerate or Recycle? 
 Another topic of debate on waste management today is whether to recycle waste 
or incinerate it. This is another area that has no agreed universal standards for 
evaluation, so it is possible to come to the opposite conclusion depending on 
which aspect is considered. Many different opinions have been expressed on 
these topics. For example, some say it is economically more rational to inciner-
ate garbage and use the generated electricity or heat, because the necessary 
labor and high costs mean only a small amount of salvageable goods can be 
recycled, especially if materials separation and collection are done by hand. 
Others say that resources should be recycled and not incinerated at any cost. 
Still others say that precious resources should be recovered as a hedge against 
future resource shortages, and that research and development should be encour-
aged for this purpose. 
 The Japanese government has decided on a policy with the following prioritiza-
tion for the handling of waste: re-use, reduce, and then recycle, and then the  ﬁ nal 
option of “thermal recycling” (in other words, incineration). The  ﬁ rst three items are 
the famous “3Rs” (or three Rs). In natural ecosystems all materials are recycled as 
material, and “thermal recycling” does not exist (although  ﬁ res do occur from time 
to time). On this point, there is a difference between material circulation in the natu-
ral world and the technology systems of modern industrial societies. In fact, the 
Japanese government made thermal recycling the last choice after the 3Rs because 
of a desire to have arti ﬁ cial material circulation be as close to that of the natural

world as possible. Indeed, this philosophy is very strong in Germany, which could 
be considered the world leader for policies relating to sound materials circulation. 
 Another reason for the necessity of thermal recycling is that humans are creating 
toxic substances that will not decompose easily in nature. PCBs are one such exam-
ple. One ground to discourage thermal recycling is to create a disincentive for creat-
ing these types of toxic substances in the future. The petroleum-based plastics so 
popular today do not decompose easily in the environment either, and even if recy-
cled, do not produce products of any particular value. It is hoped that starch-based 
biodegradable plastics will become more popular in the future. 
 The 3Rs and thermal recycling can be compared from the perspective of various 
considerations, such as cost, energy consumption, carbon dioxide emissions, and 
other factors. In some cases it may be that with current technologies and costs, the 
3Rs may not be the best choice. In those cases, we need to remember that the con-
clusion is based upon currently available technologies and cost structures. Options 
that may seem unfavorable under present day economic and technological condi-
tions may actually be rational choices in the future, if seen from the perspective of 
proactive future economic and technological changes. 
 9.4.5  Using Environmental Information to Make 
the Right Choices 
 Considering Japan’s land and climate characteristics, solar power is the most prom-
ising renewable energy, but to promote its use, Japan must modify existing systems 
to make centralized systems and distributed systems work complementarily. For 
industry as a whole to conserve energy, in many cases each industry or corporation 
must make its own efforts. In the residential and commercial sectors, technological 
improvements for energy conservation—particularly for heat demand are likely to 
be effective in the following areas: high-ef ﬁ ciency insulation in buildings, air-tight 
building designs, and heat pumps. 
 Regarding the environmental impacts of products and technology systems, it 
is now possible to produce relatively reliable inventory analyses for each envi-
ronmental category. The problems, however, are with interpretation of the 
 ﬁ ndings. An ef ﬁ cient way to achieve environmental objectives is to set macro-
level environmental management targets on the level of the state, municipality, 
community, and citizen group—relating to national carbon dioxide emissions, 
resource productivity, and waste recycling, etc—and at the same time, to allow 
freedom of choice for the micro-level behavior of corporations and consumers. 
To make all this happen, the role of accurate and relevant environmental informa-
tion is very important. 
 The 3Rs (reduce, reuse, and recycle) may sometimes seem to be impractical 
choices in the short term, but it is important to think in the long term, with a view to 
technological developments that will make them more viable in the future.

 10.1  Asia in Transformation 
 When thinking about present and possible future environmental problems in Asia, 
it is clearly worth examining and learning—from both the positive and negative 
perspectives—from Japan’s history of environmental issues that arose in the 
 process of this country’s industrialization  [  1,  2 ] . Although countries in Asia include 
both early and late starters on the path of industrialization, they tend to follow a 
similar pattern of development, even if the delay is a few decades—and the time 
lags are rapidly shrinking. 
 The recent history of economic development is brief in Asian countries, and the 
fruits of prosperity are not yet being distributed equitably within some countries. 
Thus, the income gap is tending to grow between urban and rural populations and 
between regions that develop early and those which develop later. While city dwell-
ers are enjoying high-consumption lifestyles, many poor rural villages still do not 
even have electricity or running water. In many cases, the force of the waves of 
development in poor regions destroys not only the local environment but also tradi-
tional culture and the very basis of livelihoods in local communities. This situation 
causes problems for the management of local forests and other commons that have 
long been sustained, until now, by the local communities. 
 Some of Asia’s problems can be resolved by economic progress, but that type of 
progress also causes new problems. Some of these, for example, will be industrial 
pollution stemming from the production activities of corporations, while other 
dif ﬁ culties will relate to urban sanitation and drinking water issues. The drivers and 
causes of these problems are already known, and the menu of response technologies 
is also readily available. If a certain percentage of the funds that corporations and 
governments obtain through economic progress was made available for steady 
investment to improve the environment, then constant improvements would be pos-
sible. If this is not being done, then it is a sign of serious problems with the ability 
of governments to effectively do their job.

10 Japan and an Asian Perspective
 Developing countries should be aware, however, that developed countries have 
experienced not only successes but also many failures; if they follow exactly the 
same paths as developed countries, they will inevitably repeat the same mistakes. 
Thus, Asian countries have some advantages in starting to industrialize later: by 
studying the experiences of developed countries, it should be possible today to plot 
the most ef ﬁ cient path to progress. 
 10.2  Asia and Globalization 
 The concept of “globalization” is an agglomeration of the values of contemporary 
Western society—faith in the market economy, liberalization of trade, capital, and 
investment, democracy, scienti ﬁ c rationalism; industrial modes of production, 
and so on. 
 Many Japanese would probably agree that all these ideas mean acting in accor-
dance with a Western style of economic system and sense of values. Moreover, 
fully accepting these things has meant reluctantly relinquishing parts of their own 
culture and values. But some people wonder if these types of economic develop-
ment, production, consumption, and lifestyles—originating under the leadership of 
the Western countries and currently spreading around the world—are good for the 
global environment. Today’s global economic issues are making us ask new ques-
tions and strive to rethink these problems. 
 Some suggest that the key to considering a path of sustainable development in 
harmony with the environment this century is to reexamine traditional Eastern 
cultures and values in relationship—or in contrast—to those of the West. If glo-
balization is going to further promote Western-style (particularly, American) 
systems of production and consumption, as well as the values upon which they 
are based, then this can only mean the destruction of social and cultural 
structures in Asia that have long been embodied in local traditional lifestyles, 
customs, practices, and values. 
 Economic globalization and the spread of market-based economies are destroy-
ing traditional rural village societies and local communities in Asia, as societies 
shift from an emphasis on strong local and family connections to becoming more 
individualistic. It will be important for Asia, buffeted in the middle of this huge and 
seemingly unstoppable tide of globalization, to learn from the noteworthy prece-
dents established in the United States and European countries, and then to develop 
approaches that apply better to our own conditions. On this point as well, a good 
question to ask is this: What and how can Asia contribute? Here, at the same time, 
we must consider that Asia consists of a number of countries with different cultures, 
religions, political systems, and natural conditions, and we must be aware of their 
diversities and the dif ﬁ culties in reaching a consensus about the directions and goals 
of their development.

10.3 Common Concerns, Cooperation, and the Future
 10.3  Common Concerns, Cooperation, and the Future 
 The author wrote the  ﬁ rst draft of this book early in 2009, with the world in the 
midst of an unprecedented economic crisis, making it dif ﬁ cult to easily forecast the 
future of both Asia and the rest of the world. Nevertheless, as a general trend, along 
with its rising industrial production, in this century Asia will probably account for a 
larger part of the global economy than it has in the past. At the same time, with its 
huge use of resources for industrial production, plus consumption by the large Asian 
populace (Asia has 50% of the world’s population, and East Asia alone has 30% of 
the global total), this region may end up having the greatest impact on the global 
environment. 
 Nations such as China, India, and the members of the Association of South-East 
Asian Nations (ASEAN) have been able to achieve remarkable economic growth 
since the early 1990s, thanks in part to investment from overseas. Along with eco-
nomic growth came new problems such as industrial pollution, water shortage, poor 
sanitation and resource constraints, but progress has been made in handling these 
needs. However, no country will ever be completely free of such problems. 
 It is clear that we cannot talk about East Asia without also talking about China, 
whether it concerns land area, population, projections of future economic size, or 
other topics. It is worth noting that of total global carbon dioxide emissions in 
1990 from fossil fuel consumption, the United States accounted for 23.3% and 
China for 11.1%, whereas in 2009, the United States was at 18% and China had 
grown to 24%. China’s carbon dioxide emissions  ﬁ rst surpassed those of the 
United States in 2007, and it is predicted that Chinese emissions will continue to 
increase. Furthermore, ASEAN is an important player, as the combined popula-
tion of member countries is larger than the populations of either the European 
Union or the United States. The future of the environment in East Asia will prob-
ably be largely determined by tripartite relations within the region among China, 
ASEAN countries, and Japan, plus the in ﬂ uence of the United States across the 
Paci ﬁ c Ocean. Likewise, we must pay special attention to India when we talk 
about South Asia. 
 There is also no doubt that competition for the growing Asian market will inten-
sify between Western countries and Japan. This will also likely be the case with the 
transfer of environmental technologies. Although Japan has been proud of its 
advanced environmental technologies, it cannot claim to have a monopoly on them. 
Also, all need to recognize that what Asian countries need are low-cost technologies 
that are easy to maintain and operate. It is also worth noting that China and other 
countries are beginning to show promise in their own development of technologies 
in this  ﬁ eld. 
 Environmental problems in the twenty- ﬁ rst century are shared problems that 
Asian countries must face together. It is important to recognize the importance of 
the role of environmental technology transfers and funding grants that promote 

142
10 Japan and an Asian Perspective
speci ﬁ c areas. The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), used as a measure to 
counter global warming, is one example of new joint efforts beginning between 
developed and developing countries. 
 From a larger perspective, we will realize that the region has enormous growth 
potential. As we move forward, it will be extremely important to seek harmony 
between the environment and the economy. Thus, a key challenge will be the further 
development of environmental studies that can contribute to efforts to contend with 
both environmental and economic problems in this region. 
 10.4  Japan After the Great Disaster 
 10.4.1  Triple Disasters 
 The aim of this book was to explore environmental problems together with readers, 
and we touched upon environmental policy issues in Japan from place to place, but 
Japan today is facing even tougher problems than before. 
 The disaster that occurred in eastern Japan in March 2011 involved an earth-
quake, tsunami, and an accident at a nuclear power plant, causing tremendous dam-
age in a wide area along the coast. In all, 16,000 persons lost their lives, and many 
homes, buildings, and workplaces were also lost. The economic and social impacts 
were profound. The Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) that caused the 
nuclear accident in Fukushima supplies electricity to the Kanto region, which is 
central to the Japanese economy, and covers the metropolitan area around Tokyo 
having 42 million people. Immediately after the disaster, the entire Kanto region 
was plunged into a severe power shortage. Factories and of ﬁ ces had no choice but 
to restrict their business activities. Households in some areas also had to endure 
scheduled power outages to save electricity. 
 The disaster had interrelated, profound, and complex impacts on Japan in three 
dimensions: economic, energy, and environment. The question of how to secure a 
stable supply of electricity, and the question of what should be the future mix of 
electricity sources, these are critical issues for the nation’s economic and energy 
policies, but they now also have an enormous bearing on environmental policy. 
 Japan hosted the Third Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change in 1997, and since then has been making an effort to 
achieve the targets agreed upon in the Kyoto Protocol. The country has studiously 
prepared and implemented measures to achieve the national emission reduction tar-
gets for greenhouse gases, as agreed under the Kyoto Protocol. It was also developing 
a plan to achieve the medium-term national target of a 25% reduction in total green-
house gas (GHG) emissions by the year 2020, and was preparing a road map to that 
end. That scenario, however, was premised upon greater dependency on nuclear power 
as indicated by the national energy supply and demand forecast. Currently, many 
nuclear power plants in Japan are not operating. If this situation continues, the assump-
tions underpinning the future GHG emissions reduction scenario may collapse.  

143
10.4 Japan After the Great Disaster
 10.4.2  Economy Versus Environment Again 
 A country with almost no fossil fuel resources of its own, Japan has placed an 
emphasis on securing stable sources of energy, and on the stable supply of electric-
ity. Japan’s overseas payments for the import of fossil fuels has been on a rising 
trend, and in 2010 exceeded 20 trillion yen, this amounted to 4.5% of the nation’s 
gross domestic product. Many are concerned about the large burden on the Japanese 
economy of rising energy prices caused by the increase in international fuel prices, 
and nuclear power was seen as a quasi-domestic source of energy. Thus, the nation’s 
long-term plans for energy supply and demand have assumed that there would be a 
stable use of nuclear power. A stable supply of electricity is a life-and-death matter 
for industry, which explains the industry’s support for the use of nuclear power. The 
public, too, accepted the myth of the safety of nuclear power, even while harboring 
some concern about accidents at nuclear plants. 
 Today, after the accident, Japanese public opinion is dramatically split on the 
topic of nuclear safety, and some are strongly calling for the complete abolition of 
nuclear power. In the midst of huge uncertainties arising about power supply capac-
ity, hopes for initiatives to move toward a low-carbon society are pinned on large 
increases in the ef ﬁ ciency of energy use, and these are also compatible with the 
move toward nonnuclear energy. This approach is compatible with the direction of 
policies such as green innovation, which aims to realize a virtuous cycle between 
environment and economy, the green economy, and green growth. Technologies that 
are crucial for the creation of a low-carbon society include those such as renewable 
energy, notably photovoltaic power generation, as well as smart houses and smart 
grids, which use advanced information and communication technologies. 
 Before the disasters, there was little serious debate about nuclear issues in 
Japan in the context of creating a low-carbon society. After the disasters, public 
debate began to cover a broad range of perspectives including nuclear issues. 
However, there is a large divergence of opinion, depending on the region and on 
the person. Clearly the greatest common factor to resolve all issues is that it is 
desirable to shift toward lifestyles, business styles, housing, buildings, electrical 
equipment and devices, and transportation systems that consume the least possi-
ble amount of energy.  
 10.4.3  Inter-regional Equity Concerning Nuclear Power Plants 
 There is a disparity in the perception of risks of nuclear power between the residents 
living near nuclear power plants, who have a heightened level of safety concern, and 
the residents of large cities located at some distance from the plants. For reasons of 
local economic and employment bene ﬁ ts, some residents living near nuclear plants 
support the operation of nuclear power on the assumption that this is safe and 
bene ﬁ cial for the local economy. 

144
10 Japan and an Asian Perspective
 There are similarities among the nuclear power plant sites in Japan. All of them 
are near the coast, and all are in sparsely populated areas. Nuclear plants are a 
source of anxiety for communities where they are located. To ease this anxiety to 
certain extent, large sums have been paid in subsidies to municipalities that accept 
nuclear plants, and to their neighboring towns, and those funds have helped to vital-
ize the local economies to a certain extent. The reality is also that nuclear-related 
work creates employment. Local agreement is required to build a nuclear plant, but 
this is seen as an important matter of national economic and energy security, and the 
ultimate decision-making authority rests with the national government. As a result, 
the situation is that consent has been bought by money, under the strong will of the 
national government and power utilities seeking to build nuclear power plants. 
 Pronounced differences in the perception of nuclear power have appeared 
between the central government and the regional communities hosting the power 
plants, and also between the people in those host regions that supply the electricity 
and the people who mostly live in large cities where the electricity is consumed. 
Before this situation can change, there is a need to discuss the equity issues among 
different regions and different people and to rede ﬁ ne the purpose, necessity, and 
signi ﬁ cance of creating the low-carbon society.. 
 10.4.4  Centralized Versus Decentralized Approach 
 Until now, initiatives about low-carbon cities were based upon the major premise of 
a comprehensive national energy strategy decided by the central government, 
 supported by industry, and an electrical supply system premised upon nuclear 
dependence. Japan’s electricity supply system is operated by nine power utilities 
that enjoy regional monopolies. Problems with the conventional electricity supply 
system designed with the highest priority on stability of supply were often pointed 
out in the past, but in the face of the enormous in ﬂ uence of both government and 
power utilities, questions and criticisms were drowned out. 
 The power utilities have been unenthusiastic about the Renewable Portfolio 
Standard (RPS) system, by which power utilities are required to purchase renewable 
energy such as solar, wind, and geothermal power. Although the system has been in 
effect since 2003, the purchase prices have been kept low based on the power utili-
ties’ assertion that the supply capacity is variable and unstable. The disaster, how-
ever, has created the opportunity to reexamine these longstanding issues. A shift is 
being considered from this RPS system, to be replaced by a “feed-in tariff” system, 
under which power utilities are expected to purchase electricity at a price  ﬁ xed by 
the government. Higher purchase prices will provide a larger incentive to develop 
renewable energy power. The deployment of renewables, however, takes time, and 
its short-term capacity is limited. 
 For the creation of low-carbon cities, before the Great East Japan Earthquake, 
it was assumed that the power mix and price of electricity were matters for the 
national governments and power utilities to decide, and municipal governments 

145
10.5 Environmental Policy Facing Social Transition
had no room to make adjustments. Since the disaster, an idea gaining momentum 
is that to be prepared for emergencies, cities should not rely entirely on electric-
ity from the power utilities’ grid, but should also use the maximum amount of 
energy available from within the city, The challenge is how to create low-carbon 
cities, while also paying attention to economic, energy, and environmental secu-
rity at the local level: 
 In response to the increasing demand for GHG emission reductions under 
national and local government policies, private companies are developing new tech-
nologies and business models that could serve as a starting point for an alternative 
energy infrastructure. The calculations of return-on-investment from nuclear power 
do not properly include the costs incurred for the treatment of nuclear waste and the 
huge cost of damage compensation once an accident takes place. If the true costs 
and security risks of nuclear power technology were correctly accounted for, solar 
power would be relatively less costly. The generation and provision of electricity 
from renewable energy sources requires the dissemination and use of certi ﬁ cation 
systems such as green energy certi ﬁ cates. New technologies for electricity storage 
by using batteries of Electric Vehicles (EVs) may bring about drastic change in 
energy supply systems in the future. Information technology is also becoming the 
center of interest as a basis for controlling energy demand and allowing the reduc-
tion of supply, as well as for increased ef ﬁ ciency in the transport sector. 
 As the majority of energy used in households is for heating water, there is an idea 
that it would be more cost effective to invest in solar water heaters instead of the 
costly photovoltaic panels. The target of subsidies, whether it be photovoltaic panels, 
solar water heaters, or co-generation technologies, will be considered based on their 
extent of distribution and citizens’ demands. There are institutional barriers to the 
introduction of new energy management solutions. Smart grids and renewable energy 
are assumed to come in tandem, but in reality, peak cuts through the use of electricity 
storage technologies would suf ﬁ ce to overcome energy shortages in Japan without 
using renewables. However, there is a regulatory barrier to the development and 
 distribution of new technologies such as electricity storage devices using EV. 
Regulatory reforms should thus be the center of debate to address not only energy 
issues effectively but also promote low-carbon cities and eco-cities  [  3 ] .  
 10.5  Environmental Policy Facing Social Transition 
 Japanese society is aging at a rapid pace, and it is projected that in 2050, 40% of the 
overall population will consist of seniors 65 years of age and older. The challenge 
for the country is to maintain the dynamism of society while also creating cities and 
regions where seniors can live safe and healthy lives. 
 Since the Great East Japan Earthquake, Japanese energy and environmental 
 policy has been in disarray. Even before the damage caused by the disaster, urban 
planning concepts in Japan have been in the midst of dramatic change, in response 
to a declining population, fewer children, and an aging society. The situation in 

146
10 Japan and an Asian Perspective
the areas affected by the disaster is like a mirror re ﬂ ecting the current situation 
in regions of Japan outside the large cities. Years before it started to happen in 
large cities, those areas already had fewer children and more elderly. There, it is 
essential to promote integrated policies for the local economy, employment, 
health, and welfare. 
 In a sense, Japanese society is approaching a mature phase today. The Japanese 
economy is starting to lose the dynamism and vigor that it had during its period of 
rapid economic growth, and people are generally satis ﬁ ed with the quality of their 
air, water and natural environment—which are visibly cleaner and greener than they 
were 20 or 30 years ago—and are enjoying lifestyles of material suf ﬁ ciency. People 
are demanding safety and security today rather than conspicuous af ﬂ uence. The 
public is aware that the choice is not between environment and economy, but that it 
is possible for both to have a favorable impact on each other, in a positive cycle. 
 With the reality of a disaster so dramatically evident today, the importance of 
local communities and the importance of people-to-people solidarity and mutual 
support has been recon ﬁ rmed. These observations can give us hints about the role of 
community in creating a low-carbon society.
