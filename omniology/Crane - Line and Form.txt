PREFACE
AS
in
the case
of
" The
Bases
of Design,"
to which
this
is intended
to form a com-
panion volume,
the
substance
of
the
following
chapters
on
Line and
Form
originally
formed
a
series of lectures delivered
to
the students of
the Manchester Municipal School of Art.
There
is
no
pretension
to
an
exhaustive
treatment of a subject it would be difficult enough
to exhaust, and
it
is dealt with in a way intended
to bear rather upon the
practical work of an
art
school, and
to be suggestive and helpful to those
face to face with the current problems of drawing
and design.
These have been approached from a personal
point of view, as the results of conclusions arrived
at
in
the
course
of a busy working
life which
has
left but few
intervals
for the elaboration of
theories apart
from
practice, and
such
as
they
are, these
papers
are now
offered
to
the wider
circle
of students
and
workers
in
the
arts
of
design as from one of themselves.
They were illustrated largely by means of rough
sketching in
line before my student audience,
as
well as by photographs and drawings.
The rough
diagrams
have
been
re-drawn,
and
the
other
illustrations reproduced, so that both line and tone
blocks are
used,
uniformity being
sacrificed
to
fidelity.

OUTLINE,
one might say,
is the Alpha and
Omega of Art.
It
is the earliest mode of
expression among primitive peoples, as
it
is with
the individual child, and
it has been cultivated for
its power of characterization and expression, and as
an ultimate test of draughtsmanship, by the most
accomplished artists of all time.
The old fanciful story of
its origin in the work
of a lover who traced in charcoal the boundary of
the shadow of the head of his sweetheart as cast
upon the wall by the sun, and thus obtained the first
profile portrait,
is probably more true in substance
than in fact, but
it certainly illustrates Disfunction
of outline
as the definition of the boundaries of
form.

SILHOUETTE
As children we probably perceive forms in nature
defined
as
flat shapes of
colour relieved upon other
colours,
or
flat
fields
of
ight on
dark,
as
a white
horse
is defined upon the
green grass of a field, or a
black figure upon a back-
ground of snow.
To
define
the
bound-
aries
of
such
forms
be-
comes the main object
in
early
attempts
at
artistic
expression.
The
atten-
tion
is
caught
by
the
edges
the
shape
of
the
silhouette
which
remains
the paramount means
of distinction of form when details and secondary

DEFINITION OF BOUNDARIES
characteristics are lost
;
as
the outlines of moun-
tains remain, or are even more clearly seen, when
distance subdues
the
details of
their
structure,
and evening mists throw them
into
flat
planes
one behind the other, and leave nothing but the
delicate
lines
of their
edges
to
tell
their
char-
acter.
We feel the beauty and simplicity of such
effects in nature. We feel that the mind, through
the eye resting upon these quiet planes and deli-
OCWST & MOUNTAIN LINES
cutr or NAUPUI>V
cate lines, receives a sense of repose and poetic sug-
gestion which
is lost
in the bright noontide, with
all
its wealth of glittering detail, sharp cut in light
and shade.
There
is no doubt
that
this typical
power of outline and the value of simplicity of mass
were perceived by the ancients, notably the Ancient
Egyptians and the Greeks, who both, in their own
ways, in their art show a wonderful power of char-
acterization by means of line and mass, and a deli-
cate sense of the ornamental value and quality of
i
.
A
j
line.

FORMATION OF LETTERS
Regarding line
the useof outline from the point
of view of its value as a means of definition of form
and fact
its power
is really only limited by the
power of draughtsmanship at the command of the
artist.
From the archaic potters' primitive figures
or the rudimentary attempts of children at human
or animal forms up to the most refined outlines of
a Greek vase-painter, or say the artist of the Dream
of Poliphilus, the difference
is one of degree. The
tyro with the pen, learning to write, splotches and
scratches, and painfully forms
trembling, limping
O's and A's, till with practice and habitude, almost
unconsciously, the power to form
firm letters
is
acquired.
Writing, after all, is but a simpler form of draw-
ing, and we know that the letters of our alphabet
were originally pictures or
symbols.
The main
difference
is that writing stops short with the ac-
quisition
of the purely
useful power of forming
letters and words, and
is seldom pursued for the
sake of its beauty or artistic qualities as formerly
;
while drawing continually leads on
to new diffi-
culties to be conquered, to new subtleties of line,
and fresh fascinations in the pursuit of distinction
and style.
The practice of forming letters with the pen or
brush, from good types, Roman and Gothic, how-
ever, would afford very good preliminary practice
to a student of line and form.
The hand would
acquire directness of stroke and 'touch, while the
eye would grow accustomed to good lines of com-
position and simple constructive forms. QThe pro-
gressive
nature
of writing
the gradual building
up of the forms of the letters
and the necessity of
4

dealing with recurring forms and lines, also, would
bear usefully upon after work in actual design.

black letters, building the former upon the square

its
proportions,
the thickness of the down
strokes being one-eighth of square, the thin strokes
5

METHODS OF DRAWING IN LINE
being one-sixteenth, and the serifs being turned by
circles of one-fourth and one-eighth diameter. The
capital O,
it will be noted,
is formed of two circles
struck diagonally.
Letters may be taken as the simplest form of
definition by means
of line.
They have been re-
duced through centuries of use from their primitive
hieroglyphic forms
to
their present arbitrary and
fixed types, though even these fixed types are sub-
ject to the variation produced by changes of taste
and fancy.
But when we come to unformulated nature
to
the vast world
of complex
forms, ever changing
their aspect, full of life and movement, trees, flowers,
woods and waters, birds, beasts, fishes, the human
form
the problem how to represent any of these
forms, to express and characterize them by means
of so abstract a method as line-drawing, seems at
first difficult enough.
But
since
the growth
of perception,
like the
power of
graphic representation,
is gradual and
partial, though progressive, the eye and the mind
are generally first impressed with the salient
fea-
tures and leading
characteristics of natural forms,
just as the child's first idea of a human form is that
of a body with four straight limbs, with a prepon-
derating head,
That
is the
first impression, and
it
is unhesitatingly recorded in infantine outline.
The first aim, then, in drawing anything in line
is to grasp the general
truths ^f^orm^character,
and expression^
There are various methods of proceeding in get-
ting an outline of any object or figure.
To begin
with, the student might begin progressively defin-
6

THE PROGRESSIVE METHOD
ing the form by a series of stages in this way. Take
the profile of a bird, for instance
;
the form might
be gradually built up by the combination of a series
of lines
:
or take the simpler form of a flask bottle
:
2

I
or a jar on the same principle
:
i
or, simpler still, a leaf form, putting
in the stem
first with one stroke (i)
:
and building the form around it (2, 3).
This might be termed the calligrarjhic method^of
drawing; and in this method facmtyof hand might
b^-fthftter practised by attempting the definition of
forms by continuous
strokes, or building
it up by
7

THE CALLIGRAPHIC METHOD
as lew strokes as possible.
The simpler types of
ornament
consisting
of meandering and flowing
lines can all be produced in this way,
i.e., by con-
tinuous line, as well as
natural forms
treated in a

THE TENTATIVE METHOD
certain abstract or conventional way, which adapts
them to decoration.
Another
method
is
to sketch
in
lightly guide
lines for main masses, building a sort of scaffold-
ing of light
lines
to
assist the eye in getting the
correct outline
in
its
place, using
vertical
centre
lines for symmetrical forms to get the poise right.
9

THE JAPANESE DIRECT BRUSH METHOD
This
is the method very generally in
use, but
I
thing jt very desirable to
practise direct drawing
as well, to acquire certainty of eye and
facility of
hand
; and one must not mind
failure
at
first,
as
this kind of power and facility is so much a matter
of practice.
The Japanese, who draw with the brush, have
accustomed themselves to draw in a direct manner
without any preliminary sketching, and the charm
of their work
is largely owing to that crisp fresh-
ness of touch only possible to their direct method.
The great object
is to establish a
perfectly
inti-
mate correspondence between eye and hand, so
that the
latter
will
record what the former per-
ceives.
Abundant specimens of the freedom and natural-
ism of the modern school of Japanese
artists
in
this
direct brush method may be found
in
the
work of Bari,Jjjroshio^i, and Hokusai, and in
the
numerous printiTand books of designs from
their
hands.
To
all draughtsmen and designers they
are most valuable to study for their direct method
and sjmpje^means of expression of form and f^rt.
Accidental as they frequently seem in composition,
the placing of the drawing upon the paper is care-
fully considered before starting, and this, of course,
is always a very important point.
Yet another method of drawing, more especially
in relation to the drawing of the human figure and
animal forms,
I may mention as a help
to
those
who do
not
feel
strong enough
for
the
direct
method.
At the same time
it must be borne
in
mind that we can accustom ourselves totf/rj'method
;
and the more dependent we become upon a single
10

THE OVAL AND RECTANGULAR METHODS
method, the less facility we shall have for working
in any other.
But
for
all
that
it
is desirable to
master one method
that
is, to be able to draw in
\vwtfreely in one way or another
and experience
and practice alone will enable us to find the method
most satisfactory.
This other method
is to block
in the principal
1

THE RECTANGULAR METHOD
masses
of the
forms we
desire
to
represent by
means of a series of ovals, as shown
in the
illus-
tration, and when we have got the masses in their
proper relations, to proceed to draw in the careful
outline of the figure, or whatever
it may be, upon
this substructure of guiding lines, correcting as we
go along.
It would be quite possible to work on
the same principle, but upon a structure of more
or
less rectangular masses.
The real use of the
method
is
to assist the student to get a grasp
of
the relation of the masses of a figure and a sense
of structure in drawing
; whether square or oval
blocking in is used may be a matter of choice.
It
may be said for the oval forms that they resemble
the contours of the structure in human and animal
forms.
If one had a tendency to round one's forms too
much,
it would
be
well
to
try
the
rectangular
method
to
correct
this, and
vice versa.
After a
certain
facility has been
acquired
in
rendering form by means of line, we shall perceive
further
capacities
of
expression
in
its
use, and
begin to note how different characteristics of form
and natural fact may be expressed by varying the
quality of our outline.
If we are drawing a plant or a flower, for
in-
stance, we should endeavour to show by the quality
of our line the difference between the fine springing
curves in the structure of the
lily, the solid seed-
centre and stiff radiation of the petals of the daisy,
and the delicate silky folds of the poppy.
But, as leaves come before flowers,
it would be
best
to begin with leaf forms and try to express
the character of oak and beech, lime and chestnut

leaves, for instance, by means of outline.

as not being full enough
:
it may look meagre
in
quality
and
small
in
definition
of
form.
This

QUALITY OF LINE
probably arises from not allowing enough space
from
setting
the
outline
too much
within
the
boundary of the form.
To correct this one cannot
do better than block in the form of the object we
are drawing
(leaf,
flower,
or
figure) with a
full
brush in black silhouette, placing the object against
the light or white paper, so that its true boundary
may be seen uninterfered with by surface markings

or shadows, and, concentrating our attention upon
the edge, follow
it as carefully as possible with the
solid black.
Then,
if we compare the result with
our outline,
it will help to show where
it has failed
;
and the practice of thus blocking in with the brush
in solid silhouette will tend to encourage a larger
style
of drawing, since good outline means good
perception of mass
; ancfas a generaTprincTple
in
drawing, it^m1iyn5e~7ecommended
to place
one's

outline outside the silhouette boundary of the form
rather than within
it
;
that
is
to
say, when
the
figure or object is relieved in light against dark, as
the line in that case defines the edge against the
background.
When the figure or object appears
as dark upon a light ground, however, the outline
should be within the silhouette,
obviously, or
its
delicate boundary is lost.
Another important attribute of line
is its power
of expressing or suggesting movement.
By a law of
LINE5-OF nOVLMLMT
inseparable association, undulating lines approach-
ing the horizontal, or leading down
to
it, are con-
nected with the sense of repose
; whereas broken
curves and rectangular lines always suggest action
and unrest, or the resistance to force of some kind.
The recurrence of a series
of lines in the same
direction
in
a
kind
of
crescendo
or
wave-like
movement
suggests continuous pressure of force
in the same direction, as
in this series of instant-
aneous
actions of a man
bowling, where the line
drawn through or touching the
highest points in
15

LINEAR EXPRESSION OF MOVEMENT
each figure takes the line of the curve of a wave.
The wave-line, indeed, may be
said
not only
to
suggest movement, but also
to describe its direc-
tion and force.
It
is, in fact, the line of movement.
The principle may be seen
in a simpler way, as
Hogarth points out
in
his
" Analysis of Beauty,"
by observing
the line
described along a wall by
the head of a man walking along the street.
Or,
as we may see sometimes near
the
coast, trees
exposed to the constant pressure of the wind illus-
trate this recurrence of lines in the same direction
governing
their general shape
; and as each tree
is forced to spread in the direction away from the
wind, the effect is that of their being always strug-
gling
against
its
pressure even
in
the
calmest
weather; and this is entirely due to our association
of wind-movement with
this
peculiar
linear
ex-
pression.
Flowing
water, again,
is expressed by
certain
recurring wave lines, which remind us of the ancient
linear symbols
of the
zigzag and meander used
from the earliest times
to express water.
In the

streams
that channel the
sands of the sea-shore
when the tide recedes we may see
beautiful flow-
ing
lines, sometimes crossing like a network, and
sometimes running into a series of shell-like waves
;
while the sands themselves are ribbed and chan-
nelled and modelled by the
recurring movement
17
c

LINEAR EXPRESSION OF TEXTURES
of the waves, which leave upon them the impress
and the expression
of their motion (much as in a
more delicate medium the air-currents impress the
fields of cloud, and give them their characteristic
forms).
Textures and surfaces, too, fall within the range
of
linear
expression.
One would
naturally
use
lines of totally different consistency and character
to express rough
or smooth surfaces
:
to express
the
difference of value, for
instance, between the
ivory-like smoothness
of an
egg and
the
scaly
surface of a
pine-cone, entirely different qualities
of line are
obviously wanted.
The
firm-set yet
soft
feathers
of the plumage
of a
bird must be
rendered by a very different touch from the shining
scales of a fish.
The hair and horns of animals,
delicate human features, flowers, the sinuous lines
of thin
drapery,
or
the
broad massive
folds
of
heavy robes,
all demand from
the
designer and
draughtsman in line different kinds of suggestive
expression, a
translation or rendering of
natural
fact subordinate to the artistic purpose of his work,
and
in
relation
to
the
material and purpose
for
which he works.
Then, again, when we come
to the expression
of ideas
of thought and sentiment
we
find in
line an abstract but
direct medium for their illus-
tration
; and this again, too, by means of that law of
inseparable association which connects the idea of
praise
or
aspiration
and
ascension, for instance,
with long lines inclining towards the severe vert-
ical,
as when
we

a
figure

Few things in design are finer or more elevated in

Bowed and bent lines tending downwards, on

sensitive and vigorous speech
of many
dialects
; which
can
adapt
itself
to
all
purposes, and
is, indeed, indispensable
to
all the
provinces of design in line.
Line may be regarded
simply as a means of record, a method of register-
ing the facts of nature, of graphically portraying
the characteristics of plants and animals, or the
features
of humanity
:
the
smooth

of
youth, the rugged

movement of the falling waves, the fierce energy
of the storm and
its

glittering with the sudden zigzag of the lightning
;
or we may sink into the profound calm of a sum-
mer
day, when the
mountains,
defined only by
their edges, wrapped in soft planes of mist, seem
to recline upon the level meadows like Titans and

I SPOKE of Line as a Language, and gave some
illustrations of
its power and range of expres-
sion, showing
that
line
is
capable
not
only of
recording
natural fact and defining character, but
also of conveying the idea of movement and force,
of action and repose
; and,
further, of appealing
to our emotions and thoughts by variations and
changes in its direction, the degree of its emphasis,
and other qualities.
Yet every designer and draughtsman uses
line
in a
different way, and of a different quality, ac-
cording to his preference, habit, training, or person-
ality. The endless variations which result
I should
to pursue the analogy of speech further
term
dialect^.
We
might
collect
abundant examples
of these from the work of line-designers since the
world began, or compare the methods of any of
the popular
illustrators of to-day to find constant
23

DIALECTS
variations
and
individual
differences
occurring
even among those which might be said, under the
influence of a prevailing mode, to be variations of
one type.
Compare a Greek vase-painter's delicate brush
line-drawing
with
the
bold
pen-line
of Albert
Dlirer (to get a contrast in historic style).
Com-
pare (to take two masters of different schools, but
of the same country) the line-treatment of Man-
tegna with the line-treatment of Raphael
;
or, to
take another jump, compare the line-work of Blake
and Flaxman
;
or, to take a modern instance, and
to come
to
our own contemporary artists, com-
pare a drawing by Burne-Jones and one by Phil
May.
We might construct a sort of scale of the degrees
and qualities of line.
There
is, for instance, outline of every degree
of boldness or fineness, from the strong black half-
inch
outline and upwards
used
in
mosaic-work
and
stained-glass
leading
;
the
outline
of
the
pattern
designer
for block-printing
;
the
outline
of the pen draughtsman for process-work or wood-
cut
; and so on, down to the hair-line of the dry-
point etcher.
There
are
the
qualities
of
line
in
different
degrees
of
firmness,
roughness,
raggedness,
or
smooth and flowing.
There
are
the degrees of
direction of line, curvilinear or angular.
On the
angular side all variations from the perpendicular
and horizontal, or rectangle, within which we may
find all these degrees, and on the curvilinear side,
all the variations from spiral to circle
: so that we
might say that the rectangle was the cradle of all

angular variations of line, while the semicircle was
the cradle of all curvilinear variations.

Now what determines this choice, this personal
selection,
over and above necessities of method
and material,
it would be
difficult to
say, unless
26

RELATION OF LINE TO FORM
we had
more
minute knowledge
of the
natural
history of a human
being than we are
likely
to
possess.
We can only say that from practice are
evolved certain methods or principles, consciously
or
unconsciously
; and
it
is
only
these general
methods or
principles
that can be ex-plained and
tested for the benefit of those essaying to follow
the arduous and difficult path of art.
At the outset we see that we need a means of
definition in drawing, just as a child needs a word
to express a thing
it wants.
Line, at the point of
the pencil, pen, or brush, places this
possibility of
definition
within
our
reach
;
but
before we
can
grasp
it we need some knowledge, however
rudi-
mentary, of its inseparable companion, Form.
I
recall two innocent and entertaining methods
from the traditions of the nursery, which appeal at
once in a curious way to both the oral and graphic
senses, and unite story and picture in one.
These
are illustrated on p. 28.
By such devices a child
learns
to
associate
line and
form,
unconsciously
and
step by step defining form
in the use
of, or
pursuit of, line.
It would be very entertaining and agreeable
if
we could
carry the
principle
further, and
get
a
passable study from
the antique, for
instance, by
a similar process.
In line-drawing we may, how-
ever, always
tell some story or
fact, or character,
phase, or idea.
But supposing we have mounted our steed Form,
and
taken
our
bridle

in
hand,
and have
started riding at large in the vast domain of nature,
with
the
primary
object

THE GRAPHIC PURPOSE
are so many truths, or rather that
truth, even
of
natural fact, has so many sides, that
it is difficult to
make up our mind which one to pursue.
Thought,
however, will soon discover that in this pursuit of
truth we strike a road that naturally divides itself,
or branches
out, into two main
paths
distinct
in
aim.
These two paths in art have been called by
many names
; they occasionally cross each
other,
or
overlap, and
are sometimes blended, or even
confused
; but
it will be use ul for our present pur-
pose to keep them very distinct.
I will term them,
for convenience
:
1. The Graphic Purpose.
(Accidental form.)
2. The Ornamental Purpose.
(Typical form.)
Our use of line will largely depend upon which
of these two it is our object to pursue.
Now when
we look
at anything with
intent to draw
say a
leafy bough as
it grows
in the sunshine
we see
great
complexity
of
form
and
surface-lighting.
The
leaves,
perhaps,
take
all manner
of varia-
tions of the
typical form, and are
set at all sorts
of angles.
In making a
rapid
sketch
with
the
object of getting the appearance of the bough, we
naturally dw
rell upon
these accidents and super-
ficial facts.
At the same
time, with nothing but
line to express them, we are compelled
to use-a
kind
oL-Coav_ejition,
though
our
aim
be
purely
naturalistic,
to
get
a
faithful
portrait
of
the
bough.
We must make our line as descriptive as possible,
defining the main forms
boldly, and blocking
in
broadly the main masses
of form and
light and
shade.
We are now aiming
at the general look
of the thing.
We are

conditions,
altogether
leave out
of account con-
siderations
which,
strictly
speaking,
must
be
termed " decorative."
For instance, there
is the
question of placing the study well upon the paper,
a very important point to start with
; and then the
question
of beauty must
arise,
not
only
in
the
selection of our point of view, but in the choice of
method, in the treatment of line we adopt; and
it
does not follow that the most apparently forcible
way of getting bold

Now supposing we make our study of leaves,
not as an end in

values or
qualities
only, but with an ornamental
or decorative purpose
in view, intending to make
use of its form and character in some more or less

should want to understand
it in

of
its growth and construction
; we should want
to dwell upon
its
typical character and form, the
controlling lines of
its

because

character and
incident, before our
eyes.
It does not require us to stop and think out the
less obvious
meaning, or
trace -the invention
or
grace of
line,
to
appreciate the
rhythmic, silent
music which
the
more
formalized and
abstract
decorative design may contain, quite apart from
the forms it actually represents.
Here we discover another function of line.
For,
directly we endeavour
to construct a decorative
design
that
is, a design intended
to a'dorn or to
express an object or surface
we find that we must
build
it upon some
sort of a
plan, or geometric
controlling network or scaffolding, so as to give
it
unity, rhythm, and coherence
especially so in the
case of repeating
designs.
Even
in an
isolated
panel or picture the
necessity of this
linear basis
will be
felt, since one cannot draw a line or define
a form without demanding an answer
that
is, a
corresponding, re-echoing line or mass.
The curve
(i.
Q)
is a proposition or question.
It
is answered
or balanced by the corresponding
curve
(2.

if we add

WALL-PAPER DESIGN
four,
in
reverse order, (2) we get a centred and
symmetric motive of an anthemion character.
Take, however, a wall-paper.
The problem
is
to construct a design pleasant
to the eye
in
line,
form,
colour, and suggestion
; which
will
be
in-
teresting
in
detail, and
yet
repeat upon a
wall-
surface without flaw, and without becoming weari-
some.
Moreover, one

which may be reproduced with a due regard
to

The designer may have a
square of twenty- one inches in which to make his
design.
A useful way to begin with
is to rule out a sheet

When you are satisfied with one, enlarge

sary in drawing
it upon the larger scale, sometimes
additions, sometimes omissions.
Now in sketch-

simple, since
one cannot put a simple spot, sprig, or spray upon

CONTROLLING FORMS
paper intending to repeat, without some system of
connection to put them into relation.
In designing one's
sprig, too, the best plan to
secure good
decorative
effect
is
to
see
that
its
general form
is
inclosed or bounded by an agree-
able
linear
shape,
although
itself
not
actually
visible.
Simple leaf and flower forms are gener-
ally the best to use for these controlling boundaries.
Sprays designed on
this principle may be relied
upon
for
repeating
pleasantly and
safely when
they are placed upon, and connected by, the con-
trolling geometric plan.
A good practical test of
the truth and completeness of your square repeat
is, when the design
is done, or even in progress,
to cut it into four equal parts (supposing
it to be a
twenty-one
inch
square).
This
will enable you
to get the joints
true, and
also, by
altering the
position of the squares, to give you a very good
idea of the effect of the repeat full size.
(See the
diagrams on p. 41.)
These
things must
be
considered,
of course,
merely as practical aids to invention
:
not by any
means as substitutes for
it.
One cannot give any
recipe for designing, and no
rules,
principles, or
methods can supply the place of imagination and
fancy.
" He who would bring back
health from
the Indies," says an old proverb,
" must take it out
with him."
At the same time the imagination can be en-
feebled by
starvation
and
neglect.
It
can be
depressed by
dull and
sordid
surroundings.
It
is apt
to grow, like other
living things, by what
it feeds
on, and
is stronger
for exercise and de-
velopment.

Memory, too,
is an
important and
serviceable
thing
in designing, and
this, again, can be
culti-
vated to an almost unlimited extent.
I mean that
selective kind of memory which, by constant and
close observation, extracts and stores up the essen-

EVOLUTION
IN DESIGN
possible, pinned down
in the hieroglyphics of the
note-book.
As regards procedure in working out a design,
one generally thinks of some leading feature, some
central
mass
or form
or curve
of
a
figure
or
a
flower, say
and one
thinks
of
its capacity
in
repeat
;
and,
since
one form
or
line should
in-
evitably suggest
or
necessitate
as by a kind of
logic
another, one adds other forms until the de-
sign is complete.
For it must never be forgotten
that design is a growth which has
its own stages
of evolution
in the mind, answering to the evolu-
tion of the living forms of nature
first the blade,
then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.
Experience teaches us that the most harmonious
arrangements of form and line are those in which
the leading
lines and forms through
all sorts
of
variations, continually recur,
We cannot place a
number of sliarply contrasting and contradictory
forms together
in
design
satisfactorily
at
least
we cannot do so without recourse to other elements
to harmonize and to bring them into relation.
For
instance, we might get a gieat deal of ornamental
variety by means of a number of heraldic devices
upon shields, full in themselves of quaintness and
contrasts, butbroughtintoharmony by the boundary
lines
of the
shields and
the
divisions
;
or,
still
further, by throwing them upon a background of
leaves and stems, the meandering lines and recur-
ring forms
of which would answer as a kind of
warp upon which to weave the heraldic spots into
a connected and harmonious pattern.
But even in the ornamental treatment of diverse
forms,

To this, however,
I
hope to return
in a future chapter.
We may here consider another important prin-
43

COUNTERBALANCE
ciple
in
designing
with
line and
mass,
that
of
counterbalance.
Take any defined space as a panel, tile, or border
to be filled with design
: you place your principal
mass, and instantly feel
that
it must be balanced
by
a
corresponding
mass,
or some
equivalent.
Its place will be determined by the principle upon
which the design
is
built.
If on
a symmetrical
arrangement, you find your centre (say of a panel),
and you may either throw the chief weight and
mass of the design upon the central feature (as a
tree), and
balance
it by smaller forms or wings
each
side, or vice versa;
or, adopting a diagonal
plan, you place your principal mass (say it is a tile)
near the top left-hand corner (suppose it is a pome-
granate), connecting
it with a spiral diagonal line
(the stem)
; the place of the counterbalancing mass
(the second pomegranate)
is obviously near the
bottom right-hand corner of the square.
You may
then feel the necessity for additional smaller forms,
and so add
to
it (the
leaves), completing the de-
sign.
(See preceding page.)
On
the same
principle one may design upon
various other plans.
The exact choice of the dis-
tribution
of
the
counterbalancing
masses
must
always be a matter of personal feeling, judgment,
and taste, controlled by the perception
of certain
logical necessities
:
as it seems to me that design-
ing
is
a species of
linear reasoning,
1 and might
almost be worked in
its elementary stages on the
principle of the syllogism, consisting of two pro-
positions and a conclusion.

is produced by

;
here
is a meandering

: combine and repeat
them, and you get a logical and harmonious border

The
borders of early, ancient, and
classical
art might
be said to be little besides rhythmical and logical
arrangements of line.
The same rhythmical prin-
ciple is found in the designs of the classical frieze
in
all
its
varieties, culminating

is
yet controlled by a

recurrence of pure line.
Another great linear principle in design is what
is known
as the radiating principle, which gives
vitality and vigour alike
to both arrangements of
line and delineations of form.
It
is emphatically
and abundantly illustrated
in
natural forms, from

The palm-
leaf in
all
its graceful varieties demonstrates
its
beauty,
its
constructive
strength
combined with
extraordinary lightness, which becomes domesti-
cated in that fragile sceptre of social influence and
festivity,
the
fan, and which
again
spreads
its
silken, or gossamer, wing as a suggestive field for
the designer.
We find the principle springing to
life again
in the fountain
jet,
and symbolical of
life as
it
has ever been
; by means of the same
principle applied to construction the Gothic archi-
tects
raised their beautiful vaults, and emphasized
the
structural
principle and the beauty of
recur-
ring
line by moulding the
edges
of their
ribs
;
while we have but to look
at the structure of the
human frame to find the same principle there also,
in the fibres of the muscles, for instance, the radia-
tion of the ribs, and of the fingers and toes.
In truth, as
I have said,
if there can be said to
be one principle more than another, the perception
and expression of which gives to an artist's work
in design
peculiar
vitality,
it
is
this principle of
radiating
line.
One may
follow
it
through
all
stages and forms of drawing and
design, and
it
is equally important in the design of the figure, in
the structure of a flower, in the folds of drapery,
and alike in the controlling lines of pictorial compo-
sition and decorative plan, whether the lines radiate
from
seen
or from
hidden
centres, which
in
all
kinds
of informal
design
are
perhaps
the most
important.
We
see,
therefore,

RECOGN
IZ ING the great range and capacity
of line as a means of expression, and also the
range
of choice
it
presents
to
the designer and
draughtsman, the actual exercise of this choice of
line,
with
a
view
to
the
most
expressive
and
effective
use
in
practice,
becomes,
of course,
of
the first consequence.
In this matter of choice we are helped by natural
bias,
by
personal
character and
preferences,
for
which
it would, as
I have said, be difficult fully to
account;
but beyond this a kind of evolution goes
on, arising out of actual
practice, which
controls
and is controlled by it.
Draw simply a succession
of strokes with any point upon paper, and we find
that we
are gradually
led to
repeat a particular
kind of stroke, a particular degree of line, partly
perhaps because
it seems
to
be
produced
with
more ease, and partly because
it appears to have
the pleasantest effect.

we finally arrive at a choice of line.
This choice,
5 2

USE OF LINE
again,
will be
liable
to constant variation, owing
to the nature of the
object we are about to draw,
or the kind of design we want to make.
The
kind of line which seems appropriate
to
representing the delicate edges of a piece of low-
relief sculpture, for instance, would require greater
force and firmness if we wanted to draw an antique
cast in the round, and
in strong light and shade.
The character of our
line should be sympathetic
with the character of our subject as far as possible,
and
sensitive
to
its
differences of character and
surface,
since
it
is
in
this sensitiveness
that the
expressive power and peculiar virtue of line-draw-
ing consists.
A feather, a lily, a scallop
shell, all show as an
essential principle of their form and construction
the radiating line
; but what a different quality of
line would be necessary to express the differences of
each
:
for the soft, yet firm, smooth flowing curves
of the feather fibres no line would be too delicate
;
and the
lily would demand no less
delicacy, and
even greater precision and firmness of curve, while
a
slight
waviness,
or quiver,
in
the
lines might
express the silken or waxy surface of the petals;
while a crustier, more rugged, though equally firm
line would be wanted
to follow the
rigid furrows
and serrated surface of the
shell.
The leaves

trees and plants of all kinds, which perhaps afford
the

in
their

of structure,

artistic judgment
in
the choice and

of line.

or too loose and

and
practice
in
the use
of
line.
I
do
not
suppose
the greatest
master
ever
satisfied
himself yet
in
this
direc-
tion.
When we have settled upon our quality of line
and
its degree
thick or thin, bold or fine
we shall
be met with
the question of
emphasis,
for upon
this
the
ultimate
effect and
expression
of our
54

DEGREE AND EMPHASIS
drawing or design must largely depend.
In the
selection
of any
subject we should
naturally be
influenced by the attractiveness of particular parts,
characters, or
qualities
it might possess, and we
should
direct our
efforts towards bringing these
out, as the things which impress us most.
That
is the difference between the mind and hand work-
ing together harmoniously and the sensitized plate
in
the photographic camera, which, uncontrolled
in any way by human
choice
(and
even under
that
control as
it always
is
to some extent), me-
chanically
registers
the
action
of the
light
rays
which
define
the impress
of
natural
forms and
scenes through the lens focussed upon the
plate.
So
that,
as we
often
see
in
a photograph, some
unimportant or insignificant detail
is reproduced
with
as much
distinctness
(or more)
as are the
leading
figures or whatever form the interesting
features or the motive of the subject.
The picture
suffers from want^of emphasis, or from emphasis
in^thg'wfoiigf place.
It
is, of course, here that the
artToTthe photographer comes in
;
and, although
he can by careful
selection, arrangement, and the
regulation
of
exposure,
largely
counteract
the
mechanical
tendency, a ph
nature can ngyerjtake the^place of a work oLart=r
the first-hand expression, more or less abstract, of
a human mind, or the creative inner vision recorded
by a human hand.
Photography
does
wonders,
and
for
certain
qualities
of light and shade, and form and
effect
without
colour,
no
painting or drawing can

proach
it
;
but
it has

It is invaluable to the

INFLUENCE OF THE PHOTOGRAPH
student of natural fact, surface effect, and momen-
tary action, and
is often in
its very
failures most
interesting and suggestive to artists
who indeed
have not been slow to avail themselves of the help
of photography in all sorts of ways.
Indeed the
wonder
is, considering
its
services
to
art
in
all
directions, how the world could ever have done
without
it.
But
a photograph
cannot do
everything.
It
cannot make original designs, and
it cannot draw
in
line.
You can design
in the
solid, and make
your groups in the studio or the open air
; you can
select your point of view, and the photograph will
reproduce.
You can make your drawing in line,
and
it
will copy
it
;
and we know
its sphere of
usefulness
in
this
direction
is enormous, since
it
can
bring
before
our
eyes
the whole
range
of
ancient
art.
In
short, photography
is an
excellent servant
and friend, but a dangerous master.
It may easily
beguile us by its seductive reproductions of surface
relief and lighting to think more of these qualities
than any other, and to endeavour to put them
in
the wrong places
in places where we want colour
planes
rather
than shadow
planes,
flatness and
repose rather than
relief
for instance,
as mostly
in surface decoration.
But one way of learning the value of emphasis
is to draw from a photograph, and
it will soon be
discovered what a difference
in expression
is pro-
duced by dwelling a
little more
here,
or a
little
less there.
In designing,
the use of emphasis
is very im-
portant
; and
it may be
sai'd
that drawing or de-
56

THE VALUE OF EMPHASIS
signing without emphasis
is
like reading without
stops, while awkward emphasis is like putting your
stops in the wrong place.
By a
difference
in emphasis
the same design
may be given quite a different
effect and expres-
sion.
Suppose, for instance, we were designing a ver-
tical pattern of stem, leaves, and fruit in one colour.
EFFECT OF DIFFERENT EMPHASIS
IN THE TREATMENT OF

By throwing the emphasis upon the leaves, as in
No.
i, we should gain one kind of effect or decor-
ative expression.
By throwing the emphasis upon
the
fruit, and
leaving
the
leaves
in
outline, we
should get quite a different effect out of the same
elements,
as
in No.
2.
While by leaving stem,
leaves, and
fruit
all
in
outline, and throwing the
emphasis upon the ground, we should get, again,
a totally distinct kind of effect and expression.
Similar
differences
of
effect
and
expression,

THE VALUE OF EMPHASIS
owing to differences of emphasis, might be studied
in the drawing and treatment of a head (as in A, B,

The
possibilities
of such

of
emphasis in drawing are practically unlimited and
co-extensive with the variations of expression we
see in nature herself.

No kind of art can be said to be unconditioned,
and the simplest and
freest of
all,
the art of the
point and the surface^ which covers all the graphic
art and

is
still subject to certain
technical influences, and
it may be said that
it
is
very much
in
so far as these technical influences
or conditions are acknowledged and utilized that
the work gains in artistic character.
The draughtsman in line who draws for surface
printing, for the book or newspaper, should be able
to stand the test of the peculiar conditions

THE TECHNICAL INFLUENCE
A firm and open quality of line, with bright black
and white effects, not only has the most attractive
decorative effect with type, but lends itself to the
processes of reproduction for surface printing best,
whether woodcut or one of the numerous forms of
so-called automatic photo-engraving, as well as to
the conditions of the printing press.
In all design-work which has to be subjected to
processes of engraving and printing, clearness and
definiteness of line is very necessary.
Designs for
textile printing of all kinds, for wall-papers, especi-
ally, require good firm drawing and definite colour
planes.
This does
not, however, mean hardness
of effect. A design should be clear and intelligible
without being hard.
For weaving, again, definiteness
in pattern de-
signing is very necessary, since the design must be
capable of being rendered upon the severe condi-
tions of the point paper, by which it is only possible
to produce curves by small successive angles (which
sounds like a contradiction in terms).
The size of
these angles or points, of course, varies very much
in the different kinds of textile with which pattern
is incorporated, from the fine silk fabric,
in which
they are almost inappreciable, to carpets of all kinds,
where they are emphatic
;
so that a certain square-
ness of mass becomes a desirable and character-
istic
feature
in
designs
for these
purposes,
and,
indeed,
I think
it should be more or less acknow-
ledged in
all textile design, in order to preserve its
distinctive beauty and character.
Beauty and character.
In these lies the gist of
all design.
While the technical conditions, if fully
understood, fairly met, and frankly acknowledged,
62

THE ARTISTIC PURPOSE
are sure to give character to a design, for whatever
purpose, beauty is not so easy .to command.
It is
so delicate a quality, so complex in
its elements, a
question often of such nice balance and judgment
depending perhaps upon a hair's-breadth differ-
ence in the poise of a mass here, or the sweep of a
curve there
that we cannot weave technical nets
fine enough to catch so sensitive a butterfly.
She
is indeed a Psyche in art, both seeking and sought,
to be finally won only by devotion and love.
This search
for beauty
this Psyche of art
is
the purely inspiring
artistic purpose,
as
distinct
from the technical and
useful one, which should,
perfectly reconciled and united with
it, determine
the form of our work.
In drawing or design we may seek
particular
qualities in line and form either of representation
or of ornament.
We may desire
to
dwell upon
particular beauties either of object or subject.
Say,
in drawing from a cast or from natural form of any
kind, we desire to dwell upon beauty
of line
or
^
quality of surface.
Well, since
it is most difficult,
if not
impossible, to get everything
at once, and
nothing without some kind of
sacrifice, we
shall
find that to give prominence to
to bring out
the
particular quality in our subject (say beauty of line),
it becomes necessary to subordinate other qualities
to this.
A drawing in pure outline of a figure may
be a perfect thing in
itself. The moment we begin
to superadd shading, or lines expressive of relief
of any kind, we introduce another element
; we are
aiming at another kind of truth or beauty
; and un-
less we have also a distinctly ideal aim
in this, we
shall mar the simplicity of the outline without gain-

THE INFLUENCE OF MATERIAL
ing any compensating advantage, or really adding
to the truth or beauty of the drawing.
In designing, too, unless we can so contrive the
essential characteristics of our pattern that they
shall be adaptable to the method and material of its
production, and make
its reproduction quite prac-
ticable,
it is sure to reappear more or less marred
and
incomplete.
The thing
is to discover what
kind, of character and beauty the method will allow
of
whether beauty or quality of line, or surface,
or colour, or material
; and
if to be reproduced in
a particular method or material, the design should
be thought out in the method or material for which
it is destined, rather than as a drawing on paper,
and worked out
accordingly, using every oppor-
tunity to secure the particular kind of beauty natur-
ally belonging to such work in its completed form.
Thus we should naturally think of planes of sur-
face
in modelled work, and the
delicate play
of
light and shade, getting our equivalent for colour
in the design and contrast of varied surfaces.
In
stained glass we should think of a pattern in lead
lines inclosing one of translucent colour, each being
interdependent and united
to form a harmonious
whole.
In textile design we should be influenced
by the thought of the difference of use, plan, and
purpose of the finished material
; as the difference
between a rich
vertical
pattern
in
silk, velvet, or
tapestry, to be broken by folds as in curtains or
hangings, and a rich carpet pattern, to be spread
upon the unbroken level
surface of a floor.
The
idea of the wall and floor should here influence us
as well as the actual technical
necessities of the
loom.
It would be
part
of the
artistic purpose
64

BRUSH-WORK
affecting the imagination and artistic motive, and
working with the strictly technical conditions.
The mind must project itself, and see with the
inner eye the effect of the design as
it would ap-
pear in
actual use, as far as possible.
Invention,
knowledge, and experience will do the rest.
Keeping, however, to strictly pictorial or graphic
conditions
to the art of the point and the surface
with which, as designers and draughtsmen, we
are more immediately concerned, we cannot forget
certain technical considerations strictly belonging
to the varieties of point and of surface, and their
relations one to another. The flexible point of the
brush, for instance, dipped in ink, or colour, has its
own peculiar capacity, its own range of treatment,
one might say,
its own forms.
The management admits of immense variation
of use and touch, and
its range of depicting and
ornamental power are very great
: from
the
sim-
pler leaf forms, which seem to be almost a reflection
or shadow of the moist pointed brush
itself, to the
elaborate
graphic
drawing
in
line
or
light and
shade.
In forming the leaf shape one begins with a light
pressure,
if at the point, and proceeds to increase
it for the middle and broader end.
On the same
principle of regulation of pressure any brush forms
may be built up.
It is essential for freedom in work-
ing with the brush not to starve or stint it in moist-
ure or colour.
For ornamental forms a full brush
should
be
used
: otherwise they are apt
to look
dragged and meagre.
For a rich and flowing line
also a full brush, however fine, is necessary.
It is
quite possible, however,
to use

BRUSH-WORK
The direct touch with the
full brush
to culti-
vate this
is of enormous advantage to all artists,
whatever
particular
line of art they may follow,
since
it may be said to be of no less value in design
than it is in painting pure and simple. We can all
feel the charm of the broad brush washes and em-
phatic brush touches of a master of water-colour
landscape such as De Wint.
This is mastery of

A Japanese drawing of a bird or a fish may show
it equally in another
character and form.
A bit
of Oriental porcelain or Persian
tile may show the
same dexterous charm and full-brush feeling exer-
cised in a strictly decorative direction.
The empire of the brush,
if we think of it in all
its various forms and directions, is very large
; and
it commands, in skilled hands, both iineandform,
in
all their varieties, and leaves
its impress in all
the departments of
art, from the humble but dex-
terous craftsman who puts the line of gold or colour
round
the
edges
of our cups
and
saucers,
to
the highly skilled and specialized painter of easel
pictures
say the academician who writes cheques
with his paint-brush

Then we have the ordinary varieties of the firm
point: charcoal, pencil, pen.
Charcoal, being half-

to the firm and hard

Its softness and removability
adapts
it as a tool for preliminary and preparatory
sketching in for all purposes, and both for designer
and painter
; but
it lends
itself to both

tone drawing, or to a mixture of both.
It is there-
fore a very good
material for
rapid
studies (say
from the life) and the seizing of any effect of light
and shade
rapidly, since the masses can be
laid
in readily, and greater richness and depth can be
obtained
in
shorter
time,
perhaps,
than by any
other kind of pencil.
Charcoal
is also very serviceable
for large car-
toon-work, since
it
is capable of both delicacy and
force, and bears working up
to any extent.
A
slight rubbing of the finger gives half tones when
wanted, and
is often serviceable in giving greater
solidity and finish to the work.
Then
there
is
the

pencil
the
point-of-
all-work, as
it might be
called
more generally
serviceable
than any
other,
whether
for
rapid
sketches and jottings
in the note-book, or careful
and detailed drawings,
or
sketching
in
for
the
smaller
kinds
of
design-work.
It
is
also,
of
course, used
for drawings which
are afterwards
" inked
in."
I do not think, however,
that pen-
work done in this way is so free
or characteristic
as when done direct,
or at any rate quite
freely,
upon a mere scaffolding of preliminary lines, used
only to make the
plans for the
chief masses and
forms.
Pencil drawing
is capable of being carried to a
greater
pitch
of delicacy and
finish, and
has a
silvery quality
all
its own.
It has not the force
or range
of
charcoal,
but
in
its own
technical
range
it
possesses many advantages.
Its gray

charming

itself, does

THE PEN

case with
all work intended to be repro-
duced by some
process of handicraft or manu-
facture, except some sorts of photo-engraving or
lithography.
We must therefore look to another
implement to enable us to obtain these qualities,
namely, the brush, the use and qualities of which
I
have already touched upon.
There remains yet another
point
of the firm
and decisive order, the pen, which enables us to
get
firmness and sharpness
of
line and
precise
definition, as well as considerable range of treat-
ment and freedom of touch.
The pen seems to bear much the same relation
to the brush as the lead pencil does to charcoal
not capable of such
full and rich
effects or such
flowing freedom of line, but yet possessing its own
beauty and characteristic kinds of expression.
Its
true province is in comparatively small scale work,
and its natural association is with its sister-pen of
literature in the domain of book-design and deco-
j ration, and black and white drawing for the press.
Its
varieties
are
endless,
and
the
ingenuity of
manufacturers continually places before us fresh
choice of pen-points
to work
with
; but though
one occasionally meets with a good
steel pen,
I
have found
it too often
fails one just when
it
is
sufficiently worn to the right degree of flexibility.
One returns to the quill, which can be cut to suit
the
particular requirements
of one's work.
For
large bold drawing the reed-pen has advantages,
and a pleasant rich quality of line.

We now come
to the no less important question to the designer
and draughtsman
The Choice of Form.
If Line may be said to be the bone and sinew
of design, Form
is the substance and
the
flesh,
and both are obviously essential to its free life and
development.
The cube
and
the
sphere give us
the funda-

elements, or primal types from which are
derived the
multifarious, ever varying, and com-
plex forms, the products of the forces and condi-
tions of nature,
or the necessitous inventiveness
of
art, just as we may take
the
square and the
circle to be
the parents of linear and geometric
design.
The cube and the sphere, the
ellipse, the cone,
and the pyramid, with other comparatively simple
forms
of solid geometry,

ELEMENTARY FORMS
To avoid, however, falling into mechanical ways,
and to maintain
the
interest and give
vitality to
such studies, the
relation of such forms
to forms
in nature and art should be borne in mind, and no
opportunity
missed
of
comparing
them,
or
of
seeking
out
their
counterparts,
corresponding
principles, and variations, as well as their practical
bearing, both functional and
constructive
;
as
in
the case of the typical forms of flowers, buds, and
seed-vessels,
for
instance, where
the
cone and
the
funnel,
and
the
spherical,
cylindrical, and
tubular
principles
are
constantly
met
with,
as
essential
parts
of the
characters
and
organic
necessities of the plant
: the cone and the funnel
mostly
in buds and
flower-petals
for protection
and
inclosure of the pollen and seed germs, the
tube for conducting the juices
; the spherical form
to
resist
moisture
externally, or
to
hold
it
in-
ternally, or to avoid
friction, and
facilitate close
storage,
as
in the
case
of seeds
in
pods.
The
seed-vessel
of
the
poppy,
for
instance,
has a
curious little pent-house roof to shield the
inter-
stices
(like windows
in a tower)
till the seed
is
ripe and the time comes for
it to be shaken out
of the
shell or pod.
A
further
practical reason
for the prevalence of spherical form
in seeds
is
that they may, when the outer covering or husk
perishes, more readily
roll out and
fall
into the
interstices of the ground
;
or when, as in the case
of various
fruits, such as
the apple and orange,
the envelope
itself
is
spherical and intended
to
carry their
flat
or pointed seeds to the ground,
where it falls and rolls when ripe.
The cube and the various multiple forms may

in organic nature,

FILLING OF SPACES
in the flat which appears to have been very widely
used, and reappears
in the early art of nearly
all
races
so
far
as
I am
aware.
We
find
it,
for
instance,
in Assyrian carving and
in early Greek
decoration,
in China and Japan, and in European
mediaeval work of
all kinds.
Its charm perhaps
lies in
its
simplicity of construction yet rich orna-
mental
effect,
either as carved work
or as a
flat
painted diaper.
It might also be used as the geo-
metric basis of an elaborate repeating wall-pattern
over a large surface.
When
it comes to the choice of form, when we
are face to face with a particular problem in design,
ornament, or decoration
(say,
as most frequently
happens,
it
is to
fill a panel of a given shape and
size), we are bound
to consider form
in
relation
to that
particular
panel, to
the
subject we
pro-
pose
to
treat, and the method by which the de-
sign is to be produced, or the object and position
for which
it is intended.
This generally narrows
the range of possible choice.
Firstly, there
is the
shape of the panel itself.
A well-known exercise
for
the Teacher's
Certificate under the
Depart-
ment of Science and Art is to give a drawing of
a plant adapted to design in a square and a circle.
Now
in the
abstract
one would
be
inclined
to
select
for
a
circular
fitting
different forms from
those one might select for a square filling, since
I
always consider that the shape of the space must
influence the character of the filling
in
line and
form.
Still,
if the problem is
to
fill a square and
a
circle by the same forms, or an adaptation
of
them, we must
rely more and more upon
differ-
ence
of treatment of these
forms, and
not try to
79

FILLING OF SPACES
squeeze round
forms
into
rectangular
space,
or
rectangular forms into circular space.
In a rose,
for instance,
it would be possible to dwell on
its
angular side for the square, and on
its curvilinear
side for the
circle.
Anyway, we should
seek in
the first place a good and appropriate motive.
FILLING OF SQUARE SPACE.
Supposing the design is forwood inlay, we should
have to select forms that would not cause unneces-
sary difficulty in cutting, since every form
in the
design would have to be cut out in thin wood and
inserted
in
the corresponding hollow
cut
in the
panel or plank to receive
it.
Complex or compli-
cated forms would therefore be ruled out, as being

not only difficult or impossible to reproduce in the
material, but ineffective.

should
lead us
to

stract way, and making use of recurring line and
form as far as possible. We might make an effective
panel, say, for a casket, or a clock-case, or a floor, by
strictly limiting ourselves to very few and simple
forms
say, for instance, a stem, a leaf, a berry, or
disc, and a bird form, or fruit and
leaf forms.
It
would be possible to build up a design with such ele-
ments both pleasant in effect and well adapted to the

This
is
actually done with the working drawing by the in-

82

INLAY DESIGN
I once designed an inlaid floor for the centre of
a picture gallery.
The scale was rather large, and
the work was bold.
One kept to large, bold, and
simple forms
water-lilies and broad leaves, swans
scallop shells, and zigzag borders.
Forms which
can be readily produced by the brush would gene-
rally answer well for inlay, since they would have
simpleand sweeping boundaries and flat silhouette.
And for inlay one is practically designing in black,
white, or tinted silhouette. This makes it verygood
practice for all designers, both for the invention it
tends to call out, owing to the limited resources and
restriction as to forms, and also as giving
facility
and readiness in blocking in the masses of pattern.
The water-colour painter, too, would
find
that
blocking in in flat local colour all his forms and the
colours of his background was an excellent method
of preparatory work, and afforded good practice in
direct
painting, since he could add his secondary
shades and tints in the same manner until the work
was brought
to completion, while preserving that
fresh effect of the undisturbed washes which is the
great charm of water-colour.
In seeking forms to group together harmoniously
which
is
the whole
object of composition
we
shall
find that much the same kind
of principle
holds good whether we are arranging a
still-life
group or designing a wall-paper or
textile.
It
is
only a difference of degree and
scale.
In the one
case we are designing in the solid with the actual
objects, before drawing or painting them as a har-
monious pictorial composition
;
in the other we are
arranging forms upon the flat with a view to har-
monious composition with a strictly decorative pur-

In
the
first we are dealing with
concrete form

in the second, gene-
rally speaking, with abstract form in the flat.
But in either case we want harmony.
We can-
not, therefore, throw together a number of forms
unrelated to each in line, contour, or meaning. We
seek in composing or designing not contradictions,

but correspondences of form, with just an element
of contrast to give flavour and point.
In grouping
pottery, for instance, we should not place big and
little
or squat and slender forms
close together
without connecting links of some kind. We want
a series of good
lines that help one another and
lead up to one another
in a kind of friendly co-
operation.
Broad smooth forms and rounded sur-
faces, again, require relief and a certain amount of

perhaps, with our pottery form. We may safely

In
looking at the leaf of a
tree one may often see a
suggestion of the general character and contour of
the tree itself, and we know the line
:
"Just as the twig is bent the tree's inclined."
In dealing with angular motives the same prin-
ciple would be followed, but corresponding to the
difference of motive.

endeavour by making the design of these parts sim-

SOME ANALOGIES

ANALOGIES OF FORM
their special conditions, to render their association
decoratively possible.
Certain forms seem to lend themselves to design
in ornament better than others, because they give
the designer certain lines and masses which can be
harmoniously repeated or combined with other al-
lied forms or lines.
Design from this point of view
becomes a search for analogies of form.
I mentioned certain simple geometric forms com-
mon to nature and
art.
Early ornament consists
in the repetition of such forms.
The next step was
to connect them by lines
: and so form and
line,
through endless vicissitudes and complexities, be-
came united, to live happily in the world of decor-
ative motive ever after. But long after the primitive
unadorned geometric forms themselves have ceased
to be the chief forms in ornament, their controlling
influence
is asserted over the boundaries
of
the
more complicated masses introduced.
The simple rectangle is disguised under the
fret,
the
circle and
spiral
assert
their
swa-y over the
boundaries of the palmette, or circle and semicircle
unite to form the oval so frequently used both as a
unit in Greek ornament and as a controlling bound-
ary. These are typical border forms
:
for extension
and repetition
in fields of pattern we find the same
oeometric plans at work
in combination and sub-
division, forming at first the ornament
itself, and
afterwards
furnishing
the
plan
and
controlling
boundaries only.
Even in later stages in the evo-
lution
of surface
decoration,
in
what
are
called
naturalistic floral patterns, amid apparent careless-
ness and freedom, by the exigencies of repetition
the ghost of buried geometric connection reappears,

and compels the most naturalistic roses on a wall-
paper to acknowledge themselves artificial after all,
as they nod to their counterparts from the masked
angles of the inevitable diaper repeat.
We find in the historical forms of decorative art
constantly recurring types of form and
line,
such
as the lotus of the Egyptians, the anthemia of the
Greeks, the
pineapple-like flower and palmette of
the
Persians, the peony of the Chinese.
These
forms, at first valued solely for their symbolical and
heraldic
significance, and continually demanded,
became to the designer important elements or units
in ornament. They gave him fine sweeping curves,
radiating lines, and bold masses, without which a
designer cannot live, any more than a poet without
words.
They were capable, too, of infinite varia-
tion in treatment, a variation which has been con-
tinued ever
since,
as by importation
to
different
countries
(the movement going on from
east
to
west) the same forms were treated by designers of
different races, and became mixed with other native
elements, or consciously imitated as they are now
by Manchester designers and manufacturers, to be
sold again in textile form to their original owners,
as
it were, in the far East.
Truly, a strange turn
of the wheel.
The range of choice in ornamental units
is, in-
deed, embarrassingly large for themodern designer,
and a careful and tasteful selection becomes of more
and more importance.
It
is
not
the number of
forms you can combine, or because they are of Per-
sian or Chinese origin, that your work will be ar-
tistic, but the judicious and inventive use made of
the elements of your design.
Ready-made units,
94

ORNAMENTAL UNITS
such as the Oriental forms
I have mentioned, are
no doubt easier to combine, to make an effect with,
because a certain amount of selection has already
been done.
In fact, with such forms as the Persian
or Indian palmette, we are dealing with the results
of centuries of ornamental evolution, and with em-
blems immemorially treasured by ancient races.
It
behoves
us,
if we are called upon
to recombine
them, to treat them with sympathy, refinement, and
respect, and to let them deteriorate as little as pos-
sible, for the spirit of an important ornamental form
\is like a gathered flower
it soon withers and be-
comes limp.
It
is the
spirit, after
all, that
is the important
thing
to preserve,
in decorative
design, however
widely we may depart from the letter sometimes.
This is a difficult quality to define, but
I should say
it chiefly consists in a nice attention to the charac-
ter of form, the elastic spring of curves, an under-
standing of the construction and proportions, and
grasp of the effect
In designing we constantly feel
the need of repeating certain masses with variations
or balancing them by equivalents, or the necessity
of leading up to certain main forms by subsidiary
forms, and to carry out their lines in other parts of
the composition.
In designing figures or emblems,
for instance, within inclosed spaces, such as shields
or cartouche shapes, forming leading elements in a
design,
it requires much invention and ornamental
feeling

to arrange them
that, while

we might decide to throw the weight of pattern,

centre, with the pattern dark, the border might be
brought out on a dark field.
Or, again, for a less
emphatic treatment the quantities of the pattern
itself might be almost
infinitely varied, massive
forms and close fillings contrasting with open bor-
ders and united with intermediary bands.
SKETCH TO ILLUSTRATE VALUE OF DIFFERENT QUANTITIES
IN PERSIAN RUGS.
These intermediary bands or subsidiary borders
are very important
in Eastern rugs and carpets,
and their quantities very carefully considered. A
Persian designer, for instance, would never leave a
blank unbroken strip of colour to surround his field;
his object is not to isolate the quantities of his pat-
tern, but to distinguish and unite them
: so he makes
use of the subsidiary borders as additional quanti-
100

ties.
A
usual arrangement which always
looks
well
is
to have the border proper inclosed
in two
,
bands of about the same width and quantity in pat-
tern
or they might be a repeat
of each
other
and to inclose the
field or centre within another
narrow subsidiary border. But the variations to be
observed in any chance
selection of Persian rugs
or carpets are constant, and the amount of subtle
variety and invention
in these subsidiary borders
is endless.
Very excellent examples of the treatment and
distribution of quantities may also be studied in the
older Indian printed cottons, such as maybe seen
at South Kensington.
The consideration of quantities in form and de-
sign involves
the
question of contract) which,
in-
deed, can hardly be separated from
it.
There
is
the contrast of form and line, and the contrast of
colour and plane.
It is with the first kind we are
dealing now.
Take the simplest linear border, such as the type
common in Greek work. We should easily weary
of the
continual repetition of such a form alone
and unassisted, but add a vertical with an alterna-
tive dark filling, and we get a certain richness and
solidity which
is
a relief at once.
Add another
quantity, and we get the rich effect of the egg and
tongue or egg and dart moulding.
A
still simpler instance of the use of contrast,
however,
is the chequer, or the principle of equal
alternation of dark and
light
masses
;
but this
touches colour contrast rather than form.
The love of contrast makes the Chinese porce-
lain-painter break the blue borders
of his plates

ground, varied with a spray or device of some light
kind
;
or
the diagonal,

of his
woven silk by broad discs or cartouches of another
plane of ornament.
But the love of sharp or very
violent
contrasts, more
especially
of form, may
easily lead one astray and be destructive of orna-
mental effect.
Like all decorative considerations,
the artistic use of contrast depends much upon the
particular case and the conditions of the work, and
one cannot lay down any unvarying rules.
There
are agreeable and disagreeable contrasts, and their
choice and use must depend upon the individual
artist.
The most beautiful kinds of design rather seem
to depend upon the harmonious variation in asso-
ciation of similar
or
allied forms than on sharp
contrasts.
In compositions of figures the association of the
delicate curves and angles of the human form, and
the lines of drapery, with the emphatic verticals
and horizontals, the
semicircles and rectangles of
architectural form, for instance, are always delight-
ful in competent hands
;
as also compositions of
figure and landscape, with
its possibilities of undu-
lating line corrected by the severe horizon, or sea-
line, and contrasted with the vertical lines of trees,
stems, and the rich forms of foliage masses.
For the same reasons both of correspondence
and contrast, masses
of type or lettering of good
form
are admirable as
foils
to figure designs,
in
which commemorative monuments of all kinds and
book designs afford abundant opportunities to the
designer.

105

USE OF HUMAN FIGURE AND ANIMAL FORMS
In surface or
textile
decoration
of
all
kinds
nothing gives so much
relief and
vitality as
the
judicious use of animal forms and the human figure,
although they are not much favoured at
present.
The forms of birds and animals, if designed in re-
lation to the rest of the pattern, will give a pleas-
ant variety of form and line, and in their forms and
lines we
find just those elements both
of corre-
spondence and
contrast, in
their
relation to geo-
metric or to floral design, which are so valuable.
In order. to combine
such forms
successfully,
however, great care in designing is necessary; and
a good sound principle to follow as a general guide
is to make the boundaries of the bird or animal
touch
the
limits
of an
imaginary inclosing form
of some simple geometric or floral or leaf shape
(see p.
104).
This would at once control the form
and render
it available in a pattern as a decorative
mass or unit.
The particular shape of the con-
trolling form
must, of course,
depend upon
the
general character of the design, whether free and
flowing or square and restricted, the nature of the
repeat, the ultimate position of the work, and so on.
A study of Gothicheraldryand the earlySicilian silk
patterns would be very instructive in this connec-
tion, since
it is rather the
heraldic ideal than that
of the natural history book which
is decoratively
appropriate. At the same time
it
is quite possible
to combine ornamental treatment with a great deal
of natural truth in structure and character.
Much the same principles apply to the treatment
of the human figure
as an element
in ornament
;
they should
be
designed,
whether singly
or
in
groups, under
the
control of imaginary bound-

aries, and care must be taken that in line and mass
they re-echo (or are re-echoed by) other lines which
connect them with the rest of the design,
if they
occur as incidents in repeating wall-paper or hang-
ing design, for instance.
It
is, however, quite pos-
sible to imagine a decorative effect produced by
the use of figures alone (see
p.
105), with some-
thing
very subsidiary
in the way
of connecting
links of linear or
floral pattern, much
as
figures
were used by the ancient Greek
vase-painters,
beautifully distributed
as ornament over the con-
cave or convex surfaces of the vases and vessels
of the potter, the forms of which, as
all good de-
coration should do, they helped to express as well
as to adorn

THE
function of line considered from the point
of view of
its
controlling
influence
as
a
boundary, or inclosure,
of design, upon which
I
touched
in
the
last chapter,
is a very important
one, and deserves most attentive study.
The usual problem a designer in the flat has to
solve is to fill harmoniously a given space or panel
defined by a line
some simple geometric form-
such as a square or a circle, a parallelogram, a dia-
mond, a lunette.
Now
it
is
possible
to regard such
spaces or
panels as more or less unrelated, and simply as the
boundaries of an individual composition or picture
of somekind.
Yetevensoconsideredacertain sense
of geometric control would come in in the selection
of our lines and masses, both in regard to each other
and in regard to the shape of the inclosing bound-
ary.
We seem to feel the need of some answer-
ing line or re-echo in the character of the compo-
sition to the shape of
its boundary, to give
it its

distinctive reason
for existence
in that particular
form
just as we should expect a shell-fish to con-
form to the shape of
its shell.
Such a re-echo or
acknowledgment might be ever so slight, or might
be
quite emphatic and dominate as
the leading
motive, but for perfectly harmonious effect
it must
be there.
A strictly simple and logical linear filling of such
spaces might be expressed
in the most primitive
way, as in the illustration on
p.
109.
By these means certain primitive types of orna-
ment are evolved, such as the Greek volute and
the Greek key or
fret, the logical ornament of a
logical people.
Such arrangements
of line form simple linear
patterns, and a decorative effect of surface
is pro-
duced simply by their repetition, especially
if the
principle of alternation be observed.
This prin-
ciple may be expressed by taking, say, a series of
squares or circles, and placing them either in aline
as for a border arrangement, or for extension ver-
tically and laterally over a surface, and filling only
the alternate square or circle, leaving the alternate
ones, or dropping them out altogether (see illus-
tration,
p.
111).
When we desire
to go beyond such
primitive
linear ornaments, however, and
introduce natural
form, we should
still be guided by the same prin-
ciples,
if we desire to produce a strictly decorative
effect, while varying them
in application
to any
extent
. It matters not what forms we deal with,
floral,
animal, human; directly we come to combine them
in a design, to control them by a boundary, to in-

close them in a space, we
shall
feel
this necessity
of controlling
line,
which, however concealed,
is
yet essential to bring them into that harmonious
relation which
is the
essence of
all design
(see
illustration,
p.
1 12).
We may take
it as a general rule that the more
purely ornamental the purpose of our design, and
j the more abstract in form
it
is, the more emphati-
i cally we may carry out the
principle
of
corre-
spondence of line between
that
of the
inclosing
boundary and that of the
design
itself
; and,
vice
versa, as the design becomes more pictorial in
its
appeal and more complex and
varied
in
its
ele-
ments,
the more we may combine the leading
motive or principle of line with secondary ones, or
with variations, since every fresh element, every
new direction of line, every new form introduced,
demands some kind
of re-echo
to bring
it
into
relation with the other elements of the design, or
parts
of the
composition, whatever may
be
its
nature and purpose.
Now,
if we seek further the meaning and origin
of this necessity of the control of geometric lines
and spaces in design,
I think we shall find
it in the
constructive necessities of architecture
:
for
it
is
certainly from
architecture that we derive
those
typical spaces and panels the designer is so often
called upon to
fill.
Lintel architecture
the Egyptian and the Greek
gave us the frieze, both continuous, as in that of
the Cella of the Parthenon, or divided by triglyphs,
which represented the ends of the beams of the
primitive timber construction
; and the interstices
left between these determined
the shape of the

sculptured panel
or slab inserted, and influenced
the character of its masses and the lines of its de-
sign, which was under the necessity of harmonizing
with the whole building (see illustration, p. 114).
The same may be said of the pediments.
The
angle of the low-pitched roof left another interstice

ORIGIN OF GEOMETRIC DECORATIVE SPACES
for the sculptor at each end of the building
; and
I
have elsewhere
1 pointed out the influence of the
inclosing space and the angles of the pediment of
the Parthenon upon the arrangement of the groups
within
it, and even upon the lines taken by some
of the figures, especially the reclining figures near
the acute angles.
Certain lines become inseparably associated with
constructive expression, and are used to emphasize
it, as the vertical flutings of the Doric column, by
repeating the lines of the column itself, emphasize
its constructive expressionofsupporting the weight
of the horizontal lintels, the lines of which, repeated
in the mouldings of the frieze and cornice, are as-
sociated with level restfulness and secure repose.
As examples of design which, while meeting the
structural necessities and acknowledging the con-
trol of space and general conditions, as the form
of the slabs upon which they are .sculptured, yet
expresses independent movement, the figures of
the octagonal tower of the winds
at Athens are
interesting (see illustration, p.
115).
Quite a different
feeling, corresponding to dif-
ferences in conception and spirit in design, comes
in with the Roman round arck,\v\\\\ its allied forms
of spandril and va^Ut, lunette and medallion, pre-
senting new spaces
for the
surface designer, and
new suggestions of ornamental line(see illustration,
p.
117).
It
is
noticeable how, with the round-
arched architecture under Roman, Byzantine
(see
illustration,
p.
118), and Renaissance forms, the
scroll form of ornament developed, the reason be-
ing,
I think, that
it gave the necessary element of

being
indeed
generally an
essential part of the structure, and
architectural
features being constantly repeated
and utilized for their ornamental value, as
in the
case of canopies and tabernacle work.
We
see,
for instance,
in the Decorated period
the acute gable moulding over the arched recess,
niche, doorway, or tomb, lightened and vivified by
a
floriated
finial springing
into vigorous curves
from
a vertical stem, forming an emphatic ogee
outline which re-echoes the ogee line of the arch
below, and is taken up in variations by the crockets
carved upon
the
sides of the
gable;
and
their
spiral ascending lines lead the eye up to the finial
which completes the composition.
We may trace
the same principle in the carved fillings of the sub-
sidiary parts, such as the
trefoiled panels, the se-
condary mouldings, and the cusps of the arches,
which continue the line-motive or decorative har-
mony to the
last point (see
illustration,

VALUE OF RECURRING LINE
The elegance and lightness of the pinnacles is in-
creased in the same way, and further emphasized
by the long vertical lines of the sunk panels upon
their sides.

is marked

controlled in the design of its
contour by the squareness of the block of stone

it is carved (see illustration, p. 121).
The carvings of miserere seats in our cathedral
choirs often afford
instances of ingenious design
and arrangement of elements
difficult to combine,
yet. always showing the
instinct of following the
control of the dominating form and peculiar lines
of the

itself.

I won't pretend
to say, but
it evidently
is intended to suggest cupboard love, and there is
a portentously large pitcher of
ale
in reserve on
the bench.
But note the clever arrangement of
the masses and
lines, and how the

tradition which
seemed
to
be
almost
instinctive
with mediaeval
workmen
a tradition which yet left the individual
free, and under which design was a thing of life

and
grafting freely new inventions

fresh phantasy upon the ancient stock

ment in art
in the Middle Ages, exhibiting as it
does
a gradual growth and a
constant
vitality,
always
accompanying

to
structural changes,
to
life and
habit, was
really
more analogous to the development of mechanical
science in our own day, where each new machine
is allied to
its predecessors, though
it supplants
them.
The one law being adaptability, the one
aim
to apply means to ends, and more and more
perfectly, inessentials and superfluities are
shed,
and
invention triumphs.
It
is, too, a
collective
advance, since each engineer, each inventor, builds
upon the experience of both
his forerunners and
his fellow-workers, and everything
is brought to
an immediately practical test.
We are not yet in the same healthy condition as
regards
art, and
art can never be on

science,
though

may

from

perhaps
in

direction

is complicated by
human feeling and association, and her strongest
appeal
is to these, and by these, and as yet we do
not seem to have any terms or equivalents precise
enough to describe, or any analysis fine enough to
discover them.
The next consideration in spacing we may term

EXTENSION
extension.
This
bears upon
all
surface
design,
but more especially upon the design of patterns
intended to repeat over a large
surface, and not
specially designed for particular spaces.
It
is a
great question whether any design can be entirely
satisfactory unless
it has been thought out in rela-
tion
to some
particular
extent
of surface
or as
adapted to some particular wall or room. Modern
industrial conditions preclude
this
possibility
as
a
rule, and
so the only
sure ground, beyond in-
dividual taste and preference,
is technical adapta-
bility to process or material. We should naturally
want to give a different character to a textile pat-
tern, whether printed or woven, and intended
to
hang in folds, from one for flat extension as a wall-
paper
;
and a
different
character
again
to such
designs intended
for extension horizontally from
those intended for
vertical space
alone.
Floor
patterns, parquets and carpets, for instance, natur-
ally demand
different
treatment from
wall pat-
terns, as those orders of plants in
nature which
cling and spread on the flat ground
differ from
those which grow high and maintain themselves
in
the
air, or climb upon trees.
The rule of
life
adaptability
obtains
in
art as
in
nature,
and,
beneath individual preference and passing fashion,
works the silent but real law of relation to condi-
tions.
This again bears upon the choice of scale,
and differentiates the design of dress textiles from
furniture
textiles, and the design
of varied
sur-
faces and objects, which, while demanding their
own particular treatment, are brought into general
relation
by
their association
with
use and
the
wa^ts of humanity.

GEOMETRIC STRUCTURAL PLANS, ETC.
The law governing
extension
of design
over
surface
is again geometric, and our primal
circle
and square are again the factors and progenitors
of the leading systems which have governed the
design of diapers and wall patterns and hangings
of all kinds.
Nay, the first weaver of the wattle d
fence
discovered
the
principle
of extension
in
design, and
showed
its
inseparable
association
with construction
; and
the builder with brick or
stone
emphasizes
it,
producing the
elements of
linear surface pattern, from the mechanical neces-
sity of the position of the joints of his structure.
At

German
railway
station
waiting-room
I
noticed an
effective adaptation
of
this principle
as a
wall decoration
in two blues upon
a stone
colour (see
illustration, p.
128).
We may
build
upon such emphatic structural lines, either incor-
porating them with
the design
motive, as
in
all
rectangular wall
diapers, or we may suppress
or
conceal the actual
constructive
lines by
placing
the principal parts or connections 'of our pattern
over them, but one cannot construct a satisfactory
pattern
to repeat and extend without them
;
for
these constructive lines or plans give the neces-
sary organic life and vigour
to such
designs, and
are as needful to them as the trellis to the tendrils
of the vine (see illustration, p.
129).
The same principle
is true of designs upon the
curvilinear
plan.
The
mere
repetition
of
the
circle by
itself gives
us
a simple geometric
pat-
tern, and we are
at
liberty
to emphasize this cir-
cular plan as the main motive
;
or, as
in

of the rectangular plans,
to
treat
it merely as
a
basis, and develop free scroll motives upon

These simple geometric plans are
the most generally useful as plans of designs in-

a geometric plan

will
be
necessary, or an equivalent for
it, since each curve
must be
counterbalanced
in some way,
though
not
necessarily
symmetrically,
of
course
;
and
even where a square
of pattern
say to a wall-
paper repeat of twenty-one
inches
has been de-
signed, not consciously upon a geometric base, but
simply as a composition of lines and
masses
to
repeat,
the
mechanical
conditions
of
the
work
when
it comes to be printed will supply a certain
geometric
control,
since
it necessarily begins
in
the
process
of repetition
a
series
of squares of
pattern in which
the curves
are bound
to
recur
in
corresponding
places.
Without a geometric
plan of some
sort, however, we may
easily get
into difficulties with awkward leading lines, gaps,
or masses, that tumble down, and are
only per-
ceived when the paper is printed and hung.
The designer should not feel at all restricted or
cramped by his geometric plan, but treat
it as an
aid and a scaffolding, working in as much variety
and richness of detail
as he
likes, bound only by
132

FRIEZE AND FIELD
the necessity of repeating or counterbalancing his
forms
and
lines.
In
the
diagram (p.
131) the
plan of making a repeat less obvious by means of
what
is
termed
"a
drop"
is
given, and
this
system
also
increases
the apparent
width
of a
pattern.
The feeling which demands some kind of con-
trast or relief to a field of repeating pattern, how-
ever
interesting
in
itself, seems now almost
in-
stinctive.
It is felt, too, in
the case of plain sur-
faces, where the eye seeks a moulding
to give a
little variety or pattern-equivalent in play of light
and shadow upon
different planes,
lines, or con-
cavities and
convexities.
The common
plaster
cornice placed
to
unite walls and ceiling, in our
ordinary houses, is a concession (on the part even
of the jerriest of builders) to
the
aesthetic sense.
We
get
the
decorated
frieze
in
architecture
in
obedience to
the same demand, though originally
a necessary
feature of
lintel construction,
as we
have seen, from
the days
of the
festal
garland
hung around the eaves of the classic house, to
its
perpetuation
in stone in so many varieties.
1 The
carved garland depending
in a series of graceful
curves,
or
contrasted
with
pendants,
or
their
rhythm punctuated, as
it were, by ox-heads, as on
the
temple
of
the
Sibyls,
Tivoli,
formed
the
needed contrast to the plane masonry of
the wall
below.
Sculptured
figures,
with
the added
in-
terest of story, as on the
choragic monument
of
Lysicrates,
fulfilled
the same decorative function
in a more complex and elaborate way.
To
satisfy the same feeling we
place
a
frieze
1
See " Bases of Design."
J 33

FRIEZE AND FIELD
above
the
patterned
field
of our modern
wall-
papers.
Such a
frieze may be
considered as a
contrasting border
to
the
pattern
of
the
field,
much as
the
border
of
a
carpet,
allowing
for
difference of material and position
;
or the
frieze
may assert
itself as
the dominant decoration
of
the room.
In
this case
it would
be greater
in
depth
than
the
simpler
bordering
type.
The
interest df the
field
filling would
then
be
sub-
sidiary, arid lead up
to the frieze.
In wall-paper
friezes the difficulty
in designing
is to think of a
motive which
will not
tire
the eye
in
the neces-
sarily
frequent
repeats
of
twenty-one
inches.
Longer ones have
occasionally been
produced,
the
limit being sixty
inches.
It
is often a good
plan
to
recur
in
the main
lines or
forms of the
frieze to some
variation of the
lines or forms of
the field.
If, for instance, the main motive in the
field was a vertical scroll design, a horizontal scroll
design
upon
a
large
scale used
for
the
frieze
would answer, the field being kept flat and quiet
;
or the fan, or radiating shell form, used as a frieze,
above a pattern on the scale plan, would be quite
harmonious.
Relation and
balance
of
line and
mass,
and
arrangement
of
quantities
in
such
designs, are the chief considerations.
With
painting or modelling an
artist
is freer,
as he
is
at liberty
to design
a continuous frieze
of figures, and
introduce
as much variety
as he
chooses.
A
painted
frieze
of figures above
plain oak-
panelling has a good
effect
in
a large and
well-
proportioned
room,
and
is
perhaps
one of
the
pleasantest ways of treating interior walls.

CEILING DECORATION
Ceiling decoration, again, presents problems of
extension
in
designing, and the large flat plaster
ceilings of modern rooms are by no means easy
to deal with
satisfactorily.
The simplest way
is
to resort to wall-paper, and here, restricted in size
of repeat and the usual technical requirements
of
the work, the designer must further consider ap-
propriateness
of scale, and position
in regard
to
eye, relation to the wall, and so forth.
The
natural demand
is
for something simpler
in treatment than the
walls
a
re-echo, in some
sort, of plans agreeable
to the
floor, yet with
a
suggestion of something lighter and
freer: here
we may safely come back
to rectangular and cir-
cular plans again for our leading lines and forms.
Painting and modelling,
again, offer more
ela-
borate treatment and
possibilities, and we know
that
beautiful
works have
been
done
in
both
ways
; but art of this kind seems more appropriate
to lofty vaulted chambers and
churches, such
as
one
sees
in
the
palaces
of
Italy, at Genoa and
Venice, at Florence and Rome.
I remember a very striking and bold treatment
of a flat-beamed ceiling
in the Castle
of Nurem-
berg,
where
a
huge
black
German
eagle
was
painted so as to occupy nearly the whole field of
the
ceiling, but treated
in an extremely
flat and
heraldic way, the
long
feathers of
the wings fol-
lowing the lines of the beams and falling parallel
upon
them
and between
them
; and
upon
the
black wings and body of the eagle different shields
of arms were displayed
in gold and colours, the
eagle
itself being painted upon
the
natural
un-
painted wood
oak,
I think.
The work belonged
136

CO-OPERATIVE RELATION
to the thirteenth or fourteenth century,
1
believe.
It seemed
the very
antithesis of
Italian finesse
and
fancy,
but
the
fitness
of
such
decoration
entirely depends upon
its relation to its surround-
ings, which in this case were perfectly appropriate.
That
is the great point to bear
in mind
in
all
design
the
sense
of
relation
; nothing
stands
alone
in
art.
Lines and forms
must harmonize
with other forms and lines
:
the
elements of any
design must meet in
friendly co-operation
;
it
is
not a blind struggle
for
existence, a
fierce com-
petition, or a
strife
for ascendency between one
motive and another, one form and
another, or a
war of conflicting efforts.
There may be a struggle
outside the
design,
in
the mind of the designer.
He may have
tried
hard
against
difficulties
to
express what he
felt, and have only reached har-
mony through discord and
strife,
but
the work
itself should be serene
; we should feel
that, how-
ever
various
its
elements, they
are
not
without
their purpose and relation one to another, that all
is ordered and organized in harmonious lines, that
everything has
its use and place, that, in
short,
it
illustrates that excellent motto, whether for art or
life
:
" Each for all, and all for each."

WE
may take
it, then, from
the
principles
and examples
I have endeavoured to put
before you
in
the
previous
chapters, that
there
are
three fundamental elements or essentials
of
Design
Line, 'Form, Space.
Line we
need,
not
only
for our ground-plan
and framework, but
also to define or express our
forms.
Form we
need
to
give
substance
and
mass, interest and variety
; and
it is obvious that
Space
is required
to contain
all
these elements,
while Space asserts its influence, as we have seen,
upon both
Line and Form
in combination upon
it, whether object
or surface, by the shape of
its
boundary, the extension of its plane, and the angle
and position of
its plane in regard to the
eye, as
well as from the point of view of material and use.
Questions
of the
character
of line and
form,
and their combination and disposition
in or over
spaces, are questions of composition.
They de-
mand the most careful solution, whatever our sub-
138

FUNDAMENTAL ESSENTIALS OF DESIGN
ject and purpose may be, from the simplest linear
border up
to
the most elaborate
figure
design.
But although the three
essentials
to composition
must be always present,
it
is always possible
to
rely more upon the
qualities of one
of them for
our main motive and
interest, keeping the other
two
subsidiary.
We might
centralize
the chief
interest
of
our
composition
upon
Line,
for
in-
stance, and make harmonious relation or combina-
tion
of
lines
our
principal
object
(as
in
line-
design and ornament), or we might rather dwell
upon
the
contours,
masses, and
contrasts
and
relationships
of Form
:
as
in
pictorial
design,
figure
compositions
of
all
kinds, and 'modelling
and
sculpture:
or, again, we might
choose
that
the
peculiar
character
given by
the
control
of
certain
inclosing
spaces
should
determine the
interest
of our design, as the due
filling of par-
ticular panels and geometric shapes
;
or seek the
interest of aerial perspective
in the
pictorial and
atmospheric expression of space.
Taking combinations of Line first, and bearing
in mind what
has been
said regarding
its
capa-
cities for expression, whether of emotion, direction
of force, movement, rest, as well as of facts of struc-
ture and surface, let us see if we can trace the prin-
ciple of harmonious
composition, of which
these
things may be considered as parts.
Look at any of the systems of line in the organic
structures of nature
: the radiating ribs of the scal-
lop shell, or the spiral of many other varieties
; the
set of the feathers upon the expanded wing of a
bird
;
the radiation of the sun's rays
;
the flowing
line of the wave movement
; the lines of structure
139

PRINCIPLES OF STRUCTURAL AND ORNAMENTAL LINE IN
NATURAL FORMS.
I4O

LINE IN ORGANIC FORMS
in
flowers and
leaves
;
the scales
of a
fish
;
the
scales of a pine-cone or an
artichoke.
We
feel
that any of these combinations of lines are harmo-
nious and
beautiful, and we know
that they are
essential to the character and structure.
They are
organic lines, in short. They mean life and growth.
In principle they are radiating and recurring lines
;
in each form they repeat each other in varying de-
grees of direction and declension
of curve.
No
two
lines are alike, yet
there
is no contradiction
and no unnecessary line, and variety
is combined
with
unity.
Each
affords a
perfect
instance
of
harmonious composition of
line, and gives us de-
finite
principles upon which to work (see illustra-
tion, p.
140).
These systems of line
in organic nature have
been adopted and adapted by art, and are found
throughout the historical forms of ornament which,
as we have good reason to believe, were often de-
rived from mechanical
structures, illustrating the
same principles
; which,
again, the logic
of geo-
metry enforces in drawing on plane surfaces.
All organic structures teach us the same lesson
of relation and recurrence of line.
The bones of
all vertebrate animals, from fish to'man, illustrate
the constant repetition in different degrees of the
same character and direction of line.
The verte-
bral column itself is an instance, and the recurring
spring of the ribs from
it, like the branches from
the stem of a tree, further expressed in the ramifi-
cation of the jointed bones of the limbs and extrem-
ities.
The principle may be followed out
in the
structure of the muscles in their radiating
fibres,
which the
delicate contours and flowing
lines of

the surface of the body only combine in a greater
degree of subtlety (see illustration, p.
142).
Look
at the anatomy of any
tree, as
it
is dis-
closed
to us
in
its wintry leaflessness, a beautiful
composition of line rather than of form (see illus-
tration, p.
143).
Here we see organic life and structure expressed
in the vigorous spring of inter-dependent and cor-
responding curves, from the rigid sinuous column
of the main stem springing from the ground, pre-
sently divided into the main forks of the branches,
which again subdivide and subdivide into smaller
forks, so that the tree may sustain and spread
its
life
in the
air and
the
sun, both supporting and
continuing its existence by this wonderful economic
system of co-operative, subdivided, and graduated
helpfulness.
The massive green pavilion of summer, which
this
delicate
vaulting
of
branch-work
sustains,
gives
us
another, more sumptuous,
but perhaps
not
a
greater
beauty
in
the
combination
or
substitution
of form and mass
for
line composi-
tion.
We might express, in an abstract way, the prin-
ciple of the line-structure of the ramifying tree by
super-imposing vertically fork upon fork in gradu-
ally diminishing scale, either
curvilinear or rect-
angular
; and the principle of
the
mass-structure
in the formation of the foliage might be expressed
by a series of overlapping curves,
suggestive of
scales or cloud masses
:
to both of which indeed
they correspond in principle, illustrating the scale
principle in detail and the cloud
principle
in
the
mass
; thus

bound to do, whether symmetric or alternate in their

The principle of structure here
is just the same
as the overlapping principle of the tiles and slates
upon our ordinary house-roofs
; but each leafy tile
is different, being alive, and in the mass infinitely
varied and beautiful in form and colour, instead of
being mechanical and uniform, as we try to make
our artificial

old towers at Lindau has such a roof, and the colour
effect
is very rich and striking.
But
I must not be led into a disquisition upon
roofs further than
in so
far as they illustrate the
subject of composition of line and form, and from
147

GERMAN ROOFS
the painter's point of view they frequently do in a
very delightful and instructive way.
What,
for
instance,
can
be more
varied and
charming than the compositions we constantly meet
with
in
the
rich backgrounds
of Albert Durer ?
Those steep barn roofs, and those quaint German
towns inclosed in walls with protecting towers
nests of steep tiled gables of every imaginable de-
gree
which give so much character and interest
to his designs, as in the background of his copper-
plates
" The Prodigal Son" and "St. Anthony" here
given.
Their prototypes still exist here and there
in Germany, in such towns as Rothenburg, prac-
tically unchanged since the sixteenth century, and
give one an excellent idea of what such houses
were like.
A visit there
is like a
leap back into
the Middle Ages.
Every street
is a varied and
interesting composition. No two houses are alike.
They were built by the citizens to really pass their
lives
in.
The town
is strongly placed upon
the
crest of a hill, with a river at its foot, and well for-
tified and protected by massive encircling walls
and towers and deep gates, which give it so strong
and picturesque a character, while the timber and
tile-roofed gallery for the warders
still exists along
the inside of the walls.
Such
cities arose by the
strength of the social bond among men
the neces-
sity for mutual help in the maintenance of a higher
standard of life, and mutual protection against the
ravages of sinister powers.
Strong externally, internally they were made as
home-like and full of the varied delight of the eyes,
as if the people had reasoned, " Since we must live
close together
in a small place, let us make it as
148

delightful and romantic
as we
can."
We know
that the idea of Paradise and the New Jerusalem
to the imagination of the Middle Ages was always
149

THE MEDIAEVAL CITY
the fair walled garden and the fenced city.
The
painters embodied the idea of security and protec-
tion from
the
savage
and
destructive
forces
of
nature and man
a sanctuary of peace,
a garden
of delight.
We have in modern times turned rather from the
city as a complete and beautiful thing, to the indi-
vidual home, and to the interior of that, and, in the
modern competitive search for the necessary straws
and
sticks
to
make
our
individualist-domestic
composition of comfort and artistic completeness,
bowers are too often builtupon the ruins of others,or
are fair by reason of surrounding degradation. The
common collective comfort and delight of the eyes
is too often ignored, so that
it comes about that, if
our modern cities possess any elements of beauty or
picturesqueness, it
is rather owing to accidents and
to the transfiguring effects of atmosphere than to the
beauty or variety of architectural form and colour.
We have to seek inspiration among the fragments
of the dead past in monuments and art schools.
The modern development of the municipality
and
extension
of
its
functions
may,
indeed, do
something, as
it has done, and
is doing, something
to protect public health and further public educa-
tion
; but we have yet
to wait for the full results,
and everything must finally depend upon the public
spirit and disinterestedness of the citizens, and in
matters of art upon a very decided but somewhat
rare and peculiar sympathy and
taste, as well as
enthusiasm.
The absence of beauty of line, form, and propor-
tion from the external aspects of daily life in towns
has probably a greater effect than we are apt to
150

ORGANIC AND ACCIDENTAL BEAUTY
realize in deadening the
imagination, and
it
cer-
tainly seems to produce a certain
insensibility to
beauty of line and composition, since the percep-
tion must necessarily be
blunted by being inured
to the commonplace and sordid.
The instinct for
harmony of line and form becomes weakened, and
can only be slowly revived by long and
careful
study
in
art,
instead of finding
its
constant and
most vital stimulus in every street.
For all that, however, an eye trained to observe
and select may, even
in the dullest and dingiest
street, find artistic suggestions,
if not in the build-
ings, then
in
the
life.
And where there
is
life,
movement, humanity, there
is sure to be character
and interest.
Groups of children playing will give
us
plenty of suggestions
for
figure composition.
Workpeople going
to and from
their work, the
common works going on in the street, the waggons
and horses, the shoal of faces, the ceaseless stream
of life
all these things, whether we are able to re-
produce them as direct illustrations of the life of our
time, or are moved only to select from them vivid
suggestions
to give
force
to
ideal conceptions,
should all be noted
photographed, as
it were, in-
stantaneously upon the sensitive plate of the mind's
vision.
We can only learn the laws of movement
by observing movement
the swing and poise of
the figure, the
relation of the lines of limbs and
drapery to the
direction
of
force and centre of
gravity,
so important in composition.
We must
constantly supplement our school and studio work
by these direct impressions of vivid life and move-
ment, and neglect no opportunity or despise no
source or suggestion.

FORMAL COMPOSITION
There are still in England to be found such old-
world corners as the quaint
street of Canterbury
(p.
153), which forms an excellent study
in
the
composition of angular and vertical lines.
We may perceive
that there
are
at
least two
kinds of composition, which may be distinguished
as
:
I.
Formal.
II.
Informal.
I. Under
the head of Formal may be classed
all those systems of structural
line with which
I
started, and
which
are found
either
as
leading
motives or fundamental plans and bases through-
out ornamental design.
Yet even
these may be
used
in composition of figures and other forms
where the object
is more or less formal and deco-
rative, as governing plans or controlling lines.
The radiating ribs of a fan, for instance, might
be utilized as the natural boundaries and inclosing
lines of a
series of vertical figures following the
radiating
lines.
A
strictly
logical
design of the
kind would
be a series of figures with
uplifted
arms, forming radiating lines from
the
shoulders,
somewhat
in the position of Blake's well-known
and beautiful composition of the Morning Stars in
the Book of Job, already illustrated.
Using
the overlapping
vertical
scale plan we
should get relative positions for a formal composi-
tion of three figures, although they need not neces-
sarily be
formal
in
detail.
A typical
design
of
three
associated
ideas
treated
emblematically
would be
the
most
natural use
of such an
ar-
rangement
as Faith, Hope, and Charity
; Liberty,
Equality,
Fraternity;
Science,
Art, and
Indus-

FORMAL COMPOSITION
try

Pallas,
and

as choice and purpose might
decide.
A semicircular
scale plan would
not only repeat
in a
safe and sound manner,
but would
afford
suggestive shapes
in which to
throw
designs of
figures, and could be effectively utilized either for
a wall or ceiling repeat.
The inclosure formed by two spiral
lines gives
a
graceful ornamental shape
for a
half-reclining
figure
;
while a series of floating or flying figures
linking
their
hands
would
be
appropriately
governed by similar spiral lines, uniting them with
the meandering wave line (see illustration, p. 155).
Upon a series of semicircles or
ellipses, alter-
nating
horizontally,
might
be
arranged
a
little
frieze of children with skipping ropes, or Amorini
with pendent garlands
;
the up-and-down move-
ment
in
the
former case
being
conveyed by
a
variation, each
alternate
semicircle being
struck
upwards.
This would restore the emphatic wave
or spiral
line, which always conveys the sense of
rhythmic movement in a design.
Such a line, vertically employed, will give again
a good plan for a series of seated figures, say em-
blematic of the Hours, where similarity of attitude
and type would be appropriate, while the emblems
and accessories might be varied. A severer treat-
ment would be suggested by making the controlling
line angular (see illustration, p.
1 56).
Such
are
a
few
illustrations
of what
I have
termed
formal
composition,
in
which
the
geo-
metric and
structural plans of pure ornament or
ornamental line maybe utilized to combine, control,
or even suggest figure designs.

INFORMAL COMPOSITION
II. While formal
compositions, though
natur-
ally falling
into
classes and types, may be varied
to a very great extent, when we come to informal
compositions the variations are
unlimited, and a
vista
of
extraordinary
and
apparently
endless
choice,
invention, and
selection opens out before
the
designer,
co-extensive
with
the
variety of
nature herself.
In seeking harmonious and expressive composi-
tion in the pictorial direction the guides are much
less definite and
secure.
Individual
feeling and
instinct, which must have an important influence
in
all
kinds
of designing,
are
in
this
direction
paramount. Yet even here, if we look beneath the
apparent freedom and informality, we find certain
laws at work which seem
to
differ only in degree
from the more definite and constructive control of
.line which we have been considering.
In the first
place, there are our direct impressions from nature;
and, secondly, our conscious aims and
efforts
to
'express an idea in our minds.
We have the same
restricted
and
definite
forms of language and
materials in each case
line, form, space, brushes,
pencil,
colour, paper,
canvas,
or
clay.
We
are
taken by some particular scene
:
the composition
of line and form

We do not stop as a rule to
ask
why,
since
it
usually
takes
all
our
time
and our best skill to get into shape what we are
seeking
and carry away with us an artistic record
of the place.
We have seen that
in
the case of
certain natural
structures,
shells,
leaves, flowers,
the fundamental
structural
lines are so beautiful
that they not only form ornament in themselves,
157

but furnish the basis for whole types and
families
of ornament.
When we
look
at
a
landscape,
putting
aside
for
the
moment
all
the
surface
charms of colour and effect, and concentrating our
attention upon its lines of structures, we shall find
that
it owes
a great part of its beauty to the har-
monious relation of its leading lines, or to certain
I pleasant contrasts, or a certain
impressiveness
of
form and
mass, and at
the same
time we
shall
perceive that this linear expression
is inseparable
from the sentiment or emotion suggested by that
particular scene.
A

-
- undulating
downs,
and
wandering
sheep-walks
;
the
soft

of
the
sheep
upon

turf
all
these
are
so many
notes
or
words in the language of line and form which go
to express the idea of pastoral
life.
They are in-
extricably bound up with inseparable associations
conveyed
by
such
lines and
forms.
The un-
dulating lines of resting or dancing figures would
only give point, true emphasis, and variety, and a
note of contrast in the forms would serve to bring
out the general sentiment more strongly.
Substitute rugged rocks, swollen torrents, wind-
tossed trees and stormy skies, and all is changed.
Such things cannot be expressed
without much
more emphatic lines and masses, and the use of
opposing angles and
energetic
curves of move-
ment which would be destructive of the sentiment
of peace, in other cases. Yet even then to convey
the
expression
of energy and
rapid movement,
concerted groups of lines are none the less neces-
sary (see illustration,
p.
159).

INFORMAL COMPOSITION
Such comparisons indicate not only that there
is a
necessary association of ideas with
certain
lines and
forms, but
also
that
certain
relations
and
associations of
line
of
a
similar
character
are necessary to produce a harmonious composi-
tion, and one which conveys a
definite and
per-
vading sentiment or emotion, just as we saw that
the controlling lines of structural curves,
spirals,
and angles require to be in relation, and to be re-
echoed by the character of the design they inclose,
or which
is built upon them.
The same law holds true in figure composition.
The sense of repose and restfulness necessary to
sitting or reclining groups depends upon the gentle
declivities of the curves and their gradual descent
to the horizontal.
Draw
a
figure
sitting
rigid,
tense, and
alert,
and you destroy the sense of repose at once, and
you are obliged also to resort to angles, still more
emphatic where strong action
is to be expressed
;
while
to
express
continual or progressive move-
ment, a choice of associated lines of action in dif-
ferent stages of progress leading up
to
the cres-
cendo
of the final one (as in a group of mowers)
would be necessary (see illustrations,
p. 161). We
cannot, then, in any composition have too definite
a conception. We must, at any sacrifice of detail,
bring
out
the
main
expression
and
meaning.
Every group of
figures must be
in the
strictest
relation to each other and to the central interest
or expression of the design.
You cannot, for in-
stance, in a procession of figures, make your faces
turn
all sorts of ways without stopping the onward
movement which
is essential to the idea of a pro-
160

cession.
This would not preclude variety, but the
general tendency must be in one direction. Every
line in a composition must lead up to the central
idea,
and be
subordinated
or contributory
to
it
(see illustration, Nos.
i and
2, p.
163).
The

masses
:
you
cannot
put
a
number
of forms
together without some sort of
relation, either of general character and contour
or some uniting line. We may learn this principle
from nature also.
Look at a heap of broken stones
and debris, which in detail may contain all sorts of
varieties of form, as we find them tumbled down
a steep
place,
as
the rocky bed
of a mountain
stream, a heap of boulders upon a hillside, or the
debris from a quarry or mine; in each case the law
of gravity and
the persistence
of force working
together
arrange
the
diverse
forms
in
masses
controlled by the
lines, which express
the direc-
tion
and degree of descent, and the pressure of
force.
The same thing may be seen on any hilly
ground
after
heavy
rain
;
the
scattered pebbles
are
arranged
in
related
groups, combined
and
composed by the flow of miniature streams, which
channel the face of the ground and form hollows
for their reception (see Nos. 3 and 4, p. 163).
The
force of the tides and currents upon the sea-shore
illustrates the same
principle and affords us mag-
nificent
lessons
in
composition, not
only
in
the
delicate lines taken by the sculptured sand, but in
the harmonious grouping of masses of shingle and
shells, weeds and drift, arranged by the movement
of the waves.
So that we may see that the principles of har-
monious composition are not the outcome of merely

WE
come now
to the consideration
of
the
various means and methods of expressing
relief in line and form.
We may define a form
in
outline and give
it
different
qualities
of expression by
altering
the
quality and consistency of our outline, and we may
obtain very different kinds of decorative effect by
the use of lines of various degrees of thickness or
thinness
; but if we want to give it force and colour,
and to distinguish
it from its background more em-
phatically, we must add to our outline.
There are three principal methods or systems of
giving relief by adding to our outline.
One
is
the method of giving
relief to form by
contrasts of tone, colour, or tint.
165

THREE METHODS OF EXPRESSING RELIEF
Another by means of the expression of light and
shade
: and the third by means
of modelling
in
relief.
Now, still keeping to expression by means of line,
the three arms
I have sketched (p. 167) illustrate
:
(i) the form
in
outline
alone;
(2)
the
contrast
method
; and (3) the light and shade method. The
three
pots underneath
illustrate the same three
stages in a simpler manner.
In number one we see the outline defining the
form pure and simple
:
in number two the form
is
relieved by a half-tone formed of diagonal
lines,
forming a plane or background behind
it. The arm
is still further relieved by the dark drapery. Num-
ber three shows the relief carried further by lines
expressive of the modelling of the arm and the
rounding of the pot, and also by cast shadows from
the forms.
The system of expressing relief
I have termed
relief by contrast
includes two kinds of contrast
:
there are the contrasts of line and form, and there
are the contrasts of planes of tone or tint and local
colour. We may consider that the contrast method
covers generally all forms
of pattern and certain
kinds of pictorial design. The method of express-
ing
relief by means of
line
covers generally all
forms of design in black and white, graphic sketch-
ing, pen-drawing, and work with the point of all
kinds.
Taking the principle of contrast as applied
to
pattern
design, we
can, even
within
the
limited
range of black and white and half- tint (as expressed
by lines), get a considerable amount of decorative
effect.
In the first place by bringing out our pat-

167

OF THE USE OF CONTRAST AND PLANES
tern, previously outlined, upon a black ground (as
in Nos.
i and
2, p. 169), increasing the richness of
effect, and getting a second plane by treating the
lower part in an open tint of line.
Simple contrasts of dark upon light or light upon
dark are effective, and sufficient for many purposes,
such as borders (as in Nos.
2 and
3, p.
169).
When a
lighter kind
of relief and effect is re-
quired, the recurring forms in a border are often
sufficiently emphasized by a tint of open
lines
:
movement and variety being given by making them
follow the minor curves of the successive forms, as
in
this
instance (No
4, p.
169) the movement of
the water is suggested behind the fish.
The relation
of the
plain ground-work to the
figure of the pattern
is also an important point
;
indeed the plain parts of the pattern, or the inter-
stices and intervals of the pattern, are as essential
to the pattern as the figured parts.
In designs
intended
for various
processes
of
manufacture, such
as
printed
or woven
textiles,
wall-papers, etc., where blocks or rollers are used
to repeat the pattern, the extent of plain
in pro-
portion to figured parts must be governed in some
measure by the practicable size of the repeat
: but
within certain limits great variety of proportion is
possible.
A simple but essentially decorative principle
is
to preserve a certain equality between the figured
masses and the ground masses.
The leaf patterns
(Nos. 6 and
7,
p. 169) consist simply of the repeti-
tion and reversal of a single element. An emphatic
effect is obtained by bringing the leaves out black
upon a white ground (as in No.
6), while a flatter
1 68

RELIEF OF FORM AND
LINE

OF THE USE OF CONTRAST AND PLANES
and softer
effect
is the
result of throwing them
upon a plane of half-tint expressed by horizontal
lines, with a similar effect of relief to
that which
would be given by the warp,
if the pattern were
woven.
For larger surfaces, greater repose and dignity
in pattern may be obtained by a greater proportion
of the repeat being occupied by the ground (as in
No.
5, p.
169).
Indeed we may consider as a general
principle
that the larger the interspaces of the ground, plane,
or field of the pattern, the lighter in tint they should
be, or the necessary flatness
is apt to be lost.
Re-
lief in
pattern design may be said
to be adding
interest and richness without losing the
flatness
and repose of the design as a whole. When pattern
and ground are fairly equally balanced in quantity
the ground may be rich and dark, and darkest as
the interstices, where the ground is shown, become
less. The figure of a pattern relieved as light upon
a dark plane, as a rule, requires to be fuller in form
than dark-figuring upon a light ground.
In decorative work the use of contrast
in the
relief of parts of a design
is often useful and effec-
tive, as, for instance, the dark shading or treatment
in black or flat tone of the alternating under side
of a turn-over leaf-border.
The decorative value of this principle is recog-
nized by heraldic designers in the treatment of the
mantling of the helmet, which
in earlier times
is
treated simplyas a hangingorflying strip of drapery
with a lining of a different colour, by which
it is
relieved as
it hangs
in simple
spiral
folds.
This
ornamental element became developed by the de-
170

DECORATIVE RELIEF
signers of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries into
elaborate scroll designs springing from the circlet
of the helmet and surrounding the shield
: but the
principle of the turned-up
lining remained,
often
variegated and
enriched
with heraldic
patterns
(see illustrations, pp.
172,
I73).
1
The principle, too, of counterchange in heraldry
answers to our principle of relief by contrast, and
though
its chief charm lies in its ornamental range
of form and colour combinations, itcan be expressed
in
black and
white, and
it remains a universal
principle throughout decorative art.
The decor-
ative
effect and charm of the relief of large and
bold forms upon rich and
delicate diapers is also
an important resource of the designer. The monu-
mental art of the Middle Ages affords multitudes
of examples of
this principle in ornamental treat-
ment. The miniaturist of the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries constantly relieved his groups of figures
upon a diapered ground. The architectural sculp-
tor relieved the broad masses of flowing drapery
and the bold projection of his effigies and recum-
bent
figures by delicately chiselled diapers upon
the surface of the wall behind them.
This treat-
1 The increased importance given
to the mantling
in later
times may have been due to the disappearance of the housings
of the knight's horse and his surcoat, which originally displayed
his arms and colours.
The mantling of later times displayed
the heraldic colours of the knight, when, being clad
in
plate
armour, there was no other means of displaying them except
on the shield.
Decoratively, of course, the mantling is of great
value to the heraldic designer, enabling him to form much more
graceful compositions, to combine diverse and rigid elements
with
free and flowing lines and masses, and to
fill panels with
greater richness and effect, whether carved or painted, or both.

USE OF DIAPERED BACKGROUNDS
ment may
frequently
be
seen
in
the
recessed
tombs of the fourteenth century.
The
incisor of memorial brasses, again, more
especially in continental examples, shows a fond-
ness
for the same
principle.
The long vertical
lines
of drapery of
ladies and
ecclesiastics, the
broad masses of the heraldic surcoat, or armour of
the knights, the rich and heavy furred gowns of
the
burghers,
are
often
relieved upon
beautiful
diapered or arabesque grounds, generally embody-
ing some heraldic device, motto, or emblem of the
person or family whose tomb
it ornaments.
Such
decoration
is
strictly
linear,
yet within
its own
limits, and perhaps
because of them, we find in
this province of design extremely admirable work,
no less for delineation of character and decorative
treatment than for ornamental invention controlled
by strict economy of line.
This brings us to the consideration of our second
method of relief by means of line.
Take any simple allied elements
to form a
re-
peating
pattern,
say
spiral
shells,
place them at
certain rhythmic
intervals, and we can unite and
at the same time give them relief by filling in the
ground by a series of waved lines to suggest the
ribbed sand.
Add a few dots to soften and vary
the
effect,
and we
get
a
pattern
of a
certain
balance and consistency (No.
i,
p.
177).
With the more varied and complex floral
form,
but treated
in
a very
abstract way,
placing the
daisies
in a
line, horizontally, and reversing the
sprig
for
the
alternate
row,
we
have another
motive, which
is connected and steadied as well
as relieved by the suggestion of grass
blades

RELIEF OF FORM BY LINEAR SHADING
groups
of three
slightly radiated vertical strokes
(No.
2,
p.
177).
A
pattern
of
two
elements,
again, may be formed in a
still more simple way
by linear
contrast,
as
in No.
3, where the
pyra-
midal trees are formed by a continuous serpentine
stroke
of the pen
terminating
in
a
spiral
stem.
The diagonal arrangement of the trees produces a
chequer, the intervals of which can be varied by
the contrasting black masses of the birds.
In graphic drawing, lines
to
express
forms in
the
relief of light and shade are often needed to
give additional force even where no great degree
of realism is desired.
A tint formed by horizontal
lines
is sufficient to relieve a face from the back-
ground and give
it solidity, while local colour may
be given to the
hair, and at the same time serve
to
relieve the leaves
of a wreath
encircling the
head (see illustration, p.
178).
The
rich
effect
of
clustered
apples growing
among
their
leaves could
hardly be
suggested
without the use of
lines
expressive of light and
shade, the
interstices
of the
deepest shade run-
ning into solid black (p. 178).
In adding lines in
this kind of way to give
relief or extra
richness
or
force, the draughtsman
is
really designing a
system of lines upon
his outline basis, which may
have quite as decorative a quality as
the outline
itself.
At the same time nothing
is more char-
acteristic of the artist than the way in which such
lines are used, and of course the choice of direction
and arrangement of such lines will make
all the
difference in the effect of the drawing.
Where the object
is
to express
the
figure in
broad
masses of light and shade,

their rapid pen
sketches and studies of
figures, and a certain
breadth and
style
is given
to their drawings owing
in
part to the simplicity
of this linear treatment.
No
doubt
the
simpler
the
system
of
line
adopted
in giving
relief to
figures the
better,
if
the particular expression aimed at is accomplished,
and, as a general
rule, we should endeavour
to
get the necessary force and depth without the use
of cross-line, or many different
directions of line
in
shading
a
figure
:
but,
given any power of
draughtsmanship, the individuality of the artist
is
bound to come in, and
it is not
likely, nor is
it to
be desired, that any two artists in line should give
exactly the same account of natural fact, or repro-
duce the images in their minds in the same forms,
any more than we should expect two writers
to
express their ideas in the same terms.
The kind and degree of emphasis upon different
parts,
the selection of moment or
fact, would all
naturally
make
considerable
differences
in
the
treatment.
The
three
sketches
of
the

are
given
as
instances
of
the
different
effects and expression to be obtained in rendering
the same subject (p. i&i).
In A the broad relief of the white dress against
the tones
of the
floor and background, and the
darker note of the hair, are the facts chiefly dwelt
upon.
In B the form of the figure
is brought out

The direction
of line used
in
relieving forms,

much upon individual taste and feeling as well as
knowledge of form.

a study

considerations
will
ultimately determine
the choice and use of line, the degree of relief and

itself are the

Useful things may be learned by the way, such

also shov

A figure or object of any kind, seen in
full light
and shade, is relieved at any of its edges either as
dark against light, or as light against dark, and we
recognize it as a solid form in this way; the bound-
aries of natural
light and shade
defining
it, and
projecting
it from the background upon the vision.
There may be infinite modulations, of course, be-

tween the light part, the half-tones, and the darkest
parts
; but
this broad
principle governs all work
representing light and shade.
RAPHAEL
I STUDIES OF DRAPERY.
It
is, in fact, the principle of the relief of form
represented upon a plane surface.
1 86

RELIEF BY LIGHT AND SHADE ALONE
If the draughtsman's object be to represent the
appearance of a figure or any object in full natural
light and shade with the pen
or other point, he
could do
so without using outline
at
all, but by
simply observing
this
principle and defining the
boundaries of light on dark or
half-tone
in
their
proper masses and
relations.
The pen sketch of
the man with the hoe (p. 188)
is intended to illus-
trate this method.
There
is
also the method of representing form
in relief by means of working with white line only
upon a dark ground, the modelling and planes ol
surface being entirely expressed in this way (as in
A, p.
189).
This may be termed drawing by means
of light, and may be contrasted with the opposite
method
of working by means of black
line only
on a
light ground, or drawing by means of shade
(as in
B, p.
189).
Yet another method, and one in which the effect
of relief can be obtained more readily and rapidly,
perhaps, is by working on a half-toned paper, draw-
ing in the form with pencil, chalk, or brush, block-
ing
in
the darker shadows and heightening the
highest lights with touches of white.
These white
touches, however, should be strictly limited to the
highest
lights.
This method
is
represented by
the half-tone blocks used in this book, those which
were taken from drawings made on brown paper
and -touched with white.
The definition of form by means of light is strictly
the principle of the photograph, whichcomprehends
and illustrates its complementary of relief by means
of shade, and
I
think
it is due to the influence of
the photograph that modern black-and-white artists

THE PRINCIPLE OF THE PHOTOGRAPH
have so
often worked on these
principles.
The
drawings of Frederick Walker and Charles Keene
may be referred to as examples.
I shall, however,
hope to return to this branch of the subject later.
So far we have been considering the
relief of
form by means
of
line.
We now come
to what
may be termed the
relief of form by actual form
and plane, or modelling in actual light and shade,
as in architecture and sculptors' and carvers' work.
Then relief
is gained by the contrast of actually
different planes, forms, surfaces, and textures. The
simplest illustrations of the principles of modelled
relief are
to be found in architectural
mouldings,
by means of which buildings are relieved and en-
riched, and important structural or functional parts
are emphasized, as
in
cornices and ribs of vaults,
arches, and openings.
Place a concave moulding
side by side with a
convex one either horizontally or vertically, and a
certain pleasant effect of contrasting light and shade
is the result, reminding one of the recurring con-
cave and convex of the
rolling waves of the sea
(A, p.
191).
A series of flat planes of different widths and at
different
levels
also produces a pleasant kind of
relief useful in a picture frame
or the jamb of a
door
(B).
All architectural mouldings might be said to be
modifications
or
combinations
of
the
principles
illustrated by these two.
Very
different
feeling may
be
expressed
in
mouldings, and
if we compare the two types, the
classical and the Gothic, the comparatively broad
and simple effect of the former
(c, D,
E,
F, G) con-

MOULDINGS.

RELIEF IN ARCHITECTURAL MOULDINGS
trasts with the richness and variety and the stronger
effect of light and shade, produced by deep under-
cutting, in the latter (H,
i,
j, K).
The Romans, however, produced rich and highly
ornate effects in the use of these types of mouldings,
as they reappeared
in the Corinthian
order, the
ovolo cut into the egg and dart, with the Astralagus
beneath, the Cyma recta above the brackets of the
cornice casting a bold shadow, and both
in
the
cornice and the hollow beneath the dentils enriched
with carving, as seen in the splendid fragment of
the Forum of Nerva.
When we pass to the more complex problems
of figure modelling and sculpture, it is but carrying
on and developing the same principle of the con-
trast of planes, of the relief of plane upon plane,
of forms upon one plane, to forms upon forms
in
many
planes.
From
the
contrast of bead and
hollow we come to consider the contrast between
the rounded limb and the sinuous folds of drapery
;
from the rhythm of the acanthus scroll we turn to
the less obvious but none the less existing rhythm
of the sculptural frieze.
Line, we may say, controls the
modeller's and
sculptor's composition, but form and
its treatment
in light and shade give him his means of ornament.
The delicate contours of faces and limbs contrasted
with the spiral and radiating
folds of drapery, or
rich
clusters
of leaves and
fruits,
the forms
of
animals and the wings of birds
these are his de-
corative resources.
The early stages of sculpture
in
relief may be
seen in the monumental work of ancient Egypt.
Simple incised work appears to have been
the

first
stage,
and
the
forms
- afterwards
slightly
modelled or rounded at the edges into the hollow
of the sunk outline.
Large figures and tables of hieroglyphic inscrip-
tion were thus cut upon vast mural
surfaces, and
carried across the joints
of the masonry, without
disturbing the flatness and repose of the wall sur-
face
(p.
195).
The
Egyptians,
indeed, seem
to
have treated their walls more as if they were books
for record and statement, symbol and hieroglyphic.
Messrs. Perrot and
Chipiez, in their "
History
of Ancient Art in Egypt," speak of three processes
in
the treatment
of Egyptian
reliefs
(vol.
ii.,
p.
284)
:
1. That followed by the Greeks,
in which
the
figures are
left standing out from a smooth bed,
sometimes
slightly
hollowed
near
the contours
(see illustration, p.
196).
2. Where the figures are modelled
in
relief
in
a sunk
hollow,
from an
inch
to one and
a half
inch deep.
3. Where the surface of the figures and the bed
or field of relief are kept on one level (see illustra-
tion,
p.
1 96), the contours indicated by hollow lines
cut into the stone
; very little modelling, little more
than silhouette, in which
the outline
is shown by
a hollow
instead
of by the stroke of a
pencil or
brush.
One would be
inclined
to
reverse
the order of
these three processes, on the supposition that No.
3 was the
earliest
process, and that
it arose, as
I
have conjectured, from the practice of representing
forms by incised lines only.
There is certainly a strong family likeness as to
194

196

GOTHIC SCULPTURE
method between the Egyptian reliefs and the As-
syrian, the
Persian, and the archaic Greek
; and
there is a
far greater difference
in treatment
be-
tween archaic Greek relief sculpture and the work
of the
Phidian
period than between
the archaic
work of the three races named.
The
strictly mural
and
decorative
conditions
which governed ancient sculpture no doubt gave to
Greek sculpture in its perfection a certain dignity,
simplicity, and restraint, and also accounted
in a
great measure for that rhythmic control of invisible
structural and ornamental line which asserts itself
in such works as the Pan-Athenaic frieze.
It was
strictly
slab
sculpture, and became
part
of
the
surface of the wall.
The structural andornamental feeling alsoasserts
itself strongly in Gothic sculpture, owing to its close
association
with architecture, as, when
it was not
an intregal part of the structure,
it was always an
essential part of
the expression of the
building,
and
it was this which controlled
its treatment de-
coratively, in its scale and its system and degree of
relief.
In the porches of the Gallo-Roman churches of
France of the twelfth century, the figures occupy-
ing the place of shafts became columnar in
treat-
ment,
the sinuous
formalized draperies wrapped
around the elongated figures, or falling in vertical
folds,
as
in
the
figures
in
the
western door
of
Chartres Cathedral (p
199).
The lines of the de-
sign of the sculptured tympanum were strictly re-
lated
to the space, and
the degree and treatment
of the relief clearly felt
in regard
to the architec-
tural effect
(p. 201).
'97

ARCHITECTURAL INFLUENCE
In the sculptured tombs of the Middle Ages,
with their recumbent
figures and heraldic enrich-
ments, again, we see this architectonic sense influ-
encing the treatment of form and
relief, as these
monuments were strictly architectural decorations,
often incorporating its forms and details, and often
built into the structure of the church or cathedral
itself, as in the case of the recessed and canopied
tombs of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.
As sculptures became detached from the building
and wall, and appeared in
full relief
in the round,
though
still, as
it were, carrying a reminiscence of
their origin with them in the shape of the moulded
pedestal, architectural control became less and less
felt,
statues
in consequence being
less and
less
related to their surroundings. The individual feel-
ing of the sculptor or the traditions of his school
and
training alone influenced his treatment, until
we get the incidental and dramatic or sentimental
isolated figure or group of modern days.
It
is noteworthy,
however,
that
even
in
the
smaller works of the modeller, carver, or sculptor
of the Middle Ages or the
early Renaissance, a
sense of decorative
fitness and structural sense
is
always present. We see it in the carved ornaments
of seats and furniture, in the design and treatment
of coins and
seals and gems and medals.
These
latter from the time of the ancient Greeks afford
beautiful examples of the decorative treatment of
relief in strict relation
to the object and purpose.
The skill and taste of the Greeks seemed to have
been largely inherited by the artists of the earlier
Italian Renaissance, such as Pisano, whose famous
medal of the Malatesta of Rimini affords a splendid
198

199

MEDALS AND COINS
instance not only of the treatment of the
portrait
and subject on the reverse perfectly adapted to its
method and purpose, but also of the artistic use of
lettering as a decorative feature (see p. 203).
The treatment and
relief of figures and heads
upon the plane surfaces of metals and
coins, the
composition controlled by the circular form, have
always
been
a
fine
test of
both
modelling and
decorative skill and taste.
Breadth
is given by a
flatness in
the treatment of successive planes of
low
relief, which
rise
to
their
highest
projection
from the ground, in the case of a head in profile,
about its centre.
The
delicate perception of the
relation of the planes
of surface
is important, as
well
as
the decorative
effect to be
obtained by
arrangement of the
light and shade masses and
the
contrast
of
textures,
such
as
hair
and
the
folds
of
drapery,
to
the
smooth
contours
of
faces
and
figures, and the
rectangular forms
of
lettering.
In gems we see
the use made of the concave
ground, which
gives
an
effective
relief to the
figure design
in convex upon
it.
Bolder projec-
tion of prominent parts are here necessary in con-
trast to the
retiring planes, the work being on so
small a scale, and also in view of its seal-like char-
acter
;
for, of course,
it
is the method of producing
form
by
incision, and
modelling by
cutting and
hollowing out, that gives the peculiar character to
gems and seals
; and
it
is in forming human figures
that the building up of the form
by a
series
of
ovals, spoken
of
in
a previous
chapter, becomes
really of practical value
:
the method of hollowing
the stone or metal in cutting the gem or making a

die and the character of the tool leading naturally
in that direction.
Perhaps the most delicate and beautiful kind of
sculptured or modelled relief is to be found in the
work
of
the
Florentine
school
of
the
fifteenth
century,
more
especially
that
of
Donatello and
Desiderio di Settignano, who seem indeed to have
caught the
feeling and
spirit
of the best Greek
period, with fresh inspiration and suggestion from
nature and
the
life around them, as
well
as an
added charm of grace and sweetness.
It is difficult to imagine that marble carving
in
low relief can be carried to greater perfection than
it
is
in
the well-known
small
relief by Desiderio
di Settignano of the " Madonna and Child," now
in
the
Italian
Court
of
the
South
Kensington
Museum.
The delicate yet firmly chiselled faces
and hands, the smooth
surfaces of the
flesh, and
the
folds
of drapery, emerging from,
or sinking
into, the varied
planes
of the ground, for refine-
ment of feeling and treatment seem almost akin
to the art of the painter in the tenderness of their
expression.

Of the Expression of Relief in Line-drawing
Graphic Aim
and Ornamental Aim
Superficial Appearance and Constructive
Reality
Accidents and Essentials
Representation and Sug-
gestion of Natural Form in Design
The Outward Vision and
the Inner Vision.
I
HAVE already said that when we add
lines
or tints of shadow, local
colour or surface,
to
an
outline
drawing, we are
seeking
to
express
form in a more complete way than can be done in
outline alone.
These added
lines
or
tints give
what we
call
relief.
That
is
their purpose and
function, whether by that added
relief we wish to
produce an ornamental effector simply to approach
nearer to the full relief of nature, for of course the
degrees of relief are many.
What may be
called
the
natural
principle of
relief
that system of light and shade by which a
figure or any solid object
is perceived as such by
the eye
consists in each part of the form being
thrown into more or less contrast by appearing as
dark on light upon its background, more especially
at its edges.
A figure wholly dark, say in black
drapery, appearing against a light ground, might
be
supposed
to
be
flat
if no
cast shadow was
seen
;
the same with
the reverse
a light figure
upon
a dark ground
except that
in
this
latter
204

RELIEF IN LINE-DRAWING
case, unless
the
light was very
level
and
flat, a
certain
concentration
of
light upon
the
highest
parts,
or
indicating
a
modulation
of shadow
in
interstices, might betray
its solidity (see p. 206).
But
if we place a figure so that the light
falls
from one
side, we perceive that
it at once stands
out
in
bold
relief
in
broad- planes of light and
shade,
further
emphasized
by
cast shadows
(p.
207).
It would be possible to represent or to express
a figure or object so lighted by means of laying in
the modulations and planes of shadow only, or by
means of adding the light only on a toned ground.
In sketching in black and white,
it
is a good plan
to accustom oneself to complete as one goes along,
as
far as may
be, putting in
outline and shadow
together
;
but this needs a power
of direct draw-
ing and a correctness of eye only to be gained by
continual practice.
A slight preliminary basis of
light lines to indicate the position and proportions,
and yet not strong enough
to need rubbing out,
is also a good method
for those who do not feel
certain enough for the absolutely direct method of
drawing.
Now in drawing, as
I think
I have pointed out
before, no less than in all art, there are two main
governing
principles
of working which may
be
distinguished.
/
I. The graphic aim.
II. The ornamental or decorative aim.
The graphic aim
the endeavour to represent a
form exactly as
it appears
a power always valu-
able
to
acquire whatever may be
our
ultimate
purpose,
leaves the draughtsman
great freedom
205

THE TWO PRINCIPLES OF CONTRAST IN BLACK AND WHITE.
2O6

TREATMENT OF THE SAME FIGURE
207
IN LIGHT AND SHADE.

THE GRAPHIC AIM
in
the choice and use
of line, or other means of
obtaining relief, local tint, and tone.
In line- work the broad relief of the flat tones of
shadow may be
expressed
in
lines
approaching"
'
the straight, diagonally sloping from right to left,
or from left to right, as seems most natural to the
action of the hand.
The quality of our
lines
will depend upon the
quality we are seeking to express.
We
shall be
led
to
vary them
in
seeking to
express
other
characteristics, such as textures and surfaces.
In drawing
fur
or
feathers,
for
instance, we
should naturally vary the quality and direction of
line, using broken
lines and
clots for the former,
and flowing smooth fine lines for the
latter, while
extra force and relief would be gained by throwing
them up upon solid
black grounds.
Solid black,
also, to represent local colour, or material such as
velvet,
is often valuable as a contrast in black and
white line-drawing, giving a richness of effect not to
be obtained in any other way (see No.
2,
p. 213).
Its value was appreciated by the early German
and
Italian book-illustrators, and
in our own time
has been used almost
to
excess by some of our
younger
designers, who
have
been
largely
in-
fluenced by Hokusai and other Japanese
artists,
who are always skilful in the use of solid blacks.
In line-drawing a very useful
principle
to ob-
serve, to give solidity to figures and objects,
is to
let one's
lines
say
of drapery
or shadow
run
into solid blacks in the deepest interstices of the
forms,
as when
folds
of drapery
are wrapped
about a figure, or in the deeper folds themselves
(No.
i,
p.
213).

THE ORNAMENTAL AIM
I have spoken
of the
graphic and the orna-
mental
aims
as
distinct,
and
so they may
for
practical purposes be regarded
; although in some
cases
it
is
possible
to
combine a
considerable
amount of graphic
force
with
decorative
effect,
and
even
in
purely
graphic
art
there
should
always be the controlling influence of the sense
of composition which must be felt throughout
all
forms of art.
For the simplest ornamental function, however,
very
little graphic drawing
is
needed, over arid
above
the very essential power of definition by
pure
outline, and
feeling
for
silhouette
; but
a
sense
for the
relief of masses upon
a ground or
field, and of the proportions and relations of lines
and masses or distribution of quantities, is essential.
Now an ornamental
effect may be produced by
the
simple
repetition
of
some form defined
in
outline
arranged
so
as to
fall
into
a rhythmic
series of lines.
A
series of birds upon a plan of this
kind, for
instance, would form a frieze on simple bordering
in abstract line alone, and might be quite sufficient
for some
purposes.
The same
thing would be
capable of more elaborate treatment and different
effect by relieving the birds upon a darker ground,
by defining the details of their forms more, or by
alternating them
in black or white, or by adopt-
ing
the
simple
principle of counterchange
(see
P- 2I 5)-
Flowers
or
figures would be
capable
of the
same simple and abstract treatment; and almost
any form
in
nature, reduced
to
its
simplest
ele-
ments of recurring line and mass, and rhythmic-
210

FEATHERS AND FUR
NOTES FROM NATURE.
21 I

THE ORNAMENTAL AIM
ally
disposed, would give
us
distinct decorative
motives.
It is quite open
to
the designer
to
select
his
lines and forms straight from nature, and, bearing
in mind
the
necessity
for
selection
of the
best
ornamental elements, for a certain simplification,
and the rhythmical treatment before mentioned, it
is good to do
so, as
the work
is more
likely
to
have a certain freshness than
if some of the well-
known historic forms of ornament are used again.
We
may,
however,
learn
much from
the
orna-
mental use of these forms, and use
similar forms
as the boundaries of the shape of our pattern units
and masses.
It is good practice to take a typical shape such
as the Persian radiating flower or pine-apple, and
use
it as the plan for quite a different structure in
detail, taking some familiar English flower as our
motive.
The same with the Indian and Persian
palmette
type.
It
is
also
desirable,
as
before
pointed
out, to draw sprays within formal bound-
aries for ornamental
use.
By such methods we
may not only learn to appreciate the ornamental
value of such forms, but by such
adaptation and
re-combination produce new varieties of ornament
(see p.
2
1 7).
We may perceive how J'stinct are the two aims
as between
simple grapiJc drawing, or
delinea-
tion
and what we
call
design, or conscious
ar-
rangements of line or form.
While planes of relief,
varied form and surface, values of light and shade,
and accidental
characteristics are
rather the ob-
ject with the graphic draughtsman,
typical form
and
structure, and
recurring
line and
mass, are
212

2T 3

SELECTION
sought
for by the
ornamentist.
Both
series
of
facts, or qualities, or characteristics, are in nature.
Judicious
selection,
however,
is
the
test
of
artistic treatment
;
selection,
that
is, with a view
to the aim and scope of the work.
The truth of
superficial appearance or accidental aspect is one
sort of truth
:
the truth of the actual
constructive
characteristics
be they of figure, flower, or land-
scape
is another.
Both belong
to the thing we
see
to
the object we
are drawing
; but we shall
dwell upon one
truth or set of truths rather than
the other, in accordance with our particular artistic
aim, though, whatever this may be, and
in what-
ever direction
it may lead us, we
shall
find
that
selection of some sort will be necessary.
In making
studies, however pure and simple,
the object of which
is to discover facts and to learn
mastery of form, our aim should be to get as much
truth as we
can, truth of structure
as
well as of
aspect.
But these (as far as we can make them)
exhaustive
studies
should
be
accompanied
or
followed by analytical studies made from different
points of view and for different purposes.
Studies, for instance, made with
a view
to ar-
rangements of line only
to get the characteristic
and beautiful
lines of a figure, a momentary atti-
tude, the lines of a flower, or a landscape: studies
with a view, solely, to the understanding of struc-
ture and form, or again, with the object of seizing
the broad relations of light and shade, or tone and
colour
all are
necessary
to a complete
artistic
education of the eye.
If we are drawn as students rather towards the
picturesque and graphic side of art, we shall prob-
214

DECORATIVE TREATMENT OF BIRDS.

ACCIDENTS AND ESSENTIALS
ably look for accidents of line and form more than
what
I should
call
the
essentials, or
typical line
and
form, which
are
the most
valuable
to the
decorative designer.
In
both directions some compact or compro-
mise with nature
is necessary in any really artistic
re-presentation.
The
painter
and
the
sculptor
often
seek
as
complete representation as possible, and what may
be
called
complete
representation
is
within
the
range of
their
resources.
Yet
unless some
in-
dividual choice or
feeling impresses the work of
either kind
it is not a re-presentation, but becomes
an imitation, and therefore inartistic.
The decorative designer and ornamentist seek
to
suggest^ rather than
to^re-present,
though
the
decorator's
suggestion
of
natural
form,
taking
only enough to suit or express the particular orna-
mental
purpose, must
be
considered
also
as
a
re-presentation.
How much, or how little, he will
take of actual nature must depend
largely upon
his resources, his object, and the limitations of his
material
the conditions of his work in short
; but
his range may be
as wide
as from
the
flat
sil-
houetted forms of stencils or simple inlays to the
highly-wrought mural painting.
Design motive, individual conception and senti-
ment, apart from material, must, of course, always
affect
the
question of the
choice and degree of
representation of nature.
The painter will some-
times
feel
that
lie only wants
to suggest
forms,
such as figures or
buildings,
half
veiled
in light
and atmosphere, colours and forms
in
twilight, or
half lost in luminous depths of shadow.

THE OUTWARD VISION AND INNER VISION
The decorative designer will sometimes want to
emphasize forms with the utmost force and realism
at his command, as in some crisp bit of carving or
emphatic pattern, to give point and
relief in
his
scheme of quantities.
There
is
no
hard-and-fast
rule
in
art,
only
general
principles,
constantly varied
in
practice,
from which
all
principles spring, and
into which,
if
vital, they ought to be capable of being again
resolved.
But a design once started upon some
principle
some
particular motive
of line or form
then,
in following this out, it will seem to develop almost
a
life
or
law
of growth
of
its own, which as a
matter of logical necessity will demand a particular
treatment
a
certain natural
consistency or har-
mony
from its main features down to the smallest
detail as a necessity of its existence.
We might further differentiate art as, on the one
hand, the image of the outward vision, and, on the
other, as the outcome or image of the inner vision.
The first kind would include
all
portraiture, by
which
I
mean
faithful
portrayal
or
transcript
whether of animate or inanimate
nature
;
while
the second would include
all imaginative concep-
tions, decorative designs, and pattern inventions.
The outward vision obviously relies upon what
the eye
perceives
in
nature.
Its virtue consists
in the faithfulness and truth of its graphic record,
in
the
penetrating
force
of observation
of
fact,
and
the representative power by which ihey are
reproduced on paper or canvas, clay or marble.
The image of the inner vision
is also a record,
but of a different order of fact.
It may be often

THE OUTWARD VISION AND INNER VISION
of unconscious impressions and memories which
are retained and recur with all or more than the
vividness of actuality
the
tangible forms of ex-
ternal nature calling up answering, but not identical,
images in the mind, like reflections in a mirror
or
in
still
water,
which
are
similar
but never
the
same as the objects they reflect.
But the inner vision is not bound by the appear-
ances of the particular moment.
It
is the record
of the sum
of many moments,
and
retains
the
typical
impress of
multitudinous and
successive
impressions
like the composite photograph, where
faces may be printed one over another until the
result is a more typical image than any individual
one taken separately.
The inner vision sees the results of time rather
ithan
the
impressions
of
the moment.
It
sees
[g#
rather
than
landscape
:
race
rather
than
men
:
spirits
rather than mortals
:
types^ rather
than individuals.
The inner vision hangs the
mind's house with
a mysterious tapestry of figurative thoughts, a rich
and fantastic imagery, a world where the elements
are
personified, where every
tree has
its dryad,
and where the wings
of the winds actually brush
the cheek.
The inner vision re-creates
rather than
repre-
sents, and its virtue consists
in
the vividness and
beauty with which, in
the language of line, form,
and colour, these visions 01 the mind are recorded
and presented to the outward eye.
There
is often
fusion here
again between two
different
tendencies, habits of mind,
or ways of
regarding things.
In all art the mind must work

through
the
eye,
whether
its
force
appears

closeness
of observation
or

The very vividness of realization even of the most
faithful portraiture is a testimony to mental powers.
The
difference
lies
really
in
the focus of the
mental
force
; and,
in any case, the language
of
line and form we use
will neither be
forcible or
convincing, neither faithful to natural fact nor true
to
the
imagination,
without
close and
constant
study of external form and of its structure as well
as its aspect.

WE
have been considering hitherto the choice
and
use
of
line
and
form,
and
various
methods of their representation
in drawing, both
from the point of view of the graphic draughtsman
and that of the ornamental designer.
We now come
to consider
the
subject
solely
from the
latter standpoint
(the
point of view
of
ornamental
design)
; and
it
will be useful
to en-
O
/
deavour
to
trace
the
principles
governing
the
selection of form and use of line as influenced by
some
of the different methods and conditions of
craftsmanship, and as adapted
to various decora-
tive purposes.
The most important branch
of decorative
art
may be said to be mural decoration, allied as
it is
with the fundamental constructive art of
all
ar-
chitecture, from which
it obtains
its determining
conditions and natural limitations.
Its history in the past
is one of splendour and
dignity, and
its record includes some of the finest
224

art ever produced.
The ancient Asiatic nations
were well aware of its value not only as decoration
but as a record.
The palace and temple and tomb-walls of ancient
Egypt,
Persia, and Assyria vividly
illustrate the
life and ideas of those peoples, while they conform
to mural
conditions.
The painted

and churches
of the Middle Ages
fulfil the same
purpose in a different spirit
; but mural decoration
in
its richest, most imaginative and complete form
was developed
in
Italy, from the time
of Giotto,
whose famous works at the Arena Chapel at Padua
and Assisi are well known, to the time of Michael
Angelo, who in the sublime ceiling of the Sistine
Chapel
seemed
to
touch
the extreme
limits
of
mural
work, and
in
fact might be said
to have

almost defied them,
painting mouldings
in
relief
and in perspective
to form the framework of pic-
tures where
figures on
different
scales are used.
In the Sistine Chapel the series of earlier frescoes
on the lower wall by Botticelli, Lorenzo di Credi,
Ghirlandajo,
Pinturicchio, and
other
Florentine
painters
of the
fifteenth century are really more
strictly mural
in
feeling,
and
safer as guides
in
general
treatment,
than
the work
of
the
great
master
himself.
They have much of the repose
and richness as well as the quiet decorative effect
of tapestry.
The
frescoes
in
the
Palazzo Publico
at
Siena,
Pinturicchio's work in the Piccolomini Chapel and
the Appartimenti
Borgia,
the Campo
Santo
at
Pisa and the Riccardi Chapel of Benozzo Gozzoli
at Florence, may be mentioned as among the gems
of mural painting.
We have but little important mural painting in
this country.
Doubtless, from various traces dis-
covered under Puritan whitewash, the walls of our
mediaeval churches were
painted as frequently as
in
continental
countries,
but
so
completely
did
artistic
tradition and
religious sentiment change
after the Reformation that the opportunities have
been few and the encouragement
less
for mural
painting.
An attempt
to
revive
fresco-painting
was
made
in
our
Houses
of
Parliament,
and
various scenes from our national history have been
rendered with varying degrees of merit
; but they
have chiefly demonstrated the need of continuous
practice in such work on the part of our painters
and the absence of a true decorative instinct.

tory, as well as a decoration, while distinctly modern
in sentiment and showing strong dramatic feeling,
as well as historical knowledge.
The chapel on which
Mr.
F.
J. Shields
is en-
gaged
in London will probably be unique
in
its'
way as a complete piece of mural decoration by an
English artist of singular individuality, sincerity,
and power, as well as decorative ability.
But unfortunately opportunities
for
important
mural
decoration
of
this
kind
are very
rare
in
England.
The art
is not popularized
: we have
no
school
of
trained
mural
designers, and we
have no public really interested.
Our commercial
system and system of house tenure are against
it.
Our only chance
is
in public buildings, which
in-
deed have
always been
its
best
field.
Yet we
neglect,
I think, a most important educational in-
fluence.
The painted churches and public
halls
of the Middle Ages
filled in a great measure the
place
of public
libraries.
A
painted
history, a
portrait, a dramatic or romantic
incident
told
in
the
vivid language
of line,
form, and
colour,
is
stamped upon the memory never to be forgotten.
It would be possible,
I think, to impart a tolerably
exact knowledge of the sequence of history, of the
conditions of life at different epochs, of great men
and
their work, from
a
well-imagined
series
of
mural paintings, without the aid of books
; and in
this
direction,
perhaps, our
school
walls
would
present an appropriate field.
Modern opportunities of mural decoration are
chiefly domestic.
The
country mansion, or the
modest home of the suburban citizen, affords the
principal field
in our time for the exercise of the
228

MODERN MURAL WORK.
taste or ingenuity of the wall-decorator.
In
this
comparatively restricted
field, taste
is perhaps of
more
consequence
than
any
other
quality.
A
sense of appropriateness, a harmonizing faculty, a
power of arrangement of simple materials
these
are invaluable, for, more than any others, they go
to the making of a livable interior.
On
first
thought
it would almost seem
as
if
the designer was less technically restricted in this
direction of mural work than any other
; yet he
will soon
feel that he cannot produce an artistic
and thoughtful scheme without taking many things
into consideration which really belong to the con-
ditions or natural limitations of his work.
There
is, firstly, the idea of the wall itself
part
of the
house-structure
a
shelter and
protection
or boundary.
It is no part of a designer's business
to put anything upon the wall in the way of decora-
tion which will induce anyone to forget that
it
is
a wall
nothing to disturb the flatness and repose.
The
four
walls
of a room
inclose a
space
to
dwell
in, in comfort and security.
The windows
show us outward real life and nature.
The walls
should
not compete with
the windows.
Nature
must be translated into the terms of line and form
and colour, and invention and fancy may be pleas-
antly
suggestive
in
the
harmonious
metre
and
rhythm of pattern.
A
wall
surface
extends
horizontally and
ver-
tically, but the vertical extension seems to assert
itself most to the eye.
Any arrangement of lines of the trellis or diaper
order logically covers a wall surface, and may be
appropriately used as a basis
for a wall
pattern,
229

MURAL SPACING AND PATTERN PLANS
whether merely to mark the positions of a simple
spray or formal sprig pattern, or as a ground-plan
for a completely filled field of repeating ornament,
whether painted, stencilled, or in the form of wall-
paper or textile hanging.
In
the
simple
geometric
net
of
squares
or
diamonds
or
circles,
however,
there
is
nothing
that emphatically marks adaptability to a vertical
position.
Such
plans
in themselves
are
equally
appropriate to the floor in the form of paving and
parquet.
The ogee plan, however, and its variant,
the
vertical
serpentine
or
spiral
plan,
at
once
suggest
vertical
extension,
the
former
perhaps
by its leaf-like points arranging themselves scale-
wise, and the latter by
its suggestion of ascending
movement.
It is noteworthy that in the course of the historic
evolution of mural decoration, designs based upon
these
systems
constantly
recur.
They are
part
of the
pattern-designer's vocabulary of
line, and
among
the
principal, though
simplest, terms by
which he
is able to express vertical extension.
The question of scale in designing mural decora-
tion of any sort is very important.
This demands
a certain power of realizing the
effect of certain
lines and masses
if carried out, and the relation of
one
part to another
as well as to the dimensions
of the walls and the room
itself.
Here, as indeed
throughout
art, a
reference
to the human
figure
will give us our key, since after all decoration goes
to form a background for humanity.
With natural
flowers and leaves
it
is always right to design for
mural purposes on the same scale as nature.
Scale
in design
should be
also
considered
in
230

231

SCALE
relation to the general character of a building and
its purpose, the use and lighting of a living room
:
its
dimensions
and
proportions, and
relation
to
other rooms.
There
is great range for individual
taste and fancy.
The
artist would naturally look to the capacity
of the space which he had to decorate, and what
it
suggested to his mind.
He might want to empha-
size a
long, low room by
horizontal
lines, or
to
accentuate a lofty one by verticals.
By the judicious use of line and scale in design,
the designer holds a certain power of transforma-
tion in his hands, not to speak of the transforming
effect of colour of different
keys and
tones, the
apparent contraction or expansion of surfaces by
patterns of different character and scale.
It would obviously not do
to regard any wall
merely as so much expanse of surface available for
sketching unrelated groups and
figures upon, as
they might be jotted down
in a sketch-book, and
to
offer
it
as
decoration.
In
an
interior
thus
treated, we should lose all sense of repose, dignity,
and proportion.
Use and custom, which
fix and determine
so
many things
in
social
life without
written
laws,
have also prescribed certain divisions of the wall,
which, in regard to the exigencies of life and habit
and modern
conditions
generally, seem
natural
enough.
The lower
parts
of the walls of most modern
dwellings
being
generally occupied by
furniture
placed against them, and liable to be soiled or in-
jured,
it would be out of place
to put important
and elaborate ornament or figure designs extend-

THE SKIRTING
ing
to
the
skirting.
The wooden
skirting,
of
about
nine
inches
or a
foot
in
depth, which
is
placed along the foot of the wall
in our modern
rooms, is the armour-plating to protect the plaster,
which otherwise might be chipped and
litter the
floor.
It
is
perhaps
the
last
relic
of the more
substantial
and
extensive wood
panelling
and
wainscotting which, up
to the
latter part
of the
last century, covered the lower walls of the more
comfortable houses, and has been revived
in our
own
day.
The decorator may use
panelling, or
wainscotting,
or
a
simple
chair-rail above
plain
painting,
wall-paper,
dado,
or
stencilling,
or
a
dado of matting, as methods
of covering, and
at
the
same
time
decorating,
the
lower
walls
of
rooms.
The use of the dado of a darker colour and
of
wainscot
is, no
doubt, due
to
considerations
of
wear and
tear, and
so,
like the
origin
of much
ornamental
art, may be
traced to
actual use and
constructive necessity.
When the wood-work of
a room
the doors and window frames
is of the
same colour and character as the dado, a certain
agreeable unity
is preserved, and
it forms a useful
plain framing to set off the patterned parts of the
wall.
This wainscot or dado framing with
the
wood-work should be
as
to colour arranged
to
suit the general scheme adopted.
Where
paint
is used, white for the wood-work usually has
the
best effect.
The
largest
space
of wall
occurs

the
chair-rail,

habits and usage, portable property in the shape

235

FIELD OF THE WALL
along the
eye-line, so that any decoration on this
the main
field of the wall
is regarded as sub-
sidiary to what
is placed upon
it
;
but, of course,
pictures can be used as
the
central
points
of a
decorative scheme.
On the upper part of a wall,
below the
plaster cornice, the mural designer has
the chance of putting a frieze, and a frieze usually
gives
the
effect of additional height
to a room,
besides enriching the wall.
An effective treatment of a large room, and one
which
is more reposeful than cutting up the wall
into these portions, as in dado, field, and frieze,
is
to carry up wood
panelling
to the
frieze, and
let
this (the frieze) be the important decorative feature.
Supposing the room was twelve
feet high, one
could afford to have
eight feet of panelling, and
then a frieze of four feet deep.
In this case one
would
look
for an
interesting
painted
frieze
of
figures
some legend
or
story
to run along the
lour sides of the room, and in such a case
it might
be marked with considerable pictorial freedom.
More formal figure design or ornamental work
in coloured plaster-work, stucco, and gesso could
also be appropriately used
in such
a
position, as
also on the ceiling.
Now as regards choice of line and form in their
relation
to
the decoration of such mural spaces.
Taking
the
lower
wall, dado,
or
panelling, one
reason why panelling has so agreeable an effect is,
I
think,
that the series of vertical and horizontal
lines seem to express the
proportions, while they
emphasize the flatness and repose of the wall, and
when used beneath a painted
frieze they lead the
eye upwards, forming a
quiet framing of rectan-
'
236

TAPESTRY
gular lines below to the ornate and varied design
of the frieze.
Where we are limited to decorating
a wall by means of plain painting, stencils, or wall-
paper, this idea of reposeful constructive lines and
forms on the lower wall should still dominate upon
the field.
Subject to our repeating plan we may
be freer both
in
line and form, using free scrolls,
branch-work, fruit, and flower masses at pleasure,
because the space
is more extended, and we shall
feel the necessity in a repeating pattern of spread-
ing adequately over it
; but such designs, however
fine in detail, should be constructed upon a more
or less geometric base or plan. We are, as regards
the main field of the wall, still unavoidably, though
not disadvantageously, influenced by the tradition
of the textile hanging or arras tapestry, no doubt;
and certainly there is no more rich and comfortable
lining
for
living rooms than tapestry, or, at the
same time, more reposeful and decoratively satisfy-
ing.
But, of course, where we can afford arras
tapestry
(such
as
the
superb work
of William
Morris and
his weavers), we ought not to allow
anything to compete with
it upon the same wall.
It
is sufficient in
itself.
Of what splendour of colour and wealth of de-
corative and symbolical
invention
tapestry was
capable in
the
past may be
seen
in magnificent
Burgundian
specimens
of the
fifteenth
century,
now in the South Kensington Museum.
Tapestry hangings
of a
repeating pattern and
quiet colour could be used appropriately beneath
painted upper walls, or a frieze, as no doubt
fre-
quently
was the custom
in great houses
in the
Middle Ages.
237

APPARTIMENTI BORGIA
In the Appartimenti Borgia in the Vatican, for
instance, which consists of lofty vaulted rooms with
frescoes by Pinturicchio upon the upper walls be-
tween
the spans of the vaulting,
and upon
the
vaulting itself, we may see, about eleven feet from
the floor, along the moulding, the hooks left for the
tapestry hangings, which completed the decoration
of
the. room.
The lower walls are now
largely
occupied by book-shelves
;
but books themselves
may form a pleasant background, as one may often
observe in libraries, especially when the bindings
are rich and good in tone
: and
here, too, we get
our verticals and horizontals again.
So long as. the feeling for the repose and flatness
of the wall surface is preserved, there are no special
limitations in the choice of form.
It becomes far
more a matter of treatment ofform and subject in
perfectly appropriate mural design.
There is one
principle, however, which seems to hold good in
the treatment of important figure subjects to occupy
the main wall
surfaces as panels
:
while
pictorial
realization of a kind may be carried quite far,
it is
desirable to avoid large masses of light sky, or to
attempt much in the way of atmospheric effect.
It
is
well
to keep
the horizon
high,
and,
if sky
is
shown, to break
it with architecture and trees.
Still
more
important
is
it
to observe
this
in
tapestry.
It
is
very noticeable how tapestry de-
sign
declined
after the
fifteenth century or early
years of the sixteenth, when perspective and pic-
torial planes were
introduced, and sky effects
to
emulate
painting,
and thus the peculiarly mural
feeling was lost, with
its peculiar beauty, richness,
and repose.

THE FRIEZE
In
the
translation
into
tapestry
even
of
so
tapestry-like a picture as that of Botticelli's ." Pri-
mavera,"
it is noteworthy how Mr. Morris has felt
the necessity of reducing the different planes, and
the chiaroscuro of the painting, by more leafy and
floral detail
; making
it, in short, more of a pattern
than a picture.
A. frieze
is susceptible of a much more open,
lighter, and freer treatment than a field.
A frieze
is one of the mural decorator's principal means of
giving lightness and relief to his wall.
In purely
floral and ornamental design
the
field
of
close
pattern, formal
diaper, or sprigs
at regular inter-
vals may be appropriately relieved by bolder lines
and
masses, and
a more open
treatment
in
the
frieze.
The frieze, too, affords a means of contrast
in line to the line system of the field
of the wall,
its
horizontal
expression
usefully
opposing
the
verticals or diagonals of the wall
pattern below.
The frieze may be regarded as a horizontal border,
and in border designs the principle of transposition
of the relation of pattern to ground
is a useful one
to bear in mind, as leading always to an effective
result.
I mean, supposing our field shows a pattern
mainly of light upon dark, the frieze might be on
the reverse plan, a dark pattern on a light ground.
And whereas, as
I have said, one would exclude
wide light spaces from our mural field, in the frieze
one might
effectively show
a
light sky ground
throughout, and arrange a figure or
floral design
upon that.
The principle governing the treatment of main
and lower wall spaces or fields, which teaches the
designer to preserve the repose of the surface, may
240

TEXTILE DESIGN
be said to rule also in all textile design, and textile
design has, as we have seen in the form of tapes-

try, and hangings of all kinds, a very close associ-
ation with mural decoration.
Any
textile may be considered, from
the de-
signer's point of view, as presenting so much sur-
241
R

TEXTILE DESIGN
face for pattern, whether that surface is hung upon
a wall, or curtains a door or a window, or is spread
in the form of carpets or rugs upon floors, or over
the cushions of furniture, or
adapts
itself to the
variety
of curve
surface and movement
of
the
human form in dress materials and costume. Tex-
tile beauty
is beauty of material and surface, and
unless the pattern or design upon it or woven with
it enhances that beauty of material and surface,
and
becomes
a
part
of the
expression
of that
material and surface,
it is better without pattern.
To place
informal
shaded
flowers and leaves
upon a carpet,
for
instance,
where
the warp
is
very emphatic, and the process of weaving neces-
sitates a stepped
or rectangularly broken outline,
is to mistake appropriate decorative effect, capacity
of material, and position in regard to the eye. We
cannot get away, in a carpet, from the idea of aflat
field starred with more or less formal flowers, and
colour arrangements which owe their richness and
beauty, not
to the
relief of shading, but
to
the
heraldic principle of relieving one
tint or colour
upon another.
The rich inlay of colour which a
Persian or any Eastern carpet presents
is owing
to its being designed upon
this principle
; and in
Persian work that peculiarly rich effect of colour,
apart from fine material,
is owing to the principle
of the use of outlines of different colours defining
and
relieving the different forms
in
the
pattern
upon different grounds. The rectangular influence
arising from the technical conditions of the work
o
gives a
definite
textile
character
to
the
design
which
is very agreeable
;
besides, as a question of
line and form, in a carpet
or rug which

EFFECT OF TEXTURE ON COLOUR
:
angular in shape and laid usually upon rectangular
floors, the squareness of form harmonizes with the
conditions and surroundings of the work in use.
The Persian
designer,
indeed, appears
to be so
impressed with this feeling, that he uses a succes-
sion of borders around the central field of his car-
pet or rug,
still further emphasizing the rectangu-
larity
;
while he avoids
the too rigid effect of a
series of straight lines which the crossing of the
threads of the weft
at
right angles
to the warp
might cause, by changing the widths of his subsi-
diary borders and breaking them with a constant
variety
of
small
patterns, and
inserting narrow
white lines between the black lines of the border.
In
tapestry
the
effect of the emphatic warp
worked
vertically
in the
loom,
but hung
hori-
zontally, has a very important
influence upon the
effect.
If we took a piece of paper coloured with
a flat even tint, and folded
it in ridges, the quality
of the
tint would be at once changed, and so
in
tapestry
the
passing
of the
wool
of the
wefts,
which form the pattern or picture, over the strong
lines of the warp

are broad enough

take the outlines of the cartoon upon them
pro-
duces that soft and varied play of colour
really
colour in light and shade
which, over and above
the actual dyes and artistic selection of tints, gives
the peculiar charm and effect in tapestry.
This sheen and variety are more or less evident
in
all
textiles, and
a good
textile
pattern
only
adds
to the
variety and richness
of the surface.

In cut velvet the same principle of contrast of
surface
is emphasized
still further, the rich deep

with the mat effect of the ground.

can be produced by line, dot, and tints of colour,

in loss of taste and deterioration
of quality, espe-
cially in design.
From
the artistic point of view
we
can
only
correct
this
by
bearing
in mind
similar considerations to
those which
hold good
as general principles and guides
in
designing for
textiles generally,
having regard
to
the
object,
purpose, and position
to the ultimate use of the
material, and differentiating our designs, as in the
case of other textile design accordingly.
Thus in the matter of plan and direction of line
and
character
of
form
we
shall
at
once
find
natural
distinctions and
divisions, as our design
is for hanging, or spreading horizontally, or wear-
ing
; and
these different functions will also deter-
mine scale and choice and treatment of form and
colour.
There
is no doubt that with patterns printed
more range may be allowed than with patterns to
be woven, where line and form are both controlled
by the necessities of being reproduced by so many
points to the inch.
At the same time
the object
of all design and pattern work being the greatest
beauty compatible with the
material and
condi-
tions, one should seek, not such effects
as merely
test the capacity or ingenuity of the machine, but
rather such
as appear
to
be most
decoratively
appropriate and effective.
There appears to be no mechanical reason why
cotton should not be printed
all over with land-
scapes and graphic
sketches, and
people clothe
themselves with them as with Christmas numbers,
or
turn
their
couches,
chairs, and
curtains
into
scrap albums, but
there
is
every reason on the
score of taste why these things should not be done.

PRINTS
With any
textile,
as
I have
said, we are
as
designers
dealing
with
surface.
It
is
surface
ornament
that
is wanted
also in
printed
cotton.
Now good line and form and pure tints have the
best effect, because they do not break the surface
into holes, and give a ragged or tumbled appear-
ance, which
accidental bunches of darkly-shaded
flowers
in high
relief undoubtedly do.
If small
rich detail and variety are wanted, we should seek
it in the inventive spirit of the Persian and Indian,
and
break
our
solid
colours with
mordants
or
arabesques in colour of delicate subsidiary pattern
instead of using coarse planes of light and shadow,
or showing up ragged and
unrelated forms upon
violent grounds.
The true idea of a print pattern is of something
gay and fanciful
:
bright and fresh
in colour, and
clear
in
line and
form
: a
certain
quaintness
is
allowable, and
in
purely
floral
designs
there
is
room for a considerable degree of what might be
called naturalism, so far as good line-drawing and
understanding of flower form goes, emphasis
of
colour being sought by means of planes of colour,
rather than by planes of shadow.
I had intended
to touch upon other provinces
of design,
but
I have taken
up
so much
space
with those
I have been discussing already that
I
can only now briefly allude to these.
Of wall-paper, which may be
regarded
in
the
light
of more or
less of
a
substitute for mural
painting, and also textile wall-hangings, much the
same general
principles and many
of the same
remarks
apply
as
have
been
already
used
in
regard
to
mural decoration.
The designer has
250

251

WALL-PAPER
much freedom
as to motive, and his ingenuity is
only bounded by or concentrated
in a square of
twenty-one inches.
If he has succeeded in making
an
agreeable
pattern which
will
repeat not too
obviously over an
indefinite space, to form a not
obtrusive background, and which can be printed
and sold to the ordinary citizen, he is supposed to
have satisfied the conditions.
But
he may be
induced
to
go
further
and
attempt
the design of a complete decoration as
far as dado, field, frieze, and
ceiling go
; and this
would involve
all
the thought
necessary
to
the
mural painter, narrowed down to the exigencies of
mechanical repeat.
Allied to the wall is the window, and in glazing
and the art of the glass-painter we have another
very distinct and beautiful sphere of line design.
In plain leading the same law of covering vertical
surface holds good
as
to
selection
of plan
and
system of line
: almost any simple
geometric net
is appropriate, if not too complex or small in form
to hold glass or to permit lead to follow
its
lines.
Leaded panels of roundels (or
" bull's eyes ") of
plain glass have a good effect in casements where
a
sparkle
of
light rather than outward
view
is
sought for.
When we come
to designing for stained glass
we should
still bear
in mind
the fundamental net
of lead lines which forms the basis of our pattern,
or
glass
picture, as
it were
: and
the designer's
object should be to make
it good as an arrange-
ment of line independently of the
colour,
while
practical to the glazier.
Although lead
is very
pliable, too much must

not be expected of it in the way of small depres-
sions and angles
: the boundary lines of the figures,
which should be the boldest of all, should be kept
as simple as possible, not only on
this account,
but because complex outlines cannot well be cut
in
glass.
A
head,
for
instance,
is
inclosed
in
sweeping
line, and the
profile defined within the
lead line by means of painting.
A hand would be
defined
on the same
principle,
Each
different
colour demands
a
different
inclosure
of
lead,
although in the choice of glass much variation
of
tint can be obtained, as in the case of pot metal
running from thin to thick glass, which intensifies
the
colour,
and many
kinds
of what
is
called
flashed.
Yet
to the designer, from the point of
view of line, glass design
is a kind of translucent
mosaic, in which the primal technical necessity of
the leading which holds the glory of the coloured
light together, really enhances
its splendour, and
in affording opportunities for decoration and ex-
pressive linear composition imparts to the whole
work its particular character and beauty.
This after
all
is the principle to cling to in
all
designing, to adapt our designs
to the particular
distinctive character and beauty of the material
for which they are destined, to endeavour to think
them
out
in
those
materials,
and
not
only on
paper.
Whatever
the work may
be
carving,
inlays,
modelling,
mosaic,
textiles
through
the
whole
range
of
surface
decoration,
we
should
think out our designs, not only in relation to the
limitations of their material, but also
in their re-
lation to each
other, to
their effect
in
actual use,
and even to their possible use
in association to-
254

STAINED GLASS
gether, which, of course,
is of paramount import-
ance in designing a complete room or any com-
prehensive piece of decoration.
And when we leave plane surfaces and seek to
invent appropriate, that is to say, expressive orna-
ment allied to concave and convex surfaces, to the
varied forms of pottery for instance, metal-work,
and glass vessels, furniture, and accessories of all
kinds, we shall find the same laws and
principles
hold good which should guide us in all design
to
adapt design to the characteristics and conditions
of the
material, to
its
structural capacity, its use
and purpose, as well as to use or invention in line,
both as a controlling plan or base of ornament, as
well as a means of the association and expression
of form.

PERHAPS
the most
striking means of the
expression of relief of line and form, certainly
the most
attractive,
is by
colour.
By colour we
obtain the most complete and
beautiful means
of
expression in art
Our earliest ideas of form are probably derived
through the different colours of objects around us,
by which
they
are- thrown
into
relief upon
the
background, or against other objects
;
and,
as
I
mentioned in the first chapter, we reach outline by
observing the edges of different masses relieved
as dark
or
light upon
light or dark grounds, so
now, in my last, we come again
to the considera-
tion of the definition of line and form by colour,
and
their
relief and
expression
upon
different
planes or fields of colour.
There is first the colour of the object itself
the
local colour
and then the colour of the ground
256

SKETCH TO SHOW EFFECT OF THE SAME COLOUR AND FORM
UPON DIFFERENT COLOURED GROUNDS.
257

RELIEF OF LINE AND FORM BY COLOUR
upon which
it
is relieved, both of which
in
their
action and reaction upon each other will greatly
affect the value of the local colour and the degree
of relief of the form upon
it.
One of the best and simplest ways to ascertain
the real value of a colour and its effect upon differ
ent grounds or
fields
is
to take a flower
say a
red
poppy, and
place
it
against a white
paper
ground, blocking
in the
local colour as
relieved
upon white, as near as may be to its full strength,
with
a brush, and
defining the form
as we go
along.
Then try the same flower upon grounds
of different tints
green, blue, yellow
and
it
will
be
at once perceived what a different value and
expression the same form
in the same
colour has
upon
different
tinted grounds.
A
scarlet poppy
would appear clearest and darkest upon white
;
it
would show
a tendency upon a blue ground
to
blend or blur at its edges, and also on yellow and
green to a less extent.
It
is
this tendency to lose the edges of forms
owing
to the radiation
of colours, and to mingle
with the colour of the background, which makes a
strong outline so constantly a necessity in decora-
tive work.
One may use a black on a
white, a
brown,
or a gold
outline
(as
in
cloisonne),
the
nature of the
outline being generally determined
by the nature of the work.
In stained glass the
outline must be
black, and
this black
is
of the
greatest
value
in
enhancing
by
opposition
the
brilliance
of the colours of the glass
it
incloses,
stopping out the light around
it as it does in solid
lead when placed in the window.

CLEARING COLOURED FORMS
ant
in
a printed
textile, where
the
colours used
are full and rich, often has a good effect, lightening
the effect while giving point and definition to cer-
tain leading forms.
Instances of the use of white
outlines may be found in Eastern carpets, where
the main colours, being dark blue and yellows on
rich red, are relieved in parts by a dull white out-
line.
Also in Persian carpets of the sixteenth or
seventeenth century, the scrollwork in red is often
relieved by an ivory white outline on blue.
It
is
always
a good
practice
in
blocking
in
flowers, either from nature or as parts of a design,
to leave a white
outline at the junctions
that
is
to say, where one petal overlaps another, or where
there
is a joint in the stem, or a fold in the leaf
and to show the ribbings, markings, and divisions
of flower and leaf.
By judiciously changing the quality of our tints
it is possible to make different colours in a pattern
tell
clearly.
To
relieve red upon
blue,
for
in-
stance, one would use an orange red upon green-
ish blue, or scarlet upon a gray blue
the general
principle being apparently a kind of compensating
balance between
colours, so
that
in
taking from
one you give to another.
A full red and blue used together, as we have
seen,
would show a
tendency
to
purple,
unless
separated by
outlines
;
so
that
if
the
blue was
full and
rich,
the
red would have
to
approach
brown or russet
;
or
if the red was
a
full one
a
crimson red
the
blue would have
to approach
green.
This may be because of the necessary comple-
ments
in
colours,
which we
see
in nature,
and
260

HARMONY
which
prepossess the
eye, and make
it demand
these modifications to satisfy the sense of harmony.
When daylight struggles with candle- or lamp-
light, one may notice that upon the white cloth of
a dinner-table the
light
is blue and
the shadows
yellow or orange
the orange deepening as with
the fading daylight the
blue grows deeper, until
the colour of the
light and
the shadow change
places.
The same
principle may be noticed
in
firelight, but the redder the flame the greener will
be the shadows.
Harmony
in
colour may be
said
to consist-
apart from
the general
acknowledgment of
the
law of complementaries,
in giving quality
to the
raw pigments by gradation, by a certain admixture
or infusion of other colours.
To begin with the negatives
white and black
white may be creamy or silvery
; black may be
of a greenish or a bluish or brownish tone
; then
the
primaries
red,
blue,
yellow,
or
red, green,
violet
red may range
from crimson
to orange
and russet
; yellow may approach green or gold
;
green may be
first cousin
to blue
; blue may be
turquoise on the one hand, and touch purple upon
the other
; and so on through infinite variations of
half tints and tones.
No doubt
it
is an
easier matter
to harmonize
half
tints
than
full
bright
colours,
which
may
account for the prevalence of the former in deco-
rative work.
Nature's
pattern-book,
too,
is
full
of half tones and mixed tints.
We may not all see colour precisely in the same
way, and the same colour may appear
to be of a
different tint to different eyes
; and
it seems cer-
261

THE COLOUR SENSE
tain that climate and surroundings affect the colour
sense
:
light and colour will stimulate the delight
in
colour
;
while, where
grayness
and
dullness
characterize the surroundings
of
life, the
colour
sense will grow weak, or,
if it is manifested
at all,
it will show a tendency to grayness and heaviness
of tint.
The
art of the different peoples of the world
illustrates
this,
and,
as we may see by turning
from east to west, or from north to south, or even
from winter to summer, in
the main the love
ot
colour follows the sun, like the rainbow.
We can all do something to cultivate our sense
of colour,
however,
and
there
is no
better way
than
studying
the
harmonies
and
varieties
of
nature.
Even the town-dweller is not altogether
deprived of the sight of the sky, which constantly
unfolds the most beautiful compositions both of
form and colour.
As to the choice of colours in decorative design,
so
far
as that
is not narrowed by the particular
conditions
of the
work, we must be guided by
much the same considerations as would serve us
in designing generally, and must, of course, think
of appropriateness to position and purpose.
Much
depends,
too, upon proportions of colour, and a
beautiful and harmonious
effect may be produced
in a room by keeping the colour
in a particular
key,
or even
delicately varying the designs and
tints of one or two colours.
The same might be
said
in arranging a scheme
of colouring
for any
particular piece
of design
say, a painted
panel
or a textile pattern
; although such things must
ultimately be governed by their relation
to other
262

IMPORTANCE OF PURE TINTS
parts
in any
general scheme
circumstances ne-
cessitate their being often designed apart.
Still,
if the colour of a pattern has been carefully thought
out, or rather harmoniously
felt, as a real organic
thing,
it is sure to
fit into its place when
its time
comes.
In arranging our design of colour we can have
no
better guide,
as
to
proportions and
quality,
than
nature, and should do
well, as a matter of
practice,
to
take a
flower,
or the plumage
of a
bird,
or
the
co
1 ours
of a
landscape,
and adapt
them
to some
particular
pattern
or
scheme
of
decoration, following the
relative degrees of tint
and their quantities as nearly as possible.
To do
this
successfully
requires
some
invention
and
taste
; but successful, or
unsuccessful, one could
hardly fail
to learn something positive and valu-
able
about
colour,
if the attempt was conscien-
tiously made
;
and fresher motives and sweeter
colour would
be more
likely to
result from such
study.
I
think
it
is a very important thing
in
all de-
corative work to keep one's colours pure in quality,
and to avoid muddy or heavy tints.
Brown
is an
especially
difficult
colour
to
use,
because
of its
generally heavy effect as a pigment, and the
dif-
ficulty of harmonizing it with other colours except
as an outline
; and even here
it makes all the dif-
ference whether
it
is
a cool
or a hot
shade.
A
hot brown
is
most
destructive
of harmony
in
colours.
It
is
safe, as a rule, to make
it lean
to
green, or bronze, or gold.
As a general
rule
it
is well to work either in a
range of cool
tints
a cool key of colour, or the
263

IMPORTANCE OF PURE TINTS
reverse
a warm and
rich
one.
Few cool
har-
monies can be better than ultramarine and tur-
quoise on greenish white, of which the Persians
and Indians are
so fond
in
tile-work.
They are
delightful
to the
eye, while peculiarly adapted to
the
work,
owing
their
quality
to
the oxide
of
copper, which the firing brings out so well.
Blues and greens and grays, relieved with white
and yellow and orange
:
or, reds and yellows, re-
lieved with white and opposed by blacks, generally
answer
:
or a range of reds together, or range of
blues, or of yellows, with black and white for con-
trast and
accent.
Blue and
white,
too,
can
be
modified
in
quality
; black may
be greenish
in
tone, or brownish, bluish, or purplish according to
the harmony aimed
at.
White may be pure or
ivory-toned, cream-coloured or influenced by other
colours, and should vary in degree according to the
strength of the harmony.
This brings us to the
question of tone.
Now the ornamentist, the designer ot
patterns,
relies for his effect upon the use of certain planes
and oppositions of tints to relieve and express his
design, to emphasize its main motive, to bring out
or to subdue its lines and forms.
He knows that
cool
flat
tints
blues,
greens, grays
will make
forms and
surfaces
retire, and he makes use
of
them
for
flat and
reposeful
effects, such as
wall
and ceiling surfaces, adopting the natural principle
of colour in landscape and sky.
He uses richer and more varied colour in textile
hangings and carpets, furniture, and accessories-
reds,
yellows,
greens,
crimson,
russets,
orange,
gold
which answer
to the brighter flowers and
264

TONES AND PLANES
parterres of our gardens, as things to be near the
eye and touch, and to occur as lesser quantities in
a scheme of interior colour design.
In
the
colour design
of patterns, harmonious
and
rich
effects can be produced by the use of
pure
colour
alone, no doubt,
if carefully propor-
tioned, and separated by outline
; though harmony
is. more difficult to attain
in pure colours used in
their full strength
; and for their due effect, and to
avoid harshness, such a treatment
really requires
out-door light or special conditions of lighting, or
the strong light of eastern or southern countries,
to soften the effect.
And
since we
have
to adapt our designs
to
their probable surroundings, we usually consciously
select certain tones or shades of a colour, rather
than use
it absolutely pure or in
its
full strength.
The beautiful tone which time gives to all colour-
work is difficult to rival, but no conscious imitation
of it is tolerable.
But
so long as our aim
is
strictly to make a
colour scheme
of any kind in relation to itself, or
in harmony with
its conditions, we are on a
safe
and sound path.
It is this relativity which
is the
important thing
in
all decorative
art, and which,
more distinctly than any other quality, distinguishes
it
from
pictorial
art
;
although
pictorial
art
is
under
the
necessity
of the same law
in
regard
to
itself; and
in
its
highest
forms, as
in
mural
work, is certainly subject to relativity in its widest
sense.
At first sight it might appear as
if there were
an
essential
fundamental
natural
difference
be-
tween a pattern and a picture, but when we come
265

PATTERN AND PICTURE
to consider
it,
it appears to be rather a distinction
than a difference.
A
pattern may be
an
arrangement
of
lines,
forms, and
a harmony
of
planes
and
tones
of
colour.
But
these
words
would
describe
in
general
terms a picture also.
Certain
recurrences
of
line and form
;
certain
re-echoing notes of the same, or allied colour, are
necessary to both pattern and picture.
The ab-
stract ingredients appear
to be the same in both
cases.
A picture indeed may be considered as a pattern
of another
sort, and
the
real
difference
is
that
whereas a pattern
is not necessarily a
picture, a
picture is bound to be a pattern
a pattern having
its quantities, its balance of masses,
its connecting
lines,
its various planes,
its key of colour,
its play
of contrasts,
its harmony of tones.
Technically, a picture may be considered as an
informal pattern, mainly of tone and values
; while
a pattern may be considered as a formal pattern,
mainly of planes of colour.
The
ancient
art of the
East was
all

- work,
whatever

subject
pictured
Egyptian, Persian, Indian, Chinese, Moorish and
Arabian art, in all their varieties, show the domin-
ating sense of pattern, and the invention of the
instinctive decorators in the use of colour.
The Japanese, also,- are
instinctive
decorators,
though in a less formal and more impressionistic
way, and
with much
more
naturalistic
feeling.
Their pictures printed from colour blocks, as well
as their " kakimonos," painted on silk, are frankly
266

CHIAROSCURO
pattern-pictures,
the
pattern motive being
quite
as strong or stronger than the graphic or repre-
sentative motive.
Mediaeval and
early
Renaissance
painting
in
Europe was frankly more or less
formal and of
the nature of ornament, and even in its freest and
fullest development,
in
the works
of the
great
masters of the sixteenth
century of Venice and
Florence,
a
certain
decorative
or
architectural
feeling was never forgotten.
Painting was
still in close association with archi-
tecture, and was the chief adornment of churches
and palaces
; thus
it preserved a peculiar distinc-
tion and dignity of style.
The Dutch school did
more perhaps
to break these old decorative and
architectural traditions than any other, with their
domestic
and
purely
naturalistic
motives,
their
pursuit of realism, atmospheric
effect, and chiar-
oscuro
that fascinating goal of painting.
Yet there were some of the seventeenth-century
masters, and of the best, such as De Hooghe and
Ver Meer of
Delft, who showed themselves very
much alive to decorative effect, which their power
of chiaroscuro
the power of painting
things
in
their
proper atmosphere,
as
lost
in transparent
depths of shadow, or found in luminous mystery-
only seemed to enhance.
As

of ornamental
and

yet

VER MEER OF DELFT
Take Ver
Meer's
" Lady at a Spinet
" in our
National Gallery.
We have a plain white wall, exquisite
in
tone,
upon which the crisp gold of the small picture in-
closing a
brownish
landscape with
a
blue
and
white sky, and the broad black frame of the picture
of Cupid
tell
strongly, yet
fall
into plane behind
the figure in white satin
quite a different quality
of white, and warmer and brighter than the wall.
The bodice
is a steely blue silk, which is repeated
in the velvet seat of the chair
;
while the blue and
white landscape upon the open
ltd of the spinet
repeats the blue and white landscape on the wall,
and the blue and white motive is subtly re-echoed
in a subdued key in the
little tiles lining the base
of the wall.
The floor
is a chequer of black and
white (mottled) marble, which gives a
fine
relief
to the dress and repeats the emphatic black of the
picture frame
; the stand of the spinet
is also black
striated marble.
Quiet daylight falls through the
greenish white of the leaded panes.
The pink-
brown woodwork of the spinet and chair prevent
the colour scheme from being cold.
The flesh
is
very pale and ivory-like
in
tone, but the dress
is
enlivened by
little crisp scarlet and gold touches
in the narrow laces which tie the sleeves.
The little picture is a gem of painting and truth
of tone, and at the same time might well suggest
a charming scheme of colour to an ornamentist.
Examine the Van Eyck
in the same way, and
we shall find a very rich but quiet scheme of colour
in a lower key, highly
decorative, yet presented
with extraordinary realistic
force, united with ex-
treme refinement and exquisite
chiaroscuro, and
270

VAN EYCK
truth of tone and value, as a portrait-picture, and
piece of interior lighting.
It
is
like taking an actual peep into the inner
life of a Flemish burgher of the fifteenth century.
One seems to breathe the still air of the quiet
room, the gray daylight falling through the leaded
casements, one
of which
stands open, and shows
a narrow strip of luminous sky and suggestion of
a garden with scarlet blossoms in green leaves.
The man
is
clad
in a long mantle of
claret-
brown velvet edged with fur, over black tunic and
hose.
He wears
a quaint
black
hat
upon
his
head, which almost foreshadows the tall hat of the
modern citizen.
The pale strange face looks paler
and stranger beneath
it, but
is
in character with
the long
thin
hands.
The
figure gives one the
impression
of legal
precision and
dryness, and a
touch of clerical formality. The wife is of a buxom
and characteristic Flemish
type, in a grass-green
robe edged with white
fur, over peacock blue
; a
crisp silvery white head-dress
; a dark red leather
belt with silver
stitching.
Her figure
is relieved
upon the subdued red of the bed hangings, con-
tinued in the cover of the settle and the red clogs.
The wall
of the
room, much
lost
in transparent
shade, is of a greenish gray tone, and in the centre,
between
the
figures,
a
circular
convex
mirror
sparkles on
the wall
reflecting the backs
of the
figures.
Thin
lines
delicately repeat
the red
in
the mirror frame, which has a black and red inner
moulding.
A string of amber beads hangs on the
wall, and repeats the shimmer of the bright brass
candelabra which hangs aloft, and which
is drawn
carefully enough for a craftsman to reproduce.

PATTERN-PICTURES
Both designer and painter may find abundant
suggestion in this picture, which, with Ver Meer's
" Lady at the Spinet,"
I should describe zspat'ern-
pictures
that
is to say, while they are thoroughly
painter's pictures, and give all the peculiar qualities
of oil-painting in the rendering oi tone and values,
they yet show in their colour scheme the decorative
quality, and might be translated into patterns of the
same proportions and keys of colours.
As examples of what might be termed
picture-
patterns we might recur to the wall paintings, as
I have said, of ancient Egypt and early art gener-
ally, for their simplest forms
; but to take a much
later instance, and from the art of Florence in the
fifteenth century, look at Botticelli's charming little
picture of " The Nativity," in the National Gallery.
It has
all
the
intentional, or perhaps
instinctive,
ornamental aim of Italian art, and its colour scheme
shows a most dainty and delicate invention
in the
strictest relation to the subject and sentiment, and
is arranged with the utmost subtlety and the nicest
art.
The ring of angels above, for instance,
is partly
relieved upon a gilded ground
to
represent the
dome of heaven.
They bear olive branches, and
the colour of their robes alternates in the following
order
:
rose, olive (shot with gold), and white.
The
rose-coloured angels have
olive and white
wings ; the white angels, rose and olive wings ; and
the olive angels, ^vhite and rose wings,
This
part of the picture by itself forms a most
beautiful
pattern
motive,
while
it expresses
the
idea of peace and goodwill.
Then on
the brown

gold

stable occur three more angels
in white, rose, and
green, respectively.
Against a pale sky rise rich
olive-green trees, forming the background.
The Virgin

BOTTICELLI
in red under-robe and sky-blue mantle.
There is
a gray white ass and a pale brown cow behind
her.
St. Joseph is in steel gray with a golden orange
mantle over.
The brightest white occurs in the drapery upon
which the infant Christ lies.
An angel with a group of men appears, kneeling
on
the
left
relieved
against
white
rocks
;
their
colours are
the angel's wings
peacock blue and
green, and a pale rose robe.
The next figure
is
in
scarlet
;
the next yellow
;
and the
third man
wears pale rose over rich grass-green.
Of the shepherds on the right the first one is in
russet
and white, the next
steely gray, and the
angel
is in white with rose and pale green wings.
The ground is generally warm white and brown,
with dark olive-coloured grass and foliage, so that
the pattern of the
picture
is mainly a ground of
olive, gold, and white, relieved by spots
of rose,
white, blue, yellow, and rose-red and scarlet
the
colour in the groups of angels embracing men
in
*ront being the deepest in tone.
The first angel in this group (on the left) wears
green shot with
gold, with shot green and gold
wings, the human being
in dark
olive and
rich
crimson red.
Next is a white angel with pale rose wings
; the
man in gray with a red mantle over.
Last
is
an
angel
in
rose, with
rose and
red
wings, the man being in scarlet with gray mantle
over.
All the men hold olive branches, and the
group
emphatically
illustrates
the
idea
of

and
goodwill

more what
I have described as a pattern-picture,
and
is of a much
later type.
The
full
flush of
colour and pagan joy of the Renaissance
is here
paramount, expressed with the masterly freedom of
drawing and magnificent colour sense of the great

Yet, looking through the

taining an extremely rich and sumptuous pattern
of colour.
We have a spread of deep-toned blue

TITIAN
Keats might have had this picture in his mind
when he wrote the song in
" Endymion
"
:
" And as I sat, over the light blue hills
There came a noise of revellers
:
the rills
Into the wide stream came of purple hue.
'Twas Bacchus and his crew
!
" The earnest trumpet speaks, and silver thrills
From kissing cymbals made a merry din
'Twas Bacchus and his kin
!
" Like to a moving vintage down they came,
Crowned with green leaves, and faces all on flame
;
All madly dancing through the pleasant valley,
To scare thee, Melancholy
\ "
The " Sacred and Profane Love
" of the same
painter, in the Borghese Gallery
at Rome,
is an
even more splendid example of colour and tone,
and is probably the finest of all Titian's works.
In Paul Veronese we find a cooler key of colour
generally,
with
a
fondness
for
compositions
of
figures with
classical
architecture,
the
rich
pat-
terned robes and varied heads contrasting
pleas-
antly with the severe verticals and smooth surfaces
of the marble columns
a sumptuous and dignified
kind of picture-pattern, and
fully adapted
to
the
decoration of Venetian churches and palaces of
the Renaissance.
Madox
Brown's
" Christ washing
St.
Peter's
Feet," now
in
the Tate
Gallery,
is
a
modern
picture-pattern, and an extremely fine one.
These are but a few instances out of many, and
the
subject
of colour and
pattern,
like
the
ex-
pression of line and form, of which
it
is a part,
is
so large and its sides so multitudinous that to deal

in any way to clear away obscurities, or to lighten
the labours of students, or to suggest fresh ideas
to the minds of any of my readers
in the theory,
history, or practice of art,
I shall feel that my work
has not been in vain, and, at all events,
I can only
say
that
I
have endeavoured
to
give
here
the
results of my own thoughts and experience in art.
281

CONCLUSION
Some may look upon art as a means of livelihood
only, a handmaid of commerce, or as a branch of
knowledge, to be acquired only so far as to enable
one to impart
it to others
; others may regard it as
a polite amusement
; others, again, as an absorbing
pursuit and
passion, demanding the closest devo-
tion
:
but from whatever point of view we may
regard
it, do not let us forget that the pursuit of
beauty in art offers the best of educations for the
faculties, that its interest continually increases, and
its
pleasures and successes are the most
refined
and satisfying.
