)N SCREEN
READING
Following the major chan-
ges in the way that Prestel
is organised four new on-line
leisure magazines have been
launched.
The magazines are a
response to  recent surveys
detailing the users' areas of
interest. Until now on screen
magazines have been rather
boring t o  look a t since
updating a  page always
seemed to take ages. John
Thomany, General Manager
for Prestel Leisure has stated
that " Rationalisation of the
data base and new regional
structures mean that reading
the magazine will be as easy
as ﬂicking to your favourite
page in a newspaper."
The magazines cater for
those interested in the latest
news, sport, leisure c i d
games.
Newsday gives you up to
the minute news, from the
Observer, available 24 hours
a day. The magazine will
feature news headlines
updated throughout the day,
ﬁnancial news, and features.
Travel features, and weather
reports, are provided by AA
Roadwatch, and the Me t
ofﬁce, while rail users will
ﬁnd the instantly accessible
British R a i l  timetables
extremely useful.
Sportseye caters for the
armchair sports-person,
providing cricket informa-
tion for all major counties
and ﬁrst class matches,
updated every few minutes,
with daily news and com-
mentary on every match.
Football fans will ﬁnd ﬁx-
tures, ma tch  previews,
results and league tables.
Horse racing, motor racing,
rugby. American football,
golf and other special sport-
ing events will be covered.
In a live link, Sportstalk
gives subscribers a chance to
interview their favourite
sporting personalities.
Add to all of this quizzes,
the ability to order sports-
kit, from the Sportsshop and
Sportseye, the Sports Coun-
cil's database of sports facil-
ities throughout the UK, and
you've got what is probably
the most comprehensive
package available for sports
fans everywhere.
Look! is designed to be
an entertainment magazine
covering travel, health,
music, theatre, food •and
even an agony aunt.
Information for Look! is
provided by the Consumers
Association, British Rail,
AA R o a d w a tch , T h e
National Theatre and Pres-
tel's own Corkers' Wine
Guide.
Readers of Look! will be
able to purchase wine, order
tickets and take part i n
regular interviews w i th
personalities.
Fun Ga m e s  City is as
its name suggests, dedicated
to those who are looking for
a little light relief.
The Pier has one-armed
bandits, side-shows and
other games -  with cash
prizes. Prizes of hi-ﬁ equip-
ment, videos, and records
will all be given away i n
regular quizzes.
Prestel is an on-line dat-
abase that can be accessed
with a modem and a com-
puter with relevant software.
Subscription costs £8.00
plus VAT per quarter. An
extra connect-time charge is
also made of lp per minute

KNIT I PURL 2
Here's a novel idea for all
you knitters out there. You
know how difﬁcult it is to
read those massive patterns.
What with their tiny squares
YOUR COMMODORE july 1989
7
and black and white for-
mats. Well, help is now at
hand. An enterprising chap
from Bradford, M r  Harry
Morris, has devised a pro-
gram for transposing these
patterns into a more easily
readable fo r m . A t  t h e
moment, the program i s
available for the CM, but
hopefully other formats will
be catered for shortly. To
quote Harry, "This pro-
gramme helps people who
want to  design their own
garments to  print out the
patterns i n  a  more easily
readable form before they
start to knit up".

Having said that, the CM ver •ion of Le Mans 24-hour
Racing is somewhat disappointing, as it offers little more
than the old-style games, and features your car hurtling
along a road that comes out of the screen towards you.
The road in question bends and dips and does all it can
to send you careering into one of the trees, lamposts or
signs that ﬂank it. Your cause isn't helped by the other
road users, who ﬂy past you at a phenomenal speed and
then slam on their brakes to ram you and send you spinning
off the track in a manner that Dick Dastardly would be
proud of.
The object of the game is to drive as fast as you can
between the track's checkpoints, reaching each one in time
to qualify for the next stage. This means keeping your car
as close to 220niph as possible. To add to the incentive
to drive at breakneck speeds. the game awards bonus points
for speeds reached. Since these range from 10 points for

20mph to 80 potnt 2 2 0 m p h ,  it makes sense to keep
the accelerator h u t t o r n l y  pressed down.
Controls are the obvious steer left and right, accelerate
and brake joystick moves, with the ﬁrebutton acting like
a two position gearstiek. This is about the only element
of strategy in the game, as you must change gear when
the speedometer reads 130mph.
Hurtling along a road at 220mph does have its addictive
appeal, particularly when you're racing against the clock,
as the game ends i f you don't reach the next checkpoint
in time. I f  you do, an "extended play" message appears
and the race continues. Perhaps the most infuriating part
I the game is that i t you don't reach the checkpoint in
me, you're forced to retire and are then given a ﬂeeting
glimpse of the entire circuit, which shows you just how
close you were to ﬁnishing. It's infuriating enough to drive
you back for more and more.

HARDWARE R E V I E W
Andrew Brown takes a closer look at the Commodore
PC 10
T
machine in Commodore's range
of PC-XI compatibles, i f you
disregard the bargain basement PC I.
This is an overcrowded market, so
Commodore really needed to  get i t
right for the machine to be successful.
Inevitably however, some corners have
been cut. One group Commodore must
have been aiming at is C64 owners
upgrading to 16 bit technology. These
are people who have been loyal to
Commodore for a long time, so the
following comments are made with
them particularly in mind.
The Hardware
T
he PC 10 is very much a standard
PC, both in terms of looks and
internal architecture. I t  comes as a
three box system, with the monitor
sitting on-top of the system unit, and
the keyboard connected by a cable and
DIN plug on the right hand side. The
dimensions o f  the system unit are
approximately 35*14.5*38cm. This
means that the box is slightly deeper
than its width, and so is a  little
awkward to position on an ordinary
desk.
The front panel overhangs slightly,
though why I cannot fathom, because
the keyboard won't slide under it,
being too high. The overhang con-
tinues round, and on the right side has
the keyboard connector and reset
switch, which felt very wobbly on the
well-travelled review machine. Inspec-
tion of the rear of the machine revealed
an array of ports, including parallel,
YOUR COMMODORE july 1989
12
serial, mouse, composite video and
RGB. Unusually, a set of four DIP
switches were also visible. Using these,
different monitor types can be selected
without having to remove the outer
case.
The mouse port allows connection
of Commodore's own 1352 mouse,
without having to tie up valuable ports
or expansion slots. The power switch
is also at the back, just above the
power-in socket. There was no power-
out socket, so at least two plugs are
needed for this system. The power
supply itself is rated at 75 watts, so
it should be sufﬁcient to  power
anything plugged into the expansion
slots. There are three of these, although
the aluminium covers a t the back
suggest four. Given that almost ever-

1
ything is built into the main board,
this should be ample. All the slots are
lull length, so there should be no
problems with bulky items such as
hard disks on-a-card.
Externally, everything except the
front grille is made of metal, and feels
very sturdy. The ﬁnish may not be to
your taste, being a drab shade of grey,
hut it will be very durable. Removing
the case is just a matter of removing
the six ﬁxing screws, and sliding it off.
Looking inside reveals the disk drive
hays, of which there are three - two
Iloppy, and one hard. The latter
mounts to the left of the ﬂoppies in
a vertical position when present, and
also economises on expansion slots by
having the controller built onto the
main circuit board.
HARDWARE R E V I E W
The keyboard i s o f  the now-
standard 102 key enhanced type. This
differs from the old S4 key type in
having the function keys along the top,
and a separate cursor area. Amiga 500
and 2000 owners will be familiar with
it already, as layout is almost identical.
Two nice touches are a cable-tidy, and
legs that lock into position positively.
'Feel' is a highly subjective matter,
but I  think most users will ﬁnd the
action of the keys perfectly adequate.
Getting used to the layout will prob-
ably prove a problem, and left-handers
like myself will not be to enamoured
of this layout. Indeed the review
machine didn't have the correct system
disks. Also the software needed to set
the keyboard up was not properly

things happening when keys were
pressed. I suspect that if all machines
are sent out in the same way, a lot
of worried telephone calls will result.
The Monitor supplied was the
familiar 1084S monitor, so I  won't
comment on it here, except to suggest
that a stereo monitor is overkill for
a simple PC. More interesting is the
display adaptor, which can support
different kinds of monitor, and hence
graphics standards. Colour monitors
such as the 1084 will produce CGA
graphics, which are more suitable for
games. Monochrome monitors can
display Hercules graphics, and give
80*25 test with crisp characters. So it's
possible to  have a  dual purpose
machine, with monitors fo r  both
serious and games applications con-
nected at the same time.

Processor Speed
T
his is something of an obsession
in PC circles, with endless quoting
of clock speeds in reviews. However
tiresome this can be, it's important to
understand that this has a  direct
bearing on how fast the machine is to
use. The PCIO III uses the original
8088 processor, which is the slowest
of the Intel 808x family of chips, but
clocked at up to 9.54 Mhz. This is
double the original speed, and gives
very nearly twice the performance.
Needless to say, performance is a great
improvement on most 8 bit machinery,
but not in every way.
In use
S witching the machine on brings a
noisy fan to life, and as the display
clears, a number of messages appear
at the top of the screen. These seem
slightly irrelevant, and I wonder if a
better course of action would be to
access them from a set up program.
You then have to boot MSDos by
inserting a system disk. The process
is very similar to running Workbench
on an Amiga, but when it's done, all
you get is just a plain A: p r o m p t.
The machine arrives running at the
4.77Mhz (slow) processor speed a t
switch on To change speeds, you have
to press three keys at once, or use the
speed utility supplied. This is just plain.
silly, and could lose Commodore sales
in the showroom. After all, in the kind
of places where this machine is com-
peting, sales people are unlikely to
have sussed things out sufﬁciently to
change it.
The PCIO will run all the software
you'd expect -  that is, everything
barring packages requiring a hard disc,
or EGA standard graphics adaptor.
Surprisingly though, changing the
processor's clock speed doesn't make
much difference to the computer. On
reﬂection however, it's not so odd, as
the limiting factor on most computer
programs is the speed of the operator,
not the machine. Only the benchmarks
really show the greater processing
power achieved, but even benchmarks
should be taken with a pinch of salt.
In the end, a computer is a productivity
tool, and whether the one you buy
meets your needs is the only question
that must be answered. As a pointer
though, a PC-XT compatible, like the
PC10, should be sufﬁcient for most
home and general use.
HARDWARE REVIEW
Documentation
A  s beﬁts a plain vanilla computer,
the PCIO comes with plain doc-
umentation. Three manuals are pro-
vided, two of which (for MSDos and
GWBasic) are standard Microsoft
issue. A s  such they are perfectly
adequate, but not very friendly to new
users. The third, and slimmest volume
is the Users Manual. This does attempt
to make the introduction to MSDos
a little less panic inducing. I t  is
however, let down by the standard of
production, featuring as it does nasty
line drawings and fuzzy photographs.
Also the manual veers into discussing
low-level programming, something I
would rather see put into a technical
reference manual. It is worth bearing
in mind though, that after the initial
set-up, most people will have n o
further need for this manual,
Conclusion
Comparing the Commodore PCIO
with its nearest competitor, the
Amstrad PCI512, reveals few glaring
deﬁciencies in either. The Amstrad is
cheaper, but the Commodore has a
better display, and so on. It might in
the end come down to who offers the
better bundling deal. At the moment
Commodore are bundling a printer -
the MPS I 230 -  with every PCI0111.
That, in my book, just about swings
it.

Graphics
on the
64
Part two of our introduction to Graphics programming
on the C64
- 1 4
the manipulation of graphics on
the 64. Due to the lack of space,
however, I had to leave two important
aspects untouched.
Firstly, there's the small matter of
bit-mapped graphics. Last month, I
described how you can redeﬁne a
character's shape. If you could ﬁll the
screen with 1,000 different redeﬁned
characters, you could manipulate the
whole display in any way you wanted.
Unfortunately, you only have
access to 256 characters under normal
circumstances. But fear not, the VIC
chip offers a solution - bit 5 of register
$D011 allows the activation o f  a
bitmap mode. Type in the following
command and see what happens:
POKE 5 3 2 6 5 ,  P E E K ( 5 3 2 6 5 )  O R  3 2
You should then have a screen full of
jumbled rubbish, t h e  t o p  h a l f
comprising lines and random dots, the
bottom h a l f comprising the fu l l
character set. Clear the screen and type
some ra n d o m characters. T h e
character colour should change where
each character is placed, and you
should see a ﬂashing cursor.
What you have now is a view of
the block o f  ram fro m memory
location 0 to 8191. The ﬂickering at
the top of the screen is the changing
of zero page locations by the operating
system. The normal screen memory is
used to  provide the character and
background colours, and the memory
from 0 to 8191 deﬁnes the dot patterns.
PROGRAMMING
If you want to use bit map mode, you'll
need to use a more suitable memory
area. The easiest option, if you're using
small Basic programs and you don't
want to move Basic, is to select the
block of memory from 8192 to 16192.
You do this by tweaking the memory
register as before. Press RUN/STOP
and RESTORE to reset the display.
and type in the following:
10 POKE 5 3 2 6 5 , P E E K ( 5 3 2 6 5 )  OP, 3 2
20 POKE 5 3 2 7 2 , P E E K ( 5 3 2 7 2 )  O R 9
30 FO R I  =  0  TO  7 9 9 9
40 POKE 8 1 9 2 + 1 , 0
50 NE X T /
This time you get a  more regular
display, which is progressively cleared.
Lines 30 to 50 clear the bit map by
inserting zero bytes. Replace line 40
with t he following, and see what
happens:
40 PO KE 8 1 9 2 + 1 , R N D ( 1 ) * 2 5 6
You c an see that b y  changing the
memory block, you can change the bit
map. As I  said before, the screen
memory deﬁnes the colours o f the
bitmap. The bottom four bits of each
screen l o c a t i o n  s p e c i f y  t h e
background colour, and the top four
bits deﬁne the character colour.
Imagine that you want a  white
background and a yellow foreground
- the value for white is 1 (binary 0001),
the value for yellow 7 (binary 0110.
Combine them, and we get 01110001
or 113. Add the following lines to the
above program, and see the effect:
YOUR COMMODORE july 1989
15
60 FOR I  =  0  TO  9 9 9
70 POKE 1 0 2 4 +1 , 1 1 3
80 NEXT I
Voila! Th e  required colour com-
bination is obtained.
As before, tw o  resolutions are
available, depending on the value of
bit 4 of register SD016. To set high
resolution bitmap with a horizontal
resolution of 320 dots, you use:
I
To set multicolour bitmap you use:
-\
POKE 5 3 2 7 0 ,  PEEK (53270)01:U6
Both modes have a verticle resolution
of 200 dots. But how do we control
which dot is set or  cleared? Assume
you want to set a dot with a horizontal
position of X, and a vertical resolution
of Y. The following subroutine will set
this dot:
6 0 0 0 0  C I N T ( X / 4 ) :  R . I N T ( T M :  4 1 . 7 - 4 A  A N D
6 0 0 1 0  D T 4 1 4 2 + R . 3 2 0 . 8 • C . 4 Y  ARO 7 )
60020 POKE 0 T, PEEK(0 Y) O R  (2AO1)
4 0 0 3 0  RE TURN
To erase a dot replace line 60020 with:
1
Try the above subroutine with the
following program:
10 POKE 5 3 2 6 5 , P E E K ( 5 3 2 6 5 )  O R  3 2
20 POKE 5 3 2 7 2 , P E E K ( 5 3 2 7 2 )  O R  8

This time, line 70 sets the background
colour to white, and the foreground
colour to black. The program should
draw a diagonal line from the top left
hand corner,
Multicolour mode uses the same
dot p a ir  system as  characters t o
determine which colours are used. The

have noticed that bit map
routines are very slow. Multicolour
mode is even more so, since you need
to handle pairs of dots. For successful
use of bitmap graphics, it's necessary
to access assembler routines fo r
drawing.
The ﬁnal area needing comment is
the use of sprites. A sprite is a block
of graphical information, rather like
a character, which can be placed
anywhere on the screen. A  sprite
consists of a square block 24 dots wide
and 21 characters high. Each row uses
3 bytes, so that each sprite requires
3 x 21 bytes of memory. The VIC chip
has a set of registers which determine
how sprites are handled. All you need
to do is insert the correct values in
the relevant registers.
First, we must set up a pattern. You
can design a  sprite i n  a  manner
analogous to that used by characters,
but it's a bit more difﬁcult. It's far
better to use a sprite designer. The
sprite patterns are sought in blocks of
M bytes, starting at memory location
O. Sprite pattern 0 occupies memory
locations 0 to 63, pattern 1 occupies
64 to 127, and so on. You can use the
following formula to determine the
start address of sprite pattern x:
You will
a d d r e s s  =  x ° 6 4 t h a n k  s t a r t  a d d r e s s
Since the VIC chip is looking at a
speciﬁc memory bank, this address is
really offset from the start address of
the bank. Since the default bank for
Basic is bank 0, the bank start address
is O. Since the 64 is an eight b i t
machine, only 8 sprites are supported.
The VIC chip ﬁnds the sprite pattern
from a block of eight sprite pointers.
These are located 1016 bytes after the
start o f the video memory. In  the
default set up, the pointers therefore
start at 1024+1016 or 2040.
The pattern for sprite 0 is held in
the ﬁrst pointer, the pattern for sprite
1 in the second pointer, and so on.
If you want to set up sprite 0 to the
pattern held at location 12288, you set
the sprite pointer as follows:
PRO G RAMMING
P a t t e r n  n u m b e r  =  1 2 2 8 8 / 6 4  1 9 2
POKE 2 0 4 0 ,  1 9 2
Rather like the character set, you may
not use the area in bank 0 which is
occupied b y  the character R OM
image. It is also impractical to use the
system area in zero page ram. The
useable block is from 8192 to 14336,
for example, blocks 128 to 255.
The next step is to position your
sprite. The useful screen area occupies
a horizontal (X) position from X=24
to X=344, and a vertical position (Y)
from Y=50 to Y=240. Each sprite has
a register for its vertical position. Since
the horizontal position can be larger
than 255, two registers are used. Each
sprite has a register for the low byte
of its X position, and there's a single
register for the high bytes o f the X
positions. The registers are found
from:
Y r e g i s t e r  .  5 3 2 4 9  •  S p r i t e  N o  •  2
X l o w  b y t e  r e g i s t e r  .  5 3 2 4 5  •  S p r i t s  N o  
2
X h i s s  b y t e  r e g i s t e r  .  5 2 2 6 4
Before we move on, we must consider
how a register holds sprite data. Each
sprite has a  speciﬁc b i t which
determines how an attribute is set.
Sprite 0 uses bit 0, sprite 5 uses bit
5, and so on.
Using the above relationship, the
following routine will set up a sprite's
position. X  and Y  are the sprite's
position, and S N  i s the sprite's
number:
10 PO KE 5 3 2 4 9 4 5 N .2 , X
20 H B.• I N T ( X/ 2 5 6 )

60 POKE 5 3 2 6 4 , PEEKI 5 3 2 6 4 ) M 0 ( 2 5 5 - 2 SN )
Lines 50 and 60 show the way o f
toggling bits in sprite registers. Line
50 turns the bit on, and line 60 turns
it off. This approach is used with the
other registers. Table 1 summarises the
sprite registers - for each, you apply
the following relationships:

The priority register determines the
position of the sprite relative to the
screen contents. If the relevant bit is
set, the sprite is behind the screen
contents. If the bit is cleared, the sprite
is in front of the screen contents. Sprite
to sprite priorities are determined by
the sprite number. Sprite 7 is rearmost
and sprite 0 is foremost on the screen.
As with characters, you have the
option o f  using single colour high
resolution sprites or four colour high
resolution sprites o r  four colour
multicolour sprites. There are eight
colour registers which specify the high
resolution colour. They are found by
using:

When using sprites, you may want to
detect whether they collide with other
screen contents. Two sprite collision
registers are used.
Register 53278 detects collisions
between sprites. The bits relevant to
the sprites involved are set if there is
a collision. If, for example, sprites 0
and 5 collide, then bits 0 and 5 are
set. When you read this register to
decide if the collision has occurred, the
register is automatically cleared.
Register 53279 detects collisions
between sprites and the characters on
the screen. It functions in the same way
as the sprite-to-sprite collision register.
Well, that's the theory. Next time,
give a  set o f assembly routines
which will take some of the bother out
of using graphics on the 64.

\I
T
drive has often been described
as a lumbering hippo, the rea-
son for this being that disk access is
extremely slow. A good indication of
just how slow a C64 drive is, is that
many games load quicker fro m
cassette than from disk - silly, isn't
it?
There are a  variety o f  options
available to disk users to help speed
up disk access and loading time. These
are:
Software fast loader
Cartridge
Replacement DOS
The ﬁrst method of disk speeding is
OK when it works. But often, clashes
between the memory used by a fast
loader and the program you're trying
to load prevent such a speed up system
being used. Another problem is that
a fast loader for one make of drive
will not necessarily work on a different
Commodore drive.
A cartridge-based fast loader
usually gives a better chance of loading
a program than the software method,
since many cartridges take up little or
no user RAM. However, there are
problems. Firstly, you have to plug
them in to your machine when you
want to use them, and. despite warn-
ings, many people have damaged their
C64 REVIEW
J i f f y  D o s
Can the Jiffy defeat the dolphin?
By S. Garton
computers by plugging in or unplug-
ging cartridges while the machine is
switched on.
Secondly, some cartridges require
you to load fast load software into
them, so by the time you've loaded the
software in, you may as well have
loaded the program i n  slow mode
anyway. Still other cartridges require
that you freeze, or copy, the program.
Unfortunately, not all programs can
be frozen.
The third method of disk speed-
up is, to  m y  mind, the best. A
replacement DOS system usually
requires you to open up both your disk
drive and CM or Cl28, remove some
chips and add new ones containing the
new disk access software. Two such
systems are currently available. Firstly,
there is Dolphin DOS, which has been
around for some time. Now there is
a new system on offer called Jiffy
DOS.
I've been using Dolphin Dos for
sime time now, and am particularly
happy with it. Dolphin DOS not only
replaces chips inside the computer, but
a new lead is used for communication
between drive and computer. How-
ever, this lead plugs into the user port
at the rear of the computer, which is
a real inconvenience at times, since I
use this port for other things, such as
my modem.
YOUR COMMODORE july 1989

Since I'm so pleased with Dolphin
Dos, I was at ﬁrst reluctant to try out
the new replacement DOS system from
Financial Systems Software -  Jiffy
DOS. However when I  did, I  was
pleasantly surprised by what was on
offer.
What You Get
One great problem with Dolphin DOS
is that it will only work with my 1541
disk drive. I have a second drive, but
this is an Excelerator, and I've been
unable to ﬁnd a fast DOS system to
work with this. Until now that is
Jiffy DOS is available for all of the
following computers and disk drives:
C64, MC, SX-64, Cl28, C128D, 1541,
1541C, 1541-11, 1571, 1581, FSD-1,
FSD-2, Excelerator+, Excel 2001, as
well as some others.
The fact that you've probably never
heard of some of these disk drives will
probably indicate to  you that Jiffy
DOS i s o f  American origin. The
originators of Jiffy DOS in the States
are Creative Micro Designs Inc. As
you can see from the extensive list
above, this replacement DOS is avail-
able for a much wider range of systems
than any other system available.
The ﬁrst thing that I noticed about
Jiffy DOS was the lack of parts to it
7

C64 REVIEW
- gone are the complicated boards and
leads that I associate with my Dolphin
DOS. If you have a CM, you simply
get two chips with switches attached.
If you have a CI 28, you get three chips,
two o f them connected to  a  single
switch. One o f  these chips is the
replacement ROM to go inside your
disk drive. The other chip (or chips),
is a replacement ROM for the K ER-
NAL chip (or chips), inside your
computer.
Installation of the new chips is both
quick and simple a l l  that is needed
is a screwdriver and a little common
sense. Clear, step by step installation
instructions are included i n  the
package.
What It Does
Jiffy DOS is designed to speed up all
disk operations, including L OAD ,
SAVE, FORMAT etc. The package
claims increases of up to 15 times the
speed o f a standard drive. A  DOS
wedge is included in the new chips.
This adds 14 new commands to Basic
which give you much quicker access
to your disks. Single key LOAD,
SAVE, and directory commands are
also added.
If you have a Cl28 then the DOS
works in both CM and C128 modes,
Rather than spouting on about all of
the commands that are offered by Jiffy
Dos, I've listed all of the new com-
mands in Figure I.
If you want to see just how well
Jiffy DOS performed, then you should
check out Figure 2. Please note these
ﬁgures are for a C128 with an Excel-
erator disk drive. Other combinations
may give different results.
How Was It?
So what did I think of Jiffy DOS? The
lack of a parallel cable was the ﬁrst
good point 1 noticed, I could have my
drive where I wanted it, serial cable
allowing, rather than wherever a short
parallel lead dictated I  have i t.
Secondly, the ability to use a smaller
Excelerator drive rather than my bulky
1541 was of great beneﬁt.
On the software side, I found that
most programs that I  tried worked
without any problems, though some
heavily protected software would not
load without me disabling the new
DOS.
Disabling the DOS simply required
that the switches mentioned be turned
off. Jiffy DOS can be switched in and
out while the computer is still on. This
has the advantage that should a
program not load while the DOS was
turned on, I could simply switch it off_
Once the program had loaded, I could
turn the DOS back on in order to speed
up any further disk activity.
Dolphin D OS  presents C I  28
owners with a slight problem - if the
Cl28 Kernal is replaced, then you lose
the ability to  load software from
cassette tape. If you should ever need
to use tape in Cl28 mode, you'd have
to open up the machine and put your
old Kernal back in. Flicking the Jiffy
DOS switch turns the DOS completely
off, and tape use is then allowed, a
great beneﬁt fo r C128 users who
require tape.
Of course Jiffy DOS isn't all a bed
of roses, and there are a number of
areas where I feel Dolphin DOS has
the edge on it. For starters I did miss
being able to access the monitor that's
built into Dolphin DOS. The machine
code monitor that Dolphin D OS
provides may only be a simple one,
but it does come in handy at times.
Dolphin DOS is quicker than Jiffy
DOS, and having used Dolphin DOS
for some time, I did sometimes ﬁnd
myself waiting for something to load.
The cheaper price of Jiffy DOS and
its ability to work with just about any
system conﬁguration does make it an
excellent product. Dolphin D OS
offers a few more facilities, but does
limit you to the type of disk drive you
can use.
Being a Cl28 user who quite often
needs to use a cassette recorder in 128
mode, uses the user port for plugging
a number of items into the computer
and requires quick disk access, Jiffy
DOS does everything that I require,
and would be my choice over Dolphin
DOS, even if it isn't quite as fast.

Mouse 80
Do you own a C128 and a mouse? Then here's the
utility to use them together in 80-column text mode
By D.H. Faber
W
mouse (Commodore 1351),
I was not too surprised to
ﬁnd that the accompanying software
contained a Cl28 mousedriver for the
40 column mode only. After all, the
8563 VDC chip (or 8568 in the newer
models with 64K video ram) does not
support sprites, and its complicated
access method doesn't help in creating
software sprites either!
However, 1 intended to use my new
acquisition mainly in my own pro-
grams for the selection of options (or
ﬁlenames, etc.) from the 80 column
screen. If you have similar needs, the
utility MOUSE80 described below is
the answer. If you don't own a mouse,
please read on anyway, because joys-
tick control is also provided!
How it works
At this point, let's assume you've
already spent some time typing in the
programs (see: "getting it in"), and you
have th e  machine code u ti l i ty
MOUSE80 and the basic demo pro-
gram DEMOMOUSE8O_BAS a t
hand. Let's combine an X-ray of the
utility's inner life with some action on
your part! Connect the mouse to either
port (if no mouse signals are detected
on port I  then port 2 is tested), or,
if you don't have a mouse plug in a
joystick instead (if no mouse signals
are detected on either port, then joy-
stick control is assumed; note that
these tests occur within the MOUSES()
utility itself, not in the demo program).
Now load a n d  r u n  D E M O -
MOUSE80, BAS (tape users beware:
the ﬁrst thing it wants to do is load
MOUSE80). I f  all is well, you'll see
a screen with lines numbered from 0
to 27, using various colours for each
line (if you - like me h a ve  to make
do with a monochrome halftone you'll
see one additional halftone only).
On the upper half of the screen,
the two character sets are displayed,
the lower half shows a.m. some options
that can be selected. The mouse's
cursor takes the shape of an arrow,
C128 PROGRAM
initially situated somewhere i n  the
lower region of the screen. (MOUSE80
was written for the Commodore 1351
mouse; since I cannot vouch for the
compatibility of other brands, you'll
have to try them for yourself).
Feel free to  move the arrow
around, but don't press any buttons
yet! Joystick users will note that the
arrow accelerates as the movement
continues, its speed is doubled with
each of the four available "gears"; with
a proportional mouse there's no need
for such acceleration.
Notice anything funny on the
fourth line? There are six adjacent
characters showing fragments of the
arrow and the characters it is currently
moving over. This has to do with the
way the soft-sprite is generated: the
cursor (arrow) affects u p  to  six
character positions; the bit patterns are
taken from the character set, the sprite
is overlaid and the six "reserved"
characters are used t o  display the
"sprited" ones.
This process is repeated continu-
ously until one of the mouse buttons
(or the ﬁre button of the joystick) is
pressed. The six characters sacriﬁced
for this purpose are rather obscure
ones:
REVERSE+CBM+Y/U/O/H/J/1.,
(screen display codes 244-249 in the
graphic set).
This is no great loss, especially
since the same characters are still
available in the alternative set. Any-
way, if you don't like the choice you
can select a different set of six adjacent
characters to  be sacriﬁced fo r this
purpose (see below).
Two more things are noticeable
about the arrow's movement. Firstly,
it doesn't leave the screen area. In the
vicinity of the borders it even changes
direction to be able to point at the
borders "from within". Secondly,
although it moves pixel-by-pixel in a
vertical direction, in horizontal direc-
tion it moves two pixels at a time.
This was done not out of necessity,
but fo r  practical reasons only: i t
YOUR COMMODORE july 1989

reduces the required mouse-move-
ment, which otherwise would be twice
as large horizontally as for the 40-
column screen. Also, this utility was
not designed for graphical packages,
so greater accuracy w o u l d  b e
superﬂuous.
Now, avoiding the "selection
areas" for the time being, try "clicking"
on various places on the screen. in the
right-hand bottom corner o f  the
screen, you may read at what position
exactly you clicked. Here the character
positions are counted from zero on-
wards (as in Basic's CHAR instruc-
tion). Note that the maximum pix
value in horizontal direction is 638
instead of 639, since the arrow points
to the leftmost point of a pair of pixels
(see above).
What happens is that after pressing
a button, control is returned to the
calling program, which can then ex-
amine the latest cursor position and
decide what to do next (if not on an
OPTION area, continue with the
arrow i n  the same position). The
calling program can also detect which
button (in case a mouse is used) was
pressed (see below). This demo pro-
gram treats both buttons alike.
You may have noticed that the
arrow takes on the colour o f the
characters it is displayed on, unlike the
normal cursor which temporarily
"paints" the character it is on. There
exists another possibility however: try
clicking on MONOCHROME. This
results in a screen in one colour only,
but some characters are now looking
weird.
What's happened? If the ATR-bit
in register 25 o f the VDC is turned
off, then the foreground colour is
taken from the left nibble of register
26 and not from the attributes. How-
ever, the processor doesn't look at the
attributes fo r  the characterset b i t
either! Instead, for all characters the
graphic set is assumed. Therefore, if
you want to  use the monochrome
mode, build your option screen with
characters from the graphic set only
(you may consider swapping the sets
in video ram to use characters from
the other set instead).
One more remark on this: the
colour used fo r the monochrome

option is the one used in the most
recent PRINT statement as stored in
location 241 (SF1). You may also poke
the desired colour code directly into
this location.
To continue our guided tour, click
on COLOR to  restore the multico-
loured screen. Up to now we've used
a steady arrow, If you feel it's difﬁcult
at times to locate its position, espe-
cially on a crowded part of the screen,
try clicking on BLINK FASTER and
BLINK SLOWER. You'll ﬁnd that
you may choose between a  steady
cursor (speed=0) and one that blinks
slowly (speed=15) to quickly (speed=1).
This option can also be easily initiated
from the calling program when using
MOUSE80 (see below).
Before ending the demo by clicking
QUIT, some more remarks are i n
order. The VDC must be in 80-column
mode, 8*8 pixels pro character (as on
power-up). You may change the start
addresses o f  screen, attributes and
character sets, and you may also
change the number of lines displayed.
If you're not sure how to do this, it
may help to consult the listing of the
demo program.
For the sake o f  completeness:
MOUSE80 is not wedged into the I RQ
routine as is usually done with mouse
drivers. The reason is to be found in
the VDC's complicated access method.
Changing or reading the contents of
a location in video ram (or even a
register) requires a  multitude of
machine code instructions, a n d
another program trying to access the
VDC can easily corrupt some of its
contents, with unpredictable results.
Therefore MOUSE80 returns control
only after a mouse button
has been pressed; in the
meantime it even inhibits
interrupts to avoid key-
board interference.
In use
The machine code ﬁle
MOUSE80 loads from $HOO to
SE9E0 in RAM 0 (the area from
SE9E0 to SEA6F is used as a
scratch pad). From BASIC
the mousedriver is called as:
BANKO:SYS57344,A,X,Y
The Meaning of the parameters
A, X and Y (which are trans-
ferred to the accu, X-register
and Y-register respectively) is as
follows:
X horizontal character position at
C128 PRO G RAM
which the sprite will ﬁrst appear (0-
79).
Y = idem vertical character position.
Normal range 0-24 or higher i f you
changed the number of lines displayed.
Note that the parameters are not
checked! A  special case is X=Y=255:
the sprite will reappear at the same
spot it was in when the previous call
to MOUSE80 returned control to the
calling program. This is useful to re-
start the driver if you click on an irr-
elevant part of the screen.
A = blink speed. 0 for no blink, 1 to
15 for fast to slow blink. If A<16 the
mouse driver operates in colour-mode.
To use monochrome mode add 128 to
the value of A; the colour used is taken
from the most recent PRINT state-
ment or may be poked directly to
location 241 (4E1).
Control is returned to the calling
program after pressing one o f  the
YOUR COMMODORE july 1989
21
mouse buttons (or the ﬁre button of
a joystick). Relevant information is
stored in registers A, X  and Y. To
obtain these values use:
RREG A,X,Y
(A) Is zero i f the left mouse button
was pressed, 1 for the right button (its
value is irrelevant for a joystick). The
values of X and Y are the horizontal
and vertical character positions respec-
tively at which the arrow was pointing.
You may ﬁnd the exact pixel values
as follows:
BANKO
SYS57402:RREG A,X:XPIX = A  +
256*X
SYS57427:R REG A,X:YPIX -7- A  +
256*X
If you want to sacriﬁce different
characters to generate the soft sprite,

you should:
POKE the screen display code of the
ﬁrst one to location SE9DE (=59870);
the default value is 244.
POKE the characterset (0 or I )  to
location SE9DF (=5987I); default is 0
(the graphic set).
For ASSEMBLER programmers:
you may call the driver from anywhere
in RAMO below SD000.

LDA #
STA $EFOO
(set A, X, Y as above)
JSR $EIM
On return A, X and Y contain values
whose meaning is as described above.
To obtain the exact pixel location of
the arrow use:
LDA # $3F
STA SEFOO
JSR SEO3A
to obtain the low- and high byte of
the x-value in A and X respectively.
Use JSR SE053 likewise to obtain the
y-value.
If you wish to call these routines
from underneath the I/ 0 area (SD000-
SE000), or from a different RAM bank
or a cartridge or the function ROM,
you'll have to use the kernals JSRFAR
routine. If you really intend to do this,
I expect you'll know how it works, if
not consult a  decently documented
ROM listing.
MOUSE80 does of course contain
subroutines to  access the VDC's
registers and the video ram. As a bonus
C128 PRO G RAM
to assembler programmers, here's how
to use them for your own purposes.
Assuming the calling program is in
RAMO and not underneath the I/O
area, you must select a bank with
RAMO and the 1,0 components:
LDA #
STA $FE
(from SD000-SE000 o r  from other
banks you must use JSRFAR, see
above). You can now use ﬁve subrou-
tines as follows:
REGWRITE : JSR $E003 (A,X) -
value X is stored in register A
REG READ: JSR SEOOF (A) - value
of register A is stored in A
VDCWRITE : JSR SE,01B (A,X,Y) -
value Y is stored in video ram at A/
X (low' high byte)
VDCREAD : JSR SE025 (A,X) - the
value in video ram (AIX low/high
byte) is transferred to A
SETUPDATE : JSR SEO2D (A,X) -
the contents of A and X are transferred
to registers 19 and 18 (UPDATE low
and high respectively).
To Basic programmers, these sub-
routines are not available since there
exists no BANK command to select
the required memory conﬁguration.
However, if you consult the listing of
the demo program and copy the
DATA statements and the lines poking
them into memory, you'll have the
same facilities available in BANK 15
by:
REGWRITE: SYS3072,A,X
REGREAD: SYS3084,A
YOUR COMMODORE july 1989

VDCWRITE: SYS3096,A,X,Y
VDCREAD: SYS3106,A,X
SETUPDATE: SYS3I14,A,X
Getting it in
In the listings you'll ﬁnd the two Basic
loaders ENTER64/ DEMO.BAS and
ENTER64/ INTER. Enter and save
these using YC's syntax checker (in 64
the following pokes:
mode!). Next (still in 64 mode), enter
POKE43, 81:POKE44,41:POKE
10576,0 and L OA D  "ENTER64/
DEMO.BAS",8 (or I for tape users;
they should also change 8 to 1 in line
120 of the program). Now run it: the
Basic program DEMOMOUSE80.
BAS is written to disk (or tape), ready
to be used in 128 mode.
Next type "NEW" and (again in
64 mode) enter the same pokes as
above a n d  L OAD "EN TER 6 4 1
INTER",8 (tape users should change
the 8 to I ,  also in line 110 o f the
program) a n d  r u n  i t :  i t  saves
I NTER128 to disk or tape. Now restart
your computer i n 128 mode, load
INTERI28 (tape users: change 8 to I
in line 10) and run it: this produces
the machine code ﬁle MOUSE80.
One ﬁnal note fo r tape users:
remove the BLOAD from line 10 of
the demo program a n d  L O A D
"MOUSE 8 0 ",I,I i n  direct mode

COMMODORE 128
C128 Corner
If you own a C128 and have a tip,
query or simply want to
communicate with other
C128 owners, this is the
page for you
T
is a bit of a white elephant. Its
m e m o r y andcapabilitiesreally
do put some other computers, includ-
ing the C64 and C16, to shame. Not
only does it offer total compatibility
with the extremely popular C64, but
it also boasts an impressive Basic, both
40 and 80 column screen formats and
a massive I28K memory (not as much
as an Amiga, but double that of a CM).
Not only do the facilities o f the
machine itself far surpass those of the
C64, but its disk drives are superior
to the lumbering 154I's. Both the 1570
and 1571 are far quicker than the 1541
drive, but the 1571 is also double-sided,
giving double the amount of storage
per disk - without having to resort to
the Hippy technique of turning the disk
over.
Unfortunately though, the similar-
ities between the C128 and the white
elephant do not end with the size and
power of the computer - software for
the CI 28 is extremely scarce and the
Cl28 computer itself seems to be about
as common as a white elephant.
It's a great shame that the Cl28
was never given the acclaim it deserved
by the software houses, o r  even
Commodore itself. Your Commodore
has been one of the few magazines that
has continually supported the C128
range over the years, and this page is
simply an extension of that support.
'Cl28 Corner' is the page for all
Commodore 128 users. It's designed
to be a forum for all queries and tips
relating to your computer. But, and
it's a  big but, '128 Corner' cannot
succeed without your help. If you have
a query about your 128 or software
for the machine, then write to this
page. If you have a tip you'd like to
share with other C128 users, write to
us. I f  you learn about anything
happening i n  the Cl28 world that
hasn't been covered in the magazine,
write to us.

Help us to help you without your
input, 'Cl28 Corner' will be impossible
to produce, so support your machine
by writing to us.
Forgotten Memories
The Your Commodore ofﬁce often
receives queries about software that
works on "a friend's Cl28D" but not
on their C128. This is usually due to
the fact that the Cl28 and Cl281)
computers are not totally identical -
the C128D computer has more video
memory than most (but not all)
standard C128 computers. This differ-
ence only becomes apparent if you're
running a program that uses the extra
64K of video RAM that is present on
some 128s.
The problem is not insurmounta-
ble. All that's required is a memory
upgrade for your C128 that gives your
computer access to 64K extra video
RAM. Financial Systems Software is
the only company we're aware of that
sells such a memory upgrade. It's a
small circuit board that's plugged into
the board inside your C128.
As long as you can use a screw-
driver and are capable o f  delicate
work, you should have no problems
ﬁtting the board yourself. Don't forget
though, that if you do open up your

Cl28 you'll invalidate your guarantee.
Once the board is ﬁtted, programs that
require aditional video R A M  will
work with no problems.
Financial Systems Software, supp-
liers o f  the aforementioned R A M
board, is probably the biggest supplier
of C128 software at the moment. I f
you do own a C128, then I suggest
you take a look at FSSs ads, or even
get hold of their catalogue, since they
offer an impressive range of products
- including an excellent Cl28 newslet-
ter/ magazine.
FSS can be contacted at:
18 High Street,
Pershore, Worcs
WRIO IBG
Tel: (0386) 553153
Write All About It
Since the C128 has an 80-column
screen, it's ideal for use as a wordpro-
cessor - in fact much of Your Com-
modore is written using C I28s - both
the Editor and Technical Editor use
them for all their wordprocessing.
We receive a  large number o f
telephone calls and letters asking just
what wordprocessors are available for
COMMODORE 128
the Cl28 range. To  our knowledge
there are at least four wordprocessing
packages available. Firstly there is
Superscript 128. This offers both 40
and 80-column display options, and is
fully compatible with the popular C64
version of the same program. This is
available from Precision Software
(Tel: 01-330 7166), at 09.95.
Viza Classic from Viza Software
offered the user a full 'What You See
Is What You Get' (WYSIWYG) dis-
play, together with easy-to-use pull
down menus. Viza Classic only works
in 80-columns. Viza Classic no longer
seems to be available, but, if you scour
the computer shows you should ﬁnd
it.
American software publishers
Batteries Not Included have produced
a number of versions of their Paperclip
wordprocessor fo r the Cl28. The
favourite in the ofﬁce is Paperclip
This version not only has superb
wordprocessing facilities, but also has
an inbuilt communications package.
Batteries Not Included do not market
in the UK, but you could try contacting
them directly at in the States.
The ﬁnal wordprocessor we've
looked at is Font Master 128,
This wordprocessor not only offers the
normal editing features you'd expect,
but also allows you to print out your
text in a variety of fonts -  you can
even design your own fonts if you're
feeling particularly creative.
Should you only have a dot matrix
printer, then you may ﬁnd that this
is an excellent choice for you, as the
quality of the printout will probably
be better than the normal quality that
you get from your print mechanism.
Fontmaster 128 is available from
ESSL.
Please Write In
We cannot stress too much that if you
own a C128 then this is your section
of the magazine, and that we need to
hear from you in order to produce this
page for you. Should you have any
hints, tips, questions, news or com-
ments, then please write to:

SYS49152, Text
Quick S
If you need to change
anything in your Basic text,
ﬁnd and list it
with this handy routine
By Neil Higgins
For example, if you wanted to list all
the lines in your program where the
variable AS appears, you would simply
enter:-
SYS49152,AS
C64 PR O G R AMMIN G
SYS49152, REM
- -
H
programming in Basic, and y o u  wanted to list all REM statements,
suddenly found out that you y o u ' d  enter:-
need to change a variable to another
N rattle, or re-edit a string of text? Put
it this way - if you'd a pound for every
time you've had to  re-edit a  Basic
program, you'd be richer than the
editor of Your Commodore!
The main problem encountered is
that you always need to search the
whole program to make sure all the
correct changes have been made,
especially if it's a variable that needs
changing.
This all adds up to lots of typing
of the command LIST, which in a long
program can be a bit of a pain. Well
fear no more, the routine given here
will do all the searching and listing for
you, and all you need supply is the
text to be searched for. To do this,
the syntax is:
As with all keywords, to save a bit
of typing you can enter the abbreviated
form. For example, to search for all
occurrences of the PRINT statement
you may use:-
SYS49152,?
If you wanted to search for a full string,
that's how you would enter it. For
example, to ﬁnd a string deﬁned as
"My word", you'd enter:-
SYS49I52, "My word".
Note that the same string would also
be listed if you entered:-
SYS49152, My word.
But so would any other lines contain-
ing the words, My word, i f you get
my point?
If you, experiment with a  large
Basic program, you'll ﬁnd out the
easiest ways to  use the routine.
Sometimes, if the chosen text appears
in a lot of lines, they will disappear
YOUR COMMODORE july 1989
30
rch
off the top of the screen like a normal
listing. To prevent this, you can use
the space bar to pause the listing, in
which case pressing another key will
continue the search. The Run/ stop key
will break out. Please note: this routine
can only be called in direct mode, not
from within a Basic program.
For the technically minded, the
routine resides in the 4K block of Ram
from SC000, and stores the text to be
searched for in a table directly after
itself. Machine coders will ﬁnd the
source code useful, particularly if they
wish to conclude the routine as part
of an extended Basic type program.
The routine was written using the Your
Commodore Speedy Assembler, but
should be transportable to  most
assemblers.
Getting It All In
I've supplied two methods of typing
in the program. Method one provides
the source listing i f  you have an
assembler. This listing is well docu-
mented, so you can see how the routine
works. Secondly, I have provided a
Basic loader. Remember to save your
efforts before running it -  accidents
will happen.

patibles, that now include an
extensive range of C.BN1 PCs)
is rapidly staking its claim as a games
machine. As you will see from the
selection of titles listed below, the PC
is not only a rival of the C64 and the
Amiga in selection and quality, hut is
often the ﬁrst machine a  game is
released on, For example, Infocom's
Battletech arrived fo r  the PC  i n
January, but we're still waiting for the
other versions.
The PC obviously has an impres-
sive following in the States, and so
many o f the games have American
origins, but are now beginning to ﬁnd
a niche over here. So at last, PC owners
can put aside their spreadsheets and
databases and play a game.
The PC tends to attract strategy-
based games that are ideally suited to
a hard disk system. And remember,
a PC hard disk costs only £200, which
is only a third of the price of the Amiga
counterpart. The PC  is an option
deﬁnitely worth considering.

transition from text-only adventures to

The PC is now a serious rival of the Amiga and C64 in
the games machine race, and it's getting more popular
all the time
By Tony Hetherington
based on the Battle tech series of board
games. in which giant mechs (ﬁghting
machines) slug i t out with lasers,
machine guns and missiles.
You play Jason Youngblood, a
young trainee mech pilot who is faced
with a  desperate mission when the
deadly Kurita warriors attack and
destroy your city. The only hope for
your Lyran Commonwealth is to ﬁnd
the other survivors of the attack, and
then track down the secret store of
mech parts that will enable you to
launch a counter-attack.
During the game you will have to
inﬁltrate enemy bases, ﬁght enemy
mechs in open combat, learn how to
repair and patch up your mechs and
party, and how to weed out the traitors
who try to sabotage your mission,
Also from infocom: Superb text

Pool of Radiance/SSI (US
Gold)
j J ungeons and Dragons is the cult
role-playing game, and so it was
inevitable that there would be a
computer game. Despite heavy com-
petition. SSI won the rights to do it.
Pool of Radiance was the ﬁrst com-
puter role-playing game and, after an
initial learning stage, is unbeatable.
Here at last is the game system you
always wanted to  play, with the
character classes, monsters and spells
that other systems copied, and all the
original's characteristics o f strength,
intelligence and so on.
The combat system can at ﬁrst
seem very slow, especially when you're
up against an army of orcs, but this
soon grows on you as it gives you time
to deﬁne and carry out y our  Own

strategy and tactics. This becomes vital
when your magic users become strong
enough to start hurling around ﬁre-
balls and lightning bolts.
What I particularly like about Pool
of Radiance are the unexpected sur-
prises that it throws at you - just when
you think you've got on top of things
and your conﬁdence is growing, a trap,
a monster o r some other equally
unpleasant situation puts you in your
place.
The game also shows the value of
a hard disk system as, after a lengthy
installation process, you can play and
save the game without ever changing
a disk.

your aim is to lie, cheat and deceive
your opponents. You control one of
the major powers i n  Europe, circa
1870, and must use your limited armies
and ﬂeets to  take control o f  the
continent's supply centres and com-
plete your domination of the world.
Unfortunately, six other human or
computer players have exactly the
same aims and ambitions. The only
way to succeed is to back up your
military might with deals and alliances,
and the instinct to know when to stab
your allies in the back just before they
plan to do it to you.
You only have two moves a year,
so you can't afford to  make any
mistakes in a game with secret orders
and simultaneous movement, conﬂict
and compromise. It's the odds that
make the game so intriguing - seven
players (at least one computer con-
trolled) and only one winner, but you
can't win on your own. It's this that
forces you into alliances with your
enemies and to  double cross your
friends.
The Games - Summer

E ight events form the latest in the
"Games"series of games that play
just as well on the PC as they do on
other machines. This time it's the turn
of the summer Olympic events that
weren't covered in Summer Games I
and II. including diving, 400 metres
hurdles (C64 owners only 100 metres),
velodrome cycling (that means it's
indoor), hammer throw, pole vault,
archery and the two tough gymnastic
events - the rings and the unparallel
bars.
Up to eight players can compete
for the gold, silver and bronze medals
in the latest of a series that seems to
have no end. This latest version, which
was released i n  the winter, boasts
improved 3D graphics to enhance the
already remarkable gameplay.

COMMODORE PC
N H , Challenge/Xot
Corporation
A  must f o r  fa n s o f  football
.American-style. This imported
game is perhaps the best simulation
of NFL Football to date. The program
contains actual statistics for all 28 NFL
teams, and a selection o f plays that
leaves other games on the bench.
NFL Challenge puts you ﬁrmly in
place as Head Coach and gives you
the chance to call all the plays, but
leaves the players to carry them out.
This gives you the chance to feel the
glory when long passes are caught for
touchdowns, and the misery when the
ball is turned over by a fumble.
You can play against either a
human or computer opponent, and
control all team selection and substi-
tution either for tactical reasons or to
ﬁll gaps left by injured players.
Whatever the call, the players line
up and carry out the plays decided by
their coaches, but only as representa-
tions (Os and Xs) on the screen.
Also from Xor - Update disks to keep
the teams stats up to date.
Battle Chess/Interplay
(Electronic Arts)
r r  ake a classic old game like chess
(and they don't come much older)
add some pretty graphics and anima-
tion and you've got a winner. It sounds
unlikely, b u t that's exactly what
happened when Interplay produced
Battle Chess, a software classic.
It's a  program well known to
Amiga owners, but is also available
for the PC. It plays an average game
of chess, but when one piece takes
another they ﬁght for the space with
some surprising results. For example,
the rooks turn into giant stone mons-
ters that pummel their opponents,
while the Queen has an impressive
array o f  magical powers, n o t to
mention a wonderfully feline walk!

to bring role-playing games to the
masses through combining the depth
and scope of a role-playing world with
the speed and reactions o f  arcade
games.
You begin the game in a tavern
knowing nothing of what lies ahead,
but soon you become immersed in a
quest to save the kingdom from hordes
of barbarians attacking from the south
and ores invading from the north. All
your actions are controlled by joystick
movement, icon selection and choos-
ing between phrases to control con-
versations - in this game you must talk
to people as well as killing monsters.
Your ﬁrst task takes you on a raid
to retrieve a magic item stolen by the
or i n  which you must ﬁght your way
through their guards and creep up on
the camp site before striking. It's the
need to organise your actions and the
enemies you face that sets this game
apart from all the other s o
arcade adventures.

Joan of Arc/Chip (US
Gold)
J garners who crave power, as i t
crowns you king of France. Your only
problem is that English forces and
their treacherous allies occupy half of
France. Your job is to turf them out
through skill on the battleﬁeld, sword-
play, diplomatic skills and regal
justice.
At your disposal you have generals
(your best is Joan) to take charge of
your armies, spies to  inﬁltrate and
assassinate your enemies, politicians to
talk to and deal with your adversaries,
provinces to tax to raise the money
to build armies, and executioners to
keep order and punish traitors.
The game uses action sequences to
determine the outcome of battles and
sieges. In these battles you use mouse,
joystick or keyboard control to scale
ladders, pour boiling oil on invaders,
challenge soldiers to duels and lead a
cavalry charge on a battleﬁeld.
Joan of Arc features some stunning
graphics, a  novel setting, a  good
strategy base and playable arcade
sequences that directly affect the
course o f  the game where money,
power, subterfuge, military might and
diplomacy are of equal importance.

Lance and PC Gold Hits (including

Wasteland/Interplay
(Electronic Arts)
r r  his was the surprise of 1988 when
it appeared on the CM in its 8 disk
sides format. Set in a post-holocaust
environment, you must patrol what's
left o f civilization as a Ranger and
battle with mutants and outlaws in a
very unfriendly world.
Part of the fun of this slick role-
playing game is to build up a party
armed with a  variety o f  weapons
(anything you can ﬁnd) and devise
COMMODORE PC
battle tactics to use their strengths and
protect their weaknesses. However,
that's not all - there are also puzzles
to solve, people to kill and mankind
(for what's left of it) to save.
Apart from saving the world and
taking out anything or anybody that
gets in your way, you must organise
raids on gang headquarters to rescue
kidnapped mayors, ﬁnd lost children
and rid farmers of the mutants that
plague them. I f  you do all this you
may be rewarded with some food,
weapons or even a new party member.
The game reﬂects The Bards Tale
style of role-playing, but it's nice to
ﬁght mutants for a change, instead of
the usual selection o f  ores and
zombies.

Hardware requirements
'The Commodore range of PCs is just
one of many so called IBM compat-
ibles. They're compatible because IBM
set the standard. However, it's a very
curious standard as there are two
different disk sizes, three different
processors, three different standard
memory conﬁgurations and four types
of graphics display! The result of all
this is that most games have a label
somewhere on them that says some-
thing like this:

It makes you wonder whether the
Kremlin has a PC!
The Stealth Fighter can  b e

aircraft carriers, and ﬂy missions
around America's favourite warzones
- that is, Libya, the Persian Gulf, the
North Cape and Central Europe.
Apart from the incredible attention to
detail and the pile of info and overlays
you are given to help you ﬂy the plane,
the game gives you a choice of screen
views that includes the usual cockpit
view, as well as TactiVue, which
displays you and the target on the
screen, SlotVue lets you see the plane
and the ﬂight path, but without the
gauges and TrakCam that magniﬁes
targets for a better view of the action.
There's a choice of promotions and

missions, so what more could you
want?

CIRCLES sprites can be used
as individual sequences; for example.
the growing circle animation, if run
backwards, will create the effect of a
pebble being dropped in water.
Alternatively, you can overlay one
sprite over the other; the two dials if
overlayed will produce a clock effect.
Another useful effect is to expand the
x axis of the sprite, which will give
the illusion of 3D.

$4000 instead of $0801_ Load in the
Basic loader and run it; if error free,
the program will automatically save
itself as a block of data. If you reload
that data in the future, remember to
add a I after the device number_ The

The sprites run from 160 to 223

lthough w e r e  one of the ﬁrst companies to start
producing computerised role-playing games, they
never really consolidated their initial advantage. To
date, only Pools of  Radiance, their ofﬁcially licensed
Dungeons and Dragons title, has been a  particularly
memorable game when compared with the likes of Bard's
Tale and the Ultima series.
It was interesting then to take a look at their latest
release, Demon's Winter, in order to see what steps they
had taken to improve their image. The game contains several
imaginative ideas and features not previously seen in
CRPG's, but unfortunately there are still sufﬁcient
presentational problems to make any potential buyers wary.
Playing the game, you soon come across several spelling
mistakes which, apart from being totally inexcusable, I
always feel augurs badly for the rest of the game. If you
can't be bothered to check your spelling, what chance
is there of the programming being 100 per cent perfect?
The hardest part of the game is actually getting started.
It's blatantly obvious that you'll need to back up the disks
(three sides) before you get anywhere, but it would have
been nice to be told that. Instructions for all other versions
contain this useful snippet of information, but not the C64
one. Again, you will need to have access to your own disk
copier. The Apple version includes its own, so why not
here?
As to the game itself, you are told precious little about
your ultimate goal. Your village has been razed to the ground
by marauding KoboIds, and you and your party go off
•
in search of revenge. You can't help suspecting, tho
that a Koh°Id is not going to be the most serious t
you come across, certainly in view of the game's title!
You can choose from one of  ﬁve different races,
including troll and dark elf, and each character can opt
to follow one of ten different professions. Depending on
how clever your character is, you can learn a variety of
skills. At the start of the game, you can only learn two
abilities. If you want any more, you have to ﬁnd a college
that is prepared to train you and pay the necessary fee.
Weapon skills are obviously a must, but you can also
choose to specialise in hunting, tactics and various types
of lore. If  you tend towards the arcane arts, then there
are a whole series of runes and chants that you can learn.
Spirit runes are recommended, as these give access to all
the healing spells for when one of your party gets injured
in battle. This idea of  using different skills brings
considerably more variety into the game than the traditional
approach, and means that you can usually overcome any
blunders that you made when you ﬁrst picked your party.
There are several different Gods and Shamans within
the game, and each character can select which one he prays
to. If  you need help in the course of a tricky battle or
whatever, then you can ask your deity to intervene on your
behalf. This is a basic 20 per cent chance which reduces
by 5 per cent each time you try, although you can top
up your standing by worshipping in the appropriate temple.
One interesting feature of the game is the unusual

properties possessed by some of the weapons. As well as
the usual combat bonuses, a sword might also have other
constant powers such as giving you a new skill or improving
an old one. Then there are powers which can be invoked,
that is you decide when you want to call on them. For
example, you may be able to call on a ﬂame shield twice
a day. Finally, the most powerful attributes are the dormant
ones, the ones that the weapon itself decides when to use,
including life stealing and berserking.
Demon's Winter follows the traditional hack and slash
storyline. There are mini-quests to be undertaken, but these
are let down somewhat by use of traps that kill off all
your party instantly, so remember to save your game
frequently. Control of the game is fairly straightforward,
apart from the magic system which requires all spell names
to be typed in full. Whatever happened to menus or
abbreviations?
1 started off convinced that 1 was not going to like
Demon's Winter, but it soon grew on me, and I quickly
became hooked. But all the time, the doubts nagged away.
Why didn't they do this, or wouldn't it have been better
to do it this way. In the end 1 decided that it was a good
game, but with a bit more care it could have been a very
good game.

the excitement of the real thing. Here is your chance
to lose pretend Monopoly money at four different
games - roulette, black jack, baccarat and crap.
Starting with only 250 pounds, can you break the bank?
Frankly, who cares? Certainly, there is no legitimate waN,
it can be done in real life and just to make doubly sure,
the program cheats, or at least does not use casino rules.
Take Black Jack for example. Now if you are a good
gambler, this is the game that you stand to make most
money at. For every pound that you invest, you should
be able to get 99 pence back. The way to win (or not lose
as much), is to know when to make favourable bets and
when to stick and twist. This can be done because you
know that the dealer must twist on 16 and stick on 17.
In this version, the program sticks as soon as it has
got a better hand than yours, so all thoughts of tactical
betting go out of the window. OK, so you might get lucky
in the short term, but the odds over a period of time are
totally stacked against you.
Poor graphics and control, especially on the roulette
wheel, only heighten the mind-blowing numbness of this
game. When will program authors realise that gambling
when there is nothing at stake is utterly pointless? Save
your money or, i f you must blow three quid, put it on
the 3.30 at Ascot. A t least there'll he some momentary
excitement, even if your horse does come in last.

mad as 1 tried to survive a gruelling 1500 metres
race in a Decathlon game. Surprise, surprise, the
same idea has resurfaced again. Oh to be sure, the game
looks superﬁcially different. The backdrop here is a
Parachute regiment assault course rather than an athletics
stadium, but at the end o f the day, joystick waggling is
what it is all about.
There are four different courses for you to attempt, each
containing a variety of obstacles. There are walls to be
climbed, and pools of water to be leapt.. There are ramps
and rope swings, tunnels and death slides and all the time,
you are competing against the clock.

Clearing an obstacle is very much a case of precise timing,
nd my feeling was that the limits set by the program were
st a little too tight. Too often I  was not pixel perfect
ough and went crashing into whatever it was I was trying
YOUR COMMODORE july 1989

to clear. At a time when the news has just broken about
nuclear fusion, there is a new energy force at work here.
Run into the wall from a distance of one yard, and bounce
back three!
Each course can be previewed and practised before you
attempt the real thing, although killing you for falling off
the death slide does seem a triﬂe harsh. Fair enough when
you're trying the course proper, but surely not in practice
mode.
1 didn't enjoy thisgame at all. Yes, I know it's a version
of certain full price games currently available, and this will
obviously tempt people to buy it, but it seems to be lacking
one vital ingredient - fun. And that after all, is what games
are all about.

ead fo r Home was written
using the technique of joining
ML Data onto the end of a
basic program. A  few zero bytes
separate each section and prevent the
ML from being displayed with Basic's
LIST command.
There are two very good reasons
for doing this: ﬁrstly, it, saves con-
siderable room. Head for Home would
not have ﬁtted into the C-16's memory
otherwise, and it's faster running, with
no waiting for FOR NEXT loops to
poke data into memory.
However, there is one disadvantage
- Basic programs can't be edited or
altered. This changes the number of
bytes used, and causes the ML routines
to be at a different address to that
intended, The only exception is where
the change doesn't affect the length of
a program a s  in changing DLOAD
to LOAD. Both commands are toke-
nised and use one byte.
Unfortunately, Head for Home's
machine language wasn't spotted by
us at the magazine and was published
as two basic program (YC March,
1989).
Now comes the task of adding the
ML to both programs...
After typing in the basic sections,
you must check that no extra spaces
or Rems have extended the programs
to where the M L  is to go. Load the
ﬁrst program in and, in direct mode,
enter:
PRINTPEEK (45) +256* PEEK (46)
The answer must be less than 4450.
Likewise, the result for the second
program should be less than 9528. If
not, remove anything from the pro-
grams that is not in the listing.
The M L  data could be entered

directly into the monitor, but there's
a lot of typing required with no means
of error checking. D A TA  ENTRY
may help a little here by speeding up
input and alerting you to errors.
Type in and run the program - it
will ﬁrst ask you for a starting address.
Enter the line number from the listing
e.g. to begin with it would be 1164.
You will need to keep track of where
you're up to i f you type in the data
over several sittings.
When a line is typed in the program
will generate a checksum which you
can check against the listing. Press
RETURN only i f it matches -  any
other key allows you to re-type the line.
To Exit from DATA ENTRY -
press ESC twice and then enter the
monitor to save your work.
FOR M L I uses: S "name", 8, 1164,
1 404
and ML2: - S"name", 8, 2538, 3630
To continue later on, LOAD "name",
8,1 then NEW, DLOAD "Hex Entry"
YOUR COMMODORE july 1989

and RUN. (If using tape substitute "I "
for "8
If you lose track of where you are,
or for any reason want to check what
has been entered, then simply use the
"M" command from within Tedmon.
The line addresses and each row of
bytes will correspond I to I with the
listing. You could use the - r  command
to ﬁll memory with a known value to
indicate where data has or hasn't been
entered.
Once both M L  sections are ﬁn-
ished, (MU  should be 3 disk blocks,
and ML2 18 blocks), the method for
merging them with the Basic programs
is as follows:
(1) DLOAD "Head for Home" in the
normal manner.
(2) RENAME  "Head for Home" TO
"H FH.old"
(3) LOAD "ml I",8,1
(4) DSAVE "Head for Home"
(5) DLOAD "L. BASIC"

I
developed a routine which allows
us to declare labels for GOTOs and
GOSUBs in Basic. We did this with
a routine that stores each label and
its value in the Basic variable area
which follows directly after the Basic
textﬁle.
But with this method we are subject
to the limitations Commodore Basic
imposes on the use of variables, the
main one being that only the ﬁrst two
characters of a variable name are taken
into account - the rest are ignored.
What we want to do is overcome
this limitation by creating our own
symbol table. In the process we will
learn about several concepts i n
machine code programming which will
be very useful in whatever program-
ming you want to do.
The Symbol Table
The symbol table we want to create
is an area in memory where we store
each label, and next to  i t the line.
number to which the computer has to
jump when the label is used with a
GOTO or GOSUB instruction.
In machine code programming,
you create many tables. A table is an
array of data where each entry is of
the same length. Tables are useful for
storing data and accessing it quickly
and efﬁciently. For the symbol table
we create i n  our program, I  have
chosen a memory area starting from
location 50000 (you may of course put
the symbol table anywhere you like).
Thus, 50000 is the base address of our
symbol table.
To make each entry the same
length, I've chosen a maximum of six
recognizable characters for each label.
That is, i f a label is longer than six
characters, the rest will be ignored, and
if it's shorter than six characters, the
difference will be ﬁlled (or "padded")
with zeros in the symbol table, as you
will see in a minute.
Since we also want to store the line
number belonging to each label next
to the label, each entry needs an

Extending Basic
Create your own-symbol table, and learn all about
tables and search routines
By Burghard-Henry Lehmann
additional two bytes -- one byte to store
the low byte of the line number, and
one byte to store its high byte. This
becomes important lithe line number
is larger than 256.
In all, we use eight bytes for each
label stored i n  the symbol table.
Therefore, to point at the beginning
of a  label, we increment the base
address o f the table in multiples of
eight. And if you call the base address
of the table position 0, then the offsets
for the ﬁrst four entries, for example,
on the table are 0, 8, 16 and 24.
Now you should understand why
it is important that each entry on a
table is the same length. If the com-
puter has to  search the table from
beginning to end, i t can very easily
jump from entry to entry simply by
adding the length o f  the entry to
pointer address. And if it has to jump
to a speciﬁc entry straight away, it can
do so by adding the offset of that entry
to the base address of the table.
Storing a Label
The routine to store each label in the
symbol table (lines 2910-3450) is quite
simple: before the computer starts
searching through the Basic program
for all the labels, the base address of
the symbol table, which is 50000, is
initiated to zero page 251/ 252 (line
2300-233). This allows us to  use
indirect indexed addressing later on.
When a label has been found, zero
page $7A/7B is pointing at the begin-
ning of the label in the Basic textﬁle.
STORELOOP (line 2930-2990) stores
each letter of the label in the symbol
table, u s i n g  i n d i re ct i n d e xe d
addressing.
If the label is shorter than six
characters, the following loop (line
3060-3100) ﬁlls the rest with spaces.
Next the line number belonging to the
label is stored. To do this we increment
zero page 251/252, which stores the
pointer to the symbol table, by six
(lines 3140-3190).
Now we come up against a little
YOUR COMMODORE july 1989
52
difﬁculty: we have to use indirect-Y
addressing fo r the source and the
destination, but Y  has to contain a
different value. To point at the source,
it has to contain two and three, while
to point at the destination it has to
contain zero and one.
To solve this problem, table the low
byte of the line number ﬁrst and push
it onto the stack (lines 3230-3250).
Then get the high byte, change the
index to one and store it in the symbol
table (lines 3260-3290).
Lastly, decrement that index by
one, pull the low byte o f the line
number from the stack, and store it
in the correct place in the symbol table
(lines 3300-3320). Such tricks are
necessary to  overcome the lack o f
registers the 6510 has got! (Remember,
we can't use the X-register here,
because X can only be used to index
absolute addresses!)
Finally, increment the symbol table
pointer address by another two bytes
to make it point at the location where
the next label has to be entered.
End Marker
When all labels have been collected
and entered into the symbol table,
enter a 7ero in the symbol table, where
the beginning of the next label would
have been (lines 2660-2680).
This is important, because when
the computer has to search for a label,
it has to know where the end of the
symbol table is. Because, if it reaches
the end of the symbol table, that means
that it hasn't found the label and that
the search is ﬁnished. If there was no
way to determine the end of the symbol
table, the computer would go on
searching for ever t h a t  is, it would
get lost in an endless loop!
To signify the end of a table, it is
sometimes useful to use an end marker
as we do here. At other times it is more
useful to store the end location or the
beginning of the last entry in a variable.
You have to decide which method is
best according to what suits you in the
speciﬁc routine you are writing.

Searching for a Label
When executing the Basic program
itself every time the computer meets
a label after a  GOTO o r GOSUB
command, it has to search through the
symbol table to ﬁnd that label and get
the line number next to it which i t
needs to jump to the right destination.
In order to write a search routine
you have to ask yourself some very
important questions: when i s the
search successful, and when is it not?
This sounds trivial and obvious, but
remember, the computer is a  very
simple-minded animal and knows
nothing about what you have in mind!
So you have to  deﬁne things very
accurately. This is half the art o f
programming a computer.
The search for a label is successful
when all the six recognized characters
of a label in the textﬁle match with
the characters of a label in the symbol
table. And the search is unsuccessful
when the computer has reached the
end o f the symbol table and hasn't
found the label it was searching for.
Once we've got this clearly in our
mind, the construction of the search
routine itself is not too difﬁcult. The
main search loop (lines 1400-1470)
compares each character of the label
in the textﬁle with each character of
a particular entry in the symbol table.
It has three exits;
Exit number one is taken if the end
of the label in the textﬁle has been
reached. This is signiﬁed by a zero (if
we make the rule that a label has to
be at the end of a Basic line and that
nothing else, including remarks, i s
allowed after it). If this point has been
reached i t means that the label has
been found, even though, if you want
to be a perfectionist, you might want
to make this routine more accurate and
versatile. You can do this by setting
up additional tests if the label is not
at the end of a line, and i f the label
in the textﬁle is shorter than the label
in the symbol table.
The second exit of the main loop
is taken when any letter in the textﬁle
does not compare with a letter in the
symbol table. This does not necessarily
mean that the search is unsuccessful
at this point. If the label is shorter than
six characters, it could mean that it
has been found! So lines 1530-1540 test
if the next byte in the symbol table
contains a zero, If yes, the label has
indeed been found. If not, the search
has been unsuccessful up to this point.
The third exit is taken after all six
recognized characters have been com-
pared and found matching. This means

of course that the label has been found.
Now the line number after the label
is gathered in zero page $14/ 15 (lines
1790-1840), and then the GOTO
routine is executed (line 1880).
If the label so far has not been
found, lines 1590-1650 increment the
pointer to the symbol table contained
in zero page 251/252 by eight, so that
it points at the beginning of the next
label. Then a test is made to see if the

Windows on the C64
T
facilities you'll need to create a
window environment for your
Basic programs. These routines can
also be used by means of SYS calls
typed i n  from the keyboard. They
allow you to specify the size and shape
of the windows you require.
When a window is invoked, all the
normal screen editing functions are
available, but they only operate on the
area of the window you have speciﬁed.
When that window is 'pushed back',
the original screen is restored. Up to
four windows may be deﬁned, and
each may be 'pulled down' in whatever
order you determine.
The deﬁnition o f  a  window
includes its position on the screen, but
when 'pulled down', i t  ma y be
'dragged' to another position, and i t
then becomes the new location for that
window in subsequent operations.
The areas used by the system are
$C000 to $C830 for the machine code,
and the screen data is saved under the
Basic RAM at $A000 to SUFF. The
locations SH to SET are used for the
parameters of the current window, and
C64 PROGRAM
Using windows on your C64 couldn't be easier!
By F.E. Randall
must not be disturbed whilst the
window is 'pulled down' otherwise the
system may crash. The original values
in these locations are saved each time
a window is 'pulled down', and res-
tored when the last window is 'pushed
back'.
To achieve the usual screen editing
functions whilst only operating on the
area o f  the window, the system
includes rewritten parts of the Kernal
routines C H R IN  and CHROUT.
When a window is extant, the vectors
at $0324 and $0326 are changed to
$C300 and SC000 respectively. Press-
ing runstop/ restore will reset these
vectors if you run into difﬁculties.
How to Use the System
To use the system, you ﬁrst have to
initialise it by SYS 50176. That call
should also be used if there has been
an error message, since the parameters
can be in an indeterminate state after
such an event. More about the error
messages later.
After initialisation the windows
have to be deﬁned by SYS 50179, a,

b, c, d, e where:-
a t h e  window serial number from
I to  4. This number is used to pull
down the window later.
b th e  number of the row on the screen
where the top left and corner of the
window is to appear.
c -7- the number of the line on which
the top left hand corner is to appear.
d =  th e  width o f  the screen i n
characters.
e t h e  number of lines, ie the depth
of the window.
The window must be a minimum
of three characters wide and three lines
deep, and the starting row and line plus
the width and depth must not exceed
39 and 24 respectively, since these are
dictated by the screen's dimensions. In
practice, you'll want to leave • ample
room for any Basic commands you
wish to enter from the window.
This brings me to the one exception
to the normal screen editing facilities
which the system imposes. Normally
there is wrap around on input so that
each line may be up to g0 characters

long. In this system the input line is
restricted in length to the width of the
window you specify. You must make
allowances for this when setting the
parameters.
The deﬁnition o f  windows will
probably come i n  the initialisation
procedures of your program. If you're
going to use them to display preset
messages, you will probably also want
to set up the displays in the initial-
isation by 'pulling down* the window,
PR INTing the text, then 'pushing
back' the window. 'Pulling down' is
achieved by SYS 50182,a where 'a' is
the window number as used in the
deﬁnition. SYS 50185 will 'push back'
the window.
Windows can be redeﬁned without
reinitialising the system, but once
redeﬁned, the original contents of the
window will be lost. Furthermore, i f
redeﬁnition takes place too frequently,
you may run out of space in which
to store the contents of the windows.
Better to use the same window for
diffecent purposes, and clear i t by
PRINTing "cis" each time.

Dragging Windows
Having 'pulled down' a window, you
may drag it round the screen using the
following commands:-
up
down
left
right
- SYS 50191
- SYS - 50188
SYS 50894
- SYS 50197
C64 PRO G RAM
To drag the window from your
Basic program, you would probably
want to  test for the pressing o f a
particular function key and then use
the appropriate SYS call. For more
ﬂexibility, machine code buffs could
'wedge' code into the interrupt routhie
to check whether a function key is
pressed and i f  so, call the relevant
subroutine listed above.
Error Messages
The system generates error messages
as shown below to help in debugging
your program. The conditions are
mostly related to the use of incorrect
parameters.
Since the system may be left in an
indeterminate state when the error is
detected, after displaying the message,
the system waits for a key to be pressed
before carrying out a warm start. It's
always best to  initialise the system
again after such an occurrence.
The exceptions to  this are the
absence of parameters following the
SYS commands, as this is picked up
by the Basic interpreter and results in
a SYNTAX ERROR message.
The message displayed will take the
form 'ERROR -' followed by a letter.
The signiﬁcances of the letters are as
follows:
a -  an attempt made to 'pull down'
a window before it has been deﬁned.
b a n  attempt made to 'pull down'
YOUR COMMODORE july 1989
56
more than four windows or the same
window.
c - when deﬁning a window either the
start row plus width exceed 39; or the
start line plus length exceed 24; or there
is no more space to store the window
contents.
d i n  a window deﬁnition, the window
number is not in the range one to four.
e - when 'pulling down' a window, the
window number is not in the range
one to four.
in a deﬁnition, the window width
or length is less than three.
Demonstration Program
Included on the disk is a demonstra-
tion program introducing the use of
windows. Load and run WINDOWS
DEMO. To use the machine code in
your own program, type L OA D
"WINDOWS MC", 8, I then NEW.
The demonstration gives you the
choice o f  'pulling down' windows
containing instructions on how to use
the system; using a window to view
the directory o f a disk; deﬁning a
window of your own; or 'pulling'd own'
one o f  the windows used i n  the
program. The latter uses window
number two, so if you try to 'pull down'
that window, you will get 'ERROR
B'
If you study the listing o f the
demonstration program, I'm sure you
will soon ﬁnd all is made clear. You
may also wish to  incorporate the
directory listing routine in some o f
your programs. Happy windowing!

Star LC10 C Colour

E
ver since I purchased my ﬁrst
computer system, some four
and a half years ago, I  have,
always understood the importance of
having a printer. Even in those early
days as a complete novice, I could see
the importance of being able to get
hard copies of any important work
done, be i t listings o f  your latest
masterpiece, print-outs of your ﬁnan-
ces, or simply letters.
The ﬁrst printer I bought was the
MPS801, and at the time it seemed
like a good buy. I was able to get print-
outs o f virtually anything I  desired
with relative ease. True, the ﬁnished
result was not spectacular, but it was
something -  better than my hand-
writing, I can assure you. However,
when I looked around at my friends'
listings, lists and letters, I was some-
what miffed to  discover that m y
humble 801 was perhaps not quite as
good as I had ﬁrst thought.
Not to be outdone, I traded in the
801 and upgraded to the 802. Ah, what
bliss! This printer had a far superior
ﬁnish to it. Alright, so it is a lot larger
and heavier, but what an improvement

in the type! The speed was also better,
and to add to all this, it was a  lot
quieter. To some extent,
it was
also
a lot
easier
to use. Of
course, you
can't print out
graphics on it,
but then again, I
thought, I never
want to do that
anyway. (1 never
could see the sense in
ruining your print head
in order to get a print-
out of a graphics screen.)

We put the LC10-C under
the microscope
By Paul Eves
Shortly after this, I began review-
ing programs for Your Commodore.
Yes, you've guessed it, suddenly the
need for graphics printing became only
too clear. Back went the 802, and I
said hello once again to the 801.
Since those early days, I have used
many different printers. These
machines, like Assemblers, come in all
sorts o f formats. Some will do one
thing, others will do another. It's not
often you ﬁnd a printer that will do
EVERYTHING you personally want
it to do. That is to say, until 14 months
ago, when I discovered the LC10-C.
For my money this has got to be one
of the best home-use printers I've ever
come across. So what makes this
printer stand out above the rest?
Well, it's a compact, convenient,
colour dot-matric printer.
It's fully compatible
with the

C 128 and CM, it supports the Com-
modore graphics and business charac-
ter sets, (Standard and DIN versions),
and you can also swap to  ASCII
operating mode.
On top of all this, you have access
to no less than ten international
character sets. For those of you who
like colourful displays and print-outs,
you have a six colour print option.
Operating the printer is simplicity
itself. You are provided with a clear,
easy to read front panel, and from this
panel a multitude of operations can
be performed.
Apart from the obvious function
of switching power on or off, these are
the other functions available:
The type style can be selected along
with the type pitch. Left and right
margins can be set up along with
setting the top of paper, and paper can
be fed automatically with micro-feed
if needed (forward or reverse). Pause
printing and the printing o f  test
patterns are both possible.
You can also prevent software
from altering your pitch and style
settings. One other function, which I
think is a  boon to  machine code
programmers, is the facility for
printing a Hex dump.
This is
- e a
so that
you can check
that the codes the printer
is receiving are correct.
Five type styles are catered for, all
of which can be used in italics (one
draft and Four NLQ). There are then
four different print pitches for each.
REVIEW
On top of this, you can have Enhance
Underlined, Superscript, Subscript,
Bold, Double sized and Quadruple
sized printing. The printer also prints
standard eight-bit graphics and
Commodore seven-bit graphics.
You can use up to triple-ply multi-
copy forms, normal fanfold forms
or single sheets. An extra feature
is the ability to park fanfold
paper, whilst you are using
others. Of course, you
don't have to take my
word for all this
- at the end of
this review
see
some
sample printouts.
All these printouts were
executed from within simple Basic
programs. I think you'll agree that the
ﬁnished results are quite impressive
(especially for a humble home-user
printer).
As well as everything else I've said,
the supporting manual is well laid out,
informative and easy to understand.

But I don't want you to think that
I have no criticisms at all, because I
have. All this Hi-Tech equipment is
somewhat delicate. I had great trouble
for some time getting it to respond to
colour commands, both from within
software and by direct use, I just could
not understand what the problem was
(the test patterns proved OK).
Eventually I hit on the problem.
My ribbon had by this time become
faint on Black and Blue. For some
reason this interfered with the oper-
ation of the rest of the ribbon. On
purchasing a new ribbon, the problem
disappeared. It would be better if this
could be overcome, but I think that
this is a small price to pay considering
the advantages the machine has.
In the ﬁnal analysis, I would highly
recommend this printer. I know there
must be better ones around, the 24 pin
type for example, But for all-round
versatility, it is hard to beat.
Final Word
The printer that was reviewed here is
the Commodore Serial Interfaced
Version. There is a Centronics Version
that's compatible with Epsom and
IBM printers. Therefore this version
is suitable with the Amiga and any
other computer that supports these
printers.

Spritz Sprite
System
A
cise Oxford Dictionary is, "An
Elf, Fairy o r  Hobgoblin."
Hmmtn... Maybe, but perhaps the
deﬁnition should extend to  include
Cars, Planes, Pacmen, Invaders from
Space and (just for Jeff Minter) Sheep,
Camels and Llamas.
In fact, in computer terms, a sprite
is any piece o f  computer graphics
which plays an active part in a game.
Sadly, the Plus/ 4 does not have any,
a fact which has been long lamented
by the machine's owners who have to
bear the ridicule of C64 owners, whose
machines are endowed with hard-
ware—controlled sprites.
Spritz sets out to put the balance
right by providing your Plus/4 com-
puter with a  comprehensive Sprite
System, giving not one, not two, but
eight independant, full colour sprites
which can be controlled very simply
through 19 new commands. These
commands are added to the standard
Commodore Basic language - no need
for those engless pokes for which the
C64 has become infamous!
The Theory Of Sprites
Sprites form the heart of the majority
of today's computer games, and are
found in abundance on every compu-
ter, from the humble C16 to the mighty
CBM Amiga. A  sprite is a graphic
element or picture which can be placed
on the screen and moved quickly and
smoothly about with the minimum of
trouble.
On the Plus/4, the text screen is
If you are fed up not having sprites on your Plus! 4,
read on
By Mark Everingham
used for sprites because of the speed
and ease of use this screen offers. When
a sprite is displayed, the computer
automatically remembers what was
under the sprite before it was printed.
To move the sprite you simply change
its coordinate position, the computer
acknowledges that the sprite has been
moved, replaces what was underneath,
moves i t to  the new position and
reprints i t. SPRITZ will detect a
collision between a sprite and some-
thing else. Sprites can even be printed
below or above foreground graphics.
In addition to  these features,
SPRITZ also has a facility for selec-
tive priority printing, a  feature not
found on either the C M  o r C  128.
SPRITZ handles this complicated pro-
cess in about 20 milliseconds under the
control of an interrupt.
If it all sounds a little technical,
remember, all you have to do is to tell
the computer where to move a sprite,
everything else is completely automatic
and transparent to the user.
Using The Spritz Commands
SPRITZ adds 19 new commands to
basic which makes the control of the
sprites simplicity itself, without a
POKE in sight. These commands act
in exactly the same way as the normal
Commodore Basic commands. Every
parameter can be expressed either as
direct numbers or variables. Standard
error messages are given which can,
if required, be intercepted i n  Basic
using t h e  Commodore T R A P
command.
YOUR COMMODORE july 1989
62
The error messages SPRITZ gives
are explained below:
?SYNTAX Error -  You have either,
used a  command o r  keyword that
neither SPRITZ or CBM Basic under-
stands, or you have entered too few
or too many parameters following a
command.
?Type Mismatch Error -  you have
replaced a numeric parameter with a
string.
?Illegal Quantity Error One  number
you have used as a command parame-
ter is outside the valid range for that
particular command.
As well as these error messages, the
Basic HELP command (Key F8), also
works with SPRITZ commands. I f
you enter something like:-
DEFINE 255, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
when there should only be the num-
bers 1-8 the HELP command will
make all of the line from the ﬁnal '9'
ﬂash to indicate where the error lies.
Similarly, if you typed something
like:-
SCROLLING RULES OK
The phrase 'RULES OK' would be
ﬂashing as the valid argument for the
SCROLLING command is either ON
or OFF. This feature o f the HELP
command with SPRITZ makes the
location of errors extremely easy.

SPRITZ Set-Up
Commands
RAMFONS SAAAA/AAAA
For the most part, you will want your
sprites to be made up of user-deﬁned
graphic characters, aliens, spacecraft
etc. You tell SPRITZ that you want
to use a character set or Font in RAM
instead of ROM with the RAMFONT
command. Its sole parameter is the
address where the character set is
stored. This can be expressed either
in decimal, or hexadecimal preceded
with a 'S• character. SPRITZ also uses
and interrupt to retain a character set,
so when you generate an error message
the computer will not go wild as it
usually does!
Examples:
RAMFONT $3000
10 RAMFONT 49152
CBMFONT
However attractive a redeﬁned char-
acter set is, it can be difﬁcult to edit
a program when all the colons appear
as mushrooms or the numbers 0-9 as
various sections of a centipede's body!
To get your computer back to the
normal Commodore font, just enter
CBMFONT.
Examples:
CBMFONT
10CBMFONT
FONTCOPY 0/1
Most people ﬁnd that they only want
to redeﬁne part of a character set as
user deﬁned graphics, and still want
the usual alphanumeric characters.
The answer is to copy the normal CBM
character set down into RAM and then
redeﬁne the characters you want. The
FONTCOPY command copies a char-
acter set into R A M . Either into
UPPER case font (FONICOPY 0) or
the lower case font (FONTCOPY 1).
The command must be preceded by
a R A MPON T command t o tell
SPRITZ where to put the new char-
acter set.
Examples:
RAM FONT $3000:FONTCOPY 0
10 RAMFONT 49152:FONTCOPY I
DEFINE Char, DO, DI, D2, D3, D4,
D5, D6, D7
Once you have copied a standard font
P L US 4  P R O G R A M
into RAM, you will probably want to
redeﬁne some of the characters to form
graphics with which to build sprites
or displays. Usually, this would be
done using a series of DATA state-
ments and POKES. These are replaced
with one command i n  SPRITZ,
DEFINE.
The DEFINE command takes nine
parameters in the range 0-255. The ﬁrst
is the character number, and the 8 that
follow are the data bytes which make
up the character.
Note, the character number is not
ASCII, as in CHRS(c), but a screen
code. The relevant code fo r each
character can be found on Page 192
of your computer manual.
See also the section in the SPRITZ
SCR N function.
Example:
10 RAMFONT $300: FONICOPY 0
20 DEFINE 0, 170, 85, 170, 85, 170,
85, 170, 85
30 PRINT "@@@@@@.@@@@"
HARDRVS and SOFTRVS
A character set can contain either 128
characters and use the RVS ON/OFF
function, or 256 characters with no
hardware reversing. I f  you need the
extra characters, entering SOFTRVS
does this, w i th  reversing being
handled b y  software i f  required.
HARDRVS selects the fewer 128
characters, but with RVS ON/OFF
being handled by hardware.
Examples:
HARDRVS: PRINT "ABCD
[RVSON] ABCD"
SOFTRVS: PRINT "ABCD
[RVSON] ABCD"

HIRES and MULTI
The Plus/ 4 computer has several
modes, the most important of which
are High-resolution and Multi-colour.
The HIRES and MULTI commands
switch between the two. HIRES mode
is usually in operation. MULTI mode,
which is used in quite a number o f
arcade games, halves the horizontal
resolution but allows each pixel to be
one of four different colours.
Examples:
HIRES: PRINT "[ORNG1 SPRITZ"
MULTI: PRINT IORNG1 SPRITZ"
SPRITZ Sprite
Commands
SPRITE SP, CHO, CHI, CH2, CH3,
CO, LO, Cl, LI, C2, L2, C3, L3
Each sprite under SPRITZ control is
made up of four characters displayed
on the Plus/4 low-resolution screen.
These characters are arranged in a
square o f 2*2 characters, and each
character can be an individual colour.
Reverse or normal characters can be
used to make up a sprite, and each
colour can be one of the Plus/4's full
121. The SPRITE command is used
to tell SPRITZ which characters and
colours are to be used to make up a
sprite. The parameters it requires are:
SP - Sprite number (0-7)
CHO - Top left char code (0— 255)
CH1 - Top right char code (0-255)
CH2 - Bottom left char code (0-255)
CH3 Bottom left char code (0-255)
Cn - Colour for that quarter (1-16)
Ln Luminance for that quarter (0—
7)

As you can see, the characters are
speciﬁed not as ASCII but as screen
codes, as for the DEFINE command.
The reason for this is that using ASCII,
reverse characters are not evaluated.
To specilly a reverse character using
the character code you simply add 128
to the original value. Again, the
relevant values can be found on page
192 o f your manual, also refer the
SPRITZ SCRN function.
Colours are represented using the
colour and luminance values that you
would use in a COLOR command to
represent all 121 colours. These are
entered i n  the same order as the
character codes for each quarter of the
sprite. Each sprite is numbered 0-7 for
each of the eight available.

When SPRITZ is ﬁrst used, each sprite
is set up as characters 96-127 (the last
in a character set), with each character
being black. The characters in each
sprite are arranged thus:-
FOREGROUND CH and MODE
OVER/UNDER/SELECT
As mentioned before, each sprite can
be displayed either above or behind
foreground graphics, or with selective
priority. If a sprite is OVER it appears
on top o f anything printed on the
screen. If a sprite is UNDER then it
appears behind everything except a
space character on the screen. When
using SELECTive priority, a sprite can
made to  appear i n  front o f  some
characters and below others so that
you could, fo r example, make a
helicopter move between tower blocks
PL US4 P R O G R A M
or weave in and out in a pattern. You
can make each sprite behave in any
one of the three ways, so you could
have a  helicopter moving between
buildings, clouds moving behind, and
a gunsight in front.
The MODE command is used to
specify how a sprite is displayed on
the screen. It takes two parameters:
The ﬁrst SP is the sprite number in
the range o f  0-7, and the second
parameter should be one of OVER,
UNDER o r SELECT as explained
above.
The MODE of a sprite should be
chosen before a  sprite i s  ﬁr s t
ENABLE&
When you ﬁrst use SPRITZ, all
sprites are set to OVER.
Examples:
FOR N O TO 7:MODE N, UNDER:
NEXT N
10 MODE 0, SELECT
When using SELECT mode you have
to tell SPR ITZ which characters
should be considered as foreground
and which as background. The com-
mand to do this is FOREGROUND.
Its single parameter in the range 0-255
is the character to be used as fore-
ground. To clarify this, the examples
below show the result of each value:
Examples:
FOREGROUND 128 -  All reversed
characters are foreground and all
others background.
FOREGROUND 65 Every character
with a code of 65-225 is foreground
and every other in the range 0-64 is
background.
Note that even with a command
like FOREGROUND 30, setting every
character with a  code over 29 as
foreground, the space character, (code
32), i s logically still treated a s
background.
ENABLE SP/DISABLE SP
Once you have set up the sprites
you wish to use, the ENABLE corn-
YOUR COMMODORE july 1989
64
mand is used to switch them on. The
command takes only one parameter,
the sprite number in the range 0-7.
Once enabled, the sprite stays on the
screen continuously. Even if you clear
the screen, the sprite is reprinted in
its original position. This means that
you could use one routine to scroll a
background and another to control the
sprite, and the routines don't need to
take any notice of each other!
Once you have ﬁnished using any
sprites you can switch them off using
the DISABLE command with the
sprite number as its argument. Note
that when using a  large number o f
sprites in the Basic direct mode, there
can be considerable losses in speed of
keyboard auto-repeat as the computer
is doing a lot more work than usual
on its interrupt. Thus, it is a good idea
to switch sprites off when leaving a
program to improve the auto-repeat
speed. The internal clock will inevit-
ably run slightly slower than normal
when SPRITZ is maintaining many
sprites.
Examples:
ENABLE 1:ENABLE 2:DISABLE 4
10 FOR S
MOVE SP TO TX, TY
Obviously you need to be able to move
sprites around the screen. The MOVE
command is the primary way of doing
this. Th e  command takes three
parameters: the sprite number SP in
the range 0-7, and the coordinates to
which the sprite should be moved. The
destination coordinates should be
seperated from the sprite number using
TO as for the Commodore DRAW
command. Coordinates should be
separated using a comma like all'other
SPRITZ commands. T h e  X -
coordinate should be in the range 0-
38 and the Y-coordinate in the range
0-23. When you use a MOVE com-
mand w i th  th a t sprite enabled,
SPRITZ automatically removes the
sprite from the screen and reprints it
in the new position leaving the screen
intact. The MOVE command can also
be used when a sprite is not enabled
in order to  move i t to  its initial

position. When you ﬁrst use SPRITZ.
the sprites are arranged in a row in
the top left of the screen.
Examples:
X=10:Y=10:MOVE I  T O  X ,  Y :
ENABLE I
SHIFT SP SLEFT/SRIGHT/SUP/
SDOWN and SHIFT SP,DIR
Usually you will want to move a sprite
one character at a time, and the SHIFT
command can be used to do just this.
It will move any sprite one character
Left, Right, tip or Down. If a sprite
goes off an edge of the screen, it
reappears at the opposite side. Moving
off the screen to the right makes the
sprite reappear on the left. The SHIFT
command has two possible syntaxes.
Both take their ﬁrst parameter, the
sprite number, in the range 0-7:
Following the sprite number is the
direction in which the sprite is to be
moved. If  the direction is expressed
as a number, it should be preceded by
a comma. The effect of each of the
possible arguments are as follows:
NUMERIC WOR D  DIRECTION
0 S L E E T  L E F T
SRIGHT R I G H T
2 
S
U
P
 
U
P
3 S D O W N  D O W N
Note that when you specify the
direction in English as a single word,
the word should be preceded by 'S'.
This is to avoid clashes with the
BASIC functions L E F T S  a n d
RIGHTS.
Examples:
ENABLE 0 :  D O :  S H I F T  0
SPRIGHT: SHIFT 0 DOWN: LOOP
ENABNLE 0: DO : D R N D  (1)*4:
SHIFT 0,D: LOOP
SPRITZ UTILITY
COMMANDS
SCROLLING ON/OFF
One of the problems implementing
sprites using software is that whenever
a program or entry in direct mode
causes the screen to scroll up, the
sprites will also scroll, leaving an image
above them. Usually this will not be
a problem when programming, but if
you wish to print on the bottom line
of the screen while sprites are enabled,
it can be useful to disable the screen
P L U S 4  P R O G R A M
scrolling effect. To do this just type
SCROLLING OFF or to re-enable it,
type SCROLLING ON.
When scrolling is disabled, i f the
cursor, is pushed off the bottom line
of the screen, instead of scrolling the
screen up, it just reappears at the top
of the screen. The SCROLLING
command is the equivalent of the ESC
*M' and ESC 'L' sequences.
Examples:
SCROLLING ON :  EN A B LE 0 :
CHARL 39, 24, "*"
SCREEN SUP/SDOWN
Sometimes you may want to scroll the
screen up or down but leave the sprites
you h a ve  enabled i n ta ct. T h e
SCREEN command will do just this.
SCREEN works by ﬁrst removing
all the sprites from the screen, scrolling
the screen either up or down, and then
reprinting all the sprites previously
enabled, When using many sprites this
inevitably causes some screen ﬂicker
so it is not really recommended for
rapid use. However, i t can be very
useful when editing programs o r
implementing an asteroids type effect.
SCREEN SUP scrolls the screen up
and SCREEN SDOWN scrolls it
down. Each scrolling it one line in each
direction. Note that if  you have a
window speciﬁed, the SCREEN com-
mand will scroll the window only.
Example:
10 MOVE 0 TO 20,12
20 ENABLE 0
30 CHARLRND(I)*40, 0, "*"
40 SCREEN SDOWN
50 COTO 30
RESET
If you do something like enter an
incorrect address in a  RAMFONT
command, or leave all your sprites
enabled when entering direct mode to
YOUR COMMODORE july 1989
65
edit a program, it can be hard to tell
what's going on when the character set
is corrupted. If  you get into such a
situation entering RESET will reset all
SPRITZ'S varables to their default
values.
The command can also be used at
the start of a program to make sure
that all the system variables contain
the default values. These default
settings are shown below:-
MODE :  HIRES
FONT 
:
 CBMFONT (Upper case)
REVERSE: SOFTRVS
SPRITES :  DISABLEd
Examples:
10 RESET:SCNCLR:ENABLE 0
RESET:SCNCLR
SPRITZ
As SPRITZ adds 30 new keywords to
the Basic operating system. it can be
a little difﬁcult to  remember all o f
them. I f  you cannot remember a
command o r  keyword, ty p i n g
SPRITZ will display a list of them on
the sreen. It will automatically con-
ﬁgure the list width to the size of the
current window.
Example:
SPRITZ
10 SCNCLR:SPRITZ
SPRITZ User Function
As well as the 19 commands SPRITZ
adds to Basic, SPRITZ also provides
you with four new functions. These
make the setup and control of sprites
easier. These are used just like Basic
functions as an argument of another
command. For  example:- PR IN T
SCRN ("A") will print the screen or
character code value of the ASCII "A"
character. Equally C9(7•SCRN("A")
will assign this value to the variable
C%. As you can see, these functions
are used as the argument for another
command, not as a  command by
themselves.
SCRN ("CHR")
SCRN is used to convert an ASCII
character into its equivalent screen
code used in  the D E FIN E  and
SPRITE commands. As with all
functions, the single parameter is

enclosed within brackets and, as the
argument is a string, it should also be
enclosed within inverted commas, The
string should only be one character
long, but, if the string you speciﬁy is
longer, in the same manner as the Basic
ASC function, only the leftmost
character is considered. You can also
use functions fro m within other
functions as long as they yield the
correct type of parameter.
Examples:
DEFINE SCRN ("@"), 170, 85, 170,
85, 170, 85, 170, 85
10 SzSCRN (CHR$(64)
20 PRINT S
XPOS (SP) and YPOS (SP)
The XPOS and YPOS functions are
used to ﬁnd the position of any sprite.
The one parameter they take is the
sprite number, which should be in the
range 0-7. The functions should only
really be used when the sprite you are
ﬁnding the position of is enabled. The
values returned are in the ranges of
0-38 and 0-23 fo r the X  and Y -
coordinates respectively.
Examples:
ENABLE °MOVE 0 TO XPOS (0)+1,
YPOS (0)+1
10 PRINT "Position of  Sprite 4:
"APOS (0);",";YPOS (0)
COLLIDE (SP)
COLLIDE is an important part of the
SPRITZ system. It tells you whether
or not a sprite (SP) has collided with
a character which is foreground. I t
returns a zero for no collision or a one
for a collision. Collide can be used with
the I F  command like any normal
function. What constitutes a collision
is for any of the characters in the 2*2
square the sprite occupies, to be a non-
space character, greater or equal to the
FOREGROUND setting. Thus the
two setups below are respectively no
collision and a collision.

SPRITZ Sprite - Editor
Program
As well as the SPRITZ Basic com-
mands, I have provided a full-featured
YOUR COMMODORE july 1989
66
Sprite Editor which can be used to
create colour, hires Sprites f o r
SPRITZ with the minimum of effort.
As the program is fully cursor con-
trolled, it is not neccesary to use any
numbers at all to deﬁne a sprite.
The Screen Display
When you run the Sprite Editor
program you will see that the screen
is divided into seven squares o r
windows. These windows are used as
follows:
The Title Window at the head of the
screen simply displays the Sprite—
Editor heading.
The Edit Window on the left of the
screen is where all the action happens.
In it is displayed a full colour, enlarged
version o f the sprite currently being
edited. In the Edit Window you can
move the cursor and change the status
of pixels and colours.
When you ﬁrst run the Sprite-
Editor it will contain a display of sprite
0 and a cross wire cursor in the top
left of the window.
Next to  the edit window are two
windows which contain a normal size
picture o f  the current sprite. The
windows look identical but the top one
shows the current sprite in colour and
the lower one in monochrome.
On the centre-right of the screen is the
Dialogue Window which for most of
the time displays a reminder o f the
control keys the Sprite Editor program
uses. Whenever you are using a
function such as saving a set of sprites
or changing colours, all the computers
output and human input is displayed
in this window.
In the bottom-right corner o f the
screen is a window which displays the
eight sprites which are currently in
memory, accompanied by their equi-
valent number. These sprites are
displayed i n  colour as i n  the top
display window.
The ﬁnal window, the Status Window
is located beneath the two display
windows. On the left is displayed the
number of the sprite which is being
edited, and on the right is the current
editing mode.
When ﬁrst run, these will be # 0
and "+".

The Control Keys
The most important keys the Sprite
Editor uses are the cursor control keys.
If you press these you can see the cross
wire cursor in the Edit window move
around the window.
If you move the cursor over a set
pixel then it changes to a white cross
on a coloured square, if it is on a reset
(white) pixel then it appears coloured
on a white background. In  this way
the cursor is always visible and the
status o f the pixel i t covers is still
displayed. The Sprite-Editor will
prevent you from trying to  move
outside the Edit Window.
Individual pixels of a sprite can be
changed by using the 'A' and 'Z keys
to Set and Reset the pixel under the
cursor. Any changes you make to a
sprite are displayed in cqlour in the
top display window and the sprite
window, and in the monochrome in
the lower display window.
As well as changing the state ot
pixels individually, you can make the
cursor leave a  trail o f  either Set
(coloured) pixels o r  Reset (white)
pixels as you move it around the edit
window. To make it leave a Set trail
press Fl, or to make it leave a Reset
trail press F2. These are the equivalents
of drawing or erasing. If you only want
to change pixels individually using 'A'
and 'Z', then you can press F3 to do
so. The current drawing mode is shown
in the status window. A '+' indicates
the draw or set mode, a indicates
the Erase or Reset mode, and a
indicates that pixels will be unchanged
when you move the cursor over them
- the Over Mode.
One o f the features the Sprite-
Editor program offers which is unique
to SPRITZ is the colour function.
As explained before, a sprite can
have a different colour for each of its
four single character quarters. B y

pressing 'C' you can change the colour
of the quarter-Sprite i n  which the
cursor is currently located. When you
press 'C' the program will clear the

When you enter these, the change in

colour will be displayed in the Edit,
Display and Sprite windows. The
cursor will them draw in the new
colour selected.
If you want to start with a clean
canvas so to speak, then pressing the
'U R )  HOME' key will clear the Edit
window leaving you with an empty
black sprite. Care should he taken
using this function as you can not then
recover your handiwork!
All of SPRITZ's eight sprites can
be edited. You can change the sprite
to be edited by pressing the 'E' key.
The dialogue window will then clear
and you can enter the sprite in the
range 0-7. The new number is dis-
played in the Status window and the
new sprite is drawn in the Edit and
Display windows. The Sprite can then
be edited just like any other.
When you are happy with your
sprites you can save them onto disk
or tape by pressing 'S'. The dialogue
window will prompt you for the save
device and you should press 'D' for
the Disk or 'T' for Tape. The name
under which you wish your collection
of eight sprites to be saved should then
he entered. The ﬁle-name should be
no longer than ten characters as
SPRITZ adds a ﬁve character exten-
sion of its own.
You can reload sets o f  sprites
previously saved fro m the Sprite-
Editor by hitting the 1 :  key. The
program will prompt for device and
ﬁle-name in exactly the same way as
for saving sprites. The sprites will then
he reloaded for further editing.
Finally, when you have ﬁnished
using the Sprite-Editor program, you
can get out o f it by pressing 'ESC'
which will return you to Basic and reset
the SPRITZ system variables to their
default settings.
Changing the Sprite-
Editor Font Address
When you ﬁrst use the Sprite-Editor
program, it is set up for a character
set at $F800 -  the highest possible
place on a Plus/ 4 or 64K C16. If you
want to  change this address, fo r
example, if you only have a 32K C16,
then all you have to do is change the
RAMFONT command in line 90 and
the ADDRESS declaration in line 100
of the program. Care should be taken
not to set the address lower than the
end of the Sprite—Editor program if
you have not saved a backup copy.

Using Sprites in your own
programs
It is not much use designing a set of
sprites i f you cannot then use them
in your own programs under the
control o f SPRITZ. Luckily, this is
easy to do. The lines displayed below
should be added to the start of your
program to load in the sprite charac-
ter set and data.
10 IFL = 0 THENL= I: LOAD"name.
FONT",(dev), I
20 IFL  = I  THEN L  = 2: L OAD "
name.SPRT",(dev), I
30 ADDRESS = (ADDRESS)
40 RAMFONT AD
50 POKE55,0:POKE56,AD/ 256:CLR
You should insert the ﬁle-name
given to your collection of sprites in
place o f  'name', (dev) should be
replaced by I for tape users or 8 for
disk users. (ADDRESS) should be
replaced with the address at which
your sprite character set is stored. This
can be expressed in decimal, or in hex
using D E C ( ‘ A A A A " )  w h e r e
"AAAA" is the hexadecimal address
of the character set.
It must be stressed that this section
of program should be used a t the
beginning of a program and will only
work in this position because i t is
ntcesary to clear (or CLR) all Basic
variables after loading a section of data
into RAM.
When the program section shown
above has been run, your sprites can
be displayed and moved simply by
ENABLEing the sprites and then using
the normal SPRITZ commands. There
is no need to  execute any further
SPRITE command as SPRITZ sprite
data as well as character set data is
loaded into RAM, thus simulating the
effect o f  a series o f DEFINE and
SPRITE commands.
Getting SPRITZ Up and
Running
The BASIC Loader Program
The Basic Loader Program is used to
install the SPR ITZ machine-code
program. It should be entered and run
in the normal way. The program gives
its own error messages to help you
locate any errors you may have entered
in the data section. Once the program
has been entered correctly, you should
press 'D' or 'T' to choose whether the
PL US4 P R O G R A M
program is to be saved to Disk or Tape
and then hit RETURN as indicated
by the loader program. At this point
two ﬁles are saved: A backup copy of
the basic loader program and a ﬁle
named 'SPRITZ'. At this point you
can reset your computer and from this
time you can get SPRITZ running by
simply typing:-
DLOAD"SPRITZ" (For Disk Users)
LOAErSPRITZ" (For Tape Users)
RUN (RETURN)
A copyright message will be dis-
played and you can then use any of
the SPRITZ commands and functions
either in a program or in Basic direct
mode.
Demonstration Program
I have included a  Demonstration
program to display SPRITZ's func-
tions working to the limit. The pro-
gram controls all eight colour sprites
independantly and simultaneously
while playing a section of J.S. Bach's
2-part Invention in D-Minor! -  quite
a feat for a humble Plus/4 program
written in Basic!
To use the demo program you
should ﬁrst load the SPRITZ system
program. Yo u  can then save the
demonstration program using the

1 our Commodore is always on the
look out for new programs, hints and
tips, articles and even regular series. In
fact i f  you have something that you
think could be of usc to other Commo-
dore owners we want to hear about it.
So if you have got something which
you think  we may be interested in.
How do you go about submitting it to
us?
Below you will ﬁnd a list of guide-
lines that will help us to deal with any
item that you send in to us. We don't
expect everybody t o  b e  t h e  nex t
William Shakespeare but i f  you d o
follow these simple rules then it will
MUMe our job a lot easier.
1) I I  possible all material sent to the
magazine should be typed or printed
out on a computer printer.
2) All text should be double spaced i.e.
there should be a blank line between
each line of text. You should also leave
a mar gin o f  about 1 0  characters
around the text.
3) On the very ﬁrst page you should
put the following:
Name of the article
Machine that it is for
Any extras required -  disk, printer
etc.
Your name
Your address
Your telephone number
4) The top of every page should have
the following information on it:
Abbreviation of the article title
Your name
The page number
READERS SU BMISSIO N S
So you own a Commodore? So you've
written some programs? So why haven't you
sent them to us?
For ex ample. suppose y o u  h a d
submitted an article on C64 interrupts.
You should put something lik e the
following at the head of the page:
Interrupts/ISmith/1
5) Please make sure that you do not
make any additional marks on your
text especially underlining.
6) Try a n d  wr ite i n  clear concise
English, it does not have to be a work
of literature built must be comprehen-
sible.
7) On the bottom of  each page you
should put the word MORE if  there
are more pages to the article or ENDS
if it is the last page.
8) I f  possible, enclose a listing of all
programs.
9) Under , no circumstances us e a
staple to hold the pages together. Use a
paperclip instead.
10) Programs should be included on
either disk or tape. Make sure that you
SAVE two copies of every program so
that we have a better chance of loading
them if problems occur.
11) Programs under 10 lines can be
included in the text. If your program is
longer than this you must enclose a
disk or cassette.
12) I f  your article needs any artwork
then supply clear examples of what is
needed. We don't expect you to be an
artist but we do need to see what is
required.
YOUR COMMODORE july 1989
73
13) Photographs, i f  necessary, must
be either black and white prints or
colour slides, We can take shots our-
selves so don't worry about this too
much.
14) Submissions o f  any length are
welcome. If you have a ﬁve line routine
that y ou think  may  be o f  use t o
someone else we welcome it just as
much as a full blown six part series.
15) Payment varies quite a lot and de-
pends on quite a number of factors,
such a s  c omplex ity  o f  program,
presentation o f  program, number of
magazine pages it takes up etc. Pay-
ment is generally between £10.00 and
E800.00.
16) A l l  payments are made in  the
month that the magazine containing
your article has appeared in print.
17) If we do ﬁnd your submission
suitable for inclusion in the magazine
we will write to you giving the terms of
publication, the rate of payment and
an agreement form. Prompt return of
this form will allow us to use your
program as soon as possible.
18) I f  you want the program return-
ing to you, should we ﬁnd it unsuitable
for public ation, t hen y o u  s hould
enclose a  stamped s elf  addressed
envelope.
19) The last and most important point
to make is 'get writing*, we are waiting
for your articles.

ﬁrst came across the original (and presumably, in view
of this title, unreal Ghostbusters) game years ago at
a computer show I  was helping out with. Those
wonderful people on the Activision stand played the theme
music from the ﬁlm non-stop for four days. That, coupled
with an unbelievable amount o f hype and a  mediocre
product. left my feelings for the original game at best
lukewarm.
Now years later, with the television programme currently
proving extremely popular, I was interested to see whether
the sequel was going to prove to be a major improvement
on its predecessor. Sadly, the game is little more than a
gloriﬁed shoot-ern-up. You must wander round trying to
clear an area of assorted ghosties. ghoulies and things that
go bump in the night. At the end of the levels (there are
ten in all), you have to dispose of a bigger, butcher badd
who, upon going to that great haunted house in the sky,
lets slip a key allowing you access to the next stage of
the game.
You can destroy the creatures either by shooting them.
or zapping them with your proton beam. This latter method
M E S  R E V I E W
YOUR COMMODORE july 1989

has the advantage that the ghosts can then be stored in
your backpack for a points bonus when you complete the
level. The disadvantage, though, is that this weapon only
has a limited amount of energy, whereas your gun has a
limitless supply of bullets.
The energy for your proton beam can be topped up
as one of a number of bonuses that can be collected on
your travels. You can also increase your ﬁre power, provide
yourself with a protective shield or enlist the services of
your friendly neighbourhood slimer. This little critter dances
round your head destroying anything he touches, also
offering a form of increased protection.

Picking up bonuses is simply a matter of ﬁnding and
then walking over them. Some are hidden under oil drums,
some carried by ghosts. The most useful ones though are
behind barriers of spiky things (the graphics aren't clear
enough to determine what exactly) that rise and fall out
of the ground. Contact with these spikes is fatal, so you
have to time your run into the protective ring precisely.
The graphics and sprites are very chunky, and even
though there is a  large variety o f ghosts, my overall
impression was that the whole thing looked very dated.
Scrolling was reasonably smooth, although there was a fair
ere is something of a rarity a  text-only adventure!
At a time when even the mighty Infocom have
reluctantly been forced to include graphics in their
games, it's nice to ﬁnd someone who ,still believes that a
picture is not necessarily worth a thousand words, and that
the powers of imagination still count for something.
The wizard Kedrigern has invented a system o f time
share travel. Rather than wasting away when you're old,
you can trade some of that time for a decent holiday now.
Unfortunately, the vagaries of the system mean that you
can't use up your own years, but somebody else's. Rut if,
while using their time, you let them use up yours. an amicable

has been tarted up to include a few new sound effects,

There's nothing here to make you sit up and take notice.
It might be worth a second look i f you are a fan of the

have another go.

settlement can be reached and everybody ends up with what
they want.
That, at least, is the theory. Rut Kedrigern refused to
license his invention, and made himself many enemies who
wanted a share of the action. Now he has a problem, as
somebody has managed to penetrate the system and steal
some time from the customers so that they are returning
old, withered, even dead.
In an attempt to sort out the problem and save himself
from ﬁnancial ruin, the wizard sent his assistant Jocasta
to investigate, but she has now disappeared and so it is
up to you h e r  twin - to see if you can sort things out.
The game loads in two sections, and there is plenty
for you to get your teeth into. Location descriptions are
both long and atmospheric, and you'll have to  read
everything very carefully in order to glean the appropriate
clues. There is a nice touch of whimsical humour running
through the story too. The problems and puzzles, together
with the storyline, show a  considerable amount o f
imagination and invention in what has all too often been
reduced to a hackneyed art form. The parser is perfectly
adequate, and I found no problems with the vocabulary
either.
Time Thief is on disk only and at only ﬁve pounds,
represents excellent value for money. The game is only
available through mail order, address below.

S
market some four years ago the
Amiga has gone from strength
to strength. Today it is one of the most
powerful and versatile home compu-
ters available. And yet, recently it has
actually gone down in price. So, the
band of Amiga owners is growing all
the time.
I always maintain that a computer
is as good as what you make of it.
This is especially true for computers.
Nobody has any queries about what
to do with a television set or a video
recorder or a hi-ﬁ. Once you've bought
it, you just get it out of its box, plug
it in, press the ON- button, and Bob's-
Your-U ncle.
Computers are very different from
that. When you start a computer it
does very little at ﬁrst. All you've got
is a clever box of electronic bits and
pieces.
This is true even for a machine as
powerful as the Amiga. Its real might
is hidden underneath the surface, only
unleashed by good software and by
your own enthusiasm to get to know
the machine and make use of its inert
capabilities.
Sure, when you switch on the
Amiga, the ﬁrst thing you are greeted
by is Workbench. And that's a whole
lot more then what you get from most
other computers at start-up, especially
the 8-bit machines we all grew up with,
like the Commodore 64, the Sinclair
Spectrum a n d  th e  Aco rn  B B C
machines, I don't know if some of you
still remember the ancient days o f
computers when all you were greeted
with at start-up was a ﬂashing cursor
of some kind.
Amazing how far things have come
since!
But, Workbench too is merely an
environment in which to make things
happen on the Amiga. It's not the main
event itself.
Workbench is basically an appli-
cations program that allows you to run
other programs and do some disk
operations, like disk copy, disk for-
matting and so on. All the facilities
of Workbench are made possible by
an important part o f  the Amiga
operating system, called Intuition.
Whenever you resize a window,
pull down a menu, click the gadget
on the left hand side of a window which
makes the window vanish, it's Intui-

lion, not Workbench, that makes it all
happen.
Intuition is a programmer's delight
because it puts all the sophisticated
facilities o f the Amiga right at his
ﬁngertips. The programmer does not
have to draw lines to form the borders
of a window, nor does he have to
construct pull-down menus or compli-
cated gadgets. Intuition does it all for
him, and informs him whenever
something really important has
happened.
When you ﬁrst try to ﬁnd out more
about the Amiga, and especially how
to program it, the task seems quite
daunting. This isn't helped b y the
literature which is supposed to  help
you, like the massive Amiga manuals
published by Addison Wesley. You
wonder what kind of computer genius
it takes to understand the workings of
the Amiga, let alone, to be able to
program it.
But once you've overcome this
initial barrier and get some insight into
the Amiga, you'll discover to your
surprise that the Amiga is in fact one
of the easiest machines to program!
Yes, that's true! Never mind, if you
program in Basic or in C or even in
machine code, the Amiga puts all its
capabilities more easily at the disposal
of the programmer than any other
machine! Before you know it, your
program will have windows and pull-
down menus, gadgets and requesters
and will run comfortably i n  the
multitasking environment o f  the
Amiga together with other programs.
To help you on your way to
discovering the workings of the Amiga
and how to unleash its power for your
own purposes and desires, Yo u r
Commodore is starting this new
monthly column.
My main aim in this column is to
discuss all aspects o f  Amiga com-
puting with special emphasis on pro-
gramming the Amiga.
For this I'd like to hear from you!
What are your main interests in Amiga
computing? What persuaded you to
buy an Amiga in the ﬁrst place? What
do you ﬁnd most difﬁcult and con-
fusing about the Amiga?
In short, send me your opinions,
your queries, your suggestions.
But let's start the ball rolling by
having a closer look at Workbench 1.3
which most of you will have by now.
AMIGA
If you compare Workbench 1.3
with its predecessor Workbench 1.2
there seems very little difference. The
main advantage with Workbench 1.3
is that it runs a bit quicker because of
new facilities like fast text and fast
ﬁling.
You are also able to rename the
Ram disk, something you couldn't do
on Workbench 1.2 because there was
a bug.
The main advantage with Work-
bench 1.3 does not lie with Workbench
at all, but with CL1. The new shell
window makes the real difference to
Workbench 1.2.
As far as commands are concerned
Shell is very much like CLI, except
for tw o  new commands. Its main
advantage lies in the vastly improved
editing facilities, which has to be a big
improvement, because the old CL1
didn't have any editing facilities at all
- except backspace.
Shell acts more like a screen editor
than a line editor. Unlike the CL1 it's
got a history. That is, you can use the
cursor up and down keys to  recall
commands you have typed in before.
This makes it possible to edit a wrong
command you've given instead o f
having to type it all in from scratch
again.
You can also use cursor left and
right to correct anything you've typed
in wrongly or add something you've
forgotten.
Then the Shell has got two new
commands which are extremely useful:
Alias and Resident.
Alias allows you to design your
own commands. For example, I have
made up for my purposes some aliases
to give me the directory of the disk
in drive 0 and I. "d0" gives me the
directory of the disk in drive 0, while
"d 1" gives me the directory of the disk
in drive I. Furthermore, "d2" gives me
the directory of the disk in drive 1 with
option i, while "d3" gives me the same
for drive I.
With the Alias command you can
use square bracket sto signify a
ﬁlename or variable which can then
be given together with the Alias. For
example:
alias dO dir df0:11
gives you, if used by itself, a printout
YOUR COMMODORE july 1989
77
of the directory in drive 0 (which is
of course the inbuilt drive), if you enter
"do MyDirectory" you get a printout
of "MyDirectory" on the disk in drive
O.
The other new command the Shell
has is Resident.
This makes a  command behave
works as i f you had copied a  CL1
command into the RAM disk so that
it executed quicker and without the
Workbench disk in the drive.
Resident also works for programs
But there is the restriction that resident
only works for CLI commands and
programs that are re-entrant and re-
executable, meaning programs that
can be used by several processes at the
same time in the Amiga multitasking
environment. This is not as restrictive
as it seems since most programs can
be made resident quite happily with
the "resident pure" option, even if at
ﬁrst it refuses to make that program
resident. All you have to do is exper-
iment a bit with the program to make
sure that the machine won't play up.
Finally, the Shell has a startup
script, called "Shell-startup". You can
ﬁnd i t  i n  the s-directory o f  the
Workbench disk.
In the Shell startup script you can
enter all your favourite aliases so that
they will be automatically initialized
every time you start a  new shell
process.
This seems to me to be the main
advantage w i th  Workbench 1.3.
Workbench 1.3 has a  much larger
startup-sequence than Workbench 1.2
and even uses a  sub-script, called
Startup11. All this enables you to set
up your own Amiga work environment
as it suits you.
To ﬁnish off, let me know about
any good scripts you've written lately.

I
keyboard having just ﬁnished a marathon typing session
entering one o f  the superb programs from Your
Commodore. Your ﬁngers reach for the keyboard and press
the letters R, U and N. You press RETURN, sit back and
nothing happens.
Everyone has probably faced this problem. When it does
happen it's a matter of spending hours searching through
the program for any typing mistakes. No matter how long
you look or how many people help you, you can usually
guarantee that at least one little but slips through unnoticed.
The Your Commodore Software Service makes available
all of the programs from each issue on both cassette and
disk at a price of E6.00 for disk and .E4.00 for cassette.
None of the documentation for the programs is supplied
with the software since it is all available in the relevant
magazine. Should you not have the magazine then back
issues are available from the following address:
1NFONET LTD, 5 River Park Estate; Berkahmsted, Herts,
HP4 IFIL.
Tel: (04427) 7666 I
Please contact this address for prices and availability.
-
Programs on the disk will also be supplied as totally working
versions, i.e. when possible we will not use Basic Loaders
thus making use of the programs much easier. Unfortunately
at the moment we cannot duplicate C16 and Plus 4 cassettes.
However programs for these machines will be available on
the disk.
What programs are available?
At the top of each article you will ﬁnd a strap containing
the article type, C M Program etc. So that you can see
which programs are available on which format, you will
also ﬁnd a couple of symbols after this strap. The symbols
have the following meaning:

This symbol means that the program is available on cassette.
These programs are available on disk.

Since the programs supplied on cassette are total working

on tape. There is no sense in placing a program that expects
to be reading from disk on to tape.

Readers Problems
Though the Commodore 64 is one ol
the world's most popular microcom-
puters, it can be very difﬁcult to ﬁnd
speciﬁc information about yo u r
particular machine.
At the Your Commodore ofﬁce we
receive literally hundreds o f  letters
from you, our readers, on a wide range
of subjects ranging from the simple
Can you give me the telephone
number for...', to the more complex
I'm trying to write a program that uses
a split screen. How do I do it?'
Unfortunately, the volume of mail
received has become so great that it
is impossible to answer every letter and
still manage to publish a  magazine
each month.
For this reason we have felt i t
necessary to  produce a  number o f
guidelines fo r getting information
from us:
I) We cannot guarantee to  answer
every letter sent to  the magazine.
Should i t become apparent that a
number of readers are suffering from
the same problem, then we will reply
to the letter via the Letters page.
2) A new helpline has been set up. This
w ill be open fo r your queries o n
Tuesday and Thursday afternoons
between 2.00pm and 4.00pm. We will
not be able to deal with our telephone
queries at any other time. If our tech-
nical adviser is not available when you
ring, then a message will be taken.
3) If you are having problems with one
of our listings, can you please let us
know in writing. This will enable us
to see if a number of people are having
the same problem. When a common
problem becomes apparent with a pro-
gram, then a correction sheet will be
issued. Enclose a  self-addressed,
stamped envelope and we will send you
a copy of the correction sheet as soon
as it is available.
We are sorry that it has become
necessary to instigate these rules. How-
ever, we are sure that you will agree
with us that the more time that we
can spend making Your Commodore
the mo st informative magazine
around, the better.

Bug Finder
We'd like to remind our readers that
we run a Bug Finder service.
If you have typed in one of our
programs and despite much checking,
you still can't get it to run, then send us
the following:
Two copies of your program on tape
or disk.
A description of your problem.
I
may omit this).
A stamped. self-addressed envelope
for return of the program to you.
Should any of the above be missing
then we will not be able to deal with
your query.
We will try to point out where you
have made errors and place a corrected
copy of the program back on to your
tape or disk before we return it to you.
Do not send a program to us as
soon as it stops working, please check
it several times ﬁrst.
We d o  get a  large number o f
queries and so it may take a while for
us to deal with yours personally.
Note: we can only deal with problems
relating to programs published in Your
Conunodore.

GEOS v2.0
The Graphic Environment Operating System for
the 64 & 128
If your productivity programs don't relate to each
other, it's time to consider adopting GEOS, the
totally intergrated software system Like any good
family. GEOS products work together & grow
together. In fact, for every application you add,
your capacity for production actually multiplies.
A strong family resemblaca
All GEOS products work & look pretty much the
same Same menus, same icons s o once you
learn how to point & click, you pretty much know
how geoPublish. geoFile. geoCalc & every other
family member works.
GEOS family members freely swop data with one
another. so importing text & graphics between
programs is never a problem. Which means you
spend more time creating stuff &  less time
deciphering all those other instruction manuals.
Marry into the family.
Now, when it comes to improving your looks, the
best way is by marrying into our family. Because
GEOS Text & Graphic Grabbers take your old
data & convert it into GEOS formal so that your
C64 & 128 can deliver beautiful offspring. So if
you would like your software to relate to each
other, adopt the GEOS family.
