 CHAPTER 1  
 Becoming Acquainted with Excel 
 Excel is a powerful and versatile spreadsheet program that can be used for both business and personal 
needs. It has amazing capabilities that you can use to make any type of data you record more streamlined 
and productive. In the first chapter, you’ll learn the basics of creating worksheets, and how to use the 
 Ribbon , a feature which drives the user-friendly resources in Excel. 
 After reading and working through this chapter you should be able to
• 
 Know what Excel is and know some of its capabilities  
• 
 Create, save, and open a workbook 
• 
 Identify the current cell 
• 
 Use the Ribbon 
• 
 Use and customize the Quick Access Toolbar 
• 
 Enter data in a worksheet 
• 
 Get help by using  Screen Tips and the  Tell me what you want to do features 
 What Is Excel?  
 Excel is an electronic spreadsheet program. A spreadsheet is a grid of cells organized into rows and columns 
in which you enter and store your data. Excel can meet both your personal and professional needs. 
 Using Excel, you can do all of the following:
• 
 Create, edit, sort, analyze, summarize, and format data as well as graph it.  
• 
 Keep budgets and handle payroll 
• 
 Track investments, loans, sales, inventory, etc.  
• 
 Perform What-If Analysis to determine such things as “if the price of gas went up 
20 cents per gallon” by how much would that decrease my profit, or “if I extend my 
loan payments from 15 years to 20 years” by how much will that affect my monthly 
payments, total payments, and total interest.    
 One can improve the appearance of a spreadsheet or better convey what you want a spreadsheet to say 
by adding pictures, clip art, shapes, smart art, video, and audio.

CHAPTER 1 ■ BECOMING ACQUAINTED WITH EXCEL
2
 Microsoft Office is Microsoft’s most profitable product. Microsoft devoted most of its effort in Microsoft 
Office 2016 to updating Excel. Microsoft made few changes to its other products in Office. 
 History of Spreadsheets 
 VisiCalc (short for Visible Calculator) was the first computerized  spreadsheet   available to the public. It was 
created by Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston in 1979 for the Apple IIe and then released in 1981 for the newly 
created IBM PC. Up to this point, sales of personal computers had been slow because there wasn’t a lot you 
could do with them. Early PCs were very expensive and there weren’t any prewritten applications. They 
were mostly purchased by computer programmers who thought they were fascinating and it gave them a 
chance to practice programming at home. At this point, programmers worked on large-scale computers 
called mainframes. At that time, you couldn’t go to a store and buy software like you can today. Back then, 
company programmers wrote all the programs that the company needed themselves. Each company 
wrote its own payroll program, its own inventory program, etc. Companies didn’t share the software with 
each other. With  VisiCalc , businesses now had a product that could be of great benefit. Sales of personal 
computers took off. VisiCalc became the world’s first Super App. VisiCalc also started a revolution in 
businesses being started for the sole purpose of creating software to be sold to the public. 
 The  Lotus 1-2-3 Spreadsheet program was released in 1983. It was made specifically for the IBM PC. It 
was faster and had better graphics than  VisiCalc and soon replaced it. Lotus 1-2- 3   greatly increased the sales 
of the IBM PC. 
 Microsoft Excel has dominated the spreadsheet market since the 1990s. 
 This Book 
 An Excel book that taught you every possible option would be too large for you to carry. As you go through 
the material in the book, explore the different options and try different things, think about how you could use 
what is being taught in different environments. Don’t just click here and enter that, because that is what the 
book is telling you to do without thinking about what it is you are doing. Excel is so powerful and is capable of 
doing so many things. Be a free thinker and think about how you could use Excel to solve various problems. 
 Throughout this book you will be reading about an Excel topic followed by a practice. You can learn 
by reading, but to fully comprehend the different topics you should do the exercises. Many illustrations are 
included to make it easier to follow along and comprehend. 
 
■ Note   Your Excel program might not match perfectly with this workbook. Microsoft is constantly making 
changes to the program through the Internet. 
 Excel Navigation Basics 
 Before we can do anything with Excel, let’s get to know the main parts of the program. Figure  1-1 shows an 
Excel workbook. The arrows have been added to highlight the purpose of the different areas of the workbook.  

CHAPTER 1 ■ BECOMING ACQUAINTED WITH EXCEL
3
 Figure  1-1 shows essential components of the workbook and worksheet. I’ll work clockwise around the 
sheet starting with the Quick Access Toolbar ( QAT ).
• 
  The  QAT is a shortcut tool for storing the commands you use most often and want 
quick access to. 
• 
 The formula bar shows the formulas for the current selected cell. Excel displays the 
result of the formulas, not the formula itself, in each cell. This bar lets you see the 
formula that is producing the cell results. 
• 
  The vertical scroll bar and horizontal scroll bar allow you to move through the 
worksheet page. 
• 
 The Zoom control, Page Break Preview, Page Layout View and Normal View are 
buttons that allow you to control how you are viewing the worksheet.
• 
 The Zoom control lets you increase or decrease the size (Zoom percentage) of 
the worksheet on your screen. 
• 
 Page Break Preview allows you to control where one page ends and another 
begins. This helps make the worksheet more user friendly by allowing pages to 
be organized in a way that makes sense to the user.  
• 
 Page Layout View shows how the page will look when it is printed. Use this 
function to ensure the printed workbook will be neat and easy to read. 
• 
 Normal View is the default view. It shows how the workbook looks while you are 
working on it. Sheet Tabs let you select the worksheet that you want to work on 
or view. Many workbooks in Excel will have multiple sheets. 
 Figure 1-1.  An  Excel workbook 
 

CHAPTER 1 ■ BECOMING ACQUAINTED WITH EXCEL

 The row number tells you what row you are on in the workbook. Excel has a potential of 1,048,576 
rows. Columns are identified by letters. There are 16,384 columns in an Excel spreadsheet. This means that 
a single worksheet contains more than 17 billion cells. Each cell can hold 32,767 characters. How many 
worksheets you can have in a workbook depends upon your computer’s available memory. Each cell is 
identified by an address which consists of the column letter and the row number. The Name box displays 
the address of the cell where you are at the moment. The Name box in Figure  1-1 displays  A1  which is the 
address of the current active cell. The Ribbon provides access to all of Excel’s capabilities. The Ribbon will be 
discussed in much greater detail later in this chapter and in subsequent chapters.  
 Creating, Saving, and Opening Workbooks  
 The first step is to create a workbook. Next, you must make sure to save your work as you go. You should 
consider what you want in the workbook and what it should be named before you create and save it. This 
will make it easy to open and use it again. 
 We’ll start our Excel journey by creating a new workbook and then examine the different parts of 
the workbook. How you start Excel depends upon your operating system. Excel starts just like any other 
application you use. 
 
EXERCISE 1-1: CREATING AND SAVING A WORKBOOK
 In this exercise, we’ll create a simple blank workbook and save it.
 1. 
 Start your Excel program. If the Excel start button is on your status bar you can click 
on it, otherwise start Excel the way you normally start a program. Figure  1-2 shows 
the opening window. 

CHAPTER 1 ■ BECOMING ACQUAINTED WITH EXCEL

■ Note The file names on the left side of your window will not be the same as those shown in Figure  1-2 
because they are the names of the files that I have opened. 
 2. 
 When you start a new workbook, you have two choices:
• 
 You can start with a blank workbook by clicking the Blank workbook button, or 
• 
 You can click one of the many template buttons to create a new workbook based 
on the templates you selected. 
 Click Blank workbook for this exercise. 
 3. 
 Click any cell, type any value you want, and then press the Enter key. 
 4. 
 Click the Save button  
 located on the QAT at the top left of your window (see 
Figure  1-1 ). The first time you save the workbook Excel will display the File tab with 
Save  As highlighted. See Figure  1-3 . 
 
■ Note You will learn a lot more about saving workbooks from the File tab (known as the Backstage) in 
Chapter   6  . 
 You can save your file to many different locations. If you are using this book in a school, you 
should ask your instructor where to save your files. The folders on the right are places where 
you have recently saved files. Selecting one of these locations or clicking on the Browse 
button will bring up the Save As window. 
 5. 
 Click Browse. 
 Your Save  As window may look slightly different than the one in Figure  1-4 depending upon 
your version of Windows. If you have used File Explorer before, this window works the same 
 Figure 1-3.  Places to  save your workbook 
 

CHAPTER 1 ■ BECOMING ACQUAINTED WITH EXCEL

way. Click a folder and then, if need be, click a folder within that folder as you build the path 
to where you want the file to be saved. The path is the drive and folders that you must go 
through to get to the file. The workbook being saved in Figure  1-4 is set to be saved in the 
Documents folder. You may want to store the file directly in the My Documents folder or you 
may want to create a folder under your My Documents folder and then store your files in 
it. The File name is Book1.xlsx by default. You should change the name to something more 
relevant to what you are working on. The File name can be changed by dragging across the 
word Book1 and then typing a new name. 
 6. 
 Create the path to where you want your workbook saved by clicking on the folders 
in the left pane of the Save As window until you are at the location where you want 
to store your files. 
 7. 
 Change the File name from Book1 to MyFirstWorkbook. Excel adds an extension of 
.xlsx to the file name. Make sure the  Save as type is Excel Workbook(*.xlsx). 
 8. 
 Click the Save button. 
 9. 
 Enter any value you want in another cell then press Enter. 
 10. 
 Click the Save button  
  located on the QAT. Since you previously saved the file, the 
Save As window doesn’t appear. Excel saves the file with all the changes you made to it.  
 11. 
 Close Excel by clicking the X in the upper right corner. 
 Figure 1-4.  Save  As  window 
 

CHAPTER 1 ■ BECOMING ACQUAINTED WITH EXCEL

 This exercise showed you the basics of creating a workbook. Next, you’ll practice opening the same 
workbook to continue working on it. 
 
EXERCISE 1-2: OPEN A WORKBOOK AND CREATE A NEW ONE
 In this exercise, we’ll open the file we created in the last exercise, make some changes, and then save 
with a new name. This will create a new workbook.
 1. 
 Start Excel. 
 The window in Figure  1-5 displays with the MyFirstWorkbook file you created in the previous exercise 
listed in the Recent list. 
 2. 
 Click MyFirstWorkbook. The workbook opens. 
 Next, we will add additional cell values to this workbook and then save it under a different name. 
 Create Another Workbook Under a Different Name 
 1. 
 Enter any value you want in a blank cell. 
 2. 
 Click the Ribbon’s File tab. 
 Figure 1-5.  Open a recently used workbook 
 

CHAPTER 1 ■ BECOMING ACQUAINTED WITH EXCEL

 3. 
 In the left pane click Save As. 
 4. 
 Click Browse 
 5. 
 You can save this file in the same Documents folder where you saved 
MyFirstWorkbook. Change the name to MySecondWorkbook and click the Save button.  
 You now have two separate workbooks; one named MyFirstWorkbook and another named 
MySecondWorkbook. MySecondWorkbook contains the same data as MyFirstWork plus the additional 
cell value you added. Next, you’ll learn about the Ribbon. This feature gives you access to the editing and 
customization options that allow you to make Excel meet your exact needs. 
 Getting to Know the Ribbon 
 Starting with Office 2007, Microsoft Office quit using drop-down menus in favor of a tab design called the 
 Ribbon . See Figure  1-6 
 The Ribbon consists of tabs, groups, and command buttons. The default Excel Ribbon contains the following 
 tabs : File, Home, Insert, Page Layout, Formulas, Data, Review, View, and PowerPivot. Your Ribbon may include 
additional tabs depending upon your setup. Each tab is broken up into groups. The buttons are organized within 
those groups. Office 2016 lets you alter the Ribbon to meet your own needs. You can create your own tabs or add 
new groups within your tabs. You can place the commands you use most often in your own groups. 
 Ribbon  Contextual Tabs 
 In addition to the tabs that you see when you start Excel, there are many other tabs that appear and 
disappear depending on what you are working on. These are called   context-sensitive tabs because they 
are displayed based on the  context in which you are using them. These context-sensitive tabs will appear 
when you are working on such things as charts, drawings, pictures, pivot tables and pivot charts, SmartArt 
graphics, header or footers, etc. Contextual tabs have an additional label that appears above the tab. The 
labels have different background colors. Figure  1-7 shows the contextual Format tab that appears when you 
are working with pictures. It has a label of  Picture Tools above it. Figure  1-8 shows the two additional tabs 
that appear when you click a chart in your worksheet: a Design tab, and a Format tab.   
 Figure 1-6.  Illustrates the Ribbons tabs and groups 
 

CHAPTER 1 ■ BECOMING ACQUAINTED WITH EXCEL
10
 These additional tabs appear under a Chart Tools label. These tabs appear only as long as the object 
that caused them to appear is active. Clicking off the object to something else removes the tabs. 
 Resizing the Ribbon 
 Resizing  the Excel window resizes the Ribbon. As you shrink the size of the window, the buttons start to align 
vertically as shown in Figure  1-9 . 
 Shrinking the size of the Ribbon further as shown in Figure  1-10  makes the buttons disappear. Clicking 
an arrow in the group will make that group’s buttons display below the Ribbon.  
 Figure 1-9.  Buttons aligning vertically 
 Figure 1-10.  Resized Ribbon may not show buttons 
 Figure 1-7.  Additional tab displayed when an image is selected 
 Figure 1-8.  Additional tabs displayed when a chart is selected 
 
 
 
 

CHAPTER 1 ■ BECOMING ACQUAINTED WITH EXCEL
11
 As you work, you may need to adjust the size of the Ribbon to accommodate your working space. The 
next exercise shows you how. 
 
EXERCISE 1-3: RESIZE THE EXCEL WINDOW AND RIBBON
 If you see the  Restore Down button (Figure  1-11 ) in the upper right-hand corner of your window that 
means that your window is currently at its maximum size. You can’t shrink the size of the window while 
your screen is maximized. 
 1. 
 If the  Restore Down button is displayed click it. 
 2. 
 Move your cursor to the right edge of the window. The cursor will change to a 
double arrow. Drag the right edge toward the left to shrink the window. As you drag 
the window notice how the buttons start aligning vertically and as you drag farther 
to the left the buttons in the group start disappearing. 
 3. 
 Click the  Maximize button (Figure  1-12 ) 
 Your window should now be maximized and the Ribbon should be displaying all of its command  buttons . 
 Using Dialog Box Launchers 
 At the bottom right corner of some Ribbon groups are boxed arrows. See Figure  1-13 . They are called dialog 
box launchers.  Dialog box launchers present a set of options to select from. A dialog box is a window that has 
options to select from, which you must respond to before you can return to another window. It usually has 
an OK button and a Cancel button. 
 Figure 1-11.  Restore Down button 
 Figure 1-12.  Maximize button 
 Figure 1-13.  Dialog box launchers 
 
 
 

CHAPTER 1 ■ BECOMING ACQUAINTED WITH EXCEL
12
 Clicking the dialog box launcher for the Font group, Alignment group, or Number group will bring up 
the  Format Cells dialog box in Figure  1-14 . 
 If you click the Font group’s dialog box  launcher the Font tab will be selected. If you click the Alignment 
group’s dialog box launcher the Alignment tab will be selected. We will work with dialog box launchers in 
later chapters. 
 Minimizing and Hiding the Ribbon 
 If you think the Ribbon is taking up too much of your window space, you can either minimize it so that it 
only displays the tab names or you can hide it completely. Clicking the Ribbon display button in the upper 
right-hand corner of the Excel window displays three options. See Figure  1-15 . 
 Figure 1-14.     Format Cells   dialog box started from the Font dialog box launcher       
 

CHAPTER 1 ■ BECOMING ACQUAINTED WITH EXCEL
13
 The  options are:
• 
 Auto-hide Ribbon: Puts your Excel workbook in full-screen mode and hides the 
Ribbon completely. When your Ribbon is in Auto-hide mode you will see this 
 
 in the top right corner of your window. Clicking the three dots or 
anywhere to the left of them at the top of the screen will bring back the Ribbon. 
When you click inside the spreadsheet the Ribbon will disappear again.  
• 
 Show Tabs: Shows only the Ribbon tabs. Clicking a tab will display the groups with 
their buttons. Clicking anywhere on the spreadsheet will hide the groups and their 
buttons again. Pressing Ctrl + F1 works like a toggle switch while in this mode by 
hiding and unhiding the groups and buttons.  
• 
 Show Tabs and Commands: This options makes the Ribbon display in full at all 
times. 
 You can also collapse the Ribbon by clicking the up arrow  
 at the far right side of the Ribbon. 
 Using Ribbon Shortcuts 
 You were always able to use keyboard shortcuts when selecting menu items in Microsoft Office 2003 and 
previous versions. Microsoft kept this capability with the Ribbon. Pressing the Alt key on your keyboard 
brings up the shortcut keys as shown in Figure  1-16 for each of the Tabs as well as the QAT. Keying one of the 
shortcut keys for one of the Quick Access Toolbar buttons will perform that command. 
 Entering the shortcut key for a Ribbon tab will make that tab active. As you can see from Figure  1-16 
pressing the F key will make the File tab active and pressing the H key will make the Home tab active. Notice 
that the N key is used for the Insert tab. Most of the letters have no relation to the names of the options. 
 Figure 1-15.  Three Ribbon  options 
 

CHAPTER 1 ■ BECOMING ACQUAINTED WITH EXCEL
14
 When you press the letter key for the tab you want to use, shortcut keys appear for every option on that 
tab. Figure  1-17 shows the shortcut keys for all the options on the Home tab. Notice, you may need to enter 
more than one letter for the shortcut. 
 Pressing a shortcut key from a tab performs that command or it will display more shortcut keys if the 
command has more options available. For example, to use the keyboard to apply the  Merge & Center option 
you would do the following:
 
 1. 
  Press the Alt key then press the  H key to select the Home tab. 
 
 2. 
 Press  M to select the Merge button. 
 
 3. 
 Then press  C to select the Merge & Center option. See Figure  1-18 . 
 Figure 1-17.  Shortcut keys for  Home tab commands 
 Figure 1-18.  Shortcuts for commands under the  Merge & Center category 
 Figure 1-16.  Shortcut keys for Ribbon tabs and the Quick Access  Toolbar 
 
 
 

CHAPTER 1 ■ BECOMING ACQUAINTED WITH EXCEL
15
 
■ Note   Even if the tab is active for the command you want to use, you must still press the Alt key and then 
the shortcut key for the tab. In other words, if the shortcut key isn’t displayed, you can’t use it. 
 You should now be able to use the Ribbon to move around and enter data into the worksheet. The 
Ribbon drives the functionality of the Excel program. 
 Besides using commands from the Ribbon you can select them from a QAT, which is what we’ll cover in 
the next section. 
 Quick Access Toolbar 
 The Quick Access Toolbar provides a quick and convenient place for you to store and access
• 
 the tools that you use most often 
• 
 tools that are not normally found on the Ribbon 
• 
 macros that you create 
 By default, the Quick Access Toolbar shown in Figure  1-19 is located above the Ribbon in the upper left-
hand corner of the Excel window. 
 By default, the QAT displays
• 
  the save button, which uses a diskette for an icon 
• 
  the undo and redo buttons 
• 
 a drop-down button from which you can select other tools to be displayed on the QAT  
 Clicking the drop-down button on the right side of the QAT displays the  Customize Quick Access 
Toolbar from which you can select other buttons to be added to your QAT. See Figure  1-20 . 
 Figure 1-19.  Quick Access  Toolbar 
 

CHAPTER 1 ■ BECOMING ACQUAINTED WITH EXCEL
16
 The QAT can be moved below the Ribbon by selecting the Show Below the Ribbon option from the 
drop-down menu. This may be a better place for it since it will provide more room for additional tools. 
 Switch Between Touch and Mouse Mode 
 Because many monitors today are touch screen, Microsoft has added a  Touch/Mouse Mode button  . This 
button can be added to the QAT by selecting it from the QAT drop-down menu. See Figure  1-20 . Clicking the 
down arrow of the Touch/Mouse Mode button displays the two options shown in Figure  1-21 . 
 Figure 1-20.  Click the drop-down button to select Items to Add to or Remove from the QAT 
 

CHAPTER 1 ■ BECOMING ACQUAINTED WITH EXCEL
17
 The Touch option is for those users who are using touch monitors. Selecting the touch option places 
more space between the Ribbon buttons as shown in Figure  1-22 , making it easier to select the correct 
button with your finger. 
 Figure 1-21.    Options for optimizing Ribbon for using the Mouse or Touch Monitor 
 Figure 1-22.  Ribbon setup for Touch screen  monitors 
 Figure 1-23.  Adding button from Ribbon to the  QAT 
 Changing the Touch/Mouse mode in any of the Microsoft Office products changes it for all the office 
products. 
 You can easily remove a button from the QAT by either right-clicking the button you wish to remove and 
selecting Remove from Quick Access Toolbar or you can click the drop-down button, then click the checked 
item you wish to remove. 
 Your QAT is not limited to the items appearing in the Customize Quick Access Toolbar menu. Buttons 
that are on the Ribbon can be added to the QAT by right-clicking a Ribbon button and then selecting Add to 
Quick Access Toolbar from the menu. See Figure  1-23 . 
 
 
 

CHAPTER 1 ■ BECOMING ACQUAINTED WITH EXCEL
18
 The order in which the buttons appear on the QAT can be rearranged. You can save your QAT 
customization to a file and then later import it into another workbook. 
 Three ways to get to the QAT customizations in the Excel options window are to
• 
 Click the drop-down arrow on the QAT and then select More Commands… 
• 
 Right-click the Ribbon and then select Customize Quick Access Toolbar…  
• 
 Click the File tab on the Ribbon. Select Options. Select Quick Access Toolbar from 
the left side of the Excel Options window. 
 
EXERCISE 1-4: USING THE QUICK ACCESS TOOLBAR
 In this exercise, you will add  command buttons to your QAT.
 1. 
 Click the drop-down button of the Quick Access Toolbar and then select  Print 
Preview and Print from the Customize Quick Access Toolbar menu. 
 2. 
 Click the drop-down button of the Quick Access Toolbar and then select  New . 
 3. 
 Click the drop-down button of the Quick Access Toolbar and then select  Open . 
 The Print Preview and Print, New, and Open buttons have been added to the end of 
your Quick Access Toolbar. See Figure  1-24 . 
 Notice that the tools appear in the order that they were selected. 
 4. 
 Right-click the Print Preview and Print button   
 on the QAT and select  Remove 
from Quick Access Toolbar 
 5. 
 Right-click the QAT and then select  Show Quick Access Toolbar Below the 
Ribbon. 
 6. 
 Click the Review tab on the Ribbon. In the Proofing group, right-click the Spelling 
button and select  Add to Quick Access Toolbar . Your QAT should now appear as 
follows. See Figure  1-25 .

 Identifying the Current  Cell 
 Columns are represented by letters. Rows are represented by numbers. A combination of a column letter 
and a row number gives each cell a unique address. The first cell in a worksheet would have an address of 
A1. A cell that is at the intersection of column G and row 5 would have a cell address of G5. The cell address 
is also called a  cell reference . Individual cells contain text, numbers, or formulas. The result of a formula is 
displayed in the same cell where you inserted the formula. 
 The current (active) cell in Figure  1-26 is B6. The current cell can be identified by the following:
• 
 Its border is bolded. 
• 
 Its column head and row head are highlighted. 
• 
 The address appears in the Name Box. 
• 
 The cell’s value or formula is displayed in the formula bar. 
 Once you’ve identified the current cell, you are ready to start entering your data! 
 Entering Data into a  Worksheet 
 The data you enter in a cell is not accepted until you do one of the following:
• 
 Press the Tab key—cursor moves to the next cell 
• 
 Press the Enter key—cursor moves to the next cell 
• 
 Press any of the arrow keys—cursor moves to the next cell in the direction of the 
arrow. 
• 
 Click the check mark icon on the formula bar—cursor remains in the cell.  
• 
 Pressing Ctrl + Enter—cursor remains in the cell. 
 Figure 1-26.  Different ways of identifying the current  cell 
 

CHAPTER 1 ■ BECOMING ACQUAINTED WITH EXCEL
20
 
■ Note   You can’t format the data in a cell until the data has been accepted. 
 If you want to overwrite all the data in a cell you can click the cell and type the new data. If you only 
want to change part of the data in a cell you need to be in Edit mode. Double-clicking a cell puts it in Edit 
mode; pressing F2 will do the same. As you are typing data in a cell, the data appears in both the active cell 
and the formula bar. Because the data appears in both the cell and the formula bar, making changes in either 
location will update the cell data. 
 
EXERCISE 1-5: ENTERING AND ACCEPTING A CELL ENTRY
 In this exercise, you will enter data in cells and use different options for accepting the entries.
 1. 
 First, enter some column headings and use the Tab key to accept them:
 
 a.  Type  Assets in cell A1. Notice that as you’re typing the text in cell A1 it is also 
being typed into the formula bar. Press the Tab key. 
 
 b.  Type  Cash in cell B1. Press the Tab key. 
 
 c. 
 Type  Supply in cell C1. Press the Tab key. 
 
 d.  Type  Land in cell D1. Press the Enter key. Cell A2 becomes Active, 
 2. 
 Next, type  Liability in cell A2 but don’t press the Tab key. Move your cursor over the 
check mark in the formula bar. If the data in the cell hasn’t been accepted, it will 
change color. See Figure  1-27 . Click the Enter button (the check mark). The data is 
accepted and the button becomes grayed out. See Figure  1-28 . 
 Figure 1-28.  Once the data is accepted the button becomes grayed out 
 Figure 1-27.  Click the Enter button to accept the  data 
 
 

CHAPTER 1 ■ BECOMING ACQUAINTED WITH EXCEL
21
 3. 
 Press the Tab key. 
 4. 
 Type  Loan in cell B2 but don’t press the Tab key. Click the Cancel button  
 on 
the formula bar.  The entry is cleared. Type  Loan in cell B2 again. Press Ctrl + Enter. 
Cell B2 remains the active cell. The cursor is still in cell B2 but you can’t see it.  
 
■ Note Another way to cancel the text you are entering or to clear it even after it has been accepted is to 
move your cursor over the square at the bottom right of the cell (see the cell on the left). The cursor will change 
to cross-hairs. Drag the cursor toward the center of the cell. The text will fade, as in the cell on the right, and 
when you let go of the mouse button the text will be gone. 
 
 5. 
 Press the Tab key. Notice the word  Ready in the bottom left corner of the status bar. 
This means that the cell is ready for you to enter data into. 
 
■ Note If you don’t see the word Ready, then right-click Excel’s Status bar at the bottom of the window and 
select Cell Mode. 
 6. 
 Type  Wages into cell C2. When you start typing text in the cell the word Ready on 
the status bar changes to  Enter . Press the Tab key. 
 7. 
 Double-click inside cell C1. Looking at the bottom left side of the status bar you 
should see that you are in  Edit mode. Change Supply to Supplies. It doesn’t matter if 
you make the change in cell C1 or in the formula bar. Press Enter when you are done.  
 8. 
 Click inside cell A2. Press the F2 key. This is another way of placing the cell in Edit 
mode. Change Liability to Liabilities. Press Ctrl + Enter. 
 9. 
 Click once inside cell D1. Since you didn’t double-click you are not in Edit mode. 
The status bar still shows Ready. Notice that the cursor does not display. Type the 
letter  R . The word Land is cleared from the cell. Finish typing the word Replace. 
Press Ctrl +  Enter . 
 10. 
 Type  Use in cell C5. Press the down arrow key. 
 11. 
 Type  the in cell C6. Press the left arrow key. 
 12. 
 Type  arrow in cell B6. Press the up arrow key. 
 13. 
 Type  keys in cell B5. Press the right arrow key. 
 Getting Help 
 Excel provides help to the user within the program. Screen Tips and the Tell me what you want to do features 
answer questions about formatting and entering data into your worksheet while you are working on it. 
 Smart Lookup enables you to search on cell contents. 

CHAPTER 1 ■ BECOMING ACQUAINTED WITH EXCEL
22
 Screen Tips 
 Screen tips are a quick way of getting snippets of information about the commands on the Ribbon and 
some other objects on the screen.  Screen tips can be viewed by merely moving your cursor over an object. 
The screen tip shows the name of the object and what it does. Some of the screen tips also provide graphic 
illustrations to illustrate what the command does. Figure  1-29 shows a screen tip for the Merge & Center 
button which is located on the Home tab in the Alignment group. If you wanted additional information you 
could click the Tell me more link. 
 Excel’s  Tell Me What You Want to Do Feature 
 This is a new feature for Office 2016; you will also find it in Word and PowerPoint. It is located in the tab area of the 
Ribbon. When you click the text box it displays your most recent requests. You can select one of the requests or 
you can start typing into the text box. Excel displays what is available for the characters you have entered so far. 
 Let’s say that I want help creating a chart. I start by entering a C into the text box. You are probably 
thinking why did the list in Figure  1-30 display items that don’t all start with a C. The reason is that Math &

 CHAPTER 2  
 Navigating and Working with 
Worksheets 
 In this chapter, you’ll learn how to navigate the worksheet using the mouse and keyboard commands. You’ll 
also become familiar with shortcuts that help you move quickly between cells and begin practicing working 
with multiple worksheets within the same workbook. 
 After reading and working through this chapter you’ll be able to
• 
 Move between cells using the keyboard 
• 
 Select cells 
• 
 Work with worksheets 
• 
 Move between worksheets 
 Excel is designed for the beginner to learn and use very quickly. The exercises guide you as you discover 
how to create, enter, and manipulate data using basic functions. Remember, you build each worksheet cell 
by cell to meet your needs. It is easy to make changes as you become familiar with Excel’s features. 
 Moving Between Cells Using the Keyboard 
 Because there are so many cells, you need a quick way to move around the worksheet. Knowing your 
movement keys saves time by getting to the desired cell in the shortest amount of time. Click a cell to make it 
active or use one of the key combinations in Table  2-1  to jump to a particular cell.

 In this section, you’ve learned to use the keyboard to move between cells while entering data. Next, 
you’ll learn how to select cells, first by using a Mouse and then by using a keyboard. 
 Selecting Cells  
 There are several ways to select individual cells, a range of cells, a combination of individual cells and cell 
ranges, and even cells that are nonadjacent to each other. Selecting multiple cells is useful for applying 
formatting to multiple cells at the same time or when creating formulas or deleting or inserting a complete 
row or column. 

CHAPTER 2 ■ NAVIGATING AND WORKING WITH WORKSHEETS
31
 While you are dragging across a block of adjacent cells (see Figure  2-3 ), Excel displays in the Name Box 
how many rows and columns are in that block. The Name Box in Figure  2-3  shows that the block of cells 
spans 3 rows and 2 columns. 
 Selecting Cells Using a Mouse 
 Table  2-2 tells how to select different  worksheet ranges using a  mouse .  
 
EXERCISE 2-3: SELECTING CELLS USING A MOUSE
 In this exercise, you select different ranges of cells. Although we’ll cover formatting in detail later, you 
can get an idea of how to use them in this simple exercise. 
 Selecting Entire Rows or   Columns  
 1. 
 Open the workbook named  Chapter   2 , which you created in the previous exercise . 
 2. 
 Position your cursor on column header B. You will see a down arrow; hold down 
the left mouse button and drag across column head C so that columns B and C are 
both selected. As you are dragging, you will see a box that displays the number of 
rows and columns that are currently selected. See Figure  2-4 .

CHAPTER 2 ■ NAVIGATING AND WORKING WITH WORKSHEETS
34
 
■ Note  Ctrl+A and Ctrl+Shift+spacebar select the entire worksheet if you select a blank cell or a cell that 
doesn’t have an adjacent cell containing data. If you use one of these key combinations with a cell selected that 
does have adjacent cells with data, it selects the block of adjacent cells with data. Don’t worry if this isn’t clear. 
We’ll try both in the following exercises, and you’ll see how they work. 
 
EXERCISE 2-4: SELECTING CELLS USING A KEYBOARD
 Continue using the same workbook from the previous practice. 
 Selecting an Entire    Column  
 Pressing Ctrl + spacebar selects all the cells in the  column of the active cell.
 1. 
 Click in cell D3. 
 2. 
 Hold down the Ctrl key and press the spacebar. 
 Selecting an Entire Row  
 Pressing Shift + spacebar selects all the cells in the  row of the active cell.
 1. 
 Click inside cell C3. 
 2. 
 Hold down the Shift key and press the spacebar. Notice that the B in the Font group 
on the Ribbon is highlighted. This is because you previously bolded this row. Click 
the B again. This turns off the bolding for the row. 
 Selecting  Multiple Columns  
 1. 
 Move your cursor to cell D1. 
 2. 
 Hold down the Shift key while you press the right arrow key twice. This will select 
cells D1, E1, and F1.

 2. 
 Click cell F3. Hold down the Shift key plus the Home key. This selects all cells from 
the current cell to the beginning of the row. 
 3. 
 Click cell F4. Hold down the Shift key plus the Ctrl key plus the Home key. This 
selects everything from the current cell to cell  A1 . 
 Selecting from the Current Cell to the Last   Cell   Containing Data 
 1. 
 Enter 380 in cell J23. Press Ctrl + Home to go to cell A1 
 2. 
 Press Shift + Ctrl + End. This selects all cells between A1 and J23. 
 Selecting an   Entire Worksheet   or All Cells 
 1. 
 Click any blank cell. 
 2. 
 Press Ctrl + A. This selects all the cells in the worksheet. 
 3. 
 Click a blank cell again and press Shift+Ctrl+spacebar for the same result. 
 Selecting an   Entire Block  
 1. 
 Click cell B5. Press Ctrl + A. This selects all the cells in the block. 
 2. 
 Click cell B5. Press Shift+Ctrl+spacebar. 
 3. 
 Click the Save button on the Quick Access  Toolbar . 
 You have learned how to select cells using a mouse and keyboard. Next, you’ll be learning how to select 
cells by entering their cell addresses. 
 Select Cells by Using Their Cell  References in the Name Box 
 Referencing a value in a cell by using its address is called a cell  reference . A reference can be used to identify 
a single cell or a range of cells on the current worksheet or on another worksheet. You can even reference 
cells in other workbooks. A reference to cells in another workbook is called a link. 
 When referencing a range of adjacent cells, the upper left cell address is listed first, followed by a colon, 
and then the lower right cell’s address. The address B3:D5 includes cells B3, C3, D3, B4, C4, D4, B5, C5, and 
D5. See Figure  2-6 . 
 In Table  2-4 the first column specifies the cells to reference and the second column gives an example of 
how to select that reference.  
 Figure 2-6.  The selected range is B3:D5 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ NAVIGATING AND WORKING WITH WORKSHEETS
36
 The cell references can be entered into the Name Box to select those cells. You can enter any 
combination of cell references that are separated by commas in the Name Box then press Enter to select 
those cells. Figure  2-7 shows the result of having pressed Enter after typing  A2, B3:C5,E4:G5 in the Name 
Box. (Note that the first cell in the last range becomes the active  cell .)

EXERCISE 2-5: SELECTING CELLS USING THE NAME BOX
 The previous practices have covered selecting cells using your mouse and your keyboard. In this 
exercise you will practice selecting individual cells, ranges of cells, and rows and columns of cells by 
entering cell addresses in the Name  Box .
 1. 
 Create a new worksheet in your Chapter   2  workbook. 
 2. 
 Enter C12 in the Name Box and then press Enter. Cell C12 should be selected. 
 3. 
 Enter A1:A15 in the Name Box and then press Enter. 
 4. 
 Enter the other cell addresses in the Example column in Table  2-4 . 
 5. 
 Enter  A5, A8, B3:B7, and  D4:F8 in the Name Box then press Enter. 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ NAVIGATING AND WORKING WITH WORKSHEETS
37
 
■ Note If you are entering data in a selected range, the active cell stays within that range when you press the 
Enter key or the Tab key. 
 6. 
 Enter  A8:C10 in the Name Box and then press  Enter . 
 7. 
 It is usually better to enter data across in rows because you can tab across to the next 
cell. When you get to the last cell, press Enter to go to the next row automatically. If 
you prefer to enter data going down one column and then to the next column, you can 
select a range of cells and press the Enter key after each cell  entry .
 a. 
 Type  car in cell A8. Press the Enter key. 
 b. 
 Type  van . Press the Enter key. 
 c. 
 Type  truck . Press the Enter key. 
 d. 
 Type  semi . Press the Enter key. 
 e. 
 Type  bus . Press the Enter key. 
 f. 
 Type  bike . Press the Enter key. 
 g. 
 Type  trike . Press the Enter key. 
 h. 
 Type  train . Press the Enter key. 
 i. 
 Type  skates . Press the Enter key. You now are back at cell A8. 
 8. 
 Reenter the data you entered in each step except this time press the Tab key after 
each entry. 
 In this section you learned how to select cells using their cell reference. Next, you’ll be learning to use 
the  Go To feature to move rapidly to individual cells. This function becomes increasingly important when 
worksheets become very large over time. When your worksheet contains extensive data, you have to be able 
to make quick jumps to work efficiently. 
     Going Directly to Any Cell 
 Excel provides two methods for jumping directly to any cell. One way is to type the cell address into the 
Name box and press Enter. Another way is to use the  Go To feature . 
 Entering the cell address in the Name box is the quicker method, but the Go To feature has the benefit 
in that it stores the cells that you jumped to previously making it easy to jump back and forth between cells. 
 The  Go To feature can be accessed by clicking the Home tab and then, in the Editing group, click the Find 
& Select arrow to see the drop-down menu. See Figure  2-8 . The shortcut for this feature is pressing Ctrl + G.  

CHAPTER 2 ■ NAVIGATING AND WORKING WITH WORKSHEETS
38
 Figure 2-9.  Go  To dialog box 
 Figure 2-8.  Select Go To from the Find & Select button 
 Selecting the Go To… option brings up the Go To dialog box. See Figure  2-9 . 
 To jump to a particular cell, you would type the cell address for the cell you want to go to in the Reference 
area, and then press Enter or Click the OK button. Next, you learn how to work with worksheets. You will learn 
how to select them, rearrange them, and change their tab colors—as well as adding, deleting, and hiding  them  .   
 Worksheets 
 Spreadsheets in Excel are referred to as  worksheets . Individual worksheets are stored together in a  workbook . 
When you save your work in Excel you do not save individual worksheets; rather, you save the workbook. 
Data entered in one worksheet can be entered into other worksheets at the same time. Data can be passed 
between worksheets. Data can also be imported into worksheets from other workbooks or other sources. 
 A workbook can consist of one or more worksheets. The tabs for these worksheets appear at the bottom 
left-hand corner of the screen. Clicking a sheet tab makes that sheet the current worksheet. The current tab 
can be easily identified because its tab text is bolded and has a thick line below the text. 
 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ NAVIGATING AND WORKING WITH WORKSHEETS
39
 In addition to adding and formatting data, following are some of the ways to manipulate worksheets:
• 
 Rename them 
• 
 Add or Remove them 
• 
 Hide and Unhide them 
• 
 Reorder them 
• 
 Copy them to the same workbook 
• 
 Copy or Move them to another workbook 
 Naming Worksheets 
 If you add a second worksheet it would be  named Sheet2 by default. If you add a third worksheet it would be 
named Sheet3 by default, and so on. These names are not helpful because they don’t provide any clue as to 
what is on the worksheet, but fortunately you can rename them to something more meaningful. 
 There are two ways to rename a  worksheet :
• 
 Right-click a sheet tab and select Rename. This will highlight the tab you right-
clicked (see Figure  2-11a ) and put the tab text in edit mode in which you can type 
over the current text.(see Figure  2-11b ). 
• 
  Double-clicking a sheet tab will also put the tab text in edit mode. 
 Figure 2-10.  Worksheet tabs 
 Figure 2-11.  a) The tab  name is in Edit mode, and b) the tab has been renamed  
 Adding and Removing Worksheets 
 You can add new worksheets to your workbooks or remove them. 
 Worksheets can be added by doing one of the following.
• 
 Clicking the  New Sheet button  
 . Clicking the New Sheet button adds the new 
worksheet after the currently selected worksheet. 
• 
 Right-click a worksheet tab and select Insert, which displays the  Insert dialog box 
(see Figure  2-12 ). Select Worksheet and click OK to add a blank worksheet.  
 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ NAVIGATING AND WORKING WITH WORKSHEETS
40
 You also can use add a prebuilt worksheet known as a template. Click Spreadsheet Solutions to see the 
 available templates (see Figure  2-13 ). There are some very nice templates available on the Spreadsheets 
Solution tab. There is a Blood Pressure Tracker, a Personal Monthly Budget template, a Loan Amortization 
template, and so on. Click a template to view it in the Preview area. Double-clicking one of these templates 
adds it as a worksheet in your workbook. 
 Figure 2-12.  Select  Worksheet from the  Insert dialog box to add a blank worksheet 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ NAVIGATING AND WORKING WITH WORKSHEETS
41
 A worksheet can be  removed by right-clicking its tab and selecting Delete. 
 Changing a Worksheet Tab Color 
 You can make the different tabs easily distinguishable by making them different colors. You can change 
the background color of each  tab by right-clicking a tab, selecting Tab Color, and then selecting a color. 
See Figure  2-14 . 
 Figure 2-13.  Available templates 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ NAVIGATING AND WORKING WITH WORKSHEETS
42
 Selecting Multiple Worksheets 
 You can  select multiple  worksheets by holding the down Ctrl key while you click the worksheet tabs. You 
can select multiple adjacent worksheets by clicking the first worksheet tab you want to use and then holding 
down the Shift key and clicking the last worksheet tab you want to use. 
 Hiding and Unhiding Worksheets 
 You can hide a worksheet by right-clicking its tab and selecting Hide from the menu.  Hiding doesn’t delete 
the worksheet or change it in any way. You can bring back any worksheets you have hidden by right-clicking 
any of the worksheet tabs and selecting Unhide… The Unhide dialog box displays all of the worksheets you 
have hidden. To Unhide a worksheet just select the worksheet you want to redisplay and click the OK button. 
See Figure  2-15 . 
 Figure 2-15.  Select worksheets to  Unhide 
 Figure 2-14.  Select a worksheet  tab color 
 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ NAVIGATING AND WORKING WITH WORKSHEETS
43
 Reordering and Copying Worksheets 
 You can change the order of the worksheets by dragging and dropping their tabs to where you want them 
placed. When you drag a worksheet tab the cursor displays as a document. A down arrow    
 moves as you 
drag indicating where the worksheet will be placed when you let go of the mouse button. See Figure  2-16 . 
 Another way to change the  order of the worksheets is to right-click the tab of the worksheet you wish 
to move and then select Move or Copy from the context menu. The Move or Copy dialog box displays all of 
the sheets in your workbook. You can either select which sheet you want to place it before or you can select 
(move to end) to make it the last worksheet in your workbook. See Figure  2-17 . 
 The  Move or Copy dialog  box has a check box option for creating a copy of the worksheet. Selecting 
this option will make a duplicate worksheet of the one you right-clicked and it will place the new copy in the 
location you specify in the  Before sheet : area of the dialog box. Excel names the new copy the name of the 
original sheet plus it adds a number of the copy in parentheses. Figure  2-18 shows that a copy of Sheet1 was 
moved to the end and named Sheet1 (2). If another copy was made of Sheet1 it would be named Sheet1 (3). 
You can also rename the copied worksheets to something more meaningful. 
 Figure 2-16.  Drag a worksheet to a new location

 Figure 2-18.  Excel adds a number to the end of the name of the copied worksheet 
 
 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ NAVIGATING AND WORKING WITH WORKSHEETS
44
 
■ Note  You can also move or copy worksheets to a different workbook. 
 Using Tab  Buttons to Move Through the Worksheets 
 If there are dots to the left of the worksheet tabs this means that there are more worksheets to the left of those 
currently showing. These dots are called ellipsis. If there is an ellipsis to the right of the worksheet tabs this 
means that there are more worksheets to the right of those currently showing. See Figure  2-19 . 
 Clicking the Next worksheet button displays the tab for the next worksheet giving the result as shown in 
Figure  2-20 . 
 Clicking the Previous worksheet button twice at this point takes me back two worksheet tabs. Since this 
is the first worksheet, the Previous worksheet button is grayed out and the ellipsis is no longer displayed. See 
Figure  2-21 . 
 If you want more room for displaying the worksheet tabs you can drag the separator bar to the right. 
 If you move your cursor over either the Previous or Next worksheet button a tooltip displays available 
options. See Figure  2-22 .

 20.  Next, you will copy a worksheet, but before you copy the worksheet you need to 
enter some data into the worksheet being copied to verify that the copy worked. 
Click the  Qtr1 Expenses tab. Enter some data in several cells. Right-click the 
 Qtr1 Expenses tab. Select Move or Copy. This brings up the Move or Copy dialog 
box. In the  Before sheet: area select Qtr1 Sales. Check the  Create a copy at the 
bottom of the dialog box. See Figure  2-27 . Click OK.  
 Worksheets  Qtr1 Expenses and  Qtr1 Expenses (2) should contain the same data.  
 21.  Save the workbook as  Chapter2Tabs . 
 As you learn more about worksheet functions and options, think about how you will use the data. As 
you go through this book, you’ll learn more about planning and designing workbooks and worksheets to 
meet your present and future needs. 
 Summary 
 You’ve learned a quick way to move around worksheets and how to use special keyboard shortcuts to 
jump to different cells. You’ve also worked with creating and customizing multiple worksheets within one 
workbook. In Chapter   3  you’ll create different types of data and learn how to insert special characters and 
adjust the size of columns and rows. Included are shortcuts for entering the data to help you continue to use 
Excel in the way that best suits your needs.

 CHAPTER 3  
 Best Ways to Enter and Edit Data 
 In this chapter, you’ll learn how Excel worksheets use three types of data: text, numeric, and date and time. 
It is important to understand the different types of data. You’ll also begin using special characters that you 
can’t find on the keyboard. 
 Excel has several tools and features to make your data entry quick, efficient, and in the format you want. 
Excel automatically determines how data is aligned based on the type of data you enter. The data you enter 
can be formatted by using various text, numeric, and data formats. If the data you enter doesn’t fit in the cell 
the way you want, you can adjust the column widths and row heights. 
 Excel’s AutoCorrect feature can be useful for correcting commonly misspelled words, misuse of 
capitalization, entering special symbols that can’t be directly entered from the keyboard, and creating 
shortcuts for entering often used words or phrases. 
 The  AutoComplete and  Pick from Drop-down List  features allow you to easily duplicate existing 
column values. AutoFill can be used to create duplicate cells, enter a series of values, create a custom list, or 
use a pattern that you taught it. 
 After reading and working through this chapter you should be able to
• 
 Create the three types of data 
• 
 Insert special characters 
• 
 Change column widths and row heights 
• 
 Correct typing mistakes 
• 
 Use AutoCorrect to make corrections and to create shortcuts for entering words or 
phrases 
• 
 Use AutoComplete to enter data 
• 
 Use Pick from Drop-down List to enter data 
• 
 Use AutoFill to create duplicate cells and create a series 
• 
 Create a custom list 
 Data Types 
 There are three types of data that can be entered into a cell: text, numeric, and date and time.
• 
 Text data .  Text data is also known as string data. The data can consist of a 
combination of letters, numbers, and some symbols. Text data is left-justified in a 
cell. You can’t use text data in a formula. 
• 
 Numeric data . A  numeric cell can only contain the characters shown in Figure  3-1 . 

CHAPTER 3 ■ BEST WAYS TO ENTER AND EDIT DATA
50
 If any other character or even a space is included in the cell, Excel treats the data 
as text. Only cells that contain numeric values can be used in a formula. Numeric 
data is right-justified in the cell. 
• 
 Date and time data .  Date and time data can be used for handling dates, time, or 
a combination of the two. You can enter a date as  January 16, 2005 or  01/16/05 
or  01-16-2005 , but how the date appears in the cell depends on how the cell is 
formatted. Date and time data, like numeric data, is right-justified in a cell. 
 
■ Note  If you enter a date as  January 15 2010 Excel will display it as text rather than a date because there 
is nothing to identify it as a date. If you place a comma after the day, Excel will be able to identify it as a date 
and right justify it. 
 The first column in Figure  3-2 shows exactly what text was entered into the cell; the second column 
shows how that entry would be displayed in Excel. You could change how the date is displayed by changing 
its formatting which we will look at in a later chapter. 
 Figure 3-1.    Only these numbers and characters can be used in a numeric value 
 Figure 3-2.  Date entered in a cell and how it’s displayed 
 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ BEST WAYS TO ENTER AND EDIT DATA
51
 
■ Note  When you are entering time into a cell, be sure to place a space between the time and entering AM 
or PM. The time should be entered as  11:35 AM rather than  11:35AM . If you make the entry without the space, 
the time will be treated as text data and it will be left-justified in the cell. See Figure  3-3 . You will not be able to 
perform date and time functions on dates and times that are treated as text. 
 
EXERCISE 3- 1: PRACTICE ENTERING DIFFERENT TYPES OF DATA
 In this exercise, create a new workbook and enter different kinds of data.
 1. 
 Start Excel program. Create a new workbook named Chapter   3 . 
 2. 
 Type  5 Text in cell A1. Press the Tab key. Because it is text, it stays left-aligned. 
 3. 
 Type  12.75 in cell B1. Press the Tab key. Because it is numeric it moves to the right 
of the cell. 
 4. 
 Type  2/13 in cell C1. Press the Tab key. Because it is a date it is right-aligned. 
 5. 
 Type  12:15 PM in cell D1. Press the Tab key. Because it is a time it is right-aligned. 
 6. 
 Type  5:10AM in cell E1. Press the Tab key. Because you entered time without a 
space before AM, Excel left-aligned the time because Excel thinks it is text. 
 7. 
 Type  March 3 2014 in cell F1. Press the Tab key. Because you entered a date without 
a comma after the day, Excel left-aligned the date because Excel thinks it is text.  
 8. 
 Change the name on the Sheet1 tab to  Data Types 
 9. 
 Save the Workbook. 
 Inserting Special Characters 
 If you want to enter a  character that isn’t available on your keyboard, you can use one of Excel’s symbols such as 
the  greater than or  equal to sign (≥) or the  less than or  equal to sign  (≤). The special characters can be accessed 
by clicking the Ribbon’s Insert tab and then in the Symbols group click the Symbol button. See Figure  3-4 .  
 Figure 3-3.    Entering time without a space makes it a text entry rather than a date 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ BEST WAYS TO ENTER AND EDIT DATA
52
 The  Symbol dialog box has two tabs, one for symbols and the other for special characters. The Special 
Characters tab displays commonly used symbols such as the copyright, trademark, different styles of closing 
quotes, and so on. The Symbols tab contains many more special characters, and that will be our focus in this 
section. 
 The symbols that are available on the Symbols tab depend on the selected font. Different fonts have 
different symbols that they can create. Some fonts have a lot more available symbols than others. For 
example, the generic (normal text) option, shown in Figure  3-5 , provides a very large selection of characters.  
 The Recently used symbols list displays the last 36 symbols that you have used. You can insert one of the 
symbols or special characters into a cell by clicking it and then clicking the Insert button. 
 Figure 3-4.  Symbol button is located in the Ribbon’s Symbols group 
 Figure 3-5.    Use this when you need to enter a character not available on your keyboard 
 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ BEST WAYS TO ENTER AND EDIT DATA
53
 Clicking the Insert button places the selected symbol in the current cell but it doesn’t close the Symbol 
dialog box. This allows you to enter multiple symbols in the same cell without having to reopen the Symbol 
dialog box. You may have to move the Symbol dialog box if it is obstructing the view of the cell in which you 
are entering a symbol or special character. 
 Clicking the down arrow to the right of the  from: drop-down box reveals three categories of symbols to 
select from. See Figure  3-6 . 
 
■ Note  The three options in Figure  3-6 are different ways your computer can represent data. 
 Unicode stands for Universal Code. Unicode code can display over 16,000 symbols. It is used to represent all 
the symbols from all the languages around the  world . 
 ASCII stands for American Standard Code of Information  Interchange . The ASCII format of creating symbols 
has been around for a long time. It is capable of creating up to 256 different symbols. It uses symbols from the 
United States and Western Europe. 
 ASCII(hex) codes are hexadecimal. They can use numbers from 0 to 15 
 The  Character code is the numeric representation for the symbol you select. The  Character code      will be 
different for the same symbol depending upon whether it is in a decimal or hexadecimal format. If you know 
the character code for the symbol you wish to use, you can enter it to select the symbol. 
 
EXERCISE 3-2: ENTER SPECIAL CHARACTERS
 In this exercise, you add special characters to a spreadsheet. If you have closed the Chapter   3 workbook 
from the last practice, reopen it.
 1. 
 Create a new worksheet. Rename the worksheet tab “Special Characters.” 
 2. 
 Click cell B2. On the Ribbon, click the Insert tab. In the Symbols group, click the 
Symbol button. 
 3. 
 Select  normal text from the  Font drop-down box, and then select ASCII (Decimal) 
from the  from drop-down list in the bottom right corner of the dialog box. Increase 
the size of the Symbol dialog box until you can see all the symbols without having 
to scroll. 
 4. 
 Click the  ½ symbol. Notice the  Character code for the  ½ symbol is 189. Click the 
Insert button. Move the Symbol dialog box so that you can see cell B2. 
 Figure 3-6.  Categories of  symbols 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ BEST WAYS TO ENTER AND EDIT DATA
54
 
■ Note Unfortunately you can’t select another cell in your spreadsheet and then insert another symbol. You 
must first close the Symbol dialog box, select another cell, and then reopen the Symbol dialog box. 
 5. 
 Click the Close button on the Symbol dialog box. 
 6. 
 Type  25 in cell C2. Don’t press Enter. We will add a ¢ after the 25. 
 7. 
 In the Symbols group on the Ribbon, click the Symbol button. Drag across (normal 
text) in the Font drop-down box if it isn’t already highlighted. Type  Ti then press the 
Tab key. This will display the symbols for the Times New Roman font. Click the ¢ 
symbol then click the Insert button. Move the Symbol dialog box so that you can 
see cell C2. 
 8. 
 Click the down arrow of the  from drop-down box and select Unicode (Hex). You’ll 
see a lot more symbols. Click the different symbols; as you do, notice that some of 
the symbols have a letter such A, B, C, D, E, or F in their character code. 
 
■ Note When you selected Unicode (Hex) a  Subset drop-down box appeared in the upper right-hand corner. 
Click some of the different subsets. 
 9. 
 Close the Symbol dialog box. 
 10. 
 Click cell D2. In the Symbols group on the Ribbon click the Symbol button. Click the 
 ½ symbol in the  Recently used symbols . Click the Insert button. 
 11. 
 Click the  Special Characters tab in the Symbol dialog box. Double-click the 
Copyright symbol. Double-clicking a symbol does the same thing as clicking it and 
then clicking the Insert button. Move the Symbol dialog box so that you can see cell 
D2. Cell D2 should contain  ½© . 
 12. 
 Click the Symbols tab. Click the down arrow for the  Font drop-down box. Select 
Webdings. This font contains some images that you might find useful. Also look at 
the Wingdings, Wingdings2, and Wingdings3 fonts. 
 13. 
 Close the Symbol dialog box. 
 14. 
 Click cell E2. You can enter most of the ASCII symbols directly into a cell if you 
remember the character code. To enter a symbol directly into a cell you would hold 
down the Alt key while you entered the character code on the numeric keypad. The 
character code can only be entered on the numeric keypad. Make sure the Num 
Lock key is on before you start entering the number. 
 15. 
 Remember that the Character code for the  ½ symbol is 189. Hold down the Alt key, 
type  0189 , and then release the Alt key. You should see the  ½ symbol. The extra 0 
was needed to make it a four-character number. 
 16. 
 Click the Save button  
 on the Quick Access Toolbar (QAT).

 How to Change Column Widths 
 When the text you type is longer than the width of the  column , the overflow characters are displayed in the 
adjacent cell(s) to the right if they do not contain any data. The characters may appear to be a part of the 
adjacent cells but they are not stored there. They are stored in the cell in which you entered them. In the 
following example, the name Anthony Bradtmueller displays across cells A3, B3, and C3 but the entire name 
is actually only stored in cell A3. See Figure  3-7 . 
 Figure 3-7.  Text overflow in next  cell 
 Figure 3-8.  Text is  hidden by text in next cell 
 Figure 3-9.  # signs mean the column isn’t wide enough to display all the data 
 If there are overflow characters and the adjacent cell to the right is not empty, then by default the 
overflow characters are hidden as illustrated in Figure  3-8 . 
 If you are entering numeric data, the column will automatically expand to fit the size of the number. 
If the number that you are entering is the longest value in the column and it contains a decimal, then the 
decimal value may not be shown in the cell. If you change the width of a column that contains numeric data, 
cells in that column will no longer automatically adjust to the size of any new entries. If a cell in a column 
that has had its size changed contains numeric data that is longer than the width of the cell, the cell will 
display # signs instead of the numeric values. See Figure  3-9 . 
 
 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ BEST WAYS TO ENTER AND EDIT DATA
56
 The sight of all these  # signs always puts new users into a panic. They think that something is horribly 
wrong with their spreadsheet. 
 If you click a cell that contains # signs, the actual value will be displayed in the formula bar. Just 
remember when you see # signs in a column the simple cure is to expand the width of the column. 
 If you enter a very large number into a cell you may see something like  
 . This is  exponential 
notation  . If you would rather view the value as a long number you can select the cell, click the Number 
Format’s drop-down arrow located on the Home tab and then select which format you want the exponential 
format converted to. See Figure  3-10 . The number will probably be too big to display in the cell; therefore 
you will need to widen the column width to view the number.  
 Figure 3-10.    You can convert  exponential notation   values to one of these formats       
 Figure 3-11.  Check column width 
 You can view the column width by holding down your left mouse button while your cursor is on the line 
between the column headings (the cursor will turn into a double arrow). The default column width is 8.43 
this allows for about 8 or 9 characters provided you are using the default font type of Calibri and font size of 
11. See Figure  3-11 . 
 Column widths can be changed by using the mouse to drag the column to the desired size. Expanding 
a column width can be accomplished by holding down your left mouse button while your cursor is on the 
line between the column heads, when the column width is displayed drag the line to the right to the desired 
width. As you drag, Excel shows you the width as well as a dotted vertical line that provides a visual clue as to 
where the column border will be changed to. See Figure  3-12 . 
 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ BEST WAYS TO ENTER AND EDIT DATA
57
 The column width can be shrunk as well as expanded. Drag the double arrow to the left to shrink the 
size of the column. 
 You can also change a column’s width by performing the following steps:
 
 1. 
 Right-click a column head and then select Column Width. The Column Width 
dialog box opens (see Figure  3-13 ). 
 Figure 3-12.     Adjust   column width       
 Figure 3-13.  Changing column width 
 
 2. 
 Enter the desired width. You can enter any value between 0 and 255. Entering a 
width of 0 makes the selected column(s) hidden. 
 
 3. 
 Click OK. 
 The Column Width  dialog box can also be accessed by clicking the Home tab and then in the Cells 
group click the Format button and then select Column Width. See Figure  3-14 . 
 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ BEST WAYS TO ENTER AND EDIT DATA
58
 Automatically  Resize Column Widths to Fit Number of Characters in 
the Cell 
 You can have Excel automatically adjust the size of the columns to fit the number of characters in the cell. 
This can be accomplished by selecting the column heads for those columns whose width you wish to change 
and then double-clicking between any of the column heads of the selected columns. You can also perform an 
AutoFit by right-clicking any of the selected columns and then selecting  AutoFit Column Width from the menu.  
 Changing the Column Width for Multiple Columns 
 You can change the column width for more than one column at a time. The only difference between the 
methods used for adjusting the width of  multiple columns vs. a single column is that you need to select the 
column heads for all the columns whose width you want to change. The column heads you select do not 
need to be adjacent to each other. The following steps are an example of how to change the width of  multiple 
columns   at the same time.
 
 1. 
 Drag across the column heads of the columns whose width you wish to change. 
 Figure  3-15 shows that column heads D, E, and F have been selected. Selecting a 
column head selects the entire column.  
 Figure 3-14.    Select column width from  format button         
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ BEST WAYS TO ENTER AND EDIT DATA
59
 
 2. 
 Place your cursor between any of the selected column headings. The cursor will 
turn into a double arrow as shown in Figure  3-15 . Hold down the left mouse 
button and drag it to the right to expand all of the selected columns or drag it to 
the left to shrink all of the selected columns. 
 Now, let’s apply some of the things learned in this section. 
 
EXERCISE 3-4: CHANGING COLUMN WIDTHS 
 In this exercise, you create a new worksheet, create columns of data, and then modify the widths of 
those columns. If you have closed the Chapter   3  workbook from the last practice, reopen it.
 1. 
 Create a new worksheet. Rename the worksheet tab “Column Widths.” 
 2. 
 Enter the Table  3-1 data into the worksheet starting in cell A1.  Do not adjust the 
column widths.  
 Figure 3-15.  The entire columns are  selected 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ BEST WAYS TO ENTER AND EDIT DATA
60
 After entering the data your worksheet should look like Figure  3-16 . 
 3. 
 Place your cursor between column heads A and B. Drag your cursor to the right 
until the width is 16.43. See Figure  3-17 . 
 4. 
 Place your cursor between column heads A and B. Drag your cursor back to the left 
until the width is 7. The text in column A is now partially hidden by the text in column B.  
 5. 
 Right-click column head A and then select Column Width. Enter 8.43 for the column 
width. Click OK. 
 6. 
 Drag across column heads A, B, and C to select all three columns. 
 7. 
 Double-click between column heads B and C. Columns A, B, and C adjust to just fit 
the longest text in their columns as shown in Figure  3-18 .

 8. 
 With column heads A, B, and C still selected, click the Ribbon’s Home tab. In the 
Cells group click the Format button. Select  Column Width . 
 9. 
 In the Column Width dialog box, enter 20 and click the OK button. The three 
columns should each have a column width of 20. 
 10. 
 Click the Format button again. Select  AutoFit Column Width . Columns A, B, and C 
adjust to just fit the longest text in their columns. 
 11. 
 Click the Save button  
 on the Quick Access Toolbar. 
 Now that you have learned to adjust the column width, you’ll learn how to change the height of the row 
so that you can view all of the text in a cell. 
 How to Change Row Heights 
 Changing the height of a row works the same as changing the width of a column. The row height is 15.00 by 
 default . 
 Changing row heights is accomplished by selecting the row or rows whose height you want to change. 
You select rows the same way you select columns: click the number for a specific row, drag on the numbers to 
select adjacent rows, or select nonadjacent rows by holding down the Ctrl key while clicking the row numbers 
(see Figure  3-19 ). After you have made your row selections, place the cursor between the row head of one of 
the selected rows and another row head then drag down to expand the height of the row or up to shrink it.  
 Figure 3-18.  Columns adjusted to fit longest column text 
 Figure 3-19.  Select rows and then drag up or down to change the height of the selected rows 
 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ BEST WAYS TO ENTER AND EDIT DATA
62
 Double-clicking the line between the numbers for the selected rows adjusts the height of the row to 
accommodate the tallest text or object in that row. 
 Another way to change the row height is to follow these steps:
 
 1. 
 Select the row or rows that you want to change 
 
 2. 
 On the Home tab, in the Cells group, click Format. 
 
 3. 
 From the menu you can select Row Height or Autofit Row Height.     
 You can select all of the rows in a spreadsheet by clicking the Select All button. You can then adjust the 
height of all rows by dragging up or down between any row headers. The Select All button is located to the 
Left of the Column A header and above the row 1 header. See Figure  3-20 .  
 
EXERCISE 3-5: CHANGING ROW HEIGHTS
 This exercise uses the same spreadsheet you created for practicing changing column widths. If you 
have closed the Chapter   3  workbook from the last practice, reopen it.
 1. 
 First we’ll create a copy of the Column Widths worksheet:
 a. 
 Right-click the  Column Widths worksheet tab. Select  Move or Copy . 
 b. 
 In the Move or Copy dialog box, click (move to end) in the Before sheet list box. 
 c. 
 Click the Create a Copy check box and then click the OK button. 
 d.

 You’ve learned how to adjust cell sizes by changing row heights and column widths. Next, you will learn 
how to correct data entry errors. 
 Correcting Typing Mistakes 
 Sometimes you make errors when entering data into a worksheet. If you do, it is easy to clear or correct what 
you entered. There are several ways to clear or correct either some or all of the data from a cell. Let’s look 
at how to remove or change specific characters in a cell, how to clear data (and restore a cell to its previous 
state) before accepting your data entry, and how to clear a cell for which you have accepted the entry. 
     Changing Specific Characters 
 If you need to correct  specific characters in a cell, you have a couple of options depending on which 
characters they are and whether you have already accepted the data entry. First, you delete the character or 
characters you want to change and then type in the correct characters if necessary. Here are several ways to 
delete specific characters in a cell:
• 
 While still entering data in a cell, you can delete the last character or characters you 
entered by pressing the Backspace key. 
• 
 If you need to correct a character other than the last one(s) you typed, click just to 
the right of that character and press Backspace.  
• 
 If you have already accepted the data in the cell, double-click in the cell to enter Edit 
mode and then click to the right of the character you want to change or use the left 
and right arrow keys to move the cursor to the character you want to delete.    
 You can correct typing mistakes by doing any of the following:
• 
  Remove the latest characters that you entered by pressing the Backspace key. 
• 
 Clear an entry before it has been accepted by pressing the Esc(ape) key. 
• 
  Clear an entry before it has been accepted by clicking the Cancel button on the 
formula bar. 
• 
  Clear the contents of a cell that has already been accepted by right-clicking a cell and 
selecting Clear Contents. 
 If you only need to remove the latest characters that you entered, you can use the Backspace key.         
 Returning a Cell to Its Original Value 
 You can restore a  cell to its original value if you have not yet accepted the data entry or if you have accepted it 
but have not yet done anything else. 
 While you are still entering data in a cell, you can clear what you’ve entered and restore the cell to its 
previous state. If it was an empty cell, you simply clear all the data. On the other hand, if you changed the 
value in the cell, you clear the new entry and restore the cell’s original value. Use either of the following 
techniques to restore a cell to its previous value before the new value has been accepted:
• 
 Press the Esc(cape) key 
• 
 Click the Cancel button  
 on the formula bar    

CHAPTER 3 ■ BEST WAYS TO ENTER AND EDIT DATA
64
 If you have already accepted the new data entry but have not yet done anything else in the workbook, 
you can select the Undo button on the QAT (see Figure  3-21 ) or press Ctrl + Z, which restores the cell to its 
previous state: empty or containing the previous value.  
 Clearing the Contents of a Cell That Has Already Been  Accepted 
 You can clear the contents of a cell by right-clicking the  cell and then selecting Clear Contents. You can also 
select Clear Contents by clicking the Ribbon’s Home tab and then selecting Clear > Clear Contents in the 
Editing group. 
 
EXERCISE 3-6: ENTERING AND EDITING DATA
 In this exercise, you enter data in a new worksheet and then edit it. If you have closed the Chapter   3  
workbook from the last practice, reopen it.
 1. 
 Add another worksheet and name it  Edit Data . 
 2. 
 Enter the data in Figure  3-22 . For the date values in column C, let’s use three 
different formats:
 a. 
 Enter the data in cell C2 as 10/15/1999. 
 b. 
 Enter the data in cell C3 as 6-15-2001. 
 c. 
 Enter the data in cell C4 as Jan 31, 2005. 
 3. 
 Drag across column heads A, B, and C. Right-click one of the selected column 
heads. Select Column Width. Enter 14. Click the OK button. 
 4. 
 Double-click cell A2 to enter Edit mode. Change 300 to 550. Press Enter.

 5. 
 Click cell B5. Press F2 to enter Edit mode. Change the word Rdige to Ridge. Press 
Enter. 
 6. 
 Double-click cell C2. Change the date in the formula bar to 10/15/2002. Click the 
Enter button (check mark)   
 in the formula bar to accept the change rather than 
pressing Enter. 
 7. 
 Double-click cell C3. Change the year to 1998 but don’t press Enter. You decide 
you really didn’t want to make that change. Press the Escape key to return the cell 
to its original value. Repeat this step again but instead of pressing the Esc key click 
the Cancel button  
 on the formula bar. 
 8. 
 Right-click cell A6. Select  Clear Contents from the menu. 
 9. 
 Click cell B6. Click the Home tab. In the editing group select Clear > Clear Contents. 
 10. 
 Click the Save button  
 on the Quick Access Toolbar. 
 You have learned how to handle any keying errors that you have made. Now, you’ll look at Excel features 
that not only prevent you from making data entry errors but at the same time increase the speed of entering 
the data.   
 Shortcuts for Entering and Correcting Data 
 Excel provides the AutoComplete, Pick data from drop-down list, AutoFill, and AutoCorrect methods to 
speed up data entry and ensure that your data has been entered without errors. 
 Using the AutoCorrect Feature 
 Excel’s  AutoCorrect feature can speed data entry as well as help prevent errors from being entered into your 
worksheet by automatically adjusting entries or by fixing common typing errors as they are being entered. 
Excel’s AutoCorrect feature is useful for the four following situations:
• 
 Correcting commonly misspelled words. If you spell the word “achieved” as 
“acheived” Excel will automatically correct it.  
• 
 Entering special symbols that can’t be directly entered from your keyboard. If you type 
 (tm) Excel will automatically convert it to the trade symbol ™. 
• 
 Creating shortcuts for entering words or phrases that you enter often.  You could enter 
your initials and Excel would convert it to your full name.  
• 
 Misuse of capitalization. If you type  monday , Excel corrects it to Monday.    
 
■ Note   Microsoft office applications share the same AutoCorrect Options as Excel; therefore any changes, 
additions, or deletions you make to the AutoCorrect options in Excel will affect those in other Microsoft office 
applications and vice versa. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ BEST WAYS TO ENTER AND EDIT DATA
66
 
EXERCISE 3-7: USING AUTOCORRECT
 In this exercise, you experience Excel’s default AutoCorrect functionality and then look at how you can 
modify it for your own preferences. If you have closed the Chapter   3 workbook from the last practice, 
reopen it.
 1. 
 Add another worksheet and name it   AutoCorrect . 
 2. 
 In cell A1 type  abbout then press the Tab key. Excel corrects it to about 
 3. 
 In cell B1 type  (c) then press the Tab key. Excel converts (c) to a copyright symbol 
 4. 
 In cell C1 type  (r) then press the Tab key. Excel converts (r) to a registered symbol. 
 5. 
 In cell D1 type your name starting with two capital letters such as DAvid and then 
press the Tab key. 
 Your results should look similar to those in Figure  3-23 . 
 Add Items   to the AutoCorrect List  
 Now that you’ve seen how AutoCorrect works by default, you can add new items to AutoCorrect: 
 1. 
 On the Ribbon click the File tab. 
 2. 
 Click  Options in the left pane. This opens Excel Options. See Figure  3-24 . 
 Figure 3-23.  Results of using AutoCorrect

This brings up the  AutoCorrect dialog box . See Figure  3-25 . 
 Figure 3-24.  Excel  Options 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ BEST WAYS TO ENTER AND EDIT DATA
68
 You can see that there is an option for  Correct Two Initial Capitals. This is what corrected 
your name entry. There are also options for capitalizing the first letter of sentences, names 
of days, and correcting the accidental use of the  Caps Lock key . 
 Look at the bottom half of the tab, there is a two-column table. The left column has a 
heading of  Replace : and the right column has a heading of  With : Entries in the Replace: 
column are replaced with those in the With: column. You used three entries in the table. You 
entered (c) in a cell and it was replaced with the copyright symbol  © . You entered (r) and it 
was replaced with the registered symbol ®. If you scroll down in the table you can see that 
 abbout will be replaced with  about which you have already done. 
 5. 
 Scroll through the table and see what other corrections are available. 
 6. 
 Enter  tommorrow in the Replace text box. Enter  tomorrow in the With text box. 
Click the Add button. The new AutoCorrect item is added to the list. See Figure  3-26 .   
 Figure 3-25.  AutoCorrect dialog box with AutoCorrect tab selected

 7. 
 Type your initials in the Replace text box over the existing text. Enter your full name 
in the With text box over the existing text. Click the Add button. 
 8. 
 Enter phoneA in the Replace text box. Enter (380)599-1275 in the With text box. Click the 
Add button. You could make phone numbers for your home phone and your cell phone.  
 9. 
 Enter any other corrections or shortcuts you would like to make. This could be a big 
time saver. If you often enter your company name, you should create a shortcut for 
it or any other text that you use often. 
 10. 
 Click the OK button in the AutoCorrect dialog box. Click the Cancel button in the 
Excel Options dialog box. 
 11. 
 Type  tommorrow in cell A2 then press the Enter key—Replaced with tomorrow 
 12. 
 Type your initials in cell A3 then press the Enter key—Replaced with your full name 
 13. 
 Type  phoneA in cell A4 then press the Enter key—Replaced with (380)599-1275 
 14. 
 Put your Caps Lock on. Hold down your shift key while typing an  E . Let go of your 
shift key and type  xcel . Cell A5 should now contain eXCEL. Press the Enter key. 
 Cell A5 should now contain Excel. This was corrected by the  Correct Accidental use of cAPS LOCK 
key option. 
 Figure 3-26.  The new  AutoCorrect item has been added

 Delete items   from the AutoCorrect    list 
 1. 
 On the Ribbon, click the File tab. 
 2. 
 Click Options in the left pane. 
 3. 
 Click Proofing in the left pane of Excel Options. 
 4. 
 In the right pane, click the  AutoCorrect Options button. 
 5. 
 Type  phoneA in the Replace text box; as you do so the list will jump to the letters 
you are entering. When phoneA is highlighted in the list, press the Delete button. 
 6. 
 Remove the shortcut you created for your initials. Remove any other shortcuts you 
created that you want deleted. 
 7. 
 Click the Close button on the AutoCorrect dialog box. Click the Cancel button on the 
Excel Options dialog box. 
 8. 
 Click the Save button  
 on the Quick Access Toolbar. 
 You have just used Excel’s AutoCorrect feature to correct misspelled words and to create quick shortcuts 
for entering words or phrases. Next you will use the AutoComplete feature to duplicate data that already 
exists in the column. 
 Using AutoComplete to Enter Data 
 The  AutoComplete feature is automatically set up; there are no buttons to click or commands to be entered. 
The AutoComplete feature compares the entry you are making to entries that already exist in the same 
column. As you are typing your entry, Excel looks for a word that starts with the same letters as the word you 
are entering. If it finds an existing word in the column that starts with the same letters you have entered so 
far, it places that word in the active cell. See Figure  3-27 
 Figure 3-27.    AutoCorrect automatically added the letters rt after you typed the letters sma 
 The first two letters are the same for all words in the column. When you type the letter  a in the second 
entry for the word  smart , Excel sees that there is only one word that starts with  sma so it places the word 
 smart in the cell. You can accept the word by pressing the Enter key, the tab key, or the down arrow key or 
you can clear the cell by pressing Esc(ape). 
 Only after typing the second  a in the word savant in Figure  3-28 is there a word that matches all the 
letters typed so far. You can accept the word by pressing the Enter key, the tab key, or the down arrow key or 
you can clear the cell by pressing the Esc key. 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ BEST WAYS TO ENTER AND EDIT DATA
71
 
■ Note   AutoComplete does not work if there is an empty cell above the current cell. 
 Pick from Drop-down List 
 The  Pick from Drop-down List feature is similar to the AutoComplete feature. The Pick from Drop-down 
List like the AutoComplete feature, lets you use entries that already exist in the column. The Pick from 
Drop-down List lets you select from a list of existing entries that are automatically sorted for you. The list can 
be  accessed by right-clicking the cell and selecting  Pick from Drop-down List  or by pressing  Alt + Down 
Arrow . See Figure  3-29 . 
 
■ Note   Pick from Drop-down  List does not work if there is an empty cell above the current cell. 
 EXERCISE 3-8: AUTOCOMPLETE AND PICK FROM DROP-DOWN LIST
 Let’s use Autocomplete and Pick From Drop-down List to add text. 
 AutoComplete  
 Let’s see  AutoComplete in action in this exercise. If you have closed the Chapter   3 workbook from the 
last practice, reopen it.

 1. 
 Add another worksheet and name it  AutoComplete . 
 2. 
 Type the names in column A as shown in Figure  3-30 . 
 3. 
 Type the letter  C in cell A6. The name Carl appears in the cell because there is no 
other name that starts with C. 
 4. 
 Type  Da in cell A7. Since there are two names that start with a D in the column, 
Excel can’t find a unique one at this point. Type a  v after the Da. Only one name 
starts with Dav so Excel enters David in the cell. Press Enter. 
 5. 
 Type  Mar in cell A8. Since there are two names that start with Mar in the column, 
Excel can’t find a unique one at this point. Type a  t after the Mar. Only one name 
starts with Mart so Excel enters Marten in the cell. 
 Pick from Drop-down List  
 In this exercise, you use the  Pick from Drop-down List feature .
 1. 
 Right-click in cell A9 and then select  Pick from Drop-down  List from the menu. 
 Notice that your entries are displayed in alphabetic order and no duplicates are displayed. See Figure  3-31  
 2. 
 Click David. Press the Enter key. 
 3. 
 Press  Alt + Down Arrow . Select Marten. Press the Enter key.

CHAPTER 3 ■ BEST WAYS TO ENTER AND EDIT DATA
73
 The  AutoComplete feature and the Pick from Drop List both provide a quick way of creating duplicate 
data in a column. The AutoComplete feature automatically provides suggestions for you to select from 
as you type. The Pick from Drop-down List displays all the entries you have made thus far in the current 
column and then lets you pick one from the list to duplicate. Next, you will look at how the AutoFill feature 
not only lets you duplicate data but also creates repeated patterns of data. 
 AutoFill 
 The  AutoFill feature allows you to fill cells automatically with data that follows a pattern or that is based on data 
in other cells. It can also be used to create duplicate cells, enter a series of values, and create a custom list. 
 Use AutoFill to Create Duplicate  Cells 
 You can copy values in one cell to additional cells by dragging the AutoFill Handle in the direction that you 
want. The AutoFill Handle is a small black square at the bottom right corner of the active cell (Figure  3-32 ). 
Placing the cursor over the AutoFill Handle turns the cursor into a plus sign (Figure  3-33 ). 
 A ToolTip is displayed as you drag the AutoFill Handle across other cells indicating the value that will be 
placed in that cell when you release the mouse button (Figure  3-34 ). 
 Figure 3-32.  AutoFill Handle

CHAPTER 3 ■ BEST WAYS TO ENTER AND EDIT DATA
74
 Figure  3-35  shows the result of dragging the AutoFill Handle from A1 through D1.  
 You can drag the AutoFill Handle across as many cells as you like and you can drag it in any direction. 
Figure  3-36  shows the result of dragging the AutoFill Handle up.   
 Using AutoFill to Enter a  Series of Values 
 AutoFill, in addition to being able to duplicate cell values, can also be used to create a series of repeating 
data lists. Excel has built-in data series related to days, months, years, numbers, and so on. For example, you 
can enter Monday into a cell then use the Autofill Handle to automatically enter the other days of the week 
in adjacent cells. As you are dragging the AutoFill Handle, Excel shows you what is going to be placed in that 
cell when you have finished dragging (see Figure  3-37 ).

CHAPTER 3 ■ BEST WAYS TO ENTER AND EDIT DATA
75
 It doesn’t matter what day of the week you start with. If you drag across more than seven cells, the days 
will start repeating. You can also use a three-character abbreviated day. 
 Dragging across the cells as shown in Figure  3-38  will result in the series shown in Figure  3-39 . 
 Excel knows that there are four quarters in the year. If you type  Quarter 1 then use the AutoFill Handle 
to create a series, Excel will go from Quarter 1 to Quarter 4, and then it will repeat the pattern starting with 
Quarter 1. See Figure  3-40 . 
 You can also use the abbreviation Qtr for Quarter. 
 If you have a word before a number in a cell, Excel will increase the number by 1 for each cell in the 
series. See Figure  3-41 . 
 Teaching Excel to Create an AutoFill Pattern 
 You can teach Excel a  pattern . If you want to display every third number, you can enter a value of 1 in a cell 
and a 4 in the next cell. You would select both cells and then, using the AutoFill Handle, drag across as many 
cells as you want to include in the pattern. This would produce a pattern of 1, 4, 7, 10, and so on. 
 If you want to display a series of adjacent cells with 15-minute intervals, select the first two cells to teach 
it the pattern (Figure  3-42 ) and then drag the AutoFill Handle for as many cells as you want to include in the 
pattern. When you finish dragging the result will be as shown in Figure  3-43 . 
 Figure 3-37.    As you drag across cells using the AutoFill Handle Excel shows what it will place in that cell       
 Figure 3-38.  Using the AutoFill Handle on a day of the week, it will repeat that day every seven cells

 Using the AutoFill Options Button 
 When you have finished using the AutoFill Handle to copy a cell or create a series, an Autofill Options button 
appears to the bottom right of the last selected cell. 
 Clicking the  Autofill Options button brings up three or more options if you used the AutoFill Handle to 
copy a cell that contains alpha data. 
 Clicking the Autofill Options button brings up three options when copying alpha data in a horizontal 
format. The default is Copy Cells. See Figure  3-44 . 
 Clicking the  Autofill Options button brings up four options when copying alpha data in a vertical 
format. The default is Copy Cells. See Figure  3-45 .

 Clicking the  Autofill Options button brings up four or more options if you used the AutoFill Handle to 
copy numeric data. See Figure  3-46 . 
 Clicking the Autofill Options button brings up many options if you used the AutoFill Handle to copy 
Date data. See Figure  3-47 .

78
 Selecting the  Copy Cells option would revert the series you just created back to copies of the original 
cell you used for making the series. The ten cells would all contain 10/28/2012 
 The  Fill Formatting Only option will only copy any formatting that you have applied to the original 
cell(s) to the cells you dragged across with the AutoFill Handle. It will not place any data into the cells. 
 The  Fill Without Formatting option will copy the data or create a series from the original cells but it will 
not apply any formatting from the original cells to the data you created using the AutoFill Handle. 
 The next practice, Exercise 3-9, illustrates the Autofill Options . 
 Create an Autofill  Custom List 
 In addition to using Excel’s built-in data series you can create your own. If you find yourself constantly 
entering the same series of values, then you should create your own data series to speed up your entries. The 
data series can be created in the Custom Lists dialog box which can be accessed by clicking the Ribbon’s File 
tab, selecting Options in the left pane, selecting Advanced in the left pane, scrolling the right pane until you 
see the General section, and then clicking the  Edit Custom Lists  button. See Figure  3-48 . 
 You type the new data series in the List entries box. Then click Add to add the data series to the Custom 
lists box. You can also create a new custom list by selecting the cells on your worksheet and clicking Import 
in the Custom Lists dialog box.

EXERCISE 3-9: PRACTICE USING THE AUTOFILL HANDLE AND THE 
AUTOFILL OPTIONS BUTTON AND CREATING CUSTOM LISTS
 In this exercise, you practice using AutoFill techniques. If you have closed the Chapter   3 workbook from 
the last practice, reopen it.
 1. 
 Add another worksheet and name it  Custom Lists . 
 2. 
 Type  Tuesday in cell A1. Using the AutoFill Handle drag to the right. As you drag 
past each cell, notice what Excel is going to place in that cell. Drag to cell J1. 
 3. 
 Type  Qtr1 in cell A2. Using the AutoFill Handle drag to the right to cell F2. 
 4. 
 Type  10:00 in cell A3. Using the AutoFill Handle drag to the right to cell F3. 
 5. 
 A series can be created vertically as well as horizontally. Type  Sep in cell A4. Using 
the AutoFill Handle drag down to cell A14. 
 6. 
 Type  June in cell H5. Using the AutoFill Handle drag to the left to cell C5. You should 
now have a series of January through June. 
 7. 
 Type  Store 3 in cell C7. Using the AutoFill Handle drag to the right to cell G7. You 
should now have a series of Store 3 through Store 7. 
 Teach AutoFill a Pattern  
 You can teach AutoFill to use a consistent  pattern .
 1. 
 Type  1 in cell C9. Enter a 3 in cell D9. Drag across both cells. With both cells 
selected drag the AutoFill Handle through cell H9. 
 2. 
 Enter a 1 in cell C10. Enter a 4 in cell D10. Drag across both cells. With both cells 
selected drag the AutoFill Handle through cell H10.

 You have finished covering all of Excel’s shortcuts for entering data. In this section you learned how to 
copy data and repeat patterns. You even learned how to create your own patterns. In the next section you’ll 
learn how to make comments for the data in a cell. Comments serve as a memory aid for you or others to 
remember where the data came from or what it represents.

 Creating, Viewing, Editing, Deleting, and Formatting Cell 
Comments 
 You can attach a comment to any worksheet cell. A comment could be information that you want to share 
with others or just to help yourself remember—such as how or why a formula was entered, where the data 
came from, what data still needs to be entered, and so on. You can think of a comment as a sticky note. Every 
place in the worksheet that you would want to place a sticky note to help you remember something, you can 
create a comment. Comments are actually better than sticky notes because they won’t fall off the sheet and 
they are easily editable. Cells that contain comments are easily identified by a red triangle in the upper right 
corner. The comments can be viewed by moving your cursor over the red triangle. See Figure  3-56 . 
 The buttons that handle comments are located in the Comments group of the Review tab. See Figure  3-57 .  
 If there are no comments in the workbook, the Delete, Previous, and Next buttons are grayed out. 
 The  Show Ink  button in the Comments group does nothing if you have a desktop or laptop computer. It 
is only functional for creating annotations on Tablet PCs where it allows users to create comments, shapes, 
highlights, and text on the screen with a stylus. 
 How to  Add a Comment 
 Few people take the time to enter comments into their Excel worksheets. Adding comments is time well 
spent. I think it is very important to get beginners off to a good start and so I am presenting comments here 
in the data entry chapter because it should be a part of your normal entry routine.
 
 1. 
 Click the cell to which you want to attach a comment. 
 
 2. 
 Click the Review tab. In the Comments group, click the  New Comment  button or 
right-click the cell and select Insert Comment. 
 Figure 3-56.  Cells with comments have a  red triangle in upper right corner

 3. 
 Type the comment in the comment box. 
 
 4. 
 Click outside the comment box. 
 How to View a Comment 
 Follow these steps to  view a comment:
 
 1. 
 Move your cursor over a red triangle. 
 
 2. 
 If the workbook contains more than one comment. You can click the  Previous or 
 Next button to move from comment to comment. 
 
 3. 
  By Default, comments remain hidden until you move your cursor over the red 
triangle. If you want a comment to remain visible even when you move your 
cursor away from the red triangle, then click the Show/Hide comment button. 
The button is available from the Ribbon or by right-clicking the cell and selecting 
it from the context menu. 
 How to View all the Comments at the Same Time 
 You also can view all comments by doing the following:
 
 1. 
 Click the Re view tab. 
 
 2. 
 In the Comments group, click Show All Comments. 
 How to Change the  Default Name for Comments 
 By default Excel places your username in the comment. The name can be removed and changed by doing 
the following:
 
 1. 
 To delete the username in a comment, select the name and press the Delete key. 
 
 2. 
 To change the default name for all comments, click the File tab and then click 
Options in the left pane. 
 
 3. 
 Select  General in the left pane 
 
 4. 
 In the  Personalize your copy of Microsoft Office  group, type the name you wish 
to use in the  User Name text box. 
 
 5. 
 Click the OK button. 
 
■ Note   You might not use a worksheet for months and then things you thought you would remember you no 
longer do. If you are like me and write notes to yourself on a piece of paper, you will probably lose it and then 
spend hours looking for it. So, make life easy on yourself and use comments in Excel frequently. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ BEST WAYS TO ENTER AND EDIT DATA
84
 Editing and Deleting Comments 
 If you right-click a cell that contains a comment, the context menu no longer has an  Insert Comment 
option but instead contains an  Edit Comment and a  Delete Comment  option. Clicking the Edit Comment 
brings the comment up for editing. Make the changes you wish then click outside the comment to update 
the comment with the changes. Clicking Delete Comment removes the comment without asking for any 
 verification . 
 Printing a Comment 
 Comments do not  print  by default. The option to print comments is located on the Page Setup dialog box. 
The Page Setup dialog box can be accessed by clicking the Page Layout tab on the Ribbon, and then clicking 
the dialog box launcher of the Page Setup group. It can also be accessed by clicking on the File tab, then 
selecting Print, and then clicking the  Page Setup link. Once you are in the Page Setup dialog box, select the 
 Sheet tab. From the comments drop-down box you can select either to have the comments printed at the 
end of your worksheet data or to be printed as they appear in your worksheet. See Figure  3-58 .

 Summary 
 This chapter covered the various data types and how those types can affect how your data looks and how it is 
adjusted within a cell. It also covered different ways of entering and editing data. 
 This chapter focused on knowing how to change the size and appearance of columns and rows in the 
worksheet and learning how to use special characters, as well as Excel’s  AutoCorrect  function. You can 
create, edit, delete, and print comments that you add to a cell. 
 Excel’s  AutoCorrect feature can be useful for such things as correcting commonly misspelled words, 
misuse of capitalization, entering special symbols that can’t be directly entered from the keyboard, and 
creating shortcuts for entering often used words or phrases. 
 The  AutoComplete and  Pick from Drop-down List features allow you to easily duplicate existing 
column values. 
 In Chapter   4 , you’ll learn how to use more complex data and cell formatting features. There are also 
a variety of options for presenting and formatting numeric data including those for accounting purposes. 
You’ll also begin using the mini toolbars and context menus, which provide more shortcut options particular 
to what you are working on.

 CHAPTER 4  
 Formatting and Aligning Data 
 You’ll now learn how to refine the way your worksheets look on screen and in print. Excel provides many great 
options to establish a style for worksheets and the workbook as a whole that is distinctive and consistent. 
 After reading and working through this chapter you should be able to
• 
 Format data and cell backgrounds 
• 
 Create cell borders 
• 
 Check which formats have been applied to the current cell  
• 
 Align data 
• 
 Copy the formatting from one cell to other cells  
• 
 Format numeric data 
• 
 Use Context Toolbars menus 
 Reasons for formatting data include emphasizing certain entries (e.g., totals) and making the worksheet 
more visually appealing and easier to understand (e.g., by using colors to visually segment rows and 
columns). This helps keep information organized for both the person creating the worksheet and others 
who use it for analysis and reports. Formatting can also be used to change how you display numeric data 
(with dollar signs, commas, decimals, percent, etc.). Formatting is also used to align data. You can use 
Excel’s Format Painter to copy all the formatting applied to a cell to other cells. You can create cell borders to 
separate different areas or to highlight a particular area on your worksheet. 
 Formatting Your Text Using the Font Group 
 The Font group located on the Home tab has options for such things as changing the font, size, color, and so 
on. Figure  4-1 shows the formatting  command buttons in the Font group. We will discuss each of these in the 
following text. 

CHAPTER 4 ■ FORMATTING AND ALIGNING DATA
90
 Using Bold, Italics, Underline, and Double  Underline 
 You can use any combination of bolding, italicizing, or underlining on your text. Selecting one or any 
combination of these options affects the active cells. These options work like a toggle switch, clicking them turns 
them on; clicking them again turns them off. You can switch between underlining and double underlining by 
clicking the down arrow for the underline button and then making your selection. See Figure  4-2 .  
 Changing the Font and Its  Size 
 It’s important to pick the right font and size not only to make your spreadsheet data stand out but to make it 
easy to read. 
 Fonts  
 The font can be changed by clicking the down arrow for the font and then picking your selection from a list. 
See Figure  4-3 . The font list shows how the different fonts look. As you pass your mouse pointer over the 
various fonts in the list, Excel displays the text in the active cell using the font that your mouse pointer is 
passing over. Changing the font affects the text of all currently selected cells on your worksheet. 
 Figure 4-1.  Font formatting  command buttons 
 Figure 4-2.  Select Underline or Double Underline 
 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ FORMATTING AND ALIGNING DATA
91
 There are a lot of fonts in the list. If you want to jump to a particular font quickly you type the first 
letter(s) of the font name in the Font Name Box. For example, if you wanted to use the font Bell MT you 
would type the first three letters Bel (there is only one font that starts with Bel) and then press Enter.  
 Font  Size 
 Clicking the down arrow for the font size shows all the available font sizes for the currently selected font. 
Figure  4-4  shows the top half of the available font sizes for the Calibri font. 
 Figure 4-3.  Available fonts 
 Figure 4-4.  Select font size 
 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ FORMATTING AND ALIGNING DATA
92
 Clicking the Increase Font Size button  
 increases the size of the font to the next available font size. 
Looking at Figure  4-4 if the current font size is 11, clicking the Increase Font Size button will increase the font 
size to the next available size, which is 12. If the current font size is 18, clicking Increase Font Size will 
increase the font size to the next available size, which is 20. 
 Clicking the Decrease Font Size button  
 does the opposite; it changes the font size to one size less 
than the current size. Looking at Figure  4-4 , you can see that if the current font size is 18, clicking the 
Decrease Font Size button will decrease the font size to 16 points. A font size is measured in points. Each 
point is approximately 1/72 of an inch. 
 
EXERCISE 4-1: CHANGE THE FONT AND FONT SIZE
 This exercise covers various ways of selecting fonts and changing font sizes.
 1. 
 Create a new workbook. 
 2. 
 Save the workbook giving it a name of  Chapter   4 . Change the name of the 
worksheet from Sheet1 to Font. 
 3. 
 Type your name in cell H5 and then press Ctrl + Enter to accept the value. 
 4. 
 On the Home tab in the Font group click the down arrow for the Font. 
 5. 
 Observe how your name changes as you move your mouse pointer over the 
different fonts. Select the font Arial Narrow if you have it otherwise select another 
typeface. 
 6. 
 Click the down arrow for the font size. 
 7. 
 Observe the size of your name as you move your mouse pointer over the different 
font sizes. Select Size 26. 
 8. 
 Now, try the Increase and Decrease buttons:
 a. 
 Click the Increase Font Size button. The Font Size changes to 28. 
 b. 
 Click the Increase Font Size button again. The Font Size changes to 36. 
 c. 
 Click the Decrease Font Size button. The Font Size changes to 28. 
 d. 
 Click the Decrease Font Size button. The Font Size Changes to 26. 
 9. 
 Double-click cell H5 to put it in edit mode. Drag across the first three letters in your 
name to select them. 
 10. 
 Click the down arrow for the font. Observe how only the first three letters change 
as you move your mouse pointer over the different fonts. 
 11. 
 Type  Ti in the Font Name Box to jump to the Times New Roman font. Press Enter. 
 You should now be familiar with all of the tools available on the menu’s Font group. Next, you will see 
how you can access these same tools from the Font group’s dialog box launcher. 

CHAPTER 4 ■ FORMATTING AND ALIGNING DATA
93
 Using the Font Group’s  Dialog Box Launcher  
 Clicking the Font group’s dialog box launcher brings up the Format Cells dialog box with the Font tab active. 
See Figure  4-5 . Here you can specify most of the options that are also available on the Font group, plus you 
can add Effects from one convenient location. 
 Figure 4-5.  Font options 
 Formatting with Color 
 You can change your worksheets from drab to attention grabbing by adding colors. You can add colors not 
only to make your worksheet more stimulating but also to
• 
 emphasize the cells that you think are important 
• 
 separate different areas of your worksheet 
• 
 make your worksheet easier to read 
 Be careful how you use color. Using too many colors or using colors in an incorrect manner such as 
using dark text against a dark background can make your worksheet confusing and hard to read. 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ FORMATTING AND ALIGNING DATA
94
 Changing the  Font Color 
 Clicking the Font color button  
 will apply the current color displayed on the icon to the text of your 
active cells. You can select a different color by clicking its down arrow. 
 You can select any color from the set of Theme Colors or from the Standard Colors as shown in Figure  4-6 . 
If you want more colors to select from, click the More Colors option.  
 Figure 4-6.  Theme and Standard colors 
 Clicking the More Colors option brings up the Colors dialog box which has Standard and Custom tabs. The 
Standard tab lets you select color from a honeycomb type of grid. The bottom right shows what the font color is 
for the current cell. When you select a color from the grid it is displayed in the New area at the bottom right of the 
window. See Figure  4-7 . This is the color to which the font will be changed if you click the OK button.  
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ FORMATTING AND ALIGNING DATA
95
 The Custom tab shows colors in vertical bars. See Figure  4-19 . The edge of each vertical bar blends in 
with the adjacent color. You can click any spot in the color palette that matches the color you need. That 
color is then displayed in the vertical bar to the right of the color palette. Dragging the arrow up or down 
changes the intensity of the color. See Figure  4-8 .

CHAPTER 4 ■ FORMATTING AND ALIGNING DATA
96
 Changing the  Cell Background Color 
 Clicking the Fill Color button  
 will apply the current color displayed on the icon to the background of 
your active cells. You can select a different color by clicking its down arrow. This will bring up the same 
options that were available for the font color. 
 Clicking the dialog box launcher for the Font group brings up the Format Cells dialog box. The Fill tab in 
the Format Cells dialog box has options for creating Fill Effects or a patterned background. See Figure  4-9 . 
 Check Which Formats Have Been Applied to the Current Cell 
 You can tell some of the formats that have been applied to a cell by just clicking the cell and then observing 
what is displayed in the Font group on the ribbon. Looking at Figure  4-10  you can see that the text in cell C1 
has been bolded and italicized. It has an Arial Black font and has a font size of 16. 
 
■ Note   If all of the text in the cell does not have the same format, you will need to select those characters 
for which you want to reveal their formatting. 
 Figure 4-9.  Select a Fill Color, Pattern Color, or Pattern Style 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ FORMATTING AND ALIGNING DATA

 You have learned how to alter the appearance and size of your text as well as emphasizing it. You can 
use this knowledge to draw your user’s eye to the text you want. Your company may have standards for how 
your worksheets should look with certain font types and colors. Next, you will see how placing borders 
around your cells can also be used to emphasize certain cells or as a way to show separation of different 
areas of your worksheet. 
 Cell Borders 
 All cells have grid lines that separate them. This distinguishes one cell from another. The gridlines can be 
removed by selecting the Ribbon’s View tab and then  unchecking Gridlines  . See Figure  4-13 . 
 Figure 4-12.  Change cell background colors to a gradient 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ FORMATTING AND ALIGNING DATA
100
 Figure  4-14  shows the result of removing the Gridlines. 
 There are times, however, when you will want to distinguish a particular cell, row, column, or group of 
cells. You can do this by using borders. A border can be just a line at the left, top, right, or bottom of the cell or 
range of cells. It can also be a combination of lines or a full box around the cell or range of cells. Figure  4-15  
shows several different border  types.

CHAPTER 4 ■ FORMATTING AND ALIGNING DATA
101
 Clicking the Border button will apply the border that is currently displayed on the button to your active 
cells. If you want a different border style you can click the down arrow next to the border and select one of 
the options to apply to your selected cells. See Figure  4-16 . 
 
■ Note   Standard accounting practice is to place a single line above and a double line below a total line.

■ Note   You can erase a portion of a border by using the Erase Border tool. The mouse pointer will display as 
an eraser when using the Erase Border tool. 
 Drawing  Borders  
 You can even draw your borders by using either the Draw Border or Draw Border Grid tool. Your mouse 
pointer will display as a pencil when using one of the drawing border tools. The border will be drawn in the 
current line style. 
 The Draw Border tool draws a full outside border around the cells you drag across. See Figure  4-17 .

 Formatting Numeric Data Using the Number Group 
 You have seen how Excel makes assumptions based on the data you entered as to how that data should be 
formatted and aligned in the cell, such as right-aligning numeric data. If you want to change that formatting, 
you will need to use one of Excel’s many formatting features which are located in the Number group on the 
Home tab. See Figure  4-28 . Table  4-1 provides a  description   for each of the options in the Number group.   
 Figure 4-28.  Ribbon’s Number group on the Home tab 
 Table 4-1.  Description for Each Option in the Number Group 
 Buttons on Number Group  Description 
 
 
 The Number Format drop-down list provides various defaults for numeric, 
date, and time values. See Figure  4-26 . 
 
 
 Clicking the dollar sign portion of the button formats the current cell in the 
Accounting format (dollar signs, commas, and two decimal positions). If you 
want to use a different currency such as pounds or euros you can click the 
down arrow to the right of the 
 button. 
 
 
 Multiplies the value in the cell by 100 and adds a % sign to the end of the 
value. 
 
 
 Adds commas to a value. If the value doesn’t already contain a decimal it will 
add .00 to the value. 
 
 
 The first button (Increase Decimal) increases the number of decimal 
positions in the cell by one each time you click it. The second button 
(Decrease Decimal) decreases the number of decimal positions in the cell by 
one each time you click it. 
 
 
 Dialog box launcher brings up the Format Cells dialog box with the Number 
tab selected. 
 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ FORMATTING AND ALIGNING DATA
111
 Using Default Formats  
 Let’s say that the active cell currently has a value of 3859.27. 
 Clicking the drop-down arrow of the Number Format drop-down list displays a list of default formats 
(see Figure  4-29 ). Clicking an option in this list formats the current value as shown below each format label. 
What you see is what you get. There are no options to select.  
 For example, if you were to click the Fraction option, the format of the current cell would change and 
the result would be 3859 ¼. 
 Figure 4-29.    Default formats for different data  types         
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ FORMATTING AND ALIGNING DATA
112
 Accounting and Currency Formats 
 The Accounting format is a special monetary format that displays values with a dollar sign, commas, and 
two decimal positions. The Accounting format lines up the dollar signs and decimal points in a column. See 
Figure  4-30 . The dollar sign is always placed in the left-most position in the cell. Depending upon the width of 
the cell and the value you have in it there could be many spaces between the dollar sign and the value itself.  
 The Currency format is similar to the Accounting format. It also adds dollar signs, commas, and two 
decimal positions to values. The difference is that the Currency format uses a floating dollar sign and the 
Accounting format uses a fixed dollar sign. The floating dollar sign doesn’t align the dollar, signs; instead, it 
places the dollar sign to the immediate left of the value. 
 Formatting  Monetary Values 
 The 
 button in the Number group performs the exact same formatting as selecting the Accounting format 
from the Number Format drop-down list. If you want to display the value in a different format or if you want 
to use a different currency such as pounds or euros you can click the down arrow to the right of the 
 button. See Figure  4-31 . 
 If you want to use something other than two decimal positions or you want to use a currency other than 
those shown in the drop-down box, you can select the last option  More Accounting Formats . Selecting this 
option is one of the many ways of opening the Format Cells dialog box. 
 Figure 4-30.  Difference between Accounting and Currency formats 
 Figure 4-31.  Formatted monetary values 
 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ FORMATTING AND ALIGNING DATA
113
 From here you can select one of the many different currency options available in the Symbol drop-
down list. See Figure  4-32 . 
 Converting Values to  Percent Style 
 The Percent Style    
 button multiplies the values in your selected cells by 100 and places the % after the 
number. The value .25 would be formatted as 25%. The % button rounds the value and then removes any 
decimal positions as shown in Figure  4-33 . 
 Figure 4-32.    Accounting options for decimal places and monetary  symbol         
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ FORMATTING AND ALIGNING DATA
114
 If you want to use a percentage format that displays two decimal positions, then click the Number 
Format drop-down arrow and select % (percentage) See Figure  4-34 . 
 Converting Values to  Comma Style 
 The Comma Style   
 button places comma separators in the values for the cells you have selected. The value 
3857495.25 would be formatted as 3,857,495.25 
 Changing the Number of  Decimal Places 
 The  
 Increase Decimal button increases the number of decimal positions by one for each time you click 
it. The icon shows a single decimal place changing to two decimal places. 
 The  
 Decrease Decimal button decreases the number of decimal places by one each time you click 
it. The icon shows two decimal places changing to one decimal place.      
 Accessing the Format Cell Dialog  Box 
 If you want to use more options when formatting a number, then using the Number tab in the Format Cells 
dialog box is the way to go. Using the Number tab in the Format Cells dialog box you can do such things as 
format fractions, dates, times, and other formatting that you can’t do in the other sections. What options 
appear on the right side of the window depends upon the category selected. See Figure  4-35 . 
 Figure 4-33.  Formatted using percent style

EXERCISE 4-3: FORMATTING NUMBERS
 In this exercise, you use various numeric data formats. If you have closed your workbook from the last 
practice you can reopen the Chapter   4 workbook. 
 1. 
 Create a new worksheet named “NumberGroup.” 
 Figure 4-35.  Format Cells dialog box with Number formatting selected 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ FORMATTING AND ALIGNING DATA
116
 2. 
 Type  1275.85 in cell A1 but don’t press Enter. Click the Enter button in the formula 
bar  
 . Clicking the Enter button accepts the value you entered and leaves the 
current cell as the active cell. Once the value has been accepted the check and 
delete buttons are grayed out on the formula bar. 
 3. 
 On the Home tab, in the Number group, click the down arrow for the Number Format 
drop-down box    
 . Notice that every option on the drop-down box 
shows how the value in A1 will appear if you click that particular format. 
 
■ Note Excel’s calendar starts with the date January 1, 1900. Notice that the Short Date and Long Date 
formats show the date as June 28, 1903. This date is displayed because the integer portion of the value that 
you entered in cell A1 is 1275 and the date  June 23, 1903 is 1,275 days past January 1, 1900. 
 4. 
 Click the Currency format. 
 5. 
 Change the width of Column A to approximately 13.43 
 6. 
 Type  3427.35 in cell A2 but don’t press Enter. Click the Enter button in the formula bar.  
 7. 
 Click the Accounting Number Format button 
 in the Number group. Notice the 
difference between the Currency format in cell A1 and the Accounting format in cell 
A2. The $ appears in the left-most position of the cell when using the Accounting 
format. The Accounting format also leaves one blank space to the right of the last 
digit. 
 8. 
 Type .85 in cell A3. Press Ctrl + Enter. Click the  % button in the Number group. The 
value should display as 85%. 
 9. 
 Enter 1385197 in cell A4. Press Ctrl + Enter. Click the  Comma Style button  
 in 
the Number group. The value displays as 1,385,197.00. 
 10. 
 Click the Decrease Decimal button   
 . One of the decimal positions is removed. 
Click the Decrease Decimal button a second time. The second decimal position is 
removed. Click the Increase Decimal button   
 twice to change the value back to 
having two decimal positions. 
 11. 
 Enter -385 in cell C1. Press Ctrl + Enter. Click the down arrow for the Number 
Format drop-down box. Notice that the Currency format displays the value as 
-$385.00 but the Accounting format displays it as ($385.00). In Accounting negative 
numbers are displayed in parentheses. 
 
■ Note Notice that the Scientific format displays the value as  -3.85+E02 . The Scientific format when dealing 
with whole numbers puts the decimal after the left-most digit, rounds the number to two decimal positions, and 
displays the rest as an exponent. 

CHAPTER 4 ■ FORMATTING AND ALIGNING DATA

 12.  Click Accounting to change the format in cell C1. 
 13.  Enter 3.25 in cell C2. Press Ctrl + Enter. Click the down arrow for the Number 
Format drop-down box. Click  Fraction . The Fraction format converts the decimal 
portion of a number to a fraction. The fraction portion .25 is changed to 1/4. 
 14.  Enter 5/15/2012 into cell C3. Press Ctrl + Enter. Click the dialog box launcher on

 Excel recognizes the value as a date and so it opens the Format Cells dialog box with the 
Date category selected. After the category has been selected you will need to select how 
you want your data to appear from the Type area. The Sample area of the window displays 
how the data in the current cell will appear using the option you selected from the Type 
area. If you have a range of cells selected on the worksheet it will show how the first cell in 
that range will appear. 
 15.  Click Number in the Category area. The Number category has options for entering 
the number of decimal positions, for using a comma, and for letting you select how 
you want to display negative numbers. 
 16.  Click each of the other categories to familiarize yourself with the different options 
for formatting your data. 
 17.  Click the Date Category again. 
 18.  In the Type area, Select *Wednesday, March 14, 2012. The Sample area shows how 
this change will display the current cell. 
 19.  Click the OK button. 
 20.  Cell C3 may display as a number of # signs. What does this mean? That’s right, the 
column isn’t wide enough. Widen the column to see your results. 
 21.  Click the Save button  
 on the Quick Access Toolbar. 
 You have learned how to use the tools from the Ribbon’s Number group to format numeric data. 
Formatting the data is necessary so that the user can interpret the data the way it was meant to be, such as 
making sure the user knows a number is a percentage and not just a numeric value. Next, you will learn how 
to align data within a cell. 
 Aligning Data Using the Alignment Group 
 The Alignment group is located on the  Home Tab . See Figure  4-38 . It contains options for aligning your text 
vertically and horizontally, rotating text, increasing and decreasing indenting, word wrap, and merging cells. 
Table  4-2 provides a description for each option in the Alignment group.   
 Figure 4-38.  Alignment group on the  Home tab 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ FORMATTING AND ALIGNING DATA

 Fitting More Text into a Cell 
 Excel provides three options for fitting more data into a cell. 
 Text Wrapping—Text automatically wraps to the next line 
 Shrink to Fit—Shrinks the size of the cells contents so that they fit within the cell 
 Merge Cells—Merges multiple cells into a single cell 
 Text Wrapping 
 If your text doesn’t fit within a cell you might want to break up the text on to multiple lines. Turning Word Wrap 
on will format the cell so that the text wraps automatically. You can turn word wrap on by selecting the cell(s) 
you want to automatically word wrap and then clicking the Home tab in the Ribbon. In the Alignment group, 
click the Wrap Text button. You can also force a line break to occur wherever you want by pressing ALT + Enter. 
 
■ Note   When word wrap is turned on, data in the cell wraps to fit the column width. When you change the 
column width, data wrapping adjusts automatically. 
 Figure  4-39  shows a before and after example of using Wrap Text   
 Table 4-2.  Descriptions of Alignment  Buttons 
 Buttons 
 Description 
 
 
 Vertical Alignment —The Top-, Middle-, and Bottom-Align buttons are for aligning 
your text to the top of the cell, the middle of the cell, and the bottom of the cell in 
that order. 
 
 
 Orientation —Clicking this button brings up options for selecting the angle and 
direction of the text within a cell. 
 
 
 Wrap Text —Used for wrapping your data across multiple lines within a cell 
 
 
 Horizontal Alignment —The Left-, Center-, and Right-Align buttons are for 
aligning your text to the left side of a cell, to the middle of a cell, and to the right 
side of a cell in that order. 
 
 
 Indentation —The Decrease Indent button (left) is for decreasing the amount of 
indentation in a cell. The Increase Indent button (right) is used for increasing the 
amount of indentation in a cell. 
 
 
 Merge & Center —This button provides options for merging cells, merging and 
centering cells, and unmerging cells. 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ FORMATTING AND ALIGNING DATA
120
 Shrinking to  Fit 
 Turning on the Shrink to fit option will shrink the cell’s contents so that they will fit within the size of the cell. 
Figure  4-40  shows a before and after example. 
 If you enter very much text, it may become too small to see unless you expand the width of the column. 
The Shrink to fit option is located on the Alignment tab of the Format Cells dialog box. See Figure  4-41 . There 
are several ways to open this tab. One way is to click the dialog box launcher of the Alignment group and 
then select the Alignment tab. 
 Figure 4-39.    The upper part of the image shows text before using Wrap Text, and the lower part shows text 
after Wrap text has been applied       
 Figure 4-40.    The image on the left shows text before using Shrink to fit, and the one on the right shows it after 
Shrink to fit has been applied  
 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ FORMATTING AND ALIGNING DATA
121
 The Shrink to fit option can be turned on or off by selecting or clearing the  Shrink to fit check box. 
Notice that there are also options here for turning on Wrap text and Merge cells. 
 Merging and Unmerging Cells 
 You can join multiple cells to make one larger cell by using one of the three different options for merging cells.
• 
 Merge & Center 
• 
 Merge Across 
• 
 Merge  Cells 
 The  Merge & Center option merges the selected cells and then centers the data horizontally in the new 
expanded cell. The Merge & Center button is located on the Home Tab | Alignment group. 
 You can improve the look of your spreadsheet by making your heading centered across the width of 
your worksheet. In Figure  4-42 , the heading has been entered into cell A1. The heading would look better if it 
were centered across columns A through F. 
 Figure 4-41.  Format Cells dialog box with Alignment tab selected 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ FORMATTING AND ALIGNING DATA
122
 To center the heading across the cells, you select the cells and select the Merge & Center option. When 
you merge cells A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, and F1, you end up with one cell that takes up the space of all six cells. 
See Figure  4-43 . The single cell will have an address of A1.  
 The Merge & Center command lets you merge cells that are not only adjacent horizontally but vertically 
as well. Even though you can merge cells that are vertically adjacent, the Merge & Center command is 
usually used for creating labels that expand multiple columns or for spanning a heading over a report. 
 All the Merge options can be accessed by clicking the down arrow to the right of the Merge & Center 
button. See Figure  4-44 . 
 Figure 4-42.  Heading before being centered 
 Figure 4-43.  Cells merged and the heading centered 
 Figure 4-44.  Merge options 
 
 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ FORMATTING AND ALIGNING DATA
123
 The other three options do the following: 
• 
 The  Merge Across option can only merge cells that are horizontally adjacent. It does 
not center the text. 
• 
 The  Merge Cells option can merge cells that are horizontally or vertically adjacent. 
Like the Merge Across option it does not center the text.  
• 
 You can unmerge cells by selecting the cells you want to unmerge and then clicking 
the  Unmerge Cells option. 
 Aligning and Indenting Text in a Cell 
 Excel provides options for setting the alignment for data in a cell (see Table  4-3 ) and for increasing or 
decreasing indentation in a cell (see Table  4-4 ).  
 Align Text Vertically and  Horizontally 
 There are other options on the Alignment tab of the Format Cells dialog box for Horizontal and Vertical 
alignment. See Figure  4-45 . Some of these are the same as those that appear on the Alignment group of the 
Home Tab, but here you have additional options such as the ability to set the amount of indention for the 
Left, Right, and Distributed horizontal alignments by using the Indent numerical text box.  
  Figure 4-45.    Alignment options       
 Table 4-3.  Vertical and Horizontal Alignment 
 Buttons 
 Description 
 
 
 Vertical Alignment —These buttons are for aligning your text to the top of the cell, the 
middle of the cell and the bottom of the cell in that order. Excel bottom aligns cell data 
by default. 
 
 
 Horizontal Alignment —These buttons are for aligning your text to the left side of a cell, 
to the middle of a cell, and to the right side of a cell in that order. 
 Table 4-4.  Increasing and Decreasing  Indentation of Text in a Cell 
 Buttons 
 Description 
 
 
 Decrease Indent —used to decrease the amount of indentation in the cell. 
 
 
 Increase Indent —used to increase the amount of indentation in the cell. 
 
 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ FORMATTING AND ALIGNING DATA
124
 The Distributed horizontal alignment uses an equal amount of indention on both sides of the cell text. 
Therefore if you enter 3 for the Indent the cell will have three blanks spaces to the left and to the right of 
whatever is entered in the cell. 
 The Justify horizontal alignment option is only useful when you are entering multiple lines of text in a 
cell. Excel  justifies each line except the last line by adjusting the space between words so that the text spreads 
completely from the left to the right borders of the cell. See Figure  4-46 . 
 Rotating Text 
 Clicking the Orientation button (Figure  4-47 ) displays a list of options for rotating your text. The first five 
default options are self-explanatory. If you want to specify another particular orientation, select the last 
option  Format Cell Alignment . This option displays the Alignment tab on the Format Cells dialog box. 
 The Orientation section on the Alignment tab of the Format Cells dialog box is for setting the angle of 
your text. See Figure  4-48 . 
 Figure 4-47.  Orientation options 
 Figure 4-46.  Justify alignment 
 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ FORMATTING AND ALIGNING DATA
125
 You can set the angle that your text will be displayed by dragging the line up or down or by setting the 
degrees. If you enter the number of degrees Excel automatically adjusts the line and vice versa. Moving the 
line up from 0 degrees makes the text display from bottom to top. Moving the line down from 0 degrees 
makes the text display from top to bottom. If you are entering the degrees and you want your text to display 
top to bottom, you will need to enter a negative value. Clicking the Text button on the left side of the 
Orientation box puts the text in a completely vertical format.  
 
■ Note  When you rotate text, the size of the cell automatically adjusts to fit the rotated text.

 33.  Type your last name in cell C23 and then press Ctrl + Enter. Right-click cell 
C23. Select Format Cells. Click the vertical word  Text on the left side of the 
Orientation box. Click the OK button. 
 34.  With cell C23 still selected, click the following buttons on the Alignment group: click 
the Align Left button, then click the Align Right button, and then the Center button. 
 35.  Click the Save button  
 on the Quick Access Toolbar. 
 You have learned how to use the commands from the Ribbon’s Alignment group to align data both 
horizontally and vertically within a cell as well as rotating cell data. You practiced Merging Cells so that data 
can occupy more than one cell. The Word Wrap and Shrink to fit features allowed you to place more text in a 
cell. Next, you will see how you can copy all the formatting that you applied to a cell to other cells. 
 Using Format Painter to Copy Formatting 
 The Format  Painter can be used for copying all the formatting in one cell to other cells. The Format Painter 
button has an icon of a paintbrush. It appears on the Clipboard group of the Home tab. See Figure  4-51 . 
 Figure 4-51.  Clipboard group 
 The Format Painter not only speeds up the process of applying the same formatting to other cells but 
also makes it easy to give your workbook a consistent look. 
 Single-clicking the Format Painter button allows you to copy the formatting of a selected cell to a single 
range of cells and then it is automatically turned off. Double-clicking the Format Painter button keeps the 
button turned on so you can keep applying the formatting to as many cell ranges as you want until you click 
the button again to turn it off. 
 EXERCISE 4-5: USING THE FORMAT PAINTER TO COPY FORMATTING
 This exercise takes you through the process of copying formatting that has been applied to one cell to 
other cells. 
 1. 
 If you have closed your workbook from the last practice you can open the Chapter   4  
workbook, then create a new worksheet named “Format.” 
 2. 
 Click cell A1. Type  Copy formatting and then press Ctrl + Enter. 
 3. 
 Widen Column A so that all the text appears in the cell.

 Type the word  Data in C8. Use the AutoFill Handle to drag to E9. Type  Data in C12 
and use the AutoFill Handle to drag to C13. 
 6. 
 Format cell A1 by selecting the following options from the Font group: Bold, Italic, 
and Underline; change the text color to red. 
 7. 
 Click the Center button on the Alignment tab. 
 8. 
 With cell A1 selected, click the Format Painter button. The Format Painter button 
should now be highlighted. The mouse pointer changes to a block plus sign with a 
paintbrush. See Figure  4-53 . 
 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ FORMATTING AND ALIGNING DATA
131
 9. 
 Click cell B2. Cell B2 takes on all the formatting that you applied to cell A1. The 
Format Painter button should no longer be highlighted. Your mouse pointer should 
return to  
 . 
 10. 
 Select cell A1. This time double-click the Format Painter button. The mouse pointer 
will stay as  
 and you can keep copying the formatting until you turn off the 
format painter. 
 11. 
 Drag across cells C3:E9. Those cells now have the same formatting as cell A1. 
 12. 
 Drag across cells C12 and C13. Those cells now have the same formatting as cell 
A1. See Figure  4-54 . 
 Figure 4-54.  Result of applying the Format Painter 
 13. 
 Click the Format Painter button again to turn it off. Your mouse pointer should return 
to  
 
 14. 
 Since you dragged across cell C6 when you copied the formatting, if you type 
something in this cell it should take on the same formatting as cell A1. Type  horse 
 in cell C6.  
 15. 
 If you want to clear the formatting from a cell(s), you can clear just the formatting 
and leave the data in the cell. Drag across cells C6:E8. Click the down arrow for the 
Clear button located in the Editing group. Click Clear Formats. See Figure  4-55 . 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ FORMATTING AND ALIGNING DATA
132
 16. 
 Click the Save button  
 on the Quick Access Toolbar. 
 You have been using commands from the Ribbon. Most of these commands are more quickly accessible 
from a mini-toolbar or the context menu which brings up commands that relate to what you are currently 
working on. 
 Using the Mini-Toolbars and the Context Menu 
 You have gone through Excel’s tools for formatting both numeric and text data. You will no doubt be using 
these tools often; therefore Microsoft gives you quick access to them via the mini-toolbars. There are two 
different size mini-toolbars.  
 If you select any text within a cell you will see the smaller of the two mini-toolbars as shown in Figure  4-56 . 
Moving your mouse pointer away from the mini-toolbar will make it fade away. When you bring your cursor 
back toward the mini-toolbar it will fade back in. You can remove the mini-toolbar by doing one of the following: 
• 
 Move your cursor into the Ribbon area. 
• 
 Click another cell. 
• 
 Move the cursor far enough away from the toolbar until it is no longer visible.    
 You will need to reselect text in the cell if you want to get the mini-toolbar back. This smaller mini-
toolbar only includes tools from the Font group. 
 Figure 4-55.  Clear options 
 Figure 4-56.  Smaller mini-toolbar 
 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ FORMATTING AND ALIGNING DATA
133
 The larger mini-toolbar shown in Figure  4-57 includes buttons from the Font, Alignment, and Number 
groups along with the Format Painter from the Clipboard group. This mini-toolbar can be accessed by right-
clicking any cell even if the cell is empty.  
 A context menu (also known as a shortcut menu) is also displayed when you right-click a cell or an 
object. What items are displayed in the context menu depends upon the object you clicked and what you are 
working on at the time. You can make a selection from either the mini-toolbar or the shortcut menu. If you 
decide you don’t want to use either one just click another cell and they both will disappear. 
 Notice that the context menu has some options that have three dots after them. See Figure  4-58 . The 
three dots are called an  ellipsis . The ellipsis signifies that another dialog box will be opened when this 
option is selected. For example, clicking the Insert… option on the context menu will bring up the Insert 
window. Some of the options on the context menu have an arrow. Moving your mouse pointer over an arrow 
brings up a submenu of additional options.

 Inserting, Deleting, Hiding, and Unhiding Rows and Columns 
 You can add new blank rows between existing spreadsheet rows. You can also delete rows to remove data or 
to remove blank rows. 
 You can hide a single row or multiple rows of data from the view of users. Rows that have been hidden 
can be unhidden. You don’t have to unhide all the rows only the ones you choose. 
 Hiding and Unhiding Columns and Rows 
 Columns and rows can be hidden and unhidden so that the users can concentrate on only the data that is 
necessary and relevant to them. 
 Hiding Columns and Rows 
 There are many reasons for hiding columns or rows in a spreadsheet.
• 
 There is too much data to display on a single screen so you hide the data you really 
don’t need to see. 
• 
 You want to hide some of the data so it is not printed. 
• 
 The data is not relevant to the user. 
• 
 You want to hide the formulas. 
• 
 You don’t want the user to see some of the data. 
 Hiding a column or row does not affect the data in that column or row, nor does it prevent it from being 
referenced. 
 A single column or row of data can be hidden as well as multiple columns or rows. If you are hiding 
multiple columns or rows they do not need to be adjacent. 
 How to hide a single column or row 
 
 1. 
 Right-click the column or row header. 
 
 2. 
 Select Hide from the context menu. 
 Figure 4-58.  Context menu 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ FORMATTING AND ALIGNING DATA
135
 How to hide adjacent columns or rows 
 
 1. 
 Drag across the headers of the columns or rows you want to hide.  
 
 2. 
 Right-click the selected headers. 
 
 3. 
 Select Hide from the context menu. 
 How to hide nonadjacent columns and rows 
 
 1. 
 Click a column header. 
 
 2. 
 Hold down the Ctrl key while you click other column heads. 
 
 3. 
 Right-click one of the selected column heads. 
 
 4. 
 Select Hide from the context menu. 
 Use the same steps that you do for nonadjacent columns. 
 
■ Note  You can’t select columns and rows in the same operation. You must first hide either columns or rows 
and then do the other. 
 Unhiding Columns and Rows 
 Columns and rows that you hide will remain hidden until you run the  Unhide command. 
 Unhide All Columns and Rows 
 You can unhide all columns and rows by first clicking the  Select All  button located to the left of row 
head A and then right-clicking any header and selecting Unhide from the context menu. If you wanted to 
unhide columns and rows from multiple worksheets, you would select those sheet tabs before performing 
these steps. 
 Unhide Adjacent Columns or Rows 
 In the worksheet example shown in Figure  4-59 columns B and C are hidden. 
 Columns B and C can be unhidden by dragging across Column heads A and D, right-clicking, and then 
selecting Unhide. 
 Rows would be unhidden using the same steps, except of course you would use the Row heads rather 
than the Column heads. 
 Unhide Nonadjacent Columns or Rows 
 In the worksheet example shown in Figure  4-60 columns B and C are hidden, and so are columns F, G, 
and H.  
 Figure 4-59.  Columns B and C are hidden 
 Figure 4-60.    Columns B and C, F, G, and H are hidden 
 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ FORMATTING AND ALIGNING DATA
136
 Columns B and C and columns F, G, and H can be unhidden by dragging across Column heads A and 
D and then holding down the Ctrl key while dragging across Column heads E and I, right-clicking, and then 
selecting Unhide. 
 Another way to accomplish this would be to unhide all five columns at once. You could drag across 
Column heads A to I. Right-click one of the selected column heads and select Unhide. 
 Unhide Column A or Row 1 
 Unhiding Column A or Row 1 is a unique situation. It is unique because there is no column head before 
Column A to drag across, nor is there a row head before row 1 to drag across. 
 Unhide Column A 
 
 1. 
 Type  A1 in the Name Box and then press Enter.  
 
 2. 
 Click the Home Tab on the Ribbon. 
 
 3. 
 In the Cells group click the Format button. 
 
 4. 
 Select  Hide & Unhide from the menu and then select  Unhide Columns . See

 Enter A1 in the name box and then press Enter. 
 2. 
 Click the Home Tab on the Ribbon. In the Cells group click the Format button. 
 3. 
 Select Hide & Unhide from the menu and then select Unhide Rows. 
 Inserting Columns and Rows 
 After you have entered data into your workbook you may discover that you need to add a column of data 
between your other columns or maybe you want to add a blank column to make your worksheet easier to 
read. The same holds true for rows, you may discover that you forgot to add rows of data or you merely want 
to add additional blank rows to improve the appearance of your worksheet. 
 You can add a new column(s) or row(s) anywhere in your worksheet. 
 How to Insert  Columns 
 
 1. 
 Select the column head where you want the column inserted.  
 
 2. 
 Right-click the worksheet and select Insert. The column you selected will be 
shifted to the right and the column that you created will take its place. The new 
column will have the same width as the column to the left of it.     
 You can insert multiple columns by selecting the columns where you want the new ones inserted. If you 
selected four columns, then four new columns will be inserted when you right-click the worksheet and select 
Insert. 
 How to Insert Rows 
 
 1. 
 Select the row head where you want the row inserted.  
 
 2. 
 Right-click the worksheet and select Insert. The row you selected will be shifted 
down and the row that you created will take its place. The new row will have the 
same height as the row above it. 
 You can insert multiple rows by selecting the rows where you want the new ones inserted. If you 
selected four rows, then four new rows will be inserted when you right-click the worksheet and select Insert. 
 Deleting Columns and Rows 
 You can just as easily remove a column or row as you can add them. Some of the reasons for removing a 
column would be that

CHAPTER 4 ■ FORMATTING AND ALIGNING DATA
140
• 
 You have entered the wrong data into a column.  
• 
 You have determined that you no longer need the data in a column.  
• 
 You want to remove empty columns to improve the appearance or use of your 
spreadsheet. 
 If you entered invalid data in a column it might be easier just to clear the data from the column rather 
than deleting the entire column. This could be done by selecting all the cells containing the invalid data, 
then selecting Home tab | Editing Group | clear button 
 , and then selecting one of the clear options. 
 How to Delete Columns 
 You can delete one column or multiple columns at the same time.
 
 1. 
  Select the column heads of the columns you want to delete. 
 
 2. 
 Right-click the worksheet and select Delete. The columns to the right of the 
deleted columns will be shifted left to replace those columns that you deleted (to 
replace the vacated space). 
 How to Delete  Rows 
 You can delete one row or multiple rows at the same time.
 
 1. 
  Select the row heads of the rows you want to delete.  
 
 2. 
 Right-click the worksheet and select Delete. The rows below the deleted columns 
will be shifted up to replace those rows that you deleted. 
 Inserting and Deleting Cells 
 You can insert blank cells above or to the left of an active cell. You can bring up the Insert dialog box (Figure  4-64 ) 
to perform this operation by right-clicking any cell and then selecting Insert from the context menu.  
 When you insert blank cells, you can choose to move the other cells in the same column down (Shift 
cells down) or to move the other cells in the same row to the right (Shift cells right) to accommodate the new 
cells. Notice that the Insert Dialog Box also has options for inserting entire rows and columns. 
 Figure 4-64.  Insert window 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ FORMATTING AND ALIGNING DATA
141
 You can remove cells by selecting the cells you want to remove, then right-clicking and selecting Delete 
from the context menu. This brings up the Delete Dialog Box (Figure  4-65 ) which provides options for 
deleting cells, entire rows, or entire columns. 
 You can choose to have the deleted cells replaced with cells from the right (Shift cells left) or you can 
choose to have the deleted cells replaced with those from below (Shift cells up). 
 EXERCISE 4-7: INSERT AND DELETE CELLS, ROWS, AND COLUMNS
 This exercise takes you through inserting and deleting cells and then deciding how the other cells need 
to be shifted over.  
 1. 
 Create a new worksheet. Name the worksheet “Stocks.” 
 2. 
 Type  Stocks Purchased 06-15-2016 in cell A1. Select cells A1 to D1. Right-click 
the selected cells. The larger mini-toolbar should appear above your selected text. 
Click the Merge & Center button   
 . 
 3. 
 Type  Stock in cell A2. 
 4. 
 Type  Closing in cell B2. Press Alt + Enter. Pressing Alt + Enter creates an additional 
line in the cell and turns on text wrapping. Type  Price . 
 5. 
 Select cells C2 and D2. Right-click in the selected area. Select Format Cells. Select 
Wrap text from the Alignment tab. Click the OK button. 
 6. 
 Type the data from Figure  4-66 in cells C2 and D2. You may need to widen your 
column to see all of the word Purchased. Then type the rest of the data in Figure  4-66 .

row is inserted above the selected cell. 
 14. 
 Right-click cell C4 and then select Insert. Select Entire column. Click the OK button. 
A column is inserted to the left of the selected cell. 
 15. 
 Right-click cell C4 and then select Delete. Select Entire column. Click the OK button. 
 16. 
 Click row head 6. Hold down your Ctrl key and click row heads 7, 8, and 9. 
Right-click any of the selected row heads and then select Insert. 
 You should now have a blank row between each of your rows. 
 
■ Note When making selections your selected rows, columns, or cells do not have to be adjacent. 
 Figure 4-66.  Type the data from this worksheet 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ FORMATTING AND ALIGNING DATA
143
 You have learned how to insert and delete rows and columns as well as how to hide and unhide them. 
You should only let users who actually need to view the data access to it; you should hide anything that they 
don’t require. You also learned to insert and delete individual cells. You will often discover that you forgot to 
make an entry. Excel makes it easy to correct this oversight by letting you insert a new cell where it is needed 
and then moving the data below it down one row or moving the data to the right of it over one column.  
 Summary 
 Formatting a worksheet can make it more visually appealing and easier to understand. It can also be used to 
change how numeric and date data are displayed. Formatting can be used to create word wrapping, rotating 
text, and shrinking text. Formatting is also used to align data. You can use Excel’s Format Painter to copy all 
the formatting applied to a cell to other cells. You’ve practiced using color effectively and learned how to 
create a uniform graphic style for worksheets. This is an important aspect of developing presentations that 
are professional in appearance and providing a signature look for your projects. Excel makes formatting 
easier by providing quick access to the tools you need most often by placing them on two mini- toolbars. You 
have seen how to hide and unhide rows and columns and how to insert and delete cells, rows, and columns. 
You have also seen how to apply borders and how to draw them. 
 In Chapter   5 , you’ll continue to refine how the workbook is set up by using headers and footers, setting 
the page breaks, dividing worksheets into multiple panes, and learning more functions. You’ll also be learning 
about custom views and how to print select portions of the worksheet for specific data reporting purposes.

 CHAPTER 5  
 Different Ways of Viewing and 
Printing Your Workbook 
 Excel allows you to enter a tremendous variety and amount of data into one worksheet and then extract 
only the data you need to share with clients or employees. Sometimes you don’t need to print the entire 
workbook or the entire worksheet. In this chapter you’ll be learning how to view and print only the data 
relevant to your task. You may be dealing with a geographic area or a particular salesperson and you only 
want to show what is relevant to each person. Print layout view lets you see how worksheets will look when 
printed, which is very important because screenshots can be quite different from the final printed product. 
 After reading and working through this chapter you should be able to
• 
 Insert, remove, reset, and change the location of page breaks  
• 
 Repeat row and column headers on all pages 
• 
 Use preset headers 
• 
 Create your own headers and footers 
• 
 Create a print area, add to it, and remove it 
• 
 Print a portion of a worksheet 
• 
 Use Paste Special to assemble a printable worksheet  
• 
 Create your own custom views 
• 
 Use the Synchronous Scrolling feature 
• 
 Divide a worksheet into multiple panes 
• 
 Freeze rows and columns 
 Views 
 So far we have been looking at the worksheets in the  Normal view , but this isn’t the only view available. In 
addition to the Normal view, there is a  Page Break Preview and a  Layout view.  The different views can be 
accessed from the View tab on the Ribbon.  Page Break Preview is used for adjusting page breaks. This view 
lets you insert, change, remove, and reset page breaks.  Page Layout view  provides a quick way to add, edit, 
and delete headers and footers. It also lets you visualize how your workbook will look when printed. You can 
also create your own  custom views . 
 The Workbook Views are located on the Ribbon’s View Tab. See Figure  5-1 . 

CHAPTER 5 ■ DIFFERENT WAYS OF VIEWING AND PRINTING YOUR WORKBOOK
146
 The Normal view, Page Break Preview, and Page Layout view buttons also appear on the right side of Excel’s 
task bar. These three buttons    
 perform the same functions as those in the Workbook 
View group. If you do not see them on your task bar, right-click the task bar and select View Shortcuts. 
 
■ Note   Normal view and Page Break Preview do not display headers and footers but Page Layout view does. 
 There is also a Print Preview which you will use in this chapter. The Print Preview is not a part of Workbook 
views. Print Preview is only used for seeing exactly how your worksheet will be printed. 
 Page Break Preview 
 There are two  types of page breaks: those that are created automatically by Excel and those you create 
manually. Automatic page breaks adjust whenever you do such things as change the row height or column 
width, delete or add columns or rows, change page size, change page orientation, change margins, and so on. 
 In Normal view page breaks appear as dashed lines. In Normal view you can insert, remove, and reset 
page breaks. You can’t, however, drag page breaks to a new location like you can in Page Break Preview. 
Page break lines are also much easier to see in Page Break Preview. The way you insert, remove, and reset 
page breaks is done the same way in both Normal and Page Break Preview. Therefore, we will only look at 
performing these steps in the Page Break Preview mode. 
 Printing a worksheet that contains a lot of columns can be a challenge. Excel may not be breaking 
up your report (printed worksheet) the way you want it to. You can change from  Portrait  to  Landscape 
orientation so that you have more width to your paper but you still may end up with some columns printing 
on a separate page.  Page Break Preview is used for adjusting page breaks. This view lets you insert, change, 
remove, and reset page breaks. 
 Page Break Preview shows a minimized view of your data. The data is separated by horizontal and 
vertical blue dashed lines that represent page breaks. You can change the location of a page break by 
dragging a blue line to where you want the break to occur. If you change the location of a page break, the line 
changes from a dashed line to a solid line. If you insert a new page break, it will also display as a solid line. 
This makes it easy to identify changes that you have made from the page breaks that Excel originally created. 
 
EXERCISE 5-1: USING PAGE BREAKS AND PREVIEWS
 In this exercise you will practice creating vertical and horizontal page breaks. You will also practice 
moving and removing them.

 Go through the other pages; they all have column and row headers. 
 9. 
 Click the Return button   
 . 
 You have learned how to insert, remove, and rearrange page breaks so that you can control where page 
breaks occur. You also learned how to make the row and column heads appear on each page of a report. 
Next, you will see how to add headers and footers to your worksheets in the Page Layout View.  
     Page Layout View 
 Page Layout view provides a quick way to add, edit, and delete headers and footers. It shows what your 
printout will look like relative to a horizontal and vertical ruler along with the breaks between pages. You can 
easily change margins and then instantly see the results. Page Layout view works similar to Normal view; you 
can still add and edit data and apply formatting. 
 Figure 5-6.  Select Gridlines to print the data within gridlines 
 Figure 5-7.  Click the Zoom to Page button 
 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ DIFFERENT WAYS OF VIEWING AND PRINTING YOUR WORKBOOK
152
 Page Layout view displays a horizontal ruler and vertical ruler that moves to another page when you 
move to another page. You can adjust your borders by dragging the ruler to the location you want. As you are 
dragging your mouse pointer, a line moves at the same time showing you where the margin is. If you want 
your margin at a certain inch this is not the place to do it because it doesn’t display the change in inches as 
you are dragging. 
 The Page Layout view displays three  header sections , and three footer sections. If you click one of the 
header or footer sections, a new contextual tab will be added to the Ribbon named  Header & Footer Tools. 
See Figure  5-8 . A header prints at the top of each page. A footer prints at the bottom of each page.  
 
EXERCISE 5-2: USE PAGE LAYOUT VIEW
 In this exercise you will use the Page Layout View to add and change headers and footers and to remove 
whitespace between pages.
 1. 
 Use workbook Chapter   5  . Click the Months worksheet. 
 2. 
 Click the Page Layout view button  
 on the Workbook’s status bar. 
 You should see on the status bar that we are looking at page 1 of 4. 
 3. 
 Change the Zoom tool so that you can see all pages at the same time. 
 4. 
 Press Ctrl + Home to go to cell A1. 
 Change the    Header and Footers  
 1. 
 Change the Zoom tool so that you can see the text  Add Header above the 
worksheet. Move your mouse pointer to the  Add header text. The section should be 
selected. See Figure  5-9 . 
 2. 
 Move your mouse pointer to the left of that section and the left section will be selected. 
Click inside the left section. Whenever a Header or Footer section is active the Ribbon 
will have a  Design tab appearing under the heading  Header and Footer Tools .

153
 3. 
 Click the Design tab. In the Header & Footer group, click the Header button. Excel 
displays a list of preset headers. See Figure  5-10 . 
 The data that will print in each section of the header is separated by commas:
• 
 The preset headers that contain no commas will display in the middle header 
section. 
• 
 For those that contain one comma, the text to the left of the comma will appear in 
the middle Header section. The text to the right of the comma will appear in the 
right section. 
• 
 For those that contain two commas, the text to the left of the first comma will 
appear in the leftmost Header section. The text to the right of the first comma 
will appear in the middle section. The text to the right of the second comma will 
appear in the right-most section. 
 4. 
 Click the preset header that consists of the username, the page number, and the 
current date.

 7. 
 Click the words Add Footer so that you can see the three footer sections. 
 8. 
 Click the Design Tab. In the Header & Footer group, click the Footer button. 
 Excel displays a list of preset footers. Just like with the headers the commas are 
used to identify which section the text will go in. 
 9. 
 Click the preset footer  Page 1 of ? . The preset footer didn’t contain a comma; 
therefore it displays in the middle section. 
 10.  Click inside the middle section. The code  Page &[Page] of &[Pages] used to 
create the footer is displayed. We would prefer the text to appear in the right 
section. Press  Ctrl + X to cut the text. Click inside the right section. Press Ctrl + V 
to paste it. Click inside the middle section. You should now see the text in the right 
section. 
 11.  Click the Ribbon’s Design tab, in the Navigation group, and then click the  Go to 
 Header button. 
 Print the   Worksheet  
 1. 
 Click the Ribbon’s File tab. Click  Print in the left pane. 
 2. 
 You should see the worksheet with three headers. Scroll down to the bottom of the 
page if you need to, to see the footer  Page 1 of 4 . Go through the other pages. The 
headers and footers are the same on each page. 
 3. 
 Click the Print button if you want to print the report. 
 4. 
 Click the Return button   
 . 
 Change the   Scale and Alignment of your Headers and Footers  
 1. 
 Click any one of the three Header sections at the top of the page. Click the Design tab. 
 The Options group (Figure  5-11 ) contains options for your headers and footers:
• 
 One option is for making one set of headers and footers for the first printed page 
while all of the other pages will have a different set of headers and footers. 
• 
 Another option is to have one set of headers and footers for the odd pages and 
another set for the even pages. 
• 
 The  Scale with Document option when selected scales the size of the headers and 
footers so that they are proportionate to any changes you made to the print scale 
to fit in more or less information on your printed page. 
• 
 The  Align with Page Margins when selected places the headers and footers within 
the page margins that you set up. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ DIFFERENT WAYS OF VIEWING AND PRINTING YOUR WORKBOOK
155
 2. 
 Remove the check mark for the  Align with Page Margins option; as you do so, 
notice how your header spreads out. 
 3. 
 Remove the check mark for  Scale with Document . Notice how your header text 
increases in size. 
 4. 
 Turn the  Scale with Document and  Align with Margins back on.

 14.  Click the Ribbon’s Design tab. In the Header & Footer group, click the Header 
button. Select  Page 1 of ? . 
 15.  Click inside the Page Header area to see the results. 
 16.  Scroll through the pages. You should see that the headers are different for odd and 
even pages. 
 Remove Whitespace   Between Pages  
 There is a lot of whitespace between each of our pages. Removing the whitespace would make the 
worksheet easier to read.
 1. 
 Move your mouse pointer to the vertical blank space between pages 1 and 3 and 
click. See Figure  5-12 . 
 Figure 5-11.  Options for how you want your headers and  footers  to appear 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ DIFFERENT WAYS OF VIEWING AND PRINTING YOUR WORKBOOK
156
 2. 
 Scroll down. You should see that all of the whitespace between the pages has been 
removed. 
 
■ Note The worksheet is easier to read now, but you can’t see the headers or footers. Clicking between the 
pages will put the whitespace back. You can again view the headers and footers. 
 Turn the   Show Options Off and On  
 1. 
 Click the View tab. In the Show group there are check boxes for Ruler, Formula Bar, 
Gridlines, and Headings. See Figure  5-13 . 
 2. 
 These options only affect how the worksheet is displayed. They have no effect on how 
the worksheet is printed. The ruler option is only available in Page Layout view. The 
 Headings are the row numbers and column head letters. Remove the check mark for 
each one of these options. As you do so, notice its effect. Then turn them all back on.  
 3. 
 Switch to Normal view by clicking the Normal View button  
 on the status bar. 
 You’ve used the Page Break Preview and Page Layout views. Now, you’ll return to the Normal view to 
see different ways of selecting what you to want to print.

 Printing  
 Spreadsheets can be huge. Aligning the pages and getting the margins just the way you want on a large 
spreadsheet can be difficult. But chances are you don’t want to print all of the information from a large 
spreadsheet. If you only want to print a portion of a worksheet, you can do this in several ways.
• 
 Hide the rows or columns you do not want to print.  
• 
 If the cells that you want to print are not adjacent, you can select the cells from one 
area that you want to print then hold down your Ctrl key and select other areas to print.  
• 
 Copy the different ranges you want to print to another worksheet in the order 
that you want to see it printed. You can use paste links so that the data is updated 
dynamically. Then print the worksheet that contains only the data you want to print 
in the order that you want to print it. 
• 
 Set up print areas. Print areas can be expanded as needed or can be cleared. Only the 
print areas will be printed unless you select the option to Ignore Print Area. 
 The following sections will guide you through using Print Areas and assembling a printed report in the 
order you want. 
 Creating a Print Area 
 You can elect to print only the portions of the spreadsheet you need by selecting one or more ranges that 
you want to print and then making those ranges a  Print Area . Set up a Print Area if you will be frequently 
printing only those areas of the worksheet. 
 A Print Area can be set up by selecting the cells you want to print and then clicking the Print Area button 
located in the Page Setup group on the Page Layout tab. See Figure  5-14 . Selecting the  Set Print Area creates 
the print area. The  Add to Print Area option only appears if you have already set up a Print  area  .  
 Excel saves the selected cells as a named range automatically naming it Print Area. You can only have 
one Print Area but the Print  Area can contain multiple ranges. 
 Figure 5-14.  Print Area button 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ DIFFERENT WAYS OF VIEWING AND PRINTING YOUR WORKBOOK
158
 Adding Additional Cells to the Print Area 
 Additional Cells can be added to the Print  Area after you have created it by selecting those cells and then 
clicking the Print Area button and selecting  Add to Print Area . 
 
■ Note   There is one irritating problem when using multiple ranges for Print Areas and that is Excel places a 
page break between the ranges. This means that each addition to the Print Area will appear on a separate page. 
 Removing the Print  Area 
 The Print Area can be removed by simply clicking the Print Area button and then selecting  Clear Print Area . 
 You would only use a Print Area if you were going to use it multiple times; otherwise you could select 
the areas you want to print and then click the Ribbon’s File tab, select Print from the left pane, click the down 
arrow for Print Active Sheets, and then select Print Selection. See Figure  5-15 . 
 
EXERCISE 5-3: PRINT A PORTION OF A WORKSHEET 
 The worksheet for this example contains data for a large corporation that is tracking sales for thirty-nine 
products sold in 17 of its stores.
 1. 
 Open the workbook Chapter   5  , which you have been using for this chapter, if it isn’t 
currently open. Click the Stores worksheet. 
 2. 
 Drag across column heads D through G. Right-click one of the selected column 
heads. Select Hide. 
 Figure 5-15.  Print only the selected area of the worksheet 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ DIFFERENT WAYS OF VIEWING AND PRINTING YOUR WORKBOOK
159
 3. 
 Drag across column heads L through R. Right-click one of the selected column 
heads. Select Hide. 
 4. 
 Click the Ribbon’s File tab. Select Print from the left pane. 
 5. 
 Notice that the hidden columns do not appear in the print preview. 
 6. 
 Click the Return button   
 . 
 7. 
 Add the data in Figure  5-16 to the worksheet as shown starting in cell U3. 
 8. 
 Select cells A1 through H9 (A1:H9). 
 9. 
 On the Ribbon’s Page Layout tab in the Page Setup group click the Print Area button 
then select Set Print Area. The name Print Area should appear in the Name box. 
 10.  Select cells U3 through V6 (U3:V6). You should see a thin line around the cells A1:H9 
indicating that you selected those cells for the print area. 
 11.  In the Page Setup group click the Print Area button and select  Add to Print Area. 
 12.  On the Ribbon click the File tab. Select Print from the left pane. 
 13.  The print preview area should show that you are looking at page 1 of 2. The cells 
you selected when you clicked on Add to Print Area are on the second page. Every 
time you use  Add to Print Area to add another selection it will print on a different 
page. If you want each section on a separate page, this works great; however, if 
you do not, you can use Paste Special which is discussed in the next section. 
 
■ Note If you change Settings to  Print Entire Workbook the Print Area will be ignored and the entire 
workbook will be printed. If you select  Ignore Print Area the Print Area will not be recognized by any of the 
Print options. See Figure  5-17 . 
 Figure 5-16.  Add this data to the worksheet 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ DIFFERENT WAYS OF VIEWING AND PRINTING YOUR WORKBOOK
160
 14.  Click the Return button   
 . 
 15.  On the Ribbon’s Page Layout tab in the Page Setup group click the Print Area button 
then select  Clear Print Area . 
 16.  Unhide the hidden columns. 
 You’ve learned how to print only the cell ranges that you want to print. Next, you will see how using 
Paste Special gives you more control over printing and helps overcome the problem of Excel placing page 
breaks between ranges. 
 Using Paste Special for Printing 
 If you want more control of where the different sections of your report will print, you can copy the sections 
you want to see in a report and then use  Paste Special to place them on a separate worksheet in the location 
that you want them printed. Another benefit of this is that you can copy the data from different worksheets.  
 
EXERCISE 5-4: USING PASTE SPECIAL TO ASSEMBLE A PRINTABLE 
WORKSHEET 
 In this exercise you will take different portions of a worksheet and assemble them on another worksheet 
which can be printed as a single page.
 1. 
 Use the Chapter   5  workbook. Create a new worksheet. Name the worksheet 
“Pasted.” 
 2. 
 Click the Stores worksheet. Select the cell range A1:E9. Press Ctrl + C to copy the 
data. 
 3. 
 Click the worksheet you named Pasted. Click inside cell A1. 
 4. 
 On the Ribbon’s Home tab in the Clipboard group, click the down arrow of the Paste 
button. Select  Paste Special which is the last option. 
 Figure 5-17.  Select  Ignore Print Area to prevent any print options from using the Print Area 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ DIFFERENT WAYS OF VIEWING AND PRINTING YOUR WORKBOOK
161
 5. 
 The Paste Special dialog box displays. Click  Paste Link . See Figure  5-18 . This 
creates a link between the data on the Stores worksheet and the data on the 
Pasted worksheet. 
 6. 
 Click the Stores worksheet. Select the range U3:V6. Press Ctrl + C to copy the data. 
 7. 
 Click the worksheet you named Pasted. Click in cell G2. On the Ribbon’s Home 
tab in the Clipboard group, click the down arrow of the Paste button. Select  Paste 
Special . 
 8. 
 The Paste Special window displays. Click  Paste Link . Widen column G to see all the 
data. 
 9. 
 Click the Stores worksheet. Select the range A17:D21. Press Ctrl + C to copy the 
data. 
 10.  Click the worksheet you named Pasted. Click inside cell A11. On the Ribbon’s Home 
tab in the Clipboard group, click the down arrow of the Paste button. Select  Paste 
Special . 
 11.  The  Paste Special window displays. Click  Paste Link . 
 12.  On the Ribbon, click the File tab. Select Print from the left pane. The print preview 
shows that you have managed to get the data you want in the location you want 
and still keep it on the same page. 
 13.  Click the Return button   
 . 
 Figure 5-18.  Paste Link creates a link between the copied and pasted data 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ DIFFERENT WAYS OF VIEWING AND PRINTING YOUR WORKBOOK
162
 14.  Click the Stores worksheet. Change the value in cell B2 from 900 to 820. 
 15.  Click the Pasted worksheet. Because you created a link cell B2 was updated with 
the value you entered on the Stores worksheet. 
 You’ve learned how using Paste Special gives you more control over printing than using Print Areas. 
Paste Special allows you to take data from multiple areas and arrange it in the order that you want to print it. 
Next, you will see how to view multiple copies of your worksheet at the same time. 
 Dividing the Excel Window into Panes 
 Large worksheets can be difficult to analyze. You can’t see your column heads and your column totals 
at the same time; therefore, whenever you’re looking at a total you have to scroll back to the top of the 
worksheet to view its column heading in order to know what the total represents. The same thing applies 
to your row totals and row headings. Another potential problem is that you want to compare the values in 
Column B with the values in column V but you can’t see both of them at the same time, so you have to scroll 
horizontally back and forth to do your comparisons. These types of problems can be solved by dividing your 
Excel screen into separate panes. A copy of your worksheet is automatically placed into each of the panes 
you create. This gives you the benefit of being able to view different areas of the worksheet at the same time. 
 The screen can be divided into two vertical panes, two horizontal panes, or a combination of the two 
which would give you four panes. 
 Here is how to create two  vertica l panes:
 
 1. 
 Click a column head.  
 
 2. 
 Click the Ribbon’s View tab. In the Window group, click the Split button. See 
figure  5-19 . The pane will split to the left of the selected column. 
 Here is how to create two horizontal panes:
 
 1. 
 Click a row head. 
 
 2. 
 Click the Ribbon’s View tab. In the window group, click the Split button. The 
pane will split above the selected row. 
 Here is how to create four panes:
 
 1. 
 Click a cell. 
 
 2. 
 Click the Ribbon’s View tab. In the window group, click the Split button. Split 
Bars appear above and to the left of the selected cell. See Figure  5-20 . 
 Figure 5-19.  Split Window button is highlighted 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ DIFFERENT WAYS OF VIEWING AND PRINTING YOUR WORKBOOK
163
 The  size of the panes can be adjusted by dragging the split bars to the location you want. 
 If no Splits bars are currently displayed, then clicking the Split button will display a horizontal and 
vertical bar at the center of the window (not the worksheet). See Figure  5-21 . 
 Placing a horizontal split bar on a worksheet adds an additional vertical scroll bar. Placing a vertical 
split bar on a worksheet adds an additional horizontal scroll bar. Placing a horizontal and vertical split bar 
on a worksheet adds an additional horizontal and vertical scroll bar. This provides the capability to scroll 
through each pane individually. See Figure  5-22 . 
 Figure 5-20.  Window split into 4 panes. Split is above and to the left of selected cell 
 Figure 5-21.     Split bars   appear at the center of the window       
 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ DIFFERENT WAYS OF VIEWING AND PRINTING YOUR WORKBOOK
164
 A  split bar can be removed from the worksheet by double-clicking it. You can remove both split bars 
at the same time by double-clicking the area where the two split bars meet. The Split button on the Ribbon 
works like a toggle switch. Click it to add split bars. Click it again to remove the split bars. 
 Freezing Rows and Columns  
 Freezing rows and columns is another way of resolving the problem of not being able to view your row 
headings and row totals at the same time or your column headings and column totals at the same time. 
 You can select one of three options when freezing your worksheet.
• 
 Freeze  Panes . You can freeze both the columns and rows that come before the 
current cell. If the current cell is C4 this means that columns A and B are frozen and 
rows 1, 2, and 3 are frozen. The rest of the columns and rows are scrollable.  
• 
 Freeze Top Row. You can freeze the top row of your worksheet so that it remains 
visible while scrolling through the rest of the worksheet. 
• 
 Freeze First Column. You can freeze the first column so that it remains visible while 
scrolling through the rest of the worksheet. 
 You can select one of the three options by clicking the View tab then clicking the Freeze Panes button 
located in the Window group. See Figure  5-23 . 
 Figure 5-22.  Horizontal and vertical scroll bars for separate scrolling of the four panes 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ DIFFERENT WAYS OF VIEWING AND PRINTING YOUR WORKBOOK
165
 Once you have frozen the worksheet using one of the three options, the first option will change from 
Freeze Panes to Unfreeze Panes. Clicking Unfreeze Panes will return you to normal viewing. 
 Synchronizing  Scrolling  
 You can use the New Window, View Side by Side, and Synchronous Scrolling options in the Window group to 
open a second copy of your workbook and view the workbooks side by side with the same worksheets having 
synchronized scrolling. 
 
EXERCISE 5-5: SYNCHRONIZE  SCROLLING  , SPLIT THE WINDOW INTO 
MULTIPLE PANES, AND FREEZE WINDOWS
 In this exercise you will split a worksheet into multiple worksheets. It appears as if there are multiple 
copies of the worksheet, but they are just separate views of the same worksheet that you can scroll 
together. You will also practice freezing rows and columns.
 1. 
 Open workbook Chapter   5 if it isn’t opened already. Click the Stores worksheet. 
 2. 
 On the Ribbon’s View tab in the Window group, click New Window. A second 
window opens with the Stores worksheet active. The name at the top of the 
workbook shows as Chapter   5 :2. The original workbook title bar shows Chapter   5  :1. 
 3. 
 On Chapter   5 :2, click the Ribbon’s view tab; in the Window group click View Side by 
Side. 
 4. 
 If you have other workbooks open in addition to the Chapter   5 workbook a 
 Compare Side by Side window appears from which you can choose the workbook 
you want to view side by side with it. You would select Chapter   5  :1.

 Create the Split Bars 
 1. 
 Click inside cell A3. On the Ribbon’s View tab, in the Window group, click the Split 
button. A split bar appears above the currently selected cell. You can drag the split 
bar to another location. Drag the horizontal split bar down so that it is between 
rows 7 and 8. Notice that you have two vertical scroll bars. See Figure  5-24 . 
 2. 
 Use the scroll bar in the top pane to scroll through the data in the top pane. 
 3. 
 Use the scroll bar in the bottom pane to scroll through the data in the bottom pane. 
As you can see you have two complete copies of your worksheet. Adjust your 
worksheets so that you can see cell B2 in both worksheets.  
 4. 
 Click inside cell B2 in the upper pane. When you select a cell in one pane it also 
selects it in the other pane. 
 5. 
 Type  500 in the cell. Press Enter. Cell B2 should now have a value of 500 in both 
worksheets. 
 6. 
 Double-click the split bar to remove it. 
 7. 
 Click cell G8. On the Ribbon’s View tab, in the Window group, click the Split button. 
This creates intersecting split bars above and to the left of the cell. See Figure  5-25 .

 Practice moving both horizontal and vertical scroll bars then adjust the four 
worksheets so that you can see the same cell in all four panes. Click one of the 
cells. Notice that it highlights the same cell in all four panes. If you make a change 
to one of the cells, it affects the worksheet in all four panes. 
 8. 
 Move your mouse pointer where both split bars meet. Your mouse pointer should 
turn into a double arrow. See Figure  5-26 . Hold down your mouse button and drag 
in any direction; both split bars will move with your mouse. 
 9. 
 Double-click where the two split bars meet to remove both of them.

 Freeze Panes 
 1. 
 In the Window group click the Freeze Panes button. The three options for freezing 
appear:
 a. 
 Click the one for freezing the top row. Scroll down through your data. The 
column headings will remain in their fixed location so that no matter what row 
you are in you can always see the column headings. 
 b. 
 In the Window group click the Freeze Panes button. The first option has 
changed to Unfreeze Panes. Click this option to remove freezing of the top row.  
 c. 
 Click the Freeze Panes button. Click the one for freezing the first column. 
Scroll to the right to the end of your data. The row headings will remain in 
their fixed location so that no matter what row you are in you can always see 
the row headings. 
 d. 
 Click the Freeze Panes button. Click Unfreeze Panes. 
 2. 
 Click cell B2 and complete these steps:
 a. 
 Click the Freeze Panes button. 
 b. 
 Click Freeze Panes. 
 c. 
 Scroll through to the end of your data vertically and horizontally. Both your 
column headings and row headings remain stationary. 
 d. 
 Unfreeze the panes. 
 3. 
 Practice with a different active cell and then freeze the panes. How does this affect 
the rows above and the columns to the left of the active cell?  
 You’ve learned how to freeze row and column heads so they remain stationary as you scroll. You 
have also learned to view multiple copies of your worksheet at the same time while keeping their scrolling 
synchronized. Next, you will see how you can specify the different ways you want to view a worksheet and 
then save those views as custom views. 
 Custom Views How to Create, Show, and Delete 
 If you or other users view your workbook in different ways, such as with different headers or footers, with 
different print areas or different margins, with different columns or rows showing, or with the data filtered, 
etc., you can save the different views as custom views. Each custom view is assigned its own name. When a 
custom view is opened it opens with all of its stored settings. 
 Before you create a custom view you need to set the workbook to appear exactly how you want it to 
appear and how you want it to print. When you are ready to save your current view, click the View tab. In the 
Workbook Views group click the Custom Views button. See Figure  5-27 . 

CHAPTER 5 ■ DIFFERENT WAYS OF VIEWING AND PRINTING YOUR WORKBOOK
169
 Clicking the Custom Views button brings up the Custom Views dialog box   shown in Figure  5-28 where 
you click the Add button. 
 Clicking the Add button brings up the Add View dialog box shown in Figure  5-29 where you enter the 
name you want to assign to the view. 
 After you have created your views you can switch to another view by selecting it from the Custom Views 
dialog box and then clicking the Show button. 
 
■ Note   You can’t create a custom view that contains a table.

CHAPTER 5 ■ DIFFERENT WAYS OF VIEWING AND PRINTING YOUR WORKBOOK
172
 This section showed you how to create your own custom views so that the same worksheet can be 
viewed in different ways. Each custom view is assigned its own name. All the custom views for the workbook 
are stored within the workbook. If you didn’t use custom views, you would have to save different versions of 
the workbook to get the same result. 
 Summary 
 Excel can display a spreadsheet in one of three different views. Normal view is the view you will use most of 
the time. Page Break view is useful for adjusting page breaks. Page Layout view provides a quick way to add, 
edit, and delete headers and footers. 
 Custom views allow you or other users to switch back and forth between different views of the same 
spreadsheet. An example would be you create one view to show all of your data, a second view to show 
certain columns, and a third view to print a portion of a worksheet. 
 You have split worksheets into multiple panes and then scrolled through the individual panes. You’ve 
practiced making the worksheet look the way you want it to and used many of the buttons you can see when 
you open Excel. Next, you will be learning about the “Backstage” which includes more options for saving the 
workbook in different formats and how to keep track of information about when the workbook was created 
and why. You’ll also practice how to share workbooks via e-mail. Other features and tabs discussed next 
include how to keep track of your recent work and how to use the navigation pane.

 CHAPTER 6  
 Understanding Backstage 
 The  File tab, unlike the other tabs, doesn’t bring up a series of groups with buttons on them; rather, it brings 
up what is called the Backstage. This area is called the Backstage because the options on the Backstage are 
things that are handled behind the scenes from the workbook such as handling files, printing, sharing and 
exporting workbooks, account information, and selecting the options that change how Excel works. It also 
displays information about the workbook. 
 After reading and working through this chapter you should be able to
• 
 Save a workbook in different formats 
• 
 Add and edit information about a file and its properties 
• 
  Use various options to print the workbook the way you want it to appear 
• 
 Send a workbook as an e-mail attachment 
• 
  Search for a template that meets your needs 
• 
  Open a workbook by browsing for it or by using the Recent list  
• 
 Specify the number of workbooks that appear in the Recent list 
• 
 Keep workbooks on the Recent list 
• 
 Place recently opened workbooks in the Navigation pane 
• 
 Set Excel Options 
 Backstage Overview 
 Figure  6-1  shows the Backstage. Clicking a group item in the Navigation  pane such as Info, New, Open, etc., 
displays information and options for that grouping in the area to the right. We will cover most of the groups 
in the Navigation pane. 
 The list that follows shows some of the things that you can do from Backstage:
• 
  Save files in many different formats 
• 
 Change printer settings 
• 
 Protect the workbook 
• 
 Save the workbook to OneDrive 
• 
  Give others rights to your workbook 

CHAPTER 6 ■ UNDERSTANDING BACKSTAGE
174
• 
 E-mail the workbook in various formats 
• 
 Add and remove personal information from the workbook 
• 
 Check the accessibility of your workbook for those with disabilities  
• 
 Check for compatibility with previous Excel versions  
• 
 Update Excel 
• 
 Change information on your Microsoft Account  
• 
 Specify the number of workbooks that appear in the Recent list 
• 
 Pin workbooks to the backstage pane 
• 
 Recover unsaved workbooks 
 Table  6-1 lists some of the groups from the Navigation pane and describes them.  
 Table 6-1.  Backstage Navigation Groups and Their  Descriptions

 Info Group–Viewing, Adding, and Editing Information About 
the Workbook 
 The  Info group is displayed by default in the Backstage when you click the File tab. See Figure  6-1 . 
 
■ Note   If you start a new workbook and click the File tab without having made an entry into a cell, then your 
Backstage will display with the Open group selected. Excel assumes that since there are no entries you want to 
open a workbook. 
 The Info group displays  information about the currently open workbook and handles information 
related to it. We will first look at the Properties Pane tab; then we will look at the options in the middle pane 
for protecting and inspecting the workbook. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ UNDERSTANDING BACKSTAGE
175
 Properties Pane 
 When you look at a file in Windows Explorer you can see the file’s name, its date, and size, but often this isn’t 
enough information. Additional information about the file can be entered or viewed in the Properties pane, 
located to the right of the Info pane. At the bottom of the Properties pane you can click  Show All Properties 
if not all of the properties are currently showing. You can click  Show Fewer Properties if all properties are 
currently showing. 
 You can enter or edit the properties directly on this window. You can enter such things as the title, tags, 
categories, Company, and Manager. 
 Clicking the down arrow next to  Properties in the Properties pane brings up the Advanced Properties 
button shown in Figure  6-2 . Clicking the  Advanced Properties  button displays the Properties dialog box as 
shown in Figure  6-3 . 
 Figure 6-1.  Backstage when accessed from a workbook with data in  it 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ UNDERSTANDING BACKSTAGE
176
 Some of the information you enter in the properties dialog box can be viewed in the Properties pane. It 
is also displayed at the bottom of the Save As window as shown in Figure  6-4 . The information you enter here 
is useful as documentation and can help you search for the workbook.

 Protect Workbook Options 
 In the Info pane, clicking the Protect Workbook button brings up a menu of options for different ways of 
protecting your workbook. See Figure  6-6 . We will cover Mark as Final, Encrypt with Password, and Protect 
Workbook Structure. These aren’t the only options for protecting your workbook. We look at other ways to 
protect your workbook later in this chapter. 
 Figure 6-6.  Options for protecting a workbook 
 Mark as Final 
 Selecting Mark as Final will make your workbook read only. You won’t be able to make any changes to any 
worksheet and you won’t be able to create any new worksheets. Clicking the Mark as Final button will bring 
up the message box shown in Figure  6-7 . 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ UNDERSTANDING BACKSTAGE

 Clicking the OK button brings up the message window shown in Figure  6-8 . 
 Figure 6-7.    Excel asking if you want to mark the workbook as final 
 Figure 6-8.    Message informing that editing is complete and this is the final  version 
 The workbook opens with a  Marked as Final icon on the status bar and a message above the worksheet 
indicating that the author has marked the workbook as final to discourage editing. See Figure  6-9 . If you 
or anyone you give this workbook to decides that a change is necessary, it can be done by clicking the Edit 
Anyway button. Clicking this button allows you to make any changes or additions to any worksheet in the 
workbook.

 Encrypt with Password 
 Selecting this option requires you to enter a password and then verify it. It uses 128-bit advanced encryption 
to make your file more secure. You will need to use this password the next time you open the file. 
 
■ Note   Microsoft does not provide a way to recover passwords created in Microsoft Office. 
 Protect Workbook Structure 
 This option prevents users from adding or deleting worksheets; hiding and unhiding worksheets; and moving, 
copying, or renaming worksheets. You can add a password to this option if you desire. See Figure  6-10 .  
 Figure 6-10.    Structure protection selected to prevent user from making  changes         
 Figure 6-11.    Message notifying user that the structure has been locked and a password is required to open the 
workbook 
 If password protection has been applied to the workbook and if protection for workbook structure has 
been applied, the Protect Workbook area would notify you of this. See Figure  6-11 . 
 Check for Issues 
 Just to the right of the Check for Issues button is the Inspect Workbook area. The Inspect Workbook shows 
items that have not been resolved. See Figure  6-12 . These are not problems that will keep your workbook 
from working.  
 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ UNDERSTANDING BACKSTAGE
181
 The  Check for Issues button has options for checking if the workbook contains personal information, 
checking if the workbook can be easily read by users with disabilities, and checking for compatibility with 
previous Excel versions. See Figure  6-13 . We will cover the Inspect Document and Check Compatibility. 
 Figure 6-12.  Inspect Workbook shows items that have not been resolved 
 Figure 6-13.  Check for Issues options 
 Inspect Document 
 The Document Inspector helps you find personal and hidden information that you may want to remove 
before sharing this document with anybody else. If you run Inspect Document before you have saved your 
Excel workbook, you will get the warning message in Figure  6-14  that you should click Yes to save the file 
now, otherwise you might lose some of your data. 
 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ UNDERSTANDING BACKSTAGE
182
 If you have already saved the file or you have responded to the message in Figure  6-14 , then the 
Document Inspector dialog box displays. See Figure  6-15 . Check each check box in the Document Inspector 
that you want to check.

CHAPTER 6 ■ UNDERSTANDING BACKSTAGE
183
 Clicking the Inspect button inspects for those items that you have checked. If Excel finds personal 
or hidden data for any option you have selected, it will display a  Remove All  button for that option. See 
Figure  6-16 .

 Figure 6-17.  Compatibility Checker 
 Check Compatibility 
 Excel 2016 has capabilities that previous versions did not. If you want to share a 2016 workbook with 
someone else who doesn’t have 2016 you will want to run the Compatibility Checker. The Compatibility 
Checker gives a report on what functionality may be lost and how many times that functionality occurs in the 
workbook. See Figure  6-17 . If you save a workbook in the Excel 97-2003 format the  Compatibility Checker   
will run automatically. Workbooks in the 97-2003 format have a file extension of  .xls . Workbooks starting 
with version 2007 have an extension of  .xlsx . 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ UNDERSTANDING BACKSTAGE
185
 Clicking the  Select versions to show button in the Compatibility Checker brings up the Excel versions 
to test for. See Figure  6-18 . The Compatibility Checker will test for compatibility with the Excel versions you 
have selected.  
 Figure 6-18.  Select which Excel versions to test for 
 Select the check box for  Check compatibility when saving this workbook  to have Excel check for 
compatibility each time you save this workbook. 
 New Group—Creating a New Workbook 
 You can create a new workbook by clicking New in the Navigation pane of Backstage or by pressing Ctrl + N 
while not in Backstage. Selecting  New from the Navigation pane allows you to create a new blank document 
from scratch, but if the project you are going to create is similar to one of the vast number of pre-built 
 templates  , you might want to consider using one of them instead (see Figure  6-19 ). As the saying goes, “No 
sense in reinventing the wheel.” 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ UNDERSTANDING BACKSTAGE
186
 Figure 6-19.  Search for a  template or select one 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ UNDERSTANDING BACKSTAGE

 If you select one of the template categories, Excel displays available templates in that category and 
provides other categories on the right for you to select from. See Figure  6-20 . 
 Figure 6-20.  Available  templates for selected category on left; additional categories on right side 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ UNDERSTANDING BACKSTAGE
188
 Double-click the template you want to use. Excel opens a new workbook that uses that template. If 
you want to see a larger view of the template before you open it you can single-click it. See Figure  6-21 . You 
can use the Next and Previous buttons to view other templates. You can click the Create button to open the 
template. 
 Figure 6-21.  Single-clicking a  template shows an enlarged view of it 
 Open Group—Open a Workbook 
 From the Open group you can browse for a workbook or select it from a Recent list. You can pin a workbook 
if you want it to remain in the Recent list. 
 Opening an Existing Workbook 
 From the Open group in the Backstage view you can open a workbook by doing one of the following:
• 
 Select a workbook from the Recent list 
• 
 Select a location of an Excel file such as OneDrive or a web location.  
• 
 Select PC to find an Excel file on your local computer or network. You may need to 
click the Browse button to get to the workbook file location. 
 Opening a Workbook from the  Recent List 
 If you used the workbook recently it would be easier to open the file by selecting Recent in the middle pane. 
Selecting Recent displays a list of the workbooks that you have opened recently. The most recent one would 
be at the top of the list. Excel breaks it down into workbooks you used Today, Yesterday, This Week, Last 
Week, and Older. Excel shows the file name, its path, and to the right of that the date and time it was saved. 
See Figure  6-22 . 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ UNDERSTANDING BACKSTAGE
189
 If the workbook you need to open isn’t in the  Recent list  , you can use one of the other options such as 
accessing workbooks from OneDrive or other locations on your PC.  
 Keeping Workbooks on the  Recent List 
 When you move your mouse cursor over a workbook name in the Recent list in the Backstage you see a pin 
to the right of the workbook name. See Figure  6-23 . 
 Figure 6-22.  Recently used workbooks and where they are stored 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ UNDERSTANDING BACKSTAGE
190
 Clicking a pin will change the pin view from horizontal to vertical  
 . When the pin displays vertically, 
the workbook associated with that pin will remain on the Recent list no matter how many files you open and 
close. Pinned items are displayed at the top of the Recent list. See Figure  6-24 . You can unpin the workbook 
by clicking the pin again. 
 Figure 6-24.    Pinned workbooks stay at the top of the Recent list       
 Figure 6-25.  Context menu with six  options 
 Figure 6-23.  Pins 
 Right-clicking a workbook in the Recent list brings up a context menu with six options, including Pin to 
list, which works the same way that clicking the pin next to the file does. See Figure  6-25 . 
 
 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ UNDERSTANDING BACKSTAGE
191
 In addition to pinning or unpinning a workbook from this menu, you also can choose to
• 
 Open the workbook. 
• 
 Open a copy of the workbook which keeps your original protected. 
• 
 Copy path to clipboard—copies the path and the file name to the clipboard from 
where you can paste it into a worksheet. 
• 
 Remove the workbook from the Recent list.  
• 
 Remove all workbooks from the Recent list that are not pinned. 
 Options Affecting the Open Group 
 There are two options that you can set in the Options group that affect how many workbooks appear in the 
Recent list and how many will appear on another available list on the Navigation pane. 
 Specifying the  Number of Workbooks That Appear in the Recent List 
 How many workbooks appear in the recent list depends upon how many are specified in the Excel Options 
window. By default, the list shows the 25 most recent workbooks, but you can adjust that number higher or lower. 
To change the number that appear in the list click the File tab on the Ribbon, click Options in the Navigation pane, 
and then click Advanced in the left pane. You will have to scroll down to find the Display section. Change  Show 
this number of Recent Workbooks  to whatever you want. See Figure  6-26 . Click the OK button.  
 Figure 6-26.    Select the number of recent documents to display in  Backstage         
 Figure 6-27.  Checking the Quickly access option displays the number you entered of the latest used workbooks 
on the Navigation pane 
 Placing Recently Opened Workbooks in the Navigation  Pane 
 If you want even quicker access to your workbooks, select the next option in the Display section. Checking 
 Quickly access the number of Recent Workbooks places the number of workbooks that you specify on the 
Navigation Pane. See Figure  6-27 . 
 Figure  6-28 displays an example of how the Navigation pane looks when four workbooks are selected 
for quick access. These four workbooks will remain on the Navigation pane. Clicking one of these workbooks 
will open it. 
 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ UNDERSTANDING BACKSTAGE
192
 Save and Save As groups—Saving a Workbook Using Save 
or Save  As 
 While you are working in Excel everything that you create and import such as your data, charts, graphics, 
and so on are all stored in the computer’s  random access memory (RAM)  . Your RAM is only temporary 
storage. When you shut off your computer everything in RAM is cleared. This is why if something happens to 
your computer or if the power goes off you will lose all the additions and changes you have made since your 
last save. Additions and changes are not saved to your hard drive or other type of permanent storage until 
you perform a Save. When you save the workbook the information is taken from your RAM and stored in a 
file on your permanent storage. 
 If something goes wrong, such as the power going out, and you haven’t saved your work for quite some 
time, don’t panic because Excel may have already saved your work to your permanent storage device using 
the  AutoRecover feature which we will look at later in this chapter. 
 There are two backstage groups dedicated to saving a workbook: the Save group and the Save As group. 
Actually, Save isn’t much of a group because it contains no options. The Save As group is almost identical 
to the Open group which you have already seen earlier in this chapter . If you click the Save group and the 
workbook has previously been saved then Excel updates the workbook with your most recent changes. If you 
select Save and this is the first time you are saving the workbook, Excel opens the Save As window (this works 
the same as if you had clicked Save As). 
 Figure 6-28.  The four latest workbooks  used 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ UNDERSTANDING BACKSTAGE
193
 In the Save As window you must select a folder where the workbook will be saved. Next, you need 
to enter the file name for the workbook file. Excel uses the file name  Book1 by default. You will want to 
change the name to something that matches with what type of data the workbook contains; for example, if 
the workbook contains your Inventory as of June 30, 2011 then name it something like “ Inventory_063011  .” 
Next, you will need to select the  Save as type for the file you are saving. The default file type for Workbooks 
is  Excel Workbook . This is the format you will probably use most often. If you want to use a different format 
you can click the down arrow for the Save As type. As you can see in Figure  6-29 the workbook can be saved 
in a lot of different formats. 
 Figure 6-29.  You can save the file in one of many different  file types 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ UNDERSTANDING BACKSTAGE
194
 Excel automatically adds an extension to your file based on the file type that you have selected. 
 If you had entered  Inventory_063011 for the file name, your complete file name would be 
 Inventory_063011.xlsx . Windows explorer uses these types to determine what icon to display next to the file 
name. 
 The file name along with the path can be a maximum of 255 characters. The path is the drive and 
 folders you need to go through to get to your file. An example would be  C:\users\Annette\My Documents\
Inventory_063011.xlsx . You can use spaces in the file name but it is better to use an underscore to 
separate words. The following characters can’t be used in a file name: < > (angle brackets), | (pipe symbol) \ 
(backslash), ? (question mark), : (colon), * (asterisk), ”" (quotation marks). 
 An alternative to saving the workbook to your computer is to store the workbook online using  OneDrive. 
OneDrive is an online storage area provided for free from Microsoft. See Figure  6-30 . Clicking OneDrive 
brings up a Save As window just like when you save files to your personal computer or network. You can 
create folders in OneDrive just like you can on your hard drive.  
 Figure 6-30.  Save file to  OneDrive 
 Document Recovery 
 You should save your workbook often, but if you haven’t done a save and your system crashes or you 
suddenly lose power, don’t panic. Excel has a feature called AutoRecover which automatically saves your file 
at the interval you specify. The interval can be set between 1 and 120 minutes. The default time interval is 
10 minutes. See Figure  6-30 . I like to set mine at 5 minutes or less because I can make a lot of changes within 
that time that I wouldn’t want to lose. Shortening the time might slow down your computer depending upon 
the size of the file and number of changes made. 
 Clicking Options in the Navigation pane of the Backstage view brings up the  Excel Options window  . See 
Figure  6-31 . 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ UNDERSTANDING BACKSTAGE
195
 Clicking Save in the left pane of the  Excel Options window displays the options for saving workbooks 
and using AutoRecover. Here you can set the time interval between saves, the path where the AutoRecover 
files will be stored, if you want to keep the last autosaved version if you closed without saving, whether or not 
you want to disable AutoRecover for the current workbook, and so on. 
 Using the default time interval of 10 minutes, if you save your Excel workbook and then 29 minutes later 
the power goes out, you will have lost only the changes that you made during the last 9 minutes because 
Excel would have backed up your file at 10 and 20 minutes. When you reopen the file later, Excel will display 
the Document Recovery pane containing the Autosaved version of the file and the original version of the file. 
 Figure 6-31.  Excel Options window with Save tab selected 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ UNDERSTANDING BACKSTAGE
196
 If you click Don’t Save, your changes will be lost. 
 If you close your Excel workbook and you haven’t saved it and you have made changes to it after the 
time interval you set for AutoRecover, Excel will display the message in Figure  6-33 . 
 Figure 6-33.    Message that if choose not to save the file a temporary one will still be available 
 Figure 6-32.    Warning that you are closing the workbook before saving it 
 Closed a Workbook Without Saving 
 If you close a workbook without saving it and later decide that you really did need to save it, you may still be 
able to get back some or all of the changes depending upon what you set the AutoRecover time interval for 
and how much time elapsed since your last save. 
 If you close your Excel workbook and you haven’t saved it and any changes you have made to it have 
been done during the  AutoRecover time interval , Excel will display the message in Figure  6-32 . 
 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ UNDERSTANDING BACKSTAGE
197
 Clicking  Show Recovered Files brings up the files that Excel has recovered. See Figure  6-35 . 
 Figure 6-34.  You can choose to show any  recovered files 
 If you click Don’t Save you can recover at least some of the changes you made. 
 If there are no other workbooks open when you start Excel and there are files that Excel has  recovered , 
you will see the pane in Figure  6-34 . 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ UNDERSTANDING BACKSTAGE
198
 Clicking any of the recovered files in Figure  6-35 displays a drop-down arrow. Clicking the drop-down 
arrow displays a context menu from which you can select Open, Save As, or  Delete,  or Show Repairs. See 
Figure  6-36 . 
 Figure 6-35.  Recovered files that you can save 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ UNDERSTANDING BACKSTAGE
199
 Selecting Show Repairs will open the file and display a message if the file contains any errors and if any 
repairs were made to the file. 
 If you close Excel and have not deleted the Autosaved files, Excel will ask if you want to view the files 
later or remove them. See Figure  6-37 . If you select “Yes, I want to view these files later,” Excel will keep the 
files and display them in the Document Recovery pane the next time you start Excel.

 Figure 6-36.  Options for  recovered files 
 If you open a workbook that has unsaved changes, Excel will display a message next to the Manage 
Workbook button. See Figure  6-38 . 
 Click the Manage Workbook button to see if there are any other  recoverable unsaved workbooks . See 
Figure  6-39 .

 Double-clicking the Unsaved file opens the file in Excel. You will see the message shown in Figure  6-41 . 
Click Save As and assign the workbook a new name. 
 
■ Note   You should recover any unsaved file immediately after you realize it wasn’t saved because these 
unsaved files are only kept temporarily. 
 
 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ UNDERSTANDING BACKSTAGE
201
 Saving Workbooks with Protections: Backups and Limiting Changes 
 You can set a password at the file level to prevent an unauthorized user from opening a workbook. You 
can also allow a user to open the workbook but not save any changes, except as a new file. In this section, 
we’ll see how to set up regular backups for your workbooks, protect the original file using Read Only, and 
password-protect your workbooks. 
 With the workbook you want protected open, and click the Ribbon’s File tab. Click Save As in the 
Navigation pane. In the Save As dialog box, click the Tools drop-down menu and select General Options. See 
Figure  6-42 . 
 Figure 6-42.  Tools options in the Save As dialog box 
 The  General Options dialog box opens. Click the check box for  Always create backup . This will create 
a backup file of the file you are saving in the same location. The file will be named  Backup of followed by 
the name you give the workbook. It will be given an extension of  .xlk . For example, if you name your file 
 Invoices.xlsx , the backup file will be named  Backup of Invoices.xlk . See Figure  6-43 . 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ UNDERSTANDING BACKSTAGE
202
 When you save your file the first time after having selected  Always create backup , only the original 
file will save, there will not be a backup. Let’s say you only entered a value in cell A1 and you name the file 
 Invoices.xlsx . Now you add to the worksheet by entering a value in cell B1 and save the workbook again. The 
 Invoices.xlsx file now contains values in cell A1 and B1, a backup is created named  Backup of Invoices.xlk 
which only contains the value in cell A1. Let’s do one more. 
 You add a value in cell c3 in the  Invoices.xlsx workbook and save the file again. Now the  Invoices.xlsx 
file contains values in cells A1, B1, and C1 but the backup file  Backup of Invoices.xlk only contains values in 
cells A1 and B1. The backup file stays one generation (copy) behind. 
 Check the check box for  Read-only recommended if you want to give the user the capability to view the 
workbook but not make any changes. 
 You can require that the user enter a password for both the  Password to open and  Password to modify , 
either one or neither. Remember, if you forget your password you can’t get it back. 
 Enter a password in the Password to open text box if you want to require that the user enter this 
password before opening the workbook. The user can view or change the workbook. 
 Enter a second password in the  Password to modify text box if you want to require that the user enter 
this password if he or she wants to modify the workbook. The user will be able to view the workbook as read 
only if he doesn’t enter the password. 
 You should enter both  passwords if you want to require that the user enter a password to open the 
workbook and then require them to enter a second one to modify the workbook. The passwords should not 
be the same. 
 If you entered a password for Password to open you will need to confirm that password. See Figure  6-44 . 
 Figure 6-43.    General Options with Always create backup  selected         
 Figure 6-44.  Confirm password if you entered a password for Password to open 
 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ UNDERSTANDING BACKSTAGE
203
 If you entered a password for Password to modify you will need to confirm that password. See Figure  6-45 . 
If you entered both passwords you will be required to confirm both of them.     
 Figure 6-45.  Confirm password if you entered a password for Password to modify 
 Figure 6-46.  Save the file using the selections you made 
 Clicking the Save button saves the workbook with the options you entered for General Options. See 
Figure  6-46 . 
 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ UNDERSTANDING BACKSTAGE
204
 If you entered passwords, you will be required to enter them once you have closed the workbook and 
reopened it.
• 
 If you required a password to open the workbook you will see the window in 
Figure  6-47 when opening the workbook.  
 Figure 6-49.    Message saying the file is read-only. If you want to save changes you will need to save the file 
with a new name 
 Figure 6-47.  Password required to open workbook 
• 
 If you required a password for modifying the workbook, another Password window 
opens. The user must enter a password in order to modify the workbook. She can 
open the workbook in Read Only without entering a password by clicking the Read 
Only button. See Figure  6-48 . 
 Figure 6-48.  Enter password to modify workbook or click Read Only button 
 If the user clicks the Read Only button, he can make changes to the workbook but when he tries to save 
it, he will not be able to, thus preventing any changes from being made. The user will get the message in 
Figure  6-49 . 
 
 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ UNDERSTANDING BACKSTAGE
205
 If a password is required to open the workbook and the user elected to use Read Only instead of 
entering the password for modifying, the Backstage will show as in Figure  6-50 . 
 Figure 6-50.  Backstage messages  
 Print Group—Printing a  Workbook 
 The left pane of the Print group (Figure  6-51 ) contains  Settings   for controlling how the worksheet or 
workbook is to be printed. Many of these same options are available on the Page Layout tab on the ribbon. 
The right pane of the Print group displays what the current document will look like when it is printed based 
on the print options used in the left pane. 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ UNDERSTANDING BACKSTAGE
206
 You should first make any necessary changes to the  Printer and  Settings    properties and then click the 
Print button to actually do the printing. 
 Selecting a  Printer 
 One of the decisions you will need to make is where you want your report printed to. You don’t have to print 
to a printer. You can print to programs, to other devices such as a fax machine, or to a file. Clicking the down 
arrow for the printer lists all your currently available options. See Figure  6-52 . What appears here depends 
upon what programs you have and what you have attached to your computer. If the printer you wish to print 
to isn’t in the list but is attached to your computer or network, click the Add Printer option.   
  Figure 6-51.  Printing options 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ UNDERSTANDING BACKSTAGE
207
 Printer Settings 
 The Printer Properties lets you select either landscape or portrait. The Advanced button in the Printer 
Properties gives options for the paper size and whether you want your graphic images to print at 600 or 1200 
dpi. 
 Selecting to Print Active Worksheets, an Entire Workbook, or a Selected 
Portion 
 The first option in the Settings area is for selecting whether you want to print only the current worksheet, the 
Entire Workbook, or just the area that you have selected. See Figure  6-53 . What you select here is reflected in 
the right pane. The  Print Active Sheets only prints those worksheets that you currently have selected. The 
 Print Selection prints the cells that you currently have selected.

CHAPTER 6 ■ UNDERSTANDING BACKSTAGE
208
 Selecting Which Pages to Print 
 The next Settings option lets you select what pages you want to print. The entries in Figure  6-54 will print 
only pages 2, 3, and 4. This is true even if you have selected  Print Entire Workbook 
 Figure 6-53.  Print options 
 Figure 6-54.  Enter the page range you want to print 
 Collating 
 Collating in Excel works just like collating on a copy machine. If you are printing a worksheet that is five 
pages and you select to print four copies, then selecting  Collated  will give you four sets of pages 1 through 5. 
Selecting  Uncollated  will print four copies of page 1, then four copies of page 2, then four copies of page 3, 
and so on. See Figure  6-55 . 
 Figure 6-55.  Collating options 
 
 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ UNDERSTANDING BACKSTAGE
209
 Orientation 
 You can print in a vertical format (Portrait) or a horizontal format (Landscape). Selecting Landscape is one 
way of printing more columns on a page. 
 Selecting  Paper Size 
 You will probably be printing on letter size (8.5” x 11”) paper, but if not, you can select another paper size. 
See Figure  6-56 . If you have a spreadsheet with a lot of columns you might try using legal size paper. Excel 
will automatically adjust your spreadsheet to reflect the selected paper size. 
 Figure 6-56.  Select output size 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ UNDERSTANDING BACKSTAGE
210
 Setting  Page Margins 
 You can use one of Excel’s preset margins for Normal, Wide, or Narrow or you can create your own custom 
margins by selecting  Custom Margins . See Figure  6-57 . 
 Figure 6-57.  Select margins 
 Clicking Custom Margins brings up the Page Setup window with the Margins Tab selected. See 
Figure  6-58 .  
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ UNDERSTANDING BACKSTAGE
211
 The Margins  tab has options for setting the top, left, right, and bottom margins of your page as well as 
setting margins for the header and footers. You can use the check boxes to specify how you want the data 
centered on the page. When you select  
 Horizontally,  
 Vertically, or both, the image in the middle of 
the tab will reflect your choices by showing how your data will be displayed on the report.  
 Selecting  Scaling Options 
 You can print the report at its actual size or you can select one of Excel’s preset Scaling options that shrink 
the text and objects on the report. See Figure  6-59 . 
 Figure 6-58.    Enter margins and how you want the data centered on the page       
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ UNDERSTANDING BACKSTAGE
212
 When you are printing a report you probably don’t want to have an extra page for a couple of extra 
columns or a few extra rows. This can make reading your data very difficult. As discussed previously, if there 
are too many columns to fit on a single page you could try switching to landscape mode. It will often be 
easier if you shrink the text and objects on a worksheet so that they fit on a single paper.    
• 
 Selecting  Fit Sheet on One Page will print everything that is on one worksheet on a 
single page. 
• 
 Selecting  Fit All Columns on One Page shrinks the printout so that it is one page 
wide, but your report may print vertically on more than one page.  
• 
 Selecting  Fit All Rows on One Page shrinks the printout so that it is one page high 
but your report may print horizontally on more than one page.  
• 
 If none of these options meet your needs you can select  Custom Scaling Options . 
Selecting Custom Scaling Options brings up the Page Setup dialog box with the Page 
tab selected. See Figure  6-60 . 
 Figure 6-59.  Select a Scaling option 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ UNDERSTANDING BACKSTAGE
213
 The scaling options here allow you to set the percentage of the actual size you want your report to be. 
The value you enter must be between 10 and 400 inclusive. 
 You can also specify how many pages wide by how many pages high you want the report. 
 
■ Note   The Page Setup option is located at the bottom of the Settings area in the Backstage. Clicking 
Page Setup brings up the Page Setup dialog box. This is the same Page Setup window you see when you 
click Custom Margins or Custom Scaling options. The Page Setup window includes some of the same options 
available in other areas of the Print panel plus some additional options. The Page Setup window can also be 
accessed from the Print Layout tab on the Ribbon. 
 Share Group—Sharing  Workbooks 
 The Share group enables you to share workbooks with others. You have multiple options, including sharing 
files that you have saved to OneDrive and sending files via e-mail.

 Sharing  Online with OneDrive 
 After you have saved a workbook to your OneDrive, click Share in the Backstage left panel. This brings up the 
Share panel in Figure  6-61 . 
 Figure 6-61.  Sharing options 
 Now that you have saved your workbook on OneDrive you can invite others to just view your workbook 
on OneDrive or you can let them make changes to it. Right-click the  Share with People button in the right 
panel shown in Figure  6-61 . This brings up the Share window shown in Figure  6-62 . Enter the e-mail address 
of those people you want to invite to use your workbook. You can select  Can Edit or  Can View . You can add a 
message. Click the Share button to send the e-mails.

217
 Sharing  Files Using E-mail 
 You can send your Excel workbook to others in any of the available formats as an e-mail attachment. See 
Figure  6-67 . Those people receiving your e-mail can then open it in their copy of Excel.  
 Figure 6-67.    Select the format you want the workbook e-mailed in       
 Clicking the  Send as Attachment button brings up Outlook (provided that you have a copy of Outlook) 
with the Excel workbook file already set as the attachment. See Figure  6-68 . The  Subject is filled with the 
name of the Excel workbook. You can then fill in the e-mail address of the person you are sending it to and 
perhaps a text message. Then click the Send button to send the attachment to that e-mail address. 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ UNDERSTANDING BACKSTAGE
218
 If the recipient of your e-mail doesn’t need to edit the workbook or doesn’t have a copy of Excel, then 
you can send him or her your workbook in Adobe’s PDF format or Microsoft’s XPS format. The advantage of 
sending a file in either one of these formats is that they have many viewing options and they don’t require 
the recipient to have the Excel program.  
 Account Group 
 Changes in your Account pane affect all of your Microsoft Office products. Here you can manage your 
Microsoft Office Account, check for Microsoft updates, and change your Office theme. You can also add an 
Office background pattern that appears on your title bar. 
 Summary 
 In this chapter you learned how to use the Backstage options to manage, edit, save, and print the workbook. 
You also went through protecting your workbooks, recovering them, and sharing them. 
 The next chapter shows you how to create formulas manually or by using a wizard. Excel functions are 
built-in formulas. Functions are what turns Excel into a computational power house rather than just a tool 
that allows data entry that you can nicely format and print.

 CHAPTER 7  
 Creating and Using Formulas 
 Formulas are created to give us the results from such things as adding the items we buy at the store, 
computing our taxes, computing our car’s miles per gallon, and so on. A formula in Excel is an expression 
that is computed and the results are placed in the cell that contains the formula. You can enter your own 
formulas or you can use of one Excel’s many built-in formulas. Excel’s built-in formulas are called  functions . 
 After reading and working through this chapter you should be able to
• 
  Enter formulas into a cell or into the formula bar  
• 
  Enter formulas using the correct order of precedence 
• 
 Copy formulas 
• 
  Use the Auto functions 
• 
 View all of the formulas on a worksheet 
• 
 Select named ranges to use in formulas 
• 
  Use absolute and mixed cell references 
• 
 Create and edit named ranges and constants 
 Formulas 
 Without the capability to enter formulas, Excel would merely serve as a sheet for data entry where you could 
align and format data and create graphs. Excel has formulas for totaling rows and columns, but Excel allows 
you to go way beyond that. You can use one of Excel’s built-in formulas or you can enter just about any 
formula you can think of. You can use very basic formulas or those that are extremely complex. If you want 
to solve the area of a triangle, you can enter the formula. Do you need to solve something using the quadratic 
equation? You can enter the formula for it. 
 Introducing Formulas 
 An example of a formula would be  = 5 * 6 . The expression returns a value of 30. Formulas always start with 
an equal sign (=). Table  7-1 lists  math symbols used by Excel and their meanings.  

CHAPTER 7 ■ CREATING AND USING FORMULAS
220
 Formulas can include specific values and cell addresses. When a cell address is included in a formula, 
it is not the address that is used in the formula but, rather, the value that is in that cell. The result of the 
expression is placed in the cell that contains the formula. 
 If I wanted to add the values in cell A3 and B3 and I wanted the result to be placed in cell C3 I would 
enter the formula as shown in Figure  7-1

 Entering an = sign as the first character in a cell tells Excel that what follows is a formula.  
 Entering Formulas 
 Formulas can be  entered in one of three ways:
• 
 Typing it directly into a cell 
• 
 Clicking the cells you want to reference in the formula separated by mathematical 
symbols 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ CREATING AND USING FORMULAS
222
• 
 Using your arrow keys to select the cells you want to reference separated by 
mathematical symbols 
 Typing the Formula into a Cell 
 When  typing the complete formula, you start by typing an equal sign then entering any values or cell 
references that would be separated by mathematical symbols. If you enter any cell references in the formula, 
Excel will highlight the cell address in the formula and it will place a border around the cell being referenced. 
It will highlight both of these in the same color. 
 The example in Figure  7-4 shows the formula you would enter in cell C1 to add the values in cells A1 
and B1. When entering A1 in the formula the background color of cell A1 and the text A1 will be the same 
color. Cell B2 will have a different matching color for its cell background and the text B1.   
 Figure 7-4.  Colors are used to show which cell is used for which operand 
 Creating the Formula by Clicking the Cells You Want to Reference 
 Creating formulas by  clicking the cells you want to reference is done by first entering an equal sign and then 
clicking any cells you want to reference separated by mathematical symbols. 
 Using Figure  7-4 as an example, you would do the following:
 
 1. 
 Click inside cell C1 
 
 2. 
 Type the equal sign 
 
 3. 
  Click cell A1 (Excel enters A1 into the formula) 
 
 4. 
 Type the plus sign 
 
 5. 
  Click cell  B1 (Excel enters B1 into the formula) 
 
 6. 
 Press Enter 
 Your formula would be the same as if you had entered it manually  =A1+B1 . 
 Creating the Formula Using Your Arrow Keys  
 The benefit of using your  arrow keys to enter a formula is that your hands never have to leave the keyboard. 
Using the same example, you would create the formula by doing the following:
 
 1. 
 Click inside cell C1 
 
 2. 
 Type an equal sign 
 
 3. 
 Press the left arrow key twice to select cell A1 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ CREATING AND USING FORMULAS
223
 
 4. 
 Type a plus sign 
 
 5. 
 Press the left arrow key once to select cell B1 
 
 6. 
 Press Enter 
 
EXERCISE 7-1: ENTERING FORMULAS
 In this exercise you will enter four formulas using different  math operations .
 1. 
 Create a new workbook named Chapter   7 . Rename the worksheet Sheet1 tab to 
“MarkUp.” 
 2. 
 Make the worksheet look like Figure  7-5 . 
 Figure 7-5.  Enter this data in your own workbook 
 Table 7.3 shows the formulas needed for each unfilled column. 
 Table 7-3.  Formulas Needed for  Spreadsheet

 Computing the Markup Amount 
 1. 
 Enter an  equal sign (=) in cell E3. Enter  d . Excel knows you are entering formulas 
and so it tries to be helpful by suggesting one of Excel’s  built-in functions that 
starts with a D. See Figure  7-6 .

 2. 
 We will look at  built-in functions later, but for now ignore the function choices and 
just enter  d3 . Excel provides a visual cue for your selection by putting a box around 
the cell that you entered in your formula. It makes the cell address and the box both 
blue. See Figure  7-7 . 
 Figure 7-7.  Cell address and its corresponding  cell are the same color 
 Figure 7-8.  Cell address and its corresponding cell are both  red

 4. 
 Press  Ctrl + Enter . The cell displays the value returned from the formula. The 
formula bar, however, shows the formula entered in the cell. See Figure  7-9 . 
 Figure 7-9.  Formula bar  displays the formula entered in the active cell 
 Computing the Markup % 
 1. 
 Enter an  equal sign (=) in cell F3. This time instead of entering cell addresses in 
the formula, you will click the cell you want to use and Excel will automatically put 
the address of that cell in your formula. Click  cell C3 . Excel places an animated box 
around cell C3 and places its address in the formula. 
 2. 
 Enter a  divide sign ( / ). 
 3. 
 Click cell  D3 . See Figure  7-10 . 
 Figure 7-10.  Formula entered for Markup % 
 4. 
 Press  Ctrl + Enter . The result is 0.631578947. This number might be rounded 
depending upon the width of the column. 
 5. 
 We would like to show the value as a percentage. Select the Home tab if it isn’t 
already selected then click the % icon in the Number group. The result is rounded 
up to 63%. 
 6. 
 We would like to have the number displayed with two decimal positions. Click the 
increase decimal button   
 twice. The value changes to 63.16%. 
 Computing the Cost of Goods Sold 
 1. 
 Click cell G3 and enter  =b3*. 
 2. 
 Click cell C3 and press the Tab key.

 Compute the Profit 
 1. 
 Click inside cell H3. You can use any combination of typing the cell reference 
or clicking the cell to get its reference for the profit formula. Enter the formula 
 =(b3*d3)–g3 in cell H3.  
 2. 
 Press Enter. See Figure  7-11 . 
 Figure 7-11.    Result of entering formula for  profit         
 Figure 7-12.  Add these  additional records 
 Copying Formulas 
 You used the  Fill Handle previously to AutoFill a series of values. The Fill Handle can also be used to copy 
formulas across rows or columns while it automatically adjusts the formula for the proper column and row. 
 If you copy formulas down through a column, the row number in the formula will be automatically 
adjusted to the current row where the formula is being copied to. If you copy formulas across rows, the 
column letter in the formula will be automatically adjusted to the current column of where the formula is 
being copied to. This automatic adjustment of row and column addressing is called  relative cell referencing 
because the cell addresses change relative to where the formula is placed. 
 
EXERCISE 7-2: COPYING FORMULAS USING AUTOFILL
 This exercise continues with the same worksheet from the previous exercise. You will add additional 
records and then copy the formulas you made previously into the new rows.
 1. 
 Add the additional records (rows 4–7) shown in Figure  7-12 . 
 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ CREATING AND USING FORMULAS
227
 2. 
 Click in cell E3. Drag the AutoFill Handle down from cell E3 through cell E7. See 
Figure  7-13 . 
 Figure 7-13.  Result of dragging the AutoFill  Handle down from cell E3 to cell E7 
 AutoFill copies the formulas to the other cells automatically. When AutoFill is used to copy 
formulas down through a column it automatically adjusts the cell references in the formula 
to the current row. 
 3. 
 Click cell E4. The formula in cell E4 is  =D4-C4 . The row was adjusted from 3 to 4. 
 4. 
 Click other cells in the column to see how their formulas were adjusted. 
 5. 
 Drag the AutoFill Handle down from cell F3 through F7. 
 6. 
 Drag the  AutoFill Handle down from G3 to G7. 
 7. 
 Drag the AutoFill Handle down from H3 to H7. 
 Your result should look like Figure  7-14 . 
 Figure 7-14.  Result of copying formulas

EXERCISE 7-3: COPY FORMULAS ACROSS COLUMNS
 You have seen how the AutoFill Handle automatically adjust the  row reference when copying formulas 
down in a column. Now we will look at how the AutoFill Handle can be used to automatically adjust the 
column reference when copying formulas across a  row .
 1. 
 Create a new worksheet named “ColumnRef.” Enter the values as shown in cells 
A1:D2. A colon between two cell addresses means the range between the cells. 
The first cell address, in this case A1, is the upper-left-hand cell of the range. The 
second cell address, in this case D2, is the bottom right cell of the range. See 
Figure  7-15 . 
 Figure 7-15.  Enter these values 
 Figure 7-16.  Enter formula in cell A3 
 Figure 7-17.  Result of using copying formula 
 2. 
 Enter  = a1-a2 in cell A3. See Figure  7-16 . 
 3. 
 Press Ctrl + Enter. 
 4. 
 Drag the AutoFill Handle in cell A3 across through cell D3. 
 Figure  7-17 shows the result of using the AutoFill Handle to copy the formula from cell A3 to 
cells B3, C3, and D3. 
 You can see in Figure  7-18 that Excel adjusted the column in the cell reference when it copied the 
 formula 
 
 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ CREATING AND USING FORMULAS
229
 You’ve learned how to enter formulas. Next, you will use Excel’s AutoCalculate Tools. These tools allow 
you to select a range of data and then click the Calculate tool you need. The formula is automatically applied 
to that data without you having to enter it. 
 AutoCalculate Tools 
 The  AutoCalculate Tools feature includes tools for summing, averaging, counting the number of cells that 
contain numeric data, and finding the largest or smallest value in a cell range. 
 AutoSum 
 The AutoSum feature provides a quick way to sum a range of numbers. The range could consist of a single 
cell or thousands of cells. The AutoSum feature automatically adds values that are in a  contiguous range. 
A contiguous range is one in which there are no empty cells. 
 The AutoSum feature is  located on the Ribbon’s Home tab in the Editing group. The icon for the 
AutoSum feature is the Greek capital letter Sigma   . Math and Science use   as a summation operator. 
See Figure  7-19 . 
 Figure 7-18.  Copied formula 
 Figure 7-19.  AutoSum feature 
 When you click the  AutoSum button , Excel first checks to see if there are any values above the current 
cell. If there are, Excel will sum the values above it; otherwise, it will check to see if there are values to the left 
of it and if there are it will sum those values. 
 In Figure  7-20 cell F2 was selected when the AutoSum button was pressed. Excel highlighted the 
numeric values to its left. If only one cell is selected when you click the  AutoSum button the Sum formula 
will display with the range of values that is being summed. If this isn't the range you want to sum, then you 
can change either the starting or ending cell addresses. 
 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ CREATING AND USING FORMULAS
230
 Clicking the  AutoSum button a second time or pressing the Enter key will display the results as shown in 
Figure  7-21 . The formula bar is displaying the formula created by AutoSum.  
  Figure 7-20.    Excel selects numeric values to the left when using AutoSum and displays the range that it is 
going to use 
 Figure 7-21.  Clicking  AutoSum a second time enters the resulting value in the cell 
 Figure  7-22  shows the results of having used the AutoFill Handle to copy the formula down through 
cell F5.  
 Figure 7-22.  Results of copying formula 
 
 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ CREATING AND USING FORMULAS
231
 Since we are summing rows, Excel automatically adjusted the row address for each of the copied cells.
• 
 Cell F3 contains the formula  =SUM(B3:E3) . 
• 
 Cell F4 contains the formula  =SUM(B4:E4) . 
• 
 Cell F5 contains the formula  =SUM(B5:E5) . 
 Next, we will look at adding both the columns and the rows at the same time, but before we do that let’s 
look at how you would clear the totals from column F. 
 The cell contents can be cleared by first selecting the cells to clear and then doing one of the following:
• 
 Clicking the Clear button  
 in the Editing Group and then selecting Clear Contents  
• 
  Right-clicking the selected range and then selecting Clear Contents from the context 
menu 
 Totaling the columns and rows all at once is done by first selecting the row and column cells where the 
totaled results will be placed. In the spreadsheet in Figure  7-23 , you would do it by selecting cells F2:F5 and 
then holding down the  Ctrl key and selecting cells B6:F6.  
 Figure 7-23.  Holding down the  Ctrl key lets you select mutliple cell ranges 
 Clicking the AutoSum button now will sum both the rows and columns. See Figure  7-24 . 
 Figure 7-24.  Result of summing rows and  columns 
 A faster way of summing the rows and  columns for a range of values is to select the values themselves 
along with one column to the right and one row below as shown in Figure  7-25 . 
 Then press the AutoSum button. The result will be the same as Figure  7-24 . 
 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ CREATING AND USING FORMULAS
232
 Handling Blank Cells in a Range 
 AutoSum does not include any cells in its range after reaching a blank cell. See Figure  7-26 . : If you wanted to 
include cell A2 in the total you would need to change A4 in the formula to cell A2.  
 Figure 7-25.    Select data plus the column to right and one row below before clicking AutoSum       
 Figure 7-26.  Change A4 in the Sum function to A2 
 Another way to change the range is to take one of the handles of the selected range and drag it so that it 
includes all the cells you want, as shown in Figure  7-27 . 
 Figure 7-27.  Drag selection handle to include cells you want included 
 
 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ CREATING AND USING FORMULAS
233
 Average, Count Numbers, Max, Min 
 If you click the down arrow besides the AutoSum button (Figure  7-28 ) you can see that Excel includes several 
other “Auto” functions. The functions are Average, Count Numbers, Max(imum), Min(imum), and More 
Functions. These “Auto” functions work the same way as AutoSum. 
 Figure 7-28.  Auto functions 
 Figure 7-29.  Select  Wrap Text 
 
EXERCISE 7-5: AUTOCALCULATE TOOLS
 In this exercise you will apply the AutoCalculate Tools AutoSum, Average, Max, and Min across rows and 
columns.
 1. 
 Create a new worksheet named “AutoCalculate.” 
 2. 
 Select cells B1:I1, which will be the cells containing your column headings. On the 
Home tab in the Alignment group click the Wrap Text button. See Figure  7-29 . Now 
your column headings will wrap and not be partially hidden. 
 3. 
 Enter the data for the workbook as shown in Figure  7-30 . 
 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ CREATING AND USING FORMULAS
234
 4. 
 Select the cell range B6:E6. Click the AutoSum button. 
 5. 
 Select the cell range B2:E5. Click the down arrow next to the AutoSum button. 
Select Average. 
 
■ Note When you use an “Auto” function Excel will place the results in the first blank row below the selected 
range when the range is in a column or, as in our case, include both rows and columns. If the range is just in a 
row, Excel places the result to the right of the range. 
 6. 
 Cell range B2:E6 is currently selected. Change the selection back to B2:E5. Click the 
down arrow next to the AutoSum button. Select Max. The Max function returns the 
highest value in a selected column or row. Store 2 sold the most in each quarter.  
 7. 
 Select the cell range B2:E5 again. Click the down arrow next to the AutoSum 
button. Select Min. See Figure  7-31 . The Min function returns the lowest value in a 
selected column or row. Store1 sold the least in quarters 1 and 4. Store4 sold the 
least in quarters 2 and 3. 
 Figure 7-30.  Enter this data

 8. 
 Select cells F2:F5. Click on the AutoSum button. 
 9. 
 Select cells B2:E2. Click on the down arrow of the AutoSum button. Select Average. 
Click cell G2. Use the AutoFill Handle to drag the formula down through cell G5. 
 10. 
 Select cells B2:E2. Click the down arrow of the AutoSum button. Select Max. Click 
cell H2. Use the AutoFill Handle to drag the formula down through cell H5. 
 Let’s look at another way of doing this. 
 1. 
 Click cell I2. Click the down arrow of the AutoSum button. Select Min. See Figure  7-32 . 
The function displays and a marquee appears around cells B2:H2. This is not the range 
we want.  
 Figure 7-32.  Wrong range selected 
 2. 
 Select cells B2:E2. The formula will adjust accordingly. See Figure  7-33 . 
 Figure 7-33.    Use the range B2:E2 for the for the MIN function       
 3. 
 Press Ctrl + Enter. Use the  AutoFill Handle to copy the formula down through cell I5. 
See Figure  7-34 .

 4. 
 Let’s improve the look of the spreadsheet. Let’s add commas to make it easier to 
read and color to distinguish the original data from the computed data. 
 5. 
 Type A1:I9 in the Name Box then press Enter. 
 6. 
 On the Home tab in the Styles group click the Cell Styles More button. See Figure  7-35 . 
Figure  7-36 shows what appears after clicking the Cell Styles More button.

 7. 
 Move your cursor over Comma[0] in the Number Format area. You can see how 
selecting this option will affect your worksheet by changing the data to having 
commas with no decimal position. Click Comma[0]. 
 8. 
 Enter A1:E5 in the Name Box then press Enter. 
 9. 
 On the Home tab in the Styles group click the Cell Styles More button.

 10. 
 In the Data and Model area click Input. 
 11.  Use the border button in the Font group to create a thick outside border around the 
same cells. See Figure  7-37 . 
 Figure 7-37.  Thick outside border 
 You’ve learned how to enter formulas manually and by using Excel’s AutoCalculate tools. When viewing 
the worksheet, you see the results of formulas but not the formulas themselves. In order to see the formula, 
you need to click the cell that contains the formula and then view it in the formula bar. 
 Viewing Formulas 
 Clicking a cell that contains a formula will display the formula in the formula bar, but wouldn’t it be nice to 
see all of your formulas at once? You can do this by holding down the  Ctrl key and pressing the Tilde Key (~). 
 You can print your spreadsheet while all of the formulas are visible. This gives you a record of your 
formulas and provides a convenient way of overviewing your work to make sure all of your formulas have 
been entered correctly. Figure  7-38 shows the results of using  Ctrl + ~ . 
 Figure 7-38.  Formula  view 
 You can return to normal view by clicking  Ctrl + ~ again.  
 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ CREATING AND USING FORMULAS
238
 Creating Named Ranges and Constants 
 Up to this point we have been using cell addresses in our formulas, but when we are thinking about 
computations we don’t normally think of cell addresses; we usually think in descriptive words. For example, 
when computing the company payroll, I am thinking  Hours * Rate not  B2 * C2 . We can also assign names to 
values that we know will not change. For example, I can assign the name PI a value of 3.14 and then use the 
word  PI in my formulas rather than the value 3.14. 
 Naming Ranges 
 We can assign a descriptive name to a range of cells and then use that name in our formulas. A name is 
assigned to a range of cells by selecting those cells and then entering a name for that range in the  Name Box. 
See Figure  7-39 . 
 Figure 7-39.  Enter range name in the Name Box 
 Names can’t be longer than 255  characters and they must start with a letter, underscore, or backslash. 
Names are not case sensitive. Clicking the down arrow next to the Name Box displays a list of all the named 
ranges in the workbook. Clicking one of them will highlight the cells belonging to that named range. 
 
■ Note   A common mistake people make is that they do not press the Enter key after they have entered a 
name in the Name Box. If you do not press the Enter key, the name will not be saved. 
 Another way of creating named ranges is to use the options available in the  Defined Names group which 
is located on the Ribbon’s Formulas tab. See Figure  7-40 . 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ CREATING AND USING FORMULAS
239
 Clicking the Define Name button brings up the  New Name dialog box. See Figure  7-41 . You can either select 
the cells you want to become a named range before you open the New Name dialog box or wait until it is opened 
and then select a range. You can also bring up the New Name dialog box by right-clicking the spreadsheet and 
selecting  Define Name from the context menu. Creating a named range by using the New Name dialog box gives 
you a couple of options that would not be available if you just entered a name in the Name Box.  
 Figure 7-40.  Defined Names group 
 Figure 7-41.  New Name dialog box 
 The  Name textbox in the New Name dialog box uses the column or row heading by default for the cells 
you selected before opening the New Name dialog box. You can change the name to whatever you want. 
 The purpose of the  Scope drop-down box is to let you select whether you want to make the named 
range available for formulas in the entire workbook or for just a particular worksheet. 
 You can enter a  Comment . The comment does not appear on the worksheet. It will appear only in the 
Name Manager which we will look at shortly. You can also name ranges in the Name Manager. 
 The  Refers to text box displays the range address of the selected cells. If you haven’t already selected the 
cells you want to name before you bring up the New Name dialog box you can select them at this time.  
 Naming Noncontiguous Ranges 
 To create a named range for a group of  noncontiguous cells, select the cells while holding down the Ctrl 
key and then enter a name for the group. In Figure  7-42  you could assign an appropriate name for all of the 
Quarter 1 values such as QTR1. You could add all of the Quarter 1 values by entering  =SUM(QTR1) in a cell or 
find the average value by entering  =AVERAGE(QTR1) . 
 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ CREATING AND USING FORMULAS
240
 Naming Constants 
 You can also use the New Name dialog box to assign names to  constants . A constant is a value that doesn’t 
change. For example, you can assign names to interest or tax rates. Enter the name you wish to assign to 
the constant in the  Name text box. Next, replace the current cell address in the  Refers to  text box with the 
constant value. If you are entering a constant that is a percent, you can enter the value with a percent sign 
such as 4.5%, or you could enter the decimal equivalent of .045. See Figure  7-43 . Assigning a name to a 
constant lessens the chance of errors. If I used the tax rate of 4.5% in ten cells and now the tax rate changes 
to 4.7%, how many cells am I going to have to change? That’s right I would have to find the ten cells and then 
change all of them. But, if I used a constant I would just change the constant value once to 4.7%.   
  Figure 7-43.  Assign a name to a  constant 
 Figure 7-42.  Create a named range for  noncontiguous cells 
 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ CREATING AND USING FORMULAS
241
 Name Manager 
 Clicking the  Name Manager button in the Defined Names group displays the Name Manager which lists 
the named ranges and constants. The Name Manager has buttons for Adding, Editing, and Deleting named 
ranges. It also has a Filter option for limiting which named ranges to display. 
 You can see in Figure  7-44 that the named range  Rate  had values in its range when it was created. The 
Gross Pay and Hours ranges were created before any values were placed in their cells. 
 Figure 7-44.    Range name Rate has values in it because they were there when the range was  selected 
 Editing Named Ranges and Constants 
 Clicking the  New button in the Name Manager window brings up the same  New Name dialog box we saw 
when we clicked on the Define Name button in the Defined Names group. To  edit a named range select the 
range you wish to edit from the list and then click the  Edit  button. The Edit Name dialog box (Figure  7-45 ) is 
similar to the New Name dialog box. From here you can change the Name, the Comment, and the location of 
a range or change the Constant value. 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ CREATING AND USING FORMULAS
242
 Deleting Named Ranges and Constants 
 The only way to remove a named range is to use the Name Manager. First you select the range(s) you want to 
remove and then press the Delete button. This brings up a warning dialog box that asks you to confirm the 
deletion (Figure  7-46 ). Removing a named range only removes the name associated with a range of cells. It 
does not remove the cells or the data in  them . 
 Figure 7-45.  Edit Name dialog box 
 Figure 7-46.  Message confirming that you want to  delete the named range 
     Using Column or Row Headings for Range Names  
 If you are going to create named ranges for multiple rows or columns, you may find it easier to let Excel use 
your row or column  headings as names for the named ranges. To do this you would first select the cells that 
your named ranges would include along with their column or row headings. See Figure  7-47 . 
 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ CREATING AND USING FORMULAS
243
 You would then click the  Create from Selection button in the Defined Names group. See Figure  7-48 . 
This would bring up the  Create Names from Selection  dialog box (Figure  7-49 ).  
 Figure 7-47.  Select headings along with data when creating range names for multiple rows or columns 
 Figure 7-48.  Create from Selection button 
 Figure 7-49.    Create Names from Selection dialog box       
 You would need to select Top row to get the column headings. Excel would assign the named ranges as 
follows:
• 
 Rate to cells B3:B8 
• 
 Hours  to cells C3:C8 
• 
 Gross_Pay to cells D3:D8 
 
 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ CREATING AND USING FORMULAS
244
• 
 Fed_Tax to cells E3:E8 
• 
 State_Tax to cells F3: F8 
 
■ Note   Named ranges can’t contain spaces. Excel puts an underscore in place of spaces when it uses row 
or column headings. 
 Selecting Named Ranges Rather Than Typing Them into Formulas 
 You can type named ranges directly into a formula such as  =Rate*Hours . If you don’t remember the name 
assigned to a range or you want to be sure you don’t misspell it, you can use the  Use in Formula  button in 
the Defined Names group. See Figure  7-50 . 
 Figure 7-50.  Use in Formula button 
 If you are just starting a formula, clicking one of the named ranges will place the equal sign along with 
the named range in the formula. For example, using our payroll example, we want to compute the gross pay 
in cell D3 by multiplying Rate times Hours. You would click inside cell D3 and then click the Rate in the  Use 
in Formula list box. This would create  =Rate . You would then type the * for multiplication. You would finish 
the formula by clicking Hours and then pressing the Enter key. 
 A quicker way to select named ranges or constants is to press F3. Pressing F3 brings up all the available 
names for you to select from.

 Creating Named Ranges Using   Define Name  
 1. 
 Select cells F3:F5. 
 2. 
 Right-click any one of the selected cells. Select  Define Name from the context 
menu. Excel assigns a name of State_Tax to the range. Excel got the name from the 
column heading. Names can’t contain spaces; therefore Excel filled in the space 
with an underscore. The  Refers to text box contains the selected range. 
 3. 
 Click the OK button. 
 Changing a   Name  or Its Range  
 You can’t change a name or its range in the Name Box. These changes can only be done through the 
Name Manager. The State Tax range is currently F3:F5 but it needs to be changed to F3:F8. Let’s also 
change the name by removing the underscore.
 1. 
 On the Formulas tab in the Defined Names group click the Name Manager button. 
 2. 
 Click State_Tax. Click the Edit button. The Edit Name dialog box appears. 
 3. 
 Remove the underscore from the name so that the name is StateTax. 
 4. 
 Tab to the  Refers to text box. See Figure  7-53 . An animated marquee appears 
around cells F3:F5.

 Select the cell range B3:B8 on the worksheet. The name box should now display 
the name Rate. 
 Changing the Size of the Name   Box 
 1. 
 Since your names can be as long as 255 characters you might need to widen the 
Name Box to see more of the name. 
 2. 
 Move your cursor to the right of the Name Box. When the cursor changes to a 
horizontal double arrow drag to the right to increase the size of the Name Box. As 
you increase the size of the Name Box, the function area shrinks and vice versa. 
Drag to the left to decrease the size of the Name Box. See Figure  7-55 . 
 Removing  a Named Range

 In the Defined Names group click the  Define Name button. 
 2. 
 Type  FederalTaxRate in the Name text box. 
 3. 
 Type  Fictitious Federal Tax rate for practice example in the Comment box. 
 4. 
 Type  =32% in the Refers to text box over the existing text. See Figure  7-57 . If you 
prefer you can use the decimal equivalent and type  =.32 .

 Click the OK button. 
 6. 
 Click the Name Manager button. You can see that the new constants have been 
added. 
 7. 
 Click the Close button. 
 8. 
 Click the down arrow for the Name Box. As you can see, constants do not appear in 
the Name Box. This is because they don’t refer to any particular cell. 
 Using Named Ranges in Formulas 
 1. 
 In cell D3, enter  =R . Excel brings up a list of all the built-in functions that start with 
R as well as all named ranges that start with R. See Figure  7-59 . 
 Figure 7-58.  Name of StateTaxRate assigned to the constant .08 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ CREATING AND USING FORMULAS
251
 Named ranges are easily distinguishable from functions because they have a different icon in front of 
them. The  
 icon represents named ranges. Notice that there is a  Rate named range which you 
created and a  RATE function. We want to use the Rate with the  
 icon in front of it. 
 2. 
 Click the  
 Rate and then press the Tab key. After pressing the Tab key Excel 
places a rectangle around the cells that are a part of the named range. See 
Figure  7-60 . 
 Figure 7-60.    When entering a range name Excel highlights the cells in that range

 Type  *Ho . See Figure  7-61 . 
 Figure 7-61.    Typing Ho brings up the intellisense choices for the function Hour and the named range Hours 
 4. 
 Use the down arrow to select   
 and then press the Tab key. Excel places a 
different color rectangle around the cells that encompass the Hours range. 
 5. 
 Press Ctrl + Enter. 
 6. 
 Use AutoFill to copy the formula down through cell D8. 
 7. 
 Click cell D4. Look in the formula bar. The formula for every cell in the column will 
show  =Rate*Hours . You won’t see any row adjusting as you do when you are using 
cell references in your formulas. 
 Selecting Named Ranges from Use in Formula 
 1. 
 Click inside cell E3. On the Formulas tab in the Defined Names group click the  Use 
in Formula button. Select  FederalTaxRate 
 2.

 9. 
 Press Ctrl + Enter. 
 10. 
 Use the AutoFill Handle to copy the formula down through cell F8. 
 Setting the Scope for a Name  
 The scope of a  name is where that name can be used. The scope can pertain to an entire workbook or 
to an individual worksheet. When you create a named range using the Name Box, the named range has 
a scope of the entire workbook. In other words, you can use that named range on any worksheet in the 
workbook that you declared it in. It doesn’t matter how many worksheets are in the workbook; it will 
work on any of them. 
 Let’s see what happens when we declare a scope of an individual worksheet for a named range or 
named constant.
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ CREATING AND USING FORMULAS

 1. 
 Add another worksheet to the workbook. Change the name on the worksheet tab to 
“TestScope.” 
 2. 
 Select the cell range A1:A5. 
 3. 
 On the Formulas tab on the Ribbon in the Defined Names group click the Define 
Name button. 
 4. 
 Type  SheetScope for the  Name . 
 5. 
 Click the down arrow for Scope and select TestScope. The Refers to text box should 
reflect that you have selected the range A1:A5. See Figure  7-62 . 
 Figure 7-62.  Range A1:A5 is selected 
 6. 
 Click the OK button. 
 7. 
 Press F3. The SheetScope range appears in the list along with the Names you 
created previously. Since the other names were created with a scope of Workbook 
they are accessible from any worksheet. 
 8. 
 Click the Cancel button. 
 9. 
 Click another worksheet. Press F3. SheetScope will not appear in this list because 
its scope is limited to the TestScope worksheet. 
 10. 
 Click the Cancel  button . 
 11. 
 Click the Name Manager button. Click the Filter button. Select  Names Scoped to 
Worksheet . See Figure  7-63 . SheetScope is the only Name displayed because it is 
the only one whose scope is limited to a worksheet.

 12. 
 Click the Filter button again. Select Names Scoped to Workbook. All the Names are 
displayed except for SheetScope. 
 
■ Note If you assign a name with a scope of worksheet you can create a range on another worksheet with 
that same name. 
 13.  Click the Close button. 
 Now you’ve seen how to simplify formulas by using named ranges and constants. Up to this point, 
when you copied a formula down a column or across a row, the formula automatically adjusted for the row 
or column change, but there are times when you don’t want that to happen. You learn how to prevent these 
changes in the next section. 
 Absolute Cell References 
 As you have seen when using relative cell addressing with the AutoFill feature the cell addresses are adjusted 
automatically. As you will see  relative cell referencing doesn’t work for every situation. 
 Binder Corporation is thinking about giving each of its employees a 5% raise. Each employee’s salary is 
listed in column B under the heading Current Salary. The amount of the increase for each employee is to be 
displayed in column C. The formula in column C4 is entered as  =B4*B1 . See Figure  7-64 . The result is 2087.5. 
This is the result of taking 41750 * 5%. 
  Figure 7-63.  Select Names  Scoped to Worksheet 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ CREATING AND USING FORMULAS
255
 Say you use the  AutoFill Handle to copy the formula for the rest of the employees. Figure  7-65 shows the 
resulting copied formulas. 
  Figure 7-64.  The formula for 5% raise is entered in cell C4 
 Figure 7-65.  Formulas after being copied with  AutoFill Handle 
 Looking at our formulas we can see that we are headed for trouble starting with cell C5 and continuing 
down through the other formulas. The row portion of the relative cell address B1 was automatically adjusted 
from 1 to 2. Since there is no value in B2, the value 39950 will be multiplied by 0 giving the result of 0. 
 Figure  7-66  shows the results of the formulas. 
 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ CREATING AND USING FORMULAS
256
 Figure  7-65 shows that the formula in cell C6 is  =B6*B3 . Cell B3 contains the alphabetic data “Current 
Salary.” You can’t use  alphabetic data in a formula, which is why it shows the error # VALUE! . If you click the 
smart tag next to the error Excel displays a tool tip which states that the value used in the formula is of the 
wrong data type. 
 Cell C7 multiplies 52105 * 41750. This is clearly not what we want. We do not want Excel to perform any 
automatic adjusting for cell B1. 
 If you want formulas to refer to a single cell you need to use  absolute cell referencing . Absolute cell 
referencing locks the  cell address in a formula so that when you copy it, it doesn’t automatically adjust 
for the row or column change. Absolute  cell addresses are made by placing a dollar sign in front of both 
the column and the row. This can be done by manually typing them in or you can type the address as you 
normally do then press F4. Pressing F4 places a $ sign in front of both the column and the row. 
 In our example if we entered the formula  =B4*$B$1 in cell C4 then used the  AutoFill handle to copy the 
formula down through cell C1, the formulas would look like those in Figure  7-67 . 
 Figure 7-66.  Results of formula not what we wanted 
 Figure 7-67.  Making cell B1 an absolute  address in the formulas in column C 
 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ CREATING AND USING FORMULAS

 The result would be as shown in Figure  7-68 . This is what we wanted. 
 Figure 7-69.  Enter the data here in a new worksheet named Absolute 
 Figure 7-68.  Result of using absolute cell  referencing  
 
EXERCISE 7-7: ABSOLUTE CELL REFERENCING
 In this example you will create a  travel expense report for the second quarter of 2015. You will add 
computations for computing the mileage expense and the total amount of travel expenses for the 
quarter. You will then compare the quarter totals to the same quarter in 2014 and determine the dollar 
amount and percent difference between the two.
 1. 
 Create a new worksheet named “Absolute.” Make your worksheet look exactly like 
the one in Figure  7-69 . 
 2. 
 Merge and center the title in row 1 across cells A1: J1. Click the Increase Font Size 
button twice. 
 3. 
 Center the column headings both vertically and horizontally. Bold the column 
headings. 
 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ CREATING AND USING FORMULAS
258
 4. 
 Compute the values for the Mileage Expense column by taking the miles traveled 
times the reimbursement rate per mile. The reimbursement rate stored in cell B3 is 
60 cents for every mile traveled.
 a. 
 In cell C6 enter the formula  =B6*B3 . 
 b.  Use the AutoFill handle and drag the formula down through C8. 
 Problem: 
 Cell C8 displays #Value!. Click cell C8. Look at the formula in the formula bar. The formula is  =B8*B5 . 
The formula adjusted for the row when you used the AutoFill handle. Cell B5 contains the text “Miles.” If 
you use text in a formula Excel displays a #Value error. 
 Fix the Problem: 
 Since you want to use cell B3 in each formula you will need to make it absolute. 
 5. 
 Move your cursor in front of B3 in the formula in Cell C6 then press F4 to make the 
cell address absolute. Your formula should now be  =B6*$B$3 . 
 6. 
 Press Ctrl + Enter. The address needs to be absolute because cells C7 and C8 will 
also use the same rate from cell B3 in their formulas. 
 7. 
 Use the  AutoFill handle to copy the formula in cell C6 down through cell C8. 
 8. 
 Select cell G6. Click AutoSum å. The formula is displayed as  =Sum(B6:F6) . Cell B6 
contains the miles traveled which are not an expense. The formula should start with 
column C. 
 9. 
 In the formula change B6 to C6 and then press Ctrl + Enter. 
 10. 
 Use the AutoFill Handle to copy the formula in cell G6 down through cell G8. 
 11. 
 We need to know the dollar difference between the 2nd quarter in 2015 and the 
same quarter in 2014. In cell I6 enter the formula  =G6–H6 and then press Ctrl + 
Enter. 
 12. 
 Use the AutoFill Handle to copy the formula in cell I6 down through cell I8. 
 13. 
 Divide the 2015 totals by the 2014 totals by entering the formula  =(G6/H6)-1 in 
cell J6. Press Ctrl + Enter. 
 14. 
 Use the  AutoFill handle to copy the formula in cell J6 down through cell J8. 
 15. 
 We want to convert the decimal values in cells J6:J8 to a percent. Select cells 
J6:J8, and then select the Home tab and the % button in the Number group. Cells 
J6:J8 are displayed without any decimal positions. 
 16. 
 Change the cells so that they appear with two decimal positions by clicking two 
times on the increase decimal button   
 . Your worksheet should appear as 
shown in Figure  7-70 .

 Mixed Cell References 
 Mixed cell Referencing is a mixture of relative cell referencing and absolute cell referencing. Mixed cell 
referencing is when the row is fixed but the column is relative (the formula will be automatically adjusted to 
the column where the formula is being copied to) or vice versa. 
 Remember, in absolute cell referencing a dollar sign is placed in front of both the column and row to 
lock them both. Mixed cell references look like those in Table  7-4 . 
 Table 7-4.  Mixed Cell References 
 Cell Address 
 Description 
 $A4 
 The column remains the same, but the row can change when the formula is copied to 
another location. 
 A$4 
 The column can change when the formula is copied to another location, but the row 
remains the same. 
 Figure 7-70.  Add two decimal positions to the cells in the range J6:J8 
 The dollar signs can be typed directly into the cell address or you can place your cursor anywhere in the 
cell address or one position to the left or right of it and then press F4. This will create an absolute address 
by placing dollar signs in front of both the column and row such as  $A$4 . Pressing F4 a second time places 
the dollar sign in front of just the row, such as  A$4 . Pressing F4 a third time places the dollar sign in front of 
the column, such as  $A4 . Pressing F4 a fourth time removes the dollar signs thus returning the address to a 
relative address. 
 Mixed cell referencing can best be illustrated by creating a table. 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ CREATING AND USING FORMULAS

EXERCISE 7-8: MIXED CELL REFERENCING
 In this exercise we will create a multiplication  table that looks like Figure  7-71 . The table could 
represent the multiplication tables for numbers 1 through 7 or it could represent square feet, the result 
of multiplying length * width. 
 Figure 7-71.  Multiplication  table 
 1. 
 Create a new worksheet. Name the worksheet “Mixed.” 
 2. 
 Enter a 1 in cell A2. Enter a 2 in cell A3 and then press Ctrl + Enter. 
 3. 
 Drag across cells A2 and A3. Use the AutoFill Handle to copy the pattern down 
through row 8. 
 4. 
 Enter a 1 in cell B1. Enter a 2 in cell C1 and then press Ctrl + Enter  
 5. 
 Drag across cells B1 and C1. Use the AutoFill Handle to copy the pattern across 
through column H. 
 6. 
 Bold the values you entered and give them a background color to distinguish them. 
 7. 
 Enter  =A2*B1 in cell B2. Press Ctrl + Enter. 
 8. 
 Drag the AutoFill Handle down through cell B8. Now drag the AutoFill Handle to the 
right to cell H8. Expand the width of the columns so that you can see all the cell 
data. See Figure  7-72 . 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ CREATING AND USING FORMULAS

 This is definitely not the results we wanted. We wanted the spreadsheet to look like Figure  7-71 . 
 9. 
 Press Ctrl + ~ to see the formulas. Your formulas should look those in Figure  7-73 . 
Looking at the formulas we can see that the columns have changed from the original 
formula to adjust for the current column and the row address has changed to adjust 
for the current row.  
 Figure 7-73.  Formulas used in multiplication  table 
 Figure 7-72.  Results of multiplication using relative cell addressing 
 When creating a mixed cell reference, you need to determine if it is the rows or columns in the formulas 
that should remain constant. In our example we want all of the formulas to use column A. Therefore, we 
want the formula to lock in Column A. We need to make the first address in the formula in cell B2  $A2 . 
Placing a $ in front of just the A will lock in the column but still allow the row in the formula to change to 
the current row. 
 We want all the formulas to use only row 1 but we want the column portion of the formula to change 
to the current column. Therefore we need to lock in row 1 in the second address in cell B2. Thus the 
formula we need to use in cell B2 is  =$A2*B$1. 
 10. 
 Double-click the address  A2 in cell B2. Press F4. The address should now be $ A$2 . 
 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ CREATING AND USING FORMULAS
262
 11. 
 Press F4 again. The address is now  A$2 . Press F4 again. Your address should now 
be  $A2 . 
 12. 
 Double-click the address  B1 in the formula. Press F4 twice. Your address should be 
 B$1. Press Ctrl + Enter. 
 13. 
 Drag the AutoFill Handle down through cell B8. Now drag the AutoFill Handle to the 
right to cell H8. Your formulas should look those in Figure  7-74 . You can see that 
only column A was used in the formulas for the first cell address and only row 1 
was used in the second cell address. 
 Figure 7-75.  Results of multiplication  table 
 Figure 7-74.  Formulas using mixed cell referencing 
 14. 
 Press Ctrl + ~ to return to the results of the formulas. Your data should look like the 
table in Figure  7-75 . 
 You have created formulas using absolute and mixed cell references. Knowing how and when to use 
these are very important if you want to become a skilled Excel user. Improper use of cell references is one of 
the mistakes new Excel students make most often. You should always review your formulas and their results 
before relying on those results. 
 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ CREATING AND USING FORMULAS

 Order of Precedence 
 The  order of precedence is a set of predefined rules that determines the order in which operations in a 
formula will be performed. Looking at the formula below it is difficult to know which operation to perform 
first. 
 = 3+2*18 /-3^2 – 2 
 Excel follows the normal Mathematical  order of precedence also known as the  order of operations . 
If an expression contains operators with the same precedence, they are evaluated from left to right. Placing 
portions of the expression within parentheses allows you to control the order in which the operators are 
evaluated. Excel performs mathematical operations in the order shown in Table  7-5 . 
 Table 7-5.  Order of Precedence

 Now that you know the order in which operations take place, you can use this knowledge to determine 
the outcome of this formula. 
 =3+2*18/-3^2–2 
 Negative numbers are evaluated first then Exponents. The expression is now equivalent to the 
following: 
 =3+2*18/ 9 –2 
 Multiplication and division have the same level. Since the multiplication is to the left of the division, it is 
done first. The expression is now equivalent to the following: 
 =3+ 36 /9–2 
 The division is performed next: 
 =3+ 4 –2 
 Addition and Subtraction have the same precedence. Since the addition is to the left of the subtraction, 
it is done first. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ CREATING AND USING FORMULAS
264
 = 7 –2 
 The subtraction is done next giving a result of  5 . 
 The normal operator precedence can be overridden by putting parentheses around the operations 
you want performed first. If you have parentheses within parentheses, the operation in the innermost 
parentheses is performed first. 
 The formula could have been made clearer by the use of parentheses as in the formula that follows: 
 =3+((2*18)/(-3^2))–2 
 Summary 
 All formulas in Excel must start with an = sign. 
 Formulas can be entered in one of three ways:
• 
 Typing directly into a cell 
• 
 Clicking the cells you want to reference in the formula separated by mathematical 
symbols 
• 
 Using your arrow keys to select the cells you want to reference separated by 
mathematical symbols 
 Excel follows the normal mathematical order of precedence. Be sure to use parentheses to make sure 
your mathematical operations are performed in the order you want them to be. 
 Excel has an Auto button that has the aggregate functions Sum, Average, Count, Min, and Max. You 
don’t need to enter the function to use one of these often used functions. Just select the cells above or to the 
left of where you want to place the result and then select the function you want to use by clicking the down 
arrow to the right of the AutoSum button. 
 You can assign a name to a range of cells. This can make your formulas easier to read and understand. 
 There are three places where you can name a range:
• 
 Name Box 
• 
 Define Names dialog box 
• 
 Name Manager 
 Press Ctrl + ~ to display all of the functions on your worksheet. You can print your worksheet with the 
formulas displayed. Press Ctrl + ~ again to display the results of your functions rather than the functions 
themselves. 
 You can copy your formulas using the Autofill Handle. Any addresses used in your formulas will 
automatically adjust in the copied cells. Addresses that adjust are called relative addresses. You can lock 
an address in a formula so that it will not adjust when being copied. A locked address is called an absolute 
address. The dollar sign is used to lock a row or a column. Press F4 to place a dollar sign in front of the row 
and column. If you lock only a row or only a column in an address it is called a mixed cell address. 
 You can select your named ranges and constants from a list by pressing F3. 
 You can place the names you assigned to ranges along with the range addresses in your worksheet by 
clicking the down arrow to the right of  Use in Formula and then selecting Paste Names. This creates good 
documentation for your worksheet.

 CHAPTER 8  
 Excel’s Pre-existing Functions 
 This chapter covers some of the most used functions that allow you to do such things as sum values only if 
they meet certain conditions, something based on whether a condition is true or not, determine the number 
of days between dates, get the current date and time, and so on. You will learn how to enter functions 
manually or by using the Function wizard. 
 After reading and working through this chapter you should be able to
• 
 Create a nested function 
• 
 Use the Function wizard 
• 
 Find the number of days between two days 
• 
 Sum a range of values based on no conditions, one condition, or multiple conditions 
• 
 Get the month, day, or year from a date 
• 
 Display different values based on whether a condition is true or false 
• 
 Get the integer portion of a decimal value 
• 
 Get the current date and time and use them in formulas 
 Excel’s Built-in Functions 
 Excel has lots of predefined built-in formulas which are called  functions . Each function has a unique name. 
The functions are grouped into categories. The function  categories   are located on the Formula tab’s Function 
Library group. Additional categories are available by clicking the More Functions button. See Figure  8-1 . 

CHAPTER 8 ■ EXCEL’S PRE-EXISTING FUNCTIONS
266
 Table  8-1 describes the main built-in functions. 
 Figure 8-1.  Excel functions are  categorized 
 Table 8-1.  Function  Categories and Their Descriptions 
 Function Category 
 Function Description 
 AutoSum 
 The AutoSum drop-down arrow displays the “Auto” functions. These are the exact 
same functions we looked at previously, and they are available on the Home tab 
in the editing group. These functions can return the sum, average, count, highest 
value, and lowest value for a range of cells. 
 Compatibility 
 These are functions that have been kept for compatibility with previous versions of 
Excel. These functions have all been replaced with newer functions, so unless you 
need backward compatibility you should not use them. 
 Cube 
 These functions return values from analysis of multidimensional data sets used in 
databases. 
 Date & Time 
 Functions for dealing with days, dates, and times 
 Engineering 
 Functions for engineering calculations 
 Financial 
 Functions dealing with loans, investments, interest, depreciation, future 
values, etc. 
 Information 
 Functions that help you determine the type of data that exists in a cell 
 Logical 
 Logical functions are used primarily in comparisons in which the result would be 
True or False. 
 Lookup & Reference 
 Excel's Lookup & Reference functions can be used to simplify finding values in a 
list or data table or finding the reference of a cell. 
 Math & Trig 
 Functions used for performing simple and complex mathematical calculations 
 Statistical 
 Functions that perform statistical analysis on ranges of data 
 Text 
 Functions that manipulate text strings 
 Web 
 Gets data from a web service. 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ EXCEL’S PRE-EXISTING FUNCTIONS
267
 The Recently Used button is not really a category. It displays the last ten functions that you have used. 
This creates a quick way to jump to some of the functions you probably use most often.  
 Function Construction 
 Each category consists of separate functions that relate to their category. Figure  8-2 shows some of the 
 Logical functions . 
 Figure 8-2.  Logical functions 
 Moving your cursor over a function provides a tool tip. The tool tip provides a description of the 
function and its syntax. Each function has its own particular  syntax.  Syntax is the rules for how a function 
can appear in a cell. Functions usually contain  arguments .  Arguments are the values that are passed to the 
function to work on. There are three arguments for the  IF function ( logical_test ,  value_if_true , and 
 value_if_false) . Arguments are always separated by commas. You would enter values or cell addresses for 
the arguments. Clicking  Tell me more will provide more help. 
 An example of an  IF function is  =IF(C3>25000,C3*6%,C3*5%) . The   IF function will be fully explained 
later in this chapter. Now that we have looked at how a function is created we will look at the functions that 
you are likely to use the most often. 
 Functions That Sum Values 
 There are three functions for summing cell values. Table 8.2 describes them.

 Figure 8-3.  As you type the letters of a function, Excel helps find a function that starts with those letters 
 Table 8-2.  Descriptions for Summing Functions 
 Function 
 Description 
 SUM 
 Sums a series of values without testing for any conditions. 
 SUMIF 
 Used to sum values provided that they meet a condition that you specify. 
 SUMIFS 
 Used to sum values only if multiple conditions are met. 
 SUM Function 
 We will look how a  SUM  function is constructed. The  SUM function is one of the Math & Trig functions. The  SUM 
function, used for adding a group of values, is the most used function. The  SUM  function should be familiar to 
you, because when you use AutoSum you are running the  SUM function. 
 The  Syntax for the  Sum function is: 
 =SUM(number1, [number2], [number3]. . .) 
 Function names are written in all capital letters; however, they are not case sensitive. You could enter 
the function name in small letters. If you enter a function in small letters Excel will change it to all caps. 
 Function names are followed by a set of parenthesis. If the function requires arguments, they are placed 
within the parenthesis. The  SUM function has the  arguments    number1 ,  number2 and  number3 . The arguments 
 number2 and  number3 are placed within square brackets. Arguments placed within square brackets are 
optional. The three dots (ellipsis) after the last argument mean that this is not the end of the list. You could 
actually place any number of arguments within the parenthesis of the  SUM function. 
 Excel is very helpful when entering a function. As we saw in Chapter   7 , entering a function in a cell 
starts by entering an  = sign followed by the name of the function. As you type the letters of the function, Excel 
narrows down the function choices based on the letters you have entered so far. See Figure  8-3 . 
 Clicking a function name brings up a description of what that function does. 
 After you have entered enough characters to narrow down the function to the one you want, press the 
Tab key. Excel will place a left parenthesis after the function name and it will bring up a tool tip to help you 
with entering the function. The first argument is highlighted in the tool tip. See Figure  8-4 . 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ EXCEL’S PRE-EXISTING FUNCTIONS
269
 After entering the first argument and a comma ( 23, in this example), the second argument becomes 
highlighted in the tool tip and a third argument option is displayed. See Figure  8-5 . 
 Figure 8-5.  Second  argument is highlighted 
 Figure 8-6.  Additional argument is added to tool tip 
 Figure 8-4.  First  argument is highlighted 
 Every time you enter another argument, an additional argument appears in the tool tip. See Figure  8-6 . 
 If you need to change one of the arguments you entered, click the argument in the tool tip. This will 
select the argument in the function and then you can make your changes. See Figure  8-7 . 
 Figure 8-7.  Click an argument in the tool tip, to select that argument in the function 
 You do not need to enter a comma after the last argument. It also is not necessary to enter the closing 
parenthesis. When you accept the entry Excel will automatically enter the closing parenthesis for you. The 
result returned by the function will display in the cell where you entered the function. The complete function 
will display in the function box. See Figure  8-8 . 
 Figure 8-8.  Result of function appears in the cell. The formula for that cell displays in the Formula bar 
 
 
 
 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ EXCEL’S PRE-EXISTING FUNCTIONS
270
 Single values entered in a formula are called  constants  . A  constant is a value that does not change. 
 The entry for an argument doesn’t have to be individual values like those we have entered in the  SUM 
function. The  SUM function can also use range names, individual cell references, and cell ranges for its 
arguments. What can be entered for each argument depends upon the function used. Table  8-3 shows 
several examples of the  SUM function with different arguments. 
 Table 8-3.  The  SUM Function with Different Arguments 
 Function 
 Description 
 =SUM(3,5,8) 
 Adds the individual values 3, 5 and 8 giving a result of 16 
 =SUM(Sales) 
 Adds the values in the range named Sales 
 =SUM(B3:B9) 
 Adds the values in the range B3 to B9 
 Figure 8-9.  Using the  SUM function to sum a range on a different worksheet 
 If you wanted to sum the cells in the range C5 to C10 on a different worksheet named “Purchases,” you 
would enter the formula as shown in Figure  8-9 . 
 You could type  Purchases! or you could click the worksheet named Purchases and Excel would enter 
the name along with the exclamation point in the formula for you. 
 If you only wanted to add the values in column C, then you could use the shortcut method C:C. The 
formula could be written as  = SUM ( Purchases ! C:C ) 
 Using the  Insert Function Option 
 As we discussed in Chapter   7 , clicking the  Insert Function  button in the Function Library group brings up 
the Insert Function dialog box See Figure  8-10 . 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ EXCEL’S PRE-EXISTING FUNCTIONS
271
 Clicking the down arrow for the  Or select a category list box brings up the same categories that are 
available in the Function Library group. The only additional category here is the All category. If you don’t 
know the category for the function you want to use, clicking the All category will bring up every function 
from every category in alphabetical order. The syntax and description for each function appears as you click 
the different functions, 
 A primary reason for using the Insert Function option is for its search capability. You can type a 
description of what you want a function to do into the search text box and then click the Go button. Excel 
will provide a list of functions that may meet your needs. In Figure  8-11 , “find the largest number” was 
entered for the search. Excel returned with a list of functions that would meet that criterion. It would be up 
to you then to decide which one in the list best meets your needs.

 The Function Arguments dialog box opens. Move the dialog box if it is covering 
the numbers in your worksheet. An entry box appears for each required argument. 
Click inside the Number1 box. Required arguments are bolded. Number1 is the only 
required argument for the  Sum function. See Figure  8-14 . 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ EXCEL’S PRE-EXISTING FUNCTIONS
274
 Argument Number1 contains the range B3:B7 because it is attempting to add the values above it. The 
values being summed are displayed to the right of the Number1 box. It includes the 0 for cell B7. This 
doesn’t affect the current total, which as you can see is 1950. 
 5. 
 Drag across cells A3:A6. The values from this range are displayed as well as the 
current sum. See Figure  8-15 .

CHAPTER 8 ■ EXCEL’S PRE-EXISTING FUNCTIONS
276
 You have learned how to add all of the values in a single range or in multiple ranges at the same time. 
What if you only want to add only some of the values in a range such as expenses, but only if they are 
entertainment expenses? You’ll see how to do this in the next section. 
 SUMIF—Adds the Cells That Meet a Specified Criteria 
 The  SUMIF function is used for summing a range of values provided that they meet a condition that you 
specify in the criteria argument. The  SUMIF function only works if you are basing your summing on a single 
criterion. If you need to base it on more than one criterion you will need to use the  SUMIFS  function, which is 
covered in the next section. 
 The  syntax for the  SUMIF function is: 
 SUMIF(range, criteria, [sum_range]) 
 Argument descriptions are
 range is the cells that you are basing your criterion on. The range contains the 
values that will be checked by the criteria to determine if they are to be included 
in the sum.  
 criteria is the condition that must be met if a value is to be included in the sum. 
If the condition contains any text, logical or mathematical symbols it must be 
enclosed in double quotation marks. Quotation marks are not necessary if the 
criterion is just a number. 
 [sum_range] is optional. If this optional range is used then it will be this range 
that contains the cells to be summed rather than the range in the first argument. 
The criteria will still be based on the first range argument. 
 Using SUMIF with the  Required Arguments 
 Figure  8-18 contains a range of values that need to be summed, but we only want to sum those items whose 
value is greater than 900. There are only two values greater than 900 in the range B1:B6: 1100 and 1500. 
 Figure 8-18.    The values that are greater than 900 will be summed 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ EXCEL’S PRE-EXISTING FUNCTIONS
277
 The arguments used in the formula for summing the values greater than 900 are
 B1:B6 is the range of values that the criteria will be based on. 
 ">900" is the criteria. Since the criterion contains something other than just a 
number it must be enclosed in double quotes. 
 The complete formula is  =SUMIF(B1:B6,">900") . 
 We will place this formula in cell B7. The result of adding 1100 + 1500 is 2600. See Figure  8-19 . 
 Figure 8-19.    Result of  SUMIF function            
 Figure 8-20.  Sum of the four .99 prices 
 Figure  8-20  shows a list of items and their prices. We only want to sum those items whose price is 
exactly 99 cents. The formula entered into cell B10 is  =SUMIF(B2:B8,0.99) . Since we are only summing those 
values which are exactly .99, there is no need for any additional logical symbols because the equal sign is 
optional. Because the criterion is only a number, it does not need to be placed within double quotes. 
 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ EXCEL’S PRE-EXISTING FUNCTIONS
278
 Using the Optional sum_range Argument 
 When using the  optional  sum_range argument you base your criteria on a different range of cells than those 
that you are summing. 
 We want to find the total number of males and females in a high school. Figure  8-21 shows the 
worksheet for this. The worksheet uses separate formulas for determining the number of males and females. 
The arguments used in the formula for determining the number of males are: 
 B2:B9 is the  range that the criteria will be based on. 
 "“M" is the  criterion 
 C2:C9 is the  sum_range. The range of the cells that will be summed, if the 
criterion is met. 
 Figure 8-21.    Result of SUMIF functions       
 The formula entered in cell C11 is 
 =SUMIF(B2:B9,"M",C2:C9) 
 The only difference in the formula for computing females is the criterion which is  "F" . 
 The formula entered in cell C12 is 
 =SUMIF(B2:B9,"F",C2:C9) 
 SUMIFS—Adds the Cells That Meet Multiple Criteria 
 The  SUMIFS function is similar to the  SUMIF function except that the  SUMIFS  function is used to sum values 
only if multiple conditions are met rather than a single condition. 
 The  syntax for the  SUMIFS function is: 
 SUMIFS(sum_range, criteria_range1, criteria1, [criteria_range2, criteria2], . . .) 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ EXCEL’S PRE-EXISTING FUNCTIONS
279
 Argument descriptions are
 sum_range is the cells that you are basing your criteria on. The range contains the 
values that will be checked by the criteria to determine if they are to be included 
in the sum. 
 criteria_range1 is the first range in which to evaluate the associated criteria.     
 criteria1 is the condition that defines which cells in the  criteria_range1 
argument will be added. 
 Criteria_range2, Criteria2,. . . You can add as many as 126 additional 
ranges and their associated criteria. 
 Figure  8-22  shows a company’s bank deposits along with the date of each deposit for its different 
branches. We want to sum the bank  deposits in column B but only if the following conditions are met: 
• 
 It is not a Hobart office. 
• 
  The amount of the deposit has to be at least 20,000. 
• 
  The date of the deposit has to be 03/12/2010 or later. 
 Figure 8-22.  Result of  SUMIFS function 
 The formula that will add the deposits that meet our criteria is: 
 =SUMIFS(B2:B11,A2:A11,"<>Hobart",B2:B11,">=20000",C2:C11,">=03/01/2010") 
 The arguments used in the formula for summing the bank  deposits are as follows:
 B2:B11 is the  sum_range . This range contains the values we want to sum if they 
meet our criteria 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ EXCEL’S PRE-EXISTING FUNCTIONS
280
 We only want the branches that are not Hobart.
• 
 A2:A11 is the  criteria_range1 . 
• 
 "<>Hobart" is  criteria1 . 
 The amount of the deposit has to be at least 20,000.
• 
 B2:B11 is the  criteria_range2 . 
• 
 ">=20000" is  criteria2 . 
 The date of the deposit has be 3/12/2010 or later.
• 
 C2:C11 is the  criteria_range3 . 
• 
 ">=03/12/2010" is  criteria3 . 
 Figure  8-23 highlights the rows that meet all the criteria. They are the only deposits that meet all three 
criteria of (1) not being a Hobart branch, (2) having a deposit greater than or equal to 20000, and (3) having 
been deposited on or after 3/12/2010. The result of adding the deposit for these three rows is 83562. 79  
 Figure 8-23.    Rows that meet the SUMIFS criteria are highlighted       
 Using a Cell Address Rather Than a Cell Value for a Criteria 
 If you are checking if an item is equal to a value in the criteria range you can specify a  cell address   that 
contains the value of that item for the criteria. In Figure  8-24 we want to sum the attendees if they took an 
Excel class in Fort Wayne. Cells E2 and F2 can be used for the criteria because they contain the values to be 
checked against the criteria range.

 Handling Empty Cells in  SUMIFS Functions 
 The worksheet in Figure  8-26 totals the values for items that have been completed but haven’t yet shipped. 
The two criteria that will be used for the  SUMIFS arguments will be those items whose  Date Completed is not 
blank and whose  Date Shipped is blank. The figure highlights those items that meet both criteria.  
 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ EXCEL’S PRE-EXISTING FUNCTIONS
282
 The criteria are as follows:
 The criteria for the Date Completed cells is  "<>" 
 The criteria for the Date Shipped is  "" (two quotes together test for a blank) 
 The formula entered in cell E11 is  =SUMIFS(E2:E10,C2:C10,"<>",D2:D10,"") . 
 
■ Note   When testing a criteria range for blanks the cells must be real blanks and not the result of a formula 
that had no result. 
 IF—Returns Different Values Depending upon If a Condition 
Is True or False 
 The  IF function returns different values depending upon whether a condition is true or false. 
 The  syntax for the  IF function is: 
 IF(logical_test , [value_if_true], [value_if_false]) 
 Argument descriptions are
 logical_test is the condition being tested. 
 [value_if_true] if the condition being tested is true, then perform this step.  
 [value_if_false] if the condition being tested is false, then perform this step. 
 If the condition being tested is true, what is in the  value_if_true argument will be used; otherwise 
what is in the  value_if_false argument will be used. 
 Let’s say that the value in cell A2 is 20. If you place the following formula in cell A1 
 =IF(A2=20,"Equal 20","Not equal 20") 
 Figure 8-26.    Rows are highlighted where the items have been completed but not shipped       
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ EXCEL’S PRE-EXISTING FUNCTIONS
283
 then cell A1 will display  Equal 20 . If you change the value in cell A2 to 19, then the value in cell A1 will 
change to  Not equal 20 . 
 
EXERCISE 8-2: USING THE IF FUNCTION
 We need to determine the Gross Pay for each of our employees. If an employee works over 40 hours he 
will receive overtime pay at 1.5 times the normal rate. The Gross Pay will be computed by adding an 
employee’s regular pay and overtime pay. 
 An  IF function will be used to compute the employee’s regular pay; another  IF function will be used to 
compute his or her overtime pay. 
 If an employee works 40 hours or less, his regular pay and his gross pay would be the hours he worked 
times his pay rate. 
 If an employee works 40 hours or more, then his regular pay will be 40 hours times the pay rate. The 
hours the employee worked in addition to the 40 hours will be used for determining overtime pay. If we 
assign names to our ranges, the formula needed to compute regular pay is  =IF(hours>40, 40*rate, 
hours*rate) . 
 We take  40 * rate if the condition (hours >40) is true and  hours * rate if the condition is false. 
 To compute the OT (overtime pay) we will again need to test if the hours worked is greater than 40. 
If the hours are greater than 40 we will need to take the number of hours worked minus 40 to get the 
overtime hours. The overtime hours will be multiplied by the pay rate times 1.5. If the hours worked are 
40 or less, then the overtime will be 0. 
 Figure  8-27 shows the formula to compute the overtime pay.

 You have used the  IF statement to test a condition; the function does one thing if the condition is true 
and something else if the condition is false. Next, you will look at the  AND  function and later the  OR function. 
These functions don’t do much on their own. They only return either a TRUE or FALSE. Their strength is 
shown when they are combined with other functions. The exercise following the  OR  function demonstrates 
how to combine these functions within an  IF function. 
 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ EXCEL’S PRE-EXISTING FUNCTIONS
286
 AND - Returns TRUE if All of Its Arguments Are TRUE 
 The  AND function returns either a TRUE or a FALSE. It returns a TRUE if  all of its arguments are true and it 
returns a FALSE if any of its arguments are not true. 
 The  syntax for the  AND function is: 
 AND(logical1, [logical2], . . .) 
 The  AND  function can be used to evaluate up to 255 logical conditions. 
 Figure  8-33 shows the  AND function with three  logical conditions . All three of these conditions are true 
therefore the function returns a TRUE. 
 Figure 8-34.  The third condition is false, which returns a false 
 Figure 8-33.  AND function that tests three  conditions 
 The last condition in Figure  8-34 is false. The value in cell D1 is not equal to the value in cell F1. The  AND 
function therefore returns a FALSE because even if only one of the  logical conditions   is false it will return a 
 FALSE . 
 OR—Returns TRUE If Any Argument Is TRUE 
 The  OR function returns a TRUE if any of its arguments are true and it returns a FALSE if  all of its arguments 
are false. 
 The  syntax for the  OR function is: 
 OR(logical1,[logical2],. . .) 
 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ EXCEL’S PRE-EXISTING FUNCTIONS
287
 The first logical  condition in Figure  8-36 is true. The value in cell D1 is less than the value in cell E1. The 
other conditions are false. The  OR function returns a  TRUE   because even if only one logical condition is true 
the function returns a TRUE. 
 Figure 8-35.    All conditions are false so the OR condition returns a FALSE       
 Figure 8-36.  Only the first condition is true; therefore, the  OR function returns a TRUE 
 Nested Functions  
 Sometimes a single function will not give you the results you need. In these cases you will need to create a 
nested function. Nested functions combine the operations of two or more functions into a single function. 
A nested function is used as an argument in the other function. Excel allows a maximum of 64  functions 
nested  within each other. That should be more than you will ever need. 
 Figure  8-35 shows the  OR function with three  logical conditions . All three of these conditions are false. If 
and only if  all of the arguments are false will the  OR function return a FALSE.

 If you wanted to see or make a change to your formula you could click the word  IF 
and then click the Insert Function button (Formula tab | Function Library). 
 You can see that the  AND condition is false; therefore our result is a blank. See Figure  8-41 .

 If you just wanted to see or make a change to the  AND function you could click the 
word  AND and then click the Ribbon’s Formula tab. In the Functions Library group 
click the Insert Function button. See Figure  8-42 . You can see that the Age is not 
less than 21 for the first cell in the range.

 14. 
 Click the Cancel button. 
 15. 
 Press Ctrl + Enter to accept the formula. Cell D2 is blank. 
 16. 
 Use the Autofill Handle to copy the formula from D2 to D11. 
 Nesting  an OR Function Within an IF Function  
 Let’s create another  IF function, but this time let’s nest an  OR function within it that will test if the 
student is a female or if the student is 21 or more. If a student meets either one of these conditions, he 
or she will be placed in Section B.
 1. 
 In cell E2 enter the formula  =IF(OR( . 
 2. 
 Press F3 to bring up the range names. Select Sex and then click the OK button. 
 3. 
 Type  Sex = "F", . 
 4. 
 Press F3 to bring up the range names. Select Age and then click the OK button. 
 5. 
 Type  Age >= 21), . The function is now  =IF(OR(Sex="F",Age>=21), . 
 The  OR function is finished and now you are back to the  IF function and ready to enter the data for the 
argument  [value_if_true] 
 6. 
 Enter  "B","") . 
 The full formula is = IF(OR(Sex="F",Age>=21),"B","") . 
 7. 
 As with the nested  AND function, clicking the word  IF in the formula and then 
clicking the Insert Function or clicking the word  OR in the formula will display that 
portion of the formula in the Function Arguments window. 
 8. 
 Use the Autofill Handle to copy the formula from E2 to E11. Select the cell range 
B2:E11. Center the data of the selected range. Figure  8-43 shows the results.

 Let’s make a change to the application by placing a check mark in column D if the student meets the 
conditions of being a Male, a History major, and under 21. The check mark is part of the Wingding font 
Set. A check mark is created when you hold your Alt key and then on the numeric keypad type 0252 (it 
only works if you use the numeric keypad). The Wingding font must then be selected for the cell. 
 9. 
 Delete column E. 
 10. 
 Change the text in cell D1 to Section A. 
 11. 
 Click cell D2. In the Formula bar select  A in the true part of the  IF formula. 
 12. 
 Hold down the Alt key and type 0252 on the numeric keypad. The formula should 
be  =IF(AND(Subject="Math",Sex="M",Age<21),"ü","") 
 13. 
 Select the Autofill handle on cell D2 and drag it down through cell D11. 
 14. 
 With the range D2:D11 selected, change the Font typeface to Wingdings. 
Figure  8-44 shows the result. 
 Figure 8-44.  Use Wingdings to create check marks 
 You created nested  AND and  OR functions. You can nest about any function within another. This gives 
your functions a lot more flexibility. Next, you will look at functions that deal with dates. You’ll see how you 
can get the current date and time, find the number of days between two dates, and manipulate dates by 
adding or deleting from them. 
 Date Functions  
 Excel allows you to use dates and times in formulas. Excel can do this because it actually stores dates and 
times as numbers. Excel stores dates as serial numbers. A serial number treats January 1, 1900 as the first day 
of the calendar. It is considered as day 1. January 2, 1900 is considered day 2, January 3, 1900 is considered 
day 3, etc. Because Excel treats January 1, 1900 as the first day you can’t use any dates earlier than this. If you 
do, Excel will treat the date as text. 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ EXCEL’S PRE-EXISTING FUNCTIONS
293
 You can see how Excel treats dates and times by formatting them as General. 
 In the example in Figure  8-45 , 1/1/1900 was entered in both cells A1 and B1. The date 3/2/1010 was 
entered in both cells A2 and B2. Cells B1 and B2 were formatted as General. 
 Figure 8-46.  The date displayed as a serial date 
 Figure 8-45.    Column B shows what the date in column A looks like when formatted as General 
 Table 8-4.    Description and Results for Various TODAY Function Formulas

 10/21/2015 
 =TODAY() – 5 
 Returns the date five days ago 
 10/06/2015 
 Cell B2 displays 40239, which is the number of days between 1/1/1900 and 3/2/2010. 
 Excel stores times as a value between 0 and 1. The time 12:00 AM would be stored as a value of 0. The 
time 11:59:59 PM would be stored as a value of .9999. 
 TODAY Function—Returns the Current Date 
 The  TODAY() function returns the current date, which it gets from your computer’s internal clock. The 
 TODAY() function doesn’t use any arguments. Even though the  TODAY function doesn’t use any arguments 
you must still enter parentheses after the function name so that Excel recognizes it as a function. 
 The syntax for the  TODAY function is: 
 =TODAY() 
 See Table  8-4 for some examples. 
 The  TODAY() function is recalculated every time you open the worksheet or refresh it. In other words, if you 
enter the formula  =TODAY()  in a worksheet on May 01, 2016 and then reopen that same worksheet on June 30, 
2016 the date will be updated to 06/30/2016. You can prevent this dynamic updating by making the date static. 
 To make the date returned from the  TODAY() function static
 
 1. 
 Double-Click the cell that contains the  Today()  function. This places the cell in 
edit mode. 
 
 2. 
 Press the refresh key (F9). This changes the date to a serial date. See Figure  8-46 . 
 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ EXCEL’S PRE-EXISTING FUNCTIONS
294
 
 3. 
 Press Enter to commit the entry. The serial number then reverts back to a date 
format. The date will then always show as the date you made the entry. 
 
EXERCISE 8-3: USING TODAY FUNCTION WITH INT FUNCTION
 In this exercise you will you use the  TODAY  function and a person’s birthdate to determine his or her age.
 1. 
 Enter the data in Figure  8-47 in a new worksheet. Name the worksheet “Age.” 
We want to determine the age for those whose birthdate appears in column B. 
Add your name and birthdate to the list. 
 Figure 8-47.  Enter this data in a worksheet named Age 
 2. 
 Click inside cell C2. The formula for determining the age is today’s date minus the 
birthdate divided by 365.25. We divide by 365.25 to accommodate leap year which 
happens every four years. 
 3. 
 Type  =(TODAY()-B2)/365.25 . 
 We place a pair of parentheses around  TODAY()-B2 because we need to perform this 
calculation before doing the division. If we didn’t place it in parentheses Excel would first divide 
B2 by 365.25. 
 4. 
 Press Enter. The result is a decimal amount. We usually display someone’s age as 
an integer. 
 We will use the  INT function to remove the decimal portion of the age. The  INT function rounds a value 
down to its nearest whole number 
 5. 
 Double-Click cell C2. 
 6. 
 Place the cursor after the equal sign in the Formula bar. Type  INT( . 
 7. 
 Press the End key on the keyboard to place the cursor at the end of the function. 
 8. 
 Type the closing right parenthesis. Your formula should now be 
 =INT((TODAY()-B2)/365.25) 
 9. 
 Press Ctrl + Enter. 
 10. 
 Drag the AutoFill Handle down through cell C5. If this was run in February 2016 the 
results would be as shown in Figure  8-48 . 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ EXCEL’S PRE-EXISTING FUNCTIONS
295
 NOW Function—Returns the Current Date and Time 
 The  NOW function is similar to the  TODAY function except that the  NOW  function includes the time along with 
the current date. Another difference is that the  NOW function is not dynamic. It does not update to the current 
date when you reopen the worksheet. 
 The syntax for the  NOW function is 
 =NOW() 
 Table  8-5 shows an example of the  NOW function applied on October 20, 2015 at 3:18 PM. 
 Figure 8-48.  Result of using TODAY function with INT function 
 Table 8-5.  NOW Applied 
 Formula 
 Displays current date and time 
 =NOW() 
 10/20/2015 15:18 
 Notice that the  NOW function displays time in a 24-hour format. You can change the Time format so that 
it will display in a 12-hour format using AM or PM. Changing the time to a 12-hour format requires a custom 
format. This date and time  
 is the result of entering  =NOW() in a cell. To change to a 12 
hour format that displays AM or PM you would right-click the cell and select Format. This would bring up 
the Format Cells dialog box. See Figure  8-49 . Make sure that Custom is selected for the Category and m/d/
yyyy h:mm is selected for the Type 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ EXCEL’S PRE-EXISTING FUNCTIONS
296
 You would then add AM/PM to the end of the type. See Figure  8-50 . The result is shown in the Sample 
area. You would then click the OK button and the cell would display the same value as what appears in the 
Sample area.  
 Figure 8-49.    Select the Custom category and the date and time type          
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ EXCEL’S PRE-EXISTING FUNCTIONS
297
 If you just wanted to display the time without the date you could use the following formula: 
 =NOW() – TODAY() 
 DATE Function—Returns the Serial Number of the DATE 
 The  DATE function returns the serial number of the  date provided in the  DATE arguments. 
 The syntax for the  DATE function is: 
 =DATE(year, month, day) 
 Figure 8-50.    Adding AM?PM changes the time from a 24-hour format to a 12-hour format that shows 
AM or PM 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ EXCEL’S PRE-EXISTING FUNCTIONS
298
 All of the arguments in the  DATE function are required. 
 When you create a new workbook all of the cells are formatted as General by default. If you enter the 
formula  =DATE(2015, 10, 20) Excel will automatically change the formatting of the cell to the date type 
and display 10/20/2015. The date is actually stored as a serial number so that it can be used in formulas. If 
you format the cell as something other than a date or time, Excel will display the date as a serial number. 
Remember, the serial number is the number of days that have passed since January 1, 1900. 
 
■ Note   You should always enter a four-digit year when using the  DATE function. If you enter a one- or 
two-digit year Excel will treat these as from the 1900s. For example, if you enter  =DATE(09,05,14) or 
 =DATE(9,05,14) Excel will assume the year is 1909 not 2009. 
 The  DATE function is most useful in situations in which you are getting the year, month, and day from 
other cells or when you want to use the date as part of a formula. You can’t enter a date directly in a formula. 
If you enter a formula as  =09/07/2015–09/05/2015 Excel treats the forward slashes as divide signs. If you 
want to use a date in a formula you should use the  DATE function. If you wanted to know the number of days 
between two dates you could enter a formula such as  =DATE(2015,4,25) - DATE(2015,2,20) or let’s say that 
you have the formula  =DATE(2015, 4, 25) in cell A2 and the formula  =DATE(2015,2,20) in cell B2. Entering 
the formula  =A2-B2 will return a result of 64. The result is the number of days between the two  dates . 
 
■ Note   Excel returns a number rather than a date when you enter the  DATE function as a part of a formula 
such as  =Date(2015,5,13) – Date(2015,2,15) because it formats it as the General type. If you just enter 
 =Date(2011,5,13) in a cell Excel will display it as a date because Excel formats it as a Date type. 
 MONTH, DAY, and YEAR  Functions 
 You can retrieve just the month, day, or year portion from a date by using the  MONTH ,  DAY , and  YEAR functions. 
 The syntax for the  MONTH ,  DAY and  YEAR functions are: 
 =MONTH(Serial Date) 
 =DAY(Serial Date) 
 =YEAR(Serial Date) 
 Retrieving the month, day, or year from a date is done by using the corresponding function along with a 
cell address of a date or a date itself for the argument. 
 Table  8-6 shows the results of using the  DAY ,  YEAR , and  MONTH functions.

 2015 
 Figure 8-51.    Data used for this example       
 
■ Note   You can’t use a date directly in the formula such as  =MONTH(03/15/2010) because the month hasn’t 
been stored as a serial date and the  MONTH ,  DAY , and  YEAR  functions can only use dates stored as serial dates. 
 Values can be added or subtracted from the  MONTH ,  DAY , and  YEAR  functions. Let’s say that our business 
tries to fill its orders within three months of the order date. We can do this by adding 3 to the month in the 
order date. The day and year for the required date will be the same as those from the order date. We will use 
the data in Figure  8-51 . 
 The function that follows will be entered in cell C2 and then copied down through cell C5. 
 =DATE(YEAR(B2),MONTH(B2)+3,DAY(B2)) 
 Figure  8-52  shows the result. The month in cell B4 is 10. Adding 3 to 10 should give us a month of 13, but 
Excel is smart enough to know there isn’t any month 13 and automatically adjusts the date so that the month 
becomes January. Adding 3 to the month in cell B5 automatically adjusted the month to February.  
 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ EXCEL’S PRE-EXISTING FUNCTIONS
300
 Excel will also automatically adjust the date if there ends up being more days than there are in a month.     
 DAYS—Returns the Number of Days Between Two Dates 
 The  DAYS function is used to find the number of days between two dates. 
 The syntax for the  DAYS function is 
 DAYS(end_date,start_date) 
 Argument descriptions are
 end_date and  start_date are the two dates between which you want to know 
the number of days. 
 If the date 1/5/1994 was in cell A1 and you wanted to know how many days were between that date and 
today’s date, you would use today’s date as the end date and 1/5/1994 as the start date. You would enter the 
following formula in a cell. 
 =DAYS(TODAY(),A1) 
 
EXERCISE 8-4: USE THE DAYS FUNCTION
 In this exercise we will use the  DAYS function to determine how many days fall between a series of start 
and end  dates .
 1. 
 Create a new worksheet named “DAYS.” 
 2. 
 Enter the data as shown in Figure  8-53 :
 a. 
 Enter and format the column heads. 
 b. 
 Enter the date in cell A2 and then hold down the Ctrl key while you use the 
AutoFill Handle to copy the date down through cell A12. Remember holding 
down the Ctrl Key copies the cell rather than creating a series. 
 c. 
 Enter the date in cell B2 and drag the AutoFill Handle from cell B2 to B5. 
 d. 
 Enter the date in cell B6 and drag the AutoFill Handle from cell B6 to B10. See 
Figure  8-53 . 

CHAPTER 8 ■ EXCEL’S PRE-EXISTING FUNCTIONS

 3. 
 In cell C2 enter  =DAYS( 
 4. 
 Select cell B2 for the  end_date argument. Enter a comma 
 5. 
 Select cell A2 for the  start_date argument. See Figure  8-54 .

 Figure 8-55.  Result of using  DAYS function in column C 
 Now that you have experience using the  DAYS function try the following exercises: 
 Find out how many days you have been alive .
 1. 
 In cell A11 enter your birthday. 
 2. 
 In cell B11 enter  =TODAY() 
 3. 
 In cell C11 enter  =DAYS(B11,A11) 
 Find out how many days till Christmas 
 1. 
 In cell A12 enter  =TODAY() 
 2. 
 In cell B12 enter the date for Christmas for the current year  
 3. 
 In cell C12 enter the  DAYS function to compute the number of days between the 
current date and Christmas. 
 You have learned how to handle dates and extract just the portion of a date that you want. Don’t forget 
that you can’t use a date directly in a math formula; rather, you must use the cell address of the date in the 
formula. 
 Summary 
 This chapter dealt with functions. You have learned the two ways of entering a formula: either directly into 
a cell or by using the Insert Function option. The Insert Function dialog box helps you find the function you 
want to use. Another benefit of the Insert Function dialog box is that it shows the result for each argument 
that you enter. You might want to use Insert Function until you become very familiar with the function and 
then switch to the quicker method of entering functions directly in the cell. You have seen how functions can 
determine what needs to be done based on if a condition exists or not. 
 The next chapter deals with handling errors and protecting the workbook from someone inadvertently 
or purposefully enters something he shouldn’t.

 CHAPTER 9  
 Auditing, Validating, and 
Protecting Your Data 
 As the creator of the Excel workbook, it is your primary responsibility to ensure that the data on the 
worksheets has been entered correctly. You may not have control of the source of the data, but it is your 
responsibility to ensure that you enter the data you are given without error. Poor data and incorrect entries 
can ruin a business. Errors made in one location may be propagated to other areas in the workbook. Users 
may be incorporating the data from your workbooks into their own projects or they may be using your 
workbooks to base their decisions on. Excel provides several tools to help you prevent errors from getting 
into your workbooks, but it is up to you to incorporate them. 
 After reading and working through this chapter you should be able to
• 
 Identify errors 
• 
 Use data validation to prevent errors 
• 
 Circle invalid data and clear validation circles 
• 
 Check a formula for an error using the  IFERROR function 
• 
 Correct circular references 
• 
 Audit formulas by:
• 
 Tracing dependents 
• 
 Tracing precedents 
• 
 Using the Watch Window 
• 
 Using the  Evaluate Formula feature 
• 
 Have Excel read back your cell entries 
• 
 Use Spell Checker and Thesaurus 
• 
 Protect worksheets and cells 
 Validating Your Data and Preventing Errors 
 Excel has many tools to help you prevent errors from being entered into your applications, but it is still up to 
you to review all your entries and to check that the results of your calculations and functions look credible. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ AUDITING, VALIDATING, AND PROTECTING YOUR DATA
304
 Data Validation 
 One of the most important functions an Excel developer can perform is to make sure that errors do not 
get into the spreadsheets. You need to make it as easy as possible for the user to understand what is to be 
entered and as easy as possible to enter the data. You don’t want the user to have to guess what it is he is 
supposed to enter and then make a wrong assumption. One way to make sure data is entered correctly is by 
using the  Data Validation feature. Data validation consists of various validation rules that specify the criteria 
for how the data is to be entered. If the data is still entered incorrectly you can stop the data from being 
accepted. If the user has entered something questionable you can provide her with a warning or information 
message and then let her decide if the data should be accepted or not. 
 Data being entered can be restricted to the following:
• 
 values in a drop-down list 
• 
 a whole number within a specified range 
• 
 a decimal number within a specified range 
• 
 a date within a specified time frame 
• 
 a time within a specified time frame 
• 
 a specified length 
• 
 a value based on the content of another cell 
• 
 a value based on a formula 
 The Data Validation button is located on the Ribbon’s Data tab in the  Data Tools group (Figure  9-1 ). 
 The Data Validation button is divided into two sections. Clicking the upper half of the Data Validation 
button brings up the Data Validation dialog box. 
 The Data Validation  dialog box contains three tabs (see Figure  9-2 ):
• 
  Settings tab: used for setting the rules for what can be entered in a cell.  
• 
  Input Message tab: creates a screen tip that tells the user what he should enter in the 
cell. 
• 
  Error Alert tab: can be used for warning that the entry does not follow the rules you 
have set up or it can be used to stop the entry if rules have been broken. 
 Figure 9-1.  The Ribbon’s  Data Tools group 
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ AUDITING, VALIDATING, AND PROTECTING YOUR DATA

 Clicking the lower half of the Data Validation button brings up the three  options   shown in Figure  9-3 . 
 Clicking the first option (Data Validation) gives the same result as clicking the upper half of the button.

EXERCISE 9-1: CREATING DATA VALIDATION
 For this exercise you will create data validation for six fields to warn users about potential problems or 
to prevent them from making invalid entries. 
 All of the entries you will need to make for this practice are in workbook Chapter   9  on the Validation 
tab. The worksheet shows what you will need to enter for each option on the three tabs of the Data 
Validation dialog box. You can print the worksheet and then use it as you go through this exercise or you 
can follow along with the  instruction given for each column.
 1. 
 Open workbook Chapter   9  . Click the Val_Entry worksheet tab. Figure  9-4 shows the 
column headings from worksheet Val_Entry. The entries that you will need to make 
for this exercise are to the right of the column headings. There is a second copy on 
the Validation worksheet. 
 The Order ID must start with either an SR or a GR. We will prevent the user from 
entering any other text for the first two characters. We will perform a Validation 
check for the Order ID whenever the user enters a value in any cell in the range 
A3:A12. 
 2. 
 Select the cell range A2:A12. 
 3. 
 Click the Data Tab. In the Data Tools group click the upper half of the  Data Validation 
button.  
 The Data Validation window appears. See Figure  9-5 . The workbook Chapter   9  
Validation worksheet contains all of the entries you will be making on the Data 
Validation window. 
 4. 
 Click the  Settings tab if it isn’t already selected. 
 5. 
 Click the down arrow for Allow and select  Custom . The Custom option is for 
entering formulas. 
 6. 
 Because we want to check the first two characters in the OrderID we will use the 
 LEFT function. 
 The syntax for the  LEFT  function is: 
 = LEFT(text, [num_chars]) 
 Figure 9-4.  Column headings for Chapter   9 workbook 
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ AUDITING, VALIDATING, AND PROTECTING YOUR DATA
307
 Arguments are
 text is either text or a cell address containing the text  
 num_chars is the number of characters you want from the beginning of the string. 
 Enter the formula  =OR(LEFT(A2,2) = "SR",LEFT(A2,2) = "GR") in the Formula box. 
 The formula uses the  OR function. The formula tests if the first two characters entered in cell 
A2 are SR or GR, then the result is True; otherwise it returns a False. If either argument is 
true, then the result is true and Excel will accept it. We are using cell A3, which is the first 
cell in the range. Excel will automatically adjust the formula for each cell in the range. 
 7. 
 Click the Input Message tab. The entries you need to make for these exerercises 
are located to the right of the column headings on the Val_Entry worksheet. You 
can see that on the Input Message tab you need to enter a Title of “Order ID 
Restrictions” and an Input message of “Order ID’s must start with the letters SR or 
GR.” Make those entries now. Your  Input Message tab should look like Figure  9-6 . 
 Figure 9-5.  Formula ensures that Order  ID starts with an SR or GR 
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ AUDITING, VALIDATING, AND PROTECTING YOUR DATA
308
 The input message on the  Input Message tab informs the user about any entry restrictions, 
but if the user breaks the rule entered on the Settings tab we want to display an error 
message. 
 8. 
 Click the Error Alert tab. 
 9. 
 Select Stop for the style. The style of  Stop prevents an invalid entry from being 
accepted. 
 10. 
 Enter the title “Order ID Error” 
 11. 
 Enter the error message “Order IDs can only start with the letters SR or GR.” See 
Figure  9-7 . 
 12. 
 Click the OK button. 
 Figure 9-6.  Message appears when an Order ID cell is selected 
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ AUDITING, VALIDATING, AND PROTECTING YOUR DATA
309
 13. 
 Click inside cell A2. You should see the message you created on the Input Message 
tab (Figure  9-8 ). 
 14.

 Circling Invalid Data  
 We set the Credit Limit, Order Time, and Shipping Weight to use the Warning and Information styles 
rather than the Stop Style on the Error Alert tab. This allowed us to break the rule that we had set up on 
the Settings tab. We can have Excel place a circle around all those cells that broke a rule.
 1. 
 Click the Validation button drop-down arrow then select Circle Invalid Data. See 
Figure  9-18 . 
 2. 
 Click the Validation button drop-down arrow and then select Clear Validation 
Circles.

 Evaluating Formulas 
 Excel can often recognize when there is a problem with a function, such as informing you when there are 
circular references. Table  9-6 shows some of the  errors that Excel displays when it finds what it thinks is an error.  
 Using  IFERROR 
 The  IFERROR function checks a formula (or expression) and returns the results if there is no error; otherwise 
it returns a value you specify. 
 The syntax for the  IFERROR function is: 
 =IFERROR(value, value_if_error) 
 Arguments:
 value  is the expression being tested. 
 value_if_error is the text that will be returned if there is an error in the 
expression 
 Table 9-6.  Error Value Messages 
 Error Value 
 Meaning 
 Causes 
 #DIV/0 
 Division by zero 
 Error occurs when attempting to divide a value 
by zero or if you try to divide a value by an 
empty cell. 
 #N/A 
 No value available 
 This isn’t necessarily an error. It means that 
what you are looking for doesn’t exist in your 
lookup table. For example, if you use  VLOOKUP 
and there was no match for your  lookup_value 
argument. 
 #NAME? 
 The formula contains unrecognized text 
 Error occurs when you use a nonexistent range 
name or sheet name, or the function name 
is misspelled, or you forget to put quotation 
marks around a text string in a formula. 
 #NULL! 
 Cell references are not separated correctly  Error occurs if you use a space instead of a 
comma to separate cell references or ranges. 
The error can also occur if you forget to put 
an operator between cell references, such 
as forgetting to put one of the plus signs in a 
formula such as  = B3 + C3 D3 
 #NUM! 
 Formula uses an invalid number 
 The formula is using an invalid number such as 
entering an invalid serial date number 
 #REF! 
 Invalid cell reference 
 Error occurs when the formula uses a cell 
reference that for some reason no longer 
exists, such as if you deleted a value that was 
referenced by a formula. 
 #VALUE! 
 Formula used the wrong type of data for 
an argument 
 Used text for an argument that was used for a 
mathematical operation. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ AUDITING, VALIDATING, AND PROTECTING YOUR DATA
320
 The  IFERROR can’t distinguish the type of error. The error could be DIV/0, #NAME, #N/A, #REF, and so 
on. What is used as the  value_if error argument will be displayed regardless of the error type. 
 The formula  =IF(Sales > 25000,B3 + B2, B4 + B2)  would return a #NAME? error if the Sales range 
didn’t exist. If you wanted to test for such a condition, you would use the  formula   
 =IFERROR(IF(Sales > 25000,B3 + B2, B4 + B2),"Range name doesn't exist") 
 If the Sales range didn’t exist, Excel would display  Range name doesn’t exist in the cell where you 
entered the formula. If the range did exist, the  IF function would perform as normal. 
 In Figure  9-21 , cell C1 contains the formula  =a1/b1 and cell C2 contains the formula  =a2/b2 . Cell C1 has 
a divide by zero error. Cell C2 has a #VALUE! error because it attempted to divide by an alpha character.  
 You could make these messages more meaningful by using the  IFERROR  function. Entering the formula 
 =IFERROR(A1/B1,"Divided by Zero") into cell C1 
 and the formula  =IFERROR(A2/B2,"Divided by text") in cell C2 would produce the result shown in 
Figure  9-22 . 
 
■ Note   Be careful how you use the  IFERROR function. If we used the formula  =IFERROR(A1/B1,"Divided by 
Zero") in both cell C1 and C2 the result would be the same; both would display “Divided by Zero.” 
 Correcting  Circular References 
 A circular reference occurs when a formula in a cell refers to itself either directly or indirectly. This is usually 
something you do not want to occur; however, there are rare occasions when you do (e.g., when doing 
iterative calculations). 
 Figure  9-23 shows a circular reference. The cell address A4 is used in a formula in cell A4. 
 Figure 9-21.  Invalid values for formulas

CHAPTER 9 ■ AUDITING, VALIDATING, AND PROTECTING YOUR DATA
321
 The first time you create a circular reference on a worksheet you will see the message in Figure  9-24 . 
 When you click the OK button Excel places a zero in the cell that contains the circular reference. See 
Figure  9-25 . You will have to evaluate the formula to determine what it should be. 
 It is easy to accidentally create a circular reference when you are using the  SUM  function and you drag 
across the cells that are to be summed and you include the formula cell. See Figure  9-26 . 
 Figure 9-24.    Message for first circular reference       
 Figure 9-25.  Excel places a zero in a cell that contains the circular reference 
 Figure 9-26.  The SUM function includes its own address in its argument 
 Figure 9-23.  The formula in cell A4 references its own cell address       
 
 
 
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ AUDITING, VALIDATING, AND PROTECTING YOUR DATA
322
 Figure  9-27 shows an  indirect circular reference . The formula in cell A2 includes the address C2, which in 
turn uses cell A2 in its address. 
 After you have entered an indirect circular reference, Excel displays tracer arrows to show you which 
cells are involved in the circular reference. See Figure  9-28 .  
 Double-clicking the arrow in cell A2 makes C2 the active cell. Double-click it again and cell A2 becomes 
the active cell again.  
 Formula Auditing 
 The Excel Formula Auditing group has tools for tracking the relationship between cells and the formulas 
they use. The Formula Auditing group is located on the Ribbon’s Formulas tab. See Figure  9-29 .  
 Tracing Precedents and Dependents 
 Precedents are values from other cells that are used in a formula. Dependents are values that are affected by 
a formula. Tracing precedents and dependents gives you a visual view of the relationship between cell values 
and formulas. A value can be both a precedent and a dependent. Select the cell that contains the formula 
you want to check and then click the Trace Precedents button. Clicking a formula and then clicking the 
precedents button will show all of the cells whose values are used in the formula.

 Figure  9-30 shows the precedents for cell A5 and C5. Since individual cells were used in the cell A5 
formula, it shows a dot for each precedent. A cell range was used in the C5 formula, so it shows a dot for the 
first precedent and a line representing the others. 
 
EXERCISE 9-2: TRACING PRECEDENTS AND DEPENDENTS
 This exercise will take you through tracking what formulas the selected cell was used in (dependents) 
and finding which cells feed into it (precedents). You will also remove the precedent and dependent 
arrows.

 You have learned how to create tracer lines that show where the values used in your formulas are 
coming from and what cells are using the results of those formulas. Next, you will learn to add the cell 
addresses of those cells you want to closely monitor to a Watch Window. The Watch Window will reflect any 
changes in the values of these cells. 
 Using the  Watch Window 
 The Watch window is useful when you want to see how the values you are entering are affecting the results of 
formulas that you can’t see. The formula may not be visible because it is on another worksheet. The formula may 
also be on the same worksheet, but it is in a location where you would have to repeatedly scroll back and forth. 
The Watch Window button is located on the Formulas tab in the Formula Auditing group. See Figure  9-34 .  
 Cells are added to the Watch Window by clicking the Watch Window button, selecting the cells to be 
added, and then clicking the Add Watch button. Cells are removed from the Watch Window by selecting the 
items you want to remove and then clicking the Delete Watch button. 
 
EXERCISE 9-3: USING THE WATCH WINDOW
 In this exercise, you will add cells to the Watch Window and then remove cells.

 You can see how changing the value in cell C3 to 600 has changed the values in cells 
B1, B4, and B6 on the Sales-Totals worksheet. See Figure  9-37 . These cells contained 
the formulas for January total sales, the quarterly sales, and salesman 127.  
 5. 
 Change the value in cell C4 to 700. It changed the values for the January totals, 
quarterly totals, and totals for salesman 235. 
 Removing Cells from the    Watch Window  
 Remove the cells from the Watch Window by clicking the items and then clicking the Delete Watch 
button. 
 You have learned how to control what cells are monitored by either adding or removing cell addresses 
from the Watch Window. Next, you will learn how to evaluate a nested function, step by step. Nested 
functions can be very complex and it becomes difficult to determine the different parts. The  Evaluate feature 
goes through the parts of the nested function one step at a time while it shows intermediate results.  
 Using the Evaluate Formula Feature to Evaluate a  Nested Function

 9. 
 Select cells A1:C4. Click the  Speak Cells by Rows button on the Quick Access 
Toolbar. Click the  Speak Cells button on the Quick Access Toolbar. Excel speaks the 
data in row order. 
 10. 
 Click the  Speak Cells by Columns button. Click the  Speak Cells button. Excel 
speaks the data in column order. Click the  Speak Cells—Stop Speaking Cells 
button before Excel has finished reading all of the data. Excel provides the 
capability to stop speaking at any point and then continue from that point. Now if 
you click  Speak Cells , Excel will start reading from the point where you clicked the 
 Speak Cells—Stop Speaking Cells button. 
 Spell Checking  
 The Spelling and Thesaurus buttons are located on the Review tab, in the Proofing group. See Figure  9-50 . 
 To avoid the embarrassment of turning in a workbook with misspelled words you should always check it 
with Excel’s Spell Checker. You could test a range of cells or the entire worksheet. If you select a range of cells 
before clicking the Spell Checker, only that range of cells will be checked. If you have only one cell selected 
or if you click the Select All button to the left of column A, then it will check the entire worksheet. 
 If Excel can’t find a word in its dictionary, it will display it in the Not in Dictionary text box. It provides 
one or more suggestions of how it thinks it should be spelled in the Suggestions: list box. See Figure  9-51 .

 The purpose of the buttons are as follows:
• 
 Ignore Once— Tells Excel that you don’t want to change the spelling at the current 
cell but you still want to test the word in other locations.  
• 
 Ignore All— Tells Excel you don’t want to change the spelling of the word in the  Not 
in Dictionary text box in this location or in any other location on the worksheet. 
• 
 Add to Dictionary— Adds the word to Excel’s dictionary. Excel will never tell you 
again that the word is misspelled. 
• 
 Change— Replaces the word in your worksheet cell with the word you have selected 
in the Suggestions: list box. 
• 
 Change All— Changes all occurrences in your worksheet of the word in the Not in 
Dictionary text box with the one you have selected in the Suggestions: list box. 
• 
 AutoCorrect— Adds the word selected in the Suggestions: list box as the replacement 
for the word in the Not in Dictionary for Excel’s AutoCorrect feature. 
• 
 Dictionary Language— Allows you to select from one of many different dictionaries.     
 Thesaurus 
 If you are looking for a word that has a similar meaning to a word in your spreadsheet you can use Excel’s 
Thesaurus. Just select the word and then click the Thesaurus button. Figure  9-52 shows that the word 
 Synchronizing was selected when the Thesaurus button was clicked.

 Protect Worksheets and Cells from Accidental or Intentional 
Changes 
 You can protect your workbook data by preventing users from accidentally or intentionally changing, 
adding, or deleting your data. 
 You can protect your data at the workbook level, the worksheet level or the cell level. You have already 
seen how to protect your data on the Workbook level in Chapter   6 . You will now see how to use worksheet 
and cell level protection. 
 Protect Your Data at the Worksheet  Level 
 The commands needed for Worksheet-level and cell-level protection can be found on the Review tab in the 
Changes group. See Figure  9-55 . 
 All cells in a workbook are locked by default. Locked Cells don’t provide any protection until you click 
the Protect Sheet button. Right-clicking a cell and then selecting Format Cells brings up the Format Cells 
window. If you click the Protection tab you will see that locked is checked. See Figure  9-56 .

 Summary 
 Excel has many helpful features to make sure that data entries are made correctly and, if they aren’t, to notify 
you immediately so that you can correct the error. You have seen how Excel can correct your misspellings 
and suggest other words to use from their Thesaurus. You have seen how you can get visual cues to track 
the movement in and out of Formulas. Excel also shows tracer arrows to show which cells are involved in a 
Circular Reference. 
 The next chapter covers how to create, edit, and remove hyperlinks. A hyperlink is often just called 
a link. You have most likely used them a lot on the Internet, linking from one location on the web site to 
another or to an entirely different webs ite. Hyperlinks are text or objects that you can click to take you to 
somewhere within the current application or applications such as to another workbook, a web site, an e-mail 
application, and so on. We will also look how you can combine text from multiple columns along with any 
other text you wish to add.

 CHAPTER 10  
 Using Hyperlinks, Combining Text, 
and Working with the Status Bar 
 A hyperlink can be either text or an object such as a picture or a chart element that, when clicked, takes you 
to another location (e.g., a specific location in your document) or brings up information from another file or 
web page. You have probably used hyperlinks on the Internet. Clicking a hyperlink in a web page can either 
take you to a different location on that page or to a completely different web page. 
 The  Concatenation and  Flash Fill features allow you to combine text from multiple cells and add 
additional text. 
 Also in this chapter you will learn how to display information related to your spreadsheet on the status bar.    
 After reading and working through this chapter you should be able to:
• 
 Hyperlink to a web page 
• 
 Hyperlink to a file 
• 
 Hyperlink to an e-mail 
• 
 Hyperlink to a location in the current workbook 
• 
 Create a hyperlink that will create and open a new workbook 
• 
 Remove hyperlinks 
• 
 Create Concatenation 
• 
 Use Flash Fill 
 Working with Hyperlinks 
 Hyperlinks are usually displayed in a different color (usually blue) and often underlined so that they are 
easily identifiable. To make them even more identifiable, the mouse cursor changes to a pointing hand 
indicator when moved over a hyperlink. You can use hyperlinks in Excel to link to the following:
• 
 A file or web page (the file could be another spreadsheet file or it could be another 
type of file such as a word document) 
• 
 A particular cell in the current workbook 
• 
 A new document 
• 
 An e-mail address 

CHAPTER 10 ■ USING HYPERLINKS, COMBINING TEXT, AND WORKING WITH THE STATUS BAR
344
 Hyperlinking to another file opens the file in the program associated with that file type. For example, if you 
 create a hyperlink to a file with the extension of  .docx , Excel will open that file in Word when that hyperlink is 
clicked. If you create a hyperlink to a file with the extension of  .psd , Excel will open that file in Photoshop. 
 To bring up the  Insert Hyperlink Window you would perform the following steps:
 
 1. 
 Click the cell in which you want to place the hyperlink,  
 
 2. 
 On the Ribbon, click the Insert tab. In the Links group click the Hyperlink button.  
 
 3. 
 From the Insert Hyperlink dialog box, do the following:
 a. 
  Select the type of link you wish to create from the  Link to pane . 
 b. 
  Enter the text the hyperlink should display in the  Text to display  text box.  
 c. 
 Select or enter the address you want to hyperlink to and enter any screen tips 
you want to display. See Figure  10-1 . 
 Figure 10-1.  Insert Hyperlink dialog box 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ USING HYPERLINKS, COMBINING TEXT, AND WORKING WITH THE STATUS BAR
345
 The first thing you need to do when creating a hyperlink is to decide what type of link you want to 
create. You select the type of link you want to create by clicking the appropriate button in the  Link to pane 
located on the left-hand side of the window. See Figure  10-1 . The options that appear to the right of the 
 Link to pane change depending on the button you selected in the  Link to pane . For example, clicking the 
 Existing File or Web Page button will display different options to the right then if you had clicked the  Place 
in This Document button. 
 If there was any text in the spreadsheet cell when you inserted the hyperlink it appears in the  Text to 
display text box. Whatever you enter in this text box will display in your cell; it will override any text currently 
in the cell. To the right of the text box is a ScreenTip… button. Clicking the ScreenTip button brings up a 
window in which you can enter a description of the hyperlink. This description will display for a short time 
when the user moves the mouse over the hyperlink. The location of where you are linking to would be 
entered in the  Address box. 
 A hyperlink can be removed by right-clicking inside the cell of the hyperlink and then selecting  Remove 
Hyperlink  from the context menu. 
 The next four exercises provide practice in hyperlinking to a web page, to a file, to a location in the 
current workbook, and to a newly created Excel workbook. 
 
EXERCISE 10-1: HYPERLINKING TO A WEB PAGE
 In this exercise you will hyperlink to web pages. You will use automatic hyperlinking and you will see 
how to undo automatic hyperlinking. You will also use words other than a URL (uniform resource locator) 
 address to access a web page.
 1. 
 Create a new workbook named “Hyperlinks.” 
 Hyperlinks to web pages are created automatically in Excel if you type an 
appropriate web address that starts with  http:// or  www. in a cell type, provided 
that you have the option to do this turned on. You will now check if that option has 
been turned on. 
 2. 
 Click File ➤ Options. 
 3. 
 From the Excel Options dialog box, select Proofing. Click the AutoCorrect Options… 
button on the right pane of the window. 
 4. 
 Click the  AutoFormat As You Type tab.  Select  Internet and network paths with 
hyperlinks if it isn’t already selected. See Figure  10-2 . Click OK.

346
 5. 
 Click the OK button on the Excel Options dialog box. 
 6. 
 Type    www.apress.com  in cell A1 then press Enter. Because you set the option to 
automatically create hyperlinks whenever you type an appropriate web address 
(starts with http:// or www.) a hyperlink is automatically created. 
 7. 
 Move your cursor over the text you just entered in cell A1. The cursor should display 
as a pointing finger. A tooltip displays the hyperlink address. Click the hyperlink. 
 8. 
 Close the Web page. 
 The hyperlink works, but what if you wanted the words  Apress Corporation to appear in 
the cell instead of    www.apress.com  ? You will need to edit the hyperlink. 
 9. 
 Right-click cell A1 then select  Edit Hyperlink. 
 10. 
 Change the text in the Text to display text box to  Apress Corporation . See 
Figure  10-3 . The address should be correct. Click OK. 
 11. 
 Cell A1 now displays  Apress Corporation . Click the text. The Apress web site should 
display. Close your Internet browser. 
 Next, let’s link to an e-mail address.

 12. 
 Type  jhall@hotmail.com in cell A3 and then press Enter. 
 13. 
 Click the  e-mail address you just created. 
 When you click a hyperlink to an e-mail address, your e-mail program automatically 
starts and creates an e-mail message with the correct address in the  To box, 
provided that you have an e-mail program installed, such as Outlook. 
 What if you want to enter a URL that is not hyperlinked?  
 14. 
 Type    www.MadeinUsa.com  in cell A5 and then press Enter. 
 15. 
 Widen the column so that all the text fits within the cell. Move your cursor over the 
text you just entered in cell A5. The first w in the hyperlink is underlined. Move your 
mouse cursor over the underline and a menu Tag should appear. 
 16. 
 Click the menu tag to bring up a context menu. See Figure  10-4 .

CHAPTER 10 ■ USING HYPERLINKS, COMBINING TEXT, AND WORKING WITH THE STATUS BAR
355
 
EXERCISE 10-4: CREATING A HYPERLINK TO A NEWLY CREATED 
EXCEL  WORKBOOK  
 You can create a hyperlink that, when clicked for the first time, creates a new Excel workbook and then 
opens that workbook. Every time you click it thereafter it will open the workbook. The Excel workbook 
will be given a name that you have assigned within the Hyperlink options.
 1. 
 Use the same workbook as the previous practice. 
 2. 
 On Sheet2 enter the text “Hyperlink to a New Document” in cell A1. Press Ctrl + Enter.  
 3. 
 Right-click cell A1 and select Hyperlink. 
 4. 
 The Insert Hyperlink window appears. In the  Link to : area click Create New Document.  
 5. 
 Click the ScreenTip… button. 
 6. 
 Enter “Takes you to a newly created Excel workbook named Hyperlink_Practice” for 
the ScreenTip text. Click OK. 
 7. 
 Enter Hyperlink_Practice for the Name of new document.  
 8. 
 Change the path if you need to. 
 In the  When to edit section you have two options: you can either select to go immediately to 
the newly created workbook or create the workbook and then open it whenever you choose to.  
 9. 
 Select the option  Edit the new document now . See Figure  10-13 . 
 10. 
 Click the OK button. 
 Figure 10-13.  Select Edit the new document now on the Insert Hyperlink window 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ USING HYPERLINKS, COMBINING TEXT, AND WORKING WITH THE STATUS BAR
356
 11. 
 Your cursor should now be in cell A1 of the newly created workbook named 
Hyperlink_Practice. Go back to your workbook named Hyperlinks. Click Sheet2 tab 
cell A1. Since Hyperlink_Practice has already been created, Excel will not try to 
recreate it, but it will take you to the Hyperlink_Practice workbook. Before opening 
the Hyperlink_Practice workbook Excel may display a Security Notice window. 
Since you created the hyperlink yourself, you know it is safe so click the Yes button. 
 You have learned how to create and remove hyperlinks. You can create hyperlinks to open documents 
and take you to various web sites on the Internet, different locations in Excel workbooks, and so on. If you 
want a user to get information from another location, then use hyperlinks. It saves the user a lot of time in 
locating the information. Next, you will see how to combine data from different cells (e.g., combining the 
first, middle, and last names into one column). 
 Concatenation  and Flash Fill 
 Joining the data from multiple cells or joining cell data with additional text into a single text item is called 
 concatenation . The symbol used to perform concatenation is the & (ampersand). An ampersand must be 
placed between each cell address and each additional string of text that you’re adding. 
 For example, if you wanted to combine the contents of cell A1 and B1 and place the results in cell 
C1 then you would need to place the following formula in cell C1  =A1&B1 . If you wanted to place a space 
between the data in cell A1 and cell B2 you would need to change the formula to  =A1&" "&B1 . A space 
between two quotation marks creates a blank space. If you wanted two spaces between the data you would 
place two spaces between the quotation marks. 
 Figure  10-14  displays a concatenation starting in cell A8 that includes the contents from columns A, B, 
and C along with additional text. The formula entered in cell A8 is  
 = A2 & " " & B2 & " used " & "$" & C2 & " of fuel this week" 
 The formula was copied down through cell A12 using the AutoFill Handle. 
  Figure 10-14.  Combining data from columns A, B, and C 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ USING HYPERLINKS, COMBINING TEXT, AND WORKING WITH THE STATUS BAR
357
 
EXERCISE 10-5: USING CONCATENATION
 In this exercise you will use the & character to combine column data along with other characters.
 1. 
 Open the workbook Chapter   10  . 
 2. 
 Click the worksheet Concatenation. 
 3. 
 Figure  10-15 shows the data in the worksheet. 
 4. 
 In this exercise you will combine the City, State, and Zip into a single cell. In cell D2 
enter the following formula and then press Ctrl + Enter: 
 =A2 & ", " & B2 & "  " & C2 
 The formula displays a comma after the city followed by a space and provides two 
spaces between the state and zip. 
 5. 
 Widen column D so that the city, state, and zip all fit inside the column. 
 6. 
 Drag the AutoFill Handle from cell D2 down through cell D5. The result should be as 
shown in Figure  10-16 . 
 Now that you have practiced using concatenation, let’s look at a feature called   Flash Fill , which can do 
concatenation without having to use the & sign. Flash Fill can speed up concatenation when you want to 
concatenate values that are in a row. You enter an example of how you want the data to appear. Excel checks 
for that pattern in the other rows and using Flash Fill copies that pattern down through the column.

 It is still necessary to know how to concatenate using the & sign when
 
 1. 
 You are concatenating to a single cell 
 
 2. 
 You are using it in a formula 
 
 3. 
 What you are concatenating isn’t in the same row  
 
 4. 
 You are using it in programming code 
 Let’s look at the same sample that was used for concatenation. Flash Fill would not have worked in 
that example because the concatenation was done on rows that were not in the same row as the data. The 
Flash Fill does a lot more than just concatenation. It can be used to find patterns in your columns and then 
to repeat those patterns in another column. For example, you could create a column that uses the first letter 
from a column containing middle names or create a column that uses the day portion from a date column. 
 For this example, we will put the concatenation on the same line as the data it is assembling. 
 
EXERCISE 10-6: USING FLASH FILL
 In this example you will use Flash Fill to combine multiple columns of data along with additional text.
 1. 
 Open workbook Chapter   10  if it isn’t already opened. 
 2. 
 Click worksheet FlashFill A. 
 3. 
 Figure  10-17 shows the data in the  worksheet . 
 4. 
 In cell D2 type  Mike Romanchok used $28.95 of fuel this week . Press Enter. Your 
cursor should be in cell D3. 
 5. 
 Click the  Home tab . In the Editing group click the Fill button and then select Flash 
Fill. See Figure  10-18 . 
 Figure 10-17.  Data in worksheet FlashFill A 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ USING HYPERLINKS, COMBINING TEXT, AND WORKING WITH THE STATUS BAR

 Flash Fill used the three columns of data along with the additional text you typed. It even put the dollar 
sign in front of each of the amounts. See Figure  10-19 . 
 
EXERCISE 10-7: USING MORE FLASH FILL FEATURES
 This exercise will show different  features as well as showing a potential problem that can arise when 
using Flash Fill.
 1. 
 Open workbook Chapter   10  if it isn’t already opened. 
 2. 
 Click worksheet 3 Names. 
 3.

 We want to combine the individual’s first and last name. 
 4. 
 In cell D2 type  John Studebaker and then press Enter. Widen the column to fit the 
name. 
 5. 
 Click inside cell D3. 
 Instead of going through the process of clicking the Home page, then clicking 
the Fill button in the Editing group, and then selecting Flash Fill, we will use the 
shortcut key for Flash Fill: Ctrl + E. 
 6. 
 Press CTRL + e. Figure  10-21 shows the result. 
 You need to be careful about your spelling which will be illustrated in the 
steps below. 
 7. 
 Select the data in column D. Right-click the selected data and select Clear 
Contents. 
 8. 
 In cell D2 type  John Sludebaker and then press Enter. 
 9. 
 Press CTRL + e. 
 Since Excel couldn’t find a match name in the row it created the new name of 
Sludebaker for all of the copied cells. See Figure  10-22 . 
 Figure 10-20.  Data on the worksheet named 3 Names

 If you make a change to the end of the text, that change is reflected in the rows 
below. 
 10. 
 Clear the contents in column D. 
 11. 
 In cell D2 type  John Studebaker’s and then press Enter 
 12. 
 Press CTRL + e. Figure  10-23 shows the results. 
 
■ Note If we hadn’t bolded or centered the column headers in columns A, B, and C, Excel wouldn’t have 
known they were column headers. This would have created a problem when we applied Flash Fill. Excel would 
have combined the text in cell A1 and cell C1 and placed it into cell D1. This problem could also be avoided by 
putting a column header in cell D1. 
 You don’t need to enter the data from the columns in the same order. We can easily 
use the last name, followed by a column, then a space, and then the first name. 
 13. 
 Clear the contents in column D. 
 14. 
 In cell D2 type  Studebaker, John and then press Enter. 
 15. 
 Press CTRL + e. Figure  10-24 shows the results.

362
 The number of characters you type will be the number of characters that will be 
displayed from that column. If you type the first two letters in the name Studebaker 
then use Flash Fill, Excel will display the first two letters of the other last names. 
See Figure  10-25 
 The last name Shaw only contains four characters so if you enter more than four 
characters of the last name the name Shaw will not appear at all. See Figure  10-26 . 
 Figure 10-24.  Result of changing cell D2 to Studebaker, John

 Let’s show an example where we combine the individual’s first initial and last name. 
 16. 
 Clear the contents in column D. 
 17. 
 In cell D2 type  J. Studebaker and then press Enter. 
 18. 
 Press Ctrl + e. The results are shown in Figure  10-27 . 
 Potential Problem  
 In the second row John and James both start with a “J,” which can cause some confusion. When there 
is a duplicate of text, Excel uses the left-most column. If we type John J. Studebaker and then use Flash 
Fill, Excel will use the initial from column A rather than column B. See Figure  10-28 . 
 If we want to use the middle initials we have to teach it the correct pattern. We can do this by typing 
the data from the next row(s) until the pattern meets our requirement. Since the middle name in row 3 
doesn’t have the same initial as the first name it will meet our needs. 
 1. 
 Clear the contents in column D. 
 2. 
 In cell D3 type  Carrie M. Romanchok and then press Enter.

 Press Ctrl + e. Figure  10-29 shows the results. 
 Using the Status Bar 
 The status bar at the bottom of your Excel window can be used to display lots of useful information. You can 
view computational results on different ranges without ever having to enter any formulas. What is displayed 
on the status bar is up to you. Right-clicking the status bar brings up all the available  options , as shown in 
Figure  10-30 . You merely select the options you want to see and deselect those you don’t want to see. The 
selected items appear with check marks to the left of them. Clicking anywhere on a line that has a check 
mark on it will remove the check mark. Clicking anywhere on a line that doesn’t have a check mark will place 
a check mark on it.  
 In this section, we’ll look at most of the options. We’ll omit Signatures, Information Management Policy, 
and Permissions because these options are used only when dealing with SharePoint.

 Cell Mode 
 The Cell Mode is displayed in the left-most position of the status bar. It displays one of three words:  Ready , 
 Enter , or  Edit. Ready indicates that the cell is ready for you to enter data into. If you are entering data into a 
cell, the word  Enter appears. If you double-click a cell to put it in edit mode, then the word  Edit will appear. 
 Flash Fill Blank Cells and Flash Fill Changed Cells 
 If these options are turned on whenever you do a Flash Fill, the status bar will display the number of Blank 
cells and the number of cells Flash Fill changed. 
 Using the data in Figure  10-31 , if you typed  Rhianna Slager in cell D1 to show Excel the 
pattern, selected the cell range D1:D4, and then pressed CTRL + e to start Flash Fill, there would 
be one blank cell and two cells would have changed which would show on the status 
bar as 
  
 The resulting spreadsheet would look like Figure  10-32 . 
 Caps Lock, Num Lock 
 The words  Caps Lock or  Num Lock will display if they are turned on. 
 Scroll Lock 
 The words  Scroll Lock will display if Scroll Lock is turned on. Scroll Lock is helpful when you want to scroll 
through your worksheet but you want to keep track of your current location. When Scroll Lock is on, using 
your arrow keys moves your worksheet in the direction of the arrow, but the active cell doesn’t change.

 Fixed  Decimal 
 This indicates when Fixed Decimal mode is on. 
 Overtype Mode 
 Pressing the Insert key turns on Overtype Mode. If Overtype Mode is turned on and you are editing data in a 
cell, characters that you type will replace existing characters; otherwise, existing characters will move over as 
you insert new characters. 
 End Mode 
 This displays when the End key has been pressed. The End key is often used as part of a two-key 
combination. 
      Macro Recording   
 The Macro Recording displays the button  
 on the status bar when a macro is being recorded. Clicking 
the button stops the recording. 
 Selection Mode 
 The Selection Mode is used for selecting cells with your arrow keys rather than dragging across them with 
your mouse.  
 Page Number 
 The Page Number displays the current page number and total number of pages. The Page Number only 
displays in Page Layout view. 
 Average, Count, Numerical Count, Minimum, Maximum,  Sum 
 These options instantly display the result of calculations performed on the cells you select. The selected 
cells do not have to be adjacent. These math functions are called Aggregate functions. Aggregate functions 
perform a calculation on a set of values and return a single value. 
 View Shortcuts 
 These three buttons  
 appear on the right side of the task bar. They control how the 
worksheet is viewed. In order, they are the Normal view, Page Layout view, and Page Break Preview. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ USING HYPERLINKS, COMBINING TEXT, AND WORKING WITH THE STATUS BAR
368
 Zoom and Zoom Slider 
 The  Zoom option shows the current zoom percentage. The  Zoom Slider controls the amount of 
Zoom. 
 
 The Zoom tool is located on the status bar at the bottom right corner of your Excel window. You can 
drag the Zoom tool’s slider to the right to zoom in on objects (make them larger) or you can drag the slider to 
the left to zoom out on objects (make them smaller). The zoom range goes from 10% to 400%. Not only is this 
a great tool when you are developing your worksheets, but it also makes a great presentation tool. 
 In addition to dragging the slider to change the zoom ratio, you can also do the following:   
• 
 Click anywhere in the slide range and the slider will move to that position. 
• 
 Each time you click the Zoom out button  
 objects will decrease by 10% in size. 
• 
 Each time you click the Zoom in button  
 objects will increase by 10% in size. 
 
■ Note   Changing the zoom ratio only affects your worksheet. It doesn’t change the size of your ribbon.

 Summary 
 Hyperlinks can be used to create quick links to files, web pages, a particular cell, a new document, or an 
e-mail address. 
 You can combine data by using either Concatenation or Flash Fill. The & (ampersand) sign is used to 
tie different strings of data together when using concatenation. Flash Fill can connect data automatically 
without having to manually type the formula. 
 Users often forget about the status bar. This is probably because the options aren’t visible unless you 
right-click it. The status bar is the fastest way to view the results of multiple functions applied to multiple 
ranges at the same time. The results displayed on the status bar are temporary; they are not stored in cells. 
 In the next chapter you will learn the different methods of copying and pasting data. You will also see 
how to switch row and column headings. You’ll learn how to use the Microsoft Office Clipboard and how to 
key data into multiple worksheets at the same time.

 CHAPTER 11  
 Transferring and Duplicating Data 
to Other Locations 
 There are times when you place data into cells and then later decide that you would rather display that 
data in a different location, or maybe you want that data duplicated elsewhere. Excel provides a variety of 
methods for doing this as well as allowing for you to select the format of the newly transferred or duplicated 
data. This transferred or duplicated data can be copied to locations within other data, in other worksheets 
and in other workbooks. 
 After reading and working through this chapter you should be able to 
• 
 Move and copy cells using the drag-and-drop  method 
• 
 Copy and paste manually 
• 
 Copy and paste using the keyboard 
• 
 Copy data to other worksheets 
• 
 Copy data from one workbook to another 
• 
 Use Paste Special to transpose rows and columns 
• 
 Use the Paste button gallery 
• 
 Use the Add and Multiply option of Paste Special 
• 
 Use the Skip Blanks option of Paste Special  
• 
 Use the Microsoft Office Clipboard 
• 
 Insert copied or moved cells 
 Moving and Copying Data 
 You can move data using Excel’s  move feature also known as the  cut feature.  Moving  a cell moves the value 
in one cell to another cell. After the move the original cell location will be empty. Any existing values in the 
receiving location will be overwritten by the moved data. 
 You may want to have the same data in multiple locations. Rather than typing that same data over and 
over again you can use Excel’s  copy feature.  Copying  a cell involves copying the value in a cell to another 
cell. After the copy the value will exist in both the original location and the location to where the value was 
copied. Whenever you cut or copy data, a duplicate of that data is placed in the Microsoft Office Clipboard. 
The clipboard is shared with other Microsoft Office products. If you copy cells and then start Word and open 

CHAPTER 11 ■ TRANSFERRING AND DUPLICATING DATA TO OTHER LOCATIONS

its clipboard, you will see the cells that you copied in Excel. You can then paste that cell data into your Word 
document. 
 Moving a cell can be accomplished by using drag and drop or using the  cut-and-paste method. 
Copying can be accomplished by using drag and drop while holding down the Ctrl key or using the copy-
and-paste method. 
 Moving and Copying Cells Using the  Drag-and-Drop Method 
 When moving data using the drag-and-drop method follow these steps:
 
 1. 
 Select an area to be moved. 
 
 2. 
 Move the mouse cursor on one of the selected areas sides. The cursor should 
turn into a move arrow, as shown in Figure Figure  11-1 . 
 Figure 11-1.  Select area to be moved. 
 Figure 11-2.  As you drag the data, a box the size of selected area moves with the cursor. 
 
 3. 
 Drag the data to its new location. As you drag the data, a box the size of the 
selected area moves with the cursor so that you always know where the data will 
be moved. See Figure  11-2 . 
 
 4. 
  Release the mouse button. The data is moved to its new location. Any formatting 
that was applied to a cell is moved with the value. See Figure  11-3 . 
 
 

CHAPTER 11 ■ TRANSFERRING AND DUPLICATING DATA TO OTHER LOCATIONS
375
 When copying data using the drag-and-drop method follow these steps:
 
 1. 
 Select an area to be copied. 
 
 2. 
 Hold down the Ctrl key and move the mouse cursor on one of the selected areas 
sides. The cursor should turn into an arrow with a plus sign. The plus sign means 
you are copying the selected data. See Figure  11-4 . 
 Figure 11-3.  Result of moving data 
 Figure 11-4.  Select area to be moved. 
 
 3. 
 Keep the Ctrl key held down and drag the data to its new location. As you drag 
the data, a box the size of the selected area moves with the cursor so that you 
always know where the data will be copied. See Figure  11-5 . 
 Figure 11-5.  As you drag the data, a box the size of selected area moves with the cursor.

 4. 
 When the box is where you want it, release the mouse button. The data is copied 
to its new location. Any formatting that was applied to a cell is copied along with 
the value. See Figure  11-6 .

 Rather than using Cut, Copy, and Paste buttons on the Ribbon, you can select them from the context 
menu by right-clicking the selected cells. 
 
■ Note   Excel displays an animated marquee around cells that have been cut or copied. After you have 
finished pasting the contents to their new location cancel the animated marquee by pressing the Esc key. 
 Moving and Copying Cells Using the  Keyboard 
 It’s impossible to remember all the keyboard shortcuts, but you should remember the ones for copying, 
cutting, and pasting since you will be using these all the time. See Table  11-1 .  
 Table 11-1.  Keyboard Shortcuts

EXERCISE 11-1: COPYING, PASTING, AND MOVING CONTENT
 In this exercise, you duplicate cell content by using copy and paste and then move content using  cut 
and paste. 
 1. 
 Start a new workbook named Chapter   11  . Name the worksheet “CopyPaste.” 
 2. 
 Enter the data in Figure  11-8 into a worksheet. 

CHAPTER 11 ■ TRANSFERRING AND DUPLICATING DATA TO OTHER LOCATIONS
378
 Duplicate Cell Contents  
 1. 
 Select cells A1:A6. 
 2. 
 On the Home tab in the Clipboard group, click the Copy button  
 to copy the 
contents of cells A1:A6. Pressing Ctrl + C is the shortcut key for the Copy 
command. 
 An animated marquee appears around cells A1:A6 to indicate that these cells are being copied. 
 3. 
 Click inside cell C3. This is the upper-left cell of where the content will be copied to. 
 4. 
 On the Home tab in the Clipboard group, click the top half of the Paste button  
 . 
A duplicate copy of the contents in cells A1:A6 now exists in cells C3:C8.  
 5. 
 As long as the animated marquee appears around the cells being copied you can 
continue to paste them in other locations. Click inside cell C7. This time use the 
paste shortcut Ctrl + V instead of using the Paste button. When you paste content 
into cells that already have content, the original contents are copied over. 
 6. 
 Press the Esc key. The animated marquee is removed. 
 Move Cell Contents 
 1. 
 Select cells A1:A6. 
 2. 
 On the Home tab in the Clipboard group, click the Cut button  
 to cut the cells. 
Pressing Ctrl + X is the shortcut key for the Cut command. 
 3. 
 Click inside cell E1. This is the upper-left cell of where the content will be moved to. 
 4. 
 Press Ctrl + V to paste the contents to their new location. The cell contents have 
been moved to cells E1:E6. The animated marquee has been removed. 
 You have learned how to move and copy cell data by using the drag-and drop method, using keyboard 
shortcuts, and clicking the Cut and Copy command buttons. These methods didn’t provide any options for 
specifying what to paste and how to format it. If you want a choice as to how the pasted data is to appear, 
you will need to make your selection from the Paste Button Gallery. The Paste button gallery is accessed by

from the Paste options and then click the Paste Link button.  
• 
 Avoid copying blank cells to your paste area by selecting  Skip blanks . 
• 
 Change row data to columns or vice versa by selecting  Transpose . 
 
■ Helpful Hint   If you find yourself using Paste Special frequently you can add it to your Quick Access Toolbar. 
 Using Paste Special to  Transpose Rows and Columns 
 The Paste Special command has a Transpose option that is used for converting row data to column data 
and vice versa. A likely scenario in which you would use the Transpose function is that you have set up 
your row and column headings and then decide that what you really wanted was to have the row headings 
as the column headings and the column headings as the row headings. Rather than manually retyping the 
headings, you can flip-flop them by using Paste Special’s Transpose option. 
 
EXERCISE 11-5: USING THE PASTE SPECIAL TRANSPOSE OPTION
 In this exercise you will transpose the rows and columns of the original copied data.
 1. 
 Create a new workbook named Chapter 11C. Name the worksheet “Transpose.” 
 2. 
 Enter the data in Figure  11-21 . Bold the column headings. 

CHAPTER 11 ■ TRANSFERRING AND DUPLICATING DATA TO OTHER LOCATIONS

CHAPTER 11 ■ TRANSFERRING AND DUPLICATING DATA TO OTHER LOCATIONS
395
 The result should be as shown in Figure  11-23 . 
 Using Paste Special to Perform Calculations 
 Paste Special can perform calculations while pasting. Paste Special has operation options for Add, Subtract, 
Multiply, and Divide. 
 A single cell value can be pasted to a group of cells while performing an arithmetic operation, or a group 
of cells can be pasted to another group of cells while performing an arithmetic operation. 
 Let’s say you want to add the value 5 in cell A3 to each of the cells in the range A1:D1. See Figure  11-24 . 
 You would perform the following steps: 
 
 1. 
 Select cell A3 and then do a copy. 
 
 2. 
 Select the cells where you want to paste the operation. In this case that would be 
range A1:D1. 
 
 3. 
 Right-click one of the selected cells and then select Paste Special. 
 
 4. 
 Select the Add operation. 
 The result would be as shown in Figure  11-25 where 5 has been added to each value in the pasted range.  
 Figure 11-23.  Result of transposing row and column heads 
 Figure 11-24.  You will add the value in cell A3 to each cell in the range A1:D1. 
 Figure 11-25.  Five was added to each cell in row 1. 
 
 
 

CHAPTER 11 ■ TRANSFERRING AND DUPLICATING DATA TO OTHER LOCATIONS
396
 You can combine a group or multiple groups while performing an arithmetic operation. 
 If you wanted to add the individual values in row 3 to the individual values in row 1, as shown in 
Figure  11-26 , you would perform the following steps:
 
 1. 
 Select the cell range A3:D3 and then do a copy. 
 
 2. 
 Select cells A1:D1 
 
 3. 
 Right-click one of the selected cells and then select Paste Special. 
 
 4. 
 Select the  Add operation. 
 Figure  11-27  shows the result. 
 If you were copying fewer values than you were pasting, then the copied values would repeat their 
pattern. 
 In Figure  11-28 the value in cell A3 would be added to the value in cell A1. The value in cell B3 would be 
added to the value in B1.  
 Then the value in cell A3 would be added to the value in C1, and the value in B3 would be added to the 
value in D1. 
 Figure  11-29  shows the result.

EXERCISE 11-6: USING THE PASTE SPECIAL ADD OPTION
 The Paste Special option Add can be beneficial when you want to combine groups of values. The  Add 
option adds the values you copied in the  source range with those in the  destination range and then 
replaces the destination range with the new values. 
 In this example, we will combine the values in Groups B and C with Group A. We will then delete the 
rows that contain the Group B and Group C values. 
 1. 
 Open workbook Chapter 11C. Create a new worksheet named “PasteAdd.” 
 2. 
 Create the spreadsheet as shown in Figure  11-30 . 
 3. 
 Select the cell range B2:G2 and do the following:
 a. 
 Press Ctrl + C.

of the Paste button. Select Paste Special. Under Operation select Add. Click OK. 
 5. 
 Select row heads 2 and 3 and then right-click and select Delete from the context 
menu. See Figure  11-31 . 
 The values in Group A are now the sum of the values that were previously in Group A plus Group B plus 
Group C.

 Experiment with the other Operation options. 
 EXERCISE 11-8: USING THE PASTE SPECIAL  SKIP BLANKS OPTION   
 When you copy a range of cells, any cells that are blank in the copied range will overwrite any cells in 
the pasted range, thus making those cells also blank. 
 However, if you use the Skip Blanks option for Paste Special, the blank cells in the copied range will not 
overwrite the data in the cells in the pasted range.
 1.

 Using the  Microsoft Office Clipboard 
 Whenever you do a Copy, the item you copied is placed into the Office Clipboard. The Office Clipboard is a 
temporary storage area to which you can copy as many as 24 items. The items can be text or graphical such as 
charts, images, clip art, shapes, and so on. The clipboard is shared with the other Microsoft Office products. 
This means that you can copy and paste items between Excel, Access, PowerPoint, Word, and so on. The 
clipboard makes it quick and easy to rearrange data in your documents or to merge elements from other office 
products into your documents. Items that are on the clipboard can be pasted individually or all at once. 
 The items stay on the clipboard until you delete them from the clipboard or until you have closed all 
of the Microsoft Office applications. The last item you added to the clipboard remains even after you have 
closed all of the Microsoft Office applications. The last item copied is added to the top of the clipboard. If you 
try to add more than 24 items to the clipboard, the first item you added will be removed. All items are cleared 
when you restart your computer.

 Summary 
 The difference between a move and a copy is that after you have performed a copy, the data will exist in both 
its original location as well as in the pasted location while a move clears the data from its original location 
and stores it in the pasted location. The Paste Special command has much more capability than just pasting 
data into a cell. While it is pasting it can perform calculations at the same time. It has options for copying 
only the cell values without copying the formatting or copying the formatting without the cell values. The 
Transpose option for Paste Special converts row data into column data or column data into row data. The Fill 
Across Worksheets option copies data from one worksheet into multiple worksheets. 
 Whenever you do a copy, the copy is temporarily stored in the Office Clipboard. You can store 24 items 
on the Office Clipboard at a time. This clipboard is shared with other office products so you can easily copy 
and paste between them. 
 In the next chapter you will see how to convert your data into a table. You can apply multiple sorts and 
complex filtering to tables so you can view only the data you want to see and in the order you want to see it.

 CHAPTER 12  
 Working with Tables 
 A table is a structured collection of data consisting of a header row and multiple data rows. A table is used to 
contain data of a single type such as orders, sales, inventory, and so on. A table makes it easier to filter, sort, 
analyze, summarize, and format your data. 
 After reading and working through this chapter you should be able to:
• 
 Create and format a table 
• 
 Sort and filter a table 
• 
 Add to a table 
• 
 Resize a table 
• 
 Add calculated fields to a table 
• 
 Create slicers 
• 
 Apply themes 
• 
 Apply styles 
• 
 Create conditional formatting 
 You can pull data from multiple tables to create another table. Data in a table can be kept separate from 
other data in your worksheet. You can take an existing range of cells and format them into a table. If you no 
longer want the data to be in a table format, you can convert it back to a range. 
 The last part of this chapter covers conditional formatting. Conditional formatting improves the 
readability of your data by allowing you to apply formats or display icons based on cell values. For example, 
you can have cell data in a column appear in bold red if the value is less than 0, blue if the value falls between 
0 and 1000, and green if the value is greater than 1000. You can decide how the data will be formatted and 
create the rules for those formats. 
 Creating and Formatting Tables 
 The process of creating and formatting a table is very simple. Select the data you want to be in a table and 
pick a format you would like it to be in. That’s all there is to it. 
 You format the data you have selected on a worksheet as a table by clicking the Format as Table button. 
The Format as Table button is located on the Home tab in the Styles group. Clicking the Format as Table 
button brings up a gallery of styles for you to select from. See Figure  12-1 . The gallery is divided into the 
categories Light, Medium, and Dark. Some of the styles have colored column headings; some have cell 
borders and others do not; some have a different color for every other row and others do not. If you don’t like 
any of the styles Excel has provided for you then you can create your own style.  

CHAPTER 12 ■ WORKING WITH TABLES
412
 Figure 12-1.  Gallery of styles. Select the one you want to format your table 
 

CHAPTER 12 ■ WORKING WITH TABLES
413
 When you select a style, Excel brings up the  Format as Table dialog box. If you haven’t already selected 
the cells to become a table you can do so at this point. Be sure the  My table has headers check box is 
selected if your selected data contains headers. See Figure  12-2 . 
 Figure 12-2.    Select the cells that you want to become a table. If you are including headings, make sure My 
table has headers is selected 
 Sort and Filter a Table  
 Tables display down arrows to the right of each column header. Clicking one of these down arrows brings up 
sort and filter options for that column as illustrated in Figure  12-3 . 
 Figure 12-3.  Select down arrow to the right of the header to select filters 
 
 

CHAPTER 12 ■ WORKING WITH TABLES
414
 Every unique value that appears in the column is displayed. If there are duplicate values in a column 
they are not repeated in the list. 
 Removing a check mark in front of a value will prevent the row that contains that value from being 
displayed. If you have removed multiple check marks you can quickly reselect all of them by selecting 
(Select All). If you only want to select a couple of items for filtering, you can deselect (Select All) then just 
click the items that you want included in your table. 
 Filtering does not rearrange or alter your data; it temporarily hides rows that don't match the criteria 
you specify. Removing filters restores your table to the way it was before the filters were applied. 
 Columns that have been filtered can easily be identified because the down arrow button changes to a 
filtered button   
 . Excel displays the applied filter when you hover your cursor over the filtered button. 
 Adding to the Excel Table 
 You can add additional records to the table by typing them in the row after the last record in the table. After 
you press the Enter key at the end of the record, it will automatically become part of the table. You can add 
new columns in a similar manner by keying a new column to the right of the last column. You can also 
expand the table to include more rows or columns by dragging the table expansion handle located at the 
bottom right-hand corner of the table  
 . You can then type additional data into the expanded area. You 
can also insert a row or column anywhere in the table. If you insert a new column, the column heading will 
be named Column. Double-click the column heading and change the name to what you want. 
 Automatic expansion of the table can be stopped by performing the following steps:
 
 1. 
 Click File ➤ Options. 
 
 2. 
 Click Proofing in the left pane. 
 
 3. 
 Click the AutoCorrect Options button in the right pane. 
 
 4. 
 Click the  AutoFormat as You Type tab. 
 
 5. 
 Deselect  Include new rows and columns in table Automatically as you work . 
See Figure  12-4 .

 You have learned how to filter data from a table by clicking the down arrow to the right of the column 
head you want to filter and then selecting only the values you want to view. Next, you will learn an alternative 
method of filtering by using a slicer. 
 Filtering Data with a  Slicer  
 Rather than filtering a table by using the filter buttons next to the column heads you can create slicers. 
Slicers don’t provide all of the options that table filter buttons provide, but they do make it visually easier to 
see what has been selected. 
 
EXERCISE 12-2: FILTERING DATA WITH A SLICER
 In this exercise you will create two slicers to filter a table.

 You have learned how to create a table, sort it, filter it, and then convert it back to a range. Next, you will 
learn how to change the appearance of your workbooks by using existing themes and creating new ones. 
You may want to create custom themes to give your documents or your company’s documents a consistent 
appearance. 
 Using  Themes  
 A theme in Excel consists of colors, a heading and body font, and graphic effects applied to a worksheet. 
Themes are located on the Page Layout tab in the Themes group. See Figure  12-24 . You can also create 
your own themes. You can use themes to enhance the look of your spreadsheets as well as to give them a 
consistent look. You could, for instance, apply different themes to different projects, or maybe your company 
elects to always use the same theme. Microsoft Word and PowerPoint have the same themes available as 
those found in Excel.

as shown in Figure  12-29 . 
 18. 
 Click the Office theme. 
 You have seen how to apply formatting through a theme. Next, you will learn how apply styles to cells. 
 Applying and Defining  Cell Styles 
 Cell styles provide a way of improving the look and readability of your spreadsheet. Figure  12-30 shows the 
cell styles. They can be accessed from the Home tab’s Styles group by clicking the Cell Styles button. The Cell 
Styles are divided into five categories:
• 
 Good, Bad, and Neutral 
• 
 Date and Model 
• 
 Titles and Headings 
• 
 Themed Cell Styles 
• 
 Number Format 
 Figure 12-29.  The theme you created appears above the other themes in the Theme Gallery  
 

CHAPTER 12 ■ WORKING WITH TABLES
430
 Styles provide you with an easy way to give a consistent format to certain cells, such as those that 
contain what the company would consider good news and those that contain what the company would 
consider bad news, cells that are used for Input and those that are used for output, those cells that contain 
links, and so on. You can also use Themed Cell Styles, which provide different amounts of transparency 
using the same color. These predefined styles are located at Home ➤ Styles ➤ Cell Styles. Themed Cell Styles 
are derived from the theme you are currently using. If you change your document theme, your themed cell 
styles will be different. You apply styles to your worksheet by first selecting those cells you want to apply the 
style to and then clicking the appropriate style from the Cell Styles gallery. A nice feature of the styles is that 
you can see exactly how a style will affect your spreadsheet before you ever apply it. Move your mouse over 
any style to get a visual preview of how it will affect your spreadsheet. 
 Maybe there is no style in the Cell Style gallery that meets your needs. No problem; just create your own 
style. To do this, click  New Cell Style… at the bottom of the Cell Styles gallery. This brings up the Style dialog 
box where you can assign a name to your new style. 
 Styles can be deleted by displaying the Cell Styles gallery, right-clicking the style, and then pressing the 
Delete key.

 10.  Click the style you created. See Figure  12-32 . 
 You have learned how to apply consistent formatting by using themes and cell styles. Next, you will learn 
how to format based on a condition (e.g., applying a format to all cells in a column that have a value over 500). 
 Conditional Formatting 
 Conditional formatting formats cells based on the values they contain. The formatting is conditional based 
on criteria that you determine. Cells that are of special interest to you can be highlighted. You can apply 
conditional formatting to tables or any range of data. 
 If you have a large amount of data in your spreadsheet it can make those cells of importance stand out, 
or it can give you a quick visual overview about the range of the values in a column. 
 
EXERCISE 12-4: CREATING CONDITIONAL FORMATTING
 In this example you will create formatting based on whether certain conditions are met. You will learn 
how to edit, delete, and create new formatting rules.

 Summary 
 A theme in Excel consists of colors, a heading and body font, and graphic effects applied to a worksheet. You 
can also create your own themes. You can use themes to enhance the look of your spreadsheets as well as to 
give them a consistent look. You could, for instance, apply different themes to different projects, or maybe 
your company elects to always use the same theme. Microsoft Word and PowerPoint have the same themes 
available as those found in Excel. 
 Microsoft Office Themes consists of galleries of colors, heading and body fonts, and graphic effects. 
You can click the various themes and at the same time view how they affect your worksheet. You can select 
the one that is most pleasing to you, or perhaps your company requires a particular theme so that all of its 
documents have a consistent look. If you can’t find a theme that matches your needs, you can create your 
own by making selections from the color, heading and body font, and graphic effect galleries. 
 Rather than manually formatting your cells, you select from groups of predesigned cell styles. The 
groups are Good, Bad, and Neutral; Data and Model; Titles and Headings; and Number Format. Like themes, 
cell styles can give your worksheets a consistent look, such as always giving your headings, titles, and totals 
the same appearance. 
 You can convert the data in your worksheet to a table and then convert it back again to its original 
format. You create a table by selecting the data you want to convert into a table and then clicking the Format 
as Table button located in the Ribbon’s Styles group. Converting data to a table allows you to filter data by 
clicking the drop-down arrow to the right of a column head. You can then either select the values that you 
want to use for your filter or create a custom filter; if the data is text, you can select a Text Filter and if the data 
is Numeric, you can select a Numeric Filter. Another way of filtering table data is to create slicers. Slicers let 
you see exactly what is being filtered without having to look into the table filters. 
 You can format cells with a variety of colors or icons to highlight cells that are of particular interest. For 
example, you could highlight cells whose value is in the top 20% with one icon, a value within the middle 
60% with another icon, and a value in the bottom 20% with yet another icon. 
 The next chapter covers charts. Excel makes it very simple to take your spreadsheet data and turn it into 
a chart. Charts make it easy to find trends in your data that you might not otherwise detect.

 CHAPTER 13  
 Working with Charts 
 Where would we be without charts? Not only are charts more appealing to our eye than raw data, but they 
also make it much simpler for us to spot trends. The old saying “a picture is worth a thousand words” also 
applies to charts. Managers don’t always want to look at every record in a spreadsheet; they would rather 
make their decisions based on trends, whether they be good or bad. By looking at trends, management can 
decide what actions the company should take in the future. Charts can summarize vast amounts of data and 
also show relationships between data. Charts make it easier to see such things as what lines of product are 
more profitable, what the most profitable time of year is, whether the profitability of the company is on the 
rise or going down, what departments are doing well and which are not, and on and on. 
 After reading and working through this chapter you should be able to:
• 
 Use shortcut keys to create charts 
• 
 Change chart types 
• 
 Add a data point 
• 
 Change the data source 
• 
 Create a pie chart 
• 
 Create a pie of a pie chart 
• 
 Crate a pie of a bar chart 
• 
 Create a chart with multiple data chart types (Combination Chart) 
• 
 Create a Treemap chart 
• 
 Create a Sunburst chart 
 Chart Types 
 Excel provides a wide variety of chart types to choose from to best display your data. What type of chart you 
should use depends upon the data you are charting. Before creating a chart you need to decide what it is 
you want the chart to say. Once you have a chart selected you can change the format of the entire chart by 
changing its theme, or you can change the individual components of the chart. Excel provides a wide variety 
of different chart options. As you will see later, Excel looks at the data you have selected, makes a  quick 
analysis of it, and then provides  recommended chart types for your data. 
 The  Ribbon’s Insert tab in the Charts group displays the available chart types. Clicking a down arrow 
next to one of the chart types will display available variations of that chart type. See Figure  13-1 . 

CHAPTER 13 ■ WORKING WITH CHARTS
446
 Clicking the Charts group dialog box launcher as shown in Figure  13-2  brings up the Insert Chart dialog 
box (Figure  13-3 ). 
 The  Insert Chart dialog box has two tabs. The Recommended Charts tab displays the Recommended 
Charts for the data you currently have selected in your worksheet. See Figure  13-3 . The charts displayed here 
are using the data that you have selected. Clicking a chart type gives a description of what that chart type can 
be used for. 
 Figure 13-1.  Variations of the pie  chart 
 Figure 13-2.  Charts group 
 
 

CHAPTER 13 ■ WORKING WITH CHARTS
447
 The Recommended Charts are just a suggestion. You don’t have to use Excel’s suggestion. The All 
Charts tab shows all of the chart types in the left pane. Clicking a chart type in the left pane will display all of 
the variations of that type in the right pane. See Figure  13-4 . The charts displayed here are using the data you 
currently have selected on your worksheet. In the left pane there is an option to view your most recent chart.   
 Figure 13-3.  Insert Chart dialog box with Recommended Charts tab selected 
 

CHAPTER 13 ■ WORKING WITH CHARTS
448
 Creating and Modifying Charts 
 There are several ways to create a chart, including using the options on the Insert tab shown in the preceding 
section. The easiest way to create a default  2D Clustered bar chart   is by selecting the data you want to display 
in your chart and then
• 
 Pressing the Alt + F1 key if you want to display the chart on the same worksheet as 
the data, or 
• 
 Pressing F11 if you want the chart to appear on a separate worksheet.    
 Once you have created your chart you can change it in so many ways. Some of the changes you can 
make are the following: the type of the chart, its location, its style, what is displayed in the chart, reversing the 
columns and rows, adding or removing items from the chart, changing the color and appearance of individual 
bars, and adding or removing legends, titles, data tables, the incremented value on the plot area, and so on. 
 Selecting the chart adds two contextual tabs to the Ribbon. The contextual tabs Design and Format 
appear under the heading Chart Tools. The Design tab is mostly used for making changes that affect the 
entire chart while the Layout tab is used for changing the look of individual elements in the chart. 
 
■ Note  Don’t get carried away with trying to make your charts too fancy and overdoing colors, and so on. The 
most important thing is how well your chart conveys the information that you want it to and how easy it is for the 
intended audience to read and understand. The audience should be able quickly grasp what the chart is conveying.

EXERCISE 13-1: CREATING AND MODIFYING EXCEL CHARTS
 In this exercise you will create and modify column and bar charts from existing Game Sales data.
 1. 
 Open workbook Chapter   13  . Click the  Game Sales tab . Figure  13-5 shows the data. 
 2. 
 Select the cell range A2:G7. Press Alt + F1. 
 Your chart is in a moveable frame. Move your cursor on the chart frame. Your cursor 
should display as four arrows  
 . 
 3. 
 Drag and drop the chart to whatever location you want. 
 4. 
 Increase the  size of the chart by placing your cursor on the bottom right of the 
chart frame and then hold down the Shift key while you drag the cursor toward the 
bottom right. Holding down the Shift key makes the chart retain the same width-to-
length ratio. 
 When a chart is selected, Excel displays two new tabs on the ribbon: Design and 
Format. The two tabs are under the Chart Tools grouping. 
 
■ Note A chart consists of many different individual elements. What the elements are depends upon the type 
of chart and the data being charted. 
 On the Ribbon, click the Format tab. In the Current Selection group, the Chart 
Elements drop-down box displays the current item selected in the chart. 
 5. 
 Click the down arrow of the  Chart Elements drop-down box . See Figure  13-6 .

 Applying Chart Styles 
 1. 
 On the Ribbon under the Chart Tools grouping there is a Design tab and a Format 
Tab. Click the Design Tab. 
 Excel has a series of predefined styles that you can select from. The style buttons 
reflect the type of the current chart. Since we are using a bar chart, the style 
buttons display styles for bar charts. See Figure  13-16 . While working on a pie 
chart, the style buttons would display pie charts. 
 2. 
 In the Chart Layouts group click the More button (Show All). See Figure  13-17 . 
 The number of available predefined layouts varies for the different types of charts. 
 3. 
 Move your mouse over the style buttons while noticing how it changes your chart. A 
tool tip displays the name assigned to each button such as Style 1, Style 2, and so on.  
 4. 
 Click the  Style 6 button. This style adds the individual values to each bar. 
 When the chart is selected you will see three buttons to the right of it. See 
Figure  13-18 . 
 If you click anywhere off the chart these three buttons will not display. 
 Figure 13-18.    These three buttons display to tye right of the chart when it is selected

form. These are the same values that are being displayed by the Data Labels above 
the column. Eliminate the Data Labels by removing the check mark in front of it. 
 Changing   the Chart Style 
 1. 
 Click the Chart Styles button. What appears here depends upon what you have 
in your current chart. Since we currently have a data table in our chart, all of the 
charts being presented here have a Data Table. 
 2. 
 Move your cursor over each of the charts as you scroll through them to see how 
each option will affect your chart. These are the same styles that appear on the 
Ribbon’s Data Tab in the Chart Styles group.

 The Select Data Source dialog box provides you with an option for changing the 
range of cells that the chart is based on. There is also a button here for switching 
the rows and columns just as you did in the previous step. 
 There is an up and down arrow to the right of the Remove button. These buttons as 
shown in Figure  13-27 are for moving the current legend up or down along with its 
 series . 
 Originally, we had a column chart and the Risk game was represented by the first 
column in each month’s group. When we changed to a bar chart, the series was 
reversed and the Risk game became the last bar in each month’s group. It seems 
strange but in the Select Data Source dialog box Risk is at the top even though it 
appears at the bottom of a bar chart. 
 9. 
 With Risk selected, keep clicking the down arrow shown in Figure  13-22 until Risk 
becomes the last item in the series.

 Changing a Series Color  
 The  series color for Risk and Monopoly are very close and it is hard to distinguish one from another. We 
will change the color of the Risk series to red.
 1. 
 On the Ribbon’s Format tab, in the Current Selection group, click the down arrow for 
Chart Elements and then select Series “Risk.” 
 2. 
 In the Current Selection group, click the Format Selection button. 
 3. 
 In the Format Data Series pane click the Fill & Line button   
 . You can make a bar 
color a solid color, a gradient, or fill it with a pattern or a picture. 
 4. 
 Select Solid Color. 
 5. 
 Select the red color from the color picker button. See Figure  13-30 . 
 You have learned how to create column and bar charts. Column and bar charts work well for multiple 
columns of numeric data. Next you will learn how to create pie charts. Pie charts should only use a single 
column of numeric data. 
 Figure 13-30.  The bars representing Risk have been changed to the color red 
 

CHAPTER 13 ■ WORKING WITH CHARTS

 Pie Charts 
 Pie charts are used to show percentages. The entire circle represents 100%. Each item in a data series is 
represented by a slice of the pie. The size of each slice shows what part of the 100% it represents. Sometimes 
you may find that the information in one slice needs to be broken out into percentages itself. You can use the 
pie of pie subtype in such circumstances. In this section we’ll first look at the standard pie chart and then 
cover the pie of pie subtype. 
 The Standard Pie Chart 
 In Figure  13-31 we have ten pieces of fruit. The entire pie represents 100% of our fruit. There are five bananas 
so they represent 5/10 or 50% of our fruit. Therefore, the bananas represent one-half of our pie. The slice for 
Apples takes up 30% of the size of our pie. 
 
EXERCISE 13-2: CREATING A PIE CHART
 In this exercise you will  create a pie chart from Dave’s Lunch Wagon data. A pie chart works well with 
this data because there is only one column of label data and only one column of numeric data.
 1. 
 Open workbook Chapter   13  . Select the worksheet named Pie. 
 2. 
 Select cells A2:B6. Click the  Quick Analysis button at the bottom right of the data. 
See Figure  13-32 .

 3. 
 Click Charts. 
 Excel recommends that you use a clustered column chart, a pie chart, or a 
clustered bar chart for the data you have selected. If you were to click the Clustered 
Column button, Excel would create a clustered column chart using the selected 
data on the current worksheet.

 Pie of Pie Subtype 
 A pie of pie chart takes a slice of a pie chart and then breaks that slice into another pie chart. One reason 
for doing this is that your pie chart contains too many items and some of the pie slices are so small that you 
can’t tell what they are. Another reason might be that one of the pie slices is a category that you want further 
broken down. 
 Annette owns a soup and sandwich shop. She wants to see the breakdown of her drink category. She 
wants to see what types of drinks customers purchased this month. This can be done by pulling the drink 
category piece of the pie away from the others. This is called exploding the pie. You can explode the entire 
pie or individual slices. 
 
EXERCISE 13-3: CREATING PIE SUBTYPES
 In this exercise you will be creating a pie chart for a sandwich shop to show what percent of sales are 
represented by sandwiches, soup, ice cream, and drinks. The shop decided that it would also like to see 
a break out of its drink sales to see what percentage of its drink sales is represented by Pepsi, Coke, 
7Up, and Sprite. You will create a pie of pie chart to display each of the different types of drinks and then 
you will represent the same drink data with a bar of pie chart

CHAPTER 13 ■ WORKING WITH CHARTS

 You have learned how to create pie charts and even learned how to break down a slice of the pie chart 
into another pie chart or a bar chart. Next, you will learn how to combine two chart types into a single chart 
called a Combination Chart. 
 Combination Chart 
 A  combination chart combines more than one chart type in a single chart. The most common combination 
chart consists of a bar chart for one series and a line chart for another series. Figure  13-52 shows a 
combination where the sales data and predicted sales data are shown on the same chart. The sales data is 
displayed in a column format and the predicted sales data in a line format. This makes it easy to see which 
predicted sales were higher and which predicted sales were lower than the actual sales. Another reason for 
creating a combination occurs when there is a large disparity between the values in the different series.  
 
EXERCISE 13-4: CREATING A COMBINATION CHART
 In this example you will create a combination chart consisting of a column and a line chart. Looking at 
Figure  13-53 you can see that there is a large disparity in the values between the two columns. As you 
will see this disparity prevents us from creating an accurate column chart.  
 1. 
 Open workbook Chapter   13  . Select the worksheet named Combination. Figure  13-53  
shows the data.

 Hierarchical Charts 
 Sometimes you will want to show the  hierarchical relationships among data. In this section, we’ll look at two 
common types of hierarchical charts: the Treemap and Sunburst chart types. 
 Treemap Chart 
 A Treemap is used for representing hierarchical data. The chart consists of rectangles whose size represents 
the value associated with a label. Figure  13-59 shows a Treemap chart. 
 
EXERICISE 13-5: CREATING A TREEMAP CHART
 In this exercise you will create a Treemap chart using the data in Figure  13-58 . Since the largest value 
in the spreadsheet is 1000, this item will be represented by the largest rectangle. The rectangles 
representing the products will be organized within the states. 
 1. 
 Open workbook Chapter   13  . Select the worksheet named Treemap. 
 Our company sells snack products to gas stations in five states. Figure  13-58 
shows our profit for the past week. 
 A Treemap chart will give us a quick view of the distribution of our profit for the 
various products across the five states. 
 
■ Note The headings don’t need to be selected when creating the chart. 
 2. 
 Select the range A2:C12. On the Ribbon’s Insert tab click the  See all Charts button 
in the bottom right corner of the Charts group. 
 3. 
 Select the All Charts tab and then select Treemap in the left pane. Click the OK 
button. See Figure  13-59 . The largest rectangle represents the largest value. 
 Figure 13-58.  Data in the worksheet named Treemap 
 

CHAPTER 13 ■ WORKING WITH CHARTS
482
 It’s usually easier to read a Treemap chart if you turn the headings (the state names 
in this case) to banners. 
 4. 
 Right-click any one of the rectangles on the chart and then select  Format Data 
Series . Select  Banner from the Label Options. See Figure  13-60 . 
 Figure  13-61 shows the result. 
 Figure 13-60.  Select  Banner from the Label Options

CHAPTER 13 ■ WORKING WITH CHARTS
483
 It’s easier to see the state headings now. Since the Michigan Items are in gray, they 
blend in with the state headings and are hard to read. 
 5. 
 Change colors of the  rectangles :
 
 a.  Click the Ribbon’s Design tab. In the Chart Styles group click the Change Colors 
button. 
 
 b.  Move your cursor over the different color palettes to see how they affect your 
chart. We want one that doesn’t have a gray color. Select the third row in the 
 Colorful group . See Figure  13-62 . 
 You might want to see the values along with the labels. 
 5. 
 Click the Chart frame. Click the down arrow for Chart Options and then  select Data 
Labels . See Figure  13-63 .

 This adds another option button, Label Options. See Figure  13-64 . 
 6. 
 Click the Label Options button. Expand Label Options so that you can see the 
options as shown in Figure  13-65 . 
 7. 
 Select  Value . Select  New Line from the Separator drop-down box. Selecting New 
Line places the label and the  value on two separate lines as shown in Figure  13-66 .

 The white text can be hard to read:
 
 a.  Click one of the labels in the chart. 
 
 b.  Click the Ribbon’s Format tab. 
 
 c.  In the WordArt Styles group click the down arrow for Text Fill and then select 
the black color.

 With the labels still selected press Ctrl + B to bold the text. 
 10. 
 Click Chart Title. Drag across it to select it. Type  Sales by State. 
 If you triple-click a legend item or one of the rectangles, then all the rectangles not 
related to that item will be dimmed. In Figure  13-67 the legend item Michigan was 
triple-clicked. Once a group is selected you can single-click an individual rectangle 
to select it. 
 Figure 13-66.    The  labels and values   should be on two separate lines

 11. 
 Triple- click the cookies rectangle under Michigan and then click donuts under 
Michigan. All rectangles should be dimmed except the Michigan donuts. Click an 
empty cell to undim the rectangles. 
 When a group of rectangles or an individual rectangle is selected you can change 
its background to a different color, gradient, picture, or texture. Figure  13-68 shows 
that a texture was selected for the Michigan group of rectangles. You can also apply 
various effects and alter its borders by clicking the Ribbon’s Format tab and then 
selecting one of the options from the Shapes Styles group.

click the Fill & Line button (the paint bucket). 
 13.  Select  Picture or texture fill . 
 14.  Click the drop-down box for  Texture shown in Figure  13-69 . Select whatever 
texture you want to use. 
 Figure 13-69.  Select a  texture 
 15.  Try changing the color or texture of individual rectangles. 
 If not all of your data values are showing you may need to expand the size of the chart. 
 Sunburst Chart 
 Like the Treemap chart the Sunburst chart is also a hierarchical chart. Instead of using the rectangle sizes to 
represent a value, it uses the size of pie pieces. 
 An  advantage of the Sunburst chart over the Treemap chart is that it can represent more columns of 
labels. In the example for the Treemap chart the first column (State) was used for the headings and the next 
column (Product) was used to represent the individual rectangles. If we wanted to break things down farther 
by going State, then Counties, and then Products within those counties, the Counties wouldn’t display in the 
Treemap chart but they would in a Sunburst chart. 
 Using the same data, we used for the Treemap chart and selecting the same options, let’s look at the 
result for the Sunburst chart in Figure  13-70 . 
 

CHAPTER 13 ■ WORKING WITH CHARTS
488
 The Sunburst chart clearly shows that Indiana is our most profitable state. It’s easy to see from the chart 
that donuts are the most profitable item we sell in Indiana. 
 The pie slice for muffins in Michigan isn’t large enough to display the label and the value. If we remove 
the  values the label for the muffins becomes visible. See Figure  13-71 . 
 Figure 13-70.  Sunburst chart 
 

CHAPTER 13 ■ WORKING WITH CHARTS

 The label for the muffins profit in Michigan is now visible. See Figure  13-72 . If you want to know the 
value associated with each  slice just move your cursor over one of the items. 
 Figure 13-71.  Removing the  values gives more room for the labels to display 
 Figure 13-72.    Move your cursor over a slice to see the associated value

 The Sunburst chart makes it easy to see that we sell the most items in the North 
region and that Indiana and Michigan are the biggest selling states. 
 What if we wanted the chart to display the pie slices based on the Gross column?  
 3. 
 Delete the Sunburst chart. 
 4. 
 Select the cell range A2:C15, hold down the Ctrl key and select the cell range 
F2:F15. Let’s apply a cell style to the range so that we can easily identify which 
columns are being used for the chart.

 We sell our product in New York City in a very upscale area at a higher price, which 
makes our New York pie slice much larger than it was for the number of dozens 
sold. 
 9. 
 Change the chart to a more 3D- looking chart by selecting the chart and then, from 
the Ribbon’s Design tab, selecting the last chart choice from the Chart Styles group. 
See Figure  13-78 .

CHAPTER 13 ■ WORKING WITH CHARTS
495
 Just like with the Treemap chart you can select a group of pie slices by triple-clicking one of the slices 
or a legend item. You can then select an individual  slice by clicking one of the slices in the selected 
group. See Figure  13-79 . 
 You have learned how to create the Treemap and Sunburst hierarchical charts. Hierarchical charts work 
well for data where natural groupings exist and the data is organized in some level of order. Next, you will 
learn how to create charts that represent a row of data and are stored in a single cell.   
 Sparklines 
 Sparklines are small charts displayed in individual cells. They are used for highlighting trends within a 
single row or single column. There are three types of sparklines: Line, Column, and Win/Loss. Sparklines are 
created by first selecting the cells where you want the sparklines to be located and then selecting the type of 
sparkline you want to create. The Sparklines group is located on the Insert tab. There are three buttons in the 
group: Line, Column, and Win/Loss. See Figure  13-80 . 
 Figure 13-79.  Sunburst chart with North  selected 
 

CHAPTER 13 ■ WORKING WITH CHARTS
496
 Because the Sparklines are so small, if there isn’t a wide variance in your values, the column charts 
may appear disproportionate in size compared to the actual values. It is much easier to see the trends if you 
enlarge the cell that contains the Sparklines. 
 Column sparklines that are negative are displayed in the bottom half of the cell. Zero values are not 
given a sparkline; instead, a space is placed in that position. See Figure  13-81 . 
 Win/Loss sparklines show whether your data is positive (win) or negative (loss). See Figure  13-82 . 
 
EXERCISE 13-7: CREATING SPARKLINES
 In this exercise you will  create sparklines for the row data in Figure  13-84 . You will group and ungroup 
the sparklines so that you can format some of your sparklines one way and some of them another way
 1. 
 Open the Chapter   13  workbook. Select the worksheet named Sparklines. Figure  13-83  
shows the data.

 Summary 
 Charts provide a quick way of viewing lots of data. They make it easy to see if you are meeting your goals 
and to spot problems. What chart you use depends upon the data that you want to represent. You have seen 
that column and bar charts can be used for many rows of numeric data while a pie chart would represent 
only one row of numeric data. The Treemap and Sunburst charts work well for representing hierarchal data. 
Sparklines are stored in an individual cell and represent a row of data. If you are using Sparklines, you will 
want to make the cell large enough so that you can easily see what the chart is displaying. 
 Pie charts represent data in pie slices. The pie slices represent a percent of the entire pie. The Treemap 
chart uses rectangles to represent values while a Sunburst chart represents values with pie pieces. Sparklines 
can use one of three chart types: Line, Column, or Win/Loss. A pie chart slice can be broken down into 
another pie or bar chart so that you can you see all of the items that were used to create it. 
 A Combination chart combines two charts into one. It usually consists of a bar chart for one series and a 
line chart for another. 
 The fastest way to create a 2D clustered bar chart is to use the following shortcut keys:
• 
 Press the Alt + F1 key if you want to display the chart on the same worksheet as the 
data, or 
• 
 Press F11 if you want the chart to appear on a separate worksheet. 
 The next chapter details how to import data from various sources.

 CHAPTER 14  
 Importing Data 
 Excel is the premier analysis tool. This is the reason for bringing data from other sources into Excel. 
Microsoft has added even more sources and ways of importing data for Excel 2016. 
 After reading and working through this chapter you should be able to
• 
 Import delimited text and fixed-width text files  
• 
 Import data from an Access database 
• 
 Import data as is from a web page and modify and transform it before importing it 
• 
 Create connections between a workbook and a data source 
 Importing Data into Excel 
 Excel’s Ribbon has two groups of buttons for bringing data into Excel. See Figure  14-1 . The first group, Get 
External Data, is strictly for bringing data into a spreadsheet. The second group, Get & Transform, gives you 
the opportunity to make modifications to the data before bringing it in. 
 Figure 14-1.  Get External Data group and Get & Transform groups 
 Excel can import data from a wide variety of sources. The buttons in the Get External Data group lets 
you import data from text files, an Access database, the Web, XML files, SQL server, and so on. It can even 
connect to other programs using an ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) driver. The different file types do 
not all have the same capabilities in Excel. Some options work with some data types and not with others.  
 

CHAPTER 14 ■ IMPORTING DATA
504
 Importing Text Files 
 Text files do not contain any formatting. This makes it easy for different programs to exchange text file data. 
There are two types of text files: delimited and fixed-width. The data in a file is usually divided into fields. 
Delimited files have fields that have variable lengths. All values in a fixed-width field are the same length. 
Spaces are used to make the length of text fields the same size; numeric fields can be padded with zeroes to 
make them the same length. 
 Delimited  Text Files 
 Fields in text files are usually separated by commas but they can also be separated by tabs, spaces, or any 
other character. The character used to separate the fields is called the delimiter. A text file that has its fields 
separated by commas is called a  comma-delimited text file . Most text files have an extension of  .txt . Excel 
spreadsheets can be saved as text files with an extension of  .csv . The extension stands for comma separated 
values. 
 Following is the content from a comma-delimited file. The file has headings in the first row. Not all text 
files contain a  header row . 
 EmployeeID,DeptID,LastName,FirstName,MidInitial 
 A3251,05,Carson,Annette,F 
 A3291,04,Sterk,Carrie,M 
 A1450,04,Uhrhammer,Dorothy,L 
 A1425,05,Carson,Dick,J 
 
EXERCISE 14-1: IMPORTING A COMMA-DELIMITED TEXT FILE
 In this exercise you will import data from a delimited text file into a worksheet. You will create two 
connections to the text file. One connection will automatically refresh the worksheet with any updated 
data from the text file when the file is open and the other connection will not. You will also learn to 
import just the data that you want to be imported.
 1. 
 Create a new blank workbook named “ImportingData.” 
 2. 
 Click the Ribbon’s Data tab. In the Get External Data group click  From Text . 
 3. 
 This brings up the Import Text File window where you browse until you find the file. 
Select the  Employee.txt file and then select the Import button. 
 4. 
 This brings up the  Text Import Wizard – Step 1 of 3 window. See Figure  14-2 . 
Since this file is a comma-delimited file you need to make sure Delimited is 
selected. The file has headers so select  My Data has headers .

 7. 
 Click the Next button. 
 The  Text Import Wizard  – Step 3 of 3 window opens. See Figure  14-4 . This 
window has options for selecting the data format for each field as well as for 
preventing fields you select from being imported into your worksheet. We don’t 
want to import the DeptID field and the MidInitial fields. 
 8. 
 Click anywhere within the DeptID column and then select  Do not import column 
(skip) . 
 9. 
 Click anywhere within the MidInitial column and then select  Do not import column 
(skip) . 
 The headings above the fields you selected not to import changed from General to 
Skip Column.

 Leave the location as cell A1. Click the Properties button. 
 Creating a Connection to the   External Data  
 The External Data Range Properties dialog box opens. See Figure  14-6 . One of the changes you can 
make in this window is how often or when the file is updated. For example, you could set the Refresh 
control to refresh every ten minutes. You could then make a change to the data in the  Employee.
txt file, wait ten minutes, and then see the changes displayed in the worksheet, or you could set it to 
refresh when you reopen the workbook.

 Figure  14-12 shows that the EmployeeID in cell A2 has been changed to the same 
value you updated it to in the  Employee.txt file. The value in cell D8 kept the 
original value. The reason this occurred was because in the first connection we 
selected the property for  Refresh data when opening the file .

 You have learned how to import delimited files. The fields can be delimited by commas, semicolons, 
and so on. There doesn’t need to be spaces between fields in a delimited file. Next you will learn how to 
import fixed-width text files. In a fixed-width text file, there is no delimiter. The fields are separated by 
spaces. 
     Fixed-Width  Text Files   
 In a fixed-width text file all fields take up the same amount of space. Headings aren’t usually used because 
they would rarely line up with the data.

database. 
 Importing Data from an Access Database 
 Microsoft Access is a part of the Microsoft Office suite. An Access database can contain multiple linked 
tables and queries. A query contains only the fields from a table that you requested. The records it contains 
are limited to any filters you placed on it. You can import data from tables and queries that you have created 
in Access.

wish. See Figure  14-30 . 
 
 

CHAPTER 14 ■ IMPORTING DATA
527
 You have learned how you can import data directly into Excel from tables you find on the Internet. Next, 
you will learn how to use Excel’s new  Query feature. This feature lets you select only the fields and data that 
you want to import. You can even add your own calculated fields. 
 Importing Data Using a Query 
 Excel’s new  Query feature can bring in data from many sources and it has the ability to do a great deal of 
modification to your data. Among the sources from which you can import data are web pages and databases. 
Excel enables you to import data from a variety of database types by default. You can use any data source 
that is available from the New Query button on the Ribbon’s Data tab. 
 
■ Note   You also can import data from other sources, such as various database management systems 
(DBMSs) via the ODBC standard. You can get ODBC and other data source drivers from third parties. 
 In this section, you will import data from a web page using a query from the Get & Transform group. 
 
EXERCISE 14-5: IMPORTING DATA USING A QUERY
 In this exercise you will choose which fields you want to import. You will filter the data, create a 
calculated column, merge the queried data and change the order of the columns.
 1. 
 Add a new worksheet to the Importing Data workbook you created in Exercise 14-1. 
 2. 
 Click the Ribbon’s Data tab. In the  Get & Transform group , click the  New Query 
button. 
 3. 
 Click  From Other Sources and then select  From Web . The New Web Query 
window opens.

 Summary  
 Data can be imported into Excel from many different data sources. Once the data is imported, it can take 
advantage of Excel’s wonderful analysis features. 
 Excel has two separate groups of command buttons for bringing data into Excel. The two groups are Get 
External Data and Get & Transform. The Get External Data group buttons bring data into a spreadsheet as is. 
The Get & Transform group lets you make modifications to the data before it is brought into your worksheet. 
 There are many different file types such as text files, Access files, Microsoft query files, and so on. 
Different file types can use different Excel options. 
 Text files are files that contain no formatting, which makes it easy to import. They can be delimited 
or fixed-width. The fields in a text-delimited file are separated by some character such as a comma or 
semicolon. All fields have the same length in a fixed-width text file. Spaces are added to fields to make them 
the same length. 
 The next chapter covers Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts. A pivot table has much more capability than a 
regular Excel table. Data can be dragged into an area if you want it to be rows, and another area if you want 
it to be columns, another area if you want it to be summarized. Pivot Charts have the advantage over normal 
Excel charts because they can be filtered. A user can select which items he or she wants to appear in the 
Pivot Chart.

 CHAPTER 15  
 Using PivotTables and PivotCharts  
 Few people use PivotTables but they are missing out on probably the strongest component in Excel. It 
takes a little time to learn, but once you have conquered it, you will become an Excel power user capable of 
grouping and summarizing data in almost any form you can think of. Your boss will be amazed at what you 
can produce. If you are the boss, you will be even more amazed at yourself. PivotTables can create the types 
of reports managers want to see: those that don’t contain every detail but rather contain only the data they 
want to see when they want to see it.
 After reading and working through this chapter you should be able to
• 
 Create a PivotTable 
• 
 Create a PivotChart from a data source 
• 
 Create a PivotChart from a PivotTable 
• 
 Rearrange and filter PivotTables 
• 
 Create multiple PivotTables from the data source  
• 
 Clear, move, and delete PivotTables 
• 
 Use the slicer tool 
• 
 Use the time interval tool 
• 
 Filter the data 
• 
 Create a relational database 
 Working with PivotTables 
 It’s called a PivotTable because you can pivot your data, switching between rows and columns. You 
can dynamically rearrange your existing data into an almost endless variety of different views. You can 
rapidly create these views by dragging and dropping fields to different locations. Excel then automatically 
recalculates the results to match the view you created. 
 You can create a PivotTable from a named table or from a range of data that has not been declared as a 
table. The  benefit  of creating a PivotTable from a named table is that you can take advantage of table features 
such as automatically extending the table when adding rows of data. 
 Excel analyzes your data and then displays “Recommended” PivotTables from which you can select the 
PivotTable that matches your needs. We will look at this feature later, but in our first practice we will start 
with a simple example in which we will create a PivotTable manually.

 The Work & Leisure  Company is a chain of four stores located in different areas of the country. It 
sells sports products, outdoor furniture, and tools. The spreadsheet in Figure  15-1 shows the products the 
companies sell under those categories and the number of units sold of that product during the previous month.   
 Figure 15-1.  Data to be used in PivotTable 
 
EXERCISE 15-1: MANUALLY CREATE A PIVOTTABLE
 In this exercise you will create a PivotTable. You will practice rearranging the column and row data, 
adding and removing fields, changing the order of the data, looking at different ways of summarizing 
the data, filtering the data, and changing the data source location.
 1. 
 Open the workbook  Chapter15_PivotTables . 
 2. 
 Select the worksheet named PivotTable1. 
 3. 
 Click anywhere within the data. Click the Ribbon’s Insert tab. In the Tables group 
click the PivotTable button. 
 4. 
 The Create PivotTable  dialog box displays with a range already selected. The range 
should consist of cells $A$2:$D$18. See Figure  15-2 . If this isn’t the range showing 
in the text box, then change it. 
   5. 
 Change the location of the PivotTable report to   Existing Worksheet .

 6. 
 Enter F2 in the Location text box. 
 7. 
 Click the OK button.
 Figure 15-2.    Select Existing Worksheet  
 8. 
 The PivotTable  Fields list consists of five separate areas:
• 
 A Fields area which lists all of the column names in the table along with a check 
box next to each column name  
• 
 Filters  area 
• 
 Columns area 
• 
 Rows area 
• 
 Values area 
 9. 
 Click the check box for the Store field. See Figure  15-3 . The store field contains text 
data. Columns that contain text are placed in the Rows area by default.   
 10.  Click the check box for Unit Sales. The Unit Sales field contains numeric data. 
Columns that contain numeric data are placed in the Values area by default.

 The PivotTable now shows each store in its own row and it has summed all the 
Sales for each one of those stores. It also displays a grand total that consists of all 
Sales from all the stores. 
 
■ Note You may need to use the Zoom tool on the status bar to view all of the spreadsheet and PivotTable at 
the same time while doing this practice. 
 11.  In the PivotTable Fields list, click the check box next to Category. 
 Category goes to the Rows area by default because it contains text. The categories 
appear as rows under their respective stores in the PivotTable. Even though the 
categories are not in order in the table you are using, they are placed in their proper 
order in the PivotTable. The PivotTable now shows the total sales for each store, the 
sales for each category, and a grand total. 
 Hiding and Unhiding the PivotTable Field   Lists  
 The PivotTable Fields list only displays when you select a cell in the PivotTable. Select a cell anywhere 
outside the PivotTable and the pane disappears.
 1. 
 Click cell A2. The pane disappears. 
 2. 
 Click cell F2. The pane reappears. 
 Collapsing and Expanding   Groupings 
 Notice that there are minus signs to the left of each Store. These allow you to collapse what appears 
underneath a store.
 1. 
 Click the minus sign to the left of Store 2. 
 The minus sign turns into a plus sign. See Figure  15-4   
 Figure 15-4.    The plus and minus signs can be used to collapse and expand the categories 

CHAPTER 15 ■ USING PIVOTTABLES AND PIVOTCHARTS
546
 2. 
 Click the plus sign to expand the details for Store 2. 
 Viewing Field Values   
 You can view all of the different values in a field (column) by moving your mouse over a field in the 
PivotTable Fields list and then clicking the down arrow.
 1. 
 Move your mouse over the Store field in the PivotTable Fields list. Click the down 
arrow to the right of Store. See Figure  15-5 . This displays all of the different values 
in the Store field. See Figure  15-6 .     
 2. 
 Click the Cancel button. 
 Figure 15-5.  Click the down arrow to the right of Store 
 Figure 15-6.    All of the different values in the Store field are displayed 

CHAPTER 15 ■ USING PIVOTTABLES AND PIVOTCHARTS

 Filtering the    Data 
 1. 
 Move your mouse cursor over the word  Product in the Field List. Click the down 
arrow to the right of Product. A list of all the products in the table is displayed. 
 2. 
 Click the check boxes next to bats and bikes to remove their check marks. 
 3. 
 Click the OK button. 
 A filter icon appears on the line (Figure  15-7 ) to inform you that if you use this field, 
not all the items will be displayed.   
 Because the Product field hasn’t been placed in the PivotTable, performing a filter 
has no effect on what is currently displayed in the PivotTable. 
 4. 
 Click the check box next to Product in the PivotTable Fields list. The Products 
appear under their prospective categories in the PivotTable. Widen the columns if 
you need to. Notice that there are no bats or bikes. 
 A Filter button appears next to the Row Labels heading in the PivotTable. See 
Figure  15-8 .   
 5. 
 Move your mouse over the Filter button. A message appears informing you that you 
have manually applied a filter to the PivotTable based on the Product field.  
 6. 
 Click the Filter button. 
 7. 
 Click the down arrow for the Select field and then select Product. See Figure  15-9 .   
 Figure 15-7.  The filter icon to the right of a field informs you that the field has been filtered so not all the items 
for that field will be displayed 
 Figure 15-8.  A filter button appears next to the Row Labels heading 

CHAPTER 15 ■ USING PIVOTTABLES AND PIVOTCHARTS

 8. 
 Click  Clear Filter from “Product.” This adds the bats and bikes values to the 
PivotTable. 
 9. 
 Click Lounge Chairs under Outdoor Furn in the PivotTable. 
 10.  Click the down arrow to the right of the Row Labels column heading. See 
Figure  15-10 .   
 11.  Since you have a product currently selected, all of the available products are listed. 
Click the Cancel button. 
 12.  Click Outdoor Furn in the PivotTable under Store 1. 
 13.  Click the down arrow to the right of the column heading  Row Labels . Since you 
have a category selected, all of the available categories are listed. Click the Cancel 
button. 
 14.  Click Store 1. Click the down arrow to the right of the column heading  Row Labels . 
Since you have a store selected all of the available stores are listed. We only want 
to display the sales for Store 2. 
 15.  Click the check marks next to all of the stores except for Store 2 to remove them. 
Click the OK button. The down arrow to the right of Row Labels changes to a filter 
icon. 
 16.  Bring back all of the stores by clicking the filter icon next to Row Labels. Click the 
check box for Select All. (You could have accomplished the same thing by clicking 
 Clear Filter from “Store” ). Click the OK button.

 17.  There may be a large blank area in the PivotTable Fields list between the fields and 
the drop areas. This area could prevent you from seeing all of the fields in the drop 
areas. Move your cursor on the dotted line just above the text “Drag fields between 
areas below:”. When the cursor changes to a double-headed arrow move the 
mouse cursor up to remove some of the space. See Figure  15-11 .   
 Changing the   Field Order  
 The order in which fields are placed in the Rows drop area in the PivotTable Field List affects the order 
in which they are displayed in the PivotTable. Therefore, you need to be careful about the order in which 
you drop items into the drop area.
 1. 
 In the Rows area drag Product above Category. See Figure  15-12 .   
 2. 
 Look at the PivotTable. Sports now falls under bats and Outdoor Furniture falls 
under Lounge Chairs. This is incorrect. 
 3. 
 Drag Category from the Rows area into the Columns area. The categories are now 
displayed in the PivotTable as columns rather than rows. Notice how the PivotTable 
automatically adjusted the totals. 
 4. 
 Click the down arrow to the right of Column Labels in the PivotTable. See Figure  15-13 .   
 Figure 15-11.  Remove space between PivotTable Fields list and the drop areas

 Figure 15-13.  Click the down arrow to the right of Column Labels 
 5. 
 Here you can filter which columns you want to display. Click the check box next 
to Tools to remove it. Click the OK button. The down arrow to the right of Column 
Labels changes to a filter icon. 
 Removing a Field from the   PivotTable  
 Removing a field from one of the drop areas of the PivotTable Fields list removes that field from the 
PivotTable.
 1. 
 Drag the Category field from the Columns drop area to the spreadsheet. 
 2. 
 As you are dragging the field over the spreadsheet, an X displays under the field 
name. See Figure  15-14 . Stop dragging at this point.   
 Figure 15-14.  As you are dragging the field over the spreadsheet, an X displays under the field name 
 The Category field information is removed from the PivotTable. 
 Summarizing Values  
 Fields in the Values area are totaled using the  Sum function. Figure  15-15 shows that Unit Sales has 
been summed.   

CHAPTER 15 ■ USING PIVOTTABLES AND PIVOTCHARTS
551
 1. 
 The type of calculation can be changed by right-clicking  Sum of Unit Sales and 
then selecting  Summarize Values By . See Figure  15-16 .   
 Figure 15-15.    The values in Store1 are summed. The total is 543 
 Figure 15-16.    The type of calculation can be changed by right-clicking  Sum of Unit Sales and then selecting 
 Summarize Values By 
 2. 
 Here in addition to the  Sum function you can elect to use the  Count ,  Average ,  Max , 
 Min , or  Product functions.  

CHAPTER 15 ■ USING PIVOTTABLES AND PIVOTCHARTS
552
 It would be rare that you would use the  Product function. It multiplies all the values 
under a grouping. For example, in Figure  15-15 , it would determine the product of 
Store 1 by multiplying 300 * 125 * 118. You can view other available functions such 
as variance and standard deviation by clicking More Options… 
 3. 
 Right-click  Sum of Unit Sales in the PivotTable  and then select Summarize Values By  
 4. 
 Click Average. Each of the Unit Sales is now an average and the column heading 
changed to  Average of Unit Sales 
 5. 
 Try the other options. 
 Changing the    Data Source Location  
 1. 
 Add the records in Figure  15-17 to the spreadsheet.   
 Figure 15-17.  Add these two records 
 The records you added were not added to the PivotTable. Because we selected 
a data range instead of a table for our data source we will have to change the 
location of our data source to include the new records. 
 2. 
 Click anywhere in the PivotTable. Click the Ribbon’s Analyze tab, in the Data group, 
click the top half of the Change Data Source button. See Figure  15-18 .   
 Figure 15-18.  Select the top half of the Change Data Source button

 4. 
 Click the OK button. Your PivotTable should now include the records you added. 
 
EXERCISE 15-2: USING A RECOMMENDED  PIVOTTABLE  
 In this exercise you will look at Excel’s recommended PivotTable formats based on the table data you 
have selected.
 1. 
 Open workbook  Chapter15_PivotTables if it isn’t opened already. 
 Select the worksheet named Recommended. 
 2. 
 Select the range A2:D20. Click the Quick Analysis button  
 at the bottom right 
corner of the selected range. 
 3. 
 Select Tables from the tabs at the top. Move your cursor over the four 
recommended PivotTables. If one of them matched your needs, you could click it 
and Excel would create that PivotTable on a separate worksheet. 
 4. 
 Click the More button. 
 The left pane contains six recommended PivotTables. Clicking a PivotTable view 
in the left pane displays an enlarged view of that PivotTable in the right pane. See 
Figure  15-20 .

 You have learned how to create PivotTables. You have seen that you can move fields to different areas 
in the PivotTable Fields pane to control rows, columns, and summarizing. You have also seen how easy it is 
easy to view only data from a particular time or date using a slicer or a time line. Next, you will learn how to 
create a chart that can be filtered. 
 Creating a PivotChart 
 PivotCharts can be created directly from a data source or from a PivotTable. The difference between a 
PivotChart and other charts is that a PivotChart has filter buttons associated with it that the user can use to 
view just what he or she wants on the chart.

 You have learned how to create a PivotChart from source data and from a PivotTable. You have learned how 
to create different PivotTables from the same data source and how to use the PivotTable and PivotChart Wizard. 
 Next, you will learn how you can take data from different sources and link them together by a key field. 
 Creating PivotTable on a Relational Database 
 PivotTables become even more powerful when you can apply them to multiple files that are linked together. 
You can do this through a relational database. 
 When we think of databases we usually think of programs such as Access, SQL Server, Oracle, and so 
on. We can import data from these programs into Excel. We can, however, create small relational databases 
directly in Excel. A relational database is created by linking multiple tables through a common field. The 
tables can be linked together to create a PivotTable. 
 Relational databases consist of  Master and Detail tables. If you have previously used Access you are 
probably familiar with the concept. There must be a common field in the master and detail files on which 
the tables are linked together. There is one Master record for one or more detail records.     
 Figure  15-57  shows a  Customer table and 15-18 shows an  Orders table. The two tables can be linked by 
the common field CustomerID. Each customer in the Customer table is assigned a unique CustomerID. Each 
customer can make many orders; therefore, the CustomerID field in the Orders table is not unique. We call 
this type of relationship between the two tables a one-to-many relationship. The fields used to link tables are 
called  keys . The common field that is unique is called the  Primary Key . The common field on the many side 
is called the  Foreign Key . Looking at the two tables you can see that a CustomerID must already exist in the 
Customer table before it can be used in the Orders table.

 Summary 
 PivotTables provide you with extreme flexibility in what data is to be displayed, how it is to be arranged, 
and what values you want summarized. It’s called a PivotTable because you can pivot your data, switching 
between rows and columns. 
 PivotCharts have the advantage over other charts in that they can be filtered. 
 Small relational databases can be created directly in Excel. 
 The next chapter deals with using Multimedia in a workbook. Multimedia is using different forms of 
communication. You will use different forms of text, diagrams, pictures, screen captures, audio, and video to 
communicate in a workbook.

 Enhancing Workbooks with 
Multimedia 
 Multimedia  includes all the different types of media. You have been using text media, but you can add 
images, shapes, clipart, videos, and audio to your spreadsheets. Multimedia can help you capture your 
audience’s attention by increasing the appeal of your spreadsheets. SmartArt provides a variety of 
organizational and other charts that you can alter to fit your needs. You can grab a screen capture from a web 
site or an Excel example and then place that capture in the current worksheet. 
 After reading and working through this chapter you should be able to
• 
 Add and edit images 
• 
 Use WordArt 
• 
 Add and change shapes 
• 
 Grab an entire window or a portion of it and make it an image 
•

Image. Click the Ribbon’s Format tab. 
 5. 
 In the Adjust group, click Corrections. The corrections gallery shows thumbnails 
of your image with various levels of sharpness, brightness, and contrast. See 
Figure  16-5 . The image in the center of the Sharpen/Soften group and in the center 
of the Brightness/Contrast group has a border around it. The images with borders 
around them represent the way your image looks currently. Move your cursor over 
the thumbnails while observing the effects they have on the selected image on the 
worksheet. As you move farther to the right in the Brightness/Contrast group the 
brightness increases. As you move farther down in the group the contrast increases. 
If you want to apply one of the effects to your selected image, click the thumbnail. If 
you decide you don’t like the effect, you can undo it by pressing Ctrl + Z.

 11.  Click Picture Effects. There are seven groups of various effects. Move your cursor 
over the various Picture Effects while observing their effect on the selected image 
on the worksheet. The picture in Figure  16-11 has a  glow effect. 
 You have learned how to add images to your worksheet from your saved image files on your computer. 
What if you wanted to add an image that you see on a web site or what if you wanted to write training 
documentation and needed an image from Excel or Word or some other application? Excel has a feature 
called  Screenshot that allows you to grab those images.  
 Using  Screenshot 
 Use Screenshot to grab an entire window or a portion of it and turn it into an image. The Screenshot button 
is located on the Insert tab in the Illustrations group. Clicking the Screenshot button opens a thumbnail view 
of all available windows. See Figure  16-12 . Clicking one of these thumbnails captures a full size image of that 
window.

 If you only want to grab a portion of a window, you will need to open that window prior to clicking 
Screen Clipping. After clicking Screen Clipping, the Excel program minimizes, the window that you are 
capturing from dims, and the cursor turns into a crosshair. As you drag your mouse, the area that will be 
included in your image brightens. When you have finished selecting the area you want, the image appears in 
your worksheet. 
 
EXERCISE 16-2: GRABBING AN IMAGE WITH SCREENSHOT
 In this exercise you will grab a portion of a web site which will then be stored in your worksheet. You 
will apply a picture style to the captured image. 
 1. 
 Click the Screenshot Worksheet 
 2. 
 Close or minimize all open windows except Excel.

the Income Statement in your web browser and the Insert tab in Excel at the same 
time. 
 6. 
 Click the Ribbon’s Insert tab. In the Illustrations group, click the Screenshot button. 
 7. 
 Click Screen Clipping at the bottom of the window. The Excel program becomes 
hidden while getting the screen clipping.  
 8. 
 Using the crosshair, drag across the income statement. As you drag across the 
income statement the area that will be included in the captured image becomes 
highlighted. See Figure  16-14 . When you release the mouse, the highlighted area 
becomes an image that is stored on your worksheet.

 Click  Text Effects again. Click 3-D rotation. You might not be able to see the effect 
by moving your cursor over the effects. This seems strange, but you first have to 
apply a 3-D effect before you can view different 3-D effects when moving your 
cursor over them:
 
 a.  Click one of the 3-D effects. 
 
 b.  Click back on Text Effects on the Ribbon, and select 3-D rotation again. Now you 
should be able to see the effects as you move your cursor over each one.  
 
 c.  Select the  Perspective Relaxed Moderately effect. See Figure  16-17 . 
 We have changed the text but we can also change the background behind the text. 
We looked at the Text Fill, Text Outline, and Text Effects. These same options are 
available for the background. These options are available in the Shape Styles group 
and are called Shape Fill, Shape Outline, and Shape Effects.  
 13.

arrows, stars, banners, callouts, and so on, whose shape and color you can modify. Next, you will learn how 
to use SmartArt. SmartArt takes shapes to another level by combining multiple shapes with text to create 
various customizable diagrams. There are nine categories of diagrams and each one contains many layouts 
to choose from. You can also apply styles to the layouts. 
  Figure 16-40.  Picture takes the shape of the circle

 You have learned how to create impressive worksheets by using images, shapes, and layouts. Next you 
will learn how to add audio and video that you or someone else has created to a worksheet. 
 Inserting Sound into a  Worksheet 
 It is a very simple process to create your own audio sounds. You can buy a good inexpensive microphone 
and if you have a laptop it probably has a built-in microphone. You can add audio to your workbook to 
provide instruction or to provide information about the data in the workbook or an explanation of why 
things were done the way they were. 
 You can either embed the audio file into your workbook or create a link to the audio file. The same is 
true for video files. If you create a link to the audio file, the file doesn’t exist as a part of your workbook. When 
you play the audio file Excel searches for the file in the location (path) that you gave it. If you ever move your 
file from that location, Excel will not be able to find it.  
 Add sound to your worksheet by doing the following:
 
 1. 
 Select the cell near which you want the sound inserted.  
 
 2. 
 Make sure the Insert tab of the Ribbon is displayed.  
 
 3. 
 Click the Object tool in the Text group. Excel displays the Object dialog box. 
 
 4. 
 Click the Create from File tab. 
 
 5. 
 Use the controls on the dialog box to locate a sound file that you want included 
with your document. 
 
 6. 
 Click OK. An icon that looks like a speaker is inserted in your document. 
 You can later listen to your sound file by simply double-clicking the speaker icon. You can also move the 
icon to some other place on your worksheet

 7. 
 Click the Open button. The audio should start playing. 
 Inserting Video into a Worksheet. 
 In order to play a video file in Excel you will need to have a software program that plays video, such as 
Windows Media Player. 
 Just like audio files, video files can be either embedded into your worksheet or linked to it. As 
mentioned previously, the problem with linking a file is that if you move that file after you have created the 
link or distribute it to others, Excel will not be able to find it. If you do not choose to link the file, the file will 
become a part of your workbook. If the video file is large your workbook of course will take up more space. 
 Video and Audio files are added the same way to a worksheet. 
 
EXERCISE 16-10: ADDING VIDEO TO YOUR WORKSHEET
 In this exercise you will embed a video file into your worksheet.
 1. 
 Place your cursor where you want the icon for the video file to be. 
 2. 
 Click the Ribbon’s Insert tab. In the Text group, click the Object button. The Object 
dialog box displays. 
 3.

 The  Open Package Contents dialog box opens. Click the Open button. The video 
file starts playing in your computer’s default video player. 
 Using  Bing Maps  
 Using Excel’s Bing Maps you can create a  visual representation   of your data in any location in the world. The 
first column of the data must be an address, city, state, country, zip, latitude/longitude, or a combination. 
Any columns following that must be numeric data. The problem with using a city is that there may be many 
cities with the same name. You can concatenate a city with a state or country name. 
 
EXERCISE 16-11: USING BING MAPS
 In this exercise you will create maps that reflect the revenue created in different cities.
 1. 
 Open the Chapter   16  workbook. Select the worksheet named Maps. 
 The examples in this worksheet use Revenue for the numeric amount. The values 
could be anything (e.g., city or state populations, growth rates, death rates, number 
of employees in a company working in that location, etc.). 
 2. 
 Click the Ribbon’s  Insert tab . In the Add-ins group, click the Bing Maps button. The 
Bing Map displays. See Figure  16-54 .

 in the upper right 
corner. 
 Bing displays a map with a circle in each of the three states. See Figure  16-55 . The 
circle represents the amount of the numeric data. Illinois had the largest amount so 
its circle is the largest.

 Select the cell range A6:C11. Click the Show Location button  
 . The map 
displays with a circle at each of our locations. See Figure  16-56 . Since we provided 
two numeric columns it displayed the first column’s value as the outer circle and 
the second column’s value as the inner circle. The map displays a legend to show 
which value goes with which color. 
 Figure 16-55.    Circles represent the amount of revenue for that location          
 

CHAPTER 16 ■ ENHANCING WORKBOOKS WITH MULTIMEDIA
637
 The circles are okay when viewing two numeric values, but when using more than 
two columns it is really difficult to identify the colors. Instead of using circles you 
can use a pie chart. 
 5. 
 Select the cell range A13:D17. Click the Show Location button  
 .  
 6. 
 Click the Settings button   
 . Select Pie  Chart under  Multiple Data Point Display . 
See Figure  16-57 . Excel lets you select a different color for each of the three pie 
slices. 
 7. 
 Pick whatever colors you want. When you have finished picking your colors, click 
the arrow within the circle to return to the map.

 Excel provides three buttons at the top left of the map. The first button lets you pan 
the map. The second and third buttons let you zoom in and out. See Figure  16-59 . 
 8. 
 Try dragging your mouse cursor around inside the circle of the pan button. When 
your mouse is on the map the cursor shows as a hand. You can get the same 
results as using the pan tool by dragging the hand cursor on the map. 
 9. 
 Moving your cursor over the Zoom in or Zoom out button displays the drag bar as 
shown in Figure  16-60 . You can drag the bar across the lines to zoom. You can also 
just click the Zoom in and Zoom out buttons. Try using both methods. 
 10. 
 Select the cell range A19:B22. Click the Show Location button  
 . Because all of 
the locations are in the same city, the map is zoomed in.

 The locations don’t have to be of the same type. You can have a mix of cities, 
states, countries, zip codes, address, and so on, as shown in Table  16-1 .  
 Moving, Resizing, and Deleting the   Map 
 You can move the map by placing your cursor on the border above the buttons shown in Figure  16-62 . 
The cursor changes to four arrows. You can then drag the map to wherever you want.

 If you click while on the border the sizing handles display. See Figure  16-63 . When you move your 
cursor over a sizing handle it changes to a double arrow. You can drag toward the map to decrease its 
size or drag away from the map to increase its size. 
 You can delete the map when the sizing handles are displayed by pressing the delete key.  
 Summary  
 You have seen how multimedia can have a visual impact as well as improving how quickly the user can grasp 
what you want him or her to know. Multimedia makes your worksheets look more polished and professional 
as well as giving you much more power to convey your message. 
 You can add pictures to your worksheet from either your computer or the Internet. You have seen how 
you can even create a logo with WordArt by making the text follow a path 
 Screenshots can be used to capture an entire screen or a selected portion from a web site or other 
application and then place that capture in the current worksheet. The capture is added to your worksheet as 
an Image. You can alter it in the same way you can alter any other image. 
 You have learned how to use Shapes and SmartArt to create flowcharts, organizational charts, and other 
types of layouts. You can add, alter, and delete a wide variety of shapes. 
 It is very simple to add audio and video. You can either embed the files into your workbook or link to 
them. You can buy a good inexpensive microphone to record your audio notes. In order to play a video file in 
Excel, you will need to have a software program that plays video, such as Windows media player. 
 Bing Maps represent your spreadsheet data on a map. The map can be a city, state, country, or the 
world. 
 In the next chapter, you will see how you can use macros to automate tasks that you repeat over and 
over again. Macros are a recording of a task. Once you have this recording saved, you can run it as many 
times as you need to.

 CHAPTER 17  
 Automating Task with Macros 
 Macros  can be big timesavers for those tasks you find yourself performing over and over again. Macros 
enable you to record a series of steps that you normally use to perform a task, store those steps, and then 
automatically rerun those steps whenever you want. Macros can be quickly activated by assigning shortcut 
keys to them. If you think you might forget a macro’s associated shortcut key, then you can store it in the 
Quick Access Toolbar. You can also attach macros to buttons and other objects. 
 After reading and working through this chapter you should be able to
• 
 Create a macro that uses an absolute cell reference 
• 
 Create a macro that uses a Relative cell reference 
• 
 Assign a macro to a button 
• 
 Assign a macro to the Quick Access Toolbar 
• 
 Assign a macro to a shape 
• 
 Create and update the personal workbook 
• 
 Save a macro-enabled workbook 
• 
 Use the VBA (Visual Basics for Applications) Development Environment  
• 
 Edit a macro 
 Creating (Recording) a Macro 
 Simple macros can be created using the Macro Recorder. More complex macros can be created in the Macro 
Editor. The  Macro Recorder records every keystroke and every mouse click from the time you start the 
recorder to the time you stop it. Since it records everything that you do, don’t click any other cells or perform 
any steps other than those that are directly related to the task you want to perform. 
 The Macro Recorder can be started from three different  locations :
• 
 On the View tab, in the Macros group, click the down arrow for the Macros button 
and select Start Recording. 
• 
 On the Developer tab, in the Code group, click Record Macro. 
• 
 On the Status bar, click the Macro Start Recording button  
 

CHAPTER 17 ■ AUTOMATING TASK WITH MACROS
644
 When you start the recorder, a  Record Macro dialog box   opens where you will need to enter the name 
you are assigning to the macro, a shortcut key, and where you want the macro stored; you can also provide a 
description of the macro so that later you can remember what its purpose is. See Figure  17-1 . 
 There are three places you can store your macro:
• 
 The current workbook 
• 
 A new workbook 
• 
 The Personal Macro Workbook 
 If you want to make the macros available for use in other workbooks, select Personal Macro Workbook. 
The Personal Macro Workbook doesn’t exist until you save a macro to it. Excel saves the file as  PERSONAL.
xlsb . This workbook is hidden and is opened automatically whenever you start Excel. 
 
EXERCISE 17-1: CREATING A SIMPLE MACRO
 The macro we will create will apply formatting to a cell. We will use the  Start Recording button on the 
status bar. 
 Recording the Macro  
 1. 
 Create a new workbook:
 
 a.  Click the File tab and then select Save As. 
 
 b.  Select the location where you want your workbook stored. 
 
 c. 
 Enter  Macro_Practice for the File name. 
 
 d.  Select  Excel Workbook for the  Save As type . 
 
 e.  Click the Save button. 
 Figure 17-1.  Entries to make before recording the macro 
 

CHAPTER 17 ■ AUTOMATING TASK WITH MACROS
645
 2. 
 Look on your status bar and see if you have the Macro Start Recording button   
 . 
If you don’t, then right-click the status bar, select the option for  Macro Recording, 
and then press the (Esc)ape key to hide the option window. 
 3. 
 Click inside cell A1. 
 4. 
 Click the Macro Recording button on the status bar. The Record Macro dialog box 
opens. 
 5. 
 The macro name can’t contain any spaces. Type  FormatEntry for the Macro name. 
 The Shortcut key is currently showing  Ctrl + and a text box where you are to enter 
a keystroke that will be used in addition to the Ctrl key. If you enter a lowercase 
letter Excel requires you to enter the  Ctrl key + the letter that you entered for 
the shortcut key. Unfortunately, just about all the shortcuts that use a Ctrl key 
and a lowercase letter are already being used by Excel, so we will only be using 
uppercase letters. If you enter an uppercase letter, Excel adds a Shift key to the 
shortcut; therefore you would need to enter Ctrl + Shift + the letter you entered for 
the shortcut 
 6. 
 Click inside the text box and type Shift + F. 
 7. 
 Click the drop-down arrow for the  Store Macro in drop-down box and select  This 
Workbook because we only want to use the macro in the current workbook. 
 8. 
 For Description, type  This is my first macro. It will bold, italicize, change the 
font size to 16, and change the background color to red. 
 9. 
 Click the OK button. 
 Every keystroke and mouse click that you make from now until you click the Stop 
Recording button is recorded, so don’t click any other cells or any command 
buttons other than what you are instructed here to do. You will know when you are 
recording a macro because the Macro Start Recording button changes to the Macro 
Stop Recording button  
 . Look at your status bar; the Macro Stop Recording 
button should be displayed 
 10. 
 On the Ribbon’s Home tab, in the Font group, click the Bold and Italics buttons. 
Change the font size to 16. Change the Fill Color to Orange, Accent 2, Lighter 80%. 
See Figure  17-2 . 

CHAPTER 17 ■ AUTOMATING TASK WITH MACROS
646
 11. 
 Click the Macro Stop Recording button   
 on the status bar.  
 Playing Back the    Macro 
 1. 
 Click cell C2. 
 2. 
 Type  Hello . 
 3. 
 Press Ctrl + Enter. 
 4. 
 Press the shortcut keys you created for this macro  Ctrl + Shift + F 
 All the keystrokes you used during the recording are now played back and the text in C2 is 
formatted as defined in the macro. 
 The Problem with  Absolute Cell References 
 When you record macros you can record them using  absolute cell references , which is the default, or 
you can choose to record them using relative cell references. When you record a macro using absolute cell 
references, Excel records the exact location where you entered your data. None of your pointer movements 
are recorded (such as using the up and down arrow keys). Unfortunately, if you use Excel’s default absolute 
cell references when using multiple cells, you may not get the results you expected. 
 
EXERCISE 17-2: LOOKING AT THE PROBLEM WITH ABSOLUTE CELL 
REFERENCES
 This exercise will show the problem with absolute cell references so that you will be able to identify it. 
 1. 
 Create a new worksheet. Change the name of the worksheet to “Absolute.” 
 2. 
 Click the Macro Start Recording button   
 on the status bar. 
 Figure 17-2.  Change the Fill Color to Orange, Accent 2, Lighter 80% 
 

CHAPTER 17 ■ AUTOMATING TASK WITH MACROS
647
 3. 
 Enter  AbsoluteReference for the Macro name. (There can be no spaces in a Macro 
name.) 
 4. 
 Enter Shift +  A for the shortcut key. 
 5. 
 Store the macro in  This Workbook . 
 6. 
 For the Description type  Enter values into multiple cells using Absolute Cell 
Referencing . 
 7. 
 Press the OK button. 
 8. 
 Click inside cell B4. Type the word  Excel . Press the tab key and then type  2016 . 
Press the tab key twice and then type  Macro . Press the tab key twice and then type 
 Tutorial . Press Ctrl + Enter. 
 9. 
 Click the Macro Stop Recording button   
 . 
 10. 
 Click inside cell C6. On the View tab, in  the Macros group, the Macros button has 
two parts. 
 
 Clicking the top half of the button displays the  Macro dialog box which displays all 
of your macros. Clicking the down arrow on the bottom half of the Macros button 
brings up a menu from which you can select View Macros. See Figure  17-3 . This 
option also brings up the  Macro dialog box. 
 11. 
 Click the down arrow for the Macros button and then select View  Macros. 
 12. 
 The Macro dialog box opens showing all of the available macros. Select the 
AbsoluteReference macro. Click the  Run button. This is another way of running a 
macro. You could have also used the shortcut you created, which was Ctrl + Shift + A. 
See Figure  17-4 . 
 Figure 17-3.    Clicking the bottom half of Macros button brings up a menu 
 

CHAPTER 17 ■ AUTOMATING TASK WITH MACROS
648
 The results are probably that cell G4 became the active cell. This is because it 
repeated the entries that you previously made rather than placing the entries 
starting at cell C6. This is because Excel uses absolute referencing by default, 
which doesn’t adjust for any changes in the row or columns. 
 Absolute referencing is fine when you first apply formatting to a cell and then apply that formatting to 
another cell, as we did previously, but it doesn’t work well for multiple entries.  
 You have learned to create macros using Excel’s default absolute cell reference. In Exercise 17-10 you 
will look at the code that Excel created for this macro and how you can alter it.  
 Saving a Macro-Enabled  Workbook 
 Workbooks that contain macros must be saved using a different file format than those used for other 
workbooks. Workbooks that do not contain macros are usually saved with the extension  .xlsx . Macro-
enabled workbooks need to be stored with the extension  .xlsm . 
 
EXERCISE 17-3: SAVING A MACRO-ENABLED WORKBOOK
 We originally saved our Macro_Practice workbook as an Excel Workbook, but we have added macros 
to the workbook since we did the save. If we try to save it again as an Excel Workbook we will get a 
warning message stating that if we continue with this save we will lose all the macros saved to this 
workbook.
 1. 
 Click the  Save button  
 on the Quick Access Toolbar. See Figure  17-5 . 
 Figure 17-4.  Results of running the AbsoluteReference macro

CHAPTER 17 ■ AUTOMATING TASK WITH MACROS
650
 4. 
 Click the Save button. 
 The workbook is saved as macro-enabled and the extension  .xlsm is added to the file name. 
The macros saved to the workbook will be available to use in the future. 
 Creating a Macro Using  Relative Cell References 
 If you are creating a macro where you will be entering data into more than one cell you should use  relative 
cell references . As you have seen, absolute cell referencing for multiple cell entries is relatively useless. It 
doesn’t seem to make any sense why Microsoft decided not to make relative cell referencing the default. 
 
EXERCISE 17-4: USING RELATIVE CELL REFERENCES
 We will create a macro the same way we did for the AbsoluteReferencing macro except that this time 
we will create it using the relative reference method.
 1. 
 Close all open Excel workbooks. Create a new Excel workbook. 
 2. 
 Click the View tab on the Ribbon. In the Window group notice that there is a Hide 
and Unhide button. Unless you have previously saved macros to the Personal Macro 
Workbook the Unhide button should be currently unavailable. 
 3. 
 Click the down arrow of the Macros button and select  Use Relative References . 
 4. 
 Click inside cell B4. Click the Record Macro button on the Status bar. 
 5. 
 In the Macro dialog box, complete the following steps:
 
 a.  Enter  RelativeReferencing for the name. 
 
 b.  Enter a capital  R for the shortcut key. 
 
 c. 
 Change the storage location of the macro to  Personal Macro Workbook . 
 
 d.  For the Description type  Enter values into multiple cells using Relative Cell 
Referencing . 
 
 e.  Click the OK button. 
 6. 
 Type the word  Excel in cell B4. Press the tab key then type  2016 . Press the tab key 
twice and then type  Macro . Press the tab key twice and then type  Tutorial . Press 
Ctrl + Enter. 
 7. 
 Click the Macro Stop Recording button on the status bar. 
 8. 
 Click in cell C6. Click the top half of the Macros button. You should see the macro 
you created. Excel has changed the name of the macro to reflect that it is being 
stored in the  PERSONAL.XLSB file. 
 9. 
 Select the name of your new macro and then click the Run button. 
 This time all of the data displays in the new row. 
 10. 
 Click the View tab. In the Window group the Unhide button should now be available 
for use. Click it. See Figure  17-7 . 

CHAPTER 17 ■ AUTOMATING TASK WITH MACROS
651
 11. 
 With PERSONAL workbook selected click the OK button.  
 You should now be looking at the PERSONAL workbook. It looks like a normal 
workbook with one worksheet. Its purpose is just to make its macros available to 
other workbooks. On the Ribbon on the View tab in the Windows group click the 
Hide button. 
 The PERSONAL workbook should now be hidden and you should be looking again 
at your original workbook. 
 12. 
 On the Ribbon, click the File tab, click Save As. 
 13. 
 Select where you want the file to be saved. 
 Because the workbook contains a macro it must be saved as macro-enabled. 
 14. 
 Change the Save as type to  Excel Macro-Enabled Workbook . Name the workbook 
 Relative . Click the Save button. 
 15. 
 Click the  
 in the upper right corner to exit from Excel. 
 If you didn’t save the Personal Macro Workbook you will be asked to save the 
changes you made to it. See Figure  17-8 . Click Save. 
 Figure 17-7.  Unhide dialog box 
 Figure 17-8.    Excel asks if you want to save the changes to the Personal Macro Workbook 
 
 

CHAPTER 17 ■ AUTOMATING TASK WITH MACROS
652
 
■ Note I know the message says to click Yes, but there isn’t a Yes button. Click the Save button. 
 Now whenever you start another workbook the PERSONAL workbook will be automatically loaded but it 
will be hidden. If you click the Unhide button from now on you will see the PERSONAL workbook. 
 Adding Macros to the Quick Access Toolbar and Other 
Objects 
 So far we have seen that you can run a macro by typing its shortcut keys and seen how you can run it from 
the Macros button. For easy and quick availability, you can add a macro to the Quick Access Toolbar or you 
can attach it to a button or other object. 
 
EXERCISE 17-5: ASSIGNING INDIVIDUAL MACROS TO THE QUICK 
ACCESS TOOLBAR
 We will assign the RelativeReferencing macro you just created to the Quick Access Toolbar.
 1. 
 Create a new Workbook. 
 2. 
 Right-click the Quick Access Toolbar. Select  Customize  Quick Access Toolbar . See 
Figure  17-9 .

in all of our Excel workbooks. 
 5. 
 Under the  Customize  Quick Access Toolbar drop-down menu, choose  For all 
documents (default) . The other choice for the drop-down menu is to place the 
macro in the Quick Access Toolbar only when the current workbook is being used. 
 6. 
 Click the Modify button. This brings up the Modify Button dialog box. See Figure  17-10 .

select will be placed on the Quick Access Toolbar. Click the OK button on the Modify 
Button dialog box. 
 8. 
 Click the OK button in the Excel Options dialog box. 
 9. 
 Click cell A11. Click the button you just created on the Quick Access Toolbar. The 
RelativeReferencing macro runs. 
 So far we have seen that you can run a macro from the Macros button or by typing its shortcut keys. You 
have also learned how to get quick access to a macro by adding it to the Quick Access Toolbar. In the next 
exercise, you will assign a macro to a shape that you can click to start the macro. 
 
EXERCISE 17-6: ASSIGNING A MACRO TO A SHAPE
 In this exercise, you assign a macro to a shape.

 The Macros button is on the Ribbon’s View tab. This means you have to click the View tab when 
you want to view the macros or if you need to specify if you want Absolute Cell Referencing or Relative 
Addressing. To make these features available no matter what the active Ribbon tab is, we will add the Macro 
button to the Quick Access Toolbar in the next exercise. 
 
EXERCISE 17-7: ASSIGNING THE MACRO BUTTON TO THE QUICK 
ACCESS TOOLBAR
 We will place the Macros button on the toolbar so that you will not need to go to the  View tab every time 
you want to run or edit a macro.
 1. 
 Click the File tab on the Ribbon. Click Options. 
 2. 
 From the left pane select Quick Access Toolbar.

 Scroll to the bottom of the list and find View Macros. Select  View Macros . Click the 
 Add button. 
 5. 
 Click the OK button. 
 6. 
 Click the View Macros button on the Quick Access Toolbar. Click the Cancel button. 
 Adding the Developer Tab to the   Ribbon  
 If you are creating VBA code or assigning a macro to a button you will need to do this in the Visual 
Basic Environment which can only be accessed through the Ribbon’s Developer tab. If you don’t see a 
Developer tab on your Ribbon you will need to add it by performing the following steps:
 1. 
 Click the  File tab on the Ribbon. Select  Options in the left pane to open the Excel 
Options dialog box. 
 2. 
 Click  Customize Ribbon in the left pane. Select  Developer in the right pane. Click 
the  OK button. See Figure  17-14 .

 You should now see a Developer tab on the Ribbon. 
 
EXERCISE 17-8: ASSIGNING A MACRO TO A BUTTON.
 We will assign the same macro to a button.
 1. 
 Create a new worksheet. 
 2. 
 On the Ribbon, click the Developer tab. In the Controls Group click the Insert Button. 
 Excel has two types of controls: Form Controls and ActiveX  Controls . Both types 
have some of the same controls. You cannot assign macros to ActiveX Controls, as 
you can with Form controls. See Figure  17-15 . 
 Figure 17-14.  Select Developer

 3. 
 Select the first form control, which is the button. Move the cursor down into the 
spreadsheet area. The cursor will change to a crosshair. 
 4. 
 Starting in cell C2 drag down and to the right until you have created enough area 
for a button. 
 5. 
 The Assign Macro dialog box appears. Click PERSONAL.XLSB!RelativeReferencing. 
Click the OK button. 
 6. 
 Right-click the button and select  Edit Text . Change the text on the button from 
Button 1 to Practice. 
 7. 
 Click inside any empty cell to deselect the button. Click the button you just created. 
 Sharing the Personal Workbook with  Others 
 You can use the Personal Workbook ( Personal.xlsb ) on other computers or share it with others by 
e-mailing them the file or copying it to an external drive and then they could copy the file into the XLSTART 
folder on their computer. 
 Looking at VBA  Code 
 When you record a macro you are actually creating VBA code. VBA is a programming language. Studying the 
results of the code created when you record a macro is a good way to learn VBA. 
 The code for each macro that you create is stored in its own separate block of code called a Procedure. 
A procedure begins with the keyword  Sub and ends with the keywords  End Sub . Sub is short for Subroutine. 
Procedures are often referred to as Subroutines. 
 
EXERCISE 17-9: EDIT THE CODE CREATED BY A MACRO
 For this practice we will alter the code created by the AbsoluteReference macro you created in 
Exercise 17-3. We will change the code to make the macro repeat the same pattern of text in the row 
where you start the macro.  
 Figure 17-15.    Form  Controls          
 

CHAPTER 17 ■ AUTOMATING TASK WITH MACROS
659
 
■ Note Instead of using absolute referencing we could have used relative addressing to make Exercise 17-3 
work, but I want you to see how macros are driven by VBA code and how you can make changes to it. If you 
want to become a VBA expert, there are entire books devoted to the subject.
 1. 
 Open the Macro_Practice workbook you saved in Exerice 17-3. You may need to click on Enable Content. 
On the Ribbon, click the View tab. In the Macros group click the upper half of the Macros button.  
 2. 
 In the Macro dialog box select AbsoluteReference. 
 3. 
 Click the Edit button. You are now in the VBA Editor. Here you will find the VBA code created by Excel 
for the FormatEntry and AbsoluteReference macros that you created. The code in Figure  17-16 
appears in your VBA Editor window for the AbsoluteReference macro. 
 You can make changes to the code to alter the way the macro works. Notice that the code is placed 
between  Sub and  End Sub statements. The  Sub statement is given the name you assigned to the macro. 
After the  Sub statement comes several lines that start with a single quote. These lines appear in green. 
These are comment lines. These lines are ignored when running the macro. They only appear as an aid 
to help you remember important facts about the macro. 
 Next comes the code statements that make the macro perform its steps. Notice that cell addresses are 
placed in  Range statements. These statements select these exact cells. That is why when you ran the 
macro the data was entered into the exact same cells as they were originally entered.  
 Figure 17-16.    Code for AbsoluteReference  macro         
 

CHAPTER 17 ■ AUTOMATING TASK WITH MACROS
660
 We will change the code so that the first cell used is no longer cell B4 but whatever cell you are in when 
you start the macro. 
 4. 
 Change the statement  Range("B4").Select to  ActiveCell.Select 
 5. 
 Change the statement  Range("C4").Select to  ActiveCell.Offset(0, 1).Select 
 The range C4 is one column over from cell B4; therefore, we need our code to reflect the move one 
column over from the active cell. We can do this using the  Offset method. The  Offset method uses two 
values. The first value is the row. The second value is the column. We want all of our data to appear on 
the same row so we don’t want to change the row from the active cell. Therefore, we use a 0 for the 
row to keep it where it is and we use a 1 to move over one column. 
 6. 
 Change the statement  Range("E4").Select to  ActiveCell.Offset(0, 2).Select 
 The range E4 is two columns over from cell C4. We also want our code to move two columns over 
from the active cell. Therefore, we use 2 for the column value of the  Offset method. 
 7. 
 Change the statement  Range("G4").Select to  ActiveCell.Offset(0, 2).Select 
 The range G4 is two columns over from cell E4. We also want our code to move two columns over 
from the active cell. Therefore, we use 2 for the column value of the  Offset method. Your code should 
look like the following: 
 ActiveCell.Select 
 ActiveCell.FormulaR1C1 = "Excel" 
 ActiveCell.Offset(0, 1).Select 
 ActiveCell.FormulaR1C1 = "2016" 
 ActiveCell.Offset(0, 2).Select 
 ActiveCell.FormulaR1C1 = "Macro" 
 ActiveCell.Offset(0, 2).Select 
 Selection.FormulaR1C1 = "Tutorial" 
 Now that you have finished editing the code you can return to the worksheet to try it out. You can 
return to the worksheet by clicking the Excel  
 button on the toolbar or you can press Alt + F11. 
Pressing Alt + F11 lets you toggle back and forth between the VBA Editor and the worksheet. 
 8. 
 Press Alt + F11. 
 9. 
 Click inside cell C6. Press the shortcut you created: Ctrl + Shift + A. 
 Try running the macro in different rows starting in different columns. The pattern should remain the same.  
 This exercise solved the problem that you observed in Exercise 17-2. You could have, of course, avoided 
the problem by creating a Relative Cell Address macro rather than an Absolute Cell Address macro. 

CHAPTER 17 ■ AUTOMATING TASK WITH MACROS
661
 Creating Macros from Code 
 A macro doesn’t have to be recorded and then played back. Macros can be manually coded into procedures 
in the Visual Basic Editor’s code window. You can still assign shortcut keys and a description to manually 
coded macros as well as assigning them to objects such as buttons, clip art, images, shapes, and so on. 
 A procedure is stored within a  module . A module can contain many procedures. Macros are 
automatically stored in numbered modules. The first macro you create will be stored in  Module1. Each 
macro you create thereafter will also be stored there until you close your workbook. When you reopen 
the workbook and create a new macro it will be stored in  Module2 . Whenever you close and reopen the 
workbook any new macros that you create will be stored in a new module with the name assigned to the next 
number in the sequence. 
 
EXERCISE 17-10: CREATING A MACRO FROM CODE
 Sometimes just a simple macro can greatly improve the functionality of a worksheet. In this practice 
we will create the  time line in Figure  17-17 . Entering text at angle saves space and looks good, but you 
have to bend your head to view it. Wouldn’t it be nice if you could view that vertical text in a large cell 
in a horizontal format without altering the current layout of your data? Well that is the functionality we 
are going to add to the timeline. This practice program will allow a user to click one of the cells that 
contains text displayed at an angle and then either use a shortcut key or click a button to copy the data 
to a cell that displays the data in a horizontal format. 
 Figure 17-17.    You will create this timeline          
 

CHAPTER 17 ■ AUTOMATING TASK WITH MACROS
662
 1. 
 Open the workbook Chapter   17  . 
 2. 
 Click the Ribbon’s  Developer tab . In the Controls group click the Insert button. 
 3. 
 Click the Button control in the Form Controls area. Move the cursor below the 
timeline and drag out a button so that it is in the same location and size as shown 
in Figure  17-17 . 
 4. 
 The Assign Macro button dialog  box appears. Fill in the fields as in Figure  17-18 :
 
 a.  Change the  Macro Name to ConvertToHorizontal. 
 
 b.  Change the  Macros in to This Workbook. 
 
 c. 
 Click the New button. 
 You are now in the VBA coding area. The following code is displayed in the Module 
code window. 
 Sub ConvertToHorizontal() 
 End Sub 
 5. 
 Place the following code between the two  Sub lines. 
 Figure 17-18.  Click the New button on the  Assign Macro window 
 

CHAPTER 17 ■ AUTOMATING TASK WITH MACROS

 'Make the background color white for the cell range C7:G7 
 Range("C7:G7").Interior.Color = RGB(255, 255, 255) 
 'Make the background color green for the selected cell 
 ActiveCell.Interior.Color = RGB(110, 255, 170) 
 'Take the data from the current cell and display in cell C1 
 Range("C1") = ActiveCell 
 6. 
 Press Alt + F11 to return to the worksheet. 
 7. 
 Click cell G7. Click the button you created. 
 The text from cell G7 should appear in cell C1 in a horizontal format. 
 8. 
 Click cell C7. Click the button you created. 
 The text from cell C7 should appear in cell C1 in a horizontal format. 
 9. 
 On the Developer tab in the Code group click the Macros button. Click the  Options 
button on the Macro dialog box. See Figure  17-19 . 
 10. 
 Complete the Macro Options dialog box shown in Figure  17-20 :
 
 a.  For the Shortcut key; hold down the Shift key and press T. 
 
 b.  For the Description, enter “Display text in horizontal format.” 
 
 c. 
 Click the OK button. 
 Figure 17-19.  Select Options from the Macro dialog box 
 

CHAPTER 17 ■ AUTOMATING TASK WITH MACROS
664
 11. 
 Click the Cancel button for the Macro window. 
 12. 
 Click one of the cells in the range C7:G7. Press Ctrl + Shift + T. The 
ConvertToHorizontal macro runs and produces the timeline formatted like the one 
shown previously in Figure  17-17 . 
 Summary 
 If you find yourself needing to perform the same steps over and over, then create a macro to save yourself 
some time. Macros can be played back by using shortcut keys. Macros can also be played by clicking buttons 
or other objects that you assign the macro to. 
 Macros that you want available to all of your workbooks, or to share with others, should be stored in the 
 Personal.xlsb workbook. This workbook stays hidden until you click the Unhide button. 
 Macros can be created using either relative addressing or absolute cell referencing. Absolute cell 
referencing works okay when you are creating a macro that affects a single cell, but if the macro affects 
multiple cells you will most likely want to use relative cell addressing. 
 Excel converts the macros that you create into Visual Basic for Applications code. This code is editable. 
You don’t have to create a macro to create VBA code. You can create your own VBA code from scratch. After 
you have mastered learning VBA, you will find yourself more often writing the code than letting Excel create 
it for you.
