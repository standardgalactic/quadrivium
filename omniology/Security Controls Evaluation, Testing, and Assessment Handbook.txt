Introduction
The approach of this book is to take  
FISMA, NIST guidance, and DOD policy 
guidance and provide a detailed hands-on 
guide to performing assessment events in 
the federal space since, as of March 2014, all 
agencies are following the same guidelines 
under the NIST-based Risk Management 
Framework as found in Special Publication 
(SP) 800-37, rev. 1. This book will provide 
assessment guidance for federal civilian 
agencies, DOD and IC-type authorization 
efforts following the CNSS 4015, DIACAP/
RMF-DOD validator, and NIST-based SCA 
requirements and documentation along with 
my practical experience of performing and 
overseeing these efforts for 12 different fed-
eral agencies on 31 different types of systems 
over the past 4.5 years.
We will use the NIST SP 800-53A, NIST 
SP 800-115, DOD’s RMF Knowledge Service, 
and the NIST control families assessment 
guides for our exploration of the needs, 
requirements, and actual test and evalua-
tion efforts for all of the security controls. 
Each of the controls has a unique way it 
can and should be evaluated through test, 
examination, and key personnel interviews 
and each of these will be explained and dis-
cussed. We will supplement this process 
with detailed technical, operational, and 
administrative knowledge for each control, 
as needed, with data from the various best 
practices Special Publications from NIST, 
technical support data available from vari-
ous security vendors, best business prac-
tices gathered from industry, and in-depth 
knowledge of controls and their assessment 
gleaned from hands-on utilization and 
evaluation efforts.

Introduction to Assessments
Within the US government’s requirements for operating and maintaining federal informa-
tion systems safely and securely is the built-in need to validate and verify the operational, 
technical, and managerial security for each system, office, data component, and individual bit 
of information that is used, exchanged, stored, acted upon, and utilized by the governmental 
agency. Each governmental agency is required by law (both Federal Information Security 
Management Act (FISMA) and Privacy Act) to ensure the data and information it retains dur-
ing the normal course of its activities be confidential (if it is not public information), accurate, 
and retrievable when needed. This process for ensuring the security of the systems and in-
formation is known in the federal community as “assessment” and is usually conducted by 
relatively independent organizations and individuals called “assessors.” This handbook is 
developed to provide assessors and other interested personnel the guides, techniques, tools, 
and knowledge to conduct these assessments for most all federal information systems. We 
will examine the needs and requirements for assessments, look at the methodologies for pro-
viding the assessments in three distinct formats (basic, focused, and comprehensive), and go in 
depth on the actual assessment techniques of examinations, interviews, and testing for and of 
each of the security controls as defined in the National Institute of Standards and Technology 
(NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-53. SP 800-53 defines the security controls needed, re-
quired, or recommended for each federal information system. This security control “catalog” 
is extremely extensive and contains a vast number and types of security controls throughout 
the managerial, operational, and technical domains.
Generally speaking these three security control arenas cover:
1.	 Management: Actions taken to manage the development, maintenance, and use of the 
system
a.	 Examples are policies, procedures, and rules of behavior.
2.	 Operational: Day-to-day mechanisms and procedures used to protect operational systems 
and environment
a.	 Examples are awareness training, configuration management, and incident response.
3.	 Technical: Hardware/software controls used to provide protection of the IT system and 
the information it stores, processes, and/or transmits
a.	 Examples are access controls, authentication mechanisms, and encryption.

1.  Introduction to Assessments
﻿
Now, an assessment is required by the federal organization to ensure and document that 
the system under review has the basic security components and requirements to meet the 
federal standards for operating on a federal network. These requirements are defined in sev-
eral locations, starting with Public Law 107-347, Title III of the E-Government Act of 2002, 
otherwise known as the FISMA. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) also has 
security requirements for systems to meet when deploying them onto federal networks in 
its Circular A-130, Appendix 3. Additional requirements are found throughout the federal 
statutory and regulatory environment in the various laws (i.e., Health Insurance Portability 
and Accountability Act (HIPAA)/Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical 
Health Act (HITECH)/Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), etc.), Presidential Directives 
(E.O. 13236, etc.), and agency regulations (Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) 
HIPAA Security and Privacy Rules, DODI 8510.01M, US Army AR 25-2, etc.).
By definition in NIST SP 800-53A, an assessment is: “The testing and/or evaluation of the 
managerial, operational, and technical security controls to determine the extent to which the 
controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended and producing the desired out-
come with respect to meeting the security requirements for an information system or organi-
zation.” As we begin to explore the processes, procedures, techniques, and means of testing 
and evaluating the various security components and controls used throughout the security 
industry, we will keep in mind the applicability and effectiveness needs for each control re-
viewed, each technique employed, and each policy or procedure recommended. Assessments 
require a large amount of skills, knowledge, and testing techniques, as well as automated and 
manual toolsets in order to accomplish the goal of providing assurance to the management 
and executives that the risks they are about to take are acceptable and reasonable for the 
level of security they desire within their systems. We will discuss the available tools and their 
usage when conducting the testing phase of each assessment. So, let us begin with the first 
area to be covered, the background for the security and risk process and what is at stake, the 
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our systems.

Risk, Security, and Assurance
The US government has long maintained the need and the requirement to evaluate and 
ascertain the IT systems operating on its networks and backbones were as secure as possible. 
Over the past 25 years, various organizations within the federal government have developed 
and operated under multiple different methodologies to provide the assurance to managers 
and executives that the IT systems were safe, secure, and trustworthy. This process began 
back in the 1970s and 1980s in the US government Intelligence Community (IC) with the 
original directives for ensuring confidentiality of the systems and the data retained in these 
systems.
The current security practices and processes all focus on managing and mitigating risks as-
sociated with the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information associated with 
the operation and maintenance of each federal IT system. The risk review, tolerance criteria, 
and management activities all are associated with the actual data stored on the IT system, the 
downstream liabilities of others using those same data, and the legal and regulatory require-
ments for the use and storage of those same data and information. The National Institutes 
of Standards and Technology (NIST) has produced a series of documents and publications 
which are designed to provide federal agencies guidance and best practices for these agency 
actions and activities with the relevant data and information. These publications are mostly 
found on their specific security website at http://csrc.nist.gov and are openly available to all 
who are interested.
There are many frameworks and guidelines available for organizational-level and corpo-
rate-level risk management. The available guides include COBIT 5, COSO, FAIR, ISO 31000, 
ISO 27000, and others. Many of these risk frameworks are industry-specific and further re-
search for your industry should reveal which risk approach and framework are appropriate 
for your organization. Our goal here is to let you know there are many ways to address risk in 
an organization, with NIST providing the primary way within the US government. To evalu-
ate, examine, and assess risk, the assessor will need to know the organizational approach to 
risk and how these risks are mitigated, transferred, or otherwise treated.
The NIST approach to risk management is found in Special Publication (SP) 800-37, rev. 
1 entitled Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems: A 
Security Life Cycle Approach. This guide was published in February 2010 and recently was up-
dated (June 2014) to include the federal requirements for continuous monitoring and ongoing 
system authorizations. As defined by NIST, risk management is the process that provides for 
IT managers and executives to make risk-based decisions on the security and assurance of the 

6	
2.  Risk, Security, and Assurance
﻿
IT systems under their control. These decisions are the result of balancing the operational and 
economic costs of the protective components and achieve the resultant gains in the organiza-
tion’s mission capability by protecting and defending these various IT systems and the as-
sociated information which support the organization’s missions. Risk is defined in SP 800-37, 
rev. 1 as a measure of the extent to which an entity is threatened by a potential circumstance 
or event, and a function of:
1.	 The adverse impacts that would arise if the circumstance or event occurs
2.	 The likelihood of occurrence
RISK MANAGEMENT
NIST opens up SP 800-37 with the following: “Organizations depend on information tech-
nology and the information systems that are developed from that technology to successfully 
carry out their missions and business functions. Information systems can include as con-
stituent components, a range of diverse computing platforms from high-end supercomputers 
to personal digital assistants and cellular telephones. Information systems can also include 
very specialized systems and devices (e.g., telecommunications systems, industrial/process 
control systems, testing and calibration devices, weapons systems, command and control sys-
tems, and environmental control systems). Federal information and information systems are 
subject to serious threats that can have adverse impacts on organizational operations (includ-
ing mission, functions, image, and reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other or-
ganizations, and the Nation by compromising the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of 
information being processed, stored, or transmitted by those systems. Threats to information 
and information systems include environmental disruptions, human or machine errors, and 
purposeful attacks. Cyber-attacks on information systems today are often aggressive, disci-
plined, well-organized, well-funded, and in a growing number of documented cases, very  
sophisticated. Successful attacks on public and private sector information systems can result 
in serious or grave damage to the national and economic security interests of the United 
States. Given the significant and growing danger of these threats, it is imperative that leaders 
at all levels of an organization understand their responsibilities for achieving adequate infor-
mation security and for managing information system-related security risks.”1
When NIST published SP 800-37, rev. 1 in early 2010, it changed the entire government’s 
approach to risk and risk management. Prior to that point, certification and accreditation 
(C&A) had focused most efforts on a “snapshot” view of security as sufficient to ensure the 
security of IT systems as referenced in the FISMA and OMB guidance documents in use dur-
ing the previous 8 years (FISMA) and 25 years (OMB A-130). This shift in the approach to 
security moved the viewpoint to focus now on risks in an operating environment that is ever 
changing, ever evolving, fluid, and full of emerging threats.
The goal of this risk management approach is to provide for mission accomplishment by:
1.	 Better securing the IT systems which store, process, or transmit organizational 
information

2.	 Enabling management to make well-informed risk-based decisions to justify the 
expenditures that are part of an IT budget
3.	 Assisting management in authorizing the IT systems on the basis of the supporting docu-
mentation resulting from the performance of risk management
As part of the risk management process, each organization is recommended to review all 
risks at an organizational level, a business unit/department level, and the IT system level. 
Managing these IT-related risks is a detailed, complex, multifaceted activity which requires 
senior management support for the strategic and organizational goals for tolerating and treat-
ing risks, midlevel managers to plan for and conduct the projects, and then operating the 
systems that are core to the organization. NIST SP 800-39 Managing Information Security Risk 
defines these three levels as the Tier 1 (organizational level), Tier 2 (mission and business 
process level), and Tier 3 (information system level of risk management).
SP 800-39 goes further to define these three tiers as follows:
1.	 “Tier 1 addresses risk from an organizational perspective by establishing and implement-
ing governance structures that are consistent with the strategic goals and objectives of 
organizations and the requirements defined by federal laws, directives, policies, regula-
tions, standards, and missions/business functions. Governance structures provide over-
sight for the risk management activities conducted by organizations and include: (i) the 
establishment and implementation of a risk executive (function); (ii) the establishment of 
the organization’s risk management strategy including the determination of risk tolerance; 
and (iii) the development and execution of organization-wide investment strategies for 
information resources and information security.”2
2.	 “Tier 2 addresses risk from a mission/business process perspective by designing, 
developing, and implementing mission/business processes that support the missions/
business functions defined at Tier 1. Organizational mission/business processes guide 
and inform the development of an enterprise architecture that provides a disciplined 
and structured methodology for managing the complexity of the organization’s 
information technology infrastructure. A key component of the enterprise architecture is 
the embedded information security architecture that provides a roadmap to ensure that 
mission/business process-driven information security requirements and protection needs 
are defined and allocated to appropriate organizational information systems and the 
environments in which those systems operate.”3
3.	 “All information systems, including operational systems, systems under development, 
and systems undergoing modification, are in some phase of the system development 
life cycle. In addition to the risk management activities carried out at Tier 1 and Tier 2 
(e.g., reflecting the organization’s risk management strategy within the enterprise ar-
chitecture and embedded information security architecture), risk management activities 
are also integrated into the system development life cycle of organizational informa-
tion systems at Tier 3. The risk management activities at Tier 3 reflect the organization’s 
risk management strategy and any risk related to the cost, schedule, and performance 
requirements for individual information systems supporting the mission/business

﻿
functions of organizations. Risk management activities take place at every phase in the 
system development life cycle with the outputs at each phase having an effect on subse-
quent phases.”4
So for assessing risk and the security controls used to control risk, an understanding of risk 
management within the organization is paramount to provide the right kind of assessment 
along with recommendations for risk mitigation.
RISK ASSESSMENTS
Within the risk construct that has been produced by the NIST, there are major criteria for 
risk assessments at every point within the life cycle of the information system under review. 
NIST SP 800-39 states this as follows: “The second component of risk management addresses 
how organizations assess risk within the context of the organizational risk frame. The purpose 
of the risk assessment component is to identify:
1.	 threats to organizations (i.e., operations, assets, or individuals) or threats directed 
through organizations against other organizations or the Nation;
2.	 vulnerabilities internal and external to organizations;
3.	 the harm (i.e., consequences/impact) to organizations that may occur given the potential 
for threats exploiting vulnerabilities; and
4.	 the likelihood that harm will occur. The end result is a determination of risk (i.e., the 
degree of harm and likelihood of harm occurring).
To support the risk assessment component, organizations identify:
1.	 the tools, techniques, and methodologies that are used to assess risk;
2.	 the assumptions related to risk assessments;
3.	 the constraints that may affect risk assessments;
4.	 roles and responsibilities;
5.	 how risk assessment information is collected, processed, and communicated throughout 
organizations;
6.	 how risk assessments are conducted within organizations;
7.	 the frequency of risk assessments; and 
8.	 how threat information is obtained (i.e., sources and methods).”5
There are many different ways to conduct risk assessments. The publisher of this book has 
several different books currently available on risk assessments and the methods for conduct-
ing them, so I will not attempt to add to those data. NIST has produced a guide to conducting 
risk assessments too under the NIST SP 800-30, rev. 1 publication.

Security controls

﻿
SECURITY CONTROLS
CNSSI 4009, the US government’s authoritative source of definitions within the security 
arena, defines security controls as: “The management, operational, and technical controls (i.e., 
safeguards or countermeasures) prescribed for an information system to protect the confiden-
tiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its information” and defines the assess-
ment of these controls as: “The testing and/or evaluation of the management, operational, 
and technical security controls to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented 
correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting 
the security requirements for an information system or organization.”6
So understanding the controls and their functions is of utmost value to both the asses-
sor and the organization. Within the risk community, there are several catalogs of security 
controls available. We will be examining the controls in this book from the NIST SP 800-53 
Control Catalog with its 18 areas of controls and from the ISO 27001 International Security 
Management Catalog with its 11 areas of controls. Chapters 8 and 9 delineate the controls, 
their requirements, and methods of assessment. Next we look at the legal and regulatory 
frameworks for security and the assessment requirements for security controls.

Statutory and Regulatory GRC
Today’s security world includes a major change from the past. All security and corporate 
managers now need to be concerned with compliance and governance of risks, security, and 
the information usage in their systems. These processes have evolved over the past 10 years 
into an area known as GRC. GRC is an acronym for governance, risk, and compliance and  
includes corporate considerations of risks, methods, and techniques for the gathering  
and evaluations of risks, and then reporting those identified risks to regulators, outside enti-
ties, and corporate Boards of Directors.
The standard statutory and regulatory order of precedence for US laws and regulations 
is not always easy to follow and understand. There are many levels of legal requirements 
throughout the security community. With the separation of national and state levels of laws, 
there are often conflicting legal and regulatory needs and reporting actions which need to be 
addressed and accounted for by the security and legal staff of an organization. All of these 
areas of the law lead to the GRC oversight and compliance reporting activities with which an 
organization must comply with or potentially face penalties, fines, or even incarceration of its 
corporate officers.
Generally, the US order of precedence for legal statutes and regulations is as follows:
1.	 Constitution
2.	 Public Law
3.	 Executive Orders (EOs) – Presidential Directives
4.	 Agency regulations
5.	 Industry best practices
There are, of course, deviations to these layers based on legal rulings and court findings. 
Each level of the precedence requires legal review and consultation, so always include your 
legal and compliance staff as you develop and produce your reports and conduct your secu-
rity business events.
STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS
As part of our review of the compliance and governance requirements before, during, and 
after security assessments, we will now explore the statutory laws which are currently in 
place for these efforts. Additionally, we will discuss the laws that were passed and since 

12	
3.  Statutory and Regulatory GRC
﻿
superceded which form the foundation of our current legal framework for assessments and 
auditing of security and components.
Privacy Act – 1974
We start with the first major piece of legislation passed in the United States that covered se-
curity and privacy, the Privacy Act of 1974, Public Law 95-579, 88 Statute 1896. The Privacy Act 
was designed to balance the US government’s need to maintain information about individu-
als with the rights of the individuals themselves. It focuses on four basic policy objectives:
• Restrict disclosure of individual’s personal data.
• Increase rights of access to agency records.
• Grant individuals the right to seek amendment to the records retained on them.
• Establish a code of fair information practices.
As the Privacy Act has been amended over the years since its original passage it now cov-
ers Personal Identifiable Information (PII).
CFAA – 1986
The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) – Title 18 U.S.C., Statute 1030 – is a law de-
signed to address legal and illegal access to federal and financial IT systems. It was intended 
to reduce cracking of computer systems and to address federal computer-related offenses. 
The CFAA is the actual federal law which makes it illegal to hack/crack a governmental com-
puting system. It deals with:
• Cases with a compelling federal interest
• Cases in which computers of the federal government or certain financial institutions are 
involved
• Cases in which the crime itself is interstate in nature
• Cases in which computers are used in interstate and foreign commerce
ECPA – 1986
The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) was passed in 1986 – Public Law 
99-508, Statute 1848 – and extends the government restrictions on wiretaps from telephone 
calls to include transmissions of electronic data by computer. The ECPA updated the Federal 
Wiretap Act of 1968, which addressed interception of conversations using “hard” telephone 
lines, but did not apply to interception of computer and other digital and electronic commu-
nications. Several subsequent pieces of legislation, including the USA PATRIOT Act, clarify 
and update the ECPA to keep pace with the evolution of new communications technologies 
and methods, including easing restrictions on law enforcement access to stored communica-
tions in some cases. The ECPA provisions are as follows:
• Title I of the ECPA, which is often referred to as the Wiretap Act, prohibits the intentional actual or at-
tempted interception, use, disclosure, or “procure[ment] [of] any other person to intercept or endeavor to 
intercept any wire, oral, or electronic communication.” Title I also prohibits the use of illegally obtained 
communications as evidence.

	
Statutory requirements	
13
﻿
• Title II of the ECPA, which is called the Stored Communications Act (SCA), protects the privacy of the con-
tents of files stored by service providers and of records held about the subscriber by service providers, such 
as subscriber name, billing records, or IP addresses.
• Title III of the ECPA, which addresses pen register and trap and trace devices, requires government entities 
to obtain a court order authorizing the installation and use of a pen register (a device that captures the di-
aled numbers and related information to which outgoing calls or communications are made by the subject) 
and/or a trap and trace (a device that captures the numbers and related information from which incoming 
calls and communications coming to the subject have originated). No actual communications are inter-
cepted by a pen register or trap and trace. The authorization order can be issued on the basis of certification 
by the applicant that the information likely to be obtained is relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation 
being conducted by the applicant’s agency. [1]
CSA – 1987
The Computer Security Act (CSA), Public Law 100-235, Title 101, Statute 1724, was designed 
to improve security and privacy of sensitive information in federal information system. Other 
provisions of the CSA included:
• Requires federal agencies to establish standards and guidelines under National Institute 
of Standards and Technology (NIST) direction and guidance
• Requires that any federal computer system that processes sensitive information have a 
customized security plan (System Security Authorization Agreement (SSAA))
• Requires that users of those systems undergo security training
• Requires NIST responsible, National Security Agency (NSA) to advise:
•	 Assessing the vulnerability of federal computer systems
•	 Developing standards
•	 Providing technical assistance with NSA support
•	 Developing training guidelines for federal personnel
CCA – 1996
The Information Technology Management Reform Act of 1996 – Public Law 104-106, Statute 
186 – has played a critical role in the development and evolution of federal security actions, 
activities, and statutes. This law, better known as the Clinger–Cohen Act (CCA), provided or 
included the following:
• Implemented the Capital Planning Investment Control (CPIC) IT budget planning 
process.
• Granted to the Director, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), authority to oversee 
the acquisition, use, and disposal of IT by the federal government.
• Established Chief Information Officer (CIO) positions in every department and agency in 
the federal government.
• Established the CIO council with 28 major agencies and OMB.
• Under this Act, OMB grades IT projects and funds accordingly – with an “at risk” category. 
The risk is not receiving initial or continuation funding for the project.
• Defines National Security Systems (NSS) as a system that:
•	 Involves intelligence activities
•	 Involves cryptologic activities related to national security

14	
3.  Statutory and Regulatory GRC
﻿
•	 Involves command and control of military forces
•	 Involves equipment that is an integral part of a weapon or weapon system
•	 Is critical to the direct fulfillment of military or intelligence missions
• Annual IT reporting to Congress.
     
• The CCA established the process within the federal government of creation and 
development of the standards and architectural requirements for security through 
the use of Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA) Reference Models and the attendant 
Information Types as currently found in SP 800-60. Defined an IT architecture (ITA) for 
evolving and acquiring IT through the use of Enterprise Architecture:
•	 FEA
•	 US Department of Defense (DOD) Architecture Framework (DODAF)
HIPAA – 1996
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) – Public Law 104-191, 10 Stat-
ute 1936 – enacted August 21, 1996, originally had Title I protecting health insurance cover-
age for workers and their families when they change or lose their jobs and Title II, known as 
the Administrative Simplification (AS) provisions, requiring the establishment of national 
standards for electronic health care transactions and national identifiers for providers, health 
insurance plans, and employers.
The effective compliance date of the updated HIPAA Privacy Rule was April 14, 2003, with 
a 1-year extension for certain “small plans.” The HIPAA Privacy Rule regulates the use and 
disclosure of protected health information (PHI) held by “covered entities.”
The regulatory part of the HIPAA Privacy Rule is explained later in this chapter; however, 
suffice to say that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has extended 
the HIPAA Privacy Rule to independent contractors of covered entities who fit within the 

	
Statutory requirements	
15
﻿
definition of “business associates.” This has led to the concept of “downstream liability”: for 
PHI and users of the extended PHI in the “covered entities” area. Now, PHI is any information 
held by a covered entity which concerns health status, provision of health care, or payment 
for health care that can be linked to an individual.
Cover entities can disclose PHI without a patient’s written authorization only to facilitate 
treatment, payment, or health care operations. Any other disclosures of PHI require the cov-
ered entity to obtain written authorization from the individual for the disclosure.
EEA – 1996
The Economic Espionage Act (EEA) of 1996 (Public Law 104-294, 110 Stat. 3488, enacted 
October 11, 1996) dealt with industrial espionage (e.g., the theft or misappropriation of a 
trade secret and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act), and four other ar-
eas of action that Congress deemed appropriate and the US Sentencing Commission reports 
regarding encryption or scrambling technology, and other technical and minor amendments:
• Covers trade secrets and economic espionage.
• Most uses have been in trade secret area.
• First criminal prosecution under espionage part performed in 2010.
• Economic espionage: Criminalizes the misappropriation of trade secrets (including 
conspiracy to misappropriate trade secrets and the subsequent acquisition of such 
misappropriated trade secrets) with the knowledge or intent that the theft will benefit 
a foreign power. Penalties for violation are fines of up to US$500,000 per offense and 
imprisonment of up to 15 years for individuals, and fines of up to US$10 million for 
organizations.
• Theft of trade secrets: Criminalizes the misappropriation of trade secrets related to or 
included in a product that is produced for or placed in interstate (including international) 
commerce, with the knowledge or intent that the misappropriation will injure the owner 
of the trade secret. Penalties for violation of section 1832 are imprisonment for up to 
10 years for individuals (no fines) and fines of up to US$5 million for organizations.
• The term “trade secret” means all forms and types of financial, business, scientific, 
technical, economic, or engineering information, including patterns, plans, compilations, 
program devices, formulas, designs, prototypes, methods, techniques, processes, 
procedures, programs, or codes, whether tangible or intangible, and whether or 
how stored, compiled, or memorialized physically, electronically, graphically, 
photographically, or in writing if:
•	 The owner thereof has taken reasonable measures to keep such information secret.
•	 The information derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not 
being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable through proper means 
by, the public.
• The Act can be employed to accomplish several purposes:
•	 It can be used to protect a company’s valuable intellectual property by prosecuting 
dishonest competitors who steal a company’s trade secrets.
•	 It can also be used against a company that finds itself with trade secrets belonging to a 
competitor.

GISRA – 1998
Government Information Security Reform Act (GISRA) – Floyd D. Spence National De-
fense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001. Title X, Subtitle G – Government Information Secu-
rity Reform Act (GISRA), Public Law 106-398, passed October 30, 2000. This Act:
• Established roles and responsibilities for information security, risk management, testing, 
and training
• Authorized NIST and NSA to provide guidance for security planning:
•	 This resulted in several DOD Directives and the Federal Information Processing 
Standards (FIPS) 102 process which has now been replaced with the Federal 
Information Security Management Act (FISMA) process described in NIST SP  
800-37.
• Had a 2-year sunset clause
• Required agencies to perform periodic threat-based risk assessments for systems and 
data
• Required agencies to develop and implement risk-based, cost-effective policies and 
procedures to provide security protection for information collected or maintained either 
by the agency or for it by another agency or contractor
• Required that agencies develop a process for ensuring that remedial action is taken to 
address significant deficiencies
• Required agencies to report annually to the OMB on the security of their information 
systems and to make information system security part of their regular process of doing 
business (e.g., in budget requests)
Except for the new annual program reviews, the role of the agency Inspector General, 
and the annual reporting requirement, the Act essentially codifies the existing require-
ments of OMB Circular No. A-130, App. III, “Security of Federal Automated Information 
Resources.”
USA PATRIOT Act – 2001
Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept 
and Obstruct Terrorism Act – Public Law 107-56, 115 Statute 252. Passed as a result of the 9-11 
terrorist acts on the United States, the USA PATROIT Act provided for the following security-
related activities:
• Amended the definition of “electronic surveillance” to exclude the interception of 
communications done through or from a protected computer where the owner allows the 
interception, or is lawfully involved in an investigation.
• Secret Service jurisdiction was extended to investigate computer fraud, access device 
frauds, false identification documents or devices, or any fraudulent activities against US 
financial institutions.
• Specified the development and support of cybersecurity forensic capabilities:
•	 Directs the Attorney General to establish regional computer forensic laboratories that 
have the capability of performing forensic examinations of intercepted computer 
evidence relating to criminal activity and cyberterrorism, and that have the capability

• National Security Letter (NSL):
•	 It is a demand letter issued to a particular entity or organization to turn over various 
records and data pertaining to individuals. They require no probable cause or judicial 
oversight and also contain a gag order, preventing the recipient of the letter from 
disclosing that the letter was ever issued.
•	 Can order “requiring the production of any tangible things (including books, 
records, papers, documents, and other items) for an investigation to protect against 
international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities, provided that such 
investigation of a United States person is not conducted solely upon the basis of 
activities protected by the first amendment to the Constitution”
• Redefined money laundering to:
•	 Include making a financial transaction in the United States in order to commit a 
violent crime
•	 The bribery of public officials and fraudulent dealing with public funds
•	 The smuggling or illegal export of controlled munition and the importation or 
bringing in of any firearm or ammunition not authorized by the US Attorney  
General
•	 The smuggling of any item controlled under the Export Administration 
Regulations
• Roving wiretaps are wiretap orders that do not need to specify all common carriers and 
third parties in a surveillance court order.
• Information sharing for critical infrastructure protection:
•	 Increase the ability of US law enforcement to counter terrorist activity that crosses 
jurisdictional boundaries
FISMA – 2002
The FISMA – Title III of E-Government Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-347) – passed in February 
2002 provides the following:
• OMB has oversight over E-government:
•	 Federal government (organizations and IGs) must report Information Assurance (IA) 
status to OMB annually and quarterly.
•	 OMB provides reports to Congress annually.
•	 Congressional Security Grade (originally known as the FISMA score, this is now 
known as the Cybersecurity Grade).
• NIST publishes standards and guidelines; NSA serves as Technical Advisor.
• Requires all federal agencies, besides DOD and the IC, to conduct reviews and 
accreditations for their information systems on a periodic basis (every 3 years) and a 
select subset of security controls to be reviewed annually. All of the federal government 
must follow the NIST-defined C&A processes, with the exception of defense and 
intelligence organizations.

Sarbanes–Oxley – 2002
The Sarbanes–Oxley Act (SOX) – Public Law 107-204, 116 Statute 745 – was passed in 
July 2002. This Act set in place the revised standards for risk, operations, accounting and 
reporting, compliance, and governance for all US public company boards of directors, man-
agement, and public accounting firms. The SOX was enacted as a result of several major 
corporate scandals during the late 1990s including Enron, Tyco, and WorldCom. As a result 
of SOX, top management must now individually certify the accuracy of financial infor-
mation. Additionally, penalties for fraudulent financial activity are much more severe and  
there is now a requirement for increased oversight by the corporate boards of directors  
and the independence of the outside auditors who review the accuracy of corporate finan-
cial statements.
The SOX contains 11 titles, or sections, ranging from additional corporate board respon-
sibilities to criminal penalties, and requires the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) 
to implement rulings on requirements to comply with the law. The SOX also created a new, 
quasi-public agency, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), which is 
charged with overseeing, regulating, inspecting, and disciplining accounting firms in their 
roles as auditors of public companies. The SOX also covers issues such as auditor indepen-
dence, corporate governance, internal control assessment, and enhanced financial disclosure 
as follows:
• Addressed specific areas such as:
•	 Top management must individually certify the accuracy of financial in­for­
mation.
•	 Provided for penalties for fraudulent financial activity which are much more severe 
than previously listed and legalized.
•	 Increased the independence of the outside auditors who review the accuracy of 
corporate financial statements.
•	 Increased the oversight role of boards of directors.
• SOX reporting criteria:
•	 Assess both the design and the operating effectiveness of selected internal controls 
related to significant accounts and relevant assertions, in the context of material 
misstatement risks.
•	 Understand the flow of transactions, including IT aspects, in sufficient detail to 
identify points at which a misstatement could arise.
•	 Evaluate company-level (entity-level) controls, which correspond to the components 
of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) 
framework.
•	 Perform a fraud risk assessment.
•	 Evaluate controls designed to prevent or detect fraud, including management  
override of controls.
•	 Evaluate controls over the period-end financial reporting process.
•	 Scale the assessment based on the size and complexity of the company.
•	 Rely on management’s work based on factors such as competency, objectivity,  
and risk.
•	 Conclude on the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting.

Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act – 2009
The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act is Title XIII 
of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). The HITECH 
Act set meaningful use of interoperable electronic health record (EHR) adoption in the health 
care system as a critical national goal and incentivized EHR adoption. HITECH introduced a 
refinement of the Meaningful Use concept to health care in the United States. The main com-
ponents of Meaningful Use are as follows:
• The use of a certified EHR in a meaningful manner, such as e-prescribing
• The use of certified EHR technology for electronic exchange of health information to 
improve quality of health care
• The use of certified EHR technology to submit clinical quality and other measures
The Meaningful Use of EHRs intended by the US government incentives is categorized as 
follows:
• Improve care coordination.
• Reduce health care disparities.
• Engage patients and their families.
• Improve population and public health.
• Ensure adequate privacy and security.
The HITECH Act requires HIPAA-covered entities to report data breaches affecting 500 
or more individuals to HHS and the media, in addition to notifying the affected individuals. 
This Act extends the complete privacy and security provisions of HIPAA to business asso-
ciates of covered entities. This includes the extension of newly updated civil and criminal 
penalties to business associates. As explained in the section “HIPAA – 1996,” this introduced 
the “downstream liability” legal concept to health care and medical providers. These changes 
are also required to be included in any business associate agreements with covered entities.
Another significant change brought about in Subtitle D of the HITECH Act is the new 
breach notification requirements. This imposes new notification requirements on covered en-
tities, business associates, vendors of personal health records (PHRs), and related entities if 
a breach of unsecured PHI occurs. Both HHS and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) were 
required under the HITECH Act to issue regulations associated with the new breach notifi-
cation requirements and they did so with the HHS rule published in the Federal Register on 
August 24, 2009, and the FTC rule published on August 25, 2009.
EXECUTIVE ORDERS/PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVES
The Executive Office of the President derives its authority from the Constitution. It has 
issued several EOs and directives (Presidential Policy Directive (PPD)/Homeland Security 
Presidential Directive (HSPD)/National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD)) to order pro-
tection of critical national assets. There are three current types of these documents:
• PPD
• HSPD

There are multiple documents of relevance to security testing. These include:
• EO 12958: Classified National Security Information (1995) – Created new standards for the 
process of identifying and protecting classified information, and led to an unprecedented 
effort to declassify millions of pages from the US diplomatic and national security history. 
When issued in 1995, set the National Archives and Records Agency director (otherwise 
known as the Chief Archivist of the US government) as the definitive authority to 
declassify data outside of DOD.
• EO 13228: Establishing the Office of Homeland Security and the HS Council (2001) – Initiates a 
comprehensive strategy to secure the United States from terrorist attacks.
• EO 13231: Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) in the Information Age (October 2001) – States 
policy to protect critical infrastructure against compromise. Established the following:
•	 Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS), combination of two previous 
national security committees:
-	 National Security Telecommunications and Information Systems Security 
Committee (NSTISSC)
-	 National Computer Security Committee (NCSC)
• Chaired by DOD CIO:
•	 Issues policies, directives, instructions, and advisory memorandums related to NSS
• EO 13526: Classified National Security Information – 2009:
•	 Sets a uniform system for classifying, safeguarding, and declassifying national 
security information, including information relating to defense against transnational 
terrorism.
•	 Added fourth unclassified data type – Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI).
• It revokes and replaces the previous EOs in effect for this, which were EO 12958 and 
EO 13292.
• EO 13636: Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity – 2013:
•	 Designed to assist critical infrastructure companies improve cybersecurity practices 
through the NIST Cybersecurity Framework development
•	 Increases volume, timeliness, and quality of cyber-threat information sharing
• HSPD-7: Homeland Security Directive 7 (2003) – Directs the identification and  
prioritization of Critical Infrastructure (CI) assets and key resources to protect them from 
terrorist attacks. Supersedes PDD-63.
• HSPD-12: Homeland Security Directive 12 (2004) – Directs a common identification 
standard that is “secure and reliable” to verify employee identity. It further specified 
secure and reliable identification that:
•	 Is issued based on sound criteria for verifying an individual employee’s identity
•	 Is strongly resistant to identity fraud, tampering, counterfeiting, and terrorist 
exploitation
•	 Can be rapidly authenticated electronically
•	 Is issued only by providers whose reliability has been established by an official 
accreditation

FEDERAL PROCESSING STANDARDS
Under the Information Technology Management Reform Act (Public Law 104-106), 
the Secretary of Commerce approves standards and guidelines that are developed by 
the NIST for federal computer systems. These standards and guidelines are issued by 
NIST as FIPS for use government-wide. NIST develops FIPS when there are compelling 
federal government requirements such as for security and interoperability and there are 
no acceptable industry standards or solutions. Under Section 5131 of the Information  

22	
3.  Statutory and Regulatory GRC
﻿
Technology Management Reform Act of 1996 and the FISMA of 2002 (Public Law 107-
347), NIST develops standards, guidelines, and associated methods and techniques for 
federal computer systems:
• Including those needed to assure the cost-effective security and privacy of sensitive 
information in federal computer systems
• When there are compelling federal requirements and there are no existing voluntary 
industry standards
The FISMA does not include a statutory provision allowing agencies to waive the provi-
sions of mandatory FIPS. Waivers approved by the head of agencies had been allowed under 
the CSA, which was superseded by FISMA. Therefore, the waiver procedures included in 
many FIPS are no longer in effect. The applicability sections of each FIPS should be reviewed 
to determine if the FIPS is mandatory for agency use. FIPS do not apply to NSS (as defined in 
Title III, Information Security, of FISMA).
FIPS-140 – Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules
This standard specifies the security requirements that will be satisfied by a cryptographic module utilized 
within a security system protecting sensitive but unclassified information (hereafter referred to as sensitive 
information). The standard provides four increasing, qualitative levels of security: Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, 
and Level 4.
These levels are intended to cover the wide range of potential applications and environments in which 
cryptographic modules may be employed. The security requirements cover areas related to the secure 
design and implementation of a cryptographic module. These areas include cryptographic module speci-
fication, cryptographic module ports and interfaces; roles, services, and authentication; finite state model; 
physical security; operational environment; cryptographic key management; electromagnetic interfer-
ence/electromagnetic compatibility (EMI/EMC); self-tests; design assurance; and mitigation of other at-
tacks.1
FIPS-186 – Digital Signature Standard (DSS)
This Standard specifies algorithms for applications requiring a digital signature, rather than a written 
signature. A digital signature is represented in a computer as a string of bits. A digital signature is computed 
using a set of rules and a set of parameters that allow the identity of the signatory and the integrity of the data 
to be verified. Digital signatures may be generated on both stored and transmitted data.
Signature generation uses a private key to generate a digital signature; signature verification uses a pub-
lic key that corresponds to, but is not the same as, the private key. Each signatory possesses a private and 
public key pair. Public keys may be known by the public; private keys are kept secret. Anyone can verify the 
signature by employing the signatory’s public key. Only the user that possesses the private key can perform 
signature generation.
A hash function is used in the signature generation process to obtain a condensed version of the data  
to be signed; the condensed version of the data is often called a message digest. The message digest is input to 
the digital signature algorithm to generate the digital signature. The hash functions to be used are specified in 
the Secure Hash Standard (SHS), FIPS 180. FIPS approved digital signature algorithms shall be used with an 
appropriate hash function that is specified in the SHS.
1FIPS-140-2, p. iii.

	
Federal processing standards	
23
﻿
The digital signature is provided to the intended verifier along with the signed data. The verifying entity 
verifies the signature by using the claimed signatory’s public key and the same hash function that was used 
to generate the signature. Similar procedures may be used to generate and verify signatures for both stored 
and transmitted data.2
A digital signature algorithm allows an entity to authenticate the integrity of signed data 
and the identity of the signatory. The recipient of a signed message can use a digital signa-
ture as evidence in demonstrating to a third party that the signature was, in fact, generated 
by the claimed signatory. This is known as nonrepudiation, since the signatory cannot easily 
repudiate the signature at a later time. A digital signature algorithm is intended for use in 
electronic mail, electronic funds transfer, electronic data interchange, software distribution, 
data storage, and other applications that require data integrity assurance and data origin 
authentication.
FIPS-190 – Guideline for the Use of Advanced Authentication Technology 
Alternatives
This guideline describes the primary alternative methods for verifying the identities of 
computer system users, and provides recommendations to federal agencies and departments 
for the acquisition and use of technology which supports these methods. Although the tradi-
tional approach to authentication relies primarily on passwords, it is clear that password-only 
authentication often fails to provide an adequate level of protection. Stronger authentication 
techniques become increasingly more important as information processing evolves toward 
an open system environment. Modern technology has produced authentication tokens and 
biometric devices which are reliable, practical, and cost-effective. Passwords, tokens, and bio-
metrics can be used in various combinations to provide far greater assurance in the authenti-
cation process than can be attained with passwords alone.
FIPS-191 – Guideline for the Analysis Local Area Network Security
This FIPS standard covers the security objectives of confidentiality, integrity, availability, 
and nonrepudiation.
The following goals should be considered to implement effective LAN security.
• Maintain the confidentiality of data as it is stored, processed or transmitted on a LAN;
• Maintain the integrity of data as it is stored, processed or transmitted on a LAN;
• Maintain the availability of data stored on a LAN, as well as the ability to process and transmit the data in 
a timely fashion;
• Ensure the identity of the sender and receiver of a message;
Adequate LAN security requires the proper combination of security policies and procedures, technical 
controls, user training and awareness, and contingency planning. While all of these areas are critical to pro-
vide adequate protection, the focus of this document is on the technical controls that can be utilized.3

FIPS-199 – Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information  
and Information Systems
FIPS-199 addresses the task defined in FISMA for all federal agencies to develop stan-
dards for categorizing information and information systems. It defines three levels of poten-
tial impact on organizations or individuals should there be a breach of security (i.e., a loss of 
confidentiality, integrity, or availability). The application of these definitions must take place 
within the context of each organization and the overall national interest.
Security categorization standards for information and information systems provide a common framework 
and understanding for expressing security that, for the federal government, promotes:
(i)	 Effective management and oversight of information security programs, including the coordination of in-
formation security efforts throughout the civilian, national security, emergency preparedness, homeland 
security, and law enforcement communities; and
(ii)	 Consistent reporting to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Congress on the adequacy and 
effectiveness of information security policies, procedures, and practices.
This publication establishes security categories for both information1 and information systems. The secu-
rity categories are based on the potential impact on an organization should certain events occur which jeopar-
dize the information and information systems needed by the organization to accomplish its assigned mission, 
protect its assets, fulfill its legal responsibilities, maintain its day-to-day functions, and protect individuals. 
Security categories are to be used in conjunction with vulnerability and threat information in assessing the 
risk to an organization.4
Determining the security category of an information system requires slightly more analy-
sis and must consider the security categories of all information types resident on the informa-
tion system. For an information system, the potential impact values assigned to the respective 
security objectives (confidentiality, integrity, availability) shall be the highest values (i.e., high 
water mark (HWM)) from among those security categories that have been determined for 
each type of information resident on the information system.
FIPS-200 – Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information 
and Information Systems
FIPS-200 specifies minimum security requirements for information and information systems supporting 
the executive agencies of the federal government and a risk-based process for selecting the security controls 
necessary to satisfy the minimum security requirements. This standard will promote the development, imple-
mentation, and operation of more secure information systems within the federal government by establishing 
minimum levels of due diligence for information security and facilitating a more consistent, comparable, and 
repeatable approach for selecting and specifying security controls for information systems that meet mini-
mum security requirements.5
The minimum security requirements cover various security-related areas with regard 
to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of federal information systems

﻿
and the information processed, stored, and transmitted by those systems. The 17 areas rep-
resent a broad-based, balanced information security program that addresses the manage-
ment, operational, and technical aspects of protecting federal information and information 
systems.
Policies and procedures play an important role in the effective implementation of 
­enterprise-wide information security programs within the federal government and the suc-
cess of the resulting security measures employed to protect federal information and informa-
tion systems. Thus, organizations must develop and promulgate formal, documented policies 
and procedures governing the minimum security requirements set forth in this standard and 
must ensure their effective implementation.
FIPS-200 continues with listing the standard security control families as defined in SP 
­800-53 for use in the minimum security baselines, which we will discuss in Chapter 9.
FIPS-201 – Personal Identity Verification of Federal Employees and 
Contractors
FIPS-201 specifies the architecture and technical requirements for a common identification standard for 
Federal employees and contractors. The overall goal is to achieve appropriate security assurance for multiple 
applications by efficiently verifying the claimed identity of individuals seeking physical access to federally 
controlled government facilities and logical access to government information systems.
The Standard contains the minimum requirements for a Federal personal identity verification system that 
meets the control and security objectives of Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 [HSPD-12], includ-
ing identity proofing, registration, and issuance. The Standard also provides detailed specifications that will 
support technical interoperability among PIV systems of Federal departments and agencies. It describes the 
card elements, system interfaces, and security controls required to securely store, process, and retrieve iden-
tity credentials from the card.6
The FIPS-201 continues with listing all of the NIST Special Publications which are related 
to the standard including:
1.	 SP 800-73
2.	 SP 800-76
3.	 SP 800-78
4.	 SP 800-79
5.	 SP 800-87
6.	 SP 800-96
7.	 SP 800-156
8.	 SP 800-157
FIPS-201 stipulates a PIV card must be personalized with identity information for the indi-
vidual to whom the card is issued, in order to perform identity verification by both humans 
and automated systems. Humans can use the physical card for visual comparisons, whereas 
automated systems can use the electronically stored data on the card to conduct automated 
identity verification.

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS
Each agency of the US government which has oversight authority for industry activities 
provides regulatory guidance to those organizations, either public or private, in various 
forms and methods. We will briefly discuss the applicable regulations here which are relevant 
to security controls and testing.
DOD
The DOD has a long and detailed history of providing guidance and regulatory direction 
for security of its systems and methods. It started this process in the 1970s and 1980s with the 
initial issuance of DOD 5200 series of publications. These documents initially focused on pro-
viding guidance on the security objective of confidentiality on large-scale, mainframe-based 
systems. Various DOD agencies have provided these documents and regulations including 
the NSA, Defense Information Assurance Program (DIAP) Office, Defense Information Sys-
tems Agency (DISA), and the DOD CIO Office and, for the most part, are available at the De-
fense Technical Information Center (DTIC) (http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/) site. Recently (March 
2014), DOD has moved all assessment and authorization criteria over to the NIST-based Risk 
Management Framework (RMF) with some defense-related modifications. Current DOD reg-
ulations now reflect the same requirements as the NIST-based documentation and standards 
for all assessment actions. The primary regulatory guidance currently in use at DOD under the 
cybersecurity series are the 8500 series of instructions and manuals.
DOD Instruction (DODI) 8500.01 – Cybersecurity:
DOD will implement a multi-tiered cybersecurity risk management process to protect U.S. interests, DOD 
operational capabilities, and DOD individuals, organizations, and assets from the DOD Information Enter-
prise level, through the DOD Component level, down to the Information Security (IS) level as described in 
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-39 and Committee on 
National Security Systems (CNSS) Policy (CNSSP) 22.7
This regulatory policy provides guidance to DOD agencies and entities in the following 
areas:
  1.	 Risk management
  2.	 Operational resilience
  3.	 Integration and interoperability
  4.	 Cyberspace defense
  5.	 Performance
  6.	 DOD information
  7.	 Identity assurance
  8.	 Information technology
  9.	 Cybersecurity workforce
10.	 Mission partners

DODI 8510.01 – Risk Management Framework (RMF) for DOD Information Technology (IT):
This instruction policy document implements the NIST-developed RMF by 
establishing the RMF for DOD IT, establishing associated cybersecurity policy, and 
assigning responsibilities for executing and maintaining the RMF. The RMF replaces 
the DOD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP) and 
manages the life-cycle cybersecurity risk to DOD IT.
This document is the singular one which resets all of DOD over to the RMF from 
the previous methods of certification and accreditation known as DIACAP and DOD 
Information Technology Security Certification and Accreditation Process (DITSCAP). All 
activities for assessments and authorizations of DOD IT systems are now to be performed 
utilizing the NIST approach as defined in SP 800-37, rev. 1 and in accordance with DOD 
supplemental guidance and the CNSS Instruction (CNSSI)-1253.
CNSS
The CNSS sets US government–level information assurance policies, directives, instruc-
tions, operational procedures, guidance, and advisories for US government departments and 
agencies for the security of NSS. It consists of representation from 21 US government execu-
tive branch departments and agencies. In addition to the 21 Members, there are represen-
tatives serving as Observers from 14 additional organizations. The CNSS provides a forum 
for the discussion of policy issues; sets national policy; and promulgates direction, operation-
al procedures, and guidance for the security of NSS. The CNSS stated mission is: “The CNSS 
is directed to assure the security of NSS against technical exploitation by providing: reliable 
and continuing assessments of threats and vulnerabilities and implementation of effective 
countermeasures; a technical base within the USG to achieve this security; and support from 
the private sector to enhance that technical base assuring that information systems security 
products are available to secure NSS” [2].
NSS are information systems operated by the US government, its contractors, or agents 
that contain classified information or that:
• Involve intelligence activities
• Involve cryptographic activities related to national security
• Involve command and control of military forces
• Involve equipment that is an integral part of a weapon or weapon system(s)
• Are critical to the direct fulfillment of military or intelligence missions (not including 
routine administrative and business applications)
The primary documents of interest to assessors and testers from CNSS are the following:
CNSSI 1253 – Security Categorization and Control Selection for National Security Systems:
This instruction provides all federal government departments, agencies, bureaus, and 
offices with guidance on the first two steps of the RMF, categorize and select, for NSS. 
Additionally, this instruction provides NSS guidance in the following four areas:
• This instruction does not adopt the HWM concept from FIPS-200 for categorizing 
information systems.

28	
3.  Statutory and Regulatory GRC
﻿
•	 The definitions for moderate and high impact are refined from those provided in  
FIPS-199.
•	 The associations of confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability to security controls are 
explicitly defined in this instruction.
•	 The use of security control overlays is refined in this instruction for the national 
security community.
This instruction has been explicitly specified by DOD under DODI 8510.01 as the 
definite guide for categorization of all DOD IT systems, NSS and non-NSS.
CNSSP 22 – Policy on Information Assurance Risk Management for National Security Systems:
This policy document requires the implementation of an integrated organization-
wide program for managing IA risk to organizational operations (i.e., mission, 
functions, and reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and 
the nation resulting from the operation and use of NSS. On adoption of this CNSSP 
No. 22 in January 2012, CNSS Policy No. 6, “National Policy on Certification and 
Accreditation of National Security Systems,” dated October 2005, and National Security 
Telecommunications and Information Systems Security Instruction (NSTISSI) 1000, 
“National Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (NIACAP),” 
dated April 2000, were cancelled.
This policy states the following:
It is the CNSS policy that all organizations that own, operate, or maintain NSS ensure organizational op-
erations by establishing and implementing an IA risk management program for their NSS that will:
a.	 Establish a risk executive (function) to ensure the program is consistent with the provisions of NIST Spe-
cial Publication (SP) 800-39; provide guidance to and oversight of the organization’s risk management 
program and development of the risk management strategy; communicate organization-wide threat, vul-
nerability, and risk-related information; and provide a strategic view for managing IA risk throughout the 
organization.
b.	 Establish processes to identify IA risks from an organization-wide perspective; determine which risks are 
acceptable; achieve operational effectiveness by selecting, implementing, and assessing safeguards and 
countermeasures to adequately mitigate unacceptable risks; and take any additional corrective actions as 
necessary.
c.	 Establish processes to deploy security controls throughout the organization consistent with its enterprise 
architecture, taking advantage of the common control concept as described in NIST SP 800-37 to cost-
effectively implement IA security controls within the organization.
d.	 Establish processes to develop and maintain existing organizational policies and procedures to integrate 
IA risk management throughout the information system lifecycle (e.g., acquisition, design, development, 
integration, distribution, operation, maintenance, and retirement).8

The US HHS, Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Office for Civil Rights en-
forces the HIPAA Privacy Rule, which protects the privacy of individually identifiable health 
information; the HIPAA Security Rule, which sets national standards for the security of

electronic PHI; the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule, which requires covered entities and busi-
ness associates to provide notification following a breach of unsecured PHI; and the confiden-
tiality provisions of the Patient Safety Rule, which protect identifiable information being used 
to analyze patient safety events and improve patient safety.
HIPAA Security Rule
The Security Rule requires covered entities to maintain reasonable and appropriate administrative, techni-
cal, and physical safeguards for protecting e-PHI.
Specifically, covered entities must:
• Ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all e-PHI they create, receive, maintain or transmit;
• Identify and protect against reasonably anticipated threats to the security or integrity of the information;
• Protect against reasonably anticipated, impermissible uses or disclosures; and
• Ensure compliance by their workforce.
The Security Rule defines “confidentiality” to mean that e-PHI is not available or disclosed to unauthor-
ized persons. The Security Rule’s confidentiality requirements support the Privacy Rule’s prohibitions against 
improper uses and disclosures of PHI. The Security rule also promotes the two additional goals of maintain-
ing the integrity and availability of e-PHI. Under the Security Rule, “integrity” means that e-PHI is not altered 
or destroyed in an unauthorized manner. “Availability” means that e-PHI is accessible and usable on demand 
by an authorized person.
HHS recognizes that covered entities range from the smallest provider to the largest, multi-state health 
plan. Therefore the Security Rule is flexible and scalable to allow covered entities to analyze their own needs 
and implement solutions appropriate for their specific environments. What is appropriate for a particular 
covered entity will depend on the nature of the covered entity’s business, as well as the covered entity’s size 
and resources.
Therefore, when a covered entity is deciding which security measures to use, the Rule does not dictate 
those measures but requires the covered entity to consider:
• Its size, complexity, and capabilities,
• Its technical, hardware, and software infrastructure,
• The costs of security measures, and
• The likelihood and possible impact of potential risks to e-PHI.
Covered entities must review and modify their security measures to continue protecting e-PHI in a chang-
ing environment. [3]
HIPAA Privacy Rule
The Privacy Rule protects all “individually identifiable health information” held or transmitted by a cov-
ered entity or its business associate, in any form or media, whether electronic, paper, or oral. The Privacy Rule 
calls this information “protected health information (PHI).”
“Individually identifiable health information” is information, including demographic data, that relates to:
• The individual’s past, present or future physical or mental health or condition,
• The provision of health care to the individual, or
• The past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care to the individual, and that identifies the 
individual or for which there is a reasonable basis to believe can be used to identify the individual.
Individually identifiable health information includes many common identifiers (e.g., name, address, birth 
date, Social Security Number).
The Privacy Rule excludes from protected health information employment records that a covered entity 
maintains in its capacity as an employer and education and certain other records subject to, or defined in, the 
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. [4]

HITECH Breach Reporting
The HIPAA Breach Notification Rule, 45 CFR §§ 164.400-414, requires HIPAA covered entities and their 
business associates to provide notification following a breach of unsecured protected health information. 
Similar breach notification provisions implemented and enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), 
apply to vendors of personal health records and their third party service providers, pursuant to section 13407 
of the HITECH Act.
Protected health information (PHI) is rendered unusable, unreadable, or indecipherable to unauthorized 
individuals if one or more of the following applies:
1.	 Electronic PHI has been encrypted as specified in the HIPAA Security Rule by “the use of an algorithmic 
process to transform data into a form in which there is a low probability of assigning meaning without use 
of a confidential process or key” (45 CFR 164.304 definition of encryption) and such confidential process 
or key that might enable decryption has not been breached. To avoid a breach of the confidential  
process or key, these decryption tools should be stored on a device or at a location separate from the data 
they are used to encrypt or decrypt. The encryption processes identified below have been tested by the 
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and judged to meet this standard.
(i)	 Valid encryption processes for data at rest are consistent with NIST Special Publication 800-111, Guide 
to Storage Encryption Technologies for End User Devices
(ii)	 Valid encryption processes for data in motion are those which comply, as appropriate, with NIST 
Special Publications 800-52, Guidelines for the Selection and Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) 
Implementations; 800-77, Guide to IPsec VPNs; or 800-113, Guide to SSL VPNs, or others which are 
Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 140-2 validated
2.	 The media on which the PHI is stored or recorded has been destroyed in one of the following ways:
(i)	 Paper, film, or other hard copy media have been shredded or destroyed such that the PHI cannot be read 
or otherwise cannot be reconstructed. Redaction is specifically excluded as a means of data destruction.
(ii)	 Electronic media have been cleared, purged, or destroyed consistent with NIST Special Publication 
800-88, Guidelines for Media Sanitization such that the PHI cannot be retrieved. [5]
OMB REQUIREMENTS FOR EACH AGENCY
OMB evaluates expenditure effectiveness, and provides oversight of administration pro-
curement, fiscal management, information management, and regulatory policy. It issues two 
types of relevant documents:
1.	 Circulars
2.	 Memorandums
Over the past 15 years, OMB has often provided guidance and direction to federal agencies 
for security activities through these two types of issuances. I will highlight some of the more 
prevalent ones here, but always review all issuances for applicability before starting your as-
sessment.
Circulars:
1.	 A-130, Appendix III:
a.	 Security for Federal Information Systems.
b.	Requires executive branch agencies:
-	 Plan for security.
-	 Ensure appropriate officials are assigned with security responsibility.
-	 Review security controls for systems.

	
OMB requirements for each agency	
31
﻿
-	 Authorized system processing prior to operations and periodically thereafter – 
defines this as every 3 years.
c.	 Defines “adequate security” as:
-	 “Security commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the harm resulting  
from the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or modification of information 
… provide appropriate confidentiality, integrity, and availability, through the  
use of cost-effective management, personnel, operational, and technical  
controls.”
d.	Requires accreditation of federal IS to operate based on an assessment on 
management, operational, and technical controls.
e.	 Defines two types of federal systems:
-	 Major Application (MA):
(i)	 An application that requires special attention to security due to the risk and 
magnitude of the harm resulting from the loss, misuse, or unauthorized 
access to or modification of the information in the application.
(ii)	All federal applications require some level of protection. Certain applications, 
because of the information in them, however, require special management 
oversight and should be treated as major. Adequate security for other 
applications should be provided by security of the systems in which they 
operate.
-	 General Support System (GSS):
(i)	 An interconnected set of information resources under the same direct 
management control which shares common functionality. A system 
normally includes hardware, software, information, data, applications, 
communications, and people.
(ii)	A system can be, for example, a local area network (LAN) including smart 
terminals that supports a branch office, an agency-wide backbone, a 
communications network, a departmental data processing center including 
its operating system and utilities, a tactical radio network, or a shared 
information processing service organization (IPSO), such as a service 
provider.
f.	 Remains a crucial component of the overall cybersecurity body of regulations. Last 
updated in 2000, it requires or specifies:
-	 Risk-based approach to assess and react to threat and vulnerabilities
-	 Security plans and identification and correction of deficiencies
-	 Incident Response capabilities
-	 Interruption planning and continuity support
-	 Technical controls consistent with NIST guidance
-	 Periodic review of status and controls
-	 Information sharing (MA only) and public access controls
-	 Responsibility assignment
-	 Periodic reporting of operational and security status
Memorandums:
1.	 M-02-01 – Guidance for Preparing and Submitting Security Plans of Action and Milestones 
(October 2001): OMB has always viewed POAMs as a budget document because of 

32	
3.  Statutory and Regulatory GRC
﻿
the resource allocations associated with fixes and repairs. Therefore, OMB tracks all 
POAMs and requires agencies to report the status of these periodically.
a.	 POAMs contain:
-	 Weaknesses
-	 Point Of Contact (POC)
-	 Resources required
-	 Scheduled completion date
-	 Milestones with completion dates
-	 Changes to milestones
-	 How weakness was identified
-	 Current status
b.	POAM is living document – nothing deleted, just updated. The POAM register 
stays with the system as long as the system is active.
2.	 M04-04 – e-Authentication Guidance for Federal Agencies:
a.	 Requires “e-Authentication” Risk assessments for all electronic transactions
b.	Defines criteria for access to federal services online
c.	 Especially relevant to assessors since there are specific levels of authentication 
required for systems and agencies which need to be verified and assessed
3.	 M06-15 – Safeguarding PII:
a.	 Requires privacy policies for each agency and the public release of these policies
4.	 M06-19 – PII Reporting:
a.	 Requires reporting of potential PII data breach events to federal CERT within 1 h of 
discovery of breach
5.	 M07-16 – Safeguarding Against and Responding to the Breach of Personally Identifiable 
Information:
a.	 Requires a public Breach Notification Policy for each agency
b.	Requires an agency-based Incident Handling Policy
6.	 M10-15 – FY 2010 Reporting Instructions for the Federal Information Security Management 
Act and Agency Privacy Management:
a.	 This memorandum set in place the continuous monitoring criteria for all agencies 
which has resulted in the NIST SP 800-137 and various continuous monitoring 
programs across the US governmental agencies.
7.	 M10-28 – Clarifying Cybersecurity Responsibilities and Activities of the Executive Office of 
the President and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS):
a.	 Sets OMB as reporting agency and DHS as gathering agency for cybersecurity data 
and events
8.	 M14-03 and M14-04:
a.	 Both cover security of federal agencies and current reporting requirements.
b. M14-03 establishes requirement for Information Security Continuous Monitoring 
(ISCM) under DHS control.
c.	 M14-04 establishes change in FISMA reauthorization if ISCM program is active.
I have highlighted the initial list of documents, instructions, regulations, and laws which 
have bearing on assessments and testing of security controls on systems. There are many 
other federal documents which have relevance to operating and maintaining security for sys-
tems. However, they are varied and other sector-specific so each area has its own criteria

which are added to what has been described here. There are also industry-specific security  
requirements available, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Specifications  
(PCI-DSS), so always check when beginning to assess a system for what regulations, laws, 
and industry criteria are applicable prior to commencing with your assessment.

Federal RMF Requirements
Over the past 10–15 years there have been multiple efforts to provide testers, evaluators, 
auditors, and validators the guidance and techniques to ensure the systems they were re-
viewing meet the federal criteria for accreditation and security. As described in Chapters 1 
and 2, these activities have culminated in the NIST developing Risk Management Framework 
(RMF) as defined in SP 800-37, rev. 1. Laura Taylor, in her Syngress Press book FISMA Compli-
ance Guide, has a good and detailed explanation (Chapter 3) of the various C&A processes as 
used, previously implemented, and developed by the various components of the US govern-
ment; so I won’t go into great detail here about those varied procedures and implementations. 
However, there are some points with respect to the security testing conducted under each of 
these techniques which do have bearing on this book, so I will discuss these throughout this 
handbook.
FEDERAL CIVILIAN AGENCIES
NIST produced the RMF in 2010 and OMB issued a memorandum subsequently which 
requires all federal civilian agencies to follow this guidance for all IT systems under their con-
trol. In accordance with FISMA, DOD and Intelligence Community (IC) were exempt from 
following this guidance, but both organizations have agreed to follow RMF since FISMA was 
approved and became law in 2002.
FISMA had originally required each agency certify and accredit all IT systems and report 
on their security status to Congress annually. NIST then developed the SP 800-34 Certifica-
tion and Accreditation Guide in 2004 to provide guidance to the federal agencies on how this 
process was to be completed and what steps were required to successfully fulfill each of the 
agency’s needs. This process provided the major inputs to the annual FISMA reporting sta-
tistics for each agency over the next several years. I performed many C&A efforts for various 
federal civilian agencies following this process and it was somewhat long and detailed, but 
not nearly as arduous as the DOD and IC processes as explained below.
Along with the effort for the C&A activities, NIST produced the Security Controls Catalog, 
SP 800-53, which delineated the various types, kind, and families of security controls that 
are available for the IT systems. NIST did this in conjunction with various security vendors, 
product producers, and the security professionals throughout the industry. This resulted 
in a detailed, very rich catalog of security controls within the operational, technical, and 

36

﻿
management arenas to allow selection of controls based on location, operating environment, 
data categorization, and mission/business objectives for each system as it was developed, 
implemented, and operated in the governmental space. Along with SP 800-53, the testing 
guide for each control was produced in SP 800-53A which was, and still is, aligned with each 
control as found in SP 800-53. SP 800-53A defines the methods, concepts, and techniques to 
be used to evaluate each control. Further discussion on SP 800-53 will be found in Chapters 8 
and 9.
DOD – DIACAP – RMF FOR DOD IT
DOD started their approach to C&A with the advent of DITSCAP in the late 1980s. 
DITSCAP stands for DOD Information Technology Security Certification and Accreditation 
Process and was designed and predicated on an infrastructure approach to security. As it 
began to be practiced, I experienced an overwhelming proliferation of paperwork associated 
with the DITSCAP. Literally everything needed to be documented, including facilities com-
ponents: the Heating, Ventilation, & Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems and their controls, the 
physical security of the structures and surrounding environment, the fire suppression and 
detection systems employed in the building (s), etc. These review and evaluation processes 
led to vast amounts of paperwork, documentation for each C&A effort. Along with this, there 
were no reciprocity agreements so the efforts were reduplicated for each system, even if they 
were housed in the same room in the same building. All of this led to massive amounts of 
documents to be reviewed for each accreditation and whole companies were formed based on 
their abilities and expertise in developing all of these “accreditation” documents. These vari-
ous efforts led to a standardization of the methods of assessment which became known as the 
Validator Requirements and the Security Test and Evaluation (ST&E) report. Observing the 
actions of a system was determined to be an acceptable method of assessment, based on the 
notes and observances of the validator. Document reviews of system documentation became 
an important part of the assessment process. These are two types of the Validator Require-
ments as practiced during the DITSCAP era of DOD C&A actions.
When FISMA and the Paperwork Reduction Acts were passed in 2002, there was great 
hope that these governmental laws would influence the DOD leaders into implementing 
some means and methods for reducing this volume of paperwork associated with DITSCAP 
packages. And, to some degree, it did. When the DOD CIO signed the Interim Guidance doc-
ument to implement FISMA in DOD in June 2004, Department of Defense (DOD) Information 
Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP) was created. DIACAP stands 
for DOD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Program and created a new 
process for C&A in DOD. Gone were the volumes of data required for accreditation and born 
were four new documents: System Identification Profile (SIP), DIACAP Implementation Plan 
(DIP), Scorecard, and Plan of Action and Milestones (POAM). The SIP was the document in 
which the system description and all of its parameters were defined and described. The DIP 
was the document in which the DOD-defined security controls assigned to the system were 
documented with their implementation status. The Scorecard was the DIACAP validator’s 
document to describe the results of the ST&E efforts and the resulting residual risks associ-
ated with the system. The POAM was the document which identifies any residual risks which 

	
IC – ICD 503

﻿
required further fixing or remediation. This DIACAP process was finalized in late November 
2007 with the final issuance of DODI 8510.01 regulatory instruction from DOD to all of its 
component organizations. Each test effort required all four documents plus additional docu-
ments, known as artifacts, to prove the security and assurance to the Designated Accredi-
tation Authority (DAA) who would then approve the use of the system within DOD. The 
development of the Scorecard process and the DODI 8510–designated certifying authority led 
to detailed organizational efforts for testing, evaluation, and assessments of the thousands of 
systems within DOD for each component and agency. Testing then rose to a relatively inde-
pendent status and, as such, agents for the Certifying Authority, validators, and assessors all 
became more important to the process than ever before.
During the past 7 years of use, however, the DOD mission focus after FISMA was made 
law caused security to take a less than optimal role in the command leadership. This led to ac-
tual testing of systems being conducted quickly, but not always thoroughly. It was the general 
“hurry up and get it over with” mentality on the part of commanders, especially in the field in 
overseas locations. There were, naturally, several incidents which propelled senior leadership 
to change their perspective and begin to see the value of the testing and evaluation portion of 
the DIACAP process. These events have led the services to allow full examination and testing 
of systems in recent times.
IC – ICD 503
The IC within the US government is made up of various agencies and organizations which 
support the intelligence missions of the government. There has been a long-standing practice 
within the IC to evaluate and extensively test security controls, components, and devices. This 
process was first developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the access control area with 
mainframes. As systems were developed, the critical area of confidentiality was addressed by 
various IC organizations which led to the development of the testing and evaluation criteria 
found in the Rainbow Series of documents produced by the National Security Agency (NSA). 
These documents provided the initial examination and evaluation requirements for various 
computer components and equipment. There were, and still are, a series of different colored 
cover books (hence the “Rainbow” title) each of which focused on a select area of equipment 
and each volume provided testing criteria for examiners and validators to verify the security 
of the equipment under test.
This process gradually evolved over time to become the Director of Central Intelligence 
Directive (DCID) 6/3 certification process under the control and oversight of the Office of 
the Director of Central Intelligence (the DCI of DCID). This process focused on the physical 
side of security to ensure the classified data in the systems were safe and the levels and types 
of encryption at which the data were stored for the same reason.
This process developed a two-stage evaluation methodology. The primary focus points for 
testing and evaluation of systems in the first stage included:
• System architecture analysis: This step verifies that the system architecture complies with 
the architecture description in the security plan. The interfaces between the system under 
test and other systems must be identified and evaluated to assess their effectiveness in 
maintaining the security posture of the infrastructure.

38	
4.  Federal RMF Requirements
﻿
• Software, hardware, and firmware design analysis: This step evaluates how well the software, 
hardware, and firmware reflect the security requirements of the security plan and the 
security architecture of the system.
• Network connection rule compliance analysis: This step evaluates the intended connections 
to other systems and networks to ensure the system design will enforce specific network 
security policies and protect the IS from adverse confidentiality, integrity, availability, and 
accountability impacts.
• Integrity analysis of integrated products: This step evaluates the integration of Commercial-
Off-The-Shelf (COTS) or Government Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) software, hardware, and 
firmware to ensure that their integration into the system design complies with the 
system security architecture. The product security functionality should be verified by the 
certification team to confirm that the needed security functions are present and properly 
integrated into the system.
• Life cycle management analysis: This step verifies that change control and configuration 
management practices are in place, or will be, and are sufficient to preserve the integrity 
of the security-relevant software and hardware.
• Security requirements validation procedure preparation: This step defines the procedures 
to be used to verify compliance with all the defined security requirements. The security 
requirements document must identify the type of review required to validate each 
requirement. If test procedures are prepared, they should be added to the security  
plan.
• Vulnerability assessment: The initial evaluation analysis steps conclude with a vulnerability 
assessment to identify the residual risk. A vulnerability assessment evaluates security 
vulnerabilities with regard to confidentiality, integrity, availability, and accountability 
and recommends applicable countermeasures. It uses techniques such as static 
penetration, flaw hypothesis, and threat–vulnerability pairing to determine the ability to 
exploit the vulnerabilities.
The second stage of testing and evaluation was usually conducted subsequent to the anal-
ysis from the first stage and included:
• ST&E: This step validates the correct implementation of identification and authentication, 
audit capabilities, access controls, object reuse, trusted recovery, and network connection 
rule compliance. It assesses the technical implementation of the security design, 
and ascertains that security software, hardware, and firmware features have been 
implemented as documented in the Security Agreement.
• Penetration testing: This step assesses the system’s ability to withstand intentional 
attempts to circumvent system security features by exploiting technical security 
vulnerabilities. It may include internal and external penetration attempts based on 
common vulnerabilities for the technology being used.
• TEMPEST and RED-BLACK verification: This step may be required to validate that the 
equipment and site meet TEMPEST and RED-BLACK verification security requirements.
• Validation of Communication Security (COMSEC) compliance: This step validates that NSA-
approved COMSEC is in use and that approved COMSEC key management procedures 
are used. It evaluates how well the COMSEC materials and procedures meet the 
requirements defined in the Security Agreement.

﻿
• System management analysis: This step examines the system management infrastructure to 
determine whether it adequately supports the maintenance of the environment, mission, 
and architecture described in the Security Agreement. It also provides an indication of 
the effectiveness of the security personnel.
• Site evaluation: This step validates that the site operation of the information system is 
accomplished as documented in the Security Agreement. It analyzes the operational 
procedures for the IS, environment, personnel security, and physical security to 
determine whether they pose any unacceptable risks to the information being processed.
• Contingency plan evaluation: This step analyzes the contingency, backup, and continuity 
of service plans to ensure the plans are consistent with the requirements identified in 
the Security Agreement. The plans should consider natural disasters, enemy actions, or 
malicious actions.
• Risk management review: This step assesses the operation of the system to determine 
whether the risk to confidentiality, integrity, availability, and accountability is being 
maintained at an acceptable level. This is the final review before developing the 
recommendation to the Designated Accrediting Authority.
In 2008, the IC changed the criteria for assessments and testing with the publication of 
Intelligence Community Directive (ICD) 503, which is more aligned with the NIST guidance 
than the independent guidance as used before under DCID 6/3. This process focuses on 
reciprocity, the concept that if one organization approves and authorizes a system, another 
federal organization can use this approval without minimal additional work and testing by 
accepting the originating organization’s authorization. The second area of change under ICD 
503 is the concept that security includes all areas of concern, not just confidentiality; so more 
emphasis is placed on integrity and availability in addition to the previous focus points.
FEDRAMP
The US government placed an emphasis on “Cloud First” for IT support in 2010. The resul-
tant program to guide the various agencies is Federal Risk and Authorization Management 
Program (FedRAMP). The FedRAMP is a US government agency (General Services Admin-
istration (GSA) is led with NIST providing security guidance)-developed risk management 
program focused on security for cloud-based systems. It provides a standard approach for 
conducting security assessments of cloud systems based on an accepted set of baseline se-
curity controls and consistent processes that have been vetted and agreed upon by agencies 
across the federal government. Agencies can leverage security assessments for cloud services 
that have already received provisional authorization under FedRAMP.
FedRAMP is a government-wide program that provides a standardized approach to se-
curity assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud-based services. Fe-
dRAMP uses a “do once, use many times” framework that intends to saves costs, time, and 
staff required to conduct redundant agency security assessments and process monitoring re-
ports. The purpose of FedRAMP is to:
• Ensure that cloud based services have adequate information security;
• Eliminate duplication of effort and reduce risk management costs; and

40	
4.  Federal RMF Requirements
﻿
• Enable rapid and cost-effective procurement of information systems/services for Federal 
agencies.
Conformity assessment is a key part of FedRAMP. Conformity assessment is a “demon-
stration that specified requirements relating to a product, process, system, person or body are 
fulfilled.”1 Conformity assessment is built on a set of internationally recognized standards 
that help ensure that the program consistently supports the appropriate level of rigor and 
independence required.
FedRAMP uses a conformity assessment process to ensure that cloud computing services 
and systems offered by Cloud Service Providers (CSP) meet specified security requirements. 
CSPs will be required to use qualified, accredited Third Party Assessment Organizations to 
perform independent assessments on their service and systems. Third Party Assessment Or-
ganizations (3PAO) perform initial and periodic assessment of CSP systems per FedRAMP 
requirements, provide evidence of compliance, and play an ongoing role in ensuring that 
CSPs meet requirements. FedRAMP provisional authorizations must include an assessment 
by an accredited 3PAO to ensure a consistent assessment process.
Under FedRAMP, CSP authorization packages must include an assessment by an accred-
ited 3PAO to ensure a consistent assessment process. Accredited 3PAOs perform initial and 
periodic assessment of CSP systems per FedRAMP requirements, provide evidence of com-
pliance, and play an on-going role in ensuring that CSPs meet requirements. [1]
NIST CYBERSECURITY FRAMEWORK
Recognizing that the national and economic security of the United States depends on the 
reliable functioning of critical infrastructure, the President issued Executive Order 13636, Im-
proving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, in February 2013. It directed NIST to work with 
stakeholders to develop a voluntary framework – based on existing standards, guidelines, 
and practices – for reducing cyber risks to critical infrastructure. This Executive Order calls 
for the development of a voluntary Cybersecurity Framework (“Framework”) that provides 
a “prioritized, flexible, repeatable, performance-based, and cost-effective approach” to man-
age cybersecurity risk for those processes, information, and systems directly involved in the 
delivery of critical infrastructure services. The Framework, developed in collaboration with 
industry, provides guidance to an organization on managing cybersecurity risk.
The Framework focuses on using business drivers to guide cybersecurity activities and 
considering cybersecurity risks as part of the organization’s risk management processes. 
The Framework consists of three parts: the Framework Core, the Framework Profile, and the 
Framework Implementation Tiers. The Framework Core is a set of cybersecurity activities, 
outcomes, and informative references that are common across critical infrastructure sectors, 
providing the detailed guidance for developing individual organizational Profiles. Through 
1ISO/IEC 17000.

use of the Profiles, the Framework will help the organization align its cybersecurity activities 
with its business requirements, risk tolerances, and resources. The Tiers provide a mechanism 
for organizations to view and understand the characteristics of their approach to managing 
cybersecurity risk. [2]

Risk Management Framework
The basic framework for security controls and their evaluation throughout the US govern-
ment has been, and currently is, the Risk Management Framework as defined in SP 800-37, 
rev. 1. This chapter is providing a brief overview of that process as defined by NIST and some 
of the background on the expected methods and techniques for treatment of the various risks 
that an assessor will need to be cognizant of when testing and examining systems and con-
trols. Figure 5.1 is from SP 800-37, rev. 1 and shows the basic flow of the risk management 
process for reviewing, implementing, and assessing the security controls for a federal system. 
This process is now utilized as the standard for all federal systems.
Each step of the Risk Management Framework requires detailed knowledge components, 
understanding the scope and mission of the system under review and external data about 
the organization, personnel, and activities. The six steps of the Risk Management Framework 
cover the full picture of the system and its intended use in the federal space. All US govern-
mental agencies now use this defined process to assess and authorize their IT systems for use 
on a federal network, including DOD and the IC. The following is another representation of 
the Risk Management Framework with the NIST Special Publications used for guidance on 
each step added for further clarification:

5.  Risk Management Framework
﻿
Each step of the Risk Management Framework has delineated steps for accomplishment 
of the specific requirements within each step. Tasking parameters are defined by required 
events to be completed, primary and secondary roles and responsibilities for each task, and 
final results for each task and, subsequently, each step of the framework.
STEP 1 – CATEGORIZATION
The primary goal of this step is to categorize the information system and the information 
processed, stored, and transmitted by that system based on an impact analysis. The objectives 
of this step are as follows:
• Produce the FIPS-199 Categorization Document for the system.
• Document is utilized in multiple locations and on multiple efforts:
•	 Storage Service Provider (SSP)
•	 Budgets and CPIC activities
•	 System of Records Notice (SORN)
•	 Program Objective Memorandum (POM) and Program of Requirements (POR) actions 
for DOD and the military services
	
Categorization of the information system is based on an impact analysis.  
It is performed to determine:
•	 The types of information included within the security authorization boundary
•	 The security requirements for the information types
•	 The potential impact on the organization resulting from a security  
compromise
FIGURE 5.1  Risk Management Framework.

	
Step 1 – categorization	
45
﻿
The result is used as the basis for developing the security plan, selecting security controls, 
and determining the risk inherent in operating the system.
The identified tasks for step 1 are as follows:
1.	 Categorize the information system and document the results of the security categoriza-
tion in the security plan.
2.	 Describe the information system (including system boundary) and document the 
description in the security plan.
3.	 Register the information system with appropriate organizational program/management 
offices.
The guidance from the SP 800-37, rev. 1 gives additional insight to categorization: “The 
security categorization process is carried out by the information system owner and infor-
mation owner/steward in cooperation and collaboration with appropriate organizational 
officials (i.e., senior leaders with mission/business function and/or risk management re-
sponsibilities). The security categorization process is conducted as an organization-wide 
activity taking into consideration the enterprise architecture and the information security 
architecture. This helps to ensure that individual information systems are categorized based 
on the mission and business objectives of the organization. The information system owner 
and information owner/steward consider results from the initial risk assessment as a part of 
the security categorization decision. The security categorization decision is consistent with 
the organization’s risk management strategy to identify potential impact to mission/business 
functions resulting from the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability. The risk 
management strategy provides guidance and relevant information to authorizing officials 
(e.g., risk assessment methodologies employed by the organization, evaluation of risks de-
termined, risk mitigation approaches, organizational risk tolerance, approaches for monitor-
ing risk over time, known existing aggregated risks from current information systems, and 
other sources of risk).
The results of the security categorization process influence the selection of appropriate 
security controls for the information system and also, where applicable, the minimum assur-
ance requirements for that system. Security categorization determinations consider potential 
adverse impacts to organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other or-
ganizations, and the Nation. The organization may consider decomposing the information 
system into multiple subsystems to more efficiently and effectively allocate security controls 
to the system. One approach is to categorize each identified subsystem (including dynamic 
subsystems). Separately categorizing each subsystem does not change the overall categoriza-
tion of the information system. Rather, it allows the constituent subsystems to receive a sepa-
rate allocation of security controls from NIST Special Publication 800-53 instead of deploying 
higher-impact controls across every subsystem. Another approach is to bundle smaller sub-
systems into larger subsystems within the information system, categorize each of the aggre-
gated subsystems, and allocate security controls to the subsystems, as appropriate. Security 
categorization information is documented in the system identification section of the security 
plan or included as an attachment to the plan.”1

﻿
STEP 2 – SELECTION
The primary goal of this step is to select an initial set of baseline security controls for the 
information system based on the security categorization, tailoring and supplementing the 
security control baseline as needed based on an organizational assessment of risk and local 
conditions. The objectives of this step are as follows:
• Identify security controls needed.
• Select minimum security control baseline.
• Build monitoring strategy for identified controls.
The security control baseline is established by determining specific controls required to 
protect the system based on the security categorization of the system. The baseline is tailored 
and supplemented in accordance with an organizational assessment of risk and local param-
eters. The security control baseline, as well as the plan for monitoring it, is documented in the 
security plan.
The identified tasks for step 2 are as follows:
1.	 Identify the security controls that are provided by the organization as common controls 
for organizational information systems and document the controls in a security plan (or 
equivalent document).
2.	 Select the security controls for the information system and document the controls in the 
security plan.
3.	 Develop a strategy for the continuous monitoring of security control effectiveness 
and any proposed or actual changes to the information system and its environment of 
operation.
4.	 Review and approve the security plan.
The guidance from the SP 800-37, rev. 1 gives additional insight to control selection:
The security controls are selected based on the security categorization of the information system. After se-
lecting the applicable security control baseline, organizations apply the tailoring process to align the controls 
more closely with the specific conditions within the organization (i.e., conditions related to organizational risk 
tolerance, missions/business functions, information systems, or environments of operation). The tailoring 
process includes:
(i)	 identifying and designating common controls in initial security control baselines;
(ii)	 applying scoping considerations to the remaining baseline security controls;
(iii)	selecting compensating security controls, if needed;
(iv)	assigning specific values to organization-defined security control parameters via explicit assignment and 
selection statements;
(v)	 supplementing baselines with additional security controls and control enhancements, if needed; and
(vi)	providing additional specification information for control implementation, if needed.
Organizations use risk assessments to inform and guide the tailoring process for organizational informa-
tion systems and environments of operation. Threat data from risk assessments provide critical information 
on adversary capabilities, intent, and targeting that may affect organizational decisions regarding the selec-
tion of additional security controls, including the associated costs and benefits. Risk assessment results are 
also leveraged when identifying common controls to help determine if such controls available for inheri-
tance meet the security requirements for the system and its environment of operation (including analyses for 

	
Step 2 – selection	
47
﻿
potential single points of failure). The security plan contains an overview of the security requirements for 
the information system in sufficient detail to determine that the security controls selected would meet those 
requirements. The security plan, in addition to the list of security controls to be implemented, describes the 
intended application of each control in the context of the information system with sufficient detail to enable 
a compliant implementation of the control. During the security control selection process organizations may 
begin planning for the continuous monitoring process by developing a monitoring strategy. The strategy can 
include, for example, monitoring criteria such as the volatility of specific security controls and the appropriate 
frequency of monitoring specific controls. Organizations may choose to address security control volatility and 
frequency of monitoring during control selection as inputs to the continuous monitoring process. The moni-
toring strategy can be included in the security plan to support the concept of near real-time risk management 
and ongoing authorization. Information system owners inheriting common controls can either document the 
implementation of the controls in their respective security plans or reference the controls contained in the se-
curity plans of the common control providers. Information system owners can refer to the security authoriza-
tion packages prepared by common control providers when making determinations regarding the adequacy 
of common controls inherited by their respective systems.
For net-centric architectures where subsystems may be added or removed from an information system 
dynamically, the organization includes in the security plan for the system:
(i)	 descriptions of the functions of the dynamic subsystems;
(ii)	 the security controls employed in the subsystems;
(iii)	constraints/assumptions regarding the functions of the dynamic subsystems and the associated security 
controls in the subsystems;
(iv)	dependencies of other subsystems on the proper functioning of the security controls of the dynamic sub-
systems;
(v)	 procedures for determining that the dynamic subsystems conform to the security plan, assumptions, and 
constraints; and
(vi)	the impact of the dynamic subsystems and associated security controls on existing security controls in the 
information system. While inclusion of a dynamic subsystem may impact the information system or some 
of the currently identified subsystems, it does not necessarily mean the subsystem will impact the security 
of the system or other subsystems. That is, not all subsystems are security relevant.
Changes in the net-centric architectures that exceed the anticipated limits of the security plan may not be 
allowed or may require reassessment prior to being approved. When security controls are designated as com-
mon controls, the organization ensures that sufficient information is available to information system owners 
and authorizing officials to support the risk management process. When security services are provided by 
external providers (e.g., through contracts, interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements, licensing 
agreements, and/or supply chain arrangements), the organization:
(i)	 defines the external services provided to the organization;
(ii)	 describes how the external services are protected in accordance with the security requirements of the 
organization; and
(iii)	obtains the necessary assurances that the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other 
organizations, and the Nation arising from the use of the external services is acceptable.
The organization also considers that replicated subsystems within a complex information system may 
exhibit common vulnerabilities that can be exploited by a common threat source, thereby negating the redun-
dancy that might be relied upon as a risk mitigation measure. The impact due to a security incident against 
one constituent subsystem might cascade and impact many subsystems at the same time.2

﻿
STEP 3 – IMPLEMENTATION
The primary goal of this step is to implement the security controls and describe how the 
controls are employed within the information system and its environment of operation. The 
objectives of this step are as follows:
• Install security controls into system.
• Document controls as installed.
The security controls specified in the security plan are implemented by taking into account 
the minimum organizational assurance requirements. The security plan describes how the 
controls are employed within the information system and its operational environment. The 
security assessment plan documents the methods for testing these controls and the expected 
results throughout the system life cycle.
The identified tasks for step 3 are as follows:
1.	 Implement the security controls specified in the security plan.
2.	 Document the security control implementation, as appropriate, in the security plan, pro-
viding a functional description of the control implementation (including planned inputs, 
expected behavior, and expected outputs).
The guidance from the SP 800-37, rev. 1 gives additional insight to implementation of con-
trols: “Security control implementation is consistent with the organization’s enterprise archi-
tecture and information security architecture. The information security architecture serves as 
a resource to allocate security controls (including, for example, security mechanisms and ser-
vices) to an information system and any organization-defined subsystems. Early integration 
of information security requirements into the system development life cycle is the most cost-
effective method for implementing the organizational risk management strategy at Tier 3.  
Security controls targeted for deployment within the information system (including subsys-
tems) are allocated to specific system components responsible for providing a particular se-
curity capability. Not all security controls need to be allocated to every subsystem. Catego-
rization of subsystems, information security architecture, and allocation of security controls 
work together to help achieve a suitable balance. Allocating some security controls as com-
mon controls or hybrid controls is part of this architectural process. Organizations use best 
practices when implementing the security controls within the information system including 
system and software engineering methodologies, security engineering principles, and secure 
coding techniques. Risk assessment may help inform decisions regarding the cost, benefit, 
and risk trade-offs in using one type of technology versus another for control implementa-
tion. In addition, organizations ensure that mandatory configuration settings are established 
and implemented on information technology products in accordance with federal and orga-
nizational policies (e.g., Federal Desktop Core Configuration). Information system security 
engineers with support from information system security officers employ a sound security 
engineering process that captures and refines information security requirements and ensures 
the integration of those requirements into information technology products and systems 
through purposeful security design or configuration. When available, organizations consider 
the use of information technology products that have been tested, evaluated, or validated by 
approved, independent, third-party assessment facilities. In addition, organizations satisfy, 

	
Step 3 – implementation	
49
﻿
where applicable, minimum assurance requirements when implementing security controls. 
Assurance requirements are directed at the activities and actions that security control devel-
opers and implementers define and apply to increase the level of confidence that the controls 
are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with 
respect to meeting the security requirements for the information system. Assurance require-
ments address the quality of the design, development, and implementation of the security 
functions in the information system. For higher-impact systems (i.e., potential high-value 
targets) in situations where specific and credible threat information indicates the likelihood 
of advanced cyber-attacks, additional assurance measures are considered. Organizations con-
sider any implementation-related issues associated with the integration and/or interfaces 
among common controls and system-specific controls.
For the identified common controls inherited by the information system, information sys-
tem security engineers with support from information system security officers coordinate with 
the common control provider to determine the most appropriate way to apply the common 
controls to the organizational information systems. For certain management and operational 
controls, formal integration into information technology products, services, and systems may 
not be required. For certain types of operational and/or technical controls, implementation 
may require additional components, products, or services to enable the information system to 
utilize the previously selected common controls to the fullest extent. If selection of common 
controls previously had been deferred, identification of common controls inherited by the in-
formation system is revisited to determine if better determinations can be made at this point 
in the system development life cycle. Information system owners can refer to the authoriza-
tion packages prepared by common control providers when making determinations regard-
ing the adequacy of the implementations of common controls for their respective systems. 
For common controls that do not meet the protection needs of the information systems inher-
iting the controls or that have unacceptable weaknesses or deficiencies, the system owners 
identify compensating or supplementary controls to be implemented. Risk assessment may 
help determine how gaps in protection needs between systems and common controls affect 
the overall risk associated with the system, and how to prioritize the need for compensating 
or supplementary controls to mitigate specific risks. To the maximum extent and consistent 
with the flexibility allowed in applying the tasks in the RMF, organizations and their contrac-
tors conduct initial security control assessments (also referred to as developmental testing 
and evaluation) during information system development and implementation. Conducting 
security control assessments in parallel with the development and implementation phases of 
the system development life cycle facilitates the early identification of weaknesses and defi-
ciencies and provides the most cost-effective method for initiating corrective actions. Issues 
found during these assessments can be referred to authorizing officials for early resolution, as 
appropriate. The results of the initial security control assessments can also be used during the 
security authorization process to avoid delays or costly repetition of assessments. Assessment 
results that are subsequently reused in other phases of the system development life cycle 
meet the reuse requirements (including independence) established by the organization.”3

﻿
STEP 4 – ASSESSMENT
The primary goal of this step is to assess and evaluate the security controls using appro-
priate assessment procedures to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented 
correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting 
the security objectives of the system. The objective of this step is as follows:
• Conduct evaluation of system security with the following questions answered:
•	 Are the controls:
-	 Implemented correctly?
-	 Operating as intended?
-	 Producing the desired outcome?
The security control assessment follows the approved plan, including defined procedures, 
to determine the effectiveness of the controls in meeting security requirements of the informa-
tion system. The results are documented in the security assessment report.
The identified tasks for step 4 are as follows:
1.	 Develop, review, and approve a plan to assess the security controls.
2.	 Assess the security controls in accordance with the assessment procedures defined in the 
security assessment plan.
3.	 Prepare the security assessment report documenting the issues, findings, and 
recommendations from the security control assessment.
4.	 Conduct initial remediation actions on security controls based on the findings and rec-
ommendations of the security assessment report and reassess remediated control(s), as 
appropriate.
The guidance from the SP 800-37, rev. 1 gives additional insight to assessment: “Security 
control assessments determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, 
operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the secu-
rity requirements for the information system. Security control assessments occur as early as 
practicable in the system development life cycle, preferably during the development phase of 
the information system. These types of assessments are referred to as developmental testing and 
evaluation and are intended to validate that the required security controls are implemented 
correctly and consistent with the established information security architecture. Developmen-
tal testing and evaluation activities include, for example, design and code reviews, applica-
tion scanning, and regression testing. Security weaknesses and deficiencies identified early 
in the system development life cycle can be resolved more quickly and in a much more cost-
effective manner before proceeding to subsequent phases in the life cycle. The objective is to 
identify the information security architecture and security controls up front and to ensure 
that the system design and testing validate the implementation of these controls.
The information system owner relies on the technical expertise and judgment of assessors to:
(i)	 assess the security controls employed within or inherited by the information system us-
ing assessment procedures specified in the security assessment plan; and
(ii)	 provide specific recommendations on how to correct weaknesses or deficiencies in the 
controls and reduce or eliminate identified vulnerabilities. The assessor findings are an 

	
Step 4 – assessment	
51
﻿
unbiased, factual reporting of the weaknesses and deficiencies discovered during the 
security control assessment.
Organizations are encouraged to maximize the use of automation to conduct security con-
trol assessments to help:
(i)	 increase the speed and overall effectiveness and efficiency of the assessments; and
(ii)	 support the concept of ongoing monitoring of the security state of organizational infor-
mation systems.
When iterative development processes such as agile development are employed, this typi-
cally results in an iterative assessment as each cycle is conducted. A similar process is used 
for assessing security controls in COTS information technology products employed within 
the information system. Even when iterative development is not employed, organizations 
may choose to begin assessing security controls prior to the complete implementation of all 
security controls listed in the security plan. This type of incremental assessment is appropriate 
if it is more efficient or cost-effective to do so. For example, policy, procedures, and plans may 
be assessed prior to the assessment of the technical security controls in the hardware and 
software. In many cases, common controls (i.e., security controls inherited by the information 
system) may be assessed prior to the security controls employed within the system.
The organization ensures that assessors have access to:
(i)	 the information system and environment of operation where the security controls are 
employed; and
(ii)	 the appropriate documentation, records, artifacts, test results, and other materials 
needed to assess the security controls.
In addition, assessors have the required degree of independence as determined by the 
authorizing official. Security control assessments in support of initial and subsequent secu-
rity authorizations are conducted by independent assessors. Assessor independence during 
continuous monitoring, although not mandated, facilitates reuse of assessment results when 
reauthorization is required. When security controls are provided to an organization by an 
external provider (e.g., through contracts, interagency agreements, lines of business arrange-
ments, licensing agreements, and/or supply chain arrangements), the organization ensures 
that assessors have access to the information system/environment of operation where the 
controls are employed as well as appropriate information needed to carry out the assessment. 
The organization also obtains any information related to existing assessments that may have 
been conducted by the external provider and reuses such assessment information whenever 
possible in accordance with the reuse criteria established by the organization. Descriptive in-
formation about the information system is typically documented in the system identification 
section of the security plan or included by reference or as attachments to the plan. Supporting 
materials such as procedures, reports, logs, and records showing evidence of security control 
implementation are identified as well. In order to make the risk management process as time-
ly and cost-effective as possible, the reuse of previous assessment results, when reasonable 
and appropriate, is strongly recommended. For example, a recent audit of an information 
system may have produced information about the effectiveness of selected security controls. 
Another opportunity to reuse previous assessment results comes from programs that test and 

52	
5.  Risk Management Framework
﻿
evaluate the security features of commercial information technology products. Additionally, 
if prior assessment results from the system developer are available, the security control asses-
sor, under appropriate circumstances, may incorporate those results into the assessment. And 
finally, assessment results are reused to support reciprocity where possible.”4
STEP 5 – AUTHORIZATION
The primary goal of this step is to authorize information system operation based on a 
determination of the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organiza-
tions, and the nation resulting from the operation of the information system and the decision 
that this risk is acceptable. The objective of this step is as follows:
• Obtain authority to operate approval for system.
The residual risks identified during the security control assessment are evaluated and the 
decision is made to authorize the system to operate, deny its operation, or remediate the 
deficiencies. Associated documentation is prepared and/or updated depending on the au-
thorization decision.
The identified tasks for step 5 are as follows:
1.	 Prepare the plan of action and milestones based on the findings and recommendations of 
the security assessment report excluding any remediation actions taken.
2.	 Assemble the security authorization package and submit the package to the authorizing 
official for adjudication.
3.	 Determine the risk to organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or 
reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the nation.
4.	 Determine if the risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, 
other organizations, or the nation is acceptable.
The guidance from the SP 800-37, rev. 1 gives additional insight to authorization: “The ex-
plicit acceptance of risk is the responsibility of the authorizing official and cannot be delegat-
ed to other officials within the organization. The authorizing official considers many factors 
when deciding if the risk to organizational operations (including mission, function, image, or 
reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation, is accept-
able. Balancing security considerations with mission and operational needs is paramount to 
achieving an acceptable authorization decision. The authorizing official issues an authoriza-
tion decision for the information system and the common controls inherited by the system 
after reviewing all of the relevant information and, where appropriate, consulting with other 
organizational officials, including the organization’s risk executive (function). Security autho-
rization decisions are based on the content of the security authorization package and, where 
appropriate, any inputs received from key organizational officials, including the risk execu-
tive (function). The authorization package provides relevant information on the security state 
of the information system including the ongoing effectiveness of the security controls em-
ployed within or inherited by the system. Inputs from the risk executive (function), including 
4SP 800-37, rev. 1, June 2014 edition, p. 31.

	
Step 5 – authorization	
53
﻿
previously established overarching risk guidance to authorizing officials, provide additional 
organization-wide information to the authorizing official that may be relevant and affect the 
authorization decision (e.g., organizational risk tolerance, specific mission and business re-
quirements, dependencies among information systems, and other types of risks not directly 
associated with the information system). Risk executive (function) inputs are documented 
and become part of the security authorization decision. Security authorization decisions, in-
cluding inputs from the risk executive (function), are conveyed to information system owners 
and common control providers and made available to interested parties within the organiza-
tion (e.g., information system owners and authorizing officials for interconnected systems, 
chief information officers, information owners/stewards, senior managers).
The authorization decision document conveys the final security authorization decision from 
the authorizing official to the information system owner or common control provider, and 
other organizational officials, as appropriate. The authorization decision document contains 
the following information:
(i)	 authorization decision;
(ii)	 terms and conditions for the authorization; and
(iii)	authorization termination date.
The security authorization decision indicates to the information system owner whether the 
system is:
(i)	 authorized to operate; or
(ii)	 not authorized to operate.
The terms and conditions for the authorization provide a description of any specific limita-
tions or restrictions placed on the operation of the information system or inherited controls 
that must be followed by the system owner or common control provider. The authorization 
termination date, established by the authorizing official, indicates when the security authoriza-
tion expires. Authorization termination dates are influenced by federal and/or organizational 
policies which may establish maximum authorization periods. Organizations may choose to 
eliminate the authorization termination date if the continuous monitoring program is suf-
ficiently robust to provide the authorizing official with the needed information to conduct 
ongoing risk determination and risk acceptance activities with regard to the security state of 
the information system and the ongoing effectiveness of security controls employed within 
and inherited by the system.
If the security control assessments are conducted by qualified assessors with the required 
degree of independence based on federal/organizational policies, appropriate security stan-
dards and guidelines, and the needs of the authorizing official, the assessment results can be 
cumulatively applied to the reauthorization, thus supporting the concept of ongoing authori-
zation. Organizational policies regarding ongoing authorization and formal reauthorization, 
if/when required, are consistent with federal directives, regulations, and/or policies.
The authorization decision document is attached to the original security authorization 
package containing the supporting documentation and transmitted to the information sys-
tem owner or common control provider. Upon receipt of the authorization decision docu-
ment and original authorization package, the information system owner or common control 
provider acknowledges and implements the terms and conditions of the authorization and 

54	
5.  Risk Management Framework
﻿
notifies the authorizing official. The organization ensures that authorization documents for 
both information systems and for common controls are made available to appropriate organi-
zational officials (e.g., information system owners inheriting common controls, risk executive 
(function), chief information officers, senior information security officers, information system 
security officers). Authorization documents, especially information dealing with information 
system vulnerabilities, are:
(i)	 marked and appropriately protected in accordance with federal and organizational 
policies; and
(ii)	 retained in accordance with the organization’s record retention policy.
The authorizing official verifies, on an ongoing basis, that the terms and conditions estab-
lished as part of the authorization are being followed by the information system owner or 
common control provider.”5
STEP 6 – MONITORING
The primary goal of this step is to monitor the security controls in the information system 
on an ongoing basis including assessing control effectiveness, documenting changes to the 
system or its environment of operation, conducting security impact analyses of the associated 
changes, and reporting the security state of the system to designated organizational officials.
The objectives of this step are as follows:
• Operate and maintain system security within acceptable risk tolerance.
• Update system securely and safely.
• Conduct mission successfully.
After an Authorization to Operate (ATO) is granted, ongoing continuous monitoring is 
performed on all identified security controls as well as the political, legal, and physical envi-
ronment in which the system operates. Changes to the system or its operational environment 
are documented and analyzed. The security state of the system is reported to designated of-
ficials. Significant changes will cause the system to reenter the security authorization process. 
Otherwise, the system will continue to be monitored on an ongoing basis in accordance with 
the organization’s monitoring strategy.
The identified tasks for step 6 are as follows:
1.	 Determine the security impact of proposed or actual changes to the information system 
and its environment of operation.
2.	 Assess the technical, management, and operational security controls employed within 
and inherited by the information system in accordance with the organization-defined 
monitoring strategy.
3.	 Conduct remediation actions based on the results of ongoing monitoring activities, 
assessment of risk, and outstanding items in the plan of action and milestones.

Step 6 – monitoring	
55
﻿
4.	 Update the security plan, security assessment report, and plan of action and milestones 
based on the results of the continuous monitoring process.
5.	 Report the security status of the information system (including the effectiveness of 
security controls employed within and inherited by the system) to the authorizing official 
and other appropriate organizational officials on an ongoing basis in accordance with the 
monitoring strategy.
6.	 Review the reported security status of the information system (including the effectiveness 
of security controls employed within and inherited by the system) on an ongoing basis in 
accordance with the monitoring strategy to determine whether the risk to organizational 
operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the nation remains 
acceptable.
7.	 Implement an information system disposal strategy, when needed, which executes re-
quired actions when a system is removed from service.
The guidance from the SP 800-37, rev. 1 gives additional insight to ongoing monitoring: 
“The authorizing official or designated representative reviews the reported security status 
of the information system (including the effectiveness of deployed security controls) on an 
ongoing basis, to determine the current risk to organizational operations and assets, indi-
viduals, other organizations, or the Nation. The authorizing official determines, with inputs 
as appropriate from the authorizing official designated representative, senior information 
security officer, and the risk executive (function), whether the current risk is acceptable and 
forwards appropriate direction to the information system owner or common control pro-
vider. The use of automated support tools to capture, organize, quantify, visually display, and 
maintain security status information promotes the concept of near real-time risk management 
regarding the overall risk posture of the organization. The use of metrics and dashboards 
increases an organization’s ability to make risk-based decisions by consolidating data from 
automated tools and providing it to decision makers at different levels within the organiza-
tion in an easy-to-understand format. The risks being incurred may change over time based 
on the information provided in the security status reports. Determining how the changing 
conditions affect the mission or business risks associated with the information system is es-
sential for maintaining adequate security. By carrying out ongoing risk determination and risk 
acceptance, authorizing officials can maintain the security authorization over time. Formal 
reauthorization actions, if required, occur only in accordance with federal or organizational 
policies. The authorizing official conveys updated risk determination and acceptance results 
to the risk executive (function).”6
The Risk Management Framework Authorization Package, as referenced above, has three 
required documents produced during the assessment and authorization process which are 
required to obtain an ATO for federal systems. These three documents are the System Security 
Plan (as defined in SP 800-18), Security Assessment Report (as defined in SP 800-37 and SP 
800-53A), and the POAM (as defined in OMB Memorandum M02-01). The following diagram

ated during the process:
Continuous Monitoring for Current Systems
The objective of a continuous monitoring program is to determine if the complete set of 
planned, required, and deployed security controls within an information system or inherited 
by the system continues to be effective over time in light of the inevitable changes that occur. 
In 2010, OMB issued guidance to US governmental agencies that continuous monitoring 
of security controls would now be required for all systems. This began the developmen-
tal process for the ongoing efforts to create, develop, and maintain a continuous monitor-
ing program for each agency. NIST provided some guidance when they issued SP 800-137, 
“Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM) for Federal Information Systems and 
Organizations,” in September 2011.
There are several different ISCM programs currently in deployment in various govern-
mental agencies including the Continuous Diagnostic and Mitigation (CDM) effort from DHS 
and Continuous Monitoring Risk System (CMRS) from DISA in DOD. These efforts will con-
tinue to evolve over the next several years. As part of this effort, OMB and NIST are provid-
ing guidance and directions on moving to an event-driven authorization process known as 
Ongoing Authorization (OA) within agencies that have an active ISCM. Recent supplemental 
guidance to SP 800-37, rev. 1 provides this guidance and it is worth the effort to obtain this 
document and review it for your area of interest.

Roles and Responsibilities
The Risk Management Framework acknowledges that organizations have widely varying 
missions and organizational structures, so there may be differences in naming conventions 
for risk management-related roles and how specific responsibilities are allocated among or-
ganizational personnel (e.g., multiple individuals filling a single role or one individual fill-
ing multiple roles). However, the basic functions remain the same. The application of the 
Risk Management Framework is flexible, allowing organizations to effectively accomplish 
the intent of the specific tasks within their respective organizational structures to best manage 
information system-related security risks.
Many risk management roles have counterpart roles defined in the routine system devel-
opment life cycle processes carried out by organizations. Whenever possible, organizations 
should align the risk management roles with similar (or complementary) roles defined for the 
system development life cycle.
ORGANIZATIONAL ROLES
White House
This is the US government executive office given statutory authority to issue Executive 
Orders, proclamations, Presidential Decision Directive (PDD)/HSPD/Nation Safe Drivers 
(NSD), and similar documents that initiate action, stop action, or require general notice  
be given (Fig.  6.1). These directives and orders drive the creation and promulgation of 
executive policy throughout the Executive Branch and agencies.
Congress
This is the US government legislative body responsible for the US Code and the general, 
permanent laws of the nation that it contains. Congress’s power to authorize the appropria-
tion of federal spending to carry out government activities drives a lot of the laws and their 
implementation efforts across the government.

strong, for penetrating adversary systems and codes, and to ensure that all national 
security information is protected appropriately whether in transit or at rest.
NIAP
National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) is an initiative partnership between 
the NIST (Commerce) and the NSA (DOD) to evaluate and attempt to meet the needs and 
requirements of IT/IA product producers and consumers to evaluate functionality and pedi-
gree.
DHS
The US Department of Homeland Security is responsible for overseeing the protection of 
the .gov domain and for providing assistance and expertise to private sector owners and op-
erators. The US Computer Emergency Response Team (US-CERT) is an agency within DHS. 
The DHS agency’s work benefits the information technology community and the public at 
large. DHS plays a key role in securing the federal government’s civilian cyber networks and 
helping to secure the broader cyber ecosystem through:
• Partnerships with owners and operators of critical infrastructure such as financial 
systems, chemical plants, and water and electric utilities
• The release of actionable cyber alerts
• Investigations and arrests of cybercriminals
• Education about how the public can stay safe online
DOD
The DOD is the US governmental agency responsible for the security of the nation and 
its allies. It has a long history of developing and providing security to the United States, its 
citizens, and the general public in the United States and overseas. IT security has always 
maintained a high profile within DOD and continues so today with many security programs, 
processes, procedures, and guidance documents. NSA, Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), 
and all of the military services are all part of DOD and follow these directives, instructions, 
and regulations.
INDIVIDUAL ROLES
The primary individual roles, as defined in SP 800-37, rev. 1, are as follows:
• Authorizing official/DAA
• Authorizing official designated representative
• Chief information officer
• Senior agency information security officer

60	
6.  Roles and Responsibilities
﻿
• Information system owner
• Information system security officer
• Program manager (PM)
• Security control assessor
• User representative
System Owner
The information system owner is an organizational official responsible for the procurement, 
development, integration, modification, operation, maintenance, and disposal of an informa-
tion system. The system owner is the singular primary role within the RMF. This role has 
primary responsibilities for 4.5 of the 6 steps within the RMF and is the lead role for the entire 
process. DOD has defined this role in DODI 8510.01 at the PM or systems manager (SM) level 
within the DOD acquisition process.
The primary objectives of the system owner are to:
• Procure, develop, integrate, modify, operate, or maintain an information system
• Prepare the system security plan and conduct risk assessment
• Inform agency officials of the need for certification and accreditation
• Ensure appropriate resources are available
• Provide necessary system-related documentation
• Prepare plan of action and milestones to reduce or eliminate vulnerabilities in the 
information system
• Assemble final accreditation package and submit to authorizing official
• Also act as user representative – in RMF arena
The information system owner is responsible for addressing the operational interests of 
the user community (i.e., users who require access to the information system to satisfy mis-
sion, business, or operational requirements) and for ensuring compliance with information 
security requirements.
In coordination with the information system security officer, the information system own-
er is responsible for the development and maintenance of the security plan and ensures that 
the system is deployed and operated in accordance with the agreed-upon security controls.
In coordination with the information owner/steward, the information system owner is 
also responsible for deciding who has access to the system (and with what types of privileges 
or access rights) and ensures that system users and support personnel receive the requisite 
security training (e.g., instruction in rules of behavior).
Based on guidance from the authorizing official, the information system owner informs 
appropriate organizational officials of the need to conduct the security authorization, 
ensures that the necessary resources are available for the effort, and provides the required 
information system access, information, and documentation to the security control assessor. 
The information system owner receives the security assessment results from the security 
control assessor. After taking appropriate steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerabilities, 
the information system owner assembles the authorization package and submits the 
package to the authorizing official or the authorizing official designated representative for 
adjudication.

	
Individual roles	
61
﻿
Authorizing Official
The authorizing official is a senior official or executive with the authority to formally assume 
responsibility for operating an information system at an acceptable level of risk to organiza-
tional operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the nation.
Authorizing officials typically have budgetary oversight for an information system or are 
responsible for the mission and/or business operations supported by the system.
Through the security authorization process, authorizing officials are accountable for the 
security risks associated with information system operations.
The primary objectives of the authorizing official are to:
• Executive with authority and ability to evaluate the security risks
• Has either IT business oversight or budgetary responsibility
• Balance cost/benefit
• Must be government employee
• Make accreditation decisions
• Review security status reports from continuous monitoring operations
• Probably initiate reaccreditation actions based on status reports
Accordingly, authorizing officials are in management positions with a level of authority 
commensurate with understanding and accepting such information system-related security 
risks. Authorizing officials also approve security plans, memorandums of agreement or un-
derstanding, and plans of action and milestones and determine whether significant changes 
in the information systems or environments of operation require reauthorization. They can 
deny authorization to operate an information system or if the system is operational, halt op-
erations, if unacceptable risks exist.
Authorizing officials coordinate their activities with the risk executive (function), chief infor-
mation officer, senior information security officer, common control providers, information sys-
tem owners, information system security officers, security control assessors, and other interested 
parties during the security authorization process. With the increasing complexity of missions/
business processes, partnership arrangements, and the use of external/shared services, it is pos-
sible that a particular information system may involve multiple authorizing officials. If so, agree-
ments are established among the authorizing officials and documented in the security plan.
Authorizing officials are responsible for ensuring that all activities and functions associat-
ed with security authorization that are delegated to authorizing official designated represen-
tatives are carried out. The role of authorizing official has inherent US government authority 
and is assigned to government personnel only.
Information System Security Officer
The information system security officer is an individual responsible for ensuring that the ap-
propriate operational security posture is maintained for an information system and as such 
works in close collaboration with the information system owner.
The primary objectives of the information system security officer are to:
• Be primary advisor to the system owner on security matters
• Manage the security aspects of the information system

62	
6.  Roles and Responsibilities
﻿
• Assist the system owner:
•	 Develop and enforce security policies for the information system.
•	 Manage and control changes to the information system and assess the security impacts 
of those changes.
The information system security officer also serves as a principal advisor on all matters, 
technical and otherwise, involving the security of an information system.
The information system security officer should have the detailed knowledge and expertise 
required to manage the security aspects of an information system and, in many organizations, 
is assigned responsibility for the day-to-day security operations of a system. This responsibil-
ity may also include, but is not limited to, physical and environmental protection, personnel 
security, incident handling, and security training and awareness.
The information system security officer may be called upon to assist in the development of the 
security policies and procedures and to ensure compliance with those policies and procedures.
In close coordination with the information system owner, the information system security 
officer often plays an active role in the monitoring of a system and its environment of opera-
tion to include developing and updating the security plan, managing and controlling changes 
to the system, and assessing the security impact of those changes.
Information System Security Engineer
The information system security engineer is an individual, group, or organization responsible for 
conducting information system security engineering activities.
Information system security engineering is a process that captures and refines informa-
tion security requirements and ensures that the requirements are effectively integrated into 
information technology component products and information systems through purposeful 
security architecting, design, development, and configuration.
The primary objectives of the information system security engineer are to:
• Work as part of the development team
• Employ and install security control best practices
• Coordinate security-related activities:
•	 Equivalent to DIACAP Information Assurance Office (IAO)
Information system security engineers are an integral part of the development team (e.g., 
integrated project team), designing and developing organizational information systems or 
upgrading legacy systems. They employ best practices when implementing security controls 
within an information system including software engineering methodologies, system/secu-
rity engineering principles, secure design, secure architecture, and secure coding techniques.
System security engineers coordinate their security-related activities with information se-
curity architects, senior information security officers, information system owners, common 
control providers, and information system security officers.
Security Architect
The information security architect is an individual, group, or organization responsible for ensur-
ing that the information security requirements necessary to protect the organization’s core

63
﻿
missions and business processes are adequately addressed in all aspects of enterprise ar-
chitecture including reference models, segment and solution architectures, and the resulting 
information systems supporting those missions and business processes.
The primary objectives of the information security architect are to:
• Adequately addresses security requirements in enterprise  
architecture:
•	 Reference models
•	 Segment and solution architectures
•	 Resulting information systems
• Act as a liaison between the enterprise architect and information system security 
engineer
• Act as an advisor to senior officials on following topics:
•	 System boundaries
•	 Assessing severity of deficiencies
•	 POAMs
•	 Risk mitigation approaches
•	 Security alerts
The information security architect serves as the liaison between the enterprise architect 
and the information system security engineer and also coordinates with information system 
owners, common control providers, and information system security officers on the alloca-
tion of security controls as system-specific, hybrid, or common controls.
In addition, information security architects, in close coordination with information sys-
tem security officers, advise authorizing officials, chief information officers, senior informa-
tion security officers, and the risk executive (function), on a range of security-related issues 
including, for example, establishing information system boundaries, assessing the severity 
of weaknesses and deficiencies in the information system, plans of action and milestones, 
risk mitigation approaches, security alerts, and potential adverse effects of identified vulner-
abilities.
Common Control Provider
The common control provider is an individual, group, or organization responsible for the 
development, implementation, assessment, and monitoring of common controls (i.e., security 
controls inherited by information systems).
Common control providers are responsible for:
• Documenting the organization-identified common controls in a security plan (or 
equivalent document prescribed by the organization)
• Ensuring that required assessments of common controls are carried out by qualified 
assessors with an appropriate level of independence defined by the organization
• Documenting assessment findings in a security assessment report
• Appending a plan of action and milestones for any controls having weaknesses or 
deficiencies
• Ensuring that common controls within and across systems are properly documented and 
that documentation and communication are continuous

64	
6.  Roles and Responsibilities
﻿
Security plans, security assessment reports, and plans of action and milestones for com-
mon controls (or a summary of such information) are made available to information system 
owners inheriting those controls after the information is reviewed and approved by the senior 
official or executive with oversight responsibility for those controls.
Authorizing Official Designated Representative
The authorizing official designated representative is an organizational official that acts on be-
half of an authorizing official to coordinate and conduct the required day-to-day activities 
associated with the security authorization process.
The primary objectives of the authorizing official designated representative are to:
• Selected by the authorizing official
• Make certain decisions:
•	 Planning and sourcing of the security certification and accreditation activities
•	 Acceptance of the system security plan
•	 Determination of risk to agency operations, assets, and individuals
• Prepare accreditation decision letter
• Obtain authorizing official’s signature on appropriate documents
Authorizing official designated representatives can be empowered by authorizing officials 
to make certain decisions with regard to the planning and resourcing of the security authori-
zation process, approval of the security plan, approval and monitoring of the implementation 
of plans of action and milestones, and the assessment and/or determination of risk.
The designated representative may also be called upon to prepare the final authorization 
package, obtain the authorizing official’s signature on the authorization decision document, 
and transmit the authorization package to appropriate organizational officials.
The only activity that cannot be delegated to the designated representative by the autho-
rizing official is the authorization decision and signing of the associated authorization deci-
sion document (i.e., the acceptance of risk to organizational operations and assets, individu-
als, other organizations, and the nation).
Information Owner/Steward
The information owner/steward is an organizational official with statutory, management, 
or operational authority for specified information and the responsibility for establishing the 
policies and procedures governing its generation, collection, processing, dissemination, and 
disposal.
The information owner:
• Is an agency official with statutory or operational authority
• Is responsible for establishing rules for appropriate use of the information
• May, or may not, be the information system owner
• Can also be known as the data owner in the IC arena
In information-sharing environments, the information owner/steward is responsible for 
establishing the rules for appropriate use and protection of the subject information (e.g., rules 

	
Individual roles	
65
﻿
of behavior) and retains that responsibility even when the information is shared with or pro-
vided to other organizations. The owner/steward of the information processed, stored, or 
transmitted by an information system may or may not be the same as the system owner. 
A single information system may contain information from multiple information owners/
stewards. Information owners/stewards provide input to information system owners regard-
ing the security requirements and security controls for the systems where the information is 
processed, stored, or transmitted.
Risk Executive (Function)
The risk executive (function) is an individual or group within an organization that helps 
to ensure that:
• Risk-related considerations for individual information systems, to include authorization 
decisions, are viewed from an organization-wide perspective with regard to the overall 
strategic goals and objectives of the organization in carrying out its core missions and 
business functions.
• Managing information system-related security risks is consistent across the organization, 
reflects organizational risk tolerance, and is considered along with other types of risks in 
order to ensure mission/business success. The risk executive (function) coordinates with 
the senior leadership of an organization to:
• Provide a comprehensive, organization-wide, holistic approach for addressing risk – 
an approach that provides a greater understanding of the integrated operations of the 
organization
•	 Develop a risk management strategy for the organization providing a strategic  
view of information security-related risks with regard to the organization as a  
whole
•	 Facilitate the sharing of risk-related information among authorizing officials and other 
senior leaders within the organization
•	 Provide oversight for all risk management-related activities across the organization 
(e.g., security categorizations) to help ensure consistent and effective risk acceptance 
decisions
•	 Ensure that authorization decisions consider all factors necessary for mission and 
business success
•	 Provide an organization-wide forum to consider all sources of risk (including 
aggregated risk) to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other 
organizations, and the nation
•	 Promote cooperation and collaboration among authorizing officials to include 
authorization actions requiring shared responsibility
•	 Ensure that the shared responsibility for supporting organizational mission/business 
functions using external providers of information and services receives the needed 
visibility and is elevated to the appropriate decision-making authorities
•	 Identify the organizational risk posture based on the aggregated risk to information 
from the operation and use of the information systems for which the organization is 
responsible

66	
6.  Roles and Responsibilities
﻿
The risk executive (function) presumes neither a specific organizational structure nor formal 
responsibility assigned to any one individual or group within the organization. The head of 
the agency/organization may choose to retain the risk executive (function) or to delegate the 
function to another official or group (e.g., an executive leadership council). The risk executive 
(function) has inherent US government authority and is assigned to government personnel only.
User Representative
User representatives:
• Represent the operational interests of the user community
• Identify mission and operational requirements:
•	 Serve as liaisons for the user community
•	 Assist in the security certification and accreditation
• Comply with the security requirements and security controls
• Are identified in DOD, CNSS, and original 800-37 documents, but not in 800-37, rev. 1
Agency Head
The head of agency (or chief executive officer) is the highest-level senior official or executive 
within an organization with the overall responsibility to provide information security pro-
tections commensurate with the risk and magnitude of harm (i.e., impact) to organizational 
operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the nation resulting from unau-
thorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of:
1.	 Information collected or maintained by or on behalf of the agency
2.	 Information systems used or operated by an agency or by a contractor of an agency or 
other organization on behalf of an agency
Agency heads are also responsible for ensuring that:
1.	 Information security management processes are integrated with strategic and operational 
planning processes.
2.	 Senior officials within the organization provide information security for the information 
and information systems that support the operations and assets under their control.
3.	 The organization has trained personnel sufficient to assist in complying with the informa-
tion security requirements in related legislation, policies, directives, instructions, stan-
dards, and guidelines.
Through the development and implementation of strong policies, the head of agency es-
tablishes the organizational commitment to information security and the actions required to 
effectively manage risk and protect the core missions and business functions being carried 
out by the organization. The head of agency establishes appropriate accountability for infor-
mation security and provides active support and oversight of monitoring and improvement 
for the information security program. Senior leadership commitment to information security 
establishes a level of due diligence within the organization that promotes a climate for mis-
sion and business success.

	
Individual roles	
67
﻿
Agency head requirements from A-130 and FISMA are as follows:
• Plan for adequate security.
• Assign responsibilities.
• Review security controls.
• Authorize processing.
Security Control Assessor
The security control assessor is an individual, group, or organization responsible for conducting 
a comprehensive assessment of the management, operational, and technical security controls 
employed within or inherited by an information system to determine the overall effectiveness 
of the controls (i.e., the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as 
intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security require-
ments for the system).
The primary objectives of the security control assessor are to:
• Provide an independent assessment
• Assess the security controls:
•	 Implemented correctly
•	 Operating as intended
•	 Producing the desired outcome
• Provide recommended corrective actions
Security control assessors also provide an assessment of the severity of weaknesses or de-
ficiencies discovered in the information system and its environment of operation and recom-
mend corrective actions to address identified vulnerabilities.
In addition to these responsibilities, security control assessors prepare the final security 
assessment report containing the results and findings from the assessment.
Prior to initiating the security control assessment, an assessor conducts an assessment of 
the security plan to help ensure that the plan provides a set of security controls for the infor-
mation system that meet the stated security requirements.
The required level of assessor independence is determined by the specific conditions of the 
security control assessment. For example, when the assessment is conducted in support of an 
authorization decision or ongoing authorization, the authorizing official makes an explicit 
determination of the degree of independence required in accordance with federal policies, 
directives, standards, and guidelines.
Assessor independence is an important factor in:
• Preserving the impartial and unbiased nature of the assessment process
• Determining the credibility of the security assessment results
• Ensuring that the authorizing official receives the most objective information possible in 
order to make an informed, risk-based authorization decision
The information system owner and common control provider rely on the security expertise 
and the technical judgment of the assessor to:
• Assess the security controls employed within and inherited by the information system 
using assessment procedures specified in the security assessment plan

Introduction
WHAT IS AN ASSESSMENT?
An assessment of a system or application is the process of reviewing, testing, and evaluat-
ing the components, documentation, and all parameters of this system or application for the 
purpose of ensuring it is as secure as possible, within an organization’s risk tolerance, while 
it is operational and being utilized for its intended purpose.
As SP 800-53A on page 9 says, “An assessment procedure consists of a set of assessment 
objectives, each with an associated set of potential assessment methods and assessment objects. 
An assessment objective includes a set of determination statements related to the particular 
security or privacy control under assessment. The determination statements are linked to the 
content of the security or privacy control (i.e., the security/privacy control functionality) to 
ensure traceability of assessment results back to the fundamental control requirements. The 
application of an assessment procedure to a security or privacy control produces assessment 
findings. These findings reflect, or are subsequently used, to help determine the overall effec-
tiveness of the security or privacy control.” This results in determining if the control is, as SP 
800-53A points out:
1.	 Implemented correctly
2.	 Operating as intended
3.	 Producing the desired outcome in relation to the security requirements of the system or 
application under review

Introduction
﻿
Assessment objects identify the specific items being assessed and include specifications, mecha-
nisms, activities, and individuals.
1.	 Specifications are the document-based artifacts (e.g., policies, procedures, plans, system 
security and privacy requirements, functional specifications, architectural designs) 
associated with an information system, in other words – the documentation.
2.	 Mechanisms are the specific hardware, software, or firmware safeguards and countermeasures 
employed within an information system, in other words – the technical controls.
3.	 Activities are the specific protection-related actions supporting an information system that 
involve people (e.g., conducting system backup operations, monitoring network traffic, 
exercising a contingency plan), in other words – the processes.
4.	 Individuals, or groups of individuals, are people applying the specifications, mechanisms, 
or activities described above, in other words – the people.
The entire point of these various assessment areas and their coverage of the system and 
network under review is to provide assessment evidence that the decision makers can use to 
make their operational decisions from a viewpoint of trustworthiness as found in the follow-
ing figure from SP 800-53A:

	
Experiences and the process

﻿
EXPERIENCES AND THE PROCESS
I have conducted and overseen over 30 assessment efforts for 11 different agencies and 4 
commercial corporations during the past 4 years. There are always areas for improvement 
for each system. I view this as my job to determine if the system is really as secure as it can 
get, to make sure all users are reasonably safe and secure, and to make an analysis of the 
organizational and management policies and procedures to secure the national assets for 
the governmental agency that has requested our services. My assessment team and I have 
reviewed large-scale data centers with many highly sensitive government systems installed, 
small systems for federal microagencies with less than 100 employees, a single server web-
based system with public access information, and just about every type of system in be-
tween.
Assessment Process
The process I have developed over the years of conducting assessments, validations, and 
audits in support of authorization efforts has produced multiple ATOs for each and every ef-
fort I have been engaged for both contractually as an independent validator and governmen-
tally while working for federal agencies. The typical steps which I follow for an assessment 
when I conduct a review cover all of the areas defined in this handbook, defined by the SP 
800-37, rev. 1, process and usually produce SARs with defined areas of improvement for the 
organization to mitigate and repair, along with efforts of remediation which were performed 
and successfully completed during the assessment process. The standard steps are as follows:
1.	 Gather documents about system: The initial area for review I always start with is the already 
existing documentation for the system or application under test. These documents should 
provide the core areas for scrutiny and evaluation.
2.	 Review statutory and regulatory requirements: In the US governmental process, every 
system must conform to various statutory (law) and regulatory (policies and regulations) 
requirements, usually based on the information types used, processed, or held by 
the system and the system’s mission. Therefore, I look for areas of both compliance 
conformance and substantive agreement between the system, its documents, and the 
external requirements.
3.	 Conduct “GAP” analysis (15 steps): As discussed and defined in Chapter 8, I conduct the 
“GAP” analysis for all relevant system documents and supporting documentation. The 
steps are defined in that chapter.
4.	 Conduct risk assessment per SP 800-30: NIST put out the basic guide for risk assessments, 
SP 800-30, many years ago and I have adopted the use of that process in all of our 
endeavors and it has proven to be a trustworthy and successful methodology for 
conducting risk assessments under all circumstances where I have applied it.
5.	 Visit site – conduct preassessment: The first visit to the system location is usually conducted 
as part of the standard governmental project “kickoff” meeting event. We gather the 
documents during this process if they have not already been delivered to us beforehand.
a.	 Status: System status, project status, and mission status are all areas for discussion 
during this initial visit. Equipment status is a primary focus during this step so we can 
be prepared for any potential area of concern or suspicion.

74	
Introduction
﻿
b.	Expectations: During this visit, we conduct some expectation management with both 
the staff and the on-site management about our process, work efforts during the actual 
assessment visit, and our interchanges with the on-site personnel.
6.	 Build SAP and ROE: As part of the standard preparation for conducting an assessment, 
I will develop the Security Assessment Plan (SAP) which defines what actual steps 
are to be conducted during the assessment, what tools will be used, and what review 
techniques with what rigor to be applied will be utilized during the conduct of the actual 
on-site assessment.
	
There will be developed as part of this effort a document known as the Rules of 
Engagement (ROE) which defines the actual steps to be performed for the entire 
assessment, including any outside testing, interview conduct, and inspections as 
required by the organization. This ROE is a legal-type document which needs approval 
at the highest level possible above the AO since it can include penetration testing 
parameters and outside engagement events. I have often gotten this ROE signed by the 
organizational CIO or Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), whereas the SAP often 
needs only the AO signature for final approval.
7.	 Submit SAP and ROE for approval and acceptance: Once these two documents are finalized, I 
submit them to the contracting officer, if on contract to perform these activities, and they 
then route them for approval and signatures. I do not start the actual assessment visit 
until I have received the signed approved documents back through official means. Since 
these are legal documents for liability purposes I will not start the on-site engagement 
until I have these signed documents literally in hand.
8.	 Conduct assessment: Once the SAP and ROE are approved, I schedule the on-site visit to 
conduct the actual assessment activities. During this time I and my assessment team 
prepare for the visit by refamiliarizing ourselves with the tools of the trade, as well as 
reviewing the documentation for the system under review in order to properly conduct 
the interviews and examinations.
a.	 On-site visit: The on-site visit usually will start with an “in-briefing” meeting with the 
management of the location wherein we discuss expectations for the visit, reconfirm 
the interview scheduling, and introduce the team to the site staff.
–	 Interview key personnel: The interviews are conducted with key operational 
personnel for the system under review, the facilities manager for the location, the 
security personnel for both the location and the system under review, the system 
owner, if on-site, the system administration staff members for the location and the 
system under review, as well as any developers associated with the system under 
review.
–	 Examine system – get demo if possible: I will obtain a demonstration of the system from 
the staff in order to observe the processing, security controls in action as well as the 
input and output activities for the system. I will have the system run through its 
normal processing activities while watching it perform each action step. This allows 
me to see the security controls for Access Control, identification and authentication, 
system integrity, and system and communications protection in operation to verify 
their activities.
–	 Conduct a “security walk-through” inspection: Invariably I get the site facility 
manager to escort me and I will conduct a security “walk-through” inspection 

	
Experiences and the process

﻿
of the facility the system is housed in to include observing the physical security 
controls, checking out the fire suppression and detection controls in the facility, 
the HVAC system and its controls, and the utilities connected to the facility 
and their physical access. I will also observe the backup power capability of the 
location employed within the system. All of these inspections will verify physical 
and environmental, maintenance, media protection, and contingency planning 
controls for the system.
–	 Test system with tools as defined in SAP: The actual automated testing is conducted 
on the system with various tools and techniques to obtain evidence of compliance 
and security control configurations. Most, if not all, of the vulnerability 
scanners available produce results showing compliance with operating system 
configurations and patches loaded on the system. We will utilize various scan 
tools for the components of the system as defined in the SAP, such as database 
scanners, network mappers, vulnerability scanners, website scanning tools, and 
other specialized tools if necessary. Other automated tools will also be used for 
various tests to include file integrity checkers, wireless detection tools, if needed, 
and, if defined in the SAP and ROE, penetration testing tools to check the various 
security controls sets including Access Control, identification and authentication, 
system and communications protection, audit and accounting, and system integrity 
controls.
9.	 Initial analysis of results: On completion of the tool(s) running through their operations, 
I review the results with our assessment team for identification of high- or medium-
impact deficiencies or weaknesses. Additionally, we review the outputs from the test to 
ensure successful completion of the testing.
10.	 Provide customer/client with Remediation Report for action: Each automated tool used 
provides a method for immediate identification of problems and issues discovered 
during the tool operation and we take this data and provide it to the system 
administration staff either during the testing or right after completion in what I 
term a “Remediation Report” to allow the on-site staff to correct any deficiency or 
weakness of significant impact as soon as possible. Often the automated tool will 
produce results which need interpretation and evaluation since the tool often does 
not know which areas are externally mitigated. This results in what are known as 
“false-positive” results which require explanation and then removal from the final 
report.
11.	 Receive proof of remediation effort artifact evidence: On remediation, the on-site staff for the 
system under review provides the assessment team either the opportunity to rerun the 
automated tools to verify repair or the proof of remediation through the use of “screen 
shots” or output reports from the devices or machines in question. These documents 
and artifacts then get attached to or included in the SAR.
12.	 Build SAR: We start the development of the SAR during the testing phase by reviewing 
the examination and interview results and building the results from those parts of the 
evaluation. Once the testing phase is completed and our initial Remediation Report is 
delivered, we include the results of the scans and other tests in the SAR.
	
Following the template we have developed for the SAR, all areas are included, along 
with a full control-by-control results table in the SAR.

76	
Introduction
﻿
13.	 Review SAR with customer for additional action items: When the initial SAR is completed, 
we conduct a review of the preliminary results with the client to point out any 
additional areas or items which can be fixed, repaired, or remediated before the final 
delivery. The client often then addresses some or all of these areas and provides 
additional supporting documentation or proof of remediation and we include that in 
the final SAR.
14.	 Develop final SAR: Once all the reviews and discussions are completed, I complete the 
SAR in its final version and prepare the briefing for the AO to go with the report.
15.	 Develop Certification Letter: On full completion of the SAR and revisions to the SSP as the 
result of the assessment, I often am asked to complete a Certification Letter to the AO 
stating the results of the assessment and my opinion on the risks of the system and my 
recommendation for authorization.
16.	 Deliver SAR and Certification Letter to system owner and client: This is the final step of the 
process where I deliver the final SAR, final version of the SSP, and the Recommendation 
Letter to the AO and to the system owner for action.

Assessment Process
FOCUS
In order to conduct an assessment evaluation for a system or application, the focus initially 
needs to be on what areas are of highest impact, highest value, and highest volatility. Once 
that has been determined, the focus shifts to the rest of the system or application in order to 
cover all possible areas of impact since in the security arena, any method of attack or ingress 
into the system is possible today. As SP 800-115 tells us, some assessments focus on verifying 
that a particular security control (or set of controls) meets requirements, while other assess-
ments are intended to identify, validate, and assess a system’s exploitable security weakness-
es. Assessments are also performed to increase an organization’s ability to maintain a proac-
tive computer network defense. Assessments are not meant to take the place of implementing 
security controls and maintaining system security. SP 800-53A gives some more guidance on 
the focus and process as follows:
Building an effective assurance case (An assurance case is a body of evidence organized into an argument 
demonstrating that some claim about an information system holds (i.e., is assured). An assurance case is 
needed when it is important to show that a system exhibits some complex property such as safety, security, or 
reliability.) for security and privacy control effectiveness is a process that involves:
(i)	 Compiling evidence from a variety of activities conducted during the system development life cycle that 
the controls employed in the information system are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and 
producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security and privacy requirements of the sys-
tem and the organization; and
(ii)	Presenting this evidence in a manner that decision makers are able to use effectively in making risk-based 
decisions about the operation or use of the system.
The evidence described above comes from the implementation of the security and privacy controls in the 
information system and inherited by the system (i.e., common controls) and from the assessments of that 
implementation. Ideally, the assessor is building on previously developed materials that started with the 
specification of the organization’s information security and privacy needs and was further developed during 
the design, development, and implementation of the information system. These materials, developed while 
implementing security and privacy throughout the life cycle of the information system, provide the initial 
evidence for an assurance case.
Assessors obtain the required evidence during the assessment process to allow the appropriate organiza-
tional officials to make objective determinations about the effectiveness of the security and privacy controls 
and the overall security and privacy state of the information system. The assessment evidence needed to make 
such determinations can be obtained from a variety of sources including, for example, information technology

﻿
product and system assessments and, in the case of privacy assessments, privacy compliance documentation 
such as Privacy Impact Assessments and Privacy Act System of Record Notices. Product assessments (also 
known as product testing, evaluation, and validation) are typically conducted by independent, third-party 
testing organizations. These assessments examine the security and privacy functions of products and estab-
lished configuration settings. Assessments can be conducted to demonstrate compliance to industry, national, 
or international information security standards, privacy standards embodied in applicable laws and policies, 
and developer/vendor claims. Since many information technology products are assessed by commercial test-
ing organizations and then subsequently deployed in millions of information systems, these types of assess-
ments can be carried out at a greater level of depth and provide deeper insights into the security and privacy 
capabilities of the particular products.”1
The specialized focus from an assessor is needed when the system under test or the appli-
cation in question is in a high volatile environment, has just remediated security issues which 
have repaired, or requires an independent verification and validation review for further op-
erations on a federal network.
The SP 800-115 guide for technical assessments provides some focus for all testing events, 
too. “To accomplish technical security assessments and ensure that technical security testing 
and examinations provide maximum value, NIST recommends that organizations:
• Establish an information security assessment policy. This identifies the organization’s 
requirements for executing assessments, and provides accountability for the appropriate 
individuals to ensure assessments are conducted in accordance with these requirements. 
Topics that an assessment policy should address include the organizational requirements 
with which assessments must comply, roles and responsibilities, adherence to an established 
assessment methodology, assessment frequency, and documentation requirements.
• Implement a repeatable and documented assessment methodology. This provides 
consistency and structure to assessments, expedites the transition of new assessment 
staff, and addresses resource constraints associated with assessments. Using such 
a methodology enables organizations to maximize the value of assessments while 
minimizing possible risks introduced by certain technical assessment techniques. These 
risks can range from not gathering sufficient information on the organization’s security 
posture for fear of impacting system functionality to affecting the system or network 
availability by executing techniques without the proper safeguards in place. Processes 
that minimize risk caused by certain assessment techniques include using skilled 
assessors, developing comprehensive assessment plans, logging assessor activities, 
performing testing off-hours, and conducting tests on duplicates of production systems 
(e.g., development systems). Organizations need to determine the level of risk they are 
willing to accept for each assessment, and tailor their approaches accordingly.
• Determine the objectives of each security assessment, and tailor the approach 
accordingly. Security assessments have specific objectives, acceptable levels of risk, 
and available resources. Because no individual technique provides a comprehensive 
picture of an organization’s security when executed alone, organizations should use a 
combination of techniques. This also helps organizations to limit risk and resource usage.
• Analyze findings, and develop risk mitigation techniques to address weaknesses. 
To ensure that security assessments provide their ultimate value, organizations

﻿
should conduct root cause analysis upon completion of an assessment to enable the 
translation of findings into actionable mitigation techniques. These results may indicate 
that organizations should address not only technical weaknesses, but weaknesses in 
organizational processes and procedures as well.”2
As we begin the process of developing our assessment plans and procedures, it is now 
appropriate to seek guidance on methods, techniques, process flows, and objectives for our 
security testing, evaluations, and assessments.
GUIDANCE
Within the framework of the RMF process, SP 800-53A provides the specialized guidance 
and process flow for conducting the actual test and assessment events on each security con-
trol implemented in the system or application under evaluation. RMF step 4 – assessment – is 
the directed step within the RMF (SP 800-37, rev. 1) that provides the general guidance for 
conducting this step. Specialized assessment methodologies and techniques for testing and 
examining network-based processes and nonspecific security requirements are defined  
and explained in SP 800-115. The listing of the tasks for this assessment phase given in the 
next subsections is from SP 800-53A with some additional areas of focus and detail provided 
as we start the assessment activities.
SP 800-53A
See Fig. 7.1.
An assessment procedure consists of a set of assessment objectives, each with an associated set of poten-
tial assessment methods and assessment objects. An assessment objective includes a set of determination state-
ments related to the particular security or privacy control under assessment. The determination statements 
are linked to the content of the security or privacy control (i.e., the security/privacy control functionality) to 
ensure traceability of assessment results back to the fundamental control requirements. The application of an 
assessment procedure to a security or privacy control produces assessment findings. These findings reflect, or 
are subsequently used, to help determine the overall effectiveness of the security or privacy control.
Assessment objects identify the specific items being assessed and include specifications, mechanisms, activi-
ties, and individuals. Specifications are the document-based artifacts (e.g., policies, procedures, plans, system 
security and privacy requirements, functional specifications, architectural designs) associated with an infor-
mation system. Mechanisms are the specific hardware, software, or firmware safeguards and countermea-
sures employed within an information system. Activities are the specific protection-related actions supporting 
an information system that involve people (e.g., conducting system backup operations, monitoring network 
traffic, exercising a contingency plan). Individuals, or groups of individuals, are people applying the specifica-
tions, mechanisms, or activities described above.
Assessment methods define the nature of the assessor actions and include examine, interview, and test. 
The examine method is the process of reviewing, inspecting, observing, studying, or analyzing one or more 
assessment objects (i.e., specifications, mechanisms, or activities). The purpose of the examine method is to 
facilitate assessor understanding, achieve clarification, or obtain evidence. The interview method is the pro-
cess of holding discussions with individuals or groups of individuals within an organization to once again, 
facilitate assessor understanding, achieve clarification, or obtain evidence. The test method is the process of

exercising one or more assessment objects (i.e., activities or mechanisms) under specified conditions to com-
pare actual with expected behavior. In all three assessment methods, the results are used in making specific 
determinations called for in the determination statements and thereby achieving the objectives for the assess-
ment procedure.
Assessment methods have a set of associated attributes, depth and coverage, which help define the level 
of effort for the assessment. These attributes are hierarchical in nature, providing the means to define the 
rigor and scope of the assessment for the increased assurances that may be needed for some information 
systems. The depth attribute addresses the rigor of and level of detail in the examination, interview, and test-
ing processes. Values for the depth attribute include basic, focused, and comprehensive. The coverage attribute 
addresses the scope or breadth of the examination, interview, and testing processes including the number 
and type of specifications, mechanisms, and activities to be examined or tested, and the number and types of 
individuals to be interviewed. Similar to the depth attribute, values for the coverage attribute include basic, 
focused, and comprehensive. The appropriate depth and coverage attribute values for a particular assessment 
method are based on the assurance requirements specified by the organization. As assurance requirements 
increase with regard to the development, implementation, and operation of security and privacy controls 
within or inherited by the information system, the rigor and scope of the assessment activities (as reflected in 
the selection of assessment methods and objects and the assignment of depth and coverage attribute values) 
tend to increase as well.3
In addition to selecting appropriate assessment methods and objects, each assessment method (i.e., exam-
ine, interview, and test) is associated with depth and coverage attributes that are described in (SP 800-53A), 
Appendix D. The attribute values identify the rigor and scope of the assessment procedures executed by the 
assessor. The values selected by the organization are based on the characteristics of the information system 
being assessed (including assurance requirements) and the specific determinations to be made. The depth and 
coverage attribute values are associated with the assurance requirements specified by the organization (i.e., 
the rigor and scope of the assessment increases in direct relationship to the assurance requirements).4
RMF Step 4 – Assess Security Controls
As part of the Risk Management Framework, SP 800-37, rev. 1 provides the following tasks 
and guidance for each task during the prosecution of the assessment phase:
Task 1: assessment preparation – Develop, review, and approve a plan to assess the security 
controls.
Primary role of responsibility: Security Control Assessor.
The security assessment plan provides the objectives for the security control assessment, a detailed roadmap 
of how to conduct such an assessment, and assessment procedures. The assessment plan reflects the type of 
assessment the organization is conducting (e.g., developmental testing and evaluation, independent verifica-
tion and validation, assessments supporting security authorizations or reauthorizations, audits, continuous 
monitoring, assessments subsequent to remediation actions). Conducting security control assessments in par-
allel with the development/acquisition and implementation phases of the life cycle permits the identification 
of weaknesses and deficiencies early and provides the most cost-effective method for initiating corrective 
actions. Issues found during these assessments can be referred to authorizing officials for early resolution, as 
appropriate. The results of security control assessments carried out during system development and imple-
mentation can also be used (consistent with reuse criteria) during the security authorization process to avoid 
system fielding delays or costly repetition of assessments. The security assessment plan is reviewed and ap-
proved by appropriate organizational officials to ensure that the plan is consistent with the security objectives 
of the organization, employs state-of-the practice tools, techniques, procedures, and automation to support 
3SP 800-53A, rev. 4, IPD, p. 9–10.

7.  Assessment Process
﻿
the concept of continuous monitoring and near real-time risk management, and is cost-effective with regard to 
the resources allocated for the assessment. The purpose of the security assessment plan approval is two-fold:
(i)	 to establish the appropriate expectations for the security control assessment; and
(ii)	to bound the level of effort for the security control assessment.
An approved security assessment plan helps to ensure that an appropriate level of resources is applied 
toward determining security control effectiveness. When security controls are provided to an organization by 
an external provider (e.g., through contracts, interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements, licens-
ing agreements, and/or supply chain arrangements), the organization obtains a security assessment plan 
from the provider.
Organizations consider both the technical expertise and level of independence required in selecting security 
control assessors. Organizations also ensure that security control assessors possess the required skills and 
technical expertise to successfully carry out assessments of system-specific, hybrid, and common controls. 
This includes knowledge of and experience with the specific hardware, software, and firmware components 
employed by the organization. An independent assessor is any individual or group capable of conducting an 
impartial assessment of security controls employed within or inherited by an information system. Impartiality 
implies that assessors are free from any perceived or actual conflicts of interest with respect to the develop-
ment, operation, and/or management of the information system or the determination of security control ef-
fectiveness. Independent security control assessment services can be obtained from other elements within the 
organization or can be contracted to a public or private sector entity outside of the organization. Contracted 
assessment services are considered independent if the information system owner is not directly involved in 
the contracting process or cannot unduly influence the independence of the assessor(s) conducting the assess-
ment of the security controls. The authorizing official or designated representative determines the required 
level of independence for security control assessors based on the results of the security categorization process 
for the information system and the ultimate risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other 
organizations, and the Nation. The authorizing official determines if the level of assessor independence is 
sufficient to provide confidence that the assessment results produced are sound and can be used to support 
a risk-based decision on whether to place the information system into operation or continue its operation. In 
special situations, for example when the organization that owns the information system is small or the orga-
nizational structure requires that the security control assessment be accomplished by individuals that are in 
the developmental, operational, and/or management chain of the system owner, independence in the assess-
ment process can be achieved by ensuring that the assessment results are carefully reviewed and analyzed 
by an independent team of experts to validate the completeness, consistency, and veracity of the results. The 
authorizing official consults with the Office of the Inspector General, the senior information security officer, 
and the chief information officer to discuss the implications of any decisions on assessor independence in the 
types of special circumstances described above. This discussion may occur prior to each security assessment 
or only once if an organization is establishing an organizational policy and approach for specific special cir-
cumstances that will be applied to all information systems meeting the specific special circumstance criteria. 
Security control assessments in support of initial and subsequent security authorizations are conducted by 
independent assessors.5
Task 2: security control assessment – Assess the security controls in accordance with the 
assessment procedures defined in the security assessment plan.
Primary role of responsibility: Security Control Assessor.
Security control assessments determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operat-
ing as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for 
the information system. Security control assessments occur as early as practicable in the system development 
life cycle, preferably during the development phase of the information system. These types of assessments

Guidance

are referred to as developmental testing and evaluation and are intended to validate that the required security 
controls are implemented correctly and consistent with the established information security architecture. 
Developmental testing and evaluation activities include, for example, design and code reviews, application 
scanning, and regression testing. Security weaknesses and deficiencies identified early in the system develop-
ment life cycle can be resolved more quickly and in a much more cost-effective manner before proceeding 
to subsequent phases in the life cycle. The objective is to identify the information security architecture and 
security controls up front and to ensure that the system design and testing validate the implementation of 
these controls.
The information system owner relies on the technical expertise and judgment of assessors to:
(i)	 assess the security controls employed within or inherited by the information system using assessment 
procedures specified in the security assessment plan; and
(ii)	provide specific recommendations on how to correct weaknesses or deficiencies in the controls and reduce 
or eliminate identified vulnerabilities.
The assessor findings are an unbiased, factual reporting of the weaknesses and deficiencies discovered 
during the security control assessment. Organizations are encouraged to maximize the use of automation to 
conduct security control assessments to help:
(i)	 increase the speed and overall effectiveness and efficiency of the assessments; and
(ii)	support the concept of ongoing monitoring of the security state of organizational information systems.
When iterative development processes such as agile development are employed, this typically results in 
an iterative assessment as each cycle is conducted. A similar process is used for assessing security controls 
in COTS information technology products employed within the information system. Even when iterative 
development is not employed, organizations may choose to begin assessing security controls prior to the 
complete implementation of all security controls listed in the security plan. This type of incremental assessment 
is appropriate if it is more efficient or cost-effective to do so. For example, policy, procedures, and plans may 
be assessed prior to the assessment of the technical security controls in the hardware and software. In many 
cases, common controls (i.e., security controls inherited by the information system) may be assessed prior to 
the security controls employed within the system.
The organization ensures that assessors have access to:
(i)	 the information system and environment of operation where the security controls are employed; and
(ii)	the appropriate documentation, records, artifacts, test results, and other materials needed to assess the 
security controls.
In addition, assessors have the required degree of independence as determined by the authorizing official 
(see SP 800-53A, Appendix D.13 and Appendix F.4). Security control assessments in support of initial and 
subsequent security authorizations are conducted by independent assessors. Assessor independence during 
continuous monitoring, although not mandated, facilitates reuse of assessment results when reauthorization 
is required. When security controls are provided to an organization by an external provider (e.g., through con-
tracts, interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements, licensing agreements, and/or supply chain 
arrangements), the organization ensures that assessors have access to the information system/environment 
of operation where the controls are employed as well as appropriate information needed to carry out the as-
sessment. The organization also obtains any information related to existing assessments that may have been 
conducted by the external provider and reuses such assessment information whenever possible in accordance 
with the reuse criteria established by the organization. Descriptive information about the information system 
is typically documented in the system identification section of the security plan or included by reference or 
as attachments to the plan. Supporting materials such as procedures, reports, logs, and records showing evi-
dence of security control implementation are identified as well. In order to make the risk management process 
as timely and cost-effective as possible, the reuse of previous assessment results, when reasonable and appro-
priate, is strongly recommended. For example, a recent audit of an information system may have produced 
information about the effectiveness of selected security controls. Another opportunity to reuse previous as-
sessment results comes from programs that test and evaluate the security features of commercial information 
technology products. Additionally, if prior assessment results from the system developer are available, the

﻿
security control assessor, under appropriate circumstances, may incorporate those results into the assessment. 
And finally, assessment results are reused to support reciprocity where possible.6
Task 3: security assessment report – Prepare the security assessment report documenting the 
issues, findings, and recommendations from the security control assessment.
Primary role of responsibility: Security Control Assessor.
The results of the security control assessment, including recommendations for correcting any weaknesses 
or deficiencies in the controls, are documented in the security assessment report. The security assessment report 
is one of three key documents in the security authorization package developed for authorizing officials. The 
assessment report includes information from the assessor necessary to determine the effectiveness of the secu-
rity controls employed within or inherited by the information system based upon the assessor’s findings. The 
security assessment report is an important factor in an authorizing official’s determination of risk to organi-
zational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. Security control assessment 
results are documented at a level of detail appropriate for the assessment in accordance with the reporting 
format prescribed by organizational and/or federal policies. The reporting format is also appropriate for the 
type of security control assessment conducted (e.g., developmental testing and evaluation, self-assessments, 
independent verification and validation, independent assessments supporting the security authorization pro-
cess or subsequent reauthorizations, assessments during continuous monitoring, assessments subsequent to 
remediation actions, independent audits/evaluations).
Security control assessment results obtained during system development are brought forward in an in-
terim report and included in the final security assessment report. This supports the concept that the security 
assessment report is an evolving document that includes assessment results from all relevant phases of the 
system development life cycle including the results generated during continuous monitoring. Organizations 
may choose to develop an executive summary from the detailed findings that are generated during a security 
control assessment. An executive summary provides an authorizing official with an abbreviated version of 
the assessment report focusing on the highlights of the assessment, synopsis of key findings, and/or recom-
mendations for addressing weaknesses and deficiencies in the security controls.7
Task 4: remediation actions – Conduct initial remediation actions on security controls based 
on the findings and recommendations of the security assessment report and reassess 
remediated control(s), as appropriate.
Primary roles of responsibility: Information system owner or common control provider; 
Security Control Assessor.
The security assessment report provides visibility into specific weaknesses and deficiencies in the security 
controls employed within or inherited by the information system that could not reasonably be resolved during 
system development or that are discovered post-development. Such weaknesses and deficiencies are potential 
vulnerabilities if exploitable by a threat source. The findings generated during the security control assessment 
provide important information that facilitates a disciplined and structured approach to mitigating risks in 
accordance with organizational priorities. An updated assessment of risk (either formal or informal) based 
on the results of the findings produced during the security control assessment and any inputs from the risk 
executive (function), helps to determine the initial remediation actions and the prioritization of such actions. 
Information system owners and common control providers, in collaboration with selected organizational 
officials (e.g., information system security engineer, authorizing official designated representative, chief 
information officer, senior information security officer, information owner/steward), may decide, based on 
an initial or updated assessment of risk, that certain findings are inconsequential and present no significant 
risk to the organization. Alternatively, the organizational officials may decide that certain findings are in fact, 
significant, requiring immediate remediation actions. In all cases, organizations review assessor findings and 
determine the severity or seriousness of the findings (i.e., the potential adverse impact on organizational 
operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation) and whether the findings are

﻿
sufficiently significant to be worthy of further investigation or remediation. Senior leadership involvement 
in the mitigation process may be necessary in order to ensure that the organization’s resources are effectively 
allocated in accordance with organizational priorities, providing resources first to the information systems 
that are supporting the most critical and sensitive missions and business functions for the organization or 
correcting the deficiencies that pose the greatest degree of risk. If weaknesses or deficiencies in security controls 
are corrected, the security control assessor reassesses the remediated controls for effectiveness. Security 
control reassessments determine the extent to which the remediated controls are implemented correctly, 
operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements 
for the information system. Exercising caution not to change the original assessment results, assessors update 
the security assessment report with the findings from the reassessment. The security plan is updated based 
on the findings of the security control assessment and any remediation actions taken. The updated security 
plan reflects the actual state of the security controls after the initial assessment and any modifications by the 
information system owner or common control provider in addressing recommendations for corrective actions. 
At the completion of the assessment, the security plan contains an accurate list and description of the security 
controls implemented (including compensating controls) and a list of residual vulnerabilities.
Organizations can prepare an optional addendum to the security assessment report that is transmitted to the 
authorizing official. The optional addendum provides information system owners and common control provid-
ers an opportunity to respond to the initial findings of assessors. The addendum may include, for example, infor-
mation regarding initial remediation actions taken by information system owners or common control providers 
in response to assessor findings, or provide an owner’s perspective on the findings (e.g., including additional 
explanatory material, rebutting certain findings, and correcting the record). The addendum to the security as-
sessment report does not change or influence in any manner, the initial assessor findings provided in the original 
report. Information provided in the addendum is considered by authorizing officials in their risk-based authori-
zation decisions. Organizations may choose to employ an issue resolution process to help determine the appropriate 
actions to take with regard to the security control weaknesses and deficiencies identified during the assessment. 
Issue resolution can help address vulnerabilities and associated risk, false positives, and other factors that may 
provide useful information to authorizing officials regarding the security state of the information system includ-
ing the ongoing effectiveness of system-specific, hybrid, and common controls. The issue resolution process can 
also help to ensure that only substantive items are identified and transferred to the plan of actions and milestones.7
SP 800-115
The SP 800-115, “Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment,” pro-
vides the basic NIST-directed technical aspects of conducting information security assess-
ments for federal systems, networks, and applications. This guide presents technical testing 
and examination methods and techniques that an organization might use as part of an as-
sessment, and offers insights to assessors on these methods, their execution, and the potential 
impact they may have on systems and networks.
SP 800-115 provides assessment guidance for conducting technical reviews of systems. The 
document focuses the reviews thusly:
Dozens of technical security testing and examination techniques exist that can be used to assess the secu-
rity posture of systems and networks. The most commonly used techniques from the standpoint of this docu-
ment will be discussed in more depth later in this guide, and are grouped into the following three categories:
a.	 Review Techniques. These are examination techniques used to evaluate systems, applications, networks, 
policies, and procedures to discover vulnerabilities, and are generally conducted manually. They include 
documentation, log, rule-set, and system configuration review; network sniffing; and file integrity check-
ing. Section 3 provides additional information on review techniques.
7SP 800-37, rev. 1, updated June 2014, p. 32–33.

86	
7.  Assessment Process
﻿
b.	 Target Identification and Analysis Techniques. These testing techniques can identify systems, ports, ser-
vices, and potential vulnerabilities, and may be performed manually but are generally performed using 
automated tools. They include network discovery, network port and service identification, vulnerability 
scanning, wireless scanning, and application security examination.
c.	 Target Vulnerability Validation Techniques. These testing techniques corroborate the existence of vul-
nerabilities, and may be performed manually or by using automatic tools, depending on the specific tech-
nique used and the skill of the test team. Target vulnerability validation techniques include password 
cracking, penetration testing, social engineering, and application security testing.
Since no one technique can provide a complete picture of the security of a system or network, organiza-
tions should combine appropriate techniques to ensure robust security assessments. For example, penetration 
testing usually relies on performing both network port/service identification and vulnerability scanning to 
identify hosts and services that may be targets for future penetration. Also, multiple technical ways exist  
to meet an assessment requirement, such as determining whether patches have been applied properly.8
SP 800-115 goes on further with some strong cautionary warnings about testing:
Testing involves hands-on work with systems and networks to identify security vulnerabilities, and can be 
executed across an entire enterprise or on selected systems. The use of scanning and penetration techniques 
can provide valuable information on potential vulnerabilities and predict the likelihood that an adversary 
or intruder will be able to exploit them. Testing also allows organizations to measure levels of compliance in 
areas such as patch management, password policy, and configuration management.
Although testing can provide a more accurate picture of an organization’s security posture than what is 
gained through examinations, it is more intrusive and can impact systems or networks in the target envi-
ronment. The level of potential impact depends on the specific types of testing techniques used, which can 
interact with the target systems and networks in various ways—such as sending normal network packets to 
determine open and closed ports, or sending specially crafted packets to test for vulnerabilities. Any time that 
a test or tester directly interacts with a system or network, the potential exists for unexpected system halts 
and other denial of service conditions. Organizations should determine their acceptable levels of intrusive-
ness when deciding which techniques to use. Excluding tests known to create denial of service conditions and 
other disruptions can help reduce these negative impacts.9
So always be aware of the test environment, the operational mission and business environment, and 
the potential effects of the test methods and techniques the assessor is planning on using during the test 
activities on these important areas.
RMF Knowledge Service
Recently, DOD has adopted the NIST-based RMF as their guiding process for conduct-
ing assessments and authorizations of DOD unclassified and classified systems. With this 
effort underway, DOD has provided an online resource within the DOD network known as 
the RMF Knowledge Service at http://rmfks.osd.mil. This resource, available to only those 
personnel who have access and clearance to the DOD network, provides the DOD-specific 
criteria, testing methods, and validation procedures for all SP 800-53-based controls as they 
are installed and implemented in DOD systems. The RMF Knowledge Service is formatted 
after and based on the previously implemented DIACAP Knowledge Service which has pro-
vided guidance and procedures for conducting testing and evaluations in the DOD operating

space for the past 7 years. Since the transition timeline for moving to RMF in DOD is several 
years long, I expect both Knowledge Service sites to be available to authorized users for quite 
some time to come.
ISO 27001/27002
The international standard for Information Security Management Systems is the ISO 
standard of documents in the ISO 27000 series. Within the initial 2 documents, ISO 27001  
and ISO 27002, there are defined 14 security control classes of controls. Control Class 12.7 in the  
ISO 27001/27002 provides the basic guidance for auditing and reviewing the ISO control 
classes. It is entitled 12.7 Information Systems Audit Considerations and provides that IT audits 
should be planned and controlled to minimize adverse effects on production systems, or 
inappropriate data access. It ties into the subsequent ISO documents in the 27000 series ISO 
27007 and 27008 referenced as follows:
ISO/IEC 27007:2011 Information Technology – Security Techniques – Guidelines for Information 
Security Management Systems Auditing
ISO/IEC 27007 provides guidance for accredited certification bodies, internal auditors, external/third 
party auditors and others auditing ISMSs against ISO/IEC 27001 (i.e. auditing the management system for 
compliance with the standard).
ISO/IEC 27007 reflects and largely refers to ISO 19011, the ISO standard for auditing quality and environ-
mental management systems - “management systems” of course being the common factor linking it to the 
ISO27k standards. It provides additional ISMS-specific guidance.10
ISO/IEC TR 27008:2011 Information Technology – Security Techniques – Guidelines for Auditors 
on Information Security Management Systems Controls
ISO TR 27008: This standard (actually a “technical report”) on “technical auditing” complements ISO/IEC 
27007. It concentrates on auditing the information security controls, whereas ’27007 concentrates on auditing 
the management system elements of the ISMS.
This standard provides guidance for all auditors regarding “information security management systems 
controls” selected through a risk-based approach (e.g. as presented in a statement of applicability) for infor-
mation security management. It supports the information security risk management process and internal, 
external and third-party audits of an ISMS by explaining the relationship between the ISMS and its supporting 
controls. It provides guidance on how to verify the extent to which required “ISMS controls” are implement-
ed. Furthermore, it supports any organization using ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27002 to satisfy assurance 
requirements, and as a strategic platform for information security governance.
Most of the testing guidance and methods referenced within the ISO arena are formulated 
around international audit mechanisms, techniques, and practices, such as Control Objec-
tives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT), COSO, and others. As such, we will 
discuss the individual methods in Chapter 9 when we examine the control-specific testing 
techniques.

Assessment Methods
Now we reach the actual assessment actions part of this book. This chapter opens the win-
dow on the process of assessing, testing, and evaluating the system or application. The NIST 
guidance provides a path through the evaluation process utilizing test objectives with one or 
more of the associated defined test methods to be applied toward the test objects under re-
view. It has been my experience in performing these RMF-based assessments that the clients 
often want at least two methods of evaluation per control to be conducted and reported on 
during the process. Depending on the rigor to be applied to the assessment, this level of re-
view can significantly increase the amount of effort and schedule for each test, and therefore 
extend the schedule for the entire evaluation.
The purpose of NIST Special Publication 800-53A (as amended) is to establish common 
assessment procedures to assess the effectiveness of security controls in federal information 
systems, specifically those controls listed in NIST Special Publication 800-53 (as amended), Rec-
ommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations. The assessment 
methods and procedures are used to determine if the security controls are implemented cor-
rectly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting 
the security requirements of the organization. Organizations and other entities, such as com-
mercial corporations, use the recommended assessment procedures from SP 800-53A as the 
starting point for developing more specific assessment procedures, which may, in certain 
cases, be needed because of platform dependencies or other implementation-related consid-
erations. The assessment procedures in SP 800-53A can be supplemented by the organization, 
if needed, based on an organizational assessment of risk. Organizations must create addition-
al assessment procedures for those security controls that are not contained in SP 800-53. The 
employment of standardized assessment procedures promotes more consistent, comparable, 
and repeatable security assessments of federal information systems. SP 800-53A does provide 
a lot of guidance in the forefront of the document about setting up this process. It starts with 
the following:
An assessment procedure consists of a set of assessment objectives, each with an associated set of poten-
tial assessment methods and assessment objects. An assessment objective includes a set of determination state-
ments related to the particular security or privacy control under assessment. The determination statements 
are linked to the content of the security or privacy control (i.e., the security/privacy control functionality) to 
ensure traceability of assessment results back to the fundamental control requirements. The application of an 
assessment procedure to a security or privacy control produces assessment findings. These findings reflect, or 
are subsequently used, to help determine the overall effectiveness of the security or privacy control.

90	
8.  Assessment Methods
﻿
Assessment objects identify the specific items being assessed and include specifications, mechanisms, activi-
ties, and individuals.
a.)	 Specifications are the document-based artifacts (e.g., policies, procedures, plans, system security and pri-
vacy requirements, functional specifications, architectural designs) associated with an information system.
b.)	Mechanisms are the specific hardware, software, or firmware safeguards and countermeasures employed 
within an information system.
c.)	 Activities are the specific protection-related actions supporting an information system that involve people 
(e.g., conducting system backup operations, monitoring network traffic, exercising a contingency plan).
d.)	Individuals, or groups of individuals, are people applying the specifications, mechanisms, or activities 
described above.
Assessment methods define the nature of the assessor actions and include examine, interview, and test. 
The examine method is the process of reviewing, inspecting, observing, studying, or analyzing one or more 
assessment objects (i.e., specifications, mechanisms, or activities). The purpose of the examine method is to 
facilitate assessor understanding, achieve clarification, or obtain evidence. The interview method is the pro-
cess of holding discussions with individuals or groups of individuals within an organization to once again, 
facilitate assessor understanding, achieve clarification, or obtain evidence. The test method is the process of 
exercising one or more assessment objects (i.e., activities or mechanisms) under specified conditions to com-
pare actual with expected behavior. In all three assessment methods, the results are used in making specific 
determinations called for in the determination statements and thereby achieving the objectives for the assess-
ment procedure.1
EVALUATION METHODS AND THEIR ATTRIBUTES
Both of the primary testing documents from NIST, SP 800-53A and SP 800-115, address 
various methods and techniques for different kinds of testing activities. SP 800-53A states it 
as follows:
Assessment methods have a set of associated attributes, depth and coverage, which help define the level of 
effort for the assessment. These attributes are hierarchical in nature, providing the means to define the rigor 
and scope of the assessment for the increased assurances that may be needed for some information systems.
a.)	 The depth attribute addresses the rigor of and level of detail in the examination, interview, and testing 
processes. Values for the depth attribute include basic, focused, and comprehensive. The coverage attribute 
addresses the scope or breadth of the examination, interview, and testing processes including the number 
and type of specifications, mechanisms, and activities to be examined or tested, and the number and types 
of individuals to be interviewed.
b.)	Similar to the depth attribute, values for the coverage attribute include basic, focused, and comprehensive. 
The appropriate depth and coverage attribute values for a particular assessment method are based on the 
assurance requirements specified by the organization.
These attributes are further explained in the supplemental NIST guidance for assessments 
for each family of controls found on the NIST site. The supplemental guidance is provided 
to assist the assessment activity for each family of controls as they are reviewed. The action 
statements provided in the assessment test plans are written using the basic (i.e., foundation) 
level of assessment depth and coverage attribute values. An increased rigor and/or scope of 
the action statement can be expressed by replacing the basic level of assessment depth and

coverage attribute value with other defined values. The potential attribute values for varying 
depth and coverage for the assessment methods (examine, interview, and test) in the action 
statements are as follows:
Coverage Attribute Values:
Basic Sample attribute value is used to indicate a ‘basic’ level of scope or breath of coverage; that is, a rep-
resentative sample of assessment objects (by type and number within type) to provide a level of coverage 
necessary for determining if the control meets the ‘basic’ criteria listed below.
Focused Sample attribute value is available for use to indicate a ‘focused’ level of scope or breadth cover-
age; that is, an extended basic sample to include other specific assessment objects important to achieving 
the assessment objective to provide a level of coverage necessary for determining if the control meets the 
‘focused’ coverage criteria listed below.
Sufficiently Large Sample attribute value is available for use to indicate a ‘comprehensive’ level of scope or 
breadth of coverage; that is, an extended focused sample to include more assessment objects to provide a 
level of coverage necessary for determining if the control meets the ‘comprehensive’ coverage criteria listed 
below.
Depth Attribute Values:
Specific action verbs identified in SP 800-53A, Appendix D, in the definition of the examine method are 
employed in the application of the Action Steps of the Assessment Cases to indicate level of rigor for examin-
ing the different types of assessment objects (i.e., documentation, activities and mechanisms) as follows:
Examine documentation rigor – ‘reading’:
Review attribute value for reading documentation is used for the ‘basic’ level of rigor and level of detail; 
that is, a high-level examination of documentation looking for required content and for any obvious errors, 
omissions, or inconsistencies.
Study attribute value for reading documentation is available for use for the ‘focused’ level of rigor and level 
of detail; that is, an examination of documentation that includes the intent of ‘review’ and adds a more 
in-depth examination for greater evidence to support a determination of whether the document has the 
required content and is free of obvious errors, omissions, and inconsistencies.
Analyze attribute value for reading documentation is available for use for the ‘comprehensive’ level of rigor 
and level of detail; that is, an examination of documentation that includes the intent of both ‘review’ and 
‘study’; adding a thorough and detailed analysis for significant grounds for confidence in the determination 
of whether the required content is present and the document is correct, complete, and consistent.
Examine activities and mechanisms rigor – ‘watching’:
Observe attribute value for watching activities and mechanisms is used for the ‘basic’ level of rigor and level 
of detail; that is, watching the execution of an activity or process or looking directly at a mechanism (as op-
posed to reading documentation produced by someone other than the assessor about that mechanism) for 
the purpose of seeing whether the activity or mechanism appears to operate as intended (or in the case of 
a mechanism, perhaps is configured as intended) and whether there are any obvious errors, omissions, or 
inconsistencies in the operation or configuration.
Inspect attribute value for watching activities and mechanisms is available for use for the ‘focused’ level of 
rigor and level of detail; that is, adding to the watching associated with ‘observe’ an active investigation 
to gain further grounds for confidence in the determination of whether that the activity or mechanism is 
operating as intended and is free of errors, omissions, or inconsistencies in the operation or configuration.
Analyze attribute value for watching activities and mechanisms is available for use for the ‘comprehen-
sive’ level of rigor and level of detail; that is, adding to the watching and investigation of ‘observe’ and 
‘inspect’ a thorough and detailed analysis of the information to develop significant grounds for confidence 
in the determination as to whether the activity or mechanism is operating as intended and is free of errors, 
omissions, or inconsistencies in the operation or configuration. Analysis achieves this by both leading to

further observations and inspections and by a greater understanding of the information obtained from the 
examination.
Interview individual or group rigor:
Basic attribute value for interviewing individuals and groups is used for the ‘basic’ level of rigor and level of 
detail; that is, a high-level interview looking for evidence to support a determination of whether the control 
meets the ‘basic’ interview criteria listed below.
Focused attribute value for interviewing individuals and groups is available for use for the ‘focused’ level 
of rigor and level of detail; that is, an interview that includes the intent of ‘basic’ and adds a more in-depth 
interview for greater evidence to support a determination of whether the control meets the ‘focused’ inter-
view criteria listed below.
Comprehensive attribute value for interviewing individuals and groups is available for use for the ‘compre-
hensive’ level of rigor and level of detail; that is, an interview that includes the intent of both ‘basic’ and 
‘focused’; adding a thorough and detailed analysis for significant grounds for confidence in the determina-
tion of whether the control meets the ‘comprehensive’ interview criteria listed below.
Test Mechanisms and Activities rigor:
Basic attribute value for mechanisms and activities is used for the ‘basic’ level of rigor and level of detail; 
that is, a basic level of testing looking for evidence to support a determination of whether the control meets 
the ‘basic’ test criteria listed below.
Focused attribute value for mechanisms and activities is available for use for the ‘focused’ level of rigor and 
level of detail; that is, a focused level of testing that includes the intent of ‘basic’ and adds a more in-depth 
testing for greater evidence to support a determination of whether the control meets the ‘focused’ test cri-
teria listed below.
Comprehensive attribute value for mechanisms and activities is available for use for the ‘comprehensive’ 
level of rigor and level of detail; that is, a comprehensive level of testing that includes the intent of both 
‘basic’ and ‘focused’; adding a thorough and detailed analysis for significant grounds for confidence in the 
determination of whether the control meets the ‘comprehensive’ test criteria listed below.
The depth and coverage attributes do not alter the logical sequencing, totality, or selection of evidence 
gathering actions; rather these attributes served as providing/supporting degrees of assessment rigor.2
These detailed explanations provide a good basis for understanding the different levels of 
assessment as well as defining how each attribute is uniquely identified and assessed during 
the differing levels of assessment: basic, focused, and comprehensive. To the assessor, the 
method for evaluating a control is often flexible based on organizational requests and as-
sessor experience. Hence, assessor-defined parameters are often identified within the action 
statement for selecting an appropriate depth (i.e., level of detail required) and coverage (i.e., 
scope) of application of the assessment method for assessing the security control.
As assurance requirements increase with regard to the development, implementation, and 
operation of security and privacy controls within or inherited by the information system, the 
rigor and scope of the assessment activities (as reflected in the selection of assessment meth-
ods and objects and the assignment of depth and coverage attribute values) tend to increase 
as well.
I am going to put together the various criteria for evaluation and the methods interweaving 
the guidance to give a picture of how the methods, specifications, objects, and the activities

work together to build a complete assurance case that is usable, presentable, and, as best as 
possible, comprehensive enough for use in a Security Assessment Report to the organization’s 
executives and authorizing officials.
PROCESSES
SP 800-115 gives the following explanation of what we are endeavoring to accomplish with 
the testing, evaluations and assessments. “An information security assessment is the process 
of determining how effectively an entity being assessed (e.g., host, system, network, proce-
dure, person—known as the assessment object) meets specific security objectives. Three types 
of assessment methods can be used to accomplish this—testing, examination, and interview-
ing. Testing is the process of exercising one or more assessment objects under specified con-
ditions to compare actual and expected behaviors. Examination is the process of checking, 
inspecting, reviewing, observing, studying, or analyzing one or more assessment objects to 
facilitate understanding, achieve clarification, or obtain evidence. Interviewing is the process 
of conducting discussions with individuals or groups within an organization to facilitate un-
derstanding, achieve clarification, or identify the location of evidence. Assessment results are 
used to support the determination of security control effectiveness over time.”3
For each of the methods below, I will first provide the NIST guidance, and then supple-
ment the process flows with additional suggested techniques and procedures that I have used 
during assessments over the years.
Please note: The “bold” attribute used in each of these three method descriptions is directly 
from the NIST documents.
Interviews
Interviewing is the process of conducting discussions with individuals or groups within 
an organization to facilitate understanding, achieve clarification, or identify the location of 
evidence. This process for the assessment is often the initial step accomplished once the as-
sessment team is on-site and ready to start the actual evaluation.
Method: Interview.
Assessment objects: Individuals or groups of individuals.
Definition: The process of conducting discussions with individuals or groups within an 
organization to facilitate understanding, achieve clarification, or lead to the location of evi-
dence, the results of which are used to support the determination of security and privacy 
control existence, functionality, correctness, completeness, and potential for improvement 
over time.
Guidance: Typical assessor actions may include, for example, interviewing agency heads, 
chief information officers, senior agency information security officers, authorizing officials, 
information owners, information system and mission owners, information system security of-
ficers, information system security managers, personnel officers, human resource ­managers,

facilities managers, training officers, information system operators, network and system ad-
ministrators, site managers, physical security officers, and users.
Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)-validated tools that support the Open 
Checklist Interactive Language (OCIL) component specification may be used to automate the 
interview process for specific individuals or groups of individuals. The resulting information 
can then be examined by assessors during the security and privacy control assessments.
Attributes: Depth and coverage:
• The depth attribute addresses the rigor of and level of detail in the interview process. 
There are three possible values for the depth attribute:
•	 Basic:
-	 Basic interview: Interview that consists of broad-based, high-level discussions 
with individuals or groups of individuals. This type of interview is conducted 
using a set of generalized, high-level questions. Basic interviews provide a level 
of understanding of the security and privacy controls necessary for determining 
whether the controls are implemented and free of obvious errors.
•	 Focused:
-	 Focused interview: Interview that consists of broad-based, high-level discussions 
and more in-depth discussions in specific areas with individuals or groups of 
individuals. This type of interview is conducted using a set of generalized, high-
level questions and more in-depth questions in specific areas where responses 
indicate a need for more in-depth investigation. Focused interviews provide 
a level of understanding of the security and privacy controls necessary for 
determining whether the controls are implemented and free of obvious errors 
and whether there are increased grounds for confidence that the controls are 
implemented correctly and operating as intended.
•	 Comprehensive:
-	 Comprehensive interview: Interview that consists of broad-based, high-level 
discussions and more in-depth, probing discussions in specific areas with 
individuals or groups of individuals. This type of interview is conducted using a 
set of generalized, high-level questions and more in-depth, probing questions in 
specific areas where responses indicate a need for more in-depth investigation. 
Comprehensive interviews provide a level of understanding of the security and 
privacy controls necessary for determining whether the controls are implemented 
and free of obvious errors and whether there are further increased grounds for 
confidence that the controls are implemented correctly and operating as intended 
on an ongoing and consistent basis, and that there is support for continuous

• The coverage attribute addresses the scope or breadth of the interview process and 
includes the types of individuals to be interviewed (by organizational role and associated 
responsibility), the number of individuals to be interviewed (by type), and specific 
individuals to be interviewed. (The organization, considering a variety of factors (e.g., 
available resources, importance of the assessment, the organization’s overall assessment 
goals and objectives), confers with assessors and provides direction on the type, number, 
and specific individuals to be interviewed for the particular attribute value described.) 
There are three possible values for the coverage attribute:

•	 Basic:
-	 Basic interview: Interview that uses a representative sample of individuals in key 
organizational roles to provide a level of coverage necessary for determining 
whether the security and privacy controls are implemented and free of obvious 
errors.
•	 Focused:
-	 Focused interview: Interview that uses a representative sample of individuals in key 
organizational roles and other specific individuals deemed particularly important 
to achieving the assessment objective to provide a level of coverage necessary for 
determining whether the security and privacy controls are implemented and free 
of obvious errors and whether there are increased grounds for confidence that the 
controls are implemented correctly and operating as intended.
•	 Comprehensive:
-	 Comprehensive interview: Interview that uses a sufficiently large sample of 
individuals in key organizational roles and other specific individuals deemed 
particularly important to achieving the assessment objective to provide a level of 
coverage necessary for determining whether the security and privacy controls are 
implemented and free of obvious errors and whether there are further increased 
grounds for confidence that the controls are implemented correctly and operating 
as intended on an ongoing and consistent basis, and that there is support for 
continuous improvement in the effectiveness of the controls.4
Examinations
Examinations primarily involve the review of documents such as policies, procedures, security plans, 
security requirements, standard operating procedures, architecture diagrams, engineering documentation, 
asset inventories, system configurations, rule-sets, and system logs. They are conducted to determine whether 
a system is properly documented, and to gain insight on aspects of security that are only available through 
documentation. This documentation identifies the intended design, installation, configuration, operation, and 
maintenance of the systems and network, and its review and cross-referencing ensures conformance and con-
sistency. For example, an environment’s security requirements should drive documentation such as system 
security plans and standard operating procedures—so assessors should ensure that all plans, procedures, 
architectures, and configurations are compliant with stated security requirements and applicable policies. 
Another example is reviewing a firewall’s rule-set to ensure its compliance with the organization’s security 
policies regarding Internet usage, such as the use of instant messaging, peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing, and 
other prohibited activities.
Examinations typically have no impact on the actual systems or networks in the target environment aside 
from accessing necessary documentation, logs, or rule-sets. One passive testing technique that can potentially 
impact networks is network sniffing, which involves connecting a sniffer to a hub, tap, or span port on the 
network. In some cases, the connection process requires reconfiguring a network device, which could disrupt 
operations. However, if system configuration files or logs are to be retrieved from a given system such as a 
router or firewall, only system administrators and similarly trained individuals should undertake this work 
to ensure that settings are not inadvertently modified or deleted.5

8.  Assessment Methods
﻿
Method: Examine.
Assessment objects: Specifications (e.g., policies, plans, procedures, system requirements, 
designs), mechanisms (e.g., functionality implemented in hardware, software, firmware), and 
activities (e.g., system operations, administration, management, exercises).
Definition: The process of checking, inspecting, reviewing, observing, studying, or analyz-
ing one or more assessment objects to facilitate understanding, achieve clarification, or obtain 
evidence, the results of which are used to support the determination of security and privacy 
control existence, functionality, correctness, completeness, and potential for improvement 
over time.
Supplemental guidance: Typical assessor actions may include, for example, reviewing in-
formation security policies, plans, and procedures; analyzing system design documenta-
tion and interface specifications; observing system backup operations; reviewing the results 
of contingency plan exercises; observing incident response activities; studying technical 
manuals and user/administrator guides; checking, studying, or observing the operation of 
an information technology mechanism in the information system hardware/software; or 
checking, studying, or observing physical security measures related to the operation of an 
information system.
SCAP-validated tools that support the OCIL component specification may be used to au-
tomate the collection of assessment objects from specific, responsible individuals within an 
organization. The resulting information can then be examined by assessors during the secu-
rity and privacy control assessments.
Attributes: Depth and coverage:
• The depth attribute addresses the rigor of and level of detail in the examination process. 
There are three possible values for the depth attribute:
•	 Basic:
-	 Basic examination: Examination that consists of high-level reviews, checks, 
observations, or inspections of the assessment object. This type of examination is 
conducted using a limited body of evidence or documentation (e.g., functional-level 
descriptions for mechanisms; high-level process descriptions for activities; actual 
documents for specifications). Basic examinations provide a level of understanding 
of the security and privacy controls necessary for determining whether the controls 
are implemented and free of obvious errors.
•	 Focused:
-	 Focused examination: Examination that consists of high-level reviews, checks, 
observations, or inspections and more in-depth studies/analyses of the assessment 
object. This type of examination is conducted using a substantial body of evidence 
or documentation (e.g., functional-level descriptions and, where appropriate and 
available, high-level design information for mechanisms; high-level process 
descriptions and implementation procedures for activities; the actual documents 
and related documents for specifications). Focused examinations provide a level 
of understanding of the security and privacy controls necessary for determining 
whether the controls are implemented and free of obvious errors and whether there 
are increased grounds for confidence that the controls are implemented correctly 
and operating as intended.

97
﻿
•	 Comprehensive:
-	 Comprehensive examination: Examination that consists of high-level reviews, checks, 
observations, or inspections and more in-depth, detailed, and thorough studies/
analyses of the assessment object. This type of examination is conducted using an 
extensive body of evidence or documentation (e.g., functional-level descriptions 
and, where appropriate and available, high-level design information, low-level 
design information, and implementation information for mechanisms; high-
level process descriptions and detailed implementation procedures for activities; 
the actual documents and related documents for specifications (while additional 
documentation is likely for mechanisms when moving from basic to focused to 
comprehensive examinations, the documentation associated with specifications and 
activities may be the same or similar for focused and comprehensive examinations, 
with the rigor of the examinations of these documents being increased at 
the comprehensive level)). Comprehensive examinations provide a level of 
understanding of the security and privacy controls necessary for determining 
whether the controls are implemented and free of obvious errors and whether there 
are further increased grounds for confidence that the controls are implemented 
correctly and operating as intended on an ongoing and consistent basis, and that 
there is support for continuous improvement in the effectiveness of the controls.
• The coverage attribute addresses the scope or breadth of the examination process 
and includes the types of assessment objects to be examined, the number of objects 
to be examined (by type), and specific objects to be examined. (The organization, 
considering a variety of factors (e.g., available resources, importance of the assessment, 
the organization’s overall assessment goals and objectives), confers with assessors and 
provides direction on the type, number, and specific objects to be examined for the

There are three possible values for the coverage attribute:
(i)	 Basic

Observations
It is a fact that considerable data can be collected by just observing. Direct observation is 
an underused and valuable method for collecting evaluation information. “Seeing” and “lis-
tening” are key to observation. Observation provides the opportunity to document activities, 
behavior, and physical aspects without having to depend on peoples’ willingness and ability 
to respond to interview questions or isolate the exact document which is relevant to a par-
ticular control or risk. As described above from the examination phase of testing, observing 
practices and implementation of procedures is often a good evaluation method for review of 
control implementation, especially in the operational control families. Often we are observing 
system backup operations, observing incident response activities, observing the operation 
of an information technology mechanism in the information system hardware/software, or 
observing physical security measures related to the operation of an information system.
The two primary methods of observation which I employ are the use of system-level dem-
onstrations and what I term “security walk-throughs.” System demonstrations are a great 
way to observe the actions of the system under review, especially for systems which are new 
or recently modified. The demonstration should include log-in actions, standard system 
processing, and system-level interactions and reporting. There are a lot of areas of security 
control implementations which can be observed during demonstrations. Access controls and 
identification and authorization actions to log into a system, password protection, and meth-
ods of system and communications protection are all areas of significance and focus during 
an observation of system demonstration of functionality and processing.
A “security walk-through inspection” consists of my observer walking throughout a facil-
ity and looking for the methods of physical security employed within the facility. Identifica-
tion of physical access controls for sections of the facility, methods of intrusion detection, 
deployed fire detection and suppression components, and HVAC controls which are used in 
the facility are all “observed” and accounted for during the walk-through and recorded in 
the assessment report as examined through observation. I have employed this technique to 
conduct focused examinations.
Document Reviews
Documentation review determines if the technical aspects of policies and procedures are 
current and comprehensive. These documents provide the foundation for an organization’s 
security posture, but are often overlooked during technical assessments. Security groups 
within the organization should provide assessors with appropriate documentation to ensure 
a comprehensive review. Documents are reviewed for technical accuracy and completeness 
will include security policies, architectures, and requirements; standard operating proce-
dures; system security plans and authorization agreements; memoranda of understanding 
and agreement for system interconnections; and incident response plans.
Documentation review can discover gaps and weaknesses that could lead to missing or 
improperly implemented security controls. Assessors typically verify that the organization’s 
documentation is compliant with standards and regulations such as FISMA, and look for 
policies that are deficient or outdated. Common documentation weaknesses include OS se-
curity procedures or protocols that are no longer used, and failure to include a new OS and 
its protocols. Documentation review does not ensure that security controls are implemented 
properly – only that the direction and guidance exist to support security infrastructure.

	
Processes	
99
﻿
Results of documentation review can be used to fine-tune other testing and examination 
techniques. For example, if a password management policy has specific requirements for 
minimum password length and complexity, this information can be used to configure pass-
word-cracking tools for more efficient performance.
1.	 “Gap” analysis process: The initial document reviews which start off the assessment 
process often provide data to the assessor and the assessment team to use in providing 
focus and pinpoint areas of potential concern to review, examine, evaluate, and test the 
system or application under review. These document reviews allow the assessment team 
to identify recently repaired controls, areas of volatility in controls and protection, and 
potentially areas overlooked or reduced in strength of control protection. This leads to 
a “gap analysis” which can determine what requirements, operational criteria, security 
objectives, and compliance needs are and are not being met by the system under review. 
This “gap analysis” process often has been used to discover areas of weakness in poli-
cies, procedures, and reporting for systems and applications. The “gap analysis” process 
which I often used is described as follows:
(a)	 Review each authorization package using the 15-step methodology outlined below. 
Using this defined process for review promotes consistency and quality of package 
analysis.
-	 Review current documents for completeness and accuracy, based on the established 
security baseline.
-	 Review current documents for System Security Classification and level 
determination.
-	 Catalog current documents into security areas.
-	 Develop mapping for current documents to FISMA, DOD IA regulations (if 
applicable), NIST guidance, US governmental agency regulations (if applicable), 
and FIPS standards (DODI 8510.01, SP 800-37, SP 800-53, SP 800-53A, FIPS-199, etc.).
-	 Review current documents for mapping status.
-	 Identify preliminary documents, policies, plans, or procedures with questionable 
mapping status.
-	 Research any missing or unclear policies, procedures, plans, or guidelines in 
support documentation.
-	 Develop questions and issue report for customer remediation, answers, and 
identification.
-	 Identify agency standards and guidelines for document creation and development.
-	 Develop missing and required policies, plans, or procedures, as required such as:
(i)	 System of Record Notice (SORN) to register the system
(ii)	 Residual risk assessment
(iii)	Plan of Action and Milestone (POAM)
(iv)	Any additional Assessment and Authorization (A&A)-related artifacts as part of 
the submission package, such as:
• Security Concept of Operations (CONOPS)
• Security policies
• Security architecture drawings and documents
• Security User Security Manual and Standing Operating Procedures (USM/SOP)
• Continuity of Operations (COOP)

﻿
• Incident Response Plan
• Contingency Plan
• Configuration Management Plan
-	 Submit these developed documents for review, comment, revision, and approval.
-	 Once all documents and questions are answered, review vulnerability scans for 
actual technical controls implemented versus controls documented.
-	 Develop report on controls assessment.
-	 Complete required RMF certification and accreditation worksheets, documents, and 
forms.
-	 Develop SCA ATO Recommendation and Risk Assessment Reports, IAW the 
agency requirements.
-	 The completed review is then submitted to the quality assurance review for the 
internal consistency, completeness, and correctness (3C) review.
(i)	The consistency, completeness, and correctness of the documentation are 
determined, and if quality standards are met, the documentation is then passed 
on to final submittal phase.
Testing
Testing involves hands-on work with systems and networks to identify security vulnerabilities, and can be 
executed across an entire enterprise or on selected systems. The use of scanning and penetration techniques 
can provide valuable information on potential vulnerabilities and predict the likelihood that an adversary 
or intruder will be able to exploit them. Testing also allows organizations to measure levels of compliance in 
areas such as patch management, password policy, and configuration management.
Although testing can provide a more accurate picture of an organization’s security posture than what is 
gained through examinations, it is more intrusive and can impact systems or networks in the target envi-
ronment. The level of potential impact depends on the specific types of testing techniques used, which can 
interact with the target systems and networks in various ways—such as sending normal network packets to 
determine open and closed ports, or sending specially crafted packets to test for vulnerabilities. Any time that 
a test or tester directly interacts with a system or network, the potential exists for unexpected system halts 
and other denial of service conditions. Organizations should determine their acceptable levels of intrusive-
ness when deciding which techniques to use. Excluding tests known to create denial of service conditions and 
other disruptions can help reduce these negative impacts.
Testing does not provide a comprehensive evaluation of the security posture of an organization, and often 
has a narrow scope because of resource limitations—particularly in the area of time. Malicious attackers, on 
the other hand, can take whatever time they need to exploit and penetrate a system or network. Also, while 
organizations tend to avoid using testing techniques that impact systems or networks, attackers are not bound 
by this constraint and use whatever techniques they feel necessary. As a result, testing is less likely than 
examinations to identify weaknesses related to security policy and configuration. In many cases, combining 
testing and examination techniques can provide a more accurate view of security.7
Method: Test.
Assessment objects: Mechanisms (e.g., hardware, software, and firmware) and activities 
(e.g., system operations, administration, management; exercises).

﻿
Definition: The process of exercising one or more assessment objects under specified condi-
tions to compare actual with expected behavior, the results of which are used to support the de-
termination of security and privacy control existence, functionality, correctness, ­completeness, 
and potential for improvement over time. (Testing is typically used to determine if mecha-
nisms or activities meet a set of predefined specifications. It can also be performed to deter-
mine characteristics of a security or privacy control that are not commonly associated with 
predefined specifications, with an example of such testing being penetration testing.)
Supplemental guidance: Typical assessor actions may include, for example, testing access 
control, identification and authentication, and audit mechanisms; testing security configura-
tion settings; testing physical access control devices; conducting penetration testing of key 
information system components; testing information system backup operations; testing inci-
dent response capability; and exercising contingency planning capability.
SCAP-validated tools can be used to automate the collection of assessment objects and 
evaluate these objects against expected behavior. The use of SCAP is specifically relevant 
to the testing of mechanisms that involve assessment of actual machine state. The National 
Checklist Program catalogs a number of SCAP-enabled checklists that are suitable for assess-
ing the configuration posture of specific operating systems and applications. SCAP-validated 
tools can use these checklists to determine the aggregate compliance of a system against all 
of the configuration settings in the checklist (e.g., CM-6) or specific configurations that are 
relevant to a security or privacy control that pertains to one or more configuration settings. 
SCAP-validated tools can also determine the absence of a patch or the presence of a vulner-
able condition. The results produced by the SCAP tools can then be examined by assessors as 
part of the security and privacy control assessments.
Attributes: Depth and coverage:
• The depth attribute addresses the types of testing to be conducted. There are three 
possible values for the depth attribute:
•	 Basic testing:
-	 Basic testing: Test methodology (also known as black box testing) that assumes no 
knowledge of the internal structure and implementation detail of the assessment 
object. This type of testing is conducted using a functional specification for 
mechanisms and a high-level process description for activities. Basic testing 
provides a level of understanding of the security and privacy controls necessary for 
determining whether the controls are implemented and free of obvious errors.
•	 Focused testing:
-	 Focused testing: Test methodology (also known as gray box testing) that assumes 
some knowledge of the internal structure and implementation detail of the 
assessment object. This type of testing is conducted using a functional specification 
and limited system architectural information (e.g., high-level design) for 
mechanisms and a high-level process description and high-level description 
of integration into the operational environment for activities. Focused testing 
provides a level of understanding of the security and privacy controls necessary 
for determining whether the controls are implemented and free of obvious errors 
and whether there are increased grounds for confidence that the controls are 
implemented correctly and operating as intended.

•	 Comprehensive testing:
-	 Comprehensive testing: Test methodology (also known as white box testing) that 
assumes explicit and substantial knowledge of the internal structure and 
implementation detail of the assessment object. This type of testing is conducted 
using a functional specification, extensive system architectural information (e.g., 
high-level design, low-level design) and implementation representation (e.g., 
source code, schematics) for mechanisms, and a high-level process description and 
detailed description of integration into the operational environment for activities. 
Comprehensive testing provides a level of understanding of the security and 
privacy controls necessary for determining whether the controls are implemented 
and free of obvious errors and whether there are further increased grounds for 
confidence that the controls are implemented correctly and operating as intended 
on an ongoing and consistent basis, and that there is support for continuous 
improvement in the effectiveness of the controls.
• The coverage attribute addresses the scope or breadth of the testing process and includes 
the types of assessment objects to be tested, the number of objects to be tested (by type), 
and specific objects to be tested. (The organization, considering a variety of factors (e.g., 
available resources, importance of the assessment, the organization’s overall assessment 
goals and objectives), confers with assessors and provides direction on the type, 
number, and specific objects to be tested for the particular attribute value described. For 
mechanism-related testing, the coverage attribute also addresses the extent of the testing 
conducted (e.g., for software, the number of test cases and modules tested; for hardware, 
the range of inputs, number of components tested, and range of environmental factors 
over which the testing is conducted.)
	
There are three possible values for the coverage attribute:
•	 Basic:
-	 Basic testing: Testing that uses a representative sample of assessment objects (by type 
and number within type) to provide a level of coverage necessary for determining 
whether the security and privacy controls are implemented and free of obvious 
errors.
•	 Focused:
-	 Focused testing: Testing that uses a representative sample of assessment objects 
(by type and number within type) and other specific assessment objects deemed 
particularly important to achieving the assessment objective to provide a level of 
coverage necessary for determining whether the security and privacy controls are 
implemented and free of obvious errors and whether there are increased grounds

objects (by type and number within type) and other specific assessment objects

Automated
NIST SP 800-115 has a large discussion on automated testing techniques and tools available 
to run against systems to verify their compliance and programmatic actions against known 
baselines. These test mechanisms include vulnerability scanning, file and directory integrity 
checking, penetration testing, and others. We will discuss these tools and techniques in 
Chapter 10.
Manual
Manual testing is often used by assessors to provide a method of processing review and 
output business rule confirmation by applying known test data inputs and manually either 
walking through the process a step at a time or allowing the system to run with the manually 
developed test “scripts” and reading the results. Once the results are produced, a comparison 
is performed to ensure there are no anomalies between the expected results and the actual 
results. These manual processes have a long history within the auditing community wherein 
the auditors would apply test data to a system, run Computer-Aided Audit Tools (CAAT) or 
manually generated code snippets known as “scripts” against the system with the test data 
loaded, and compare the output with the expected results to verify processing, business rules, 
and coded logic patterns within the system under test.

Assessment Techniques  
for Each Kind of Control
Once we determine, which controls are to be assessed and our proposed methods and 
techniques for evaluation, we begin development of the security assessment plan (SAP) as 
per SP 800-37, rev. 1 defined requirements. In both SP 800-53A and SP 800-115, there are de-
fined areas for test considerations to be included in various sections of the SAP. The SAP is the 
current version of what had been previously known as the ST&E plan. The security test and 
evaluation (ST&E) plan was the primary document that the validator, the assessor, and the 
certifying agent used to guide the actual performance of the review throughout the course of 
the activity. The SAP defines methods and procedures for testing, evaluating, and assessing 
the various security controls in the system. Included in the SAP developmental process is an 
additional document, the rules of engagement (ROE) document, which is designed for over-
sight and approval for assessment and internal and external testing, including penetration 
testing and network scanning.
SECURITY ASSESSMENT PLAN DEVELOPMENTAL PROCESS
1.	 Develop security assessment policy: Organizations should develop an information security 
assessment policy to provide direction and guidance for their security assessments. This 
policy should identify security assessment requirements and hold accountable those 
individuals, who are responsible for ensuring that assessments comply with the require-
ments. The approved policy should be disseminated to the appropriate staff, as well as 
third parties, who are to conduct assessments for the organization. The policy should be 
reviewed at least annually and whenever there are new assessment-related requirements.
2.	 Prioritize and schedule assessment: Organizations should decide which systems 
should undergo assessments and how often these assessments should be done. 
This prioritization is based on system categorization, expected benefits, scheduling 
requirements, applicable regulations where assessment is a requirement, and resource 
availability. Technical considerations can also help determine assessment frequency, such 
as waiting until known weaknesses are corrected or a planned upgrade to the system is 
performed before conducting testing.

106	
9.  Assessment Techniques for Each Kind of Control 
﻿
3.	 Select and customize testing techniques: There are many factors for organizations to consider 
when determining, which techniques should be used for a particular assessment. Factors 
include the assessment objectives, the classes of techniques that can obtain information 
to support those objectives, and the appropriate techniques within each class. Some 
techniques also require the organization to determine the assessors’ viewpoint (e.g., 
internal versus external) so that the corresponding techniques can be selected.
4.	 Determine logistics of assessment: This includes identifying all required resources, including 
the assessment team; selecting environments and locations from where to perform the 
assessment; and acquiring and configuring all necessary technical tools.
5.	 Develop the assessment plan: The assessment plan documents the activities planned for 
an assessment and other related information. A plan should be developed for every 
assessment to provide the rules and boundaries to which assessors must adhere. The plan 
should identify the systems and networks to be assessed, the type and level of testing 
permitted, logistical details of the assessment, data handling requirements, and guidance 
for incident handling.
6.	 Address legal considerations: Organizations should evaluate potential legal concerns before 
commencing an assessment, particularly, if the assessment involves intrusive tests (e.g., 
penetration testing) or if the assessment is to be performed by an external entity. Legal 
departments may review the assessment plan, address privacy concerns, and perform 
other functions in support of assessment planning.
SECURITY ASSESSMENT ACTIONS
Now that we have defined the plan for the assessment, along with the objectives, test-
ing methods, and expected actions, let us discuss the actual and specific control assessment 
process and mechanisms. I have retrieved data from the federal standards (FIPS-200) and the 
testing guide from NIST (SP 800-53A) to compile this list as well as my own experience test-
ing and evaluating controls for each area and family of controls that is referenced as follows:
1.	 NIST SP 800-53, rev. 4 controls
	
There are 205 base controls in 18 families. The base XX1-1 control for each family is the 
policy control used to ensure that there is a core organizational policy for this family of 
security controls. So, AC-1 is the policy control for access control and IR-1 is the policy 
control for incident response and so on, through each of the 18 families of controls.
	
Additionally, most of the rest of the security controls in each family has enhancements of 
the control designated by the number of the enhancement inside a parenthesis. So AC-2 
control has XX enhancements designated as AC-2 (1) (2) and so on. “The security control 
enhancements section provides statements of security capability to:
(i)	
Add functionality/specificity to a control; and/or
(ii)	 Increase the strength of a control. In both cases, control enhancements are 
used in the information systems and environments of operation, which require 
greater protection than provided by the base control due to the potential adverse

Security assessment actions

﻿
organizational impacts, or when organizations seek additions to the base control 
functionality/specificity based on organizational assessments of risk.
Security control enhancements are numbered sequentially within each control so that the 
enhancements can be easily identified, when selected to supplement the base control. Each 
security control enhancement has a short subtitle to indicate the intended security capability 
provided by the control enhancement. The numerical designation of a control enhancement 
is used only to identify the particular enhancement within the control. The designation is not 
indicative of either the strength of the control enhancement or any hierarchical relationship 
among the enhancements. Control enhancements are not intended to be selected indepen-
dently (i.e., if a control enhancement is selected, then the corresponding base security control 
must also be selected).”2
Controls are defined in many ways throughout the various catalogs of security controls 
(SP 800-53, ISO 27002, DHS EBK, etc.), but mostly all the security controls are found to be 
within certain types, based upon their use and make-up. Typically, I find the following defini-
tions for the types of security controls used:
•	 Preventive: This control set is the primary control set needed for any system. The 
preventive control is designed to stop some negative event from happening, inhibit 
attempts to violate security policies, or provide the ability to stop potentially an adverse 
incident from occurring.
•	 Detective: This class of controls is designed to indicate that some adverse activity or 
condition is currently happening. These controls are intended to identify and characterize 
an incident in progress or an incident that is considered active.
•	 Corrective: The corrective control set is designed to limit the extent of any adverse event 
and usually, it is used and deployed in conjunction with detective controls. These 
controls are intended to limit the extent of any damage caused by an incident.
•	 Directive: This control set mandates the behavior of an entity by specifying what actions 
are, or are not, permitted. These controls are primarily security policies and regulatory 
guidance.
•	 Deterrent: Deterrent controls are intended to discourage individuals from intentionally 
violating information security policies or procedures. These controls are placed into effect 
to “keep the good people good.” These usually take the form of constraints that make it 
difficult or undesirable to perform unauthorized activities and mention the consequences 
of these activities in order to influence a potential intruder not to violate the security.
•	 Supplemental: The special use or specialized focus of various types of security controls 
as needed or required by some special event, incident, or activity from an internal or 
external source is the control set known as supplemental controls.

SECURITY CONTROLS BY FAMILY
The breakouts for testing of each individual control follow this area. I have included the 
NIST SP800-53A, rev. 4 guidance for each control in the testing sections.
A.	Access control (AC) family
	
FIPS-200 provides the following criteria for this family of controls: “Organizations must limit 
information system access to authorized users, processes acting on behalf of authorized 
users, or devices (including other information systems) and to the types of transactions 
and functions that authorized users are permitted to exercise.”
The primary assessment areas for these controls include:
a.	 Audit system components that enable the limitation of information system access to au-
thorized users
b.	Review security elements in a system so that they limit access to processes acting on 
behalf of authorized users
c.	 Assess controls on a system that facilitate the limitation of information system access to 
the devices (including other information systems)
d.	Inspect system controls that govern the types of transactions and functions that autho-
rized users are permitted to exercise

B.	Awareness and training (AT) family
	
FIPS-200 provides the following criteria for this family of controls: “Organizations must: (i) 
ensure that managers and users of organizational information systems are made aware 
of the security risks associated with their activities and of the applicable laws, Executive 
Orders, directives, policies, standards, instructions, regulations, or procedures related 
to the security of organizational information systems; and (ii) ensure that organizational 
personnel are adequately trained to carry out their assigned information security-related 
duties and responsibilities.”
The primary assessment areas for these controls include:
a.	 Review training elements so that managers and users of organizational information sys-
tems are made aware of the security risks associated with their activities.
b.	Assess training elements that promote managers and users awareness of the applicable 
laws, executive orders, directives, policies, standards, instructions, regulations, or 
procedures related to the security of organizational information systems.
c.	 Inspect training elements that validate organizational personnel are adequately trained to 
carry out their assigned information security-related duties and responsibilities.

Security controls by family	
159
﻿
C.	Audit and accountability (AU) family
	
FIPS-200 provides the following criteria for this family of controls: “Organizations must: 
(i) create, protect, and retain information system audit records to the extent needed to 
enable the monitoring, analysis, investigation, and reporting of unlawful, unauthorized, 
or inappropriate information system activity; and (ii) ensure that the actions of individual 
information system users can be uniquely traced to those users, so they can be held ac-
countable for their actions.”
The primary assessment areas for these controls include:
a.	 Review controls in a system that facilitate the creation, protection, and retention of infor-
mation system audit records to the extent needed to enable the monitoring, analysis, and 
investigation of the system.
b.	Inspect security elements in a system to enable the reporting of unlawful, unauthorized, 
or inappropriate information system activity.
c.	 Audit controls in a system to facilitate that the actions of individual information system 
users can be uniquely traced to those users, so that they can be held accountable for 
their actions.

D.	Assessment and authorization (CA) family
	
FIPS-200 provides the following criteria for this family of controls: “Organizations must: 
(i) ­periodically assess the security controls in organizational information systems to 
determine if the controls are effective in their application; (ii) develop and implement 
plans of action designed to correct deficiencies and reduce or eliminate vulnerabili-
ties in organizational information systems; (iii) authorize the operation of organiza-
tional ­information systems and any associated information system connections; and 
(iv) ­monitor information system security controls on an ongoing basis to ensure the 
continued effectiveness of the controls.”
The primary assessment areas for these controls include:
a.	 Review processes that facilitate the periodic assessment of the security controls in organi-
zational information systems to determine if the controls are effective in their application.
b.	Assess and implement plans of action designed to correct deficiencies and reduce or 
eliminate vulnerabilities in organizational information systems.
c.	 Inspect mechanisms that authorize the operation of organizational information systems 
and any associated information system connections.
d.	Evaluate processes that facilitate the monitoring of information system security controls 
on an ongoing basis to ensure the continued effectiveness of the controls.

9.  Assessment Techniques for Each Kind of Control 
﻿
G.	Identification and authentication family
	
FIPS-200 provides the following criteria for this family of controls: Identification and authen-
tication (IA): Organizations must identify information system users, processes acting 
on behalf of users, or devices and authenticate (or verify) the identities of those users, 
processes, or devices, as a prerequisite to allowing access to organizational information 
systems.
The primary assessment areas for these controls include:
a.	 Inspect identification mechanisms for users of information systems and authenticate (or 
verify) the identities of those users as a prerequisite to allowing access to organizational 
information systems.
b.	Review the identification of processes in information systems acting on behalf of users, 
and authenticate (or verify) the identities of those processes as a prerequisite to allowing 
access to organizational information systems.
c.	 Audit identification mechanisms for devices and authenticate (or verify) the identities of 
those devices as a prerequisite to allowing access to organizational information systems.

H.	Incident response family
	
FIPS-200 provides the following criteria for this family of controls: Incident response (IR): 
Organizations must: (i) establish an operational incident handling capability for orga-
nizational information systems that includes adequate preparation, detection, analysis, 
containment, recovery, and user response activities; and (ii) track, document, and report 
incidents to appropriate organizational officials and/or authorities.
The primary assessment areas for these controls include:
a.	 Inspect the establishment of an operational incident handling capability for organization-
al information systems that includes adequate preparation, detection, analysis, contain-
ment, recovery, and user response activities.
b.	Audit the tracking, documenting, and reporting of incidents to appropriate organization-
al officials and/or authorities.

Security controls by family	
325
﻿
N.	Personnel security family
	
FIPS-200 provides the following criteria for this family of controls: Personnel security (PS): 
­Organizations must: (i) ensure that individuals occupying positions of responsibility 
within organizations (including third-party service providers) are trustworthy and meet 
established security criteria for those positions; (ii) ensure that organizational information 
and information systems are protected during and after personnel actions such as termi-
nations and transfers; and (iii) employ formal sanctions for personnel failing to comply 
with organizational security policies and procedures.
The primary assessment areas for these controls include:
a.	 Audit controls that ensure individuals occupying positions of responsibility within 
­organizations (including third-party service providers) are trustworthy.
b.	Review security mechanisms that ensure that organizational information and information 
systems are protected during and after personnel actions, such as terminations and 
transfers.
c.	 Assess formal sanctions for personnel failing to comply with organizational security 
­policies and procedures.

Q.	Systems and communication protection family
	
FIPS-200 provides the following criteria for this family of controls: System and communications 
protection (SC): Organizations must: (i) monitor, control, and protect organizational com-
munications (i.e., information transmitted or received by organizational information sys-
tems) at the external boundaries and key internal boundaries of the information systems; 
and (ii) employ architectural designs, software development techniques, and systems 
engineering principles that promote effective information security within organizational 
information systems.
The primary assessment areas for these controls include:
a.	 Audit processes that monitor, control, and protect organizational communications 
(i.e., information transmitted or received by organizational information systems) at the 
­external boundaries and key internal boundaries of the information systems.
b.	Review techniques that employ architectural designs, software development techniques, 
and systems engineering principles that promote effective information security within 
organizational information systems.

R.	Systems integrity family
	
FIPS-200 provides the following criteria for this family of controls: System and information 
­integrity (SI): Organizations must: (i) identify, report, and correct information and in-
formation system flaws in a timely manner; (ii) provide protection from malicious code 
at appropriate locations within the organizational information systems; and (iii) moni-
tor ­information system security alerts and advisories and take appropriate actions in 
­response.
The primary assessment areas for these controls include:
a.	 Audit the identification, reporting, and correcting of system flaws, which should be done 
in a timely manner.
b.	Assess processes that provide protection from malicious code at appropriate locations 
within the organizational information systems.
c.	 Review mechanisms that monitor information system security alerts and advisories that

The primary assessment areas for these controls include:
h	Audit strategies for compliance with the organization’s information security 
program
h	Identify and stay current on all laws, regulations, standards, and best practices 
applicable to the organization
h	Establish relationships with all regulatory information security organizations and 
appropriate industry groups, forums, and stakeholders

by participating in collaborative settings
h	Review information security compliance performance measurement components
V.	ISO 27001/27002 specific controls
	
There are 114 controls in 14 groups
a.	 Information security policies – 2 controls
	
Management should define a set of policies to clarify their direction of, and support 
for, information security. At the top level, there should be an overall “information 
security policy.”
b.	Organization of information security – 7 controls

490	
9.  Assessment Techniques for Each Kind of Control 
﻿
	
The organization should define the roles and responsibilities for information 
security, and allocate them to assigned individuals. Where relevant, duties should 
be segregated across roles and individuals to avoid potential conflicts of interest and 
prevent inappropriate activities, such as fraud and collusion. There should be contacts 
with relevant external authorities on information security matters. Information 
security should be an integral part of the management of all types of project. There 
should be security policies and controls for mobile devices and teleworking.
c.	 Human resources security – 6 controls
	
Security responsibilities should be taken into account when recruiting permanent 
employees, contractors and temporary staff (e.g., through adequate job descriptions, 
pre-employment screening, and background checks) and included in contracts 
(e.g., terms and conditions of employment and other signed agreements (such as 
Nondisclosure agreements [NDAs]) on security roles and responsibilities). Managers 
should ensure that employees and contractors are made aware of and motivated to 
comply with their information security obligations. A formal disciplinary process is 
necessary to define and handle information security breaches. Security aspects of a 
person’s exit from the organization or significant changes of roles should be managed, 
such as returning corporate information and equipment in their possession, updating 
their access rights, and reminding them of their ongoing obligations under privacy 
laws, contractual terms, etc.
d.	Asset management – 10 controls
	
All information assets should be inventoried and owners should be identified to 
be held accountable for their security. “Acceptable use” policies should be defined, 
and assets should be returned when people leave the organization. Information 
should be classified and labeled by its owners according to the security protection 
needed, and handled appropriately. Information storage media should be managed, 
controlled, moved, and disposed of in such a way that the information content is not 
compromised.
e.	 Access control – 14 controls
	
The organization’s requirements to control access to information assets should be 
clearly documented in an access control policy and procedures. Network access and 
connections should be restricted. The allocation of access rights to users should be 
controlled from the initial user registration through the removal of access rights when 
it is no longer required. This includes special restrictions for privileged access rights 
and the management of passwords. Plus, regular reviews and updates of access 
rights. Users should be made aware of their responsibilities toward maintaining 
effective access controls, for example, choosing strong passwords and keeping them 
confidential. Information access should be restricted in accordance with the access 
control policy, for example, through secure log-on, password management, control 
over privileged utilities, and restricted access to program source code.
f.	 Cryptography – 2 controls
	
There should be a policy on the use of encryption, plus cryptographic authentication, 
and integrity controls such as digital signatures and message authentication codes, 
and cryptographic key management.
g.	Physical and environmental security – 15 controls

	
Security controls by family	
491
﻿
	
Defined physical perimeters and barriers, with physical entry controls and working 
procedures, should protect the premises, offices, rooms, delivery/loading areas etc. 
against unauthorized access. Specialist advice should be sought regarding protection 
against fires, floods, earthquakes, bombs, etc. “Equipment” (meaning ICT equipment, 
mostly) plus supporting utilities (such as power and air conditioning) and cabling 
should be secured and maintained. Equipment and information should not be taken 
off-site unless authorized, and must be adequately protected both on and off-site. 
Information must be destroyed prior to storage media being disposed of or reused. 
Unattended equipment must be secured and there should be a clear desk and clear 
screen policy.
h.	Operations security – 14 controls
	
IT operating responsibilities and procedures should be documented. Changes to IT 
facilities and systems should be controlled. Capacity and performance should be 
managed. Development, test, and operational systems should be separated. Malware 
controls are required, including user awareness. Appropriate backups should be taken 
and retained in accordance with a backup policy. System user and administrator/
operator activities, exceptions, faults, and information security events should be 
logged and protected. Clocks should be synchronized. Software installation on 
operational systems should be controlled. Technical vulnerabilities should be patched, 
and there should be rules in place governing software installation by users. IT audits 
should be planned and controlled to minimize adverse effects on production systems, 
or inappropriate data access.
i.	 Communications security – 7 controls
	
Networks and network services should be secured, for example, by segregation. There 
should be policies, procedures, and agreements (e.g., nondisclosure agreements) 
concerning information transfer to/from third parties, including electronic messaging.
j.	 System acquisition, development, and maintenance – 13 controls
	
Security control requirements should be analyzed and specified, including web 
applications and transactions. Rules governing secure software/systems development 
should be defined as policy. Changes to systems (both applications and operating 
systems) should be controlled. Software packages should ideally not be modified, 
and secure system engineering principles should be followed. The development 
environment should be secured, and outsourced development should be controlled. 
System security should be tested and acceptance criteria defined to include security 
aspects. Test data should be carefully selected/generated and controlled.
k.	Supplier relationships – 5 controls
	
There should be policies, procedures, awareness etc., to protect the organization’s 
information that is accessible to IT outsourcers and other external suppliers 
throughout the supply chain, agreed within the contracts or agreements. Service 
delivery by external suppliers should be monitored, and reviewed/audited against the 
contracts/agreements. Service changes should be controlled.
l.	 Information security incident management – 7 controls
	
There should be responsibilities and procedures to manage (report, assess, respond to, 
and learn from) information security events, incidents, and weaknesses consistently 
and effectively, and to collect forensic evidence.

﻿
m.	Business continuity management – 4 controls
	
The continuity of information security should be planned, implemented, and reviewed 
as an integral part of the organization’s business continuity management systems. IT 
facilities should have sufficient redundancy to satisfy availability requirements.
n.	Compliance – 8 controls
	
The organization must identify and document its obligations to external authorities 
and other third parties in relation to information security, including intellectual 
property, [business] records, privacy/personally identifiable information, and 
cryptography. The organization’s information security arrangements should be 
independently reviewed (audited) and reported to management. Managers should 
also routinely review employees’ and systems’ compliance with security policies, 
procedures etc. and initiate corrective actions where necessary.
The following spreadsheet lists each of the ISO controls along with the corresponding SP 
800-53 control(s) associated with the ISO control. This table, from Appendix H of SP 800-53, 
provides the correlating test criteria for each control. There are many ISO controls, which 
cover more than 1 SP 800-53 control, which means when you test these controls, you must re-
view all controls for full evaluation needs. Following the assessment criteria for the SP ­800-53 
controls will provide an almost complete evaluation criterion, but there are a few controls, 
which require additional areas for testing. The reference “A.” number (i.e., A.6.1.2) in front of 
the control refers to the ISO 27001 number.

System and Network Assessments
Security control assessments are not about checklists, simple pass-fail results, or generating paperwork to 
pass inspections or audits, rather, security controls assessments are the principal vehicle used to verify that 
the implementers and operators of information systems are meeting their stated security goals and objectives.1
The object of any testing event or activity is to evaluate the item being tested against some 
set of external criteria to verify and to validate the item under test meets the defined criteria. 
The needs for running today’s complex and disparate systems safely and securely are many 
and varied. The requirements for testing and evaluating these systems find uses in various 
areas including:
• Risk analysis: The evaluations for risk often require the identified risks be rated according 
to impact and potential harm they could cause to the organization. These evaluations 
will often include controls and their methodology of implementation which can be 
determined by analyzing the effectiveness of the installed controls through use of 
automated toolsets and scanners.
• Assessment: There are many ongoing needs and requirements throughout the federal 
government where the system which processes the information for the agency needs 
to be tested for its functionality and for its operations. These assessments will include 
testing after repairs have been completed to the system, testing when some major event 
or incident has occurred which calls into question the security of the system, evaluating 
the system subsequent to an external analysis which indicates some anomalous 
component, and examining the system when warranted by a reported condition or 
requested by a senior leadership.
• Authorization: Each system that is projected to be on or is already on a Federal Backbone 
or Network requires, under FISMA law, to be reviewed and analyzed for risks, evaluated 
and tested to ensure the security controls are working correctly, and then assessed 
to ensure the system is functioning at an acceptable level of risk to operate relatively 
securely. These authorization efforts are the basis for the Risk Management Framework 
criteria for federal Automated Information System (AIS) as defined in OMB Circular 
A-130 and are closely adhered to by federal agencies and authorizing officials. The 
independent testing needs for authorization on both Major Applications and General 
Support Systems, such as networks and data centers, provide many opportunities for 
1SP 800-53A, xiii.

10.  System and Network Assessments
﻿
testing efforts with various methods and techniques as required by the type of system 
being evaluated.
• Security architecture validation: Within each network are the various components, pieces 
of hardware, appliances, and software applications which comprise the network-based 
and system-based security controls. Each of these items is designed to provide some 
level of security for the system or network component it is protecting. However, there 
are often areas of interface and interconnections between or among components wherein 
protection is also needed and required. The designs and constructs for these areas are 
found in the security architecture documentation and drawings. Security architecture 
is an architectural subset under the enterprise architecture methodology which has 
developed over the past 15–20 years. Security architecture documents will include the 
reference models for the technical and business processes, the conceptual and actual 
drawings of the security processes for the network or system under review, and the 
various defined information types used within the system or network.
• Policy development support: One of the starting points for any assessment is to verify and 
validate to overarching corporate or organizational structures for security as they are 
implemented, the security policies. Each organization needs to have a policy document 
which covers the security, privacy, and liability needs of the organization with respect to 
the legal and privacy requirements of the people and the information the organization 
uses and retains. There are a multitude of privacy and legal requirements, regulations, 
and industry standards in today’s world which all provide guidance for use, retention, 
transmittal, and storage of these types of data and actions. Assessors need to review 
the policy documents for the organization to ensure compliance to these various 
statutory and regulatory needs. As part of the review, assessors should also review the 
policy development process to verify the organizational efforts to stay current with its 
regulatory environment and security needs.
• Develop a cohesive, well-thought-out operational security testing program: Each organization 
has many testing and evaluation process events they will be carrying out throughout 
the year and this program needs to be reviewed and validated. This validation is 
accomplished to ensure the program performance is providing the right level of 
information to the decision makers in the organization so they are making their risk-
based decision fully informed rather than with only partial data and incomplete testing 
results. Since these decisions are critical to the organization’s business objectives or 
missions, this process is very important to verify the completeness of the testing, the 
validity of the tests conducted, and the full scope of the evaluation procedures conducted 
by the organization.
	
	
The benefits of conducting the assessment and test program in a comprehensive and 
structured way include the following:
•	 Provides consistency and structure
•	 Minimizes testing risks
•	 Expedites transition of new staff
•	 Addresses resource constraints
•	 Reuses resources
•	 Decreases time required
•	 Reduces cost

﻿
	
System and Network Assessments	
501
Because information security assessment requires resources such as time, staff, hardware, and software, 
resource availability is often a limiting factor in the type and frequency of security assessments. Evaluating the 
types of security tests and examinations the organization will execute, developing an appropriate methodol-
ogy, identifying the resources required, and structuring the assessment process to support expected require-
ments can mitigate the resource challenge. This gives the organization the ability to reuse pre-established 
resources such as trained staff and standardized testing platforms; decreases time required to conduct the 
assessment and the need to purchase testing equipment and software; and reduces overall assessment costs.2
	
	
Each benefit has its own value and the accumulated gains for the organization add 
up to full and complete coverage of all areas to provide the assurance to the senior 
leadership of the organization that the results of the program do indeed provide the 
needed information to the decision makers on the risks and treatments of these identified 
risks to make the risk-based decisions about operating and running these systems safely 
and securely.
• Security testing program within federal agencies: Under FISMA requirements, each federal 
agency is required to evaluate their information systems for security on an annual and on 
a triannual basis to ensure their viability to keep the information secure and to operate at 
an acceptable level of risk.
	
	
The annual requirement covers the need to make sure the system is operating as 
intended and to check the current level of security for adequacy in light of the current 
threats and vulnerabilities of operating the system. This process has become standardized 
with OMB providing the listing of the families of security controls to be reviewed and 
tested each year to go with the high volatility controls and recently installed controls and 
control fixes the organization has implemented.
	
	
The triannual requirement is for the organization to completely reassess and retest 
all security components and controls for each system to verify and validate to full scope 
of control implementation with respect to the security requirements of confidentiality, 
integrity, and availability for the system.
• Testing purposes: The actual testing provides multiple important and positive results when 
conducted in conjunction with the other parts of the security program and activities. The 
results often document the purposes behind the testing and include the following areas:
•	 Exploitable flaws: Weaknesses and flaws within the system are often found by testing of 
the system and its security controls. This process is critical to the organization since it 
is the main way these flaws can be determined, remediated, and repaired to keep the 
system secure and people utilizing the system on track and safe as they conduct the 
business supported by this system.
•	 Understanding, calibrating, and documenting the operational security posture: Testing and 
evaluation provide a means to identify, adjust, and fully document the system, its 
operating environment, the interfaces to and from the system, and its operating status 
at the point in time of the test event. As a result of the assessment, the system and its 
documentation is verified, corrected, and provided to the test results receiver.
•	 Improving the security posture: The major component for testing is to produce an 
improved and viable security posture for the system under test. This security result 
is found in the recommendations of the assessor as documented in the Security 
2SP 800-115, p. 2-1.

﻿
Assessment Report (SAR) defined later in this book. The improvement of the security is 
the goal of any testing event and the testing provides identified areas for improvement.
• Routine and integral part of the system and network operations: In today’s world with 
constantly changing operating environments, threat sources consistently changing their 
methods and techniques of attack, and the consistently changing vulnerability flaws and 
weaknesses in applications and operating systems, ongoing assessments are necessary to 
assist the system owners and executives to provide information on the current risks and 
security of their systems. The following areas and focus points are critical to using the 
assessment methods mentioned herein for operational utilization:
•	 Most important systems first: The methods for your business to make money (if it is a for-
profit corporation) or for your organization to deliver its service (if it is a not-for-profit 
organization) are vital to the completion of the business objectives and/or mission of 
your company or organization. Since that area is true, the most critical systems within 
that business objective need to be available and active at all the times your organization 
is conducting its business. The assessment of these critical systems and their risks and 
security therefore is vital to the organization and its normal operations.
-	 Since all systems within the organization are always considered vital to an 
organization and its business processes, evaluating the most critical systems 
first provides a baseline to set the core security and privacy assurance for the 
organization.
-	 Always test and evaluate the critical, most important systems first to ensure the 
business continuity/COOP efforts are focused correctly, and then move on to the 
essential systems. The organization’s business impact analysis Bureau of Indian 
Affairs (BIA) is a good place to start since that is where the organization itself has 
identified those systems most vital to the mission and/or business processes of the 
unit, component, or agency.
•	 Use caution when testing: During the course of conducting testing on controls and 
networks, there are instances where the automated tools used can cause interrupts in 
processing or operations of the system being review. Be careful and understand the 
tool and its capabilities so as not to cause an unintended denial of service (DOS) or 
other interrupt of activities on the system.
•	 Security policy accurately reflects the organization’s needs: Reviewing the organizational 
policies and standards is one of the first and most important steps in conducting any 
assessment. I have often heard that “security controls are implemented to support 
security policies” and this is very true. Each policy, as defined by the management 
and security portions of the agency, provides the basis and foundation for every 
control implemented in the system. Therefore, these policies set the core requirements 
for security and assurance which each user and customer of the system expects to 
be met by the system in its use and implementation. The basic policy sets the needs, 
requirements, and guidance to the user for use on the system.
-	 Maximize use of common controls: The agency’s use of common controls provides 
the assessor the basic viewpoint of security within the organization. If there are 
many Common Control Providers which follow the basic requirements for data 
centers, physical and environmental security, personnel, facilities maintenance 
and management, incident response, and other common areas, then the senior 

﻿
	
System and Network Assessments	
503
management of the organization is approaching security in a holistic and 
standardized manner which provides common ground for each department to base 
their risk and security approaches on for continued assurance and trustworthiness.
-	 Share assessment results: The continued sharing of assessment results within an 
organization provides the senior leadership with an updated and current view 
of the risks the organization is currently facing during the accomplishment of its 
mission or business processes. This is important to maintain the organizational risk 
tolerance in light of the changing threats to the world and constant vulnerabilities 
being identified for each type of system and operating system.
-	 Develop organization-wide procedures: When an organization provides the various 
departments the common security procedures for standardized activities, it is 
creating a “mind-set” for the use and implementation of security which gives the 
result of utilizing the industry “best practices” for practices and implementation 
guidance. These procedures provide the individual security professional and the 
agencies with the methods and means for conducting the security operations of the 
unit in accordance with both the agency requirements and the external compliance 
requirements all agencies must meet in today’s world.
-	 Provide organization-wide tools, templates, and techniques: By developing and 
implementing standard tools, templates, and security techniques, the organization 
is providing the best practice approach to security and assurance. With templates 
for forms, plans, and reports, the unit personnel can identify the critical information 
components and metrics needed to keep focus on during the course of their daily 
security activities. By defining standard tools for use, the unit is giving the means 
for continued identification and classification of the data elements needed to 
provide the senior leadership with the continuous monitoring points for ongoing 
risk evaluations and decision making.
•	 Security testing integrated into the risk management process: The FISMA-mandated and 
NIST-designed Risk Management Framework approach to security assurance and 
evaluations for USG systems demands that security component and system testing be 
conducted ongoing throughout the system life cycle of the system under evaluation. 
Testing and evaluation under the Risk Management Framework is defined as the 
critical independent need for the authorizing official to use as his/her risk-based 
decision-making input to ensure the operation and maintenance of the system under 
evaluation is actually safe and secure to operate in the normal course of activities.
•	 Ensure system administrators and network managers are trained and capable: One of the 
most important areas of continued security of each system is to make sure the elevated 
privilege account holders for the system are properly trained in their performance 
of their daily activities. Insider threat in today’s world is still the highest impact area 
of potential issues and security concerns and by providing proper training to these 
elevated privilege users, the organization is reducing the likelihood of misuse and 
abuse possibilities.
•	 Keep systems up-to-date with patches: Systems today have many areas of potential flaws 
and weaknesses in the operating systems and applications that they deploy and use. 
The software industry has developed a methodology over the past 40 years wherein 
the end user is the tester of the software, rather than develop their (the vendor) own

﻿
testing program. All major software vendors utilize this construct and we need to 
constantly be vigilant with the software to keep it up-to-date in its patching.
•	 Capabilities and limitations of vulnerability testing: Vulnerability testing on systems 
and networks is a common best practice for organizations to ensure their systems 
are not vulnerable to some exposure or exploit in the software and systems they 
employ. However, remember the vulnerability scanning tools that are currently being 
used throughout the industry do not review external mitigation efforts for system 
weaknesses. For example, a security flaw commonly identified in a system would be 
a self-signed SSL certificate on a system not externally provided to the organization. 
However, if the organization utilizes external SSL certificates and the encryption 
processes are controlled at the entrance to the network, this flaw is not actually visible 
or exploitable from outside the network. Therefore, this weakness is minor in nature 
since it is handled externally to the identified server.
800-115 INTRODUCTION
NIST produced SP 800-115 in September 2008 to give guidance to federal agencies in the 
conduct of testing events for their systems and networks. The intent of this document is as 
follows:
The purpose of this document is to provide guidelines for organizations on planning and conducting tech-
nical information security testing and assessments, analyzing findings, and developing mitigation strategies. 
It provides practical recommendations for designing, implementing, and maintaining technical information 
relating to security testing and assessment processes and procedures, which can be used for several pur-
poses—such as finding vulnerabilities in a system or network and verifying compliance with a policy or other 
requirements. This guide is not intended to present a comprehensive information security testing or assess-
ment program, but rather an overview of the key elements of technical security testing and assessment with 
emphasis on specific techniques, their benefits and limitations, and recommendations for their use.3
The big picture, the main purpose for assessing, evaluating, and testing systems, is clearly 
defined as follows:
This document is a guide to the basic technical aspects of conducting information security assessments. It 
presents technical testing and examination methods and techniques that an organization might use as part of 
an assessment, and offers insights to assessors on their execution and the potential impact they may have on 
systems and networks. For an assessment to be successful and have a positive impact on the security posture 
of a system (and ultimately the entire organization), elements beyond the execution of testing and examina-
tion must support the technical process. Suggestions for these activities—including a robust planning process, 
root cause analysis, and tailored reporting—are also presented in this guide.
The processes and technical guidance presented in this document enable organizations to:
• Develop information security assessment policy, methodology, and individual roles and responsibilities 
related to the technical aspects of assessment
• Accurately plan for a technical information security assessment by providing guidance on determining 
which systems to assess and the approach for assessment, addressing logistical considerations, developing 
an assessment plan, and ensuring legal and policy considerations are addressed

800-115 introduction	
505
﻿
• Safely and effectively execute a technical information security assessment using the presented methods and 
techniques, and respond to any incidents that may occur during the assessment
• Appropriately handle technical data (collection, storage, transmission, and destruction) throughout the 
assessment process
• Conduct analysis and reporting to translate technical findings into risk mitigation actions that will improve 
the organization’s security posture.
The information presented in this publication is intended to be used for a variety of assessment purposes. For 
example, some assessments focus on verifying that a particular security control (or controls) meets requirements, 
while others are intended to identify, validate, and assess a system’s exploitable security weaknesses. Assess-
ments are also performed to increase an organization’s ability to maintain a proactive computer network defense. 
Assessments are not meant to take the place of implementing security controls and maintaining system security.4
Now, there are many reasons to conduct technical testing and evaluation activities within 
an organization or agency. Within the scope of technical testing the criteria for assessments 
include:
• Internet change: The incredible changes which have occurred across the ubiquitous 
internet in the past several years have created a vast array of new capabilities, 
technologies, attack methods, and means for exploitation which were never even thought 
of by the original designers. The full scope of the protocols, services, and activities 
available today on the internet is mind staggering. You can virtually accomplish any task 
or perform any endeavor entirely on the internet rapidly and completely.
• Intruder attacks: Today the methods and techniques of attack against anyone using the 
internet are extremely varied and complex. Often many organizations and individuals 
have no knowledge that they and their data have been compromised and exfiltrated 
from their systems. The incredible proliferation of malware across the internet has 
produced a virtual “Wild West” of attackers, “botnets,” cybercrime organizations, and 
“monetization” of many data types which have never been subjected to these uses in the 
past. “Hacker” tools and tactics have dramatically increased in their use and the standard 
internet user is the constant victim of these efforts to gain the money and the resultant 
return from these attacks.
• Powerful systems today: The advances in technology for both hardware and software in 
the modern PC and laptop machines have provided a dramatic expansion of options, 
available resources, and advances in the abilities and capabilities of these machines. 
Additionally, with these technological advances, the network computing components 
(routers, switches, virtualization, cloud, etc.) have added to the capabilities of 
organizations and agencies to provide services never thought of before. Many of these 
systems are well advanced of the computing machine just 6 or 8 years ago and give many 
new methods and techniques available to today’s attack-minded hacker.
• Complex system administration: With the technological advances mentioned above, the 
administration of these machines and systems has dramatically advanced as well. 
Multiple servers with many inputs and outputs to systems both inside a network and 
outside the organizational boundaries are almost required to have log-ins from multiple 
users literally all over the world. The control and review of these very active systems has 
become a full-time job for many system administrators of these systems.

﻿
Reasons for conducting technical and nontechnical testing on today’s systems are as ­follows:
• Highly cost-effective in preventing incidents and uncovering unknown vulnerabilities: Testing 
can provide a detailed review of the systems and their vulnerability to both inside and 
outside attack techniques. This process leads to preventive measures being taken by the 
organization which both is cost-effective in result and often uncovers previously unknown 
(to the organization) issues and potential vulnerabilities in the systems under test.
• Testing – most conclusive determinant: Testing provides security artifacts and results 
documentation which can support evaluation efforts, audit findings, and control 
recommendations with definitive objective documentation in the various security areas 
of confidentiality, integrity, availability, authentication, and reliability. The objective, 
scientific basis for the results provides the independent-type reporting necessary for the 
organizational decision makers to use to make their risk-based decisions on the viability 
and risk management practices for the system and the agency.
• Methods for achieving the mission/business goals: Testing and evaluations support the 
operations of systems in the areas of verifying configuration changes, providing realistic 
results in an operational environment, and ensuring the security and safety of the system 
is being maintained continuously as it is providing the operating results expected and 
desired by the organization. By performing ongoing testing, the organization is deriving 
continuous compliance with external requirements and standards.
ASSESSMENT TECHNIQUES
SP 800-115 defines three basic techniques for technical assessments. They are as follows:
• Review Techniques. These are examination techniques used to evaluate systems, applications, networks, 
policies, and procedures to discover vulnerabilities, and are generally conducted manually. They include 
documentation, log, rule-set, and system configuration review; network sniffing; and file integrity checking.
• Target Identification and Analysis Techniques. These testing techniques can identify systems, ports, ser-
vices, and potential vulnerabilities, and may be performed manually but are generally performed using 
automated tools. They include network discovery, network port and service identification, vulnerability 
scanning, wireless scanning, and application security examination.
• Target Vulnerability Validation Techniques. These testing techniques corroborate the existence of vulner-
abilities, and may be performed manually or by using automatic tools, depending on the specific technique 
used and the skill of the test team. Target vulnerability validation techniques include password cracking, 
penetration testing, social engineering, and application security testing.5
SP 800-115 goes on and adds the nontechnical means for assessments as follows:
Additionally, there are many non-technical techniques that may be used in addition to or instead of the 
technical techniques.
One example is physical security testing, which confirms the existence of physical security vulnerabilities 
by attempting to circumvent locks, badge readers, and other physical security controls, typically to gain 
unauthorized access to specific hosts.
Another example of a non-technical technique is manual asset identification. An organization may choose 
to identify assets to be assessed through asset inventories, physical walkthroughs of facilities, and other 
non-technical means, instead of relying on technical techniques for asset identification.6

﻿
SP 800-115 goes on to explain:
Examinations primarily involve the review of documents such as policies, procedures, security plans, 
­security requirements, standard operating procedures, architecture diagrams, engineering documentation, 
­asset ­inventories, system configurations, rule-sets, and system logs. They are conducted to determine whether 
a system is properly documented, and to gain insight on aspects of security that are only available through 
documentation. This documentation identifies the intended design, installation, configuration, operation, and 
maintenance of the systems and network, and its review and cross-referencing ensures conformance and con-
sistency. For example, an environment’s security requirements should drive documentation such as system 
security plans and standard operating procedures—so assessors should ensure that all plans, procedures, 
architectures, and configurations are compliant with stated security requirements and applicable policies. 
Another example is reviewing a firewall’s rule-set to ensure its compliance with the organization’s security 
policies regarding Internet usage, such as the use of instant messaging, peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing, and 
other prohibited activities.
Examinations typically have no impact on the actual systems or networks in the target environment aside 
from accessing necessary documentation, logs, or rule-sets. (One passive testing technique that can potentially 
impact networks is network sniffing, which involves connecting a sniffer to a hub, tap, or span port on the 
network. In some cases, the connection process requires reconfiguring a network device, which could disrupt 
operations.) However, if system configuration files or logs are to be retrieved from a given system such as a 
router or firewall, only system administrators an modified or deleted.
Testing involves hands-on work with systems and networks to identify security vulnerabilities, and can be 
executed across an entire enterprise or on selected systems. The use of scanning and penetration techniques 
can provide valuable information on potential vulnerabilities and predict the likelihood that an adversary 
or intruder will be able to exploit them. Testing also allows organizations to measure levels of compliance in 
areas such as patch management, password policy, and configuration management.
Although testing can provide a more accurate picture of an organization’s security posture than what is 
gained through examinations, it is more intrusive and can impact systems or networks in the target envi-
ronment. The level of potential impact depends on the specific types of testing techniques used, which can 
interact with the target systems and networks in various ways—such as sending normal network packets to 
determine open and closed ports, or sending specially crafted packets to test for vulnerabilities. Any time that 
a test or tester directly interacts with a system or network, the potential exists for unexpected system halts 
and other denial of service conditions. Organizations should determine their acceptable levels of intrusive-
ness when deciding which techniques to use. Excluding tests known to create denial of service conditions and 
other disruptions can help reduce these negative impacts.
Testing does not provide a comprehensive evaluation of the security posture of an organization, and often 
has a narrow scope because of resource limitations—particularly in the area of time. Malicious attackers, on 
the other hand, can take whatever time they need to exploit and penetrate a system or network. Also, while 
organizations tend to avoid using testing techniques that impact systems or networks, attackers are not bound 
by this constraint and use whatever techniques they feel necessary. As a result, testing is less likely than 
examinations to identify weaknesses related to security policy and configuration. In many cases, combining 
testing and examination techniques can provide a more accurate view of security.7
NETWORK TESTING PURPOSE AND SCOPE
Networking evaluations and testing areas of focus include the following components, 
equipment, and devices:
• Firewalls
• Routers and switches
• Network-perimeter security systems (Intrusion Detection System (IDS))
• Application servers
7SP 800-115, p. 2-3, 2-4.

508	
10.  System and Network Assessments
﻿
• Other servers such as for Domain Name System (DNS) or directory servers or file servers 
(Common Internet File System (CIFS)/Server Message Block (SMB), Network File System 
(NFS), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), etc.)
These various components are often standardized by the organization with common 
configurations, formal change management request actions, and continued monitoring and 
maintenance, all similar to computing equipment residing on the network such as file and 
application servers and workstations and laptops. Within this normal network view, there 
are common access controls utilized through the Access Control List (ACL) implementation.
ACL Reviews
A rule-set is a collection of rules or signatures that network traffic or system activity is compared against 
to determine what action to take—for example, forwarding or rejecting a packet, creating an alert, or allowing 
a system event. Review of these rule-sets is done to ensure comprehensiveness and identify gaps and weak-
nesses on security devices and throughout layered defenses such as network vulnerabilities, policy violations, 
and unintended or vulnerable communication paths. A review can also uncover inefficiencies that negatively 
impact a rule-set’s performance.
Rule-sets to review include network- and host-based firewall and IDS/IPS rule-sets, and router access control 
lists. The following list provides examples of the types of checks most commonly performed in rule-set reviews:
1.	 For router access control lists
–	 Each rule is still required (for example, rules that were added for temporary purposes are removed as 
soon as they are no longer needed)
–	 Only traffic that is authorized per policy is permitted, and all other traffic is denied by default
2.	 For firewall rule-sets
–	 Each rule is still required
–	 Rules enforce least privilege access, such as specifying only required Internet Protocol (IP) addresses 
and ports
–	 More specific rules are triggered before general rules
–	 There are no unnecessary open ports that could be closed to tighten the perimeter security
–	 The rule-set does not allow traffic to bypass other security defenses
–	 For host-based firewall rule-sets, the rules do not indicate the presence of backdoors, spyware activity, 
or prohibited applications such as peer-to-peer file sharing programs
3.	 For IDS/IPS rule-sets
–	 Unnecessary signatures have been disabled or removed to eliminate false positives and improve 
­performance
–	 Necessary signatures are enabled and have been fine-tuned and properly maintained.8
System-Defined Reviews
There are many types of configurations for each type of computer and system. With these 
varied types there comes a strong need to have each system, machine, or device under stan-
dard configuration control and management. This process places the system under test in a 
relatively controlled environment with its configuration files, software leads, and other areas. 
The machines and devices which should be under this type of control include:
• Computer system (mainframe, minicomputer)
• Network system (LAN)
8SP 800-115, p. 3-2, 3-3.

	
Security testing techniques

﻿
• Network domain
• Host (computer system)
• Network nodes, routers, switches, and firewalls
• Network and/or computer application on each computer system
System configuration review is the process of identifying weaknesses in security configuration controls, 
such as systems not being hardened or configured according to security policies. For example, this type of 
review will reveal unnecessary services and applications, improper user account and password settings, and 
improper logging and backup settings. Examples of security configuration files that may be reviewed are 
Windows security policy settings and Unix security configuration files such as those in /etc.
Assessors using manual review techniques rely on security configuration guides or checklists to verify that 
system settings are configured to minimize security risks. To perform a manual system configuration review, 
assessors access various security settings on the device being evaluated and compare them with recommended 
settings from the checklist. Settings that do not meet minimum security standards are flagged and reported.
Automated tools are often executed directly on the device being assessed, but can also be executed on 
a system with network access to the device being assessed. While automated system configuration reviews 
are faster than manual methods, there may still be settings that must be checked manually. Both manual and 
automated methods require root or administrator privileges to view selected security settings.
Generally it is preferable to use automated checks instead of manual checks whenever feasible. Automated 
checks can be done very quickly and provide consistent, repeatable results. Having a person manually check-
ing hundreds or thousands of settings is tedious and error-prone.9

examines headers and payloads to flag information of interest. Besides being used as a review technique,

﻿
network sniffing can also be used as a target identification and analysis technique. Reasons for using network 
sniffing include the following:
• Capturing and replaying network traffic
• Performing passive network discovery (e.g., identifying active devices on the network)
• Identifying operating systems, applications, services, and protocols, including unsecured (e.g., telnet) and 
unauthorized (e.g., peer-to-peer file sharing) protocols
• Identifying unauthorized and inappropriate activities, such as the unencrypted transmission of sensitive 
information
• Collecting information, such as unencrypted usernames and passwords.
Network sniffing has little impact on systems and networks, with the most noticeable impact being on band-
width or computing power utilization. The sniffer—the tool used to conduct network sniffing—requires a means 
to connect to the network, such as a hub, tap, or switch with port spanning. Port spanning is the process of copy-
ing the traffic transmitted on all other ports to the port where the sniffer is installed. Organizations can deploy 
network sniffers in a number of locations within an environment. These commonly include the following:
• At the perimeter, to assess traffic entering and exiting the network
• Behind firewalls, to assess that rule-sets are accurately filtering traffic
• Behind IDSs/IPSs, to determine if signatures are triggering and being responded to appropriately
• In front of a critical system or application to assess activity
• On a specific network segment, to validate encrypted protocols.
One limitation to network sniffing is the use of encryption. Many attackers take advantage of encryption 
to hide their activities—while assessors can see that communication is taking place, they are unable to view 
the contents. Another limitation is that a network sniffer is only able to sniff the traffic of the local segment 
where it is installed. This requires the assessor to move it from segment to segment, install multiple sniffers 
throughout the network, and/or use port spanning. Assessors may also find it challenging to locate an open 
physical network port for scanning on each segment. In addition, network sniffing is a fairly labor-intensive 
activity that requires a high degree of human involvement to interpret network traffic.10
b.	Port scanning:
Network discovery uses a number of methods to discover active and responding hosts on a network, 
identify weaknesses, and learn how the network operates. Both passive (examination) and active (testing) 
techniques exist for discovering devices on a network. Passive techniques use a network sniffer to moni-
tor network traffic and record the IP addresses of the active hosts, and can report which ports are in use 
and which operating systems have been discovered on the network. Passive discovery can also identify the 
relationships between hosts—including which hosts communicate with each other, how frequently their com-
munication occurs, and the type of traffic that is taking place—and is usually performed from a host on the 
internal network where it can monitor host communications. This is done without sending out a single prob-
ing packet. Passive discovery takes more time to gather information than does active discovery, and hosts that 
do not send or receive traffic during the monitoring period might not be reported.
Network port and service identification involves using a port scanner to identify network ports and ser-
vices operating on active hosts—such as FTP and HTTP—and the application that is running each identified 
service, such as Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) or Apache for the HTTP service. Organizations 
should conduct network port and service identification to identify hosts if this has not already been done by 
other means (e.g., network discovery), and flag potentially vulnerable services. This information can be used 
to determine targets for penetration testing.
All basic scanners can identify active hosts and open ports, but some scanners are also able to provide addi-
tional information on the scanned hosts. Information gathered during an open port scan can assist in identifying 
the target operating system through a process called OS fingerprinting. For example, if a host has TCP ports 135, 
10SP 800-115, p. 3-4.

	
Security testing techniques

﻿
139, and 445 open, it is probably a Windows host, or possibly a UNIX host running Samba. Other items—such 
as the TCP packet sequence number generation and responses to packets—also provide a clue to identifying the 
OS. But OS fingerprinting is not foolproof. For example, firewalls block certain ports and types of traffic, and 
system administrators can configure their systems to respond in nonstandard ways to camouflage the true OS.
c.	 Network services discovery:
Active discovery techniques send various types of network packets, such as Internet Control Message 
­Protocol (ICMP) pings, to solicit responses from network hosts, generally through the use of an automated 
tool. One activity, known as OS fingerprinting, enables the assessor to determine the system’s OS by sending it 
a mix of normal, abnormal, and illegal network traffic. Another activity involves sending packets to common 
port numbers to generate responses that indicate the ports are active. The tool analyzes the responses from 
these activities, and compares them with known traits of packets from specific operating systems and network 
services—enabling it to identify hosts, the operating systems they run, their ports, and the state of those ports. 
This information can be used for purposes that include gathering information on targets for penetration test-
ing, generating topology maps, determining firewall and IDS configurations, and discovering vulnerabilities 
in systems and network configurations.
Network discovery tools have many ways to acquire information through scanning. Enterprise firewalls 
and intrusion detection systems can identify many instances of scans, particularly those that use the most 
suspicious packets (e.g., SYN/FIN scan, NULL scan). Assessors who plan on performing discovery through 
firewalls and intrusion detection systems should consider which types of scans are most likely to provide 
results without drawing the attention of security administrators, and how scans can be conducted in a more 
stealthy manner (such as more slowly or from a variety of source IP addresses) to improve their chances of 
success. Assessors should also be cautious when selecting types of scans to use against older systems, particu-
larly those known to have weak security, because some scans can cause system failures. Typically, the closer 
the scan is to normal activity, the less likely it is to cause operational problems.
Network discovery may also detect unauthorized or rogue devices operating on a network. For example, 
an organization that uses only a few operating systems could quickly identify rogue devices that utilize dif-
ferent ones. Once a wired rogue device is identified, 12 it can be located by using existing network maps and 
information already collected on the device’s network activity to identify the switch to which it is connected. 
It may be necessary to generate additional network activity with the rogue device—such as pings—to find the 
correct switch. The next step is to identify the switch port on the switch associated with the rogue device, and 
to physically trace the cable connecting that switch port to the rogue device.
A number of tools exist for use in network discovery, and it should be noted that many active discovery 
tools can be used for passive network sniffing and port scanning as well. Most offer a graphical user interface 
(GUI), and some also offer a command-line interface. Command-line interfaces may take longer to learn than 
GUIs because of the number of commands and switches that specify what tests the tool should perform and 
which an assessor must learn to use the tool effectively. Also, developers have written a number of modules 
for open source tools that allow assessors to easily parse tool output. For example, combining a tool’s Exten-
sible Markup Language (XML) output capabilities, a little scripting, and a database creates a more powerful 
tool that can monitor the network for unauthorized services and machines. Learning what the many com-
mands do and how to combine them is best achieved with the help of an experienced security engineer. Most 
experienced IT professionals, including system administrators and other network engineers, should be able to 
interpret results, but working with the discovery tools themselves is more efficiently handled by an engineer.
Some of the advantages of active discovery, as compared to passive discovery, are that an assessment 
can be conducted from a different network and usually requires little time to gather information. In passive 
discovery, ensuring that all hosts are captured requires traffic to hit all points, which can be time-consuming—
especially in larger enterprise networks.
A disadvantage to active discovery is that it tends to generate network noise, which sometimes results 
in network latency. Since active discovery sends out queries to receive responses, this additional network 
activity could slow down traffic or cause packets to be dropped in poorly configured networks if performed 
at high volume. Active discovery can also trigger IDS alerts, since unlike passive discovery it reveals its origi-
nation point. The ability to successfully discover all network systems can be affected by environments with 
protected network segments and perimeter security devices and techniques. For example, an environment 
using network address translation (NAT)—which allows organizations to have internal, non-publicly routed 

512	
10.  System and Network Assessments
﻿
IP addresses that are translated to a different set of public IP addresses for external traffic—may not be accu-
rately discovered from points external to the network or from protected segments. Personal and host-based 
firewalls on target devices may also block discovery traffic. Misinformation may be received as a result of 
trying to instigate activity from devices. Active discovery presents information from which conclusions must 
be drawn about settings on the target network.
For both passive and active discovery, the information received is seldom completely accurate. To illus-
trate, only hosts that are on and connected during active discovery will be identified—if systems or a segment 
of the network are offline during the assessment, there is potential for a large gap in discovering devices. 
­Although passive discovery will only find devices that transmit or receive communications during the discov-
ery period, products such as network management software can provide continuous discovery capabilities 
and automatically generate alerts when a new device is present on the network. Continuous discovery can 
scan IP address ranges for new addresses or monitor new IP address requests. Also, many discovery tools can 
be scheduled to run regularly, such as once every set amount of days at a particular time. This provides more 
accurate results than running these tools sporadically.
	
Some of the tools for conducting these discovery activities include Network Mapper 
(NMAP) and GFI LanGuard products. Protocols which are observed during scanning 
and sniffing activities would include:
-	 Internet Protocol (IP)
-	 Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
-	 User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
-	 Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
d.	Fingerprinting: The process of identifying the type of operating system, its current 
patch level and revision, along with the various additional management data about 
the system under review is known in this context as “fingerprinting the server.”
	
	
Knowing the version and type of a running web server allows testers to determine 
known vulnerabilities and the appropriate exploits to use during testing. There are 
several different vendors and versions of servers on the market today. Knowing 
the type of server that you are testing significantly helps in the testing process, and 
will also change the course of the test. This information can be derived by sending 
the server specific commands and analyzing the output, as each version of server 
software may respond differently to these commands. By fingerprinting the target’s 
server and enumerating as much information as possible, an attacker may develop an 
accurate attack scenario, which will effectively exploit an identified vulnerability in the 
software type/version being utilized by the target host. This is one of the initial steps 
involved in penetration testing and the outside attack tactics and techniques hackers 
use in attempting to gain unauthorized access to systems and servers.
	
	
As the OWASP Testing Guide defines: “By knowing how each type of web server 
responds to specific commands and keeping this information in a web server 
fingerprint database, a penetration tester can send these commands to the web server, 
analyze the response, and compare it to the database of known signatures. Please note 
that it usually takes several different commands to accurately identify the web server, 
as different versions may react similarly to the same command. Rarely, however, 
different versions react the same to all HTTP commands. So, by sending several 
different commands, you increase the accuracy of your guess” [1].

“Some scanners can help identify the application running on a particular port through a 
process called service identification. Many scanners use a services file that lists common 
port numbers and typical associated services—for example, a scanner that identifies that

﻿
TCP port 80 is open on a host may report that a web server is listening at that port—but 
additional steps are needed before this can be confirmed. Some scanners can initiate 
communications with an observed port and analyze its communications to determine 
what service is there, often by comparing the observed activity to a repository of 
information on common services and service implementations. These techniques may 
also be used to identify the service application and application version, such as which 
Web server software is in use—this process is known as version scanning. A well-known 
form of version scanning, called banner grabbing, involves capturing banner information 
transmitted by the remote port when a connection is initiated. This information can 
include the application type, application version, and even OS type and version. 
Version scanning is not foolproof, because a security-conscious administrator can alter 
the transmitted banners or other characteristics in hopes of concealing the service’s 
true nature. However, version scanning is far more accurate than simply relying on a 
scanner’s services file.”11 An example of an NMAP output is shown as follows:

Common reasons that scanning of networks and machines is conducted include:
-	 Check for unauthorized hosts: Identifying machines, rogue devices, and hosts is commonly 
a result of scanning. This process helps create a network topology of the active devices 
and servers on the network, whether they were previously identified or not.
-	 Identify vulnerable services: Each device which is scanned provides output data of all the 
services, ports, and protocols that device is currently running at the time of the scan. 
These outputs identify the open areas of access to the device which could be exposed 
to outside attack or exploitation.
-	 Identify deviations from the allowed services defined in the organization’s security policy: The 
core foundation for any security activity within an organization is the enforcement of 
the organizational security policy and scanning provides the technical support and 
evidence that this policy is being correctly adhered to and in place. The scanning gives 
the tester proof the security components for the policy are in effect and active for the 
agency or organizations.
-	 Prepare for penetration testing: Penetration testing, as defined below, needs to be focused 
on the hosts, machines, and devices of the network and the system; therefore, the 
scanning gives the tester the right machine names, IP addresses, and services which 
are active. Many times, the penetration testing will identify the deficiencies in the 
systems by using the scan data to drill into the security of the machines and devices.
-	 Configure IDS: Scanning provides many areas for the security personnel to identify 
and isolate responses needed for tuning the network IDS (NIDS) devices to properly 
respond to deficiencies and behavioral patterns.
	
Potential recommendations for testers to identify corrective actions to results from this 
type of evaluation include:
•	 Investigate and disconnect unauthorized hosts.
•	 Disable or remove unnecessary and vulnerable services.
•	 Modify hosts to restrict access to vulnerable services to a limited number of required hosts.
•	 Modify enterprise firewalls to restrict outside access to known vulnerable services.
2.	 Vulnerability scanning:
Like network port and service identification, vulnerability scanning identifies hosts and host attributes (e.g., 
operating systems, applications, open ports), but it also attempts to identify vulnerabilities rather than relying 
on human interpretation of the scanning results. Many vulnerability scanners are equipped to accept results 
from network discovery and network port and service identification, which reduces the amount of work needed 
for vulnerability scanning. Also, some scanners can perform their own network discovery and network port and 
service identification. Vulnerability scanning can help identify outdated software versions, missing patches, and 
misconfigurations, and validate compliance with or deviations from an organization’s security policy. This is 
done by identifying the operating systems and major software applications running on the hosts and matching 
them with information on known vulnerabilities stored in the scanners’ vulnerability databases.12
	
Vulnerability scanning is often used to conduct the following test and evaluation 
activities:
a.	 Identify active hosts on network.
b.	Define the active and vulnerable services (ports) on hosts.

needed for use of scanning so I will not try to go into detail on those uses of vulnerability 
scanning here.

-	 Upgrade or patch vulnerable systems.
-	 Deploy mitigating measures.
-	 Improve configuration management program and procedures.

	(ii)	Examine applicability to environment.

3.	 Password cracking:
When a user enters a password, a hash of the entered password is generated and compared with 
a stored hash of the user’s actual password. If the hashes match, the user is authenticated. Password 
cracking is the process of recovering passwords from password hashes stored in a computer system or 
transmitted over networks. It is usually performed during assessments to identify accounts with weak 
passwords. Password cracking is performed on hashes that are either intercepted by a network sniffer 
while being transmitted across a network, or retrieved from the target system, which generally requires 
administrative-level access on, or physical access to, the target system. Once these hashes are obtained, an 
automated password cracker rapidly generates additional hashes until a match is found or the assessor 
halts the cracking attempt.13
a.	 Identifies weak passwords:
Password crackers can be run during an assessment to ensure policy compliance by verifying acceptable 
password composition. For example, if the organization has a password expiration policy, then password 
crackers can be run at intervals that coincide with the intended password lifetime. Password cracking that is 
performed offline produces little or no impact on the system or network, and the benefits of this operation 
include validating the organization’s password policy and verifying policy compliance.14
13SP 800-115, p. 5-1.

﻿
b.	Stored and transmitted in encrypted form: Hashes of passwords are primarily stored in 
hash (one-way encryption) format and are often stored in a password hash file on the 
server (SAM file on Windows boxes, “/etc/password” file on UNIX boxes). These 
files are usually the first target of malicious attackers to retrieve the passwords and 
then crack the administrative passwords off the machine so they can then re-enter 
the machine and use the correct password on the first log-in attempt and bypass the 
common security tool of locking out the account if incorrectly entering the password 
three times.
c.	 Dictionary attack/hybrid attack/brute force:
One method for generating hashes is a dictionary attack, which uses all words in a dictionary or text file. 
There are numerous dictionaries available on the Internet that encompass major and minor languages, names, 
popular television shows, etc. Another cracking method is known as a hybrid attack, which builds on the dic-
tionary method by adding numeric and symbolic characters to dictionary words. Depending on the password 
cracker being used, this type of attack can try a number of variations, such as using common substitutions 
of characters and numbers for letters (e.g., p@ssword and h4ckme). Some will also try adding characters and 
numbers to the beginning and end of dictionary words (e.g., password99, password$%).
Yet another password-cracking method is called the brute force method. This generates all possible pass-
words up to a certain length and their associated hashes. Since there are so many possibilities, it can take 
months to crack a password. Although brute force can take a long time, it usually takes far less time than most 
password policies specify for password changing. Consequently, passwords found during brute force attacks 
are still too weak. Theoretically, all passwords can be cracked by a brute force attack, given enough time and 
processing power, although it could take many years and require serious computing power. Assessors and 
attackers often have multiple machines over which they can spread the task of cracking passwords, which 
greatly shortens the time involved.13
d.	Theoretically all passwords are “crackable”:
Password cracking can also be performed with rainbow tables, which are lookup tables with pre-computed 
password hashes. For example, a rainbow table can be created that contains every possible password for a 
given character set up to a certain character length. Assessors may then search the table for the password 
hashes that they are trying to crack. Rainbow tables require large amounts of storage space and can take a 
long time to generate, but their primary shortcoming is that they may be ineffective against password hashing 
that uses salting. Salting is the inclusion of a random piece of information in the password hashing process 
that decreases the likelihood of identical passwords returning the same hash. Rainbow tables will not produce 
correct results without taking salting into account—but this dramatically increases the amount of storage 
space that the tables require. Many operating systems use salted password hashing mechanisms to reduce the 
effectiveness of rainbow tables and other forms of password cracking.15
e.	 “LanMan” password hashes:
The “LanMan” hash is a compromised password hashing function that was the primary hash that ­Microsoft 
LAN Manager and Microsoft Windows versions prior to Windows NT used to store user passwords. Support 
for the legacy LAN Manager protocol continued in later versions of Windows for backward compatibility, 
but was recommended by Microsoft to be turned off by administrators; as of Windows Vista, the protocol is 
disabled by default, but continues to be used by some non-Microsoft Common Internet File System (CIFS) 
implementations.

Security testing techniques

﻿
The LM hash is not a true one-way hash encryption function as the password can be determined from the 
hash because of several weaknesses in its design:
a.	 Passwords are limited to a maximum of only 14 characters
b.	 Passwords longer than 7 characters are divided into two pieces and each piece is hashed separately
c.	 All lower case letters in the password are changed to upper case before the password is hashed
d.	 The LM hash also does not use cryptographic salt, a standard technique to prevent pre-computed diction-
ary attacks
e.	 Implementation issue — since the LanMan Hashes change only when a user changes their password, they 
can be used to carry out a pass the hash side channel attack.
While LAN Manager is considered obsolete and current Windows operating systems use the stronger 
NTLMv2 or Kerberos authentication methods, Windows systems before Windows Vista/Windows Server 
2008 enabled the LAN Manager hash by default for backward compatibility with legacy LAN Manager and 
Windows Me or earlier clients, or legacy NetBIOS-enabled applications.16
	
	
For many years, LanMan hashes have been identified as weak password 
implementation techniques, but they persist and continue to be used throughout the 
server community as people do not often change the server implementation and view 
them as relatively obscure and difficult to retrieve.
4.	 Log reviews:
Log review determines if security controls are logging the proper information, and if the organization 
is adhering to its log management policies. As a source of historical information, audit logs can be used to 
help validate that the system is operating in accordance with established policies. For example, if the logging 
policy states that all authentication attempts to critical servers must be logged, the log review will determine 
if this information is being collected and shows the appropriate level of detail. Log review may also reveal 
problems such as misconfigured services and security controls, unauthorized accesses, and attempted intru-
sions. For example, if an intrusion detection system (IDS) sensor is placed behind a firewall, its logs can be 
used to examine communications that the firewall allows into the network. If the sensor registers activities 
that should be blocked, it indicates that the firewall is not configured securely.
Examples of log information that may be useful when conducting technical security assessments include:
• Authentication server or system logs may include successful and failed authentication attempts.
• System logs may include system and service startup and shutdown information, installation of unauthor-
ized software, file accesses, security policy changes, account changes (e.g., account creation and deletion, 
account privilege assignment), and privilege use.
• Intrusion detection and prevention system logs may include malicious activity and inappropriate use.
• Firewall and router logs may include outbound connections that indicate compromised internal devices 
(e.g., rootkits, bots, Trojan horses, spyware).
• Firewall logs may include unauthorized connection attempts and inappropriate use.
• Application logs may include unauthorized connection attempts, account changes, use of privileges, and 
application or database usage information.
• Antivirus logs may include update failures and other indications of outdated signatures and software.
• Security logs, in particular patch management and some IDS and intrusion prevention system (IPS) prod-
ucts, may record information on known vulnerable services and applications.
Manually reviewing logs can be extremely time-consuming and cumbersome. Automated audit tools are 
available that can significantly reduce review time and generate predefined and customized reports that 
summarize log contents and track them to a set of specific activities. Assessors can also use these automated 
tools to facilitate log analysis by converting logs in different formats to a single, standard format for analysis.

﻿
In addition, if assessors are reviewing a specific action—such as the number of failed logon attempts in an 
organization—they can use these tools to filter logs based on the activity being checked.17
	
	
Log management and analysis should be conducted frequently on major servers, 
firewalls, IDS devices, and other applications. Logs that should be considered for use and 
review in any log management system include:
a.	 Firewall logs
b.	IDS logs
c.	 Server logs
d.	Other logs that are collecting audit data – especially network devices
e.	 Snort – free IDS sensors and their data components
5.	 File integrity checkers:
File integrity checkers provide a way to identify that system files have been changed computing and stor-
ing a checksum for every guarded file, and establishing a file checksum database. Stored checksums are later 
recomputed to compare their current value with the stored value, which identifies file modifications. A file 
integrity checker capability is usually included with any commercial host-based IDS, and is also available as 
a standalone utility.
Although an integrity checker does not require a high degree of human interaction, it must be used care-
fully to ensure its effectiveness. File integrity checking is most effective when system files are compared 
with a reference database created using a system known to be secure—this helps ensure that the reference 
database was not built with compromised files. The reference database should be stored offline to prevent 
attackers from compromising the system and covering their tracks by modifying the database. In addition, 
because patches and other updates change files, the checksum database should be kept up-to-date. For file 
integrity checking, strong cryptographic checksums such as Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA-1) should be 
used to ensure the integrity of data stored in the checksum database. Federal agencies are required by Federal 
Information Processing Standard (FIPS) PUB 140-2, Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules, to use 
SHA (e.g., SHA-1, SHA-256).18
	
	
File integrity checkers usually have the following features which provide the tester a 
specialized method of evaluating the file or directory structures:
a.	 Compute and store a checksum
b.	Recomputed regularly
c.	 Initial reference database
d.	False-positive alarm adjustment
6.	 Antivirus protection/virus detectors: Antivirus (AV) software was originally developed to 
detect and remove computer viruses. However, with the proliferation of other kinds 
of malware, AV software started to provide protection from other computer threats. In 
particular, modern AV software can protect from: backdoors, rootkits, Trojan horses, 
worms, malicious Layered Service Providers (LSPs), dialers, fraudtools, malicious Browser 
Helper Objects (BHOs), browser hijackers, ransomware, keyloggers, adware, and spyware. 
Some virus detector products also include protection from other computer threats, such as 
infected and malicious URLs, spam, scam and phishing attacks, online identity (privacy), 
online banking attacks, social engineering techniques, advanced persistent threat (APT), 
botnets, and even Decision Disk Operating System (DDoS) attacks.

It is primarily used to detect and isolate the following types of threats:
a.	 Virus, Trojan, or worm.
b.	Malicious code.
c.	 More sophisticated programs also look for virus-like activity in an attempt to identify 
new or mutated viruses.
	
	
Two primary types are as follows:
a.	 Network infrastructure–based AV software
b.	End-user machine–based AV software
	
	
There are several methods which AV engine can use to identify malware:
a.	 Signature-based detection: Is the most common method. To identify viruses and other 
malware, the AV engine compares the contents of a file to its database of known 
malware signatures. Traditionally, AV software heavily relied on signatures to 
identify malware.
b.	Heuristic-based detection: Is generally used together with signature-based detection. It 
detects malware based on characteristics typically used in known malware code.
c.	 Behavioral-based detection is similar to heuristic-based detection and used also in IDS. 
The main difference is that, instead of characteristics hardcoded in the malware code 
itself, it is based on the behavioral fingerprint of the malware at run time. Clearly, this 
technique is able to detect (known or unknown) malware only after they have starting 
doing their malicious actions.
d.	Sandbox detection is a particular behavioral-based detection technique that, instead 
of detecting the behavioral fingerprint at run time, executes the programs in a virtual 
environment, logging what actions the program performs. Depending on the actions 
logged, the AV engine can determine if the program is malicious or not. If not, then, 
the program is executed in the real environment. Albeit this technique has shown to 
be quite effective, given its heaviness and slowness, it is rarely used in end-user AV 
solutions.
e.	 Data mining techniques are one of the latest approaches applied in malware detection. 
Data mining and machine learning algorithms are used to try to classify the behavior 
of a file (as either malicious or benign) given a series of file features that are extracted 
from the file itself.
7.	 War dialing:
Several available software packages allow network administrators—and attackers—to dial large blocks 
of telephone numbers to search for available modems. This process is called war dialing. A computer with 
four modems can dial 10,000 numbers in a matter of days. War dialers provide reports on numbers with 
modems, and some dialers have the capacity to attempt limited automatic attacks when a modem is discov-
ered. Organizations should conduct war dialing at least once per year to identify their unauthorized and 
the organization’s phone system. (It should be considered, however, that many unauthorized modems may 
be turned off after hours and might go undetected.) War dialing may also be used to detect fax equipment. 
Testing should include all numbers that belong to an organization, except those that could be impacted by 
receiving a large number of calls (e.g., 24-hour operation centers and emergency numbers). Most types of 
war dialing software allow testers to exempt specific numbers from the calling list.
Skills needed to conduct remote access testing include TCP/IP and networking knowledge; knowledge of 
remote access technologies and protocols; knowledge of authentication and access control methods; general

knowledge of telecommunications systems and modem/PBX operations; and the ability to use scanning and 
security testing tools such as war dialers.19
	
	
Some of the criteria for war dialing include:
a.	 Going after unauthorized modems
b.	Dialing large blocks of phone numbers in search of available modems
c.	 Including all numbers that belong to an organization
8.	 Wireless LAN testing:
Wireless technologies, in their simplest sense, enable one or more devices to communicate without the 
need for physical connections such as network or peripheral cables. They range from simple technologies 
like wireless keyboards and mice to complex cell phone networks and enterprise wireless local area networks 
(WLAN). As the number and availability of wireless-enabled devices continues to increase, it is important for 
organizations to actively test and secure their enterprise wireless environments. Wireless scans can help orga-
nizations determine corrective actions to mitigate risks posed by wireless-enabled technologies.
Wireless scanning should be conducted using a mobile device with wireless analyzer software installed 
and configured—such as a laptop, handheld device, or specialty device. The scanning software or tool should 
allow the operator to configure the device for specific scans, and to scan in both passive and active modes. The 
scanning software should also be configurable by the operator to identify deviations from the organization’s 
wireless security configuration requirements.
The wireless scanning tool should be capable of scanning all Institute of Electrical and Electronics ­Engineers 
(IEEE) 802.11a/b/g/n channels, whether domestic or international. In some cases, the device should also be 
fitted with an external antenna to provide an additional level of radio frequency (RF) capturing capability. 
Support for other wireless technologies, such as Bluetooth, will help evaluate the presence of additional wire-
less threats and vulnerabilities. Note that devices using nonstandard technology or frequencies outside of the 
scanning tool’s RF range will not be detected or properly recognized by the scanning tool. A tool such as an 
RF spectrum analyzer will assist organizations in identifying transmissions that occur within the frequency 
range of the spectrum analyzer. Spectrum analyzers generally analyze a large frequency range (e.g., 3 to 
18 GHz)—and although these devices do not analyze traffic, they enable an assessor to determine wireless 
activity within a specific frequency range and tailor additional testing and examination accordingly.
Passive scanning should be conducted regularly to supplement wireless security measures already in 
place, such as WIDPSs. Wireless scanning tools used to conduct completely passive scans transmit no data, 
nor do the tools in any way affect the operation of deployed wireless devices. By not transmitting data, a pas-
sive scanning tool remains undetected by malicious users and other devices. This reduces the likelihood of 
individuals avoiding detection by disconnecting or disabling unauthorized wireless devices.
Passive scanning tools capture wireless traffic being transmitted within the range of the tool’s antenna. 
Most tools provide several key attributes regarding discovered wireless devices, including service set identi-
fier (SSID), device type, channel, media access control (MAC) address, signal strength, and number of packets 
being transmitted. This information can be used to evaluate the security of the wireless environment, and to 
identify potential rogue devices and unauthorized ad hoc networks discovered within range of the scanning 
device. The wireless scanning tool should also be able to assess the captured packets to determine if any 
operational anomalies or threats exist.
Wireless scanning tools scan each IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n channel/frequency separately, often for only ­several 
hundred milliseconds at a time. The passive scanning tool may not receive all transmissions on a specific 
­channel. For example, the tool may have been scanning channel 1 at the precise moment when a wireless device 
transmitted a packet on channel 5. This makes it important to set the dwell time of the tool to be long enough 
to capture packets, yet short enough to efficiently scan each channel. Dwell time configurations will depend 
on the device or tool used to conduct the wireless scans. In addition, security personnel conducting the scans 
should slowly move through the area being scanned to reduce the number of devices that go undetected.

Security testing techniques	
521
﻿
Rogue devices can be identified in several ways through passive scanning:
• The MAC address of a discovered wireless device indicates the vendor of the device’s wireless interface. If 
an organization only deploys wireless interfaces from vendors A and B, the presence of interfaces from any 
other vendor indicates potential rogue devices.
• If an organization has accurate records of its deployed wireless devices, assessors can compare the MAC 
addresses of discovered devices with the MAC addresses of authorized devices. Most scanning tools allow 
assessors to enter a list of authorized devices. Because MAC addresses can be spoofed, assessors should 
not assume that the MAC addresses of discovered devices are accurate—but checking MAC addresses can 
identify rogue devices that do not use spoofing.
• Rogue devices may use SSIDs that are not authorized by the organization.
• Some rogue devices may use SSIDs that are authorized by the organization but do not adhere to its wireless 
security configuration requirements.
The signal strength of potential rogue devices should be reviewed to determine whether the devices are 
located within the confines of the facility or in the area being scanned. Devices operating outside an orga-
nization’s confines might still pose significant risks because the organization’s devices might inadvertently 
associate to them.
Organizations can move beyond passive wireless scanning to conduct active scanning. This builds on the 
information collected during passive scans, and attempts to attach to discovered devices and conduct penetra-
tion or vulnerability-related testing. For example, organizations can conduct active wireless scanning on their 
authorized wireless devices to ensure that they meet wireless security configuration requirements—includ-
ing authentication mechanisms, data encryption, and administration access if this information is not already 
available through other means.
Organizations should be cautious in conducting active scans to make sure they do not inadvertently scan 
devices owned or operated by neighboring organizations that are within range. It is important to evaluate 
the physical location of devices before actively scanning them. Organizations should also be cautious in per-
forming active scans of rogue devices that appear to be operating within the organization’s facility. Such 
devices could belong to a visitor to the organization who inadvertently has wireless access enabled, or to a 
neighboring organization with a device that is close to, but not within, the organization’s facility. Generally, 
organizations should focus on identifying and locating potential rogue devices rather than performing active 
scans of such devices.
Organizations may use active scanning when conducting penetration testing on their own wireless 
­devices. Tools are available that employ scripted attacks and functions, attempt to circumvent implemented 
security measures, and evaluate the security level of devices. For example, tools used to conduct wireless 
penetration testing attempt to connect to access points (AP) through various methods to circumvent security 
configurations. If the tool can gain access to the AP, it can obtain information and identify the wired networks 
and wireless devices to which the AP is connected.
Security personnel who operate the wireless scanning tool should attempt to locate suspicious devices. 
RF signals propagate in a manner relative to the environment, which makes it important for the operator to 
understand how wireless technology supports this process. Mapping capabilities are useful here, but the main 
factors needed to support this capability are a knowledgeable operator and an appropriate wireless antenna.
If rogue devices are discovered and physically located during the wireless scan, security personnel should 
ensure that specific policies and processes are followed on how the rogue device is handled—such as shutting 
it down, reconfiguring it to comply with the organization’s policies, or removing the device completely. If the 
device is to be removed, security personnel should evaluate the activity of the rogue device before it is confis-
cated. This can be done through monitoring transmissions and attempting to access the device.
If discovered wireless devices cannot be located during the scan, security personnel should attempt to 
use a WIDPS to support the location of discovered devices. This requires the WIDPS to locate a specific 
MAC address that was discovered during the scan. Properly deployed WIDPSs should have the ability to 
assist security personnel in locating these devices, and usually involves the use of multiple WIDPS sensors 
to increase location identification granularity. Because the WIDPS will only be able to locate a device within 
several feet, a wireless scanning tool may still be needed to pinpoint the location of the device.
For organizations that want to confirm compliance with their Bluetooth security requirements, passive 
scanning for Bluetooth-enabled wireless devices should be conducted to evaluate potential presence and 

522

﻿
activity. Because Bluetooth has a very short range (on average 9 meters [30 feet], with some devices having 
ranges of as little as 1 meter [3 feet]), scanning for devices can be difficult and time-consuming. Assessors 
should take range limitations into consideration when scoping this type of scanning. Organizations may want 
to perform scanning only in areas of their facilities that are accessible by the public—to see if attackers could 
gain access to devices via Bluetooth—or to perform scanning in a sampling of physical locations rather than 
throughout the entire facility. Because many Bluetooth-enabled devices (such as cell phones and personal 
digital assistants [PDA]) are mobile, conducting passive scanning several times over a period of time may 
be necessary. Organizations should also scan any Bluetooth infrastructure, such as access points, that they 
deploy. If rogue access points are discovered, the organization should handle them in accordance with estab-
lished policies and processes.
A number of tools are available for actively testing the security and operation of Bluetooth devices. These 
tools attempt to connect to discovered devices and perform attacks to surreptitiously gain access and con-
nectivity to Bluetooth-enabled devices. Assessors should be extremely cautious of performing active scanning 
because of the likelihood of inadvertently scanning personal Bluetooth devices, which are found in many 
environments. As a general rule, assessors should use active scanning only when they are certain that the 
­devices being scanned belong to the organization. Active scanning can be used to evaluate the security mode 
in which a Bluetooth device is operating, and the strength of Bluetooth password identification numbers 
(PIN). Active scanning can also be used to verify that these devices are set to the lowest possible operational 
power setting to minimize their range. As with IEEE 802.11a/b/g rogue devices, rogue Bluetooth devices 
should be dealt with in accordance with policies and guidance.20
	
	
Uses for wireless scanning include identifying the following areas for further testing 
and evaluation:
a.	 802.11
b.	Serious flaws in its current implementation of Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)
c.	 Default configuration
d.	Websites that publish the locations of discovered wireless networks
e.	 Insertion attacks
f.	 Interception and monitoring of wireless traffic
g.	DOS
h.	Client-to-client attacks
9.	 Penetration testing: Penetration testing is security testing in which assessors mimic 
real-world attacks to identify methods for circumventing the security features of an 
application, system, or network. It often involves launching real attacks on real systems 
and data that use tools and techniques commonly used by attackers. Most penetration 
tests involve looking for combinations of vulnerabilities on one or more systems that 
can be used to gain more access than could be achieved through a single vulnerability. 
Penetration testing can also be useful for determining:
a.	 How well the system tolerates real world–style attack patterns
b.	The likely level of sophistication an attacker needs to successfully compromise the 
system
c.	 Additional countermeasures that could mitigate threats against the system
d.	Defenders’ ability to detect attacks and respond appropriately
	
	
Penetration testing can be invaluable, but it is labor-intensive and requires great 
expertise to minimize the risk to targeted systems. Systems may be damaged or

otherwise rendered inoperable during the course of penetration testing, even though 
the organization benefits in knowing how a system could be rendered inoperable by 
an intruder. Although experienced penetration testers can mitigate this risk, it can 
never be fully eliminated. Penetration testing should be performed only after careful 
consideration, notification, and planning.
	
	
Penetration testing often includes nontechnical methods of attack. For example, a 
penetration tester could breach physical security controls and procedures to connect 
to a network, steal equipment, capture sensitive information (possibly by installing 
keylogging devices), or disrupt communications. Caution should be exercised when 
performing physical security testing – security guards should be made aware of how 
to verify the validity of tester activity, such as via a point of contact or documentation. 
Another nontechnical means of attack is the use of social engineering, such as posing 
as a help desk agent and calling to request a user’s passwords, or calling the help desk 
posing as a user and asking for a password to be reset.
	
	
The objectives of a penetration test are to simulate an attack using tools and 
techniques that may be restricted by law. This practice then needs the following areas for 
consideration and delineation in order to properly conduct this type of testing:
a.	 Formal permission
b.	IP addresses/ranges to be tested
c.	 Any restricted hosts
d.	List of acceptable testing techniques
e.	 When and how long?
f.	 IP addresses of the machines launching test
g.	POCs for the testing team, targeted systems, and the networks
h.	Measures to prevent law enforcement being called with false alarms
i.	 Handling of info collected by testing team
1.	 Overt or covert testing: There are several ways to conduct these types of tests. Testing 
can be conducted either overtly (also known as blue team or white-hat testing) or 
covertly (also known as red team or black-hat testing).
Overt security testing, also known as white hat testing, involves performing external and/or internal 
testing with the knowledge and consent of the organization’s IT staff, enabling comprehensive evaluation 
of the network or system security posture. Because the IT staff is fully aware of and involved in the test-
ing, it may be able to provide guidance to limit the testing’s impact. Testing may also provide a training 
opportunity, with staff observing the activities and methods used by assessors to evaluate and potentially 
circumvent implemented security measures. This gives context to the security requirements implemented 
or maintained by the IT staff, and also may help teach IT staff how to conduct testing.
Covert security testing, also known as black hat testing, takes an adversarial approach by performing 
testing without the knowledge of the organization’s IT staff but with the full knowledge and permission of 
upper management. Some organizations designate a trusted third party to ensure that the target organiza-
tion does not initiate response measures associated with the attack without first verifying that an attack is 
indeed underway (e.g., that the activity being detected does not originate from a test). In such situations, 
the trusted third party provides an agent for the assessors, the management, the IT staff, and the security 
staff that mediates activities and facilitates communications. This type of test is useful for testing technical 
security controls, IT staff response to perceived security incidents, and staff knowledge and implementation 
of the organization’s security policy. Covert testing may be conducted with or without warning.
The purpose of covert testing is to examine the damage or impact an adversary can cause—it does not 
focus on identifying vulnerabilities. This type of testing does not test every security control, identify each

﻿
vulnerability, or assess all systems within an organization. Covert testing examines the organization from 
gain network access. If an organization’s goal is to mirror a specific adversary, this type of testing requires 
special considerations—such as acquiring and modeling threat data. The resulting scenarios provide an over-
all strategic view of the potential methods of exploit, risk, and impact of an intrusion. Covert testing usually 
has defined boundaries, such as stopping testing when a certain level of access is achieved or a certain type of 
damage is achievable as a next step in testing. Having such boundaries prevents damage while still showing 
that the damage could occur.
Besides failing to identify many vulnerabilities, covert testing is often time-consuming and costly due 
to its stealth requirements. To operate in a stealth environment, a test team will have to slow its scans and 
other actions to stay “under the radar” of the target organization’s security staff. When testing is performed 
in-house, training must also be considered in terms of time and budget. In addition, an organization may 
have staff trained to perform regular activities such as scanning and vulnerability assessments, but not 
specialized techniques such as penetration or application security testing. Overt testing is less expensive, 
carries less risk than covert testing, and is more frequently used—but covert testing provides a better 
­indication of the everyday security of the target organization because system administrators will not have 
heightened awareness.21
	
	
Penetration test scenarios should focus on locating and targeting exploitable defects 
in the design and implementation of an application, system, or network. Tests should 
reproduce both the most likely and the most damaging attack patterns – including 
worst-case scenarios such as malicious actions by administrators. Since a penetration test 
scenario can be designed to simulate an inside attack, an outside attack, or both, external 
and internal security testing methods are considered. If both internal and external testing 
are to be performed, the external testing usually occurs first.
	
	
Outsider scenarios simulate the outsider attacker who has little or no specific knowledge 
of the target and who works entirely from assumptions. To simulate an external attack, 
testers are provided with no real information about the target environment other than 
targeted IP addresses or address ranges, and perform open source research by collecting 
information on the targets from public web pages, newsgroups, and similar sites. Port 
scanners and vulnerability scanners are then used to identify target hosts. If given a list of 
authorized IP addresses to use as targets, assessors should verify that all public addresses 
(i.e., not private, unroutable addresses) are under the organization’s purview before testing 
begins. Websites that provide domain name registration information (e.g., WHOIS) can be 
used to determine owners of address spaces. Since the testers’ traffic usually goes through 
a firewall, the amount of information obtained from scanning is far less than if the test 
were undertaken from an insider perspective. After identifying hosts on the network that 
can be reached from outside, testers attempt to compromise one of the hosts. If successful, 
this access may then be used to compromise other hosts that are not generally accessible 
from outside the network. Penetration testing is an iterative process that leverages minimal 
access to gain greater access.
	
	
Insider scenarios simulate the actions of a malicious insider. An internal penetration test 
is similar to an external test, except that the testers are on the internal network (i.e., behind 
the firewall) and have been granted some level of access to the network or specific network 
systems. Using this access, the penetration testers try to gain a greater level of access to the 
network and its systems through privilege escalation. Testers are provided with network

information that someone with their level of access would normally have – generally 
as a standard employee, although depending on the goals of the test it could instead be 
information that a system or network administrator might possess.
	
	
Penetration testing is important for determining the vulnerability of an organization’s 
network and the level of damage that can occur if the network is compromised. It is 
important to be aware that depending on an organization’s policies, testers may be 
prohibited from using particular tools or techniques or may be limited to using them 
only during certain times of the day or days of the week. Penetration testing also poses 
a high risk to the organization’s networks and systems because it uses real exploits and 
attacks against production systems and data. Because of its high cost and potential impact, 
penetration testing of an organization’s network and systems on an annual basis may be 
sufficient. Also, penetration testing can be designed to stop when the tester reaches a point 
when an additional action will cause damage. The results of penetration testing should 
be taken seriously, and any vulnerabilities discovered should be mitigated. Results, when 
available, should be presented to the organization’s managers. Organizations should 
consider conducting less labor-intensive testing activities on a regular basis to ensure 
that they are maintaining their required security posture. A well-designed program of 
regularly scheduled network and vulnerability scanning, interspersed with periodic 
penetration testing, can help prevent many types of attacks and reduce the potential 
impact of successful ones.22
FOUR PHASES OF PENETRATION TESTING
1.	 Planning: “In the planning phase, rules are identified, management approval is finalized 
and documented, and testing goals are set. The planning phase sets the groundwork 
for a successful penetration test. No actual testing occurs in this phase.”15 In planning 
a penetration test, always include a legal review for the test event with the corporate 
counsel staff of the organization that is being tested, as there are some strong legal issues 
which need to be identified and documented prior to conducting the testing. These issues 
include conducting testing on government systems from outside, which under CFAA and 
CSA is typically considered illegal as well as the actual testing may include breaching a 
system with sensitive information. These various criteria are included elsewhere in this 
handbook, but I wish to re-emphasize these again here as a caution.
22SP 800-115, p. 5-5, 5-6.

10.  System and Network Assessments
﻿
2.	 Discovery:
The discovery phase of penetration testing includes two parts. The first part is the start of actual test-
ing, and covers information gathering and scanning. Network port and service identification is conducted to 
identify potential targets. In addition to port and service identification, other techniques are used to gather 
information on the targeted network:
a)	 Host name and IP address information can be gathered through many methods, including DNS inter-
rogation, InterNIC (WHOIS) queries, and network sniffing (generally only during internal tests)
b)	 Employee names and contact information can be obtained by searching the organization’s Web servers or 
directory servers
c)	 System information, such as names and shares can be found through methods such as NetBIOS enumera-
tion (generally only during internal tests) and Network Information System (NIS) (generally only during 
internal tests)
d)	 Application and service information, such as version numbers, can be recorded through banner grabbing.
	
	
In some cases, techniques such as dumpster diving and physical walk-throughs of 
facilities may be used to collect additional information on the targeted network, and 
may also uncover additional information to be used during the penetration tests, such as 
passwords written on paper.
	
	
The second part of the discovery phase is vulnerability analysis, which involves 
comparing the services, applications, and operating systems of scanned hosts against 
vulnerability databases (a process that is automatic for vulnerability scanners) and 
the testers’ own knowledge of vulnerabilities. Human testers can use their own 
databases – or public databases such as the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) – 
to identify vulnerabilities manually. Manual processes can identify new or obscure 
vulnerabilities that automated scanners may miss, but are much slower than an 
automated scanner.
	
	
Some of the various discovery techniques used during penetration testing are 
identified as follows:
a.	 DNS queries
b.	InterNIC (whois) queries
c.	 Target organization’s website information
d.	Social engineering techniques including:
-	 Dumpster diving: Gathering info on a target by digging through what they have 
thrown out
e.	 Packet sniffing/capture
f.	 NetBIOS enumeration
g.	Network Information System (NIS)
h.	Banner grabbing
i.	 Vulnerability analysis:
-	 Services
-	 Applications
-	 Operating systems
-	 Manual
-	 Automated scanners
3.	 Attack: Executing an attack is at the heart of any penetration test. The figure below 
represents the individual steps of the attack phase – the process of verifying previously

identified potential vulnerabilities by attempting to exploit them. The four steps to any 
attack are as follows:
a.	 Gaining access
b.	Escalating privilege
c.	 System browsing
d.	Installing additional test software
	
	
If an attack is successful, the vulnerability is verified and safeguards are identified to 
mitigate the associated security exposure. In many cases, exploits that are executed do 
not grant the maximum level of potential access to an attacker. They may instead result 
in the testers learning more about the targeted network and its potential vulnerabilities, 
or induce a change in the state of the targeted network’s security. Some exploits enable 
testers to escalate their privileges on the system or network to gain access to additional 
resources. If this occurs, additional analysis and testing are required to determine the 
true level of risk for the network, such as identifying the types of information that can 
be gleaned, changed, or removed from the system. In the event an attack on a specific 
vulnerability proves impossible, the tester should attempt to exploit another discovered 
vulnerability. If testers are able to exploit a vulnerability, they can install more tools on 
the target system or network to facilitate the testing process. These tools are used to gain 
access to additional systems or resources on the network, and obtain access to information 
about the network or organization. Testing and analysis on multiple systems should be 
conducted during a penetration test to determine the level of access an adversary could 
gain. This process is represented in the feedback loop in the figure above between the 
attack and the discovery phase of a penetration test.
	
	
While vulnerability scanners check only for the possible existence of a 
vulnerability, the attack phase of a penetration test exploits the vulnerability to 
confirm its existence.

528	
10.  System and Network Assessments
﻿
	
	
Most vulnerabilities exploited by penetration testing fall into the following categories:
a.	 Misconfigurations: Misconfigured security settings, particularly insecure default 
settings, are usually easily exploitable.
b.	Kernel flaws: Kernel code is the core of an OS, and enforces the overall security model 
for the system – so any security flaw in the kernel puts the entire system in danger.
c.	 Buffer overflows: A buffer overflow occurs when programs do not adequately check 
input for appropriate length. When this occurs, arbitrary code can be introduced into 
the system and executed with the privileges – often at the administrative level – of the 
running program.
d.	Insufficient input validation: Many applications fail to fully validate the input they 
receive from users. An example is a web application that embeds a value from a user 
in a database query. If the user enters SQL commands instead of or in addition to the 
requested value, and the web application does not filter the SQL commands, the query 
may be run with malicious changes that the user requested – causing what is known as 
a SQL injection attack.
e.	 Symbolic links: A symbolic link (symlink) is a file that points to another file. Operating 
systems include programs that can change the permissions granted to a file. If these 
programs run with privileged permissions, a user could strategically create symlinks 
to trick these programs into modifying or listing critical system files.
f.	 File descriptor attacks: File descriptors are numbers used by the system to keep track of files 
in lieu of filenames. Specific types of file descriptors have implied uses. When a privileged 
program assigns an inappropriate file descriptor, it exposes that file to compromise.
g.	Race conditions: Race conditions can occur during the time a program or process 
has entered into a privileged mode. A user can time an attack to take advantage of 
elevated privileges while the program or process is still in the privileged mode.
h.	Incorrect file and directory permissions: File and directory permissions control the access 
assigned to users and processes. Poor permissions could allow many types of attacks, 
including the reading or writing of password files or additions to the list of trusted 
remote hosts.
4.	 Reporting: The reporting phase occurs simultaneously with the other three phases of the 
penetration test. In the planning phase, the assessment plan—or ROE—is developed. 
In the discovery and attack phases, written logs are usually kept and periodic reports 
are made to system administrators and/or management. At the conclusion of the test, a 
report is generally developed to describe identified vulnerabilities, present a risk rating, 
and give guidance on how to mitigate the discovered weaknesses. Section 8 discusses 
post-testing activities such as reporting in more detail.23
POST-TEST ACTIONS TO BE TAKEN
As a result of the penetration testing, several areas for action by the tester/assessor include:
• Identifying the issues that need to be addressed quickly
• Delineating the how of the test – the most important step in the testing process
23SP 800-115, p. 5-2 to 5-5.

• Common causes and methods for addressing them:
•	 Lack of (or poorly enforced) organizational security
•	 Misconfiguration
•	 Software (un)reliability
•	 Failure to apply patches
Penetration testing is important for determining the vulnerability of an organization’s network and the 
level of damage that can occur if the network is compromised. It is important to be aware that depending 
on an organization’s policies, testers may be prohibited from using particular tools or techniques or may 
be limited to using them only during certain times of the day or days of the week. Penetration testing also 
poses a high risk to the organization’s networks and systems because it uses real exploits and attacks against 
production systems and data. Because of its high cost and potential impact, penetration testing of an organi-
zation’s network and systems on an annual basis may be sufficient. Also, penetration testing can be designed 
to stop when the tester reaches a point when an additional action will cause damage. The results of penetra-
tion testing should be taken seriously, and any vulnerabilities discovered should be mitigated. Results, when 
available, should be presented to the organization’s managers. Organizations should consider conducting less 
labor-intensive testing activities on a regular basis to ensure that they are maintaining their required security 
posture. A well-designed program of regularly scheduled network and vulnerability scanning, interspersed 
with periodic penetration testing, can help prevent many types of attacks and reduce the potential impact of 
successful ones.24
GENERAL SCHEDULE FOR TESTING CATEGORIES
• Category 1: This category tests to verify the systems or activities that provide security or 
other critical functions for the organization or agency:
•	 Firewalls, routers, and perimeter defense systems such as for intrusion detection
•	 Public access systems such as web and email servers
•	 DNS and directory servers, and other internal systems that would likely be intruder 
targets
• Category 2: This category tests all other systems besides the critical ones:
•	 Assessment testing:
-	 Vulnerability scanning: Vulnerability scanning is designed to allow a cybersecurity 
analyst to create a prioritized list of vulnerabilities for a customer who is likely 
already aware that they are not where they need to be in terms of information 
assurance and computer security. The customer already understands that they have 
open vulnerabilities (perhaps on new computer systems, networks, etc.) and simply 
need assistance identifying and prioritizing them.
	
Also note that during initial vulnerability scans and assessments, the more potential 
vulnerabilities identified, the better.
-	 Log review: Log reviews are important security activity for the purposes of isolating 
anomalous events, identifying troubles in the system or network, and providing 
evidence during troubleshooting and incident response actions. SP 800-92 Log 
Management has many techniques and identified tactics for conducting log 
reviews.
24SP 800-115, p. 5-6.

530	
10.  System and Network Assessments
﻿
-	 Penetration testing: Penetration testing is a process designed to simulate a cyber 
attacker who has a specific goal. Penetrating testing, therefore, is often focused on a 
particular piece of software or network service.
	
	
These tests are conducted by a cybersecurity analyst for customers who are 
already compliant with the regulations for cybersecurity and information assurance, 
but are concerned about vulnerabilities relating to a particular system or part 
of their network. A typical goal could be to access a new network service like a 
customer-facing database.
	
	
The standard output for a penetration test is a report detailing how the cybersecurity 
analyst breached specific cybersecurity defenses during the simulated attack, and 
suggestions on how to remediate this vulnerability.
-	 Configuration checklist review: The federal government security actions today 
typically include configuring machines and services in accordance with standard 
configurations which are defined by checklists for each type of machine and 
the settings for hardening the system under review. The first level of testing, 
compliance testing, involves running through the checklists against the actual 
machine and reviewing these various settings and ensuring they are actually 
installed correctly. Often the scanning tools mentioned above have these various 
settings already installed and the report outputs identify any setting which does 
not meet the criteria.

Security Component Fundamentals 
for Assessment
The key to the management, oversight, and governance of the security components and 
program in the organization is the understanding of the risks involved and how each is treat-
ed and tolerated by the organization. As the assessor for a US governmental system, it is im-
portant to grasp and work with the fundamental requirements for these systems. With the SP 
800-53 structured approach to security controls, the assessor can review each management, 
technical, and operational area of security directly. NIST SP 800-53, rev. 4, is divided into 18 
control families comprising 3 security classes of controls:
1.	 Management controls: Focus on the management of the computer security system and the 
management of risk for a system. They are techniques and concerns that are normally ad-
dressed by management, through policy and documentation.
2.	 Operational controls: Address security issues related to mechanisms primarily 
implemented and executed by people (as opposed to systems). Often, they require 
technical or specialized expertise and rely on management activities as well as technical 
controls.
3.	 Technical controls: Technical controls are security controls that are configured within the 
system. They can provide automated protection for unauthorized access or misuse, facili-
tate detection of security violations, and support security requirements for applications 
and data.
Each family of controls starts with the base “−1” control which defines the policies neces-
sary for the family of controls. All 18 families of controls within the SP 800-53 are defined in 
this manner. These are commonly known as the “XX-1 Policy and Procedures” controls. An 
information security policy is an aggregate of directives, rules, and practices that prescribes 
how an organization manages, protects, and distributes information. Information security 
policy is an essential component of information security governance – without the policy, 
governance has no substance and rules to enforce.
Information security policy should be based on a combination of appropriate legislation, 
such as FISMA; applicable standards, such as NIST Federal Information Processing Stan-
dards (FIPS) and guidance; and internal agency requirements. Therefore, the assessor will 
identify the relevant governmental documents for each policy and then check the system 

532	
11.  Security Component Fundamentals for Assessment
﻿
documentation for reference to those documents. Agency information security policy should 
address the fundamentals of agency information security governance structure, including:
1.	 Information security roles and responsibilities
2.	 Statement of security control baseline and rules for exceeding the baseline
3.	 Rules of behavior that agency users are expected to follow and minimum repercussions 
for noncompliance
We will discuss each of these families of controls in this chapter, starting with the manage-
ment controls.
MANAGEMENT AREAS OF CONSIDERATION
There are many areas which the assessor needs to consider when evaluating and testing 
the various management controls installed on the systems under test as shown below in the 
listing of the families of controls. The starting point for most of these areas is the oversight 
and governance requirements. So the first area of management controls to review would be 
the security program and its operations section.
The management areas covered by SP 800-53 controls are varied and wide in their scope.
The basic ideas behind the controls are to provide direct information security program ele-
ments to assist managers in establishing, implementing, and running an information security 
program. Typically, the organization looks to the program for overall responsibility to ensure 
the selection and implementation of appropriate security controls and to demonstrate the ef-
fectiveness of satisfying their stated security requirements.
As SP 800-100 states: “Federal agencies rely heavily on information technology (IT) to run 
their daily operations and deliver products and services. With an increasing reliability on IT, 
a growing complexity of federal government IT infrastructure, and a constantly changing in-
formation security threat and risk environment, information security has become a mission-
essential function. This function must be managed and governed to reduce the risks to federal 
government operations and to ensure the federal government’s ability to do business and 
serve the American public.”1
Key elements to review for any security management program are as follows:
• Senior management commitment and support: As the cornerstone for successful 
establishment and continuance of an information security management program, 
commitment and support from senior management should exist.
• Policies and procedures: As a structured framework, policy and procedures start with a 
general organization policy providing concise top management declaration of direction.
• Organization: Responsibilities for the protection of individual assets and for carrying out 
specific security processes should be clearly defined. The information security policy 
should provide general guidance on the allocation of security roles and responsibilities in 
the organization.
1SP 800-100, p. 2.

	
Management areas of consideration	
533
﻿
• Security awareness and education: All employees of an organization and, where relevant, 
third-party users should receive appropriate training and regular updates on the 
importance of security in organizational policies and procedures.
• Monitoring and compliance: In assessing the effectiveness of an organization’s security 
program(s) on a continuous basis, IS auditors must have an understanding of the 
organization’s monitoring activities in assessing the effectiveness of security programs 
and controls established.
• Incident handling and response: A computer security incident is an adverse event that 
threatens some aspect of computer security.
While the standards such as NIST, ISO, and Information Security Forum (ISF) divide their 
materials into chapters, these do not translate into a security architecture landscape very well.

﻿
Therefore, the Open Security Architecture Forum2 proposes an architecture that identifies 
topics of poor coverage, determines priorities for new patterns, and helps the community 
coordinate their risk management (RM) activities. Open Security Architecture (OSA) is a not-
for-profit organization, supported by volunteers for the benefit of the security community.
MANAGEMENT CONTROLS
The management controls are defined in SP 800-53 as the overarching controls needed for 
oversight, compliance, and acquisition of security components, equipment, and processes for 
security within a federal system. The basic structure of controls is to define the security action 
to be taken, supplemental guidance for use and installation of the control, any enhancements 
to each control, references, and then the parameters or variables that the organization can use 
to install and implement the control.
Program Management (PM)
Information Security Program Plan
The information security program plan can be represented in a single document or compila-
tion of documents at the discretion of the organization. The plan documents the organization-
wide PM controls and organization-defined common controls. The security plans for indi-
vidual information systems and the organization-wide information security program plan 
together provide complete coverage for all security controls employed within the organiza-
tion. Common controls are documented in an appendix to the organization’s information 
security program plan unless the controls are included in a separate security plan for an 
information system (e.g., security controls employed as part of an intrusion detection system 
(IDS) providing organization-wide boundary protection inherited by one or more organiza-
tional information systems). The organization-wide information security program plan will 
indicate which separate security plans contain descriptions of common controls.
Critical Infrastructure Plan
The organization addresses information security issues in the development, documentation, 
and updating of a critical infrastructure and key resources (CIKR) protection plan. Critical in-
frastructure assets are essential for the functioning of a society and economy. Most commonly 
associated with the term are facilities for:
1.	 Electricity generation, transmission, and distribution
2.	 Gas production, transport, and distribution
3.	 Oil and oil products production, transport, and distribution
4.	 Telecommunication
5.	 Water supply (drinking water, waste water/sewage, stemming of surface water (e.g., 
dikes and sluices))
6.	 Agriculture, food production and distribution

7.	 Heating (e.g., natural gas, fuel oil, district heating)
8.	 Public health (hospitals, ambulances)
9.	 Transportation systems (fuel supply, railway network, airports, harbors, inland 
shipping)
10.	 Financial services (banking, clearing)
11.	 Security services (police, military)
The main document of the US government for the critical infrastructure is HSPD-7, Criti-
cal Infrastructure Identification, Prioritization, and Protection, which references the CIKR of the 
United States.
Essential Services that Underpin American Society
It is the policy of the United States to enhance the protection of our nation’s CIKR against 
terrorist acts that could:
1.	 Cause catastrophic health effects or mass casualties comparable to those from the use of a 
weapon of mass destruction
2.	 Impair federal departments and agencies’ abilities to perform essential missions, or to 
ensure the public’s health and safety
3.	 Undermine state and local government capacities to maintain order and to deliver 
minimum essential public services
4.	 Damage the private sector’s capability to ensure the orderly functioning of the economy 
and delivery of essential services
5.	 Have a negative effect on the economy through the cascading disruption of other CIKR
6.	 Undermine the public’s morale and confidence in our national economic and political 
institutions
Industrial Control Systems Characteristics
• Pervasive throughout critical infrastructure
• Need for real-time response
• Extremely high availability, predictability, and reliability
An industrial control system (ICS) is an information system used to control industrial pro-
cesses such as manufacturing, product handling, production, and distribution. ICSs include 
supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, distributed control systems 
(DCS), and programmable logic controllers (PLC). ICS are typically found in the electric, wa-
ter, oil and gas, chemical, pharmaceutical, pulp and paper, food and beverage, and discrete 
manufacturing (automotive, aerospace, and durable goods) industries as well as in air and 
rail transportation control systems.
Security PM is designed to and often struggles with meeting several and often conflicting 
requirements:
• Minimizing risk to the safety of the public
• Preventing serious damage to environment
• Preventing serious production stoppages or slowdowns

536	
11.  Security Component Fundamentals for Assessment
﻿
• Protecting critical infrastructure from cyber attacks and human error
• Safeguarding against compromise of proprietary information
So the assessor must review the program documents, reports, and reviews to verify the 
documented requirements are actually being met while the A&A – controls review and imple-
mentation process reflects the security is being maintained during operational activities.
INFORMATION SECURITY RESOURCES
The assessor will determine if the organization:
1.	 Ensures that all capital planning and investment requests include the resources needed 
to implement the information security program and documents all exceptions to this 
requirement
2.	 Employs a business case/Exhibit 300/Exhibit 53 to record the resources required
3.	 Ensures that information security resources are available for expenditure as planned
Organizations may designate and empower an Investment Review Board (IRB; or similar 
group) to manage and provide oversight for the information security-related aspects of the 
capital planning and investment control process. Which ties into the Capital Planning and 
Investment Control (SP 800-65) criteria of an Exhibit 300 must be submitted for all major in-
vestments in accordance with this section.
Major information technology (IT) investments also must be reported on the agency’s Ex-
hibit 53. Exhibit 300s and the Exhibit 53, together with the agency’s Enterprise Architecture 
(EA) program, define how to manage the IT Capital Planning and Control Process.
All IT investments must clearly demonstrate the investment is needed to help meet the agen-
cy’s strategic goals and mission. They should also support the President’s Management Agenda 
(PMA). The capital asset plans and business cases (Exhibit 300) and “Agency IT Investment Port-
folio” (Exhibit 53) demonstrate the agency management of IT investments and how these gov-
ernance processes are used when planning and implementing IT investments within the agency.
Investments in the development of new or the continued operation of existing information 
systems, both general support systems and major applications, proposed for funding in the 
President’s budget must:
1.	 Be tied to the agency’s information architecture. Proposals should demonstrate that the 
security controls for components, applications, and systems are consistent with and an 
integral part of the IT architecture of the agency.
2.	 Be well planned, by:
a.	 Demonstrating that the costs of security controls are understood and are explicitly 
incorporated in the life-cycle planning of the overall system in a manner consistent 
with OMB guidance for capital programming
b.	 Incorporating a security plan that discusses risk management.
3.	 Manage risks, by:
a.	 Demonstrating specific methods used to ensure that risks and the potential for 
loss are understood and continually assessed, that steps are taken to maintain risk 
at an acceptable level, and that procedures are in place to ensure that controls are 
implemented effectively and remain effective over time

b.	 Demonstrating specific methods used to ensure that the security controls are 
commensurate with the risk and magnitude of harm that may result from the 
loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or modification of the system itself or the 
information it manages
c.	 Identifying additional security controls that are necessary to minimize risks to 
and potential loss from those systems that promote or permit public access, other 
externally accessible systems, and those systems that are interconnected with systems 
over which program officials have little or no control
4.	 Protect privacy and confidentiality, by:
a.	 Deploying effective security controls and authentication tools consistent with the 
protection of privacy, such as public key–based digital signatures, for those systems 
that promote or permit public access
b.	 Ensuring that the handling of personal information is consistent with relevant 
government-wide and agency policies, such as privacy statements on the agency’s 
websites
5.	 Account for departures from NIST guidance. For non-national security applications, to 
ensure the use of risk-based cost-effective security controls, describe each occasion when 
employing standards and guidance that are more stringent than those promulgated by 
the NIST.
To promote greater attention to security as a fundamental management priority, OMB con-
tinues to take steps to integrate security into the capital planning and budget process. To fur-
ther assist in this integration, the Plan of Action and Milestones (POAMs; M02-01) and annual 
security reports and executive summaries must be cross-referenced to the budget materials 
sent to OMB in the fall including Exhibits 300 and 53.
MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE (SP 800-55)
NIST SP 800-55 is a guide to assist in the development, selection, and implementation of 
measures to be used at the information system and program levels. These measures indicate 
the effectiveness of security controls applied to information systems and supporting infor-
mation security programs. Such measures are used to facilitate decision making, improve 
performance, and increase accountability through the collection, analysis, and reporting of 
relevant performance-related data – providing a way to tie the implementation, efficiency, 
and effectiveness of information system and program security controls to an agency’s success 
in achieving its mission. The performance measures development process described in SP 
800-55 will assist agency information security practitioners in establishing a relationship be-
tween information system and program security activities under their purview and the agen-
cy mission, helping to demonstrate the value of information security to their organization.
Additionally, performance measurements are required to ensure the IT system is in com-
pliance with existing laws, rules, and regulations, such as FISMA.
Factors that must be considered during the development and implementation of an IT 
measurement program are as follows:
• Measures must yield quantifiable information: percentages, averages, and numbers.
• Data that supports the measures needs to be readily obtainable.

538	
11.  Security Component Fundamentals for Assessment
﻿
• Only repeatable information security processes should be considered for measurement.
• Measures must be useful for tracking performance and directing resources.
MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE
• Metric types
• Metrics development and implementation approach
• Metrics development process
Metric Types
• “Am I implementing the tasks for which I am responsible?”
• “How efficiently or effectively am I accomplishing those tasks?”
• “What impact are those tasks having on the mission?”
Metrics Development Process
The place of information security metrics within a larger organizational context demon-
strates that information security metrics can be used to progressively measure implementa-
tion, efficiency, effectiveness, and the business impact of information security activities within 
organizations or for specific systems.
The information security metrics development process consists of two major activities:
1.	 Identifying and defining the current information security program
2.	 Developing and selecting specific metrics to measure implementation, efficiency, effec-
tiveness, and the impact of the security controls
The process steps do not need to be sequential. Rather, the process illustrated in the follow-
ing diagram provides a framework for thinking about metrics and aids in identifying metrics 
to be developed for each system. The type of metric depends on where the system is within 
its life cycle and on the maturity of the information system security program. This framework 
facilitates tailoring metrics to a specific organization and to the different stakeholder groups 
present within each organization.
Phases 5, 6, and 7 involve developing metrics that measure process implementation, effec-
tiveness and efficiency, and mission impact, respectively. The specific aspect of information 
security that metrics will focus on at any given point will depend on information security 
program maturity. Implementation evidence, required to prove higher levels of effectiveness,  
will change from establishing existence of policy and procedures to quantifying implemen-
tation of these policies and procedures, then to quantifying results of implementation of  
policies and procedures, and ultimately to identifying the impact of implementation on the 
organization’s mission.
Based on existing policies and procedures, the universe of possible metrics can be prohibi-
tively large; therefore, agencies should prioritize metrics to ensure that the final set selected 
for initial implementation has the following attributes:

	
Measures of performance	
539
﻿
1.	 Facilitates improvement of high-priority security control implementation. High priority 
may be defined by the latest Government Accountability Office (GAO) or Inspector Gen-
eral (IG) reports, results of a risk assessment, or an internal organizational goal.
2.	 Uses data that can realistically be obtained from existing processes and data repositories.
3.	 Measures processes that already exist and are relatively stable. Measuring nonexistent or 
unstable processes will not provide meaningful information about security performance 
and will therefore not be useful for targeting specific aspects of performance. On the 
other hand, attempting such measurement may not be entirely useless, because such a 
metric will certainly produce poor results and will therefore identify an area that needs 
improvement.
Metrics can be derived from existing data sources, including security certification and 
accreditation, security assessments, POAM, incident statistics, and agency-initiated or 
independent reviews. Agencies may decide to use a weighting scale to differentiate the 
importance of selected metrics and to ensure that the results accurately reflect existing secu-
rity program priorities. This process would involve assigning values to each metric based on 
the importance of a metric in the context of the overall security program. Metrics weighting 
should be based on the overall risk mitigation goals, is likely to reflect higher criticality of 
department-level initiatives versus smaller-scale initiatives, and is a useful tool that facilitates 
integration of information security into the departmental capital planning process.
A phased approach may be required to identify short-, mid-, and long-term metrics in 
which the implementation time frame depends on a combination of system-level effective-
ness, metric priority, data availability, and process stability. Once applicable metrics that 
contain the qualities described above are identified, they will need to be documented with 

540

﻿
supporting detail, including frequency of data collection, data source, formula for calculation, 
implementation evidence for measured activity, and a guide for metric data interpretation. 
Other information about each metric can be defined based on an organization’s processing 
and business requirements.
Metrics Program Implementation
• Prepare for data collection.
• Collect data and analyze results.
• Identify corrective actions.
• Develop business case and obtain resources.
• Apply corrective actions.
FEDERAL ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURE
As part of the management criteria for controls and the system under review, the federal 
requirement defined in the Clinger Cohen Act of 1996 requires all systems be included in the 
EA for the agency. This process is identified and delineated in the Federal Enterprise Archi-
tecture (FEA) process as adopted by the federal CIO Council.
The FEA practice adopted three core principles to guide its strategic direction. They are as 
follows:
1.	 Business-driven: The FEA is most useful when it is closely aligned with government strategic 
plans and executive-level direction. Agency mission statements, presidential management 
directives, and agency business owners give direction to each agency’s EA and to the FEA.

	
Federal enterprise architecture	
541
﻿
2.	Proactive and collaborative across the federal government: Adoption of the FEA is 
achieved through active participation by the EA community in its development 
and use. The FEA community is responsible for the development, evolution, and 
adoption of the FEA.
3.	 Architecture improves the effectiveness and efficiency of government information resources: Ar-
chitecture development is an integral part of the capital investment process. No IT invest-
ment should be made without a business-approved architecture.
The FEA consists of a set of interrelated “reference models” designed to facilitate cross-
agency analysis and the identification of duplicative investments, gaps, and opportunities 
for collaboration within and across agencies. Collectively, the reference models comprise a 
framework for describing important elements of the FEA in a common and consistent way.
Through the use of this common framework and vocabulary, IT portfolios can be better 
managed and leveraged across the federal government. This chapter introduces the purposes 
and structures of the five FEA reference models:
1.	 Performance Reference Model (PRM)
2.	 Business Reference Model (BRM)
3.	 Service Component Reference Model (SRM)
4.	 Technical Reference Model (TRM)
5.	 Data Reference Model (DRM)

11.  Security Component Fundamentals for Assessment
﻿
Information protection needs are technology-independent, required capabilities to counter 
threats to the organization through the compromise of information (i.e., loss of confidential-
ity, integrity, or availability).
Information protection needs are derived from the mission/business needs defined by 
the organization, the mission/business processes selected to meet the stated needs, and 
the organizational RM strategy. Information protection needs determine the required se-
curity controls for the organization and the associated information systems supporting the 
mission/business processes. Inherent in defining an organization’s information protection 
needs is an understanding of the level of adverse impact that could result if a compromise 
of information occurs.
The security categorization process is used to make such potential impact determina-
tions, which is related to and feeds the development of the security categorization require-
ments for each system as found in FIPS-199, guided by SP 800-60. These reference the 
process defined in the first step of the Risk Management Framework (RMF) as for in the 
previous chapters.
SYSTEM AND SERVICES ACQUISITION (SA)
From OMB Budget Circular A-11, the Exhibit 300 is the capture mechanism for all of the 
analyses and activities required for full internal review (e.g., IRB, CIO). More importantly, 
Exhibit 300 is the document that OMB uses to assess investments and ultimately make fund-
ing decisions, and therefore should be leveraged by agencies to clearly demonstrate the need 
for life cycle and annual funding requests. Following selection into the agency’s IT portfolio, 
the agency aggregates Exhibit 300s into the Exhibit 53. The Exhibit 53 provides an overview 
of the agency’s entire IT portfolio by listing every IT investment, life cycle, and budget-year 
cost information.
Exhibit 300s are companions to an agency’s Exhibit 53. Exhibit 300s and the Exhibit 53, 
together with the agency’s EA program, define how to manage the IT Capital Planning and 
Control Process. Exhibit 53A is a tool for reporting the funding of the portfolio of all IT invest-
ments within a department while Exhibit 300A is a tool for detailed justifications of major 
“IT investments.” Exhibit 300B is for the management of the execution of those investments 
through their project life cycle and into their useful life in production.
By integrating the disciplines of architecture, investment management, and project im-
plementation, these programs provide the foundation for sound IT management practices, 
end-to-end governance of IT capital assets, and the alignment of IT investments with an 
agency’s strategic goals. As architecture-driven IT investments are funded in the “invest“ 
(development/acquisition) phase, they move forward into the implementation phase where 
system development life-cycle processes are followed and actual versus planned outputs, 
schedule, and operational performance expenditures are tracked utilizing performance-
based management processes.

SECURITY SERVICES LIFE CYCLE
SP 800-14, Generally Accepted Principles and Practices for Securing Information Technology Sys-
tems, provides a foundation on which organizations can establish and review IT security pro-
grams. The eight Generally Accepted System Security Principles in SP 800-14 are designed to 
provide the public or private sector audience with an organization-level perspective when 
creating new systems, practices, or policies.
General Considerations for Security Services
• Strategic/mission
• Budgetary/funding
• Technical/architectural
• Organizational
• Personnel
• Policy/process

544	
11.  Security Component Fundamentals for Assessment
﻿
To facilitate identification and review of these considerations, security program managers 
may use a set of questions when considering security products for their programs.
1.	 Identify the user community.
2.	 Define the relationship between the security product and the organization’s mission.
3.	 Identify data sensitivity.
4.	 Identify an organization’s security requirements.
5.	 Review security plan.
6.	 Review policies and procedures.
7.	 Identify operational issues such as daily operation, maintenance, and training.
This then leads to the assessor reviewing the acquisition criteria for various security com-
ponents, services, and equipment along with the documentation, contract requirements, and 
the varied support design reports and analyses to ensure there are considerations defined for 
selecting the information security products and services from the following viewpoints:
• Organizational
• Product
• Vendor
• Security checklists for IT products
• Organizational conflict of interest
INFORMATION SECURITY AND EXTERNAL PARTIES
The security of the organization’s information and information processing facilities that 
are accessed, processed, communicated to, or managed by external parties should be main-
tained, and should not be reduced by the introduction of external-party products or services. 
Any access to the organization’s information processing facilities and processing and com-
munication of information by external parties should be controlled. Where there is a business 
need for working with external parties that may require access to the organization’s informa-
tion and information processing facilities, or in obtaining or providing a product and service 
from or to an external party, a risk assessment should be carried out to determine security 
implications and control requirements. Controls should be agreed to and defined in an agree-
ment with the external party.
These external party arrangements can include:
• Service providers, such as internet service providers (ISPs), network providers, telephone 
services, and maintenance and support services
• Managed security services
• Customers
• Outsourcing facilities and/or operations, for example, IT systems, data collection 
services, and call center operations
• Management and business consultants, and auditors
• Developers and suppliers, for example, of software products and IT systems
• Cleaning, catering, and other outsourced support services
• Temporary personnel, student placement, and other casual short-term appointments

	
PL – planning family and family plans	
545
﻿
CA – SECURITY ASSESSMENT AND AUTHORIZATION
This is the control family for the RMF and its implementation. So an assessor will review 
and identify all the components of the RMF, the identities of the key roles and the people as-
signed those roles, the process functions, and the key organizational documents which the 
agency has produced to support these RMF processes as identified in the previous chapters 
of this book and in SP 800-37, rev. 1.
PL – PLANNING FAMILY AND FAMILY PLANS
The assessor must ensure the organization plans and coordinates security-related activities 
affecting the information system before conducting such activities in order to reduce the im-
pact on organizational operations (i.e., mission, functions, image, and reputation), organiza-
tional assets, and individuals. Security-related activities include, for example, security assess-
ments, audits, system hardware and software maintenance, and contingency plan testing/
exercises. Organizational advance planning and coordination includes both emergency and 
nonemergency (i.e., planned or nonurgent unplanned) situations.
This process is documented in the System Security Plan (SSP) which will include the orga-
nizational rules of behavior for each user of the system under review and the system hard-
ware and software inventory.
System Security Plan
The security plan contains sufficient information (including specification of parameters for 
assignment and selection statements in security controls either explicitly or by reference) to 
enable an implementation that is unambiguously compliant with the intent of the plan and a 
subsequent determination of risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other 
organizations, and the nation if the plan is implemented as intended.
Rules of Behavior
These establishes and makes readily available to all information system users the rules that 
describe their responsibilities and expected behavior with regard to information and informa-
tion system usage, and receives signed acknowledgment from users indicating that they have 
read, understand, and agree to abide by the rules of behavior, before authorizing access to 
information and the information system.
Information Security Hardware
The organization:
1.	 Develops an information security architecture for the information system that:
a.	 Describes the overall philosophy, requirements, and approach to be taken with regard 
to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of organizational information

546	
11.  Security Component Fundamentals for Assessment
﻿
b.	Describes how the information security architecture is integrated into and supports 
the EA
c.	 Describes any information security assumptions about, and dependencies on, external 
services
2.	 Reviews and updates the information security architecture periodically to reflect updates 
in the EA
RA – RISK ASSESSMENT FAMILY
Risk Management
• RM is the process of balancing the risk associated with organizational or business 
activities with an adequate level of control that will enable the business to meet its 
mission and/or objectives.
• RM is the identification, assessment, and prioritization of risk followed by coordinated 
and economical application of resources to minimize, monitor, and control the 
probability and/or impact of adverse events or to maximize the realization of 
opportunities.
Holistically, RM covers all concepts and processes affiliated with managing risk, including 
the systematic application of management policies, procedures, and practices; the tasks of 
communicating, consulting, and establishing the context; and identifying, analyzing, evaluat-
ing, treating, monitoring, and reviewing risk.
As an assessor, one area to always focus on during the review of the policy and procedural 
documentation, as well as during the key personnel interviews, is the area of responsibility 
versus accountability. These are typically defined as follows:
• Responsibility: Belongs to those who must ensure that the activities are completed 
successfully
• Accountability: Applies to those who either own the required resources or have the 
authority to approve the execution and/or accept the outcome of an activity within 
specific RM processes
The risk factors formula is usually a good place to start the review of risks and how they 
are viewed and treated within the organization. The formula is relatively straightforward 
for the organization to use and can be a key element to the organizational risk posture as the 
assessor reviews and interviews the various management staff during the assessment. The 
formula is as follows: risk = T × V × $ × C, where C = likelihood × impact. Here:
1.	 T = threats to the organization
2.	 V = vulnerabilities within the organization
3.	 $ = assets being protected
4.	 C = consequences of risk
The risk assessment family of controls provides areas of focus for the organization and the 
assessor to review and update their security posture on an ongoing basis throughout the life 
cycle of the system under review.

	
RA – risk assessment family

﻿
Security Categorization
• A clearly defined authorization boundary is a prerequisite for an effective security 
categorization. Security categorization describes the potential adverse impacts to 
organizational operations, organizational assets, and individuals should the information and 
information system be comprised through a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability.
• The organization conducts the security categorization process as an organization-wide 
activity with the involvement of the chief information officer, senior information security 
officer, information system owner, mission owners, and information owners/stewards. 
The organization also considers potential adverse impacts to other organizations and, 
in accordance with the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and Homeland Security Presidential 
Directives, potential national-level adverse impacts in categorizing the information 
system. The security categorization process facilitates the creation of an inventory 
of information assets, and, in conjunction with configuration management (CM)-8, a 
mapping to the information system components where the information is processed, 
stored, and transmitted.
Risk and Vulnerability Assessments
• A clearly defined authorization boundary is a prerequisite for an effective risk 
assessment. Risk assessments take into account vulnerabilities, threat sources, and 
security controls planned or in place to determine the level of residual risk posed to 
organization. They also take into account risk posed to organizational operations, 
organizational assets, or individuals from external parties (e.g., service providers, 
contractors operating information systems on behalf of the organization, individuals 
accessing organizational information systems, outsourcing entities).
• In accordance with OMB policy and related e-authentication initiatives, authentication 
of public users accessing federal information systems may also be required to protect 
nonpublic or privacy-related information. As such, organizational assessments of 
risk also address public access to federal information systems. The General Services 
Administration provides tools supporting that portion of the risk assessment dealing 
with public access to federal information systems.

548	
11.  Security Component Fundamentals for Assessment
﻿
• Risk assessments (either formal or informal) can be conducted by organizations at 
various steps in the RMF including information system categorization, security control 
selection, security control implementation, security control assessment, information 
system authorization, and security control monitoring.
• RA-3 is a noteworthy security control in that the control must be partially implemented 
prior to the implementation of other controls in order to complete the first two steps in 
the RMF. Risk assessments can play an important role in the security control selection 
process during the application of tailoring guidance for security control baselines and 
when considering supplementing the tailored baselines with additional security controls 
or control enhancements.
RA-5 Vulnerability Scanning
• The security categorization of the information system guides the frequency and 
comprehensiveness of the vulnerability scans. Vulnerability analysis for custom software 
and applications may require additional, more specialized techniques and approaches 
(e.g., web-based application scanners, source code reviews, source code analyzers).
• Vulnerability scanning includes scanning for specific functions, ports, protocols, and 
services that should not be accessible to users or devices and for improperly configured 
or incorrectly operating information flow mechanisms.
• The organization considers using tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common 
Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that use the Open 
Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to test for the presence of vulnerabilities.
• The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) and the National Vulnerability Database 
(NVD) are also excellent sources for vulnerability information. In addition, security 
control assessments such as red team exercises are another source of potential 
vulnerabilities for which to scan.
The assessor then evaluates the organizational risk tolerance process, usually based on the 
guidance from SP 800-39 and implemented through the RMF process defined in SP 800-37, 
rev. 1, for overall treatments of risk within the organization as found through the implementa-
tion of the security controls on the system under review. He or she, the assessor, then reviews 
what is important to the agency and the operations by determining the critical success factors 
from the management perspective.
CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS TO INFORMATION SECURITY 
MANAGEMENT
• Managers and employees within an organization often tend to consider information 
security as a secondary priority if compared with their own efficiency or effectiveness 
matters, because these have a direct and material impact on the outcome of their work.
• For this reason, a strong commitment and support by the senior management on security 
training is needed, over and above the aforementioned role concerning the information 
security policy.
• Management must demonstrate a commitment to security by clearly approving and 
supporting formal security awareness and training (AT). This may require special 

	
Operational security controls key concepts	
549
﻿
management-level training, since security is not necessarily a part of management 
expertise. The security training for different functions within the organization needs to 
be customized to address specific security needs. Different functions have different levels 
of risk. Application developers need technical security training, whereas management 
requires training that will show the linkage between information security management 
and the needs of the organization.
• A second vital point is that a professional risk-based approach must be used 
systematically to identify sensitive and critical information resources and to ensure that 
there is a clear understanding of threats and risks. Thereafter, appropriate risk assessment 
activities should be undertaken to mitigate unacceptable risks and ensure that residual 
risks are at an acceptable level.
OPERATIONAL AREAS OF CONSIDERATION
There are many areas which the assessor needs to consider when evaluating and testing 
the various operation controls installed on the systems under test as shown below in the list-
ing of the families of controls. The starting point for most of these areas is the user. The user 
of the system is often, as I teach in my classes, both the first line of defense and the first line 
of offense with respect to security on the system. So the first area of operational controls to 
review would be the security awareness, training, and education section.
OPERATIONAL SECURITY CONTROLS KEY CONCEPTS
• AT
• CM
• Contingency planning (CP)
• Incident response (IR)
• Maintenance (MA)
• Media protection (MP)
• Physical and environmental protection (PE)
• Personnel security (PS)
• System and information integrity (SI)
Awareness and Training
With the three areas of awareness, training, and education typically defined in an organi-
zational context by the personnel or human resources department, it is important to focus on 
the areas of security training being provided to the organization. Concentrate the assessing 
efforts on the four groups of students for the training. These groups are as follows:
1.	 End users
2.	 System administrators – elevated privilege users
3.	 Security personnel
4.	 Executives – senior management

550	
11.  Security Component Fundamentals for Assessment
﻿
Each of these groups has unique security training requirements and we need to ensure 
these are being addressed by the organization in its training and awareness program. Keep in 
mind that in several industrial verticals, these training requirements are mandated by either 
statutory or regulatory requirements, such as the DOD 8570 Workforce regulatory guidance 
and the end user training requirement found in the Computer Security Act from 1987.
NIST has developed two Special Publications on training of users and support personnel: SP 
800-50, Building an Information Technology Security Awareness and Training Program, published in 
October 2003; and SP 800-16, A Role-Based Model for Federal Information Technology/Cyber Security 
Training – third and final draft version from March 2014. Each of these publications provides 
detailed and explicit information on training and security awareness educational efforts for 
users, system administrators, security personnel, and executive-level managers.
A successful IT security program consists of: 1) developing IT security policy that reflects business needs 
tempered by known risks; 2) informing users of their IT security responsibilities, as documented in agency 
security policy and procedures; and 3) establishing processes for monitoring and reviewing the program.
Security awareness and training should be focused on the organization’s entire user population. Manage-
ment should set the example for proper IT security behavior within an organization. An awareness program 
should begin with an effort that can be deployed and implemented in various ways and is aimed at all levels of 
the organization including senior and executive managers. The effectiveness of this effort will usually determine 
the effectiveness of the awareness and training program. This is also true for a successful IT security program.
An awareness and training program is crucial in that it is the vehicle for disseminating information that 
users, including managers; need in order to do their jobs. In the case of an IT security program, it is the vehicle 
to be used to communicate security requirements across the enterprise.
An effective IT security awareness and training program explains proper rules of behavior for the use 
of agency IT systems and information. The program communicates IT security policies and procedures that 
need to be followed. This must precede and lay the basis for any sanctions imposed due to noncompliance. 
Users first should be informed of the expectations. Accountability must be derived from a fully informed, 
well-trained, and aware workforce.3
Learning is a continuum; it starts with awareness, builds to training, and evolves into edu-
cation. The basic construct for this continuum is shown as follows and is found in SP 800-16 
and SP 800-50:
Awareness
Security awareness efforts are designed to change behavior or reinforce good security 
practices. Awareness is defined in NIST Special Publication 800-16 as follows: “Awareness is 
not training. The purpose of awareness presentations is simply to focus attention on security. 
Awareness presentations are intended to allow individuals to recognize IT security concerns 
and respond accordingly. In awareness activities, the learner is the recipient of information, 
whereas the learner in a training environment has a more active role. Awareness relies on 
reaching broad audiences with attractive packaging techniques. Training is more formal, hav-
ing a goal of building knowledge and skills to facilitate the job performance.”
An example of a topic for an awareness session (or awareness material to be distributed) is 
virus protection. The subject can simply and briefly be addressed by describing what a virus 
is, what can happen if a virus infects a user’s system, what the user should do to protect the 
system, and what the user should do if a virus is discovered.
3SP 800-50, p. 7.

551
﻿
Training
Training is defined in NIST Special Publication 800-16 as follows: “The ‘Training’ level of 
the learning continuum strives to produce relevant and needed security skills and compe-
tencies by practitioners of functional specialties other than IT security (e.g., management, 
systems design and development, acquisition, auditing).” The most significant difference be-
tween training and awareness is that training seeks to teach skills, which allow a person to 
perform a specific function, while awareness seeks to focus an individual’s attention on an 
issue or set of issues. The skills acquired during training are built upon the awareness foun-
dation, in particular, upon the security basics and literacy material. A training curriculum 
must not necessarily lead to a formal degree from an institution of higher learning; however, 
a training course may contain much of the same material found in a course that a college or 
university includes in a certificate or degree program.
An example of training is an IT security course for system administrators, which should 
address in detail the management controls, operational controls, and technical controls that 
should be implemented. Management controls include policy, IT security PM, RM, and life-
cycle security. Operational controls include personnel and user issues, CP, incident handling, 
AT, computer support and operations, and physical and environmental security issues. Tech-
nical controls include identification and authentication (IA), logical Access Controls (ACs), 
audit trails, and cryptography.
Education
Education is defined in NIST Special Publication 800-16 as follows: “The ‘Education’ level 
integrates all of the security skills and competencies of the various functional specialties into 

552	
11.  Security Component Fundamentals for Assessment
﻿
a common body of knowledge, adds a multidisciplinary study of concepts, issues, and prin-
ciples (technological and social), and strives to produce IT security specialists and profession-
als capable of vision and pro-active response.”
An example of education is a degree program at a college or university. Some people take 
a course or several courses to develop or enhance their skills in a particular discipline. This is 
training as opposed to education. Many colleges and universities offer certificate programs, 
wherein a student may take two, six, or eight classes, for example, in a related discipline, and 
is awarded a certificate on completion. Often, these certificate programs are conducted as a 
joint effort between schools and software or hardware vendors. These programs are more 
characteristic of training than education. Those responsible for security training need to as-
sess both types of programs and decide which one better addresses identified needs.4
Configuration Management
One of the major areas of focus for any assessor is system changes and CM. There have 
been many occurrences I have reviewed wherein the development team and the operations 
team supporting systems have instituted upgrades and changes to system which altered or 
removed security components with no security review or sign-off on the validity or viability 
of the change. I have personally seen where the end users requested a change to a process-
ing system to speed up the processing time and the development staff accomplished this 
through removing the required encryption on the transactional data, and it was approved 
and installed. The security staff had no idea this change was installed until they scanned the 
system and found multiple errors in the FIPS-140 and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) areas where 
the encryption processing had been removed.
Security CM involves the systems, the hardware and software inventories, the changes 
to systems, and their interchange with the users on a daily basis. Each change has a security 
component and all reviews and evaluations of system changes require security checks, con-
figuration reviews, and component evaluations to ensure all the currently installed security 
controls are maintained and not altered by the proposed change. If a control is modified by 
the change, detailed engineering and operational examination is needed to make the system 
safe and secure if the change is approved and installed. All of this activity, usually under the 
control of the Configuration Control section of the organization, should be defined and docu-
mented throughout the system life cycle of the system under review.
NIST SP 800-128, Guide for Security-Focused Configuration Management of Information Systems, 
published in August 2011, provides organizations and assessors with many areas of focus and 
guidance for security CM actions and activities. It starts out by saying: “An information system 
is composed of many components4 that can be interconnected in a multitude of arrangements 
to meet a variety of business, mission, and information security ds. How these information 
system components are networked, configured, and managed is critical in providing adequate 
information security and supporting an organization’s risk management process.
An information system is typically in a constant state of change in response to new, 
enhanced, corrected, or updated hardware and software capabilities, patches for correcting 
software flaws and other errors to existing components, new security threats, changing

business functions, etc. Implementing information system changes almost always results in 
some adjustment to the system configuration. To ensure that the required adjustments to the 
system configuration do not adversely affect the security of the information system or the 
organization from operation of the information system, a well-defined configuration manage-
ment process that integrates information security is needed.
Organizations apply configuration management (CM) for establishing baselines and for 
tracking, controlling, and managing many aspects of business development and operation 
(e.g., products, services, manufacturing, business processes, and information technology). 
Organizations with a robust and effective CM process need to consider information security 
implications with respect to the development and operation of information systems including 
hardware, software, applications, and documentation. Effective CM of information systems 
requires the integration of the management of secure configurations into the organizational 
CM process or processes. For this reason, this document assumes that information security is 
an integral part of an organization’s overall CM process; however, the focus of this document 
is on implementation of the information system security aspects of CM, and as such the term 
security-focused configuration management (SecCM) is used to emphasize the concentration on 
information security. Though both IT business application functions and security-focused 
practices are expected to be integrated as a single process, SecCM in this context is defined as 
the management and control of configurations for information systems to enable security and 
facilitate the management of information security risk.”5
Configuration management has been applied to a broad range of products and systems in subject areas 
such as automobiles, pharmaceuticals, and information systems. Some basic terms associated with the con-
figuration management discipline are briefly explained below.
• Configuration Management (CM) comprises a collection of activities focused on establishing and maintain-
ing the integrity of products and systems, through control of the processes for initializing, changing, and 
monitoring the configurations of those products and systems.
• A Configuration Item (CI) is an identifiable part of a system (e.g., hardware, software, firmware, documenta-
tion, or a combination thereof) that is a discrete target of configuration control processes.
• A Baseline Configuration is a set of specifications for a system, or CI within a system, that has been formally 
reviewed and agreed on at a given point in time, and which can be changed only through change control 
procedures. The baseline configuration is used as a basis for future builds, releases, and/or changes.
• A Configuration Management Plan (CM Plan) is a comprehensive description of the roles, responsibilities, 
policies, and procedures that apply when managing the configuration of products and systems. The basic 
parts of a CM Plan include:
• Configuration Control Board (CCB) – Establishment of and charter for a group of qualified people with re-
sponsibility for the process of controlling and approving changes throughout the development and opera-
tional lifecycle of products and systems; may also be referred to as a change control board;
• Configuration Item Identification – methodology for selecting and naming configuration items that need to 
be placed under CM;
• Configuration Change Control – process for managing updates to the baseline configurations for the configu-
ration items; and
• Configuration Monitoring – process for assessing or testing the level of compliance with the established 
baseline configuration and mechanisms for reporting on the configuration status of items placed under CM.
The configuration of an information system is a representation of the system’s components, how each 
component is configured, and how the components are connected or arranged to implement the information

system. The possible conditions in which an information system or system component can be arranged affect 
the security posture of the information system. The activities involved in managing the configuration of an 
information system include development of a configuration management plan, establishment of a configura-
tion control board, development of a methodology for configuration item identification, establishment of the 
baseline configuration, development of a configuration change control process, and development of a process 
for configuration monitoring and reporting.6
The Phases of Security-Focused Configuration Management
Here are the four defined steps for security CM as found in SP 800-128:
6SP 800-128, p. 5–6.

	
Operational security controls key concepts

﻿
A.	 Planning As a part of planning, the scope or applicability of SecCM processes are identified. Planning 
includes developing policy and procedures to incorporate SecCM into existing information technology 
and security programs, and then disseminating the policy throughout the organization. Policy addresses 
areas such as the implementation of SecCM plans, integration into existing security program plans, 
Configuration Control Boards (CCBs), configuration change control processes, tools and technology, the 
use of common secure configurations (A common secure configuration is a recognized, standardized, 
and established benchmark (e.g., National Checklist Program, DISA STIGs, etc.) that stipulates specific 
secure configuration settings for a given IT platform.) and baseline configurations, monitoring, and 
metrics for compliance with established SecCM policy and procedures. It is typically more cost-effective 
to develop and implement a SecCM plan, policies, procedures, and associated SecCM tools at the orga-
nizational level.
B.	 Identifying & Implementing Configurations After the planning and preparation activities are completed, 
a secure baseline configuration for the information system is developed, reviewed, approved, and imple-
mented. The approved baseline configuration for an information system and associated components rep-
resents the most secure state consistent with operational requirements and constraints. For a typical infor-
mation system, the secure baseline may address configuration settings, software loads, patch levels, how 
the information system is physically or logically arranged, how various security controls are implemented, 
and documentation. Where possible, automation is used to enable interoperability of tools and uniformity 
of baseline configurations across the information system.
C.	 Controlling Configuration Changes In this phase of SecCM, the emphasis is put on the management of 
change to maintain the secure, approved baseline of the information system. Through the use of SecCM 
practices, organizations ensure that changes are formally identified, proposed, reviewed, analyzed for se-
curity impact, tested, and approved prior to implementation. As part of the configuration change control 
effort, organizations can employ a variety of access restrictions for change including access controls, pro-
cess automation, abstract layers, change windows, and verification and audit activities to limit unauthor-
ized and/or undocumented changes to the information system.
D.	 Monitoring Monitoring activities are used as the mechanism within SecCM to validate that the informa-
tion system is adhering to organizational policies, procedures, and the approved secure baseline configu-
ration. Planning and implementing secure configurations and then controlling configuration change is 
usually not sufficient to ensure that an information system which was once secure will remain secure. 
Monitoring identifies undiscovered/undocumented system components, misconfigurations, vulnerabili-
ties, and unauthorized changes, all of which, if not addressed, can expose organizations to increased risk. 
Using automated tools helps organizations to efficiently identify when the information system is not con-
sistent with the approved baseline configuration and when remediation actions are necessary. In addition, 
the use of automated tools often facilitates situational awareness and the documentation of deviations 
from the baseline configuration.7
Each area of CM is addressed and covered by security controls identified in SP 800-53 CM 
family of controls. These areas for assessor focus include:
1.	 CM Policy and Procedures – CM 1
2.	 CM Plan – CM 1 and CM 9
3.	 Configuration Control Board – CM 3
4.	 Component Inventory – CM 8
5.	 Configuration Items – CM 3
6.	 Secure Configurations – CM 6 and CM 7
7.	 Minimum Security Baseline Configuration – CM 2
8.	 Configuration Change Control – CM 3 and CM 5
9.	 Security Impact Analysis – CM 4
10.	 Configuration Monitoring – all CM controls

Contingency Planning
Information systems are vital elements in most mission/business processes. Because in-
formation system resources are so essential to an organization’s success, it is critical that 
identified services provided by these systems are able to operate effectively without ex-
cessive interruption. CP supports this requirement by establishing thorough plans, pro-
cedures, and technical measures that can enable a system to be recovered as quickly and 
effectively as possible following a service disruption. It is unique to each system, providing 
preventive measures, recovery strategies, and technical considerations appropriate to the 
system’s information confidentiality, integrity, and availability requirements and the sys-
tem impact level.
Evaluating a recovery and preparedness process for a system, an organization or an ap-
plication can involve many areas of technology, operations, and the personnel identified 
throughout an organization. There are many focal points of concern which require analysis 
and attention of the assessor. As the major area for the controls related to the security objec-
tive of availability, CP has become a focal point for assessors to determine the commitment 
of the organization’s senior management to the security of their operational systems and 
applications.
Under Federal Continuity Directive (FCD)-1 and FCD-2 all federal information systems 
require a contingency plan for recovery and restoration efforts. Additional guidance is pro-
vided by NIST is SP 800-34 and templates available on the csrc.nist.gov website.
Information system CP represents a broad scope of activities designed to sustain and 
recover critical system services following an emergency event. Information system CP fits 
into a much broader security and emergency management effort that includes organiza-
tional and business process continuity, disaster recovery planning, and incident manage-
ment. Ultimately, an organization would use a suite of plans to properly prepare response, 
recovery, and continuity activities for disruptions affecting the organization’s information 
systems, mission/business processes, personnel, and the facility. Because there is an in-
herent relationship between an information system and the mission/business process it 
supports, there must be coordination between each plan during development and updates 
to ensure that recovery strategies and supporting resources neither negate each other nor 
duplicate efforts.
Continuity and contingency planning are critical components of emergency management and organiza-
tional resilience but are often confused in their use. Continuity planning normally applies to the mission/
business itself; it concerns the ability to continue critical functions and processes during and after an emer-
gency event. Contingency planning normally applies to information systems, and provides the steps needed 
to recover the operation of all or part of designated information systems at an existing or new location in an 
emergency. Cyber Incident Response Planning is a type of plan that normally focuses on detection, response, and 
recovery to a computer security incident or event.8

Seven Steps to Contingency Planning as Defined in SP 800-34
SP 800-34, rev. 1, provides instructions, recommendations, and considerations for federal 
information system CP. CP refers to interim measures to recover information system services 
after a disruption. Interim measures may include relocation of information systems and op-
erations to an alternate site, recovery of information system functions using alternate equip-
ment, or performance of information system functions using manual methods. This guide 
addresses specific CP recommendations for three platform types and provides strategies and 
techniques common to all systems:
• Client/server systems
• Telecommunications systems
• Mainframe systems

﻿
This guide defines the following seven-step CP process that an organization may apply to 
develop and maintain a viable CP program for their information systems. These seven progres-
sive steps are designed to be integrated into each stage of the system development life cycle:
1.	 Develop the CP policy statement. A formal policy provides the authority and guidance nec-
essary to develop an effective contingency plan.
2.	 Conduct the business impact analysis (BIA). The BIA helps identify and prioritize 
information systems and components critical to supporting the organization’s mission/
business processes.
3.	 Identify preventive controls. Measures taken to reduce the effects of system disruptions can 
increase system availability and reduce contingency life-cycle costs.
4.	 Create contingency strategies. Thorough recovery strategies ensure that the system may be 
recovered quickly and effectively following a disruption.
5.	 Develop an information system contingency plan. The contingency plan should contain 
detailed guidance and procedures for restoring a damaged system unique to the system’s 
security impact level and recovery requirements.
6.	 Ensure plan testing, training, and exercises. Testing validates recovery capabilities, whereas 
training prepares recovery personnel for plan activation and exercising the plan 
identifies planning gaps; combined, the activities improve plan effectiveness and overall 
organization preparedness.
7.	 Ensure plan maintenance. The plan should be a living document that is updated regularly 
to remain current with system enhancements and organizational changes.
The assessor should be looking for multiple areas of focus which the organization has ap-
plied in its CP activities. SP 800-34 provides the agencies and organizations the guidance to 
conduct these events and the assessor gathers the evidence to ensure these events have been 
conducted in accordance with these guidelines.

11.  Security Component Fundamentals for Assessment
﻿
Key points to review and assess include:
1.	 The CP policy statement:
a.	 Policy should define the organization’s overall contingency objectives and establish 
the organizational framework and responsibilities for system CP.
b.	To be successful, senior management, most likely the CIO, must support a contingency 
program and be included in the process to develop the program policy.
c.	 The policy must reflect the FIPS-199 impact levels and the contingency controls that 
each impact level establishes. Key policy elements are as follows:
-	 Roles and responsibilities
-	 Scope as applies to common platform types and organization functions (i.e., 
telecommunications, legal, media relations) subject to CP
-	 Resource requirements
-	 Training requirements
-	 Exercise and testing schedules
-	 Plan maintenance schedule
-	 Minimum frequency of backups and storage of backup media
2.	 The ISCPs must be written in coordination with other plans associated with each target 
system as part of organization-wide resilience strategy. Such plans include the following:
a.	 Information SSPs
b.	Facility-level plans, such as the OEP and DRP
c.	 MEF support such as the COOP plan
d.	Organization-level plans, such as CIP plans
BIA Requirements
The BIA purpose is to correlate the system with the critical mission/business processes and services pro-
vided, and based on that information, characterize the consequences of a disruption. The ISCP Coordinator 
can use the BIA results to determine contingency planning requirements and priorities. Results from the BIA 
should be appropriately incorporated into the analysis and strategy development efforts for the organiza-
tion’s COOP, BCPs, and DRP.
Three steps are typically involved in accomplishing the BIA:
1.	 Determine mission/business processes and recovery criticality. Mission/Business processes supported 
by the system are identified and the impact of a system disruption to those processes is determined along 
with outage impacts and estimated downtime. The downtime should reflect the maximum time that an 
organization can tolerate while still maintaining the mission.
2.	 Identify resource requirements. Realistic recovery efforts require a thorough evaluation of the resources 
required to resume mission/business processes and related interdependencies as quickly as possible. Ex-
amples of resources that should be identified include facilities, personnel, equipment, software, data files, 
system components, and vital records.
3.	 Identify recovery priorities for system resources. Based upon the results from the previous activities, 
system resources can be linked more clearly to critical mission/business processes and functions. Priority 
levels can be established for sequencing recovery activities and resources.
The sample BIA process and data collection activities, outlined in this section and illustrated below, consist-
ing of a representative information system with multiple components (servers), are designed to help the ISCP 
Coordinator streamline and focus contingency plan development activities to achieve a more effective plan.9

Numbers that Matter – Critical Recovery Numbers
The assessor always needs to keep the numbers that matter to the business objectives and 
mission when reviewing the CP and COOP documentation, evidence, and testing results. So, 
what are these numbers?
• Maximum tolerable downtime (MTD)
• Recovery time objective (RTO)
• Recovery point objective (RPO)
The ISCP Coordinator should next analyze the supported mission/business processes and with the pro-
cess owners, leadership and business managers determine the acceptable downtime if a given process or 
specific system data were disrupted or otherwise unavailable. Downtime can be identified in several ways.
• Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD). The MTD represents the total amount of time the system owner/
authorizing official is willing to accept for a mission/business process outage or disruption and includes 
all impact considerations. Determining MTD is important because it could leave contingency planners with 
imprecise direction on (1) selection of an appropriate recovery method, and (2) the depth of detail which 
will be required when developing recovery procedures, including their scope and content.
• Recovery Time Objective (RTO). RTO defines the maximum amount of time that a system resource can 
remain unavailable before there is an unacceptable impact on other system resources, supported mission/
business processes, and the MTD. Determining the information system resource RTO is important for se-
lecting appropriate technologies that are best suited for meeting the MTD. When it is not feasible to im-
mediately meet the RTO and the MTD is inflexible, a Plan of Action and Milestone should be initiated to 
document the situation and plan for its mitigation.
• Recovery Point Objective (RPO). The RPO represents the point in time, prior to a disruption or system 
outage, to which mission/business process data can be recovered (given the most recent backup copy of the 
data) after an outage. Unlike RTO, RPO is not considered as part of MTD. Rather, it is a factor of how much 
data loss the mission/business process can tolerate during the recovery process.
Because the RTO must ensure that the MTD is not exceeded, the RTO must normally be shorter than the 
MTD. For example, a system outage may prevent a particular process from being completed, and because it 
takes time to reprocess the data, that additional processing time must be added to the RTO to stay within the 
time limit established by the MTD.10
10SP 800-34, p. 17.

Example:
COOP VERSUS ISCP – THE BASIC FACTS
Recovery times
• COOP functions must be sustained within 12 h and for up to 30 days from an alternate site; 
ISCP RTOs are determined by the system-based BIA.
• Information systems that support COOP functions must have an RTO that meets COOP 
requirements.
• Information systems that do not support COOP functions do not require alternate sites 
as part of the ISCP recovery strategy, but may have an alternate site security control 
requirement.

As an assessor, the job here is to evaluate and assess whether the numbers identified above 
do three things:
1.	 Provide the appropriate level of recovery in relation to the security categorization of the 
system under review

563
﻿
2.	 Provide the level of recovery expected and documented in the BIA for the system under 
review
3.	 Provide the level of recovery expected by the end using organization and their financial 
commitment
The various recovery processes and procedures need to be verified and validated, which is 
typically done through the use of testing and exercises conducted in accordance with SP 800-82.
SP 800-82, Guide to Test, Training, and Exercise Programs for IT Plans  
and Capabilities
Organizations have IT plans in place, such as contingency and computer security IR plans, 
so that they can respond to and manage adverse situations involving IT. These plans should 
be maintained in a state of readiness, which should include having personnel trained to fulfill 
their roles and responsibilities within a plan, having plans exercised to validate their con-
tent, and having systems and system components tested to ensure their operability in an 
operational environment specified in a plan. These three types of events can be carried out 
efficiently and effectively through the development and implementation of a test, training, 
and exercise (TT&E) program. Organizations should consider having such a program in place 
because tests, training, and exercises are so closely related. For example, exercises and tests 
offer different ways of identifying deficiencies in IT plans, procedures, and training.11
TEST
Tests are evaluation tools that use quantifiable metrics to validate the operability of an IT 
system or system component in an operational environment specified in an IT plan. For ex-
ample, an organization could test if call tree cascades can be executed within prescribed time 
limits; another test would be removing power from a system or system component. A test 
is conducted in as close to an operational environment as possible; if feasible, an actual test 
of the components or systems used to conduct daily operations for the organization should 
be used. The scope of testing can range from individual system components or systems to 
comprehensive tests of all systems and components that support an IT plan. Tests often focus 
on recovery and backup operations; however, testing varies depending on the goal of the test 
and its relation to a specific IT plan.
TRAINING
Training, in this recovery context, refers only to informing personnel of their roles and re-
sponsibilities within a particular IT plan and teaching them skills related to those roles and re-
sponsibilities, thereby preparing them for participation in exercises, tests, and actual emergency 
situations related to the IT plan. Training personnel on their roles and responsibilities before an 
exercise or test event is typically split between a presentation on their roles and responsibilities 
and activities that allow personnel to demonstrate their understanding of the subject matter.
EXERCISES
An exercise is a simulation of an emergency designed to validate the viability of one or 
more aspects of an IT plan. In an exercise, personnel with roles and responsibilities in a

﻿
particular IT plan meet to validate the content of a plan through discussion of their roles and 
their responses to emergency situations, execution of responses in a simulated operational 
environment, or other means of validating responses that does not involve using the actual 
operational environment. Exercises are scenario-driven, such as a power failure in one of the 
organization’s data centers or a fire causing certain systems to be damaged, with additional 
situations often being presented during the course of an exercise. There are several types of 
exercises, and this publication focuses on the following two types that are widely used in 
TT&E programs by single organizations:
• Tabletop: Tabletop exercises are discussion-based exercises where personnel meet in a 
classroom setting or in breakout groups to discuss their roles during an emergency and 
their responses to a particular emergency situation. A facilitator presents a scenario 
and asks the exercise participants questions related to the scenario, which initiates a 
discussion among the participants of roles, responsibilities, coordination, and decision 
making. A tabletop exercise is discussion-based only and does not involve deploying 
equipment or other resources.
• Functional: Functional exercises allow personnel to validate their operational readiness for 
emergencies by performing their duties in a simulated operational environment. They are 
designed to exercise the roles and responsibilities of specific team members, procedures, 
and assets involved in one or more functional aspects of a plan (e.g., communications, 
emergency notifications, IT equipment setup). Functional exercises vary in complexity 
and scope, from validating specific aspects of a plan to full-scale exercises that address all 
plan elements. They allow staff to execute their roles and responsibilities as they would 
in an actual emergency situation, but in a simulated manner.
Contingency Plan Testing
Contingency plan testing always requires special attention for assessors as this is often 
the only way to fully check out the alternative operations and support efforts that the orga-
nization has placed into operations but only activates when they are required to do so. The 
following table reflects the areas of CP controls to evaluate and obtain evidence and proof of 
accomplishment for testing of the various parts of the system or organization’s contingency 
plans and COOP preparations:

impact system, the alternate facility should be fully configured 
as defined in CP
CP-9
System backup
Test backup information to verify media reliability and 
information integrity. If high-impact system, use sample 
backup information to validate recovery process and ensure 
backup copies are maintained at alternate storage facility
Now, each of these areas of focus for assessment of the CP controls should be tied into and 
reflected in the system contingency plan and its design efforts as reflected in the following:

Incident Response
The current state of the security of systems across the enterprise often requires organiza-
tions to develop and conduct IR activities due to breaches, malware infections, “phishing” 
events, and outright external attacks. The state of the cybercrime and hacking communities 
has developed dramatically over the past few years and now includes “hack-in-a-box” and 
fully developed malicious software development efforts including formal version controls, 
automated delivery channels, testing against known antivirus signatures, and malware as a 
service (MAAS) cloud-based delivery mechanisms. The goals of any IR effort are as follows:
• Detect incidents quickly.
• Diagnose incidents accurately.
• Manage incidents properly.
• Contain and minimize damage.
• Restore affected services.
• Determine root causes.
• Implement improvements to prevent recurrence.
• Document and report.
The purpose of IR is to manage and respond to unexpected disruptive events with the ob-
jective of controlling impacts within acceptable levels. These events can be technical, such as 
attacks mounted on the network via viruses, denial of service, or system intrusion, or they 
can be the result of mistakes, accidents, or system or process failure. Disruptions can also be 
caused by a variety of physical events such as theft of proprietary information, social engineer-
ing, lost or stolen backup tapes or laptops, environmental conditions such as floods, fires, or 
earthquakes, and so forth. Any type of incident that can significantly affect the organization’s 
ability to operate or that may cause damage must be considered by the information security 
manager and will normally be a part of incident management and response capabilities.
The US government has long recognized the need and requirements for computer IR and, 
as a result, has developed many documented resources and organizations for IR to include 
the US-Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT), various DOD CERT organizations, 
joint ventures between various governmental agencies, incident handling guides, procedures 
and techniques, and the NIST SP 800-61.
SP 800-61 – Computer Security Incident Handling Guide
As the introduction at the beginning of SP 800-61 says: “Computer security incident re-
sponse has become an important component of information technology (IT) programs. 
Cybersecurity-related attacks have become not only more numerous and diverse but also 
more damaging and disruptive. New types of security-related incidents emerge frequently. 
Preventive activities based on the results of risk assessments can lower the number of inci-
dents, but not all incidents can be prevented. An incident response capability is therefore 
necessary for rapidly detecting incidents, minimizing loss and destruction, mitigating the 
weaknesses that were exploited, and restoring IT services. To that end, this publication pro-
vides guidelines for incident handling, particularly for analyzing incident-related data and 
determining the appropriate response to each incident. The guidelines can be followed inde-
pendently of particular hardware platforms, operating systems, protocols, or applications.

Because performing incident response effectively is a complex undertaking, establishing 
a successful incident response capability requires substantial planning and resources. Con-
tinually monitoring for attacks is essential. Establishing clear procedures for prioritizing the 
handling of incidents is critical, as is implementing effective methods of collecting, analyz-
ing, and reporting data. It is also vital to build relationships and establish suitable means of 
communication with other internal groups (e.g., human resources, legal) and with external 
groups (e.g., other incident response teams, law enforcement).”12
Incident Handling
The incident response process has several phases. The initial phase involves establishing and training an 
incident response team, and acquiring the necessary tools and resources. During preparation, the organiza-
tion also attempts to limit the number of incidents that will occur by selecting and implementing a set of 
controls based on the results of risk assessments. However, residual risk will inevitably persist after controls 
are implemented. Detection of security breaches is thus necessary to alert the organization whenever incidents 
occur. In keeping with the severity of the incident, the organization can mitigate the impact of the incident 
by containing it and ultimately recovering from it. During this phase, activity often cycles back to detection 
and analysis—for example, to see if additional hosts are infected by malware while eradicating a malware 
incident. After the incident is adequately handled, the organization issues a report that details the cause and 
cost of the incident and the steps the organization should take to prevent future incidents.13
PREPARATION
IR methodologies typically emphasize preparation – not only establishing an IR capabil-
ity so that the organization is ready to respond to incidents but also preventing incidents by 
ensuring that systems, networks, and applications are sufficiently secure. Although the IR 
team is not typically responsible for incident prevention, it is fundamental to the success of 
IR programs.
As an assessor of IR capacity and incident handling activities, it is important to understand 
the process itself is often chaotic and can appear haphazard when the response is active. One 
of the critical areas to focus on during the review is the documented and defined training for 
the responders, as well as the organizational policies and procedures for IR. Each of these 
areas helps determine the success or failure of the response team, their interactions with the 
rest of the organization, and ultimately the minimization of the impact of the incident on the 
organization, its people, and its mission.

DETECTION AND ANALYSIS
For many organizations, the most challenging part of the incident response process is accurately detecting 
and assessing possible incidents—determining whether an incident has occurred and, if so, the type, extent, 
and magnitude of the problem. What makes this so challenging is a combination of three factors:
• Incidents may be detected through many different means, with varying levels of detail and fidelity. Auto-
mated detection capabilities include network-based and host-based IDPSs, antivirus software, and log ana-
lyzers. Incidents may also be detected through manual means, such as problems reported by users. Some 
incidents have overt signs that can be easily detected, whereas others are almost impossible to detect.
• The volume of potential signs of incidents is typically high—for example, it is not uncommon for an orga-
nization to receive thousands or even millions of intrusion detection sensor alerts per day.
• Deep, specialized technical knowledge and extensive experience are necessary for proper and efficient anal-
ysis of incident-related data.
Signs of an incident fall into one of two categories: precursors and indicators. A precursor is a sign that an 
incident may occur in the future. An indicator is a sign that an incident may have occurred or may be occur-
ring now.
Incident detection and analysis would be easy if every precursor or indicator were guaranteed to be ac-
curate; unfortunately, this is not the case. For example, user-provided indicators such as a complaint of a 
server being unavailable are often incorrect. Intrusion detection systems may produce false positives—incor-
rect indicators. These examples demonstrate what makes incident detection and analysis so difficult: each 
indicator ideally should be evaluated to determine if it is legitimate. Making matters worse, the total number 
of indicators may be thousands or millions a day. Finding the real security incidents that occurred out of all 
the indicators can be a daunting task.
Even if an indicator is accurate, it does not necessarily mean that an incident has occurred. Some indica-
tors, such as a server crash or modification of critical files, could happen for several reasons other than a secu-
rity incident, including human error. Given the occurrence of indicators, however, it is reasonable to suspect 
that an incident might be occurring and to act accordingly. Determining whether a particular event is actually 
an incident is sometimes a matter of judgment. It may be necessary to collaborate with other technical and 
information security personnel to make a decision. In many instances, a situation should be handled the same 
way regardless of whether it is security related. For example, if an organization is losing Internet connectivity 
every 12 hours and no one knows the cause, the staff would want to resolve the problem just as quickly and 
would use the same resources to diagnose the problem, regardless of its cause.14
CONTAINMENT, ERADICATION, AND RECOVERY
Containment is important before an incident overwhelms resources or increases damage. 
Most incidents require containment, so that is an important consideration early in the course 
of handling each incident. Containment provides time for developing a tailored remedia-
tion strategy. An essential part of containment is decision making (e.g., shut down a system, 
disconnect it from a network, or disable certain functions). Such decisions are much easier to 
make if there are predetermined strategies and procedures for containing the incident. Or-
ganizations should define acceptable risks in dealing with incidents and develop strategies 
accordingly.
Containment strategies vary based on the type of incident. For example, the strategy for 
containing an email-borne malware infection is quite different from that for a network-based 
DDoS attack. Organizations should create separate containment strategies for each major in-
cident type, with criteria documented clearly to facilitate decision making.15

﻿
After an incident has been contained, eradication may be necessary to eliminate components of the inci-
dent, such as deleting malware and disabling breached user accounts, as well as identifying and mitigating 
all vulnerabilities that were exploited. During eradication, it is important to identify all affected hosts within 
the organization so that they can be remediated. For some incidents, eradication is either not necessary or is 
performed during recovery.
In recovery, administrators restore systems to normal operation, confirm that the systems are functioning 
normally, and (if applicable) remediate vulnerabilities to prevent similar incidents. Recovery may involve 
such actions as restoring systems from clean backups, rebuilding systems from scratch, replacing compro-
mised files with clean versions, installing patches, changing passwords, and tightening network perimeter se-
curity (e.g., firewall rulesets, boundary router access control lists). Higher levels of system logging or network 
monitoring are often part of the recovery process. Once a resource is successfully attacked, it is often attacked 
again, or other resources within the organization are attacked in a similar manner.
Eradication and recovery should be done in a phased approach so that remediation steps are prioritized. 
For large-scale incidents, recovery may take months; the intent of the early phases should be to increase the 
overall security with relatively quick (days to weeks) high value changes to prevent future incidents. The 
later phases should focus on longer-term changes (e.g., infrastructure changes) and ongoing work to keep the 
enterprise as secure as possible.16
POSTINCIDENT ACTIVITY
One of the most important parts of incident response is also the most often omitted: learning and improv-
ing. Each incident response team should evolve to reflect new threats, improved technology, and lessons 
learned. Holding a “lessons learned” meeting with all involved parties after a major incident, and optionally 
periodically after lesser incidents as resources permit, can be extremely helpful in improving security mea-
sures and the incident handling process itself. Multiple incidents can be covered in a single lessons learned 
meeting. This meeting provides a chance to achieve closure with respect to an incident by reviewing what 
occurred, what was done to intervene, and how well intervention worked.
Small incidents need limited post-incident analysis, with the exception of incidents performed through new 
attack methods that are of widespread concern and interest. After serious attacks have occurred, it is usually 
worthwhile to hold post-mortem meetings that cross team and organizational boundaries to provide a mecha-
nism for information sharing. The primary consideration in holding such meetings is ensuring that the right 
people are involved. Not only is it important to invite people who have been involved in the incident that is being 
analyzed, but also it is wise to consider who should be invited for the purpose of facilitating future cooperation.17
As an IR assessor and evaluator, you will be looking for the required training and exercise 
documentation for each responder on the team. The policies for IR, handling, notification, and 
board review all need to be identified, reviewed, and assessed. The supporting procedures for 
handling and response efforts all need review and correlation to the policies, the security con-
trols for IR from SP 800-53 and the actual IR plan for each system as it is reviewed and assessed.
Federal Agency Incident Categories
To clearly communicate incidents and events (any observable occurrence in a network or system) through-
out the Federal Government and supported organizations, it is necessary for the government incident re-
sponse teams to adopt a common set of terms and relationships between those terms. All elements of the 
Federal Government should use a common taxonomy.
Below please find a high level set of concepts and descriptions to enable improved communications among 
and between agencies. The taxonomy below does not replace discipline (technical, operational, intelligence) 
that needs to occur to defend federal agency computers/networks, but provides a common platform to ex-
ecute the US-CERT mission. US-CERT and the federal civilian agencies are to utilize the following incident 
and event categories and reporting timeframe criteria as the federal agency reporting taxonomy.

Now, as of October 1, 2014 US-CERT posted a new taxonomy and methodology for 
reporting of incidents. US-CERT posted the following information and table for the new re-
quirements, which are required to be used after September 1, 2015:
Please use the table below to identify the impact of the incident. Incidents may affect multiple types of 
data; therefore, D/As may select multiple options when identifying the information impact. The security cat-
egorization of federal information and information systems must be determined in accordance with Federal 
Information Processing Standards (FIPS) Publication 199. Specific thresholds for loss of service availability 
(i.e., all, subset, loss of efficiency) must be defined by the reporting organization.19
Impact Classifications
Impact Description
Functional Impact
HIGH - Organization has lost the ability to provide all critical services to all 
system users.
MEDIUM - Organization has lost the ability to provide a critical service to a 
subset of system users.
LOW - Organization has experienced a loss of efficiency, but can still provide all 
critical services to all users with minimal effect on performance.
NONE - Organization has experienced no loss in ability to provide all services to 
all users.
Information Impact
CLASSIFIED - The confidentiality of classified information [5] was 
compromised.
PROPRIETARY [6] - The confidentiality of unclassified proprietary information, 
such as protected critical infrastructure information (PCII), intellectual property, 
or trade secrets was compromised.
PRIVACY - The confidentiality of personally identifiable information [7] (PII) of 
personal health information (PHI) was compromised.
INTEGRITY - The necessary integrity of information was modified without 
authorization.
NONE - No information was exfiltrated. modified, deleted, or otherwise 
compromised.
Recoverability
REGULAR - Time to recovery is predictable with existing resources.
SUPPLEMENTED - Time to recovery is predictable with additional resources.
EXTENDED - Time to recovery is unpredictable; additional resources and 
outside help are needed.
NOT RECOVERABLE - Recovery from the incident is not possible (e.g., 
sensitive data exfiltrated and posted publicly).
NOT APPLICABLE - Incident does not require recovery.
To minimize damage from security incidents and to recover and to learn from such inci-
dents, a formal IR capability should be established. The organization and management of an 
IR capability should be coordinated or centralized with the establishment of key roles and 
responsibilities. In establishing this process, employees and contractors are made aware of 
procedures for reporting the different types of incidents that might have an impact on the 
security of organizational assets. Incidents occur because vulnerabilities are not addressed

properly. Ideally, an organizational computer security incident response team (CSIRT) or 
CERT should be formulated with clear lines of reporting, and responsibilities for standby 
support should be established. An assessor should ensure that the CSIRT is actively involved 
with users to assist them in the mitigation of risks arising from security failures and also to 
prevent security incidents.
The assessor needs to check for, evaluate, and assess the following areas of IR:
A.	 Organizations must create, provision, and operate a formal incident response capability. Federal law re-
quires Federal agencies to report incidents to the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team 
(US-CERT) office within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).
	
The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) requires Federal agencies to establish incident 
response capabilities. Each Federal civilian agency must designate a primary and secondary point of con-
tact (POC) with US-CERT and report all incidents consistent with the agency’s incident response policy. 
Each agency is responsible for determining how to fulfill these requirements. Establishing an incident 
response capability should include the following actions:
1.	 Creating an incident response policy and plan
2.	 Developing procedures for performing incident handling and reporting
3.	 Setting guidelines for communicating with outside parties regarding incidents
4.	 Selecting a team structure and staffing model
5.	 Establishing relationships and lines of communication between the incident response team and other 
groups, both internal (e.g., legal department) and external (e.g., law enforcement agencies)
6.	 Determining what services the incident response team should provide
7.	 Staffing and training the incident response team.
B.	 Organizations should reduce the frequency of incidents by effectively securing networks, systems, and 
applications.
	
Preventing problems is often less costly and more effective than reacting to them after they occur. Thus, 
incident prevention is an important complement to an incident response capability. If security controls are 
insufficient, high volumes of incidents may occur. This could overwhelm the resources and capacity for 
response, which would result in delayed or incomplete recovery and possibly more extensive damage and 
longer periods of service and data unavailability. Incident handling can be performed more effectively if 
organizations complement their incident response capability with adequate resources to actively maintain 
the security of networks, systems, and applications. This includes training IT staff on complying with the 
organization’s security standards and making users aware of policies and procedures regarding appropri-
ate use of networks, systems, and applications.
C.	 Organizations should document their guidelines for interactions with other organizations regarding 
incidents.
	
During incident handling, the organization will need to communicate with outside parties, such as other 
incident response teams, law enforcement, the media, vendors, and victim organizations. Because these 
communications often need to occur quickly, organizations should predetermine communication guide-
lines so that only the appropriate information is shared with the right parties.
D.	 Organizations should be generally prepared to handle any incident but should focus on being pre-
pared to handle incidents that use common attack vectors.
	
Incidents can occur in countless ways, so it is infeasible to develop step-by-step instructions for handling 
every incident. This publication defines several types of incidents, based on common attack vectors; these 
categories are not intended to provide definitive classification for incidents, but rather to be used as a basis 
for defining more specific handling procedures. Different types of incidents merit different response strate-
gies. The attack vectors are:
• External/Removable Media: An attack executed from removable media (e.g., flash drive, CD) or a peripheral 
device.
• Attrition: An attack that employs brute force methods to compromise, degrade, or destroy systems, net-
works, or services.

	
Operational security controls key concepts	
573
﻿
• Web: An attack executed from a website or web-based application.
• Email: An attack executed via an email message or attachment.
• Improper Usage: Any incident resulting from violation of an organization’s acceptable usage policies by 
an authorized user, excluding the above categories.
• Loss or Theft of Equipment: The loss or theft of a computing device or media used by the organization, 
such as a laptop or smartphone.
• Other: An attack that does not fit into any of the other categories.
E.	 Organizations should emphasize the importance of incident detection and analysis throughout the 
organization.
	
In an organization, millions of possible signs of incidents may occur each day, recorded mainly by logging 
and computer security software. Automation is needed to perform an initial analysis of the data and select 
events of interest for human review. Event correlation software can be of great value in automating the 
analysis process. However, the effectiveness of the process depends on the quality of the data that goes 
into it. Organizations should establish logging standards and procedures to ensure that adequate informa-
tion is collected by logs and security software and that the data is reviewed regularly.
F.	 Organizations should create written guidelines for prioritizing incidents.
	
Prioritizing the handling of individual incidents is a critical decision point in the incident response pro-
cess. Effective information sharing can help an organization identify situations that are of greater severity 
and demand immediate attention. Incidents should be prioritized based on the relevant factors, such as 
the functional impact of the incident (e.g., current and likely future negative impact to business functions), 
the information impact of the incident (e.g., effect on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the 
organization’s information), and the recoverability from the incident (e.g., the time and types of resources 
that must be spent on recovering from the incident).
G.	 Organizations should use the lessons learned process to gain value from incidents.
	
After a major incident has been handled, the organization should hold a “lessons learned” meeting to 
review the effectiveness of the incident handling process and identify necessary improvements to existing 
security controls and practices. Lessons learned meetings can also be held periodically for lesser incidents 
as time and resources permit. The information accumulated from all lessons learned meetings should be 
used to identify and correct systemic weaknesses and deficiencies in policies and procedures. Follow-up 
reports generated for each resolved incident can be important not only for evidentiary purposes but also 
for reference in handling future incidents and in training new team members.20
System Maintenance
As an assessor of federal information systems, what do you need to know about operations 
and maintenance (O&M) of information systems?
In the maintenance area for systems, focus on the policies and procedures for the maintenance 
activities of the assigned personnel first. Then look at the maintenance records, logs, and reports 
of the maintenance staff. Check these records against the requests and help desk tickets to ensure 
the maintenance is requested legitimately, performed appropriately, and completed successfully.
Areas for review include the following parts of the Maintenance and Support program of 
the agency:
• Nonlocal maintenance = remote access/maintenance:
• FIPS-201-1 Common Identification – Personal Identity Verification (PIV; IA)
•	 SP 800-63 e-authentication (IA)
•	 FIPS-197 Advance Encryption Standard (systems and communications protection (SC))
•	 FIPS-140-2 Cryptography Standard
•	 SP 80-88 Media Sanitization (MP)

• Planning for failure of equipment:
•	 Mean time between failures (MTBF)
•	 Mean time to repair (MTTR)
Encryption Standards for Use and Review in Federal Systems
FIPS-140-1 was developed by a government and industry working group composed of both 
operators and vendors. The working group identified requirements for four security levels 
for cryptographic modules to provide for a wide spectrum of data sensitivity (e.g., low-value 
administrative data, million dollar funds transfers, and life-protecting data) and a diversity of 
application environments (e.g., a guarded facility, an office, and a completely unprotected lo-
cation). Four security levels are specified for each of 11 requirement areas. Each security level 
offers an increase in security over the preceding level. These four increasing levels of security 
allow cost-effective solutions that are appropriate for different degrees of data sensitivity and 
different application environments. FIPS-140-2 incorporates changes in applicable standards 
and technology since the development of FIPS-140-1 as well as changes that are based on 
comments received from the vendor, laboratory, and user communities. The basic level guid-
ance from the FIPS is provided as follows:
1.	 Security Level 1: Security Level 1 provides the lowest level of security. Basic security 
requirements are specified for a cryptographic module (e.g., at least one approved 
algorithm or approved security function shall be used). No specific physical security 
mechanisms are required in a Security Level 1 cryptographic module beyond the basic 
requirement for production-grade components. An example of a Security Level 1 cryp-
tographic module is a personal computer (PC) encryption board.
	
	 Security Level 1 allows the software and firmware components of a cryptographic 
module to be executed on a general-purpose computing system using an unevaluated 
operating system. Such implementations may be appropriate for some low-level 
security applications when other controls, such as physical security, network security, 
and administrative procedures, are limited or nonexistent. The implementation of 
cryptographic software may be more cost-effective than corresponding hardware-based 
mechanisms, enabling organizations to select from alternative cryptographic solutions to 
meet lower-level security requirements.
2.	 Security Level 2: Security Level 2 enhances the physical security mechanisms of a Security 
Level 1 cryptographic module by adding the requirement for tamper-evidence, which 
includes the use of tamper-evident coatings or seals or for pick-resistant locks on 
removable covers or doors of the module. Tamper-evident coatings or seals are placed 
on a cryptographic module so that the coating or seal must be broken to attain physical 
access to the plaintext cryptographic keys and critical security parameters (CSPs) within 
the module. Tamper-evident seals or pick-resistant locks are placed on covers or doors to 
protect against unauthorized physical access.
	
	 Security Level 2 requires, at a minimum, role-based authentication in which a 
cryptographic module authenticates the authorization of an operator to assume a specific 
role and perform a corresponding set of services.
	
	 Security Level 2 allows the software and firmware components of a cryptographic module 
to be executed on a general-purpose computing system using an operating system that:

	
Operational security controls key concepts	
575
﻿
a.	 Meets the functional requirements specified in the Common Criteria (CC) Protection 
Profiles (PPs)
b.	Is evaluated at the CC evaluation assurance level EAL2 (or higher)
	
	 An equivalent evaluated trusted operating system may be used. A trusted operating 
system provides a level of trust so that cryptographic modules executing on general-
purpose computing platforms are comparable to cryptographic modules implemented 
using dedicated hardware systems.
3.	 Security Level 3: In addition to the tamper-evident physical security mechanisms required 
at Security Level 2, Security Level 3 attempts to prevent the intruder from gaining access 
to CSPs held within the cryptographic module. Physical security mechanisms required 
at Security Level 3 are intended to have a high probability of detecting and responding 
to attempts at physical access, use, or modification of the cryptographic module. The 
physical security mechanisms may include the use of strong enclosures and tamper 
detection/response circuitry that zeroizes all plaintext CSPs when the removable covers/
doors of the cryptographic module are opened.
	
	 Security Level 3 requires identity-based authentication mechanisms, enhancing the 
security provided by the role-based authentication mechanisms specified for Security 
Level 2. A cryptographic module authenticates the identity of an operator and verifies 
that the identified operator is authorized to assume a specific role and perform a 
corresponding set of services.
	
	 Security Level 3 requires the entry or output of plaintext CSPs (including the entry or 
output of plaintext CSPs using split knowledge procedures) be performed using ports 
that are physically separated from other ports, or interfaces that are logically separated 
using a trusted path from other interfaces. Plaintext CSPs may be entered into or output 
from the cryptographic module in encrypted form (in which case they may travel 
through enclosing or intervening systems).
	
	 Security Level 3 allows the software and firmware components of a cryptographic 
module to be executed on a general-purpose computing system using an operating 
system that:
a.	 Meets the functional requirements specified in the PPs listed in Annex B with the 
additional functional requirement of a trusted path (FTP_TRP.1)
b.	Is evaluated at the CC evaluation assurance level EAL3 (or higher) with the additional 
assurance requirement of an informal Target of Evaluation (TOE) Security Policy 
Model (ADV_SPM.1)
	
	 An equivalent evaluated trusted operating system may be used. The implementation of 
a trusted path protects plaintext CSPs and the software and firmware components of the 
cryptographic module from other untrusted software or firmware that may be executing 
on the system.
4.	 Security Level 4: Security Level 4 provides the highest level of security defined in this 
standard. At this security level, the physical security mechanisms provide a complete 
envelope of protection around the cryptographic module with the intent of detecting 
and responding to all unauthorized attempts at physical access. Penetration of the 
cryptographic module enclosure from any direction has a very high probability of being 
detected, resulting in the immediate zeroization of all plaintext CSPs. Security Level 4 
cryptographic modules are useful for operation in physically unprotected environments.

576	
11.  Security Component Fundamentals for Assessment
﻿
	
	 Security Level 4 also protects a cryptographic module against a security compromise 
due to environmental conditions or fluctuations outside of the module’s normal 
operating ranges for voltage and temperature. Intentional excursions beyond the normal 
operating ranges may be used by an attacker to thwart a cryptographic module’s 
defenses. A cryptographic module is required either to include special environmental 
protection features designed to detect fluctuations and zeroize CSPs or to undergo 
rigorous environmental failure testing to provide a reasonable assurance that the module 
will not be affected by fluctuations outside of the normal operating range in a manner 
that can compromise the security of the module.
	
	 Security Level 4 allows the software and firmware components of a cryptographic module 
to be executed on a general-purpose computing system using an operating system that:
a.	 Meets the functional requirements specified for Security Level 3
b.	Is evaluated at the CC evaluation assurance level EAL4 (or higher)
	
An equivalent evaluated trusted operating system may be used.
5.	 Advanced Encryption Standard: FIPS-197, Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), specifies 
the Rijndael algorithm, a symmetric block cipher that can process data blocks of 128 bits, 
using cipher keys with lengths of 128, 192, and 256 bits.
	
	 The algorithm may be used with the three different key lengths indicated above, and 
therefore these different “flavors” may be referred to as “AES-128,” “AES-192,” and 
“AES-256.”
Media Protection
• SP 800-88 – sanitization
• SP 800-111 – storage encryption
Media Sanitation
The information security concern regarding information disposal and media sanitization 
resides not in the media but in the recorded information. The issue of media disposal and san-
itization is driven by the information placed intentionally or unintentionally on the media.
Information systems capture, process, and store information using a wide variety of me-
dia. This information is located not only on the intended storage media but also on devices 
used to create, process, or transmit this information. These media may require special dispo-
sition in order to mitigate the risk of unauthorized disclosure of information and to ensure its 
confidentiality. Efficient and effective management of information that is created, processed, 
and stored by an IT system throughout its life, from inception to disposition, is a primary 
concern of an information system owner and the custodian of the data.
With the use of increasingly sophisticated encryption, an attacker wishing to gain access 
to an organization’s sensitive information is forced to look outside the system itself for that 
information. One avenue of attack is the recovery of supposedly deleted data from media. 
These residual data may allow unauthorized individuals to reconstruct data and thereby gain 
access to sensitive information. Sanitization can be used to thwart this attack by ensuring that 
deleted data cannot be easily recovered.
When storage media are transferred, become obsolete, or are no longer usable or required 
by an information system, it is important to ensure that residual magnetic, optical, electrical, 
or other representation of data that has been deleted is not easily recoverable. Sanitization

﻿
refers to the general process of removing data from storage media, such that there is reason-
able assurance that the data may not be easily retrieved and reconstructed.
Information disposition and sanitization decisions occur throughout the system life cycle. 
Critical factors affecting information disposition and media sanitization are decided at the 
start of a system’s development. The initial system requirements should include hardware 
and software specifications as well as interconnections and data flow documents that will as-
sist the system owner in identifying the types of media used in the system.
Types of Media
1.	 Hard copy: Hard copy media is physical representations of information. Paper printouts, 
printer, and facsimile ribbons, drums, and platens are all examples of hard copy media. 
These types of media are often the most uncontrolled. Information tossed into the recycle 
bins and trash containers exposes a significant vulnerability to “dumpster divers,” and 
overcurious employees, risking accidental disclosures.
2.	 Electronic (or soft copy): Electronic media are the bits and bytes contained in hard drives, 
random access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), disks, memory devices, 
phones, mobile computing devices, networking equipment, and many other types.
There are different types of sanitization for each type of media. Media sanitization is di-
vided into four categories in NIST SP 800-88: disposal, clearing, purging, and destroying.
1.	 Disposal is the act of discarding media with no other sanitization considerations. This is 
most often done by paper recycling containing nonconfidential information but may also 
include other media.
2.	 Clearing information is a level of media sanitization that would protect the confidentiality 
of information against a robust keyboard attack. Simple deletion of items would not 
suffice for clearing. Clearing must not allow information to be retrieved by data, disk, or 
file recovery utilities. It must be resistant to keystroke recovery attempts executed from 
standard input devices and from data scavenging tools. For example, overwriting is an 
acceptable method for clearing media.
3.	 Purging information is a media sanitization process that protects the confidentiality of 
information against a laboratory attack. For some media, clearing media would not 
suffice for purging. However, for Advanced Technology Attachment (ATA) disk drives 
manufactured after 2001 (over 15 GB) the terms clearing and purging have converged.

﻿
4.	 Destruction of media is the ultimate form of sanitization. After media are destroyed, they 
cannot be reused as originally intended. Physical destruction can be accomplished using 
a variety of methods, including disintegration, incineration, pulverizing, shredding, and 
melting.
Sanitization and Disposition Decision Flow
Organizations make sanitization decisions that are commensurate with the security catego-
rization of the confidentiality of information contained on their media. The decision process 
is based on the confidentiality of the information, not the type of media. Once organizations 
decide what type of sanitization is best for their individual case, the media type will influence 
the technique used to achieve this sanitization goal.
Storage Encryption Technologies
SP 800-111 provides a high-level overview of the most commonly used options for encrypt-
ing stored information: full disk encryption (FDE), volume and virtual disk encryption, and 
file/folder encryption. It briefly defines each option and explains at a high level how it works.

	
Operational security controls key concepts	
579
﻿
1.	 FDE, also known as whole disk encryption, is the process of encrypting all the data on 
the hard drive used to boot a computer, including the computer’s OS, and permitting 
access to the data only after successful authentication to the FDE product. Most FDE 
products are software-based.
	
	 FDE software works by redirecting a computer’s master boot record (MBR), which is 
a reserved sector on bootable media that determines which software (e.g., OS, utility) 
will be executed when the computer boots from the media. Before FDE software is 
installed onto a computer, the MBR usually points to the computer’s primary OS. When 
FDE software is being used, the computer’s MBR is redirected to a special preboot 
environment (PBE) that controls access to the computer.
	
	 FDE software is most commonly used on desktop and laptop computers. The 
requirement for preboot authentication means that users have to be able to authenticate 
using the most fundamental components of a device, such as a standard keyboard – 
because the OS is not loaded, OS-level drivers are unavailable. For example, a personal 
digital assistant (PDA) or smart phone could not display a keyboard on the screen for 
entering a password because that is an OS-level capability.
2.	 Virtual disk encryption is the process of encrypting a file called a container, which can hold 
many files and folders, and permitting access to the data within the container only after 
proper authentication is provided, at which point the container is typically mounted as a 
virtual disk. Virtual disk encryption is used on all types of end user device storage. The 
container is a single file that resides within a logical volume. Examples of volumes are 
boot, system, and data volumes on a PC, and a Universal Serial Bus (USB) flash drive 
formatted with a single file system.

3.	 Volume encryption is the process of encrypting an entire logical volume and permitting 
access to the data on the volume only after proper authentication is provided. It is most 
often performed on hard drive data volumes and volume-based removable media, such 
as USB flash drives and external hard drives.
	
	 The key difference between volume and virtual disk encryption is that containers are 
portable and volumes are not – a container can be copied from one medium to another, 
with encryption intact. This allows containers to be burned to CDs and DVDs and to 
be used on other media that are not volume-based. Virtual disk encryption also makes 
it trivial to back up sensitive data; the container is simply copied to the backup server 
or media. Another advantage of virtual disk encryption over volume encryption is 
that virtual disk encryption can be used in situations where volume-based removable 
media needs to have both protected and unprotected storage; the volume can be left 
unprotected and a container placed onto the volume for the sensitive information.
4.	 File encryption is the process of encrypting individual files on a storage medium and 
permitting access to the encrypted data only after proper authentication is provided. Folder 
encryption is very similar to file encryption, only it addresses individual folders instead 
of files. Some OSs offer built-in file and/or folder encryption capabilities and many third-
party programs are also available. Although folder encryption and virtual disk encryption 
sound similar – both a folder and a container are intended to contain and protect multiple 
files – there is a difference. A container is a single opaque file, meaning that no one can see 
what files or folders are inside the container until the container is decrypted. File/folder 
encryption is transparent, meaning that anyone with access to the file system can view the 
names and possibly other metadata for the encrypted files and folders, including files and 
folders within encrypted folders, if they are not protected through OS AC features. File/
folder encryption is used on all types of storage for end user devices.
PHYSICAL SECURITY
As an assessor, physical security reviews are usually conducted via “security walk-
throughs” which are inspections of the facilities and their various components. These “walk-
throughs” are just that, walking through the facility looking at the various equipment, 
configurations, electrical panels, HVAC systems, generators, fire suppression systems, and

physical access on doors and rooms. The primary areas for physical ACs to review and in-
spect include:
• Badges
• Memory cards
• Guards
• Keys
• True-floor-to-true-ceiling wall construction, especially in data centers and controlled 
access rooms
• Fences
• Locks
The primary areas to review during inspections for fire safety and suppression systems 
include:
• Building operation
• Building occupancy
• Fire detection equipment such as the various kinds of sensors
• Fire extinguishment, including fire extinguishers and delivery mechanisms for rooms
Reviewing the physical security of the facilities also includes the supporting utilities and 
their delivery. This includes:
• Air-conditioning system
• Electric power distribution
• Heating plants
• Water
• Sewage
• Alternative power and its delivery to the facility
Some of the more critical areas to focus on include looking at the positive flow for both air 
and water such that the flow is out of the room, rather than into the room, and the point of 
delivery of the utilities to the facility – is it secure from tampering or inadvertent accidents?
PERSONNEL SECURITY
The PS component is often overlooked and not reviewed in detail by assessors. This area 
has critical issues in today’s world with insider threats, lack of reviews for new or transfer-
ring employees, as well as dealing with the US government’s requirements for PIV creden-
tials necessary for all users on government systems. Some of the documents and regulations 
which cover this area include:
• 800-73
• 800-76
• 800-78
• 5 CFR 731.106, Designation of Public Trust Positions and Investigative Requirements
• ICD 704, Personnel Security Standards Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI)

﻿
Proper information security practices should be in place to ensure that employees, contrac-
tors, and third-party users understand their responsibilities, and are suitable for the roles they 
are considered for, and to reduce the risk of theft, fraud, or misuse of facilities, specifically:
• Security responsibilities should be addressed prior to employment in adequate job 
descriptions and in terms and conditions of employment.
• All candidates for employment, contractors, and third-party users should be adequately 
screened, especially for sensitive jobs.
• Employees, contractors, and third-party users of information processing facilities should 
sign an agreement on their security roles and responsibilities.
• Security roles and responsibilities of employees, contractors, and third-party users should be 
defined and documented in accordance with the organization’s information security policy.
The basic staffing process is shown below and the assessor should ensure the processes, 
procedures, and organizational policies provide the necessary guidance to the HR staff to ac-
complish these steps in a professional and secure manner throughout the recruitment, hiring, 
and employee life cycle for each and every employee and contractor involved in the govern-
mental support efforts for their agency.
Staffing
Areas for coverage of personnel which the assessor should review include areas in user 
administration such as:
• User account management
• Audit and management reviews
• Detecting unauthorized/illegal activities
• Temporary assignments and in-house transfers
• Termination
•	 Friendly termination
•	 Unfriendly termination

	
System integrity	
583
﻿
Throughout the personnel process which is under review, the assessor should check on all 
of the user activities.
SYSTEM INTEGRITY
Integrity reviews often require an assessor to test a system capability either via automated 
tool employment or through the use of manual scripting efforts. These activities will require 
the assessor to have knowledge and skills in scripting languages and manual test develop-
ment. Automated tool use will need the assessor to have experience in the use of the tool and 
the results expected from the tool. One of the principal ways of automated tool use is through 
employing vulnerability scanners which often can review the system and determine if there 
are configuration errors or misaligned areas of code within the application or the operating 
system. This includes patches for systems as well as code issues.
Patching and flaw remediation are areas of system integrity and system maintenance 
which the assessor should focus on first when testing and evaluating system integrity. Other 
areas are found in the following Special Publications:
• 800-40 – Patching (RA family of controls)
• 800-45 – Email
• 800-83 – Malware
• 800-92 – Logs (audit and accounting (AU) family of controls)
Malware Incident Prevention and Handling
SP 800-83, Guide to Malware Incident Prevention and Handling, provides recommendations for 
improving an organization’s malware incident prevention measures. It also gives extensive 
recommendations for enhancing an organization’s existing IR capability so that it is better 
prepared to handle malware incidents, particularly widespread ones. The recommenda-
tions address several major forms of malware, including viruses, worms, Trojan horses,  
malicious mobile code, blended attacks, spyware tracking cookies, and attacker tools such  
as backdoors and rootkits. The recommendations encompass various transmission mechanisms, 
including network services (e.g., email, web browsing, file sharing) and removable media.
The basic structure of SP 800-83 addresses focal points of interest for the assessor, such as:
• Malware categories
• Malware incident prevention:
•	 Policy
•	 Awareness
• Vulnerability mitigation
•	 Threat mitigation
• Malware IR
Malware Categories
• Viruses:
•	 Compiled viruses

•	 Rootkits
•	 Web browser plug-ins

• Non-malware threats:

This area of security should always be closely looked at and examined by the assessor as it 
is often used by attackers as one major area for exploitation of systems through many areas. 
Often I have found organizations only partially address flaws and remediation efforts and 
leave potential large and major exposures available for attacks to work against successfully.
Email Security – Spam
As the Special Publication, SP 800-45, states in the Executive Summary: “Electronic mail 
(email) is perhaps the most popularly used system for exchanging business information over 
the Internet (or any other computer network). At the most basic level, the email process can 
be divided into two principal components: (1) mail servers, which are hosts that deliver, for-
ward, and store email; and (2) mail clients, which interface with users and allow users to read, 
compose, send, and store email. This document addresses the security issues of mail servers 
and mail clients, including Web-based access to mail.
Mail servers and user workstations running mail clients are frequently targeted by attack-
ers. Because the computing and networking technologies that underlie email are ubiquitous 
and well-understood by many, attackers are able to develop attack methods to exploit secu-
rity weaknesses. Mail servers are also targeted because they (and public Web servers) must 
communicate to some degree with untrusted third parties. Additionally, mail clients have 
been targeted as an effective means of inserting malware into machines and of propagating 
this code to other machines. As a result, mail servers, mail clients, and the network infrastruc-
ture that supports them must be protected.”21
Understanding the email system within the organization requires understanding of the 
various potential attack and exposure areas such as:
21SP 800-45, p. ES-1.

	
System integrity	
585
﻿
• To exchange email with the outside world, a requirement for most organizations, it is allowed through 
organizations’ network perimeter defenses. At a basic level, viruses and other types of malware may be dis-
tributed throughout an organization via email. Increasingly, however, attackers are getting more sophisti-
cated and using email to deliver targeted zero-day attacks in an attempt to compromise users’ workstations 
within the organization’s internal network.
• Given email’s nature of human to human communication, it can be used as a social engineering vehicle. 
Email can allow an attacker to exploit an organization’s users to gather information or get the users to per-
form actions that further an attack.
• Flaws in the mail server application may be used as the means of compromising the underlying server and 
hence the attached network. Examples of this unauthorized access include gaining access to files or folders 
that were not meant to be publicly accessible, and being able to execute commands and/or install software 
on the mail server.
• Denial of service (DoS) attacks may be directed to the mail server or its support network infrastructure, 
denying or hindering valid users from using the mail server.
• Sensitive information on the mail server may be read by unauthorized individuals or changed in an unau-
thorized manner.
• Sensitive information transmitted unencrypted between mail server and client may be intercepted. All 
popular email communication standards default to sending usernames, passwords, and email messages 
unencrypted.
• Information within email messages may be altered at some point between the sender and recipient.
• Malicious entities may gain unauthorized access to resources elsewhere in the organization’s network via 
a successful attack on the mail server. For example, once the mail server is compromised, an attacker could 
retrieve users’ passwords, which may grant the attacker access to other hosts on the organization’s network.
• Malicious entities may attack external organizations from a successful attack on a mail server host.
• Misconfiguration may allow malicious entities to use the organization’s mail server to send email-based 
advertisements (i.e., spam).
• Users may send inappropriate, proprietary, or other sensitive information via email. This could expose the 
organization to legal action.22
The areas for the assessor to review should, therefore, include the following configuration 
items:
• Ensuring that spam cannot be sent from the mail servers they control
• Implementing spam filtering for inbound messages
• Blocking messages from known spam-sending servers
The assessor should examine the mail servers, clients, and organization’s security architec-
ture for the focal points as follows to ensure proper security for email systems:
1.	 Email message signing and encryption standards
2.	 Planning and management of mail servers
3.	 Securing the operating system underlying a mail server
4.	 Mail server application security
5.	 Email content filtering
6.	 Email-specific considerations in the deployment and configuration of network protection 
mechanisms, such as firewalls, routers, switches, and intrusion detection and intrusion 
prevention systems
7.	 Securing mail clients
8.	 Administering the mail server in a secure manner, including backups, security testing, 
and log reviews
22SP 800-45, p. ES1–ES2.

﻿
Each area should be tested for configuration, compliance, and actual security actions when 
dealing with this very sensitive organizational support area of email.
TECHNICAL AREAS OF CONSIDERATION
The common way for validating and verifying the technical controls is to employ auto-
mated testing tools and techniques as found in the NIST SP 800-115 testing guide. There are 
many tools which can be utilized to evaluate the various technical components, equipment, 
and configuration used by the IT staff, network support staff, and the agency. The basic four 
areas of technical controls are as follows:
1.	 AC
2.	 AU
3.	 IA
4.	 SC
We will examine each area and the parts of each with technical focus from an assessment 
perspective as we review the technical components that make up these controls.
ACCESS CONTROL
There are many NIST Special Publications for the various AC methodologies and imple-
mentations. Each one has a specific area of AC that it covers. Here are just some of the SPs 
available for review and reference as the controls are identified, implemented, and evaluated:
• 800-46 (Telework)
• 800-77 (Internet Protocol Security (IPSec))
• 800-113 (SSL)
• 800-114 (External Devices)
• 800-121 (Bluetooth)
• 800-48 (Legacy Wireless)
• 800-97 (802.11i Wireless)
• 800-124 (Cell Phones/PDA)
• OMB M 06-16 (Remote Access)
Logical Access Controls
Logical ACs are the primary means of managing and protecting resources to reduce risks 
to a level acceptable to an organization. They are tools used for identification, authentication, 
authorization, and accountability. They are software components that enforce AC measures 
for systems, programs, processes, and information. The logical ACs can be embedded within 
operating systems, applications, add-on security packages, or database and telecommunica-
tion management systems. In applying management-designed policies and procedures for 
protecting information assets, logical ACs are the primary means of managing and protecting 

	
Access control	
587
﻿
these resources to reduce risks to a level acceptable to an organization. For example, the 
concept of AC relates to managing and controlling access to an organization’s information 
resources residing on host- and network-based computer systems. Assessors need to under-
stand the relationship of logical ACs to management policies and procedures for information 
security. In doing so, assessors should be able to analyze and evaluate a logical AC’s effective-
ness in accomplishing information security objectives.
Inadequate logical ACs increase an organization’s potential for losses resulting from ex-
posures. These exposures can result in minor inconveniences up to a total shutdown of com-
puter functions. Exposures that exist from accidental or intentional exploitation of logical AC 
weaknesses include technical exposures and computer crime.
For assessors to effectively assess logical ACs within the system under review, they first 
need to gain a technical and organizational understanding of the organization’s IT environ-
ment. The purpose of this is to determine which areas from a risk standpoint warrant special 
attention in planning current and future work. This includes reviewing all security layers 
associated with the organization’s IT information system architecture.
These layers are as follows:
• Network layer
• Operating system platform layer
• Database layer
• Application layer
Paths of Logical Access
Access or points of entry to an organization’s information system infrastructure can be 
gained through several avenues. Each avenue is subject to appropriate levels of access secu-
rity. For example, paths of logical access often relate to different levels occurring from either a 
back-end or a front-end interconnected network of systems for internally or externally based 
users. Front-end systems are network-based systems connecting an organization to outside 
untrusted networks, such as corporate websites, where a customer can access the website 
externally in initiating transactions that connect to a proxy server application which in turn 
connects, for example, to a back-end database system in updating a customer database. Front-
end systems can also be internally based in automating business, paper-less processes that tie 
into back-end systems in a similar manner.
General Points of Entry
• General points of entry to either front-end or back-end systems relate to an organization’s 
networking or telecommunications infrastructure in controlling access into their 
information resources (e.g., applications, databases, facilities, networks). The approach 
followed is based on a client–server model where, for example, a large organization 
can literally have thousands of interconnected network servers. Connectivity in this 
environment needs to be controlled through a smaller set of primary domain controlling 
servers, which enable a user to obtain access to specific secondary points of entry (e.g., 
application servers, databases).

588	
11.  Security Component Fundamentals for Assessment
﻿
General modes of access into this infrastructure occur through the following:
• Network connectivity
• Remote access
• Operator console
• Online workstations or terminals
Logical Access Control Software
IT has made it possible for computer systems to store and contain large quantities of sensi-
tive data, increase the capability of sharing resources from one system to another, and permit 
many users to access the system through internet/intranet technologies. All of these factors 
have made organizations’ information system resources more accessible and available any-
time and anywhere.
To protect an organization’s information resources, AC software has become even more 
critical in assuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information resources. The 
purpose of AC software is to prevent unauthorized access and modification to an organization’s 
sensitive data and use of system critical functions.
To achieve this level of control, it is necessary to apply ACs across all layers of an orga-
nization’s information system architecture. This includes networks, platforms or operating 
system, databases, and application systems. Attributes across each commonly include some 
form of IA, access authorization, checking to specific information resources, and logging and 
reporting of user activities.
The greatest degree of protection in applying AC software is at the network and platform/
operating system levels. These layers provide the greatest degree of protection of information 
resources from internal and external users’ unauthorized access. These systems are also re-
ferred to as general support systems, and they make up the primary infrastructure on which 
applications and database systems will reside.
Operating system AC software interfaces with other system software AC programs, such 
as network layer devices (e.g., routers, firewalls), that manage and control external access to 
organizations’ networks. Additionally, operating system AC software interfaces with data-
base and/or application system ACs to protect system libraries and user datasets.
Logical Access Control Software Functionality
1.	 General operating system AC functions include:
a.	 Apply user IA mechanisms.
b.	Restrict log-on IDs to specific terminals/workstations and specific times.
c.	 Establish rules for access to specific information resources (e.g., system-level 
application resources and data).
d.	Create individual accountability and auditability.
e.	 Create or change user profiles.
f.	 Log events.
g.	Log user activities.
h.	Report capabilities.

2.	 Database and/or application-level AC functions include:
a.	 Create or change data files and database profiles.
b.	Verify user authorization at the application and transaction levels.
c.	 Verify user authorization within the application.
d.	Verify user authorization at the field level for changes within a database.
e.	 Verify subsystem authorization for the user at the file level.
f.	 Log database/data communications access activities for monitoring access violations.
Assessing ACs and AC systems:
• Start with obtaining a general understanding of the security risks facing information 
processing, through a review of relevant documentation, inquiry, observation, and risk 
assessment and evaluation techniques.
• Document and evaluate controls over potential access paths into the system to assess 
their adequacy, efficiency, and effectiveness by reviewing appropriate hardware and 
software security features and identifying any deficiencies or redundancies.
• Test controls over access paths to determine whether they are functioning and effective 
by applying appropriate testing techniques.
• Evaluate the AC environment to determine if the control requirements are achieved by 
analyzing test results and other evidence.
• Evaluate the security environment to assess its adequacy by reviewing written policies, 
and observing practices and procedures, and comparing them with appropriate security 
standards or practices and procedures used by other organizations.
• Familiarization with the IT environment:
•	 This is the first step of the evaluation and involves obtaining a clear understanding 
of the technical, managerial, and security environment of the information system 
processing facility. This typically includes interviews, physical walk-throughs, review 
of documents, and risk assessments, as mentioned above in the physical security 
control area.
• Documenting the access paths:
•	 The access path is the logical route an end user takes to access computerized 
information. This starts with a terminal/workstation and typically ends with the data 
being accessed. Along the way, numerous hardware and software components are 
encountered. The assessor should evaluate each component for proper implementation 
and proper physical and logical access security.
• Interviewing systems personnel:
•	 To control and maintain the various components of the access path, as well as the 
operating system and computer mainframe, technical experts often are required. 
These people can be a valuable source of information to the assessor when gaining 
an understanding of security. To determine who these people are, the assessor should 
interview with the IS manager and review organizational charts and job descriptions. 
Key people include the security administrator, network control manager, and systems 
software manager.

11.  Security Component Fundamentals for Assessment
﻿
• Reviewing reports from AC software:
•	 The reporting features of AC software provide the security administrator with the 
opportunity to monitor adherence to security policies. By reviewing a sample of 
security reports, the assessor can determine if enough information is provided to 
support an investigation and if the security administrator is performing an effective 
review of the report.
• Reviewing Application Systems Operations Manual:
•	 An Application Systems Manual should contain documentation on the programs 
that generally are used throughout a data processing installation to support the 
development, implementation, operations, and use of application systems. This 
manual should include information about which platform the application can run on, 
database management systems, compilers, interpreters, telecommunications monitors, 
and other applications that can run with the application.
• Log-on IDs and passwords:
•	 To test confidentiality, the assessor could attempt to guess the password of a sample 
of employees’ log-on IDs (though this is not necessarily a test). This should be done 
discreetly to avoid upsetting employees. The assessor should tour end user and 
programmer work areas looking for passwords taped to the side of terminals or the inside 
of desk drawers, or located in card files. Another source of confidential information is the 
wastebasket. The assessor might consider going through the office wastebasket looking 
for confidential information and passwords. Users could be asked to give their password 
to the assessor. However, unless specifically authorized for a particular situation and 
supported by the security policy, no user should ever disclose his/her password.
• Controls over production resources:
•	 Computer ACs should extend beyond application data and transactions. There are 
numerous high-level utilities, macro or job control libraries, control libraries, and 
system software parameters for which AC should be particularly strong. Access to 
these libraries would provide the ability to bypass other ACs. The assessor should 
work with the system software analyst and operations manager to determine if access 
is on a need-to-know basis for all sensitive production resources. Working with the 
security administrator, the assessor should determine who can access these resources 
and what can be done with this access.
• Logging and reporting of computer access violations:
•	 To test the reporting of access violations, the assessor should attempt to access 
computer transactions or data for which access is not authorized. The attempts should 
be unsuccessful and identified on security reports. This test should be coordinated with 
the data owner and security administrator to avoid violation of security regulations.
• Follow up access violations:
•	 To test the effectiveness and timeliness of the security administrator’s and data 
owner’s response to reported violation attempts, the assessor should select a sample 

	
Access control

﻿
of security reports and look for evidence of follow-up and investigation of access 
violations. If such evidence cannot be found, the assessor should conduct further 
interviews to determine why this situation exists.
• Identification of methods for bypassing security and compensating controls:
•	 This is a technical area of review. As a result, the assessor should work with the system 
software analyst, network manager, operations manager, and security administrator 
to determine ways to bypass security. This typically includes bypass label processing 
(BLP), special system maintenance log-on IDs, operating system exits, installation 
utilities, and I/O devices. Working with the security administrator, the assessor 
should determine who can access these resources and what can be done with this 
access. The assessor should determine if access is on a need-to-know/have basis or if 
compensating detective controls exist.
• Review ACs and password administration:
•	 Ensure password control is active for all accounts and users. Ensure password 
complexity and renewal requirements are enforced for all users and accounts. Ensure 
password criteria for elevated privilege accounts are more complex and longer than 
for standard user accounts as part of Separation of Duties review.
• Restricting and monitoring access:
•	 There should be restrictions and procedures of monitoring access to computer features 
that bypass security. Generally, only system software programmers should have access 
to these features:
-	 BLP: BLP bypasses the computer reading of the file label. Since most AC rules are 
based on file names (labels), this can bypass access security.
-	 System exits: This system software feature permits the user to perform complex 
system maintenance, which may be tailored to a specific environment or company. 
They often exist outside of the computer security system and, thus, are not 
restricted or reported in their use.
-	 Special system log-on IDs: These log-on IDs often are provided with the computer 
by the vendor. The names can be determined easily because they are the same 
for all similar computer systems. Passwords should be changed immediately, on 
installation, to secure the systems.
• Auditing remote access:
•	 Remote use of information resources dramatically improves business productivity, 
but generates control issues and security concerns. In this regard, IS auditors should 
determine that all remote access capabilities used by an organization provide for 
effective security of the organization’s information resources. Remote access security 
controls should be documented and implemented for authorized users operating 
outside of the trusted network environment. In reviewing existing remote access 
architectures, IS auditors should assess remote access points (APs) of entry in 
addressing how many (known/unknown) exist and whether greater centralized 
control of remote APs is needed. IS auditors should also review APs for appropriate

﻿
controls, such as in the use of virtual private networks (VPNs), authentication 
mechanisms, encryption, firewalls, and IDS.
IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION
IA is the process of proving one’s identity. It is the process by which the system obtains 
from a user his/her claimed identity and the credentials needed to authenticate this identity, 
and validates both pieces of information.
LOG-ON IDS AND PASSWORDS
Features of passwords:
• A password should be easy for the user to remember but difficult for a perpetrator to 
guess.
• Initial passwords may be allocated by the security administrator or generated by the 
system itself. When the user logs on for the first time, the system should force a password 
change to improve confidentiality.
• If the wrong password is entered a predefined number of times, typically three, the log-
on ID should be automatically and permanently deactivated (or at least for a significant 
period of time).
Token Devices, One-Time Passwords
A two-factor authentication technique, such as a microprocessor-controlled smart card, 
generates one-time passwords that are good for only one log-on session. Users enter this 
password along with a password they have memorized to gain access to the system. This 
technique involves something you have (a device subject to theft) and something you know 
(a personal identification number). Such devices gain their one-time password status because 
of a unique session characteristic (e.g., ID or time) appended to the password.
Biometrics
Biometric ACs are the best means of authenticating a user’s identity based on a unique, 
measurable attribute or trait for verifying the identity of a human being. This control restricts 
computer access, based on a physical (something you are) or behavioral (something you do) 
characteristic of the user.
Management of Biometrics
Management of biometrics should address effective security for the collection, distribu-
tion, and processing of biometric data.
Management should develop and approve biometric information management and secu-
rity (BIMS) policy. The auditor should use the BIMS policy to gain a better understanding of 
the biometric systems in use.

	
Log-on IDs and passwords	
593
﻿
Single Sign-On (SSO)
Users normally require access to a number of resources during the course of their daily 
routine. For example, users would first log into an operating system and thereafter into vari-
ous applications. For each operating system application or other resource in use, the user 
is required to provide a separate set of credentials to gain access; this results in a situation 
wherein the user’s ability to remember passwords is significantly reduced. This situation also 
increases the chance that a user will write them down on or near their workstation or area of 
work, and thereby increase the risks that a security breach within the organization may occur.
To address this situation, the concept of SSO was developed. SSO can generally be defined 
as the process for consolidating all organization platform-based administration, authentica-
tion, and authorization functions into a single centralized administrative function. This func-
tion would provide the appropriate interfaces to the organization’s information resources, 
which may include:
• Client–server and distributed systems
• Mainframe systems
• Network security including remote access mechanisms
The SSO process begins with the first instance where the user credentials are introduced 
into the organization’s IT computing environment. The information resource or SSO server 
handling this function is referred to as the primary domain. Every other information resource, 
application, or platform that uses those credentials is called a secondary domain.
The authorization process of AC often requires that the system be able to identify and dif-
ferentiate among users. For example, AC is often based on least privilege, which refers to the 
granting to users of only those accesses required to perform their duties.
Access rules (authorization) specify who can access what. Access should be on a docu-
mented need-to-know and need-to-do basis by type of access.
Having computer access does not always mean unrestricted access. Computer access can 
be set to many differing levels. When IS auditors review computer accessibility, they need to 
know what can be done with the access and what is restricted. For example, access restric-
tions at the file level generally include the following:
• Read, inquiry, or copy only
• Write, create, update, or delete only
• Execute only
• A combination of the above
Authentication of an individual’s identity is a fundamental component of physical and 
logical AC processes. When an individual attempts to access security-sensitive buildings, 
computer systems, or data, an AC decision must be made. An accurate determination of iden-
tity is needed to make sound AC decisions.
A wide range of mechanisms is employed to authenticate identity, utilizing various classes 
of identity credentials. For physical access, individual identity has traditionally been authen-
ticated by use of paper or other nonautomated, hand-carried credentials, such as driver’s 
licenses and badges. Access authorization to computers and data has traditionally been au-
thenticated through user-selected passwords. More recently, cryptographic mechanisms and 

594	
11.  Security Component Fundamentals for Assessment
﻿
biometric techniques have been used in physical and logical security applications, replacing 
or supplementing the traditional credentials.
The strength of the authentication that is achieved varies, depending on the type of cre-
dential, the process used to issue the credential, and the authentication mechanism used to 
validate the credential. This document establishes a standard for a PIV system based on se-
cure and reliable forms of identification credentials issued by the federal government to its 
employees and contractors. These credentials are intended to authenticate individuals who 
require access to federally controlled facilities, information systems, and applications.
SYSTEMS AND COMMUNICATIONS PROTECTION
Network Layer Security
There are multiple methods and techniques employed by organizations for deploying and 
enhancing network security. All methods provide differing levels of confidentiality, integ-
rity, and availability depending on their technology, location on the network, and method 
of installation. We will highlight several of these methods to properly review, examine, and 
evaluate each to ensure the use of and actions conducted by these methods are functional, 
operational, and secure. We will start with VPNs, and then discuss wireless networking, IDS, 
encryption, and firewalls.
VPN
A VPN is a virtual network, built on top of existing physical networks, which can provide a 
secure communications mechanism for data and other information transmitted between net-
works. Because a VPN can be used over existing networks, such as the internet, it can facili-
tate the secure transfer of sensitive data across public networks. This is often less expensive 
than alternatives such as dedicated private telecommunications lines between organizations 
or branch offices. We will examine the two most common types of VPNs utilized in today’s 
networks in order to properly assess them: IPSec and SSL-based VPNs. “IPsec has emerged 
as the most commonly used network layer security control for protecting communications, 
while SSL is the most commonly used transport layer security control. Depending on how 
IPsec and SSL are implemented and configured, both can provide any combination of the fol-
lowing types of protection:
• Confidentiality. IPsec and SSL can ensure that data cannot be read by unauthorized 
parties. This is accomplished by encrypting data using a cryptographic algorithm and a 
secret key—a value known only to the two parties exchanging data. The data can only be 
decrypted by someone who has the secret key.
• Integrity. IPsec and SSL can determine if data has been changed (intentionally or 
unintentionally) during transit. The integrity of data can be assured by generating a 
message authentication code (MAC) value, which is a keyed cryptographic checksum of 
the data. If the data is altered and the MAC is recalculated, the old and new MACs will 
differ.

	
Systems and communications protection	
595
﻿
• Peer Authentication. Each IPsec endpoint confirms the identity of the other IPsec 
endpoint with which it wishes to communicate, ensuring that the network traffic and 
data is being sent from the expected host. SSL authentication is typically performed one-
way, authenticating the server to the client; however, SSL VPNs require authentication for 
both endpoints.
• Replay Protection. The same data is not delivered multiple times, and data is not 
delivered grossly out of order.
• Traffic Analysis Protection. A person monitoring network traffic cannot determine the 
contents of the network traffic or how much data is being exchanged. IPsec can also 
conceal which parties are communicating, whereas SSL leaves this information exposed. 
Frequency of communication may also be protected depending on implementation. 
Nevertheless, the number of packets being exchanged can be counted.
• Access Control. IPsec and SSL endpoints can perform filtering to ensure that only 
authorized users can access particular network resources. IPsec and SSL endpoints can 
also allow or block certain types of network traffic, such as allowing Web server access 
but denying file sharing.”23
So we start with IPSec VPNs, and then we will discuss SSL/Transport Layer Security (TLS) 
VPNs.
IPSec VPN – SP 800-77
IPSec is a framework of open standards for ensuring private communications over public 
networks. It has become one of the most common network layer security controls, typically 
used to create a VPN.
There are three primary models for VPN architectures, as follows:
1.	 Gateway-to-gateway: This model protects communications between two specific networks, 
such as an organization’s main office network and a branch office network, or two busi-
ness partners’ networks.
2.	 Host-to-gateway: This model protects communications between one or more individual 
hosts and a specific network belonging to an organization. The host-to-gateway model 
is most often used to allow hosts on unsecured networks, such as traveling employees 
and telecommuters, to gain access to internal organizational services, such as the 
organization’s email and web servers.

3.	 Host-to-host: A host-to-host architecture protects communication between two specific 
computers. It is most often used when a small number of users need to use or administer 
a remote system that requires the use of inherently insecure protocols.

﻿
IPSec is a collection of protocols that assist in protecting communications over IP networks. 
IPSec protocols work together in various combinations to provide protection for communica-
tions.
• IPsec fundamentals:
•	 Authentication Header (AH): AH, one of the IPSec security protocols, provides integrity 
protection for packet headers and data, as well as user authentication. It can optionally 
provide replay protection and access protection. AH cannot encrypt any portion of 
packets.
•	 AH modes: AH has two modes – transport and tunnel. In tunnel mode, AH creates a 
new IP header for each packet; in transport mode, AH does not create a new IP header. 
In IPSec architectures that use a gateway, the true source or destination IP address for 
packets must be altered to be the gateway’s IP address. Because transport mode cannot 
alter the original IP header or create a new IP header, transport mode is generally used 
in host-to-host architectures.
•	 Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP): ESP is the second core IPSec security protocol. 
In the initial version of IPSec, ESP provided only encryption for packet payload data. 
Integrity protection was provided by the AH protocol if needed. In the second version 
of IPSec, ESP became more flexible. It can perform authentication to provide integrity 
protection, although not for the outermost IP header. Also, ESP’s encryption can be 
disabled through the Null ESP Encryption Algorithm. Therefore, in all but the oldest 
IPSec implementations, ESP can be used to provide only encryption, encryption and 
integrity protection, or only integrity protection.
	
	
ESP has two modes: transport and tunnel. In tunnel mode, ESP creates a new IP 
header for each packet. The new IP header lists the end points of the ESP tunnel (such 
as two IPSec gateways) as the source and destination of the packet. Because of this, 
tunnel mode can be used with all three VPN architecture models.
•	 Internet Key Exchange (IKE): The purpose of the IKE protocol is to negotiate, create, 
and manage security associations (SAs). SA is a generic term for a set of values that 
define the IPSec features and protections applied to a connection. SAs can also be 
manually created, using values agreed upon in advance by both parties, but these SAs 
cannot be updated; this method does not scale for real-life large-scale VPNs. IKE uses 
five different types of exchanges to create SAs, transfer status and error information, 
and define new Diffie–Hellman groups. In IPSec, IKE is used to provide a secure 
mechanism for establishing IPsec-protected connections.
•	 IP Payload Compression Protocol (IPComp): In communications, it is often desirable to 
perform lossless compression on data – to repackage information in a smaller format 
without losing any of its meaning. The IPComp is often used with IPSec. By applying 
IPComp to a payload first, and then encrypting the packet through ESP, effective 
compression can be achieved.
	
	
IPComp can be configured to provide compression for IPSec traffic going in one 
direction only (e.g., compress packets from end point A to end point B, but not from 
end point B to end point A) or in both directions. Also, IPComp allows administrators 
to choose from multiple compression algorithms, including DEFLATE and LZS.49. 
IPComp provides a simple yet flexible solution for compressing IPSec payloads.

598	
11.  Security Component Fundamentals for Assessment
﻿
	
IPComp can provide lossless compression for IPSec payloads. Because applying 
compression algorithms to certain types of payloads may actually make them larger, 
IPComp compresses the payload only if it will actually make the packet smaller.
	
IPSec uses IKE to create SAs, which are sets of values that define the security of IPsec-
protected connections. IKE phase 1 creates an IKE SA; IKE phase 2 creates an IPSec SA 
through a channel protected by the IKE SA. IKE phase 1 has two modes: main mode 
and aggressive mode. Main mode negotiates the establishment of the bidirectional IKE 
SA through three pairs of messages, while aggressive mode uses only three messages. 
Although aggressive mode is faster, it is also less flexible and secure. IKE phase 2 
has one mode: quick mode. Quick mode uses three messages to establish a pair of 
unidirectional IPSec SAs. Quick mode communications are encrypted by the method 
specified in the IKE SA created by phase 1.
SSL VPNs – SP 800-113
An SSL VPN consists of one or more VPN devices to which users connect using their web 
browsers. The traffic between the web browser and the SSL VPN device is encrypted with the 
SSL protocol or its successor, the TLS protocol. This type of VPN may be referred to as either 
an SSL VPN or a TLS VPN.
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) virtual private networks (VPN) provide secure remote access to an organiza-
tion’s resources. An SSL VPN consists of one or more VPN devices to which users connect using their Web 
browsers. The traffic between the Web browser and the SSL VPN device is encrypted with the SSL protocol or 
its successor, the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. This type of VPN may be referred to as either an SSL 
VPN or a TLS VPN. This guide uses the term SSL VPN. SSL VPNs provide remote users with access to Web ap-
plications and client/server applications, and connectivity to internal networks. Despite the popularity of SSL 
VPNs, they are not intended to replace Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) VPNs.1 The two VPN technologies 
are complementary and address separate network architectures and business needs. SSL VPNs offer versatil-
ity and ease of use because they use the SSL protocol, which is included with all standard Web browsers, so 
the client usually does not require configuration by the user. SSL VPNs offer granular control for a range of 
users on a variety of computers, accessing resources from many locations.24
SSL PORTAL VPNS
An SSL portal VPN allows a user to use a single standard SSL connection to a website to se-
curely access multiple network services. The site accessed is typically called a portal because 
it has a single page that leads to many other resources. SSL portal VPNs act as transport-layer 
VPNs that work over a single network port, namely the TCP port for SSL-protected HTTP 
(443).
SSL TUNNEL VPNS
An SSL tunnel VPN allows a user to use a typical web browser to securely access multiple 
network services through a tunnel that is running under SSL. SSL tunnel VPNs require that 
the web browser be able to handle specific types of active content (e.g., Java, JavaScript, 
Flash, or ActiveX) and that the user be able to run them. (Most browsers that handle such 
applications and plug-ins also allow the user or administrator to block them from being 
executed.)
24SP 800-113, p. ES-1.

﻿
ADMINISTERING SSL VPN
The administration of both SSL portal VPNs and SSL tunnel VPNs is similar. The gateway administrator 
needs to specify local policy in at least two broad areas:
• Access. All SSL VPNs allow the administrator to specify which users have access to the VPN services. User 
authentication might be done with a simple password through a Web form, or through more sophisticated 
authentication mechanisms.
• Capabilities. The administrator can specify the services to which each authorized user has access. For 
example, some users might have access to only certain Web pages, while others might have access to those 
Web pages plus other services.
Different SSL VPNs have very different administrative interfaces and very different capabilities for allow-
ing access and specifying allowed actions for users. For example, many but not all SSL VPNs allow validation 
of users through the Remote Authentication Dial-In User Server (RADIUS) protocol. As another example, 
some SSL VPNs allow the administrator to create groups of users who have the same access methods and 
capabilities; this makes adding new users to the system easier than gateways that require the administrator to 
specify both of these for each new user.25
SSL VPN ARCHITECTURE
The five phases of the recommended approach are as follows:
1.	 Identify Requirements. Identify the requirements for remote access and determine how they can best be 
met.
2.	 Design the Solution. Make design decisions in five areas: access control, endpoint security, authentication 
methods, architecture, and cryptography policy.
3.	 Implement and Test a Prototype. Test a prototype of the designed solution in a laboratory, test, or produc-
tion environment to identify any potential issues.
4.	 Deploy the Solution. Gradually deploy the SSL VPN solution throughout the enterprise, beginning with 
a pilot program.
5.	 Manage the Solution. Maintain the SSL VPN components and resolve operational issues. Repeat  
the planning and implementation process when significant changes need to be incorporated into the 
solution.26
SSL VPN ARCHITECTURE
Typical SSL VPN users include people in remote offices, mobile users, business partners, and customers. 
Hardware clients include various types of devices, such as public kiosks, home personal computers (PC), 
PDAs, or smart phones, which may or may not be controlled or managed by the organization. The SSL VPN 
may also be accessed from any location including an airport, a coffee shop, or a hotel room, as long as the 
location has connectivity to the Internet and the user has a Web client that is capable of using the particular 
SSL VPN. All traffic is encrypted as it traverses public networks such as the Internet. The SSL VPN gateway is 
Note: Many of the cryptographic algorithms used in some SSL cipher suites are not FIPS-ap-
proved, and therefore are not allowed for use in SSL VPNs that are to be used in applications that 
must conform to FIPS-140-2.

the end point for the secure connection and provides various services and features (most SSL VPN products 
are standalone hardware appliances, although there are some software-based solutions that are installed on 
user-supplied servers).27
SSL PROTOCOL BASICS
The security of the data sent over an SSL VPN relies on the security of the SSL protocol. 
The SSL protocol allows a client (such as a web browser) and a server (such as an SSL VPN) 
to negotiate the type of security to be used during an SSL session. Thus, it is critical to make 
sure that the security agreed to by the remote user and the SSL gateway meets the security 
requirements of the organization using the SSL VPN.
There are three types of security that the client and the server can negotiate: the version of 
SSL, the type of cryptography, and the authentication method.
• Versions of SSL and TLS: The terms SSL and TLS are often used together to describe the 
same protocol. In fact, SSL refers to all versions of the SSL protocol as defined by the 
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), while TLS refers only to versions 3.1 and later 
of the SSL protocol. Two versions of TLS have been standardized: TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1. 
27Ibid., p. 3-1.

	
Systems and communications protection	
601
﻿
TLS 1.0 is the same as SSL 3.1; there are no versions of SSL after 3.1. As of the writing of 
this guide, work is being done on TLS version 1.2.
	
	 TLS is approved for use in the protection of federal information; SSL versions other 
than 3.1 are not.
• Cryptography used in SSL sessions: There are many types of cryptographic functions 
that are used in security protocols. The most widely known cryptographic features are 
confidentiality (secrecy of data), integrity (the ability to detect even minute changes in 
the data), and signature (the ability to trace the origin of the data). The combination of 
these features is an important aspect of the overall security of a communications stream. 
SSL uses four significant types of features: confidentiality, integrity, signature, and key 
establishment (the way that a key is agreed to by the two parties).
	
	 SSL uses cipher suites to define the set of cryptographic functions that a client and 
a server use when communicating. This is unlike protocols such as IPSec and Secure/
Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) where the two parties agree to 
individual cryptographic functions. That is, SSL exchanges say in effect, “Here is a set of 
functions to be used together, and here is another set I am willing to use.” IPSec and S/
MIME (and many other protocols) instead say, “Here are the confidentiality functions I am 
willing to use, here are the integrity functions I am willing to use, and here are the signature 
algorithms I am willing to use,” and the other side creates a set from those choices.
	
	 Just as the SSL client and server need to be able to use the same version of SSL, 
they also need to be able to use the same cipher suite; otherwise, the two sides cannot 
communicate. The organization running the SSL VPN chooses which cipher suites meet 
its security goals and configures the SSL VPN gateway to use only those cipher suites.
• Authentication used for identifying SSL servers: When a web browser connects to an SSL 
server such as an SSL VPN gateway, the browser user needs some way to know that 
the browser is talking to a server the user trusts. SSL uses certificates that are signed by 
trusted entities to authenticate the server to the web user. (SSL can also use certificates to 
authenticate users to servers, but this is rarely done.)
	
	 The server authentication occurs very early in the SSL process, immediately after the 
user sends its first message to the SSL server. In that first message, the web browser 
specifies which type of certificate algorithms it can handle; the two common choices are 
RSA and DSS. In the second message, the SSL server responds with a certificate of one 
of the types that the browser said it understands. After receiving the certificate, the web 
browser verifies that the identity in the certificate (i.e., the domain name listed in the 
certificate) matches the domain name to which the web browser attempted to connect.
 
 Some SSL VPNs use certificates issued by the vendor of the SSL VPN, and those 
certificates do not link through a chain of trust to a root certificate that is normally trusted 
by most users. If that is the case, the user should add the SSL VPN’s own certificate to the 
user’s list of directly trusted certificates. It is important to note that users should not add 
the root certificate of the SSL VPN’s manufacturer to the list of certification authorities 
that the user trusts, since the manufacturer’s security policies and controls may differ 
from those of the organization. Other SSL VPNs produce self-signed certificates that do 
not chain to any trusted root certificate; as before, the user should add the SSL VPN’s 
own certificate to the user’s list of directly trusted certificates.

Transport Layer Security
The Netscape Corporation designed a protocol known as the SSL to meet security needs of 
client browsers and server applications. Version 1 of SSL was never released. Version 2 (SSL 
2.0) was released in 1994 but had well-known security vulnerabilities. Version 3 (SSL 3.0) was 
released in 1995 to address these vulnerabilities.
During this timeframe, Microsoft Corporation released a protocol known as Private Com-
munications Technology (PCT), and later released a higher performance protocol known as 
the Secure Transport Layer Protocol (STLP). PCT and STLP never commanded the market 
share that SSL 2.0 and SSL 3.0 commanded. The IETF (a technical working group responsible 
for developing internet standards to ensure communications compatibility across different 
implementations) attempted to resolve, as best it could, security engineering and protocol 
incompatibility issues between the protocols. The IETF standards track Transport Layer Secu-
rity Protocol Version 1.0 (TLS 1.0) emerged and was codified by the IETF as [RFC2246].
While TLS 1.0 is based on SSL 3.0, and the differences between them are not dramatic, they 
are significant enough that TLS 1.0 and SSL 3.0 do not interoperate. However, TLS 1.0 does 
incorporate a mechanism by which a TLS 1.0 implementation can negotiate to use SSL 3.0 
with requesting entities as if TLS were never proposed. However, because SSL 3.0 is not ap-
proved for use in the protection of federal information (Section 7.1 of [FIPS140-2l]), TLS must 
be properly configured to ensure that the negotiation and use of SSL 3.0 never occurs when 
federal information is to be protected.
The NIST guidelines (SP 800-52, SP 800-77, and SP 800-113) attempt to make clear the im-
pact of selecting and using secure web transport protocols for use in protecting sensitive but 
unclassified US government information.

	
Wireless networking

﻿
Both the TLS 1.0 and the SSL 3.0 protocol specifications use cryptographic mechanisms 
to implement the security services that establish and maintain a secure TCP/IP connection. 
The secure connection prevents eavesdropping, tampering, or message forgery. Implement-
ing data confidentiality with cryptography (encryption) prevents eavesdropping, generating 
a message authentication code (MAC) with a secure hash function prevents undetected tam-
pering, and authenticating clients and servers with public key cryptography-based digital 
signatures prevents message forgery. In each case – preventing eavesdropping, tampering, 
and forgery – a key or shared secret is required by the cryptographic mechanism. A pseudo-
random number generator and a key establishment algorithm provide for the generation and 
sharing of these secrets.

WIRELESS NETWORKING
In today’s networks, there are often many methods for communications used and de-
ployed. Some of these methods take advantage of nonwired connectivity by utilizing wireless 
technology. There are several types of wireless-based networking methods currently used all 
based on radio-frequency (RF) methods of communications for the transmission and recep-
tion of the signals carrying the digital data across and external to the network. Examples of 
wireless networks include cell phone networks, Wi-Fi local networks, and terrestrial micro-
wave networks.

Every wireless LAN network consists of an AP, such as a wireless router, and one or more 
wireless adapters. As shown in the standard two deployment modes below, there are many 
security controls from SP 800-53 which are applicable and necessary to secure wireless LANs 
and Wi-Fi networks. The assessor needs to focus on the technology deployed, review all de-
sign and implementation documents, and test the actual APs (aka hotspots) and the client 
adapters used to prove the encryption and communications used during the wireless ac-
tivities remain active and constant during all phases of transmission of the data over the 
airwaves via the RF signals used.
A wireless AP is a device that allows wireless devices to connect to a wired network us-
ing Wi-Fi, or related standards. The AP usually connects to a router (via a wired network) 
as a stand-alone device, but it can also be an integral component of the router itself. An AP 
is differentiated from a hotspot, which is the physical space where the wireless service is 
provided. A hotspot is a common public application of APs, where wireless clients can con-
nect to the internet without regard for the particular networks to which they have attached 
for the moment.

Wireless security is the prevention of unauthorized access or damage to computers using 
wireless networks by utilizing different methods of encoding and encryption, based on the 
parameters of the RF carrier and bandwidth used by the particular type of Wi-Fi being em-
ployed. The most common types of wireless security are Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) 
and Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA). WEP is a notoriously weak security standard. The pass-
word it uses can often be cracked in a few minutes with a basic laptop computer and widely 
available software tools. WEP is an old IEEE 802.11 standard from 1999 which was outdated 
in 2003 by WPA or WPA. WPA was a quick alternative to improve security over WEP. The 
current standard is WPA2 which uses an encryption mechanism which encrypts the network 
with a 256-bit key; the longer key length improves security over WEP.

606	
11.  Security Component Fundamentals for Assessment
﻿
The major terms and security areas of focus include the following:
WPA: Initial WPA version, to supply enhanced security over the older WEP protocol. 
Typically uses the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) encryption protocol.
WPA2: Also known as IEEE 802.11i-2004. Successor of WPA, and replaces the TKIP 
encryption protocol with Counter Cipher Mode with Block Chaining Message 
Authentication Protocol (CCMP) to provide additional security.
TKIP: A 128-bit per-packet key is used, meaning that it dynamically generates a new key 
for each packet. This is part of the IEEE 802.11i standard. TKIP implements per-packet 
key mixing with a rekeying system and also provides a message integrity check. These 
avoid the problems of WEP.
CCMP: An AES-based encryption mechanism that is stronger than TKIP; sometimes 
referred to as AES instead of CCMP.
EAP: Extensible Authentication Protocol. EAP is an authentication framework providing 
for the transport and usage of keying material and parameters generated by EAP 
methods since EAP uses a central authentication server.
WPA-Personal: Also referred to as WPA-preshared key (PSK) mode. Is designed for home 
and small office networks and does not require an authentication server. Each wireless 
network device authenticates with the AP using the same 256-bit key.
WPA-Enterprise: Also referred to as WPA-802.1X mode, and sometimes just WPA (as 
opposed to WPA-PSK). Is designed for enterprise networks, and requires a Remote 
Authentication Dial-In User Server (RADIUS) authentication server.
This requires a more complicated setup, but provides additional security (e.g., protection 
against dictionary attacks). An EAP is used for authentication, which comes in different fla-
vors (e.g., EAP-TLS, EAP-Tunneled Transport Layer Security (TTLS), EAP-security informa-
tion management (SIM)).

Bluetooth is a proprietary open wireless technology standard for exchanging data over 
short distances.
Cumulatively, the various versions of Bluetooth specifications define four security modes. 
Each version of Bluetooth supports some, but not all, of the four modes. Each Bluetooth de-
vice must operate in one of the four modes, which are described below.
Security Mode 1 is nonsecure. Security functionality (authentication and encryption) is by-
passed, leaving the device and connections susceptible to attackers. In effect, Bluetooth de-
vices in this mode are “promiscuous” and do not employ any mechanisms to prevent other 
Bluetooth-enabled devices from establishing connections. Security Mode 1 is supported only 
in v2.0 + enhanced data rate (EDR) (and earlier) devices.
In Security Mode 2, a service level-enforced security mode, security procedures are initiated 
after Link Management Protocol (LMP) link establishment but before Logical Link Control 
and Adaptation (L2CAP) channel establishment. L2CAP resides in the data link layer and 
provides connection-oriented and connectionless data services to upper layers. For this secu-
rity mode, a security manager (as specified in the Bluetooth architecture) controls access to 
specific services and devices.
The centralized security manager maintains policies for AC and interfaces with other pro-
tocols and device users. Varying security policies and trust levels to restrict access may be de-
fined for applications with different security requirements operating in parallel. It is possible 
to grant access to some services without providing access to other services. In this mode, the 
notion of authorization – the process of deciding if a specific device is allowed to have access 
to a specific service – is introduced.

608	
11.  Security Component Fundamentals for Assessment
﻿
In Security Mode 3, the link level-enforced security mode, a Bluetooth device initiates se-
curity procedures before the physical link is fully established. Bluetooth devices operating in 
Security Mode 3 mandate authentication and encryption for all connections to and from the 
device. This mode supports authentication (unidirectional or mutual) and encryption.
Similar to Security Mode 2, Security Mode 4 (introduced in Bluetooth v2.1 + EDR) is a ser-
vice level-enforced security mode in which security procedures are initiated after link setup. 
Security requirements for services protected by Security Mode 4 must be classified as one 
of the following: authenticated link key required, unauthenticated link key required, or no 
security required. Whether or not a link key is authenticated depends on the Secure Simple 
Pairing association model used.
Cryptography
Three types of encryption as currently used in security controls:
1.	 Symmetric: One method of cryptography is symmetric cryptography (also known as secret 
key cryptography or private key cryptography). Symmetric cryptography is best suited for 
bulk encryption because it is much faster than asymmetric cryptography. With symmetric 
cryptography:
a.	 Both parties share the same key (which is kept secret). Before communications begin, 
both parties must exchange the shared secret key. Each pair of communicating entities 
requires a unique shared key. The key is not shared with other communication 
partners.
	
Note: Other names – secret key, conventional key, session key, file encryption key, etc.

﻿
Pros:
a.	 Speed/file size:
-	 Symmetric-key algorithms are generally much less computationally intensive which 
provides a smaller file size that allows for faster transmissions and less storage space.
Cons:
a.	 Key management:
-	 One disadvantage of symmetric-key algorithms is the requirement of a shared secret 
key, with one copy at each end. See drawing below.
-	 In order to ensure secure communications between everyone in a population of 
n people a total of n(n − 1)/2 keys are needed. Example: key for 10 individuals, 
10(10 − 1)/2 = 45 keys.
-	 The process of selecting, distributing, and storing keys is known as key management; 
it is difficult to achieve reliably and securely.

2.	 Asymmetric: Asymmetric cryptography is a second form of cryptography. It is scalable for 
use in very large and ever expanding environments where data is frequently exchanged 
between different communication partners. With asymmetric cryptography:
a.	 Each user has two keys: a public key and a private key.
b.	Both keys are mathematically related (both keys together are called the key pair).
c.	 The public key is made available to anyone. The private key is kept secret.
d.	Both keys are required to perform an operation. For example, data encrypted with the 
private key is unencrypted with the public key. Data encrypted with the public key is 
unencrypted with the private key.
e.	 Encrypting data with the private key creates a digital signature. This ensures the 
message has come from the stated sender (because only the sender had access to the 
private key to be able to create the signature).
f.	 A digital envelope is signing a message with a recipient’s public key. A digital envelope, 
which serves as a means of AC by ensuring that only the intended recipient can open 
the message (because only the receiver will have the private key necessary to unlock 
the envelope; this is also known as receiver authentication).
g.	If the private key is ever discovered, a new key pair must be generated.
	
	 Asymmetric cryptography is often used to exchange the secret key to prepare for using 
symmetric cryptography to encrypt data. In the case of a key exchange, one party creates 
the secret key and encrypts it with the public key of the recipient. The recipient would 
then decrypt it with their private key. The remaining communication would be done with 
the secret key being the encryption key. Asymmetric encryption is used in key exchange, 
email security, web security, and other encryption systems that require key exchange over 
the public network.

Pros:
a.	 Key management:
-	 Two keys (public and private), private key cannot be derived for the public so the 
public key can be freely distributed without confidentially being compromised
-	 Offers digital signatures, integrity checks, and nonrepudiation
	
Cons:
a.	 Speed/file size:
-	 Because symmetric-key algorithms are generally much less computationally intensive 
than asymmetric-key algorithms.
-	 In practice, asymmetric-key algorithm are typically hundreds to thousands times 
slower than a symmetric-key algorithm.

3.	 Hashing: A hash is a function that takes a variable-length string (message), and compresses 
and transforms it into a fixed-length value.
a.	 The hashing algorithm (formula or method) is public.
b.	Hashing uses a secret value to protect the method.
c.	 Hashing is used to create checksums or message digests (e.g., an investigator can 
create a checksum to secure a removable media device that is to be used as evidence).
d.	The hash ensures data integrity (i.e., the data have not been altered). The receiving 
device computes a checksum and compares it to the checksum included with the file. 
If they do not match, the data has been altered.
e.	 Examples include message digest (MD2, MD4, MD5) and Secure Hashing Algorithm 
(SHA).
f.	 SHA, Race Integrity Primitives Evaluation Message Digest (RIPEMD), and Hash of

Secure Hash
The secure hash function takes a stream of data and reduces it to a fixed size through a 
one-way mathematical function. The result is called a message digest and can be thought of 
as a fingerprint of the data. The message digest can be reproduced by any party with the same 
stream of data, but it is virtually impossible to create a different stream of data that produces 
the same message digest.

﻿
Secure Hash Standard
The Secure Hash Standard specifies five SHAs: SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and 
SHA-512. All five of the algorithms are iterative, one-way hash functions that can process a 
message to produce a condensed representation called a message digest. These algorithms enable 
the determination of a message’s integrity: any change to the message will, with a very high 
probability, result in a different message digest. This property is useful in the generation and 
verification of digital signatures and MACs, and in the generation of random numbers or bits.
The five algorithms differ most significantly in the security strengths that are provided 
for the data being hashed. The security strengths of these five hash functions and the 
system as a whole when each of them is used with other cryptographic algorithms, such 
as Digital Signature Algorithms (DSAs) and keyed-hash MACs, can be found in SP 800-57 
and SP 800-107.
Additionally, the five algorithms differ in terms of the size of the blocks and words of data 
that are used during hashing.
HMAC
Providing a way to check the integrity of information transmitted over or stored in an un-
reliable medium is a prime necessity in the world of open computing and communications. 
Mechanisms that provide such integrity checks based on a secret key are usually called MACs. 
Typically, MACs are used between two parties that share a secret key in order to authenticate 

614	
11.  Security Component Fundamentals for Assessment
﻿
information transmitted between these parties. This standard defines a MAC that uses a cryp-
tographic hash function in conjunction with a secret key. This mechanism is called Hash-Based 
Message Authentication Code (HMAC). HMAC shall use an approved cryptographic hash 
function [FIPS-180-3]. It uses the secret key for the calculation and verification of the MACs.
So, in review, the table below covers the three types of encryption and their particular uses:
• Encryption provides confidentiality.
• Hashing provides integrity (like a checksum).
• Digital signatures provide authentication and integrity.
• Digitally signed encryption provides confidentiality, authentication, and integrity.

Intrusion Detection Systems
Another element to securing networks complementing firewall implementations is an IDS. 
An IDS works in conjunction with routers and firewalls by monitoring network usage anom-
alies by being deployed in a demilitarized zone (DMZ) on the edge of the network or it is 
utilized as a network-based device inside the network to monitor for specific traffic patterns 
and alert when these patterns are identified so it protects a company’s information system 
resources from external as well as internal misuse.
An IDS operates continuously on the system, running in the background and notifying 
administrators when it detects a perceived threat. For example, an IDS detects attack patterns 
and issues an alert. Broad categories of IDS include:
• Network-based IDSs: Identify attacks within the monitored network and issue a warning 
to the operator. If a network-based IDS is placed between the internet and the firewall, 
it will detect all the attack attempts, whether or not they enter the firewall. If the IDS is 
placed between a firewall and the corporate network, it will detect those attacks that 

	
Wireless networking	
615
﻿
enter the firewall (it will detect intruders). The IDS is not a substitute for a firewall, but it 
complements the function of a firewall.
• Host-based IDSs: Configured for a specific environment and will monitor various internal 
resources of the operating system to warn of a possible attack. They can detect the 
modification of executable programs, detect the deletion of files, and issue a warning 
when an attempt is made to use a privileged command.
Common Intrusion Detection Methodologies
• Signature-Based Detection
A signature is a pattern that corresponds to a known threat. Signature-based detection is the process of com-
paring signatures against observed events to identify possible incidents. 5 Examples of signatures are as 
follows:
	 A telnet attempt with a username of “root”, which is a violation of an organization’s security policy.
	 An email with a subject of “Free pictures!” and an attachment filename of “freepics.exe”, which are char-
acteristics of a known form of malware.
	 An operating system log entry with a status code value of 645, which indicates that the host’s auditing 
has been disabled.
	 Signature-based detection is very effective at detecting known threats but largely ineffective at detect-
ing previously unknown threats, threats disguised by the use of evasion techniques, and many variants of 
known threats.
• Anomaly-Based Detection
Anomaly-based detection is the process of comparing definitions of what activity is considered normal against 
observed events to identify significant deviations. An IDPS using anomaly-based detection has profiles that 
represent the normal behavior of such things as users, hosts, network connections, or applications. The 
profiles are developed by monitoring the characteristics of typical activity over a period of time. The major 
benefit of anomaly-based detection methods is that they can be very effective at detecting previously un-
known threats.
• Stateful Protocol Analysis
Stateful protocol analysis is the process of comparing predetermined profiles of generally accepted definitions 
of benign protocol activity for each protocol state against observed events to identify deviations. Unlike 
anomaly-based detection, which uses host or network-specific profiles, stateful protocol analysis relies on 
vendor-developed universal profiles that specify how particular protocols should and should not be used. 
The “stateful” in stateful protocol analysis means that the IDPS is capable of understanding and tracking 
the state of network, transport, and application protocols that have a notion of state.
	 Stateful protocol analysis can identify unexpected sequences of commands, such as issuing the same 
command repeatedly or issuing a command without first issuing a command upon which it is dependent. 
Another state tracking feature of stateful protocol analysis is that for protocols that perform authentication, 
the IDPS can keep track of the authenticator used for each session, and record the authenticator used for 
suspicious activity. This is helpful when investigating an incident. Some IDPSs can also use the authentica-
tor information to define acceptable activity differently for multiple classes of users or specific users.
	 The “protocol analysis” performed by stateful protocol analysis methods usually includes reasonableness 
checks for individual commands, such as minimum and maximum lengths for arguments. If a command 
typically has a username argument, and usernames have a maximum length of 20 characters, then an argu-
ment with a length of 1000 characters is suspicious. If the large argument contains binary data, then it is 
even more suspicious.28
Types of IDSs include:
• Signature-based: These IDS systems protect against detected intrusion patterns. The 
intrusive patterns they can identify are stored in the form of signatures.
28SP 800-94, p. 2-4 to 2-6.

616	
11.  Security Component Fundamentals for Assessment
﻿
• Statistical-based: These IDS systems need a comprehensive definition of the known and 
expected behavior of systems.
• Neural networks: An IDS with this feature monitors the general patterns of activity and 
traffic on the network and creates a database. This is similar to the statistical model but 
with added self-learning functionality.
Signature-based IDSs will not be able to detect all types of intrusions due to the limitations 
of the detection rules. On the other hand, statistical-based systems may report many events 
outside of defined normal activity but which are normal activities on the network. A combi-
nation of signature- and statistical-based models provides better protection.
Uses of IDPS Technologies
• Identifying possible incidents
• Identifying reconnaissance activity
• Identifying security policy problems
• Documenting existing threat to an organization
• Deterring individuals from violating security policies
The table below is a high-level comparison of the four primary IDPS technology types. The strengths listed 
in the table indicate the roles or situations in which each technology type is generally superior to the others. 
A particular technology type may have additional benefits over others, such as logging additional data that 
would be useful for validating alerts recorded by other IDPSs, or preventing intrusions that other IDPSs can-
not because of technology capabilities or placement.29

FIREWALLS
Firewall Security Systems – SP 800-41
Every time a corporation connects its internal computer network to the internet it faces po-
tential danger. Because of the internet’s openness, every corporate network connected to it is 
vulnerable to attack. Hackers on the internet could theoretically break into the corporate net-
work and do harm in a number of ways: steal or damage important data, damage individual 
computers or the entire network, use the corporate computer’s resources, or use the corporate 
network and resources as a way of posing as a corporate employee. Companies should build 
firewalls as one means of perimeter security for their networks. Likewise, this same principle 
holds true for very sensitive or critical systems that need to be protected from untrusted us-
ers inside the corporate network (internal hackers). Firewalls are defined as a device installed 
at the point where network connections enter a site; they apply rules to control the type of 
networking traffic flowing in and out. Most commercial firewalls are built to handle the most 
commonly used internet protocols.
To be effective, firewalls should allow individuals on the corporate network to access the 
internet and, at the same time, stop hackers or others on the internet from gaining access to 
the corporate network to cause damage. Generally, most organizations will follow a deny-all 
philosophy, which means that access to a given resource will be denied unless a user can pro-
vide a specific business reason or need for access to the information resource. The converse of 
this access philosophy, not widely accepted, is the accept-all philosophy under which every-
one is allowed access unless someone can provide a reason for denying access.
Firewall General Features
Firewalls are hardware and software combinations that are built using routers, servers, 
and a variety of software. They should control the most vulnerable point between a cor-
porate network and the internet, and they can be as simple or complex as the corporate 

618	
11.  Security Component Fundamentals for Assessment
﻿
information security policy demands. There are many different types of firewalls, but most 
enable organizations to:
• Block access to particular sites on the internet
• Limit traffic on an organization’s public services segment to relevant addresses and ports
• Prevent certain users from accessing certain servers or services
• Monitor communications between an internal and an external network
• Monitor and record all communications between an internal network and the outside 
world to investigate network penetrations or detect internal subversion
• Encrypt packets that are sent between different physical locations within an organization 
by creating a VPN over the internet (i.e., IPSec VPN tunnels)
Firewall Types
Generally, the types of firewalls available today fall into four categories which include:
• Packet filtering: Packet filtering is a security method of controlling what data can flow 
to and from a network. It takes place by using Access Control Lists (ACLs), which are 
developed and applied to a device. The ACL is just lines of text, called rules, which 
the device will apply to each packet that it receives. The lines of text give specific 
information pertaining to what packets can be accepted and what packets are denied. 
For instance, an ACL can have one line that states that any packets coming from the IP 
range 172.168.0.0 must be denied. Another line may indicate that no packets using the 
FTP service will be allowed to enter the network, and another line may indicate that 
no traffic is to be allowed through port 443. Then it can have a line indicating all traffic 
on port 80 is acceptable and should be routed to a specific IP address, which is the web 
server. Each time the device receives a packet, it compares the information in the packet’s 
header to each line in the ACL. If the packet indicates it is using FTP or requests to make 
a connection to the 443 port, it is discarded. If the packet header information indicates 
that it wants to communicate through port 80 using HTTP over TCP, then the packet is 
accepted and redirected to the web server.
This filtering is based on network layer information, which means that the device cannot 
look too far into the packet itself. It can make decisions based on only header information,

which is limited. Most routers use ACLs to act as a type of router and to carry out rout-
ing decisions, but they do not provide the level of protection that other types of firewalls, 
which look deeper into the packet, provide. Since packet filtering looks only at the header 
information, it is not application dependent like many proxy firewalls are. Packet filter-
ing firewalls do not keep track of the state of a connection, which takes place in a stateful 
firewall.
Pros:
• Scalable
• Provides high performance
• Application independent
Cons:
• Does not look into the packet past the header information
• Low security relative to other options
• Does not keep track of the state of a connection
Note: Packet filtering cannot protect against mail bomb attacks because it cannot read the content 
of the packet.
• Application firewall systems: Application-level firewalls inspect the entire packet and make 
access decisions based on the actual content of the packet. They understand different 
services and protocols and the commands that are used within them. An application-level 
proxy can distinguish between an FTP GET command and an FTP PUT command and 
make access decisions based on this granular level of information, where packet filtering 
firewalls can only allow or deny FTP requests as a whole, not the commands used within 
the FTP protocol.
	
	 An application-level firewall works for one service or protocol. A computer can have 
many different types of services and protocols (FTP, Network Time Protocol (NTP), 
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), Telnet, etc.); thus, there must be one application-
level proxy per service. Providing application-level proxy services can be much trickier 
than it appears. The proxy must totally understand how specific protocols work and 
what commands within that protocol are legitimate. This is a lot to know and look 
at during the transmission of data. If the application-level proxy firewall does not 
understand a certain protocol or service, it cannot protect this type of communication. 
This is when a circuit-level proxy can come into play because it does not deal with such 
complex issues. An advantage of circuit-level proxies is that they can handle a wider 
variety of protocols and services than application-level proxies, but the downfall is that 
the circuit-level proxy cannot provide the degree of granular control that an application-
level proxy can. Life is just full of compromises.
	
	 So, an application-level firewall is dedicated to a particular protocol or service. There 
must be one proxy per protocol because one proxy could not properly interpret all the 
commands of all the protocols coming its way. A circuit-level proxy works at a lower 
layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model and does not require one proxy 
per protocol because it is not looking at such detailed information.

• Stateful inspection: When regular packet filtering is used, a packet arrives at the router, 
and the router runs through its ACLs to see if this packet should be allowed or denied. 
If the packet is allowed, it is passed on to the destination host or another router, and the 
router forgets it ever received this packet. This is different from stateful filtering, which 
remembers what packets went where until that particular connection is closed. Stateful 
routers also make decisions on what packets to allow or disallow, but their logic goes a 
step farther. For example, a regular packet filtering device may deny any UDP packets 
requesting service on port 25, and a stateful filtering device may have the rule to allow 
UDP packets through only if they are responses to outgoing requests. Basically, the 
stateful firewall will want to allow only those packets in that its internal hosts requested.
	
	 If User A sends a request to a computer on a different network, this request will be 
logged in the firewall’s state table. The table will indicate that User A’s computer made a 
request and there should be packets coming back to User A. When the computer on the 
internet responds to User A, these packets will be compared to data in the state table. 
Since the state table does have information about a previous request for these packets,  
the router will allow the packets to pass through. If, on the other hand, User A did not 
make any requests and packets were coming in from the internet to him, the firewall will 
see that there were no previous requests for this information and then look at its ACLs  
to see if these packets are allowed to come in.
	
	 So, regular packet filtering compares incoming packets to rules defined in its ACLs. 
When stateful packet filtering receives a packet, it first looks in its state table to see if 
a connection has already been established and if this data was requested. If there is 
no previous connection and the state table holds no information about the packets, 
the packet is compared to the device’s ACLs. If the ACL allows this type of traffic, the 
packet is allowed to access the network. If that type of traffic is not allowed, the packet is 
dropped. Although this provides an extra step of protection, it also adds more complexity 
because this device must now keep a dynamic state table and remember connections. 
This has opened the door to many types of denial-of-service attacks. There are several 
types of attacks that are aimed at flooding the state table with bogus information. The 
state table is a resource like a system’s hard drive space, memory, and CPU. When the 
state table is stuffed full of bogus information, it can either freeze the device or cause it to

reboot. Also, if this firewall has to be rebooted for some reason, it loses its information on 
all recent connections; thus, it will deny legitimate packets.
	
	 Note: Context AC pertains to a sequence of events proceeding the access request and 
specifics of the environment within a window of time. Content pertains to making an AC 
decision based on the data being protected.
•	 A stateful firewall is a context AC.
•	 Fourth-generation firewall = dynamic packet filter.
•	 Fifth-generation firewall = kernel proxies.
• Circuit or application proxy: A proxy is a middleman. If someone needed to give a box and 
a message to the President of the United States, this person could not just walk up to 
him and give him these items. The person would have to go through a middleman who 
would accept the box and message and thoroughly go through the box to ensure nothing 
dangerous was inside. This is what a proxy firewall does: it accepts messages either 
entering or leaving a network, inspects them for malicious information, and, when it 
decides things are okay, passes the data on to the destination computer.
	
	 A proxy will stand between a trusted and untrusted network and will actually make 
the connection, each way, on behalf of the source. So if a user on the internet requests 
to send data to a computer on the internal, protected network, the proxy will get this 
request and look it over for suspicious information. The request does not automatically 
go to the destination computer; the proxy server acts like the destination computer. If 
the proxy decides the packet is safe, it sends it on to the destination computer. When the 
destination computer replies, the reply goes back to the proxy server, who repackages 
the packet to contain the source address of the proxy server, not the host system on the 
internal network. All external connections heading to the internal network are terminated 
at the proxy server. This type of firewall makes a copy of each accepted packet before 
transmitting it. It will repackage the packet to hide the packet’s true origin.
	
	 Just like the packet filtering firewalls, proxy firewalls also have a list of rules that are 
applied to packets. When the proxy firewall receives a packet, it runs through this list of 
rules to see if the packet should be allowed. If the packet is allowed, the proxy firewall 
repackages the packet and sends it on its way to the destination computer. When users 
go through a proxy, they do not usually know it. Users on the internet think they are 
talking directly to users on the internal network and vice versa. The proxy server is the 
only machine that talks to the outside world. This ensures that no computer has direct 
access to internal computers. This also means that the proxy server is the only computer 
that needs a valid IP address. The rest of the computers on the internal network can use 
private (nonroutable IP addresses on the internet) addresses, since no computers on the 
outside will see their addresses anyway.
	
	 Many times, proxy servers are used when a company is using a dual-homed firewall. 
A dual-homed firewall has two interfaces: one facing the external network and the 
other facing the internal network. This is different than a computer that has forwarding 
enabled, which just lets packets pass through its interfaces with no AC enforced. A 
dual-homed firewall has two network interface cards (NICs) and should have packet 
forwarding and routing turned off. They are turned off for safety reasons. If forwarding 
were enabled, the computer would not apply the necessary ACL rules or other 
restrictions necessary of a firewall. Instead, a dual-homed firewall requires a higher 

622	
11.  Security Component Fundamentals for Assessment
﻿
level of intelligence to tell it what packets should go where and what types of packets 
are acceptable. This is where the proxy comes in. When a packet comes to the external 
NIC from the untrusted network on a dual-homed firewall, the computer does not know 
what to do with it, so it passes it up to the proxy software. The proxy software inspects 
the packet to make sure that it is legitimate. Then the proxy software makes a connection 
with the destination computer on the internal network and passes on the packet. When 
the internal computer replies, the packet goes to the internal interface on the dual-homed 
firewall, it passes up to the proxy software, the proxy inspects the packet and slaps on a 
different header, and the proxy passes the packet out the external NIC that is connected 
to the external network.
	
Pros:
•	 Looks at the information within a packet all the way up to the application layer
•	 Provides better security than packet filtering
•	 Breaks the connection between trusted and untrusted systems
	
Cons:
•	 Some proxy firewalls are limited to what applications they can support.
•	 Degrades traffic performance.
•	 Poor scalability for application-based proxy firewalls.
	
Note: Breaks client/server model – which is good for security, but at times bad for 
functionality.
Firewall Utilization
• Most companies have firewalls to restrict access into their network from internet users. 
They may also have firewalls to restrict one internal network from accessing another 
internal network. An organizational security policy will give high-level instructions 

	
Firewalls

﻿
on acceptable and unacceptable actions as they pertain to security. The firewall will 
have a more defined and granular security policy that dictates what services are 
allowed to be accessed, what IP addresses and ranges are to be restricted, and what 
ports can be accessed. The firewall is described as a “choke point” in the network, 
since all communication should flow through it and this is where traffic is inspected 
and restricted. A firewall is actually a type of gateway that can be a router, server, 
authentication server, or specialized hardware device. It monitors packets coming into 
and out of the network it is protecting. It filters out the packets that do not meet the 
requirements of the security policy. It can discard these packets, repackage them, or 
redirect them depending on the firewall configuration and security policy. Packets are 
filtered based on their source and destination addresses and ports, by service, packet 
type, protocol type, header information, sequence bits, and much more. Each vendor has 
different functionality and different parameters they can use for identification and access 
restriction.
Examples of Firewall Implementations
Firewall implementations can take advantage of the functionality available in a variety of 
firewall designs to provide a robust layered approach in protecting an organization’s infor-
mation assets. Commonly used implementations available today include:
• Screened-host firewall: Utilizing a packet filtering router and a bastion host, this approach 
implements basic network layer security (packet filtering) and application server security 
(proxy services). An intruder in this configuration has to penetrate two separate systems 
before the security of the private network can be compromised. This firewall system is 
configured with the bastion host connected to the private network with a packet filtering 
router between the internet and the bastion host. Router filtering rules allow inbound 
traffic to access only the bastion host, which blocks access to internal systems. Since 
the inside hosts reside on the same network as the bastion host, the security policy of 
the organization determines whether inside systems are permitted direct access to the 
internet, or whether they are required to use the proxy services on the bastion host.
• Dual-homed firewall: A firewall system that has two or more network interfaces, each of 
which is connected to a different network. In a firewall configuration, a dual-homed 
firewall usually acts to block or filter some or all of the traffic trying to pass between 
the networks. A dual-homed firewall system is a more restrictive form of a screened-
host firewall system, when a dual-homed bastion host is configured with one interface 
established for information servers and another for private network host computers.
• DMZ or screened-subnet firewall: Utilizing two packet filtering routers and a bastion host, 
this approach creates the most secure firewall system, since it supports both network and 
application-level security while defining a separate DMZ network. The DMZ functions 
as a small isolated network for an organization’s public servers, bastion host information 
servers and modem pools. Typically, DMZs are configured to limit access from the 
internet and the organization’s private network. Incoming traffic access is restricted into 
the DMZ network by the outside router and protects the organization against certain 
attacks by limiting the services available for use. Consequently, external systems can 

624	
11.  Security Component Fundamentals for Assessment
﻿
access only the bastion host (and its proxy service capabilities to internal systems) and 
possibly information servers in the DMZ. The inside router provides a second line of 
defense, managing DMZ access to the private network, while accepting only traffic 
originating from the bastion host. For outbound traffic, the inside router manages private 
network access to the DMZ network. It permits internal systems to access only the 
bastion host and information servers in the DMZ. The filtering rules on the outside router 
require the use of proxy services by accepting only outbound traffic on the bastion host. 
The key benefits of this system are that an intruder must penetrate three separate devices, 
private network addresses are not disclosed to the internet, and internal systems do not 
have direct access to the internet.
Note: In UNIX systems, the product TCP Wrappers can be used as a personal firewall or 
host-based IDS.
The assessor should review and test the following areas when conducting a comprehen-
sive evaluation of the firewall and its technology:
• Scanning firewall from the outside and inside
• Scanning with firewall down to see level of exposure if it went off-line
• Directional control
• Incoming packet with internal source address
• Outgoing packet with external source address
• FTP out but not in
• Making sure that access to the firewall is authorized
• How are employees and nonemployees given access
• Obtaining a list of users on the firewall
• Cross-checking with staff lists/organization chart
• Remote administration:
•	 One-time passwords
•	 Other secure methods
•	 Encrypted link
• How is access changed or revoked
• How is access reviewed:
•	 Mechanics of authentication
•	 Frequency of review
•	 Password reset/changing passwords
•	 Root password control
• Need for firewall to enforce security policy (encryption, viruses, URL blocks, proxy/
packet filter types of traffic):
• The rule set obtained?
•	 How are rule sets stored to maintained to ensure that they have not been tampered 
with?
• Checksums regularly verified?
• Determining whether the effectiveness of firewall has been tested
• Reviewing processes running on firewall; are they appropriate:
• Does the firewall provide adequate notice when an exploit is attempted?

AUDIT AND ACCOUNTING
Most, if not all, of the guidance for the audit and accountability family of controls can be 
found in the SP 800-92, Guide to Log Management.
Log Management
A log is a record of the events occurring within an organization’s systems and networks. 
Logs are composed of log entries; each entry contains information related to a specific event 
that has occurred within a system or network. Many logs within an organization contain 
records related to computer security. These computer security logs are generated by many 
sources, including security software, such as antivirus software, firewalls, and intrusion de-
tection and prevention systems; operating systems on servers, workstations, and networking 
equipment; and applications. Logs are emitted by network devices, operating systems, ap-
plications, and all manner of intelligent or programmable devices. A stream of messages in 
time sequence often comprises the entries in a log. Logs may be directed to files and stored on 
disk, or directed as a network stream to a log collector. Log messages must usually be inter-
preted with respect to the internal state of its source (e.g., application) and announce security-
relevant or operations-relevant events (e.g., a user log-in, or a systems error).
A fundamental problem with log management that occurs in many organizations is ef-
fectively balancing a limited quantity of log management resources with a continuous sup-
ply of log data. Log generation and storage can be complicated by several factors, including 
a high number of log sources; inconsistent log content, formats, and timestamps among 
sources; and increasingly large volumes of log data. Log management also involves protect-
ing the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of logs. Another problem with log man-
agement is ensuring that security, system, and network administrators regularly perform 
effective analysis of log data. This publication provides guidance for meeting these log 
management challenges.
Originally, logs were used primarily for troubleshooting problems, but logs now serve many 
functions within most organizations, such as optimizing system and network performance, 
recording the actions of users, and providing data useful for investigating malicious activity. 
Logs have evolved to contain information related to many different types of events occurring 
within networks and systems. Within an organization, many logs contain records related to 
computer security; common examples of these computer security logs are audit logs that track 
user authentication attempts and security device logs that record possible attacks.
The Special Publication 800-92 defines the criteria for logs, log management, and log main-
tenance in the following control areas:
• Auditable events
• Content of audit records
• Audit storage capacity
• Response to audit processing failures
• Audit review, analysis, and reporting
• Audit reduction and report generation
• Timestamps

626	
11.  Security Component Fundamentals for Assessment
﻿
• Audit record retention
• Audit generation
The SP defines the four parts of log management as follows:
1.	 Log management:
a.	 Log sources.
b.	Analyze log data.
c.	 Respond to identified events.
d.	Manage long-term log data storage.
2.	 Log sources:
a.	 Log generation.
b.	Log storage and disposal.
c.	 Log security.
3.	 Analyzing log data:
a.	 Gain an understanding of logs.
b.	Prioritize log entries.
c.	 Compare system-level and infrastructure-level analysis.
d.	Respond to identified events.
4.	 Manage long-term log data storage:
a.	 Choose log format for data to be archived.
b.	Archive the log data.
c.	 Verify integrity of transferred logs.
d.	Store media securely.
To address AU-10, nonrepudiation, the information system protects against an individual 
falsely denying having performed a particular action. Nonrepudiation protects individuals 
against later claims by an author of not having authored a particular document, a sender of 
not having transmitted a message, a receiver of not having received a message, or a signatory 
of not having signed a document. Nonrepudiation services are obtained by employing vari-
ous techniques or mechanisms (e.g., digital signatures, digital message receipts).
The Digital Signature Standard defines methods for digital signature generation that can 
be used for the protection of binary data (commonly called a message), and for the verifica-
tion and validation of those digital signatures.
There are three techniques which are approved for this process:
1.	 The DSA is specified in this standard. The specification includes criteria for the genera-
tion of domain parameters, for the generation of public and private key pairs, and for the 
generation and verification of digital signatures.
2.	 The RSA DSA is specified in American National Standard (ANS) X9.31 and Public Key 
Cryptography Standard (PKCS) #1. FIPS-186-3 approves the use of implementations of 
either or both of these standards, but specifies additional requirements.
3.	 The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) is specified in ANS X9.62. FIPS-
186-3 approves the use of ECDSA, but specifies additional requirements.
When assessing logs look for the following areas:
• Connections should be logged and monitored.

	
Audit and accounting

﻿
• What events are logged?
-	 Inbound services
-	 Outbound services
-	 Access attempts that violate policy
• How frequent are logs monitored?
-	 Differentiate from automated and manual procedures.
• Alarming:
-	 Security breach response
- Are the responsible parties experienced?
• Monitoring of privileged accounts
SIEM
Security information and event management (SIEM) is a term for software products and 
services combining SIM and security event management (SEM). The segment of security 
management that deals with real-time monitoring, correlation of events, notifications, and 
console views is commonly known as SEM. The second area provides long-term storage, 
analysis, and reporting of log data and is known as SIM.
SIEM technology provides real-time analysis of security alerts generated by network hard-
ware and applications. SIEM is sold as software, appliances, or managed services, and is also 
used to log security data and generate reports for compliance purposes. The term Security 
Information and Event Management (SIEM), coined by Mark Nicolett and Amrit Williams 
of Gartner in 2005, describes the product capabilities of gathering, analyzing, and presenting 
information from network and security devices; identity and access management applica-
tions; vulnerability management and policy compliance tools; operating system, database, 
and application logs; and external threat data. A key focus is to monitor and help manage 
user and service privileges, directory services, and other system configuration changes, as 
well as providing log auditing and review and IR.

Evidence of Assessment
Evidence of the test, evaluation, and assessment activities is often critical to the authoriz-
ing official in making the risk-based decision concerning the operation of the system under 
review. As SP 800-53A states: “Building an effective assurance case for security and privacy 
control effectiveness is a process that involves:
(i)	Compiling evidence from a variety of activities conducted during the system develop-
ment life cycle that the controls employed in the information system are implemented 
correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to 
meeting the security and privacy requirements of the system and the organization; and
(ii)	Presenting this evidence in a manner that decision makers are able to use effectively in 
making risk-based decisions about the operation or use of the system.
The evidence described above comes from the implementation of the security and privacy 
controls in the information system and inherited by the system (i.e., common controls) and 
from the assessments of that implementation. Ideally, the assessor is building on ­previously 
developed materials that started with the specification of the organization’s information 
­security and privacy needs and was further developed during the design, development, and 
implementation of the information system. These materials, developed while implementing 
security and privacy throughout the life cycle of the information system, provide the initial 
evidence for an assurance case.
Assessors obtain the required evidence during the assessment process to allow the 
­appropriate organizational officials to make objective determinations about the effective-
ness of the security and privacy controls and the overall security and privacy state of the 
information system. The assessment evidence needed to make such determinations can be 
obtained from a variety of sources including, for example, information technology product 
and system ­assessments and, in the case of privacy assessments, privacy compliance docu-
mentation such as Privacy Impact Assessments and Privacy Act System of Record Notices. 
Product assessments (also known as product testing, evaluation, and validation) are typically 
conducted by independent, third-party testing organizations. These assessments examine the 
security and privacy functions of products and established configuration settings. Assess-
ments can be conducted to demonstrate compliance to industry, national, or international 
information ­security standards, privacy standards embodied in applicable laws and policies, 
and developer/vendor claims. Since many information technology products are assessed by 
commercial testing organizations and then subsequently deployed in millions of information 

630	
12.  Evidence of Assessment
﻿
systems, these types of assessments can be carried out at a greater level of depth and provide 
deeper insights into the security and privacy capabilities of the particular products.”1
In order to properly gain all the necessary evidence of the proper functioning of the sys-
tem along with its critical security objectives being met, the assessor often obtains artifacts 
and evidence from the product review cycle received during acquisition of the security 
component.
Organizations obtain security assurance by the actions taken by information system developers, ­implementers, 
operators, maintainers, and assessors. Actions by individuals and/or groups during the ­development/­operation 
of information systems produce security evidence that contributes to the assurance, or measures of confidence, 
in the security functionality needed to deliver the security capability. The depth and coverage of these actions 
(as described below) also contribute to the efficacy of the evidence and measures of confidence. The evidence 
produced by developers, implementers, operators, assessors, and maintainers during the system development 
life cycle (e.g., design/development artifacts, assessment results, warranties, and certificates of evaluation/­
validation) contributes to the understanding of the security controls implemented by organizations.
The strength of security functionality (The security strength of an information system component (i.e., hard-
ware, software, or firmware) is determined by the degree to which the security functionality implemented within 
that component is correct, complete, resistant to direct attacks (strength of mechanism), and resistant to bypass 
or tampering.) plays an important part in being able to achieve the needed security capability and subsequently 
satisfying the security requirements of organizations. Information system developers can increase the strength 
of security functionality by employing as part of the hardware/software/firmware development process:
(i)	 Well-defined security policies and policy models;
(ii)	 Structured/rigorous design and development techniques; and
(iii)	 Sound system/security engineering principles.
The artifacts generated by these development activities (e.g., functional specifications, high-level/low-
level designs, implementation representations [source code and hardware schematics], the results from static/
dynamic testing and code analysis) can provide important evidence that the information systems (including 
the components that compose those systems) will be more reliable and trustworthy. Security evidence can also 
be generated from security testing conducted by independent, accredited, third-party assessment organiza-
tions (e.g., Common Criteria Testing Laboratories, Cryptographic/Security Testing Laboratories, FedRAMP 
3PAO’s, and other assessment activities by government and private sector organizations).
In addition to the evidence produced in the development environment, organizations can produce evi-
dence from the operational environment that contributes to the assurance of functionality and ultimately, se-
curity capability. Operational evidence includes, for example, flaw reports, records of remediation ­actions, the 
results of security incident reporting, and the results of organizational continuous monitoring activities. Such 
evidence helps to determine the effectiveness of deployed security controls, changes to information systems 
and environments of operation, and compliance with federal legislation, policies, ­directives, regulations, and 
standards. Security evidence, whether obtained from development or operational activities, provides a bet-
ter understanding of security controls implemented and used by organizations. Together, the actions taken 
during the system development life cycle by developers, implementers, operators, maintainers, and assessors 
and the evidence produced as part of those actions, help organizations to determine the extent to which the 
security functionality within their information systems is implemented correctly, operating as intended, and 
producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting stated security requirements and enforcing or medi-
ating established security policies—thus providing greater confidence in the security capability.2
With regard to the security evidence produced, the depth and coverage of such evidence can affect the level 
of assurance in the functionality implemented. Depth and coverage are attributes associated with assessment 
methods and the generation of security evidence. Assessment methods can be applied to developmental and 
2SP 800-53, rev. 4, p. 22–23.

operational assurance. For developmental assurance, depth is associated with the rigor, level of detail, and 
formality of the artifacts produced during the design and development of the hardware, software, and firm-
ware components of information systems (e.g., functional specifications, high-level design, low-level design, 
source code). The level of detail available in development artifacts can affect the type of testing, evaluation, and 
analysis conducted during the system development life cycle (e.g., black-box testing, gray-box testing, white-
box testing, static/dynamic analysis). For operational assurance, the depth attribute addresses the number and 
types of assurance-related security controls selected and implemented. In contrast, the coverage attribute is 
associated with the assessment methods employed during development and operations, addressing the scope 
and breadth of assessment objects included in the assessments (e.g., number/types of tests conducted on source 
code, number of software modules reviewed, number of network nodes/mobile devices scanned for vulner-
abilities, number of individuals interviewed to check basic understanding of contingency responsibilities).3
TYPES OF EVIDENCE
It is recognized that organizations can specify, document, and configure their information systems in a 
­variety of ways, and that the content and applicability of existing assessment evidence will vary. This may 
­result in the need to apply a variety of assessment methods to various assessment objects to generate the assess-
ment evidence needed to determine whether the security or privacy controls are effective in their application.4
Assessment, testing, and auditing evidence is the basis on which an auditor or assessor 
expresses their opinion on the security operations of the firm being assessed. Assessors obtain 
such evidence from tests that determine how well security controls work (called “compliance 
tests”) and tests of confidentiality, integrity, and availability details such as completeness and 
disclosure of information (called “substantive tests”).
The results of substantive testing would include existence, rights and obligations, occurrence, 
completeness, valuation, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of a particular transaction 
of security control in action. Therefore, there are many mechanisms by which the assessor gains 
the appropriate evidence for the evaluation. These include those given in the next subsections.
Physical Examination/Inspection
Inspection involves examining records or documents, whether internal or external, in 
­paper form, electronic form, or other media, or physically examining an asset. Inspection of 
records and documents provides audit evidence of varying degrees of reliability, depend-
ing on their nature and source and, in the case of internal records and documents, on the 
­effectiveness of the controls over their production. An example of inspection used as a test of 
controls is inspection of records for evidence of authorization.
• Inspection or count by the auditor of a tangible asset:
•	 This involves verifying the existence of an asset and the condition of the asset. It 
is important to record the asset name or model, serial number, or product ID, and 
compare it to the asset register.
• Different from examining documentation is that the asset has inherent value.

﻿
Inspection of records is often used because the reliability of the records depends on the source. Information 
obtained directly from the system is more reliable than information obtained from the system and then cus-
tomized by the auditee. For example, most system administrators would rather purge backup status results 
every three months due to system capabilities. The intention is to free up server space. They usually record the 
backup results in a spreadsheet that they retain to show that the control has been operating throughout the 
year. An example of such a form is depicted in figure 2.
The information in figure 2 is less reliable than if the system administrator had saved the results in PDF 
format in a folder and recorded the data only for monitoring purposes. Using figure 2 would enable confirma-
tion of the recordings. [1]
Confirmation
A confirmation response represents a particular form of audit evidence obtained by the 
auditor from a third party in accordance with Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
(PCAOB) standards (used in financial and corporate environments). Confirmation is the re-
ceipt of a written or oral response from an independent third party. The assessor has an orga-
nizational request that the third party respond directly to the assessor.
Confirmation, by definition, is the receipt of a written or oral response from an indepen-
dent third party verifying information requested by the assessor. Because of the indepen-
dence of the third party, confirmations are a highly desirable, though costly, type of evidence. 
Some audit standards describe two types of confirmations.
A positive confirmation asks the respondent to provide an answer in all circumstances, 
while a negative confirmation asks for a response only if the information is incorrect. As you 
might predict, negative confirmations are not as competent as positive confirmations. Note

that SAS 67, Audit Standard, requires confirmation of a sample of accounts receivable due to 
the materiality of receivables for most companies. Note the provision that confirmations must 
be under the control of the auditor for maximum reliability of the evidence.
Confirmation is often viewed as audit evidence that is from an external independent source 
and is more creditable than evidence from an internal source. Most financial auditors confirm 
balances (e.g., creditor’s balances and debtor’s balances) by sending out confirmation letters 
to external independent sources such as banks and vendors.
However, in the majority of IT audits, audit evidence is derived from the system configura-
tions. Configurations obtained by an auditor through observation of the system or via a reli-
able audit software tool are more reliable than data received from the auditee.
Documentation
Documentation consists of the organization’s business documents used to support security 
and accounting events. The strength of documentation is that it is prevalent and available at 
a low cost. Documents can be internal or externally generated. Internal documents provide 
less reliable evidence than external ones, particularly if the client’s internal control is suspect. 
Documents that are external and have been prepared by qualified individuals such as attor-
neys or insurance brokers provide additional reliability. The use of documentation in support 
of a client’s transactions is called vouching.
Documentation review criteria include three areas of focus:
1.	 Review is used for the “generalized” level of rigor, that is, a high-level examination look-
ing for required content and for any obvious errors, omissions, or inconsistencies.
2.	 Study is used for the “focused” level of rigor, that is, an examination that includes the 
intent of “review” and adds a more in-depth examination for greater evidence to support 
a determination of whether the document has the required content and is free of errors, 
omissions, and inconsistencies.
3.	 Analyze is used for the “detailed” level of rigor, that is, an examination that includes 
the intent of both “review” and “study,” adding a thorough and detailed analysis for 
significant grounds for confidence in the determination of whether required content is 
present and the document is correct, complete, and consistent.
Analytical Procedures
Analytical procedures consist of evaluations of financial information made by a study of plau-
sible relationships among both financial and nonfinancial data. They also encompass the inves-
tigation of significant differences from expected amounts. Recalculation consists of checking the 
mathematical accuracy of documents or records. It may be performed manually or electronically.
Analytical procedures are comparisons of account balances and relationships as a check on 
reasonableness. They are required during the planning and completion phases of all audits 
and may be used for the following purposes:
1.	 To better understand the organizational business and mission objectives
2.	 To assess the organization’s ability to continue as a going concern
3.	 To indicate the possibility of misstatements (“unusual fluctuations”) in the organizational 
documented statements
4.	 To reduce the need for detailed assessment testing

12.  Evidence of Assessment
﻿
One of the primary ways that assessors and testers verify large system functioning and 
activities is through the use of sampling.
Sampling
Sampling is an audit procedure that tests less than 100 percent of the population. There are different types 
of sampling methods that an IS auditor can apply to gather sufficient evidence to address the audit objectives 
and the rate of risk identified. Sampling methods can be statistical or nonstatistical. Statistical sampling in-
volves deriving the sample quantitatively. The statistical methods commonly used are random sampling and 
systematic sampling. Nonstatistical sampling involves deriving the sample qualitatively. Commonly used 
nonstatistical methods are haphazard and judgmental sampling.
The sampling size applied depends on the type of control being tested, the frequency of the control and the 
effectiveness of the design and implementation of the control.
Type of Controls and Sample Size
The following are the two types of controls:
• Automated controls—Automated controls generally require one sample. It is assumed that if a program 
can execute a task—for example, successfully calculate a car allowance due based on a base percentage of an 
employee’s salary—and the program coding has not been changed, the system should apply the same for-
mula to the rest of the population. Therefore, testing one instance is sufficient for the rest of the population. 
The same is true for the reverse; if the system incorrectly calculates the allowance, the error is extrapolated 
to the rest of the population.
• Manual controls—Depending on which sampling method an IS auditor uses to calculate the sample size, 
the following factors should be taken into consideration to determine the sample size:
1.	 Reliance placed on the control
2.	 The risk associated with control
3.	 The frequency of the control occurrence
Examples of manual controls include review of audit log monitoring, review of user authorization access 
forms, and review of daily IT procedures, server monitoring procedure and help-desk functions. Figure 3 
provides examples of IT controls, the technique that can be used to gather evidence and the sampling method 
that can be used.

	
Types of evidence	
635
﻿
Quality evidence collected during the audit process enhances the overall quality of the work performed 
and significantly reduces audit risk. Failure to collect quality evidence may result in the auditor or company 
facing litigation, loss of reputation and loss of clientele. It is important to ensure that the audit evidence ob-
tained from the auditee is of high quality and supports the understanding of the IT control environment. [1]
Here are the types of evidence that are typically sampled:
• Tangible assets: If, for example, a business states that it owns 300 company cars. You do 
not hunt down all 300 cars; you just select a sample of the cars to track down to verify 
their existence.
• Records or documents: Records or documents are also known as source materials, and they 
are the materials on which the numbers in financial statements are based. For example, 
the amount of sales that a financial statement represents is derived from the data on 
customer invoices, which in this case is your sampling unit.
• Reperformance: This term refers to checking the sampling work the client has already 
done. For example, company policy dictates that no employee is paid unless he or she has 
turned in a timesheet. The client states that this rule is in use for 100% of all paychecks. 
You can test this client assertion by taking a sample of payroll checks and matching them 
to the timesheets.
• Recalculation: This term refers to checking the mathematical accuracy of figures and totals 
on a document. For example, a sample may have three columns: cost per item, items 
ordered, and total. You perform recalculation if you verify the figures on the invoice by 
multiplying cost per item times items ordered and making sure the figure equals the 
total.
• Confirmation: This term refers to getting account balance verification from unrelated third 
parties. A good example is sending letters to customers or vendors of the business to 
verify accounts receivable or accounts payable balances.
Interviews of the Users/Developers/Customers
Questions of users, key personnel, system owners, and other relevant personnel in the 
organization are often used as a starting point to determine the proper use of and imple-
mentation of controls. Interviews are the process of holding discussions with individuals or 
groups of individuals within an organization to, once again, facilitate assessor understand-
ing, achieve clarification, or obtain evidence.
Typically, the interviews are conducted with agency heads, chief information officers, se-
nior agency information security officers, authorizing officials, information owners, informa-
tion system and mission owners, information system security officers, information system se-
curity managers, personnel officers, human resource managers, facilities managers, training 
officers, information system operators, network and system administrators, site managers, 
physical security officers, and users.
Often questionnaire are used to gather data by allowing the IS personnel to answer pre-
determined questions. This technique is usually used to collect data during the planning 
phase of the audit. Information gathered through this process has to be corroborated through 
additional testing. Inquiry alone is regarded as the least creditable audit evidence. This is es-
pecially true if the source of the information is from the auditee who performs or supervises 
the function about which one is inquiring. If inquiry is the only way to get the evidence, it is 

636	
12.  Evidence of Assessment
﻿
advisable to corroborate the inquiry with an independent source. If one is auditing propri-
etary software and the IT officer has no access to the source code and cannot demonstrate 
from the system configurations that there were no upgrades carried out in the year under 
review, one can corroborate the inquiry with the users of the applications. Although inquiry 
is the least creditable when carrying out control adequacy testing, it is deemed sufficient dur-
ing the planning stage.
SP 800-53A does provide some guidance for the interview process and the detail of how 
in-depth the interviews should be conducted as follows:
The depth attribute addresses the rigor of and level of detail in the interview process. There are three pos-
sible values for the depth attribute:
(i)	 Basic; Basic interview: Interview that consists of broad-based, high-level discussions with individuals or 
groups of individuals. This type of interview is conducted using a set of generalized, high-level ques-
tions. Basic interviews provide a level of understanding of the security and privacy controls necessary for 
determining whether the controls are implemented and free of obvious errors.
(ii)	 Focused; and Focused interview: Interview that consists of broad-based, high-level discussions and more 
in-depth discussions in specific areas with individuals or groups of individuals. This type of interview 
is conducted using a set of generalized, high-level questions and more in-depth questions in specific 
areas where responses indicate a need for more in-depth investigation. Focused interviews provide 
a level of understanding of the security and privacy controls necessary for determining whether the 
controls are implemented and free of obvious errors and whether there are increased grounds for confi-
dence that the controls are implemented correctly and operating as intended.
(iii)	 Comprehensive. Comprehensive interview: Interview that consists of broad-based, high-level discussions 
and more in-depth, probing discussions in specific areas with individuals or groups of individuals. This 
type of interview is conducted using a set of generalized, high-level questions and more in-depth, prob-
ing questions in specific areas where responses indicate a need for more in-depth investigation. Com-
prehensive interviews provide a level of understanding of the security and privacy controls necessary 
for determining whether the controls are implemented and free of obvious errors and whether there are 
further increased grounds for confidence that the controls are implemented correctly and operating as 
intended on an ongoing and consistent basis, and that there is support for continuous improvement in 
the effectiveness of the controls.5
SP 800-53A does provide some guidance for the interview process and the detail of how 
much should be covered in the interviews as follows:
The coverage attribute addresses the scope or breadth of the interview process and includes the types of 
individuals to be interviewed (by organizational role and associated responsibility), the number of individu-
als to be interviewed (by type), and specific individuals to be interviewed. The organization, considering a 
variety of factors (e.g., available resources, importance of the assessment, the organization’s overall assess-
ment goals and objectives), confers with assessors and provides direction on the type, number, and specific 
individuals to be interviewed for the particular attribute value described.
There are three possible values for the coverage attribute:
(i)	 Basic; Basic interview: Interview that uses a representative sample of individuals in key organizational 
roles to provide a level of coverage necessary for determining whether the security and privacy controls 
are implemented and free of obvious errors.
(ii)	 Focused; and Focused interview: Interview that uses a representative sample of individuals in key or-
ganizational roles and other specific individuals deemed particularly important to achieving the

­assessment objective to provide a level of coverage necessary for determining whether the security and 
privacy controls are implemented and free of obvious errors and whether there are increased grounds 
for confidence that the controls are implemented correctly and operating as intended.
(iii)	 Comprehensive. Comprehensive interview: Interview that uses a sufficiently large sample of individuals 
in key organizational roles and other specific individuals deemed particularly important to achieving 
the assessment objective to provide a level of coverage necessary for determining whether the security 
and privacy controls are implemented and free of obvious errors and whether there are further increased 
grounds for confidence that the controls are implemented correctly and operating as intended on an on-
going and consistent basis, and that there is support for continuous improvement in the effectiveness 
of the controls.5
Reuse of Previous Work
Reuse of assessment results from previously accepted or approved assessments is considered in the body 
of evidence for determining overall security or privacy control effectiveness. Previously accepted or approved 
assessments include:
(i)	 Those assessments of common controls that are managed by the organization and support multiple infor-
mation systems; or
(ii)	 Assessments of security or privacy controls that are reviewed as part of the control implementation.
The acceptability of using previous assessment results in a security control assessment or privacy control 
assessment is coordinated with and approved by the users of the assessment results. It is essential that infor-
mation system owners and common control providers collaborate with authorizing officials and other ap-
propriate organizational officials in determining the acceptability of using previous assessment results. When 
considering the reuse of previous assessment results and the value of those results to the current assessment, 
assessors determine:
(i)	 The credibility of the assessment evidence;
(ii)	 The appropriateness of previous analysis; and
(iii)	 The applicability of the assessment evidence to current information system operating conditions.
If previous assessment results are reused, the date of the original assessment and type of assessment are 
documented in the security assessment plan or privacy assessment plan and security assessment report or 
privacy assessment report.
The following items are considered in validating previous assessment results for reuse:
• Changing conditions associated with security controls and privacy controls over time. Security and 
privacy controls that were deemed effective during previous assessments may have become ineffective 
due to changing conditions within the information system or its environment of operation. Assessment 
results that were found to be previously acceptable may no longer provide credible evidence for the 
determination of security or privacy control effectiveness, and therefore, a reassessment would be re-
quired. Applying previous assessment results to a current assessment necessitates the identification of 
any changes that have occurred since the previous assessment and the impact of these changes on the 
previous results.
• Amount of time that has transpired since previous assessments. In general, as the time period between 
current and previous assessments increases, the credibility and utility of the previous assessment results 
decrease. This is primarily due to the fact that the information system or the environment in which the 
information system operates is more likely to change with the passage of time, possibly invalidating the 
original conditions or assumptions on which the previous assessment was based.
• Degree of independence of previous assessments. Assessor independence can be a critical factor in 
certain types of assessments. The degree of independence required from assessment to assessment 

638	
12.  Evidence of Assessment
﻿
should be consistent. For example, it is not appropriate to reuse results from a previous self-assessment 
where no assessor independence was required, in a current assessment requiring a greater degree of 
­independence.6
Automatic Test Results
Scanners, integrity checkers, and automated test environments are all examples of these 
types of outputs which are used by the assessors. Scanning reviews typically involve search-
ing for large or unusual items to detect error in the results from the scans. For example, if there 
is a maximum or minimum loan amount, one can scan through the loan book for amounts 
outside the stated range. Configuration compliance checkers perform a process of reviewing 
system configuration and user account details through the use of manual or utility tools/
scripts, which are available freely online, developed in-house, or obtained off the shelf on 
the market. The available software includes, but is not limited to, Microsoft Baseline Security 
Analyzer (free), DumpSec (free), IDEA examiner, ACL CaseWare, and in-house-developed 
scripts. Alternatively, the assessor can read system manuals for the system being audited for 
guidance on how to retrieve system configurations and user accounts manually. For example, 
to get administrator access on a Windows 2003 server, the IS auditor would follow the follow-
ing procedure: start → administrative tools → active directory users and computers → built 
in → select administrator → right click → select properties → select member.
Recalculation consists of checking the mathematical accuracy of documents or records. 
It may be performed manually or electronically. Automated testing tools are computer pro-
grams that run in a Windows environment, which can be used to test evidence that is in a 
machine-readable format. Additionally, there is software available that can be used to man-
age the assessment documentation and network sharing of files among the assessment team.
A common technique used during assessments is called data interrogation; this is a process 
of analyzing data usually through the use of Computer-Aided Audit Tools (CAATs). General-
ized audit software can be embedded within an application to review transactions as they are 
being processed, and exception reports showing variances or anomalies are produced and used 
for further audit investigations. The most commonly used CAAT method involves download-
ing data from an application and analyzing it with software such as ACL and IDEA. Some of 
the tests include journal testing, application input and output integrity checks (e.g., duplicate 
numbers), gaps on invoices/purchase orders, and summarization of vendors by amounts paid.
In other portions of this handbook, I go into great detail about automated testing so it is 
unnecessary to further expand this area.
Observation
Observation consists of looking at a process or procedure being performed by others, for 
example, the auditor’s observation of inventory counting by the company’s personnel or the 
performance of control activities. Observation can provide audit evidence about the perfor-
mance of a process or procedure, but the evidence is limited to the point in time at which the 
observation takes place and also is limited by the fact that the act of being observed may affect 
how the process or procedure is performed.
6SP 800-53A, rev. 4, IPD, p. 19–21.

	
Documentation requirements

﻿
It is suggested that observation should be carried out by two assessors. This is to cor-
roborate what the assessor observed and to avoid instances in which management refutes 
the findings of the observation. In addition, observation is key in establishing segregation of 
duties. When assessing, where possible, the assessor should spend some time with the orga-
nizational administrators. This will afford the assessor the opportunity to see exactly what is 
happening, not what should happen.
SP 800-53A defines three methods for conducting detailed observations while examining 
security controls as follows:
1.	 Observe is used for the “generalized” level of rigor, that is, watching the execution of an 
activity or process or looking directly at a mechanism (as opposed to reading documenta-
tion produced by someone other than the assessor about that mechanism) for the purpose 
of seeing whether the activity or mechanism appears to operate as intended (or in the 
case of a mechanism, perhaps is configured as intended) and whether there are any obvi-
ous errors, omissions, or inconsistencies in the operation or configuration.
2.	 Inspect is used for the “focused” level of rigor, that is, adding to the watching associated 
with “observe” an active investigation to gain further grounds for confidence in the 
determination of whether the activity or mechanism is operating as intended and is free 
of errors, omissions, or inconsistencies.
3.	 Analyze, while not currently used in the assessment cases for activities and mechanisms, 
is available for use for the “detailed” level of rigor, that is, adding to the watching 
and investigation of “observe” and “inspect” a thorough and detailed analysis of the 
information to develop significant grounds for confidence in the determination as 
to whether the activity or mechanism is operating as intended and is free of errors, 
omissions, or inconsistencies. Analysis achieves this both by leading to further 
observations and inspections and by a greater understanding of the information obtained 
from the examination.
DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
The process of documenting the assessment evidence is usually determined by the criteria 
needed to provide the support documentation to the authorizing official as they make their 
risk-based decisions concerning the system under review. Multiple types of evidence docu-
mentation are produced during the assessment process, as well as actual Assessment Artifact 
documents. Each of these pieces of documentation require the assessor to identify it, correlate 
it to the assessment plan step it is relevant to, and determine how it supports the findings and 
recommendations in the Security Assessment Report (SAR). The SAR is the primary docu-
ment resulting from the assessment and we will discuss that specific document and its sup-
porting artifacts in the next chapter.
Documentation is the principal record of testing and assessment procedures applied, evi-
dence obtained, and conclusions reached by the assessor. Often evidence is documented in 
what are known as audit working papers. Audit working papers achieve following objectives:
• Aid in the planning, performance, and review of audit work
• Provide the principal support for audit report and conclusions

640	
12.  Evidence of Assessment
﻿
• Facilitate third-party/supervisory reviews
Using work papers, a common auditing methodology, provides the following advantages:
• Provides a basis for evaluating the internal audit activity’s quality control program
• Documents whether engagement objectives were achieved
• Supports the accuracy and completeness of the work performed
There are two types of work papers used in today’s processes. They are as follows:
1.	 Permanent file: Information that is relevant for multiple years on recurring engagements
2.	 Current file: Information relevant for a given assessment for a particular assessment pe-
riod
Key characteristics of work papers are as follows:
1.	 Complete: Each work paper should be completely self-standing and self-explanatory. All 
questions must be answered; all points raised by the reviewer must be cleared and a logi-
cal, well-thought-out conclusion reached for each assessment segment.
2.	 Concise: Audit work papers and items included on each work paper should be relevant to 
meeting the applicable assessment objective. Work papers must be confined to those that 
serve a useful purpose.
3.	 Accurate: High-quality work papers include statements and computations that are 
accurate and technically correct.
4.	 Organized: Work papers should have a logical system of numbering and a reader-friendly 
layout so a technically competent person unfamiliar with the project could understand 
the purpose, procedures performed, and results.
Work papers should include the following key elements:
• Name of assessment area.
• Source: The name and title of the individual providing the documentation should be 
recorded to facilitate future follow-up questions or assessment.
• Scope: The nature, timing, and extent of procedures performed should be included on 
each work paper for completeness.
• Reference: A logical work paper number cross-referenced to assessment plan steps and 
issues should be included.
• Sign-off: The preparer’s signature provides evidence of completion and accountability, 
which is an essential piece of third-party quality review.
• Exceptions: Assessment exceptions should be documented and explained clearly on each 
work paper using logical numbering that cross-reference to other work papers.
Trustworthiness
The purpose of the development and production of the assessor evidence is to build the 
trustworthiness for the authorizing official of the assessment results and conclusions pro-
vided by the security control assessor. Additionally, the trustworthiness is then built of the 
operating organization and the system owner in their operational status reporting and ongo-
ing continuous monitoring activities which the authorizing official is participating in during

normal operations of the system under review. As SP 800-53A shows us in the following 
diagram, the security evidence gathered during the assessment process provides the ultimate 
trustworthiness evaluation criteria for the system owner, authorizing official, and the opera-
tional managers to use to run and operate the system under review:

Reporting
I often explain to interested people and my students that the number 1 job of any secu-
rity professional is the secure the data and the number 2 job is to “report, report, and report 
again.” We often have to spend a great deal of time and effort in gathering the data for and 
producing various different kinds of reports and documents to support our security efforts. 
The various reporting requirements often are externally provided to the assessor via compli-
ance needs, external agency needs, or internal department needs. Each component needing 
the assessor report has a distinct and, I hope, clearly defined method for reporting along with 
the data and results necessary for the report to contain:
1.	 SAR
2.	 Rescue and Recovery (RAR)
3.	 Artifacts as reports
4.	 Public Inquiry and Response (PIAR)
5.	 Remediation actions
6.	 Plant Operation and Maintenance (PO&Ms)
The primary purpose of the security and privacy assessment reports is to convey the results of the security 
and privacy control assessments to appropriate organizational officials. The security assessment report is 
included in the security authorization package along with the security plan (including an updated risk assess-
ment), and the plan of action and milestones to provide authorizing officials with the information necessary to 
make risk-based decisions on whether to place an information system into operation or continue its operation. 
Organizations may choose to include similar privacy-related artifacts in the authorization package to convey 
essential information to authorizing officials. All issues associated with compliance to privacy-related legisla-
tion, directives, regulations, or policies are coordinated with the Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/
Chief Privacy Officer. As the assessment and authorization process becomes more dynamic in nature, relying 
to a greater degree on the continuous monitoring aspects of the process as an integrated and tightly coupled 
part of the system development life cycle, the ability to update the security and privacy assessment reports 
frequently becomes a critical aspect of information security and privacy programs.
It is important to emphasize the relationship, described in Special Publication 800-37, among the three 
key documents in the authorization package (i.e., the security plan, the security assessment report, and the 
plan of action and milestones). It is these documents that provide the most reliable indication of the overall 
security state of the information system and the ability of the system to protect to the degree necessary, the 
organization’s operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. Updates to these key 
documents are provided on an ongoing basis in accordance with the continuous monitoring program estab-
lished by the organization. Updates to similar privacy-related documents occur at a frequency and format 
determined by the SAOP in coordination with authorizing officials.

The security and privacy assessment reports provide a disciplined and structured approach for document-
ing the findings of the assessor and the recommendations for correcting any weaknesses or deficiencies in 
the security and privacy controls. This appendix provides a template for reporting the results from security 
and privacy control assessments. Organizations are not restricted to the specific template format; however, 
it is anticipated that the overall report of an assessment will include similar information to that detailed in 
the template for each security and privacy control assessed, preceded by a summary providing the list of all 
security and privacy controls assessed and the overall status of each control.1
KEY ELEMENTS FOR ASSESSMENT REPORTING
The following elements are included in security and privacy assessment reports:
• Information system name
• Security categorization
• Site(s) assessed and assessment date(s)
• Assessor’s name/identification
• Previous assessment results (if reused)
• Security/privacy control or control enhancement designator
• Selected assessment methods and objects
• Depth and coverage attributes values
• Assessment finding summary (indicating satisfied or other than satisfied)
• Assessor comments (weaknesses or deficiencies noted)
• Assessor recommendations (priorities, remediation, corrective actions, or improvements)
THE ASSESSMENT FINDINGS
Each determination statement executed by an assessor results in one of the following 
­findings:
1.	 Satisfied (S)
2.	 Other than satisfied (O)
During an actual security and privacy control assessment, the assessment findings, 
comments, and recommendations are documented on appropriate organization-defined 
reporting forms. Organizations are encouraged to develop standard templates for reporting 
that contain the key elements for assessment reporting described above. Whenever pos-
sible, automation is used to make assessment data collection and reporting cost-effective, 
timely, and efficient.

SECURITY ASSESSMENT REPORT
The results of the security control assessment, including recommendations for correcting any weaknesses 
or deficiencies in the controls, are documented in the security assessment report. The security assessment report 
is one of three key documents in the security authorization package developed for authorizing officials. The 
assessment report includes information from the assessor necessary to determine the effectiveness of the secu-
rity controls employed within or inherited by the information system based upon the assessor’s findings. The 
security assessment report is an important factor in an authorizing official’s determination of risk to organi-
zational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. Security control assessment 
results are documented at a level of detail appropriate for the assessment in accordance with the reporting 
format prescribed by organizational and/or federal policies. The reporting format is also appropriate for the 
type of security control assessment conducted (e.g., developmental testing and evaluation, self-assessments, 
independent verification and validation, independent assessments supporting the security authorization pro-
cess or subsequent reauthorizations, assessments during continuous monitoring, assessments subsequent to 
remediation actions, independent audits/evaluations).
Security control assessment results obtained during system development are brought forward in an in-
terim report and included in the final security assessment report. This supports the concept that the security 
assessment report is an evolving document that includes assessment results from all relevant phases of the 
system development life cycle including the results generated during continuous monitoring. Organizations 
may choose to develop an executive summary from the detailed findings that are generated during a security 
control assessment. An executive summary provides an authorizing official with an abbreviated version of 
the assessment report focusing on the highlights of the assessment, synopsis of key findings, and/or recom-
mendations for addressing weaknesses and deficiencies in the security controls.2

Appendix A: Detailed Security Assessment Results
This SAR covers the full scope of the SCA activities defined in SP 800-37 and in this book, 
so the report should reflect all of the activities the SCA took during the assessment.
RISK ASSESSMENT REPORT
The essential elements of information in a risk assessment can be described in three sections of the risk 
assessment report (or whatever vehicle is chosen by organizations to convey the results of the assessment):
(i)	
An executive summary;
(ii)	
The main body containing detailed risk assessment results; and
(iii)	
Supporting appendices.
A.	 Executive Summary
•	List the date of the risk assessment.
•	Summarize the purpose of the risk assessment.
• Describe the scope of the risk assessment.
-	 For Tier 1 and Tier 2 risk assessments, identify: organizational governance structures or processes as-
sociated with the assessment (e.g., risk executive [function], budget process, acquisition process, sys-
tems engineering process, enterprise architecture, information security architecture, organizational 
missions/business functions, mission/business processes, information systems supporting the mis-
sion/business processes).
-	 For Tier 3 risk assessments, identify: the information system name and location(s), security categori-
zation, and information system (i.e., authorization) boundary.
•	State whether this is an initial or subsequent risk assessment. If a subsequent risk assessment, state 
the circumstances that prompted the update and include a reference to the previous Risk Assessment 
Report.
• Describe the overall level of risk (e.g., Very Low, Low, Moderate, High, or Very High).

﻿
B.	 Body of the Report
• Describe the purpose of the risk assessment, including questions to be answered by the assessment. For 
example:
-	 How the use of a specific information technology would potentially change the risk to organiza-
tional missions/business functions if employed in information systems supporting those missions/­
business functions; or
-	 How the risk assessment results are to be used in the context of the RMF (e.g., an initial risk assess-
ment to be used in tailoring security control baselines and/or to guide and inform other decisions 
and serve as a starting point for subsequent risk assessments; subsequent risk assessment to incor-
porate results of security control assessments and inform authorization decisions; subsequent risk 
assessment to support the analysis of alternative courses of action for risk responses; subsequent 
risk assessment based on risk monitoring to identify new threats or vulnerabilities; subsequent risk 
assessments to incorporate knowledge gained from incidents or attacks).
•	Identify assumptions and constraints.
• Describe risk tolerance inputs to the risk assessment (including the range of consequences to be consid-
ered).
•	Identify and describe the risk model and analytic approach; provide a reference or include as an ap-
pendix, identifying risk factors, value scales, and algorithms for combining values.
•	Provide a rationale for any risk-related decisions during the risk assessment process.
• Describe the uncertainties within the risk assessment process and how those uncertainties influence 
decisions.
•	If the risk assessment includes organizational missions/business functions, describe the missions/
functions (e.g., mission/business processes supporting the missions/functions, interconnections and 
dependencies among related missions/business functions, and information technology that supports 
the missions/business functions).
•	If the risk assessment includes organizational information systems, describe the systems (e.g., mis-
sions/business functions the system is supporting, information flows to/from the systems, and depen-
dencies on other systems, shared services, or common infrastructures).
•	Summarize risk assessment results (e.g., using tables or graphs), in a form that enables decision makers 
to quickly understand the risk (e.g., number of threat events for different combinations of likelihood 
and impact, the relative proportion of threat events at different risk levels).
•	Identify the time frame for which the risk assessment is valid (i.e., time frame for which the assessment 
is intended to support decisions).
•	List the risks due to adversarial threats (see Table F-1).
•	List the risks due to non-adversarial threats (see Table F-2).
C.	 Appendices
•	List references and sources of information.
•	List the team or individuals conducting the risk assessment including contact information.
• List risk assessment details and any supporting evidence (e.g., Tables D-7, D-8, E-5, F-3, F-6, H-4), as 
needed to understand and enable reuse of results (e.g., for reciprocity, for subsequent risk assessments, 
to serve as input to Tier 1 and Tier 2 risk assessments).3
With the redesign of SP 800-30, revision 1, the RAR is not always a deliverable item for 
RMF activities, but often is used to supplement ongoing remediation efforts and major 
change analysis efforts for system. Additionally, RAR process reports are used when threat 
environments or operational environments are changed with respect to the system under 
review.

ARTIFACTS AS REPORTS
Often the development and production of assessment artifacts creates reports and deliv-
erables of their own, and these documents become part of the supplemental and supporting 
information that goes with the authorization package to the Authorizing Official (AO) and 
Authorizing Official Designated Representative (AODR) for review and approval. Items such 
as Vulnerability Scan Reports, Configuration Change Request Installation Reports, and Con-
tingency Plan Test Results all are used in both cases: as support for authorization package and 
as security report deliverables.
PRIVACY IMPACT ASSESSMENT REPORT
Privacy reporting usually entails two different kinds of reporting criteria. First type in-
volves the actual reporting of the Personally Identifiable Information (PII) on the system un-
der review. Types of data collected and retained and their security and privacy requirements 
are defined in these types of reports. The second type of report is the status reporting needed 
for governmental agencies to give external organizations, such as Congress, a view of PII and 
privacy in each agency.
The format and data requirements for Privacy Assessment Reports are agency and gover-
nance based and vary for each agency. If you have any questions, typically you should con-
tact your agency Privacy Office, since federal law requires each agency to have such an office.
Remember, Appendix J of SP 800-53, rev. 4, has a listing of all the privacy controls and their 
requirements now mandated for all agencies by OMB.
REMEDIATION EFFORTS DURING AND SUBSEQUENT 
TO ASSESSMENT
The security assessment report provides visibility into specific weaknesses and deficiencies in the security 
controls employed within or inherited by the information system that could not reasonably be resolved during 
system development or that are discovered post-development. Such weaknesses and deficiencies are potential 
vulnerabilities if exploitable by a threat source. The findings generated during the security control assessment 
provide important information that facilitates a disciplined and structured approach to mitigating risks in 
accordance with organizational priorities. An updated assessment of risk (either formal or informal) based 
on the results of the findings produced during the security control assessment and any inputs from the risk 
executive (function), helps to determine the initial remediation actions and the prioritization of such actions. 
Information system owners and common control providers, in collaboration with selected organizational offi-
cials (e.g., information system security engineer, authorizing official designated representative, chief informa-
tion officer, senior information security officer, information owner/steward), may decide, based on an initial 
or updated assessment of risk, that certain findings are inconsequential and present no significant risk to the 
organization. Alternatively, the organizational officials may decide that certain findings are in fact, significant, 
requiring immediate remediation actions. In all cases, organizations review assessor findings and determine 
the severity or seriousness of the findings (i.e., the potential adverse impact on organizational operations and 

﻿
	
POAMs	
649
assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation) and whether the findings are sufficiently significant to 
be worthy of further investigation or remediation. Senior leadership involvement in the mitigation process 
may be necessary in order to ensure that the organization’s resources are effectively allocated in accordance 
with organizational priorities, providing resources first to the information systems that are supporting the 
most critical and sensitive missions and business functions for the organization or correcting the deficien-
cies that pose the greatest degree of risk. If weaknesses or deficiencies in security controls are corrected, the 
security control assessor reassesses the remediated controls for effectiveness. Security control reassessments 
determine the extent to which the remediated controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and 
producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the information system. 
Exercising caution not to change the original assessment results, assessors update the security assessment 
report with the findings from the reassessment. The security plan is updated based on the findings of the secu-
rity control assessment and any remediation actions taken. The updated security plan reflects the actual state 
of the security controls after the initial assessment and any modifications by the information system owner 
or common control provider in addressing recommendations for corrective actions. At the completion of the 
assessment, the security plan contains an accurate list and description of the security controls implemented 
(including compensating controls) and a list of residual vulnerabilities.4
POAMs
Once the Security Assessment Report is provided to the system owner and the AODR, 
the system owner develops the plans for remediation of the residual risk items identified by 
the SAR. These items are placed onto the Risk Register for the agency, known as the Plan of 
­Action and Milestones (POAMs).
The plan of action and milestones, prepared for the authorizing official by the information system owner or 
the common control provider, is one of three key documents in the security authorization package and de-
scribes the specific tasks that are planned:
(i)	 To correct any weaknesses or deficiencies in the security controls noted during the assessment; and
(ii)	 To address the residual vulnerabilities in the information system.
The plan of action and milestones identifies:
(i)	 The tasks to be accomplished with a recommendation for completion either before or after information 
system implementation;
(ii)	 The resources required to accomplish the tasks;
(iii)	 Any milestones in meeting the tasks; and
(iv)	 The scheduled completion dates for the milestones.
The plan of action and milestones is used by the authorizing official to monitor progress in correct-
ing weaknesses or deficiencies noted during the security control assessment. All security weaknesses and 
­deficiencies identified during the security control assessment are documented in the security assessment re-
port to maintain an effective audit trail. Organizations develop specific plans of action and milestones based 
on the results of the security control assessment and in accordance with applicable laws, Executive Orders, 
directives, policies, standards, guidance, or regulations. Plan of action and milestones entries are not required 
when weaknesses or deficiencies are remediated during the assessment or prior to the submission of the au-
thorization package to the authorizing official.
4SP 800-37, rev. 1, p. 32–33.

13.  Reporting
﻿
Organizations define a strategy for developing plans of action and milestones that facilitates a prioritized 
approach to risk mitigation that is consistent across the organization. The strategy helps to ensure that orga-
nizational plans of action and milestones are based on:
(i)	 The security categorization of the information system;
(ii)	 The specific weaknesses or deficiencies in the security controls;
(iii)	 The importance of the identified security control weaknesses or deficiencies (i.e., the direct or indirect 
effect the weaknesses or deficiencies may have on the overall security state of the information system, 
and hence on the risk exposure of the organization, or ability of the organization to perform its mission 
or business functions); and
(iv)	 The organization’s proposed risk mitigation approach to address the identified weaknesses or deficien-
cies in the security controls (e.g., prioritization of risk mitigation actions, allocation of risk mitigation 
resources). A risk assessment guides the prioritization process for items included in the plan of action 
and milestones.5
POAM reporting is defined by OMB through its memoranda and currently is required for 
agency on a monthly basis. It had run on a quarterly basis for many years, but recent events 
have moved OMB to request these reports through CyberScope to be submitted on a monthly 
basis for budgetary and management purposes.

Conclusion
At this point, we have developed a security test methodology and plan for evaluating the 
security of our system under test, conducted the test plan activities, produced the evidence to 
support the results of the testing, and then built reports for supporting the findings and con-
clusion as documented in the Security Assessment Report or other report to the supervisory 
and executive staff.
The evaluation and assessment of security and security controls involves much more than 
just looking at documents and running scan tools, although a lot of pundits would say that 
is all that is needed. Today’s breaches, threats, and vulnerabilities all tell us that viewpoint is 
incorrect and doomed for failure and “front-page” news articles.
Understanding the variable nature of security control options as found in SP 800-53, the 
various ways and techniques to test and evaluate these controls as found in SP 800-53A, and 
the varied and diverse methods and tactics employed to breach our networks and our re-
sponses as found in SP 800-115 all give us an understanding and hope that we stay ahead of 
the adversary, understand his or her TTPs, and keep him or her at bay while conducting our 
business and achieving success in our mission.

Appendix B – FedRAMP Assessment 
Process and Templates
The Federal Risk Assessment and Management Program is the joint NIST-GSA program 
which oversees the US governmental installations of cloud-based systems.
The FedRAMP program has produced templates and guidelines for each area of the cloud 
deployment of system for federal agencies which require ATO and periodic testing under FISMA 
requirements and all if these efforts are in conformance to SP 800-53 and SP 800-37 criteria.
I have included the testing guide for the controls here from the FedRAMP site 
(http://www.fedramp.gov/), but there are many other documents of relevance there also, 
including SAP and SAR templates, guides for Third-Party Assessment Organizations (3PAOs) 
who do the actual assessments following FedRAMP and NIST guides, and other acquisition 
guidance.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This is a draft document to allow interested parties to review the proposed test cases for 
the FedRAMP implementation of NIST 800-53 Revision 4. The Program Management Office 
(PMO) anticipates releasing the finalized test cases in a workbook like previous versions, but 
felt that editing and tracking of changes to the draft is easier in this format. Interested parties 
can send feedback to the PMO at the email address below.
