Installers
installer builders are an easy way to create custom 
installers
usually have their own scripting language
resulting installer carries binaries and instructions how to 
install them
examples: Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS), Inno 
Setup, Advanced Installer

but sometimes you also need the install script

Obtaining installed files
UNARCHIVERS
most installed files are just 
archives
just try and use 7zip on the 
installer
DYNAMICALLY
run the installer
monitor file write calls
obtain the extracted files
INSTALLER 
EXTRACTORS
identify installer with DiE
search for specific extractor

Obtaining the installer script
INSTALLER EXTRACTORS
identify installer with DiE
search for installer-specific extractor
in most cases such extractors exist already
CUSTOM SOLUTION
analyze the installer code
some installers compile their script to an 
intermediate language, some just pack it
it helps to build your own installer with 
different scripts and see what changed
