We dedicate this monograph to the numerous contributors to this ﬁeld, many of whom are listed in the
Author Index.
The MIMO capacity theoretically increases linearly with the number of transmit antennas, provided
that the number of receive antennas is equal to the number of transmit antennas. With the further
proviso that the total transmit power is increased proportionately to the number of transmit antennas,
a linear capacity increase is achieved on increasing the transmit power. However, under realistic
conditions the theoretical MIMO-OFDM performance erodes, hence, to circumvent this degradation,
our monograph is dedicated to the design of practical coherent, non-coherent and cooperative
MIMO-OFDM turbo-transceivers . . .

Preface
The rationale and structure of this volume is centred around the following ‘story-line’. The conception
of parallel transmission of data over dispersive channels dates back to the seminal paper of Doelz
et al. published in 1957, leading to the OFDM philosophy, which has found its way into virtually
all recent wireless systems, such as the Wi-Fi, WiMAX, LTE and DVB as well as DAB broadcast
standards. Although MIMO techniques are signiﬁcantly ‘younger’ than OFDM, they also reached a
state of maturity and hence the family of recent wireless standards includes the optional employment of
MIMO techniques, which motivates the joint study of OFDM and MIMO techniques in this volume.
The research of MIMO arrangements was motivated by the observation that the MIMO capacity
increases linearly with the number of transmit antennas, provided that the number of receive antennas
is equal to the number of transmit antennas. With the further proviso that the total transmit power is
increased proportionately to the number of transmit antennas, a linear capacity increase is achieved upon
increasing the transmit power. This is beneﬁcial since, according to the classic Shannon–Hartley law,
the achievable channel capacity increases only logarithmically with the transmit power. Thus MIMO-
OFDM may be considered a ‘green’ transceiver solution.
This volume therefore sets out to explore the recent research advances in MIMO-OFDM techniques
as well as their limitations. The basic types of multiple-antenna-aided OFDM systems are classiﬁed and
their beneﬁts are characterized. Space-Division Multiple Access (SDMA), Space-Division Multiplexing
(SDM) and space–time coding MIMOs are addressed. We also argue that under realistic propagation
conditions, when for example the signals associated with the MIMO elements become correlated owing
to shadow fading, the predicted performance gains may substantially erode. Furthermore, owing to the
limited dimensions of shirt-pocket-sized handsets, the employment of multiple-antenna elements at the
mobile station is impractical.
Hence in practical terms only the family of distributed MIMO elements, which relies on the
cooperation of potentially single-element mobile stations, is capable of eliminating the correlation of the
signals impinging on the MIMO elements, as will be discussed in the book. The topic of cooperative
wireless communications cast in the context of distributed MIMOs has recently attracted substantial
research interests, but, nonetheless, it has numerous open problems, before all the idealized simplifying
assumptions currently invoked in the literature are eliminated.
On a more technical note, we aim at achieving a near-capacity MIMO-OFDM performance, which
requires sophisticated designs, as detailed below:
• A high throughput may be achieved with the aid of a high number of MIMO elements, but this is
attained at a potentially high complexity, which increases exponentially as a function of both the
number of MIMO elements and the number of bits per symbol, when using a full-search-based
Maximum Likelihood (ML) multi-stream/multi-user detector.
• In order to approach the above-mentioned near-capacity performance, while circumventing the
problem of an exponentially increasing complexity, we design radical multi-stream/multi-user
detectors which ‘capture’ the ML solution with a high probability at a fraction of the ML
complexity.

Preface
• This ambitious design goal is achieved with the aid of sophisticated soft-decision-based Genetic
Algorithm (GA) assisted MUDs or new sphere detectors, which are capable of operating in the
high-importance rank-deﬁcient scenarios, when the number of transmit antennas may be as high
as twice the number of receiver antennas.
• The achievable gain of space–time codes is further improved with the aid of sphere-packing
modulation, which allows us to design the space–time symbols of multiple transmit antennas
jointly, while previous designs made no effort to do so. Naturally, this joint design no
longer facilitates low-complexity single-stream detection, but our sphere decoders allow us to
circumvent this increased detection complexity.
• Sophisticated joint coding and modulation schemes are used, which accommodate the parity bits
of the channel codec without bandwidth extension, simply by extending the modulation alphabet.
• Estimating the MIMO channel for a high number of transmit and receive antennas becomes
extremely challenging, since we have to estimate Nt · Nr channels, although in reality we are
only interested in the data symbols, not the channel. This problem becomes even more grave
in the context of the above-mentioned rank-deﬁcient scenarios, since we have to estimate more
channels than the number of received streams. Finally, the pilot overhead imposed by estimating
Nt · Nr channels might become prohibitive, which erodes the attainable throughput gains.
• In order to tackle the above-mentioned challenging channel estimation problem, we designed
new iterative joint channel estimation and data detection techniques. More explicitly, provided
that a powerful MIMO MUD, such as the above-mentioned GA-aided or sphere-decoding-based
MUD, is available for delivering a sufﬁciently reliable ﬁrst data estimate, the power of decision-
directed channel estimation may be invoked, which exploits the fact that after a ﬁrst tentative
data decision – in the absence of decision errors – the receiver effectively knows the transmitted
signal and hence may then exploit the presence of 100% pilot information for generating a more
accurate channel estimate. Again, this design philosophy is detailed in the book in great depth in
the context of joint iterative channel estimation and data detection.
• Although the number of studies/papers on cooperative communications has increased exponen-
tially over the past few years, most investigations stipulate the simplifying assumption of having
access to perfect channel information – despite the fact that, as detailed under the previous bullet
point, this is an extremely challenging task even for co-located MIMO elements.
• Thus it is necessary to design new non-coherently detected cooperative systems, which can
dispense with the requirement of channel estimation, despite the typical 3 dB performance loss
of differential detection. It is demonstrated in the book that the low-complexity non-coherent
detector’s potential performance penalty can in fact be recovered by jointly detecting a number of
consecutive symbols with the aid of the so-called multiple-symbol differential detector, although
this is achieved at the cost of increased complexity.
• Thus the proposed sphere detector may be invoked again, but now as a reduced-complexity
multiple-symbol differential detector.
• The above-mentioned cooperative systems require speciﬁcally designed resource allocation,
including the choice of the relaying protocols, the selection of the cooperating partners and the
power control techniques.
• It is demonstrated that when the available relaying partners are roaming close to the source, the
Decode-and-Forward (DF) protocol is the best cooperating protocol, which avoids potential error
precipitation. By contrast, in case the cooperating partners roam closer to the destination, then
the Amplify-and-Forward (AF) protocol is preferred for the same reasons. These complementary
features suggest the emergence of a hybrid DF/AF protocol, which is controlled with the aid of
our novel resource allocation techniques.
• The book concludes by outlining a variety of promising future research directions.

Our intention in the book is:
1. First, to pay tribute to all researchers, colleagues and valued friends who contributed to the
ﬁeld. Hence this book is dedicated to them, since without their quest for better MIMO-OFDM
solutions this monograph could not have been conceived. They are too numerous to name here,
but they do appear in the Author Index of the book. Our hope is that the conception of this
monograph on the topic will provide an adequate portrayal of the community’s research and will
further fuel the innovation process.
2. We expect to stimulate further research by exposing open research problems and by collating
a range of practical problems and design issues for the practitioners. The coherent further
efforts of the wireless research community are expected to lead to the solution of a range of
outstanding problems, ultimately providing us with ﬂexible coherent and non-coherent detection-
aided as well as cooperative MIMO-OFDM wireless transceivers exhibiting a performance close
to information theoretical limits.

Introduction to OFDM and
MIMO-OFDM
1.1
OFDM History
In recent years Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) [1–4] has emerged as a
successful air-interface technique. In the context of wired environments, OFDM techniques are also
known as Discrete Multi-Tone (DMT) [5] transmissions and are employed in the American National
Standards Institute’s (ANSI’s) Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) [6], High-bit-rate Digital
Subscriber Line (HDSL) [7], and Very-high-speed Digital Subscriber Line (VDSL) [8] standards as
well as in the European Telecommunication Standard Institute’s (ETSI’s) [9] VDSL applications.
In wireless scenarios, OFDM has been advocated by many European standards, such as Digital
Audio Broadcasting (DAB) [10], Digital Video Broadcasting for Terrestrial television (DVB-T) [11],
Digital Video Broadcasting for Handheld terminals (DVB-H) [12], Wireless Local Area Networks
(WLANs) [13] and Broadband Radio Access Networks (BRANs) [14]. Furthermore, OFDM has been
ratiﬁed as a standard or has been considered as a candidate standard by a number of standardization
groups of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), such as the IEEE 802.11 [15]
and the IEEE 802.16 [16] standard families.
The concept of parallel transmission of data over dispersive channels was ﬁrst mentioned as early as
1957 in the pioneering contribution of Doelz et al. [17], while the ﬁrst OFDM schemes date back to the
1960s, which were proposed by Chang [18] and Saltzberg [19]. In the classic parallel data transmission
systems [18, 19], the Frequency-Domain (FD) bandwidth is divided into a number of non-overlapping
subchannels, each of which hosts a speciﬁc carrier widely referred to as a subcarrier. While each
subcarrier is separately modulated by a data symbol, the overall modulation operation across all the
subchannels results in a frequency-multiplexed signal. All of the sinc-shaped subchannel spectra exhibit
zero crossings at all of the remaining subcarrier frequencies and the individual subchannel spectra are
orthogonal to each other. This ensures that the subcarrier signals do not interfere with each other, when
communicating over perfectly distortionless channels, as a consequence of their orthogonality [3].
The early OFDM schemes [18–21] required banks of sinusoidal subcarrier generators and
demodulators, which imposed a high implementation complexity. This drawback limited the application
of OFDM to military systems until 1971, when Weinstein and Ebert [22] suggested that the Discrete
Fourier Transform (DFT) can be used for the OFDM modulation and demodulation processes, which
signiﬁcantly reduces the implementation complexity of OFDM. Since then, more practical OFDM

Chapter 1. Introduction to OFDM and MIMO-OFDM
research has been carried out. For example, in the early 1980s Peled and Ruiz [23] proposed a simpliﬁed
FD data transmission method using a cyclic preﬁx-aided technique and exploited reduced-complexity
algorithms for achieving a signiﬁcantly lower computational complexity than that of classic single-
carrier time-domain Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) [24] modems. Around the same era,
Keasler et al. [25] invented a high-speed OFDM modem for employment in switched networks, such as
the telephone network. Hirosaki designed a subchannel-based equalizer for an orthogonally multiplexed
QAM system in 1980 [26] and later introduced the DFT-based implementation of OFDM systems [27],
on the basis of which a so-called groupband data modem was developed [28]. Cimini [29] and Kalet [30]
investigated the performance of OFDM modems in mobile communication channels. Furthermore,
Alard and Lassalle [31] applied OFDM in digital broadcasting systems, which was the pioneering
work of the European DAB standard [10] established in the mid-1990s. More recent advances in
OFDM transmission were summarized in the state-of-the-art collection of works edited by Fazel and
Fettweis [32]. Other important recent OFDM references include the books by Hanzo et al. [3] and Van
Nee et al. [4] as well as a number of overview papers [33–35].
OFDM has some key advantages over other widely used wireless access techniques, such as Time-
Division Multiple Access (TDMA) [36], Frequency-Division Multiple Access (FDMA) [36] and Code-
Division Multiple Access (CDMA) [37, 38, 40–42]. The main merit of OFDM is the fact that the radio
channel is divided into many narrowband, low-rate, frequency-non-selective subchannels or subcarriers,
so that multiple symbols can be transmitted in parallel, while maintaining a high spectral efﬁciency.
Each subcarrier may deliver information for a different user, resulting in a simple multiple-access
scheme known as Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) [43–46]. This enables
different media such as video, graphics, speech, text or other data to be transmitted within the same
radio link, depending on the speciﬁc types of services and their Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements.
Furthermore, in OFDM systems different modulation schemes can be employed for different subcarriers
or even for different users. For example, the users close to the Base Station (BS) may have a relatively
good channel quality, thus they can use high-order modulation schemes to increase their data rates. By
contrast, for those users that are far from the BS or are serviced in highly loaded urban areas, where the
subcarriers’ quality is expected to be poor, low-order modulation schemes can be invoked [47].
Besides its implementational ﬂexibility, the low complexity required in transmission and reception
as well as the attainable high performance render OFDM a highly attractive candidate for high-data-rate
communications over time-varying frequency-selective radio channels. For example, in classic single-
carrier systems, complex equalizers have to be employed at the receiver for the sake of mitigating
the Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) introduced by multi-path propagation. By contrast, when using
a cyclic preﬁx [23], OFDM exhibits a high resilience against the ISI. Incorporating channel coding
techniques into OFDM systems, which results in Coded OFDM (COFDM) [48, 49], allows us to
maintain robustness against frequency-selective fading channels, where busty errors are encountered
at speciﬁc subcarriers in the FD.
However, besides its signiﬁcant advantages, OFDM also has a few disadvantages. One problem
is the associated increased Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) in comparison with single-carrier
systems [3], requiring a large linear range for the OFDM transmitter’s output ampliﬁer. In addition,
OFDM is sensitive to carrier frequency offset, resulting in Inter-Carrier Interference (ICI) [50].
As a summary of this section, we outline the milestones and the main contributions found in the
OFDM literature in Tables 1.1 and 1.2.

is widely referred to as the Multiple-Input, Multiple-Output (MIMO) technique, constitutes a cost-
effective approach to high-throughput wireless communications.
The concepts of MIMOs have been under development for many years for both wired and wireless
systems. One of the earliest MIMO applications for wireless communications dates back to 1984, when
Winters [92] published a breakthrough contribution, where he introduced a technique of transmitting
data from multiple users over the same frequency/time channel using multiple antennas at both the
transmitter and receiver ends. Based on this work, a patent was ﬁled and approved [93]. Sparked off by
Winters’ pioneering work [92], Salz [94] investigated joint transmitter/receiver optimization using the
MMSE criterion. Since then, Winters and others [95–103] have made further signiﬁcant advances in the
ﬁeld of MIMOs. In 1996, Raleigh [104] and Foschini [105] proposed new approaches for improving
the efﬁciency of MIMO systems, which inspired numerous further contributions [106–114].
As a key building block of next-generation wireless communication systems, MIMOs are capable
of supporting signiﬁcantly higher data rates than the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System
(UMTS) and the High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) based 3G networks [115]. As
indicated by the terminology, a MIMO system employs multiple transmitter and receiver antennas for
delivering parallel data streams, as illustrated in Figure 1.1. Since the information is transmitted through

different paths, a MIMO system is capable of exploiting both transmitter and receiver diversity, hence
maintaining reliable communications. Furthermore, with the advent of multiple antennas, it becomes
possible to process/combine jointly the multi-antenna signals and thus improve the system’s integrity
and/or throughput. Brieﬂy, compared with Single-Input, Single-Output (SISO) systems, the two most
signiﬁcant advantages of MIMO systems are:
1. A signiﬁcant increase of both the system’s capacity and spectral efﬁciency. The capacity of
a wireless link increases linearly with the minimum of the number of transmitter or receiver
antennas [104, 106]. The data rate can be increased by spatial multiplexing without consuming
more frequency resources and without increasing the total transmit power.
2. Dramatic reduction of the effects of fading due to the increased diversity. This is particularly
beneﬁcial when the different channels fade independently.
An overview of MIMO techniques covering channel models, performance limits, coding and transceiver
designs can be found in [116].
1.1.1.2
MIMO-OFDM
The quality of a wireless link can be described by three basic parameters, namely the transmission rate,
the transmission range and the transmission reliability. Conventionally, the transmission rate may be
increased by reducing the transmission range and reliability. By contrast, the transmission range may
be extended at the cost of a lower transmission rate and reliability, while the transmission reliability may
be improved by reducing the transmission rate and range [117]. However, with the advent of MIMO-
assisted OFDM systems, the above-mentioned three parameters may be simultaneously improved [117].
Initial ﬁeld tests of broadband wireless MIMO-OFDM communication systems have shown that an
increased capacity, coverage and reliability is achievable with the aid of MIMO techniques [118].
Furthermore, although MIMOs can potentially be combined with any modulation or multiple-access
technique, recent research suggests that the implementation of MIMO-aided OFDM is more efﬁcient, as
a beneﬁt of the straightforward matrix algebra invoked for processing the MIMO-OFDM signals [117].
MIMO-OFDM, claimed to be invented by Airgo Networks [119], has formed the foundation of all
candidate standards proposed for IEEE 802.11n [120]. In recent years, this topic has attracted substantial
research efforts, addressing numerous aspects, such as system capacity [121,122], space/time/frequency
coding [123–127], Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) control [128–130], channel estimation [131–
133], receiver design [134–137], etc. Recently, Paulraj et al. [116] and St¨uber et al. [138] have provided

OFDM over today’s networks in terms of the achievable data rate. For the reader’s convenience, we

SDMA-based MIMO-OFDM Systems
As a subclass of MIMO arrangements, recently the Space-Division Multiple Access (SDMA) [3, 193–
195] based techniques have attracted substantial interest. As one of the most promising techniques
aimed at solving the capacity problem of wireless communication systems, SDMA enables multiple
users to share simultaneously the same bandwidth in different geographical locations. More speciﬁcally,
the exploitation of the spatial dimension, namely the so-called spatial signature, makes it possible

In Figure 1.2 we illustrate the concept of SDMA systems. As shown in Figure 1.2, each user
exploiting a single-transmitter-antenna-aided Mobile Station (MS) simultaneously communicates with
the BS equipped with an array of receiver antennas. Explicitly, SDMA can be considered as a speciﬁc
branch of the family of MIMO systems, where the transmissions of the multiple-transmitter antennas
cannot be coordinated, simply because they belong to different users. Brieﬂy speaking, the major
advantages of SDMA techniques are [196]:
• Range extension: With the aid of an antenna array, the coverage area of high-integrity reception
can be signiﬁcantly larger than that of any single-antenna-aided systems. In an SDMA system,
the number of cells required to cover a given geographic area can be substantially reduced. For
example, a 10-element array offers a gain of 10, which typically doubles the radius of the cell
and hence quadruples the coverage area.
• Multi-path mitigation: Beneﬁtting from the MIMO architecture, in SDMA systems the detri-
mental effects of multi-path propagations are effectively mitigated. Furthermore, in speciﬁc

scenarios the multi-path phenomenon can even be exploited to enhance the desired users’ signals
by employing efﬁcient receiver diversity schemes.
• Capacity increase: Theoretically, SDMA can be incorporated into any existing multiple-access
standard at the cost of a limited increase in system complexity, while attaining a substantial
increase in capacity. For instance, by applying SDMA to a conventional TDMA system, two or
more users can share the same time slots, resulting in a doubled or higher overall system capacity.
• Interference suppression: The interference imposed by other systems and by users in other
cells can be signiﬁcantly reduced by exploiting the desired user’s unique, user-speciﬁc Channel
Impulse Responses (CIRs).
• Compatibility: SDMA is compatible with most of the existing modulation schemes, carrier
frequencies and other speciﬁcations. Furthermore, it can be readily implemented using various
array geometries and antenna types.
The combination of SDMA and OFDM results in SDMA-OFDM systems [3,193,197,198], which
exploit the merits of both SDMA and OFDM, having attracted more and more interest [198–203].

OFDM Schematic
In this section we brieﬂy introduce OFDM as a means of dealing with the problems of frequency-
selective fading encountered when transmitting over a high-rate wideband radio channel.
In the OFDM scheme of Figure 1.3 the serial data stream of a trafﬁc channel is passed through
a serial-to-parallel converter, which splits the data into a number of parallel subchannels. The data in
each subchannel are applied to a modulator, such that for M channels there are M modulators whose
carrier frequencies are f0, f1, . . . , fM. The difference between adjacent channels is ∆f and the overall
bandwidth W of the N modulated carriers is M∆f.

These M modulated carriers are then combined to give an OFDM signal. We may view the serial-
to-parallel converter as applying every Mth symbol to a modulator. This has the effect of interleaving
the symbols into each modulator, hence symbols S0, SM, S2M, . . . are applied to the modulator whose
carrier frequency is f1. At the receiver the received OFDM signal is demultiplexed into M frequency
bands, and the M modulated signals are demodulated. The baseband signals are then recombined using
a parallel-to-serial converter.

The main advantage of the above OFDM concept is that because the symbol period has been
increased, the channel delay spread is a signiﬁcantly shorter fraction of a symbol period than in the
serial system, potentially rendering the system less sensitive to ISI than the conventional serial system.
In other words, in the low-rate subchannels the signal is no longer subject to frequency-selective fading,
hence no channel equalization is necessary.
A disadvantage of the OFDM approach shown in Figure 1.3 is the increased complexity over
the conventional system caused by employing M modulators and ﬁlters at the transmitter and M
demodulators and ﬁlters at the receiver. It can be shown that this complexity can be reduced by the use
of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), typically implemented as a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) [3].

The subchannel modems can use almost any modulation scheme, and 4- or 16-level QAM is an attractive
choice in many situations.
A schematic of the FFT-based QAM/FDM modem schematic is portrayed in Figure 1.4. The bits
provided by the source are serial/parallel converted in order to form the n-level Gray-coded symbols,
M of which are collected in TX buffer 1, while the contents of TX buffer 2 are being transformed by the
IFFT in order to form the time-domain modulated signal. The digital-to-analogue (D/A) converted, low-
pass ﬁltered modulated signal is then transmitted via the channel and its received samples are collected
in RX buffer 1, while the contents of RX buffer 2 are being transformed to derive the demodulated
signal. The twin buffers are alternately ﬁlled with data to allow for the ﬁnite FFT demodulation time.
Before the data is Gray coded and passed to the data sink, they can be equalized by a low-complexity
method, if there is some dispersion within the narrow subbands. For a deeper tutorial exposure the
interested reader is referred to [3].
1.3
Channel Estimation for Multi-carrier Systems
The ever-increasing demand for high data rates in wireless networks requires the efﬁcient utilization
of the limited bandwidth available, while supporting a high grade of mobility in diverse propagation
environments. OFDM and MC-CDMA techniques [265] are capable of satisfying these requirements.
This is a beneﬁt of their ability to cope with highly time-variant wireless channel characteristics.
However, as pointed out in [266], the capacity and the achievable integrity of communication systems
are highly dependent on the system’s knowledge concerning the channel conditions encountered. Thus,
the provision of an accurate and robust channel estimation strategy is a crucial factor in achieving a
high performance.
Well-documented approaches to the problem of channel estimation are constituted by pilot-assisted,
decision-directed and blind channel estimation methods [265, 267], which are brieﬂy summarized in
Table 1.8.

The family of pilot-assisted channel estimation methods was investigated for example by Li [261],
Morelli and Mengali [268], Yang et al. [262] as well as Chang and Su [269], where the channel
parameters are typically estimated by exploiting the channel-sounding signal. For example, in OFDM
and MC-CDMA often a set of frequency-domain pilots are transmitted for estimating the Frequency-
Domain Channel Transfer Function (FD-CTF), which are known at the receiver [265]. The main
drawback of this method is that the pilot symbols do not carry any useful information and thus they
reduce the system’s effective throughput.
By contrast, in Decision-Directed Channel Estimation (DDCE) methods both the pilot symbols
and all the information symbols are utilized for channel estimation [265]. The simple philosophy of
this method is that in the absence of transmission errors we can beneﬁt from the availability of 100%
pilot information by using the detected subcarrier symbols as an a posteriori reference signal. The
employment of this method allows us to reduce the number of pilot symbols required. This technique is
particularly efﬁcient under benign channel conditions, where the probability of a decision error is low,
but, naturally, this approach is also prone to error propagation effects. The family of DDCE techniques
was investigated for example by van de Beek et al. [270], Mignone and Morello [271], Edfors
et al. [259], Li et al. [260], Li and Sollenberg [272] as well as M¨unster and Hanzo [263,267,273,274].
The class of iterative DDCE schemes, where the channel estimation is carried out through
a series of iterations utilizing increasingly reﬁned soft-decision-based feedback, was explored by

14
Chapter 1. Introduction to OFDM and MIMO-OFDM
Sandell et al. [275], Valenti [276], Yeap et al. [277], Song et al. [278, 279], as well as by Otnes and
T¨uchler [264,280].
The closely related class of joint receivers, where the channel parameters and the transmitted
information-carrying symbols are estimated jointly, was explored for example by Seshadri [281],
developed further by Knickenberg et al. [282], recently revisited by Cozzo and Hughes [283] as well as
Cui and Tellambura [284,285].
Finally, the class of blind estimation methods eliminates all redundant pilot symbols. Most of these
methods rely on the employment of decision feedback and on the exploitation of the redundancy often
found in the structure of the modulated signal, as exempliﬁed by the techniques described for example
by Ant´on-Haro et al. [286], Boss et al. [287], Endres et al. [288], Giannakis and Halford [289], Zhou
and Giannakis [290] as well as by Necker and St¨uber [291].
An additional major subject, closely related to channel estimation, namely the prediction of fast
fading channels, was extensively studied by Haykin [292]. A so-called robust predictor was proposed
by Li [260] and revised by M¨unster and Hanzo [274]. An adaptive RLS channel predictor was proposed
by Schafhuber and Matz [293].
Subsequently, in this treatise we propose a DDCE scheme, which is suitable for employment
in both OFDM and MC-CDMA systems. We analyse the achievable performance of the estimation
scheme considered in conjunction with a realistic dispersive Rayleigh fading channel model having a
Fractionally Spaced (FS) rather than Symbol-Spaced (SS) Power Delay Proﬁle (PDP).
A basic component of the DDCE schemes proposed in the literature is an a posteriori Least
Squares (LS) temporal estimator of the OFDM-subcarrier-related Frequency-Domain Channel Transfer
Function (FD-CTF) coefﬁcients [260, 265]. The accuracy of the resultant temporal FD-CTF estimates
is typically enhanced using 1D or 2D interpolation exploiting both the time- and the frequency-domain
correlation between the desired FD-CTF coefﬁcients. The LS-based temporal FD-CTF estimator
was shown to be suitable for QPSK-modulated OFDM systems [260, 265], where the energy of
the transmitted subcarrier-related information symbols is constant. However, as will be pointed
out in Section 7.3.1 of this treatise, the LS method cannot be readily employed in MC-CDMA
systems, where – in contrast to OFDM systems – the energy of the transmitted subcarrier-related
information symbols ﬂuctuates as a function of both the modulated sequence and that of the choice
of the potentially non-constant-modulus modulation scheme itself. Thus we propose an Minimum
Mean Square Error (MMSE) estimation-based DDCE method, which is an appropriate solution for
employment in both OFDM and MC-CDMA systems.
The system model and the channel model considered are described in Section 1.7 of this treatise.
The difﬁculty of employing the LS approach to the problem of estimating the OFDM-subcarrier-
related FD-CTF coefﬁcients is described in Section 7.3.1. The alternative MMSE FD-CTF estimator
circumventing the problem outlined in Section 7.3.1 is analysed in Section 7.3.2. Our discourse evolves
further by proposing an MMSE CIR estimator exploiting the frequency-domain correlation of the
FD-CTF coefﬁcients in Section 7.4.1 and a reduced-complexity version of the CTF MMSE estimator
considered is proposed in Section 7.4.2. The computational complexity of both methods is compared in
Section 7.4.3.
In Section 7.4 we continue our discourse with the derivation of both the sample-spaced as well as
the fractionally spaced Channel Impulse Response (CIR) estimator. In Section 7.4.5 we then perform
a comparison between the two methods considered and demonstrate the advantages of the latter, i.e.
fractionally spaced, scheme. Subsequently, in Section 7.5 we develop a method of parametric tracking
of the fractionally spaced CIR taps, which facilitates low-complexity channel estimation in realistic
channel conditions characterized by a time-variant, fractionally spaced, power delay proﬁle. More
speciﬁcally, we employ the Projection Approximation Subspace Tracking (PAST) method for the sake
of recursive tracking of the covariance matrix of the Channel Transfer Function (CTF) and subsequent
tracking of the corresponding CIR taps. We demonstrate that the PAST-aided decision-directed channel
estimation scheme proposed exhibits good performance over the entire range of practical conditions.

1.4. Channel Estimation for MIMO-OFDM

In Section 7.6 we discuss two major CIR tap prediction strategies. Speciﬁcally, in Section 7.6.2 the
so-called robust implementation of the stationary MMSE CIR predictor is considered. The robust CIR
predictor [260] assumes a constant-valued, limited-support channel scattering function [265] during the
design of the CIR tap prediction ﬁlter, and hence relies on the assumption of encountering the worst
possible channel conditions. On the other hand, in Section 7.6.4 we discuss the adaptive Recursive
Least-Squares (RLS) method of CIR prediction [293]. As opposed to the robust CIR predictor of [260],
the RLS CIR predictor does not require any explicit information concerning the channel conditions
encountered. Consequently, in Section 7.6.5 we characterize and compare the achievable performance
of both methods considered and draw conclusions concerning their relative merits. Speciﬁcally, we
demonstrate that the RLS prediction technique outperforms its robust counterpart over the entire range
of the relevant channel conditions.
In Section 7.7 we characterize the achievable performance of the resultant PAST-aided DDCE
scheme. We report an estimation efﬁciency of κ = −18 dB exhibited by a system employing 10%
of pilots and communicating over a dispersive Rayleigh fading channel having a Doppler frequency of
fD = 0.003. Furthermore, we report a BER performance, which is only 3 dB from the corresponding
BER performance exhibited by a similar system assuming perfect channel knowledge.
1.4
Channel Estimation for MIMO-OFDM
In spite of immense interest from both the academic and industrial communities, a practical MIMO
transceiver architecture, capable of approaching channel capacity boundaries in realistic channel
conditions, remains largely an open problem. In particular, a robust and accurate channel estimation
in MIMO systems constitutes a major issue, preventing us from achieving the high capacities predicted
by the relevant theoretical analysis.
Some of the major contributions addressing the problem of channel estimation in MIMO systems
are summarized in Table 1.9. More speciﬁcally, a combined OFDM-SDMA approach was discussed by
Vandenameele et al. [299]. A pilot-based approach to the problem of MIMO channel estimation has
been explored by Jungnickel et al. in [300], by Bolcskei et al. [301], as well as by Zhu et al. [302]. On
the other hand, decision-directed iterative channel estimation for MIMO systems was addressed by Li
et al. [294, 303, 304] as well as Deng et al. [296]. Furthermore, s parallel interference cancellation-
assisted decision-directed channel estimation scheme for MIMO-OFDM systems was proposed by
M¨unster and Hanzo [297, 305]. Joint decoding and channel estimation for MIMO channels was
considered by Grant [306] and further investigated by Cozzo and Hughes [283]. Iterative channel
estimation for space–time block-coded systems was addressed by Mai et al. [307], while joint
iterative DDCE for turbo-coded MIMO-OFDM systems was investigated by Qiao [308]. Blind channel
estimation in MIMO-OFDM systems with multi-user interference was explored by Yatawatta and
Petropulu [298].
Other closely related issues, namely the iterative tracking of the channel-related parameters using
soft decision feedback, was studied by Sandell et al. [275], while iterative channel estimation in the
context of turbo-equalization was considered by Song et al. [279], Mai et al. [309], as well as Otnes
and T¨uchler [264].
Finally, an important overview publication encompassing most major aspects of broadband MIMO-
OFDM wireless communications including channel estimation and signal detection, as well as time and
frequency synchronization, was contributed by St¨uber et al. [295].
Against this background, in this treatise we propose a DDCE scheme, which is suitable for
employment in a wide range of multi-antenna, multi-carrier systems as well as over the entire range
of practical channel conditions. In particular, we consider mobile wireless multi-path channels, which
exhibit fast Rayleigh frequency-selective fading and are typically characterized by a time-variant PDP.
We consider a generic MIMO-OFDM system employing K orthogonal frequency-domain subcarri-
ers and having mt and nr transmit and receive antennas, respectively. Consequently, our MIMO channel

estimation scheme comprises an array of K per-subcarrier MIMO-CTF estimators, followed by an
(nr ×mt)-dimensional array of parametric CIR estimators and a corresponding array of (nr ×mt ×L)
CIR tap predictors, where L is the number of tracked CIR taps per link for the MIMO channel.
In Section 7.8.1 we explore a family of recursive MIMO-CTF tracking methods, which in
conjunction with the aforementioned PAST-aided CIR-tracking method of Section 7.5 as well as the
RLS CIR tap prediction method of Section 7.6.4, facilitate an effective channel estimation scheme in
the context of an MIMO-OFDM system. More speciﬁcally, in Section 7.8.1 we consider both hard- and
soft-feedback-assisted least mean squares (LMS) and recursive least-squares (RLS) tracking algorithms
as well as the modiﬁed RLS algorithm, which is capable of improved utilization of the soft information
associated with the decision-based estimates.
Finally, in Section 7.8.1.5 we document the achievable performance of the resultant MIMO-DDCE
scheme employing recursive CTF tracking followed by the parametric CIR tap tracking and CIR tap
prediction. We demonstrate that the MIMO-DDCE scheme proposed exhibits good performance over
the entire range of practical conditions.
Both the Bit Error Rate (BER) as well as the corresponding MSE performance of the channel
estimation scheme considered are characterized in the context of a turbo-coded MIMO-OFDM system.
We demonstrate that the MIMO-DDCE scheme proposed remains effective in channel conditions
associated with high terminal speeds of up to 130 km/h, which corresponds to the OFDM-symbol
normalized Doppler frequency of 0.006. Additionally, we report a virtually error-free performance of
a rate 1/2 turbo-coded 8 × 8-QPSK-OFDM system, exhibiting a total bit rate of 8 bps/Hz and having
a pilot overhead of only 10%, at an SNR of 10 dB and normalized Doppler frequency of 0.003, which
corresponds to the mobile terminal speed of roughly 65 km/h.1

Signal Detection in MIMO-OFDM Systems
The demand for both high data rates and improved transmission integrity requires efﬁcient utilization
of the limited system resources, while supporting a high grade of mobility in diverse propagation
environments. Consequently, the employment of an appropriate modulation format, as well as efﬁcient
exploitation of the available bandwidth, constitute crucial factors in achieving a high performance.

Figure 1.5: Classiﬁcation of space–time processing techniques.
The OFDM modulation scheme employed in conjunction with an MIMO architecture [265],
where multiple antennas are employed at both the transmitter and the receiver of the communication
system, constitutes an attractive solution in terms of satisfying these requirements. Firstly, the OFDM
modulation technique is capable of coping with the highly frequency-selective, time-variant channel
characteristics associated with mobile wireless communication channels, while possessing a high grade
of structural ﬂexibility for exploiting the beneﬁcial properties of MIMO architectures.
It is highly beneﬁcial that OFDM and MIMO may be conveniently combined, since the information
theoretical analysis predicts [310] that substantial capacity gains are achievable in communication
systems employing MIMO architectures. Speciﬁcally, if the fading processes corresponding to different
transmit–receive antenna pairs may be assumed to be independently Rayleigh distributed,2 the attainable
capacity was shown to increase linearly with the smaller of the numbers of the transmit and receive
antennas [310]. Additionally, the employment of MIMO architectures allows for efﬁcient exploitation
of the spatial diversity available in wireless MIMO environments, thus improving the system’s BER, as
well as further increasing the system’s capacity.
The family of space–time signal processing methods, which allow for the efﬁcient implementation
of communication systems employing MIMO architectures, is commonly referred to as smart antennas.
In recent years, the concept of smart antennas has attracted intensive research interest in both the
academic and industrial communities. As a result, a multiplicity of smart-antenna-related methods has
been proposed. These include methods implemented at the transmitter, the receiver or both.
The classiﬁcation of smart-antenna techniques is illustrated in Figure 1.5. It should be noted,
however, that the classiﬁcation presented here is somewhat informal and its sole purpose is to position
appropriately the content of this treatise in the context of the extensive material available on the subject.
Two distinctive system scenarios employing smart antennas can be identiﬁed. The ﬁrst is the so-
called Space-Division Multiplexing (SDM) scenario [311], where two peer terminals each employ
2This assumption is typically regarded as valid if the appropriate antenna spacing is larger than of λ/2, where λ is the
corresponding wavelength.

18
Chapter 1. Introduction to OFDM and MIMO-OFDM
multiple antennas and communicate with each other over a MIMO channel, and the multiple antennas
are primarily used for achieving a multiplexing gain, i.e. a higher throughput [312]. The second scenario
corresponds to the Space-Division Multiple Access (SDMA) conﬁguration [265], where a single base
station, employing multiple antennas, communicates simultaneously using a single carrier frequency
with multiple user terminals, each employing one or several antennas.
The various point-to-multipoint smart-antenna applications can be further subdivided into uplink-
and downlink-related applications. The uplink-related methods constitute a set of techniques which can
be employed in the base station in order to detect the signals simultaneously transmitted by multiple
user terminals. More speciﬁcally, provided that the CIR of all users is accurately estimated, it may
be used as their unique, user-speciﬁc spatial signature for differentiating them, despite communicating
within the same frequency band [265]. Hence, the corresponding space–time signal processing problem
is commonly referred to as Multi-User Detection (MUD) [265], while the multi-antenna, multi-user
systems employing uplink space–time MUDs are commonly referred to as SDMA systems [265]. In
contrast to the SDM-type systems designed to achieve the highest possible multiplexing gain, the design
objective of the SDMA techniques is maximization of the number of users supported. By contrast, the
class of beamformers [313] creates angularly selective beams for both the uplink and downlink in the
direction of the desired user, while forming nulls towards the interfering users. Finally, the family of
Space–Time Codes (STCs) [314] was optimized for achieving the highest possible transmit diversity
gain, rather than for multiplexing gain or for increasing the number of users supported. At the time of
writing, new research is aiming at achieving both the maximum attainable diversity and multiplexing
gain with the aid of eigenvalue decomposition [315].
As stated above, two beneﬁts of employing smart antennas are the system’s improved integrity and
the increased aggregate throughput. Hence an adequate performance criterion of the particular smart-
antenna implementation is a combination of the system’s attainable aggregate data throughput and the
corresponding data integrity, which can be quantiﬁed in terms of the average BER. Consequently, in the
context of point-to-multipoint-related smart-antenna applications, the achievable capacity associated
with the particular space–time processing method considered may be assessed as a product of the
simultaneously supported number of individual users and the attainable data rate associated with each
supported user. The measure of data integrity may be the average BER of all the users supported. Thus,
the typical objective of the multi-user-related smart-antenna implementations, such as that of an SDMA
scheme, is that of increasing the number of simultaneously supported users, while sustaining the highest
possible integrity of all the data communicated.
In this treatise, however, we would like to focus our attention on the family of space–time processing
methods associated with the point-to-point system scenario. The main objective of point-to-point space–
time processing is to increase the overall throughput of the system considered, as opposed to increasing
the number of individual users simultaneously supported by the system, which was the case in the
multi-user SDMA scenario described above. As illustrated in Figure 1.5, the family of time–space
processing methods associated with the point-to-point-related smart-antenna applications entail two
different approaches, namely that of STCs [314] as well as various layered space–time architectures,
best known from the BLAST scheme [312].
The STC methods may be classiﬁed in two major categories, namely the Space–Time Block
Code (STBC) and the Space–Time Trellis Code (STTC) categories. A simple method of STBC was
ﬁrst presented by Alamouti in [316]. Various STBC techniques were then extensively studied in a series
of major publications by Tarokh et al. in [317–323] as well as by Ariyavistakul et al. in [324, 325].
On the other hand, the original variant of BLAST, known as the Diagonal BLAST (D-BLAST)
scheme, was ﬁrst introduced by Foschini in [312]. A more generic version of the BLAST architecture,
the so-called Vertical BLAST (V-BLAST) arrangement, was proposed by Golden et al. in [326].
Furthermore, the comparative study of the D-BLAST, as well as the V-BLAST systems employing
various detection techniques such as LS- and MMSE-aided Parallel Interference Cancellation (PIC),
and LS- and MMSE-aided Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC), was carried out by Sweatman

et al. in [327]. Typically, however, the term BLAST refers to the point-to-point single-carrier MIMO
architecture employing the SIC detection method, as originally proposed in [312].
For the sake of accuracy, in this work we employ the alternative terminology of SDM in order to
refer to a generic MIMO architecture. The corresponding detection methods are referred to as SDM
Detection (SDMD) techniques, as opposed to the MUD techniques employed in the context of SDMA
systems [265]. Naturally, however, the SDMD and MUD schemes share the same signal detection
methods, regardless of whether the signal arrived from multiple antennas of the same or different users.
The classiﬁcation of the most popular SDMD/MUD schemes is depicted in Figure 1.6. The methods
considered include the linear LS and MMSE techniques, as well as nonlinear techniques, such as ML,
SIC and Genetic-Algorithm-aided MMSE (GA-MMSE) [328,329], and the novel Optimized Hierarchy
Reduced Search Algorithm (OHRSA) methods proposed in this treatise.
In the course of this treatise both the MIMO channel model and the SDM-OFDM system
model are described in Section 1.8. The various SDM detection methods considered are outlined
in Chapter 15. Speciﬁcally, in Section 15.2.1 we demonstrate that the linear increase in capacity,
predicted by information theoretical analysis [266], may indeed be achieved by employing a relatively
low-complexity linear SDM detection method, such as the MMSE SDM detection technique [330].
Secondly, in Section 15.3.1 we show that a substantially better performance can be achieved by
employing a nonlinear ML SDM detector [311, 331, 332], which constitutes the optimal detection
method from the point of view of probabilistic sequence estimation. To elaborate a little further,
the ML SDM detector is capable of attaining transmit diversity in fully loaded systems, where the
number of transmit and receive antennas is equal. Moreover, as opposed to the linear detection schemes
considered, the ML SDM detector is capable of operating in the rank-deﬁcient system conﬁguration,
when the number of transmit antennas exceeds that of the receive antennas. Unfortunately, however,
the excessive computational complexity associated with the exhaustive search employed by the ML
detection method renders it inapplicable to practical implementation in systems having a large number
of transmit antennas. Subsequently, in Sections 15.3.2 and 15.3.3 we explore a range of advanced
nonlinear SDM detection methods, namely the SIC and GA-aided MMSE detection, respectively,
where the latter may potentially constitute an attractive compromise between the low complexity of
the linear SDM detection and the high performance of the ML SDM detection schemes. Indeed, we
will demonstrate in Section 15.3.3 that the SDM detection method based on the SIC as well as on the
GA-MMSE detector [329] are both capable of satisfying these requirements.

In Section 15.4 our discourse evolves further by proposing an enhancement of the SDMD schemes
considered by employing both Space-Frequency Interleaving (SFI) and Space-Frequency Walsh–
Hadamard Transform (SFWHT) spreading. The performance beneﬁts of employing SFI and SFWHT
are quantiﬁed in Section 15.4. Finally, our conclusions are summarized in Section 15.6.
PIC-assisted decision-directed channel estimation was also designed or OFDM systems using
multiple transmit antennas by M¨unster and Hanzo [297].
Recently, a family of potent Reduced Search Algorithm (RSA) aided Space–Time processing
methods has been explored (see Table 1.10). These new methods utilize the Sphere Decoder (SD)
technique introduced by Fincke et al. [333]. The SD was ﬁrst proposed for employment in the context of
space–time processing by Damen et al. in [334], where it was utilized for computing the ML estimates
of the modulated symbols transmitted simultaneously from multiple transmit antennas. The complex
version of the SD was proposed by Hochwald and Brink in [335]. The subject was further investigated
by Damen et al. in [336]. Subsequently, an improved version of the Complex Sphere Decoder (CSD)
was advocated by Pham et al. in [337]. Furthermore, CSD-aided detection was considered by Cui and
Tellambura in a joint channel estimation and data detection scheme explored in [284], while a revised
version of the CSD method, namely the so-called Multistage Sphere Decoding (MSD), was introduced
in [338]. The generalized version of the SD, which is suitable for employment in rank-deﬁcient MIMO
systems supporting more transmitters than the number of receive antennas, was introduced by Damen
et al. in [339] and further reﬁned by Cui and Tellambura in [340]. The so-called fast generalized sphere
decoding was introduced by Yang et al. [341]. Yet another variant of SD algorithms with improved
radius search was introduced by Zhao and Giannakis [342]. The subject of approaching MIMO channel
capacity using soft detection on hard sphere decoding was explored by Wang and Giannakis [343].
Iterative detection and decoding in MIMO systems using sphere decoding was considered by Vikalo
et al. [344].
Consequently, a set of novel OHRSA-aided SDM detection methods is outlined in Section 16.1.
Speciﬁcally, in Section 16.1.1 we derive the OHRSA-aided ML SDM detector, which beneﬁts from the
optimal performance of the ML SDM detector [265], while exhibiting a relatively low computational
complexity which is only slightly higher than that required by the low-complexity MMSE SDM
detector [265]. To elaborate a little further, in Section 16.1.2 we derive a bit-wise OHRSA-aided ML
SDM detector, which allows us to apply the OHRSA method of Section 16.1 in high-throughput systems
which employ multi-level modulation schemes, such as M-QAM [265].
In Section 16.1.3 our discourse evolves further by deducing the OHRSA-aided Max-Log-MAP
SDM detector, which allows for efﬁcient evaluation of the soft-bit information and therefore results
in highly efﬁcient turbo decoding. Unfortunately however, in comparison with the OHRSA-aided ML
SDM detector of Section 16.1.2, the OHRSA-aided Max-Log-MAP SDM detector of Section 16.1.3

exhibits a substantially higher complexity. Consequently, in Section 16.1.5 we derive an approximate
Max-Log-MAP method, which we refer to as Soft-output OPtimized HIErarchy (SOPHIE). The
SOPHIE SDM detector combines the advantages of both the OHRSA-aided ML and OHRSA-aided
Max-Log-MAP SDM detectors of Sections 16.1.2 and 16.1.3, respectively. Speciﬁcally, it exhibits
a similar performance to that of the optimal Max-Log-MAP detector, while imposing a modest
complexity which is only slightly higher than that required by the low-complexity MMSE SDM
detector [265]. The computational complexity as well as the achievable performance of the SOPHIE
SDM detector of Section 16.1.5 are analysed and quantiﬁed in Sections 16.1.5.1 and 16.1.5.2,
respectively.

Iterative Signal Processing for SDM-OFDM
In spite of immense interest from both the academic and industrial communities, a practical MIMO
transceiver architecture, capable of approaching channel capacity boundaries in realistic channel
conditions, remains largely an open problem. An important overview publication encompassing most
major aspects of broadband MIMO-OFDM wireless communications including channel estimation
and signal detection, as well as time and frequency synchronization, was contributed by St¨uber et
al. [295]. Other important publications considering MIMO systems in realistic conditions include those
by M¨unster and Hanzo [297], Li et al. [294], Mai et al. [307] as well as Qiao et al. [308]. Nevertheless,
substantial contributions addressing all the major issues inherent to MIMO transceivers, namely error
correction, space–time detection and channel estimation in realistic channel conditions, remain scarce.
Against this background, in Section 17.1 we derive an iterative, so-called turbo Multi-Antenna,
Multi-Carrier (MAMC) receiver architecture. Our turbo-receiver is illustrated in Figure 1.7. Following
the philosophy of turbo processing [314], our turbo SDM-OFDM receiver comprises a succession
of detection modules, which iteratively exchange soft-bit-related information and thus facilitate a
substantial improvement in the overall system performance.
More speciﬁcally, our turbo SDM-OFDM receiver comprises three major components, namely the
soft-feedback decision-directed channel estimator, discussed in detail in Section 7.8, followed by the
soft-input, soft-output OHRSA Log-MAP SDM detector derived in Section 16.1.3 as well as a soft-
input, soft-output serially concatenated turbo code [345]. Consequently, in this chapter we would like

to analyse the achievable performance of each individual constituent of our turbo receiver, as well as
the achievable performance of the entire iterative system. Our aim is to identify the optimum system
conﬁguration, while considering various design trade-offs, such as achievable error-rate performance,
achievable data rate and associated computational complexity.
In Section 17.4.2.4 we demonstrate that our turbo SDM-OFDM system employing the MIMO-
DDCE scheme of Section 7.8 as well as the OHRSA Log-MAP SDM detector of Section 16.1.3
remains effective in channel conditions associated with high terminal speeds of up to 130 km/h, which
corresponds to the OFDM symbol normalized Doppler frequency of 0.006. Additionally, we report a
virtually error-free performance for a rate 1/2 turbo-coded 8 × 8 QPSK-OFDM system, exhibiting an
effective throughput of 8 MHz · 8 bps/Hz = 64 Mbps and having a pilot overhead of only 10% at an
SNR of 7.5 dB and a normalized Doppler frequency of 0.003, which corresponds to a mobile terminal
speed of about 65 km/h.

Channel Statistics
A SISO wireless communication link as seen in Figures 1.8 and 1.9 is constituted by a multiplicity
of statistically independent components, termed paths. Thus, such a channel is referred to as a multi-
path channel. A multi-path channel is typically characterized by its Power Delay Proﬁle (PDP), which
is a set of parameters constituted by the paths’ average powers σ2
l and the corresponding relative
delays τl. Some examples of commonly used PDPs are illustrated in Figure 1.10. The physical
interpretation of each individual path is a single distortionless ray between the transmitter and the
receiver antennas. While the term PDP corresponds to the average power values associated with the
different multi-path channel components, the term CIR refers to the instantaneous state of the dispersive
channel encountered and corresponds to the vector of the instantaneous amplitudes αl[n] associated
with different multi-path components. Thus, the statistical distribution of the CIR is determined by
the channel’s PDP. In the case of independently Rayleigh fading multiple paths we have αl[n] ∈
CN(0, σ2
l ), l = 1, 2, . . . , L, where CN(0, σ2) is a complex Gaussian distribution having mean 0
and variance σ2.
The individual scattered and delayed signal components usually arise as a result of refraction
or diffraction from scattering surfaces, as illustrated in Figure 1.8, and are termed Non-Line-Of-
Sight (NLOS) paths. In most recently proposed wireless mobile channel models, each such CIR com-
ponent αl associated with an individual channel path is modelled by a Wide-Sense Stationary (WSS)
narrowband complex Gaussian process [348] having correlation properties characterized by the cross-
correlation function
rα[m, j] = E{αi[n]α∗
j [n −m]} = rt;i[m]δ[i −j],

The above equation suggests that the different CIR components are assumed to be mutually uncorrelated
and each exhibits time-domain autocorrelation properties deﬁned by the time-domain correlation
function rt;i[m]. The Fourier transform pair of the correlation function rt[n] associated with each
CIR tap corresponds to a band-limited Power Spectral Density (PSD) pt(f), such that pt(f) = 0 if
|f| > fD, where fD is termed the maximum Doppler frequency. The time period 1/fD is the so-called
coherence time of the channel [348] and usually 1/fD ≫T, where T is the duration of the OFDM
block.

Chapter 1. Introduction to OFDM and MIMO-OFDM
A particularly popular model of the time-domain correlation function rt[n] was proposed by Jakes
in [349] and is described by
rt[n] = rJ[n] = J0(nwd),
(1.2)
where J0(x) is a zero-order Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind and wd = 2πTfD is the normalized
Doppler frequency. The corresponding U-shaped PSD function, termed the Jakes spectrum, is given
by [349]

Generally speaking, the Doppler frequencies fD can assume different values for different signal
paths. However, as was advocated in [260], for the sake of exploiting the time-domain correlation in the
context of channel parameter estimation and prediction, it is sufﬁcient to make a worst-case assumption
about the nature of time-domain correlation of the channel parameters encountered. The associated
worst-case channel time-domain correlation properties can be characterized by an ideally band-limited
Doppler PSD function given by [260,265]
pt(f) = pB,unif (f) =

where fD is the assumed value of the maximum Doppler frequency over all channel paths. The
corresponding time-domain correlation function can be described as

We adopt the complex baseband representation of the continuous-time CIR, as given by [348]
h(t, τ) =

l
αl(t)c(τ −τl),
(1.5)
where αl(t) is the time-variant complex amplitude of the lth path and the τl is the corresponding path
delay, while c(τ) is the aggregate impulse response of the transmitter–receiver pair, which usually
corresponds to the raised-cosine Nyquist ﬁlter. From (1.5) the continuous CTF can be described as
in [304]
H(t, f) =

where C(f) is the Fourier transform pair of the transceiver impulse response c(τ) characterized in
Figure 1.11.
As was pointed out in [260], in OFDM/MC-CDMA systems using a sufﬁciently long cyclic preﬁx
and adequate synchronization, the discrete subcarrier-related CTF can be expressed as

is the Sample-Spaced CIR (SS-CIR) and WK = exp(−2π/K). Note that in realistic channel con-
ditions associated with non-sample-spaced time-variant path delays τl(n), the receiver will encounter
dispersed received signal components in several neighbouring samples owing to the convolution of the
transmitted signal with the system’s impulse response, which we refer to as leakage. This phenomenon
is usually unavoidable and therefore the resultant SS-CIR h[n, m] will be constituted by numerous
correlated non-zero taps described by Equation (1.5) and illustrated in Figure 1.12. By contrast,
the Fractionally Spaced CIR (FS-CIR) αl[n] = αl(nT) will be constituted by a lower number of
L ≪K0 ≪K non-zero, statistically independent taps associated with distinctive propagation paths,
as depicted in Figure 1.12.
As shown in [260], the cross-correlation function rH[m, l], which characterized both the time-
and frequency-domain correlation properties of the discrete CTF coefﬁcients H[n, k] associated with
different OFDM blocks and subcarriers, can be described as

and the corresponding CTF. It is evident, however, that in realistic wireless mobile channels, where at
least one of the communicating terminals is in motion, the channel’s PDP will also become time variant
and thus may not be a priori known at the receiver.
For the sake of designing as well as characterizing the performance of an efﬁcient and robust
channel estimation scheme, which will be suitable for realistic channel conditions, we propose a channel
model which sustains the important characteristics of the realistic wireless mobile channels. More
speciﬁcally, as opposed to the conventional constant PDP, our channel model is characterized by a time-
variant PDP, where both the relative delays τl and the corresponding average powers σ2
l of different PDP
taps vary with time.
Our channel model is dynamically generated using the geometric scattering model illustrated in
Figure 1.13. More speciﬁcally, the individual scatterers associated with different propagation paths are
randomly generated using a Markov statistical model. The corresponding relative delays τl and powers
σ2
l associated with each propagation path are calculated based on the geometrical location of each of
the scatterers. Correspondingly, the rate of change in the values of the PDP tap delays τl is determined
by the speed of the mobile wireless terminal and is characterized by the PDP tap drift rate parameter
ντ. The speciﬁc assumptions regarding the practical range of values of the parameter ντ are discussed
in the next chapter. Furthermore, each propagation path experiences independent fast Rayleigh fading.
Finally, the set of parameters characterizing the Markov model employed is chosen such that the average
channel statistics correspond to the desired static-PDP channel model.
1.7.3
Baseline Scenario Characteristics
As a baseline scenario we consider a mobile wireless communication system utilizing a frequency
bandwidth of B = 10 MHz at a carrier frequency of fc = 2.5 GHz. Furthermore, we assume an
OFDM system having K = 128 orthogonal subcarriers. The corresponding FFT frame duration is
Ts = K/B = 16 µs. We assume a cyclic preﬁx of 1/4Ts = 4 µs and thus a total OFDM symbol
duration of T = 20 µs.
Some other important system-related assumptions include the relative speed of the communicating
terminals, which we assume not to exceed v = 130 km/h = 36 m/s. Furthermore, the OFDM-
symbol-normalized Doppler frequency fD relates to the relative speed of the communicating terminals

as follows:
fD = T vfc
c ,
(1.12)
where c = 3 × 108 m/s denotes the speed of light. The actual Doppler frequency fD/T encountered
in the mobile wireless environment is assumed to be in the range of 3 to 300 Hz, where the maximum
value of 300 Hz corresponds to the relative terminal speed of v = 130 km/h and the carrier frequency
of fc = 2.5 GHz. Finally, the OFDM-symbol-normalized PDP tap drift speed ντ may be calculated
as follows:
ντ = T v
c ,
(1.13)
which suggests that the value of the PDP tap drift speed parameter does not exceed the maximum value
of ντ = 2.4 × 10−6 µs = T · 0.12 µs/s.
The resultant baseline scenario system characteristics are summarized in Table 1.11.
1.7.4
MC Transceiver
The transmitter part of the system typically consists of an OFDM/MC-CDMA encoder and modulator,
the output of which is a complex-valued baseband time-domain signal. The resultant baseband signal
is oversampled and pulse shaped using a Nyquist ﬁlter, such as, for example, the root-raised-cosine
ﬁlter characterized in Figure 1.11. The resultant oversampled signal is then converted into an analogue
passband signal using a D/A converter and upconverted to the RF band. At the receiver side a reciprocal
process is taking place, where the received RF signal is ampliﬁed by the RF frontend and downconverted
to an intermediate-frequency passband, then sampled by the A/D converter, downconverted to the

where the transmitted information symbols are detected.
In this treatise we consider the link between the output of the MC modulator and the input of
the MC demodulator of Figure 1.14 as an effective baseband channel. The proof of feasibility for this
assumption is beyond the scope of this contribution; however, it can be found for example in [348,350].

the nth OFDM block. Furthermore, H[n, k] represents the complex-valued CTF coefﬁcient associated

1.8.1
MIMO Channel Model
We consider a MIMO wireless communication system employing mt transmit and nr receive antennas;
hence, the corresponding MIMO wireless communication channel is constituted by (nr × mt)
propagation links, as illustrated in Figure 1.15. Furthermore, each of the corresponding (nr×mt) SISO
propagation links comprises a multiplicity of statistically independent components, termed paths. Thus,
each of these SISO propagation links can be characterized as a multi-path SISO channel, discussed
in detail in Section 1.7.1. Similarly to the SISO case, the multi-carrier structure of our SDM-OFDM
transceiver allows us to characterize the broadband frequency-selective channel considered as an OFDM
subcarrier-related vector of ﬂat-fading CTF coefﬁcients. However, as opposed to the SISO case, for each
OFDM symbol n and subcarrier k the MIMO channel is characterized by an (nr × mt)-dimensional
matrix H[n, k] of the CTF coefﬁcients associated with the different propagation links, such that the
element Hij[n, k] of the CTF matrix H[n, k] corresponds to the propagation link connecting the jth
transmit and ith receive antennas.
Furthermore, the correlation properties of the MIMO-OFDM channel can be readily derived as
a generalization of the SISO-OFDM channel scenario discussed in detail in Section 1.7.1. As shown
in [260], the cross-correlation function rH[m, l], which characterizes both the time- and frequency-
domain correlation properties of the discrete CTF coefﬁcients Hij[n, k] associated with the particular
(i, j)th propagation link of the MIMO channel, as well as with the different OFDM symbol and

subcarrier indices n and k, can be described as
rH;ij[m, l] = E{H∗
ij[n + m, k + l], Hij[n, k]}
= σ2
Hrt[m]rf[l],
(1.16)
where rt[m] is the time-domain correlation function, which may be characterized by the time-domain
correlation model proposed by Jakes in [349], where we have
rt[m] = rJ[m] = J0(nwd),
(1.17)
and J0(x) is a zero-order Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind, while wd = 2πTfD is the normalized
Doppler frequency. On the other hand, the frequency-domain correlation function rf[l] can be expressed
as follows [261]:
rf[l] = |C(l∆f)|2
L

i=1

(1.18)
where C(f) is the frequency response of the pulse-shaping ﬁlter employed by the particular system, σ2
i
and τi, i = 1, . . . , L, are the average power and the corresponding delay of the L-tap PDP encountered,
while σ2
H is the average power per MIMO channel link, such that σ2
H = L
i=1 σ2
i .
In this discussion we assume the different MIMO channel links to be mutually uncorrelated. This
common assumption is usually valid if the spacing between the adjacent antenna elements exceeds λ/2,
where λ is the wavelength corresponding to the RF signal employed. Thus, the overall cross-correlation
function between the (i, j)th and (i′, j′)th propagation links may be described as
rH;ij;i′j′[m, l] = E{H∗
i′j′[n + m, k + l], Hij[n, k]}
= σ2
Hrt[m]rf[l]δ[i −i′]δ[j −j′],
(1.19)
where δ[i] is the discrete Kronecker delta function.
1.8.2
Channel Capacity
While most of the multi-path NLOS channel models can be collectively categorized as Rayleigh fading,
different channel models characterized by different PDPs exhibit substantial differences in terms of their
information-carrying capacity and potential diversity gain. The channel’s capacity determines the upper
bound for the overall system’s throughput. On the other hand, the available diversity gain allows the
communication system to increase its transmission integrity. Various modulation and coding schemes
can be employed by the communication system in order to increase its spectral efﬁciency and also to
take advantage of diversity. Some of these methods are widely discussed in the literature, e.g. in [351],
and include the employment of antenna arrays, space–time coding, time- and frequency-domain
spreading, channel coding, time- and frequency-domain repetition, etc. The theoretical performance
boundaries of such methods are discussed in [266, 352]. Furthermore, the trade-offs between the
attainable system capacity gain and the corresponding diversity gain are addressed in [353].
Consequently, the unrestricted capacity of a generic single-carrier ergodic-ﬂat-fading MIMO
channel can be expressed as in [335], where

(1.20)
where H is an (nr × mt)-dimensional matrix with independent complex Gaussian-distributed entries.
In realistic communication systems, however, the achievable throughput is limited by the modula-
tion scheme employed. Some examples of such modulation schemes are M-ary PSK or M-ary QAM
constellation schemes, where M is the number of complex symbols constituting the constellation map
corresponding to the particular modulation scheme employed. The upper bound deﬁning the maximum

throughput achievable by a particular discrete modulation scheme was ﬁrst discussed by Shannon
in [354] and was shown to be determined by the mutual information I(s; y) exhibited by the modulation
scheme employed. The mutual information can be calculated using the following expression:
I(s; y) = H(y) −H(y|s),
(1.21)
where H(·) = −E log p(·) denotes the entropy function [354]. In the case of having a Gaussian i.i.d.
noise sample vector w with the corresponding covariance matrix given by Cw = σ2
wI, the constrained
entropy constituent H(y|s) of Equation (1.21) is expressed as follows [335]:
H(y|x) = nr log 2πσ2

information I(s; y) of Equation (1.21) for SISO and 2 × 2 MIMO systems, respectively. The mutual
information plots depicted in both ﬁgures correspond to systems employing QPSK as well as 16- and
64-QAM modulations.

SDM-OFDM Transceiver Structure
The schematic of a typical SDM-OFDM system’s physical layer is depicted in Figure 1.17. The
transmitter of the SDM-OFDM system considered is typically constituted by the encoder and modulator
seen in Figure 1.17, generating a set of mt complex-valued baseband time-domain signals [265]. The
modulated baseband signals are then processed in parallel. Speciﬁcally, they are oversampled and
shaped using a Nyquist ﬁlter, such as for example a root-raised-cosine ﬁlter. The resultant oversampled
signals are then converted into an analogue passband signal using a bank of D/A converters and

upconverted to the RF band. At the receiver side of the SDM-OFDM transceiver, the inverse process
takes place, where the set of received RF signals associated with the nr receive antenna elements is
ampliﬁed by the RF ampliﬁer and downconverted to an intermediate-frequency passband. The resultant
passband signals are then sampled by a bank of A/D converters, downconverted to the baseband, ﬁltered
by a matched Nyquist ﬁlter and ﬁnally decimated, in order to produce a set of discrete complex-valued
baseband signals. The resultant set of discrete signals is processed by the corresponding demodulator
and decoder module seen in Figure 1.17, where the transmitted information-carrying symbols are
detected.
In this treatise we consider the link between the output of the SDM-OFDM modulator and the input
of the corresponding SDM-OFDM demodulator of Figure 1.17 as an effective baseband MIMO channel.
The proof of feasibility for this assumption is beyond our scope here, but it can be found for example
in [348, 350]. The structure of the resultant baseband SDM-OFDM system is depicted in Figure 1.18,
where the bold grey arrows illustrate subcarrier-related signals represented by the vectors xi and yi,
while the thin black arrows accommodate scalar time-domain signals.
The discrete frequency-domain model of the SDM-OFDM system, illustrated in Figure 1.18, may
be characterized as a generalization of the SISO case described in Section 1.7.1. That is, we have
yi[n, k] =
mt

j=1
Hij[n, k]xj[n, k] + wi[n, k],
(1.24)
where n = 0, 1, . . . and k = 0, . . . , K −1 are the OFDM symbol and subcarrier indices, respectively,
while yi[n, k], xj[n, k] and wi[n, k] denote the symbol received at the ith receive antenna, the symbol
transmitted from the jth transmit antenna and the Gaussian noise sample encountered at the ith receive
antenna, respectively. Furthermore, Hij[n, k] represents the complex-valued CTF coefﬁcient associated
with the propagation link connecting the jth transmit and ith receive antennas at the kth OFDM
subcarrier and time instance n. Note that in the case of an M-QAM modulated OFDM system, xj[n, k]
corresponds to the M-QAM symbol accommodated by the kth subcarrier of the nth OFDM symbol
transmitted from the jth transmit antenna element.

The SDM-OFDM system model described by Equation (1.24) can be interpreted as the per-OFDM-

y[n, k] = H[n, k]x[n, k] + w[n, k],
(1.25)
where we introduce the space-division-related vectors y[n, k], x[n, k] and w[n, k], as well as a space-
division-related (nr × mt)-dimensional matrix of CTF coefﬁcients H[n, k]. Note that, similarly to
the SISO case, the multi-carrier structure of the SDM-OFDM transceiver allows us to represent the
broadband frequency-selective MIMO channel as a subcarrier-related vector of ﬂat-fading MIMO-CTF
matrices H[n, k].
1.9
Novel Aspects and Outline of the Book
Having brieﬂy reviewed the OFDM, MIMO-OFDM and SDMA-OFDM literature, let us now outline
the organization of this monograph:
• Chapter 3: Channel Coding Assisted STBC-OFDM Systems
As an introductory study, in this chapter we discuss various channel-coded Space–Time Block
Codes (STBCs) in the context of single-user and single-carrier OFDM systems. This work
constitutes the background for the multi-user systems to be investigated in the following
chapters. More speciﬁcally, various Turbo Convolutional (TC) codes, Low-Density Parity Check
(LDPC) codes and Coded Modulation (CM) schemes are combined with STBCs to improve the
performance of the single-user system considered.
• Chapter 4: Coded Modulation Assisted Multi-user SDMA-OFDM Using
Frequency-Domain Spreading
In this chapter, we invoke a multi-user MIMO SDMA-OFDM system for uplink communica-
tions, where the classic Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) Multi-User Detector (MUD)
is employed at the BS for separating the different users’ signals. The CM schemes discussed
in Chapter 3, namely Trellis-Coded Modulation (TCM), Turbo TCM (TTCM), Bit-Interleaved
Coded Modulation (BICM) and Iteratively Decoded BICM (BICM-ID), are evaluated and

34
Chapter 1. Introduction to OFDM and MIMO-OFDM
compared in the context of the SDMA-OFDM system. Furthermore, the performance gain
arising from invoking Walsh–Hadamard Transform Spreading (WHTS) across a block of OFDM
subcarriers in the Frequency Domain (FD) is studied in both the uncoded SDMA-OFDM and the
CM-assisted SDMA-OFDM systems.
• Chapter 5: Hybrid Multi-user Detection for SDMA-OFDM Systems
This chapter focuses on the design of MUDs invoked by the SDMA receiver. Speciﬁcally, the
Maximum Likelihood Detection (MLD) scheme is found to attain the best performance at the
cost of a computational complexity that increases exponentially both with the number of users
and with the number of Bits Per Symbol (BPS) transmitted by higher-order modulation schemes.
By contrast, the MMSE MUD exhibits a lower complexity at the expense of a performance
loss. In order to achieve a good performance–complexity trade-off, Genetic Algorithm (GA)
based MUD techniques are proposed for employment in channel-coded SDMA-OFDM systems,
where TTCM is used. Moreover, a novel Biased Q-function Based Mutation (BQM) assisted
Iterative GA (IGA) MUD is designed. The performance of the proposed BQM-IGA is compared
with both that of the optimum MLD and the linear MMSE MUD in the so-called fully loaded
and overloaded scenarios, respectively, where the number of users is equal to or higher than
the number of receiver antenna elements. Additionally, the computational complexity associated
with the various MUD schemes is discussed.
• Chapter 6: Direct-Sequence Spreading and Slow Subcarrier-Hopping Aided Multi-user
SDMA-OFDM Systems
This chapter commences with a short review of conventional SDMA-OFDM systems, followed
by an introduction to hybrid SDMA-OFDM arrangements, which incorporate Direct-Sequence
Spreading (DSS) and/or Frequency-Hopping (FH) techniques into conventional SDMA-OFDM.
A novel FH technique referred to as Slow SubCarrier Hopping (SSCH) is designed for hybrid
DSS/FH SDMA-OFDM systems using a TTCM scheme. Furthermore, two types of SSCH
pattern are discussed, namely the Random SSCH (RSSCH) and the Uniform SSCH (USSCH)
patterns. The performance of the proposed TTCM-assisted DSS/SSCH SDMA-OFDM system
is evaluated and compared with the conventional SDMA-OFDM and various hybrid SDMA-
OFDM conﬁgurations.
• Chapter 7: Channel Estimation for OFDM and MC-CDMA
We derive an advanced Decision Directed Channel Estimation (DDCE) scheme, which is capable
of recursive tracking and prediction of rapidly ﬂuctuating channel parameters, characterized
by time-variant statistics. More speciﬁcally, we employ a Projection Approximation Subspace
Tracking (PAST) [355] technique for the sake of tracking the channel transfer function’s low-
rank signal subspace and thus facilitating a high-accuracy tracking of the channel’s transfer
function, while imposing a relatively low computational complexity.
• Chapter 8: Iterative Joint Channel Estimation and MUD for SDMA-OFDM Systems
The objective of this chapter is to develop an efﬁcient solution to the channel estimation problem
of multi-user MIMO-OFDM systems. It is well known that, compared with SISOsystems,
channel estimation in the MIMO scenario becomes more challenging, owing to the increased
number of independent transmitter–receiver links to be estimated. Against this background,
an iterative, joint channel estimation and symbol detection approach is proposed for LDPC-
coded MIMO SDMA-OFDM systems. More speciﬁcally, the method modiﬁes the GA MUD
advocated in Chapter 5 so that it becomes capable of jointly optimizing the Frequency-Domain
CHannel Transfer Functions (FD-CHTFs) and the multi-user data symbols. Moreover, an
efﬁcient algorithm is derived, which enables the GA to output soft bits for the sake of improving
the performance of the LDPC channel decoder.
• Chapter 9: Reduced-Complexity Sphere Detection for Uncoded SDMA-OFDM Systems
The main objective of this chapter is systematically to review the fundamentals of the SD,
which is considered to be one of the most promising low-complexity near-optimum detection

35
techniques at the time of writing. Furthermore, we address the SD-related complexity reduction
issues. Speciﬁcally, the principle of the Hard-Input, Hard-Output (HIHO) SD is reviewed ﬁrst in
the context of both the depth-ﬁrst and breadth-ﬁrst tree search based scenarios, along with that of
the GSD, which is applicable to challenging rank-deﬁcient MIMO scenarios. A comprehensive
comparative study of the complexity reduction schemes devised for different types of SDs,
namely the conventional depth-ﬁrst SD, the K-best SD and the novel OHRSA detector, is
carried out by analysing their conceptual similarities and differences. Finally, their achievable
performance and the complexity imposed by the various types of SDs are investigated in
comparison with each other.
• Chapter 10: Reduced-Complexity Iterative Sphere Detection for Channel-Coded
SDMA-OFDM Systems
The fundamentals of the LSD scheme are studied at the beginning of this chapter in the context
of an iterative detection aided channel-coded MIMO-OFDM system. Potentially excessive
complexity may be imposed by the conventional LSD, since it has to generate soft information
for every transmitted bit, which requires the observation of a high number of hypotheses about
the transmitted MIMO symbol. Based on the above-mentioned complexity issue, we contrive a
generic centre-shifting SD scheme and the so-called a priori-LLR-threshold assisted SD scheme
with the aid of EXIT chart analysis, both of which are capable of effectively reducing the
potentially high complexity imposed by the SD-aided iterative receiver. Moreover, we combine
the above-mentioned schemes in the interest of further reducing the complexity imposed. In
addition, for the sake of enhancing the achievable iterative detention gains and hence improving
the bandwidth efﬁciency, a Unity-Rate Code (URC) assisted three-stage, serially concatenated
transceiver employing the so-called Irregular Convolutional Codes (IrCCs) is devised. Finally,
the beneﬁts of the proposed centre-shifting SD scheme are also investigated in the context of the
above-mentioned three-stage iterative receiver.
• Chapter 11: Sphere-Packing Modulated STBC-OFDM and its Sphere Detection
In this chapter we extend the employment of the turbo-detected Sphere Packing (SP) aided
Space–Time Block Coding (STBC) scheme to Multi-User MIMO (MU-MIMO) scenarios,
because SP was demonstrated to be capable of providing useful performance improvements
over conventionally modulated orthogonal design-based STBC schemes in the context of Single-
User MIMO (SU-MIMO) systems. For the sake of achieving a near-MAP performance, while
imposing a moderate complexity, we speciﬁcally design the K-best SD scheme for supporting
the operation of the SP-modulated system, since the conventional SD cannot be directly applied
to such a system. Consequently, when relying on our SD, a signiﬁcant performance gain can
be achieved by the SP-modulated system over its conventionally modulated counterpart in the
context of MU-MIMO systems.
• Chapter 12: Multiple-Symbol Differential Sphere Detection for Cooperative OFDM
The principle of the MSDSD is ﬁrst reviewed, as recently proposed for mitigating the time-
selective channel-induced performance loss suffered by classic direct transmission schemes
employing the Conventional Differential Detection (CDD) scheme. Then, we speciﬁcally
design the MSDSD for both the Differential Amplify-and-Forward (DAF) and Differential
Decode-and-Forward (DDF) assisted cooperative systems based on the multi-dimensional tree
search proposed in Chapter 4, which is capable of achieving a signiﬁcant performance gain
for transmission over time-selective channels induced by the relative mobility among the
cooperating transceivers.
• Chapter 13: Resource Allocation for the Differentially Modulated Cooperative UL
In this chapter the theoretical BER performance of both the DAF- and DDF-aided cooperative
cellular uplinks is investigated. Then, based on the minimum BER criterion, we design efﬁcient
Cooperating-User Selection (CUS) and Adaptive-Power Allocation (APA) schemes for the
above-mentioned two types of differentially modulated cooperative systems, while requiring

36
Chapter 1. Introduction to OFDM and MIMO-OFDM
no Channel State Information (CSI) at the receiver. Moreover, we investigate the Cooperative-
Protocol Selection (CPS) of the uplink system in conjunction with a beneﬁcial CUS as well as
the APA scheme in order to improve further the achievable end-to-end performance, leading to
a resource-optimized hybrid cooperative system. Hence, a number of cooperating MSs may be
adaptively selected from the available MS candidate pool and the cooperative protocol employed
by a speciﬁc cooperating MS may also be adaptively selected in the interest of achieving the best
possible BER performance.
• Chapter 14: The Near-Capacity Differentially Modulated Cooperative Cellular Uplink
The DDF-aided cooperative system’s DCMC capacity is investigated in comparison with that
of its classic direct-transmission-based counterpart in order to answer the grave fundamental
question of whether it is worth introducing cooperative mechanisms into the development of
wireless networks, such as the cellular voice and data networks. Then, we propose a practical
framework for designing a cooperative system which is capable of performing close to the
network’s corresponding non-coherent DCMC capacity. Based on our low-complexity, near-
capacity design criterion, a novel Irregular Distributed Hybrid Concatenated Differential (Ir-
DHCD) coding scheme is contrived for the DDF cooperative system employing our proposed
capacity-achieving, low-complexity, adaptive-window-aided, SISO iterative MSDSD scheme.
• Chapter 15: Multi-stream Detection for SDM-OFDM Systems
The multi-stream detection problem of SDM-OFDM systems is similar to the MUD techniques
of SDMA-OFDM arrangements, which are classiﬁed and reviewed in this chapter.
• Chapter 16: Approximate Log-MAP SDM-OFDM Multi-stream Detection
We propose the novel family of Optimized Hierarchy Reduced Search Algorithm (OHRSA)
aided space–time processing methods, which may be regarded as an advanced extension of the
Complex Sphere Decoder (CSD) method, portrayed in [337]. The algorithm proposed extends
the potential application range of the CSD methods of [335] and [337], as well as reducing
the associated computational complexity. Moreover, the OHRSA-aided SDM detector proposed
exhibits the near-optimum performance of the Log-MAP SDM detector, while imposing a
substantially lower computational complexity, which renders it an attractive design alternative
for practical systems.
• Chapter 17: Iterative Channel Estimation and Multi-stream Detection for SDM-OFDM
Finally, we propose an iterative turbo-receiver architecture, which utilizes both the soft-decision
feedback-aided MIMO channel estimation scheme of Chapter 7 as well as the Log-MAP SDM
detection method derived in Chapter 16. Additionally, we carry out an analysis of the associated
design trade-offs.
• Chapter 18: Summary, Conclusions and Future Research
The major ﬁndings of our work are summarized in this chapter, including our suggestions for
future research.

Chapter Summary
The historic development of various MIMO techniques was brieﬂy summarized in Section 1.1.1.1,
followed by a rudimentary introduction to MIMO-OFDM systems in Section 1.1.1.2. In Section 1.1.1.3

associated signal processing problems.

Chapter2
OFDM Standards
During the past decades, wireless communication has beneﬁtted from substantial advances and it is
considered as the key enabling technique of innovative future consumer products. For the sake of
satisfying the requirements of various applications, signiﬁcant technological achievements are required
to ensure that wireless devices have appropriate architectures suitable for supporting a wide range of
services delivered to the users.
In the foreseeable future, the large-scale employment of wireless devices and the requirements
of high-bandwidth applications are expected to lead to tremendous new challenges in terms of the
efﬁcient exploitation of the achievable spectral resources. New wireless techniques, such as Ultra
WideBand (UWB) [356], advanced source and channel encoding as well as various smart-antenna
techniques, e.g. Space–Time Codes (STCs) [314], Space-Division Multiple Access (SDMA) [3] and
beamforming, as well as other Multiple-Input, Multiple-Output (MIMO) [92] wireless architectures, are
capable of offering substantial improvements over classic communication systems. Hence researchers
have focused their attention on the next generation of wireless broadband communications systems,
which aim at delivering multimedia services requiring data rates much higher than existing ones.
Undoubtedly, supporting such high data rates while maintaining a high robustness against radio channel
impairments, such as multi-path fading and frequency-selective fading, requires further enhanced
system architectures.
The organization of this chapter is as follows. In Sections 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3, we review various major
international standards that adopt OFDM, namely Wi-Fi, the Third-Generation Partnership Project
(3GPP), Long-Term Evolution (LTE) and Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX),
respectively. Finally, we conclude the chapter in Section 2.4.
2.1
Wi-Fi
In 1999, the Wi-Fi Alliance was founded as a global, non-proﬁt organization, aimed at developing a
single globally accepted standard for high-speed WLANs. The mission of the Wi-Fi Alliance was to
promote Wi-Fi technology and the corresponding Wi-Fi product certiﬁcation. The Wi-Fi Alliance has
now more than 300 members from more than 20 countries and Wi-Fi has achieved huge worldwide
success. A study [357] released in September 2008 by the Wi-Fi Alliance found that an increased
number of consumers in the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan value the Wi-Fi Certiﬁed
brand. Developed in March 2000, the certiﬁcation programme has approved more than 4800 products
from various vendors worldwide.

Chapter 2. OFDM Standards
2.1.1
IEEE 802.11 Standards
Wi-Fi is based on the IEEE 802.11 standard family. The ﬁrst version of IEEE 802.11 was released in
1997 [358], which was rectiﬁed in 1999 [359]. Then, two further supplements of 802.11-1999 were
released, the ﬁrst one being IEEE 802.11a [360], which provides a bit rate of up to 54 Mbps in the
5 GHz band. In comparison with 802.11-1999, where Frequency-Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS) or
Direct-Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) are used, 802.11a employs an OFDM scheme, which applies
to Wireless Asynchronous Transfer Mode (WATM) networks and access hubs. The second supplement
to 802.11-1999 was IEEE 802.11b [361], which has a maximum data rate of 11 Mbps in the 2.4 GHz
band and uses the same media access method as that deﬁned in 802.11-1999.
Further enhancements to 802.11 were made later. The IEEE 802.11d-2001 standard [362] in-
troduced support for international roaming services. The IEEE 802.11g-2003 standard [363], which
exploits the same OFDM modulation scheme as 802.11a, provides a data rate of 20–54 Mbps in
the 2.4 GHz band. Other improvements include IEEE 802.11h [364], IEEE 802.11i [365] and IEEE
802.11j [366], which introduced spectrum and transmit power management in the 5 GHz band
in Europe, security enhancements and operation in the 4.9–5 GHz band in Japan, respectively. In
November 2005, the release of IEEE 802.11e-2005 [367] provided further QoS enhancements.
As the number of standards in the 802.11 family grew, it was proposed by the working group that a
single document combining all up-to-date 802.11 speciﬁcations should be provided. This resulted in the
IEEE 802.11-2007 standard [368], a new release that includes all previous 802.11 amendments. In 2008,
another two amendments were completed. The IEEE 802.11k-2008 [369] standard extends 802.11 by
specifying mechanisms for Radio Resource Measurement (RRM), and the IEEE 802.11r-2008 [370]
standard provides mechanisms for fast Basic Service Set (BSS) transition.
Some of the 802.11 standards are still in the draft stage, such as the IEEE 802.11n standard [56],
which aims at developing next-generation WLANs by incorporating MIMO-OFDM techniques. It
is expected to offer high-throughput wireless transmission at 100–200 Mbps. The IEEE 802.11y
standard [371] will provide support for operation in the 3650–3700 MHz band in the United States.
As a brief summary, we highlight the major 802.11 standards in Tables 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3.

The 3GPP is an international standardization body working on the speciﬁcation of the 3G Universal
Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN) and on the Global System for Mobile communications
(GSM). The latest speciﬁcation that is being studied and developed in 3GPP is an evolved 3G radio
access, widely known as LTE (Long-Term Evolution) or Evolved UTRAN (E-UTRAN), as well
as an evolved packet access core network in the System Architecture Evolution (SAE). The initial
requirements for LTE were set out in early 2005, which are brieﬂy summarized in Table 2.4 and in [372].
The initial objective of 3GPP was to produce global speciﬁcations for a 3G mobile system evolving
from the existing GSM core network. This includes the Wideband CDMA (WCDMA) based UTRA
Frequency-Division Duplex (FDD) mode and the Time-Division Code-Division Multiple Access (TD-
CDMA) based UTRA Time-Division Duplex (TDD) mode [374]. In December 2005, it was decided
that the LTE radio access should be based on OFDMA in the downlink (DL) and Single-Carrier
Frequency-Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA) in the uplink (UL). SC-FDMA is also known as
Discrete Fourier Transform Spread OFDMA (DFTS-OFDMA). The main PHY parameters of the LTE
DL are summarized in Table 2.5.
Brieﬂy, the objective of the SAE is to migrate circuit-switched networks towards packet-switched
networks. This is set out in the recent 3GPP releases, where an evolved packet core was deﬁned. The
main targets of SAE can be divided into the following aspects [374]:
• high-level user and operational aspects;
• basic capabilities;

WiMAX Evolution
The rapidly growing demand for ﬂexible, high-speed broadband services requires advanced commu-
nication technologies. The more conventional family of high-rate broadband access techniques has
relied on wired access, such as Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), cable modems, Ethernet and optical
ﬁbres. However, the extension of the coverage area results in a signiﬁcantly increased cost imposed by
building and maintaining wired networks. This is particularly true for less densely populated zones, e.g.
suburban and rural areas.
Hence, Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) techniques have emerged as potent competitors of their
conventional wired counterparts, facilitating the provision of broadband services for subscribers that
are far from the coverage area of the wired networks. Being ﬂexible, efﬁcient and cost-effective, BWA
provides an excellent solution to overcome the above-mentioned coverage problem. During the past
decade or so, a number of proprietary wireless access systems have been developed by the wireless
industry. Naturally, these proprietary products were based on diverse speciﬁcations, which inevitably
limited their applications and markets. As a matter of fact, the potential beneﬁts of BWA services were

not expected to be widely achieved owing to the lack of a common international standard, until the
emergence of the Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) standard [376].
WiMAX is one of the most popular BWA technologies available at the time of writing, aim-
ing to provide high-speed broadband wireless access for Wireless Metropolitan Area Networks
(WMANs) [377]. As a standardized technology, WiMAX ensures the interoperability of equipment
certiﬁed by the WiMAX Forum, resulting in a signiﬁcant cost reduction for service providers that
would like to use products manufactured by diverse vendors. This distinct advantage has paved the
way for global broadband wireless services. Another key beneﬁt of WiMAX is that it has been
optimized to offer excellent Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) coverage with the aid of advanced wireless
transmission techniques, such as MIMO transmit/receive diversity and Automatic Retransmission
Request (ARQ), etc. [378], combined with Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) or
Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) [378].
This section is organized as follows. In Section 2.3.1, we ﬁrst brieﬂy outline the historic background
of WiMAX. Speciﬁcally, the IEEE 802.16 standard family is reviewed in Section 2.3.1.1, which
has tight links to WiMAX, followed by the introduction of the WiMAX Forum in Section 2.3.1.3.
Then a brief introduction of the Korean WiMAX standard, Wireless Broadband (WiBro), is provided
in Section 2.3.1.4. In Section 2.3.2, we proceed with discussing the technical aspects of WiMAX,
including WiMAX-I in Section 2.3.2.1 and WiMAX-II in Section 2.3.2.2, respectively. The trends
concerning the future of WiMAX are summarized in Section 2.3.3.

Historic Background
In this section, we will commence by brieﬂy reviewing the IEEE 802.16 standard family in Sec-
tion 2.3.1.1, and portray the brief history of the WiMAX Forum in Section 2.3.1.3. The connection
between WiMAX and WiBro is established in Section 2.3.1.4.
2.3.1.1
IEEE 802.16 Standard Family
WiMAX is closely related to the IEEE 802.16 standard family. Before elaborating on WiMAX, let us
ﬁrst brieﬂy review the history of the IEEE 802.16 standards outlined in Table 2.6.
The IEEE 802.16 Working Group (WG) was chartered to deﬁne the air interface for BWA systems
in certain licensed frequency bands. The 802.16 speciﬁcations conform to the family of IEEE 802
standards, governing the Local Area Networks (LANs) and Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs)
endorsed by the IEEE in 1990 [388]. As opposed to the IEEE 802.11 WG, which focuses on Wireless
Local Area Network (WLAN) standards and applications, the IEEE 802.16 WG has been focused
on developing cost-efﬁcient point-to-multipoint BWA architectures that enable multimedia broadband
services in MANs and Wide Area Networks (WANs) [388].
2.3.1.2
Early 802.16 Standards
As early as 1998, the IEEE 802.16 group was formed to develop a radio standard for wireless
broadband communications. In December 2001, the ﬁrst member of the IEEE 802.16 standard family
was approved, widely referred to as IEEE 802.16-2001 [379]. It focuses on a Line-Of-Sight (LOS)
based point-to-multipoint wireless broadband system operating in the 10–66 GHz band. It utilizes a

802.16c-2002 [380] in December 2002, which provides detailed system proﬁles for the 10–66 GHz
band, and IEEE 802.16a-2003 [381] in April 2003, which presents some MAC modiﬁcations and

2.3.1.2.1
IEEE 802.16d-2004 – Fixed WiMAX
The IEEE 802.16 standards developed during the early stages tend to describe different parts of the
technology. In order to ease future developments, it was decided to merge the previous individual
versions into a single one, resulting in IEEE 802.16d-2004 [55], which is also frequently referred to
as IEEE 802.16-2004. For operational frequencies spanning from 10 to 66 GHz, the PHY is based on
SC modulation. For NLOS propagation conditions at frequencies below 11 GHz, the design alternatives
of SC, OFDM or OFDMA modulation can be used [55].
Early WiMAX solutions were based on the Wireless Metropolitan Area Network (WirelessMAN)
OFDM PHY of 802.16-2004. Therefore, 802.16-2004 is also known as ‘ﬁxed WiMAX’, due to the fact
that it does not support mobility.
2.3.1.2.2
IEEE 802.16e-2005 – Mobile WiMAX
In order to provide mobility support, the IEEE 802.16 working group continued its developments.
In December 2005, an amendment of IEEE 802.16-2004 was approved, which is known as IEEE
802.16e-2005 [382] or 802.16e in brief. In addition to numerous corrections to 802.16-2004 regarding
stationary operations, a key enhancement of this standard over its ancestors is that it supports subscriber

Wireless High-speed Unlicensed MAN (WirelessHUMAN) is
similar to WirelessMAN-OFDM, but mandates dynamic

Information Infrastructure (UNII) band [390]
stations moving at vehicular speeds and thereby speciﬁes a system for combined ﬁxed and mobile
BWA. The functions required to support higher-layer handover between base stations or sectors are also
speciﬁed. Its operation is limited to licensed bands suitable for mobility at carrier frequencies below
6 GHz. Furthermore, the previously developed stationary IEEE 802.16 subscriber capabilities are not
compromised [382].
Note that 802.16e itself is not a stand-alone document. More speciﬁcally, it only includes the
differences with respect to the 802.16-2004 document. Although, for the sake of simplicity, 802.16e
has been widely referred to as if it were a stand-alone standard, it is more natural to combine it with
802.16-2004 into a single consolidated version. This work is being conducted by the IEEE 802.16’s
Maintenance Task Group under the IEEE P802.16Rev2 Project. This will result in the second revision
of 802.16 since the releases of 802.16-2001 and 802.16-2004. It will consolidate 802.16-2004, 802.16e
as well as other 802.16 standards, such as 802.16f/g [383, 385]. The up-to-date working document for
this project is P802.16Rev2/D5 [389], which was released in June 2008.
The 802.16e standard formed the basis of WiMAX for nomadic and mobile applications. It is often
referred to as ‘mobile WiMAX’, as compared with ‘ﬁxed WiMAX’, which is synonymous with IEEE
802.16-2004. Since it evolved from 802.16-2004, 802.16e naturally embraces the different options
speciﬁed in its predecessor, which were designed to suit a variety of applications and deployment
scenarios. A brief summary of these options is provided in Table 2.7.
Apart from the similarities, there are also numerous differences. Some of the signiﬁcant changes of
802.16e in comparison with 802.16-2004 are [382,391] as follows:
• The terminology of Mobile Stations (MSs) is introduced. An MS is also a Subscriber Station
(SS) as referred to in the standard.
• MAC layer HandOver (HO) procedures are deﬁned, where an MS migrates from the area
serviced by one Base Station (BS) to another. In 802.16e, there are two HO variants:
1. Break-before-make HO (‘hard’ HO): An HO where communications with the target BS
only commence after relinquishing the link with the previous serving BS.
2. Make-before-break HO (‘soft’ HO): An HO where communications with the target BS
start before disconnection of the service with the previous serving BS. Two types of soft
HO are deﬁned, namely the Fast BS Switching (FBSS), where the MS may rapidly switch
from one BS to another, and the Macro Diversity HandOver (MDHO), where an MS
establishes links with more than one BS.

2.3.1. Historic Background
45
In order to facilitate power-efﬁcient MS operations and more efﬁcient HOs, two new power-
saving modes, namely the sleep mode and the idle mode, are introduced as complements to the
active mode already deﬁned in 802.16-2004.
• The concept of Scalable OFDMA (S-OFDMA) is introduced as part of the signiﬁcant revision
of the original WirelessMAN-OFDMA proﬁle in 802.16-2004. The S-OFDMA architecture
supports a wide range of bandwidths, ranging from 1.25 to 20 MHz with a ﬁxed subcarrier
spacing of 10.94 kHz for both ﬁxed and mobile operations. This has the great beneﬁt of ﬂexibly
addressing the need for various spectrum allocation schemes, potentially supporting global
requirements.
• In addition to the four scheduling services supported in 802.16-2004, which are the Unsolicited
Grant Service (UGS), real-time Polling Service (rtPS), non-real-time Polling Service (nrtPS)
and Best Effort (BE), a new class referred to as the extended real-time Polling Service (ertPS) is
included in 802.16e. The ertPS scheduling mechanism exploits the advantages of both UGS and
rtPS. It is capable of avoiding the latency of a bandwidth request, while catering for dynamic
resource allocations.
• New Multicast and Broadcast Services (MBSs) are introduced. Two types of access to MBSs may
be supported, namely single-BS access and multi-BS access. Single-BS access is implemented
for transmission over multicast and broadcast transport connections within the coverage area of
one BS, while multi-BS access is implemented by transmitting data from service ﬂows with the
aid of multiple BSs.
• The security sublayer is redeﬁned in order to remove some security ‘holes’ identiﬁed in 802.16-
2004, e.g. the non-existence of BS authentication, and to meet dedicated security requirements
for mobile services, which are typically more challenging than those designed for stationary
scenarios.
• Enhanced PHY technologies. The MIMO and Adaptive Antenna System (AAS) techniques of
802.16-2004 are substantially enhanced with the aid of more detailed implementation guidelines.
Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes are included as a further optional channel coding
scheme.
2.3.1.2.3
Other 802.16 Standards
Since the publication of 802.16-2004, there have been a few amendments. Besides 802.16e, recently
some further amendments have been completed, while others are still progressing at the time of writing,
as summarized in Table 2.6. The objective of these amendments to the original 802.16-2004 is to
improve speciﬁc system-related aspects, such as adding a more efﬁcient handover functionality, or to
include other aspects, such as system management information and procedures.
In December 2005, the IEEE 802.16f-2005 standard [383] was approved, which is the ﬁrst
amendment of 802.16-2004. This speciﬁcation deﬁnes a Management Information Base (MIB) for the
MAC and PHY layers, together with relevant management procedures, with the aim of providing high-
speed unlicensed MAN access.
Other completed 802.16 amendments include the IEEE 802.16k-2007 [384] and IEEE 802.16g-
2007 [385] standards, which were approved in August and December 2007, respectively. The former
amended the IEEE 802.1D [392] standard to support bridging of the IEEE 802.16 MAC layer. The
latter updates and expands 802.16 by deﬁning further management procedures as enhancements to the
air interface speciﬁed by 802.16 for ﬁxed and mobile broadband wireless systems. It speciﬁes the related
management functions, interfaces and protocol procedures.
The draft amendments which are still pending include the IEEE P802.16h [386] and P802.16j [387]
projects. The latest P802.16h working document, Draft 7, was released in June 2008. It speciﬁes
improved mechanisms, such as policies and MAC enhancements, to enable the coexistence of license-
exempt systems based on 802.16 and to facilitate the coexistence of these systems with primary users.

46
Chapter 2. OFDM Standards
Furthermore, it aims to improve the coexistence of 802.16 systems in non-exclusively assigned bands.
Some of the procedures deﬁned could be applied in other licensing cases, which require improved
intersystem coexistence [386].
The P802.16j project, on the other hand, speciﬁes OFDMA PHY and MAC enhancements of 802.16
for licensed bands in order to enable the operation of relay stations. It aims at improving the coverage,
throughput and system capacity of 802.16 networks by specifying 802.16 multi-hop relay capabilities
and functionalities of interoperable relay stations and BSs [387]. The SS speciﬁcations are not changed.
The most recent working document of P802.16j is Draft 5, which was released in May 2008.

In 802.16-2004 and 802.16e, SC, OFDM and OFDMA techniques are used, as summarized in Table 2.7.
Accordingly, there are multiple choices for the MAC layer structure, duplexing combinations, etc.
Although the variety of design options is sufﬁciently ﬂexible for diverse application and deployment
scenarios, it is not feasible to have a single system that is compatible with all these speciﬁcations. This
inevitably results in an interoperability problem. To overcome this problem, the standard should have a
limited scope, where the number of design and implementation options should be reduced.
Against this background, the WiMAX Forum was established in June 2001. It is an industry-led,
not-for-proﬁt organization of more than 520 companies, including over 200 operators [393]. Similar to
the Wi-Fi Alliance, which promotes the Wi-Fi standard as well as its product certiﬁcation, the WiMAX
Forum strives to accelerate the global adoption of WiMAX technology for the provision of broadband
wireless services. However, Wi-FI and WiMAX are not direct competitors for wireless broadband
subscribers or applications. Although both of them aim at providing wireless connectivity and Internet
access, they were designed for different application scenarios and thus become more complementary
than competitive. Wi-Fi covers a limited LAN area such as a home or an ofﬁce, while WiMAX is
designed to serve a much larger MAN area with a range of kilometres. Wi-Fi uses unlicensed spectra,
in contrast to WiMAX, which typically uses licensed spectra. Furthermore, they have different QoS
maintenance mechanisms.
The WiMAX Forum works closely with service providers, regulators, manufacturers, etc., to ensure
that WiMAX Forum Certiﬁed products are fully interoperable and capable of supporting both ﬁxed and
mobile broadband services. Its goal is to certify and promote broadband wireless products based upon
the harmonized IEEE 802.16 and European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) HiperMAN
standard [393]. The latter is commonly considered [394] as the European equivalent of IEEE 802.16
(or WiMAX), addressing spectrum access in spectral band ranges under 11 GHz. The WiMAX Forum
has been using 802.16-2004 and 802.16e to preselect appropriate options and parameter sets, in order to
remove the interoperability barrier and to reduce the associated implementational cost, while remaining
compatible with the ETSI HiperMAN standard.
More speciﬁcally, this is achieved by deﬁning a few system proﬁles and certiﬁcation proﬁles.
A system proﬁle is a collection of speciﬁc PHY and MAC layer features, which are selected from
the 802.16-2004 or 802.16e standards, respectively. Accordingly, this results in two categories: the
ﬁxed WiMAX proﬁles, which are built upon the WirelessMAN-OFDM PHY of 802.16-2004, and the
mobile WiMAX proﬁles, which are based on the scalable WirelessMAN-OFDMA PHY of 802.16e. It
is worth pointing out that the mandatory and optional status of a particular feature within a WiMAX
system proﬁle may be different from what it is in the original IEEE standard [376]. On the other hand, a
WiMAX certiﬁcation proﬁle is a particular instantiation of a WiMAX system proﬁle where the operating
frequency, channel bandwidth and duplexing mode are also speciﬁed. WiMAX equipment is certiﬁed
based on speciﬁc certiﬁcation proﬁles for meeting interoperability requirements [376]. If a device is
WiMAX Forum Certiﬁed, it is both compliant with the 802.16 standard and with devices from other
vendors, provided that they are also WiMAX Forum Certiﬁed. This will greatly reduce the cost for
service providers, since they can ﬂexibly ‘plug and play’ various certiﬁed WiMAX equipment, adapting
to new business needs without changing their overall infrastructures.

WiMAX and WiBro
The Wireless Broadband (WiBro) system constitutes a wireless Internet technology developed by the
Korean telecom industry. In February 2002, the Korean government allocated 100 MHz of spectrum
in the 2.3 GHz band, and in late 2004, WiBro Phase 1 was standardized by the Telecommunications
Technology Association (TTA) of Korea [388]. In June 2006, the ﬁrst commercial WiBro service was
launched in South Korea, by Korean Telecom and SK Telecom Co. Ltd. The service was based on
Intel’s WiMAX standard and mainly deployed in and around the Seoul area, the capital of South Korea.
It is worth pointing out that WiBro is synonymous to mobile WiMAX in Korea. It follows the same
standard, namely IEEE 802.16e-2005, the same set of system and certiﬁcation proﬁles, as well as the
same certiﬁcation processes as required by mobile WiMAX [395]. A brief comparison of WiBro and
the 802.16d/e standards is provided in Figure 2.1.
The features of WiBro, WLAN and cellular systems are given in Table 2.8. It can be seen that WiBro
combines the beneﬁts of WLAN and cellular services, providing high data rates, while improving the
coverage and mobility. In the future, it will evolve towards 4G networks, where the provision of even
higher data rates and mobility are expected, as illustrated in Figure 2.2.
2.3.2
Technical Aspects of WiMAX
WiMAX technology has been based on the IEEE 802.16-2004 and 802.16e-2005 standards, referred to
as ﬁxed WiMAX and mobile WiMAX, respectively. Mobile WiMAX is a broadband wireless solution
that enables the convergence of mobile and ﬁxed broadband networks with the aid of a common wide
area broadband radio access technology and ﬂexible network architecture [398].

WiMAX technology is based on the S-OFDMA air interface designed for achieving high spectral
efﬁciency and data rates. WiMAX users beneﬁt from broadband connectivity without the need for LOS
communications to the BS. A maximum data rate of up to 75 Mbps can be achieved with sufﬁcient
bandwidth, simultaneously supporting hundreds of residential and business areas by a single BS [377].
In the following sections, the technical aspects of WiMAX during its previous and ongoing stages
of evolution are summarized.
2.3.2.1
WiMAX-I: 802.16-2004 and 802.16e-2005
2.3.2.1.1
OFDMA System Conﬁguration
The concept of scalability was introduced in the IEEE 802.16 WirelessMAN-OFDMA [382] mode by
the 802.16 Task Group e (TGe). The S-OFDMA architecture supports a wide range of bandwidth, which
spans from 1.25 to 20 MHz, combined with ﬁxed subcarrier spacing for both ﬁxed and portable/mobile
uses, in order to address ﬂexibly the need for various spectrum allocation and application requirements.
The scalability is achieved by adjusting the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) size for various
channel bandwidths. In addition to this, 802.16e supports Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC)
subchannels, Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ), efﬁcient uplink subchannelization, MIMO-
aided transmit/receive diversity, etc. [399]. Table 2.9 summarizes the key parameters of 802.16e
S-OFDMA [382].
2.3.2.1.2
Frame Structure
OFDMA is used for both DL and UL transmissions in 802.16e. The OFDMA PHY mode is based
on one of the FFT sizes: 2048 (backward compatible to 802.16-2004 [55]), 1024, 512 and 128. This
facilitates the support for the various channel bandwidths. The MS may implement a scanning and
search mechanism to detect the DL signal, when performing initial network entry, and this may include
the detection of the dynamically conﬁgured FFT size and the channel bandwidth employed by the BS.
In licensed bands, the duplexing method shall be either FDD or TDD. FDD MSs may be half-duplex
FDD (H-FDD). In license-exempt bands, the duplexing method shall be TDD. Figure 2.3 shows an ex-
ample of an OFDMA frame (with only mandatory zone) in TDD mode. The OFDMA frame may include
multiple zones, such as Partial Usage of SubChannels (PUSC), Full Usage of Subchannels (FUSC),

PUSC with all subchannels, optional FUSC, AMC, etc. The transition between zones is indi-
cated in the DL-MAP by the standardized parameter STC DL Zone Information Element (IE) or
AAS DL IE [382]. No DL-MAP or UL-MAP allocations can span multiple zones. Figure 2.4 depicts
an OFDMA frame with multiple zones.
2.3.2.1.3
Subcarrier Mapping
For the OFDMA proﬁle of 802.16e, we have Fs = ﬂoor(n · BW /8000) · 8000 (Hz), where Fs is
the sampling frequency and n is the sampling factor, which is dependent on the bandwidth BW . After
removing the frequency-domain guard tones or virtual subcarriers from Nfft, which is the FFT size, one
obtains the set of ‘used’ subcarriers Nused. These used subcarriers are allocated to pilot subcarriers and
data subcarriers for both UL and DL.

50
Chapter 2. OFDM Standards
Figure 2.4: Example of a multi-zone OFDMA frame [382]. TUSC: Tile Usage of Subchannels.
However, there is a difference between the different possible zones. For the DL FUSC and PUSC,
the pilot tones are allocated ﬁrst, followed by the mapping of data subcarriers to subchannels (i.e.
subbands) exclusively allocated for data. For PUSC in the UL, the set of used subcarriers is ﬁrst
partitioned into subchannels and then the pilot subcarriers are allocated from within each subchannel.
Thus, in FUSC, there is one set of common pilot subcarriers for the entire frequency band, while in
PUSC of the DL, there is one set of common pilot subcarriers in each major group, which is constituted
by a few subchannels. By contrast, in PUSC of the UL, each subchannel contains its own set of pilot
subcarriers. After mapping all pilots to the associated subchannels, the remaining used subcarriers will
be grouped into data subchannels. For the different zones mentioned above, however, the corresponding
subcarrier allocation or permutation rules are different, although a sufﬁcient level of frequency and/or
time diversity should generally be maintained.
2.3.2.1.4
Channel Coding
The coding method used as the mandatory scheme in 802.16e is based on tail-biting Convolutional
Coding (CC). Optional coding schemes include the Block Turbo Coding (BTC), Convolutional Turbo
Codes (CTCs), zero-tailed CC and LDPC codes, which are not included in the earlier 802.16-2004
standard. The encoding block size depends on the number of subchannels allocated and on the
modulation scheme speciﬁed for the current transmission. For example, the LDPC code speciﬁcation of
802.16e is summarized in Table 2.10, where n is the codeword length, k is the information block length,
and the z factor is the expansion factor which is equal to n/24 for a given value of n. Note that, due
to the associated subchannelization constraints, the combination of coding parameters and modulation
schemes is not arbitrary.
2.3.2.1.5
MIMO Support
The AAS constitutes an integral part of 802.16e, which is included in order to attain a signiﬁcant system
capacity improvement. In 802.16e, the AAS may encompass different MIMO techniques, such as
Space–Time Block Coding (STBC), beamforming and Spatial Multiplexing (SM). The STBC adopted
is the well-known Alamouti code [400]. For the Open-Loop (OL) AAS, multiple antennas can be used
for STBC, SM or their combinations. When the Closed-Loop (CL) AAS is employed, either because
we can exploit the channel’s reciprocity in the TDD mode, or because the system has explicit receiver

feedback in the FDD mode, the multiple antennas can be used either for beamforming or for CL MIMO
by exploiting transmit antenna precoding techniques.
The general framework of CL MIMO in 802.16e is provided in Figure 2.5. It consists of an OL
space–time encoding unit and an MIMO precoding unit. The linear precoding matrix spreads the
various parallel streams across the various antennas with the aid of appropriate weighting factors. The
precoding matrix is then adapted on a regular basis according to the feedback information gleaned from
the receiver.

Chapter 2. OFDM Standards
2.3.2.1.6
Other Aspects
In 802.16e, a preamble is used for initial frame timing and frequency synchronization. Recall that
Figure 2.3 shows the OFDMA frame structure in the TDD mode, where the ﬁrst part of each frame is
dedicated to the preamble.
Synchronization is activated during the so-called ranging process, where the BS acquires the signals
of new subscribers and adjusts the timing of the existing subscribers through the feedback channel.
Synchronization is typically achieved by correlating the received signal against known preamble
sequences, taking advantage of the deliberately introduced periodicity of the signal. The results of the
correlation evaluation are then passed through a detector to determine whether a legitimate symbol was
sent and, if so, to adjust its exact timing.
The development of efﬁcient timing and frequency synchronization algorithms for 802.16e and
WiMAX systems is the responsibility of each equipment manufacturer. Some general principles for
timing and frequency synchronization can be found in [376].
The 802.16e standard also speciﬁes optional HARQ support, including the following modes:
• Incremental Redundancy (IR) for CTC;
• IR for CC;
• chase combining for all coding schemes.
Chase combining and IR are also referred to as type I and type II HARQ, respectively. These modes
can be speciﬁed by the normal map and the HARQ map [382].
Other PHY functionalities, such as control mechanisms, channel quality measurements, transmit-
ter/receiver requirements, as well as the speciﬁcation of the MAC and upper layers, are also detailed in
the standard [382]. For the reader’s convenience, we summarize the major PHY features of 802.16e in
Table 2.11.
2.3.2.2
WiMAX-II: 802.16m
In the International Telecommunications Union – Radio Communications Sector (ITU-R) WP5D
meeting held in Dubai during late June 2008, the technical system performance requirements for the
IMT-Advanced radio interface [401] were ﬁnalized. All IMT-Advanced proposals will be assessed
according to this requirement document. The ITU will then assess all technical submissions, review
the assessments, select one or more candidate technologies, and develop as well as rectify standards.
The evaluation guidelines were ﬁnalized in 2008 and it is anticipated that implementation efforts will
take place between 2011 and 2012, while a wide deployment may commence by 2015 [402].
In order to meet the anticipated high requirements of IMT-Advanced, in January 2007 the IEEE
started the speciﬁcation of a new version of the 802.16 standard, which aims at increasing the data
transmission rates up to 1 Gbps and 100 Mbps for ﬁxed and mobile communications, with improved
broadcast, multicast and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) performance, while maintaining backward
compatibility with existing WiMAX systems. Under the IEEE 802.16 umbrella, the newly formed
Task Group m (TGm) is chartered to develop an amendment of the 802.16 standard, specifying an
‘Air Interface for Fixed and Mobile Broadband Wireless Access Systems – Advanced Air Interface’,
which is referred to as the IEEE 802.16m standard. Also known as WiMAX-II, 802.16m is the only 4G
approach evolving from an existing OFDMA technology, namely from 802.16e or WiMAX-I, and will
be proposed as a 4G candidate for the ITU’s IMT-Advanced systems.
2.3.2.2.1
System Requirements
The ultimate mission of the 802.16m project is to draft an 802.16-compatible standard, which will
become a candidate for the IMT-Advanced evaluation process conducted by the ITU-R. To achieve this
target, a number of high-level system requirements have been identiﬁed by TGm, which are summarized
in the 802.16m System Requirement Document (SRD) [403] that was ﬁnalized in October 2007.

Chapter 2. OFDM Standards
Some of the key 802.16m requirements are [403] as follows:
• Backward compatibility: 802.16m shall provide continuing support and interoperability for
legacy WirelessMAN-OFDMA [382] equipment, including both MSs and BSs. More speciﬁ-
cally, the legacy 802.16e equipment shall be able to coexist with 802.16m equipment without
any performance degradation. Additionally, 802.16m shall provide the ability to disable legacy
support.
• Services: 802.16m should support legacy services more efﬁciently than the WirelessMAN-
OFDMA Reference System [404] as well as facilitate the introduction of new/emerging types
of services. Flexible services having different QoS levels should be supported, as required by
next-generation mobile networks.
• Operating frequencies and bandwidths: 802.16m systems shall operate at RFs less than 6 GHz
and be deployable in licensed spectrum allocated to the mobile and ﬁxed broadband services. It
shall be able to operate in frequency bands identiﬁed for IMT-Advanced. An 802.16m-compliant
system shall be capable of coexisting with other IMT-Advanced or IMT-2000 technologies.
Scalable bandwidths ranging from 5 to 20 MHz shall be supported.
• Support of advanced antenna techniques: 802.16m shall support MIMO, beamforming operation
or other advanced antenna techniques for single-user and multi-user scenarios. The minimum
number of transmit and receive antennas for the BS and the MS are 2×2 and 1×2, respectively.
• Minimum peak data rate: The baseline DL and UL peak data rates are 8 and 2.8 bps/Hz,
respectively. When more antennas are used, the rate requirements become 15 and 5.6 bps/Hz
for the DL and UL, respectively.
• Coexistence and co-deployment with other Radio Access Technologies (RATs): 802.16m shall
support interworking functionality, providing efﬁcient handover and allowing co-deployment
with other RATs, including IEEE 802.11 [368], 3GPP GSM/EDGE, UTRA/E-UTRA and 3GPP2
CDMA2000.
• Mobility and coverage: 802.16m shall support vehicular speeds of up to 350 km/h and provide a
cell coverage of up to even 100 km. For lower mobility and for areas closer to the cell centre, the
system’s performance should be optimized and degrade gracefully as a function of the vehicular
speed and/or the distance from the cell centre.
• MBS, Location-Based Service (LBS), relaying and self-organization support: 802.16m shall
support Enhanced Multicast and Broadcast Services (E-MBS) for IMT-Advanced multimedia
multicast broadcast services in a spectrally efﬁcient manner, provide mechanisms to enable
multi-hop relays including those that may involve advanced multiple-antenna techniques, and
support self-organizing mechanisms including self-conﬁguration and self-optimization.
For more details on the various aspects of the 802.16m system requirements, we refer to Tables 2.12,
2.13, 2.14 and 2.15.
2.3.2.2.2
System Description
In January 2008, TGm started to develop the 802.16m System Description Document (SDD) [406],
which aims to provide a detailed speciﬁcation of the 802.16m system that meets the requirements set
by 802.16m SRD [403]. Since the commencement of the SDD development, signiﬁcant efforts have
been made by the entire project group. A number of Rapporteur Groups (RGs) have been formed to
focus on dedicated topics, e.g. the frame structure RG, the multiple access RG, etc. Although technical
discussions are still ongoing, some high-level descriptions of the 802.16m system are already in place.
The Network Reference Model (NRM) of the 802.16m system is shown in Figure 2.6. The NRM
is a logical representation of the overall network architecture. It identiﬁes functional entities and
reference points used for ensuring that interoperability is achieved between functional entities, such as

without performance degradation; 802.16m shall provide the ability to

avoid excessive system complexity. Only the enhancements in those areas
where the WirelessMAN-OFDMA Reference System [404] fails to meet the
requirements should be provided
Services
802.16m should support legacy services more efﬁciently than the
WirelessMAN-OFDMA Reference System [404] and facilitate new/emerging
services. Flexible services with different QoS levels should be supported
Operating frequencies
802.16m systems shall operate at RFs less than 6 GHz in licensed spectrum. It
shall be able to operate in frequencies identiﬁed for IMT-Advanced. An
802.16m-compliant system shall be capable of coexisting with other
IMT-Advanced or IMT-2000 technologies.

antenna techniques
802.16m shall support MIMO, beamforming or other advanced antenna
techniques for single-user and multi-user scenarios. The minimum number of
transmit and receive antennas for BS and MS are 2 × 2 and 1 × 2,
respectively
the MS, Access Service Network (ASN) and Connectivity Service Network (CSN) [406]. The ASN
is deﬁned as a full set of network functions, including 802.16e/m Layer-1 (L1) and Layer-2 (L2)
connectivity between an 802.16m BS and an 802.16e/m MS, transfer of Authentication, Authorization
and Accounting (AAA) messages to an 802.16e/m subscriber’s Home Network Service Provider
(H-NSP), network discovery and selection of the subscriber’s preferred NSP, relay functionality for
establishing Layer-3 (L3) connectivity with an 802.16e/m MS, RRM, ASN/CSN anchored mobility,
paging, and so on [406].
An illustration of the 802.16m MS’s state transition process is provided in Figure 2.7 [406]. When
an MS is switched on, it will enter the initialization state, where the cell selection process is performed
by scanning and then synchronizing to a BS’s preamble, followed by acquiring the system conﬁguration
information through the Broadcast CHannel (BCH). If this is successful, the MS invokes the network
entry procedure, requesting for the entry to the selected BS, which results in a number of access
state procedures. More speciﬁcally, the ranging process is activated ﬁrst to attain UL synchronization,
followed by a ‘capability-negotiation’ step with the BS. Then the authentication and authorization
process will be invoked and the MS will be registered by the BS through the allocation of an 802.16m
speciﬁc ID. Upon successfully performing the access-state operations of Figure 2.7, the MS will enter
the connected state, which consists of three modes, namely the sleep mode, the active mode and the
scanning mode. Furthermore, in order to reduce the power consumption, the MS may enter the idle
state, which is constituted by two separate modes, namely the ‘paging available’ mode and the ‘paging
unavailable’ mode. During the idle state, the MS may switch to the access state, if required [406].
IEEE 802.16m supports both TDD and FDD modes, including H-FDD MS operation, in accordance
with the 802.16m SRD [403]. OFDMA is adopted as the multiple-access technique in both the DL and
UL. Figure 2.8 shows the basic frame structure of 802.16m, where the terminology of superframe and
subframe is introduced [406]. Each superframe is 20 ms long and consists of four equal-length radio
frames of 5 ms each. Each 5 ms radio frame consists of eight subframes, SF0, . . . , SF7, as seen in

operation. The number of DL/UL switching points in each TDD radio frame is either two or four. The

In order to ensure backward compatibility with legacy 802.16 equipment, the concept of time zone
is introduced in 802.16m, which is applied to both the TDD and FDD modes. The time zone is deﬁned
in terms of a non-zero integer number of consecutive subframes [406]. An example of TDD time zones
is portrayed in Figure 2.9. More speciﬁcally, two zones are multiplexed in the time domain for the DL,
one for 802.16m and the other for legacy systems. For UL transmissions, these will be multiplexed in
both the time and frequency domains. Note that the legacy MS can only be scheduled in the legacy
zones, while the 802.16m MS can be scheduled in both zones. If there is no legacy system in the
network, the legacy zones will be replaced by the expanded 802.16m zone for maximizing the system’s
efﬁciency [406].

The Future of WiMAX
In October 2007, the ITU formally accepted IEEE 802.16e-2005 Mobile WiMAX as the sixth
standardized terrestrial radio interface. This speciﬁc implementation, known as ‘IMT-2000 OFDMA
TDD WMAN’, is the version of the IEEE 802.16 standard supported in a proﬁle developed for
certiﬁcation purposes by the WiMAX Forum [407]. This will encourage its acceptance by regulatory
authorities and operators for allocating cellular spectrum and for future WiMAX deployment.
New products and impressive technical deployments have been stimulating the penetration of
WiMAX across the globe. Its rapid speed is driven by new equipment arriving from leading
manufacturers and suppliers, as well as by an increasing number of WiMAX trials and deployments
supported by telecom service providers. This list includes Alcatel-Lucent, Alvarion, AT&T, BT,
Clearwire, Fujitsu, Intel, Korea Telecom, Motorola, Nokia, Nortel, Redline Communications, Samsung,
Sequans, SR Telecom, Verizon, etc., who are actively paving the way for WiMAX evolution. It is
forecast that by 2010 the worldwide WiMAX market will reach $3.5 billion and account for 4% of all
broadband usage [402].

Figure 2.10: Forecast of WiMAX users by region 2007–2012 [408].
At the end of 2007, there were a total of 181 WiMAX operators globally. The WiMAX forum
expects this number to rise to 538 by 2012. Among the total of 234 countries in the world, the number
of those using WiMAX is anticipated to rise from 94 at the end of 2007 to 201 in 2012 [408]. It is also
forecast that by 2012 there will be about 134 million WiMAX users worldwide, with the main growth
coming from the Asia Paciﬁc and North America regions, as shown in Figure 2.10 [408].
In June 2008, the WiMAX Forum announced the ﬁrst WiMAX Forum Certiﬁed Mobile WiMAX
products, including four BSs and six mobile terminals, provided by eight WiMAX Forum member
companies, namely Airspan Networks, Alvarion, Beceem, Intel, Motorola, Samsung, Sequans and
ZyXEL [409]. The products are designed for the 2.5 GHz proﬁle.
The latest ofﬁcial schedule for the IEEE 802.16m standardization project was released in July 2008.
It aims to be in line with ITU’s time line of call for IMT-Advanced proposals – a critical time for the
further success of WiMAX in the future.

In this chapter, we have reviewed a range of major international standards that adopt OFDM. We
ﬁrst brieﬂy considered the history, milestones and main contributions in the OFDM literature in

Chapter 2. OFDM Standards
Section 1.1. Then in Section 2.1 we reviewed the Wi-Fi standard family, followed by Section 2.2
where the 3GPP LTE cellular standard was highlighted. A more detailed introduction of WiMAX was
presented in Section 2.3. More speciﬁcally, we brieﬂy reviewed the history of WiMAX in Section 2.3.1,
spanning from the early IEEE 802.16 standards in Section 2.3.1.2 to their recent amendments in
Sections 2.3.1.2.1, 2.3.1.2.2 and 2.3.1.2.3. Early WiMAX solutions were based on the WirelessMAN
OFDM PHY of 802.16-2004, which is also known as ‘ﬁxed WiMAX’. By contrast, as the successor
of 802.16-2004, the 802.16e standard incorporates mobility support and thus is referred to as ‘mobile
WiMAX’. In Section 2.3.1.3, the historic background of the WiMAX Forum was summarized, where
its mission and achievements were brieﬂy reviewed. Furthermore, we provided a brief introduction of
the Korean WiMAX standard WiBro in Section 2.3.1.4. Being the world’s largest commercial mobile
WiMAX deployment, the WiBro network is accelerating its evolution towards the 4G era.
In Section 2.3.2, we focused our attention on the technical aspects of WiMAX. More speciﬁcally,
the major PHY speciﬁcations of WiMAX-I, which were based on 802.16-2004 and 802.16e, were
provided in Section 2.3.2.1. These included the OFDMA system conﬁguration, frame structure,
subcarrier mapping, channel coding, MIMO support, etc. Moreover, in Section 2.3.2.2 the technical
requirements and system description of the 802.16m draft standard were presented. It is expected that
the 802.16m standard will be ﬁnalized during 2010. Finally, a brief discussion of the progress and future
of WiMAX was offered in Section 2.3.3.

Introduction
Increasing market expectations for 3G mobile radio systems show a great demand for a wider range
of services spanning from voice to high-rate data services required for supporting mobile multimedia
communications. This leads to higher technical speciﬁcations for existing and future communication
systems, which have to support data rates as high as 144 kbps in vehicular, 384 kbps in outdoor-to-
indoor and 2 Mbps in indoor and picocelluar environments [410].
The employment of multiple antennas constitutes an effective way of achieving an increased
capacity. The classic approach is to use multiple-receiver antennas and exploit Maximum Ratio
Combining (MRC) of the received signals for the sake of improving the system’s performance [411,
412]. However, the performance improvement of MRC is achieved at the cost of increasing the
complexity of the Mobile Stations (MSs). Alternatively, MRC may be employed at the Base Stations
(BSs), which support numerous MSs. While this scheme provides diversity gain for the BSs’ receivers,
the MSs cannot beneﬁt from it.
Employing multiple transmitters rather than receiver antennas at the BSs constitutes a further design
option in this context. Since transmitter diversity techniques are proposed for employment at the BSs,
it is possible to enhance the system’s integrity by upgrading the BSs. Alamouti [400] introduced an
attractive scheme, which uses two transmitters in conjunction with an arbitrary number of receivers
for communications in non-dispersive Rayleigh fading channels. Tarokh et al. [413, 414] generalized
Alamouti’s scheme to an arbitrary number of transmitters. These schemes introduced Space–Time
Block Codes (STBCs), which show remarkable encoding and decoding simplicity, while achieving
a good performance.
3.2
Space–Time Block Codes
In this section we will present the basic principles of space–time block codes. Before providing more
details, let us ﬁrst consider a simple STBC system communicating over uncorrelated Rayleigh fading
channels, as shown in Figure 3.1.

Figure 3.1: Schematic of Alamouti’s G2 space–time block code.
3.2.1
Alamouti’s G2 STBC
The system contains two transmitter antennas and one receiver antenna. The philosophy of Alamouti’s
G2 STBC is as follows.
In a conceptually simple approach we could argue that the achievable throughput of the system may
be doubled with the aid of the two transmitter antennas, if their signal could be separated by the receiver.
This task may be viewed as analogous to multi-user detection, where the two signals would arrive at
the BS’s receiver from two geographically separated users. From a simple conceptual perspective the
Bell Labs Layered Space–Time (BLAST) transmission scheme [105] adopts a similar principle for
increasing the achievable throughput of multiple-transmitter antenna-based systems.
By contrast, Alamouti’s approach is different, since the aim is to achieve a diversity gain rather
than to increase the achievable throughput. This is achieved by extending the duration of time allocated
to the transmission of a symbol by a factor of two and transmitting two independently faded and
‘appropriately transformed’ replicas of the symbol using each of the two antennas. The independence of
the two channels may be ascertained by positioning the transmitter antennas Tx 1 and Tx 2 sufﬁciently
far apart, e.g. at a distance of 10λ, where λ is the wavelength. Thus, during the ﬁrst time slot, the
information symbols x1 and x2 are transmitted by transmitter antennas Tx 1 and Tx 2, respectively,
and again each of the two symbols is transmitted through an independently faded channel. For the sake
of avoiding the channel-induced inter-symbol interference between the two time slots, both channels’
path gains are assumed to be constituted by a single propagation path given by
h1 = |h1|ejα1
(3.1)
h2 = |h2|ejα2,
(3.2)

3.2. Alamouti’s G2 STBC
65
where |h1|, |h2| are the fading magnitudes and α1, α2 are the corresponding phase rotations. The
complex fading envelopes are assumed to remain constant during the two consecutive time slots [314],
which is expressed as
h1 = h1(t = 1) = h1(t = 2)
(3.3)
h2 = h2(t = 1) = h2(t = 2).
(3.4)
Therefore we receive the composite signal y1 constituted by the superposition of the two transmitted
symbols through both channels:
y1 = h1x1 + h2x2 + n1,
(3.5)
where n1 is a complex noise sample. As mentioned above, during the second time slot, a transformed
version of the signals x1 and x2 is transmitted. Since the consecutive time slots are not faded
independently, no diversity gain would be achieved if we mapped these ‘transformed’ replicas of x1 and
x2 to the same transmitter antenna as during the ﬁrst time slot. Hence we now swap the assignment of
the time slots to transmitter antennas, since this way their independent fading may be ascertained. More
explicitly, during the second time slot, the negative version of the conjugate of x2 and the conjugate
of x1 are sent by transmitter antennas Tx 1 and Tx 2, respectively. However, as mentioned above, the
envelopes of each of the channels associated with the two transmitters are assumed to be the same as
during the ﬁrst time slot, hence we get the second transmitter’s signal y2 as
y2 = −h1¯x2 + h2¯x1 + n2,
(3.6)
where n2 is a complex noise sample. If the channels’ characteristics are known to the receiver, i.e. we
have a perfect channel estimator, the information symbols x1 and x2 can be readily separated in the
combiner of Figure 3.1, yielding
˜x1 = ¯h1y1 + h2¯y2
= ¯h1h1x1 + ¯h1h2x2 + ¯h1n1 −h2¯h1x2 + h2¯h2x1 + h2¯n2
= (|h1|2 + |h2|2)x1 + ¯h1n1 + h2¯n2
(3.7)
˜x2 = ¯h2y1 −h1¯y2
= ¯h2h1x1 + ¯h2h2x2 + ¯h2n1 + h1¯h1x2 −h1¯h2x1 −h1¯n2
= (|h1|2 + |h2|2)x2 + ¯h2n1 −h1¯n2,
(3.8)
where ˜x1 and ˜x2 are the extracted noisy signals. Then ˜x1 and ˜x2 will be forwarded to the maximum
likelihood detector of Figure 3.1, which determines the most likely transmitted symbols, namely ˆx1 and
ˆx2, by simply outputting the speciﬁc legitimate transmitted symbol, which has the lowest Euclidean
distance from the received channel-impaired symbol [314].
The equations above, which are based on the one-receiver scheme, can be generalized to multiple-
receiver aided schemes, where the received signal yj

yj

Chapter 3. Channel Coding Assisted STBC-OFDM Systems
3.2.2
Encoding Algorithm
In the previous section, we provided an example of a simple STBC communication system. Let us now
discuss STBCs in more depth.
3.2.2.1
Transmission Matrix
A generic STBC is deﬁned by an (n × p)-dimensional transmission matrix G, where the entries of
the matrix G are linear combinations of the k input symbols x1, x2, . . . , xk and their conjugates.
Each symbol xi (i = 1, . . . , k) conveys b original information bits according to the relevant signal
constellation that has M = 2b constellation points, and hence can be regarded as information symbols.
Thus, (k × b) input bits are conveyed by each (n × p) block. The general form of the transmission
matrix of SRBCs is given by Equation (3.12):
G =


g11
g12
· · ·
g1p
g21
g22
· · ·
g2p
...
...
...
...
gn1
gn2
· · ·
gnp

,
(3.12)
where the entries gij (i = 1, . . . , n; j = 1, . . . , p) represent the linear combinations of the information
symbols xi (i = 1, . . . , k) and their conjugates. In the transmission matrix G, which can be viewed as
a space–time encoding block, the number of rows (namely n) is equal to the number of time slots, while
the number of columns (namely p) is equal to the number of transmitter antennas. For example, during
time slot i = 1, the encoded symbols g11, g12, . . . , g1p are transmitted simultaneously from transmitter
antennas Tx 1, Tx 2, . . . , Tx p, respectively.
References [400,413] have deﬁned a range of STBCs. Different designs of the transmission matrix
seen in Equation (3.12) will result in different encoding algorithms and code rates. Generally, the code
rate is deﬁned as
R = k/n,
(3.13)
where k is the number of possible input information symbols, and n is the number of time slots.
3.2.2.2
Encoding Algorithm of the STBC G2
From Section 3.2.1 and Equation (3.12) we can readily derive the G2 transmission matrix in the form of
G2 =
	g11
g12
g21
g22

(3.14)
or, more speciﬁcally, as
G2 =
	 x1
x2
−¯x2
¯x1

.
(3.15)
From Equation (3.15), it can be readily seen that there are n = 2 rows in the G2 matrix associated with
two time slots and p = 2 columns corresponding to two transmitter antennas, as we have already seen
in the example of Figure 3.1. Since there are k = 2 input symbols, namely x1 and x2, the code rate of
G2 is R = k/n = 1.
3.2.2.3
Other STBCs
The G2 STBC was ﬁrst proposed by Alamouti [400] in 1998. This code has attracted much attention
because of its appealing simplicity compared with the family of Space–Time Trellis Codes (STTCs)
proposed in [415–418], although this simplicity was achieved at the cost of a performance loss.
Later, Tarokh et al. [413] extended Alamouti’s scheme to multiple transmitters, which led to other
STBCs, such as the three-transmitter code G3 and four-transmitter code G4. The transmission matrix

From Equations (3.16) and (3.17), we can see that the code rates of G3 and G4 are reduced to a
half, which degrades the bandwidth efﬁciency. However, the STBCs H3 and H4 of [413] mitigate
this problem, since their code rate is 3/4. The transmission matrices of H3 and H4 [413] are deﬁned as

In conclusion, the parameters of the STBCs mentioned above are summarized in Table 3.1.
3.2.3
Decoding Algorithm
In this section, two algorithms are brieﬂy discussed, which are widely used for decoding STBCs. The
maximum likelihood (ML) decoding algorithm generates hard-decision outputs, while the Maximum-
A-Posteriori (MAP) decoding algorithm is capable of providing soft outputs, which readily lend
themselves to channel coding for the sake of achieving further performance improvements.
3.2.3.1
Maximum Likelihood Decoding
ML decoding of STBCs can be achieved using simple linear processing at the receiver, thus maintaining
a low decoding complexity. As mentioned in Section 3.2.1, when the space–time coded symbols are
transmitted over different channels and arrive at the receiver during time slot t (t = 1, . . . , n), we will

Alamouti [400] ﬁrst proposed a simple ML decoding algorithm for the G2 STBC. Tarokh
et al. [414] extended it for the STBCs summarized in Table 3.1. The algorithm exploits the orthogonal
structure of the STBCs for decoupling the signals transmitted from different antennas rather than
requiring their joint detection. According to [414], low-complexity signal processing may be invoked
for separating the channel-impaired transmitted signal yj
t into k decision metrics, each of which
corresponds to the channel-impaired version of a speciﬁc information symbol of the set xi, i =
1, . . . , k. For example, for the G2 STBC, we will minimize the decision metric

3.2.3.2
Maximum-A-Posteriori Decoding
As seen in Equations (3.21) and (3.22), hard decisions would have to be made in order to generate the
decoded outputs, which are the most likely transmitted information symbols. In other words, the usual
ML detection is a hard-decoding method. However, in most practical systems various channel codes,
such as Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes [419] or turbo codes [314, 420, 421], may have to
be combined with STBCs for the sake of further improving the system’s performance. In this case, the
space–time decoder must provide soft outputs, which can be efﬁciently utilized by the channel decoder.
Bauch [422] presented a simple symbol-by-symbol MAP algorithm for decoding STBCs. Accord-
ing to [422], the a posteriori probability of each information symbol xi (i = 1, . . . , k) is
ln P(xi|y1, y2, . . . , yq) = const + ln P(y1, y2, . . . , yq|xi) + ln P(xi),
(3.23)
where yj = [yj
1, yj
2, . . . , yj
n] (j = 1, . . . , q) represents the received signal vector at receiver j during
the period spanning from time slot 1 to time slot n. For example, for the STBC G2 (k = 2, n = 2) the

(3.25)
We can see that Equations (3.24) and (3.25) are quite similar to Equations (3.21) and (3.22), respectively.
In fact, it can be shown that Bauch’s MAP algorithms can be extended for decoding other STBCs, such
as G3, G4, H3 and H4, and the corresponding algorithms also resemble the ML algorithms [314]
discussed in Section 3.2.3.1. Given the a posteriori probabilities of the symbols, we can derive the
corresponding a posteriori probabilities of the bits (i.e. the corresponding soft outputs) using the
symbol-to-bit probability conversion of
P(di = 0) =

P(xj|y1, y2, . . . , yq),


j
P(xj|y1, y2, . . . , yq),
∀xj = (d1 . . . di . . . db),
di = 1,
(3.27)
where P(di = 0) or P(di = 1) represents the probability of the ith bit, namely di, of the b-bit symbol
being zero and one, respectively. Let us consider the QPSK modulation scheme for example. The phasor
constellation of QPSK is shown in Figure 3.2.
As seen in Figure 3.2, each constellation point consists of 2 bits, hence the constellation points can
be represented as
xj = (d2d1),
j = {1, . . . , 4},
(3.28)
where di
= {0, 1}. With the aid of Equations (3.26) and (3.27), we generate the a posteriori
probabilities of each bit, taking into account that d1 assumes a value of zero only in x1 and x3, while
d2 in x1 and x2, etc., yielding

Then the relevant soft outputs can be forwarded to the channel decoders, which will make a hard
decision to ﬁnally decode the received signals.
In practical applications, however, the Max-Log-MAP [423, 424] or Log-MAP [425] algorithms
are usually preferred [314], since either one can lower the computational complexity to some degree.
The Max-Log-MAP algorithm was proposed by both Koch and Baier [423] and Erfanian et al. [424]
for reducing the complexity of the MAP algorithm. This technique transfers the computation into the
logarithmic domain and invokes an approximation for dramatically reducing the complexity imposed.
As a consequence of using an approximation, its performance is suboptimal. However, Robertson
et al. [425] later proposed the Log-MAP algorithm, which partially corrected the approximation invoked
in the Max-Log-MAP algorithm. Hence the performance of the Log-MAP algorithm is similar to that
of the MAP algorithm, which is achieved at a signiﬁcantly lower complexity. More details of the Max-
Log-MAP and Log-MAP algorithms may be found in [314]. In our STBC soft decoder, the Log-MAP
algorithm is employed. In the rest of this section we will characterize the achievable performance of a
range of STBC schemes.
3.2.4
System Overview
Figure 3.3 shows the structure of the simulation system used. As seen in the ﬁgure, the mapper maps
the source information bits to relevant phasor constellation points employed by the speciﬁc modulation
scheme used. Then the symbols are forwarded to the space–time encoder. The encoded symbols are then
transmitted through different antennas and arrive at the receiver(s), where the received signals will be
decoded by the space–time decoder. Finally, the demapper converts the STBC-decoded symbols back
to the information bits and the Bit Error Rate (BER) is calculated. The parameters of all the STBCs
studied are summarized in Table 3.1. The following assumptions were used:
• Signals are transmitted over uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels.
• The channels are quasi-static so that the path gains are constant across n consecutive time slots,
corresponding to the n rows of the STBCs’ transmission matrix.
• The average signal power received from each transmitter antenna is the same.
• The receiver has perfect knowledge of the channels’ fading amplitudes.
These assumptions simplify the simulations to a degree, therefore the system concerned is not a realistic
one. However, since the experimental circumstances are identical for all performance comparisons, the
results characterize the relative performance of various STBCs.
3.2.5
Simulation Results
In the previous sections, the basic principles of STBCs as well as the simulation conditions were
presented. In this section, our simulation results will be provided for the sake of comparatively studying
the performance of the various STBCs of Table 3.1.

3.2.5.1
Performance over Uncorrelated Rayleigh Fading Channels
Performance at the Throughput of 1 BPS
Figure 3.4 compares the performance of the G2, G3 and
G4 STBCs in conjunction with one receiver at the throughput of 1 BPS (Bits Per Symbol) over the
uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channel. Binary Phase-Shift Keying (BPSK) modulation is employed in
conjunction with the space–time code G2, while QPSK modulation is considered with the half-rate
space–time codes G3 and G4 so that the system throughput remains at 1 BPS. From Figure 3.4 we can
see that at the BER of 10−5 the G3 and G4 codes provide an approximately 5.5 and 7.5 dB gain over
the G2 code, respectively. If we add one more receiver in the context of all of these schemes, as seen
in Figure 3.5, the relevant Eb/N0 gain of the G3 and G4 schemes over the G2 arrangement reduces to
2.5 and 3.5 dB, respectively. This may suggest that the G2 code using two receivers has achieved most
of the attainable diversity gain [314], and hence, even if we further increase the number of transmitter
antennas, the performance cannot be signiﬁcantly improved.
Performance at the Throughput of 2 BPS
In Figure 3.6 the performances of the STBCs using
one receiver and having a throughput of about 2 BPS over uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels are
compared. In order to meet the 2 BPS throughput criteria, QPSK modulation is used for the G2 code,
while 16-QAM is employed for the G3 and G4 arrangements, as the latter ones are half-rate codes.
However, for the 3
4-rate codes H3 and H4, an exact throughput of 2 BPS cannot be achieved. Thus we
chose 8-PSK and the throughput of the H3 and H4 schemes became 2.25 BPS, which is close to 2 BPS.
From Figure 3.6 we can see that when the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is low, i.e. Eb/N0 is below
12.5 dB, the STBC G2 performs better than other codes, although the performance difference is not
signiﬁcant. When Eb/N0 increases to a value higher than 12.5 dB, however, the G4 code outperforms
other codes, having an approximately 1 dB gain over the H4 code at the BER of 10−5. Similarly, the
G3 code achieves an approximately 1 dB gain over the H3 code at the BER of 10−5. We may note
that, although the G3 and G4 codes employ a higher-order 16-QAM modulation scheme, which is more
vulnerable to channel effects than the lower-order 8-PSK modulation scheme used by the H3 and H4
codes, the former performs slightly better than the latter.
In the scenario of using two receivers, however, the G2 code stands out in comparison with
all the candidates, as Figure 3.7 indicates. This result suggests that the attainable diversity gain has

already been achieved by the G2 code using two receivers. Furthermore, the potential beneﬁt of using
more transmitters is eroded by the employment of higher-throughput, but more vulnerable, modulation
schemes, which are more prone to transmission errors.
Performance at the Throughput of 3 BPS
The performances of the STBCs using one receiver and
having a throughput of 3 BPS over uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels are compared in Figure 3.8.
Again, similar to the scenario of having a throughput of 2 BPS, the G2 code performs best at a low SNR,

i.e. below about 10 dB, although the performance difference between G2 and other codes is even smaller
than it is in Figure 3.6. As shown in Figure 3.8, at the BER of 10−5, the H3 and H4 codes achieve a gain
of about 3 dB over the G3 and G4 codes, respectively. Since the STBCs themselves do not have an error-
correction capability which would allow them to correct the extra errors induced by employing a more
vulnerable, higher-order modulation scheme [314], this results in a poorer performance. Furthermore,
since the relative increase of the constellation density when changing from 16-QAM to 64-QAM is
higher than that from 8-PSK to 16-QAM, the performance degradation imposed by reverting from 16-
QAM to 64-QAM is more severe than that imposed by opting for 16-QAM instead of 8-PSK. Therefore
it is not surprising that the best code to be used for high-SNR situations becomes the H4 instead of the
G4 code, which was the best code according to Figure 3.6 at high-SNR scenarios, since the G4 and
H4 codes are used in conjunction with 64-QAM and 16-QAM, respectively. Moreover, we note that the
H3 code gives approximately 0.4 dB gain over the G4 code, although the former has a lower diversity
order.
If the number of receivers is doubled, as seen in Figure 3.9, the performance degradations of the G3
and G4 codes are much more dramatic. In this scenario, even the lower-diversity space–time code G2
is capable of outperforming the space–time code G4 having a higher-order diversity by about 1.7 dB at
the BER of 10−5.
3.2.5.2
Performance over Correlated Rayleigh Fading Channel
We have compared the performances of the STBCs of Table 3.1 for transmission over uncorrelated
Rayleigh fading channels in Section 3.2.5.1. In this section, the performance of the STBCs will be
studied based on the same assumptions noted on page 70, except that the channel is assumed to be a
correlated Rayleigh fading channel associated with the normalized Doppler frequency of 3.25 × 10−5.
Speciﬁcally, Figure 3.10 compares the performance of the G2, G3 and G4 STBCs in conjunction
with one receiver at the throughput of 1 BPS, when communicating over a correlated Rayleigh fading
channel. If we compare Figure 3.10 with Figure 3.4, which shows the relevant codes’ performance over
uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels, we will note that the performances recorded in these cases are

almost the same. This is because the receiver is aided by a perfect channel estimator that provides full
knowledge of the path gains, and thus the effect imposed on the transmitted signals by the different
path gains, regardless of whether they are correlated or uncorrelated, is efﬁciently counteracted. When
the throughput increases to 2 BPS and even further to 3 BPS, it can also be shown that the achievable
performances of STBCs communicating over a correlated Rayleigh channel are the same as those of
their corresponding counterparts transmitting over uncorrelated Rayleigh channels, respectively.

Conclusions
From the discussions and simulation results of Sections 3.2.5.1 and 3.2.5.2, several conclusions can be
inferred. Firstly, the encoding and decoding of STBCs have a low complexity. At the receiver end, the
ML decoder requires low-complexity linear processing for decoding.
Secondly, from Figures 3.4, 3.6 and 3.8 we note that when the effective throughput is increased,
the phasor constellation has to be extended to accommodate the increased number of bits. Hence the
performances of the half-rate codes G3 and G4 degrade in comparison with that of the unity-rate
code G2.
Thirdly, at the even higher effective throughput of 3 BPS, the H3 and H4 codes perform better than
the G3 and G4 codes, respectively, as shown in Figure 3.8. Moreover, according to Figures 3.4, 3.5, 3.8
and 3.9, when the number of receivers is increased, the performance gain of the G3, G4, H3 and H4
codes over the G2 code becomes more modest because much of the attainable diversity gain has already
been achieved using the G2 code employing two receivers.
Last but not least, it was also found that the performances of the space–time codes communicating
over uncorrelated and correlated Rayleigh fading channels are similar, provided that the effective
throughput is the same.
The achievable coding gains of the STBCs are summarized in Table 3.2. The coding gain is deﬁned
as the Eb/N0 difference, expressed in terms of decibels, at a BER of 10−5 between the various space–
time block coded and uncoded single-transmitter systems having the same throughput. The best schemes
at the effective throughputs of 1, 2 and 3 BPS are printed in bold, respectively.

Channel-Coded STBCs
In Section 3.2, we presented the basic concepts of the STBCs and provided a range of characteristic
performance results. Furthermore, the MAP algorithm invoked for decoding STBCs has also been
brieﬂy highlighted. This enables a space–time decoder to provide soft outputs that can be exploited
by concatenated channel decoders for further improving the system’s performance. In this section, we

will concatenate the STBCs with various Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) channel codes [419] and
with a Turbo Convolutional (TC) code [420,421]. The performances of the different schemes will also
be evaluated.
3.3.1
STBCs with LDPC Channel Codes
LDPC codes were devised by Gallager [419] in 1962. During the early evolutionary phase of channel
coding, LDPC schemes had a limited impact on the research of the channel coding community, although
they showed an unprecedented performance prior to the turbo-coding era. This was because LDPC
codes required a relatively high storage space and complexity. However, owing to their capability of
approaching Shannon’s predicted performance limits [426], research interests in LDPC codes have
been rekindled during recent years [426–430].
LDPC codes [419] belong to the family of linear block codes which are deﬁned by a parity
check matrix having M rows and N columns. The column weight j and row weight k are typically
signiﬁcantly lower than the dimensions M and N of the parity check matrix. The construction of the
parity check matrix is referred to as regular or irregular, depending on whether the Hamming weight
per column or row is identical. Reference [428] shows that carefully designed irregular LDPC codes
may perform better than their regular counterparts. Furthermore, when the block length is increased,
irregular LDPC codes may become capable of outperforming turbo codes [426] at the cost of a higher
complexity. Since the details of the decoding of LDPC codes can be found in [431], in the forthcoming
sections we are more interested in the performance of LDPC codes than the LDPC decoding algorithm
itself.
The number of columns N is given by the number of coded bits hosted by an LDPC codeword,
while the number of rows M corresponds to the number of parity check constraints imposed by the
design of the LDPC code. The number of information bits encoded by an LDPC codeword is denoted

by K = N −M, yielding a coding rate of K/M [431]. Thus, the LDPC code rate can be adjusted by
changing K and/or M.
Figure 3.11 characterizes the performance of several LDPC codes for transmission over both
uncorrelated and correlated Rayleigh fading channels. The normalized Doppler frequency of the
correlated Rayleigh channel was 3.25 × 10−5. It was found that the LDPC codes perform far better
over uncorrelated than over correlated Rayleigh channels, since the codeword length is short. This
characteristic predetermines the expected performance of the LDPC-STBC coded concatenated system
to be introduced in the next section and characterized in Section 3.3.1.2.2.
3.3.1.1
System Overview
Figure 3.12 shows a schematic diagram of the system. The source bits are ﬁrst encoded by the LDPC
encoder, whose outputs are modulated and forwarded to the STBC encoder. At the receiver, the noise-
contaminated received symbols are decoded by the STBC soft decoder. As discussed in Section 3.2.3.2,
the soft outputs constituted by the a posteriori probabilities of the STBC-decoded symbols will be
passed on to the soft demapper, where the symbol probabilities are used for generating the resultant bit
probabilities. Finally, the LDPC decoder decodes the soft inputs and the channel-decoded information
bits are obtained.
In Section 3.3.1.2, we will provide a range of simulation results and compare the achievable
performances of the different schemes designed for transmission over both uncorrelated and correlated
Rayleigh fading channels. According to [431], when using different column weights j and/or a different
number of LDPC decoding iterations, the performance of LDPC codes will change correspondingly. In
our system, we ﬁx the column weight and the number of iterations to 3 and 25, respectively. For the
scenarios of communicating over correlated Rayleigh fading channels, a ﬁxed-length random channel
interleaver was used. Furthermore, for the sake of fair comparisons, we comply with the assumptions

context.
The parameters used in our LDPC-STBC coded concatenated system are given in Tables 3.3
and 3.4, while the parameters of the STBCs have been given in Table 3.1. For the sake of maintaining
the same effective throughput, the LDPC codec’s parameters have to be harmonized with the STBC
codec’s parameters.

Performance over Uncorrelated Rayleigh Fading Channels
Performance at the Throughput of 1 BPS
Figure 3.13 compares the achievable performance of the
G2, G3, G4, H3 and H4 STBCs, which are combined with various LDPC codes, in the context of using
one receiver and maintaining a throughput of 1 BPS, while communicating over uncorrelated Rayleigh
fading channels. We can see that when Eb/N0 is lower than about 2.7 dB, the half-rate STBC G4, using
QPSK modulation, which constituted the best system at the throughput of 1 BPS according to Table 3.2,
gives the best performance. But when the SNR increases, the situation reverses since the performance
of the LDPC-assisted STBCs becomes signiﬁcantly better than that of the G4 scheme using no channel
coding. Moreover, the scheme constituted by the G2 code and half-rate LDPC code excels among all the
LDPC-coded STBC schemes by a margin of about 2 dB gain over others. Note that in order to maintain
the same effective throughput of 1 BPS, the unity-rate STBC G2 is combined with the half-rate LDPC
code employing QPSK modulation, while the half-rate space–time codes G3 and G4 assisted by the
half-rate LDPC code use 16-QAM modulation. For the 3
4-rate codes H3 and H4, the 2
3-rate LDPC code
is introduced and QPSK modulation is used to meet the criteria of having the same throughput of 1 BPS.
From Figure 3.13, we may arrive at the following conclusions. Provided that a ﬁxed block size of the
LDPC codeword is used, a lower LDPC code rate implies that more parity check bits are attached to the
original bits sequence, which leads to a better performance. On the other hand, as seen in Figure 3.13,
when QPSK modulation is used, the G2 code employing the half-rate LDPC code outperforms the H3
and H4 codes in conjunction with the 2
3-rate LDPC code, despite the fact that the former has a lower
diversity order. Therefore we may surmise for the set of LDPC-coded STBC schemes considered that,
when using a speciﬁc modulation scheme, the system’s performance is predominantly determined by
the LDPC code employed instead of the space–time code’s diversity order. Another observation from
the ﬁgure is that the number of bits per symbol used by the speciﬁc modulation scheme is a more
decisive factor, in terms of determining the achievable performance, than the diversity order, when the
same LDPC code is used. In other words, if we want to improve the system’s performance, it is more
beneﬁcial to reduce the number of bits per symbol instead of increasing the number of transmitter

antennas. For example, when employing a half-rate LDPC code, the G3 and G4 space–time codes
employing 16-QAM perform about 2.2 dB worse than the G2 code employing QPSK, despite the fact
that the former has a higher diversity order.
Performance at the Throughput of 2 BPS
In Figure 3.14 the performance of the LDPC-aided
STBCs using one receiver and having a throughput of about 2 BPS, while communicating over
uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels, is studied. Especially, the 3
4-rate codes H3 and H4 are employed
in conjunction with the half-rate LDPC code using 64-QAM modulation, and thus achieve an effective
throughput of 2.25 BPS, which is close to our target of 2 BPS.
The curves seen in Figure 3.14 can be divided into two groups based on their relative performances.
The ﬁrst group contains the three schemes employing the G2 code in conjunction with various LDPC
codes and gives an average gain of about 3 dB over the members of the second group, in which the
G3/G4/H3/H4 schemes are grouped. The performance difference between the two groups tallies with
our conclusions derived in the case of aiming for a throughput of 1 BPS. As seen in Figure 3.14,
the schemes of the second group suffer performance degradations as a consequence of employing
the densely packed 64-QAM constellation, which is more prone to transmission errors than the other
modulation schemes. Furthermore, the 64-QAM-based scheme of the ﬁrst group, i.e. the arrangement
employing the G2 code as well as the 1
3-rate LDPC code, also performs better than any member scheme
of the second group as a beneﬁt of its lower LDPC code rate.
As seen in Figure 3.14, in all the three G2-based schemes of the superior group, the best design
option is the compromise scheme employing the half-rate LDPC-aided G2 code using 16-QAM
modulation. The reason for this phenomenon can be explained from two different aspects. On the
one hand, when the number of bits per symbol is moderate, as in relatively lower-order 8-PSK and
16-QAM, for example, the performance trends imposed by the different LDPC codes outweigh those
caused by the different modulation schemes. In this case, as expected, if the system uses a lower-rate
LDPC code, it will achieve a better performance. This is why the half-rate LDPC-coded scheme using
16-QAM modulation is superior to the 2
3-rate LDPC-coded scheme using 8-PSK modulation, as seen
in Figure 3.14. On the other hand, when the modulation level is increased to 64, for example, as in

64-QAM, the situation is reversed and the number of bits per symbol conveyed by the modulation
schemes will become the predominant factor. In this case, the combination of lower-rate LDPC codes
with high-order modulation arrangements will no longer outperform the scheme that uses higher-rate
LDPC codes in conjunction with lower-order modulation constellations. Hence the
1
3-rate LDPC-
coded 64-QAM modulation scheme is outperformed by the half-rate LDPC-coded 16-QAM modulation
arrangement, as indicated by Figure 3.14.
Performance at the Throughput of 3 BPS
The performance of the LDPC-assisted STBCs using one
receiver and having a throughput of 3 BPS for transmissions over uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels
is shown in Figure 3.15. When the half-rate space–time codes G3 and G4 are used in conjunction with
LDPC codes, even if we employ a high-throughput 64-QAM scheme, the system’s effective throughput
will be lower than 3 BPS, because the code rate of the LDPC code is below unity. For employment
in conjunction with the G3 and G4 codes, a high-rate LDPC code has to be used in order to maintain
a throughput close to 3 BPS. However, as discussed earlier, when the high-order 64-QAM scheme is
used, the achievable performance improvement of LDPC coding remains modest, regardless of the rate
of the LDPC code. Hence in this scenario the performance of the LDPC-aided G3 and G4 codes is not
considered here.
In Figure 3.15, similar to the 2 BPS throughput scenario, it is also found that the four LDPC-aided
STBC schemes can be divided into two groups. The G2 space–time code aided by the 3
4-rate LDPC code
using 16-QAM performs best in high-SNR situations and it only suffers a low performance degradation
over the scheme using no channel coding when the SNR is low.
When we increase the number of receiver antennas, the performance gap between the two groups
still remains obvious as shown in Figure 3.16. In this scenario, the best scheme is again the one
employing the half-rate LDPC-aided G2 code using 16-QAM. However, the gain achieved by the best
LDPC-STBC scheme over the best unprotected STBC scheme using two receivers decreases to about
10 dB compared with the 12.5 dB achieved, while using a single receiver.

Performance over Correlated Rayleigh Fading Channels
We have compared the performance of the LDPC-aided STBCs when communicating over uncorrelated
Rayleigh fading channels in Section 3.3.1.2.1. In this section, the performance of the STBCs will be
studied based on the same assumptions summarized on page 70, except that the channel is assumed to

be a correlated Rayleigh fading channel obeying the normalized Doppler frequency of 3.25 × 10−5.
The corresponding parameters are given in Table 3.4.
In Section 3.2.5.2 it was found that if the effective throughput is a ﬁxed constant, the performance
of the various space–time codes used for transmission over uncorrelated and correlated Rayleigh fading
channels is similar. However, in the context of the LDPC-assisted STBC-coded system, the achievable
performances are different over uncorrelated and correlated Rayleigh fading channels. This can be
clearly seen by comparing Figures 3.17, 3.18 and 3.19 of this section with Figures 3.13, 3.14 and 3.15
of Section 3.3.1.2.1, respectively. The reason for this phenomenon is that the LDPC codes perform
better over uncorrelated rather than correlated Rayleigh fading channels, unless their codeword length
is extremely high or long channel interleavers are used. This will be demonstrated during our further
discourse.
Performance at the Throughput of 1 BPS
Figure 3.17 shows the achievable performance of the
LDPC-assisted G2, G3, G4, H3 and H4 codes of Table 3.1 using one receiver at the effective throughput
of 1 BPS when communicating over correlated Rayleigh fading channels. We can see that the 2
3-rate
LDPC-coded H4 and H3 codes outperform the 2
3-rate LDPC-coded G4 and G3 codes by about 1 dB,
respectively. However, when Eb/N0 is lower than about 8 dB, we notice that the scheme employing
the unprotected G4 code, which is the best design option at the throughput of 1 BPS according to
Table 3.2, performs better than the scheme employing the 2
3-rate LDPC-aided H4 code. When the SNR
is increased to 15 dB, the situation is reversed, since the unprotected G4 scheme is outperformed by
the best LDPC-STBC scheme, namely the 2
3-rate LDPC-assisted H4 coded scheme, with about 1 dB
Eb/N0 degradation at the BER of 10−5.
Performance at the Throughput of 2 BPS
At an effective throughput of approximately 2 BPS,
the relevant schemes’ performances are given in Figure 3.18. It can be seen in the ﬁgure that the
performance of the schemes employing the H4 and H3 codes of Table 3.1 is similar to those of the
schemes employing the G4 and G3 codes, respectively, although we should bear in mind that the 3
4-rate
H4 and H3 codes have an effective throughput of 2.25 BPS, rather than exactly 2 BPS. Furthermore,

an important phenomenon found in Figure 3.18 is that the best unprotected STBC scheme of Figure 3.6
also attains the best performance in this new scenario.
This result may be explained as follows. The performance of the unprotected STBCs remains
similar over uncorrelated or correlated Rayleigh fading channels, as indicated in Section 3.2.5.2.

Figure 3.20: The BER versus Eb/N0 performance of the G2, H3 and H4 STBCs of Table 3.1 in
conjunction with the different-rate LDPC codes of Table 3.4 at an effective throughput of 3 BPS using
two receivers over correlated Rayleigh fading channels. The normalized Doppler frequency is 3.25 ×
10−5.
Furthermore, the performance of the LDPC codes degrades when communicating over correlated rather
than uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels, as seen in Figure 3.11. Hence it is not surprising that
the LDPC-STBC coded concatenated system will suffer a performance degradation in the context of
correlated Rayleigh channels. In this case, the LDPC codes’ relatively poor performance recorded over
correlated Rayleigh channels disadvantageously affects the entire system. In other words, the LDPC
codes improve the system’s performance less dramatically over correlated Rayleigh fading channels
than over uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels, unless the LDPC codeword length is very high or
long interleavers are used.
Performance at the Throughput of 3 BPS
The performance of the LDPC-assisted STBCs using
one receiver and having a throughput of 3 BPS while communicating over correlated Rayleigh fading
channel is portrayed in Figure 3.19. Similar to Figure 3.15, the schemes which employ the half-rate
space–time codes G3 and G4 of Table 3.1 are not considered in this scenario, since they are incapable
of achieving an effective throughput of 3 BPS, nor can they achieve a better performance than the
candidate schemes characterized in Figure 3.19.
As Figure 3.19 shows, the unprotected STBC H4 using 16-QAM modulation performs best, giving
an approximately 1 dB gain over the best LDPC-aided scheme, namely the STBC H4 combined with the
2
3-rate LDPC code using 64-QAM modulation at the BER of 10−5. Similar to the scenario maintaining
an effective throughput of 2 BPS, at a relatively lower Eb/N0 value, i.e. below 14.5 dB, the best STBC-
LDPC concatenated scheme is the one that employs the G2 space–time code combined with a low-order
modulation, namely the 3
4-rate LDPC-coded 16-QAM.
Furthermore, when the number of receivers is increased to two, the
3
4-rate LDPC-assisted G2
code outperforms all the other schemes considered, provided that the Eb/N0 value is below 12 dB,
as observed in Figure 3.20. At even higher Eb/N0 values, i.e. in excess of 12 dB, the 2
3-rate LDPC-
assisted H4 code exhibits the best performance, although it uses the highest-order 64-QAM modem. It
can be also observed from Figure 3.20 that the curves are signiﬁcantly closer to one another compared
with the scenario of using one receiver, which is shown in Figure 3.19.

3.3.1.3
Complexity Issues
In Section 3.3.1.2, we compared the performance of various LDPC-STBC coded concatenated systems.
The best scheme was also identiﬁed for each scenario. However, these choices have been made based
purely on the achievable performance, and the complexity issue of implementation has not been taken
into consideration. In this section, we will brieﬂy address the associated complexity issues.
As discussed in Section 3.2.3.2, the soft decoder of the STBCs employs the Log-MAP algorithm
summarized for example in [314]. With the advent of the Log-MAP algorithm, the high-complexity
exponential operations are substituted by additions and subtractions carried out in the logarithmic
domain. Hence the complexity of the STBC decoder is signiﬁcantly reduced, while closely matching
the performance of the MAP algorithm. In our following discussions, the decoding complexity of
the STBCs is considered to be sufﬁciently low for it to be ignored for the sake of simplifying our
comparisons. This will not affect our conclusions, since we will show in the rest of this section that
the LDPC-assisted G2 code, which has the lowest decoding complexity among all the STBCs of
Table 3.1, gives the best performance as seen in Figures 3.21, 3.22 and 3.23. Hence, even if the decoding
complexity of the STBCs is considered, the G2 code will still be superior to the other STBCs in the
context of the coding gain versus complexity performance.
The decoding complexity per information bit per iteration of the LDPC codes can be calculated as
follows [431]:
comp{LDPC} =
5 −R
1 −R

· j2,
(3.30)
where R is the code rate of the LDPC code and j is the column weights of the parity check matrix. In
our system the value of column weights was ﬁxed to three, thus Equation (3.30) is simpliﬁed to
comp{LDPC} =
45 −9R
1 −R

.
(3.31)
According to Equation (3.31), the decoding complexity is essentially based on the code rate of the LDPC
code employed. Thus for the rate 1/3, 1/2, 2/3 and 3/4 LDPC codes used in our system, the associated

having the same throughput. All the estimated implementational complexities were calculated based on
Equation (3.31), using different numbers of iterations ranging from 1 to 40 with a step of about 5.
At an effective throughput of 1 and 2 BPS, as seen in Figures 3.21 and 3.22, it was found that the
best scheme was the half-rate LDPC-coded G2 space–time code. In the scenario of having an effective
throughput of 3 BPS, the performance curves of the half-rate and 3
4-rate LDPC-coded G2 space–time
code are close to each other, although the former performs slightly better. We may also note that the
coding gain increases dramatically in the low-complexity range and tends to saturate in the vicinity of an
estimated complexity of about 1200, which corresponds to approximately 19, 15, 10 and 8 iterations for
the LDPC codes having a code rate of 1
3, 1
2, 2
3 and 3
4, respectively. As Figure 3.24 shows, for example,
when the number of iterations is increased to about 10 in terms of the half-rate LDPC-aided G2 code,
the performance is already close to the achievable maximum coding gain. This result can be considered
as a rule of thumb for setting the number of iterations for the LDPC-STBC coded concatenated schemes,
when aiming for a good trade-off in terms of the achievable performance-to-complexity relationships.
In Figure 3.25, we show the Eb/N0 value required for maintaining a BER of 10−5 versus the
effective throughput BPS for the unprotected STBCs and the half-rate LDPC-assisted G2 code, while
the associated simulation parameters are summarized in Tables 3.1 and 3.3. The simulation results were
obtained using one receiver for communicating over uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels. It can be
observed in Figure 3.25 that the Eb/N0 value required for maintaining a BER of 10−5 increases nearly
linearly, as the effective BPS throughput increases. This conclusion was valid for both the unprotected

LDPC-G2 concatenated scheme achieves a gain of about 15 dB over the best unprotected STBC scheme
at the effective throughput values of 1, 2 and 3 BPS, respectively.

Conclusions
Having studied Figures 3.13 to 3.19, we may arrive at the following conclusions. First of all, as expected,
the LDPC-aided STBC-coded schemes perform signiﬁcantly better than the unprotected STBC
schemes, when transmitting over uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels. However, over correlated
Rayleigh fading channels the performance improvements achieved by the LDPC codes are not as
signiﬁcant as in uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels, as seen in Figures 3.17 to 3.20. This is because
the LDPC codes suffer from their ﬁnite codeword length and for a limited tolerable channel interleaver
delay, as evidenced by Figure 3.11. This affects the attainable performance of the LDPC-STBC coded
concatenated system to some degree. If we use an extremely long codeword or employ a long channel
interleaver, however, the achievable performance of the LDPC-STBC concatenated schemes can be
improved in the context of correlated Rayleigh fading channels.
Another observation inferred from Figures 3.13 to 3.19 is that when the number of receiver antennas
is increased, most of the attainable diversity gain has already been achieved by the LDPC-G2 coded
concatenated schemes. Hence, the employment of an STBC using more transmitter antennas will
introduce a higher-throughput modulation mode, which in turn will require an increased Eb/N0 value
and hence degrades the achievable performance.
Furthermore, in the context of uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels and using a speciﬁc
modulation scheme, the LDPC-STBC coded system’s performance is mainly decided by the code
rate and error-correction capability of the LDPC code employed, instead of the space–time codes’
diversity order. In this case, using a lower-rate LDPC code will achieve a more substantial performance
improvement than increasing the number of transmitters and the associated diversity gain. On the other
hand, if the same LDPC code is employed, the throughput of the modulation scheme has more inﬂuence
on the system’s performance than the diversity order. In other words, the beneﬁts brought about by the
employment of low-throughput modulation schemes will be more substantial than that offered by a high-
order STBC, provided that both schemes are assisted by the same LDPC code. The reason behind this
phenomenon is that, when the higher-order STBC codes are used in conjunction with a high number
of antennas, more vulnerable high-throughput modulation schemes have to be used, for the sake of
maintaining the same effective throughput. Therefore the employment of the latter scenario would
result in performance degradations. In summary, the best candidate schemes are the ones using the
LDPC-aided G2 code when communicating over uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels. When using
the same STBC, the complexity of the STBC code can be ignored during the comparisons.
Another useful conclusion can be drawn from Figure 3.24. As seen in the ﬁgure, the coding gains
of the LDPC-aided schemes tend to remain unimproved, even if the affordable complexity increases
to a certain degree, although the validity of this statement depends on the speciﬁc choice of the LDPC
code used. This result assists us in deciding on the appropriate number of iterations to be used by the
LDPC-STBC concatenated schemes, so that the best possible achievable performance-to-complexity
trade-off can be achieved.
Before concluding this section, we summarize the achievable performance of the different schemes
used in our various candidate systems communicating over uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels
in Table 3.5. For the scenarios having an effective throughput of 1, 2 and 3 BPS, respectively, the
corresponding bold numbers denote the best scheme based on the criterion of achieving the best coding
gain versus complexity trade-off, as seen in Figures 3.21, 3.22 and 3.23. As a result, the half-rate LDPC-
coded STBC G2 was found to be the best scheme in the scenarios having an effective throughput of 1
and 2 BPS, while the 3
4-rate LDPC-coded G2 code performs best in the scenario having an effective
throughput of 3 BPS.

LDPC-Aided and TC-Aided STBCs
In Section 3.3.1, we studied the performance of various LDPC-aided STBC systems. It was found that
the LDPC codes considerably improve the STBC system’s performance over uncorrelated Rayleigh
fading channels. However, besides LDPC channel codes, the STBCs can also be concatenated with

codes [420, 421], Turbo Bose–Chaudhuri–Hocquenghem (TBCH) codes (a class of FEC codes) [432],
etc. The performance of these various channel-coded G2 schemes designed for transmission over
uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels has been studied in [314], where the best scheme found was
the half-rate TC(2,1,4) code in conjunction with the STBC G2. Hence, in this section, we will compare
the performance of the best LDPC-STBC coded concatenated scheme found in Section 3.3.1.2, namely
that of the half-rate LDPC-aided G2 code, with the half-rate TC(2,1,4)-aided STBC schemes.
3.3.2.1
System Overview
In 1993, Berrou et al. [420,421] proposed a novel channel code, referred to as a turbo code. As detailed
in [314], the turbo encoder consists of two component encoders. Generally, convolutional codes are
used as the component encoders and the corresponding turbo codes are termed here TC codes. For a
TC(n, k, K) code, the three parameters n, k and K have the same meaning as in a convolutional code
CC(n, k, K), where k is the number of input bits, n is the number of coded bits and K is the constraint
length of the code. More details about TC codes can be found in [314]. A schematic of our experimental
system, where the half-rate TC(2,1,4) code is employed, is given in Figure 3.26.
The source bits are ﬁrst encoded by the half-rate TC(2,1,4) encoder. The Log-MAP decoding
algorithm [314] is utilized for iterative turbo decoding, since it operates in the logarithmic domain
and thus signiﬁcantly reduces the computational complexity imposed by the MAP algorithm [425].
The number of turbo iterations is set to eight, since this yields a performance close to the achievable
performance associated with an inﬁnite number of iterations. The TC-encoded bits will be interleaved
by the channel interleaver, as seen in Figure 3.26. In this case, a random interleaver having a depth of
about 20 000 is used. The interleaved bits will then be forwarded to the mapper, followed by the STBC
encoder. At the receiver side, the corresponding inverse operations are invoked, as seen in Figure 3.26.
The simulation parameters of the TC-STBC coded concatenated system are given in Table 3.6.
3.3.2.2
Complexity Issues
For the sake of fair comparisons, we should calculate and take into account the complexity of the LDPC
and TC(2,1,4) codes. The total estimated complexity of the TC codes per information bit per iteration
in terms of additions and subtractions to be carried out is [433]
comp{TC(n, 1, K)} = 40(2K−1) + 12n −22.
(3.32)
According to Equation (3.32), the complexity of the TC(2,1,4) code is 322 per information bit per
iteration. Since the number of iterations has been set to eight, the total complexity of the TC(2,1,4)
code per bit is 322 × 8 = 2576 in the context of additions and subtractions, as shown in Table 3.6.
On the other hand, the complexity of the LDPC codes per information bit per iteration can be
calculated according to Equation (3.31). Therefore, we can multiply the result of Equation (3.31) by
the appropriately selected number of iterations required by the different-rate LDPC codes, so that a

similar complexity per bit is used for both the LDPC codes and the TC(2,1,4) code. For the half-rate
LDPC-coded G2 scheme, the number of iterations was set to 32 so that the total complexity becomes
81 × 32 = 2592, which is close to the estimated complexity of 2576 encountered by the TC(2,1,4)
scheme. The parameters of the LDPC-G2 coded concatenated scheme used in this new scenario are
given in Table 3.7.
3.3.2.3
Simulation Results
In this section, the performance of the LDPC- and TC-aided STBC schemes communicating over
uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels will be studied and compared. The parameters of the STBCs,
the half-rate TC(2,1,4) code and the LDPC codes are given in Tables 3.1, 3.6 and 3.7, respectively. The
simulation results are based on the same assumptions which were outlined in Section 3.2.4 on page 70.
Figure 3.27 compares the performance of the candidate schemes using the parameters summarized
in Tables 3.6 and 3.7 operating at an effective throughput of 1 BPS over uncorrelated Rayleigh fading
channels. For the half-rate TC(2,1,4)-coded scheme combined with the half-rate G3 and G4 codes,
the 16-QAM modem is used for maintaining a throughput of 1 BPS. As seen in Figure 3.27, the
TC(2,1,4)-aided G2 code outperforms the others. However, at the BER of 10−5, it only provides
an approximately 0.1 dB gain over the LDPC-aided G2 code, which is the best LDPC-STBC coded
concatenated scheme according to Table 3.5. It is also observed that the schemes in which the G3
and G4 codes are employed exhibit an inferior performance in comparison with their G2-code-based
counterpart as well as in comparison with the LDPC-aided scheme, because the more densely packed
16-QAM phasor constellation is used.

throughput of 1 BPS using one receiver over uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels.
Figure 3.28 compares the performance of the candidate schemes using the parameters summarized
in Tables 3.6 and 3.7 operating at an effective throughput of 2 and 3 BPS over uncorrelated Rayleigh
fading channels. As suggested by Figure 3.28, the TC(2,1,4)-aided schemes perform slightly better than
the LDPC-aided schemes, providing an approximately 0.1 dB and 0.4 dB gain at the BER of 10−5 in
the scenarios of having a throughput of 2 and 3 BPS, respectively.
In Figure 3.29 the achievable coding gain versus complexity is characterized. The coding gains were
recorded at the BER of 10−5, as presented in Section 3.3.1.3. From Figure 3.29, we infer that the curves
associated with the TC(2,1,4) code are close to those of the LDPC codes, although the former ones
perform slightly better than the latter ones in the context of having the same effective throughput of 1,
2 and 3 BPS, respectively. However, in the low-complexity range, i.e. in the complexity range spanning
from 0 to 600, the LDPC codes perform better than the TC(2,1,4) code. On the one hand, the achievable
lowest complexity of the half-rate TC(2,1,4) code is 322, which is attained when the number of iterations
is set to one, while the LDPC codes are capable of providing an even lower complexity down to 81,
again, as seen in Figure 3.29. On the other hand, for the LDPC schemes, the achievable coding gain
dramatically increases, when the affordable complexity is increased within the range spanning from 0 to
about 600. Therefore, the employment of the LDPC-aided schemes may be more attractive in scenarios
where the affordable complexity is the most important concern, while the system’s performance does
not necessarily have to be the best.

Conclusions
In Section 3.3.2.3 we presented a range of performance comparisons in the context of the attainable
coding gain versus complexity for the various TC(2,1,4)-STBC and LDPC-STBC coded concatenated
schemes for transmission over uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels. As a conclusion, the TC(2,1,4)-
assisted STBC G2 outperforms its LDPC-assisted counterparts for all the three scenarios having
different effective throughputs. However, it was found that the associated performance difference
is insigniﬁcant, i.e. less than 0.3 dB. Furthermore, the LDPC-STBC coded concatenated schemes

Channel Coding Aided STBC-OFDM
In Section 3.3, we investigated various LDPC channel coding assisted STBC schemes communicating
over narrowband fading channels, followed by the performance study of LDPC-aided and TC-aided
STBC schemes. Naturally, a range of channel codes can also be combined with the family of STBCs
for the sake of improving the system’s performance. In this section, various Coded Modulation
(CM) [314] assisted STBC schemes will be studied for transmission over multi-path Rayleigh fading
channels. Speciﬁcally, Trellis-Coded Modulation (TCM) [314, 434], Turbo Trellis-Coded Modulation
(TTCM) [314,435], Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation (BICM) [314,436] and iterative joint decoding
and demodulation assisted BICM (BICM-ID) [314, 437] will be investigated. Furthermore, the above
CM-assisted STBC-aided schemes will be studied in the context of a single-user OFDM [1–4] system.
As a well-established technique, OFDM has exhibited a number of advantages over more traditional
multiplexing techniques, and has been adopted for both Digital Audio and Video Broadcasting (DAB
and DVB) in Europe. It has also been selected as the IEEE 802.11 standards for Wireless Local Area
Networks (WLANs). Let us now embark on the investigation of the CM-assisted STBC single-user
OFDM system.
3.4.1
CM-Assisted STBCs
Since the signal bandwidth available for wireless communications is limited, one of the most important
objectives in the design of digital mobile systems is to make the most of the attainable bandwidth, e.g.
with the aid of the CM schemes.

96
Chapter 3. Channel Coding Assisted STBC-OFDM Systems
3.4.1.1
CM Principles
The basic principle of CM [314] is that we attach a parity bit to each uncoded information symbol
formed by m information bits according to the speciﬁc modulation scheme used, hence doubling the
number of constellation points to 2m+1 compared with that of 2m in the original modem constellation.
This is achieved by extending the modulation constellation, rather than expanding the required
bandwidth, while maintaining the same effective throughput of m bits per symbol, as in the case of
no channel coding. In other words, the signalling rate remains the same, since the redundant parity bit
can be absorbed by the expansion of the constellation. Therefore, when the achievable coding gain of the
CM scheme becomes higher than the Eb/N0 degradation imposed by the more vulnerable higher-order
modulation scheme employed, a useful effective coding gain can be achieved.
Among the various CM schemes, TCM [434] was originally designed for transmission over
Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channels. TTCM [435] is a more recent joint coding and
modulation scheme which has a structure similar to that of the family of binary turbo codes, but employs
TCM schemes as component codes. Both TCM and TTCM employ set-partitioning-based constellation
mapping [314], while using symbol-based turbo interleavers and channel interleavers. Another CM
scheme, referred to as BICM [436], invokes bit-based channel interleavers in conjunction with grey
constellation mapping. Furthermore, iteratively decoded BICM [437] using set partitioning was also
proposed. More details about the various CM schemes used can be found in [314]. In this section,
we will mostly focus on the performance of the proposed CM-assisted STBC-coded OFDM schemes
communicating over wideband Rayleigh fading channels.
3.4.1.2
Inter-symbol Interference and OFDM Basics
If the modulation bandwidth exceeds the coherence bandwidth of the channel, Inter-Symbol Interfer-
ence (ISI) will be introduced and the consecutive transmitted symbols are distorted, since the past and
current symbols of the signals overlap. Hence, at the receiver, channel equalizers have to be employed
to remove the effects of ISI [314].
An alternative way of mitigating the effects of ISI is to employ OFDM, which effectively mitigates
the detrimental effects of the frequency-selective fading, when transmitting over high-rate wideband
channels. The basic principle of OFDM is to split a high-rate data stream into a number of low-rate
streams which are transmitted simultaneously over a number of subcarriers. Hence the symbol duration
is rendered longer for each of the parallel subcarriers, and thus the relative effects imposed by the multi-
path channel’s delay spread are reduced. In other words, since the system’s data throughput is the sum
of all the parallel subchannels’ throughputs, the data rate per subchannel is only a small fraction of
the total data rate of a conventional single-carrier system having the same throughput. This results in
the phenomenon where the symbol duration becomes signiﬁcantly longer than the channel’s impulse
response, thus it has the potential to disperse with channel equalization. Speciﬁcally, if an appropriate-
duration cyclic OFDM symbol extension is selected, the ISI between consecutive OFDM symbols can
be almost completely eliminated. Furthermore, for a given delay spread, the implementation complexity
of an OFDM modem may be signiﬁcantly lower than that of a single-carrier system employing an
equalizer [4].
The schematic of an OFDM modem is shown in Figure 3.30. The source bit stream is ﬁrst encoded
by an STBC or channel encoder and forwarded to the interleaver and the mapper, where the bits are
interleaved and may be mapped to non-binary symbols. Some pilot subcarriers may be inserted to
assist in the estimation of the channel’s frequency-domain transfer function, which is required for the
receiver to counteract the effects of the channel’s frequency-domain fading. The serial data stream is
then converted into a parallel symbol sequence and forwarded to the Inverse Fast Fourier Transform
(IFFT) modulator to form the time-domain modulated signal. Again, in order to eliminate the ISI
between consecutive OFDM symbols, a cyclic extension has to be added to each OFDM symbol.
Then the Digital-to-Analogue Converter (DAC) converts the cyclically extended OFDM signal to the
analogue domain, which is ﬁnally ﬁltered by a Low-Pass Filter (LPF) and transmitted through the

wideband channel. At the receiver side, the Analogue-to-Digital Converter (ADC) converts the LPF-
ﬁltered received signal to the digital domain, where symbol timing and frequency synchronization are
the ﬁrst processing steps [4]. Then the cyclic extension attached to each OFDM symbol is removed
and the recovered signal is forwarded to the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) demodulator, whose output
will be processed by the pilot-based frequency-domain channel equalizer in order to compensate the
frequency-domain fading imposed by the channel. After symbol demapping and deinterleaving, the
received signal is ﬁnally passed to the space–time or channel decoder, which outputs the decoded
information bits.
3.4.1.3
System Overview
Figure 3.31 shows a schematic of the CM-assisted STBC-OFDM system investigated [3, 314]. As
observed in Figure 3.31, the source information bits are ﬁrst encoded and modulated by the CM
encoder followed by the space–time encoder. In our schemes, the STBC employed was the G2 code of
Table 3.1, which invokes two transmitter antennas, and the two space–time-coded samples are mapped
to two consecutive OFDM subcarriers and OFDM modulated. Then the frequency-domain symbols
are converted to time-domain OFDM symbols by the IFFT-based modulator and the cyclic extension is
appended to each individual OFDM symbol. The OFDM symbols are then transmitted via the multi-path
fading channel, and the received noise-contaminated symbols are forwarded to the OFDM demodulator,
where the FFT operation will be employed for converting the channel-impaired time-domain symbols
to their frequency-domain counterparts. The recovered signal is then space–time soft decoded and the
soft outputs are fed to the CM decoder for recovering the most likely transmitted information bits.

3.4.1.3.1
Complexity Issues
In order to compare the different candidate schemes under fair conditions, we chose the system
parameters so that the decoding complexity of the various CM schemes employed became similar.
The complexity imposed by the STBC codec was neglected, since the same G2 STBC was used for all
the CM-STBC concatenated schemes.
The symbol-based Log-MAP decoder [314] is utilized in all the CM schemes considered in our
system, i.e. in the TCM, TTCM, BICM and BICM-ID codecs, to reduce the computational complexity
imposed by the MAP algorithm [314]. Therefore, the multiplication and addition operations are
substituted by additions and by the Jacobian sum operations [425] carried out in the logarithmic domain,
respectively. As a result, in terms of the number of additions and subtractions, the total decoding
complexity per bit per iteration for the TTCM scheme studied is as follows [431]:
comp{TTCM } = 10M(2ν+1 −1)
m
,
(3.33)
where m is the number of information bits in a coded information symbol, M = 2m is the number of
legitimate symbols in the mapping constellation set, and ν is the code memory. For example, for the
QPSK-based TTCM scheme having a code memory of ν = 3, the associated complexity per bit per
iteration is 10 · 21 · (23+1 −1)/1 = 300, since in this case m is equal to 1. If the number of iterations is
4, the total decoding complexity per bit becomes 300·4 = 1200, as seen in Table 3.9. For the remaining
CM schemes used, namely for TCM/BICM/BICM-ID, the corresponding decoding complexity per bit
per iteration is
comp{TCM /BICM /BICM-ID} = 5M(2ν+1 −1)
m
,
(3.34)
which is half the complexity of that in Equation (3.33). The reason for this is that the TTCM scheme
utilizes two Log-MAP decoders, while TCM/BICM/BICM-ID schemes only use one [314], hence
the associated complexity of TTCM is doubled. The parameters used by the various CM-STBC
concatenated schemes investigated are provided in Table 3.9. From the table, we can see that the total
decoding complexity per bit – rather than per bit per iteration - of the four CM schemes is similar.
3.4.1.3.2
Channel Model
As mentioned earlier, we will investigate the proposed system when communicating over dispersive
wideband Rayleigh fading channels. Speciﬁcally, we consider the Short Wireless Asynchronous
Transfer Mode (SWATM) Channel Impulse Response (CIR) given on page 78 of [3], although the
Doppler frequency may assume a range of different values. The three-tap SWATM channel is a truncated
version of the ﬁve-tap Wireless Asynchronous Transfer Mode (WATM) CIR, retaining only the ﬁrst
three impulses [3]. This reduces the total length of the impulse response, where the last path arrives
with a delay of 48.9 ns, which corresponds to 11 sample periods. For our simulations each of the
three paths experiences independent Rayleigh fading having the normalized Doppler frequency of
f ′
d = 1.235 × 10−5. Figure 3.32 displays the impulse response of the SWATM channel, while the
associated parameters are given in Table 3.10.
For the sake of combating the effects of ISI when communicating over the multi-path Rayleigh
fading channel, as discussed in Section 3.4.1, we employ an OFDM modem having 512 subcarriers,
while each OFDM symbol is extended by a cyclic preﬁx of 512/8 = 64 time-domain samples [3].
Therefore, the length of an OFDM symbol becomes 512 + 64 = 576 samples. Since the number of
subcarriers is sufﬁciently high, we may assume that each OFDM subcarrier experiences narrowband
channel conditions in the frequency domain.
3.4.1.3.3
Assumptions
When the STBCs were employed for transmissions over uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels, as
mentioned in Section 3.2.4, we assumed that the channel was quasi-static so that its path gains remained

the n = 2 rows of the G2 code’s transmission matrix. However, in this new context we can no longer
assume that the corresponding frequency-domain subcarrier gains remain identical as a consequence
of the wideband channel’s frequency-domain fading proﬁle, an issue which will be further discussed
in Section 3.4.1.4. This results in a residual error ﬂoor for the unprotected G2 STBC scheme, as seen

for example in Figure 3.35 below. For the concatenated CM-STBC schemes, however, the error ﬂoor
experienced may be signiﬁcantly reduced to a neglectable level.
In Section 3.4.1.4, the performance of the proposed CM-assisted STBC OFDM schemes will be
compared. All our simulation results were based on the following assumptions:
• Each path of the multi-path channel employed experiences independent Rayleigh fading.
• The average signal power received from each transmitter antenna is the same.
• The receiver has perfect knowledge of the channels’ fading amplitudes.
These assumptions simplify the simulations to a degree, therefore the system concerned is not a
realistic one. However, again, since the experimental circumstances are identical for all performance
comparisons, the results may be expected to characterize adequately the relative performance of the
various schemes used.
3.4.1.4
Simulation Results
In this section, the performance of the CM-assisted STBC-OFDM system considered will be studied.
The simulation parameters have been given in Table 3.9. All schemes utilized two transmitter antennas
for the G2 STBC and one receiver antenna. Each OFDM symbol has 512 subcarriers and a cyclic
extension of 64 samples.
Performance at an effective throughput of 1 BPS
Figure 3.33 shows the performance of the various
CM-assisted G2 STBC-OFDM schemes communicating over the SWATM channel. In our system, we
employ grey-coding-based constellation mapping for the BICM scheme, while using set-partitioning-
based constellation mapping for the TCM, TTCM and BICM-ID arrangements [314]. To achieve an
effective throughput of 1 BPS, QPSK modulation is used for all the half-rate CM-assisted schemes.
As seen in Figure 3.33, the CM-G2 coded concatenated schemes perform signiﬁcantly better than the
unprotected G2 scheme, achieving an Eb/N0 gain of about 14 dB at the BER of 10−5. Among all the
CM-assisted schemes, the TTCM-aided arrangement gives the best performance by achieving about 0.5
to 1 dB gain over the other CM-assisted schemes at the BER of 10−5.
Performance at an effective throughput of 2 BPS
The performance comparison of the different
CM-STBC concatenated schemes having an effective throughput of 2 BPS for transmissions over
the SWATM channel is shown in Figure 3.34. It can be seen in Figure 3.34 that when the Eb/N0
value encountered is relatively low, i.e. below about 7.5 dB, the unprotected G2 scheme performs
better than the CM-assisted G2 schemes. However, when the Eb/N0 value experienced is higher than
approximately 7.5 dB, the TTCM-aided G2 scheme outperforms all the other candidates, achieving
a gain of about 1.3 and 12.5 dB over the other CM-aided G2 schemes and over the unprotected G2
scheme, respectively, at the BER of 10−5.
Performance at an effective throughput of 3 BPS
If we increase the system’s effective throughput to
3 BPS, a residual BER of approximate 6×10−5 is observed for the performance curve of the unprotected
G2 scheme, as seen in Figure 3.35. This phenomenon can be explained as follows. In the context of
the single-path uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels mentioned in Section 3.2.4, we assumed that

transfer functions. More speciﬁcally, the fading amplitudes vary more rapidly when the delay spread
is increased [314]. Since the maximum delay spread of the SWATM channel is as high as τmax =
48.9 ns, the variation of the frequency-domain fading amplitudes is so dramatic that we can no longer
assume that the path gains remain constant during two consecutive STBC time slots. In this case, for
the unprotected STBC schemes, the rapid variation of the channel’s frequency-domain fading envelope
will seriously erode the orthogonality of the G2 STBC’s two components, resulting in a residual error
ﬂoor, as seen for example in Figure 3.35.
Furthermore, if a higher-order modulation scheme such as 16-QAM is employed, as shown in
Figure 3.35, since the signal is mapped to more densely packed constellation phasors which are prone
to transmission errors, the error ﬂoor imposed by the channel is expected to be higher than that in the
scenarios, where a lower-order modulation scheme, such as QPSK or 8-PSK is used, as exhibited by
Figures 3.33 and 3.34. More explicitly, comparing Figures 3.33 and 3.34 with Figure 3.35, we can see
that the BER error ﬂoors observed in Figures 3.33 and 3.34 are below 10−5, while in Figure 3.35 the
error ﬂoor encountered is about 6 × 10−5.
With the advent of employing the CM schemes, however, the error ﬂoor can be eliminated or
reduced to a signiﬁcantly lower level. As Figure 3.35 shows, the CM schemes signiﬁcantly improve the
STBC-OFDM system’s performance and the BER error ﬂoor exhibited by the unprotected G2 scheme
has been essentially eliminated. Similar to the scenarios of having an effective throughput of 1 and
2 BPS, the TTCM-G2 concatenated scheme was found to give the best performance among all the CM-
assisted schemes studied, although the Eb/N0 gain achieved over the other candidate schemes is not
signiﬁcant.

Conclusions
In the previous sections we investigated the achievable performance of the various CM-assisted STBC-
OFDM schemes for transmissions over the SWATM channel. We ﬁrst brieﬂy reviewed the basic
principles of the CM schemes in Section 3.4.1.1. In Section 3.4.1.2 a rudimentary introduction to
OFDM was provided, which was followed by the overview of the simulation arrangement, as detailed

in Section 3.4.1.3. Our performance analysis was presented in Section 3.4.1.4, where the CM-assisted
STBC schemes were found to improve signiﬁcantly the system’s achievable performance, eliminating
the BER ﬂoor of the unprotected STBC scheme. Furthermore, the TTCM-STBC concatenated scheme
was observed to give the best performance among all the CM-STBC concatenated schemes.
In conclusion, we summarized the performance of the evaluated CM-STBC concatenated schemes
in Table 3.11. The coding gains summarized in Table 3.11 were deﬁned as the Eb/N0 difference,
expressed in terms of decibels, at a BER of 10−5 between the various channel coding assisted
STBC-OFDM systems and the uncoded single-transmitter OFDM system having the same effective
throughput. All the results were recorded by using one receiver, while communicating over the SWATM
channel of Section 3.4.1.3.2.
3.4.2
CM-Aided and LDPC-Aided STBC-OFDM Schemes
In Section 3.4.1, we studied the performance of different CM-assisted STBC schemes for transmissions
over the SWATM channel [3] of Figure 3.32. Instead of the joint coding modulation schemes of
Table 3.9, separate channel codes such as LDPC codes [419] can also be incorporated into our STBC-
OFDM system to improve the achievable performance. Hence, in this section we will compare the
CM-assisted G2 STBC schemes of Section 3.4.1 with those in which the LDPC codes are combined
with the STBC G2.

System Overview
The LDPC-assisted STBC-OFDM system’s schematic is given in Figure 3.36. Compared with
Figure 3.31, where the CM-assisted STBC-OFDM system was introduced, we substituted the CM
encoder and decoder by an LDPC encoder and decoder, respectively. For the CM schemes, the
associated symbol-based channel interleaver and deinterleaver have been integrated in the CM encoder
and decoder, respectively. For the LDPC schemes, however, an external bit-based channel interleaver
and deinterleaver have to be employed for the sake of further improving the system’s performance, as
seen in Figure 3.36.
Utilizing Equations (3.31), (3.33), and (3.34), we can calculate the corresponding decoding
complexity per bit per iteration for the LDPC and CM schemes, respectively. For the sake of fair
comparisons, we have to select the appropriate parameters so that the CM-STBC schemes and the
LDPC-STBC schemes exhibit a similar decoding complexity. Speciﬁcally, similar to Section 3.4.1.3,
the STBC was also chosen to be the G2 code in all the LDPC-STBC concatenated OFDM schemes
investigated, and thus, again, the related decoding complexity of the G2 code was neglected in order
to simplify the comparisons. Furthermore, the symbol-based codeword length of the LDPC-STBC
concatenated schemes was ﬁxed to 1024, which is equal to that of the CM-STBC concatenated schemes.
Speciﬁcally, the same channel model, namely the SWATM channel of Section 3.4.1.3, and the same
OFDM modem having 512 subcarriers and a cyclic preﬁx of 64 samples were employed in this new
context.
As mentioned in Section 3.4.1.4, at a speciﬁc effective throughput, it was found that the TTCM-
assisted G2-coded scheme gave the best performance. Hence we used the TTCM scheme as the
representative of the CM family, while half-rate and 3
4-rate LDPC codes were chosen for representing
the LDPC code family. As a summary, the parameters of the various CM-STBC concatenated OFDM
systems are given in Table 3.9, while the parameters of the LDPC-STBC concatenated OFDM systems
are provided in Table 3.12.

3.4.2.2
Simulation Results
In this section we compare the TTCM- and LDPC-assisted STBC-OFDM schemes, which are
characterized in Figure 3.37. All schemes utilized two transmitter antennas for the G2 STBC and
one receiver antenna. All simulation results were generated based on the assumptions outlined in
Section 3.4.1.3.
As seen from Figure 3.37, the TTCM- and LDPC-assisted G2-coded OFDM schemes have a similar
performance. Speciﬁcally, when the effective throughput is 1 BPS, the TTCM-assisted scheme performs
slightly better than the LDPC-aided candidate system. In the scenario of an effective throughput
of 2 BPS, the former outperforms the latter again. In this context, however, we may see that the
performance gap between the two competing schemes is larger than that in the scenario of a throughput
of 1 BPS. This is because, in order to achieve the same effective throughput of 2 BPS, the TTCM-
aided scheme employs 8-PSK modulation in conjunction with set partitioning, while the LDPC-aided
candidate has to employ the more vulnerable 16-QAM grey-mapping-based constellation, since the
code rate of the TTCM and the LDPC code are
2
3 and 1
2, respectively. Nonetheless, it is found in
Figure 3.37 that the two corresponding competitors exhibit a similar performance when the throughput
is increased to 3 BPS. In this case, however, the LDPC-aided scheme is marginally superior to the
TTCM-aided scheme when the Eb/N0 value is relatively low, i.e. below 11 dB.
In Figure 3.38, the associated coding gain versus complexity results are provided. The coding gain
was deﬁned in Section 3.4.1.5, while the complexity of the CM schemes and LDPC codes can be
calculated with the aid of Equations (3.33) and (3.31), respectively. Given the same effective throughput,
it is found that the coding gain performance of the TTCM-aided G2 schemes surpasses that of the
LDPC-aided G2 schemes when the affordable complexity is higher than approximately 500, as observed
in Figure 3.38. At a low complexity, i.e. below a value of about 500, however, the LDPC-aided schemes
tend to achieve a higher coding gain than the TTCM-aided schemes at the speciﬁc throughput values
considered.

Conclusions
In Section 3.4.2.2 the performance of the different TTCM- and LDPC-assisted G2 coded OFDM
schemes was studied and compared. As seen from Figure 3.37, the TTCM-assisted G2 scheme gives a
better performance than the LDPC-assisted G2 scheme. Furthermore, in the context of the achievable
coding gain versus complexity performance, it was found that the TTCM-assisted schemes are capable
of achieving higher coding gains in the relatively high-complexity range, than the LDPC-assisted
candidate schemes.
In conclusion, we summarize the achievable performance of the various schemes discussed in
Table 3.13.

Chapter Summary
The state of the art of various transmission schemes based on multiple transmitters and receivers
was brieﬂy reviewed in Section 3.1. A simple communication system invoking the STBC G2 was
introduced in Section 3.2.1, leading to further discussions on various other STBCs. More speciﬁcally,
Section 3.2.2.1 deﬁned the STBC transmission matrix, while the encoding algorithm of the G2 and a
range of other STBCs was given in Sections 3.2.2.2 and 3.2.2.3, respectively. Section 3.2.3 presented
the decoding algorithm of the STBCs considered. More speciﬁcally, Section 3.2.3.1 introduced the ML
algorithm, while Section 3.2.3.2 discussed the MAP algorithm, which enables the STBC decoder to
provide soft outputs. Thus various channel codes can be concatenated with the STBCs to improve the
system’s performance. In Section 3.2.4, a schematic of the proposed system was presented, and some
assumptions used in our simulations were outlined.
The performances of the various STBCs were studied and compared in Section 3.2.5. Speciﬁcally,
in Sections 3.2.5.1 and 3.2.5.2 the performances of different STBC schemes communicating over both
uncorrelated and correlated Rayleigh fading channels were compared, respectively. It was found that
the performances of the half-rate codes G3 and G4 degraded in comparison with that of the unity-

rate code G2, when the effective throughput was increased. The reason is that in order to maintain the
same effective throughput, higher-throughput modulation schemes have to be employed in conjunction
with the half-rate codes G3 and G4, which are more vulnerable to errors. This therefore degrades the
performance of the system. The 3
4-rate codes H3 and H4 suffer a lower degradation in this case, as
their code rate is higher than that of the G3 and G4 codes, therefore a moderate-throughput modulation
scheme can be employed. This in turn assists in maintaining the performance advantage achieved by the
space–time codes. Additionally, when the number of receivers is increased, the achievable performance
gain of the G3, G4, H3 and H4 codes over the G2 code becomes lower, as seen in Figures 3.4, 3.5,
3.8 and 3.9. This is because much of the attainable diversity gain has already been achieved using
the G2 code employing two receivers. Another important conclusion is that the performances of the
space–time codes communicating over both uncorrelated and correlated Rayleigh fading channels are
the same, provided that the effective throughput is the same. The performances of all the STBCs were
summarized in Table 3.2 at the end of Section 3.2.6.
The schemes employing STBCs in conjunction with channel codes were studied in Section 3.3,
which were divided into two parts: the performance study of LDPC-aided STBCs was presented in
Section 3.3.1, while our performance comparisons between LDPC-assisted and TC(2,1,4)-aided STBC
schemes were provided in Section 3.3.2.
In Section 3.3.1.1 the LDPC-based system was introduced and the associated simulation param-
eters were given. The performances of the LDPC-STBC concatenated schemes were provided in
Section 3.3.1.2, including the scenarios of both uncorrelated and correlated Rayleigh fading channels
in Section 3.3.1.2.1 and Section 3.3.1.2.2, respectively. The implementation complexity issues of the
schemes studied were discussed in Section 3.3.1.3, where the coding gain versus complexity at different
effective throughputs was shown in Figures 3.21, 3.22 and 3.23. It was found that the LDPC-aided
STBC schemes performed signiﬁcantly better than the STBC-only schemes when communicating
over uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels, while the achievable performance improvement was
insigniﬁcant when communicating over correlated Rayleigh fading channels. This is because the
attainable performances of the LDPC codes were found to be worse when communicating over

108
Chapter 3. Channel Coding Assisted STBC-OFDM Systems
correlated Rayleigh channels than over uncorrelated Rayleigh channels, unless the LDPC codeword
length was sufﬁciently long or a sufﬁciently long channel interleaver was used. The phenomenon
of achieving different performances over uncorrelated and correlated Rayleigh fading channels was
also observed in the context of the LDPC-STBC concatenated system. On the other hand, when the
number of receiver antennas was increased, the schemes employing an STBC of a higher-diversity
order were found to provide an inferior performance, since most of the attainable diversity gain has
already been achieved by the LDPC-aided G2-coded scheme. It was also found that for transmission
over the uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels, when the same modulation scheme was used, a lower-
rate LDPC code beneﬁted the system more than a space–time code of a higher-diversity order did.
Furthermore, when the same LDPC code was used, a lower-order modulation scheme tended to offer
a higher performance improvement than an STBC of a higher-diversity order did. The performance of
different LDPC-aided STBC schemes was summarized in Table 3.5, where the half-rate LDPC-coded
STBC G2 was found to be the best option among all the LDPC-STBC concatenated schemes.
Following Section 3.3.1, where the LDPC-aided space–time-coded system was studied, our
comparative study between LDPC-aided and TC(2,1,4)-assisted STBC schemes transmitting over
uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels was presented in Section 3.3.2. The TC(2,1,4)-aided system was
introduced in Section 3.3.2.1, while the associated complexity issues were discussed in Section 3.3.2.2,
which was followed by the performance analysis in Section 3.3.2.3. From our coding gain versus
complexity performance comparisons, it was concluded that the half-rate TC(2,1,4)-assisted STBC
G2 slightly outperforms the LDPC-assisted STBC schemes. However, the LDPC-STBC concatenated
schemes may be considered as better design options for complexity-sensitive systems, where the
achievable performance does not necessarily have to be the highest possible, since the LDPC-aided
schemes are capable of maintaining a lower complexity than the TC(2,1,4)-aided scheme is. In
conclusion, the performance of the different schemes studied was summarized in Table 3.8.
Furthermore, channel coding assisted STBC single-user OFDM systems were studied in Sec-
tion 3.4. This research was divided into two parts. The ﬁrst part was the investigation of the various
CM-assisted STBC-OFDM schemes detailed in Section 3.4.1. The basic OFDM system was introduced
in Section 3.4.1.2, followed by the whole system’s overview in Section 3.4.1.3. More speciﬁcally, a brief
complexity analysis was provided in Section 3.4.1.3.1, and the introduction of the SWATM channel
model was the subject of Section 3.4.1.3.2. Our simulation results were discussed in Section 3.4.1.4
and summarized in Table 3.11. The latter part of Section 3.4 focused on the performance comparison
of the CM- and LDPC-assisted STBC systems considered, which was detailed in Section 3.4.2. The
BER versus Eb/N0 as well as the coding gain versus complexity performances of the two groups of
candidate schemes were compared in Section 3.4.2.2, followed by our conclusions in Section 3.4.2.3,
where the results were summarized in Table 3.13.
The family of STBCs is readily applicable to employment in downlink systems, where the multiple
transmitter antennas are installed at the BS. However, in the context of uplink systems it is impractical
to use high-order STBCs at the MSs, since the MSs are expected to have a low implementation
complexity and thus cannot afford the added cost of a high number of transmitter antennas. In the
next chapter, Space-Division Multiple Access (SDMA) types of uplink multi-user OFDM systems will
be investigated, which invoke multiple receiver antenna elements for supporting a multiplicity of MSs,
each of which employs a single transmitter antenna only.

Introduction
In recent years Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) [1, 3, 4, 24] has emerged as
a successful air-interface technology for both broadcast and Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)
applications, while Wideband Code-Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) has emerged as the winning
candidate for 3G mobile systems. Our research therefore includes exploration of the performance
versus complexity trade-offs of a generic class of Multi-Carrier Code-Division Multiple Access (MC-
CDMA) [38] systems, which are capable of supporting the interworking of existing as well as future
broadcast and personal communication systems.
Space-Division Multiple Access (SDMA) based OFDM [3, 193, 438] communication invoking
Multi-User Detection (MUD) [439] techniques has recently attracted intensive research interests. In
SDMA Multiple-Input, Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems the transmitted signals of L simultaneous
uplink mobile users – each equipped with a single transmitter antenna – are received by the P different
receiver antennas of the Base Station (BS). At the BS the individual users’ signals are separated with
the aid of their unique, user-speciﬁc spatial signature constituted by their channel transfer functions
or, equivalently, Channel Impulse Responses (CIRs). A variety of MUD schemes, such as the Least-
Squares (LS) [3,439,440] and Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) [3,193,197,439,440] detectors,
or Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) [3,193,197,439–441], Parallel Interference Cancellation
(PIC) [3,439,441,442] and Maximum Likelihood Detection (MLD) [3,193,197,198,439] schemes may
be invoked for the sake of separating the different users at the BS on a per-subcarrier basis. Among these
schemes, the MLD arrangement was found to give the best performance, although this was achieved
at the cost of a dramatically increased computational complexity, especially in the context of a high
number of users and higher-order modulation schemes, such as 16-QAM [441]. By contrast, MMSE
detection exhibits the lowest complexity in this set of detectors, while suffering from a performance
loss [3,441].
In order to improve the achievable performance by exploiting the multi-path diversity potential
offered by wideband channels, a further technique that is often used in the context of CDMA systems

is constituted by the spreading of the subcarrier signals over a number of adjacent subcarriers with
the aid of orthogonal spreading codes, such as Walsh–Hadamard Transform (WHT) based codes [32].
This technique may also be employed in multi-user SDMA-OFDM systems in the context of spreading
across all or a fraction of the subcarriers [443]. Spreading across all subcarriers using a single Walsh–
Hadamard Transform Spreading (WHTS) [3] code is expected to result in a better averaging of the
bursty error effects at the cost of a higher WHT complexity.
Furthermore, the achievable performance can be signiﬁcantly improved, if Forward Error Correc-
tion (FEC) schemes, such as for example Turbo Convolutional (TC) codes are incorporated into the
SDMA system [3]. Among a number of FEC schemes, Trellis-Coded Modulation (TCM) [314, 434],
Turbo TCM (TTCM) [314, 435], Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation (BICM) [314, 436] and Iteratively
Decoded BICM (BICM-ID) [314,437] have attracted intensive research interests, since they are capable
of achieving a substantial coding gain without bandwidth expansion.
In this section, we combine the above-mentioned various Coded Modulation (CM) schemes with
a multi-user SDMA-OFDM system, in which WHT-based subcarrier spreading is used. The structure
of this section is as follows. The SDMA MIMO channel model is described in Section 4.2.1, while
an overview of the CM-assisted multi-user SDMA-WHTS-OFDM system is provided in Section 4.2.2,
where the basic principles of CM, MUD and WHT-based spreading (WHTS) are also introduced. Our
simulation results are provided in Section 4.3, while our conclusions are summarized in Section 4.4.

System Model
4.2.1
SDMA MIMO Channel Model
Figure 4.1 shows an SDMA uplink MIMO channel model, where each of the L simultaneous mobile
users employs a single transmitter antenna at the Mobile Station (MS), while the BS’s receiver exploits
P antennas. At the kth subcarrier of the nth OFDM symbol received by the P-element receiver antenna
array we have the complex received signal vector x[n, k], which is constituted by the superposition of
the independently faded signals associated with the L mobile users and contaminated by the Additive
White Gaussian Noise (AWGN), expressed as
x = Hs + n,
(4.1)
where the (P ×1)-dimensional vector x, the (L×1)-dimensional vector s and the (P ×1)-dimensional
vector n are the received, transmitted and noise signals, respectively. Here we have omitted the indices
[n, k] for each vector for the sake of notational convenience. Speciﬁcally, the vectors x, s and n are
given by
x = [x1, x2, . . . , xP]T ,
(4.2)
s = [s(1), s(2), . . . , s(L)]T ,
(4.3)
n = [n1, n2, . . . , nP ]T .
(4.4)
The (P × L)-dimensional matrix H, which contains the Frequency-Domain CHannel Transfer
Functions (FD-CHTFs) of the L users, is given by
H = [H(1), H(2), . . . , H(L)],
(4.5)
where H(l) (l = 1, . . . , L) is the vector of the FD-CHTFs associated with the transmission paths from
the lth user’s transmitter antenna to each element of the P-element receiver antenna array, which is
expressed as
H(l) = [H(l)
1 , H(l)
2 , . . . , H(l)
P ]T ,
l = 1, . . . , L.
(4.6)
In Equations (4.1) to (4.6), we assume that the complex signal s(l) transmitted by the lth user has zero
mean and a variance of σ2
l . The AWGN noise signal np also exhibits a zero-mean and a variance of σ2
n.

4.2.2
CM-Assisted SDMA-OFDM Using Frequency-Domain Spreading
In Section 4.2.1 we brieﬂy reviewed the SDMA MIMO channel model, as shown in Figure 4.1. In
Figure 4.2, we present a schematic of the proposed CM-assisted and multi-user detected SDMA-OFDM
uplink system employing WHT spreading. At the transmitter end, as seen at the top of Figure 4.2, the
information bit sequences of the geographically separated L simultaneous mobile users are forwarded
to the CM encoders, where they are encoded into symbols. Each user’s encoded signal is divided
into a number of WHT signal blocks, denoted by s(l)
W,0 (l = 1, . . . , L), which are then forwarded to
the subcarrier-based WHT spreader, followed by the OFDM-related Inverse Fast Fourier Transform
(IFFT) modulator, which converts the frequency-domain signals to the time-domain modulated OFDM
symbols. The OFDM symbols are then transmitted by the MSs to the BS over the SDMA MIMO
channel. Then each element of the receiver antenna array shown at the bottom of Figure 4.2 receives
the superposition of the AWGN-contaminated transmitted signals and performs Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT) OFDM demodulation. The demodulated outputs xpW (p = 1, . . . , P ) seen in Figure 4.2 are
forwarded to the multi-user detector for separating the different users’ signals. The separated signals
ˆs(l)
W
(l = 1, . . . , L), namely the estimated versions of the transmitted signals, are independently
despread based on the inverse WHT (IWHT), resulting in the despread signals of ˆs(l)
W,0 (l = 1, . . . , L)
which are then decoded by the CM decoders of Figure 4.2.
The further structure of this section is as follows. A brief description of the MMSE MUD employed
in our SDMA-OFDM system is given in Section 4.2.2.1. The subcarrier-based WHTS is then introduced
in Section 4.2.2.2.
4.2.2.1
MMSE MUD
As mentioned earlier, MUD schemes have to be invoked at the receiver of the SDMA-OFDM system to
detect the received signals of different users. From the family of various MUD techniques, represented
for example by the Maximum Likelihood Detection (MLD) [3,193,197,198,439], Parallel Interference
Cancellation (PIC) [3, 439, 441, 442], Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) [3, 193, 197, 439–
441], MMSE [3, 193, 197, 439, 440] and LS [3, 439, 440] detectors, ML detection is known to exhibit
the optimum performance, although this is achieved at the highest complexity. In order to avoid the

the MMSE-MUD have been devised. Speciﬁcally, the MMSE detector exhibits the lowest detection
complexity in the set of detectors mentioned above, although this comes at the cost of a Bit Error Ratio
(BER) degradation [3,441].
In the MMSE-based MUD the estimates of the different users’ transmitted signals are generated
with the aid of the linear MMSE combiner. More speciﬁcally, the estimated signal vector ˆs ∈C(L×1)
generated from the transmitted signal s of the L simultaneous users, as shown in Figure 4.2, is obtained
by linearly combining the signals received by the P different receiver antenna elements with the aid of
the array weight matrix, as follows [3]:

4.2.2.2
Subcarrier-Based WHTS
In single- and multi-carrier CDMA systems, the employment of orthogonal codes is vital for the sake
of supporting multiple access [32]. In the context of multi-user SDMA-OFDM systems, orthogonal
codes may be employed to randomize the wideband channel’s frequency-selective fading, rather than
for supporting multiple users, since the multiple users are supported with the aid of the SDMA-OFDM
system employing a P-element antenna array and appropriate multi-user detection techniques.
A prominent class of orthogonal codes often used in CDMA systems is the family of orthogonal
Walsh codes [32], which are particularly attractive, since the operation of spreading with the aid of these
codes can be implemented in form of a ‘fast’ transform which takes advantage of the codes’ recursive
structure, similar to the FFT [3].

4.3. Simulation Results

Let us now provide a deeper insight into the operation of the subcarrier-based WHTS [3]. During
every OFDM symbol period prior to transmission of the independent user signals, the K data samples
associated with the subcarriers, where K is the FFT length, may be spread with the aid of the WHT
having a block size of K. This is achieved by left-multiplying the WHT signal block s(l)
W,0 (l = 1, . . . , L)
of Figure 4.2 by the K-order WHT matrix UWHTK for each user separately:
s(l)
W = UWHTKs(l)
W,0,
l = 1, . . . , L,
(4.9)
where s(l)
W is the lth user’s spread signal block, and UWHTK is given in a recursive form as
UWHTK =
1
√
2
	1 · UWHTK/2
1 · UWHTK/2
1 · UWHTK/2
−1 · UWHTK/2

,
(4.10)
while the lowest-order WHT unitary matrix is deﬁned by
UWHT2 =
1
√
2
	1

−1

.
(4.11)
When the WHT block size is long, e.g. identical to the FFT length of K = 512, the computational
complexity imposed by the length-K WHTS may be very high. Therefore a more practical solution is
to divide the K samples further into K/MWHT interleaved blocks, each of which has a block size of
MWHT < K. Speciﬁcally, the ith WHT block is constituted by the samples selected from the subcarriers
having the indices [3,443]
j = i + r
K
MWHT ,
0 ≤i ≤
K
MWHT −1,
0 ≤r ≤MWHT −1,
(4.12)
where i is the index of the WHT blocks within the same OFDM symbol. In Figure 4.3 we illustrate
the operation of the subcarrier-based WHTS, where the number of OFDM subcarriers is 512 and the
WHT block size is 32. Therefore in each OFDM symbol we have 512/32 = 16 frequency-domain
interleaved WHT blocks. At the top of Figure 4.3 an OFDM symbol is shown with the subcarriers’
indices displayed, while the bottom part of the ﬁgure shows the WHT blocks generated, which contain
subcarriers of the speciﬁed indices, as given by Equation (4.12). As Figure 4.3 shows, for example, the
signal sample carried by the second (r = 1) slot within the WHT block of index i = 0 is selected from
the subcarrier of index j = 16 within the original OFDM symbol. After the WHT blocks are formed,
the WHTS is then invoked with the aid of the length-MWHT WHT matrix given in Equation (4.10).
At the BS receiver seen in Figure 4.2, the despreading operation follows the inverse procedure of
that portrayed in Figure 4.3, which is invoked independently for the separated signal of each user. More
speciﬁcally, we have
ˆs(l)
W,0 = UWHTKˆs(l)
W ,
l = 1, . . . , L,
(4.13)
where ˆs(l)
W,0 and ˆs(l)
W
are the estimated versions of s(l)
W,0 and s(l)
W , respectively, while ˆs(l)
W
is achieved
by applying Equation (4.7) at each subcarrier of every length-MWHT WHT block. Upon employing the
WHTS technique, the detrimental effects imposed on the system’s average BER performance by the
speciﬁc subcarriers corrupted by deep frequency-domain channel fades can be potentially improved,
since the effects of the fades are spread over the entire WHT block. Hence the receiver has a high
chance of recovering the impaired transmitted signals of the badly affected subcarriers.
4.3
Simulation Results
In this section, we characterize the performance of the proposed CM-assisted MMSE-SDMA-OFDM
schemes in conjunction with WHTS. The channel is assumed to be OFDM symbol invariant, implying
that the taps of the impulse response are assumed to be constant for the duration of one OFDM symbol,

but they are faded at the beginning of each symbol [2]. Each user’s associated transmit power or
signal variance is assumed to be the same and normalized to unity, while the complex-valued fading
envelope of the different users’ signal is assumed to be uncorrelated. To simplify the experimental
conditions, the channel’s frequency-domain transfer function is assumed to be perfectly known in
all simulations. Nonetheless, these performance trends are expected to remain unchanged in case of
imperfect channel estimation, in particular, when the turbo-style PIC-aided Recursive Least-Squares
(RLS) channel estimators of Chapter 16 in reference [3] are used. This may be made plausible by noting
that turbo-style iterative detection techniques have been reported to be capable of achieving a virtually
indistinguishable performance from the idealistic system using perfect channel estimation [3,314].
4.3.1
MMSE-SDMA-OFDM Using WHTS
We commence by considering a multi-user SDMA-OFDM system operating without the assistance of
CM communicating over the SWATM channel of [2]. The impulse response of the three-tap SWATM
channel was given in Figure 3.32, while the speciﬁc channel parameters used were given in Table 3.10.
Each of the three paths experiences independent Rayleigh fading having the same normalized Doppler
frequency of f ′
d = 1.235 × 10−5. A total of 512 subcarriers and a cyclic preﬁx of 64 samples were
used for the OFDM modem.
Figure 4.4 compares the BER versus Eb/N0 performance of the MMSE-SDMA-OFDM system
equipped with two receiver antenna elements, while supporting one or two users both with and without
WHTS, respectively. Furthermore, the performance of the unprotected single-user BPSK scheme
communicating over an AWGN channel is also provided for reference. As expected, the WHTS-assisted
schemes perform better than their non-spread counterparts, both for one and two users. It is also
beneﬁcial to view the subcarrier BERs as a function of both the subcarrier index and Eb/N0, which
was portrayed in Figure 4.5 for the SDMA-OFDM system equipped with two BS receiver antennas for
supporting two users. The subcarrier BER is deﬁned as the BER averaged over a speciﬁc subcarrier
of all the consecutive OFDM symbols transmitted by the users. It was found that at a speciﬁc Eb/N0
value, the subcarrier BER curves shown at the top of Figure 4.5 exhibit undulations across the frequency
domain owing to deep channel fades at certain subcarriers, which could be potentially eliminated with
the aid of WHTS, as observed at the bottom of the ﬁgure. This suggests that the system’s average BER
performance can be potentially improved by using WHTS, since the bursty subcarrier errors can be
effectively spread across the subcarriers of the entire WHT block.

CM- and WHTS-assisted MMSE-SDMA-OFDM
Similar to the previous sections, let us ﬁrst investigate the SDMA-OFDM system’s performance while
communicating over the SWATM channel [2].
4.3.2.1
Performance over the SWATM Channel
For the various CM schemes used, we select the parameters so that all schemes have the same
effective throughput and the same number of decoding states, hence a similar decoding complexity.
More speciﬁcally, the code memory ν is ﬁxed to 6 for the non-iterative TCM and BICM schemes, so
that the number of decoding states becomes S = 2ν = 64. For the iterative TTCM and BICM-ID
schemes, however, ν is ﬁxed to 3, while the number of iterations for these schemes is set to 4 and 8,
respectively. Hence the total number of trellis states is 23 · 4 · 2 = 64 for TTCM and 23 · 8 · 1 = 64
for BICM-ID, since there are two eight-state decoders, which are invoked in four iterations in the
scenario of TTCM, while only one eight-state decoder is employed in the context of BICM-ID. The
generator polynomials expressed in octal format for TCM, TTCM, BICM and BICM-ID are [117
26],
[13
6], [133
171] and [15
17], respectively. The parameters of the various CM schemes used are
summarized in Table 4.1.

In Section 4.3.1 the beneﬁcial effects of WHTS on the MMSE-SDMA-OFDM system’s performance
were demonstrated. Let us now combine the various CM schemes considered with the multi-user
MMSE-SDMA-OFDM system. The corresponding simulation results are portrayed in Figure 4.6, where
the top and bottom of the ﬁgure illustrate the BER and CodeWord Error Ratio (CWER) versus Eb/N0
performance of the proposed CM-MMSE-SDMA-OFDM schemes, respectively.

the performance of the unprotected 4-QAM SDMA-OFDM system and that of the single-user BPSK
scheme communicating over an AWGN channel is also provided as a benchmark. As observed in
Figure 4.6, the TC-assisted arrangement and the various CM-assisted schemes provide a similar BER
performance in both scenarios. As expected, all the FEC-aided schemes perform signiﬁcantly better than
their unprotected counterparts in the BER performance investigations. Furthermore, the TTCM-aided
scheme is found to give the best CWER performance from the set of all CM-aided schemes in both the
half-loaded and fully loaded scenarios, where α2 is equal to 0.5 and 1, respectively. This suggests that
more transmission errors can be eliminated by TTCM than by the other three CM schemes, although
the burst errors inﬂicted by deep frequency-domain channel fades cannot be recovered completely.
However, this effect may be potentially mitigated by employing WHTS, as discussed in Section 4.2.2.2.
As expected, for each of the schemes evaluated, we can see that the performance achieved in the
context of α2 = 0.5 is better than that attained when α2 = 1. This phenomenon may be explained as
follows. Since P receiver antenna elements are invoked at the BS, there are P uplink paths for each
MS user having one transmitter antenna. Hence the achievable spatial diversity order provided by the
P paths remains the same for each user, regardless of the total number of simultaneous users supported.
However, when the user load is lower, i.e. the number of users supported is lower, the MMSE combiner
will beneﬁt from a higher degree of freedom in terms of the choice of the array weights optimized for
differentiating the different users’ transmitted signal, and thus the system becomes more efﬁcient in
terms of suppressing the reduced Multi-User Interference (MUI).
In Figure 4.7, we provide the subcarrier-based BER versus Eb/N0 performance of the TTCM-
assisted MMSE-SDMA-OFDM system in the context of two users and two receiver antenna elements.
Comparing Figure 4.5 with Figure 4.7, where the beneﬁcial effects of WHTS have been characterized,
we can see that the achievable performance improvement attained by TTCM, or more generally by the
CM schemes, is typically higher than that achieved by WHTS.
Having discussed the beneﬁcial effects of WHTS and those of CM on the SDMA-OFDM system, as
described in Section 4.3.1 and earlier in this section, respectively, we now combine the MMSE-SDMA-
OFDM system with CM and WHTS. The corresponding simulation results are portrayed in Figure 4.8,
where the left and right sides of the ﬁgure illustrate the scenarios of α2 = 0.5 and α2 = 1, while the top

119
and bottom of the ﬁgure show the BER and CWER performance, respectively. Again, the TTCM-aided
scheme was found to give the best CWER performance among all the CM-aided schemes considered.
Comparing Figure 4.6 and Figure 4.8 shows that in the CM-aided MMSE-SDMA-OFDM system the
employment of WHTS having a block size of 32 only insigniﬁcantly improves the system’s BER and
CWER performance, since most of the achievable diversity gain may have already been achieved by
using the CM schemes. However, the employment of WHTS has the potential of further enhancing
the CM-SDMA-OFDM system’s performance in highly dispersive propagation environments, an issue
which will be further discussed in Section 4.3.2.2.
Furthermore, if a longer CM codeword length is used, the system’s performance can be further
improved at the cost of a higher computational complexity. The effects of different CM codeword
lengths can be seen in Figure 4.9. As expected, when a higher codeword length is employed, the
system’s performance becomes better, since a longer CM codeword is capable of better averaging
the bursty error effects. However, this performance improvement is achieved at a substantially higher
complexity. For examples of the associated complexity issues, the interested reader is referred to
Chapter 9 of [314]
4.3.2.1.2
Four Receiver Antenna Elements
In Section 4.3.2.1.1, we compared the various CM- and WHTS-aided schemes in the context of one
or two users and two receiver antenna elements. In this section, we investigate a higher-order spatial
diversity scenario by increasing the number of receiver antenna elements, and thus supporting a higher
number of simultaneous users.
Figures 4.10 and 4.11 show the BER and CWER performance achieved by the CM- and WHTS-
aided MMSE-SDMA-OFDM schemes in the scenario where there are four receivers supporting a
maximum number of four users. The BER performance of the 32-state TC-assisted MMSE-SDMA-
OFDM [3] system is also provided as a reference. As seen in Figure 4.10, similar to the two-receiver
scenario of Figure 4.8, the TC-assisted arrangement and the various CM-aided schemes achieve a
similar BER performance at a speciﬁc user load. However, again, the TTCM-aided scheme stands out
among all CM-aided schemes by attaining a better CWER performance.
Furthermore, comparing Figure 4.8 with Figure 4.10, where there are two receivers supporting
a maximum of two users, we ﬁnd that at the same user-load level, e.g. at α4 = α2 = 0.5 or
α4 = α2 = 1.0, the Eb/N0 performance achieved by the four-receiver system is approximately 4.5 dB
better than that of the two-receiver system, provided that the same CM-assisted scheme is used. This is
because, when the number of the BS receiver antenna elements is increased, the SDMA MIMO system
becomes capable of providing a higher diversity gain, which may be expected to improve the system’s
performance for each user.
4.3.2.2
Performance over the COST207 HT Channel
In this section, we will investigate the performance of the CM- and WHTS-assisted MMSE-SDMA-
OFDM schemes, while communicating over a more dispersive channel, namely the 12-path COST207
[444] Hilly Terrain (HT) channel channel. The impulse response of the channel model is portrayed
in Figure 4.12, while the speciﬁc channel parameters are given in Table 4.2. Each of the 12 paths
experiences independent Rayleigh fading having the same normalized Doppler frequency of f ′
d = 1.0×
10−5. Compared with the 512-subcarrier OFDM modem used for communication over the SWATM
channel investigated in Section 4.3.2.1, we now employ a higher number of 2048 subcarriers and a
cyclic preﬁx of 256, since the maximum path delay of the COST207 HT channel is longer than that
of the SWATM channel, and hence it requires a longer cyclic preﬁx for combating the effects of Inter-
Symbol Interference (ISI) [3,24].
In Sections 4.3.2.2.1 and 4.3.2.2.2, we will compare the corresponding performance of the various
CM- and WHTS-assisted MMSE-SDMA-OFDM schemes, when communicating over the COST207
HT channel. The parameters of the CM schemes used are summarized in Table 4.3.

the additional Eb/N0 gain achieved by spreading in the context of the various CM- and WHTS-assisted
schemes was rather modest. This result may suggest that in highly dispersive environments, such as
that characterized by the 12-path COST207 HT channel, the channel-coded SDMA-OFDM system’s
performance may be further improved by employing WHTS. This spreading-induced Eb/N0 gain was
achieved because the detrimental effects imposed on the system’s average BER performance by the

deeply faded subcarriers has been spread over the entire WHT block, and these randomized or dispersed
channel errors may be more readily corrected by the CM decoders.
It transpires from Figures 4.13 and 4.14 that the four CM-aided schemes communicating over
the COST207 HT channel attain a different performance. This observation is different from what was
noted in Figures 4.6 and 4.8, where the performance of the various CM-aided schemes communicating
over the SWATM channel was more similar. The reason for this phenomenon is that the amplitude
variation of the FD-CHTFs becomes both more frequent and more dramatic when the channel exhibits
a longer path delay [314]. Since the COST207 HT channel’s maximum path delay is 19.9 µs, which is
signiﬁcantly longer than the 48.9 ns maximum dispersion of the SWATM channel, the fades occur more
frequently in the FD-CHTF of the COST207 HT channel, as indicated by Figure 4.15. Apparently, in
the COST207 HT channel displayed on the left side of Figure 4.15, the frequency-domain separation
between the neighbouring fades is proportionately lower than that in the SWATM channel shown on
the right side of Figure 4.15. This characteristic will result in more uniformly distributed corrupted
subcarrier symbols which can be more readily corrected by the channel codes. More speciﬁcally, when
a deep fade occurs in the FD-CHTF of the SWATM channel, a number of consecutive subcarriers which
are located in the corresponding faded block of subcarriers may be seriously affected by the fade.
This implies that the channel codes, e.g. one of the four CM schemes, may have a lower chance
of correcting less frequently occurring but prolonged error bursts than more frequently encountered
isolated errors. The more prolonged error bursts imposed by the SWATM channel often overload the
error-correction capability of the CM schemes, regardless of which of the four CM schemes is used,
since, owing to the preponderance of transmission errors, their trellis decoder often opts for choosing
the wrong trellis path. This is particularly true for CM schemes using short channel interleavers.
Therefore, this phenomenon results in a similar performance for the various CM-aided schemes, when
communicating over the SWATM channel, as seen in Figures 4.6 and 4.8.
By contrast, in the context of the COST207 HT channel such prolonged error bursts are unlikely
to occur, since the faded subcarriers result in more frequent but less prolonged error bursts, which are

reminiscent of the error distributions experienced in AWGN channels and therefore may have a higher

As mentioned in Section 4.3.2.1.2, when the number of receiver antenna elements is increased to four,
the performance of the system becomes better than that experienced in the two-receiver scenario, which
was discussed in Section 4.3.2.2.1. In Figures 4.16 and 4.17, we compare both the BER and CWER

performance of the different CM- and WHTS-assisted schemes for transmissions over the COST207
HT channel, while employing four receiver antenna elements at user loads of α4 = 0.5 and α4 = 1.0,
as shown on the left and right sides of Figures 4.16 and 4.17, respectively. Again, it can be seen in
the ﬁgures that the performance achieved by the four-receiver SDMA-OFDM system, which has a
higher diversity order, is better than that attained by the two-receiver system both at the user loads
of α2,4 = 0.5 and α2,4 = 1.0, averaging an approximately 3 dB Eb/N0 improvement for a speciﬁc
CM-aided scheme. Hence a plausible conclusion is that, at a speciﬁc user load αP , the more receivers
the SDMA-MIMO system employs, the higher the attainable grade of diversity becomes and thus an
improved performance may be achieved. However, the relative performance improvement achieved by
an already high-order system upon doubling the number of receivers is expected to be lower than that in
a lower-order system, since most of the attainable gain may have already been achieved, which results
in a near-Gaussian performance.
4.3.2.2.3
Performance Comparisons
Table 4.4 summarizes the Eb/N0 values required by the various CM- and WHTS-assisted MMSE-
SDMA-OFDM schemes for achieving a BER of 10−5. The corresponding spreading-induced Eb/N0
gains achieved by the WHTS-assisted schemes are also provided, which are deﬁned as the Eb/N0
difference, expressed in terms of decibels, at a BER of 10−5 between the WHTS-assisted and the
unspreading system having the same effective throughput.
Several useful points can be concluded from Table 4.4. Firstly, when we have a speciﬁc user
load, the spreading-induced Eb/N0 gain achieved by a system having a lower diversity order is
higher, regardless of whether CM is employed or not. For example, when we have a user load of
α2,4 = 0.5, the spreading-induced Eb/N0 gains achieved in the No-FEC-, TCM-, TTCM-, BICM-
and BICM-ID-assisted two-receiver systems are 6.32, 0.91, 0.13, 0.41 and 0.56 dB, respectively. By
contrast, lower spreading-induced Eb/N0 gains of 3.46, 0.28, 0.03, 0.05 and 0.09 dB are achieved in
the corresponding four-receiver systems, respectively. In other words, in relatively lower diversity-order

scenarios, the subcarrier-based WHTS technique may be expected to attain a higher system performance
improvement.
Furthermore, if the number of users supported is ﬁxed but the number of receiver antenna elements
is varied, similar conclusions may be drawn. When there are two simultaneous users, for example, the
spreading-induced Eb/N0 gains achieved in the two-receiver scenario are higher than those achieved

in the four-receiver scenario, as observed in Table 4.4. A plausible explanation for this fact may be as
follows. In the SDMA MIMO system, when a higher number of receiver antenna elements is employed,
a potentially higher space diversity can be achieved. In this scenario, the beneﬁts of spreading may be
less substantial, especially in the CM-aided system, since most of the attainable gain has already been
achieved by using the channel codes.

Secondly, when the BS employs a given number of receiver antenna elements, the spreading-
induced Eb/N0 gains achieved in the context of the fully loaded systems are higher than in the half-
loaded systems, regardless of the employment of channel codes. For instance, if we have two receivers
installed in the BS, the various schemes having a user load of α2 = 1.0 attain a higher spreading-
induced Eb/N0 gain than their half-loaded counterparts, as seen in Table 4.4. This suggests that more
beneﬁts may arise from WHTS, especially in the fully loaded scenarios, where the MUD suffers from
a relatively low efﬁciency in differentiating the different users’ signals. Furthermore, if a longer WHT
block size is used, the Eb/N0 gain of WHTS may even be higher, since the detrimental bursty error
effects degrading the system’s average BER performance will be spread over a higher block length, thus
increasing the chances of correcting a higher number of errors, as will be presented in Section 4.3.2.3.
In order to characterize the system’s performance at different user loads, as an example we portray
the BER performance of the TTCM- and WHTS-aided scheme at a range of different user loads
in Figure 4.18. As expected, the system’s performance improves when the user load is lower, since
the MUD will have a better chance of separating the different users’ signals. It is also observed
in Figure 4.18 that the relevant Eb/N0 gain achieved by a lower-load scheme over a higher-load
arrangement reduces when the user load decreases. This again shows that most of the achievable Eb/N0
gain has already been attained at a medium user load.
Figure 4.19 shows the Eb/N0 crossing points of the various CM-WHTS-MMSE-SDMA-OFDM
schemes at the BER of 10−5. It is shown explicitly that the performance gap between the different
CM-aided schemes increases as the user load increases. Furthermore, from Figure 4.19 we can see that
the TTCM-aided scheme performs best in high user-load scenarios, i.e. for α4 ≥0.5. In other words,
the other three CM schemes, namely the TCM, BICM and BICM-ID arrangements, will suffer a higher
performance degradation than TTCM when the MUD’s user-separation capability erodes owing to the
increased MUI.
In Figure 4.20 we compare the total gain achieved by the four different CM-aided schemes, which
includes both the coding gain and the spreading-induced Eb/N0 gain. As the ﬁgure indicates, the

α4 ≤0.5, the various schemes provide a similar performance, because most of the attainable gain in
the four-receiver SDMA-OFDM system has already been achieved, as discussed earlier in this section.
4.3.2.3
Effects of the WHT Block Size
In Sections 4.3.2.1 and 4.3.2.2 we investigated the CM- and WHTS-assisted MMSE-SDMA-OFDM
system for transmission over the SWATM and COST207 HT channel, respectively. In this section,
we will study how the variation of the WHT block size affects the system’s performance, when
communicating over the above two channel models.
As mentioned in Section 4.3.2.2.3, when a larger WHT block size is used for the SDMA-OFDM
system, the system’s performance may potentially be improved, since the signals carried by the
subcarriers that are badly affected by deep channel fades could be spread over a larger set of subcarriers,
which may mitigate the detrimental channel effects and thus assists the receiver in achieving a better
performance. In order to show the effects imposed by different-length WHTS schemes, we provide
simulation results generated in the context of different WHT block sizes in both the no-CM and CM-
aided scenarios, as shown on the left and right sides of Figure 4.21, respectively. As expected, the
system’s performance was improved on increasing the WHT block size, regardless of whether CM was
employed or not. In the context of the COST207 HT channel of Figure 4.12, similarly, a performance
improvement is observed when an increased WHT block size is employed as portrayed in Figure 4.22.
Furthermore, we can see that the spreading-induced Eb/N0 gains achieved by the no-CM schemes,
when using a larger WHT block size, are signiﬁcantly higher than those attained by the TTCM-
aided schemes, as observed in Figures 4.21 and 4.22. This suggests that in the SDMA-OFDM system
employing no CM, the performance improvement potential due to the employment of a larger WHT
block size is higher than that in the CM-aided system, where most of the achievable diversity gain
has been attained by the time diversity of the CM schemes. However, as suggested by Table 4.2, the
other three CM-aided schemes, e.g. the TCM-aided arrangement, may be capable of achieving a higher
spreading-induced gain than the TTCM-aided scheme with the aid of WHTS. Therefore, owing to their

lower time diversity and relatively more modest unspread performance, a potentially higher spreading-
induced Eb/N0 gain may be achieved by combining WHTS with the TCM-, BICM- and BICM-ID-
assisted schemes than in conjunction with the TTCM-aided arrangement, when a larger WHT block
size is used. Having studied the effects of different WHT block sizes, let us now consider the impact of
varying the Doppler frequency.
4.3.2.4
Effects of the Doppler Frequency
In our further investigations we have generated the BER versus Eb/N0 curves of the TTCM- and
WHTS-assisted MMSE-SDMA-OFDM system communicating over the COST207 HT channel, when
the maximum Doppler frequency was ﬁxed to a range of different values. For simplicity, here we
have assumed perfect channel estimation. As before, the CIR of the 12-path COST207 HT channel
of Figure 4.12 was used. To present these results in a compact form, the Eb/N0 values required to
maintain a BER of 10−5 were extracted. In Figure 4.23, we show the Eb/N0 crossing point at the BER
of 10−5 versus the maximum Doppler frequency for the WHTS-assisted MMSE-SDMA-OFDM system
both with and without the aid of TTCM, where two receivers were used for supporting two users. We
conclude from the near-horizontal curves shown in Figure 4.23 that the maximum Doppler frequency
does not signiﬁcantly affect the performance of the WHTS-assisted MMSE-SDMA-OFDM system,
regardless of the employment of TTCM. This may be a desirable beneﬁt of the error-randomizing effect
of WHTS, resulting in a robustness against the variation of the mobile speed. Moreover, as expected,
the performance of the TTCM-aided scheme was consistently better than that of the scheme using no
channel coding, as evidenced by Figure 4.23.

4.4. Chapter Summary
135
It is worth noting that when the channel’s Doppler frequency is high, the effects of Inter-Carrier
Interference (ICI) may become signiﬁcant,1 as argued on page 81 of [3]. In this case, for example, the
ICI cancellation techniques of Chapter 4 in [3] may be invoked for combating the ICI effects.
4.4
Chapter Summary
The system model of our multi-user uplink SDMA-based OFDM system was presented in Section 4.2,
where the SDMA-MIMO channel model was introduced in Section 4.2.1, followed by the detailed
description of the CM-assisted multi-user SDMA-OFDM system employing the frequency-domain
subcarrier-based WHTS scheme of Section 4.2.2. The theoretical foundations of the MMSE-based
MUD were provided in Section 4.2.2.1. Furthermore, a detailed discussion of the WHTS technique
was presented in Section 4.2.2.2.
In Section 4.3 the performance of the various CM- and WHTS-assisted MMSE-SDMA-OFDM
schemes was studied and compared. The uncoded MMSE-SDMA-OFDM system was ﬁrst investigated
in Section 4.3.1, where it was found that WHTS was capable of improving the system’s performance,
since the bursty subcarrier errors can be pseudo-randomly spread across the subcarriers of the entire
WHT block. In the investigations outlined in Section 4.3.2 our performance comparison among
the different CM- and WHTS-assisted MMSE-SDMA-OFDM schemes was detailed. Speciﬁcally,
the unspread CM-aided SDMA-OFDM system using two receiver antenna elements was studied in
Section 4.3.2.1.1, whose performance was compared with that of the WHTS-assisted system, dispensing
with the employment of CM. Firstly, it was found that the performance achieved by all half-loaded
schemes was better than that attained by the fully loaded arrangements. This is because, when the
user load is lower, the MUD will achieve a higher efﬁciency in differentiating the different users’
transmitted signal, since the multi-user interference is lower. Therefore, the system becomes more
efﬁcient in terms of suppressing the detrimental fading channel effects. Secondly, it was also noticed
that the achievable performance improvement attained by CM was typically higher than that achieved
by WHTS, as evidenced by comparing Figure 4.5 with Figure 4.7.
Furthermore, we combined the MMSE-SDMA-OFDM system with both CM and WHTS in
Section 4.3.2.1.1. The corresponding simulation results portrayed in Figure 4.8 showed that the TTCM-
aided scheme achieved the best CWER performance among all the CM- and WHTS-assisted schemes
considered. Moreover, the comparison of Figure 4.6 and Figure 4.8 suggested that in the CM-aided
MMSE-SDMA-OFDM system, the employment of WHTS having a block size of 32 subcarriers only
insigniﬁcantly improved the system’s BER and CWER performance, since most of the achievable
diversity gain may have already been achieved by the time diversity of the CM schemes. It was
also found that when a higher CM codeword length was used, the system’s performance was further
improved, as observed in Figure 4.9, since a longer CM codeword is capable of more efﬁciently
dispersing and averaging the bursty error effects.
In Section 4.3.2.1.2, the system’s performance evaluated in the four-receiver CM scenarios was
compared, when communicating over the SWATM channel of Figure 3.32. Comparing Figure 4.8 with
Figure 4.10, we found that at the same user-load level, e.g. at α4 = α2 = 0.5 or α4 = α2 = 1.0,
the Eb/N0 performance achieved by the four-receiver system was better than that of the two-receiver
system, provided that the same CM-assisted scheme was used. The reason for this phenomenon is that
when the SDMA-MIMO system’s space-diversity order is increased by employing a higher number
of receiver antenna elements, it becomes capable of providing a higher diversity gain, which may be
expected to improve the system’s performance for each user.
1Since the ICI is caused by the variation of the channel impulse response during the transmission of each OFDM symbol, we
introduce the OFDM-symbol-normalized Doppler frequency Fd [3]. In the case of a maximum Doppler frequency of 200 Hz, for
example, the corresponding OFDM-symbol-normalized Doppler frequency Fd will become as high as Fd = fd ·NTs = f ′
d ·N =
0.023, where N is the cyclically extended OFDM symbol’s total duration expressed as N = K + cp, while the associated values
of fd, f ′
d, Ts, K and cp are given in Table 4.2.

136
Chapter 4. Coded Modulation Assisted Multi-user SDMA-OFDM
The performance of the various CM- and WHTS-assisted MMSE-SDMA-OFDM systems was
evaluated in the context of the COST207 HT channel of Figure 4.12 in Section 4.3.2.2, which included
the two- and four-receiver scenarios in Section 4.3.2.2.1 and Section 4.3.2.2.2, respectively. It was found
that without the assistance of WHTS the TTCM-aided scheme constituted the best design option in
terms of both the BER and CWER in comparison with the other three CM-aided schemes. When WHTS
was incorporated into the CM-MMSE-SDMA-OFDM system, a further Eb/N0 gain was achieved by
all the schemes, which was different from the scenario of Section 4.3.2.1 recorded for transmission
over the SWATM channel, where the additional Eb/N0 gain achieved by WHTS in the context of the
various CM- and WHTS-assisted schemes was rather modest. This may suggest that in highly dispersive
environments, such as that characterized by the 12-path COST207 HT channel of Figure 4.12, the
channel-coded SDMA-OFDM system’s performance may be further improved by employing WHTS.
This is because the detrimental fading-induced bursty error effects degrading the system’s average BER
performance owing to the deeply faded subcarriers can be spread over the entire WHT block, and these
dispersed and randomized channel errors may be more readily corrected by the CM decoder.
Furthermore, the four CM-aided schemes communicating over the COST207 HT channel of
Figure 4.12 attain a different performance, as shown in Figures 4.13 and 4.14. This conclusion is
different from what was noted in Figures 4.6 and 4.8, where the performance of the various CM-
aided schemes communicating over the SWATM channel of Figure 3.32 was more similar. This is
due to the more frequent and more dramatic amplitude variation of the FD-CHTF in the COST207 HT
channel, which exhibits a signiﬁcantly longer maximum path delay than that of the SWATM channel,
as indicated by Figure 4.15. This characteristic resulted in more randomly dispersed rather than bursty
corrupted subcarrier symbols, which can be more readily corrected by the channel codes. Hence, in
the context of the COST207 HT channel of Figure 4.12, the different error-correcting capability of the
various CM schemes becomes more explicit than that exhibited in the scenario of the SWATM channel
of Figure 3.32.
In Table 4.4 of Section 4.3.2.2.3 we summarized the Eb/N0 values required by the various CM-
and WHTS-assisted MMSE-SDMA-OFDM schemes for achieving a BER of 10−5, also showing the
corresponding gains attained by the WHTS-assisted schemes. We observed that, on the one hand, when
we had a speciﬁc user load, the spreading-induced Eb/N0 gain achieved by a system having a lower
diversity order was higher, regardless of the employment of CM. In other words, the subcarrier-based
WHTS technique may be expected to attain a higher system performance improvement in relatively
lower diversity-order scenarios. Moreover, if we supported a ﬁxed number of users but varied the
number of receiver antenna elements, similar conclusions might be drawn. A plausible explanation
for this fact may be that in the SDMA-MIMO system, a potentially higher space-diversity gain may
be achieved when a higher number of receiver antenna elements is employed, and thus the beneﬁts of
WHTS may be less substantial. This may be particularly true in the context of the CM-aided systems,
since most of the attainable gain has already been achieved by using the channel codes. On the other
hand, when a given number of receiver antenna elements was used, the spreading-induced Eb/N0
gains achieved in the context of the fully loaded systems were higher than in the half-loaded systems,
regardless of the employment of channel codes. This suggests that more beneﬁts may arise from WHTS,
especially in the fully loaded scenarios, where the MUD suffers from a relatively low efﬁciency in
differentiating the different users’ signals.
Additionally, we provided the Eb/N0 crossing points, and the corresponding total gain achieved
by the various CM-WHTS-MMSE-SDMA-OFDM schemes at the BER of 10−5, in Figures 4.19
and 4.20 of Section 4.3.2.2.3, respectively. It was demonstrated that the performance gap between
the different CM-aided schemes increased as the user load increased. Furthermore, it was observed
in Figures 4.19 and 4.20 that the TCM-, BICM- and BICM-ID-aided schemes suffered a higher
performance degradation than the TTCM arrangement, when the MUD’s user-separation capability
eroded owing to the increased multi-user interference. At a relatively low user load the various schemes
provided a similar performance, because most of the attainable gain of the four-receiver SDMA-OFDM
system had already been achieved, as discussed earlier in Section 4.3.2.2.3.

4.4. Chapter Summary

The effects of using different WHT block sizes was studied in Section 4.3.2.3, in both the SWATM
and COST207 HT channel scenarios, as seen in Figures 4.21 and 4.22, respectively. As expected, it
was found that the system’s performance was improved, while the WHT block size used was increased.
This is because, when a larger WHT block size is used by the SDMA-OFDM system, the data symbols
carried by the subcarriers that are badly affected by deep channel fades could be spread over a larger
WHT length, which may mitigate the detrimental channel effects and thus assists the receiver in terms
of achieving a better error-correction capability. Furthermore, it was suggested by the simulation results
of Section 4.3.2.3 that in the SDMA-OFDM system operating without the aid of CM, the performance
improvement potential due to the employment of a larger WHT block size was higher than that in the
CM-aided system, where most of the achievable diversity gain has been attained by using CM.
Finally, we studied the effects of the Doppler frequency in Section 4.3.2.4. It was concluded that
the maximum Doppler frequency does not signiﬁcantly affect the performance of the WHTS-assisted
MMSE-SDMA-OFDM system, regardless of the employment of CM, as for example portrayed in
Figure 4.23.
From the investigations conducted, we conclude that the various CM schemes, namely TCM,
TTCM, BICM and BICM-ID, are capable of substantially improving the achievable performance of
SDMA-OFDM systems. The employment of WHTS has the potential of further enhancing the system’s
performance in highly dispersive propagation environments. As a result, the TTCM- and WHTS-
assisted scheme was found to have the best CWER performance in all the scenarios investigated.
Furthermore, it was also the best design option in terms of the achievable Eb/N0 gain expressed in
dB, when communicating in highly dispersive environments, e.g. over the COST207 HT channel of
Figure 4.12, while carrying a high user load of αP ≥0.5.
In the next chapter, our research is targeted at contriving a more sophisticated MUD, namely
the Genetic Algorithm (GA) assisted MUD, in order to improve further the SDMA-OFDM system’s
achievable performance.

Hybrid Multi-user Detection for
SDMA-OFDM Systems

Introduction1
In the previous chapter, the MMSE MUD was investigated in the context of various CM-assisted
SDMA-OFDM systems. Furthermore, the WHT-based frequency-domain spreading technique was
incorporated into the CM-assisted MMSE-SDMA-OFDM system to attain performance enhancements.
However, the SDMA system’s performance is somewhat limited owing to the employment of the low-
complexity MMSE MUD, which is devised based on the suboptimal linear MMSE algorithm. On the
other hand, the high-complexity optimum Maximum Likelihood (ML) MUD is capable of achieving
the best performance owing to the invocation of an exhaustive search. However, the computational
complexity of the ML MUD typically increases exponentially with the number of simultaneous users
supported by the SDMA-OFDM system, which may render its implementation prohibitive. In the
literature, a range of suboptimal nonlinear MUDs have been proposed, such as for example the MUDs
based on Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) [3, 193, 197, 439–441] or Parallel Interference
Cancellation (PIC) [3, 439, 441, 442] techniques. Instead of detecting and demodulating the users’
signals in a sequential manner, as the MMSE MUD does, the PIC and SIC MUDs invoke an iterative
processing technique that combines detection and demodulation. More speciﬁcally, the output signal
generated during the previous detection iteration is demodulated and fed back to the input of the MUD
for the next iterative detection step. Similar techniques invoking decision feedback have been applied
also in the context of classic channel equalization. However, since the philosophy of both the PIC
and SIC MUDs is based on the principle of removing the effects of the interfering users during each
detection stage, they are prone to error propagation occurring during the consecutive detection stages
due to the erroneously detected signals of the previous stages [3]. In order to mitigate the effects of error
propagation, an attractive design alternative is to simultaneously detect all the users’ signals, rather than
invoke iterative interference cancellation schemes. Recently, another branch of MUD schemes referred
to as Sphere Decoder (SD) [445–451] has also been proposed for multi-user systems, which is capable
of achieving ML performance at a lower complexity.
As far as we are concerned, most of the above-mentioned techniques were proposed for systems
where the number of users is less than or equal to the number of receivers, referred to here as the
underloaded or fully loaded scenarios, respectively. However, in practical applications it is possible

that the number of users L to be supported exceeds that of the receiver antennas P, which is often
referred to as an overloaded scenario. In overloaded systems, the (P × L)-dimensional MIMO channel
matrix representing the (P × L) number of channel links becomes singular, thus rendering the
degree of freedom of the detector insufﬁcient. This will catastrophically degrade the performance of
numerous known detection approaches, such as for example the Vertical Bell Labs Layered Space–
Time architecture (V-BLAST) [105, 108, 452] detector of [135], the MMSE algorithm of [3, 439] and
the QR Decomposition combined with the M-algorithm (QRD-M) method of [172].
Based on this motivation, in this chapter a sophisticated nonlinear MUD is devised, which exploits
the power of genetic algorithms. Genetic Algorithms (GAs) [328, 453–456] have been applied to a
number of problems, such as machine learning and modelling adaptive processes. Moreover, GA-based
MUD has been proposed by Juntti et al. [457] and Wang et al. [458], where the analysis was based on
the AWGN channel in the absence of diversity techniques. The proposal by Erg¨un et al. [459] utilized
GAs as the ﬁrst stage of a multi-stage, multi-user detector, in order to provide good initial guesses
for the subsequent stages. Its employment in Rayleigh fading channels was considered by Yen et al.
in [38, 460] and [38, 461] in diverse scenarios both with and without the aid of diversity techniques,
respectively.
However, most of the GA-aided transceiver research mentioned above was conducted in the context
of Code-Division Multiple Access (CDMA) systems [38, 462]. By contrast, in this chapter, we apply
GAs in the context of multi-user OFDM schemes, rather than CDMA systems. More speciﬁcally,
we combine GAs with the MMSE MUD for the sake of contriving a more powerful concatenated
MMSE-GA MUD, which is capable of maintaining near-optimum performance in the above-mentioned
overloaded systems. Furthermore, TTCM is selected as the FEC scheme for the proposed MMSE-GA
MUD in the SDMA-OFDM system, since it generally provides the best performance in the family of
CM schemes in the context of MMSE-SDMA-OFDM systems, as demonstrated in Chapter 4. We will
show in this chapter that the proposed MMSE-GA assisted TTCM-SDMA-OFDM system is capable
of achieving a similar performance to that attained by its optimum ML MUD assisted counterpart
at a signiﬁcantly lower computational complexity, especially at high user loads. Furthermore, the
performance of the proposed GA-aided system can be further improved if an enhanced iterative GA
MUD is employed. This improvement is achieved at the cost of increased complexity, which is, however,
still substantially lower than that imposed by the ML MUD.
The structure of this chapter is as follows. An overview of the GA-assisted TTCM-aided MMSE-
SDMA-OFDM system is given in Section 5.2.1, followed by the introduction of the basic principles
of the concatenated MMSE-GA MUD of Section 5.2.2. Our simulation results are provided in
Section 5.2.3, while the associated complexity issues are discussed in Section 5.2.4. The enhanced
GA MUD is introduced in Section 5.3, including the improved mutation scheme of Section 5.3.1
and the enhanced GA MUD framework of Section 5.3.2, while the associated simulation results are
provided in Sections 5.3.1.3 and 5.3.2.2, respectively, followed by the associated complexity analysis
in Section 5.3.3. Our ﬁnal conclusions are summarized in Section 5.4.

System Overview
In Figure 5.1, we present a schematic of the proposed concatenated MMSE-GA MUD aided SDMA-
OFDM uplink system. At the transmitter end, as seen at the top of Figure 5.1, the information
bit sequences of the geographically separated L simultaneous mobile users are forwarded to the
TTCM [314] encoders, where they are encoded into symbols. The encoded signals s(l) (l = 1, . . . , L)
of the L users are then forwarded to the OFDM-related Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT)
modulator, which converts the frequency-domain signals to the time-domain modulated OFDM
symbols. The OFDM symbols are then transmitted by the independent Mobile Stations (MSs) to the
Base Station (BS) over the SDMA MIMO channel, which was presented in Section 4.2.1. Then each

the transmitted signals faded and contaminated by the channel and performs Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT) based OFDM demodulation. The demodulated outputs xp (p = 1, . . . , P ) seen in Figure 5.1 are
forwarded to the proposed concatenated MMSE-GA MUD for separating the different users’ signals.
The separated signals ˆs(l) (l = 1, . . . , L), namely the estimated versions of the L users’ transmitted
signals, are then independently decoded by the TTCM decoders of Figure 5.1.
5.2.2
MMSE-GA-concatenated MUD
5.2.2.1
Optimization Metric for the GA MUD
The optimum ML MUD [3] uses an exhaustive search for ﬁnding the most likely transmitted signals.
More explicitly, for a ML-detection-assisted SDMA-OFDM system supporting L simultaneous users,
a total of 2mL metric evaluations has to be invoked, where m denotes the number of Bits Per Symbol
(BPS), in order to detect the L-user symbol vector ˆsML that consists of the most likely transmitted
symbols of the L users at a speciﬁc subcarrier, given by
ˆsML = arg

min
ˇs∈ML ∥x −Hˇs∥2
,
(5.1)
where the (P × 1)-dimensional received signal vector x and the (P × L)-dimensional Frequency-
Domain CHannel Transfer Function (FD-CHTF) matrix H are deﬁned by Equations (4.2) and (4.5),
respectively. The set ML in Equation (5.1), which is constituted by 2mL trial vectors, is formulated as
ML = {ˇs = [ˇs(1), ˇs(2), . . . , ˇs(L)]T | ˇs(1), ˇs(2), . . . , ˇs(L) ∈Mc},
(5.2)

142
Chapter 5. Hybrid Multi-user Detection for SDMA-OFDM Systems
where Mc denotes the set containing the 2m number of legitimate complex constellation points
associated with the speciﬁc modulation scheme employed. Explicitly, the number of metric evaluations
required for detecting the optimum vector increases exponentially with the number of users L.
Furthermore, the optimum ML-based decision metric of Equation (5.1) may also be used in the
GA-based MUD to detect the estimated transmitted symbol vector ˆsGA. In the context of the SDMA-
OFDM system employing P receiver antenna elements, the decision metric required for the pth receiver
antenna, namely the antenna-speciﬁc objective function (OF) [38] can be derived from Equation (5.1),
yielding
Ωp(ˇs) = |xp −Hpˇs|2,
(5.3)
where xp is the received symbol at the input of the pth receiver at a speciﬁc OFDM subcarrier, while Hp
is the pth row of the channel transfer function matrix H. Therefore the decision rule for the optimum
MUD associated with the pth antenna is to choose the speciﬁc L-symbol vector ˇs which minimizes the
metric given in Equation (5.3). Thus, the estimated transmitted symbol vector of the L users based on
knowledge of the received signal at the pth receiver antenna and a speciﬁc subcarrier is given by
ˆsGAp = arg

min
ˇs [Ωp(ˇs)]

.
(5.4)
However, it transpires from the above derivation that we will have P metrics in total for the P
receiver antennas. Since the CIRs of each of the P antennas are statistically independent, the L-symbol
vector that is considered optimum at antenna 1 may not be considered optimum at antenna 2 etc. In
other words, this implies that a decision conﬂict is encountered, which may be expressed as
arg

min
ˇs [Ωi(ˇs)]

= ˆsGAi ̸= ˆsGAj = arg

min
ˇs [Ωj(ˇs)]

,
(5.5)
where ∀i, j ∈{1, . . . , P }, i ̸= j. This decision conﬂict therefore leads to a so-called multi-objective
optimization problem, since the optimization of the P metrics may result in more than one possible
L-symbol solution. A similar decision conﬂict resolution problem was studied in [463] in an attempt to
reconcile the decision conﬂicts of multiple antennas resulting in a decision dilemma. In order to resolve
this problem we can adopt a similar approach and amalgamate the P antenna-speciﬁc L-symbol metrics
into a joint metric as follows:
Ω(ˇs) =
P

p=1
Ωp(ˇs).
(5.6)
Hence, the decision rule of the GA MUD is to ﬁnd the speciﬁc estimated transmitted L-symbol vector
ˆsGA that minimizes Ω(s) in Equation (5.6) for every OFDM subcarrier considered.
5.2.2.2
Concatenated MMSE-GA MUD
The BER performance of the MMSE MUD is somewhat limited, since it is the total mean square
estimation error imposed by the different simultaneous users that is minimized, rather than directly
optimizing the BER performance. Therefore, the MMSE-SDMA-OFDM system’s BER performance
may be potentially further improved with the aid of a concatenated GA-aided MUD, which is capable
of exploiting the output provided by the MMSE MUD of Section 4.2.2.1 in its initial population. For the
sake of brevity, we will portray the philosophy of the proposed system in as simple terms as possible.
However, readers who are unfamiliar with GAs might like to consult Appendix A.1 for a rudimentary
introduction to GA-based optimization in the context of multi-user SDMA-OFDM systems.
The GA invoked in the SDMA-OFDM system commences its search for the optimum L-symbol
solution at the initial generation with the aid of the MMSE combiner. In other words, using GA
parlance, the so-called individuals of the y = 1st generation having a population size of X are created
from the estimated length-L transmitted symbol vector provided by the MMSE combiner, where the
xth (x = 1, . . . , X) individual is expressed as ˜s(y,x) = [˜s(1)
(y,x), ˜s(2)
(y,x), . . . , ˜s(L)
(y,x)] , and we have

5.2.2. MMSE-GA-concatenated MUD
143
˜s(l)
(y,x) ∈Mc (l = 1, . . . , L). Note that here a complex symbol representation of the individuals
is employed, which is derived from the classic binary encoding technique [38], where a binary vector
constituted by binary zeros and ones is used to represent an individual. Then the GA-based optimization
selects some of the L-symbol candidates from a total of X legitimate individuals in order to create a
so-called mating pool of a number T of L-symbol parent vectors [38]. Two L-symbol parent vectors are
then combined using speciﬁc GA operations to create two L-symbol offspring [38] and this ‘genetic-
evolution-like’ process of generating new L-symbol offspring continues over a number Y of consecutive
generations, so that the optimum L-symbol solution may be found.
The selection of the L-symbol individuals for creating the mating pool containing a number T
of L-symbol parents is vital in determining the GA’s achievable quality of optimization [464]. In our
research the individual selection strategy based on the concept of the so-called Pareto-Optimality [328]
was employed. This strategy favours the so-called non-dominated individuals and ignores the so-
called dominated individuals [38]. More speciﬁcally, the uth L-symbol individual is considered to be
dominated by the vth individual, if we have [465]
∀i ∈{1, . . . , P } : Ωi(˜s(y,v)) ≤Ωi(˜s(y,u))
∧∃j ∈{1, . . . , P } : Ωj(˜s(y,v)) < Ωj(˜s(y,u)).
(5.7)
If an individual is not dominated in the sense of Equation (5.7) by any other individuals in the
population, then it is considered to be non-dominated. All the non-dominated individuals are then
selected and placed in the mating pool, which will have a size of 2 < T ≤X [38]. Two of the number
T of L-symbol individuals in the mating pool are then selected as parents based on their corresponding
diversity-based ﬁtness values calculated with the aid of Equation (5.6) according to the so-called ﬁtness-
proportionate selection scheme [38], which is described as follows. Firstly, the so-called windowing-
mapping [458] technique is invoked in order to get the ﬁtness value f(y,x) associated with the xth
individual, which is given by
f(y,x) = Ωy,T −Ω(˜s(y,x)) + c,
(5.8)
where
Ωy,T =
max
t∈{1,...,T }{Ω(˜s(y,t))}
(5.9)
is the maximum Objective Score (OS)2 achieved by evaluating the T individuals in the mating pool at
the yth generation, and c is a small positive constant, which is used to ensure the positiveness of f(y,x).
Then the ﬁtness-proportionate selection probability px of the xth individual can be formulated as
px =
f(y,x)
T
t=1 f(y,t)
.
(5.10)
When two L-symbol parents are selected, the so-called uniform cross-over, mutation and elitism
operations [38] are invoked for offering a chance of evolving the parents’ one or more element symbols
to other symbols of the set Mc, resulting in two offspring. The above operation is repeated until a
new population consisting of X offspring is created. Furthermore, the so-called incest prevention [38]
technique was invoked during the selection process, which only allows different individuals to be
selected for the cross-over operation. Finally, the GA terminates after Y generations and thus the L-
symbol individual having the highest diversity-based ﬁtness value will be considered as the detected
L-user transmitted symbol vector corresponding to the speciﬁc OFDM subcarrier considered.
From the above arguments, we note that in the GA MUD the different users’ signals are jointly
detected. This mechanism is different from that of the SIC or PIC MUDs, where each user’s estimated
transmitted signal is inferred by removing the interference imposed by the others. Therefore, there is no
error propagation between the different users’ signal detections in the GA MUD.
2Note that the individual having the maximum OS out of the pool of the T candidates is considered as the worst solution in the
context of the current mating pool, since the GA searches for the optimum solution which minimizes Equation (5.6).

Simulation Results
In this section, we characterize the performance of the proposed TTCM-assisted SDMA-OFDM system
using the concatenated MMSE-GA MUD. The channel is assumed to be ‘OFDM symbol invariant’,
implying that the taps of the impulse response are assumed to be constant for the duration of one
OFDM symbol, but are faded at the beginning of each OFDM symbol [3]. The simulation results
were obtained using a 4-QAM scheme communicating over the SWATM CIR of Figure 3.32, assuming
that the channels’ transfer functions are perfectly known. Each of the paths experiences independent
Rayleigh fading having the same normalized Doppler frequencies of f ′
d = 1.235 × 10−5. The OFDM
modem employed K = 512 subcarriers and a cyclic preﬁx of 64 samples, which is longer than the
maximum channel delay spread. For the iterative TTCM scheme [314] employed, the code memory
ν is ﬁxed to 3, while the number of iterations is set to 4. Hence the total number of trellis states is
23 · 4 · 2 = 64, since there are two eight-state decoders which are invoked in four iterations. The
generator polynomial expressed in octal format for the TTCM scheme considered is [13
6], while the
codeword length and channel interleaver depth are ﬁxed at 1024 symbols. The various techniques and
parameters used in our simulations discussed in this section are summarized in Table 5.1.
The BER performance of the TTCM-assisted MMSE-GA-SDMA-OFDM system employing a 4-
QAM scheme for transmission over the SWATM channel, where six users are supported with the aid
of six receiver antenna elements, is portrayed in Figure 5.2. The performance of the TTCM-assisted
MMSE-detected SDMA-OFDM system, the TTCM-aided optimum ML-detected system, and the
uncoded single-user scheme employing either a single receiver or invoking Maximum Ratio Combining
(MRC) when communicating over an AWGN channel, are also provided for reference, respectively. The
numbers in brackets seen in the legends of Figure 5.2 represent the total GA or ML complexity.3 It is
observed from Figure 5.2 that the BER performance of the TTCM-assisted MMSE-SDMA-OFDM

system was signiﬁcantly improved with the aid of the GA, having a sufﬁciently large population
size X and/or a larger number of generations Y . This improvement was achieved because a larger
population may contain a higher variety of L-symbol individuals, and, similarly, a larger number of
generations imply that, again, a more diverse set of individuals may be evaluated, thus extending the
GA’s search space, which may be expected to increase the chance of ﬁnding a lower-BER solution. On
the other hand, it can be observed that when we have the same total number of (X × Y ) correlation
metric evaluations according to Equation (5.3), the performance improvement achieved by increasing
the population size X was more substantial than that achieved by increasing the Y generations. For
example, when we have X × Y = 100, the GA-assisted scheme employing a population size X = 20
and Y = 5 generations achieved about 1.5 dB Eb/N0 gain over its corresponding counterpart that
has X = 10 and Y = 10, as evidenced by Figure 5.2. This may suggest that, in the TTCM-assisted
MMSE-SDMA-OFDM system investigated, the GA’s convergence speed tends to be faster when we
have a larger population size X instead of a higher number of generations Y . However, when the
affordable complexity increases, the improvement achieved by a larger-population GA at a certain value
of (X×Y ) becomes modest. For instance, given the maximum affordable complexity of X×Y = 400,
the system associated with X = 80 and Y = 5 brought about a modest Eb/N0 improvement of 0.25 dB
over the system associated with X = 40 and Y = 10, as shown in Figure 5.2. This is because most of
the achievable performance gain of the system is likely to have been attained.
Figure 5.3 shows the performance achieved by the proposed TTCM-MMSE-GA-SDMA-OFDM
system in the scenario where the number of supported users and receiver antenna elements was
increased to eight. As shown in Figure 5.3, again, the TTCM-aided MMSE-SDMA-OFDM system’s
performance was signiﬁcantly improved by employing the GA. We can also note that at a speciﬁc
computational complexity, the Eb/N0 gain achieved by the GA MUD was decreased, when compared
with that attained in the six-user, six-receiver scenario of Figure 5.2. For example, when we have
X = Y
= 10 and L = P = 6, the Eb/N0 gain achieved by the TTCM-MMSE-GA-SDMA-
OFDM system over the TTCM-MMSE-SDMA-OFDM system was about 3 dB, as seen in Figure 5.2.
By contrast, Figure 5.3 shows that this gain decreased to about 1.8 dB when we used the same GA

and L = P = 8. This phenomenon may be explained as follows. On the one hand, when the number
of users increases, the separation of the different users’ signal becomes more challenging, since the
interference imposed by the undesired users becomes stronger. Therefore, a higher-complexity GA
MUD has to be employed if we aim at maintaining the same Eb/N0 gain achieved by the system
having a lower user load. On the other hand, when we have more receiver antenna elements installed at
the BS, i.e. when using a ‘higher-order’ SDMA system, a higher spatial diversity gain may be achieved.
Hence, in a ‘higher-order’ SDMA system, a higher probability of achieving the total attainable gain may
be expected than in a ‘lower-order’ SDMA system, potentially approaching the best possible AWGN
performance. Hence, this trend also results in a less signiﬁcant GA-induced performance gain.
Furthermore, it can be seen in Figures 5.2 and 5.3 that the MMSE-GA-detected TTCM-SDMA-
OFDM system was slightly outperformed by its optimum ML-detected counterpart, since the GAs are
unable to guarantee that the optimum ML solution would be found [38]. However, the near-optimum
performance of the GA-aided TTCM-SDMA-OFDM system was achieved at a signiﬁcantly lower
computational complexity than that imposed by the ML-aided system, as will be demonstrated in
Section 5.2.4.
5.2.4
Complexity Analysis
In this section, an analysis of the associated computational complexity imposed by the optimum ML
MUD-aided SDMA-OFDM system and the GA-aided MMSE-SDMA-OFDM system will be presented.
For the sake of simplicity, we only compare the optimum ML MUD’s complexity with that of the
GA MUD, since the simple MMSE MUD is used for providing a single initial solution for the GA’s
initial population and imposes a signiﬁcantly lower complexity than that of its concatenated GA-
aided counterpart. More speciﬁcally, since the proposed GA-aided MUD optimizes the metric of
Equation (5.3),4 we will quantify the complexity imposed in terms of the number of metric computations
required by the optimization process.
4Similarly, the ML-aided MUD optimizes the metric of Equation (5.1), from which Equation (5.3) is derived.

Figure 5.4: Performance comparison of the MUD complexity in terms of the number of metric
evaluations versus the number of users for the 4-QAM TTCM-MMSE-GA-SDMA-OFDM and TTCM-
ML-SDMA-OFDM systems. The number of receiver antenna elements employed is equivalent to the
number of users supported, i.e. L = P .
As mentioned in Section 5.2.2.1, for the ML MUD, 2mL metric computations have to be carried out
to ﬁnd the optimum solution [3], namely the most likely transmitted L-user vector, where m denotes the
number of bits per symbol. By contrast, our proposed GA MUD requires a maximum of (X×Y ) metric
evaluations, since a number X of L-symbol vectors are evaluated during each of the Y generations,
as shown in brackets in the legends of Figures 5.2 and 5.3. Furthermore, the number of such metric
evaluations may readily be reduced by avoiding repeated evaluations of identical individuals, either
within the same generation or across the entire iterative process, provided that the receiver has the
necessary memory for storing the corresponding evaluation history. In Figure 5.4, we compare both the
ML- and the GA-aided schemes in terms of their complexity, i.e. the number of metric computations. At
a speciﬁc user load, we always select an appropriate GA-aided scheme for comparison, which suffers
from less than 1 dB Eb/N0 loss at the BER of 10−5 compared with the ML-aided system. As shown
in Figure 5.4, the ML-aided system imposes an exponentially increasing complexity of the order of
O(2mL), when the number of users increases, while the complexity of the GA-aided system required
for maintaining a near-optimum performance increases only slowly.
5.2.5
Conclusions
From the investigations conducted, we conclude that the GA-assisted TTCM-aided MMSE-SDMA-
OFDM system is capable of achieving a similar performance to that of the optimum ML-assisted
TTCM-SDMA-OFDM system. Furthermore, this is attained at a signiﬁcantly lower computational
complexity than that imposed by the ML-assisted system, especially when the number of users is high.
For example, a complexity reduction in excess of a factor of 100 can be achieved by the proposed
system for L = P = 8, as evidenced by Figure 5.4.

Enhanced GA-based MUD
In Section 5.2, we presented a detailed characterization of the concatenated MMSE-GA MUD designed
for the TTCM-assisted multi-user SDMA-OFDM system. In this section, an enhanced GA-based MUD
will be introduced, which is capable of further improving the proposed system’s performance.
As discussed in Section 5.2, the proposed MMSE-GA-assisted TTCM-SDMA-OFDM system
achieves a close-to-optimum performance at a signiﬁcantly lower computational complexity than its
optimum ML-assisted counterpart. Moreover, the GA-aided system can be further improved in each or
both of the following aspects:
• By optimizing the component(s) of the GA MUD to ﬁnd a better conﬁguration that may improve
the GA’s performance in the context of the SDMA-OFDM system.
• By invoking an iterative detection framework so that the system’s performance may be improved
iteration by iteration.
In the following sections we will discuss the techniques that may be applied in terms of the above-
mentioned two aspects for achieving an improved system performance.
5.3.1
Improved Mutation Scheme
In the context of GA-based detection techniques, the efﬁciency of the mutation scheme employed
is important for the success of the entire evolutionary procedure, since it provides a chance for the
individuals of the current population to inﬂuence the forthcoming ones, so that new areas of the total
search space may be explored and thus the chance of ﬁnding the optimum solution increases [466]. An
efﬁcient mutation scheme is expected to be capable of guiding the search process in the correct direction
to ﬁnd the global optimum, rather than the local ones. In the context of the GA-assisted multi-user
SDMA-OFDM system, when the number of users L increases or a high-throughput modulation scheme
is used, the total search space consisting of 2mL L-user symbol vectors would become excessive. In
such cases, the role of mutation may become vital for the success of the overall system, since the GA
may get trapped in local optima without appropriate assistance from the mutation scheme.
In Section 5.3.1.1, we will ﬁrst discuss a widely used conventional mutation scheme as well as its
drawbacks, followed by the introduction of an improved new mutation mechanism in Section 5.3.1.2.
5.3.1.1
Conventional Uniform Mutation
In Section 5.2.3, M-ary mutation was employed by the GA MUD. More speciﬁcally, each gene ˆs(l) (l =
1, . . . , L) of a length-L GA individual ˆs in the X-element population is represented by a speciﬁc
symbol in Mc, where Mc is the set containing the 2m legitimate constellation points. In other words,
the lth gene denotes the lth user’s estimated transmitted symbol – which is a hard-decoded version of the
complex signal – at the subcarrier considered. During the genetic evolution, when a gene is subjected
to mutation it will be substituted by a different symbol in Mc based on a uniform mutation-induced
transition probability p(ij)
mt ,5 which quantiﬁes the probability of the ith legitimate symbol becoming
the jth. For the sake of brevity, from now on we refer to this probability as the transition probability.
Furthermore, we will refer to the mutation scheme employing uniformly distributed p(ij)
mt values as
Uniform Mutation (UM), which is a widely used conventional mutation scheme known in the literature
and was also employed by the GAs invoked in [38].
More speciﬁcally, UM mutates to all the candidate symbols in Mc with the same probability. For
example, let us consider the 4-QAM modem constellation shown in Figure 5.5, where ˆs(l)
i
∈Mc (i =
1, . . . , 4) are the constellation points as well as possible gene candidates for the lth user at a speciﬁc
5Note that the mutation probability pm of Table 5.1 is different from the probability p(ij )
mt
of mutating to a speciﬁc symbol in
Mc. The former denotes the probability of how likely it is that a gene will mutate, while the latter speciﬁes how likely it is that a
speciﬁc symbol in Mc becomes the mutated gene.

mt ),
i, j ∈{1, . . . , 4}, i ̸= j.
(5.11)
For the UM scheme, the transition probability p(ij)
mt = 1/(2m −1) is equal for all i, j ∈{1, . . . , 4},
i ̸= j.
Based on the mechanism of UM, the GA has a chance of successfully identifying the actually
transmitted symbol of the lth user at the subcarrier considered. However, UM has a drawback that may
prevent the GA from rapid convergence under certain conditions. To explain this further, let us again
consider the example of Figure 5.5. Without loss of generality, we can make the following assumptions:
(a) ˆs(l)
1
is the received symbol, which is the original gene to be mutated; and
(b) ˆs(l)
1
is not the transmitted symbol.
Hence, the task of mutation is to ﬁnd the actually transmitted symbol from the set of three candidates,
namely ˆs(l)
i
(i = 2, . . . , 4). According to UM, the probability that ˆs(l)
1 hops to ˆs(l)
2 , ˆs(l)
3 or ˆs(l)
4 is equal.
In other words, in this case the chance of ﬁnding the true transmitted symbol of the speciﬁc user during
a single UM operation is 1/3. However, this ﬁxed uniform transition probability fails to reﬂect the
realistic channel condition that the system is subjected to. More precisely, at different Signal-to-Noise
Ratio (SNR) levels, some symbols in Mc should not constitute high-probability mutation targets. For
example, at high SNRs, the chances are that ˆs(l)
2
or ˆs(l)
3
is more likely to be the transmitted symbol,
rather than ˆs(l)
4 , since the noise effects are insigniﬁcant and thus the signal corruption from the most
distant symbol ˆs(l)
4
to the received symbol ˆs(l)
1
is rare. Hence, it may be more reasonable to consider
ˆs(l)
2
and ˆs(l)
3
only as the potential mutation candidates, and assign a modiﬁed transition probability
p(1j)
mt
= 0.5 (j ∈{2, 3}). This fact implies that at different SNR levels we may restrict the effective GA
search space with the aid of a biased mutation, which ignores the constellation points that are far from
the received symbol. This is especially beneﬁcial for the system employing high-throughput modulation
schemes such as 16-QAM, where the total search space is exponentially expanded as a function of the
number of BPS compared with lower-throughput modems. In such a system, the UM-aided GA which
allows mutation to all legitimate symbols may suffer from a slow convergence speed and might result in
a high residual error ﬂoor, since a considerable portion of the GA’s searching power may be wasted on
mutating to highly unlikely gene candidates, especially in high-SNR scenarios. By contrast, the above-
mentioned biased mutation-guided GA is expected to achieve a better performance, since it searches for
the optimum solution in a more efﬁcient way, as will be demonstrated in Section 5.3.1.2.
5.3.1.2
Biased Q-function-Based Mutation
The conventional UM and its drawbacks were discussed in Section 5.3.1.1. In this section, an improved
novel mutation scheme will be presented, which we will refer to as Biased Q-function-based Mutation
(BQM).

5.3.1.2.1
Theoretical Foundations
As discussed in Section 5.3.1.1, for an original gene to be mutated, an SNR-related biased transition
probability p(ij )
mt has to be assigned to each of the target candidate symbols in Mc. The calculation of
p(ij )
mt may be carried out with the aid of the widely known Q-function [467]:
Q(x) =

(5.12)
For the sake of easy explanation, let us ﬁrst consider a simple One-Dimensional (1D) scenario. In
Figure 5.6 we plotted the 1D real component of the constellation symbols ˆs(l)
i
in the context of the
4-QAM modem constellation seen in Figure 5.5. The horizontal axis is then divided into two zones,
each of which represents one speciﬁc 1D constellation symbol sRi (i = 1, . . . , 2), as separated by the
vertical dashed line of Figure 5.6. If sR1 is the original gene to be mutated, the Gaussian distribution
N(0, σ) may be centred at the position of sR1, where σ is the noise variance at a given SNR level. In
this speciﬁc example, sR2 is the only mutation target and the 1D transition probability of mutating from
sR1 to sR2, i.e. p(12)
mt , is characterized by the shadow area shown in Figure 5.6, which is given by
p(12)

where d0 is half of the distance between the neighbouring constellation symbols. Similarly, we have

Furthermore, we also have a certain probability for the original gene to remain unchanged, which can
also be expressed in terms of the Gaussian distribution as

The above-mentioned 1D transition probabilities are summarized in Table 5.2. The corresponding
Two-Dimensional (2D) symbol transition probability p(ij)
mt can be derived by combining the 1D real
and imaginary transition probabilities.6. Let us again consider the 4-QAM modem of Figure 5.5 as an
example, which is replotted in Figure 5.7. In Figure 5.7, for instance, the 2D transition probability of
mutating from the constellation symbol ˆs(l)
1
to ˆs(l)
2 , namely p(12)
mt , can be calculated by multiplying the

For higher-throughput modems, e.g. for 16-QAM and 64-QAM, the same algorithm can be
invoked for calculating the corresponding 1D and 2D transition probabilities. In Figure 5.8 an example
associated with 16-QAM is provided. According to Figure 5.8, assuming that sR1 is the original gene
to be mutated, while sR2 is the mutation target, we have the following 1D transition probability of

Similarly, we can derive the remaining 1D transition probabilities for 16-QAM, which are summarized
in Table 5.3. For the sake of brevity, we omit here the derivation of the corresponding 2D transition
probabilities. Note that the proposed BQM scheme can be readily extended to M-Dimensional (MD)
constellations, since the MD transition probability associated with a speciﬁc MD symbol can be readily
derived upon multiplying the M corresponding 1D transition probabilities.
However, when a mutation takes place during the evolution, the mutating gene or constellation
symbol should not be allowed to be mutated to itself. Hence, the effect of the probability of mutating a
symbol to itself should be removed. This can be achieved by normalizing the 2D transition probability

5.3.1.2.2
Simpliﬁed BQM
In Section 5.3.1.2.1 we provided a detailed explanation of the mechanism of BQM. Furthermore, the
proposed BQM scheme can be effectively simpliﬁed when only a subset of all the theoretically possible
mutation target symbols is considered. More precisely, for the original gene subjected to mutation,
we may only consider its adjacent neighbouring constellation symbols as mutation target candidates,
since the original transmitted symbol is less unlikely to be corrupted to a relatively distant constellation
symbol.
An example of the simpliﬁed BQM designed for 16-QAM is provided in Figure 5.9. As shown in
Figure 5.9, for example, we assume that ˆs(l)
1
is the original gene subjected to mutation, and ˆs(l)
i
(i =
2, . . . , 9) represents the adjacent neighbours of ˆs(l)
1 , while the symbols represented by the dashed circles
are ignored. Therefore, the GA’s entire search space is reduced. Moreover, the search space can be
further compressed when we consider only the nearest neighbours of ˆs(l)
1 . In this case, only the symbols
ˆs(l)
i
(i = 3, 5, 6, 8) printed in grey in Figure 5.9 will be regarded as legitimate mutation candidates, each
of which is assigned an equal 2D transition probability p(1j)
mt
= 1/4 (j = 3, 5, 6, 8), while all other
constellation symbols printed in white are neglected. Since the transition probability for each selected
mutation candidate is equally ﬁxed, the BQM scheme is simpliﬁed to a scheme similar to UM, which
we may refer to as the Closest-Neighbour Uniform Mutation (CNUM) scheme. Note that, similar to
the scenario of BQM, in CNUM the corresponding transition probability value is also dependent on the

location of the original gene. For instance, if the original gene is located in one of the four corners of the
constellation map plotted in Figure 5.9, the relevant transition probability p(ij)
mt becomes 1/2, since in
this case only two nearest-neighbour symbols exist. The CNUM-related transition probability values of
the different modems are summarized in Table 5.4. Hence, by introducing the simpliﬁed BQM scheme
or the CNUM arrangement, the computational complexity of BQM can be reduced. This issue will be
discussed in Section 5.3.3.

Simulation Results
In this section, we provide our simulation results characterizing the achievable performance of the
TTCM-assisted MMSE-GA-SDMA-OFDM system employing UM or BQM. For the BQM-based
schemes, all the parameters used, including the TTCM-, GA- and channel-related ones, are the same
as those speciﬁed in Table 5.1, except that the UM component was substituted by the BQM in the
GA MUD.

detected system, and the uncoded single-user scheme employing either a single receiver or invoking
MRC when communicating over an AWGN channel, are also provided for reference, respectively. As
expected, we can see from Figure 5.10 that the BER performance of the TTCM-assisted MMSE-SDMA-
OFDM system was further improved at relatively higher SNRs, when BQM rather than UM was used.
Furthermore, a higher performance improvement can be achieved by the BQM-aided scheme when
we have a higher user load or higher throughput, as seen in Figure 5.11. More speciﬁcally, the left-hand
side of Figure 5.11 shows the simulation results attained in the scenario, where a higher number of
L = 10 users are supported. In this case, an Eb/N0 gain of about 1 dB was attained by the employment
of BQM for a GA having a size of X = 20 and Y = 5 at the BER of 10−5. This Eb/N0 gain
was achieved because a higher user load results in a larger search space and hence the conventional
UM suffers more from its inefﬁcient mutation mechanism, while BQM may more readily be able to
guide the mutation in the desirable direction even at low SNRs, especially in the scenarios having
higher user loads. On the other hand, when a high-throughput modem such as for example 16-QAM is
employed, BQM may signiﬁcantly outperform UM, as evidenced on the right-hand side of Figure 5.11.
As seen in the ﬁgure, the UM-aided scheme yielded a high residual error ﬂoor, since the GA apparently
settled in local minima during its search owing to the less efﬁcient mutation strategy. By contrast,
BQM signiﬁcantly improved the GA’s performance by lowering the error ﬂoor by about two orders
of magnitude to the BER of 10−5. Note that at SNRs higher than 20 dB, however, a cross-over point
appeared on the curves, where a GA having X = 160 and Y = 5 could no longer improve the
MMSE-aided system’s performance when the SNR was increased. The reason for encountering this
phenomenon at a high SNR level is that it becomes more difﬁcult for a moderate-complexity GA
to mitigate the associated symbol errors among the increased number of the 16-QAM constellation
symbols, in comparison with the 4-QAM constellation symbols. Hence, to improve the attainable
performance of systems employing high-throughput modems, we may either use a more complex GA,
which is less attractive for complexity-sensitive systems, or invoke an improved MUD framework, as
will be discussed in Section 5.3.2.

5.3.1.3.2
BQM Versus CNUM
As discussed in Section 5.3.1.2.2, the BQM scheme may be simpliﬁed to the CNUM arrangement,
which mutates to only one of the closest neighbours of the original gene, thus incurring a lower
complexity in comparison with BQM. However, CNUM does not necessarily degrade the system’s
performance dramatically. Figure 5.12 provides a comparison of CNUM and BQM for both low- and
high-throughput systems. As observed in Figure 5.12, the BQM-GA-assisted system achieved a slightly
better performance than its CNUM-GA-assisted counterpart. This may suggest that in such scenarios
the CNUM scheme may become an attractive alternative to the BQM scheme for further decreasing the
complexity imposed.
5.3.2
Iterative MUD Framework
In Section 5.3.1, we presented an enhanced mutation scheme, namely BQM, which is capable of
improving the GA MUD’s performance, especially in systems having high user loads and/or employing
high-throughput modems. This may be regarded as GA-related improvement in the context of the GA
MUD. In this section, we will focus our attention on an enhanced iterative MUD framework, so that the
system’s performance may be further improved in all the scenarios considered so far.
5.3.2.1
MMSE-Initialized Iterative GA MUD
In the literature, iterative techniques such as SIC [197, 439–441] and PIC [439, 441, 442] have been
designed for multi-user OFDM systems. Following the philosophy of iterative detections, we propose an
MMSE-initialized Iterative GA (IGA) MUD for multi-user SDMA-OFDM systems. Figure 5.13 shows
the proposed IGA MUD-assisted multi-user SDMA-OFDM uplink system. On comparing Figure 5.1
and Figure 5.13, we can see that the concatenated MMSE-GA MUD used in the BS of Figure 5.1 is
replaced by the MMSE-assisted IGA MUD seen in the middle–bottom part of Figure 5.13, while the
detailed structure of the IGA MUD is outlined in Figure 5.14. More speciﬁcally, the received length-P

SDMA-OFDM system using CNUM or BQM, while employing a 4-QAM or 16-QAM scheme for
transmission over the SWATM channel, where L = 6 users are supported with the aid of P = 6
receiver antenna elements, respectively. The basic simulation parameters are given in Table 5.1.
symbol vector x of Equation (4.2) is ﬁrst detected by the MMSE MUD, which outputs the L MMSE-
detected symbols ˆs(l)
MMSE (l = 1, . . . , L) of the L users, and forwards them to L independent TTCM
decoders. The TTCM-decoded L-symbol vector, which is more reliable than the MMSE MUD’s output,
is then fed into the concatenated GA MUD to assist in the creation of the initial population. Then the
genetically enhanced output symbol vector ˆsGA, which may be expected to become more reliable, will
be fed back to the TTCM decoders in order to improve further the signal’s quality, invoking a number
of iterations. Following the last iteration, the ﬁnal GA solution will be decoded by the TTCM decoders,
and the hard-decision version of the estimated information bits of the L independent users is forwarded
to the output, which is only enabled at the ﬁnal iteration by the switch seen in Figure 5.14.
Therefore, two improvements have been achieved by the MMSE-IGA MUD. Firstly, more accurate
initial knowledge of the transmitted signals, i.e. the output of the TTCM decoders rather than that of the
MMSE MUD, is supplied for the GA MUD. This reliable improvement therefore offers a better starting
point for the GA’s search. Secondly, the iterative processing ensures that the detected L-user symbol
vector can be optimized in two dimensions, as demonstrated in Figure 5.15. During every iteration,
on the one hand, each L-symbol vector at a speciﬁed subcarrier slot is optimized by the GA in the
context of the user domain. On the other hand, the entire TTCM-coded frame of each user is optimized
by the TTCM decoder in the context of the TTCM-related codeword domain, or more speciﬁcally
the frequency domain. Hence, as the iterative processing continues, an information exchange takes
place between the two domains, resulting in a 2D optimization which may be expected to improve the
system’s performance.
5.3.2.2
Simulation Results
In this section, we combine the IGA MUD with BQM, which was presented in Section 5.3.1.2, and
compare the associated simulation results with our previous results. Note that for the sake of fairness,
we have halved the number of TTCM decoding iterations for the IGA-aided scheme, so that the
total TTCM-related complexity remains approximately the same as in the non-iterative system. For

to the number of receiver antennas P.

receiver antenna elements, respectively. The basic simulation parameters are given in Table 5.5.
5.3.2.2.1.1
BQM-IGA Performance
Figure 5.16 shows the BER performance achieved by the various schemes considered. The numbers in
brackets seen in the legends of Figure 5.16 denote the associated number of IGA MUD iterations and
the total GA or ML complexity, respectively. From the results of Figure 5.16 two conclusions may be
derived. Firstly, an improved performance can be achieved when the GA commences its operation from
a better initial population, regardless of the different mutation schemes used. For example, at the same
GA complexity, the single-iteration IGA MUD-assisted systems outperformed their non-iterative GA-
aided counterparts, since the initial GA populations of the former systems were created based on the
ﬁrst-iteration outputs of the TTCM decoders, rather than on the less reliable MMSE MUD, regardless
of whether UM or BQM was employed.
Secondly, the system employing the BQM-aided two-iteration IGA MUD was capable of achieving
the same performance as the optimum ML-aided system at an even lower complexity compared with
the UM- or BQM-aided non-iterative GA MUD, which was characterized in Figure 5.10. For instance,
Figure 5.16 shows that the two-iteration BQM-IGA MUD having a complexity of 200 achieved virtually
undistinguishable performance in comparison with its ML-aided counterpart, while the non-iterative
UM/BQM-GA MUD having a complexity of 400 attained a slightly inferior performance in comparison
with the ML-aided arrangement, as observed in Figure 5.10.
Having investigated the system using the 4-QAM modem, let us now consider various high-
throughput scenarios. As mentioned in Section 5.3.1.3, the non-iterative GA MUD may result in a
high residual error ﬂoor in high-throughput scenarios, even if BQM is employed. However, with the
aid of the IGA MUD, the error ﬂoor can be effectively reduced, as seen in Figure 5.17. A 16-QAM
modem was employed in all the schemes8 characterized in Figure 5.17, except for the uncoded single-
user benchmark scheme communicating over the AWGN channel, which used 8-PSK to maintain the
same effective throughput of 3 BPS as the other TTCM-coded schemes. Similar to the 4-QAM scenario
8Note that in this case the associated complexity of the ML-aided scheme is as high as order O(2mL) = O(24·6) =
O(16 777 216), which imposes excessive complexity and hence cannot be simulated.

of Figure 5.16, it can be seen in Figure 5.17 that a better initial population resulted in an improved
performance in both the UM- and BQM-aided systems. However, we ca see that even when assisted
by reliable initial knowledge of the transmitted symbols, the UM-aided single-iteration IGA MUD
was unable substantially to decrease the error ﬂoor. Even when we increased the number of UM-IGA
MUD iterations, the situation remained the same, except for the modest improvements achieved at
SNRs lower than 16 dB. By contrast, the BQM-aided scheme is capable of substantially exploiting
the beneﬁts arising from both a better initial GA population and an increased number of IGA MUD
iterations. More speciﬁcally, on the one hand, the improved initial population provides a good starting
point for the GA, thus assisting the BQM, which in turn beneﬁts the entire detection process, resulting in
a substantial performance improvement. On the other hand, the iterative processing invoked by the IGA
MUD further enhances the system’s performance with the aid of the 2D optimization, as discussed in
Section 5.3.2.1, since the beneﬁcial information exchange between the user domain and the frequency
domain assists both the GA MUD and the TTCM decoder in eliminating more and more errors found
in the received signal, as the iterative procedure continues.
5.3.2.2.1.2
Effects of the Number of IGA MUD Iterations
Figure 5.18 shows the Eb/N0 gain achieved by the BQM-IGA assisted TTCM-MMSE-SDMA-OFDM
systems employing 16-QAM at the BER of 10−5, while using different numbers of IGA MUD
iterations. The Eb/N0 gain is deﬁned here as the Eb/N0 difference measured at the BER of 10−5
between the systems employing the BQM-IGA MUD or the MMSE MUD. As expected, when there
are a higher number of IGA MUD iterations, a higher Eb/N0 gain was attained. It is also found in
Figure 5.18 that most of the achievable gain may be attained when the number of IGA MUD iterations
reaches 8. Furthermore, when the complexity of the GA MUD increases, because for example a higher
population size is employed, a higher gain can be achieved, as seen in Figure 5.18. Moreover, we
can also see that when the number of IGA MUD iterations was increased, the difference between the
Eb/N0 gains achieved by the higher-complexity and the lower-complexity IGAs tends to be larger.
For example, as observed in Figure 5.18, when we had only one IGA MUD iteration, the Eb/N0 gain

difference between the two curves was about 1 dB, while this value increased to about 3 dB when the
number of iterations was increased to 8. This suggests that a high-complexity IGA may beneﬁt more
from a higher number of IGA MUD iterations than its lower-complexity counterpart.
5.3.2.2.1.3
Effects of the User Load
Figure 5.19 exhibits the corresponding Eb/N0 gains achieved by the SDMA-OFDM system exploiting
P = 6 receiver antenna elements at the BER of 10−5 in the scenarios where the user load varies. The
user load of SDMA-OFDM systems was deﬁned by Equation (4.14) in Section 4.3.2.1.1. As observed
in Figure 5.19, ﬁrstly, it is shown that when the user load becomes higher, a higher gain can be attained.
For example, for the single-iteration IGA-aided system, a further gain of about 3.5 dB is achieved when
the number of users increases from four to six. This is because, when more users were accommodated
by the SDMA-OFDM system, the reference MMSE MUD suffered a higher performance degradation
than the IGA MUD, and thus a higher Eb/N0 gain was attained by the IGA MUD. Secondly, a higher
number of IGA MUD iterations provide a higher Eb/N0 gain for the system. For instance, in the full-
user-load scenario, i.e. for L = P = 6, the two-iteration IGA-aided system achieves a further gain
of about 2.7 dB over its single-iteration counterpart, providing an overall Eb/N0 gain of 7 dB over the
baseline TTCM-MMSE-SDMA-OFDM benchmark system dispensing with the GA MUD.
5.3.2.2.2
Performance in Overloaded Scenarios
Recall that in Section 5.1 we pointed out that in practical applications the number of users L may be
higher than that of the receiver antennas P, resulting in the overloaded scenario. However, most of
the existing MUD techniques, such as for example the MMSE algorithm of [3, 439] and the QRD-M
algorithm of [172], suffer from a signiﬁcant performance degradation in overloaded scenarios, owing
to an insufﬁcient degree of detection freedom at the receiver. By contrast, we will show in this section
that the proposed IGA MUD is capable of adequately performing in overloaded scenarios.

5.3.2.2.2.1
Overloaded BQM-IGA
Figure 5.20 shows the performance achieved by the BQM-IGA aided TTCM-SDMA-OFDM system
using 4-QAM, when six, seven and eight users are supported by six receiver antenna elements,
respectively. It can be seen in Figure 5.20 that in the so-called overloaded scenarios, where the number
of users exceeds the number of receiver antenna elements, the linear MMSE MUD suffered from an
insufﬁcient degree of freedom for separating the different users, since the high number of users incurred
excess Multi-User Interference (MUI). This results in a signiﬁcant performance degradation in the
context of the system using the MMSE MUD, when the number of users increased from six to eight, as
observed in Figure 5.20. However, in such cases the system employing the proposed BQM-IGA MUD
was still capable of maintaining a near-ML performance. For example, when L = 8, the two-iteration-
based BQM-IGA MUD reduced the BER measured at 3 dB by four orders of magnitude in comparison
with the MMSE-aided benchmark system, as evidenced by Figure 5.20. This result characterizes the
robustness of the BQM-IGA MUD, which has successfully suppressed the high MUI experienced in
overloaded scenarios.
Figure 5.21 shows the iteration gain achieved by the BQM-IGA assisted TTCM-MMSE-SDMA-
OFDM system employing 4-QAM at the BER of 10−5, while using different numbers of IGA MUD
iterations. The iteration gain is deﬁned here as the Eb/N0 difference of the systems employing different
numbers of IGA MUD iterations measured at the BER of 10−5 in comparison with the baseline system
employing a single IGA MUD iteration. It is found in Figure 5.21 that when more users are supported,
higher iteration gains may be obtained by iterative detection. For example, a gain of about 6 dB was
attained by the eight-user system at the second IGA MUD iteration, while that attained by the six-user
system was only about 0.5 dB. Furthermore, as the number of iterations was increased from two to six,
the former scheme provided a further gain of about 1 dB, while no explicit gain was achieved by the
latter arrangement, as shown in Figure 5.21. It is also seen in Figure 5.21 that most of the achievable
iteration gain has been attained at the second IGA MUD iteration for all the schemes.

BQM Versus CNUM
In Section 5.3.1.3.2, we described the performance of the CNUM arrangement discussed in Sec-
tion 5.3.1.2.2 in a fully loaded scenario. In Figure 5.22 we characterize the CNUM-aided system’s
performance achieved in an overloaded scenario, where six receiver antennas were used. As seen in
Figure 5.22, the BQM-IGA-aided system slightly outperformed the CNUM-IGA-aided system. This
suggests that, similar to the case of fully loaded scenarios, the CNUM scheme may also be employed
in overloaded scenarios for achieving a further complexity reduction over the BQM scheme without
suffering from a signiﬁcant performance loss.

Performance under Imperfect Channel Estimation
As a further investigation, we provide the simulation results generated in the scenario where the Channel
State Information (CSI) was assumed to be imperfect. The estimated CIRs ˆhi were generated by adding
random Gaussian noise to the true CIR taps hi as

without accurate channel knowledge. Moreover, it was found that when imperfect channel estimation
was assumed, the BQM-IGA-aided system outperformed its ML-aided counterpart, especially in the
scenarios associated with higher user loads. This phenomenon may be explained as follows. When
the CSI is imperfect, the ML-detected signal becomes less reliable than that detected in the scenario
beneﬁtting from perfect CSI. The relatively unreliable output of the ML MUD may readily mislead
the TTCM decoder owing to error propagation, resulting in a performance degradation. However, the
detrimental effects of imperfect CSI may be mitigated by the proposed IGA MUD. More speciﬁcally,
the IGA MUD optimizes the detected signal in two dimensions, namely in both the user domain and
the frequency domain, as discussed in Section 5.3.2.1. The beneﬁcial information exchange offered by
the IGA MUD between the two domains may effectively assist the concatenated detection–decoding
procedure in counteracting the detrimental effects of imperfect channel estimation. This therefore
results in a better system performance in comparison with that achieved by the ML-aided system.
Furthermore, when a higher number of users had to be supported, the ML-aided system using imperfect
CSI suffered more from the inaccurate MUD, while a more robust behaviour was exhibited by the
IGA-aided system, as shown in Figure 5.24.
5.3.3
Complexity Analysis
Compared with the conventional UM scheme, BQM is capable of signiﬁcantly improving the GA’s
performance, especially in high-throughput or high-SNR scenarios, as discussed in Section 5.3.1.3.1.
Furthermore, this performance improvement was achieved at the cost of a modest complexity increase
and a modest memory requirement. More speciﬁcally, at different SNR levels, for each of the 2m
constellation symbols, a speciﬁc set containing (2m −1) normalized 2D transition probabilities
has to be created. However, this only imposes a modest ‘once-for-all’ calculation, since we can
derive the associated transition probabilities with the aid of ofﬂine experiments for a number of
typical SNR levels, where the calculated data can be stored in the BS’s memory, hence incurring
no further computational complexity. Furthermore, by introducing the simpliﬁed BQM scheme of

Figure 5.24: BER versus Eb/N0 performance comparison of the TTCM-assisted MMSE-IGA-
SDMA-OFDM system using BQM with perfect or imperfect CSI, while employing a 4-QAM scheme
for transmission over the SWATM channel, where L = 6, 7, 8 users are supported with the aid of
P = 6 receiver antenna elements, respectively. The basic simulation parameters are given in Table 5.5.
Section 5.3.1.2.2, the associated complexity and memory cost may be dramatically reduced, especially
for high-throughput modems such as 16-QAM or 64-QAM, since the number of mutation target
candidates decreases and thus fewer transition probability calculations are required. Moreover, if the
CNUM scheme is employed, the associated complexity can be further decreased, since in this case there
is no need to calculate the transition probabilities, which are already available in Table 5.4. This may
signiﬁcantly reduce the associated complexity and memory requirement, while still maintaining a
similar performance to that of the BQM scheme, as seen in Figures 5.12 and 5.22.
As shown in Figures 5.18 and 5.21, the system’s performance can be further improved when the
number of IGA MUD iterations is increased. When the other parameters remain the same, using a
higher number of IGA MUD iterations will result in a further increased complexity. However, this
may still be signiﬁcantly lower than that imposed by the ML-aided scheme. Figure 5.25 provides
our comparison of the TTCM-assisted MMSE-SDMA-OFDM, ML-SDMA-OFDM and MMSE-BQM-
IGA-SDMA-OFDM systems in the context of their MUD complexity, which was quantiﬁed in terms
of the number of complex additions and multiplications imposed by the different MUDs on a per-user
basis. As illustrated in Figure 5.25, the complexity of the ML MUD is signiﬁcantly higher than that of
the MMSE MUD or the IGA MUD. Furthermore, the IGA MUD’s complexity does not signiﬁcantly
vary at different Eb/N0 values and depends on the number of IGA MUD iterations as well as on
the GA’s parameters, e.g. the population size. In Figure 5.26 the complexity of the various systems
is compared in terms of different user loads at an Eb/N0 value of 0 dB. At a speciﬁc user load, we
always select an appropriate GA-aided scheme for comparison, which achieved a similar performance
compared with the ML-aided system at the BER of 10−5. As seen in Figure 5.26, the ML-aided system
imposes a linearly increasing complexity on a logarithmic scale, which corresponds to an exponential
increase when the number of users increases. By contrast, the complexity of the IGA-aided system
required for maintaining a near-optimum performance increases only moderately.
In order to characterize the advantage of the BQM-IGA scheme in terms of the performance–
complexity trade-off, we summarize in Table 5.6 the computational complexity imposed by the different
MUDs assuming an Eb/N0 value of 3 dB. As observed in Table 5.6, the complexity of the ML MUD

Conclusions
In Sections 5.3.1 and 5.3.2 we proposed speciﬁc techniques designed for further enhancing the
achievable performance of the TTCM-assisted MMSE-GA-SDMA-OFDM system. The novel BQM
scheme is capable of improving the GA’s search at a modest complexity increase, thus signiﬁcantly
increasing the chances of ﬁnding the optimum GA solution in high-SNR and/or high-throughput
scenarios. On the other hand, the 2D optimization provided by the proposed IGA MUD has been shown
to be beneﬁcial for the SDMA-OFDM system in both the frequency and user domains. Finally, the
scheme that combines BQM with the IGA MUD yields the best and near-optimum performance in all
scenarios considered, including the so-called overloaded scenario, where the performance of most of the
conventional detection techniques such as the classic linear MMSE MUD signiﬁcantly degrades, owing
to the insufﬁciently high degree of freedom. Furthermore, this superior performance of the proposed
scheme is achieved at a signiﬁcantly lower computational complexity than that imposed by the ML-
assisted system, especially when the number of users is high. For example, a complexity reduction of
three orders of magnitude can be achieved by the proposed BQM-IGA-aided system in the overloaded
scenario associated with L = 8, as evidenced by Figure 5.26. Moreover, we demonstrate that the
proposed scheme is capable of providing a satisfactory performance even when the channel estimation
is imperfect.

Chapter Summary
In this chapter, we proposed a TTCM-assisted MMSE-GA MUD designed for SDMA-OFDM systems.
In Section 5.2.1 we provided a system overview of the proposed GA-assisted TTCM-MMSE-SDMA-
OFDM system. The optimization metric designed for the proposed GA MUD was described in
Section 5.2.2.1. Section 5.2.2.2 outlined the concatenated MMSE-GA MUD, while its performance
was evaluated in Section 5.2.3, where the GA-based schemes were shown to be capable of achieving
a near-optimum performance. Furthermore, a complexity comparison between the proposed GA MUD
and the optimum ML MUD was provided in Section 5.2.4, where we showed that the complexity of the
GA MUD was signiﬁcantly lower than that of the ML MUD.

5.4. Chapter Summary
169
To improve further improve the performance of the TTCM-assisted MMSE-GA-SDMA-OFDM
system, an enhanced GA MUD was proposed in Section 5.3. This was described in two steps. Firstly, the
novel BQM scheme was proposed in Section 5.3.1, including a review of the conventional UM scheme,
followed by a detailed explanation of the BQM mechanism, which were the subjects of Sections 5.3.1.1
and 5.3.1.2, respectively. The BQM-aided GA MUD exploits an effective mutation strategy and thus is
capable of achieving a better performance in comparison with its UM-aided counterpart, especially
at high SNRs or high user loads, as evidenced by the simulation results given in Section 5.3.1.3.
Moreover, this was achieved at a modest complexity increase. Secondly, an MMSE-initialized IGA
MUD was introduced in Section 5.3.2. The theoretical foundations of the IGA MUD were presented
in Section 5.3.2.1, where the IGA framework as well as its optimization capability were characterized.
Our related simulation results were provided in Section 5.3.2.2, where the combined BQM-IGA-assisted
system was found to give the best performance in all scenarios considered, while maintaining a modest
computational complexity. In low-throughput scenarios, e.g. a six-user system employing a 4-QAM
modem, a two-iteration BQM-IGA MUD associated with X = 20 and Y = 5 was capable of achieving
the same performance as the optimum ML-aided system at a complexity of 200, which is only about
50% and 5% of the MUD-related complexity imposed by the conventional UM-aided single-iteration
IGA MUD and the optimum ML MUD, respectively. On the other hand, in high-throughput six-user
systems employing for example a 16-QAM modem, a two-iteration BQM-IGA MUD associated with
X = 40 and Y = 5 achieved an Eb/N0 gain of about 7 dB over the MMSE MUD benchmark at the
BER of 10−5, while the UM-aided GA or IGA MUDs suffered from a high residual error ﬂoor even
when the iterative framework was employed. Furthermore, the associated Eb/N0 gain was attained at
a modest complexity of 400, which is only 0.002 38% of the excessive complexity imposed by the ML
MUD that cannot be simulated in this case.
Moreover, the proposed BQM-IGA MUD is capable of providing a near-optimum performance even
in the so-called overloaded scenarios, where the number of users is higher than the number of receiver
antenna elements, while many conventional detection techniques suffer from an excessively high error
ﬂoor. For example, with L = 8 users and P = 6 receivers, the two-iteration-based BQM-IGA MUD
reduced the BER recorded at an Eb/N0 value of 3 dB by four orders of magnitude in comparison with
the classic MMSE-MUD-aided benchmark system, as shown in Figure 5.20. This result characterizes
the robustness of the BQM-IGA MUD, which has successfully suppressed the high MUI experienced
in overloaded scenarios. As a further investigation, we demonstrated in Section 5.3.2.2.3 that the
proposed system is capable of achieving a satisfactory performance even in the case of imperfect
channel estimation. Furthermore, the complexity of the proposed detection scheme is only moderately
higher than that imposed by the linear MMSE MUD, and is substantially lower than that imposed by
the optimum ML MUD, as discussed in Section 5.3.3. We also showed that in both the fully loaded
scenario of Section 5.3.1.3.2 and in the overloaded scenario of Section 5.3.2.2.2.2 the complexity of the
BQM approach can be further reduced by employing its simpliﬁed version, namely the CNUM scheme
of Section 5.3.1.2.2, at the cost of a slightly degraded system performance.
Note that the system parameters of the IGA framework, such as the number of TTCM iterations,
the number of IGA MUD iterations and the GA-related parameter settings, are all readily conﬁgurable,
enabling us to strike an attractive trade-off between the achievable performance and the complexity
imposed. For speciﬁc scenarios, the TTCM scheme used in the system can also be conveniently
substituted by other FEC schemes, e.g. the TC codes. Therefore, the facility provided by the proposed
IGA MUD may make it possible for applications in multi-mode terminals, where good performance,
low complexity and easy ﬂexibility are all important criteria. It is also worth pointing out that the
proposed BQM-aided IGA MUD can be readily incorporated into multi-user CDMA systems, e.g.
those of [38]. In this case, the initial detected signal supplied to the GA MUD for creating the ﬁrst
GA population is provided by the bank of matched ﬁlters installed at the CDMA BS, rather than by the
MMSE MUD. However, the BQM scheme may remain unchanged.

Chapter 5. Hybrid Multi-user Detection for SDMA-OFDM Systems
In the next chapter, our attention will be focused on a TTCM-assisted MMSE-IGA MUD SDMA-
OFDM system employing a new type of Frequency-Hopping (FH) technique for the sake of achieving
further performance enhancements.

Chapter6
Direct-Sequence Spreading and
Slow Subcarrier-Hopping Aided
Multi-user SDMA-OFDM Systems
6.1
Conventional SDMA-OFDM Systems1
In Chapters 4 and 5, Coded Modulation (CM) [314] assisted SDMA-OFDM systems invoking both
Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) based Multi-User Detection
(MUD) have been investigated, respectively. Speciﬁcally, in terms of the bandwidth-sharing strategy,
the SDMA-OFDM systems discussed in these chapters are referred to here as the conventional
SDMA-OFDM systems [3, 193], where all the users exploit the entire system bandwidth for their
communications. However, this bandwidth-sharing strategy exhibits a few drawbacks.
On the one hand, the conventional SDMA-OFDM systems can exploit little frequency diversity,
since each user activates all available subcarriers. This limitation can be mitigated by combining both
Frequency-Hopping (FH) and SDMA-OFDM techniques, resulting in the FH/SDMA-OFDM systems.
In these FH/SDMA-OFDM systems the total system bandwidth is divided into several subbands, each
of which hosts a number of consecutive subcarriers, and a so-called FH pattern is used for controlling
the subband allocation for the different users. Since each user activates different subbands from time to
time, the achievable frequency diversity improves as the width of the subbands is reduced.
On the other hand, when the number of users becomes higher in conventional SDMA-OFDM
systems, a higher Multi-User Interference (MUI) is expected across the entire bandwidth and hence all
users will suffer from a performance degradation. Unfortunately, the same phenomenon is encountered
also in FH/SDMA-OFDM systems at those subbands that are shared by excessive numbers of users.
Undoubtedly, the best solution to eliminate the MUI is to avoid subband collisions between the different
users by assigning each subband exclusively to a single user. This scheme of ‘one subband for one
user’ will inevitably reduce the system’s overall throughput. The attainable system throughput can
be increased with the aid of higher-order modems, which are more vulnerable to transmission errors
as well as impose an increased MUD complexity at the receivers, which is undesirable. Therefore,
subcarrier-reuse-based SDMA-OFDM using efﬁcient FH techniques is preferable, since it is capable

of maintaining a sufﬁciently high overall system throughput even with the employment of a relatively
low-order, low-complexity modem, while effectively suppressing the associated high MUI.
In this chapter, we will introduce a new bandwidth-efﬁcient approach for employment in SDMA-
OFDM systems designed for solving the two problems mentioned above.
6.2
Introduction to Hybrid SDMA-OFDM
During the last few decades, a range of Time-Division Multiple Access (TDMA) [36], Frequency-
Division Multiple Access (FDMA) [36] and Code-Division Multiple Access (CDMA) [37, 38, 40–42]
schemes have found employment in ﬁrst-, second- and third-generation wireless systems. Spread-
Spectrum Multiple Access (SSMA) [470–473] schemes have been widely investigated, since they
exhibit a range of attractive properties, including the ability to combat various types of interference.
The well-known Direct-Sequence Code-Division Multiple Access (DS-CDMA) [38] scheme is resilient
against both narrowband interference and multi-path fading. Another classic SSMA scheme is
constituted by Frequency-Hopped SSMA (FH/SSMA) [38, 474–477], where the total available system
bandwidth is divided into a number of subbands shared by a number of simultaneous users. An
appropriate number of subcarriers can be assigned to each of these subbands, which may experience
different channel qualities and hence may deliver different types of services. The so-called FH pattern
is used to control a frequency synthesizer involved for the purpose of activating different subcarrier
frequencies. The data of each of the simultaneous users modulate the subcarriers independently, and the
entire system bandwidth can be allocated on a demand basis. The bandwidth of the subbands may be
arbitrarily small or large, depending on the type of services to be delivered or the bit rate to be supported.
This ﬂexibility is attractive when aiming at supporting future multimedia services, where variable
bit rates associated with different Quality-of-Service (QoS) are required by different applications.
Moreover, in FH-aided systems the different subbands of a particular user do not necessarily have
to be contiguously allocated. This ﬂexibility is attractive in scenarios where several systems operated
by different service providers have to coexist and/or fractional bandwidths have to be exploited.
FH can be effectively amalgamated with a range of well-established techniques, e.g. the family of
CDMA systems, resulting in the FH/CDMA systems [38, 478–481]. Furthermore, OFDM [1, 3, 4, 24]
also beneﬁts from invoking various FH schemes [482,483]. The FH-aided OFDM systems may also be
combined with time-domain Direct-Sequence Spreading (DSS) techniques for creating hybrid systems,
where the multiple users’ modulated DSS signals are frequency hopped according to their user-speciﬁc
FH patterns. Hybrid DSS/FH systems are attractive, because the advantages of both the DSS and FH
techniques may be combined, while eliminating or mitigating some of their disadvantages [480, 484].
For example, a hybrid DSS/FH system is capable of combining the interference resilience of DS/SS
systems with the attractive partial-band-jamming mitigation features of FH/SS systems [480].
More speciﬁcally, hybrid DSS/FH systems can be beneﬁcially amalgamated with the conventional
SDMA-OFDM systems [3,193] invoking MUD [439] techniques, which exhibit a number of advantages
over more traditional multiple-access techniques, resulting in hybrid DSS/FH-aided SDMA-OFDM
systems. Furthermore, the performance of the hybrid system can be signiﬁcantly improved if the
proposed novel type of Slow Frequency-Hopping (SFH) technique, referred to here as the Slow
SubCarrier-Hopping (SSCH) scheme, is employed. From a general point of view, the philosophy
of the SubCarrier-Hopping (SCH) technique is reminiscent of the concept of Clustered OFDM
(ClOFDM) [485–487] and Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) [43–46], both
of which are conceptually similar. In contrast to the systems which combine OFDM with traditional
multiple-access schemes, the intrinsic nature of the orthogonal subcarriers enables OFDM itself to
support multiple access, where the subcarriers are allocated to a number of subbands and assigned to
different simultaneous users [43, 44, 488], resulting in the concept of OFDMA. OFDMA was initially
proposed for Cable TV (CATV) systems [489] and now has been ratiﬁed as the IEEE 802.16 standard
for Broadband Wireless Multiple Access (BWMA) systems [16].

6.3. Subband Hopping Versus Subcarrier Hopping
173
In the proposed hybrid DSS/SSCH SDMA-OFDM system, each subcarrier is shared by a certain
number of users in the context of the OFDM symbol’s frequency-domain representation, while each
user’s time-domain OFDM signal is further spread with the aid of DSS. Moreover, using a simple
but efﬁcient Uniform SSCH (USSCH) pattern, the hybrid DSS/SSCH-aided SDMA-OFDM system
is capable of achieving a high frequency diversity and hence exhibits a high robustness to the MUI
experienced, resulting in a signiﬁcant performance improvement. In the literature, substantial research
efforts have been invested in designing subcarrier allocation algorithms for Single-Input, Single-
Output (SISO) OFDM systems, which are subjected to various design constraints, such as requiring
the minimal overall transmit power [76, 490–494], achieving the maximum capacity [494–496] or
complying with speciﬁc QoS criteria [497]. A subcarrier and bit allocation algorithm designed to
minimize the overall transmit power for a MIMO OFDM system was proposed in [498]. A number of
subband/subcarrier allocation schemes were also proposed for systems based on ClOFDM [485–487]
or OFDMA [499–503]. However, many of these algorithms were derived under the assumption that a
subband or a subcarrier can be used by one user only, resulting in an MUI-free scenario. By contrast, our
proposed USSCH algorithm allows multiple constant-rate users to activate the same subcarrier. More
explicitly, each subcarrier can be activated by different users during different hopping intervals, while
it is desirable to ensure that the average Frequency-Domain (FD) separation of the subcarriers activated
by the same user is sufﬁciently large, in order to experience uncorrelated fading and hence a high
diversity gain. Furthermore, the number of users activating each subcarrier should ideally be similar so
as to ensure that the MUI encountered at each subcarrier becomes similar, hence eliminating the MUI
‘peaks’ across the system bandwidth. Moreover, each subcarrier may be ‘overloaded’2 by being shared
by a high number of users for the sake of maintaining a high overall system throughput.
In order to exploit fully the potential beneﬁts of the USSCH pattern, the employment of Forward
Error Correction (FEC) schemes is necessary. For the sake of convenient performance comparisons,
again, the Turbo Trellis-Coded Modulation (TTCM) [314, 435] scheme used in Chapters 4 and 5
is selected, although we point out that other FEC schemes are also applicable. It will be shown in
our forthcoming discourse that with the aid of the advocated USSCH pattern, the MUI experienced
by the TTCM-aided conventional SDMA-OFDM system can be effectively suppressed, resulting in a
signiﬁcant performance improvement, especially in high-throughput or overloaded scenarios, while a
computational complexity similar to that of the conventional SDMA-OFDM systems can be maintained.
The structure of the rest of this chapter is as follows. A comparison of various frequency resource
allocation strategies used in the conventional SDMA-OFDM, SFH/SDMA-OFDM and SSCH/SDMA-
OFDM systems is provided in Section 6.3, followed by the introduction of the proposed hybrid
DSS/SSCH-aided SDMA-OFDM scheme in Section 6.4. More speciﬁcally, a system overview is
presented in Section 6.4.1, while the transmitter and receiver structures of the proposed system are
elaborated on in Sections 6.4.1.1 and 6.4.1.2, respectively. In Section 6.4.2, two different SSCH pattern
assignment strategies are discussed. Section 6.4.3 provides an insight into the DSS despreading and
SSCH demapping processes invoked at the SDMA receiver, followed by a brief description of the
MUD process in the context of the presence of DSS/SSCH. The numerical results characterizing a
range of different SDMA-OFDM systems in different scenarios are provided in Section 6.5, while the
complexity issues are discussed in Section 6.6. Finally, Section 6.7 concludes our ﬁndings.

Subband Hopping Versus Subcarrier Hopping
Figure 6.1 shows the frequency resource allocation strategies of the conventional SDMA-OFDM [3,
193], SFH/SDMA-OFDM and SSCH/SDMA-OFDM systems. As illustrated in Figure 6.1, in conven-
tional SDMA-OFDM systems, which do not employ any hopping techniques, the total available system
2The terminology for an overloaded system in this chapter is slightly different from that discussed in Chapter 5. The former
indicates that each of the speciﬁc subcarriers used in the DSS/SSCH SDMA-OFDM system is shared by a sufﬁciently high number
of users, while the latter refers to the overloaded conventional SDMA-OFDM system, where the number of users supported exceeds
that of the receiver antenna elements.

bandwidth W is partitioned into a total of Qc = W/Wsc subcarriers, where Wsc is the subcarrier
bandwidth,3 and each user activates all the Qc subcarriers for communication.
However, in the SFH-assisted OFDM systems the total system bandwidth W is divided into a
number of subbands denoted by q = 1, . . . , Qf, as seen in Figure 6.1. Each subband is assigned a
carrier frequency fq, which is used for carrying the OFDM signal to be transmitted in this subband,
when it is activated. Furthermore, each of the Qf subbands has K subcarriers, each having a subcarrier
bandwidth of Wsc, and W = Wsc × K × Qf. In the context of the SFH/SDMA-OFDM system, during
an FH dwell time Th, each of the L simultaneous users supported is assigned one of the Qf subbands
associated with a speciﬁc carrier frequency fq, which is activated by a frequency synthesizer according
to either the pseudo-random or the deterministic user-speciﬁc hopping pattern set used. In contrast to
Fast Frequency-Hopping (FFH) systems, where the symbol duration Ts obeys βF = Ts/Th > 1, in
SFH systems βS = Th/Ts > 1, where both βF and βS are integers, while Th is the hopping dwell
period. Using SFH makes it feasible to use coherent demodulation at the receiver side, since the hopping
rate is slower than the data rate.
Note that the SFH subbands are not necessarily contiguously allocated in the frequency domain.
However, if a subband is activated by a user, all the K subcarriers within this subband are assigned
to the speciﬁc user. While each user can only activate one subband during each FH dwell time Th,
the same subband can be exploited by more than one user. Therefore, if an excessive number of users
happen to activate the same subband, resulting in heavy MUI, severe signal corruption will occur across
all the consecutive subcarriers within this speciﬁc subband.
In comparison with SFH/SDMA-OFDM systems, where subband-based SFH is employed, in
the proposed SSCH/SDMA-OFDM system a subcarrier-based SFH technique is invoked. Similar
to conventional SDMA-OFDM systems, in SSCH/SDMA-OFDM systems we also have a total of
Qc = W/Wsc subcarriers. However, each user activates only K of the Qc available subcarriers,
where 0 < K < Qc. While an SFH user exploits all the K subcarriers of an SFH subband during the
hopping dwell time of Th, an SSCH user employing the same number of K subcarriers can potentially

spectrum.

select any K of the Qc available subcarriers without decreasing the throughput, as seen in Figure 6.1.
Furthermore, in SSCH/SDMA-OFDM systems a high MUI is expected to contaminate the dispersed
subcarriers activated by a number of users, which is different from the situation experienced in the
SFH/SDMA-OFDM scenario, where potentially all the consecutive subcarriers of a subband hosting a
number of users may be at a risk of being severely corrupted. Moreover, the SSCH scheme is capable of
more efﬁciently exploiting the beneﬁts of frequency diversity in comparison with the SFH arrangement,
since a deep fade which may corrupt many consecutive subcarriers of an SFH user may only affect
a small fraction of the subcarriers used by an SSCH user, as an added bonus of the employment
of discontinuous subcarriers. Explicitly, when an appropriately designed hopping pattern is used, the
‘interleaving-like’ FD fading randomization characteristic of the SSCH system disperses the originally
bursty FD errors and hence enhances the chances of the channel decoder to correct the residual errors.
The SSCH-aided OFDM may be viewed as being somewhat similar to OFDM/OFDMA with
interleaving, since both of these techniques provide a method to exploit the achievable frequency
diversity. However, they are different in that in the former system different subcarriers are assigned
to different users at different hopping dwell instants, while in the latter system each user employs all the
subcarriers (or the same set of subcarriers in the case of OFDMA), although the signal carried by each
subcarrier is interleaved. In hostile propagation scenarios some subcarriers may consistently encounter
deep channel fades despite using the above-mentioned anti-fading measures, thus the speciﬁc user of
the interleaved OFDM/OFDMA system who happens to activate these bad subcarriers may suffer from
a consistently poor performance. By contrast, in the SSCH-aided OFDM system this rarely happens,
since each user will be assigned different subcarriers from time to time.
We point out that by assigning a different number of subcarriers to different users, a ﬂexible multi-
rate system can be created, which is capable of satisfying the users’ QoS proﬁles. For the sake of
simplicity, in this chapter we assume that each user has the same constant bit rate.
6.4
System Architecture
Having outlined the basic concepts of the SSCH technique, let us now focus our attention on
the structure of the proposed TTCM-assisted hybrid DSS/SSCH-aided SDMA-OFDM system. The
organization of this section is as follows. In Section 6.4.1 an overview of the basic TTCM-assisted
DSS/SSCH-aided SDMA-OFDM system employing the classic MMSE MUD is provided, followed
by the introduction of the associated transmitter and receiver structures, which are detailed in
Sections 6.4.1.1 and 6.4.1.2, respectively. The SSCH pattern design is discussed in Section 6.4.2.
Furthermore, the operations of DSS despreading and SSCH demapping invoked at the receiver are
elaborated on in Section 6.4.3. The last part of this section focuses on MUD design in the context of the
SSCH/SDMA-OFDM system, as detailed in Section 6.4.4.
6.4.1
System Overview
In Figure 6.2 we show the schematic of a TTCM-assisted hybrid DSS/SSCH-aided SDMA-OFDM
system. As an example, the MMSE-based MUD [3] of Chapter 4 is used. As seen in the top of
Figure 6.2, for each of the L geographically dispersed mobile users, the information bit sequence is
ﬁrst mapped into Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) [24] symbols with the aid of the TTCM
encoder. The encoded QAM symbols s(l) = [s(l)
1 , s(l)
2 , . . . , s(l)
K ]T (l = 1, . . . , L), where K < Qc is
the number of subcarriers activated by each user, are then forwarded to the SSCH mapper under the
control of a speciﬁc SSCH pattern. The mapped symbols are then forwarded to the OFDM modulator,
where they are converted to OFDM symbols based on the Qc-point Inverse Fast Fourier Transform
(IFFT) algorithm. The OFDM-modulated signal is then delivered to the DSS spreader for time-domain-
based spreading. Afterwards, this subcarrier-hopped and spread signal is transmitted to the BS by the
single-antenna-aided MS over the SDMA MIMO channel described by Figure 4.1. At the BS shown
in the bottom part of Figure 6.2, P receiver antenna elements are employed, where the despreading

process is ﬁrst invoked, followed by the OFDM demodulation using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
algorithm. Given knowledge of the user-speciﬁc SSCH patterns, the despread signal is dehopped by
the SSCH demapper. The resultant outputs xp = [xp,1, xp,2, . . . , xp,K]T (p = 1, . . . , P ) are then
forwarded to the MMSE-based MUD for separating the different users’ signals. The MUD signals

In Sections 6.4.1.1 and 6.4.1.2, we will provide further insights into the transmitter and receiver
structures of the hybrid DSS/SSCH MMSE-SDMA-OFDM system, respectively. Note that for the sake
of simplicity, the procedures of adding and removing the cyclic OFDM preﬁx [3,24] are omitted in both
sections.
6.4.1.1
Transmitter Structure
The transmitter structure of the TTCM-assisted DSS/SSCH SDMA-OFDM system is portrayed in
Figure 6.3. As seen in Figure 6.3, the TTCM-coded symbols are ﬁrst S/P converted and forwarded to
the SSCH mapper. More speciﬁcally, the K information symbols s(l)
gl,k (l = 1, . . . , L; k = 1, . . . , K)
of a user are mapped to K out of Qc SSCH subcarriers, where the activation strategy of the set of
K subcarriers depends on the speciﬁc SSCH pattern used. For example, if pseudo-random hopping is
employed, each user can independently select K subcarriers according to the action of a pseudo-random
subcarrier selector, as illustrated in Figure 6.3. Since each of the L users activates K < Qc subcarriers,
there will be Qc −K deactivated subcarriers for each user. Therefore, an ON–OFF-type signalling
scheme may be invoked [478], where the activated and deactivated statuses of speciﬁc subcarriers
represent the ON and OFF states, respectively. Then the total number of Qc subcarriers can be processed
by a Qc-point IFFT. Since the deactivated subcarriers deliver no information, the transmit power of each
SSCH user is the same as that of an SFH user, if the same K activated subcarriers are employed by both
of them. In order to exploit coherent demodulation at the receiver, the SSCH dwell period Th should

be longer than the symbol duration Ts. In the example of Figure 6.3, each user’s SSCH pattern remains
constant during the period of Th for two consecutive symbol periods.
Following the IFFT-based OFDM modulation, the user’s signal is forwarded to the DSS spreader
seen in Figure 6.3, where the time-domain spreading operation is invoked with the aid of orthogonal
spreading sequences for achieving time diversity. In this thesis Walsh–Hadamard Transform Spreading

178
Chapter 6. DSS and Slow Subcarrier-Hopping Multi-user SDMA-OFDM
(WHTS) codes are considered. The G-order Walsh–Hadamard Transform (WHT) matrix UWHTG is
given in a recursive form as stated in Equation (4.10), which is repeated here for the convenience of the
reader:
UWHTG =
1
√
2
1 · UWHTG/2
1 · UWHTG/2
1 · UWHTG/2
−1 · UWHTG/2

,
(6.1)
while the lowest-order WHT unitary matrix UWHT2 is deﬁned by Equation (4.11). More speciﬁcally, a
total of L users is supported by the DSS/SSCH system, who are divided into the number G of DSS user
groups, each of which is assigned a different DSS code vector cgl based on WHTS, which is carried
out according to one of the G rows in the WHT matrix UWHTG of Equation (6.1), as shown in the DSS
spreader block of Figure 6.3. The number of users in one DSS group may be different from that in
another; however, the users within the same group will share the same DSS code. From the point of
view of the users, the lth user’s DSS code may or may not be the same as the other users’, depending on
whether they belong to the same DSS group or not. Explicitly, the users employing the same DSS code
cannot be differentiated in the time domain. However, they are separable in the context of the SDMA
architecture with the aid of their unique user-speciﬁc spatial signatures, i.e. by their CIRs [3]. More
precisely, this is achieved by employment of the SDMA MUD, e.g. the MMSE MUD of Section 4.2.2.1.
Following the DSS process, the spread OFDM signal will be transmitted by the MS over the channel
using a speciﬁc carrier frequency fc.
Note that the quasi-synchronous uplink operation of MSs may be established with the aid of
sufﬁciently accurate timing advance control by advancing the mobiles’ transmission instants according
to their estimated time delays [504]. Furthermore, the single-user OFDM synchronization techniques
of [3] may be further developed for multi-user systems. Alternatively, the techniques of [505–507] may
also be applicable to the SSCH/SDMA-OFDM system.
6.4.1.2
Receiver Structure
The receiver structure of the DSS/SSCH SDMA-OFDM system follows the inverse of the transmitter
structure, as illustrated in Figure 6.4. The received signal is the superposition of all users’ transmitted
signals plus the Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN). At each of the P SDMA BS receiver antenna
elements, ﬁrst the received signal rp (p = 1, . . . , P ) is despread with the aid of the different DSS
codes, resulting in the corresponding number of G different despread signal groups, each of which
is constituted by the received signals of the users that employ the same speciﬁc DSS code. Note that
each subcarrier may be activated4 by different users employing either the same or different DSS codes,
depending on the SSCH pattern assignment strategy used. Hence, with knowledge of the SSCH patterns,
an active subcarrier selector can be employed at the BS for controlling the despreading operation, so
that the appropriate DSS codes are used at the different subcarriers. For example, Figure 6.4 shows
the processing invoked for the gth (g ∈{1, . . . , G}) DSS group, where the gth DSS code is used for
separating this DSS group’s signal from the others’. Then, FFT-based OFDM demodulation is invoked
for each of the different DSS groups at each of the P receiver antenna elements, followed by SSCH
demapping. The BS’s active subcarrier selector simultaneously selects the active subcarriers at the P
receivers, and the resultant composite multi-user output signal is forwarded to the MUD for detection.
As an example, the MMSE MUD is pictured in Figure 6.4, but other MUDs such as for example the
MMSE-IGA MUD of Chapter 5 are equally applicable. The separated different users’ signals are then
P/S converted and forwarded to the user-speciﬁc TTCM channel decoders.
6.4.2
Subcarrier-Hopping Strategy Design
In the SSCH/SDMA-OFDM system, the appropriate choice of the SSCH strategy is a crucial factor
of system design. The SSCH pattern decides upon the choice of the subcarriers to which the different
users’ signals are mapped and thus has a direct impact on the amount of MUI inﬂicted. In order to

eliminate the MUI, the best solution is to avoid subcarrier collisions between the different users by
assigning each subcarrier exclusively to a single user, as proposed for a number of systems based
on ClOFDM [485] or OFDMA [499–502]. However, we prefer a subcarrier-reuse system, where the
system’s overall throughput can be further increased. Furthermore, to design an appropriate SSCH
pattern the following two aspects should be taken into account. On the one hand, for the sake of
combating the MUI, a meritorious SSCH pattern should ensure that each user’s high-MUI subcarriers
are dispersed across the FD, rather than being concentrated in the FD. On the other hand, in order to
mitigate FD fading, the subcarriers activated by the same user should be uniformly distributed across the
entire bandwidth, rather than being consecutively mapped to a small fraction of the entire bandwidth, so
that frequency diversity can be efﬁciently exploited and hence the detrimental effects of deep FD fades
can be mitigated. Both of these requirements result in a more random distribution of the originally

180
Chapter 6. DSS and Slow Subcarrier-Hopping Multi-user SDMA-OFDM
bursty FD errors incurred by either a high MUI or a deep FD fade, thus enhancing the chances of the
channel decoder to correct the residual errors.
Based on the above motivation, two types of SSCH pattern will be considered in this section.
6.4.2.1
Random SSCH
We refer to the ﬁrst scheme as the Random SSCH (RSSCH) pattern, where each user independently
selects any K out of the total Qc available subcarriers during each SSCH dwell time period of Th.
Employing a random hopping strategy is a convenient solution for the simultaneous mobile users, since
each user may activate any of the available subcarriers without restrictions imposed by the others.
However, the RSSCH strategy also has some drawbacks. Speciﬁcally, in RSSCH-based systems some
subcarriers may be activated by a smaller number of users, hence the MUI level is low at these
subcarriers, which in turn beneﬁts all the active users that use them. Unfortunately, this beneﬁt is
achieved at the cost of increasing the MUI imposed on the other subcarriers, which are assigned to
an excessive number of users. Therefore, those disadvantaged users will suffer from a high MUI.
Furthermore, the beneﬁts gained from the high-quality subcarriers may not be expected to compensate
for the detrimental effects arising from the severely corrupted ones, and thus result in an increased
average Bit Error Ratio (BER).
6.4.2.2
Uniform SSCH
For the sake of mitigating the above-mentioned deﬁciencies of the RSSCH scheme, we will introduce
another SSCH strategy, referred to as the Uniform SSCH (USSCH) scheme, which is capable of
effectively counteracting the above problem. In the proposed USSCH-based systems all users’ hopping
patterns are jointly designed so that the number of interfering users at each subcarrier – which also
depends on the total number of users L supported by the SSCH system – is as similar as possible,
and thus the users can be uniformly distributed to the Qc subcarriers, which in turn satisﬁes both the
requirements mentioned above.
In Section 6.4.2.2.1, we will provide a detailed discussion on the design of the proposed USSCH
pattern.
6.4.2.2.1
Design of the USSCH Pattern
During each SSCH dwell interval of Th, the algorithm used to create a set of USSCH patterns for all
the users is as follows. Firstly, we recall that in SSCH systems the total bandwidth W is shared by
Qc subcarriers, each of which has a subcarrier bandwidth of Wsc = W/Qc. Then we partition the Qc
subcarriers into K subcarrier groups, where each group has Qg = Qc/K number of subcarriers. For
example, if we have a total of Qc = 512 available subcarriers, where each user activates K = 128
subcarriers for transmission, this will result in K = 128 subcarrier groups, each of which has Qg =
512/128 = 4 subcarriers, as illustrated in Figure 6.5. Then an L-iteration USSCH pattern assignment
algorithm is invoked for each of the K groups, i.e. from the ﬁrst to the Kth group, to generate a speciﬁc
length-K pattern set for each of the L users. Note that this principle is different from that of the RSSCH
scheme, where each user is randomly assigned K subcarriers. By contrast, in the USSCH arrangement
each of the K subcarriers assigned to a speciﬁc user is chosen from a different subcarrier group. In
other words, each user’s speciﬁc set of K activated subcarriers is uniformly distributed across the entire
system bandwidth.
Figure 6.6 illustrates the proposed algorithm invoked in the kth (k = 1, . . . , K) subcarrier group
for assigning the Qg subcarriers to the L users. More precisely, initially a remaining user set A(1)
containing all the L users is created, as shown in Figure 6.6. During the lth (l = 1, . . . , L) iteration,
a subcarrier index q(l)
k

operation. A user u(l) is then randomly selected from A(l) based on the uniform probability of
p(l) =
1
L −l + 1,
(6.2)
and the (q(l)
k )th subcarrier within this speciﬁc subcarrier group will be assigned to user u(l). The
remaining user set A(l) is then updated by removing user u(l) from it, resulting in A(l+1), which
contains the remaining (L −l) users. Then the subcarrier assignment process proceeds to the next,
i.e. to the (l + 1)th iteration, allocating the next subcarrier to the next randomly selected user, as seen
in Figure 6.6. This iterative subcarrier-to-user assignment process continues until the Lth iteration is
completed. By this time, each of the L users has been assigned a single subcarrier of the kth subcarrier
group. Hence, a vector qk = [q(1)
k , q(2)
k , . . . , q(L)
k
] is generated, where q(l)
k
(l = 1, . . . , L) constitutes
the kth subcarrier of the lth user’s length-K USSCH pattern set.5 Then the vector-generating routine
described above is invoked for the next, i.e. for the (k+1)th subcarrier group. When all the K subcarrier
groups have been processed, a set containing K length-L vectors qk (k = 1, . . . , K) has been
generated, explicitly indicating which speciﬁc subcarrier of group k has been assigned to which of the
L users. Viewing this subcarrier allocation from the users’ perspective, the lth user’s speciﬁc length-K
USSCH pattern set q(l) is created by choosing that speciﬁc subcarrier corresponding to the lth element
of each of the K vectors, which has been assigned to user l, resulting in q(l) = [q(l)
1 , q(l)
2 , . . . , q(l)
K ], l ∈
{1, . . . , L}.
Note that the above subcarrier-group-based algorithm employs the full permutation theory [508].
More explicitly, each of the K length-L vectors qk (k
= 1, . . . , K) associated with the kth
subcarrier group is an element of the L-order full permutation set [508], and is generated at a constant
probability of

(6.4)
where the element vectors are given by qk = [q(1)
k , q(2)

] (k = 1, . . . , L!). Thus, the
employment of the USSCH pattern assignment algorithm of Figure 6.6 is conceptually equivalent to
5Recall that each user activates K subcarriers for transmission and thus has to be assigned a length-K USSCH pattern set.

invoking the algorithm, which randomly selects one element vector from the set QL described by
Equation (6.4) for each of the K subcarrier groups, based on the probability given by Equation (6.3).
In order to offer some insight into the relation between the USSCH pattern assignment algorithm
and the full permutation theory, an example is provided in Figure 6.7, which illustrates the USSCH
pattern assignment operation invoked for the kth subcarrier group of the example given by Figure 6.5,
where K = 128 and Qg = 4. Without loss of generality, we assume in this example that L = 6 users are
supported by the system. According to the algorithm of Figure 6.6, during the lth (l = 1, . . . , 6) iteration
a user u(l) is randomly selected from the remaining user set A(l) based on the selection probability
p(l) calculated by Equation (6.2) and is assigned the subcarrier with the index of q(l)
k , as observed in
Figure 6.7. Note that since L = 6 > Qg = 4, each of the last two users has to activate a subcarrier that
has already been assigned to a previous user. The subcarriers activated by more than one user are printed
in grey in Figure 6.7. After L = 6 iterations, a vector qk having six elements is generated. Furthermore,
the probability of generating qk is the product of the user-selection probability p(l), expressed as

which yields the same result as that calculated by Equation (6.3) in conjunction with L = 6. In
other words, the generation of the vector qk has the same effect as selecting it from the six-order
full permutation set Q6 based on the probability given by Equation (6.3), as pointed out previously.
6.4.2.2.2
Discussions
As informed by Figure 6.7, when we have L > Qg and L mod Qg ̸= 0, in each of the K subcarrier
groups, there will be Qg −(L mod Qg) subcarriers that have to be activated by one more user than
the other subcarriers in the same group. Thus, a higher MUI is expected at these subcarriers. However,
since the users that are assigned to the higher-MUI subcarriers are randomly selected, it is unlikely for
these more MUI contaminated subcarriers of different subcarrier groups to be always assigned to the
same user. In other words, from each user’s point of view, among the total K activated subcarriers, the
speciﬁc subcarriers that encounter a higher MUI can be uniformly dispersed across the entire system
bandwidth. Furthermore, since in USSCH/SDMA-OFDM systems each user’s activated subcarriers are
uniformly distributed over the entire bandwidth, frequency diversity can be efﬁciently exploited. Thus,
both requirements mentioned at the beginning of Section 6.4.2 are satisﬁed by employing the proposed
USSCH pattern assignment algorithm.
On the other hand, if we have L mod Qg = 0, each subcarrier is activated by the same number
of L/Qg users. Moreover, when L < Qg, the USSCH system is actually MUI-free, since each
subcarrier is assigned to at most one user. In both of these two scenarios, the MUI encountered in
the USSCH/SDMA-OFDM system is identical at all the activated subcarriers, since each subcarrier
hosts the same number of users. This situation is similar to that encountered in conventional SDMA-
OFDM systems [3, 193] in terms of the amount of MUI inﬂicted at each subcarrier. However, the
USSCH/SDMA-OFDM system beneﬁts from the USSCH pattern assignment algorithm of Figure 6.6,
which has the ability to exploit efﬁciently the achievable frequency diversity offered by the system,
hence becoming capable of outperforming conventional SDMA-OFDM systems. Furthermore, the
advantage of the USSCH pattern design will become even more signiﬁcant in overloaded scenarios,
where an excessively high MUI is expected, as we will demonstrate in Section 6.5.

Chapter 6. DSS and Slow Subcarrier-Hopping Multi-user SDMA-OFDM
6.4.2.3
Random and Uniform SFH
Note that the principles of the RSSCH and USSCH strategies can also be applied to SFH/SDMA-
OFDM, resulting in Random SFH (RSFH) and Uniform SFH (USFH) aided SDMA-OFDM systems,
respectively. More speciﬁcally, in USFH/SDMA-OFDM systems subbands of subcarriers rather than
individual subcarriers are jointly assigned to the different users, following a philosophy similar to that
of Figure 6.6.
It is worth pointing out that the USFH/SDMA-OFDM scheme is capable of outperforming the
conventional SDMA-OFDM arrangement, as a beneﬁt of the proposed uniform pattern assignment
algorithm. However, given the same system bandwidth and the same total system throughput, the
USFH/SDMA-OFDM system is unable to outperform its USSCH-aided counterpart. This is because in
USFH-aided systems a subband – which accommodates a number of subcarriers and may be viewed as
an ‘entire’ bandwidth for a ‘reduced-size’ conventional SDMA-OFDM system – is still more vulnerable
both to high MUI and to deep fades than a subcarrier of USSCH-aided systems. The above arguments
will be corroborated by our simulation results to be presented in Section 6.5.
6.4.2.4
Ofﬂine Pattern Pre-computation
It is also worth pointing out that the USFH/USSCH patterns can be acquired by ofﬂine pre-computation,
since their choice is not based on any channel knowledge. Furthermore, the patterns can be reused,
provided that the reuse time interval is sufﬁciently long, so that the frequency diversity can be
sufﬁciently exploited. The reuse intervalis deﬁned by
Tr = µTh,
(6.6)
where the reuse factor µ is a positive integer. More explicitly, during the ofﬂine pattern pre-computation,
µ USFH/USSCH patterns are generated for each of the L users, each of which is associated with one of
the µ FH dwell time periods during the time interval of Tr. These USFH/USSCH pattern sets can then
be reused during every reuse interval Tr, implying that the real-time signalling of the USFH/USSCH
patterns from the transmitters to the receivers is unnecessary. This imposes a signiﬁcantly lower
computational complexity than that required by other adaptive algorithms exploiting real-time channel
knowledge.
Having discussed the design of SSCH patterns, in the next section we will detail the DSS
despreading and SSCH demapping processes invoked at the DSS/SSCH SDMA-OFDM receiver.
6.4.3
DSS Despreading and SSCH Demapping
In the L-user TTCM-assisted DSS/SSCH SDMA-OFDM system employing P receiver antenna
elements, the lth (l = 1, . . . , L) user’s transmitted signal at the qth (q = 1, . . . , Q) subcarrier can
be expressed as
s′(l)
gl,q(t) =
√
2PT Λ(l)
q (t)s(l)
gl,q(t)cgl(t) cos(2πfct + ϕ(l)),
l ∈{1, . . . , L},
gl ∈{1, . . . , G},
q ∈{1, . . . , Q},
(6.7)
where PT is the transmitted power, s(l)
gl,q(t) is the user’s information signal, fc is the carrier frequency
and ϕ(l) is the phase angle introduced by carrier modulation, while Λ(l)

Furthermore, cgl(t) of Equation (6.7) denotes the DSS signature sequence assigned to the lth user and
associated with the gth DSS group, given by

(6.10)
while ugl[c] of Equation (6.9) is the cth element of the gth row in the (G × G)-dimensional WHT
matrix deﬁned by Equation (6.1). Therefore, the received signal at the pth receiver antenna element is
rp(t) =

where H(l)
p,q represents the FD-CHTFs associated with the speciﬁc link between the lth user and the
pth receiver antenna element in the context of the qth subcarrier, which is assumed to remain constant
during the period of Ts, while np(t) denotes the AWGN at the pth receiver. To separate the signals of
the G different DSS groups, the despreading operation is then invoked with the aid of the DSS codes at
each of the P receiver antennas, yielding
xp,g(t) =
 Ts
0
cg(t)rp(t) dt,
g ∈{1, . . . , G}.
(6.12)
Note that the above despreading operation can be restricted to the activated subcarriers only, if RSSCH
patterns are used, or if USSCH patterns are employed under the condition of L < Qg. In either scenario
there exists inactivated subcarriers which do not carry any information signal and thus do not need to
be processed. If USSCH patterns are used and we have L ≥Qg, all subcarriers are activated and thus
despreading is required across the entire bandwidth. As a generalized case, let us assume that the qth
subcarrier is activated by Lq users, where 1 ≤Lq ≤L. Furthermore, at this speciﬁc subcarrier, a total
of Gq (1 ≤Gq ≤G) different DSS codes are used by the Lq users, where each user’s code may or
may not be the same as the others’. Without loss of generality, we assume that the gth (g = 1, . . . , Gq)
of the Gq different DSS groups contains lg users, where we have
Lq =
Gq

g=1
lg.
(6.13)
Thus, the discrete signal received at the qth subcarrier of the pth receiver during an OFDM symbol
duration can be represented as
rp,q = ¯cGq ¯Hp,q¯sq + np,q,
p ∈{1, . . . , P },
(6.14)
where the (1 × Lq)-dimensional DSS code vector ¯cGq and the Lq users’ (Lq × 1)-dimensional
information signal vector ¯sq are given by

for the sake of simplicity in our analysis and simulation, we will assume here that Γτ(t) is an ideal rectangular pulse.

where (·)T denotes the transposition operation. The corresponding spreading code sequence cg (g ∈

of the qth subcarrier, is deﬁned by
cg = [ug[1], ug[2], . . . , ug[G]],
g = 1, . . . , Gq.
(6.17)
Furthermore, the Lq users’ (Lq × Lq)-dimensional diagonal FD-CHTF matrix associated with the qth
subcarrier at the pth receiver antenna, namely ¯Hp,q of Equation (6.14), is expressed as
¯Hp,q = diag[H(1)

(6.18)
Therefore, the corresponding despread signal associated with the qth subcarrier of the pth receiver
antenna can be given by
¯xp,q = ˇcGqrp,q
= ¯RGq ¯Hp,q¯sq + ¯np,q,
p ∈{1, . . . , P},
(6.19)
where the (Gq × 1)-dimensional despread received signal vector ¯xp,q and the (Gq × 1)-dimensional
effective noise vector ¯np,q are expressed as
¯xp,q = [xp,1,q, xp,2,q, . . . , xp,Gq ,q]T ,
(6.20)
¯np,q = [np,1,q, np,2,q, . . . , np,Gq ,q]T ,
(6.21)
while the (Gq × 1)-dimensional DSS code vector ˇcGq is given by
ˇcGq = [c1, c2, . . . , cGq]T .
(6.22)
Moreover, ¯RGq in Equation (6.19) is the (Gq × Lq)-dimensional cross-correlation matrix of the Lq
users’ DSS code sequences, represented as

(6.24)
Therefore, for each of the Gq DSS groups at the qth subcarrier, the despread signals can be combined
from all the P receiver antenna elements and then be forwarded to the SDMA MUD, where the signals
of different users in the same DSS group are separated in the spatial domain.
6.4.4
MUD
In Chapters 4 and 5, we investigated the MMSE- and the GA-based MUDs, respectively. The MMSE
MUD [3] of Chapter 4 exhibits a rather low complexity, while suffering from a performance loss.
By contrast, the GA-based MUD of Chapter 5 is capable of achieving a similar performance to that
attained by the optimum ML MUD at a signiﬁcantly lower complexity, especially at high user loads.

6.4.4. MUD
187
Furthermore, the MMSE-assisted Iterative GA (IGA) MUD of Chapter 5 employing Biased Q-function-
based Mutation (BQM) was found to outperform the conventional GA-based MUDs [38] at a similar
computational complexity, especially in high-throughput scenarios.
The concatenated MMSE-IGA MUD can also be employed in the hybrid DSS/SSCH SDMA-
OFDM system to improve the attainable performance. This is achieved by further processing the output
provided by the MMSE MUD as the GA’s initial detection knowledge at the active subcarriers, and then
invoking the GA-assisted iterative detection technique. More speciﬁcally, at the ﬁrst step of the iterative
detection procedure, an initial estimate of the different users’ transmitted signals is generated with the
aid of the linear MMSE MUD. This operation is similar to that invoked in the GA-aided conventional
SDMA-OFDM systems described in Chapter 5. However, in the context of the SDMA-OFDM system
employing DSS and SSCH techniques, typically only the signals that arrive at the active subcarriers
rather than spread across the entire system bandwidth will be processed.
More speciﬁcally, at the qth subcarrier of each of the Gq DSS groups, an initial estimated signal
vector ˆsMMSEg,q ∈C(lg×1) (g = 1, . . . , Gq) associated with the lg users of this group is generated by
linearly combining the (P × 1)-dimensional despread signal vector xg,q, which is constituted by the
speciﬁc despread symbols generated from the gth DSS group at all the P receiver antennas with the aid
of the MMSE MUD’s array weight matrix, as follows:
ˆsMMSEg,q = WH
MMSEg,qxg,q,
(6.25)
where
ˆsMMSEg,q = [ˆs(1)

(6.26)
xg,q = [x1,g,q, x2,g,q, . . . , xP,g,q]T ,
g = 1, . . . , Gq.
(6.27)
The MMSE-based weight matrix WMMSEg,q ∈C(P ×lg) of Equation (6.25) is given by [3]
WMMSEg,q = (Hg,qHH
g,q + σ2
nI)−1Hg,q,
(6.28)
where I is the identity matrix and σ2
n is the AWGN’s variance, while the (P × lg)-dimensional FD-
CHTF matrix associated with the gth DSS group is expressed as
Hg,q = (H(1)
g,q, H(2)
g,q, . . . , H
(lg)
g,q ),
g = 1, . . . , Gq,
(6.29)
where H(l)
g,q (l = 1, . . . , lg) is the vector of the FD-CHTFs associated with the transmission paths
between the lth user’s transmitter antenna and each element of the P-element receiver antenna array,
which is expressed as
H(l)
g,q = (H(l)
1,g,q, H(l)
2,g,q, . . . , H(l)
P,g,q)T ,
l = 1, . . . , lg.
(6.30)
Once the MMSE-based MUD is completed, the resultant output can be forwarded to the concatenated
IGA MUD of Chapter 5 for the second-stage iterative detection in the context of the gth DSS group at
the qth subcarrier.
More precisely, the IGA MUD evaluates a decision metric associated with the P receivers, which is
derived from the optimum ML-based decision metric [3], in order to detect the symbol vector ˆsGAg,q that
consists of the estimated transmitted signals of the lg users in the gth DSS group, which is expressed as
ˆsGAg,q = (ˆs(1)
GAg,q, ˆs(2)
GAg,q, . . . , ˆs
(lg)
GAg,q)T ,
g = 1, . . . , Gq.
(6.31)
The decision metric required for evaluation at the pth receiver antenna is deﬁned by
Ωp,g,q(sg) = |xp,g,q −Hp,g,qsg|2,
(6.32)

188
Chapter 6. DSS and Slow Subcarrier-Hopping Multi-user SDMA-OFDM
where xp,g,q is the despread symbol of the gth DSS group at the qth subcarrier of the pth receiver,
while Hp,g,q is the pth row of the matrix Hg,q related to the same subcarrier, which is deﬁned by
Equation (6.29). Therefore, the decision rule for the optimum MUD associated with the pth antenna is
to choose that speciﬁc length-lg symbol vector sg which minimizes the metric given in Equation (6.32).
Since there are P receivers, the following combined metric is invoked:
Ωg,q(sg) =
P

p=1
Ωp,g,q(sg).
(6.33)
Hence, the joint decision rule is to ﬁnd that speciﬁc estimated transmitted lg-symbol vector ˆsGAg,q
associated with the gth DSS group, which minimizes Ωg,q(sg) in Equation (6.33) for the qth active
subcarrier, which is formulated as
ˆsGAg,q = arg

min
sg [Ωg,q(sg)]

.
(6.34)
Hence, after MUD invoked independently for each of the Gq DSS groups at the qth subcarrier, all the
estimated signals of the Lq users that activate this subcarrier will be attained. Here we point out that
the IGA-based detection process is similar to that discussed in Chapter 5, except that the operations are
separately invoked for each of the Gq DSS groups at the qth activated subcarrier.

Simulation Results
In this section, we characterize the performance of the TTCM-assisted DSS/SSCH SDMA-OFDM
system using the MMSE-IGA MUD of Chapter 5. Its performance is compared with that of its
counterparts employing the RSSCH, RSFH and USFH patterns, as well as with that of a conventional
SDMA-OFDM system [3,193] dispensing with the employment of any FH techniques. It was assumed
in all SFH- or SSCH-aided schemes that the BS has perfect knowledge of the hopping patterns. The
simulation results were obtained using a 4-QAM scheme communicating over the three-path Short
Wireless Asynchronous Transfer Mode (SWATM) CIR of Figure 3.32, assuming that the channel
transfer functions were perfectly known. Each of the paths experiences independent Rayleigh fading
having the same normalized Doppler frequencies of f ′
d = 1.235 × 10−5. The channel is assumed to be
‘OFDM symbol invariant’, implying that the taps of the impulse response are assumed to be constant
for the duration of one OFDM symbol, but they are faded at the beginning of each OFDM symbol [3].
The GA-related parameters used were ﬁxed in all the simulations, where the MMSE-IGA MUD was
employed. Speciﬁcally, the BQM scheme of Section 5.3.1.2 was used, while the IGA MUD invoked a
single iteration. For the iterative TTCM scheme [314] employed, the associated parameters were the
same as those speciﬁed in Table 5.5 of Section 5.3.2.2. For the convenience of the reader, the basic
simulation parameters are summarized in Table 6.1.
Recall that in SFH- or SSCH-aided SDMA-OFDM systems the number of activated subcarriers
K < Qc is lower than that of the conventional SDMA-OFDM system [3, 193], where all the users
employ all the Qc available subcarriers for communication. For the sake of fair comparisons, the total
system bandwidth was ﬁxed and the number of users L supported by the various SFH/SSCH-aided
systems was increased, so that the same total system throughput of BT bits per OFDM symbol was
maintained, which is calculated by
BT = K · L · BPS [bits/OFDM symbol],
(6.35)
where BPS represents the number of Bits Per Symbol per subcarrier. When 4-QAM is employed,
BPS = 2. For the reader’s convenience, the notations used in the ﬁgures of this section are summarized
in Table 6.2.
Furthermore, according to the classic spread-spectrum philosophy [509], in order to maintain a
ﬁxed OFDM symbol duration of Ts while employing time-domain DSS, the bandwidth of the OFDM

symbols will have to be proportionately expanded according to the DS spreading factor, since the DSS
codes’ chip duration Tc is shorter than Ts [38]. Therefore, in the DSS-assisted SDMA-OFDM systems
investigated in this section, where a ﬁxed total system bandwidth was assumed, the total number of
available subcarriers Qc was decreased. Equivalently, the subcarrier bandwidth Wsc was increased,
when a longer DSS code was used to support more DSS groups. For example, compared with an SSCH
system having Qc = 512 subcarriers and dispensing with the employment of DSS, a hybrid DSS/SSCH
system supporting G = 2 DSS groups will have Qc = 256 subcarriers, since in this case we have Ts =
2Tc.

using the MMSE or the MMSE-IGA MUD, while employing a 4-QAM scheme for transmission over

elements. The associated overall system throughput was BT = 5120 bits. The basic simulation
parameters and the notations used in the ﬁgure are summarized in Tables 6.1 and 6.2, respectively.
6.5.1
MMSE-Aided Versus MMSE-IGA-Aided DSS/SSCH
SDMA-OFDM
In Figure 6.8 we compare the BER performance of the TTCM-assisted USSCH/SDMA-OFDM,
DSS/USSCH SDMA-OFDM and conventional SDMA-OFDM systems, where the MMSE and MMSE-
IGA MUDs were employed, respectively. The performance of the single-user SDMA-OFDM system
employing the optimum ML MUD is also provided for reference. The same total throughput of
BT = 5120 bits per OFDM symbol was maintained for all schemes, except for the single-user
arrangement, where the throughput was 1024 bits per OFDM symbol, since we assumed that Qc = 512
was the maximum number of subcarriers that can be accommodated in the ﬁxed system bandwidth.
Note that in the context of the conventional SDMA-OFDM benchmark system, since L = 5 users were
supported by P = 4 receiver antenna elements, this scenario can be viewed as a moderately overloaded
scenario. Explicitly, for the DSS and/or SSCH-aided counterpart systems, the same implication of the
overloaded scenario was also applicable, because the same total system throughput was maintained in
these systems, which were equivalently overloaded.
From Figure 6.8 we can see that the MMSE-IGA-aided systems signiﬁcantly outperformed the
MMSE-aided systems. It can also be observed that in the scenario where the MMSE MUD was
employed, the USSCH/SDMA-OFDM and DSS/USSCH SDMA-OFDM systems achieved a similar
performance. The DSS/SDMA-OFDM and the conventional SDMA-OFDM systems also performed
similarly to each other. However, both USSCH-aided schemes were found to attain a better performance
than those dispensing with USSCH. On the other hand, when using the MMSE-IGA MUD, the
performances of the various systems were similar. This suggests that most of the MUI encountered can
be effectively suppressed by the MMSE-IGA MUD in the moderately overloaded scenario associated
with a throughput of BT = 5120 bits.

6.5.2
SDMA-OFDM Using SFH and Hybrid DSS/SSCH Techniques
In Section 6.5.1 we have discussed the attractive performance of the MMSE-IGA MUD in the context
of the hybrid SDMA-OFDM system. In this section, we will compare the attainable performance of
various MMSE-IGA-aided arrangements employing the SFH and the DSS/SSCH schemes.
6.5.2.1
Moderately Overloaded Scenarios
Figure 6.9 compares the BER performance of the various RSFH/RSSCH/USSCH-aidedSDMA-OFDM,
DSS/USSCH-aided SDMA-OFDM and conventional SDMA-OFDM systems, where TTCM and the
MMSE-IGA MUD were employed. Note that, according to the different number of subcarriers K
activated by the various schemes, the number of users was proportionately adjusted so that a total
system throughput of BT = 5120 bits per OFDM symbol was maintained for all the systems, apart
from the ML-aided single-user reference scheme.
It can be seen in Figure 6.9 that the RSFH/SDMA-OFDM scheme employing K = 64 subcarriers
achieved a better performance than its counterpart, which used K = 128 subcarriers, when the
Eb/N0 value became higher than about 4 dB. This is because in high-SNR scenarios the residual errors
encountered are more likely to have been engendered by the average MUI, rather than by the noise.
Furthermore, the RSFH system employing a lower number of subcarriers, or, more precisely, a larger
number of subbands, results in less average MUI than the RSFH system, where fewer subbands are used,
owing to supporting a reduced average number of users within each subband. More explicitly, this is
because, when a large number of users activate the same subband, all users’ subcarriers located within
this subband are severely corrupted and the signal carried by them may become unrecoverable, even
with the aid of channel codes. Moreover, at these high-MUI subbands, the heavier the MUI, the larger
the number of active users affected. Therefore, the RSFH scheme associated with wider subbands, each
of which accommodates more subcarriers, will always suffer more from an MUI-induced performance
degradation.

192
Chapter 6. DSS and Slow Subcarrier-Hopping Multi-user SDMA-OFDM
Moreover, an increased number of subbands also implies a potentially better exploitation of
frequency diversity. In frequency-selective channels, when a deep frequency-selective channel fade
occurs across a subband, a large portion of the subcarriers within this speciﬁc subband may be affected
and the corresponding signal may become obliterated – a situation similar to that of a heavily MUI-
infested subband. Although the effects imposed by a deep fade may not be worse than that by severe
MUI, especially when the faded frequency band is narrower than the subband’s bandwidth, it does inﬂict
a detrimental effect on the system and should be avoided or mitigated. This situation can be improved
by employing a large number of subbands, each having a low number of subcarriers. Explicitly, this
facilitates a better exploitation of the frequency diversity offered by the system. Furthermore, if the
subcarriers of a given user are arranged to be sufﬁciently far apart from each other in the FD, they
will experience independent FD fading, which in turn increases the TTCM channel decoder’s chance of
removing most – if not all – transmission errors.
This suggests that if the SFH subband of a speciﬁc user is further split into narrower bands, each
of which is ideally as far from the others as possible, an improved performance may be achieved
as a beneﬁt of the associated frequency diversity. This argument is conﬁrmed by the RSSCH-aided
SDMA-OFDM system, which signiﬁcantly outperformed both RSFH-aided arrangements, as a result
of employing the subcarrier-based rather than the subband-based hopping approach, as observed in
Figure 6.9.
However, note that the performance of the RSFH- or RSSCH-aided SDMA-OFDM system was
worse than that of the conventional SDMA-OFDM system, since the use of random patterns inevitably
results in an increased average BER, owing to the severe MUI arising from the subcarriers or subbands
activated by an excessive number of users, as discussed in Section 6.4.2.1. By contrast, the employment
of the uniform patterns calculated using the algorithm of Section 6.4.2.2 has the potential to improve the
conventional system’s performance, as shown in Figure 6.9. Furthermore, the achievable performance
improvement becomes more signiﬁcant when the total system throughput is further increased, which
will be discussed in the next section.
6.5.2.2
Highly Overloaded Scenarios
In this section, we investigate the various systems in the scenario where the total system throughput
was further increased to BT = 6144 bits per OFDM symbol, as portrayed in Figure 6.10. From
the ﬁgure, we can see that the USFH-, the USSCH- and the hybrid DSS/USSCH-aided systems
were capable of achieving a signiﬁcantly better performance in comparison with the other systems,
including the conventional SDMA-OFDM arrangement. More precisely, the RSFH/RSSCH SDMA-
OFDM, the DSS/SDMA-OFDM and the conventional SDMA-OFDM systems gravely suffered from
the excessive MUI and thus exhibited the corresponding error ﬂoors. By contrast, the schemes
employing USFH/USSCH successfully suppressed the MUI and eliminated the associated error ﬂoor,
as seen in Figure 6.10, while the USSCH/SDMA-OFDM system was found to be the best performer.
This signiﬁcant BER performance improvement was achieved as a beneﬁt of the USSCH strategy
presented in Section 6.4.2.2, which succeeded in exploiting the frequency diversity by dispersing the
users’ signals across the entire system bandwidth in a uniform random manner. Hence, the TTCM
decoder was capable of successfully correcting most of the near-uniformly scattered errors inherent in
each user’s transmitted signal, resulting in a signiﬁcant BER performance improvement. For example,
at an Eb/N0 value of 10 dB, the USSCH/SDMA-OFDM system reduced the BER by about two, three
and four orders of magnitude in comparison with the conventional SDMA-OFDM, the RSSCH/SDMA-
OFDM and the RSFH/SDMA-OFDM systems, respectively, as plotted in Figure 6.10.
Furthermore, as expected, the performance of the RSFH- or USFH-aided SDMA-OFDM system
was further improved as the number of subbands was decreased. Moreover, the former system was
outperformed by the RSSCH-aided scheme and the latter by the USSCH-aided arrangement. On the
other hand, the hybrid DSS/USSCH SDMA-OFDM system attained a performance between those
of the USSCH/SDMA-OFDM and the DSS/SDMA-OFDM systems, while the DSS/SDMA-OFDM

scheme achieved a similar performance to that of the conventional SDMA-OFDM system. Recall that
when the total system bandwidth is ﬁxed, the increased length of the DSS code, which implies a better
exploitation of time diversity, is achieved at the cost of decreasing the number of available subcarriers,
i.e. decreasing the attainable frequency diversity gain. Hence, the results shown in Figure 6.10 suggest
that the frequency diversity beneﬁts achieved by USSCH may be more signiﬁcant than those of the
time diversity attained by DSS. This implies that in such scenarios the ﬁxed-bandwidth hybrid system
should avoid using long DSS codes that result in a wider subcarrier bandwidth, so that a sufﬁciently
high number of Q > K subcarriers becomes available for the sake of maintaining a sufﬁciently high
frequency diversity.
This characteristic is also conﬁrmed by Figure 6.11, which shows the BER versus total system
throughput performances of the various SDMA-OFDM systems, where a different number of users
was supported at the ﬁxed Eb/N0 value of 6 dB. As inferred from Figure 6.11, when the total system
throughput was increased, the performance of all the schemes degraded owing to the increased MUI.
However, the systems using USSCH were found to outperform their counterparts dispensing with
USSCH. Again, the USSCH/SDMA-OFDM system attained the best performance by exhibiting the
highest robustness against MUI, which was, again, a direct beneﬁt of the USSCH pattern assignment
strategy of Section 6.4.2.2. This merit of the USSCH/SDMA-OFDM scheme was further evidenced by
Figure 6.12, which shows the maximum total system throughput that can be supported by the various
SFH/SSCH-aided schemes without exceeding the target BER at different Eb/N0 values. The number of
subcarriers activated by each user was set to K = 128 for all schemes for the sake of fair comparison.
Speciﬁcally, the results attained for the target BER of 10−3 and 10−5 are portrayed on the left- and right-
hand sides of Figure 6.12, respectively. It can be seen that, in both scenarios for Eb/N0 values beyond
8 dB, the RSFH system was unable to tolerate more users, because its performance was limited by the
MUI. By contrast, the other schemes were capable of providing a signiﬁcant user capacity increase,
while the USSCH/SDMA-OFDM system distinguished itself by providing the highest capacity.

DSS/USSCH SDMA-OFDM systems employing a 4-QAM scheme for transmission over the SWATM
channel [3], where P = 4 receiver antenna elements were used. The number of users supported
increased proportionally to the total system throughput. The basic simulation parameters and the
notations used in the ﬁgure are summarized in Tables 6.1 and 6.2, respectively.
For example, at the Eb/N0 value of 12 dB, a capacity increase of about 4%, 13% and 44% was achieved
by the USSCH scheme compared with the USFH, the RSSCH and the RSFH arrangement at the target
BER of 10−3, and 4%, 14% and 78% at the BER of 10−5, respectively, as shown in Figure 6.12.
6.5.3
Performance Enhancements by Increasing Receiver Diversity
In the previous sections, the performance of the different SFH- and SSCH-aided SDMA-OFDM systems
was evaluated. Furthermore, the achievable performance of the different schemes can be potentially
enhanced with the aid of a higher-order SDMA receiver diversity. Recall that in the context of SDMA-
OFDM systems, the different users are distinguished by their spatial signatures, namely the associated
channel CIRs. Hence, given a speciﬁc number of simultaneous users, an increased receiver diversity
order achieved by increasing the number of BS receiver antennas will directly attain a higher diversity
gain for all the users supported by the system, and hence an overloaded system may be turned into one
having a lower user load. Therefore, the MUD’s efﬁciency can be enhanced with the advent of a higher
degree of freedom in the context of MUD.
In Figure 6.13, the various SFH/SSCH schemes are compared in the four-receiver and six-receiver
SDMA-OFDM systems. In both scenarios, the throughput was ﬁxed at BT = 5120 bits per OFDM
symbol. Clearly, when the number of receiver antenna elements was increased from four to six, the
performance of all systems was improved, especially that of the RSFH/SDMA-OFDM arrangement.
More precisely, the corresponding residual error ﬂoor observed in the four-antenna scenario was
dramatically reduced or completely removed in the six-antenna scenario. Again, in both scenarios,
the best solution was the USSCH-assisted system. However, the performance differences between
the various schemes were substantially reduced in the higher-diversity scenario, since most of the
achievable diversity gain of the SDMA system may be attained by increasing the number of BS receiver
antennas, although at the cost of an increased hardware implementation complexity, especially in terms
of channel estimation.

basic simulation parameters and the notations used in the ﬁgure are summarized in Tables 6.1 and 6.2,
respectively.
6.5.4
Performance under Imperfect Channel Estimation
Similar to Section 5.3.2.2.3, we provide further simulation results for the scenario where channel
estimation was assumed to be imperfect. Again, the estimated SWATM CIRs were generated using
Equation (5.19), while a snapshot of the SWATM channel has been plotted in Figure 5.23, which shows
both the real and imaginary components of the FD-CHTFs associated with both perfect and imperfect
CIRs. The performance comparison of the various systems under the assumptions of both perfect and
imperfect channel knowledge is given in Figure 6.14, where the total throughput was BT = 6144 bits
per OFDM symbol. As seen in Figure 6.14, the various DSS- and/or USSCH-aided SDMA-OFDM
systems did not suffer a higher performance degradation than the single-user scheme when the channel
estimation was imperfect. This implies that the proposed hybrid system is capable of attaining an
acceptable performance even without accurate channel knowledge.
6.6
Complexity Issues
The Qc-point IFFT employed by the SSCH-aided system will inevitably impose a higher computational
complexity than its SFH-aided counterpart, where a K-point IFFT is used, regardless of whether the
RSSCH or USSCH scheme is employed, since K < Qc. However, it was shown in Section 6.5 that
SSCH systems typically achieve a signiﬁcant performance improvement over the SFH arrangements
considered, hence their additional complexity cost may be deemed justiﬁed. Furthermore, in SSCH
systems the OFDM symbols modulate a single carrier frequency fc, hence the frequency synthesizers
necessary for both the SFH transmitter and receiver are eliminated, which simpliﬁes the hardware
implementation of the SSCH systems. Note that in SFH systems the subcarrier activation/deactivation
operations may also be invoked in the baseband, so that the employment of frequency synthesizers

becomes unnecessary. However, in this case a Qc-point IFFT will have to be invoked in the baseband-
processing-aided SFH systems, resulting in a similar complexity to that of the SSCH systems.
On the other hand, concerning the RSSCH and the USSCH systems, a similar SSCH transmitter
invoking a Qc-point IFFT is employed, thus the transmitter’s complexity is similar in both systems.
Nonetheless, the RSSCH arrangement imposes a potentially higher complexity at the receiver side.
This is because the number of active users at each subcarrier is a random variable spanning from 1 to L,
since a random SSCH pattern is employed. Therefore, an MUD that is capable of detecting a variable
number of active users has to be employed, which will impose an increased complexity. Naturally, this
problem exists in all the FH/SCH-aided SDMA-OFDM systems using random hopping patterns. By
contrast, a USSCH receiver has a complexity similar to that of conventional SDMA-OFDM systems,
which employ an MUD designed for a ﬁxed number of active users. This implementation beneﬁt arises
from the characteristics of the USSCH system, since the users are uniformly distributed across the
subcarriers, so that the number of users activating each subcarrier is similar. Speciﬁcally, if the condition
of L mod Qg = L mod (Qc/K) = 0 is satisﬁed, i.e. if the number of users supported by the system
can be divided by the number of subcarriers within a subcarrier group, the number of users assigned to
all subcarriers will be the same, as discussed in Section 6.4.2.2.2.
Note that without channel feedback the proposed USSCH pattern assignment algorithm may not
be optimal in terms of combating the deleterious effects of deep channel fades. However, our proposed
scheme has the advantage of low complexity and high MUI resistance, since the USSCH patterns can
be generated using ofﬂine pre-computation and yet achieve an attractive performance, as discussed
in Section 6.4.2.4. This imposes a signiﬁcantly lower computational complexity than that required by
complicated adaptive algorithms requiring near-instantaneously channel knowledge.
6.7
Conclusions
From the investigations conducted in Section 6.5, we conclude that the proposed USSCH-aided SDMA-
OFDM system was capable of achieving the best performance in comparison with all the other schemes
considered, especially in high-throughput scenarios, when TTCM was employed. For example, in the
overloaded scenario associated with BT = 6144 bits per OFDM symbol, the USSCH/SDMA-OFDM
system reduced the BER recorded at an Eb/N0 value of 8 dB by one to four orders of magnitude in
comparison with the DSS/USSCH SDMA-OFDM, the USFH/SDMA-OFDM, the DSS/SDMA-OFDM,
the conventional SDMA-OFDM, the RSSCH/SDMA-OFDM and the RSFH/SDMA-OFDM systems,
respectively, as shown in Figure 6.10. More speciﬁcally, the USSCH-aided system exhibits a high
resilience against the excessive MUI incurred in high-throughput scenarios, owing to the characteristics
of the proposed subcarrier assignment algorithm of Section 6.4.2.2. We also show that the attainable
system performance may be further improved if a higher-order receiver diversity is provided by the
SDMA-OFDM system.
Furthermore, when compared with the conventional SDMA-OFDM system, the only additional
computational complexity imposed by the USSCH/SDMA-OFDM system arises from the low-
complexity USSCH algorithm. Moreover, it allows ofﬂine pre-computation of the patterns, as discussed
in Section 6.4.2.4. Thus, the desirable high performance of the proposed USSCH/SDMA-OFDM system
is not achieved at the cost of a signiﬁcantly increased computational complexity, in comparison with its
conventional counterpart.

Chapter Summary
In this chapter, we proposed a TTCM-assisted DSS/USSCH-aided OFDM system operating with the aid
of the MMSE-IGA MUD designed for the SDMA MIMO uplink channel introduced in Section 4.2.1,
and compared its performance with a range of different SDMA-OFDM systems.

Chapter 6. DSS and Slow Subcarrier-Hopping Multi-user SDMA-OFDM
In Section 6.1 the conventional SDMA-OFDM system was brieﬂy reviewed, where we highlighted
two of its disadvantages. On the one hand, the conventional SDMA-OFDM cannot efﬁciently exploit
frequency diversity, because all the users share all available subcarriers simultaneously. On the other
hand, a high number of users will inevitably result in a high MUI across the entire bandwidth, which
degrades all users’ performance. In Section 6.2, an introduction to hybrid SDMA-OFDM systems
was given, discussing how both of the above-mentioned problems encountered by the conventional
SDMA-OFDM system may be overcome. Furthermore, in Section 6.3 we provided a comparison of the
conventional SDMA-OFDM [3, 193], the SFH/SDMA-OFDM and the SSCH/SDMA-OFDM systems
in terms of their frequency resource allocation strategies, where the SSCH scheme was considered to
have more advantages than the others, such as for example its higher efﬁciency in terms of exploiting
frequency diversity.
In Section 6.4, the proposed hybrid SDMA-OFDM system was introduced, which incorporated both
DSS and subcarrier-based FH techniques into conventional SDMA-OFDM systems. More speciﬁcally,
an overview of the system’s architecture was presented in Section 6.4.1, including the transmitter and
receiver designs in Sections 6.4.1.1 and 6.4.1.2, respectively. Furthermore, two different SSCH pattern
assignment strategies were considered in Section 6.4.2, namely the RSSCH scheme of Section 6.4.2.1
and the USSCH scheme of Section 6.4.2.2, where the USSCH strategy was considered to be more
meritorious. This is because the USSCH algorithm designed in Section 6.4.2.2.1 assigns uniformly
distributed subcarriers to all users, so that the number of users activating each subcarrier becomes
similar. Therefore, the average MUI across the whole system bandwidth can be minimized. In
addition, with the advent of the USSCH strategy, the system’s frequency diversity can be efﬁciently
exploited. The random and uniform pattern assignment strategies can also be applied in SFH/SDMA-
OFDM systems, as discussed in Section 6.4.2.3. Moreover, we pointed out in Section 6.4.2.4 that the
USFH/USSCH patterns can be generated by ofﬂine pre-computation, which imposes a signiﬁcantly
lower computational complexity than that required by other adaptive algorithms beneﬁtting from
real-time channel knowledge. In order to offer some insight into the system design, we detailed in
Section 6.4.3 the DSS despreading and SSCH demapping operations invoked at the SDMA receiver,
followed by a discussion of the MUD process in the context of the hybrid DSS/SSCH SDMA-OFDM
system in Section 6.4.4.
Our simulation-based performance results associated with the SSCH/SDMA-OFDM system were
provided in Section 6.5. Speciﬁcally, in Section 6.5.1 the attainable performance of the DSS- and/or
SSCH-aided SDMA-OFDM systems were compared when using the classic MMSE MUD [3] discussed
in Chapter 4 and the MMSE-IGA MUD proposed in Chapter 5. It was observed in Figure 6.8 that in
the moderately overloaded scenario associated with a total system throughput of BT = 5120 bits, most
of the MUI encountered can be effectively suppressed by the MMSE-IGA MUD, while the overloaded
MMSE MUD results in a high error ﬂoor. In Section 6.5.2, the performance of the hybrid DSS/SSCH
SDMA-OFDM system was characterized and compared with that of the conventional SDMA-OFDM
and SFH-aided SDMA-OFDM systems, while employing the MMSE-IGA MUD. More speciﬁcally,
a moderately overloaded scenario was considered in Section 6.5.2.1. The RSFH-, the USFH- and the
RSSCH-aided schemes were found to suffer from using random hopping patterns, which resulted in an
increased average BER owing to the excessive MUI arising from the subcarriers or subbands activated
by a high number of users. By contrast, the systems using the uniform patterns generated by the
algorithm of Section 6.4.2.2 were capable of improving the achievable performance, as evidenced in
Figure 6.9.
Furthermore, we demonstrated in Section 6.5.2.2 that the proposed uniform pattern assignment
algorithm excelled when the total system throughput was further increased. In the highly overloaded
scenario, where the total system throughput was increased to BT = 6144 bits per OFDM symbol,
the USFH-, the USSCH- and the hybrid DSS/USSCH-aided systems were capable of achieving a
signiﬁcantly better performance in comparison with the conventional SDMA-OFDM, the DSS/SDMA-
OFDM as well as the RSFH/RSSCH-aided SDMA-OFDM systems, as portrayed in Figure 6.10.
More explicitly, the USSCH/SDMA-OFDM system was found to be the best design option, which

6.8. Chapter Summary
199
successfully suppressed the MUI and eliminated the associated error ﬂoor as a beneﬁt of the USSCH
strategy presented in Section 6.4.2.2. For example, at an Eb/N0 value of 10 dB, the USSCH/SDMA-
OFDM system reduced the BER by about two, three and four orders of magnitude in comparison with
the conventional SDMA-OFDM, the RSSCH/SDMA-OFDM and the RSFH/SDMA-OFDM systems,
respectively, as evidenced by Figure 6.10. On the other hand, it was concluded that the frequency
diversity beneﬁts achieved by USSCH may be more signiﬁcant than those of the time diversity attained
by DSS, since the hybrid DSS/USSCH SDMA-OFDM system attained a performance between those
of the USSCH/SDMA-OFDM and the DSS/SDMA-OFDM systems, while the DSS/SDMA-OFDM
scheme achieved a similar performance to that of the conventional SDMA-OFDM system. This suggests
that the ﬁxed-bandwidth hybrid system should avoid using long DSS codes that result in a wider
subcarrier bandwidth, so that a sufﬁciently high number of Q > K subcarriers becomes available
to maintain a sufﬁciently high frequency diversity. The proposed USSCH scheme’s high robustness
against MUI was further conﬁrmed by the results of Figures 6.11 and 6.12. For example, at the Eb/N0
value of 12 dB, a capacity increase of about 4%, 13% and 44% was achieved by the USSCH scheme
compared with the USFH, the RSSCH and the RSFH arrangements, when aiming at the target BER
of 10−3, and 4%, 14% and 78% for the target BER of 10−5, respectively, as shown in Figure 6.12.
We also demonstrated that the attainable performance of the SSCH-aided SDMA-OFDM system can
be further enhanced when the receiver diversity order becomes higher, as discussed in Section 6.5.3. In
Section 6.5.4, we demonstrated that the proposed hybrid system is capable of achieving an acceptable
performance even without accurate channel knowledge. Finally, we pointed out that the superior
performance of the USSCH-aided SDMA-OFDM system is achieved at a similar complexity to that of
the conventional SDMA-OFDM arrangement, since the additional computational complexity imposed
by the USSCH algorithm manifests itself in terms of the ofﬂine pre-computation, as discussed in
Section 6.6.
From the perspective of practical applications, the efﬁcient exploitation of frequency diversity and
the robust MUI-suppression capability render the channel-coded USSCH technique an attractive design
option, resulting in ﬂexible implementations. In fact, the USSCH/SDMA-OFDM scheme can be readily
extended to a variable-rate system offering a high grade of ﬂexibility, as required by future wireless
multimedia services, where variable bit rates and different QoS requirements have to be satisﬁed.
More speciﬁcally, each user may activate a different number of subcarriers depending on the type of
service to be delivered or the bit rate to be supported. A modiﬁed version of the USSCH algorithm
of Section 6.4.2.2 can be invoked to generate the users’ uniform patterns, which takes into account
their different rates. Furthermore, in SSCH-based systems the different subcarriers do not have to be
contiguously allocated, which is a further attractive property, especially in scenarios where several
systems operated by different service providers have to coexist and/or fractional bandwidths have to
be exploited. In addition, the different types of hybrid SFH/SSCH-assisted SDMA-OFDM systems
can be readily implemented by exploiting different number of subbands having different bandwidths,
depending on the speciﬁc system requirements.
So far, most of our investigations have been conducted under the assumption of perfect channel
estimation. Naturally, this assumption is impractical in real applications. Hence, in the next chapter, we
will continue our study by developing novel channel estimation techniques for SDMA-OFDM systems.

Pilot-Assisted Channel Estimation
In this treatise we concentrate our attention on the derivation and the performance analysis of
decision-directed channel estimation methods, although we would also like to give a brief performance
comparison between decision-directed and pilot-aided channel estimation methods. Our motivation is
that any technique applicable to decision-directed channel estimation can be equally employed in the
context of pilot-aided schemes and the difference in attainable performance can be predicted as outlined
below.
The attainable performance of both the Decision-Directed (DD) and Pilot-Assisted (PA) channel
estimation methods can be compared in the following simple way.
The performance of any PA channel estimation method expressed in terms of the achievable Mean
Square Error (MSE) is upper bounded by the expression
MSE PA > N0L
Ep ,
(7.1)
where Ep is the total power associated with the transmitted pilots, N0 is the Gaussian noise variance
and L is the number of non-zero CIR components.
On the other hand, in the case of DD channel estimation the corresponding performance bound,
using the assumption of error-free decisions, can be described by
MSE DD > N0
Es
L
K ,
(7.2)
where Es is the average signal energy per transmitted complex baseband sample and K is the number
of OFDM subcarriers, while N0 and L are as deﬁned previously.
Thus the resultant performance gain may be quantiﬁed as
MSE DD
MSE PA =
Ep
EsK .
(7.3)
We would also like to emphasize the trade-off between the PA channel estimator’s performance
and the system’s spectral efﬁciency loss associated with the allocation of valuable signal power to pilot

Decision-Directed Channel Estimation
A schematic of the channel estimation method considered is depicted in Figure 7.1. The symbols y[n]
and ˆs[n] in the ﬁgure represent the received vector of the subcarrier-related samples and the a posteriori
decision-based estimated vector of the transmitted information-carrying symbols s[n], respectively.
Furthermore, symbols H[n+1], α[n] and α[n+1] represent the CTF and the CIR vectors corresponding
to time instants n and n + 1, respectively.1 Finally, the accents ˇx and ˆx represent the a priori predicted
and a posteriori estimated values of the variable x, respectively. Figure 7.1 corresponds to the general
case of the CIR estimation and both sample-spaced as well as fractionally spaced cases may be
considered. We will commence by considering the simpler case of the SS-CIR. Thus, the CIR vector
α[n] in Figure 7.1 can be substituted by its sample-spaced projection h[n] described by Equation (1.8).
Our channel estimator is constituted by what we refer to as an a posteriori decision-directed CTF
estimator followed by a CIR estimator and an a priori CIR predictor [265]. As seen in Figure 7.1, the
task of the CTF estimator is to evaluate the tentative values of the subcarrier-related CTF coefﬁcients
of Equation (1.14). Correspondingly, the task of the CIR estimator is to estimate the SS-CIR taps
of Equation (1.8). In the case of the SS-CIR-aided channel estimation, discussed in this section, the
Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) transformation from the subcarrier-related frequency domain to
the SS-CIR-related time domain is invoked in order to exploit the frequency-domain correlation of the
subcarrier-related CTF coefﬁcients as well as to reduce the computational complexity associated with
the CTF prediction process, because the SS-CIR typically has a lower number of K0 ≪K taps, which
have to be predicted, than the number K of FD-CTF coefﬁcients. Hence the overall channel estimation
1In this study we invoke the analysis of relatively complex multi-dimensional vector structures associated with both time-
and spatially-multiplexed composite signals. In some cases, the two aforementioned multiplexing stages have to be addressed
concurrently within a single bound of mathematical derivation. In order to emphasize the necessary distinction between the time- and
spatial-domain constituents of the composite signals, we will utilize bold italic lower-case and upper-case letters v and A to denote
the time-domain signals and operators, and bold lower-case and upper-case letters v and A to describe the spatial-domain signals
and operators, respectively.

complexity is reduced, even when the complexity of the FD-CTF to CIR transformation and its inverse
are taken into account.2
As can be seen in Figure 7.1, the a posteriori CTF estimator inputs are the subcarrier-related signal
y[n] and the decision-based estimate ˆs[n]. The transformation from the frequency to the time domain
is performed within the CIR estimator of Figure 7.1 and its output is an a posteriori estimate ˆs[n, k]
of the CIR taps of Equation (1.8), which is fed into the low-rank time-domain CIR tap predictor of
Figure 7.1 to produce an a priori estimate ˇh[n + 1, l], l = 0, 1, . . . , K0 −1, of the next SS-CIR on
an SS-CIR tap-by-tap basis [265]. Finally, the predicted SS-CIR is converted to the subcarrier-related
CTF estimates with the aid of the FFT. The resultant FD-CTF is employed by the receiver to detect
and decode the next OFDM symbol. Note that this principle requires the transmission of a pilot-based
channel sounding sequence, such as for example a pilot-assisted OFDM block, during the initialization
stage.
7.3
A Posteriori FD-CTF Estimation
In order to emphasize the major difference between the OFDM and MC-CDMA systems in the context
of the associated channel estimation scheme, we would ﬁrst like to analyse the performance of the
temporal estimator of the subcarrier-related FD-CTF coefﬁcients H[n, k] based on the a posteriori
decision-aided estimates of the transmitted subcarrier-related samples s[n, k] of Equation (1.14). In
Section 7.3.1 we will show that the least-squares approach typically employed in DDCE-aided OFDM
systems [260,265] is not applicable in the case of MC-CDMA systems. In Section 7.4.1 we propose an
MMSE estimator which renders the DDCE philosophy discussed in [260,265] suitable for MC-CDMA
systems. However, the estimator introduced in Section 7.4.1 exhibits a computational complexity
which is signiﬁcantly higher than the computational complexity of the conventional least-squares-
based estimator of [260, 265]. Thus a reduced-complexity approximation of the MMSE estimator of
Section 7.4.1 is proposed in Section 7.4.2.
7.3.1
Least-Squares CTF Estimator
Following Equation (1.14), the Least Squares (LS) approach [330] to the problem of estimating the
discrete-abscissa FD-CTF coefﬁcients H[n, k], based on knowledge of the decision-aided estimates
ˆs[n, k] of the transmitted frequency-domain samples s[n, k] of Equation (1.14), can be expressed as
˜H[n, k] = y[n, k]
ˆs[n, k] = H[n, k] · s[n, k]
ˆs[n, k] + w[n, k]
ˆs[n, k] ,
(7.5)
where H[n, k] represents the Rayleigh-distributed FD-CTF coefﬁcients having a variance of σ2
H, while
s[n, k] denotes the transmitted subcarrier-related samples having zero mean and a variance of σ2
s.
The distribution of the samples s[n, k] is dependent on the particular modulation scheme employed
by the system. For instance, in an MC-CDMA system using an arbitrary modulation scheme, the
samples s[n, k] are complex-Gaussian distributed, having a Rayleigh-distributed amplitude |x[n, k]|
and uniformly distributed phase θ[n, k]. By contrast, in an M-PSK-modulated OFDM system the
samples s[n, k] are uniformly distributed within the set of M-PSK symbols having a constant amplitude
|s[n, k]| = σs and a discrete uniform distributed phase θ[n, k] = 2π(m/M), m = 0, 1, . . . , M −1.
Finally, the noise samples w[n, k] are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) complex-Gaussian
variables having a zero mean and a variance of σ2
w.
2The computational complexity associated with the prediction of the K CTF coefﬁcients is of order O(K2Nprd), where Nprd
is the order of the prediction ﬁlter. On the other hand, the CIR prediction combined with the FFT and IFFT operations can be
associated with the computational complexity of order O(K2
0Nprd +2K log2 K). It is evident that, in the typical case of Nprd <
K0 ≪K, the overall estimation complexity is reduced if the aforementioned method of the CIR prediction is employed.

Chapter 7. Channel Estimation for OFDM and MC-CDMA
Under the assumption of carrying out error-free decisions, we have ˆs[n, k] = s[n, k] and
Equation (7.5) may be simpliﬁed to
˜H[n, k] = y[n, k]
ˆs[n, k] = H[n, k] + w[n, k]
ˆs[n, k] .

The less ambiguous measure of the estimator’s performance is the Normalized Mean Square Er-

The AWGN samples w[n, k] are known to be i.i.d. complex-Gaussian and hence the MSE of
Equation (7.7) is determined by the statistical distribution of the transmitted subcarrier-related samples
s[n, k]. The NMSE encountered assumes its minimum value when |s[n, k]|2 = σ2

case of an M-PSK-modulated OFDM system. Thus, we have

is the average SNR level. On the other hand, the NMSE value will increase substantially if the energy
of the transmitted samples s[n, k] varies as in the case of M-ary Quadrature Amplitude Modulation
(M-QAM) based OFDM or MC-CDMA. In fact, in the case of strictly Gaussian-distributed samples
s[n, k], which corresponds to encountering an MC-CDMA system having a sufﬁciently long spreading
code, the NMSE value of Equation (7.8) does not exist, since the variance of the resultant Cauchy-
distributed variable associated with the ratio of two Gaussian-distributed variables s[n, k] and w[n, k]
of Equation (7.8) cannot be deﬁned [510]. The NMSE of the LS estimator of Equation (7.6) derived for
QPSK, 16-, 64- and 256-QAM-modulated OFDM, as well as QPSK-modulated MC-CDMA, is depicted
in Figure 7.2(a). The solid line in Figure 7.2(a) corresponds to the lower NMSE bound described by
Equation (7.9).
The performance degradation of the LS estimator of Equation (7.6) was imposed by the energy
ﬂuctuation of the near-Gaussian-distributed subcarrier-related samples s[n, k], which renders the LS
estimator inapplicable for employment in MC-CDMA systems. Therefore, to mitigate this performance
degradation we will turn our attention to the MMSE estimation approach.
7.3.2
MMSE CTF Estimator
In order to derive an FD-CTF estimator which is suitable for employment in an MC-CDMA system,
where the energy ﬂuctuation of the subcarrier-related samples s[n, k] is near Gaussian, we turn to the
MMSE approach. Following the Bayesian linear model theory of [330], the MMSE estimator of the FD-
CTF coefﬁcients H[n, k] of the scalar linear model described by Equation (1.14), where the parameters
H[n, k] are assumed to be complex-Gaussian distributed with a zero mean and a variance of σ2

where γ is the average SNR level deﬁned by Equation (7.10). As we have seen previously in the
context of Equation (7.12), the NMSE is determined by the statistical distribution of the transmitted
subcarrier-related samples s[n, k] and assumes its minimum value when the energy of these samples
|s[n, k]|2 = σ2
s is constant. On the other hand, in contrast to the NMSE of the LS estimator of
Equation (7.5), the NMSE of the MMSE estimator of Equation (7.11) is upper bounded, which is
evidenced by Figure 7.2(b). The NMSE assumes its maximum value when the samples s[n, k] are
complex-Gaussian distributed, as in the case of an MC-CDMA system having a sufﬁciently high

A Priori Predicted-Value-Aided CTF Estimator
In MC-CDMA systems employing spreading codes having a relatively low spreading factor G,
there is a ﬁnite probability of encountering zero-energy subcarrier-related samples s[n, k] = 0
when superimposing the chips of various users corresponding to the subcarrier considered. This
probability decreases with increasing spreading factor G as the corresponding power distribution
function approaches a Gaussian distribution. As can be seen from Equation (7.11), this will result in
a corresponding CTF coefﬁcient MMSE estimate ˜H[n, k] = 0, which is unrelated to the actual value
of H[n, k] encountered. This problem can be circumvented in the context of the DDCE scheme of
Figure 7.1, where the a priori predicted estimate of the subcarrier-related coefﬁcient H[n, k] is readily
available, by performing a Maximum Ratio Combining (MRC) of the a posteriori MMSE estimate
˜H[n, k] of Equation (7.11) and the corresponding a priori estimate ˇH[n, k]. It can be shown that the
resultant MRC-aided CTF estimator can be expressed as
˜H[n, k] =
ˇH[n, k] + ˆs∗[n, k]y[n, k]
1 + |ˆs[n, k]|2 + (K0/K)(σ2w/σ2
H).

In the following section we employ the following vectorial notation: v[n] = (v[n, 1], . . . , v[n, K])T.

A Posteriori CIR Estimation
7.4.1
MMSE SS-CIR Estimator
We will commence our portrayal of the proposed channel estimation philosophy by rendering the DDCE
OFDM scheme of [260, 265] as also applicable for employment in MC-CDMA with the derivation of
the a posteriori MMSE SS-CIR estimator of Figure 7.1.
By substituting the FD-CTF of Equation (1.7) into (1.14) we arrive at
y[n, k] =
K0−1

l=0
W kl
Kh[n, l]x[n, k] + w[n, k],
(7.16)
which can be expressed in matrix form as
y[n] = diag(x[n, k])W h[n] + w[n],
(7.17)
where we deﬁne the (K × K)-dimensional matrix diag(v[k]) as a diagonal matrix having the
corresponding elements of the vector v[k] on the main diagonal, as well as the (K×K0)-dimensional
Fourier transform matrix W , which corresponds to the Fourier transform of the zero-padded SS-CIR
vector h[n] and is deﬁned by Wkl = W kl
K for k = 0, 1, . . . , K −1 and l = 0, 1, . . . , K0 −1.
As before, the SS-CIR taps h[l] are assumed to be uncorrelated complex-Gaussian-distributed
variables having a zero mean and a covariance matrix given by
Ch = diag(σ2
l ).
(7.18)
The MMSE estimator of the SS-CIR taps h[n, l] of the linear vector model described by Equation (7.17)
is given by [330]

where we omit the time-domain OFDM-block-spaced index n for the sake of notational simplicity.
Following the assumptions made in Section 1.7.1 about the nature of the channel model considered,
some of the parameters σ2
l may assume a zero value. Hence to avoid division by zero, we rewrite
Equation (7.19) in a more practical form as follows:
ˆh = (σ2
wI + diag(σ2
l )W Hdiag(|ˆx[k]|2)W )−1
× diag(σ2
l )W Hdiag(ˆx∗[k])y.
(7.20)
The covariance matrix of the vector ˆh of the MMSE SS-CIR estimates can be expressed as [330]
Cˆh|ˆx =

I + diag
 σ2

W Hdiag(|ˆx[k]|2)W

(7.21)
The corresponding NMSE associated with the lth MMSE SS-CIR tap estimate ˆh[l] can be found
be approximating the lth diagonal element of the covariance matrix Cˆh|ˆx of Equation (7.21) and
normalizing it by the average channel output power σ2
H. The above-mentioned approximation is
performed by replacing the matrix diag(|ˆx[k]|2) in Equation (7.21) by its average value σ2
xI. Thus,
we arrive at
NMSE MMSE,l = σ2

(7.22)
The overall NMSE corresponding to the MMSE SS-CIR estimator of Equation (7.20) may be found by
summing all the lth NMSE contributions in Equation (7.22) over the K0 taps of the CIR encountered,
which can be expressed as
NMSE MMSE = 1

where, as before, K is the number of OFDM subcarriers and γ is the average SNR value, while L is
the number of non-zero SS-CIR taps encountered. The resultant NMSE described by Equation (7.23) is
depicted in Figure 7.3.
7.4.2
Reduced-Complexity SS-CIR Estimator
As can be seen from Equation (7.19), the direct MMSE approach to the problem of estimating
the SS-CIR taps h[n, l] involves a time-variant matrix inversion, which introduces a relatively high
computational complexity [265]. In order to reduce the associated computational complexity, we
introduce a two-step low-complexity SS-CIR estimator invoking an approach which bypasses the
computationally intensive matrix inversion operation encountered in Equation (7.19). We will show
that the method proposed ﬁrst employs a scalar MMSE estimator of the subcarrier-related FD-CTF
coefﬁcients H[n, k] of Equation (7.11), followed by a simpliﬁed MMSE SS-CIR estimator, which
exploits the average MSE expression of Equation (7.13) associated with the scalar MMSE FD-CTF
estimator of the ﬁrst processing step.
Following the Bayesian estimation theory of [330], the MMSE CTF estimates ˜HMMSE[n, k] of
Equation (7.11) may be modelled as complex-Gaussian-distributed variables having a mean identical
to that of H[n, k], which represents the actual FD-CTF coefﬁcients encountered, and a variance of
σ2
v = σ2

H is the average channel output power and NMSE max is the average

that the markers associated with the different modulation schemes and RC-MMSE estimator coincide.
NMSE quantiﬁed in Equation (7.13). Thus we can write
˜HMMSE[n, k] = H[n, k] + v[n, k],
(7.24)
where v[n, k] represents the i.i.d. complex-Gaussian noise samples having a zero mean and a variance
of σ2
v.
By substituting (1.8) into (7.24) we arrive at
˜HMMSE[n, k] =

Kh[n, k] + v[n, k],
(7.25)
where WK = e−2π(1/K), which can be rewritten in matrix form as

(7.26)

complex-Gaussian i.i.d. samples and therefore we have Cv = σ2
vI. On the other hand, as follows from
the assumption of having uncorrelated SS-CIR taps, the SS-CIR taps’ covariance matrix is a diagonal
matrix Ch = diag(σ2

to Equation (7.23) by summing all of the lth contributions quantiﬁed by Equation (7.31) over the K0

with complex-Gaussian-distributed transmitted samples x[n, k] typically encountered in an MC-CDMA
system having a high spreading factor. The resultant NMSE performance is depicted in Figure 7.3 using
a dashed line.

Chapter 7. Channel Estimation for OFDM and MC-CDMA
7.4.3
Complexity Study
As was shown in Section 7.3, the LS approach to the problem of DDCE-aided OFDM schemes [265]
is not suitable in the case of MC-CDMA systems. The MMSE approach of Section 7.4.1 constitutes
an appropriate solution; however, it exhibits a relatively high computational complexity imposed by
the evaluation and inversion of the (K0 × K0)-dimensional matrix (A + W Hdiag(|x[k]|2)W ) in
Equation (7.20). More explicitly, the MMSE SS-CIR estimator of Equation (7.20) has a computational
complexity of the order of O(K2K0 + KK2
0 + K3
0), where K is the number of OFDM subcarriers and
K0 is the number of SS-CIR taps encountered. By contrast, the RC SS-CIR estimator of Equation (7.30),
which avoids the matrix inversion operation, has a complexity of the order of O(K + K log2 K + K0),
which is similar to the complexity associated with the conventional LS estimator employed in [265].
It can be seen that the difference between the proposed estimation methods expressed in terms of the
associated computational complexity is substantial. In the next section we will derive an alternative RC-
MMSE estimator which is capable of estimating the FS-CIR taps of Equation (1.7) using an approach
similar to that described above.
7.4.4
MMSE FS-CIR Estimator
The ﬁrst constituent component of our estimator, namely the scalar MMSE CTF estimator, is identical
to that derived in Section 7.4.2 and described by Equation (7.11). Furthermore, our approach used for
deriving the MMSE FS-CIR estimator is similar to that utilized in Section 7.4.2, but it exhibits several
substantial differences, as detailed below.
By substituting the FD-CTF of Equation (1.7) into (7.24) we arrive at
˜H[n, k] = C(k∆f)
L

l=1
αl[n]W kτl/Ts

+ v[n, k],
(7.33)
where, as previously, C(f) is the frequency response of the transceiver’s pulse-shaping ﬁlter, WK ≜
e−2π(1/K), while αl[n] and τl are the amplitudes and the relative delays of the FS-CIR taps,
respectively. Equation (7.33) can be expressed in matrix form as
˜H[n] = diag(C[k])W α[n] + v[n]
= T α[n] + v[n],
(7.34)
where we deﬁne the (K×L)-dimensional matrix T ≜diag(C[k])W , in which diag(C[k]) is a (K×K)-
dimensional diagonal matrix with the corresponding elements of the vector C[k] on the main diagonal,
while W is the Fourier transform matrix deﬁned by Wkl ≜W kτl/Ts
K
for k = −K/2, . . . , K/2 −1
and l = 1, . . . , L.
The MMSE estimator of the FS-CIR taps αl[n] of the linear vector model described by (7.34) is
given by [330]
ˆα = (C−1
α + T HC−1
v T )−1T HC−1

(7.35)
where we omit the time-domain OFDM-block-spaced index n for the sake of notational simplicity and
deﬁne Cα and Cv as the covariance matrices of the FS-CIR vector α and CTF-estimator noise vector v,
respectively. The elements of the noise vector v are assumed to be i.i.d. complex-Gaussian-distributed
samples and therefore we have Cv = σ2
vI. On the other hand, as follows from Equation (1.1), the
FS-CIR taps’ covariance matrix is a diagonal matrix Ch = diag(σ2
l ), where σ2
l
≜E{|αl[n]|2}.
Substituting Cα and Cv into (7.35) yields

7.4.5. Performance Analysis
211
The matrix inversion operation associated with the process of evaluating the estimator matrix A
in Equation (7.36) cannot be avoided as opposed to the case of the SS-CIR estimation scheme of
Section 7.4.2. However, the estimator matrix A is data independent and may be calculated only once
for the case of encountering Wide-Sense Stationary (WSS) channel statistics. In the case of non-WSS
channels, where the average FS-CIR taps’ magnitudes σ2
l and the corresponding relative delays τl are
time variant, the estimator matrix A can be tracked using the low-complexity Projection Approximation
Subspace Tracking (PAST) techniques discussed for example in [355] and [511].
The corresponding covariance matrix associated with the FS-CIR estimate vector ˆα can be
expressed as in [330]
Cα = σ2

(7.38)
where tr(()A) is the trace of the matrix A.
7.4.5
Performance Analysis
The performance criteria NMSE h and NMSE α of Equations (7.32) and (7.38) respectively cannot be
compared directly, since they refer to the estimation processes of different sets of parameters, namely
the SS-CIR taps h[n, k], k = 0, . . . , K0 −1, and the FS-CIR taps αl[n], l = 1, . . . L. In order to
perform a meaningful comparison of the methods considered we used the NMSE between the two
CTFs corresponding to the encountered CIR and the estimated CIR, thus
NMSE H ≜E{|H[n, k] −ˆH[n, k]|2}.
(7.39)

The theoretical NMSE H performances of both the SS-CIR and the FS-CIR RC-MMSE estimators
discussed in Sections 7.4.2 and 7.4.4 and described by Equations (7.40) and (7.41) respectively are
depicted in Figure 7.4. As expected, the FS-CIR estimator exhibits a lower NMSE over the whole range
of the delay spread RMS values τrms, which demonstrates its robustness in severe channel conditions
exhibiting time-variant delay spread.
In this section, we present our simulation results for both the OFDM and the MC-CDMA systems
employing the channel estimation schemes considered.

Figure 7.4: Mean Square Error (MSE) exhibited by a posteriori SS- and FS-CIR-based CTF
estimators as a function of the channel’s sample-rate-normalized RMS delay value τrms/Ts. The
channel encountered corresponds to the eight-path Rayleigh-fading Bug’s channel model characterized
in [346] having a Gaussian noise variance of 10 dB. The results were evaluated from Equations (7.40)
and (7.41).
Our simulations were performed in the baseband frequency domain and the system conﬁguration
characterized in Table 7.1 is to a large extent similar to that used in [260]. We assume a total bandwidth
of 800 kHz. In the OFDM mode, the system utilizes 128-QPSK-modulated orthogonal subcarriers.
In the MC-CDMA mode we employ eight concatenated 16-chip Walsh–Hadamard (WH) codes for
frequency-domain interleaved spreading of the QPSK-modulated bits over the 8 · 16 = 128 orthogonal
subcarriers. All the 128 WH spreading codes, each constituted by eight interleaved groups of 16 codes,
are assigned to a single user and hence the effective data rate is similar in both the OFDM and MC-
CDMA modes. For Forward Error Correction (FEC) we use 1
2-rate turbo coding [314] employing two
constraint-length K = 3 Recursive Systematic Convolutional (RSC) component codes and the standard
124-bit WCDMA UMTS code interleaver of [512]. The octally represented RCS generator polynomials
of (7, 5) were used.
Firstly, we will demonstrate the achievable performance of the system considered under the
assumption of perfect channel knowledge, where knowledge of the frequency-domain subcarrier-related
coefﬁcients H[n, k] is available in the receiver. Figure 7.6 characterizes both (a) the uncoded and (b)
the turbo-coded Bit Error Rate (BER) exhibited by the QPSK-modulated OFDM and MC-CDMA
systems in conjunction with the three different channel models discussed in Section 1.7.1, namely the
SWATM channel [265], the COST207 BU channel [347] and Bug’s channel characterized in [346]. As
expected, in the uncoded OFDM scenario the achievable BER is similar to the BER associated with a
ﬂat Rayleigh-fading channel, regardless of the actual channel model encountered. This can be explained
by the fact that the uncoded OFDM system effectively experiences ﬂat Rayleigh fading on each
frequency-domain subcarrier. In an uncoded OFDM system the adjacent information-carrying symbols
are demodulated independently and thus the associated system’s BER performance is dominated by the
error rates associated with the severely faded subcarriers. In other words, such a system is incapable
of exploiting the potential frequency-domain diversity gains available in the dispersive channel, as
discussed in Section 1.8.2. By contrast, the uncoded MC-CDMA system avoids this phenomenon with
the aid of frequency-domain spreading of the information-carrying symbols. Furthermore, different
channel models characterized by different PDPs result in different potential frequency-domain diversity

gains. As illustrated in Figure 1.10, the SWATM channel model is characterized by a CIR having three
taps, where most of the signal power is accommodated by the ﬁrst tap, hence it behaves similar to a
non-dispersive channel and results in a relatively low potential frequency diversity gain, as conﬁrmed
by the results depicted in Figure 7.6. By contrast, both the COST207 BU and Bug’s channel models
have seven- and eight-tap CIRs respectively and thus allow the MC-CDMA system to beneﬁt from a
relatively high frequency diversity gain. Similar conclusions can be inferred from Figure 7.6(b), where
both the OFDM and MC-CDMA systems beneﬁt from the available frequency diversity gain with the
aid of turbo coding. It can be seen in Figure 7.6(b) that the MC-CDMA system slightly outperforms its
OFDM counterpart as a result of averaging the error effects with the aid of frequency-domain spreading
of the information-carrying symbols.

RC-MMSE SS-CIR Estimator Performance
Here we employed the eight-path Rayleigh-fading Bug channel model characterized in [346], using the
delay spread of τrms = 1 µs and the OFDM-symbol-normalized Doppler frequency of fD = 0.01.

Figure 7.7(a) characterizes the NMSE exhibited by the DDCE scheme of Figure 7.1 using both
the full-complexity MMSE SS-CIR estimator and the RC-MMSE SS-CIR estimator of Sections 7.4.1
and 7.4.2, respectively. Furthermore, the achievable turbo-coded BER of the corresponding QPSK-
modulated OFDM and MC-CDMA systems is depicted in Figure 7.7(b). The simulations were carried
out over the period of 100 000 QPSK-modulated K = 128-subcarrier OFDM/MC-CDMA symbols.
It can be seen in Figure 7.7(a) that the RC-MMSE method outperforms its MMSE counterpart in
the context of both the OFDM and MC-CDMA systems considered. This result can be explained by
the fact that in our RC-MMSE CIR estimator we employ the MRC-aided MMSE CTF estimator of
Equation (7.15), which takes advantage of the available a priori predicted CTF estimates ˇH[n, k] and
enhances the performance of the RC-MMSE CIR estimator in comparison with the pure a posteriori full-
complexity MMSE CIR estimator of Section 7.4.1. Moreover, as becomes evident from Figure 7.7(b),
the MMSE/RC-MMSE SS-CIR operating in the context of the MC-CDMA system outperforms its
OFDM counterpart.
7.4.5.2
Fractionally Spaced CIR Estimator Performance
In this section we consider the achievable performance of our DDCE scheme employing both the SS-
CIR RC-MMSE estimator of Section 7.4.2 and the Fractionally Spaced RC-MMSE CIR estimator
advocated in Section 7.4.4 in the context of both OFDM and MC-CDMA systems communicating
over Bug’s eight-path dispersive Rayleigh-fading channel characterized in [346]. Here we employ an
FS-CIR as opposed to the SS-CIR considered in Section 7.4.5.1. Their difference may be informally
assessed with the aid of Figure 7.5.
Figure 7.8(a) portrays the NMSE exhibited by the DDCE scheme of Figure 7.1 employing both the
SS-CIR estimator described in Section 7.4.2 and that of the FS-CIR estimator derived in Section 7.4.4
in the context of both the OFDM and MC-CDMA systems considered. The corresponding achievable
BER performance is depicted in Figure 7.8(b). The simulations were carried out over the period of
100 000 QPSK-modulated K = 128-subcarrier OFDM/MC-CDMA symbols. Comparing the results of
Figures 7.7 and 7.8, we may conclude that the DDCE employing the a posteriori SS-CIR RC-MMSE

Mean Square Error (MMSE) and the Reduced-Complexity MMSE a posteriori SS-CIR estimators of
Equations (7.19) and (7.27), respectively. The a priori prediction is performed using the robust SS-
CIR predictor [265] assuming matching propagation conditions described by the COST207 BU channel

method suffers from a substantial performance degradation when assessed in conjunction with the
channel characterized by an FS-CIR. Furthermore, the DDCE scheme utilizing the SS-CIR estimator
for communicating over a channel characterized by an FS-CIR exhibits an irreducible noise ﬂoor
at high SNR values. In order to explain this result we will refer to the leakage effect discussed in
Section 1.7.1 and illustrated in Figure 1.12. Let us recall that a channel characterized by an FS-
PDP results in numerous correlated non-zero SS-CIR taps. As a result, the a priori CIR predictor of
Section 7.6 designed to track and predict a relatively low number of non-zero uncorrelated CIR taps fails
to exploit the leakage-induced correlation observed between the adjacent SS-CIR taps. Furthermore,
the correlation of the SS-CIR taps becomes different from the time-domain correlation model assumed
during the predictor design and described in Section 1.7.1, which results in a biased channel estimation
process. On the other hand, as can be seen in Figure 7.8, the DDCE employing the a posteriori FS-CIR
RC-MMSE method of Section 7.4.2 does not experience any performance degradation and outperforms
its SS-CIR estimator-based counterpart over the entire range of the SNR values considered. In addition,
the achievable NMSE of the DDCE employed in an OFDM system is slightly lower than that exhibited
by its MC-CDMA counterpart. This effect is caused by the energy distribution of the subcarrier-related
samples x[n, k] used in the channel estimation process. This effect was discussed in Section 7.4 and is
illustrated in Figure 7.3.
This conclusion is further substantiated by Figure 7.9, where both the NMSE performance of the
channel estimator schemes considered and the corresponding achievable BER performance of the MC-
CDMA system are plotted as a function of the channel’s Root Mean Square (RMS) delay spread value
τrms. It can be seen in Figure 7.9(a) that the NMSE performance of the SS-CIR estimator-based DDCE
scheme exhibits substantial sensitivity to the channel’s delay spread, which is also conﬁrmed by the
theoretical results depicted in Figure 7.4. This effect can be explained by the fact that the SS-CIR
estimator estimates the projections of the actual FS-CIR taps onto the adjacent SS-CIR taps. As can

be seen in Figure 7.4, the accuracy of this process is highly sensitive to the delays and the amplitudes
of the actual FS-CIR taps encountered. Furthermore, as the channel’s RMS delay spread increases,
the number of effective non-zero SS-CIR taps increases and hence the associated estimation accuracy
degrades. On the other hand, the a posteriori FS-CIR estimator exhibits a higher robustness against the
channel’s delay spread variations, since the channel estimator tends to estimate only the actual FS-CIR
taps encountered regardless of the speciﬁc values of the RMS delay spread. Additionally, as expected,
the corresponding BER of the MC-CDMA system increases upon increasing the RMS delay spread
τrms, because the frequency diversity rank tends to increase when τrms increases.

Parametric FS-CIR Estimation

Projection Approximation Subspace Tracking
Let H[n] ∈CK be the vector of the subcarrier-related CTF coefﬁcients associated with the channel
model of Equation (1.14). As described in Section 1.7.1, the CIR associated with the CTF coefﬁcient
vector H[n] is constituted by a relatively low number of L ≪K statistically independent Rayleigh-
fading paths. The corresponding CIR components are related to the CTF coefﬁcients H[n, k] by means
of Equation (1.7). The motivation for employing the so-called subspace technique [513] here is that
usually we have L ≪K and thus it is more efﬁcient to estimate a low number of CIR-related taps in
the low-dimensional signal subspace than estimating all the K FD-CTF coefﬁcients.
Let λl and ul be the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors of the CTF’s covariance matrix
CH, which is deﬁned as follows:
CH = E
n {H[n]HH[n]}.
(7.42)
Then, CH = UΣU H, where Σ = diag(λl) and U = [u1 . . . uK].

The eigenvalues aligned in a descending order may be expressed as
λ1 ≥· · · ≥λL > λL+1 = · · · = λK = σ2
w,
(7.43)
where the ﬁrst L dominant eigenvalues λ1, . . . , λL in conjunction with the L corresponding eigen-
vectors u1, . . . , uL may be termed the signal eigenvalues and eigenvectors, respectively [355]. The
remaining eigenvalues λL+1, . . . , λK and eigenvectors uL+1, . . . , uK are termed the noise eigenvalues
and eigenvectors. The resultant sets of signal and noise eigenvectors, which are column vectors, span
the mutually orthogonal signal and noise subspaces US and UN, such that
U S = [u1, . . . , uL]
and
U N = [uL+1, . . . , uK].
(7.44)
The corresponding time-domain-related L-tap estimate of the FS-CIR vector α[n] may be obtained as
follows:
ˆα = U H
S[n] ˜
H[n].
(7.45)
Furthermore, the reduced-noise estimate of the CTF vector H[n] may reconstructed using
ˆH[n] = U S[n]ˆα[n].
(7.46)
To evaluate and track the potentially time-variant signal subspace U S[n] we employ the subspace
tracking method developed by Yang [355]. More speciﬁcally, we consider the following real-valued
scalar objective function having the matrix argument of W ∈CK×L:
J(W ) = E{∥H −W W HH∥2}
= tr(CH) −2 tr(W HCHW ) + tr(W HCHW · W HW ).
(7.47)
As demonstrated by Yang in [355], the objective function J(W ) of Equation (7.47) exhibits the
following important properties:

218
Chapter 7. Channel Estimation for OFDM and MC-CDMA
1. W is a stationary point of J(W ) if and only if W = U LQ, where U L ∈CK×L contains any
L distinct eigenvectors of CH and Q ∈CL×L is an arbitrary unitary matrix. Furthermore, at
each stationary point, J(W ) equals the sum of these particular eigenvalues, whose eigenvectors
are not involved in U L [355, Theorem 1].
2. All stationary points of J(W ) are local saddle points except when U L contains the L dominant
eigenvectors of CH. In this case, J(W ) attains the global minimum [355, Theorem 2].
3. The global convergence of W is guaranteed by using iterative minimization of J(W ) and the
columns of the resultant value of W will span the signal subspace of CH.
4. The use of an iterative algorithm to minimize J(W ) will always converge to an orthonormal
basis of the signal subspace of CH without invoking any orthonormalization operations during
the iterations.
5. The global minimum of J(W ), W , does not necessarily contain the signal eigenvectors, but
an arbitrary orthogonal basis of the signal subspace of CH as indicated by the unitary matrix
Q introduced in Property 1. In other words, W = arg min J(W ) if and only if W = U SQ,
where Q is an arbitrary unitary matrix.
6. For the simple scalar case of L = 1, the solution minimizing J(W ) is given by the most
dominant normalized eigenvector of CH.
Subsequently, Yang [355] proposes an iterative RLS algorithm for tracking the signal subspace of the
channel’s covariance matrix CH. Speciﬁcally, upon replacing the expectation value in Equation (7.47)
by the exponentially weighted sum of the RLS algorithm, we arrive at the following new objective
function:
J(W [n]) =
n

i=1
ηn−i∥H[i] −W [n]W H[n]H[i]∥2
= tr(CH) −2 tr(W H[n]CH[n]W [n])
+ tr(W H[n]CH[n]W [n] · W H[n]W [n]),
(7.48)
where η ∈(0, 1) is the so-called forgetting factor, which accounts for possible deviations of the actual
channel statistics encountered from the WSS assumption. Observe that the sole difference between the
objective functions of Equations (7.47) and (7.48) is the introduction of the time-variant exponentially
weighted sample covariance matrix [355], which may be expressed as
CH[n] =
n

m=1
ηn−mH[m]HH[m] = ηCH[n −1] + H[n]HH[n]
(7.49)
instead of the time-invariant matrix CH = E{HHH} of Equation (7.42).
The PAST algorithm may be derived by approximating the expression W H[n]H[m] in Equa-
tion (7.48), which may be interpreted as a projection of the vector H[m] onto the column space of
the matrix W [n], by the readily available a posteriori vector α[m] = W H[m]H[m]. The resultant
modiﬁed cost function may be formulated as
J′(W [n]) =
n

m=1
ηn−m∥H[m] −W [n]α[m]∥2.
(7.50)
As is argued in [355], for stationary or slowly varying signals, the aforementioned projection
approximation, hence the name PAST, does not substantially change the error surface associated with
the corresponding cost function of Equation (7.50) and therefore does not signiﬁcantly affect the
convergence properties of the derived algorithm.

7.5.1. Projection Approximation Subspace Tracking
219
Similar to other RLS estimation schemes [292,330], the cost function J′(W [n]) is minimized if
W = CHα[n]C−1
αα[n],
(7.51)
where
CHα[n] =
n

i=1
ηn−iH[i]αH[i] = ηCHα[n −1] + H[n]αH[n]
(7.52)
and
Cαα[n] =
n

i=1
ηn−iα[i]αH[i] = ηCαα[n −1] + α[n]αH[n].
(7.53)
Following the RLS approach [355], a low-complexity solution of the computational problem associated
with minimizing the cost function J′(W [n]) of Equation (7.50) may be obtained using recursive
updates of the matrix W [n]. More speciﬁcally, we have
W [n] = W [n −1] + e[n]kH[n],
(7.54)
where e[n] is the estimation error vector, which may be recursively obtained as
e[n] = H[n] −W [n −1]α[n −1],
(7.55)
while
k[n] =
P [n −1]α[n]
η + αH[n]P [n −1]α[n]
(7.56)
denotes the RLS gain vector. Furthermore, the matrix P [n] is the inverse of the CIR-related taps’
(L × L)-dimensional covariance matrix Cαα, which can be recursively calculated as follows:
P [n] = 1
η Tri{(I −k[n]αH[n])P [n −1]},
(7.57)
where the operator Tri{·} indicates that only the upper triangular part of P[n] is calculated and its
Hermitian conjugate version is copied to the lower triangular part [355]. The resultant PAST algorithm
is summarized in Algorithm 7.1, where we introduced an additional quantity g[n] = P [n −1]H[n] to
reduce the associated complexity further.

Deﬂation PAST
In this work, however, we aim at maintaining the lowest possible complexity, hence we are particularly
interested in the deﬂation-based version of the PAST algorithm derived in [355], which is referred to as
the PASTD algorithm. The simple philosophy of the deﬂation method is the sequential estimation of the
principal components of the CTF covariance matrix CH [514]. Consequently, we ﬁrst update the most
dominant eigenvector w1[n] by applying the PAST method of Algorithm 7.1 in conjunction with L = 1.
Subsequently, the projection of the current sample vector H[n] onto the updated eigenvector w1[n] is
subtracted from itself, resulting in a modiﬁed (deﬂated) version of the CTF vector in the following form:
H2[n] = H[n] −w1[n]wH
1[n]H[n]. The second most dominant eigenvector w2[n] has now become
the most dominant one and therefore may be updated similarly to w1[n]. By repeatedly applying this
procedure, all the desired eigencomponents may be estimated.
The resultant PASTD method is summarized in Algorithm 7.2. Observe that Equations (7.60b–
f) of Algorithm 7.2 constitute the PAST estimation procedure of Algorithm 7.1 in conjunction with
L = 1. Note that the vector expressions of Equations (7.58b–d) in Algorithm 7.1 are substituted by the
simple scalar expression of Equation (7.60c), where the new quantity λl[n] constitutes an exponentially
weighted estimate of the corresponding lth eigenvalue and can be identiﬁed as a scalar version of the
(L × L)-dimensional covariance matrix Cαα[n] = P −1[n] of Algorithm 7.1.
A particularly important property of the PASTD method of Algorithm 7.2 is that, as opposed to the
PAST method of Algorithm 7.1, it enables the explicit tracking of the time-variant eigencomponents of
the channel covariance matrix CH[n], namely the eigenvectors wl[n], as well as of the corresponding
eigenvalues λl[n] according to
wl[n] = wl[n −1] + α∗
l [n]
λl[n] (Hl[n] −wl[n −1]αl[n]),

PASTD-Aided FS-CIR Estimation
In this section we will utilize the PASTD method detailed in Section 7.5.2 in the context of the
channel estimation scheme characterized by Figure 7.1. More speciﬁcally, we consider a PASTD-aided
a posteriori FS-CIR estimator which corresponds to the CIR estimator module of Figure 7.1. In order
to analyse the achievable performance of the CIR estimator derived, we conceive a channel estimation
scheme comprising the MMSE CTF estimator of Section 7.3.2 followed by the PASTD-aided CIR
estimator of Section 7.5.2.

frequencies of (a) fD = 0.001 and (b) fD = 0.005. The abscissa represents the average SNR recorded
at the receive antenna elements.
The achievable performance of the subspace tracking method of Section 7.5.2 is characterized in
Figures 7.11 and 7.12, where we deﬁne the MSE performance criterion as follows:
MSE = E

,
(7.61)
where el is the FD-CTF tracking error deﬁned by Equation 7.55. In our simulations we consider an
OFDM system having K = 128 orthogonal QPSK-modulated subcarriers. The system characteristics
are outlined in Table 1.11. We employ an OFDM-frame-variant channel model having a time-variant
eight-tap PDP characterized by the COST207 BU channel model [347], as detailed in Section 1.7.2.
Additionally, each individual propagation path undergoes fast Rayleigh fading with a corresponding
OFDM-symbol-normalized Doppler frequency of either fD = 0.001 or fD = 0.005. The resultant
channel can be characterized as a multi-path Rayleigh-fading channel with slowly varying PDP, where
the relative delays τl associated with different PDP taps vary with time at a rate determined by the drift
rate parameter ντ deﬁned in Section 1.7.2.
Firstly, Figure 7.10 characterizes the achievable FD-CTF MSE performance of the PASTD method
of Algorithm 7.2 for different ranks L of the estimated subspace, while assuming a constant value of
η = 0.95 for the forgetting factor. Figures 7.10(a) and 7.10(b) correspond to encountering the Doppler
frequencies of fD = 0.001 and 0.005, respectively. From Figure 7.10, we may conclude that a high
CIR estimator performance may be achieved when assuming that the estimated CTF signal subspace
has a rank of L = 4, regardless of the actual number of paths constituting the multi-path channel
encountered.
Secondly, Figure 7.11 characterizes the achievable MSE performance of the PASTD method of
Algorithm 7.2 for different values of the forgetting factor η, while assuming a constant rank of L = 4 for

of fD = 0.001 and 0.005, respectively. As may be concluded from Figure 7.11, the optimum value of
the forgetting factor η is largely dependent on the SNR as well as on the Doppler frequency encountered.
Nevertheless, the compromise value of η = 0.95 appears to constitute a relatively good choice in the
practical ranges of both SNR values and Doppler frequencies.
Finally, Figure 7.12 characterizes the achievable MSE performance of the PASTD method
of Algorithm 7.2 for different values of the OFDM-symbol-normalized PDP tap drift rate ντ.
Figures 7.12(a) and 7.12(b) correspond to encountering the Doppler frequencies of fD = 0.001
and 0.005, respectively. Observe that the speciﬁc values of the parameter ντ assumed in Figure 7.12
substantially exceed the maximum value considered in the baseline scenario outlined in Table 1.11.
Consequently, we may conclude that the CIR tracking method of Algorithm 7.2 exhibits an adequate
performance over the entire range of practical channel conditions.
In order to complete the design of the DDCE scheme of Figure 7.1 we employ an a priori CIR
predictor [265]. The CIR-related tap predictor considered can be employed in conjunction with both
the SS-CIR and the FS-CIR estimators of Sections 7.4.2 and 7.4.4, as well as in combination with the
parametric PASTD-aided CIR estimator of Section 7.5.2. Observe, however, that the low-rank PASTD-
aided CIR estimator of Section 7.5.2 will require the prediction of a substantially lower number of
L ≪K0 CIR-related taps. More speciﬁcally, in the case of the system characterized by Table 1.11, the
SS-CIR estimator of Section 7.4.2 will require the prediction of K0 = 32 SS-CIR taps. This should be
contrasted to the PASTD-aided CIR estimator of Section 7.5.2, which will require the prediction of only
L = 4 FS-CIR-related taps, regardless of the actual number of paths encountered.
In the next section we present an overview of the major CIR tap prediction methods discussed in
the literature [260, 265, 292, 293]. We analyse the achievable performance of each method with the
aid of extensive simulations and conduct a comparative study aimed at identifying the most promising
approaches.
7.6
Time-Domain A Priori CIR Tap Prediction
The philosophy of the a priori CIR predictor considered is illustrated in Figure 7.13. Our aim is to
predict the SS/FS-CIR taps {α1[n + 1], . . . , αL[n + 1]} associated with the future channel conditions,
given the history of the previous CIRs, namely the a posteriori estimates {{ˆαl[n]}, {ˆαl[n −1]}, . . .}.

7.6.1
MMSE Predictor
As portrayed in Section 1.7.1, the lth CIR component αl[n] undergoes a narrowband time-domain
fading process characterized by the associated cross-correlation properties, which can be described by
E{α∗
l [n]αl′[n −m]} = rt[m]δ[l −l′],
(7.62)
where rt[n] is the corresponding time-domain correlation function and δ[·] is the Kronecker delta
function.
This WSS narrowband process can be approximately modelled as a Finite Impulse Response (FIR)
auto-regressive process of the order Nprd [265], yielding
αl[n + 1] =
Nprd−1

m=0
q[m]αl[n −m] + vl[n + 1],
(7.63)
where q[m] represents the auto-regressive coefﬁcients and vl[n] is the model noise.
Let us deﬁne the following column vectors:
αl[n] = (αl[n], αl[n −1], . . . , αl[n −Nprd + 1])T
q = (q[0], q[1], . . . , q[Nprd −1])T
(7.64)
and rewrite Equation (7.63) in vectorial form as
αl[n + 1] = αl[n]Tq + v[n + 1].
(7.65)
Left-multiplying both sides of (7.65) by the complex conjugate of the column vector αl[n, l] and
obtaining the expectation value over the time-domain index n yields
E{α∗
l [n]αl[n + 1]} = E{α∗
l [n](αT
l[n]q + v[n + 1])},
(7.66)
which can be represented as a set of Yule–Walker equations in the following form [515]:
rapr = Rl;aptql,
(7.67)
where the vector rapr is the autocorrelation vector of the predicted a priori CIR taps deﬁned by
rapr = 1
σ2
l
E{α∗
l [n]αl[n + 1]},
(7.68)
and the matrix Rapt is the autocorrelation matrix of the a posteriori CIR taps described in [265]
Rl;apt = 1
σ2
l
E{ˆαl[n]ˆαH

= Rapr + ρlI,
(7.69)
where
Rapr = 1
σ2
l
E{αl[n]αH

(7.70)
and ρl is the parameter determined by the variance of the effective estimation noise imposed by the
a posteriori CIR estimator employed, σ2
apt, as well as the expectation magnitude of the CIR tap predicted
σ2
l , such that ρl = σ2
apt/σ2
l .
The optimal solution of Equation (7.67) evaluated in the MSE sense is given by
ql;prd = R−1
l;aptrapr.
(7.71)

7.6.2. Robust Predictor
225
In the speciﬁc scenario when the channel is described by Jakes’ model [349], the a priori autocorrelation
vector rapr can be formulated as rapr[n] = rJ[n] = J0(2πfDn), n = 1, 2, . . . , Nprd, where J0(x)
is a zero-order Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind. The corresponding a posteriori autocorrelation matrix
Rapr is given by Rapr[n, m] = rJ[n −m] + ρδ[n −m], n, m = 0, 1, . . . , Nprd −1, while the CIR
predictor’s coefﬁcient vector is described by (7.71) and the prediction is performed according to
ˇαl[n + 1] = qT
l;prd ˆαl[n],
l = 1, 2, . . . , L.
(7.72)
The corresponding performance can be characterized using the frequency-domain NMSE criterion as
derived in [265]
NMSE H;apr =
1
σ2
H
E{|H[n, k] −ˇH[n, k]|2},
(7.73)
where H[n, k] and ˇH[n, k] are the CTFs corresponding to the encountered CIR and the a priori
predicted CIR ˇαl[n], respectively. From [265] we have
NMSE H;apr =



(7.74)
where
MSE l;apr = σ2

(7.75)
The attainable NMSE performance of the a priori CIR predictor of Equation (7.72), evaluated for
the scenario when the Doppler frequency assumed in the design of the receiver matches the actual
Doppler frequency encountered, i.e. when fD = fD;prd, is depicted in Figures 7.14 and 7.15. More
speciﬁcally, in Figure 7.14 we demonstrate the NMSE of the CIR prediction method considered using
a prediction ﬁlter of length Nprd = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64 as a function of the average SNR recorded
at the receive antenna. As expected, the performance of the estimator improves when the prediction
ﬁlter length Nprd increases, although the corresponding additional NMSE reduction becomes more
modest for high values of the prediction ﬁlter length and hence a trade-off between the desired NMSE
performance and the associated computational complexity has to be found. A similar system behaviour
can be observed in Figure 7.15, where the NMSE is evaluated as a function of the OFDM-symbol-
normalized Doppler frequency fD.
7.6.2
Robust Predictor
The CIR tap prediction process described in the previous section exhibits a high CIR tap estimation
performance under the assumption of perfect knowledge of the channel statistics. However, it suffers
from a signiﬁcant performance degradation when the actual channel statistics deviate from the model
assumed, such as for example Jakes’ model. The issue of statistical mismatch becomes increasingly
detrimental in diverse wireless environments, where the channel conditions and the corresponding
statistics are time dependent and cannot be assumed to be WSS.
As shown in [260] and [265], the MSE exhibited by the linear CIR predictor of (7.72) is upper
bounded by the MSE encountered when communicating over an ideally band-limited channel having a
perfect low-pass Doppler PSD function given by
pB;unif(f) =

1/2fD,
if |f| < fD
0,
otherwise.
(7.76)
Hence, we arrive at the concept of designing Li’s [260] so-called robust linear predictor [265], which
assumes encountering the worst-possible channel statistics. As pointed out in [267], such a robust
channel predictor, optimized for the worst-case PSD of Equation (7.76), can be designed by using

where we have n, m = 0, 1, . . . Nprd −1.
In Figure 7.16 we characterize the attainable NMSE performance of the robust a priori CIR
predictor of Equation (7.72) for the scenario when the Doppler frequency fD;prd assumed in the design
of the receiver does not match the actual Doppler frequency fD encountered. It can be seen that the
estimation method considered is robust against a mismatch between the assumed and the encountered
Doppler frequency, as long as the encountered Doppler frequency does not exceed the assumed value,
i.e. as long as fD ≤fD;prd.

MMSE Versus Robust Predictor Performance Comparison
The achievable performance of the DDCE scheme of Figure 7.1 employing the robust a priori
CIR predictor of Section 7.6.2 under matched time-domain correlation conditions is quantiﬁed
in Figure 7.17, when the assumed OFDM-symbol-normalized Doppler frequency fD;prd matches
the actual value encountered. The NMSE exhibited by the channel estimation scheme considered
is depicted in Figure 7.17(a), while the corresponding BER exhibited by the turbo-coded QPSK-
modulated MC-CDMA system is shown in Figure 7.17(b). It can be seen that, while the estimation

accuracy decreases upon increasing the Doppler frequency, the corresponding BER performance
remains relatively unaffected.
Finally, Figure 7.18 illustrates the achievable performance of QPSK-modulated MC-CDMA
employing the DDCE scheme of Figure 7.1 under unmatched time correlation conditions. Our
simulations were performed at a constant value of the OFDM-symbol-normalized Doppler frequency
assumed at the receiver, i.e. at fD;prd = 0.03. Furthermore, four different values of the actual
normalized Doppler frequencies were used, i.e. fD = 0.03, 0.01, 0.003 and 0.001. Figure 7.18(a)
characterizes the NMSE performance of the DDCE scheme employed by the MC-CDMA system
considered, while the corresponding turbo-coded BER is depicted in Figure 7.18(b). The achievable
BER performance in the case of perfect Channel State Information (CSI), i.e. when the CTF is perfectly
known at the receiver, is also depicted in Figure 7.18(a). It can be seen that the performance of the
CIR predictor advocated is indeed tolerant to the mismatch of the actual Doppler frequency and that
assumed during the predictor design, as long as the actual Doppler frequency does not exceed the value
assumed in the predictor’s design. Furthermore, the results depicted in Figure 7.18(a) substantiate our
conclusion that the performance of the MC-CDMA system employing the channel estimation scheme
of Figure 7.1 closely approaches the corresponding performance of the MC-CDMA system in the case
of perfect CTF knowledge at the receiver. More explicitly, the BER performance corresponding to the
different values of the Doppler frequency fD fall within 1 dB of the BER performance associated with
the perfect CSI scenario.
7.6.4
Adaptive RLS Predictor
On the other hand, in the RLS-based adaptive CIR tap prediction approach of [292,293], no assumptions
were made concerning the channel’s stationarity. The RLS estimation procedure is summarized in

The assumed Doppler frequencies of (a) fD = 0.03 and (b) 0.003 have been considered and different

considered. The results were evaluated from Equation (7.74).

the fading process encountered from the WSS assumption. The resultant recursive update for ql[n] is
given by

relatively high performance, as long as the actual Doppler frequency encountered does not exceed that
assumed. Finally, the RLS CIR predictor, which does not require any explicit knowledge concerning
the channel statistics, exhibits a near-optimum performance over the entire range of the values of fD.
Furthermore, Figure 7.20 illustrates the achievable MSE performance of the CIR prediction methods
considered as a function of the SNR encountered. Once again, the MMSE CIR predictor exhibits the
highest achievable performance. The robust CIR predictor exhibits a relatively high performance, as
long as the SNR encountered does not exceed the value 1/ρ assumed. On the other hand, the RLS
predictor exhibits a near-optimum performance over the whole range of the SNR values. Additionally,
the order of the computational complexity associated with both CIR predictors considered in the context
of a DDCE-OFDM system and quantiﬁed in terms of the total number of complex multiplications
and additions per OFDM symbol may be expressed as O(K log2 K + LNprd) and O(K log2 K +

order of complexity imposed by the RLS CIR predictor is only slightly higher than that associated with
the Robust CIR predictor.

module consists of the instantaneous CIR-related tap estimates ˆαl[n] and the corresponding estimate
of the transformation matrix W [n] of Equation (7.54). The CIR-related estimate vector ˆαl[n] is then
fed into the low-rank time-domain CIR-related tap predictor of Figure 7.21 to produce an a priori
estimate ˇαl[n + 1], l = 1, . . . , L, of the next CIR-related tap vector on a tap-by-tap basis [265].
Finally, the predicted CIR is converted to the subcarrier-related CTF with the aid of the transformation
matrix W [n] provided by the PASTD module of Figure 7.21. The resultant FD-CTF is employed by the
receiver to detect and decode the next OFDM symbol. Note that this principle requires the transmission
of a frequency-domain pilot-based channel sounding sequence, such as for example a pilot-assisted
OFDM symbol, during the initialization stage. The operation of the resultant DDCE scheme illustrated
in Figure 7.21 is summarized in Algorithm 7.4.
In order to characterize the performance of the resultant channel estimation scheme, we will
introduce an estimation efﬁciency criterion κ, which is deﬁned as follows:
κ =
1
σ2eγ
L
K ,
(7.85)
where σ2
e and γ are the estimation MSE and SNR, respectively, while K and L are the number of
OFDM subcarriers and the number of estimated CIR taps.
The achievable performance of the PASTD-aided DDCE scheme of Algorithm 7.4 is characterized
in Figure 7.22. In our simulations we considered an OFDM system having K
= 128 QPSK-
modulated orthogonal subcarriers. The system characteristics are outlined in Table 1.11. We employ
an OFDM-frame-variant channel model associated with a time-variant seven-tap PDP characterized
by the COST207 BU channel model [347], as detailed in Section 1.7.2. Additionally, each individual
propagation path undergoes fast Rayleigh fading having an OFDM-symbol-normalized Doppler
frequency of fD = 0.003. We assumed the values L = 4 and η = 0.95 for the PASTD module-
related subspace rank and forgetting factor parameters respectively, as well as the value of β = 0.9 for
the RLS CIR tap predictor-related forgetting factor.
Figure 7.22(a) portrays the achievable MSE performance of the PASTD-aided DDCE scheme of
Algorithm 7.4 for the pilot overhead ratios ε = 0.03, 0.1, 0.3 and 1.0, where ε = 0.03 and ε = 1.0
correspond to having 3% and 100% pilots, respectively. Speciﬁcally, we may identify an estimation
efﬁciency of κ = 5 −10 = −5 dB.
Furthermore, Figure 7.22(b) portrays the corresponding BER performance of the rate 1

QPSK-modulated OFDM system.

Channel Estimation for MIMO-OFDM
The main challenge associated with the estimation of the MIMO-CTF coefﬁcients in the context of
multi-antenna, multi-carrier systems resides in the fact that, as opposed to the SISO scenario outlined
in Section 7.3.2, the estimation of the MIMO-CTFs constitutes a highly rank-deﬁcient problem. More
speciﬁcally, let us consider the SDM-OFDM system model associated with the kth subcarrier of the nth
SDM-OFDM symbol, which may be characterized as follows:
y[n, k] = H[n, k]s[n, k] + w[n, k],
(7.86)
where s[n, k], y[n, k], w[n, k] and H[n, k] are the signals associated with the kth subcarrier of the nth
SDM-OFDM symbol. Speciﬁcally, s[n, k] is the mt-dimensional signal vector transmitted from the
mt transmit antennas, y[n, k] and w[n, k] are the nr-dimensional signal and noise vectors recorded at
the nr receive antennas, while H[n, k] is the (nr × mt)-dimensional matrix which characterizes the
MIMO-CTFs encountered. Let us assume a relatively simple MIMO scenario of mt = nr = 4 transmit
and receive antennas. The corresponding MIMO-CTF matrix is constituted by 4 × 4 = 16 uncorrelated
coefﬁcients, which have to be calculated using four recorded samples comprising the received signal
y[n, k], as well as four pilots or decision-based symbols estimating the transmitted signal s[n, k]. Notice
that even in the presence of the a priori known pilot-based transmitted signal s[n, k], the MIMO-CTF
matrix H[n, k] may not be estimated reliably using a linear solution reminiscent of that derived in
Section 7.3.2. Consequently, the estimation of the (nr × mt)-dimensional MIMO-CTF matrix H[n, k]
requires a sufﬁciently sophisticated exploitation of both the time- and the frequency-domain correlation
properties of the MIMO-CTF coefﬁcients.
In this treatise we propose a MIMO channel estimation scheme which follows the DDCE
philosophy of Figure 7.1, as employed in Section 7.2 for SISO multi-carrier systems.
Similar to the SISO case of Section 7.2, our MIMO channel estimation scheme comprises an array
of K per-subcarrier MIMO-CTF estimators, followed by an (nr ×mt)-dimensional array of parametric
CIR estimators and a corresponding array of (nr × mt × L) CIR tap predictors, where L is the number
of tracked CIR taps per link for the MIMO channel. The structure of both the parametric PASTD-aided
MIMO-CIR tap estimators and that of the RLS MIMO-CIR tap predictors is to a large extent identical
to those devised in Sections 7.5.2 and 7.6.4, respectively, in the context of our SISO channel estimation
scheme advocated in Section 7.7. On the other hand, our MIMO-CTF estimators exhibit a substantially
different structure which reﬂects the rank-deﬁcient nature of the MIMO channel estimation problem.
In order to exploit the time-domain correlation properties of the MIMO-CTF coefﬁcients matrix
H[n, k], we employ an iterative tracking approach instead of the MMSE estimation method of
Section 7.3.2.
7.8.1
Soft Recursive MIMO-CTF Estimation
Analogous to the SISO channel estimator architecture outlined in Section 7.7, at the ﬁrst stage of our
MIMO channel estimation scheme we employ an array of K per-subcarrier MIMO-CTF estimators
which function independently of each other. Consequently, for the sake of notational simplicity we
omit the subcarrier-related index k in the following section.
7.8.1.1
LMS MIMO-CTF Estimator
The Least Mean Square (LMS) estimation method, which constitutes a simple approximation of the
stochastic gradient algorithm [292], was invoked for the iterative tracking of the channel parameters
in the context of turbo equalization [264]. More speciﬁcally, following the LMS approach, we seek to
minimize the MSE-based cost function JLMS, which may be expressed as follows:
JLMS =

Hence, analogous to the solution derived in [264], the LMS estimate of the (nr × mt)-dimensional

7.8.1.2
RLS MIMO-CTF Estimator
The RLS algorithm [330] constitutes a rapidly converging LS algorithm. The RLS method was
considered in the context of recursive channel parameter estimation and tracking by multiple authors
[264, 275, 279, 309]. As opposed to the LMS approach outlined in Section 7.8.1.1, the RLS method
attempts to minimize the cost function created from the exponentially weighted and windowed sum of
the squared error. That is, we have
JRLS[n] =
n

m=1
ζn−meH[m, n]e[m, n],
(7.92)
where, analogous to the LMS method of Section 7.8.1.1, the corresponding error signal is given by
e[m, n] = y[m] −˜H[n]s[m],
(7.93)
while ζ denotes the forgetting factor. The corresponding RLS estimate of the (nr × mt)-dimensional
MIMO-CTF coefﬁcient matrix associated with the kth subcarrier of the nth OFDM symbol may be
calculated as follows [264]:
˜H[n] = (Φ−1[n]θ[n])H,
(7.94)
where we deﬁne the MIMO-CTF estimator’s input autocorrelation function Φ[n], which may be
calculated recursively as follows:
Φ[n] =
n

m=1
ζn−ms[m]sH[m] = ζΦ[n −1] + s[n]sH[n],
(7.95)
while the MIMO-CTF estimator’s input–output cross-correlation matrices θ[n] as follows:
θ[n] =
n

m=1
ζn−ms[m]yH[m] = ζθ[n −1] + s[n]yH[n].
(7.96)
The resultant RLS MIMO-CTF tracking method is summarized in Algorithm 7.6.

7.8.1.3
Soft-Feedback-Aided RLS MIMO-CTF Estimator
As suggested by the decision-directed philosophy of the channel estimation scheme outlined in
Section 7.8, the transmitted signal vector s[n] may not always be readily available at the receiver. More
speciﬁcally, the transmitted signal vector s[n] may be assumed to be known a priori if and only if s
constitutes a pilot symbol, which occupies a small portion of the transmitted data stream. Alternatively,
whenever an information-carrying data symbol is transmitted, the decision-based estimates ˆs[n] become
available instead. Unfortunately, however, the decision-based estimates ˆs are prone to decision errors
which may potentially result in error propagation and thus in a substantial performance degradation.

7.8.1. Soft Recursive MIMO-CTF Estimation
237
Consequently, as pointed out in [264, 275, 278], it is highly beneﬁcial to exploit the probability-
related soft information available at the output of the MIMO-OFDM system’s detector. More specif-
ically, in addition to the hard-decision-based values of the transmitted signal estimates ˆs[n] we may
utilize the associated soft-information-related quantities, such as the expectations and the variances of
the elements of the estimated transmitted signal vector ˆs = [ˆs1, . . . , ˆsmt]T. Speciﬁcally, the expectation
of the ith transmitted symbol may be expressed as follows:
˜si = E{ˆsi} =

c∈M
c p{si = c},
(7.98)
while the corresponding variance is given by
vi = Var{ˆsi} =
 
c∈M
cc∗p{si = c}

−˜si˜s∗
i .
(7.99)
Subsequently, we may deﬁne the following alternative error signals:
ˆe[m, n] = y[m] −˜H[n]ˆs[m],
(7.100)
˜e[m, n] = y[m] −˜H[n]˜s[m].
(7.101)
The error signals of Equations (7.100) and (7.101) may be substituted into the LMS and RLS algorithms
of Sections 7.8.1.1 and 7.8.1.2 in order to yield the hard- and soft-decision-based LMS and RLS CTF
tracking algorithms, respectively.
7.8.1.4
Modiﬁed RLS MIMO-CTF Estimator
A further improved version of the soft-decision-based RLS tracking algorithm, namely the so-called
modiﬁed RLS algorithm, was proposed by Otnes [264]. More speciﬁcally, in the modiﬁed RLS method
the cost function of Equation (7.92) associated with the classic RLS method of Algorithm 7.6 is
substituted by a cost function which takes into account the ambiguity inherent in the decision-based
estimates ˆs[n]. Firstly, for the sake of notational convenience the following covariance matrices were
deﬁned in [264]:
D[n] = Cov{˜s[n],˜s[n]} = E{˜s[n]˜sH[n]} = diag(v[n])
(7.102)
and
U[n] = E{s[n]sH[n]} = ˜s[n]˜sH[n] + D[n],
(7.103)
where the elements of the variance vector v[n] are given by Equation (7.99). The corresponding
modiﬁed RLS cost function may be expressed as follows [264]:
JmodRLS[n] =
n

m=1
ζn−mE{˜eH[m, n]˜e[m, n] | y[m],˜s[m], D[m], ˜H[n]},
(7.104)
where, as previously, ζ denoted the forgetting factor. Observe that, as opposed to the RLS cost function
of Equation 7.92, the modiﬁed RLS cost function of Equation 7.104 takes into account the ambiguity
associated with both the estimated CTF matrix ˜H[n] and the estimated transmitted signal vector ˆs[n].
Finally, following the approach proposed in [264], the modiﬁed RLS MIMO-CTF estimate ˆH[n]
may be calculated using Equation (7.94), which is repeated here for convenience. Speciﬁcally, we have
ˆH[n] = (Φ−1[n]θ[n])H,
(7.105)

Chapter 7. Channel Estimation for OFDM and MC-CDMA
where the corresponding covariance matrices Φ[n] and θ[n] may be reformulated using the quantities
D[n] and U[n] of Equations (7.102) and (7.103), respectively. That is, we have
Φ[n] =
n

m=1
ζn−mU[m] = ζΦ[n −1] + U[n]
(7.106)

θ[n] =

The resultant soft-decision-based MIMO-CTF modiﬁed RLS method is summarized in Algorithm 7.7.

7.8.1.5
MIMO-CTF Estimator Performance Analysis
The snapshots of the CTF estimation MSE exhibited by both hard- and soft-feedback-aided LMS and
RLS MIMO-CTF tracking methods of Sections 7.8.1.1 and 7.8.1.2, respectively, as well as that of
the modiﬁed RLS method of Section 7.8.1.4, are depicted in Figure 7.23. We considered the 4 × 4
MIMO-OFDM system characterized in Table 1.11. We assumed the transmission of a sequence of
signal bursts comprising 24 OFDM symbols each. Furthermore, each signal burst was constituted by an
8 OFDM symbols pilot frame, followed by a 16 OFDM symbol data frame. Additionally, we assumed
encountering an OFDM-symbol-normalized Doppler frequency of fD = 0.003 and SNRs of 6.0 and
10.0 dB.
In Figure 7.23(a) we can see that at low SNRs, where the system suffers from frequent
decision errors, the hard-feedback-aided LMS and RLS methods of Algorithms 7.5 and 7.6 exhibit
a substantially worse performance than their soft-feedback-aided counterparts. On the other hand,
Figure 7.23(b), which corresponds to the higher SNR value of 10 dB, where we have a relatively
low probability of decision errors, demonstrates that the hard-feedback-aided RLS MIMO-CTF
tracking method outperforms its soft-feedback-assisted counterpart. Nevertheless, the slightly lower
performance of the soft-feedback-aided methods recorded at higher SNRs is a price worth paying for
their signiﬁcantly better robustness against error propagation at lower SNRs. Additionally, we can see
in both Figures 7.23(a) and 7.23(b) that the modiﬁed RLS method of Algorithm 7.7 exhibits the best
MSE performance among the soft-feedback-aided tracking methods considered.
Consequently, from the results of Figure 7.23 we may draw the conclusion that the soft-feedback-
aided modiﬁed RLS MIMO-CTF tracking method of Algorithm 7.7 exhibits the best combination of
attractive MSE performance and a high robustness against error propagation.

7.8.2
PASTD-Aided DDCE for MIMO-OFDM
As outlined in Section 7.8, we propose a MIMO channel estimation scheme which follows the DDCE
philosophy of Figure 7.1. The detailed structure of our MIMO-DDCE channel estimator is illustrated
in Figure 7.24. More speciﬁcally, our MIMO channel estimation scheme comprises an array of K per-
subcarrier MIMO-CTF estimators, followed by an (nr × mt)-dimensional array of parametric CIR
estimators and a corresponding array of (nr × mt × L) CIR tap predictors, where L is the number
of tracked CIR taps per link for the MIMO channel. The structure of both the parametric PASTD-
aided MIMO-CIR tap estimators and that of the RLS MIMO-CIR tap predictors is to a large extent
identical to those devised in Sections 7.5.2 and 7.6.4 in the context of our SISO channel estimation
scheme advocated in Section 7.7. On the other hand, our MIMO-CTF estimators may employ one of
the recursive MIMO-CTF tracking methods outlined in Sections 7.8.1.1, 7.8.1.2 or 7.8.1.4.
The resultant MIMO-DDCE scheme illustrated in Figure 7.24 and employing the modiﬁed RLS
MIMO-CTF estimator of Algorithm 7.7, the PASTD-aided CIR estimator of Algorithm 7.2 as well as
the RLS CIR tap predictor of Algorithm 7.3 is summarized in Algorithm 7.8.
7.8.2.1
PASTD-Aided MIMO-DDCE Performance Analysis
In this section we will characterize the achievable performance of the MIMO-DDCE scheme of
Algorithm 7.8 in the context of the MIMO-OFDM system of Figure 1.17. More speciﬁcally, we consider
a 2 × 2 MIMO-QPSK-OFDM system having K = 128 orthogonal QPSK-modulated subcarriers.
The system parameters are outlined in Table 1.11. We employ an OFDM-frame-variant channel model
having the time-variant seven-tap PDP characterized by the COST207 BU channel model of [347], as
detailed in Section 1.7.2. Additionally, each individual propagation path undergoes fast Rayleigh fading
at an OFDM-symbol-normalized Doppler frequency of fD = 0.001 and fD = 0.005. The resultant
channel can be characterized as a multi-path Rayleigh-fading channel with slowly ﬂuctuating PDP.
Firstly, Figure 7.25 characterizes the achievable MSE performance of the MIMO-DDCE method
of Algorithm 7.8 for different values of the MIMO-CTF tracking scheme’s forgetting factor ζ.

Figure 7.25: The Mean Square Error (MSE) exhibited by the 2 × 2 SDM-4-QAM-OFDM system
employing the SDM PASTD-aided DDCE scheme of Algorithm 7.8. The PASTD-DDCE parameters
are ζ = 0.1, 0.3, . . . , 0.9 as well as η = 0.95, β = 0.9. We considered the scenarios of encountering
Doppler frequencies of (a) fD = 0.001 and (b) fD = 0.005. The abscissa represents the average SNR
recorded at the receive antenna elements.
Figures 7.25(a) and 7.25(b) correspond to encountering the Doppler frequencies of fD = 0.001 and
0.005, respectively. As may be concluded from Figure 7.25, the optimum value of the forgetting factor
ζ is largely dependent on the SNR as well as on the Doppler frequency encountered. Nevertheless, the
compromise value of ζ = 0.7 appears to constitute a relatively good choice in the practical range of
SNR values and Doppler frequencies.
Secondly, Figure 7.26 characterizes the achievable MSE performance of the MIMO-DDCE method
of Algorithm 7.8 for different values of the PASTD-aided CIR tracking scheme’s forgetting factor η.
Figures 7.26(a) and 7.26(b) correspond to encountering the Doppler frequencies of fD = 0.001 and
0.005, respectively. Similar to the choice of the optimum MIMO-CTF tracking forgetting factor ζ, the
optimum value of the PASTD-aided CIR tracking forgetting factor η is largely dependent on the SNR
as well as on the Doppler frequency encountered and the compromise value of η = 0.95 appears to
constitute a good choice across the practical range of SNR values and Doppler frequencies.
Furthermore, Figure 7.27 characterizes the achievable MSE performance of the MIMO-DDCE
method of Algorithm 7.8 for different ranks L of the PASTD-aided CIR tracking-related estimated
subspace, while assuming a constant value of the forgetting factors η
= 0.95 and ζ
= 0.7.
Figures 7.27(a) and 7.27(b) correspond to encountering the Doppler frequencies of fD = 0.001
and 0.005, respectively. From Figure 7.27 we may conclude that a relatively high performance of
the PASTD-aided CIR estimator may be achieved when assuming that the rank of the estimated CTF
signal subspace is L = 4, regardless of the actual number of paths constituting the multi-path CIR
encountered.
In order to characterize further the performance of the resultant MIMO channel estimation scheme,
we will use the estimation efﬁciency criteria κ of Equation (7.85). In the case of a MIMO system, the

of 10%. Figures 7.28(a) and 7.28(b) correspond to the 4 × 4 and 8 × 8 MIMO scenarios, respectively.
We considered encountering the Doppler frequencies of fD = 0.001, 0.003 and 0.005. Observe that
the system proposed attains a virtually error-free performance of a rate 1/2 turbo-coded 8 × 8 QPSK-
OFDM system, exhibiting a total bit rate of 8 bps/Hz and having a pilot overhead of only 10%, at an
SNR of 10 dB and normalized Doppler frequency of 0.003, which corresponds to the mobile terminal
speed of roughly 65 km/h.4
Our future research is related to reducing the pilot overhead required, potentially leading to semi-
blind channel estimation schemes.

Chapter Summary
The subject of this chapter was the design of efﬁcient channel estimation schemes. We commenced
our discourse by considering the family of conceptually simplest, low-complexity pilot symbol-assisted
techniques. Then the decision-directed channel estimation philosophy was introduced, where the initial
channel estimates are generated with the aid of pilots and a tentative data estimate is arrived at with the
aid slicing, while exploiting the tentative channel estimate. Then, provided that all data decisions are
error-free, we now have access to 100 % pilot information and hence a more accurate channel estimate
may be generated. Since the channel ﬂuctuations obey the Doppler frequency, the consecutive channel
coefﬁcients are correlated and can also be predicted into the future on the basis of the previous channel
estimates. The chapter concluded by designing channel estimation schemes for MIMO-aided OFDM
arrangements, which typically require the estimation of a high number of MIMO links.

Iterative Joint Channel Estimation
and MUD for SDMA-OFDM
Systems
8.1
Introduction1
Multiple-Input, Multiple-Output (MIMO) Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) sys-
tems have recently attracted substantial research interest. On the one hand, the employment of multiple
antennas offers an opportunity to exploit both transmitter and receiver diversity, thus signiﬁcantly
increasing the system’s transmission integrity [107]. On the other hand, as a further beneﬁt, OFDM
exhibits robustness against both frequency-selective fading as well as the Inter-Symbol Interference
(ISI) imposed by multi-path propagation. Speciﬁcally, intensive research efforts have been invested both
in Bell Labs Layered Space–Time architecture (BLAST) [105,108,452] and in Space-Division Multiple
Access (SDMA) based MIMO OFDM [3]. More speciﬁcally, in SDMA-OFDM systems the transmitted
signals of L simultaneous uplink mobile users – each equipped with a single transmitter antenna – are
received by the P different receiver antennas of the Base Station (BS). At the BS Multi-User Detection
(MUD) [439] techniques are invoked for detecting the different users’ transmitted signals with the aid
of their unique user-speciﬁc spatial signature constituted by their Frequency-Domain CHannel Transfer
Functions (FD-CHTFs) or, equivalently, Channel Impulse Responses (CIRs). Since the same time–
frequency resource is shared by simultaneous users, a higher bandwidth efﬁciency can be achieved by
SDMA systems in comparison with conventional multiplexing techniques, such as for example Time-
Division Multiple Access (TDMA) or Frequency-Division Multiple Access (FDMA).
However, in these systems accurate channel estimation is required at the receiver to invoke both
coherent demodulation and interference cancellation. Compared with Single-Input, Single-Output
(SISO) systems, channel estimation in the MIMO scenario becomes more challenging, since a
signiﬁcantly increased number of independent transmitter–receiver channel links have to be estimated
simultaneously for each subcarrier. Moreover, the interfering signals of the other transmitter antennas
have to be suppressed. All these factors render channel estimation for MIMO-OFDM systems a new
challenge.

Chapter 8. Iterative Joint Channel Estimation and MUD
In the literature, a number of blind channel estimation techniques have been proposed for MIMO-
OFDM systems [83, 217, 228, 251, 518, 519]. However, most of these approaches suffer from either a
slow convergence rate or a performance degradation due to the inherent limitations of blind search
mechanisms. By contrast, the techniques beneﬁting from explicit training with the aid of known
reference/pilot signals are typically capable of achieving a better performance at the cost of a reduced
effective system throughput. For example, Li et al. [520] proposed an approach exploiting both
transmitter diversity and the delay proﬁle characteristics of typical mobile channels, which was further
simpliﬁed and enhanced in [131, 521] and [134], respectively. Other schemes employed Minimum
Mean Square Error (MMSE) [522], Constrained Least-Squares (CLS) [200], iterative Least-Squares
(LS) [132, 173], Second-Order Statistics (SOS) based subspace [156] estimation algorithms as well
as QR Decomposition combined with the M-algorithm (QRD-M) [172, 523] or techniques based on
Time Of Arrival (TOA) [178] etc. Some researchers focused their attention on designing optimum
training patterns or structures [131,133,524]. Furthermore, various joint approaches combining channel
estimation with data symbol detection at the receiver were also proposed for Code-Division Multiple
Access (CDMA) [519, 523], SISO OFDM [525] and MIMO OFDM [172, 526] systems. However, in
the context of BLAST or SDMA types of multi-user MIMO-OFDM systems, all channel estimation
techniques found in the literature were developed under the assumption that the number of users
L is lower than [132, 156, 217, 228, 518, 522, 527] or equal to [133, 172, 178, 200, 251, 526, 528]
the number of receiver antennas P. This assumption is critical for the following reasons. When
L > P, which we refer to as an overloaded scenario, the (P × L)-dimensional MIMO channel matrix
representing the (P × L) number of channel links becomes singular, thus rendering the degree of
freedom of the detector insufﬁcient. This will catastrophically degrade the performance of numerous
known detection approaches, such as for example the MMSE algorithm of [3, 439] and the QRD-M
algorithm of [172]. Furthermore, the associated signiﬁcant degradation of the MUD’s performance in
this overloaded scenario will inevitably result in severe error propagation in decision-directed types of
channel estimators [3].
Against this background, in this chapter we propose a new Genetic Algorithm (GA) [328,453–456]
assisted iterative Joint Channel Estimation and Multi-User Detection (GA-JCEMUD) approach for
multi-user MIMO SDMA-OFDM systems, which provides an effective solution to the multi-user
MIMO channel estimation problem in the above-mentioned overloaded scenario. Our ambitious goal
of supporting a high number of users is physically possible, because the proposed GA-based technique
dispenses with any constraints concerning the rank of the channel matrix. In the literature, only a few
channel estimation schemes have been proposed based on GAs. More speciﬁcally, Yen et al. [461]
proposed a GA-aided multi-user CDMA single-antenna receiver, which jointly estimates the transmitted
symbols and fading channel coefﬁcients of all the users. A batch blind equalization scheme based on
Maximum Likelihood (ML) concatenated channel and data estimation employing a Micro Genetic
Algorithm (µGA) and the Viterbi Algorithm (VA) was proposed in [529]. In [530, 531], GA-based
approaches were used to ﬁnd optimum training sequences for channel estimation in OFDM systems.
However, to our best knowledge, no techniques employing GAs for joint channel and data optimization
can be found in the literature in the context of multi-user MIMO-OFDM. Furthermore, at the time of
writing, the GAs invoked in the data detection literature [38,459–461,532,533] can only provide a hard-
decision output for the Forward Error Correction (FEC) or channel decoder, which inevitably limits the
system’s achievable performance. By contrast, our proposed GA is capable of providing ‘soft’ outputs
and hence it becomes capable of achieving an improved performance with the aid of FEC decoders.
The structure of this chapter is as follows. Firstly an overview of the proposed scheme is provided in
Section 8.2, followed by the introduction of the proposed iterative GA-JCEMUD in Section 8.3. More
speciﬁcally, the methods used to generate initial FD-CHTF estimates and initial symbol estimates are
discussed in Sections 8.3.1 and 8.3.2, respectively. The GA-aided joint optimization process is detailed
in Section 8.3.3, commencing with a discussion of the GA individual’s structure in Section 8.3.3.1,
followed by a description of the initialization process in Section 8.3.3.2, the analysis of the genetically
joint channel estimation and symbol detection in Section 8.3.3.3 and the derivation of a novel

System Overview
Figure 8.1 shows a schematic of the SDMA-OFDM uplink system using the proposed iterative GA-
JCEMUD. As shown in the upper half of Figure 8.1, the information bit blocks b(l) (l = 1, . . . , L) of
the L mobile users are ﬁrst encoded by the L independent FEC encoders. The resultant coded bits b(l)
s
are then mapped to Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) or Phase-Shift Keying (PSK) symbols
s(l), which are modulated by the Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) based OFDM modulators and
transmitted over the SDMA MIMO channel described in Section 4.2.1.
At the BS illustrated in the lower half of Figure 8.1, the received signal constituted by the noise-
contaminated superposition of all users’ transmitted signals is OFDM demodulated at the P receiver
antenna elements and forwarded to the iterative GA-JCEMUD for joint channel estimation and symbol
detection, as will be detailed in Section 8.3. Then the detected soft bits ˆb(l)
s
are generated, which are
forwarded to the L independent FEC decoders for channel decoding.

Chapter 8. Iterative Joint Channel Estimation and MUD

GA-Assisted Iterative Joint Channel Estimation and
MUD
In this section, we will elaborate on the philosophy of the proposed iterative GA-JCEMUD, which is
illustrated in Figure 8.2. We assume that each OFDM symbol consists of K subcarriers. All subcarriers
of the ﬁrst transmitted OFDM symbol of all the L users carry known pilot QAM symbols, which are
spread by user-speciﬁc spreading codes before transmission.2 Within the ﬁrst OFDM symbol duration
(n = 0), the BS pilot controller seen in the middle of Figure 8.2 feeds the pilots to the GA-JCEMUD
printed in grey, which simultaneously processes the received signals xp[0, k] (p = 1, . . . , P ; k =
1, . . . , K) at the P receiver antenna elements. In order to simplify the analysis, we focus our attention
on the pth receiver. Based on the pilots and the corresponding received signals, the initial estimates of
the FD-CHTFs ˜H(l)
p [0, k] (l = 1, . . . , L; k = 1, . . . , K) can be generated, which will be subjected to
time-domain ﬁltering invoked at the pth receiver, as plotted at the top of Figure 8.2.
The time-domain ﬁltering is invoked for each of the L users on an OFDM symbol basis. More
speciﬁcally, for the lth user, the K initial FD-CHTF estimates ˜H(l)
p [n, k] (k = 1, . . . , K) associated
with the current, i.e. the nth OFDM symbol, are processed by a K-length IFFT, resulting in the set of
K uncorrelated CIR-related taps ˜h(l)
p [n, k]. Then, only the ﬁrst K0 CIR tap coefﬁcients are retained
with the rest set to zero. The value of K0 depends on the delay proﬁle of the channel, which is not
known a priori at the receiver. However, in many application scenarios it is possible appropriately to
overestimate K0 on the basis of previous ﬁeld experiments [228]. Generally speaking, the value of K0
should be set to a sufﬁciently large number so that it exceeds the actual maximum delay spread of the
channel. The reason for doing so is to ensure that the ‘real’ CIR taps are retained, while removing a
signiﬁcant part of the noise contaminating the high-delay, low-power CIR taps, and hence improving
the initial CHTF estimates generated by the GA-JCEMUD. To elaborate a little further, on the one hand,
the output of the GA-JCEMUD may be noisy, owing to low SNRs and/or a high number of users as well
as receiver antennas (i.e. more channel links to estimate, rendering the estimation job more difﬁcult).
On the other hand, in practical applications the value of K is usually chosen to be signiﬁcantly higher
than the number of CIR taps corresponding to the channel’s maximum delay spread. Furthermore, most
of the channel’s output power is contributed by the ﬁrst several CIR taps. In other words, provided that
K0 is higher than the maximum channel delay spread, the last (K −K0) CIR taps from the set of the
total K time-domain CIR taps generated by the IFFT from the CHTF estimates contain nothing but
noise. Therefore, when the last (K −K0) CIR taps are set to zero, most of the noise contaminating
the channel estimates can be removed without failing to capture the channel’s ‘real’ CIR taps. Based
on the above analysis, we point out that a good choice of K0 is constituted by the number of samples
in the OFDM cyclic preﬁx. Additionally, the ‘signiﬁcant-tap catching’ approaches of [131, 520] can
be employed for improving the channel estimator’s performance by further removing the low-power
taps – those that are likely to be constituted by noise, rather than by ‘real’ CIR taps – within the range
of [1, . . . , K0] according to a predeﬁned amplitude threshold. Following the CIR tap ﬁltering process
discussed above, the retained CIR-related coefﬁcients ˜h(l)
p [n, k] (k = 1, . . . , K0) are converted to the
improved a posteriori FD-CHTF estimates ˆH(l)
p [n, k] (k = 1, . . . , K) by the Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT). For more detailed discussions of these processes, refer to Chapters 15 and 16 of [3].
If in the (n + 1)th OFDM symbol duration a data symbol rather than a pilot symbol is transmitted,
the pilot controller will carry out the following actions:
• enables a ﬁrst-stage MUD for generating reference symbol estimates; and
• switches the operating mode of the GA-JCEMUD from pilot-aided channel estimation mode to
joint channel estimation and data detection mode.
More speciﬁcally, the Optimized Hierarchy Reduced Search Algorithm (OHRSA) aided MUD of [534,
535] is employed as the ﬁrst-stage MUD, as shown in Figure 8.2. It exploits the a posteriori
2More details of the process will be discussed in Section 8.3.1.

subcarrier based detection, yielding an initial guess of the L users’ transmitted symbols s(l)[n + 1, k]

ciated with the (n + 1)th OFDM symbol are jointly optimized on a subcarrier-by-subcarrier basis.

Chapter 8. Iterative Joint Channel Estimation and MUD
The GA-optimized FD-CHTF estimates ˜H(l)
p [n + 1, k] are then forwarded to the time-domain ﬁlters
for further enhancement, as mentioned earlier in this section. Now the cleansed a posteriori channel
estimates ˆH(l)
p [n + 1, k] are expected to be closer to their true values of H(l)
p [n + 1, k] than the
initially used estimates, i.e. ˆH(l)
p [n, k], which are associated with the previous OFDM symbol. Thus,
based on the improved channel estimates, the OHRSA MUD is capable of providing a better initial
guess of the transmitted symbols for the GA-JCEMUD. This decision-directed process can be invoked
for a number of iterations to attain a further performance enhancement. After the ﬁnal iteration, the
ﬁnal-iteration trigger portrayed on the left-hand side of Figure 8.2 terminates the GA-JCEMUD’s
operation and enables the output links, generating the L users’ detected soft bits ˆb(l)
s [n + 1, k]
(l = 1, . . . , L; k = 1, . . . , K) corresponding to the (n + 1)th OFDM symbol.
In the following sections, we will further detail the processes of obtaining initial FD-CHTF
estimates with the aid of pilots, generating initial symbol estimates by the OHRSA MUD as well as
jointly optimizing the FD-CHTFs and the data symbols using the GA, respectively.
8.3.1
Pilot-Aided Initial Channel Estimation
In order to obtain an initial estimate of the FD-CHTFs, each user’s pilot OFDM symbol is multiplied by
a user-speciﬁc spreading code before it is transmitted.3 With the aid of the spread pilot OFDM symbols,
an initial FD-CHTF estimate is attainable at the receivers, where the Multi-User Interference (MUI) is
effectively reduced in proportion to the spreading factor.
More speciﬁcally, the orthogonal Walsh–Hadamard Transform (WHT) [3] codes of length L are
chosen. The received symbol at the pth receiver antenna element associated with the kth subcarrier of
the n = 0th OFDM symbol duration can be formulated as
xp[0, k] = c ¯Hp[0, k]s[0, k] + np[0, k],
p = 1, . . . , P,
(8.1)
where the pilot signal vector s[0, k] and the diagonal FD-CHTF matrix ¯Hp[0, k] are given by
s[0, k] = [s(1)[0, k], s(2)[0, k], . . . , s(L)[0, k]]T ,
(8.2)
¯Hp[0, k] = diag[H(1)
p [0, k], H(2)
p [0, k], . . . , H(L)
p
[0, k]],
(8.3)
respectively, and the user signature vector c is formulated as
c = [c(1), c(2), . . . , c(L)],
(8.4)
where c(l) (l = 1, . . . , L) represents the lth user’s WHT code sequence, which is the lth row of the
L-order recursive WHT matrix given by [3]
UWHTL =
1
√

	1 · UWHTL/2

while the lowest-order WHT unitary matrix is deﬁned as
UWHT2 =

(8.6)
Note that the pilot symbol vector s[0, k] of Equation (8.1) is known at the receivers. Furthermore, we
can use the same unspread pilot QAM symbol for all users, i.e. s(l)[0, k] = s0 (l = 1, . . . , L). Hence,
it directly follows from Equation (8.1) that
ˇxp[0, k] =

Thus, the initial FD-CHTF estimates can be obtained as follows:

After the time-domain CIR tap ﬁltering operation shown in Figure 8.2, the reﬁned channel estimates
can then be used to assist the OHRSA MUD to detect the unknown transmitted symbols within the next
OFDM symbol duration. Afterwards, the GA-JCEMUD will be set to joint channel estimation and data
detection mode, providing the FD-CHTF estimates associated with the forthcoming OFDM symbols.
Depending on the speciﬁc performance–throughput design trade-off targeted, this process of
generating initial channel estimates can be invoked at predeﬁned time intervals. Here we denote the pilot
overhead as ϵ, which is deﬁned by the ratio of the number of pilot OFDM symbols to the total number
of transmitted OFDM symbols. We will show in Section 8.4 that a good performance is achievable by
the proposed scheme with a small value of ϵ.
8.3.2
Generating Initial Symbol Estimates
As mentioned earlier, for each subcarrier, an initial symbol estimate is ﬁrst obtained with the aid of
the ﬁrst-stage OHRSA-assisted MUD [534, 535] shown in Figure 8.2, which exploits the a posteriori
FD-CHTF estimates generated within the previous OFDM symbol duration. For the sake of notational
convenience, in this section the index of [n, k] is omitted. However, we note that the following analysis
is conducted on a subcarrier basis.
As an extension of the Complex Sphere Decoder (CSD) method [448, 450], the OHRSA MUD is
capable of achieving a near-optimum performance at a signiﬁcantly reduced computational complexity.
It is well known that the optimum ML MUD [3] employs an exhaustive search for ﬁnding the most
likely transmitted signals. More explicitly, recall that the L-user symbol vector estimate ˆsML can be
obtained by minimizing the following metric:
ˆsML = arg

min
ˇs∈ML ∥x −Hˇs∥2
,
(8.10)
where ˇs is an a priori candidate vector of the set ML, which consists of 2mL trial vectors, where m
denotes the number of Bits Per Symbol (BPS). More speciﬁcally, ML is formulated as
ML = {ˇs = [ˇs(1), ˇs(2), . . . , ˇs(L)]T | ˇs(1), ˇs(2), . . . , ˇs(L) ∈Mc},
(8.11)
where Mc denotes the set containing the 2m legitimate complex constellation points associated with the
speciﬁc modulation scheme employed. Furthermore, it can be shown that Equation (8.10) is equivalent
to [534,535]
ˆs = arg

min
ˇs∈ML ∥V(ˇs −ˆsMMSE)∥2
,
(8.12)
where V is an upper-triangular matrix having positive real-valued elements on the main diagonal and
satisfying
VHV = HHH + σ2

while
ˆsMMSE = (HHH + σ2

Chapter 8. Iterative Joint Channel Estimation and MUD
is the unconstrained MMSE-based estimate4 of the transmitted signal vector s, with I and σ2

matrix and the AWGN noise variance, respectively. Since V is an upper-triangular matrix, a speciﬁc
cost function can be derived:

(8.16)
Based on Equation (8.16), Φ(ˇs) can be redeﬁned as the Cumulative Sub-Cost (CSC) function:
ΦL(ˇsL) = φL(ˇsL) = |vLL(ˇs(L) −ˆs(L)
MMSE)|2,
i = L,
(8.17a)
Φi(ˇsi) = Φi+1(ˇsi+1) + φi(ˇsi),
i = L −1, . . . , 1,
(8.17b)
where ˇsi represents the subvectors of ˇs, formulated as
ˇsi = [ˇs(i), ˇs(i+1), . . . , ˇs(L)],
i ∈{1, . . . , L}.
(8.18)
In physically tangible terms, the Euclidean norm of Equation (8.17) can be interpreted as a weighted
Euclidean distance between the candidate constellation point ˇs(l) and the unconstrained MMSE
estimate ˆs(l)
MMSE of the transmitted signal component s(l). Explicitly, the CSC functions obey the property
Φ(ˇs) = Φ1(ˇs1) > Φ2(ˇs2) > · · · > ΦL(ˇsL) > 0
(8.19)
for all possible combinations of ˇs ∈ML and ˆsMMSE ∈CL×1, where the L-dimensional complex space
CL×1 contains all possible unconstrained MMSE estimates ˆsMMSE of the transmitted signal vector s.
By exploiting the monotonously increasing nature of the non-binary, i.e. multi-bit, symbol-based
CSC functions of Equation (8.19), a bit-based recursive search algorithm can be developed [534, 535],
where the (Lb = mL)-dimensional bit vectors ˇb constituting the L users’ bits, rather than the symbol
vectors ˇs, are used as the candidates for the CSC functions given by Equations (8.15) and (8.17). More
speciﬁcally, two legitimate hypotheses of −1 and 1 are stipulated at each recursive step i of the search
algorithm, concerning one of the bits of the bit-based trial vector ˇbi. This allows us now to interpret
physically the CSC functions as the Euclidian distance contribution of the speciﬁc ˇbi, when considering
a speciﬁc bit of a given symbol of a given user. The recursive search process commences with the
evaluation of the CSC function of Equation (8.17a), followed by the calculation of the conditioned CSC
function values of Equation (8.17b). Moreover, for each tentatively assumed value of ˇbi a successive
recursive search step (i −1) is invoked, which is conditioned on the hypotheses made in all preceding
4The unconstrained MMSE-based estimate denotes the resultant complex value calculated from Equation (8.14), as opposed to
the constrained estimate, which is the hard-decoded version of the unconstrained estimate.

recursive steps j = i, . . . , Lb = mL. Upon each arrival of the recursive process at the index i = 1, a
complete bit-based candidate vector ˇb associated with a certain symbol vector ˇs is hypothesized and the
corresponding value of the cost function Φ(ˇb) formulated in Equation (8.15) is evaluated. Furthermore,
with the aid of a carefully designed search strategy [534,535], the OHRSA is capable of arriving at the
optimum ML estimate at a signiﬁcantly reduced complexity. For more details on the OHRSA MUD,
the interested reader is referred to [534,535].
8.3.3
GA-Aided Joint Optimization Providing Soft Outputs
With the aid of the initial FD-CHTF estimates of Section 8.3.1 and the initial symbol estimates of
Section 8.3.2, the proposed GA-JCEMUD printed in the grey block of Figure 8.2 is employed to
optimize jointly the estimates of the FD-CHTFs and multi-user data symbols.
8.3.3.1
Extended GA Individual Structure
In comparison with the pure GA-based MUDs [459, 460, 532], which optimize the multi-user data
symbols only, the joint optimization work requires the FD-CHTFs to be simultaneously optimized along
with the data symbols, as in [38,461]. Furthermore, concerning the MIMO channel’s structure, the GA
individuals’ representation of [38,461] is extended to

in the context of the kth subcarrier of the nth OFDM symbol, where the subscript (y, x) denotes the
xth (x = 1, . . . , X) individual at the yth (y = 1, . . . , Y ) generation. In compliance with classic GA
terminology, any combination of a symbol vector ˜s(y,x)[n, k] and an FD-CHTF matrix ˜H(y,x)[n, k]
represents a GA individual, where ˜s(y,x)[n, k] is referred to as the individual’s symbol chromosome
and ˜H(y,x)[n, k] as the associated FD-CHTF chromosome, respectively, while each element of a
chromosome is termed a gene. Note that the symbol genes and the channel genes belong to different
sets. More speciﬁcally, we have ˜s(l)
(y,x)[n, k] ∈Mc and ˜H(l)
p,(y,x)[n, k] ∈C, where C denotes the
set of all complex numbers. This particular association of a pair of hypothesized channel and data
estimates is reminiscent of the so-called Per-Survivor Processing (PSP) based blind detection techniques
of [536,537]; however, it distinguished itself by invoking a genetically guided efﬁcient search strategy.
8.3.3.2
Initialization
During the stage of initialization, the GA generates a population of X individuals represented by
Equation (8.20), based on the initial FD-CHTF estimates of Section 8.3.1 and the initial symbol
estimates of Section 8.3.2. More explicitly, at the kth subcarrier in the (n+1)th OFDM symbol duration,
the genes of the (y, x) = (1, 1)st individual are generated as

(8.21)
where ˜s(l)[n + 1, k] represents the initial symbol estimates provided by the OHRSA MUD, while
˜H(l)
p [n, k] denotes the initial FD-CHTF estimates associated with the previous, i.e. the nth, OFDM

symbol. The other (X −1) individuals are then created by the GA’s mutation operator:

˜s(l)
(y,x)[n + 1, k] = MUTATION(˜s(l)
(1,1)[n + 1, k]),
˜H(l)

p,(1,1)[n + 1, k]),
x = 2, . . . , X; y = 1, . . . , Y ; l = 1, . . . , L; p = 1, . . . , P.
(8.22)
The details of the mutation process are discussed in Section 8.3.3.3.2. After the creation of the y = 1st
generation, which consists of the population of the initially generated X individuals, the GA-based
search process can be invoked for jointly optimizing the estimates of the multi-user symbols and FD-
CHTFs.
8.3.3.3
Joint Genetic Optimization
The basic idea of the GA-based optimization is to ﬁnd the optimum or a near-optimum solution
according to a predeﬁned Objective Function (OF). In the context of the joint detection problem in
SDMA-OFDM systems, the GA’s OF can be based on the ML metric of Equation (8.10), formulated as
Ω( ˜H[n, k],˜s[n, k]) = ∥x[n, k] −˜H[n, k] · ˜s[n, k]∥2,
(8.23)
where each combination of the trial data vector ˜s[n, k] and trial FD-CHTF matrix ˜H[n, k] constitutes
a GA individual deﬁned in Equation (8.20). The output of the OF is referred to as the Objective Score
(OS), and the individual having a lower OS is considered to have a higher ﬁtness value. Explicitly,
the GA’s ultimate aim is to ﬁnd the individual that has the highest ﬁtness value. This is achieved
with the aid of the genetic operators invoked during the evolution process, such as cross-over and
mutation [38, 453], where speciﬁc genes of the different individuals are exchanged and mutated to
produce the corresponding offspring. The number X of resultant offspring individuals then constitutes
a new population, which forms the GA’s next generation and is expected to have a statistically improved
average ﬁtness value in comparison with the parent population. Finally, the GA terminates when the
generation index reaches a predeﬁned value Y . Conventionally, the highest-ﬁtness individual of the
ﬁnal population will be considered as the GA’s ﬁnal solution, which consists of the genetically improved
FD-CHTF and data symbol estimates. For more details about the genetic optimization process, refer to
Appendix A.1 and references [38,459–461,532].
Recall that the elements of the symbol chromosome˜s[n, k] of an individual belong to Mc, i.e. to the
legitimate constellation symbol set. Thus, the symbol mutation space is discrete and is limited by the 2m
constellation points in Mc. By contrast, the mutation space of the FD-CHTFs is continuous and inﬁnite,
simply because the value of an FD-CHTF sample can be an arbitrary value on the complex plane C.
Therefore, different cross-over/mutation operators have to be employed for the symbol chromosome
and channel chromosome, respectively.
8.3.3.3.1
Cross-over Operator
In our system, the uniform cross-over [38] is used to mutate the symbol chromosomes. This cross-
over operator exchanges speciﬁc symbol genes of two parent individuals in order to generate the
offspring. Theoretically, it may also be applied to the FD-CHTF mutation process, where the channel
chromosomes of parent individuals are swapped. However, this ‘exchange-only’ mechanism neglects
the continuous nature of the complex-valued FD-CHTFs, thus imposing a limitation during the cross-
over process, when the genetic information is delivered from parents to offspring.
To improve the cross-over efﬁciency, the blend cross-over [538, 539] is invoked for combining the
channel chromosomes from each of the two parent individuals into new channel chromosomes of the
two offspring. More speciﬁcally, the offspring’s channel chromosomes can be formulated as
 ˜H(l)
p,(y+1,1)[n, k] = β1 ˜H(l)
p,(y,1)[n, k] + β2 ˜H(l)
p,(y,2)[n, k],
˜H(l)
p,(y+1,2)[n, k] = β2 ˜H(l)
p,(y,1)[n, k] + β1 ˜H(l)
p,(y,2)[n, k],
y = 1, . . . , Y,
(8.24)

8.3.3. GA-Aided Joint Optimization Providing Soft Outputs
257
where the random weight factors βi ∈[0, 1] (i = 1, 2) satisfy
β1 + β2 = 1.
(8.25)
Similar to the uniform cross-over operator invoked for symbol chromosomes, in the blend cross-over
operator a random binary cross-over mask is also created to identify the speciﬁc channel genes to be
combined. Observing Equation (8.24), we can note that the genes of the new channel chromosomes are
actually the linearly biased or weighted results averaged between the two parents in the context of the
(P × L)-dimensional complex space. When we have β1 = β2 = 0.5, the result becomes an unbiased
average of the channel chromosomes of the two parents. Explicitly, the blend cross-over operator
exploits the continuous and inﬁnite nature of the FD-CHTFs and hence it is capable of amalgamating
the parental genetic information in a more meritorious manner.
8.3.3.3.2
Mutation Operator
Similar to the cross-over operator, the mutation operator also requires the employment of different
methods for the symbol and channel chromosomes, respectively. The mutation schemes based on
discrete character sets, e.g. the classic Uniform Mutation (UM) [38], can be applied to the symbol
chromosomes. On the other hand, the approach of [461], which is referred to here as Step Mutation
(SM), can be employed to mutate the channel chromosomes. To elaborate a little further, the offspring’s
channel chromosomes can be generated by


p,(y,x)[n, k]) + θℜ∆(l)

where ∆(l)
p,(y,x)[n, k] is a random number within (0, λmax], while ℜand ℑrespectively denote the real
and imaginary components of the speciﬁc channel gene ˜H(l)
p,(y+1,x)[n, k] to be mutated. The sign factors
θℜand θℑof Equation (8.26) are uniformly and randomly generated, assuming values of +1 or −1.
We point out that the value of the maximum mutation step size λmax is critical for the system’s
attainable performance, since it directly affects the convergence of the GA’s optimization process. A low
system performance will be expected when λmax is insufﬁciently high, where the GA may get trapped
in local rather than global minima. However, an excessively high value of λmax will result in a slow
convergence rate. Generally speaking, the value of λmax should be adjusted according to the Doppler
frequency encountered. More speciﬁcally, when we have a higher Doppler frequency, the consecutive
channel fades in the time domain experienced by each of the subcarriers become faster, thus requiring a
higher λmax value to assist the GA in capturing the rapid changes of the channel fades. In low-Doppler
scenarios, the situation is the inverse. Therefore, it is desirable that the value of λmax is adjusted as a
function of the Doppler frequency. However, in this case it is a challenging task to develop a closed-
form function for quantifying the effects of the Doppler frequency, owing to the inherently nonlinear
nature of the GA-based optimization process. Nonetheless, with the aid of computer simulations we
can identify the appropriate values of λmax for different Doppler frequencies, as will be discussed in
Section 8.4.1.
8.3.3.3.3
Comments on the Joint Optimization Process
Note that since the FD-CHTFs and data symbols are jointly optimized within the same genetic process,
the individuals having better FD-CHTF estimates will have a higher probability of producing better
symbol estimates and vice versa. Thus, this joint optimization is a ‘self-adaptive’ process with its native
intuition leading towards the optimum solution. Furthermore, compared with other techniques, e.g.
that of [529], where the channel estimation and symbol detection are completed by the GA and the

258
Chapter 8. Iterative Joint Channel Estimation and MUD
VA separately, the proposed joint scheme is capable of reducing the associated complexity, since the
channel estimation is simultaneously achieved with the aid of the same GA process, thus incurring no
additional complexity.
Moreover, it is worth pointing out that at the time of writing the GA-aided detection schemes found
in the literature [38,459–461,532] are only capable of providing single-individual hard-decoded symbol
estimates, which inevitably limits the GA-aided system’s attainable performance. In Section 8.3.3.4, we
will introduce a method which enables the GA to provide soft outputs based on the entire population.
8.3.3.4
Generating the GA’s Soft Outputs
In this section we derive an algorithm that enables the GA to output soft information. For the sake of
simplicity, again, we omit the index [n, k] in this section.
The soft-bit value or Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR) associated with the (mB)th bit position of the
lth (l = 1, . . . , L) user’s transmitted symbol s(l) can be formulated as [540]
Ll,mB = ln P(bl,mB = 1|x, H)
P(bl,mB = 0|x, H),
(8.27)
which is the natural logarithm of the quotient of probabilities that the bit considered has a value of
bl,mB = 1 or bl,mB = 0. Note that the probability P(bl,mB = b|x, H) that the symbol transmitted by
the lth user has the (mB)th bit value of bl,mB = b ∈{0, 1} is given by the sum of all the probabilities
of the symbol combinations which assume that bl,mB = b. Hence, Equation (8.27) can be equivalently
rewritten as
Ll,mB = ln

ˇs∈ML
l,mB,1 P(ˇs|x, H)

ˇs∈ML
l,mB,0 P(ˇs|x, H),
(8.28)
where ML
l,mB,b denotes the speciﬁc subset associated with the lth user, which is constituted by those
speciﬁc trial vectors whose lth element’s (mB)th bit has a value of b, which is expressed as
ML
l,mB,b = {ˇs = [ˇs(1), ˇs(2), . . . , ˇs(L)]T | {ˇs(1), ˇs(2), . . . , ˇs(L) ∈Mc} ∧{bl,mB = b}}.
(8.29)
With the aid of Bayes’ theorem [540], we have
P(ˇs|x, H) = P(x|ˇs, H) P(ˇs)
P(x).
(8.30)
On substituting Equation (8.30) into Equation (8.28), we arrive at

Note that here we have assumed that the different (2m)-ary symbol combination vectors ˇs have the
same probability, i.e. P(ˇs), ˇs ∈Mc, is a constant. On the other hand, recall that in SDMA-OFDM
systems we have
x = Hs + n.
(8.32)
It can be observed from Equation (8.32) that x is a random sample of the L-dimensional multi-
variate complex-Gaussian distribution, where the mean vector is (Hs), while the (P × P)-dimensional
covariance matrix Rn is given by
Rn = E{nnH} = σ2
nI,
(8.33)
and the noise encountered at the P receiver antennas is assumed to be uncorrelated. Hence, the above-
mentioned multi-variate complex-Gaussian distribution can be described by [541]
f(x|s, H) =
1
πP |Rn| exp{−(x −Hs)HR−1

Note that f(x|s, H) = P(x|s, H) is the a priori probability that the vector x has been received under
the condition that the vector s was transmitted over the MIMO channel characterized by the FD-CHTF
matrix H. Thus, Equation (8.31) can be further developed with the aid of Equation (8.35), yielding

Furthermore, concerning the fact that the true FD-CHTF matrix H is unknown, and using Equa-

[Ωl,mB,1 −Ωl,mB,0],
(8.39)
where
Ωl,mB,b = min[Ω( ˜H,ˇsl,mB,b), ω],
b = 0, 1,
(8.40)
and ω = P · L is a normalization factor. Equation (8.39) suggests that the LLRs can be obtained by
evaluating the GA’s OF. More explicitly, in order to calculate the LLR of the (mB)th bit of the lth
(l = 1, . . . , L) user at the speciﬁc subcarrier considered, the number X of individuals in the GA’s
ﬁnal generation is divided into two groups, where the ﬁrst (or second) group is constituted by those
individuals that have a value of one (or zero) at the (mB)th bit of the lth user’s estimated transmitted
symbol. The resultant lowest OS calculated in each of the two groups is then compared with ω, and the
smaller of the two will be used in Equation (8.39) for calculating the corresponding LLR, which can
therefore assist the channel decoder in improving the SDMA-OFDM system’s performance.
It is worth pointing out that the proposed GA generating the above-mentioned population-based soft
outputs only imposes a modest complexity increase in comparison with the conventional hard-decision
individual-based GAs [38,459–461,532]. This is because the only additional operation required by the
proposed scheme is to compare ω with the OSs which are already available, since the results of the OF
evaluation carried out by the conventional GAs can be readily used.

Simulation Results
In this section, we will quantify the performance of the MIMO SDMA-OFDM system using the
proposed GA-aided iterative joint channel estimation and MUD technique. Our attention was focused
on overloaded scenarios which have not been investigated in the literature in this speciﬁc context at the
time of writing. Nonetheless, we point out that the proposed GA-JCEMUD scheme performs equally
well in conventional scenarios where the number of users L is less than or equal to the number of
receiver antenna elements P.
More speciﬁcally, an overloaded scenario where L = 4 users were supported by P = 2 receiver
antenna elements was considered. As an example, a simple two-path Rayleigh fading channel model

was employed, where the associated delay proﬁle was (0.7740 · z0 + 0.6332 · z−1). The value of the
parameter K0 was set to 8 ≫2, which is a rather loose condition, potentially capable of tolerating
an increase of the actual dispersion up to eight CIR taps. Each of the paths experienced independent
Rayleigh fading having the same Doppler frequency of FD = fdTs normalized to the OFDM symbol
rate, where fd and Ts are the maximum Doppler frequency and the OFDM symbol duration including
the cyclic preﬁx, respectively. The channel was assumed to be ‘OFDM symbol invariant’, implying
that the CIR taps were assumed to be constant for the duration of one OFDM symbol, but they were
faded at the beginning of each symbol. Furthermore, the fading envelope of the (P × L) number of
user–receiver channel links were assumed to be uncorrelated. Each user’s associated transmit power or
signal variance was assumed to be unity.
Both scenarios with and without FEC coding were investigated. In the FEC-coded scenario, as
an example, a half-rate binary Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) [419, 428] code was employed.
However, other FEC codes, e.g. Turbo Convolutional (TC) [314, 420, 421] codes, are also applicable
to the proposed system. For the reader’s convenience, the simulation parameters are summarized in
Table 8.1. For more details on the GA’s conﬁguration, the interested reader is referred to Section 8.3.3.3
and Chapter 5.
8.4.1
Effects of the Maximum Mutation Step Size
As a preliminary investigation, in this section we attempt to identify the appropriate choices of the
maximum mutation step size λmax in conjunction with different Doppler frequencies. Firstly, we

JCEMUD/SDMA-OFDM system using various values of λmax, as shown in Figure 8.3, where the

Here we point out that the FD-CHTF estimation MSE performance of the GA-JCEMUD is the same
both with and without employing FEC coding. This is because the GA-aided joint optimization process
has no direct interaction with the outer FEC code and thus it becomes independent of the codec.
Explicitly, we can see in Figure 8.3 that the choice of λmax has a substantial effect on the system’s
FD-CHTF estimation MSE performance, regardless of both FD and the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR).
Figure 8.4 shows the performance of the Bit Error Ratio (BER) versus λmax of the LDPC-coded
GA-JCEMUD-aided SDMA-OFDM system. It can be found that in scenarios associated with a higher
SNR the effect of λmax becomes more signiﬁcant in terms of the achievable BER performance. The
reason for this phenomenon is that at low SNRs the BER performance of the system is mainly dominated
by the noise signal, and at high SNRs by the choice of λmax, provided that the Doppler frequency is the
same. Furthermore, a higher FD value typically requires a higher λmax to attain the best achievable BER
performance, as we discussed in Section 8.3.3.3.2. According to Figure 8.4, the recommended values

with FD values of 0.001, 0.003 and 0.005, respectively. These values of λmax corresponding to the
speciﬁc FD values encountered were used to generate all the simulation results discussed in the rest of
this chapter.
8.4.2
Effects of the Doppler Frequency
In Figure 8.5 we compare the BER versus SNR performance of both the uncoded and LDPC-coded
GA-JCEMUD/SDMA-OFDM systems in conjunction with different values of FD. The performances
of the systems employing the linear MMSE MUD or the optimum ML MUD are also provided as
references, both assuming perfect Channel State Information (CSI). A pilot overhead of ϵ = 2.5%
was assumed and the GA-JCEMUD used a single iteration. As shown in Figure 8.5, unsurprisingly,
the performances of both the uncoded and coded GA-JCEMUD-aided systems degraded when FD was
increased, since a higher Doppler frequency implies that the channel fades more rapidly, which renders
channel estimation more challenging. This is especially true for MIMO systems, even more so for
overloaded MIMO systems, as discussed in Section 8.1. Nonetheless, with only a 2.5% pilot overhead,
the proposed GA-JCEMUD/SDMA-OFDM system was capable of achieving a performance close to the
perfect-CSI-aided optimum ML MUD at FD = 0.001. By contrast, the system employing the MMSE
MUD completely failed even with the aid of perfect CSI, owing to the insufﬁcient degree of detection
freedom experienced in overloaded scenarios. Furthermore, compared with the uncoded scenario, the
performance degradation of the LDPC-coded GA-JCEMUD incurred by higher Doppler frequencies
was much less dramatic, as observed in Figure 8.5.
5Note that the best choice of λmax for achieving the best BER performance may be similar to, but may not necessarily be, the
best choice for attaining the best FD-CHTF estimation MSE performance. This effect can be observed from Figures 8.3 and 8.4.

8.4.3
Effects of the Number of GA-JCEMUD Iterations
Figure 8.6 shows the achievable performance of the proposed system invoking different numbers of GA-
JCEMUD iterations. It was assumed that ϵ = 2.5% and FD = 0.003. As seen in Figure 8.6, a signiﬁcant
iteration gain was achieved when the GA-JCEMUD invoked additional iterations. Furthermore, the
performance of the uncoded system consistently improved as the number of iterations was increased,
while in the LDPC-coded system most of the gain was attained by the ﬁrst GA-JCEMUD iteration. In
Figure 8.7, the average FD-CHTF estimation MSE performance of the GA-JCEMUD/SDMA-OFDM
system as well as the performance of the reference system employing ϵ = 100% pilot overhead are
compared. Observe from Figure 8.7 that, as expected, the FD-CHTF estimation MSE performance
was improved when the number of GA-JCEMUD iterations was increased. Moreover, when the SNR
exceeded about 13 dB, the GA-JCEMUD using ϵ = 2.5% pilot overhead approached the best-case
FD-CHTF estimation MSE performance associated with ϵ = 100%.
8.4.4
Effects of the Pilot Overhead
In Figure 8.8 the BER performance of the proposed system using different pilot overheads is
investigated. In most cases, the GA-JCEMUD was capable of achieving a good performance using
a pilot overhead as low as ϵ = 1.5% to 2.5%. Furthermore, the increase of the pilot OFDM symbol
overhead brings about more substantial beneﬁts at the higher Doppler frequencies than at the lower ones,
especially in the scenarios associated with higher SNRs, where an increasing fraction of the residual
detection errors was inﬂicted by the inaccurate channel estimation.
8.4.5
Joint Optimization Versus Separate Optimization
In order to characterize further the advantages of the proposed GA-aided joint optimization scheme, in
Figure 8.9 we compare the performances of the GA-JCEMUD and its counterpart, referred to as the

by the GA-aided channel estimator and the OHRSA MUD, respectively. In other words, the symbol
estimates offered by the OHRSA MUD are ﬁxed during the GA-aided optimization process of the FD-
CHTF estimates. Explicitly, in this case the effect of error propagation due to inaccurate symbol and/or
channel estimates will become more severe, resulting in a dramatic BER performance degradation in
comparison with the proposed joint optimization scheme, as evidenced in Figure 8.9. Furthermore, the
superiority of the GA-JCEMUD becomes even more conspicuous in high-Doppler scenarios.
8.4.6
Comparison of GA-JCEMUDs Having Soft and Hard Outputs
Figure 8.10 shows the performance comparison of the GA-JCEMUD providing either the conventional
individual-based hard outputs [38, 459–461, 532] or the proposed population-based soft outputs. As
expected, with the advent of FEC codes, the proposed soft GA is capable of signiﬁcantly outperforming
the conventional arrangement, especially when the channel fades more rapidly. This result implies
that the proposed GA exhibited a higher robustness against fast fading channels than the conventional
GAs [38,459–461,532].
8.4.7
MIMO Robustness
As a further investigation, a visual comparison of the true and estimated FD-CHTFs is portrayed in
Figure 8.11. More speciﬁcally, the L users’ FD-CHTFs associated with a speciﬁc receiver antenna
element during a block of 40 consecutive OFDM symbols are plotted at an SNR value of 20 dB.
Each dot of the curves plotted in Figure 8.11 represents a complex-valued FD-CHTF at a speciﬁc
subcarrier. By observing the perfect channel-knowledge-based illustration at the top of Figure 8.11,
we can see that the FD-CHTF at each subcarrier evolves over the duration of the 40 OFDM symbols,
where the thickness of the ring-shaped formations indicates the amount of FD-CHTF change during
this time interval. The full perimeter of the ring is constituted by the K = 64 spoke-like formations
corresponding to the 64 OFDM subcarriers. Explicitly, the radii of the FD-CHTF rings associated with

are identical, their short-term envelope ﬂuctuation observed over the 40 OFDM symbol durations is
different. However, by comparing the subﬁgures at the top and bottom of Figure 8.11, we can see that the
FD-CHTF estimates closely match their true values, resulting in a similar FD-CHTF contour for each
of the four channel links. This implies that the proposed GA-JCEMUD is capable of simultaneously
capturing the fading envelope changes of each individual user–receiver link, regardless of its instant
variety of fading. Since an equally good performance was attained over all the user–receiver links, this
demonstrates the global robustness of the proposed approach in MIMO scenarios.

Conclusions
From our discussions in the previous sections, we conclude that the proposed GA-aided iterative
joint channel estimation and MUD scheme generating soft outputs constitutes an effective solution
to the channel estimation problem in multi-user MIMO SDMA-OFDM systems. Furthermore, the
GA-JCEMUD is capable of exhibiting a robust performance in overloaded scenarios, where the number
of users is higher than the number of receiver antenna elements, either with or without FEC coding.
This attractive property enables the SDMA-OFDM system potentially to support an increased number
of users.
Note that in this chapter the GA-JCEMUD was used to estimate the CHTFs of a two-tap channel
model, while the value of the parameter K0 was set to 8, which is four times higher than the actual
number of CIR taps. However, we point out that as long as the condition of K0 > 2 is satisﬁed, the
performance of the proposed scheme can be improved upon reducing the value of K0, since more noise
will be removed during the CIR tap ﬁltering process. Furthermore, this implies that, given a ﬁxed value
of K0 which has to be higher than the maximum channel delay spread encountered, the more taps the
channel has, the better the performance of the GA-JCEMUD, as a beneﬁt of having an increased ratio
of the ‘real’ number of CIR taps in comparison with K0.

Chapter Summary
In MIMO-OFDM systems accurate channel estimation is required at the receiver in order to carry out
coherent demodulation and interference cancellation. However, channel estimation is more challenging
in the MIMO scenario than in a SISO scenario, owing to an increased number of independent
transmitter–receiver channel links as well as the interference imposed by multiple transmitter antennas.
Our discussions commenced in Section 8.1 with an extensive review of the family of channel
estimation techniques found in the MIMO-OFDM literature, where a number of channel estimation
approaches including blind [83, 217, 228, 251, 518, 519], pilot-aided [131, 132, 134, 200, 520, 521] and
joint [172,526] estimation schemes have been proposed. However, in the context of BLAST or SDMA
types of multi-user MIMO-OFDM systems, none of the channel estimation techniques found in the
literature [133,156,172,178,200,217,228,251,518,522,526,527] allows the number of users to exceed
that of the receiver antennas. We refer to this as an overloaded scenario, where we have an insufﬁcient
detection degree of freedom, rendering the channel estimation an even more challenging task.
In an effort to overcome the channel estimation problem in overloaded MIMO-OFDM systems, in
this chapter a GA-assisted iterative Joint Channel Estimation and Multi-User Detection (GA-JCEMUD)
approach was proposed. We commenced with an overview of the proposed scheme in Section 8.2, where
we outlined our system schematic in Figure 8.1, followed by a detailed discussion in Section 8.3. The
philosophy of the proposed iterative GA-JCEMUD was portrayed in Figure 8.2, accompanied by our
corresponding elaborations. In Section 8.3.1, we generated initial estimates of the FD-CHTFs with the
aid of pilot OFDM symbols spread by WHT-based spreading codes. On the other hand, the Optimized
Hierarchy Reduced Search Algorithm (OHRSA) MUD [534,535] was employed as a ﬁrst-stage detector
in order to generate initial symbol estimates, as discussed in Section 8.3.2.
With the aid of the initial FD-CHTF and symbol estimates, the proposed GA-JCEMUD printed
in the grey block of Figure 8.2 can be employed for jointly optimizing the estimates of the FD-
CHTFs and multi-user data symbols. This process was detailed in Section 8.3.3. More speciﬁcally,
concerning the MIMO channel’s structure, in Section 8.3.3.1 we introduced the extended structure of
the GA individuals. Following a description of the initialization process in Section 8.3.3.2, the GA-
based joint optimization was presented in Section 8.3.3.3, which consists of a discussion of the cross-
over operators in Section 8.3.3.3.1, the mutation operators in Section 8.3.3.3.2 and further discussions
in Section 8.3.3.3.3. Furthermore, in order to overcome the limitations imposed by the conventional
GA-aided MUDs, which can only provide single-individual hard-decoded symbol estimates, a new
algorithm was derived in Section 8.3.3.4 to enable the GA to provide soft outputs based on the

entire population. Since the only additional operation required by the proposed scheme is to compare
the normalization factor ω = P · L with the OSs, which have already been calculated during the
OF evaluation process carried out by the conventional GAs, the proposed GA generating the above-
mentioned population-based soft outputs imposes only a modest complexity increase in comparison
with its conventional hard-decision individual-based counterpart.
The numerical results of the proposed uncoded and LDPC-coded iterative GA-JCEMUD-aided
SDMA-OFDM system were provided in Section 8.4. As a preliminary investigation, the effect of the
maximum mutation step size λmax used in the GA-JCEMUD was ﬁrst identiﬁed in Section 8.4.1, where
it was found that the choice of λmax has a signiﬁcant impact on the system’s MSE as well as BER
performance, and these effects became more substantial when the SNR was increased. Furthermore,
to attain the best achievable BER performance, typically a higher λmax is required in the scenario
associated with a higher OFDM-symbol-normalized Doppler frequency FD. This is because, when we
have a higher Doppler frequency, the consecutive time-domain channel fades experienced by each of
the subcarriers ﬂuctuate more rapidly, thus requiring a higher λmax value to assist the GA in capturing
the rapid changes of the channel fades. In addition, the values of λmax required to attain the best BER
performance were identiﬁed for different values of FD with the aid of Figure 8.4.
In Section 8.4.2, our research was dedicated to probing the effect of Doppler frequency. As
expected, the performances of both the uncoded and coded GA-JCEMUD-aided systems degraded
when FD was increased. However, when using a low pilot overhead of ϵ = 2.5%, the proposed GA-
JCEMUD/SDMA-OFDM system was capable of achieving a performance close to the perfect-CSI-
aided optimum ML MUD at FD = 0.001, as evidenced in Figure 8.5, while the system employing
the MMSE MUD completely failed even with the aid of perfect CSI. In Section 8.4.3, we showed
that the proposed system’s performance can be improved by increasing the number of GA-JCEMUD
iterations, both with and without channel coding. At an SNR value of about 13 dB, the GA-JCEMUD
using ϵ = 2.5% pilot overhead approached the best-case FD-CHTF estimation MSE performance
associated with ϵ = 100%. When examining the effect of the pilot overhead ϵ, we observed that the
GA-JCEMUD was capable of achieving a good performance using as low a pilot overhead as ϵ = 1.5%
to 2.5% in most of the scenarios considered, as shown in Figure 8.8 of Section 8.4.4.
In order to characterize further the advantages of the proposed joint optimization mechanism,
in Section 8.4.5 we compared the performances of the GA-JCEMUD and its counterpart, namely
the GACE-OHRSA-MUD, which serially concatenates the OHRSA MUD with the stand-alone GA-
aided channel estimator. It was shown that the former outperformed the latter, especially in high-
Doppler scenarios. This demonstrated the superiority of the joint optimization mechanism over the
conventionally combined detection architecture. Moreover, Section 8.4.6 exhibits the further beneﬁts of
the proposed GA-JCEMUD scheme owing to its ability to provide soft outputs. With the advent of FEC
codes, the proposed population-based soft-decoded GA of Section 8.3.3.4 was capable of signiﬁcantly
outperforming the conventional individual-based hard-decoded GAs [38, 459–461, 532], especially
when the channel fades rapidly. This result implies that the proposed GA exhibited a higher robustness
against fast fading channels than the conventional GAs. Finally, in Section 8.4.7 the GA-JCEMUD’s
robustness recorded in MIMO scenarios was veriﬁed. As shown in Figure 8.11, the proposed iterative
GA-JCEMUD was capable of simultaneously capturing the fading envelope changes of each individual
user–receiver link, regardless of its instant variety of fading, and thus achieving an equally good
performance over all the user–receiver links. This result potently demonstrates the robustness of the
proposed approach.

Introduction
9.1.1
System Model
Figure 9.1 shows an SDMA/OFDM Uplink (UL) transmission scenario, where each of the U users is
equipped with a single transmit antenna, while the BS has N receive antenna elements. Based on our
rudimentary discourse on MIMO-OFDM in Section 1.1.1, for each subcarrier the link between each pair
of transmit and receiver antennas may be characterized with the aid of a unique user-speciﬁc FDCTF
denoted as hnu in Figure 9.1. The subscripts of h, i.e. u and n, represent the user and receive antenna
element index at the BS, respectively. For example, the FD-CTF or the spatial signature of the uth user
can be expressed as a column vector:
hu = [h1u, h2u, . . . , hNu]T ,
(9.1)
with u ∈1, . . . , U. If the transmitted signal of the uth user is denoted by su and the received signal plus
the Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) at the nth receive antenna element is represented by yn
and wn, respectively, the entire SDMA/OFDM system can be described on a per-subcarrier basis by a
matrix equation written as
y = Hs + w,
(9.2)
where the received signal’s column vector is y ∈CN×1, the transmitted signal’s column vector is
s ∈CU×1 and the noise’s column vector is w ∈CN×1, which are given by the following equations,
respectively:
y = [y1, y2, . . . , yN]T ,
(9.3)
s = [s1, s2, . . . , sU]T ,
(9.4)
w = [w1, w2, . . . , wN]T .
(9.5)
The FD-CTF matrix H ∈CN×U is constituted by the number U of user-speciﬁc CTF vectors deﬁned
by Equation (9.1), with hu ∈CN×1, where u = 1, 2, . . . , U. Explicitly, the FD-CTF matrix H can be

(9.6)
where each column represents a user’s unique spatial signature. Here, we assume that the FD-CTF
Hnu between user u ∈1, 2, . . . , U and receive antenna element n ∈1, 2, . . . , N are independent,
stationary, complex-valued Gaussian-distributed processes with a zero mean and a unit variance [542].
Furthermore, both the transmitted signal of each of the U users and the AWGN encountered at each of
the N antenna elements exhibit a zero mean and a variance of 2σ2
s and 2σ2
w, respectively.
9.1.2
Maximum Likelihood Detection
The Maximum Likelihood (ML) detector jointly detects the U different users’ complex symbols that
are most likely to have been transmitted. The stylized schematic of the ML detector is shown in
Figure 9.2, where Mc is the constellation size of a speciﬁc modulation scheme. Observe that the received
signal’s column vector y of Equation (9.2) possesses a U-dimensional multi-variate complex-Gaussian
distribution, with a vector of mean values of Hs and a covariance matrix given by Rw ∈CN×N. The
latter is given by
Rw = E{wwH}
(9.7)
= 2σ2
wI,
(9.8)
under the assumption that the noise contributions added at each receive antenna element are uncorre-
lated. Consequently, the a priori probability function of the received signal vector y is equivalent to the
complex Gaussian distribution function, which can be written as [542]
P(y|s, H) = f(y|s, H) =

(9.10)
On the other hand, the basic idea behind the ML detector is to maximize the a posteriori
probability P(ˇs|y, H), where the candidate vector ˇs ∈CU×1 is an element of the set M U
c of trial
vectors which was transmitted over the channel characterized by the channel matrix H ∈CN×U,
and under the condition that the received signal vector is y. Importantly, the relationship between

the a posteriori probability and the a priori probability can be formulated with the aid of Bayes’
theorem [542] as follows:
P(ˇs|y, H) = P(y|ˇs, H) P(ˇs)
P(y),
(9.11)
where P(ˇs) = 1/M U
c is a constant, since it is assumed that all symbol vector probabilities are identical.
Furthermore, since all probabilities have to sum to unity, we have

ˇs∈MU
c
P(ˇs|y, H) = 1.
(9.12)
Additionally, the total probability P(y) can be expressed by
P(y) =

ˆs∈MU
c
P(y|ˇs, H)P(ˇs),
(9.13)
which is also a constant. Consequently, we have
P(ˇs)
P(y) = const,
(9.14)
which leads to the conclusion that, for the ML detector, the problem of ﬁnding the optimum
solutionˆsML which maximizes the a posteriori probability of P(ˇs|y, H) is equivalent to maximizing the
a priori probability of P(y|ˇs, H). Hence, according to Equation (9.10), the problem is also equivalent
to minimizing the Euclidean distance metric ∥y −Hˇs∥2, i.e.
ˆsML = arg min
ˇs∈MU
c
∥y −Hˇs∥2.
(9.15)
The ML detector is capable of achieving the optimum BER performance by jointly detecting all
the U different users’ symbols at the cost of a potentially excessive computational complexity, which
depends on the size of the modulation constellation and/or the number of users supported by the system,
since the ML detector evaluates the Euclidean distance metric of Equation (9.15) for all the possible
transmitted symbol vectors. For example, if an SDMA-OFDM system employs 16-QAM and supports
U = 8 users, a full-search of 232 possibilities will be encountered in order to ﬁnd the optimum solution,
imposing an excessive computational complexity.

Chapter Contributions and Outline
The motivation of ﬁnding a low-complexity solution while achieving a near-ML performance has driven
researchers to develop new algorithms. Recently, inspired by the Sphere Detection (SD) algorithm
originally introduced by Porst and Finke [543] to calculate efﬁciently a vector of short length in a
lattice, Viterbo and Boutros have applied the original SD algorithm in communication systems [544] in
order to approach the ML performance at a complexity which is polynomially, rather than exponentially,
dependent on the number of unknowns, which opened up a whole new research area. Different types of
SDs and complexity reduction schemes have been proposed, for example, in [545–548] for the depth-
ﬁrst SD. By contrast, the schemes proposed in [549–552] were designed for the breadth-ﬁrst SD. As a
beneﬁt of the superior performance of the SD algorithm, it will serve as a key mechanism to reduce the
complexity of diverse MIMO-OFDM scenarios throughout this treatise. Hence, for the sake of further
developing the SD algorithm and applying it to various problems, a comprehensive understanding of
the SD’s operating principle is a vital prerequisite. Thus, the main objective of this chapter is to review
the fundamentals of both the depth-ﬁrst and the breadth-ﬁrst tree search SDs and to carry out in-depth
comparative studies in terms of their corresponding complexity reduction schemes as well as their
achievable performance. More speciﬁcally, the main contributions of this chapter are as follows:
• Compare and analyse the most inﬂuential complexity reduction schemes proposed in the
literature for the conventional depth-ﬁrst SD, the breadth-ﬁrst SD as well as for the recently
proposed OHRSA detector, which may be regarded as an advanced extension of the depth-ﬁrst
SD.
• Extend the performance versus complexity studies of the above-mentioned SD algorithms to
challenging rank-deﬁcient MIMO scenarios.
The outline of this chapter is as follows. In Section 9.2 the SD fundamentals are reviewed, followed
by a discourse on Generalized Sphere Detection (GSD), which are capable of operating in rank-deﬁcient
MIMO systems. The most inﬂuential complexity reduction schemes proposed for the depth-ﬁrst and
breadth-ﬁrst SDs are discussed in Sections 9.3.1 and 9.3.2, respectively. Then, Section 9.3.3 introduces
the recently proposed OHRSA detector and analyses both its hierarchical search structure and its
optimization strategies in comparison with the complexity-reduction schemes of its conventional SD
counterparts. The achievable BER performance versus complexity imposed by the above-mentioned
SDs is characterized in Section 9.4 for both full-rank and rank-deﬁcient MIMO systems. Finally, our
concluding remarks are provided in Section 9.5.

As discussed in Section 9.1.2, the ML solution for an SDMA system of Equation 9.2 can be written as
ˆsML = arg min

∥y −Hˇs∥2,
(9.16)
where Mc is the set of Mc legitimate symbol points in the modulation constellation and U is the
number of users supported by the system. Thus, a potentially excessive-complexity search is likely to
be encountered, depending on the value of Mc and/or U, which prevents the application of the full-
search-based ML detectors in most practical high-throughput scenarios. Fortunately, Equation (9.16)
can be extended as [553]:
ˆsML = arg min

which is the unconstrained ML estimate of s or the LS solution of Equation (9.2). Importantly, the
value of ϕ in Equation (9.18) is independent of the argument ˇs, when minimizing the Objective
Function (OF) of Equation (9.16). Hence, the trial candidate ˇs minimizing ∥y −Hˇs∥2 also minimizes
(ˇs −ˆc)HHHH(ˇs −ˆc), Thus, we have:
ˆsML = arg min
ˇs∈MU
c
(ˇs −ˆc)HHHH(ˇs −ˆc).
(9.20)
In fact, the well-known SD algorithm was derived from the mathematical problem of ﬁnding the shortest
vector in a lattice, which was originally described in [554] and reﬁned in [555]. Even when exploiting
the above-mentioned simpliﬁcations, ﬁnding the ML solution ˆs still has to be carried out on an
exhaustive search basis for the entire M U
c number of legitimate transmitted signal vector combinations.
Therefore, in the following sections, two different types of SD algorithms will be introduced and
compared, which are capable of signiﬁcantly reducing the associated search complexity, namely the
original SD algorithm of [544] which is also referred to as a Depth-First SD and the K-Best SD of [550],
which can be regarded as a Breadth-First SD.
9.2.2
Depth-First Tree Search [544]
For the depth-ﬁrst SD scheme, a search radius C is set in order to limit the search range. Speciﬁcally,
we limit the search according to
(ˇs −ˆc)HHHH(ˇs −ˆc) ≤C,
(9.21)
where C is the Initial Search Radius (ISR), which has to be sufﬁciently high in order to contain the ML
solution of Equation (9.16). Let
G = HHH,
(9.22)
which is a (U × U) Grammian matrix [544]. Thus, we can obtain the (U × U) upper-triangular
matrix U which satisﬁes UHU = HHH with the aid of, for example, the ubiquitous Cholesky factor-
ization [544]. Thus, the entries of the upper-triangular matrix U are denoted by ui,j, satisfying ui,j = 0
if i > j for i, j = 1, 2, . . . , U. Furthermore, the entries on the diagonal of U are denoted by ui,i, which
are assumed to be of positive real value without loss of generality [553]. Consequently, bearing in mind
that the matrix U is upper triangular, we can rewrite Equation (9.21) as
(ˇs −ˆc)HHHH(ˇs −ˆc) = (ˇs −ˆc)HUHU(ˇs −ˆc)

(9.25)
Hence, we can recursively calculate the bound for each ˇsi value with the aid of Equation (9.25), if we
start from i = U. Speciﬁcally, in light of Equation (9.25), we can enumerate legitimate values for ˇsU
based on the following derived criterion as
|ˇsU −ˆcU| ≤
√
C
uU,U .
(9.26)
Then, as indicated by Equation (9.26), after choosing a legitimate symbol value for ˇsU around ˆcU
within a radius of
√
C/uU,U, we can continue to choose a trial legitimate value for ˇsU−1 satisfying the

280

criterion derived from Equation (9.25), which can be expressed as
|uU−1,U−1(ˇsU−1 −ˆcU−1) + uU−1,U(ˇsU −ˆcU)|2 + |uU,U(ˇsU −ˆcU)|2 ≤C,

of

C −|uU,UξU|2/uU−1,U−1 in light of Equation (9.28). The recursive process continues by
choosing a trial candidate for sU−2 based on its corresponding criterion. Following the rationale of
Equation (9.25), the decoupled search space for the ith component ˇsi can be evaluated by

are deﬁned as the decoupled search centre for ˇsi and the accumulated Partial Euclidean Distance (PED)
between ˇsi = [ˇsi ˇsi+1 . . . ˇsU] and the centre ˆci = [ˆci ˆci+1 . . . ˆcU] of the hypersphere, respectively.
Thus, this recursive process can be continued, until i reaches 1. Then the search radius C is updated
by calculating the Euclidean distance between the newly obtained signal point ˇs and the centre ˆc of the
hypersphere, namely the unconstrained ML solution. Equivalently, we have
C = D1.
(9.33)
Following this a new search is carried out within a smaller compound conﬁned by the newly obtained
search radius. The search then proceeds in the same way until no more legitimate signal points can be
found in the increasingly reduced search space. Consequently, the last found legitimate signal point ˇs is
regarded as the ML solution.
To elaborate a little further, the search radius √C −Di+1/ui,i for ˇsi in Equation (9.30) provides
information on how large the remaining search space is that has to be scoured for identifying si.
Moreover, in light of Equations (9.31) and (9.32), the relationship between the decouple search centre
for ˇsi and its corresponding accumulated PED for ˇsi can be expressed as
Di = Di+1 + ui,i|ˇsi −Ci|2,
(9.34)
which indicates that, given a speciﬁc Di+1, the value of Di only depends on the tentative choice for the
current si value.
Intuitively, an astutely selected ISR C can substantially speed up the search process, since the
employment of a small radius excludes a high proportion of the low-probability lattice points at the very
beginning. However, the radius must not be set too small either, since that would jeopardise ﬁnding the
ML solution of Equation (9.16). Hence, the appropriate choice of the ISR is a key factor in determining
both the performance and the complexity imposed by the SD discussed in this chapter. In practice, the
ISR has to be set according to the noise level by obeying [553]

to ensure that the probability of detection failure becomes negligible [544], where N is the number of
receive antenna elements, while J ≥1 is a parameter appropriately selected to ensure that the detector
will indeed capture the true transmitted signal vector s.
The SD algorithm can be interpreted as a geometric problem, which is shown in Figure 9.3, where
the depth-ﬁrst SD is applied to a one-dimensional case, i.e. to a single-user system, for the sake of
convenience. In the example shown in Figure 9.3, the employment of 64-QAM was assumed. At the
receiver, the shape of the constellation is assumed to be distorted to a diamond shape instead of the
original square shape, owing to the routinely encountered multi-path channel-induced phase rotation
and magnitude attenuation. Instead of carrying out a full search over the entire 64-point constellation,
as the ML detection would in order to ﬁnd the statistically optimum solution, the SD initializes the
search radius depending on the estimated SNR, which conﬁnes the search area to the outermost circle
centred at the reconstructed received symbol point yreconstr = Hˆc, where ˆc is the unconstrained ML
solution. As seen from Figure 9.3, the search area is signiﬁcantly reduced in comparison with the ML
detector. It is indeed intuitive that only the trial lattice points in the immediate neighbourhood of the
received point are worth examining. Inside the search area conﬁned by the radius, all the symbols
are deemed to be tentative candidates for the transmitted symbol. Now the core operation of the SD
algorithm is activated. Speciﬁcally, a new radius is calculated by measuring the distance between the
candidate and the reconstructed received symbol point yreconstr, which should be no higher than the
original radius. Then another arbitrary symbol point is chosen from the newly obtained search area as
the trial transmitted point. Again, the search radius is updated with the value of the distance between
the newly obtained trial point and the reconstructed received symbol point yreconstr. These operations
continue, until the detector ﬁnds the speciﬁc legitimate constellation point which is nearest to yreconstr.
At the end of the search, we assume that the last trial point that was found is the ML solution. In the
example shown in Figure 9.3, the detector reaches the optimum ML solution after two radius updates.
Hence, only three trial points are examined in terms of their Euclidean distance with respect to the
reconstructed received symbol point yreconstr. Therefore, the potentially full search carried out by the
ML detector is avoided by the SD.
A better way of illustrating the depth-ﬁrst SD algorithm’s philosophy, when it is applied to multi-
dimensional scenarios, i.e. to multi-user systems, is constituted by the search tree example provided for

the scenario of the (4×4) BPSK-modulated SDMA-OFDM system characterized in Figure 9.4. Before
we elaborate further on the original depth-ﬁrst SD with the aid of the search tree of Figure 9.4, it is
important to note that the SD detector earmarks a legitimate symbol point as the tentative decision
for ˇsi only if the resultant Di of Equation (9.34) is no higher than the search radius C, implying
that the earmarked symbol point for ˇsi is located inside the circle of Equation (9.30) centred at Ci.
Otherwise, this point is not earmarked. As shown in Figure 9.4, the depth-ﬁrst SD commences its
search procedure using an ISR of C = 5 from the top level (i = 4). For each tree node, the number
within brackets denotes the corresponding accumulated PED of that node, while the number outside
the brackets indicates the order in which the node is visited. The dashed line represents a binary zero,
whereas the solid line denotes a binary one. As we can see in Figure 9.4, the search is carried out from
left to right, but in both downward and upward directions along the tree. Speciﬁcally, there are two
scenarios that may be encountered during the tree search portrayed in Figure 9.4. Firstly, the search
may reach a leaf node at the bottom, i.e. the lowest level corresponding to s1 in Figure 9.4. The other
possible scenario is that the detector cannot ﬁnd any point inside the circle of Equation (9.30) for the ith
element si, or, equivalently, the accumulated PEDs of all the candidates for si are higher than the current
search radius C. In the ﬁrst case, once the search reaches a leaf node, e.g. at its ﬁfth step the detector
reaches a tree leaf having a Euclidean distance of 4.2 as shown in Figure 9.4, which is smaller than the
current search radius of C = 5, then the detector starts the search process again with the reduced radius
C = 4.2. In the second case, the detector must have made at least one erroneous tentative point selection
for the previous (U−i) lattice coordinates. In this scenario, the detector goes back to the (i+1)th search
tree level and selects another tentative point for si+1 within the circle formulated by Equation (9.30),
and proceeds downwards along the tree again to try and ﬁnd a legitimate decision for si. If all the
available tentative points for si+1 fail to lead to a legitimate decision, the search backtracks to si+2
with the same objective, and so on. For example, at the ninth step seen in Figure 9.4, the detector is
unable to ﬁnd a legitimate point within the new smaller hypersphere having the radius of 1.8, which
was obtained at the previous step, hence the search backtracks to level i = 4, since no more available
candidates can be found within the corresponding search area for s2, and s3. In the end, after visiting a
total of 15 tree nodes and leaves in Figure 9.4, the SD chooses the tree leaf having a minimum Euclidean
distance of 0.23 and backtracks to the level i = 4 to yield the ﬁnal ML solution ˆsML.

Breadth-First Tree Search [550]
Based on our discussions on the depth-ﬁrst SD algorithm in Section 9.2.2, we can observe that the tree
search is carried out in a depth-ﬁrst manner, with the goal of reaching a leaf node to ensure that the newly
calculated Euclidean distance allows us rapidly to shrink the search hypersphere. However, as we will
see in Section 9.2.5, the computational complexity of the depth-ﬁrst SD depends very much on the ISR
C of Equation (9.35), and the appropriate choice of C constitutes a design challenge. Therefore, another
tree search scheme was proposed to circumvent this problem based on the idea of searching the tree in
a breadth-ﬁrst manner by limiting the number of tree nodes to be expanded to K, where K denotes the
maximum number of nodes having the K lowest accumulated PEDs at every level of the tree. Hence,
the computational complexity of the tree search is reduced, while circumventing the problem of ﬁnding
an appropriate choice of the ISR. More importantly, an SNR-independent computational complexity is
expected and the search is guaranteed to be carried out in the downward direction along the tree.
The search tree of the K-best SD algorithm using K = 2 is shown in Figure 9.5, which was
applied to the same example of Figure 9.4, where the depth-ﬁrst SD algorithm was employed. Since
we use K = 2, following the evaluation of the PEDs of all nodes at a certain level, only the two
nodes having the lowest PEDs are expanded or pursued further at each level. Consequently, the detector
successfully ﬁnds the ML solution to a high probability, which has a Euclidean distance of D1 = 0.23
in Figure 9.5 with respect to the centre ˆc of the search hypersphere. Comparing the two expanded
search trees portrayed in Figure 9.4 and Figure 9.5, we can see that a higher complexity reduction was
achieved by the K-best SD detector. However, we cannot simply conclude that the K-best SD is always
better than its depth-ﬁrst counterpart, since upon reducing the ISR of the latter, a higher complexity
reduction may be expected to be attained. On the other hand, if K is set to an excessively low value,
such as K = 1 for example, the K-best SD becomes unable to ﬁnd the true ML solution owing to
the fact that the detector discontinues the search along the true ML branch as early as the fourth level
in Figure 9.5 by choosing to expand and pursue a node having a PED of 0.17. Therefore, the K-best
SD does not necessarily arrive at the ML solution, while the depth-ﬁrst SD does. More discussions on
the comparison of these two SDs in terms of achievable performance and imposed complexity will be
carried out based on the simulation results in Sections 9.2.5 and 9.4.

9.2.4
Generalized Sphere Detection (GSD) for Rank-Deﬁcient Systems
Our discussions in the previous sections implied the assumption that the number of users U, or
the number of the transmit antennas M, is no more than that of the receive antennas N, i.e. we
have U, M ≤N. However, this is not always the case in practice, e.g. when SD is implemented in
a typical downlink of an SDM-OFDM system, where the number of antenna elements employed by the
BS exceeds that used at the MS. In this scenario the channel matrix H of Equation (9.6) becomes non-
invertible and hence the system is referred to as rank deﬁcient, where the SDs discussed in Section 9.2
fail to work. Recall that the SD applied in a MIMO system, where the number of transmit antennas M is
no higher than the number of receive antennas N, i.e. M ≤N, the QR decomposition or the Cholesky
factorization has to be invoked for decomposing the Grammian matrix G = HT H in order to obtain
the upper-triangular matrix U having a rank of M, which is identical to the length of the transmitted
MIMO symbol vector s. However, for rank-deﬁcient systems the rank of the matrix H is lower than
the number of transmitted symbols to be estimated, which in turn results in zero elements along the
diagonal of the upper-triangular matrix U. Recall that in the decoupled search space of Equation (9.30)
for the ith component ˇsi in SD, written here as
|ˇsi −Ci| ≤
√C −Di+1
ui,i
,
(9.36)
all the diagonal elements ui,i have to be non-zero integers. Similarly, the Cholesky decomposition will
also fail since the matrix G = HT H is no longer positive deﬁnite. Hence two different techniques of
circumventing this problem will be brieﬂy introduced in Sections 9.2.4.1 and 9.2.4.2.
9.2.4.1
GSD [556]
After examining the resultant upper-triangular matrix U evaluated by the QR decomposition in the
context of a rank-deﬁcient system where M > N, it may be readily shown that the diagonal elements
in the ﬁrst N rows of the (M × M) matrix U are non-zero, while the diagonal elements in the
remaining (M −N) rows are zero. Hence, if U is partitioned so that the ﬁrst N rows and the
remaining (M −N) rows are separated, we can use the resultant (N × M) matrix that has non-
zero diagonal elements for the SD of the ﬁrst N transmitted symbols based on one of the M (M−N)
c
possible combinations of the remaining (M −N) symbols. Essentially, this GSD algorithm [556]
can be considered as the combination of the SD for the ﬁrst N transmitted symbols in s and the full
ML detection of the remaining (M −N) symbols, which is a conceptually straightforward method
that eliminates the problem of having zero diagonal elements in the upper-triangular matrix U of a
rank-deﬁcient MIMO system. The SD scheme invoked in the GSD can be any of the SDs discussed in
Sections 9.2.2 and 9.2.3.
Owing to the fact that only N symbols are detected by using low-complexity SD, while all
possible M (M−N)
c
combinations of the remaining (M −N) symbols have to be tested by the ML
detector, the complexity of this GSD scheme is expected to be high, especially when the number of
the transmit antennas is signiﬁcantly higher than that of the receive antennas, i.e. when M ≫N.
More quantitatively, the resultant complexity is an exponential function of (M −N) [557], potentially
preventing its practical application. Thus, our forthcoming discussions will be focused on the design of
more efﬁcient SDs applicable to rank-deﬁcient systems.
9.2.4.2
GSD Using a Modiﬁed Grammian Matrix [557]
In Section 9.2.4.1, a particular partitioning of the matrix U is conducted in order to circumvent the
problem of having zero diagonal elements. In this section, a different GSD scheme will be discussed,
which carries out the Cholesky factorization of a modiﬁed Grammian matrix ˜G in order to obtain
an upper-triangular matrix U having non-zero diagonal elements. The basic idea behind the GSD
algorithm of [557] is that, under the assumption of using a constant modulus modulation scheme, such

9.2.5. Simulation Results
285
as BPSK and QPSK, which implies that every element in the signal vector ˇs has a constant modulus,
the product αˇs∗
i ˇsi becomes a constant value of α under the assumption of unitary transmit power.
Consequently, we have an equivalent ML solution for the corresponding SD formulated as [557]
ˆsML = arg min
ˇs∈MM
c
{∥y −Hˇs∥2
2 + αˇsHˇs}
(9.37)

(9.39)
and I represents the identity matrix. Normally, α is set to be the noise variance 2σ2
w, i.e. we arrive at
ˆc = (HHH + 2σ2
wI)−1HHy,
(9.40)
which is the MMSE solution of Equation (9.2).
Since the last term denoted by the ϕ portion of Equation (9.38) is independent of the value of ˇs,
Equation (9.38) can be simpliﬁed as
ˆsML = arg min
ˇs∈MM
c
{(ˇs −ˆc)H ˜G(ˇs −ˆc)}.
(9.41)
Furthermore, the modiﬁed Grammian matrix, ˜G, is always Hermitian and positive deﬁnite in contrast to
the original Grammian matrix G = HHH. Hence, the modiﬁed Grammian matrix ˜G can be Cholesky
factorized in order to attain an upper-triangular matrix U having non-zero diagonal elements, regardless
of the rank of the matrix H, i.e. we have ˜G = UHU. Consequently, the metric of the GSD can be
expressed based on Equation (9.41) as
ˆsML = arg min
ˇs∈MM
c
{(ˇs −ˆc)HUHU(ˇs −ˆc)},
(9.42)
which is in a form identical to that of Equation (9.20) for the full-rank scenario. Finally, owing to
the fact that all diagonal elements in U are now non-zero, the standard SD tree search algorithm of
Sections 9.2.2 and 9.2.3 can be applied to Equation (9.42).
9.2.5
Simulation Results
In this section, the achievable performance versus the complexity imposed by the SD is discussed
and analysed in comparison with conventional ML detection based on our simulation results. The
system parameters used in all of our simulations throughout the chapter are shown in Table 9.1.
Note that the power delay proﬁle of the three-path frequency-selective channel is given by P(τ) =
2
k=0 P(τk)δ(t −kτ), where τ is the delay spread and we have P(τk) = [0.5 0.3 0.2] for k = 0, 1, 2.
It is assumed that each user has a single transmit antenna and perfect FD-CHTF estimation is available
in all the simulations. The ISR of the depth-ﬁrst SD was adjusted according to the SNR level [553].
Speciﬁcally, we used the setting of C = 2σ2
wJN , where the parameter J was chosen to satisfy J ≥1,
while N is the number of receive antennas.
• BER Performance and Computational Complexity Versus SNR
Both the BER performance achieved and the computational complexity imposed by the ML as
well as by the aforementioned two types of SD algorithms are shown in Figure 9.6 for the fully

The BER curves of both the depth-ﬁrst SD and the K-best SD (K = 16) virtually coincide with
that of the ML detector. The y-axis on the right quantiﬁes the algorithm’s complexity expressed
in terms of the number of real-valued additions and multiplications versus Eb/N0, as shown
by the dashed line. As seen from Figure 9.6, both SD algorithms are capable of approaching
the ML performance at a signiﬁcantly lower complexity compared with the ML detector. More
importantly, upon comparing the depth-ﬁrst SD and the K-best SD detectors, we found that the
former, which carries out the tree search in a depth-ﬁrst manner, exhibits a complexity dependent
on Eb/N0. Speciﬁcally, the higher the received signal power, the lower the computational
complexity. Since the complexity of the depth-ﬁrst SD is variable, it is less suitable for real-
time implementation [550]. This phenomenon can be explained as follows. When the signal y
is received at a higher SNR, the ML solution is typically closer to the search centre ˆc of the
hypersphere search space, which is obtained either by the LS algorithm of Equation (9.19) or by
the MMSE algorithm of Equation (9.40). Hence the ISR can be set to a smaller value, in order
to avoid a time-consuming search within a large hypersphere. Therefore, in our simulations, the
ISR C was set according to the noise level, as mentioned previously. On the other hand, the
K-best SD detector exhibits a constant computational complexity, since its complexity depends
only on the maximum number of nodes K to be considered for each search tree level, on the
modulation scheme used and on the number of transmit antennas employed. Hence, when all
these parameters are ﬁxed, the complexity of the K-best SD remains constant. It is observed
from Figure 9.6 that the complexity imposed by the K-best SD is signiﬁcantly lower than that
imposed by its depth-ﬁrst counterpart, when the SNR is low, while the former becomes slightly
higher than the latter when the SNR encountered is high.
• Complexity Versus the Number of Transmit Antennas or Users
Figure 9.7 portrays the complexity of both the ML and the SDs versus the number of users U
in the scenario of a fully loaded 4-QAM SDMA-OFDM system. Observe in Figure 9.7 that the
ML detector’s complexity increases exponentially with U, which is independent of the value of
the SNR, since the ML detector jointly detects the number U of users, imposing a potentially
excessive computational complexity of M U
c Euclidean distance metric evaluations between all
possible tentative transmitted signal vectors ˇs and the received signal vector y. As shown in
Figure 9.7, a signiﬁcant complexity gain is achieved by both types of SDs over the ML detector,
which further escalates as the number of transmit antennas increases. Again, the complexity of
the depth-ﬁrst SD is dependent on the SNR, while the K-best SD exhibits an SNR-independent
complexity, as observed in Figure 9.7. According to [558], the order of SD complexity in the
context of an m-dimensional lattice is at most O(m4.5) at low SNRs, and O(m3) at high SNRs.
Again, we can observe from Figure 9.7 that the K-best SD (K = 16) exhibits a signiﬁcantly

lower complexity than its depth-ﬁrst counterpart at an SNR of 4 dB, while it exhibits a complexity
slightly higher when the SNR is 20 dB.
• Effects of K on the BER Performance and the Complexity of K-best SD
Figure 9.8 reveals the effects of the parameter K on both the achievable BER performance and
the computational complexity of the K-best SD detector. Observe in Figure 9.8 that K has to
be set to at least 16 for the SD to approach the ML detector’s performance. However, setting
K to be lower than that would reduce the computational complexity imposed, as the dashed
line representing the complexity versus Eb/N0 trend indicates, which is achieved at the cost
of a degradation in BER performance. The same conclusion can be drawn from Figure 9.8 as
deduced from Figure 9.6 earlier, i.e. the complexity of the K-best SD algorithm is independent
of the received signal power. Thus, for a given scenario, the trade-off between the achievable
BER performance and the computational complexity imposed is effectively controlled by the
choice of K.
• Effects of the ISR on the Complexity of Depth-First SD
From our previous results shown in Figure 9.6 we infer that the complexity of the SD may vary
as the received signal’s SNR changes. Essentially, the complexity of the SD is dependent on the
speciﬁc choice of the ISR C that conﬁnes the search area, which in turn determines the efﬁciency
of the search. Figure 9.9 offers an insight into the dependence of the SD’s complexity on the ISR
C. The associated complexity increases signiﬁcantly as C is increased. Therefore, a judicious
choice of the ISR plays a vital role in determining both the performance and the complexity of
the SD scheme. If it is set too small, the resultant initial search space may not contain the ML
solution. On the other hand, it should not be set too high, otherwise a near-exhaustive search may
be encountered.

9.3.1.1
ISR Selection Optimization [548]
From our previous discussions based on the simulation results of Figure 9.9, we know that the choice of
the ISR is crucial as regards the performance of the depth-ﬁrst SD. Hence, the key to further reducing
the associated complexity is to optimize the ISR selection. All our simulations characterized so far
have employed an experimentally motivated ISR scheme, where the ISR C is deﬁned as C = 2σ2
wJN ,
where the parameter J is chosen to satisfy J ≥1, while N represents the number of receive antennas.
However, this ISR scheme is suboptimal, since it is unable to guarantee that there is always at least
one legitimate signal point within the initial hypersphere, potentially leading to a decoding failure.
The failure may require a second tentative decoding using a larger ISR and hence wastes valuable
computational resources. Two other ISR selection schemes are investigated in this section, namely
the MMSE-based ISR selection and a hybrid scheme, which is constituted by a contribution from the
previous two schemes:
• MMSE-Based ISR Selection Scheme
The idea behind this ISR selection scheme is appealingly simple. In order to guarantee successful
decoding, the ISR is set to the Euclidean distance between the received signal point y and the
MMSE-solution-based reconstructed received signal ymmse, which can be expressed as [548]
ˆymmse = Hˆsmmse,
(9.43)
where ˆsmmse is the hard-decision-based MMSE solution, which can be written as
ˆsmmse = (HHH + 2σ2
wI)−1HHy.

As expected, the ISR C can be formulated as
C = ∥y −ymmse∥2.
(9.45)
• Hybrid ISR Selection Scheme
The hybrid ISR selection scheme obtains its ISR based on a combination of the above-mentioned
experimentally adjusted solution and the MMSE-based solution. Speciﬁcally, we assume that C1
and C2 are the ISRs calculated by the aforementioned two ISR schemes, respectively. In order
to achieve a reduced complexity, the hybrid ISR scheme opts for the smaller of the two, i.e. for
C = min(C1, C2).
(9.46)
Our comparison of the three previously discussed ISR schemes is provided in Figure 9.10, which
suggests that the hybrid ISR scheme achieves the lowest complexity over the entire SNR range
of interest. However, it suffers from the same problem of potential decoding failure as the pure
experimentally adjusted ISR scheme. On the other hand, the MMSE-based ISR is the most reliable
one in terms of guaranteeing successful sphere decoding [548]. In terms of complexity, the MMSE-
based scheme outperforms the experimentally motivated arrangement at low SNRs while imposing a
higher complexity at high SNRs.
9.3.1.2
Optimal Detection Ordering [559]
In the context of an SDMA system supporting U transmitted data streams, the original SD algorithm
of [560] commences the detection of symbols from the Uth signal component to the ﬁrst one, without
considering any speciﬁcally beneﬁcial detection order. However, if we expand the ML error formula of

Equation (9.25), we get
Err ml =

(9.48)
+ |uU−2,U−2ξU−2 + uU−2,U−1ξU−1 + uU−2,UξU|2 + . . . ,
(9.49)
where ξi = ˇsi −ˆci. Then we can observe in Equation (9.49) that the transmitted symbol ˇsU appears U
times in the above summation, ˇsU−1 appears (U−1) times, . . . , and ˇs1 appears only once. Based on this
observation, we infer that the correct detection probability of the ﬁrst detected symbol ˇsU has an impact
on all of the following (U −1) detection steps, while the weight of ˇsU−1 is somewhat lower, since it
has an impact only on the next (U −2) steps etc. In other words, the highest-quality signal in terms of
SNR should be detected ﬁrst. This philosophy is the essence of the detection ordering technique, which
is a key advance applied for example in the context of the V-BLAST system [561].
Under the assumption that each transmitted stream has an identical transmit power and that each
signal experiences the same amount of noise after passing through the channel, the received signal xm
of the mth transmitted signal component can be written as
yu =
N

n=1
hnu · su,
(9.50)
where the noise term is omitted here for convenience and hnu represents the FD-CHTF between the uth
user and the nth receive antenna, while hu is the uth column of the FD-CHTF matrix H. Hence, we
can see that the SNR of the uth signal component is proportional to the norm of its corresponding
column hu in the FD-CHTF matrix H. Bearing in mind the above-mentioned rationale of detection
ordering, the norm of the column vector hu (u = 1, 2, . . . , U) is ordered as
∥h1∥≤∥h2∥≤· · · ≤∥hU∥.
(9.51)
Consequently, when the SD is applied to this reordered FD-CHTF matrix H, the detection ofˇs proceeds
in a descending order of the channel SNR, which may be estimated with the aid of frequency-domain
pilots. After ﬁnding the ML solution, the resultant vector ˆs of modulated symbols has to be reordered
again, according to the symbol positions of the original sequence. The complexity reduction facilitated
by the most beneﬁcial detection ordering scheme is revealed in Figure 9.11.
9.3.1.3
Search Algorithm Optimization
9.3.1.3.1
Sorted Sphere Detection (SSD)
Although the depth-ﬁrst SD scheme [544] of Section 9.2.2 is capable of approaching the ML
performance at a signiﬁcantly reduced complexity, it does not operate efﬁciently at every search step. In
fact, the search commences from the surface of the sphere towards the centre. The search carried out in
this order does not take into account the deﬁnition of the ML solution, which is deﬁned by that speciﬁc
valid lattice point which is closest to the centre ˆc of the search sphere [545]. Therefore, the SD follows
a zigzag-shaped search trajectory from the surface of the sphere towards its centre ˆc as the search for
the ML solution proceeds, which is not as efﬁcient as it could be.
Thus, modiﬁcations can be introduced in the search order of the SD algorithm in order to reduce its
complexity further. Bearing in mind the aforementioned deﬁnition of the ML solution, the modiﬁed SD
should commence its search near the centre of the sphere. Consequently, a reduced-complexity SD was
proposed in [545], where the elements in the candidate set Bi for the ith signal component ˇsi are ﬁrst
sorted in ascending order according to the metric
|ˇsi −Ci|,

in which Ci given by Equation (9.31) represents the decoupled centre of the search area of Equa-
tion (9.30) for ˇsi. Essentially, upon sorting the legitimate candidates for ˇsi according to their distance
from the decoupled search centre Ci of Equation (9.31), the modiﬁed algorithm commences its search
from the most promising lattice point. Thus, the SD complexity is expected to be signiﬁcantly reduced
by the rapid reduced search radius. We refer to this modiﬁed SD scheme as the Sorted Sphere
Detection (SSD) algorithm, which is expected to exhibit a reduced complexity.
9.3.1.3.2
SSD Using Updated Bounds
Another SD method operating on the basis of SSD was proposed in [545], which is capable of achieving
an even lower complexity. Speciﬁcally, when a new candidate lattice point is found within the search
hypersphere, in addition to updating the search radius, the following three modiﬁcations are introduced:
1. The decouple search areas of Equation (9.30) recorded for all candidate basis sets Bi (i =
1, 2, . . . , U) are also updated immediately with the aid of the most recently obtained lattice
point.
2. The next round of the search is carried out commencing from ˇs1, instead of ˇsU.
3. The new search for ˇsi is carried out without going back to start from the ﬁrst component in the
newly obtained smaller candidate set Bi.
Note that the immediate update of the decoupled search area of Equation (9.30) for each tree search level
actually eliminates some of the search candidates at the rightmost end of the sorted set Bi, but with its
leftmost end unchanged [545]. This facilitates the above-mentioned third action, which in turn allows
the SD to avoid searching candidates already identiﬁed during the last round of the search. Finally, we
refer to this modiﬁed SD scheme as the Updated-Bound-aided SSD (SSD-UB).

9.3.1.3.3
SSD Using Termination Threshold
A more intuitive approach that retains most of the beneﬁts of the SSD reduces the complexity further by
introducing a search-termination threshold t [559] informing the SD to curtail the search when the ML
error term of Equation (9.20) becomes lower than t, where the ML error refers to the newly obtained
squared search radius of Equation (9.33). This procedure aims to avoid testing all possible tentative ML
solution points one by one, which is time consuming. Recall that the SSD reorders the components in
the ith basis set Bi, which contains all the tentative points within the search hypersphere for the ith
signal component ˇsi, in ascending order according to the metric given by Equation (9.52). Therefore,
the point considered ﬁrst in the set Bi is the most promising one. Thus, with the aid of the termination
threshold t, the search procedure may be curtailed, provided that the newly obtained lattice point is
sufﬁciently close to the received signal. Hence, the appropriate choice of the termination threshold is
the key point for ensuring the efﬁciency of this reduced-complexity SD. Speciﬁcally, if the termination
threshold t is set too small, it does not have any effect, since it is unlikely that the ML error would be
smaller than t. On the other hand, if t is too large, the search for the ML solution may be curtailed when
it tests a non-ML point, whose distance from the received symbol point is less than t. In this scenario,
the complexity imposed can be further reduced at the cost of a degradation in performance. A judicious
choice of the termination threshold t is given by [559]
t = τ · U · 2σ2
w,
(9.53)
where U is the number of users, σ2
w is the noise level and τ is a parameter typically set to 0.1, 0.3, etc.
Consequently, the termination threshold should be set proportional to the number of transmit antennas
as well as to the noise power. In this treatise, we refer to this reduced-complexity SD as the Termination-
Threshold-aided SSD (SSD-TT). As shown in Figure 9.12, there is a trade-off between the achievable

performance and the complexity imposed by the SD, which is controlled by the appropriate choice of
the termination threshold.
Let us now compare the search algorithm optimization schemes discussed in this section in
Figure 9.13. Our comparisons are carried out in the scenarios of both (8×8)-element 4-QAM and (4×
4)-element 16-QAM SDMA-OFDM systems, which have an identical throughput of 16 bits per symbol.
In both cases, the updated-bound-assisted SD achieves a signiﬁcantly lower computational complexity
than the termination-threshold-assisted arrangement, rendering it a more effective complexity-reduction
scheme. The termination-threshold-assisted scheme is capable of attaining an evident complexity
reduction when the SNR is relatively low, while imposing only a slightly lower complexity than the
original SD of [560] when the SNR is in excess of 17.5 dB. On the other hand, when comparing two
different SDMA-OFDM systems, we found that the (8 × 8)-antenna 4-QAM system substantially
outperforms the (4 × 4)-element 16-QAM system in terms of achievable BER, as a beneﬁt of its
higher diversity gain and its lower-density modulation constellation, while imposing an acceptable
computational complexity. More speciﬁcally, for a given target BER of 10−5, we have an SNR gain of
about 9 dB if the (8×8)-antenna 4-QAM scheme is employed, rather than the (4×4)-element 16-QAM
arrangement. This is achieved at the cost of less than three times increased computational complexity,
as quantiﬁed in terms of the number of real-valued additions and multiplications per received signal
vector, when the updated-bound-assisted scheme is employed.
In addition to their reduced complexity, the search algorithm optimization schemes discussed in
this section have a further beneﬁt of rendering the complexity of the SD less sensitive to the speciﬁc
choice of the ISR, which can be observed from Figure 9.14.

optimization scheme introduced in Section 9.3.1.2, which is capable of effectively reducing the
complexity of the depth-ﬁrst SD, was found suitable also for the K-best SD, which achieved a similar
performance to that shown in Figure 9.11. For a rudimentary introduction to this scheme, refer to
Section 9.3.1.2.
9.3.2.2
Search-Radius-Aided K-Best SD
Based on the portrayal of the K-best SD in Sections 9.2.3 and 9.2.5, it becomes explicit that its
computational complexity is controlled by the parameter K, for a certain modulation scheme and a
certain number of transmit antennas or users. This is in contrast to its depth-ﬁrst counterpart, which
achieves a low complexity, despite approaching the ML performance with the aid of rapid shrinking
of the original search radius. Intuitively, if we can introduce a search radius for employment in the K-
best SD, its complexity can be further reduced by discarding the unlikely ML candidate nodes which
are located outside the sphere conﬁned by the search radius, thus reducing the number of tentative
nodes at each level. Consequently, since the partial Euclidean distances evaluated for some of the nodes
exceed the radius, there may be less than K nodes that have to be considered for each level, resulting
in an additional complexity reduction. In contrast to the gradually reduced radius of the depth-ﬁrst SD
algorithm, the radius used for the K-best SD remains unchanged during the entire search process, since
it carries out the tree search in the downwards direction only and the search is ceased whenever it reaches
tree leaf level, i.e. the lowest level of the tree exempliﬁed in Figure 9.5. Hence, exactly the same search
radius selection problem is encountered by the K-best SD, as faced by the depth-ﬁrst SD. In order to
avoid having no lattice points inside the sphere, which in turn results in a repeated search using an
increased radius, the radius selection schemes used for the K-best SD should guarantee that at least one
lattice point is located in the search sphere. In this report, two radius selection schemes for K-best SD
will be examined, namely the LS-Criterion-Based and the MMSE-Criterion-Based radius calculation
schemes; the latter has already been discussed in the context of depth-ﬁrst SD in Section 9.3.1.1.

Figure 9.15: Complexity versus SNR of the radius-based K-best SD.
In Figure 9.15 we characterize these two radius-based K-best SDs and the original K-best SD of
Section 9.2.3 [550], where we ﬁnd that a signiﬁcantly lower complexity can be achieved by both of the
radius-based K-best SDs, compared with the original K-best SD of [550]. Hence, the radius-based K-
best SD no longer exhibits an SNR-independent complexity as characterized in Figure 9.15, because a
higher complexity reduction can be attained when the SNR increases. On the other hand, the complexity
of the MMSE-criterion-based radius scheme of Section 9.3.1.1 is evidently lower than that of the LS-
criterion-based radius scheme, owing to the fact that the former scheme is expected to operate using
a smaller search radius which is capable of reducing the number of nodes at each level that would be
expanded.
9.3.2.3
Complexity-Reduction Parameter δ for Low SNRs
Although the complexity of K-best SD can be signiﬁcantly reduced by introducing a search radius, it
still exhibits a relatively high complexity when the SNR is low, as we can observe from Figure 9.15.
Intuitively, when the noise level is high, i.e. at low SNRs, investing excessive detection efforts in
terms of a large search space becomes futile. This will become more explicit by considering the ML
detector which has a high computational complexity and yet hardly achieves any performance gain
in comparison with the MMSE detector, for example, when the SNR is low. In order to mitigate the
problem, we introduce a complexity-reduction parameter δ, which allows us to reduce the complexity
of the K-best SD when the SNR is low. A similar parameter γ was employed in the OHRSA detector
of [562] in order to control its complexity, which will be discussed in Section 9.3.3.
The parameter δ is used as follows. When the SNR corresponding to the currently detected ith
signal component is lower than δ, i.e. we have ∥hi∥2/σ2
w < δ, only the tentative constellation point
yielding the smallest value of |si −Ci| is considered, rather than testing all the original K candidates.
Moreover, owing to the employment of the detection ordering optimization scheme of Section 9.3.1.2,
the SNRs associated with the signal components about to be detected, i.e. ˇsi−1, ˇsi−2, . . . , ˇs1, will also
be lower than δ. Thus, only a single tentative point will be enumerated, which in fact represents the ﬁnal
decision for the corresponding signal components.

on the y-axis on the left represent the BER performance, while the dashed lines scaled on the y-axis on
the right show the corresponding complexity.
Consequently, the complexity associated with a low SNR is signiﬁcantly reduced at the cost of
a modest BER performance degradation, provided that we choose the value of δ appropriately, as
observed in Figure 9.16. Speciﬁcally, if δ is chosen to be 10 for the K-best SD (K = 16) in the scenario
of a (4× 4)-antenna 16-QAM SDMA-OFDM system, the corresponding BER curve is almost the same
as the ML curve, but the corresponding complexity curve indicates a signiﬁcantly lower complexity
which coincides with the K = 1 complexity bound for the SNR range spanning from 0 to 6 dB.
In other words, with the aid of δ, the original computationally demanding low-SNR range imposes a
computational complexity associated with the case of K = 1.
9.3.3
OHRSA – An Advanced Extension of SD
9.3.3.1
Hierarchical Search Structure
Recently, another advanced tree search detection method, referred to as the OHRSA, was proposed
in [563] as an extension of the conventional depth-ﬁrst SD, which is capable of further reducing the
detection complexity. Since its pre-processing stage actually employs exactly the same strategy as the
GSD discussed in Section 9.2.4.2, the OHRSA may also be readily applied to rank-deﬁcient MIMO
systems, where the number of transmit antennas or users exceeds that of the receive antennas. Hence,
the emphasis of this section will be on the search philosophy.
In order to enable the OHRSA detector to handle rank-deﬁcient scenarios, the Grammian matrix ˜G
of Equation (9.39) is employed, which can be Cholesky factorized to obtain the upper-triangular matrix
U. Thus, the OF of the OHRSA may be formulated in a similar manner to the conventional SDs by

298

Furthermore, according to [563], the so-called Cumulative Sub-Cost Function (CSCF) Ji(ˇsi) is
deﬁned recursively as

(9.64)
whereˇsi is deﬁned as the candidate subvector given byˇsi = [ˇsi, . . . , ˇsU]. According to Equation (9.64),
a recursive search can be carried out starting from the calculation of JM(ˇsM). At the ith recursive step,
a tentative candidate ˇsi is selected from the set of Mc possible hypotheses for the transmitted signal si
associated with the ith user. Then, based on the value of the tentative candidate ˇsi, Ji(ˇsi) is evaluated,
which depends only on the tentative values of ˇsj, where j = i, i + 1, . . . , U. The recursive calculation
of the SCF Ji(ˇs) proceeds until i reaches 1. The resultant OF of J(ˇs) is equal to the value of the CSC
function J1(ˇsi), i.e.
J(ˇs) = J1(ˇs1),
(9.65)
which can be derived from Equation (9.56) and Equation (9.64). Hence, a recursive search process
may be formulated on the basis of Equation (9.64) for testing all legitimate tentative signal vectors ˇs
and then the value of its corresponding OF J(ˇs) is stored. Then i is reset to U, and according to
Equation (9.64) a new recursive process is commenced from the calculation of JU(ˇsU). Finally, after
an exhaustive computation of all the M U

hypothesized signal vectors ˇs, the ML solution is guaranteed to be found as the one associated with
the lowest value of J(ˇs). The recursive hierarchical search formulated in Equation (9.64) is in fact also
carried out in the conventional depth-ﬁrst SD algorithms of Section 9.2.2, but with a signiﬁcantly small
search space (i.e. within the search hypersphere) given by the search radius, which is updated once a
hypothesized signal vector ˇs is obtained. Essentially, the recursive hierarchical search discussed so far
in this section is the same as the full search technique employed in conventional ML detectors, which
exhibits a potentially excessive complexity if a high-throughput modulation scheme is employed or a
high number of users are supported by the system. Instead of introducing a search radius to conﬁne
the search area of the SD, the OHRSA invokes several optimization rules on the basis of exploiting
the properties of the CSCF Ji(ˇsi) of Equation (9.64). Note that the SCF φi given by Equation (9.57)
is always positive, therefore the value of the CSCF Ji(ˇsi) monotonically increases as the hierarchical
search continues. Speciﬁcally, we have
J(ˇs) = J1(ˇs1) > J2(ˇs2) > · · · > JM(ˇsM) > 0.
(9.66)
The hierarchical search structure combined with the property given by Equation (9.66) allow the search
process to achieve a signiﬁcant complexity reduction, which will be considered in the next section in
comparison with the complexity-reduction techniques discussed for the depth-ﬁrst SD in Section 9.3.1,
since the OHRSA detector also falls into the category of depth-ﬁrst SDs.
9.3.3.2
Optimization Strategies for the OHRSA Versus Complexity-Reduction Techniques for
the Depth-First SD
In Section 9.3.3.1 we argued that the conventional depth-ﬁrst SD of Section 9.2.2 and the OHRSA
algorithms share the same recursive hierarchical search structure. Given the aim of decreasing the
number of OF evaluations required for ﬁnding the ML solution, the optimization strategy of OHRSA
will be contrasted to the complexity-reduction techniques of SD in our following discourse.
9.3.3.2.1
Best-First Detection Strategy
This strategy is identical to the detection ordering optimization technique discussed in Section 9.3.1.2
for the depth-ﬁrst SD. Brieﬂy, the best-ﬁrst detection strategy entails detecting the received signals in a
descending order according to their received signal quality expressed in terms of the SNR encountered,
which is proportional to the norm of its corresponding column vector in the channel transfer function
matrix H of Equation (9.6). The corresponding mathematical proof was provided in Section 9.3.1.2 and
will not be restated here.
9.3.3.2.2
Sorting Criterion
Recall that in the SSD technique of Section 9.3.1.3, the elements in the resultant tentative candidate
set Bi delimited by the decoupled search area of Equation (9.30) for the speciﬁc signal component ˇsi
are sorted in an ascending order according to their distance from the decoupled search centre Ci of
Equation (9.31). The rationale of this was based on the idea that the ML solution is likely to be located
near the centre of the decoupled search area. Thus the SD becomes capable of promptly ﬁnding the ML
solution, avoiding a ‘zigzagging’ search from the surface of the sphere to the ML solution, which is
closest to the centre ˆc of the hypersphere.
The rationale of the SSD of Section 9.3.1.3.1 can be transplanted into the OHRSA, despite the fact
that their mathematical sorting criteria are quite different from each other. To expound a little further,
for the OHRSA, there is no need for the concept of a search radius and corresponding search sphere,
which is the basic difference between the OHRSA and the conventional SD of Section 9.2.2. However,
bearing in mind the deﬁnition of the ML solution and the speciﬁc property of the OHRSA formulated in
Equation (9.66), another scheme capable of achieving the same objective of avoiding futile search steps
may be devised. Speciﬁcally, in the context of the OHRSA, the ML solution sML, can be interpreted as

300
Chapter 9. Reduced-Complexity SD for Uncoded SDMA-OFDM Systems
the tentative signal vector ˇs whose corresponding OF J(ˇs) is the smallest one. On the other hand, the
CSCF of Equation (9.64) is increased cumulatively as the recursive search proceeds from ˇsU to ˇs1 and
hence we arrive at the ﬁnal value of the OF J(ˇs) formulated in Equation (9.66) which is repeated here
for convenience:
J(ˇs) = J1(ˇs1) > J2(ˇs2) > · · · > JU(ˇsU) > 0.
(9.67)
Let us now rewrite Equation (9.64) as follows:
Ji(ˇsi) = Ji+1(ˇsi+1) + φi(ˇsi),
i = 1, . . . , U −1.
(9.68)
Based on the above two equations, it is intuitive that in order to arrive at the lowest possible OF
value J(ˇs) after a single cycle of the recursive search loop is completed, the increment φi(ˇsi) seen
in Equation (9.68) should be as small as possible at each recursive step. If we denote the set of Mc
tentative candidate values of the transmitted signal component si at each recursive step i = U, . . . , 1
as {˜sm}m=1,...,Mc ∈Mc, the set of potential candidates {˜sm}m=1,...,Mc should be tested in an
ascending order according to their corresponding values of φi(ˇsi) = φi(˜sm,ˇsi+1), as formulated in
Equation (9.57). As a consequence, we have
φi(˜s1,ˇsi+1) < · · · < φi(˜sm,ˇsi+1) < · · · < φi(˜sU,ˇsi+1),
(9.69)
where according to Equation (9.59) we have
φi(˜sm,ˇsi+1) = |ui,i(˜sm −ˇci) + ai|2.
(9.70)
Therefore, with the aid of this sorting criterion, the more likely candidates for ML solution are tested
earlier.
9.3.3.2.3
Local Termination Threshold
In contrast to the sorting technique employed in the conventional SD algorithms of Sections 9.3.1
and 9.3.2, the computational complexity of the OHRSA can only be further reduced if it is combined
with other surrogate techniques, since no radius reduction is used to conﬁne the search area. As an
example, a local Termination Threshold (TT) can be introduced to control the operation of the OHRSA,
e.g. to curtail operation based on the OF value computed at the current level search. Recall that the
global TT technique of Section 9.3.1.3 instructs the SD to curtail its search and output the most recently
found signal vector ˇs as the ML solution, when the Euclidean distance between the newly obtained
signal vector and the search centre ˆc is equal to or smaller than the preset termination threshold. The
TT technique used in the OHRSA is a local one, which is invoked to curtail the current recursive search
loop instead of discontinuing the search altogether. Therefore, the local TT employed in the OHRSA is
reminiscent of the search bound formulated in Equation (9.30) for the depth-ﬁrst SD algorithm, which
conﬁnes the decoupled search area for a speciﬁc signal component ˇsi.
The local TT of the OHRSA may be formulated as
Jmin = min{Jmin, J(ˇs)},
(9.71)
which is updated every time a new OF value J(ˇs) is obtained and hence the recursive search reaches
the decision for deciding upon signal component ˇs1. Therefore, with the aid of the sorting criterion of
Equation (9.69), the search loop is discontinued at the ith recursive search step aimed at deciding upon
the signal component ˇsi, whenever the search satisﬁes Ji(˜sm,ˇsi+1) > Jmin. And the search steps back
to the (i + 1)th detection step, where another tentative candidate ˜sm is chosen for ˇsi+1. By contrast, if
the most recently obtained Ji+1(˜sm,ˇsi+2) < Jmin, then the algorithm returns to the ith detection step.
In the worst-case scenario, when the detection loop returns to i = M and all the potential candidates
for ˇsM have been tested but the algorithm still fails to ﬁnd a new search path to reach J1(˜sm,ˇs2), the
detector outputs the currently available tentative signal vector ˇs, whose corresponding OF J(ˇs) has the
minimum value, as the ML solution.

9.3.3.2.4
Performance Evaluation
In Figure 9.17 both the BER performance achieved and the complexity imposed by the OHRSA detector
are portrayed in conjunction with different complexity-reduction parameter values γ. As argued in
Section 9.3.2.3, the appropriate SNR-dependent choice of the complexity-reduction parameter allows us
to avoid the computationally demanding and yet inefﬁcient detection of the speciﬁc signal components
which have their signal energy well below the noise ﬂoor [562]. Following on from our previous
discussion of the parameter δ employed by the K-best SD in Section 9.3.2.3, recall that δ has a similar
role to that of the parameter γ in the context of the OHRSA detector. Sufﬁce it to state here that the
introduction of the parameter γ reduces the complexity of the OHRSA at low SNRs as we can see
from the results of Figure 9.17, which is achieved at the cost of a slight BER performance degradation.
By comparing Figures 9.17 and 9.16 we found that the BER performance degradation suffered by the
OHRSA detector occurs in an SNR range which is different from that of the K-best SD detector of
Section 9.3.2.3. More speciﬁcally, the BER performance degradation of the OHRSA detector takes
place in the SNR range associated with the highest complexity reduction, i.e. in the low-SNR range.
By contrast, the performance degradation of the K-best SD becomes most pronounced in the moderate
SNR range.

16 and 8 · 2 = 16 bits per symbol. By choosing an appropriate K and δ value for the K-best SD
of Section 9.2.3, it was ensured in Figure 9.18 that it was capable of maintaining a near-ML BER
performance while exhibiting the lowest complexity of the three in both scenarios. When comparing our
identical throughput of 16 bits per symbol, the system which employs an antenna arrangement of (4×4)
elements and the 16-QAM scheme has a signiﬁcantly worse BER performance at a commensurately
reduced complexity.
9.4.2
Rank-Deﬁcient Systems
In this section, we compare the three types of SDs in terms of their BER performance and computational
complexity in the context of rank-deﬁcient 4-QAM SDMA/OFDM systems in conjunction with
different antenna arrangements. In Figure 9.19 the BER curves associated with the depth-ﬁrst SD,
the K-best SD and the OHRSA detectors are portrayed, demonstrating that all of them achieve a
near-ML performance in the different rank-deﬁcient scenarios considered. However, unlike the other
two detectors, the K-best SD does not guarantee an ML performance without an appropriate choice
of K. More speciﬁcally, setting K = 32, which ensures that the K-best SD does exhibit an ML
BER performance in an (8 × 5)-element system, does not necessarily guarantee an ML performance
if the rank-deﬁcient system becomes more asymmetrical in terms of having an excessive number of
transmitters. For example, for an antenna arrangement of (8×4) elements, we can see this phenomenon
in Figure 9.19. In other words, more computational efforts are required to approach the ML performance
as the difference between the number of transmit and receive antennas increases. This will become more
explicit by considering Figure 9.20.
To expound a little further, Figure 9.20 compares the complexity of these three detectors in
both (8 × 4)-element and (8 × 7)-element 4-QAM systems. We observe that all of these detectors
exhibit a signiﬁcantly lower complexity in the context of the latter system than in the former one,
since, in the latter, the number of receive antennas increases to approach that of the transmit antennas,
making the system less rank deﬁcient. In these 4-QAM scenarios, we found that the OHRSA detector
has the lowest computational complexity, while the depth-ﬁrst SD and the K-best SD typically exhibit a
similar complexity, although their speciﬁc relationship depends on the SNR encountered. An interesting
observation from Figure 9.20 is that, instead of decreasing, the complexity of the OHRSA detector
increases as the SNR increases in the high-SNR region, i.e. in the SNR range spanning from 12 to

25 dB. The reason behind this phenomenon can be explained as follows. In the heavily loaded system,
the interference between the different antenna elements becomes much more signiﬁcant, while in the
high-SNR region, the noise variance becomes low and hence a well-shaped decision lattice is created,
which suggests that the OHRSA requires a sufﬁciently high complexity budget in order to approach the
ML solution. Furthermore, owing to the speciﬁc search strategy of the OHRSA detector of Section 9.3.3,
an erroneous decision is more likely to be made at the higher level of the search tree. Therefore, instead
of decreasing, the complexity of the OHRSA detector increases as the SNR increases in the high-SNR
region.

Chapter Conclusions
In this chapter, one of the most promising low-complexity near-ML detectors, namely the SD, has
been investigated. Speciﬁcally, the derivation of the SD’s objective function from the conventional ML
metric was performed in Section 9.2.1, followed by a discourse on the SD’s tree search process in
Sections 9.2.2 and 9.2.3. In particular, depending on whether the tree search was carried out in both
the downward and upward directions of Figure 9.4 or solely in the downward direction of Figure 9.5,
SDs were classiﬁed into two categories, namely the families of depth-ﬁrst and breadth-ﬁrst SDs. The
search space of the former, which is a hypersphere, initially conﬁned by the ISR C of Figure 9.3, rapidly
shrinks upon regularly updating the search radius, as soon as the depth-ﬁrst tree search reaches a leaf
node. In contrast to the former, the breadth-ﬁrst SD or the so-called K-best SD conﬁned the search
space by introducing a parameter K which indicates the number of best candidates retained for each
search tree level, rather than employing a search radius C. Hence, it was found in Figures 9.6 and 9.9
of Section 9.2.5 that the complexity imposed by the depth-ﬁrst SD may vary depending on the received
SNR and on the choice of the ISR C, whereas the K-best SD may exhibit a constant complexity,
regardless of the received SNR. As for the achievable performance, both types of SDs are capable of
attaining the exact ML performance, provided that the ISR C of Figure 9.3 derived for the depth-ﬁrst SD

Figure 9.20: The complexity comparison of the depth-ﬁrst SD, K-best SD and the OHRSA detectors
in rank-deﬁcient systems. The complexity curve corresponding to the K-best SD in the scenario of
(8 × 4)-antenna arrangement is obtained by setting K = 32, whereas under the antenna arrangement
of (8 × 7) elements, we set K = 18, since K is expected to have a larger value as the rank-deﬁcient
system becomes more asymmetrical in terms of having an excessive number of transmitters, in order
to maintain a near-ML BER performance. All the remaining system parameters were summarized in
Table 9.1.
or the parameter K for the breadth-ﬁrst SD is chosen to be sufﬁciently high. Additionally, owing to the
SNR-independent computational complexity, the K-best SD is more suitable for real-time applications
and it may be readily implemented in a pipelined fashion.
In the scenario of rank-deﬁcient MIMO systems, where the number of transmit antennas M is
higher than that of receive antennas N, the Grammian matrix G of Equation (9.22) has (M −N)
diagonal elements of zero. Hence, Cholesky factorization of G cannot be directly applied, so the
conventional SD has to be modiﬁed in order to apply it in rank-deﬁcient situations, which results
in the so-called GSD of Section 9.2.4. Two SD methods have been introduced in Section 9.2.4 to
handle the challenging rank-deﬁcient scenarios. Essentially, the ﬁrst scheme of Section 9.2.4.1 may
be regarded as a combination of the standard SD for the ﬁrst N transmitted symbols and ML detection
for the remaining (M −N) symbols, since only the diagonal elements of the last (M −N) rows of
the Grammian matrix G are zero. The other technique of Section 9.2.4.2, dealing with the problem of
having (M −N) zero diagonal elements in the matrix G, is to generate a modiﬁed Grammian matrix ˜G
which becomes G + αI, where a judicious choice of the parameter α is required in order to achieve a
sufﬁciently low computational complexity. As detailed in Section 9.2.4.2, the parameter α is chosen to
be the noise variance 2σ2
w. Thus, the GSD commences its search for the ML solution within a search
space centred around the MMSE solution, rather than the LS solution of the conventional SD.
The OHRSA detector, which was developed as an extension of the GSD detector of Section 9.2.4,
was introduced in Section 9.3.3. It was studied in comparison with the most inﬂuential complexity
reduction schemes invoked for the SDs, which were detailed in Sections 9.3.1 and 9.3.2. More
speciﬁcally, the OHRSA invokes exactly the same pre-processing operations as the GSD, which were
shown to be capable of dealing with rank-deﬁcient scenarios in Section 9.2.4.2, where the number of

9.5. Chapter Conclusions

transmit antennas is higher than that of receive antennas. Furthermore, a comprehensive discussion on
the search techniques used by the OHRSA algorithm was provided in Section 9.3.3 in comparison with
the classic SDs. Essentially, both the OHRSA and the SD rely on a hierarchical search structure, and
they both rely on identical ML metric equations. On the other hand, although the search strategy of the
OHRSA is quite different from that of the conventional SD, their basic philosophy may be deemed as
being reminiscent of each other.
Simulation results were provided in Section 9.4 to investigate the achievable performance versus the
complexity imposed by the OHRSA detector in comparison with those of several reduced-complexity
SDs. It was shown in Figure 9.19 that all these low-complexity near-ML detectors are capable of
approaching the ML performance. As for the complexity, the OHRSA detector does not always exhibit
a lower complexity than its classic counterparts. For example, it was observed in Figure 9.20 that in
a rank-deﬁcient system using 4-QAM the OHRSA detector may indeed impose a signiﬁcantly lower
complexity compared with the conventional SDs. However, it was demonstrated in Figure 9.18 that
when 16-QAM or even higher throughput modulation schemes are employed, or when the number of
transmit antennas is not higher than that of e receive antennas, the complexity of the OHRSA detector
may in fact becomes higher than that of its conventional SD counterparts. On the other hand, recall
from Figure 9.18 that the K-best SD, which is assisted by the complexity-reduction techniques of
Section 9.3.2, exhibits a modest complexity in comparison with the depth-ﬁrst SD.

Introduction1
The radio spectrum is a scarce resource. Therefore, one of the most important objectives in the
design of future communications systems is the efﬁcient exploitation of the available spectrum, in
order to accommodate the ever-increasing trafﬁc demands. Any effort to achieve bandwidth-efﬁcient
transmissions over hostile wireless channels typically requires advanced channel coding. Powerful
turbo codes were introduced by Berrou in [565,566] in the context of iteratively decoding two parallel
concatenated convolutional codes. His work was later extended to serially concatenated codes [567]
and then found its way gradually into iterative detector designs, such as for example iterative multi-
user detectors [568]. Despite their modest complexity, iterative detection and decoding mechanisms are
capable of approaching the capacity limits for transmission over wireless MIMO channels.

Iterative Detection and Decoding Fundamentals
10.1.1.1
System Model
Before introducing the channel coding blocks in our MIMO system model, let us brieﬂy review the
mathematical model of an SDMA system supporting U users and having N receive antennas at the BS,
which is formulated as
y = Hs + n,
(10.1)
where y, H, s and n are the (N × 1)-element received signal column vector, the (N × U)-element
FD-CTF matrix, the (U × 1)-element transmitted signal column vector, and the (N × 1)-element
AWGN column vector, respectively. Each element sm of the transmitted signal vector s can be further
represented as su = map⟨xu⟩, u = 1, 2, . . . , U, where x⟨u⟩is a (log2 Mc × 1) block of raw

bits. In other words, each element of the transmitted signal vector s, i.e. a constellation symbol,
contains log2 Mc information bits.
When no channel encoder is employed at the transmitter, the estimates of the transmitted signal s
can be obtained by the low-complexity near-ML detectors of Chapter 9. Note that all the low-complexity
near-ML SDs we encountered in Chapter 9 are HIHO (Hard-In, Hard-Out) detectors.
Owing to the employment of channel coding, the SNR required to achieve a desirable BER may be
further reduced. Hence in Figure 10.1 a MIMO system employing a channel encoder and an iterative
receiver is portrayed. The interleaver and deinterleaver pair seen at the receiver side of Figure 10.1
divides the receiver into two parts, namely the inner MAP detector and the outer decoder. Note that in
Figure 10.1, the subscript ‘1’ denotes variables associated with the inner detector, while the subscript
‘2’ represents variables associated with the outer channel decoder. It was detailed throughout [314]
and [569] that the iterative exchange of extrinsic information between these serially concatenated
receiver blocks results in substantial performance improvements. In this treatise we assume familiarity
with the classic turbo detection principles [314]. Naturally, the inner MIMO detector has to be capable
of processing the soft-bit information provided by the soft-output channel decoder. On the other hand,
the outer channel decoder also has to be capable of processing the soft reliability information provided
by the soft-output inner MIMO detector. The resultant soft-bit information is iteratively exchanged
between the inner MIMO detector and the outer channel decoder.
10.1.1.2
MAP Bit Detection
In contrast to the conventional HIHO detector, which outputs hard-symbol decisions, and hence results
in hard-bit decisions also at the output of the demodulator, the inner MIMO detector of Figure 10.1
has to be capable of providing soft-bit reliability information for further processing by the outer
channel decoder. The advantage of providing soft-bit information is that the channel decoder beneﬁts
from exploiting the reliability information provided by the detector and returns to the detector its

improved-conﬁdence soft information in the interest of iteratively improving the resultant A Posteriori
Probability (APP). Hence, the probability of bit errors is minimized. This SISO scheme may be
referred to as an MAP detector. Conventionally, the APP is quantiﬁed in terms of the Log-Likelihood
Ratio (LLR) as [314]
LD(xk|y) = ln P[xk = +1|y]
P[xk = −1|y],
(10.2)
where y is the received symbol vector and xk, k = 0, 1, . . . , U · log2 Mc −1, is the kth element of the
corresponding transmitted bit vector x. Since the bits in the vector x have been channel encoded and
scrambled by the interleaver, we may assume that they are statistically independent of each other. With
the aid of Bayes’ theorem, the LLRs of Equation (10.2) can be rewritten as [553,570]
LD(xk|y) = ln p(y|xk = +1)P[xk = +1]/p(y)
p(y|xk = −1)P[xk = −1]/p(y)

Xk,+1 = {x|xk = +1},
Xk,−1 = {x|xk = −1}.

Note here that the value of xk = −1 represents a logical value of 0, while xk = 1 represents a logical

where the subscript [k] denotes the exclusion of the kth element of a vector. Hence, x[k] represents a
speciﬁc subvector of the bit vector x obtained by omitting the kth component and retaining the rest
of them. Similarly, LA,[k] represents the speciﬁc subvector of the a priori LLR vector LA obtained by
excluding the kth element, where LA is the vector containing the a priori LLR value of all the bits in x.
Observe from Equation (10.9) that the a posteriori LLR is equal to the sum of the a priori LLR
and the so-called extrinsic LLR, which is the second component in the equation. Note that, although
the above derivation of the soft reliability information is valid for the bit vector x1 which is associated
with the inner MIMO detector, the subscript ‘1’ is omitted, since Equation (10.9) also holds for the bit
vector x2 associated with the outer channel code. Assuming that an AWGN channel is encountered,

(10.10)
where the denominator is a constant when the noise variance 2σ2

the Jacobian logarithm [314] may be employed to approximate the extrinsic LLRs as follows:

= max(a1, a2) + ln(1 + e−|a1−a2|),

where the second term may be omitted in order to approximate further the original log value,
since ln(1 + e−|a1−a2|) can be regarded as a reﬁnement of the coarse approximation provided by
the maximum. Consequently, when using the above-mentioned Jacobian approximation, the extrinsic
LLR, i.e. the second term of Equation (10.9), can be rewritten as

which represents the information exchanged between the inner MIMO detector and the outer channel

10.1.2
Chapter Contributions and Outline
Even with the aid of the Jacobian approximation of Equation (10.12), the calculation of the extrinsic
LLR value using Equation (10.13) may still impose an excessive computational complexity, depending
on the number of users U and on the constellation size Mc of the modulation scheme employed, since
a brute-force full search has to be carried out by the MAP detector in order to ﬁnd the joint maximum
of the two terms of Equation (10.13). From our discourse on the SD scheme provided in Section 9.2 as
well as in light of the corresponding complexity reduction techniques of Section 9.3, we may argue that
the HIHO SD constitutes a computationally efﬁcient solution to the ML detection problem in uncoded
MIMO systems. For the sake of approaching the channel capacity at a low complexity, the SISO SD
algorithm was contrived by Hochwald and ten Brink in [553], where a list of the best hypothesized
transmitted MIMO symbol candidates was generated, which was representative of the entire lattice
in computing the soft-bit information, resulting in the concept of the List Sphere Decoder (LSD) of
Section 10.2.1. However, in order to achieve a good performance, when the LSD is employed in an
iterative detection-aided channel-coded system, the list size has to remain sufﬁciently large, resulting
in a potentially excessive complexity. Hence, to reduce further the complexity imposed by the LSD
of Section 10.2.1, we propose various solutions to the problem of how to maintain a near-MAP
performance with the aid of a small candidate list size. More speciﬁcally, the novel contributions of
this chapter are as follows:
• Our discovery is that in contrast to the conventional SD, it is plausible to set the search centre of
the SD to a point which is typically closer to the real ML solution than the conventional LS or
MMSE solution. Commencing the search from a more accurate search centre may be considered
as a process of search-complexity reduction.
• A generic centre-shifting SD scheme is proposed for channel-coded iterative receivers based
on the above-mentioned perception, which substantially reduces the detection complexity by
decomposing it into two stages, namely the iterative search-centre-update phase and the reduced-
complexity search around it. Three search-centre-update algorithms are devised in order to shift

10.2. Channel-Coded Iterative Centre-Shifting SD
311
the search centre iteratively to a point closer to the true ML point with the aid of the soft-bit
information delivered by the outer channel decoder.
• We propose a novel complexity-reduction scheme, referred to as the A priori LLR Threshold
(ALT) technique, for the LSD, which is also based on exploitation of the soft-bit information,
i.e. the a priori LLRs provided by the outer channel decoder in the context of iterative detection-
aided channel-coded systems.
• We signiﬁcantly improve the performance of the conventional two-stage SD-aided turbo receiver
by intrinsically amalgamating our proposed centre-shifting-assisted SD with the decoder of
a Unity-Rate Code (URC) having an Inﬁnite Impulse Response (IIR), both of which are
embedded in a channel-coded SDMA-OFDM transceiver, thus creating a powerful three-stage
serially concatenated scheme. Moreover, to achieve a near-capacity performance, Irregular
Convolutional Codes (IrCCs) are used as the outer code for the proposed iterative centre-shifting
SD-aided three-stage system.
• The convergence characteristics of the proposed schemes are visualized and analysed with the
aid of EXIT charts. Furthermore, performance versus complexity comparisons are carried out
among the above-mentioned novel schemes.
The remainder of this chapter is organized as follows. The fundamentals of the conventional LSD
are brieﬂy reviewed in Section 10.2.1, followed by a discussion on the centre-shifting theory in the
context of the SD in Section 10.2.2, which partitions the SD into two parts, i.e. the search-centre-
update phase and the search around it. Then, three search-centre-update algorithms are contrived in
Section 10.2.3 in order to update the search centre iteratively to a point which is expected to be
increasingly closer to the true ML MIMO symbol point. This search-centre update is achieved by
exploiting the soft-bit information delivered to the outer channel decoder in the iterative receiver. The
ALT-based SD scheme is devised in Section 10.3 in the interest of achieving a complexity reduction,
which also relies on exploitation of the soft-bit information gleaned from the outer channel decoder, but
in a different manner in comparison with the centre-shifting SD scheme of Section 10.2. In Section 10.4
we demonstrate that the iterative decoding convergence of the conventional two-stage system may
be improved by constructing a three-stage system with the aid of the URC encoder/decoder pair of
Figure 10.33. Furthermore, IrCCs are employed as the outer code for the proposed iterative centre-
shifting SD-aided three-stage system to achieve a near-capacity performance. Finally, we summarize
the ﬁndings of this chapter and provide our concluding remarks in Section 10.5.

10.2.1
Generation of the Candidate List
10.2.1.1
List Generation and Extrinsic LLR Calculation
The inner MIMO detector in Figure 10.1 was chosen to be one of the SDs detailed in Chapter 9, in order
to approach the MAP performance while avoiding a potentially excessive computational complexity,
which is likely to be encountered by the employment of the conventional MAP detector. However,
when calculating the soft information generated by the HIHO SD of Section 9.2, ﬁnding the ML
solution of ˆsML = arg minˇs∈MU
c ∥y −Hs∥2 does not necessarily solve the problem of maximizing
the two terms in Equation (10.13), because here the search for sML = arg minˇs∈MU
c ∥y −Hs∥2 in
each term is carried out in the bit domain having xk = 1 or xk = −1, rather than in the original
MIMO symbol domain in the scenario of HIHO SD. Therefore, conventional SDs cannot be directly
employed in the iterative detection scheme shown in Figure 10.1, because the ML solution sML provides
us with a single hard-decision-based MIMO symbol value, rather than the required bit-based soft
information. Fortunately, based on the idea that although the MIMO bit vector for maximizing the
two terms in Equation (10.13) is not necessarily the ML MIMO symbol solution sML, the bit vector is

312
Chapter 10. Reduced-Complexity Iterative Sphere Detection
typically located near the ML MIMO symbol solution sML. Hence, ﬁnding the MIMO bit vector which
maximizes the two terms of Equation (10.13) does not require a full search of the entire lattice. Similar
to the conventional SD, the search can be carried out in a signiﬁcantly smaller hypersphere containing
the ML solution sML, but instead of simply ﬁnding the ML solution, the SD has to output a list L
which contains the ML solution as well as its neighbours, which might constitute the MIMO bit vector
maximizing the two terms of Equation (10.13) with a high probability. Finally, by doing the subtraction
between the two obtained values of the OFs corresponding to the two terms of Equation (10.13), we can
get the extrinsic LLR required.
Based on the above discussions, simple modiﬁcations of the conventional depth-ﬁrst SD of
Section 9.2.2 may be carried out by appropriately modifying: (1) the search radius update strategy;
and (2) the output stack for storing the aforementioned list L. As for the search radius, it has to be
constant all the time during the search regardless of whether a new signal point was found. However,
this does not mean that there is no need to calculate the Euclidean distance between the newly obtained
signal point and the received signal point, because their distance is used as the metric controlling the
update of the output stack. Again, the output stack was introduced for storing the aforementioned list L.
Let us assume that the size of L is preset to be Ncand. When a new signal point is found inside the
sphere, two possible actions may be taken: (1) the newly obtained signal point is added directly to
the output stack L, provided that it is not full; (2) if the stack is already full, the new signal point is
compared with the element having the largest distance from the received signal point, and replaces
it if the new signal point has a smaller distance. Consequently, the resultant list L contains the ML
solution as well as (Ncand −1) candidates which are close to the former. According to [571], during
generation of the candidate list L, the search radius can only be reduced to the value of the maximum
distance metric found in the list L, if the output stack is full. Based on this intuition, if there are more
signal vectors having xk = 1, the resultant soft reliability information indicates with a high probability
that the kth bit is a logical one. On the other hand, if there are more signal vectors having xk = −1,
a reasonable decision can be made implying that the kth bit is a logical zero. Hence, we can ﬁnally
rewrite Equation (10.13) for the LSD as
Le(xk|y) ≈1

(10.14)
The above approximation becomes an equality when the output stack L contains the entire lattice,
i.e. Ncand = M U
c . However, as mentioned earlier, the maximizer of both terms of Equation (10.14) is
located near the ML solution, hence the size of the list L required to achieve a desired performance is
typically far smaller than M U
c .
As for the application of the K-best SD of Section 9.2.3 in our channel-coded system, the list
generation is more straightforward than for its depth-ﬁrst counterpart discussed previously in this
section. Speciﬁcally, instead of generating a single signal vector after the breadth-ﬁrst tree search, which
is expected to be the near-ML solution, the K-best SD retains Ncand best tree leaf candidates having the
lowest accumulated Euclidean distances from the received signal point y. Eventually, after backtracking
from these tree leaves, Ncand signal vectors can be generated, constituting the list L.
10.2.1.2
Computational Complexity of LSDs
Let us now quantify the computational complexity of both the soft-output LSD and the exact
MAP detectors in terms of the number of OF evaluations, which corresponds to the two terms in
Equation (10.14). As mentioned previously, the approximation in Equation (10.14) becomes an equality
when L represents the entire search space, constituted by Ncand = M U
c
= 2U·BPS OF evaluations,
where U represents the number of users in SDMA systems, Mc is the size of the speciﬁc constellation
and BPS is the number of bits per symbol. Therefore, the complexity of the exact MAP detector can

10.2.1. Generation of the Candidate List
313
be calculated as the total number of OF evaluations given by
CMAP = U · BPS · 2(U·BPS).
(10.15)
Clearly, the complexity grows exponentially with the product of the number of users U and the
number of bits per symbol BPS. Let us consider an eight-user 4-QAM SDMA system as an example.
It corresponds to a complexity of CMAP
= 1 048 576 OF evaluations, which is excessive. If a
16-QAM scheme is employed, the complexity is increased to 1.3744 × 1011 OF evaluations, which
is implementationally infeasible.
As for the computational complexity imposed by the LSD of Section 10.2.1.1, it may be
signiﬁcantly reduced by generating a list of candidates having a length of Ncand, where 2U·BPS ≥
Ncand ≥1, since the corresponding complexity can be expressed as
CMAP = U · BPS · Ncand.
(10.16)
Consequently, the complexity has become linearly proportional to the length of the list L. In the
following sections, we can observe that the value of Ncand can be set to a small fraction of 2U·BPS,
especially when a high-throughput modulation scheme, e.g. 64-QAM, is employed and/or a high
number of users are supported by the system.
10.2.1.3
Simulation Results and 2D EXIT-Chart Analysis
Our forthcoming EXIT-chart analysis and Monte Carlo simulations, if not stated otherwise, will be
carried out in the scenario of (8× 4)-element rank-deﬁcient 4-QAM SDMA-OFDM systems, under the
simplifying assumptions that perfect channel estimation is available at the BS and that the channel
is time invariant. Note that the power delay proﬁle of the three-path frequency-selective channel
considered is given by P(τ) = 2
k=0 P(τk)δ(t −kτ), where τ is the delay spread and P(τk) =
[0.5 0.3 0.2] for k = 0, 1, 2. We employ a constraint-length Kc = 3, half-rate Recursive Systematic
Convolutional (RSC) code RSC(2,1,3) having the octally represented generator polynomials of (6/13).
The length of the interleaver between the channel encoder and the modulator/mapper is 10 240 bits. It
is reasonable to set the length of the list to be the same as the parameter K of the K-best SD, which
represents the maximum number of candidates to be retained at each search tree level. Our system
parameters are summarized in Table 10.1.
Figure 10.2 depicts the EXIT functions of both the K-best LSD and the outer convolutional
decoder. Observe in Figure 10.2 that the EXIT curve corresponding to the SD, which we refer to
as the inner decoder, intersects that of the outer decoder before reaching the convergence point
of [IA(MUD) = 1, IE(MUD) = 1]. Therefore, regardless of the number of iterations invoked and the
length of the interleaver, residual errors may persist at this speciﬁc SNR = 8 dB. More importantly, as
seen in Figure 10.2, the shape of the EXIT curve of the inner decoder depends signiﬁcantly on the size
of the list Ncand employed, which is equal to K in all forthcoming simulations. Speciﬁcally, having
a longer list leads to a steeper and hence more beneﬁcial slope of the EXIT curve. In other words,
the EXIT curves of the inner decoder and the outer decoder will intersect at a higher [IA, IE] value,
when the list is extended. The phenomenon where the inner decoder’s EXIT curve may even decay
as the a priori information fed back by the outer decoder increases can be explained by the fact that
the inner and outer decoders exchange ﬂawed information owing to a shortage of candidate solutions,
more particularly the absence of the ML solution in the candidate list, which is not long enough.
Consequently, the maximum achievable iteration gain may be signiﬁcantly reduced when employing
a very small list, although, as expected, the overall computational complexity imposed by the soft-bit-
information calculation is substantially reduced. Furthermore, we can infer from Figure 10.2 that the
BER performances corresponding to different list sizes do not dramatically differ from each other at
low SNRs, when the open tunnel between the EXIT curves of the inner and outer decoders closes at low
[IA, IE] values. This is because all inner EXIT curves corresponding to different list sizes have similar

Figure 10.3: The achievable BER performance of the conventional K-best SD-aided iterative detection
in the scenario of an (8 × 4)-antenna 4-QAM SDMA-OFDM system with different K. In all cases, the
maximum iteration gain has been achieved.
Figure 10.3 compares the achievable BER performances of the K-best LSD-aided iterative detector
having different list sizes in the scenario of the (8 × 4) rank-deﬁcient SDMA-OFDM system. It can be
seen that, compared with the uncoded system, a signiﬁcant performance gain is achieved by employing
the channel encoder/decoder. Moreover, the attainable performance can be further improved by invoking
the iterative detection scheme of Figure 10.1 which exchanges soft information between the inner
decoder, i.e. the soft-output K-best SD and the convolutional decoder. The difference between the
attainable iteration gains exhibited by the inner decoder using different list sizes remains insigniﬁcant
until the SNR increases to about 5 dB, which is also the convergence threshold of the inner decoder
having the list length of K = 128. The convergence threshold associated with the list length of K = 32,
on the other hand, is about 7 dB. In other words, useful iteration gain can only be observed for relatively
high SNRs, provided that a sufﬁciently high list length is employed. Hence, the BER performance
suffers from having an insufﬁciently long list size. On the other hand, the computational complexity
imposed and the memory required by the LSD may be substantially reduced with the aid of iterative
detection, as quantiﬁed in Table 10.2.
More explicitly, Table 10.2 shows the trade-off between the SNR required and the computational
complexity imposed by the K-best LSD/MAP detector at the target BER of 10−5. Note that we quantify
the computational complexity of the list generation in the K-best LSD in terms of the total number of
PED evaluations according to Equation (9.32) in Section 9.2.2, whereas we calculate the complexity of
the soft-information generation at the output of the K-best LSD/MAP detector using Equation (10.16)
in terms of the total number of OF evaluations corresponding to the two terms of Equation (10.14).
Therefore, we can observe from both Figure 10.3 and Table 10.2 that in order to achieve a near-
MAP BER performance, we have to set both K and the list size Ncand to at least 1024. In other
words, for a given target BER of 10−5, to achieve a performance gain of 3 dB over the system where
both K and Ncand are set to 32 in the scenario of an (8 × 4)-element overloaded 4-QAM SDMA-
OFDM system, substantial computational and memory investments have to be made, which require

computed using Equation (10.16) in terms of the total number of OF evaluations corresponding to the
two terms in Equation (10.14).

nearly 19 times more PED evaluations per channel use for the candidate list generation, 32 times more
OF evaluations per channel use for the LLR calculation and 32 times more memory requirements per
channel use. Although the computational complexity imposed is only a small fraction of that required
by the EXACT MAP detector (which requires, for example, more than 106 OF evaluations for the LLR
calculation in this particular scenario), it is still substantially higher than desirable, especially in heavily
rank-deﬁcient systems.
10.2.2
Centre-Shifting Theory for SDs
Recall from Section 9.2 that the philosophy of various types of SD is that of ﬁnding the ML solution
which minimizes the ML error term of Equation (9.16), which is then transformed into the problem of
ﬁnding the speciﬁc MIMO symbol which minimizes the ﬁrst term of Equation (9.18) or the ﬁrst term
of Equation (9.38). More explicitly, according to Equation (9.20) we have
ˆsML = arg min
ˇs∈MU
c
(ˇs −ˆc)HHHH(ˇs −ˆc),
(10.17)
where ˆc = (HHH)−1HHy is the unconstrained ML estimate of s, i.e. the LS solution. In addition,
according to Equation (9.41) we get
ˆsML = arg min
ˇs∈MU
c
(ˇs −ˆc)H(HHH + 2σ2
wI)(ˇs −ˆc),
(10.18)
where 2σ2
w represents the noise variance and hence ˆc = (HHH + 2σ2
wI)HHy corresponds to the
MMSE solution.
Therefore, when using SD, the ML solution can be found by creating a reduced-size search
hypersphere centred around the LS solution or the MMSE solution and then reducing the search radius
when possible. During our investigations of SD, we suggested the plausible idea of setting the search
centre to a MIMO signal constellation point, which is typically closer to the real ML solution than
the conventional LS or MMSE solution. To some extent, extending the search from a more accurate
search centre can be considered as a process of search-complexity reduction. In fact, the computational
complexity reduction achieved by the MMSE-based centre over the LS-aided one was quantiﬁed in
Figure 9.15 in Section 9.3.2. Hence, it is plausible that the closer the search centre to the real ML
solution, the lower the computational complexity, as has been veriﬁed by all of our simulations in the
context of the SD-aided uncoded SDMA-OFDM systems considered.
Consequently, the SD can be split into two independent functional blocks, namely the centre
calculation or centre update block and the SD’s hypersphere search block, as shown in Figure 10.4.

Hence, the search can be carried out independently of the search-centre calculation. Thus, the search
centre can be obtained by arbitrary detection schemes, not just by the conventional LS or MMSE
detection scheme. This observation turns the SD into a high-ﬂexibility detector, which can be readily
combined with other well-established linear or nonlinear detectors. As a result, the total computational
complexity imposed by the SD consists of that of the detector which provides the search centre for
consecutive search operation of Figure 10.4. In other words, the affordable computational complexity
can be ﬂexibly split between the centre calculation phase and the search phase of Figure 10.4. The
simple schematic of Figure 10.4 is further detailed in Figure 10.5, where the triangularization of the
channel matrix H and the PED calculation previously detailed in Section 9.2 are portrayed more
explicitly. It is also plausible that an improved performance versus complexity trade-off emerges as
the search-centre calculation is regularly updated, before further triangularization and PED calculation
are carried out as seen in Figure 10.5.

Figure 10.5: The structure of the iterative K-best SD using the centre-shifting scheme. The search
centre of the SD can be set to a more accurate centre than the original LS or MMSE solution to reduce
the computational complexity required by each iteration, while maintaining the performance. A beneﬁt
of this is that the memory requirements can be largely reduced, although the overall computational
complexity remains almost the same as proved by our simulations.
10.2.3
Centre-Shifting K-Best SD-Aided Iterative Receiver
Architectures
The novel idea of centre shifting, which was proposed in the context of an uncoded system in
Section 10.2.2, has the beneﬁt of less memory requirements imposed by the K-best SD, since K can be
set to a small value. However, the overall computational complexity reduction may still remain modest
if the iterative scheme shown in Figure 10.5 is employed, since a fraction of the original computational
complexity imposed by the search process is in fact transferred to the centre calculation phase. Hence,
the overall computational complexity may remain similar to that of the non-iterative SD.
In order to provide further insights, the performance versus complexity characterization of the K-
best SD is provided in Tables 10.3 and 10.4 for both a full-rank and a rank-deﬁcient system, respectively.
On the other hand, the centre-shifting scheme applied for the K-best SD is expected to become
signiﬁcantly more powerful, if it is employed in the scenario of the iterative detection-aided channel-
coded system of Figure 10.6, since the process of obtaining a more accurate search centre is further
aided by the channel decoder, which substantially contributes towards the total error-correction
capability of the iterative receiver. Beneﬁcially, no additional computational complexity is imposed
by calculating the search centre based on the output of the channel decoder. Note that although the SD
process is repeated according to the number of iterations, the overall computational complexity imposed
by the iterative receiver may be substantially reduced while maintaining a high BER performance,
since K and Ncand can be set to substantially lower values when combined with the centre-shifting
scheme than that required without it.
In our forthcoming discourse on the centre-shifting K-best SD-aided iterative receiver, ﬁrst of all
we propose three different receiver architectures employing different centre-calculation schemes. Then
we will opt for using the best of the three centre-calculation schemes in a Unity-Rate Code (URC)

assisted three-stage iterative receiver in Section 10.4. More explicitly, the schematic of Figure 10.1 is
extended in Figure 10.33 of Section 10.4 with a URC decoder. Accordingly, the receiver incorporates
the URC’s decoder, as seen in Figure 10.33. During our EXIT-chart-assisted receiver design, our aim
is to construct a low-complexity near-MAP detector which is capable of supporting high-throughput
modulation schemes operating in heavily rank-deﬁcient systems.
10.2.3.1
Direct Hard-Decision Centre-Update-Based Two-Stage Iterative Architecture
10.2.3.1.1
Receiver Architecture and EXIT-Chart-Aided Analysis
Our ﬁrst proposed centre-calculation scheme is the Direct Hard-Decision Centre-Shifting (DHDC)
scheme portrayed in Figure 10.7, which calculates the search centre for the forthcoming detection
iteration by imposing hard decisions on the interleaved a posteriori LLRs at the output of the channel
decoder. Then it remodulates the resultant bit streams of all the SDMA users, in order to generate the
mapped symbol matrix, where each column corresponds to the most recently obtained search centre.
The main purpose of invoking the centre-shifting scheme for the K-best SD in the context of the
iterative detection-aided system of Figure 10.1 is to increase the maximum attainable iterative gain
while maintaining an affordable complexity. The list size Ncand is equal to the number of tentative
MIMO symbol candidates retained at each tree search level, which is set to the lowest possible value
in order to reduce the computational complexity imposed. Naturally, additional computational efforts
are imposed by the SD based on the updated search centre since after a certain number of iterations
the candidate list used for the LLR calculation is regenerated. But again, as a whole, the total memory
requirements of the K-best SD and the overall computational complexity imposed by the list generation
and the LLR calculation of the K-best SD is expected to be substantially reduced with the aid of the
iterative information exchange between the centre-shifting scheme and the channel decoder. In order
to investigate the beneﬁts of invoking the centre-shifting scheme, EXIT charts are used to analyse
the modiﬁed SD block, which has two inputs and one output, as shown in Figure 10.8. The centre-
calculation phase portrayed in Figure 10.4 is transplanted into the SD block of Figure 10.8. The two
inputs seen in Figure 10.8 are the a priori LLRs and the interleaved a posteriori LLRs provided by
the channel decoder, whereas the output is the resultant extrinsic LLR. As a consequence, we have to
employ the 3D EXIT chart ﬁrst and then project it to two dimensions, in order to obtain the 2D EXIT
chart of the iterative receiver, as will be detailed in the context of Figure 10.9.
More explicitly, Figure 10.9 depicts the 3D EXIT chart of the DHDC-aided K-best SD iterative
receiver, where K = 256 is used in our (4 × 4)-element 4-QAM SDMA-OFDM system. Since the
total number of MIMO symbols is 44 = 256, the SD is actually the exact MAP detector, which
computes the LLRs by conducting the totally M · BPS · Ncand = 4 · 2 · 256 = 2048 OF evaluations,
which correspond to the evaluations of the two terms in Equation (10.14). We evaluate the extrinsic
Mutual Information (MI), IE, at the output of the SD, which is quantiﬁed on the vertical axis of
Figure 10.9(a), after providing the SD with the two inputs required, which correspond to the a priori
LLRs and the a posteriori LLRs gleaned from the channel decoder, respectively. The MI associated
with the two inputs, namely IA and ID, is quantiﬁed on the two abscissas, namely on the x-axis and

for different SNRs in Figure 10.9(a), indicate that the extrinsic output IE is actually independent of the
input ID, implying that the DHDC scheme is unable to glean any beneﬁts for the exact MAP detector.
This is not unexpected, since the inner EXIT curve seen in Figure 10.9(b), which was obtained by
projecting on the 3D EXIT chart of Figure 10.9(a) to the 2D EXIT chart on the plane given by the
two axes, which quantify the extrinsic MI and the a priori MI at the output and input of the MUD, i.e.
the SD, respectively, does not encounter the problem of going down as the input MI IA increases as
shown in Figure 10.2 of Section 10.2.1.3. Thus, it depends only on the SNR of the received signal and
the a priori LLRs. Therefore, we can infer that when the list size is sufﬁciently high, the EXIT curve

of the inner decoder is proportional to the input a priori LLRs, whereas the DHDC scheme provides
hardly any performance improvement, since it fails to provide an iterative gain.
However, if we reduce the list size Ncand of the SD to a relatively small value, the output extrinsic
LLRs are no longer independent of the input ID LLRs, based on which the iterative detection-aided
DHDC scheme of Figure 10.7 updates the search centre of the K-best SD as seen in Figure 10.10,
where the inner and outer EXIT surfaces are depicted for K = Ncand = 32 and K = Ncand = 128,
respectively. More speciﬁcally, we can observe from Figure 10.10 that for a given input a priori MI
IA, the output extrinsic MI IE is proportional to the input a posteriori MI ID. On the other hand,
the relationship between the output IE and the input IA represented by the corresponding LLR in
Figure 10.8 is quite different when the other input ID is ﬁxed. More explicitly, when ID is not high
enough, because the search centre is insufﬁciently accurate, the output IE seen in Figure 10.10 may
not be proportional to the input IA. However, when the ID is sufﬁcient high, since the SD carries
out detection using an accurate centre, which is close to the ML solution, the output IE is expected
to increase proportionally as the input IA approaches unity, even for a small value of Ncand. In fact,
the observations based on Figure 10.10 coincide with the simulation results shown in Figure 10.2,
where the EXIT curve of the K-best SD starts to decrease, despite having an increasing value of IA
when K and Ncand are insufﬁciently high. In this scenario, having small K and Ncand values may
yield a candidate list which may not contain the ML solution with a high probability, which in turn
leads to ﬂawed information being exchanged between the inner decoder and the outer decoder during
iterative detection. Consequently, instead of increasing the iterative gain, using more iterations results
in a reduced output IE value for the K-best SD. However, as a beneﬁt of the centre-shifting scheme, we
can improve the resultant candidate list without increasing K and Ncand, by simply updating the search
centre to a more accurate one. Hence, the quality of the output soft-bit information, i.e. LE, is improved
without increasing the list size Ncand or K. Finally, based on the above discussions, we summarize the
aforementioned relationships in Figure 10.11.
Note that the two inputs of the K-best SD shown in Figure 10.8, namely the a priori LLRs and the
a posteriori LLRs, are not perfectly independent. By contrast, the 3D EXIT chart of Figure 10.10 was
obtained by providing the K-best SD with two perfectly independent Gaussian-distributed LLRs. Hence
it is anticipated that the actual decoding trajectory will deviate from the EXIT-chart-based performance
predictions. As a result, the iterative detector may not be able to achieve an inﬁnitesimally low BER at

Simulation Results
Let us now characterize the achievable performance of the DHDC-aided K-best SD iterative receiver
in the scenario of an (8×4)-element rank-deﬁcient 4-QAM SDMA-OFDM system. Since the values of
K and Ncand were set relatively low, we know from the EXIT chart of Figure 10.2 and the BER curve

Once no more iterative gain can
be achieved by the conventional iterative
receiver, the centre-shifting function is switched on
of Figure 10.3 that the conventional K-best SD iterative receiver dispensing with centre shifting suffers
from a performance degradation compared with the more complex system using K = Ncand = 1024.
Therefore, it is beneﬁcial to switch off the DHDC scheme of Section 10.2.3.1 during the ﬁrst few
iterations. However, when the maximum attainable iterative gain is achieved with the DHDC scheme
being switched off, the DHDC scheme is activated again in order to update the search centre of the
K-best SD. This centre-update action may be expected to create a wider EXIT tunnel between the
EXIT curves of the inner and outer decoder, potentially facilitating an easier passage of the decoding
trajectory through the tunnel. Our system parameters are summarized in Table 10.5.
Figure 10.12 reveals the BER performance improvement brought about by the DHDC-aided K-best
SD iterative receiver over that of the conventional SD iterative receiver using no centre shifting in the
scenario of an (8 × 4)-element rank-deﬁcient SDMA-OFDM system. The BER curves of the iterative
receiver correspond to a variable number of iterations, which were enabled to iterate until perceivable
iterative gains were achieved. Speciﬁcally, within the SNR range of 6–13 dB, where useful performance
improvements can be observed, a maximum performance gain of 2 dB can be achieved by the DHDC
scheme over the system using no centre shifting, if we ﬁx the values of K and Ncand to 64. By contrast,
a slightly lower performance gain of about 1.5 dB can be attained if K and Ncand are set to 32, and
hence the complexity is reduced by about a factor of four. It is worth emphasizing that the DHDC-aided
system associated with K = Ncand = 64 is capable of achieving a near-MAP performance, which
can only be attained by setting K and Ncand to at least 1024 for the system using non-centre shifting
in the heavily rank-deﬁcient scenario considered. Hence, the memory required by the K-best SD was
signiﬁcantly reduced.
More importantly, the associated computational complexity is also expected to be substantially
reduced if we consider SNR = 8 dB in Figure 10.13, where the corresponding EXIT chart is portrayed.
Figure 10.13(a) depicts the 3D EXIT chart of the DHDC-aided K-best SD iterative receiver in the
scenario of an (8 × 4)-element rank-deﬁcient system. Since the function of the DHDC centre-shifting
scheme is only switched on when the maximum iterative gain of the scheme using no centre shifting is
achieved, i.e. when the resultant trajectory reaches the crossing point of the EXIT curves of the inner

and the outer decoder, the staircase-shaped decoding trajectory follows exactly the same path as with the
DHDC scheme disabled, until it reaches the intersection. Then, with the aid of the increasingly accurate
search centre provided by the DHDC centre-shifting scheme, the decoding trajectory continues to evolve
through the tunnel of Figure 10.13(a) between the 3D EXIT surface of the inner decoder and the EXIT
curve of the outer decoder, both of which are obtained by considering the a posteriori LLR values. The
resultant additional iterative gain brought about by the DHDC scheme may be more explicitly observed
if we refer to the projection of the 3D EXIT chart depicted in Figure 10.13(b). As we can see, the
maximum MI measured at the output of the channel decoder of the iterative receiver using no centre
shifting is about IE = 0.85 after four iterations exchanging extrinsic information between the inner and
outer decoder. By contrast, the maximum achievable MI approaches about IE = 0.95 with the aid of
the DHDC scheme when activating three additional iterations, thus resulting in a further reduced BER.
10.2.3.2
Two-Stage Iterative Architecture Using a Direct Soft-Decision Centre Update
In Section 10.2.3.1 we updated the search centre of the SD by making hard decisions at the output of
the channel decoder when generating the a posteriori LLRs. Given this simple centre-update strategy,
the centre-shifting scheme was capable of achieving evident performance gains as we can see in
Figure 10.12 of Section 10.2.3.1.2. However, the attainable performance improvements are expected
to be increased by exploiting the slightly more sophisticated centre-calculation technique of theDirect
Soft-Decision Centre-Shifting (DSDC) scheme, to be introduced in our forthcoming discourse. These
further improvements are expected, because the action of subjecting the LLRs to hard decisions discards
the useful soft information contained in the LLRs, which indicates how reliable our estimate of the
most recently obtained centre is. Consequently, in the DSDC scheme we calculate the soft LLRs of the
symbols based on the interleaved soft-bit information. Then the SD carries out the detection again with
this newly obtained search centre during the next iteration.

other system parameters are listed in Table 10.1.
10.2.3.2.1
Soft-Symbol Calculation
Recall that a posteriori soft-bit information delivered from the channel decoder to the SD is deﬁned to be
the logarithm of the bit-probability ratios of its two legitimate values [314], namely +1 and −1. Then,
given the received signal vector y as formulated in Equation (10.2), we can rewrite Equation (10.2) in
a more convenient form as follows:
L(xk|y) = ln P[xk = +1|y]
P[xk = −1|y].
(10.19)
Therefore, bearing in mind that we have P[xk = +1|y] = 1 −P[xk = −1|y], and taking the
exponent of both sides in Equation (10.19), it is possible to derive the probability that xk = +1 or
xk = −1 was transmitted in terms of their LLRs as follows:
eL(xk|y) =
P[xk = +1|y]
1 −P[xk = +1|y].
(10.20)
From Equation (10.20) we arrive at
P[xk = +1|y] =
eL(xk|y)
1 + eL(xk|y)
=
1
1 + e−L(xk|y) .
(10.21)
Similarly, we have
P[xk = −1|y] =
1
1 + e+L(xk|y) .
(10.22)
In the following, we consider 4-QAM as an example to discuss brieﬂy the soft-symbol calculation
process with the aid of the LLR-to-probability conversion formula of Equation (10.21) and Equa-
tion (10.22). The symbol alphabet of the 4-QAM scheme is given in Table 10.6, which indicates that
a 4-QAM symbol consists of 2 bits, the ﬁrst of which determines the imaginary part of the symbol
while the second controls the real part. Speciﬁcally, given the probabilities of two successive bits which

constitute a 4-QAM symbol, from their two legitimate values of +1 and −1, we can calculate the jth
user’s soft-symbol, sj, as follows:

(10.23)
where we assumed that the 2 bits are independent of each other, which is not entirely true owing to their
correlation imposed by the Gray mapping to the 4-QAM symbols. The probabilities P[xj,k = ±1|y]
can be calculated from Equation (10.21) and Equation (10.22) based on the a posteriori LLR values
received from the outer channel decoder.
10.2.3.2.2
Receiver Architecture and EXIT-Chart-Aided Analysis
Based on the idea of retaining the soft-bit information contained in the a posteriori LLRs, we propose
the iterative DSDC-aided K-best SD receiver portrayed in Figure 10.14, where the soft-decision block
substitutes the hard-decision and remodulation functionality of the DHDC-aided iterative receiver
shown in Figure 10.7. The scheme of Figure 10.14 provides a soft search centre for the K-best SD and,
based on the soft centres, the SD is expected to generate a better candidate list for the following LLR
calculation, which is then delivered to the outer channel decoder. Although the soft-centre calculation
imposes a slightly higher computational complexity than its hard-decision-based counterpart, the
iterative DSDC-aided K-best SD receiver is capable of attaining a higher performance gain over the
conventional iterative receiver, as observed throughout our forthcoming EXIT-chart analysis and BER
results.
Figure 10.15 compares the 3D EXIT charts of the DHDC-aided and DSDC-aided iterative receivers,
at SNR = 8 dB, in the scenario of an (8 × 4)-element rank-deﬁcient SDMA-OFDM system. We can
observe in Figure 10.15(a) that the DSDC scheme’s EXIT surface is distinctly higher than that of the
DHDC-aided SD at the same values of K or Ncand (K = Ncand = 64 in this case). Thus, for a given
number of iterations, a higher iterative gain is expected. On the other hand, since the tunnel between
the EXIT surface of the SD and the EXIT curve of the outer convolutional channel decoder opens at
a lower [IA, IE] point, when the DSDC scheme is invoked instead of the DHDC arrangement, the
centre-shifting scheme may provide performance beneﬁts at lower SNRs. Speciﬁcally, when the SNR
is too low, the EXIT surface of the SD may still be beneath the EXIT curve of the outer decoder,
even though the centre-shifting scheme was switched on after the maximum attainable iterative gain
has been achieved by the iterative receiver dispensing with centre shifting. Therefore, the higher the
corresponding EXIT surface, the better the achievable performance of the centre-shifting scheme. We
can observe in Figure 10.15(b) that the EXIT surface of the DSDC-aided receiver is still slightly higher
for K = 64 than that of the DHDC-aided one using K = 128 and hence potentially doubling
the associated complexity. In other words, the computational complexity imposed by the SD can be
substantially reduced with the aid of the DSDC scheme, without sacriﬁcing the attainable iterative gain.

higher computational complexity imposed by the search-centre calculation process. All other system
parameters are listed in Table 10.1.
10.2.3.2.3
Simulation Results
Figure 10.16 depicts the BER curves of the DSDC-aided K-best SD iterative receiver in comparison
with those of the conventional iterative receiver dispensing with centre shifting and the DHDC-aided
iterative receiver in the scenario of an (8 × 4)-element rank-deﬁcient 4-QAM SDMA-OFDM system.
The system parameters used and the iteration mode control remain the same as listed in Table 10.5,
except that the centre-shifting scheme is changed to the DSDC. As seen in Figure 10.16, a better BER
performance can be achieved in both scenarios where K = Ncand = 32 and K = Ncand = 64 were
employed by the DSDC-aided iterative receiver than that by the DHDC-aided one. These observations
conﬁrm our discussions based on the EXIT-chart analysis of Figure 10.15. Remarkably, by having a
list length of K = Ncand = 64, the DSDC-aided receiver outperforms the conventional iterative
receiver using no centre shifting having a high complexity associated with a list size of K = Ncand =
1024. This remarkable performance improvement is achieved while simultaneously approaching the
performance of the exact MAP detector, which may be implementationally infeasible, especially in
such a heavily rank-deﬁcient system. The additional iterative gain attained by the DSDC scheme can
be observed from the EXIT charts plotted in Figure 10.17. More speciﬁcally, since the value of K and
Ncand are as low as 64, no additional iterative gains can be achieved by the system using the DHDC
scheme beyond a few iterations. By contrast, as soon as the DSDC scheme is activated, a substantially
higher iteration gain is attained.
10.2.3.3
Two-Stage Iterative Architecture Using an Iterative SIC-MMSE-Aided Centre Update
As evidenced by our simulation results shown in Figure 10.16, upon exploiting the soft-bit information
contained in the a posteriori LLRs gleaned from the channel decoder, the DSDC centre-shifting scheme
brings about a higher performance gain than its hard-decision-based counterpart, i.e. the DHDC scheme.

In order to exploit the soft information further so that the K-best SD iterative receiver beneﬁts more
substantially from the centre-shifting scheme at the cost of a slightly higher computational complexity,
we take advantage of the iterative Soft-Interference-Cancellation-aided MMSE (SIC-MMSE) [572,573]
algorithm in order to generate the search centre for the SD.
10.2.3.3.1
SIC-Aided MMSE Algorithm [572,573]
As discussed in Section 10.2.3.2, given the a posteriori LLRs, we can calculate the corresponding soft
symbol for a speciﬁc modulation scheme, i.e. 4-QAM, using Equation (10.21), Equation (10.22) and
Equation (10.23). Similarly, given the a priori LLRs, we can also deﬁne the jth user’s soft symbol, more
precisely the mean of the jth user’s symbol, as [572]
¯sj = E[sj] =

q
s(q)
j
· P[sj = s(q)
j ],
(10.24)
where q is the number of points in the modulation constellation, e.g. q = 4 for 4-QAM or QPSK, while
s(q)
j
represents the qth legitimate value of the symbol sj. Consequently, for 4-QAM, we arrive at
¯sj = (ℜ(sj); ℑ(sj))
= [P[xj,2 = −1] · (+1) + P[xj,2 = +1] · (−1);
P[xj,1 = −1] · (+1) + P[xj,1 = +1] · (−1)]/
√
2,
(10.25)
where P[xk = ±1] can be computed according to [314]:
P[xk = +1] =
eL(xk)
1 + eL(xk)
=
1
1 + e−L(xk)
(10.26)
and
P[xk = −1] =
1
1 + e+L(xk) ,
(10.27)

330
Chapter 10. Reduced-Complexity Iterative Sphere Detection
respectively. On the other hand, we deﬁne the covariance of the jth user’s symbol as [572,574]
vj = Cov[sj, sj]
= E[sjs∗
j] −E[¯sj]E[¯s∗
j ]
(10.28)
= 1 −|¯sj|2,
(10.29)
for constant modulus modulation schemes, such as BPSK, QPSK and 4-QAM.
The estimated symbol of the jth user generated by the MMSE algorithm can be expressed with the
aid of the SIC principle as [572,573]
ˆsj = ¯sj + vjwH
j (y −H¯s),
(10.30)
where the jth column of the MMSE weight matrix WMMSE can be expressed as [572,573]
wj,MMSE = (HVHH + 2σ2
wIP )−1hj,
(10.31)
where IP represents the (P × P)-element identity matrix and V = diag[v1, v2, . . . , vJ].
As we may notice for the ﬁrst iteration, the a priori LLRs gleaned from the outer decoder are not
available, i.e. we have LA(CC) = 0, which in turn leads to ¯sj = 0 and vj = 1, j = 1, 2, . . . , J. In the
sequel, the resultant search centre computed in Equation (10.30) is actually the conventional MMSE
solution, where Equation (10.30) converges to the non-SIC-aided MMSE algorithm expressed as
ˇsj = wH
j y,
(10.32)
where
wj,MMSE = (HHH + 2σ2
nIP )−1hj.
(10.33)
However, the SIC-MMSE starts to take effect from the second iteration onward, which is expected
to provide a more accurate search centre for the SD than both the previously investigated DHDC
and DSDC schemes, since in addition to retaining the soft-bit information during the soft-symbol
generation, it carries out the soft interference cancellation at each iteration.
10.2.3.3.2
Receiver Architecture and EXIT-Chart Analysis
In this section we investigate the SIC-MMSE-aided iterative centre-shifting K-best SD receiver
depicted in Figure 10.18, where the a posteriori LLR feedback-based DHDC and DSDC schemes
are replaced by the SIC-MMSE-aided search-centre calculation, which is carried out on the a priori
LLRs gleaned from the channel decoder. Therefore, as portrayed in Figure 10.19, we may consider the
modiﬁed SD as a single input component fed with the a priori LLRs and producing a single output,
namely the extrinsic LLRs, which contains both the centre-calculation part and the original SD part.
Then the EXIT chart used to analyse the system becomes two dimensional.
The beneﬁts of the SIC-MMSE-aided centre-shifting scheme become clearer if we refer to the EXIT
charts obtained in the (8 × 4)-element rank-deﬁcient scenario of the 4-QAM SDMA-OFDM system
as seen in Figure 10.20. Recall from Figure 10.2 that the inner decoder’s EXIT curve decayed upon
increasing the a priori information, owing to the ﬂawed information exchange between the inner and
outer decoders, which was caused by the employment of an insufﬁciently large candidate list size Ncand
and by the number of candidates K retained at each search level. The comparisons in Figure 10.20(a)
indicate that this problem was effectively solved by the application of the SIC-MMSE-aided centre-
shifting scheme. More explicitly, when using the SIC-MMSE scheme, the inner decoder’s EXIT curve
no longer decays when the a priori MI increases, even when using a limited list size of K = Ncand =
16. On the other hand, as shown in Figure 10.20(b), when K and Ncand are increased to 128 and 1024
for the K-best SD using no centre shifting, both of the resultant inner decoder’s EXIT curves increase.
As expected, the EXIT curve corresponding to K = Ncand = 1024 reaches a higher end point than that

associated with K = Ncand = 128. However, as a beneﬁt of the SIC-MMSE centre-shifting scheme,
the EXIT curve of the inner decoder may arrive at an even higher end point, despite using smaller K
and Ncand values than that of the SD dispensing with centre shifting and high values of K and Ncand,
such as 1024. Hence, we can infer from the above observations that the SIC-MMSE-aided receiver is
capable of achieving a near-MAP BER performance conjunction with small values of K and Ncand.

Simulation Results
Both subﬁgures of Figure 10.21 show a signiﬁcant performance gain, which was facilitated by the SIC-
MMSE-aided centre-shifting K-best SD iterative receiver. Speciﬁcally, as seen in Figure 10.20(a), the
SIC-MMSE-aided centre-shifting K-best SD is capable of approaching almost the same iterative gain
by setting K = 16 as iterative SD using no centre shifting does in conjunction with K = 1024, at
a BER of 10−5. Hence, both the associated memory requirements and the computational complexity
imposed are substantially reduced. Explicitly, for a ﬁxed value of K, such as for example K = 32 and
for the same target BER of 10−5, we can observe that the iterative gain over the non-iterative receiver

On the other hand, in Figure 10.21(b) we compare the achievable performance of the three proposed

SD in the scenario of an (8 × 4)-element rank-deﬁcient SDMA-OFDM system. We classify the centre-
shifting schemes into two categories, namely the hard-decision-based methods, such as the DHDC
scheme, and the soft-decision-based techniques, which include the two other centre-shifting schemes,

exploiting the soft-bit information that arrives at the SD from the outer channel decoder. As argued
earlier, the better the soft information exploited by the centre-shifting scheme, the higher the achievable
performance improvement or the higher the attainable complexity reduction facilitated by the SISO
SD-aided iterative receiver. As seen in Figure 10.21(b), performance gains of about 2.5 and 2 dB are
attained by the SIC-MMSE centre-shifting scheme over the DHDC and the DSDC schemes at the cost
of a slightly higher computational complexity, respectively, at the target BER of 10−5. Therefore, the
SIC-MMSE-aided centre-shifting scheme signiﬁcantly outperforms the other two by invoking the idea
of SIC.
We quantify the achievable performance gain and the complexity reduction facilitated by the SIC-
MMSE-aided centre-shifting scheme in Table 10.7, in comparison with the conventional non-centre-
shifting SD-aided iterative receiver. Again, we view the SD module as being constituted by two
serially concatenated parts, namely the SD and the MAP decoder, which are responsible for carrying
out the list generation and the soft-bit-information calculation, respectively. Table 10.7 quantiﬁes the
computational complexity imposed by the SD section in terms of the total number of PED evaluations,
and that associated with the MAP part in terms of the total number of OF evaluations corresponding
to the two terms in Equation (10.14). Thus, as explicitly indicated in Table 10.7, in order to achieve
a near-MAP performance, i.e. to achieve a BER of 10−5 at an SNR below 11 dB in the context of an
(8 × 4)-element rank-deﬁcient SDMA-OFDM system, we have to use at least K = Ncand = 1024
for the non-centre-shifting SD-aided iterative receiver. However, using the SIC-MMSE-aided centre-
shifting scheme, we can achieve the same goal by setting K = Ncand = 16 while imposing a factor
of 11 lower computational complexity than that associated with the list-generation part and imposing a
factor of 64 lower computational efforts by the soft-bit-information calculation of the SD receiver using
no centre shifting. A further additional performance gain of 0.8 dB can be obtained by setting K = 32,
at the cost of a modestly increased computational complexity. Furthermore, our extensive simulation
results indicate that in a heavily rank-deﬁcient system, setting K to a value higher than 32 can hardly
improve the achievable performance gain further, if our target BER is below 10−2, since a near-MAP
performance has already been achieved.

10.3
A Priori LLR-Threshold-Assisted Low-Complexity
SD
It transpires from Section 9.2.3 that having an insufﬁciently large candidate list, Ncand = K, does
not guarantee the K-best SD of Section 9.2.3 and that its candidate list includes the ML point, while
its depth-ﬁrst counterpart of Section 9.2.2 does. When the value of K was kept low to maintain a low
computational complexity, this resulted in a considerable performance degradation in Figure 9.8. In
order to circumvent this problem, in this section another novel complexity-reduction scheme, referred
to as the A priori LLR Threshold (ALT) technique, is designed for the K-best SD. Similar to the centre-
shifting scheme, its philosophy is also based on exploitation of the a priori LLRs provided by the outer
channel decoder, albeit in a rather different way. First of all, in Section 10.3.1, the operating principle
of this novel complexity-reduction technique is highlighted. The analysis of this technique in terms of
its achievable performance and the computational complexity imposed is carried out with the aid of our
simulation results in Section 10.3.2.
10.3.1
Principle of the ALT-Aided Detector
Firstly, let us review the deﬁnition of the a priori LLRs, which is the logarithm of the ratio of the bit
probabilities associated with +1 and −1 [314], which can be expressed as follows:
LA(xj) = ln P[xj = +1]
P[xj = −1].
(10.34)
Therefore, the sign of the resultant LLRs indicates whether the current bit is more likely to be +1
or −1, whereas the magnitude reﬂects how reliable the decision concerning the current bit is. For
example, given a large positive a priori LLR delivered by the outer channel decoder of Figure 10.1, it is
implied that the corresponding transmitted bit is likely to have been +1. In light of this, the search tree
of the depth-ﬁrst SD of Section 9.2.2 may be signiﬁcantly simpliﬁed by invoking an ALT. To be speciﬁc,
ﬁrst we consider BPSK modulation as an example. If the a priori LLR of the mth user’s BPSK symbol
is sufﬁciently high (higher than the ALT), there is no need to carry out the detection for that particular
user during the SD process. In other words, at the (m + 1)th search tree level, all the resultant tree
nodes are expanded by a single branch instead of retaining both legitimate detection options. Therefore,
for the depth-ﬁrst SD of Section 9.2.2, the computational complexity is expected to be signiﬁcantly
reduced as we can observe from the search tree portrayed in Figure 10.22 in the scenario of a BPSK
SDMA system where four users are supported. The application of the ALT scheme in the context of the
example shown in Figure 9.4 of Section 9.2.2 generates a more simple tree structure, which imposes
a reduced detection complexity. Since ALT = 7, which is lower than the absolute values of both the
(m = 4)th user’s and (m = 2)th user’s LLRs arriving from the outer decoder of Figure 10.1 after
a certain number of iterations, the SD will discard all the branches corresponding to s4 = 0 at the
(m = 4)th level and s2 = 1 at the (m = 2)th level. Consequently, the ﬁnal ML solution is attained
after visiting only nine tree nodes and leaves in Figure 10.22. Hence, as long as the ALT is not too
low, the computational complexity imposed can be substantially reduced by invoking the ALT scheme
without any BER performance degradation, which becomes explicit by comparing the search trees as
shown in Figures 9.4 and 10.22.
The depth-ﬁrst SD of Section 9.2.2 was brieﬂy revisited in the previous section when invoking
the ALT technique, which is also applicable in the context of the breadth-ﬁrst-style K-best SD. More
explicitly, the main beneﬁt of employing the ALT scheme, for the breadth-ﬁrst SD, such as the K-best
SD of Section 9.2.3, is not the achievable complexity reduction, but rather the potential performance
improvement attained, since although there are still only K candidates expected to be retained at the mth
search tree level of Figure 10.23, the affordable search complexity is assigned to the candidates having
a speciﬁc bit value at the mth position, which is determined by the speciﬁc LLR-based decision. In
other words, the LLR-based search tree pruning portrayed in Figure 10.23(b) decreases the probability

of discarding a potentially correct path at an early search stage, especially when the value of K is set
relatively small. When applying the ALT-assisted K-best SD to a four-user BPSK-modulated SDMA
system, the resultant search tree is as portrayed in Figure 10.23. As can be seen in Figure 10.23(a), when
dispensing with the ALT scheme, after 15 PED evaluations the SD opts for the speciﬁc tree leaf having
a Euclidean distance of 0.56. Then the search portrayed in Figure 10.23(a) backtracks to the (m = 4)th
level, yielding the hypothesized ML solution. However, as the ALT scheme is invoked, a better pruning
search tree is obtained for the K-best SD, which is shown in Figure 10.23(b), if we assume that the
absolute values of the a priori LLRs of both the (m = 4)th and the (m = 2)th users exceed the preset
ALT value. Only nine PED evaluations have been carried out for this particular example, indicating a
considerable reduction of the computational complexity imposed. However, even more importantly, the
SD successfully identiﬁes the true ML solution, which is different from the one generated by the SD
characterized in Figure 10.23(a), where the latter dispenses with the ALT technique. This is achieved
by backtracking during the search from a different tree leaf having a smaller Euclidean distance of 0.39
to the (m = 4)th level. Hence the incorrect search branch corresponding to s4 = 0 is truncated as early
as at the (m = 4)th level, thus reducing the computational complexity imposed while simultaneously
avoiding the situation of discarding a potential path leading to the true ML solution, which may be the
case for the non-ALT-assisted K-best SD at the (m = 2)th level owing to the fact that the true ML path
may have a temporarily larger PED.

BER Performance Gain
In this section, we concentrate our investigations on the novel ALT scheme in the context of the K-
best SD, which is based on our simulation results. Figure 10.24 depicts the BER performance of the
ALT-assisted K-best SD in the scenario of the (8 × 4)-element rank-deﬁcient 4-QAM SDMA-OFDM
system in comparison with the system dispensing with the ALT technique. Given a target BER of 10−5
and a ﬁxed list length Ncand = K = 16, a performance gain of 2.5 dB can be achieved by setting the
ALT to 7, whereas a performance gain of about 1 dB can be obtained for the system using K = 128.

(a) the overall computational complexity per channel use for different Eb/N0 values (ALT = 7);
(b) the computational complexity per channel use of each iteration (K = 128, ALT = 7). Note that the
maximum number of iterations for all different Eb/N0 values was ﬁxed to 8 and the iterative detection
was terminated as soon as no more iteration gain can be achieved, i.e. the resultant EXIT trajectory line
reached the convergence point of [IA, IE] = [1, 1].
the centre-shifting scheme introduced in Section 10.2.3 and the ALT scheme are achieved at the cost
of an acceptable computational complexity investment, since the candidate list has to be regenerated
at each iteration. However, the memory requirement imposed is expected to be reduced, since there is
no need to store the resultant candidate list. The complexity imposed by invoking the ALT scheme can
be viewed in Figure 10.25(a), where the overall computational complexity quantiﬁed in terms of the
number of PED evaluations per channel use imposed by the system operating both with and without the
aid of the ALT scheme (ALT = 7) is plotted for the (8 × 4)-element rank-deﬁcient 4-QAM SDMA-
OFDM system. Speciﬁcally, since SD has to be carried out only once per channel use, regardless of
how many iterations have been carried out, the receiver not beneﬁtting from the ALT technique exhibits
the same computational complexity of 2388 PED evaluations per channel use for K = 128, regardless
of the channel SNR. By contrast, the number of PED evaluations required by the ALT-assisted receiver
differs for different SNRs. To be speciﬁc, observe in Figure 10.25(a) that the complexity increases
steadily as the SNR increases from 2 to 7 dB, peaking at about 17 000 PED evaluations per channel use.
Beyond 7 dB, the complexity decays steadily as the SNR increases further, but levels out around 5000
PED evaluations at an SNR of 12 dB. Upon inspecting both Figure 10.24 and Figure 10.25(a), we can
see that no performance gain is achieved by the ALT-aided receiver when the SNR is lower than 6 dB,
despite the additional computational efforts of regenerating the candidate list at each iteration. This is
not unexpected, since it is unlikely that the a priori LLRs gleaned by the outer channel decoder become
higher than the threshold of the ALT scheme, because the intersection of the inner and outer EXIT curve
occurs at a low IA value in Figure 10.38(a). Hence, it is unwise to activate the ALT scheme when the
SNR is low, since it may impose an increased complexity without any performance improvements.
On the other hand, as seen in Figure 10.24, with the advent of the ALT scheme the K-best SD
becomes capable of achieving a near-MAP performance by setting K = Ncand = 128 instead
of 1024. Recall our arguments on the complexity of the extrinsic LLR calculation for the LSD

338
Chapter 10. Reduced-Complexity Iterative Sphere Detection
outlined in Section 10.2.1.2 that the corresponding complexity is linearly proportional to Ncand, as
explicitly expressed in Equation (10.16). From this perspective, given a ﬁxed target BER performance,
the computational complexity imposed by the extrinsic LLR calculation of the K-best SD can be
considerably reduced by employing the ALT scheme. Furthermore, with reference to Figure 10.25(a),
the candidate list generation complexity of the ALT-aided receiver is well below that of its ‘non-ALT-
aided’ counterpart for the SNR range spanning from 2 to 12 dB, except for SNRs in the immediate
vicinity of 7 dB, if our aim is to achieve the near-MAP BER performance quantiﬁed in Figure 10.24,
which can be attained by having K = Ncand = 1024 for the system operating without the ALT
technique or by setting K = Ncand = 128 in the presence of the ALT scheme. More speciﬁcally,
the number of PED evaluations per channel use carried out by the non-ALT-aided system using
Ncand = 1024 remains as high as 13 652, regardless of the SNR and the number of iterations. On
the other hand, in the presence of the ALT scheme, the candidate list has to be regenerated at each
iteration; nonetheless, the total complexity imposed is substantially reduced, except for SNRs in the
immediate vicinity of 7 dB. There are two reasons for this: (1) when the SNR is low, the number of
iterations providing a useful gain is low, because there is no open tunnel between the EXIT curves of
the inner and the outer decoder, unless the SNR is sufﬁciently high; (2) by contrast, when the SNR is
high, the resultant staircase-shaped decoding trajectory can readily pass through the widely open EXIT
tunnel and reach the point of perfect convergence at [IA, IE] = [1, 1] after a low number of iterations.
Furthermore, when the SNR is high, the number of PED evaluations carried out at each iteration is
expected to decrease, as the iterations continues, as observed in Figure 10.25(b). This is due to the fact
that the a priori LLRs fed back from the outer decoder of Figure 10.1 to the SD are likely to become
higher than the LLR threshold after the ﬁrst few iterations, and this allows the ALT-assisted SD directly
to truncate the low-probability branches, leading to a reduced constellation size, which in turn results in
a reduced complexity. More speciﬁcally, the complexity histogram of Figure 10.25(b) indicates that the
higher the SNR, the more sharply the complexity drops as the iterations continue. Actually, when the
SNR is relatively high, the complexity imposed becomes more modest after a few iterations, since the
majority of the a priori LLRs fed back from the outer decoder to the SD of Figure 10.1 becomes higher
than the LLR threshold. From a different perspective, this observation also explains the reason why we
experience a complexity peak at the moderate SNR of 7 dB, where the ALT-related complexity does not
decrease sufﬁciently substantially as the iterations continue and hence a high number of iterations are
required to attain the maximum achievable iteration gain, since only a rather narrow EXIT tunnel was
created between the EXIT curves of the inner and the outer decoder.
10.3.2.3
Choice of LLR Threshold
In the previous ALT-related simulations of Sections 10.3.2.1 and 10.3.2.2, we maintained an LLR
threshold of ALT = 7, which ensured that the proposed ALT scheme performed well. However, it
is intuitive that the LLR threshold cannot be set arbitrarily, since it plays a vital role in determining
the system’s performance. To be more speciﬁc, if the threshold is set too high, the ALT scheme can
hardly affect the system’s operation, since the a priori LLRs provided by the outer decoder are unlikely
to be higher than the threshold, even after several iterations. By contrast, if the threshold is set to an
excessively low value, although the computational complexity can be substantially reduced, naturally, a
BER performance degradation is imposed. The above conjectures are veriﬁed by our simulation results
shown in Figure 10.26, where the bars in the histogram of Figure 10.26(a) represent the computational
complexity imposed, which was quantiﬁed in terms of the number of the PED evaluations per channel
use. The LLR thresholds employed by the ALT-assisted K-best SD iterative receiver were set to values
of ALT = 4, 7 and 10. Observe in Figure 10.26(a) that the lower the LLR threshold, the higher the
complexity reduction attained. The corresponding BER curves plotted in Figure 10.26(b), however,
demonstrate that when the threshold is set to an excessively low value, this may be expected to impose a
performance degradation, as the SNR increases. This is not unexpected because, when the SNR becomes
high, the a priori LLRs fed back by the outer decoder to the SD become predominantly higher than the

trajectory either reached the convergence point, or became trapped.
LLR threshold set at the very beginning of the iterative detection process. This may trigger an aggressive
search tree truncation, which in turn results in discarding the true ML branch. In other words, in this
scenario the truncation introduced by the ALT technique was activated too early, before the receiver
attained a sufﬁciently high iterative gain. For example, given a target BER of 10−5, a performance
gain of about 1.5 dB was observed in Figure 10.26(b) over that of the receiver operating without the
ALT technique, with the aid of a threshold of ALT = 7, while a performance degradation of about
1.5 dB was imposed by setting the threshold to ALT = 4. Note in Figure 10.26(b) that the BER curve
corresponding to the threshold of ALT = 10 actually coincides with that of the ‘non-ALT-assisted’
system, as shown in Figure 10.24, implying that the ALT scheme does not have any beneﬁcial effect
with the aid of such a high threshold value. In conclusion, the threshold has to be carefully adjusted to
achieve the target performance as a function of the SNR encountered.
10.3.2.4
Non-Gaussian-Distributed LLRs Caused by the ALT Scheme
Although the proposed ALT scheme is capable of providing useful performance improvements, a vital
problem, which limits its capacity, can be observed from Figure 10.27, where the EXIT charts of the
ALT-assisted receiver are plotted for four and six iterations. The decoding trajectories seen in both
Figure 10.27(a) and Figure 10.27(b), which indicate the practically achievable mutual information
improvements at the outputs of the inner and the outer decoders during the iterative process as a
beneﬁt of exploiting the a priori information available, do not match the corresponding theoretical EXIT
curves very well, leading to an achievable maximum iteration gain which is signiﬁcantly lower than that
implied by the theoretical EXIT curves. In comparison with the EXIT chart depicted in Figure 10.27(b),
where we have K = Ncand = 128, this EXIT-chart mismatch becomes even worse when K and Ncand
are as low as 16, as shown in Figure 10.27(a). More speciﬁcally, even though a widely open EXIT tunnel
was created between the EXIT curves of the inner and the outer decoders in Figure 10.27(a) with the
aid of the ALT scheme, the decoding trajectory fails to reach the point of perfect convergence at (1, 1)
since it becomes trapped at the point (0.96, 0.96), regardless of the number of iterations. This results in

a signiﬁcantly worse performance in comparison with the situation when we use K = Ncand = 128, as
observed in Figure 10.24. Actually, the ALT-aided receiver remains unable to achieve a near-error-free
performance at SNR = 10 dB even for K = 128, regardless of the number of iterations, and despite
having an open tunnel between the EXIT curves of the inner and outer decoder.
Recall that the EXIT-chart analysis of an iterative receiver is sufﬁciently accurate only on condition,
when the a priori LLRs at the input and the a posteriori LLRs at the output of a constituent module of
the iterative scheme exhibit a Gaussian distribution. That is the reason why the length of the interleaver
between the inner and outer decoders has to be sufﬁciently high, in order to maintain an approximate
Gaussian distribution. Otherwise, a mismatch may occur between the predicted and the practically
achievable gains, yielding a smaller iterative gain and difﬁculties in system performance prediction.
However, we found from our previous discussions and simulation results presented in Figure 10.27 for
LSDs that, apart from the interleaver length, the maximum iteration gain is also substantially affected by
the value of K and Ncand, as evidenced by the EXIT chart of Figure 10.2 presented in Section 10.2.1.3.
Again, a non-Gaussian distribution exhibited by the resultant LLRs at the input and output of the SD is
the cause of this phenomenon, as indicated by the simulation-based histograms of both the a priori LLRs
and of the extrinsic LLRs of the SD module after each iteration in Figure 10.28(a) and Figure 10.28(b).
When K and Ncand are sufﬁciently high, such as 1024, as shown in Figure 10.28(a), an approximate
Gaussian distribution is recorded for the LLRs upon increasing the number of iterations while also
exhibiting an increasingly higher variance. However, when K and Ncand are set to an excessively low
value, such as 32 as shown in Figure 10.28(b), after two iterations the majority of the resultant LLRs
at both the input and the output of the SD have values which are close to the LLR truncation value of
32 used in our case, leading to a distinctively non-Gaussian distribution. Hence, we cannot expect the
EXIT-chart analysis, which is based on the premise of experiencing a Gaussian LLR distribution, to
produce an accurate performance prediction.
In order to investigate further the reason behind the EXIT-chart mismatch seen in Figure 10.27, we
compare the histograms of both the a priori and the extrinsic LLRs of the SD with and without the ALT
scheme in Figure 10.29(a) and Figure 10.29(b). Consequently, we found that the application of the ALT
scheme actually degrades the accuracy of the approximate Gaussian distribution exhibited by the LLRs
at an earlier stage of the iterations, resulting in a more severe EXIT-chart mismatch problem. To be
speciﬁc, in the absence of the ALT scheme, we observe in Figure 10.29(a) that at the ﬁfth iteration the

Gaussian-like distribution is eliminated. However, in the presence of the ALT scheme, a non-Gaussian
distribution appears even earlier after the fourth iteration, as seen in Figure 10.29(b). Hence, although
the theoretical EXIT curve of the ALT-aided receiver obtained under the assumption of having a near-
Gaussian-distributed LLR all the time, as previously shown in Figure 10.27, can indeed reach the (1, 1)
point, the problem of EXIT-chart mismatch imposed by the non-Gaussian distribution of the LLRs at
both the input and output of the SD is aggravated by the application of the ALT scheme. This leads to a
more limited iterative gain than that expected from the theoretical EXIT curves of Figure 10.27.

ALT-Assisted Centre-Shifting Hybrid SD
10.3.3.1
Comparison of the Centre-Shifting and the ALT Schemes
Both the proposed centre-shifting and ALT schemes require the repeated generation of candidate lists
throughout the iterative detection process. In this section, we ﬁrst compare the ALT scheme with the
SIC-MMSE-aided centre-shifting scheme, which was formed to be the most efﬁcient of all the three
centre-shifting schemes proposed in Section 10.2.3.
From the BER curves depicted in Figures 10.21 and 10.24, we observe that in order to achieve the
near-MAP performance exhibited by the SIC-MMSE-aided centre-shifting K-best SD iterative receiver
using K = 32, we have to set K = 128 for the ALT-assisted receiver. In other words, given a target
BER, the SIC-MMSE-aided centre-shifting scheme imposes a signiﬁcantly lower complexity than the
ALT scheme, as quantiﬁed in Figure 10.30(a), where their corresponding computational complexity is
characterized versus the SNR quantiﬁed in terms of the total number of PED evaluations per channel
use. Speciﬁcally, although a fairly sharp drop can be seen in the complexity imposed by the ALT-
assisted receiver as the SNR increased from a moderate level to a relatively high value, the ALT-assisted

receiver still requires a considerably higher computational effort to match the BER performance of its
centre-shifting-aided counterpart. On the other hand, the above-mentioned sharp drop in the complexity
imposed by the ALT-aided K-best SD when the SNR is increased relatively high is caused by the
fact that the complexity imposed per iteration decreases as the iterative detection proceeds, as can be
observed in Figure 10.30(b), where we have a relatively high of SNR = 8 dB.
10.3.3.2
ALT-Assisted Centre-Shifting Hybrid SD
Since the computational complexity imposed by the ALT scheme per iteration is expected to decrease
as the iterations proceed as observed in Figure 10.30(b), in this section we propose a hybrid SD-aided
iterative receiver, which combines the beneﬁts of the ALT scheme and the SIC-MMSE centre-shifting
scheme, in attempting to reduce the associated complexity further. In comparison with the centre-
shifting SD receiver dispensing with the ALT technique, a small performance degradation is imposed
if the ALT scheme is employed, as seen in Figure 10.31. This is not unexpected, since a non-Gaussian
distribution was exhibited by the soft-bit information, i.e. by the LLRs, which are exchanged between
the inner and outer decoders, leading to a limited iterative gain. On the other hand, the computational
complexity imposed by the candidate list generation phase of the SD is signiﬁcantly reduced, as seen
in Figure 10.32. More speciﬁcally, Figure 10.32(a) depicts the overall computational complexity of
the hybrid receiver per channel use for different SNRs in contrast to that of the pure SIC-MMSE-
assisted centre-shifting SD receiver. By contrast, Figure 10.32(b) shows the computational complexity
per channel use at each iteration, i.e. as a function of the iteration index. Both of the two receivers
we compared here have to carry out the candidate list regeneration at each iteration. As shown in
Figure 10.32(b), when invoking the ALT scheme, the hybrid system exhibits a gradually reduced

complexity as the iterations proceed, while the pure centre-shifting-aided receiver imposes a constant
complexity at each iteration. Hence, the resultant overall computational complexity of the hybrid
receiver is signiﬁcantly reduced. To be speciﬁc, for the candidate list generation phase, only about half
the computational efforts are required by the hybrid receiver at high SNRs, as seen in Figure 10.32(a).

URC-Aided Three-Stage Iterative Receiver
Employing SD
Recently, a URC three-stage serially concatenated system was proposed [575] in the context of SISO
MMSE turbo equalization. A rate 1 encoder and its corresponding decoder are amalgamated with
the transmitter and the receiver, respectively. Therefore, the extrinsic LLRs are exchanged between
three blocks, i.e. the MMSE equalizer, the URC decoder and the convolutional decoder at the receiver,
resulting in a signiﬁcant performance gain which was explicitly indicated by the resultant EXIT charts
shown in [575, 576]. In this section, we transplant the URC-aided three-stage concept into our SD-
aided MIMO system. The investigation of the resultant system’s performance has been carried out using
both EXIT-chart analysis and Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, the performance of the centre-shifting
scheme in this scenario will also be studied.

Figure 10.33 depicts the system model of the SD-aided three-stage serially concatenated transceiver in
the context of an Uplink (UL) SDMA-OFDM system, where each user has a single transmit antenna,
as we have always assumed so far. At the transmitter, a block of L information bits u1 is ﬁrst encoded
by the convolutional channel encoder I in order to generate the coded bits c1, which are interleaved by
the interleaver Π1 of Figure 10.33. Then the resultant permuted bits u2 are successively fed through

delivered to the bit-to-symbol modulator/mapper. Note that the labels u and c represent the uncoded
and coded bits, respectively, corresponding to a speciﬁc module as indicated by the subscript. For
example, u2 and c2 denote the uncoded bits and the coded bits at the input and the output of the
URC encoder II of Figure 10.33, respectively. At the receiver of Figure 10.33, which comprises three
modules, namely the SD, the URC decoder II and the convolutional channel decoder II, the extrinsic
information is exchanged among the blocks in a number of consecutive iterations. Speciﬁcally, as
shown in Figure 10.33, A(·) represents the a priori information expressed in terms of the LLRs, while
E(·) denotes the corresponding extrinsic information. Hence, the URC decoder generates two extrinsic
outputs by processing two a priori inputs delivered from both the SD and the convolutional decoder II.
After completing the last iteration, the estimates ˆu1 of the original transmitted information bit u1 are
produced by the convolutional channel decoder I.
We denote the MI between the a priori value A(s) and the symbol s as IA(s), and the MI between the
extrinsic value E(s) and the symbol s by IE(s). Hence, the MI of the two outputs of the URC decoder,
namely IE(u2) and IE(c2), are functions of the two a priori MI inputs, namely IA(u2) and IA(c2).
Explicitly, we have [575]
IE(u2) = Tu2(IA(u2), IA(c2)),
(10.35)
IE(c2) = Tc2(IA(u2), IA(c2)).
(10.36)
Therefore, two 3D EXIT charts corresponding to the above two equations are needed in order to describe
fully the EXIT characteristics of the URC decoder. In contrast to the double-input, double-output URC
module of Figure 10.33, both the SD and the convolutional decoder can be viewed as SISO modules,
for a given received signal vector. Thus, a single 2D EXIT chart is sufﬁcient for characterizing each of

them. Similarly, we have the corresponding EXIT functions expressed as [575]
IE(u3) = Tu3(IA(u3), Eb/N0)
(10.37)
for the SD and
IE(c1) = Tc1(IA(c1))
(10.38)
for the convolutional channel decoder. We note that since the MI IE(u3) of the SD’s output is
independent of IA(u2), the traditional EXIT curve of the SD portrayed in the 2D space of Figure 10.2
can be extended to the 3D space by sliding the EXIT curve along the IA(u2)-axis. That is to say, the
EXIT characteristics of the SD can be portrayed as an EXIT surface in one of the two 3D EXIT charts
of the URC decoder, namely Figure 10.34(a). Similarly, the EXIT surface of the outer convolutional
decoder can be generated as depicted in Figure 10.34(b) together with the other 3D EXIT chart of
the URC decoder, since IE(c1) of Equation (10.38) is independent of IA(c2). Consequently, in total
two 3D EXIT charts are required for plotting all the EXIT functions. To be speciﬁc, Figure 10.34(a) for
Equation (10.36) and Equation (10.37), and Figure 10.34(b) for Equation (10.35) and Equation (10.38).
The intersection of the surfaces of the SD and the URC decoder characterizes the best possible
achievable performance for different ﬁxed values of IA(u2) as the iterations between the SD and the
URC decoder are carried out, during which the soft-bit information is exchanged. More importantly,
according to Equation (10.35), for each point (IA(u2), IA(c2), IE(c2)) of the intersection line as seen in
Figure 10.34(a), there is a speciﬁc point (IA(u2), IA(c2), IE(u2)) determined by the two a priori inputs
of the URC decoder on the surface of the URC decoder in Figure 10.34(b). Hence, there must be a line
(not plotted) on the surface of the URC decoder in Figure 10.34(b) corresponding to the intersection
line in Figure 10.34(a). In order to simplify the complicated 3D EXIT-chart representation, we view
the SD and the URC decoder as a joint module with single input IE(u2) and single output IA(u2).
As a result, a classical 2D EXIT chart can be plotted, which can also be obtained by projecting the
aforementioned line on the surface of the URC decoder in Figure 10.34(b) on the IE(u2)–IA(u2) plane,
as seen in Figure 10.35(a).
Figure 10.35(a) shows the 2D EXIT chart of decoder I and the combined module of decoder II
and the SD, in comparison with that of the conventional two-stage iterative receiver. As observed in
Figure 10.2, due to the insufﬁcient length of the candidate list, the maximum achievable iterative gain

becomes rather limited, since the EXIT curve of the SD intersects that of the channel decoder at an
earlier stage, if we have K or Ncand values of 16 or 32. In other words, when the resultant decoding
trajectory gets trapped at the intersection point of the EXIT chart, where the decoding convergence
point, after a certain number of iterations, typically a residual error ﬂoor, persists. However, with the
aid of the URC decoder II seen in Figure 10.33, the point of the EXIT curve intersection of the joint
decoder II and SD module and that of decoder I moves close to the (1, 1) point, resulting in a near-error-
free performance, as long as there is an open tunnel between the two EXIT curves. More speciﬁcally,
as observed in Figure 10.35(a), for the SD-aided iterative receiver using K = 16, an open tunnel is
created between the EXIT curve of the joint SD and decoder II module and that of decoder I at an SNR of
10.2 dB. Thus, the corresponding BER curve plotted in Figure 10.35(b) conﬁrmed the predictions of the
EXIT-chart analysis seen in Figure 10.35(a), indicating that the BER decreases sharply once the SNR is
in excess of about 10.2 dB. Similarly, when we have K = 32, a lower convergence threshold of 9.7 dB is
associated with an even earlier decrease of the BER curve, as shown in Figure 10.35(b). Consequently,
given a target BER of 10−5, a performance gain of nearly 4 dB and 2 dB can be attained over the
conventional two-stage iterative receiver when employing the URC decoder II in conjunction with K =
16 and K = 32, respectively. However, as a price, the BER of the three-stage scheme is expected
to be higher than that of the two-stage receiver at low SNRs. The reason behind this phenomenon
becomes clearer if we refer to the EXIT-chart comparison of the two-stage and three-stage iterative
receivers characterized in Figure 10.35(a), where we observe that the EXIT curve of the inner decoder
of the conventional two-stage receiver has a signiﬁcantly higher starting point than that of its three-
stage counterpart, resulting in a lower convergence threshold, which in turn leads to a potential higher
iterative gain at relatively low SNRs. Although the employment of the URC encoder/decoder pair at
the transmitter/receiver is capable of moving the EXIT curve intercept point closer to (1, 1), an open
tunnel can only be formed if the value of K or Ncand as well as that of the SNR is sufﬁciently high.
This explains why the BER curve of the SD using (K = 32) drops sharply at a lower SNR than that of
the SD employing (K = 16), as seen in Figure 10.35(b).
The reason why a URC will make the slope of the EXIT-chart curve steeper, hence resulting in a
lower error ﬂoor and a higher BER waterfall threshold, can be interpreted as follows. Since the URC
has an Inﬁnite Impulse Response (IIR) due to its recursive coding structure, the corresponding EXIT-
chart curve is capable of reaching the highest point of perfect convergence to an inﬁnitesimally low

BER (1, 1), provided that the interleaver length is sufﬁciently large [577]. On the other hand, since the
URC decoder employs the MAP decoding scheme, the extrinsic probability computed at the output of
the URC decoder contains the same amount of information as the sequence at the input of the URC
decoder. In other words, the area under the inner EXIT curve remains unchanged regardless of the
employment of the URC [578, 579]. Hence, a higher end point of the EXIT curve leads to a lower
starting point, implying a steeper slope of the EXIT curve.
10.4.2
Performance of the Three-Stage Receiver Employing the
Centre-Shifting SD
The decay observed in Figure 10.2 for the combined SD and URC decoder II module’s EXIT curve
observed when K and Ncand are set to an insufﬁciently high value is caused by the corresponding
EXIT surface of the SD as plotted in Figure 10.34(a). Our previous investigations for the centre-
shifting scheme indicated that the SIC-MMSE-aided scheme is capable of ensuring that the EXIT
curve of the inner decoder, namely that of the SD, monotonically increases upon increasing IA, as
seen in Figure 10.20(a). Hence, we apply the SIC-MMSE centre-shifting scheme in the context of
the URC-aided three-stage iterative receiver, in order to improve the shape of the EXIT curve seen
in Figure 10.35(a), which may result in a relatively high convergence threshold. The three-stage SIC-
MMSE-aided centre-shifting K-best SD-assisted iterative receiver is portrayed in Figure 10.36, where
the SIC-MMSE-aided centre calculation is applied. Thus, redetection using an updated search centre
has to be carried out during each iteration that invokes the SD.
Figure 10.37 shows the resultant 3D EXIT chart of the three-stage scheme, where we observe
that the EXIT surfaces do not suffer from as severe a bending as those of the non-centre-shifting-aided
receiver characterized in Figure 10.34(a), even when K or Ncand is relatively small. The resultant EXIT
curve of the combined SD and URC decoder II module is plotted in Figure 10.38(a), for K = Ncand =
16, which does not touch the EXIT curve of decoder I. To be speciﬁc, the original convergence threshold
of the three-stage receiver using no centre shifting is about 10.2 dB, since an open tunnel is just formed

for SNRs in excess of this level. For SNRs below this level, the EXIT curve of the combined module
would fall below that of decoder I, leading to a consistently closed EXIT tunnel, as exempliﬁed by the
situation characterized by SNR = 9.6 dB, as also portrayed in Figure 10.38(a). However, owing to
the employment of the SIC-MMSE-aided centre-shifting scheme, a wide open tunnel has been created
between the EXIT curves. The convergence threshold of the SIC-MMSE centre-shifting-aided three-
stage scheme was reduced to about 9.6 dB and the resultant BER curve is plotted in Figure 10.38(b) in
comparison with that of the three-stage receiver dispensing with centre shifting. Indeed, with the aid of
the centre-shifting scheme, the BER curve starts to drop more sharply at a slightly lower SNR, which
is similar to the convergence threshold observed in Figure 10.38(a), yielding a performance gain of
0.5 dB for the target BER of 10−5. It is not unexpected that the attainable performance improvement
is insigniﬁcant, since the SIC-MMSE centre-shifting scheme fails to increase the relatively low starting
point of the EXIT curve, which is brought about by the employment of the URC decoder II.
10.4.3
Irregular Convolutional Codes for Three-Stage Iterative
Receivers
The so-called Irregular Convolutional Codes (IrCCs) [580, 581], proposed by T¨uchler and Hagenauer,
encode appropriately chosen ‘fractions’ of the input stream using punctured constituent convolutional
codes having different code rates. The appropriate ‘fractions’ are speciﬁcally designed with the aid of
EXIT charts to improve the convergence behaviour of iteratively decoded systems. Thus, with the aid of
IrCCs, we are able to solve the mismatch between the EXIT curve of the inner decoder in the three-stage
receiver and the EXIT curve of the RSC(2,1,3) code marked by crosses in Figure 10.39. Our goal is to
achieve an improved convergence behaviour for the three-stage concatenated system by minimizing the
area between the EXIT curve of the amalgamated two-compound inner code and that of the outer code.
The resultant EXIT curve of the optimized IrCC having a code rate of 0.5 is represented by the dotted
line in Fig. 10.39. Hence, a narrow but still open EXIT-chart tunnel is created, which implies having

as the outer code of the traditional two-stage receiver. As our proposed scheme, the half-rate IrCC
corresponding to the EXIT curve represented by the dotted line in Figure 10.39 is used as the outer
code in the URC-assisted three-stage receiver. Figure 10.40 compares the BER performance of both
systems, where we can see that at relatively high SNRs, both three-stage concatenated receivers –
namely the one using the SD employing the classic RSC code as well as the one employing the
optimized IrCC code – are capable of outperforming the traditional two-stage receiver equipped with
the SD. Speciﬁcally, given the target BER of 10−5, a performance gain of 2.5 dB can be attained by the
three-stage receiver over its two-stage counterpart, when both of them employ the SD (Ncand = 32)
and the regular RSC. Remarkably, when amalgamated with the URC encoder/decoder, the three-stage
receiver using the SD and Ncand = 32 becomes capable of outperforming the two-stage receiver using
the high-complexity near-MAP SD having Ncand = 1024, provided that the SNR is in excess of
about 11 dB. Furthermore, an additional performance gain of 1 dB can be attained by employing the
optimized IrCC in comparison with the classic RSC-aided three-stage system. Moreover, in order to
enhance the achievable performance further, when the SIC-MMSE-aided iterative centre-shifting SD is
invoked, another approximately 1 dB additional performance gain is attained. Consequently, as observed
in Figure 10.40, given the target BER of 10−5, overall performance gains of 4.5 dB and 2 dB are attained
by our proposed system in comparison with its SD (Ncand = 32) aided and SD (Ncand = 1024) assisted
two-stage counterparts, respectively.
In line with the EXIT-chart-based predictions of Figure 10.39, a sharp BER improvement is
achieved by the three-stage receiver, as seen in Figure 10.40, since the EXIT curve of the inner code
will rise above that of the outer code for SNRs in excess of a certain level, resulting in a consistently
open EXIT tunnel leading to the point of convergence at (1, 1), which is exempliﬁed in Figure 10.41 by
the curve recorded at SNR = 9.5 dB when using the half-rate IrCC as the outer code. Also shown in
Figure 10.41 is the staircase-shaped decoding trajectory evolving through the open tunnel to the point
of convergence at (1, 1), as recorded during our Monte Carlo simulations. The activation order of the
three SISO modules used is [3 2 1 2 1 2], where the integers represent the index (I) of the three SISO

modules. Speciﬁcally, I = 3 denotes the SD, I = 2 represents the URC decoder II and I = 1 denotes
the channel decoder I of Figure 10.36. Hence, the vertical coordinates of the points A1, A3 and A5 in
Figure 10.41 quantify the IE(u2) value measured at the output of the URC decoder II corresponding to
its three successive activations during the ﬁrst iteration, respectively, while the segments between A1
and A2 as well as between A3 and A4 represent two successive activations of the channel decoder I
during the ﬁrst iteration, respectively. The segment between A5 and A6 in Figure 10.41 denotes the
beginning of a new iteration associated with similar decoding activations.
Figure 10.42 depicts the computational complexity – which is quantiﬁed in terms of the number
of PED evaluations corresponding to the term φ of Equation (9.25) – imposed by the SD versus
Eb/N0 plot for the above-mentioned receivers. Note that the computational complexity imposed by
the K-best SD dispensing with the centre-shifting scheme remains constant for both two-stage and
three-stage receivers regardless of the SNR and the number of iterations, under the assumption that
the buffer size is sufﬁciently large to store the resultant candidate list L, which is generated by the
SD just once during the ﬁrst iteration between the SD and the channel decoder. On the other hand,
every time the search centre xc in the transmit domain is updated, the SD is required to regenerate the
candidate list. However, as observed in Figure 10.42, the candidate list size Ncand can be substantially
reduced with the aid of the centre-shifting scheme, hence the resultant overall complexity imposed
by the SD becomes signiﬁcantly lower than that of the receiver using no centre shifting. Explicitly,
the candidate list generation complexity of the SIC-MMSE centre-shifting-aided two-stage receiver is
well below that of the receiver using no centre shifting right across the SNR range spanning from 2 to
12 dB. This statement is valid if our aim is to achieve the near-MAP BER performance quantiﬁed
in Figure 10.40, which can be attained by having K = Ncand = 1024 for the system operating
without the centre-shifting scheme or by setting K = Ncand = 32 in the presence of the centre-
shifting scheme. Actually, the number of PED evaluations carried out per channel use by the system
dispensing with the centre-shifting scheme remains as high as 13 652, regardless of the SNR and the

number of iterations. On the other hand, in the presence of the centre-shifting scheme, the candidate
list has to be regenerated at each iteration; nonetheless, the total complexity imposed is substantially
reduced. We can also observe from Figure 10.42 that the centre-shifting K-best SD employed by the
URC-aided three-stage system imposes a computational complexity which is even below that of its
centre-shifting-aided two-stage counterpart, while achieving a performance gain of 2 dB for the target
BER of 10−5, as seen in Figure 10.40. Hence, the signiﬁcant complexity reduction facilitated by the
proposed SD scheme in the context of the three-stage receiver outweighs the relatively small additional
complexity cost imposed by the URC, which only employs a two-state trellis, leading to an overall
reduced complexity. Furthermore, in addition to the complexity reduction achieved by the proposed
scheme, another beneﬁt is the attainable memory reduction, since there is no need to store the resultant
candidate list for the forthcoming iterations. As a result, the memory size required can be substantially
reduced by having a signiﬁcantly reduced value of K.

Chapter Conclusions
In this chapter, our main objective was to reduce the complexity encountered by the conventional
LSD in the channel-coded iterative receiver and to contrive a near-capacity design for the SD-aided
MIMO system. To be speciﬁc, although the conventional LSD was capable of achieving a signiﬁcant
complexity reduction in comparison with the exact MAP detector, it may still impose a potentially
excessive complexity, since the LSD has to generate soft information for every transmitted bit, which
requires the observation of a high number of hypotheses about the transmitted MIMO symbol, thus
generating a large candidate list to represent the entire lattice. This complexity problem may be
aggravated by supporting an increased number of users and/or using a high-order modulation scheme,
especially in high-dimensional rank-deﬁcient MIMO systems. Therefore, in order to maintain a near-
MAP performance, while relying on a small set of symbol hypotheses, we proposed two complexity-

reduction techniques, namely the iterative centre-shifting-based SD scheme of Section 10.2 and the
ALT-assisted SD scheme of Section 10.3, both of which rely on exploitation of the soft-bit information
delivered by the outer channel decoder in the iterative receiver.
More speciﬁcally, in Section 10.2.3 three different algorithms were proposed for the iterative centre-
shifting SD, namely the DHDC, the DSDC and the SIC-MMSE- assisted search-centre calculation
schemes. It was shown in Figure 10.21(b) that the SIC-MMSE-aided scheme outperforms the other
two. This is not unexpected, since although the SIC-MMSE-aided SD scheme imposes a slightly higher
complexity in order to attain a more accurate search centre, a signiﬁcant complexity reduction may
be achieved, which is associated with the list generation and soft-bit-information calculation carried
out by the SD. Our proposition in Section 10.2.2 was that the search centre may be generated by
a more sophisticated detector than the LS or MMSE detector of conventional SDs. This generic
proposition turned the SD into a high-ﬂexibility detector, which may be beneﬁcially combined with
highly sophisticated or low-complexity linear or nonlinear detectors. In other words, the total affordable
computational complexity may be ﬂexibly split between the SD’s search-centre calculation phase and
the search phase.
Based on the exploitation of the soft-bit information, namely the a priori LLRs gleaned from the
outer channel decoder, in Section 10.3 we proposed another reduced-complexity technique termed the
ALT-aided SD scheme. Given the deﬁnition of the a priori LLRs, the sign of the LLR indicates whether
the current bit is more likely to be +1 or −1, whereas the magnitude reﬂects how reliable the decision
concerning the current bit is. Hence, the basic idea behind the ALT-aided SD scheme of Section 10.3
is as follows: when the absolute value of the a priori LLR of a speciﬁc bit is larger than the preset
ALT threshold, we assume that we have reliable knowledge of this bit being 0 or 1. As a result, the
tree search of the SD may be signiﬁcantly simpliﬁed, since the number of tentative candidates for the
corresponding tree search level may be reduced. As evidenced by Figure 10.26(b), the threshold has to
be carefully adjusted to achieve the target performance as a function of the SNR encountered. As seen

in Figure 10.24, the proposed ALT scheme is capable of providing useful performance improvements,
although these are slightly less signiﬁcant than those achieved by the SIC-MMSE-based centre-shifting-
assisted SD scheme in Figure 10.21(a). This is because the non-Gaussian distribution of the LLRs
recorded at the output of the ALT-aided SD in Figure 10.28(b) during the iterative detection process
limits the efﬁciency of the iterative detection process and imposes difﬁculties on the EXIT-chart-assisted
performance prediction.
Finally, motivated by the URC-aided three-stage SISO turbo equalizer of [575], in Section 10.4
we signiﬁcantly improved the performance of the conventional two-stage SD-aided turbo receiver of
Figure 10.1. We achieved this improvement by intrinsically amalgamating the SD with the decoder of
a URC having an IIR, both of which were embedded in a channel-coded SDMA-OFDM transceiver,
thereby creating the powerful three-stage serially concatenated scheme of Figure 10.36. To achieve
a near-capacity performance, observed in Figure 10.36, IrCCs were used as the outer code for the
proposed iterative centre-shifting SD-aided three-stage system. Consequently, we demonstrated in
Figure 10.40 that at the target BER of 10−5, an Eb/N0 performance gain as high as 4.5 dB was attained
by the system of Figure 10.36 using the MMSE-based centre-shifting SD relying on a low-complexity
candidate list size of Ncand = 32, in comparison with its two-stage counterpart of Figure 10.18 in the
challenging scenario of an (8 × 4)-element rank-deﬁcient 4-QAM SDMA-OFDM uplink system.
In Table 10.8 we quantitatively summarize and compare the different SD-aided receivers’ per-
formance as well as complexity in the context of an (8 × 4)-element 4-QAM SDMA-OFDM rank-
deﬁcient system. As observed in Table 10.8, the combination of the SIC-MMSE-aided centre-shifting
and the ALT schemes is capable of achieving a near-MAP performance at the lowest complexity for
the conventional two-stage receiver. A further performance gain of 1.6 dB may be attained by our near-
capacity design using the URC-aided three-stage receiver.

Introduction
11.1.1
System Model
In previous chapters, the SDMA-OFDM system supporting U single-antenna-assisted MSs was
considered, where the multi-user data streams sharing the same time/frequency channel can be
distinguished at the BS with the aid of their unique user-speciﬁc spatial signature constituted by
their CIRs, resulting in a potentially signiﬁcant increase in spectral efﬁciency. The separability of
the individual MIMO links relies on the presence of rich multi-path propagation, which requires a
sufﬁciently high antenna spacing, in order to ensure that the individual channels between pairs of
the transmit and receive antennas exhibit an independent Rayleigh distribution and the absence of a
strong Line-Of-Sight (LOS) path. In light of this interpretation, SDMA transmissions can be viewed as
MIMO schemes maximizing the system’s overall throughput.
On the other hand, instead of maximizing the system’s overall throughput, another powerful family
of MIMO schemes was designed for achieving spatial diversity, which is usually quantiﬁed in terms
of the number of decorrelated spatial branches available at the transmitter or receiver. This number is
referred to as the diversity order. An effective and practical way of achieving MIMO-aided diversity
is to employ space–time coding (STC), which is a speciﬁc coding technique designed for MIMO
systems equipped with multiple spatially separated transmit antennas. When the signals of a speciﬁc
user are launched from different transmit antennas during different time slots, the independently fading
channels are less likely to encounter deep fades simultaneously. Hence, the MIMO system is capable
of exploiting the independently fading paths of multi-path propagation environments, provided that the
transmit antennas are sufﬁciently far from each other so that they experience independent fading. In
practice the separation of the antennas has to be of the order of at least a few wavelengths, otherwise
the maximum achievable diversity gain may erode. At a carrier frequency of 2 GHz the wavelength is
15 cm and hence the required antenna separation would be in excess of, say, half a metre – a distance
which is affordable at the BS, but not at the MS. Fortunately, single-antenna-aided MSs can share their
antennas with the aid of cooperative communication principles, as we will detail later in the book.

Figure 11.1: Schematic of a generalized SDMA-OFDM wireless uplink transmission system.
As argued above, the family of MIMO transmission schemes may be subdivided into two main
categories: those designed for achieving spatial multiplexing and spatial diversity, which aim to
maximize the data rate and to minimize the transmission error rate, respectively. It is worth noting,
however, that there have been proposals in the literature which are capable of striking a more ﬂexible
compromise between the achievable rate and reliability [582]. Therefore, in this chapter we consider a
UL Multi-User MIMO (MU-MIMO) system, where the SDMA technique used as a spatial multiple-
access scheme signiﬁcantly increases the system’s overall throughput without requiring extra spectrum.
Meanwhile, in order to attain the spatial diversity gains, multiple antennas are assumed to be employed
by each user. Thus, the multiple-transmit-antenna-assisted STC scheme may be employed by each
uplink user to provide diversity gains in addition to the spatial multiplexing gain, which renders the
system more robust to hostile wireless fading channels.
More speciﬁcally, the generalized SDMA-OFDM UL transmission scenario is as depicted in
Figure 11.1, where each of the U synchronous co-channel users/MSs is equipped with Mu transmit
antennas and employs a speciﬁc STC scheme, while the BS has N receive antenna elements. Hence,
under the assumption that each MS is equipped with the same number of transmit antenna elements, the
total number of transmit antennas is M = M1+M2+· · ·+MU = U·Mu. The space–time modulator of
the uth MS maps a sequence of bits b(k)B−1
k=0 to a sequence of Mu×1 symbol vectors s(t)J−1
t=0 , which are
transmitted with the aid of its own Mu transmit antenna elements during J successive symbol periods
of duration T . Generally, each space–time signal of the uth MS can be expressed as a (Mu×J)-element
matrix given by

average rate, or throughput, of a speciﬁc space–time code is B/J bps/Hz. Note that for a pure spatial
multiplexing system, we have J = 1, since there is no spatial or temporal correlation introduced among
the transmitted signals.
The multiple transmit antennas of each MS are assumed to be positioned as far apart as possible to
ensure that signals launched from the different transmit antennas experience independent or spatially

uncorrelated fading channels.1 Hence, at an arbitrary time, the link between each pair of transmit and
receiver antennas may be characterized with the aid of a unique transmit-antenna-speciﬁc FD-CTF,
which is denoted as h(u)
nm. The superscript and subscript on h represent the user and the antenna element
index, respectively. For example, the FD-CTF or the spatial signature of transmit antenna element m of
the uth user can be expressed as a column vector:
h(u)
m = [h(u)
1m, h(u)
2m, . . . , h(u)

(11.3)
with m ∈1, . . . , Mu and u ∈1, . . . , U. If the mth transmit antenna element’s signal is denoted by s(u)
m ,
and the received signal plus the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) at receive antenna element n is
represented by yn and wn, respectively, the entire SDMA system can be described by a matrix equation
written as
y = Hs + w,
(11.4)
where the received signal vector is y ∈CN×1, the transmitted signal vector is s ∈CM×1, and the
noise vector is w ∈CN×1, which are given by the following equations, respectively:
y = [y1, y2, . . . , yN]T ,

1, 2, . . . , Mu and receive antenna element n ∈1, 2, . . . , N are independent, stationary, complex-
valued Gaussian-distributed processes with a zero mean and a unit variance [542]. Furthermore, both
the mth transmit antenna element’s signal s(u)
m of user u and the AWGN noise, wn, at the nth antenna
element exhibit a zero mean and a variance of σ2
s and 2σ2
w, respectively. Note that the elements of the
matrix H represent the FD-CTF, since our SDMA systems are considered to be combined with OFDM
systems [542] as brieﬂy discussed in Section 1.1.1.
Finally, although the above-mentioned system model describes a generalized MU-MIMO transmis-
sion scheme, it is also applicable to a Single-User MIMO (SU-MIMO) scenario, when setting U = 1.
11.1.2
Chapter Contributions and Outline
The concept of combining orthogonal transmit diversity designs with the principle of Sphere Pack-
ing (SP) [583] was introduced by Su et al. in [584] to maximize the achievable coding advantage,
demonstrating that the proposed SP-aided STBC (STBC-SP) scheme was capable of outperforming
the conventional orthogonal designed STBC schemes of [585–587] in the SU-MIMO DL scenario.
Against this background, our main contribution in this chapter is the challenging design of the K-best
1In the case of compact handheld communicators, the affordable separation may not be sufﬁciently high to ensure independent
fading in the uplink, since the wavelength at a carrier frequency of 2 GHz is 15 cm, hence perhaps a separation of half the wavelength
is affordable. A laptop backplane is more suitable for providing a higher antenna separation, but even in this case the associated
correlation of the signals would erode the achievable transmit diversity gain. More independent fading may be ensured by forming a
virtual MIMO from the single antennas of cooperating users.

SD for SP-modulated systems, which extends the employment of STBC-SP schemes to MU-MIMO
scenarios, while approaching the MAP performance at a moderate complexity. More speciﬁcally, the
novel contributions of this chapter are listed as follows:
• We improve the STBC performance by jointly designing the space–time signals of the two time
slots of an SDMA UL scheme using SP modulation, while existing orthogonal designs make no
attempt to do so owing to its potentially complex detection.
• We solve this potential complexity problem by further developing the K-best SD for detection
of SP modulation, because SP offers a substantial SNR reduction at the cost of increased
complexity, which is reduced by the new SD.
The remainder of this chapter is organized as follows. The fundamentals of orthogonal STBC
schemes are brieﬂy reviewed in Section 11.2.1, followed by a discourse on the orthogonal design of
STBC schemes using SP modulation in Section 11.2.2. Then, in Section 11.3 our SD design contrived
for the STBC-SP-assisted MU-MIMO system is detailed. More speciﬁcally, based on the bit-by-bit
MAP detection scheme designed for the STBC-SP-aided MU-MIMO system derived in Section 11.3.1,
a multi-layer tree search referred to as the user-based tree search is proposed in Section 11.3.2 in order
to render the conventional SD applicable to the above-mentioned SP-modulated scenario. Finally, we
provide our concluding remarks in Section 11.4.

11.2.1.1
STBC Encoding
STBCs describe the relationship between the original symbol stream stored in the column vector x
and the redundant signal replicas artiﬁcially constructed at the transmitter for transmission from the
different antennas during different time slots or symbol periods. Generally, an STBC can be described
by an (Mu×J)-dimensional transmission matrix as deﬁned earlier in Equation (11.2) of Section 11.1.1.
A simple but elegant Orthogonal STBC (OSTBC) scheme employing two transmit antennas was
discovered by Alamouti [585] and was later generalized by Tarokh et al. in [586] to an arbitrary number
of antennas. This remarkable scheme enables the receiver to perform ML detection based on low-
complexity linear processing, yet achieving the maximum attainable transmit diversity by imposing
a low extra encoding complexity at the transmitter. The corresponding block diagram of Alamouti’s
STBC-aided transmitter employing a constellation size of Mc symbols is shown in Figure 11.2, where
2 log2 Mc bits of the information source are fed into the constellation mapper in order to generate
the modulated symbols x1 and x2. Instead of using spatial multiplexing to double the throughput in
comparison with its single-antenna-based counterpart, the two-transmit-antenna-aided MS launches
the signals x1 and x2 as well as their conjugates simultaneously from the two antennas during two
successive symbol periods or time slots. To be more speciﬁc, during the ﬁrst symbol period, x1 and x2
are transmitted from antennas Tx1 and Tx2, respectively. Then, in the forthcoming symbol period, −x∗
2
is assigned to antenna Tx1 and x∗
1 is assigned to antenna Tx2, so that correlation is introduced in both
time and spatial domains. Hence, according to the generalized STBC transmission matrix deﬁned in
Equation (11.2), during the two consecutive symbol periods of jT and (j + 1)T the uth MS associated
with the transmitted codeword of Alamouti’s scheme – also known as the G2 STBC scheme – can be

Equivalent STBC Channel Matrix
A key assumption when employing the above G2 scheme is that the channel magnitude and phase are
quasi-static, as deﬁned for h(u)
nm(t) in Section 11.1.1, implying that the FD-CTF observed for the path
between the uth MS’s mth transmit antenna and the nth receive antenna of the BS at time instant t
remains constant during two consecutive symbol periods. Explicitly, in the context of the G2 scheme
we arrive at
h(u)
nm(jT) = h(u)
nm[(j + 1)T],
(11.11)
where m = 1, 2, n = 1, 2, . . . , N and u = 1, 2, . . . , U denote the indices of the transmit antennas
of a speciﬁc MS, of the receive antenna and of the MS, respectively. Furthermore, it is also assumed
throughout this chapter that the FD-CTF h(u)
nm(t) is perfectly known at the receiver. Therefore the noise-
contaminated signals of the uth MS received by the nth antenna at the BS during the jth symbol period
can be expressed as
y(u)
n (jT) =

m=1
h(u)
nm(jT)s(u)
m (jT) + wn(jT),
(11.12)
where Mu is the number of transmit antennas employed by the uth MS. Furthermore, with the aid of
Equation (11.10) and Equation (11.11), we can expand Equation (11.12) to obtain an expression for the
signal of the uth MS received by the nth antenna in two consecutive symbol periods, respectively, as
follows:
y(u)
n (jT) = h(u)
n1 (jT)x(u)

the second symbol period, while ˜w of Equation (11.17) is referred to as the equivalent noise vector,
which is written as
˜wn = [w1,n w∗

(11.21)
where, again, w1,n denotes the AWGN imposed on the nth receive antenna during the ﬁrst symbol
period and w∗
2,n is the conjugate of the AWGN inﬂicted during the second symbol period. The AWGN
encountered during each symbol period has a zero mean and a variance of 2σ2
w.
11.2.1.3
STBC Diversity Combining and Maximum Likelihood Detection
Without loss of generality, let us now consider a G2-assisted SU-MIMO system supporting only the
uth MS with the aid of a single receive antenna at the BS, whose equivalent system model may be
expressed as
˜y = ˜H · x + ˜w

In light of the orthogonality of ˜H(u)

of Equation (11.19), we multiply both sides of Equation (11.24)
by the conjugate transpose of ˜H, yielding

(11.27)
where ˇw = ˜H∗· ˜w has a zero mean and a covariance of (|h1|2 + |h2|2) · I2, while the elements of ˇw
are i.i.d. [588]. The process of obtaining the estimates of the transmitted symbol vector as outlined in

11.2.1. STBCs
363
Equation (11.25) is also referred to as STBC-aided diversity combining. Then the estimated vector ˇy is
forwarded to the ML detector, which uses the detection rule outlined in [588]:
ˆx = arg min
ˇx∈MM
c
∥ˇy −(|h1|2 + |h2|2) · ˇx)∥2,
(11.28)
where Mc is the constellation set of the modulation scheme. Therefore, MM
c
denotes the M-
dimensional legitimate constellation set.
According to Equation (11.27), the x1 and x2 transmitted from the two transmit antennas during
the two successive symbol periods do not interfere with each other’s estimates, which correspond to the
ﬁrst and second elements of ˇy. As a result, the observation enables us to ‘decompose’ the ML detection
rule into two independent low-complexity detection operations for x1 and x2, as follows [585]:
ˆx1 = arg min
ˇx1∈Mc
(|h1|2 + |h2|2 −1)|ˇx1|2 + d2(ˇy1, ˇx1),
(11.29)
ˆx2 = arg min
ˇx2∈Mc
(|h1|2 + |h2|2 −1)|ˇx2|2 + d2(ˇy2, ˇx2),
(11.30)
where d2(x, y) is the squared Euclidean distance between the signal vector x and y. Typically, for
constant modulus modulation schemes, such as BPSK or QPSK, the detection criteria described by
Equation (11.29) and Equation (11.30) can be further simpliﬁed as [585]
ˆx1 = arg min
ˇx1∈Mc
d2(ˇy1, ˇx1),
(11.31)
ˆx2 = arg min
ˇx2∈Mc
d2(ˇy2, ˇx2).
(11.32)
Consequently, the original ML detector’s search space is substantially reduced from MM
c to (M ·Mc),
resulting in a reduced detection complexity, while maintaining the ML performance as well as the
maximum achievable transmit diversity gain.
For multiple-receive-antenna-aided scenarios, i.e. for N ≥2, the same STBC decoding process,
namely that of Equation (11.25), can be invoked for each receive antenna and then the outputs of
the antennas are combined, before passing them through the ML detector. Assuming that there are
N receive antennas, the STBC decoding process is represented as

Then the estimated vector ˇy is fed into the ML detector, which invokes the detection rules described
by Equation (11.31) and Equation (11.32) in order to recover the transmitted symbol, if a constant

Hence, according to Equation (11.35), when employing N receive antennas, a total transmit and receive
diversity associated with the diversity order of M · N = 2N can be achieved by the G2-aided
system without having a transmission rate less than unity in comparison with the single-antenna-aided
multi-user system, since the coding rate of the G2 STBC is unity. Additionally, as observed from
Equation (11.35) for a single-user system, after the STBC decoding operation of Equation (11.33),
there is no Multi-Stream Interference (MSI), as a beneﬁt of the orthogonality of the equivalent channel
matrix ˜H(u)

of Equation (11.19).
11.2.1.4
Other STBCs and Orthogonal Designs
Again, orthogonal STBC designs have recently attracted considerable interests in multiple-antenna-
aided wireless systems, as motivated by the STBC scheme proposed by Alamouti in [585] for a two-
transmit-antenna scenario, which was further generalized for an arbitrary number of transmit antennas
by Tarokh et al. in [586]. In [586], Tarokh et al. also showed that the maximum achievable rate of
OSTBC schemes designed for complex-valued constellations cannot exceed one, i.e. we have R ≤1.
Later it was shown in [589] by Liang and Xia that this rate is in fact always smaller than unity, i.e. we
have R < 1, when the number of transmit antennas exceeds two. Recently, Su and Xia in [587] proved
that the rate cannot exceed 3/4 for more than two transmit antennas.
According to [587], the process of square-shaped orthogonal encoder-matrix design can be carried
out by commencing from G1(x1) = x1I1, and then recursively invoking the OSTBC construction
equation as follows:
G2k(x1, . . . , xk+1) =
	G2k−1(x1, . . . , xk)
−x∗
k+1I2k−1
xk+1I2k−1

2k−1(x1, . . . , xk)

(11.39)
for k = 1, 2, 3, . . ., where (·)∗represents the conjugate of a complex symbol, (·)H denotes the
Hermitian of a complex matrix, and In is a (n × n)-element identity matrix. Again, the rows and
columns respectively represent the spatial and temporal dimensions. Therefore, G2k is an orthogonal
design of (2k × 2k) elements, which determines how to transmit (k + 1) complex modulated symbols,
i.e. x1, x2, . . . , xk+1, from 2k transmit antennas during 2k consecutive symbol periods. Hence, the
resultant symbol rate of G2k is equal to (k + 1)/2k. Considering the OSTBC design contrived for four
transmit antennas for example, where we have k = 2, we arrive at

Orthogonal Design of STBC Using SP Modulation
11.2.2.1
Joint Orthogonal Space–Time Signal Design for Two Antennas Using SP
Conventionally, the orthogonal design of STBCs [585–587] discussed in Section 11.2.1 is based on
conventional PSK/QAM modulated symbols. In other words, the inputs (x1, x2, . . . , xk+1) of the
STBC encoder are chosen independently from the constellation corresponding to a speciﬁc modulation

scheme, then mapped to 2k transmit antennas using for example Equation (11.39), which are then
transmitted during 2k consecutive symbol periods. Therefore, no effort was made by Alamouti’s scheme
to design jointly the input symbols (x1, x2, . . . , xk+1). However, it was shown by Su et al. in [584] that
combining the orthogonal design with SP [583] is capable of attaining extra coding gains by maximizing
the diversity product2 of the STBC signals in the presence of temporally correlated fading channels.
The diversity product expression for the square-shaped OSTBC matrix G2k expressed in the context of
time-correlated fading channels is given by [584]
ζG2k =


i=1
|xi −˜xi|2
1/2
,
(11.41)
where xi and ˜xi are the elements of two distinct space–time signalling matrices C and ˜C, respectively.
From Equation (11.41) we can observe that the diversity product is actually determined by the Minimum
Euclidean Distance (MED) among all the possible ST signal vectors (x1, x2, . . . , xk+1). Thus, the idea
of combining the individual antenna signals into a joint ST design using SP is both straightforward
and desirable, since the SP modulated symbols have the best known MED in the 2(k + 1)-dimensional
real-valued Euclidean space R2(k+1) [583]. Hence the system becomes capable of maximizing the
achievable diversity product of STBC codes, which in turn minimizes the transmission error probability.
Without loss of generality, we consider the G2 scheme again as an simple example, where the
corresponding space–time signalling matrix of Equation (11.10) is rewritten here for convenience:
G2(x1, x2) =
	x1
−x∗

x2

,
(11.42)
where the elements of the input vector (x1, x2) of the STBC encoder are chosen independently from
PSK/QAM modulation constellations conventionally, e.g. BSPK or 4-QAM, as shown in Figure 11.3.
Let us now deﬁne the lattice D4 as an SP having the best MED from all other (L−1) legitimate phasor
points in four-dimensional real-valued Euclidean space R4 [583], which may also be deﬁned as a lattice
that consists of all legitimate SP constellation points having integer coordinates [a1, a2, a3, a4]. These
coordinates uniquely and unambiguously describe the legitimate combinations of the two time slots’
modulated symbols in the G2 scheme, while obeying the SP constraint of
a1 + a2 + a3 + a4 = p,
(11.43)
where p is an even integer [590]. Furthermore, each two-dimensional complex-valued input vector of
the G2 scheme, i.e. (x1, x2), can be represented in the following way:
(x1, x2) = (ℜ{x1} + jℑ{x1}, ℜ{x2} + jℑ{x2}),
(11.44)
where ℜ{·} and ℑ{·} denote the real and imaginary components of a complex number. In other words,
any two-dimensional complex-valued vector, i.e. (x1, x2), in the two-dimensional complex-valued
space C2, can be represented by four real numbers, which as a whole correspond to the coordinates
of a four-dimensional real-valued phasor in the R4 space represented in the following way:
(x1, x2) ⇐⇒(ℜ{x1}, ℑ{x1}, ℜ{x2}, ℑ{x2}).
(11.45)
Hence, the joint design of (x1, x2) in the two-dimensional complex-valued space C2 is readily
transformed into the four-dimensional real-valued Euclidean space R4. Explicitly, the procedure of
joint signal design over two individual transmit antennas is portrayed in Figure 11.4, from which we
can see that with the aid of the above-mentioned SP scheme, the joint ST signal design of the individual
transmit antennas can be achieved by maximizing the coding advantage of G2 by maximizing the

symbol periods, resulting in a coding rate of R = 0.5 in comparison with the conventionally modulated
system, where the coding rate of G2 is unity. For example, if we assume that an L = 16-point SP
(16-SP) scheme is employed, the effective throughput per channel use can be calculated as
Teﬀ= (log2 L) · R = 2 bps,
(11.48)
which is equal to that of the 4-QAM modulated system depicted in Figure 11.3.
11.2.2.2
SP Constellation Construction [583,591]
According to Equation (11.47) describing the G2 codeword construction based on the SP scheme, a
power normalization factor of

2L/Etotal is used. Thus, it is desirable to choose a speciﬁc subset of L
SP constellation points from the entire set of legitimate SP constellation points hosted by D4 based on
the criterion of maintaining the minimum total energy Etotal, while having a certain MED among the
selected SP symbols. However, a potentially excessive computer search has to be carried out to attain
the best subset of the L SP symbols out of all possible choices, when searching for the SP symbols
having the best MED, hence maximizing the coding advantage of the resultant STBC scheme, if there
are more than L SP symbols satisfying the above-mentioned minimum total energy condition.
Furthermore, the lattice D4 can be divided into layers or shells which classify all the legitimate
constellation points into a layer according to their Euclidean distances from the origin, i.e. their
norms or energy. As an example, the ﬁrst 10 SP layers in the D4 SP constellation are provided in
Table 11.1, where we view the four-integer-element phasor of a speciﬁc layer as the basis vector of an
SP constellation and any choice of signs and any ordering of the coordinates are legitimate [583]. To be
more explicit, all legitimate permutations and signs for the corresponding constellation points listed in
Table 11.1 have to be applied in order to generate the full list of SP constellation points for a speciﬁc
layer.
11.2.3
System Model for STBC-SP-Aided MU-MIMO Systems
Let us now construct the generalized system equations for an STBC-aided UL MU-MIMO scenario,
where the SDMA-OFDM system supports a total of U UL users and employs N receive antennas at
the BS. For the sake of simplicity, the G2 scheme using two transmit antennas is employed by each
user. The overall equivalent MU-MIMO system equation can be derived in complete analogy to the
case of STBC-assisted SU-MIMO systems as discussed in Section 11.2.1.2 with the aid of the so-called
equivalent channel matrix. After straightforward manipulations, under the assumption that the CIR taps
between each of the two transmit antennas of a speciﬁc user and the nth receive antenna at the BS

Moreover, as observed in Equation (11.49), the equivalent received noise-contaminated signal vector ˜y

(11.58)
where again w1,n denotes the AWGN imposed on the nth receive antenna during the ﬁrst symbol

2,n is the conjugate of the AWGN inﬂicted during the second symbol period. The AWGN
encountered during each symbol period has a zero mean and a variance of 2σ2
w.
11.3
Sphere Detection Design for SP Modulation
According to our discussions in Section 11.2.1.3, an OSTBC scheme eliminates the MSI among the
MIMO elements of a speciﬁc user, owing to the orthogonality of the equivalent channel matrix ˜H(u)
n
formulated in Equation (11.19). Therefore, the receiver is capable of performing ML detection based
on low-complexity linear processing in order to achieve full transmit diversity by imposing a negligible
extra encoding complexity at the MS in the STBC-SP-assisted SU-MIMO UL scenario considered in
Section 11.2.1.3. However, in the context of an MU-MIMO system, the resultant overall equivalent
channel matrix ˜H of Equation (11.51) is no longer orthogonal, since we have

where I2 denotes a (2 × 2)-element identity matrix and the term MUI refers to the (2 × 2)-

comparison with that of the single-user scenario considered in Section 11.2.1.3, provided that we
still simply apply the detection criterion formulated in Equation (11.37) and Equation (11.38) of

in order separately to carry out signal detection for each user without considering the effects of
MUI produced by the co-channel users. To mitigate the effects of MUI imposed in the multi-user
scenario considered, a successive interference cancellation (SIC) scheme was proposed in [588], which
signiﬁcantly improves the achievable BER performance of the STBC-aided multi-user system. On the
other hand, the powerful near-ML SD techniques of Chapter 9 designed for classic modulation schemes
are also readily applicable to STBC-aided multi-user systems, at a potentially reduced complexity.
Hence, in order to avoid using the traditional brute-force ML detector, we intend to develop further the
K-best SD of Section 9.2.3 to be used at the BS in the STBC-SP-assisted SDMA-OFDM UL scenario,
in order to achieve a near-MAP performance at a moderate complexity.

11.3.2.3
User-Based Tree Search
Let us now recall the tree search carried out by the K-best SD of Section 9.2.3 for conventional
modulation schemes, such as BPSK, where each tree level represents an independent data stream
corresponding to a certain transmit antenna of a speciﬁc user. Each tree node corresponds to a legitimate
BPSK symbol3 in the constellation of domain C1. Consequently, in the absence of joint ST signal
design for the Mu = 2 transmit antennas, the BPSK constellations of the two adjacent tree levels
corresponding to a speciﬁc user are independent and identical. Figure 11.6 shows the search tree of
the K-best SD when it is applied to a four-transmit-antenna scenario, where K is set to two, which
means that a maximum number of two candidates are retained at each level. Consequently, the search
is carried out in the downward direction only along the search tree. The number in brackets indicates
the corresponding PED of the current tree node accumulated from the top level of the tree down to the
current tree node, while the number outside the brackets represents the order in which the tree nodes
are visited. At the (m = 4) level, both the candidates are retained, which results in four candidates at
3In this treatise, we consider complex-valued BPSK symbols having zero imaginary parts.

the (m = 3) level. Then we choose two candidates having the lowest two accumulated PEDs from the
search centre ˆxc, i.e. 0.2 and 0.21, out of four, which again generate four candidates at the (m = 2)
level. The search goes on in a similar way, until it reaches the tree leaf point having the lowest Euclidean
distance of 0.23 from ˆxc. Then the estimated signal vector can be obtained by doing the backtracking,
which is assumed to be the ML solution. However, the K-best SD does not necessarily ﬁnd the ML
solution, unless the value of K is large enough. An extreme example is when K = 1, when the resultant
K-best SD degenerates into the linear LS detector.
On the other hand, when the joint ST signals are transmitted from the Mu = 2 transmit antennas
of the uth user, they are combined into a joint ST design with the aid of the SP scheme as discussed
in Section 11.2.2. The corresponding SP-symbol-based search tree structure is depicted in Figure 11.7,
where the search tree of the modiﬁed K-best SD is exempliﬁed in the context of a UL SDMA system
supporting U = 2 G2-SP-aided users, where K = 2 and a four-point-SP constellation is employed.
Explicitly, the two adjacent tree levels corresponding to the SP symbols of the jointly designed STBC-
SP data streams of a speciﬁc user should be considered together in the tree search process, resulting in
multi-dimensional/multi-layer tree nodes in the C2 SP symbol domain, which we refer to as a user-wise
tree search. The resultant 2D complex-valued tree node consists of two complex-valued BPSK symbols,
which are the constituent components of a transformed SP symbol F4(a). On the other hand, due to the
joint consideration of the two adjacent BPSK tree levels, the number of effective search tree levels is
reduced by a factor of two, while each symbol becomes quaternary, instead of being binary.
As observed in Figure 11.7, since a 4-SP scheme is employed and the number of candidate
tree nodes retained at each tree level is K = 2, each of the two selected tree nodes having the
smallest two accumulated PED values at the previous search tree level of the survivor path has to be
expanded into four child nodes at the current level. Consequently, in analogy to the conventional K-best
algorithm [550], both the calculation of the user-based accumulated PEDs and the tree pruning process
continue in the downward direction of Figure 11.7 all the way along the tree, until they reach the tree leaf
level, producing a candidate list of Lcand ∈AU. This list contains Ncand = K SP symbol candidate
solutions, which are then used for the extrinsic bit LLR calculation using Equation (11.64). Having a
reduced candidate list size assists us in achieving a substantial complexity reduction. Explicitly, after

Simulation Results and Discussion
The schematic of the system is depicted in Figure 11.8, where the transmitted source bits of the uth user
are channel encoded and then interleaved by a random bit interleaver. The B interleaved bits b(u) =
b(u)
0,...,B−1 ∈{0, 1} are mapped to an SP-modulated symbol a(u) ∈A by the SP modulator/mapper
of Figure 11.8, where B = log2 L. The G2 encoder then maps the SP-modulated symbol a(u)
to an ST signal C(u) =

(2L/Etotal)G2(F4(a(u))) ∈CG2 by invoking Equation (11.42) and
Equation (11.46). Finally, the ST signal C(u) is transmitted from the two transmit antennas of the
uth MS during two consecutive time slots.
In Figure 11.8 the interleaver and deinterleaver pair seen at the BS divide the receiver into two parts,
namely the SD (inner decoder) and the channel decoder (outer decoder). Note that in Figure 11.8, LA,
LE and LD denote the a priori, the extrinsic and the a posteriori LLRs, while the subscripts ‘1’ and
‘2’ represent the bit LLRs associated with the inner decoder and the outer decoder, respectively. It was
detailed throughout [314] and [569] that the iterative exchange of extrinsic information between these
serially concatenated receiver blocks results in substantial performance improvements. In this treatise
we assume familiarity with the classic turbo detection principles [314,569].
To investigate the performance of the STBC-SP-assisted multi-user SDMA-OFDM UL system, we
compare the SP-modulated system with its conventionally modulated counterpart in the two scenarios
using the system parameters summarized in Table 11.2. Figures 11.9(a) and 11.9(b) depict, respectively,
the corresponding EXIT charts [592] used as a convenient visualization technique for analysing the
convergence characteristics of turbo receivers. This technique computes the MI of the output extrinsic
and input a priori components, which are denoted by IE and IA respectively, corresponding to the
associated bits for each of the iterative SISO blocks of Figure 11.8, i.e. to the SD and the RSC(2,1,3)
channel decoder. As observed in Figure 11.9, the maximum achievable iterative gains of traditional

QAM-modulated systems employing the conventional K-best SD using Ncand = K = 128 are rather
limited in comparison with our SP-aided K-best SD speciﬁcally designed for SP signals having the
same list size of Ncand = 128. This is because the EXIT curve of the SD using the conventional 4- and
16-QAM-based system has a relatively low IE value at IA = 1, in contrast to the corresponding EXIT
curve of its SP-modulated counterpart. Nonetheless, we also observe from Figure 11.9 that the SD’s
EXIT curve in the QAM-modulated system emerges from a higher starting point at IA = 0 than that of
its SP-modulated counterpart. This leads to a potentially lower BER at relatively low SNRs, where IA
is also low, although the exact detection-convergence behaviour is determined by the SD’s complexity
as well as by the SNR. Observe in Figure 11.9 that in principle the employment of SP modulation is
capable of eliminating the EXIT curve intercept point at a lower SNR, thus leading to an inﬁnitesimally
low BER. However, an open EXIT tunnel can only be formed if the value of K = Ncand as well as that
of the SNR are sufﬁciently high.

Monte Carlo simulations were performed for characterizing the above-mentioned decoding con-
vergence prediction in both Scenario I and Scenario II of Table 11.2. Figures 11.10(a) and 11.10(b)
suggest that the SP-modulated system exhibits a relatively higher BER at low SNRs in both scenarios,
which matches the predictions of the EXIT charts seen in Figure 11.9. On the other hand, as a beneﬁt of
employing the SP modulation, performance gains of 1.5 and 3.5 dB can be achieved by 16-SP- and 256-
SP- modulated systems in Scenario I and Scenario II of Table 11.2, respectively, in comparison with
their identical-throughput QAM-based counterparts, given a target BER of 10−4 and Ncand = 128.
Furthermore, as observed from Figures 11.10(a) and 11.10(b), an attractive compromise can be achieved
between the achievable performance and the complexity imposed by adjusting the list size Ncand
employed by the K-best SD.
11.4
Chapter Conclusions
In comparison with the SDMA-OFDM system models employed in previous chapters, where only a
single transmit antenna is employed by each MS, in this chapter a looser constraint is assumed for the
sake of allowing the employment of multiple antennas at each MS, in order to enhance the system’s
robustness to the hostile wireless fading channel with the aid of transmit diversity gains. Therefore,
the simple but elegant OSTBC scheme, which was initially devised by Alamouti [585] for two-
transmit-antenna-aided transmission, may be employed in the MU-MIMO scenario. As discussed in
Section 11.2.1, the OSTBC scheme is capable of enabling the receiver to perform ML detection based on
low-complexity linear processing, yet achieving the maximum attainable transmit diversity by imposing
a low encoding complexity at the transmitter. Furthermore, in comparison with the conventional
orthogonal design of STBCs based on PSK/QAM modulated symbols, in Section 11.2.2 we proposed
an orthogonal transmit diversity design using SP modulation, which is capable of attaining extra coding
gains by maximizing the diversity product of the STBC signals in the presence of temporally correlated
fading channels.
On the other hand, although the resultant STBC-SP scheme has recently been investigated by
researchers in the context of SU-MIMO systems, existing designs make no attempt to employ it in MU-
MIMO systems owing to its relatively complex detection scheme. More speciﬁcally, despite having no

MSI between the transmit antennas of a speciﬁc user, a signiﬁcant performance loss will be inﬂicted by
the MUI imposed by the co-channel users if we insist on using low-complexity linear detection schemes,
as in the SU-MIMO scenario. Although SIC-based nonlinear detection schemes [593] are capable of
enhancing the achievable performance, these improvements erode if the number of users increases,
especially when the system becomes rank deﬁcient, potentially resulting in an inadequate performance.
Based on this background, we proposed the so-called multi-layer tree search mechanism in order
to render the powerful low-complexity near-ML SD scheme applicable to the STBC-SP-assisted
MU-MIMO system. Consequently, with the aid of our K-best SD, a signiﬁcant performance gain
can be attained by the SP-modulated system over its conventionally modulated identical-throughput
counterpart in MU-MIMO scenarios. For example, a performance gain of 3.5 dB was achieved in
Figure 11.10 over a 16-QAM benchmark by the 256-SP scheme in the scenario of a four-receive-
antenna SDMA UL system supporting U = 2 G2-assisted users, given a target BER of 10−4.

Introduction1
Multiple-antenna-aided transmit diversity arrangements [594] constitute powerful techniques of miti-
gating the deleterious effects of fading, hence improving the end-to-end system performance, which
is usually achieved by multiple co-located antenna elements at the transmitter and/or receiver, as
discussed in Chapter 11. However, in cellular communication systems, it is often impractical for the
mobile to employ several antennas for the sake of achieving a diversity gain owing to its limited
size. Furthermore, owing to the limited separation of the antenna elements, they rarely experience
independent fading, which limits the achievable diversity gain and may be further compromised by
the detrimental effects of the shadow fading, imposing further signal correlation among the antennas
in their vicinity. Fortunately, as depicted in Figure 12.1, in multi-user wireless systems mobiles may
cooperatively share their antennas in order to achieve uplink transmit diversity by forming a Virtual
Antenna Array (VAA) in a distributed fashion. Thus, so-called cooperative diversity relying on the
cooperation among multiple terminals may be achieved [595,596].
On the other hand, in order to carry out classic coherent detection, channel estimation is required at
the receiver, which relies on using training pilot signals or tones and exploits the fact that in general the
consecutive CIR taps are correlated in both the time and frequency domains of the OFDM subchannels.
However, channel estimation for an M-transmitter, N-receiver MIMO system requires the estimation
of (M × N) CIRs, which imposes both an excessive complexity and a high pilot overhead, especially
in mobile environments associated with relatively rapidly ﬂuctuating channel conditions. Therefore, in
such situations, differential encoded transmissions combined with non-coherent detection and hence
requiring no CSI at the receiver become an attractive design alternative, leading to differential-
modulation-assisted cooperative communications [596]. Three different channel models corresponding

y[n] = h[n −1]s[n −1]v[n] + w[n]

(12.5)
where w[n−1] and w[n] denote the AWGN with a variance of 2σ2
w added at the receiver during the two
consecutive time slots. Consequently, the differentially encoded data v[n] can be recovered in the same
manner as in the conventional coherent detection scheme in a single-input, single-output context by
using y[n−1] as the reference signal of the differential detector. This is achieved without any CSI at the
expense of a 3 dB performance loss in comparison with its coherent counterpart caused by the doubled
noise w′[n] at the decision device, which has a variance of 4σ2
w. This can be veriﬁed by the BER curves
of the single-antenna-aided OFDM system characterized in Figure 12.2 for two different throughputs,
i.e. for 1 bits per symbol and for 2 bits per symbol, respectively. The other system parameters are
summarized in Table 12.2.

Effects of Time-Selective Channels on Differential Detection
Apart from the 3 dB performance loss suffered by Conventional Differential Detection (CDD) in slow-
fading scenarios as discussed in Section 12.1.1, an error ﬂoor may be encountered by the CDD in fast-
fading channels, if DPSK modulation is carried out in the time direction, i.e. for the same subcarrier of
consecutive OFDM symbols, since the fading channel is deemed to be more correlated between the same
subcarrier of consecutive OFDM symbols than between adjacent subcarriers of a given OFDM symbol.
In other words, the assumption that h[n −1] = h[n] no longer holds, leading to unrecoverable phase
information between consecutive transmitted DPSK symbols even in the absence of noise. Furthermore,
all the channel models considered in Table 12.1 exhibit temporally Rayleigh-distributed fading for each
of the D subcarriers employed by the OFDM system with the autocorrelation function expressed as
ϕt
hh[κ] ≜E{h[n + κ]h∗[n]}
(12.6)
= J0(2πfdκ),
(12.7)
where J0(·) denotes the zeroth-order Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind and fd is the normalized Doppler
frequency.
Figure 12.3(a) depicts the magnitude of the temporal correlation function for various normalized
Doppler frequencies fd, while Figure 12.3(b) plots the corresponding BER curves of the DQPSK-
modulated CDD-aided OFDM system with the system parameter summarized in Table 12.2. Given
a Doppler frequency of fd = 0.001, the BER curves decrease continuously as the SNR increases.
However, the BER curve tends to create an error ﬂoor when fd becomes high, which is caused by the
relative mobility between the transmitter and the receiver. For example, with a relatively high Doppler
frequency of fd = 0.03, the magnitude of the temporal correlation function of the typical urban channel
model of Table 12.1 decreases rapidly as κ increases. Therefore, the CDD, which is capable of achieving
a desirable performance in slow-fading channels, suffers from a considerable performance loss when
the transmit terminal is moving at a high speed relative to the receiver.
12.1.1.3
Effects of Frequency-Selective Channels on Differential Detection
Our discussions in Section 12.1.1.2 were focused on the CDD employing differentially encoded
modulation along the Time Domain (TD) – which is referred to here as T-DQPSK modulation – for
each of the D subcarriers of an OFDM system. In general, the time- and frequency-domain differential
encoding have their own merits. Speciﬁcally, the T-DQPSK-modulated OFDM system is advantageous
for employment in continuous transmissions, because the effective throughput remains high, since
the overhead constituted by the reference symbol s[0] tends to zero in conjunction with a relatively
large transmission block/frame size, namely with an increasing transmission frame duration. However,
T-DQPSK-aided OFDM is less suitable for burst transmission, when the consecutive OFDM symbols
may experience fairly uncorrelated fading. Hence, employment of frequency-domain differentially
encoded modulation – which is referred to here as F-DPSK – is preferable for the above-mentioned
scenario. Before investigating the impact of the channel’s frequency selectivity for the channel models

Accordingly, Figure 12.4(a) depicts the magnitude of the FD autocorrelation function for the three
different channel models of Table 12.1, namely the TU, RA and HT channel models, assuming that we
have D = 1024 and ∆f = 10 kHz. Note that the OFDM symbol duration is
Tf = DTs + Tg,
(12.10)
where Ts = 1/(∆fD) is the OFDM symbol duration and Tg denotes the guard interval. We observe
that the magnitude of the spectral correlation of the RA channel model decreases slowly as µ increases,
since the maximum path delay τmax is as small as 6Ts. Thus, a moderately frequency-selective channel
is expected, resulting in a gracefully decreasing BER curve, as observed in Figure 12.4(b), where the
BER curves corresponding to the TU and HT channel models were also plotted. The latter two BER
curves exhibit an error ﬂoor as the SNR increases, especially the one corresponding to the HT scenario.
This is not unexpected, since we observe a sharp decay in |ϕf
hh[µ]| during the interval (µ = 0, 1, . . . , 4)
and a ‘strong non-concave’ behaviour for |ϕf
hh[µ]|, as seen in Figure 12.4(a). This is caused by the large
maximum path delay of τmax = 172Ts.

diversity gains achieved by the cooperative system may erode as the relative mobile velocities of the
cooperating users with respect to both each other and the BS increase. The detrimental effects of
highly time-selective channels imposed on the T-DQPSK-modulated scenario were characterized in
Figure 12.3(b), while those of heavily frequency-selective channels on the F-DPSK-modulated system
were quantiﬁed in Figure 12.4(b). In order to eliminate this performance erosion and still achieve full
cooperative diversity in conjunction with differential detection in wideband OFDM-based cooperative
systems, in Section 12.2 we will invoke the Multiple-Symbol Differential Sphere Detection (MSDSD)
technique, which was proposed by Lutz et al. in [597] in order to cope with fast-fading channels in SISO
narrowband scenarios. We will demonstrate in Section 12.3 that, although a simple MSDSD scheme
may be implemented at the relay, more powerful detection schemes are required at the BS of both
the DAF- and DDF-aided cooperative systems in order to achieve a desirable end-to-end performance.
Hence, the novel contributions of this chapter are as follows:
• A generalized equivalent multiple-symbol-based system model is constructed for the differen-
tially encoded cooperative system using either the Differential Amplify-and-Forward (DAF)
or Differential Decode-and-Forward (DDF) scheme.
• With the aid of the multi-layer search tree mechanism proposed for the SD in Chapter 11 in the
context of the SP-modulated MIMO system, the MSDSD is speciﬁcally designed for both the
DAF- and DDF-aided cooperative systems based on the above-mentioned generalized equivalent
multiple-symbol system model. Our design objective is to retain the maximum achievable
diversity gains at high mobile velocities, e.g. when T-DQPSK is employed, while imposing a
low complexity.
The remainder of this chapter is organized as follows. The principle of the single-path MSDSD,
which was proposed for employment in SISO systems, is reviewed in Section 12.2, where we will
demonstrate that the MSDSD is capable of signiﬁcantly mitigating the channel-induced error ﬂoor for
both T-DQPSK- and F-DPSK-modulated OFDM systems, provided that the second-order statistics of
the fading and noise are known at the receiver. Given the duality of the time and frequency dimensions,
we will only consider the T-DQPSK-modulated system in Section 12.3, where we focus our attention
on the multi-path MSDSD design, which is detailed for both the DAF- and DDF-aided cooperative
cellular UL. The construction of the generalized equivalent multiple-symbol cooperative system model

is detailed in Section 12.3.3.1. Finally, we provide our concluding remarks in Section 12.4 based on the
simulation results of Section 12.3.4.
12.2
The Principle of Single-Path MSDSD [597]
Differential detection schemes may be broadly divided into two categories, namely CDD and Multiple-
Symbol Differential Detection (MSDD), as seen in Figure 12.5. Since a data symbol is mapped
to the phase difference between the successive transmitted PSK symbols, CDD estimates the data
symbol by directly calculating the phase difference of the two successive received symbols. In contrast
to CDD having an observation window size of Nwind
= 2, the MSDD collects Nwind
> 2
consecutively received symbols for joint detection of the (Nwind −1) data symbols. This family
may be further divided into two subgroups, namely the optimum maximum-likelihood (ML)-MSDD
and suboptimum MSDD schemes, as seen in Figure 12.5. The ML-MSDD is the optimum scheme in
terms of performance, but it exhibits a potentially excessive computational complexity in conjunction
with a large observation window size Nwind. One of the suboptimum approaches that may be
employed to achieve a low-complexity near-ML-MSDD is the linear-prediction-based Decision-
Feedback Differential Detection (DFDD). Recently, the SD algorithm [556] was also used to resolve the
complexity problem imposed by the ML-MSDD without sacriﬁcing the achievable performance [597–
600], leading to the so-called MSDSD arrangement, which will be introduced in the forthcoming
sections.
12.2.1
ML Metric for MSDD
The basic idea behind ML-MSDD is the exploitation of the correlation between the phase distortions
experienced by the consecutive Nwind transmitted DPSK symbols [601]. In other words, the receiver
makes a decision about a block of (Nwind −1) consecutive symbols based on Nwind received symbols,
enabling the detector to exploit the statistics of the fading channels. Ideally, the error ﬂoor encountered
when performing CDD as observed in Figure 12.3 and Figure 12.4 can be essentially eliminated,
provided that the value of Nwind is sufﬁciently high.
More explicitly, the MSDD at the receiver jointly processes the ith received symbol vector
consisting of Nwind consecutively received symbols
y[iNwind ] ≜[y[(Nwind −1)i −(Nwind −1)], . . . , y[(Nwind −1)i]]T ,
(12.11)

386
Chapter 12. Multiple-Symbol Differential Sphere Detection
where iNwind is the symbol vector index, in order to generate the ML estimate vector ˆs[iNwind ] of the
corresponding Nwind transmitted symbols
s[iNwind ] ≜[s[(Nwind −1)i −(Nwind −1)], . . . , s[(Nwind −1)i]]T .
(12.12)
Then, when using differential decoding by carrying out the inverse of the differential encoding process
of Equation (12.1), the estimated vector ˆv[iNwind ] of the corresponding (Nwind −1) differentially
encoded data symbols
v[iNwind ] ≜[v[(Nwind −1)i −(Nwind −2)], . . . , v[(Nwind −1)i]]T
(12.13)
can be attained. Note that, due to differential encoding, consecutive blocks y[iNwind ] overlap by one
scalar received symbol [602]. For the sake of representational simplicity, we omit the symbol block
index iNwind without any loss of generality.
Under the assumption that the fading is a complex-valued zero-mean Gaussian process with
a variance of σ2
h and that the channel noise has a variance of 2σ2
w, the PDF of the received
symbol vector y = [y0, y1, . . . , yNwind −1]T conditioned on the transmitted symbol vector s =
[s0, s1, . . . , sNwind −1]T spanning Nwind symbol periods is expressed as [597]
p(y|s) = exp(−Tr{yHΨ−1y})
(πNwind detΨ)
,
(12.14)
where
Ψ = E{yyH|s}
(12.15)
denotes the conditional autocorrelation matrix of the Rayleigh fading channel. Then, the ML solution
which maximizes the probability of Equation (12.14) can be obtained by exhaustively searching the
entire transmitted symbol vector space. Thus, the ML metric of the MSDD can be expressed as [602]
ˆsML = arg max
ˇs∈MNwind
c
p(y|ˇs)
(12.16)
= arg min
ˇs∈MNwind
c
Tr{yHΨ−1y}.
(12.17)
12.2.2
Metric Transformation
In order to elaborate further on the ML metric of Equation (12.16), we extended the conditional
autocorrelation matrix Ψ as [597]:
Ψ = E{yyH|s},
(12.18)
= diag(s)E{hhH}diag(sH) + E{nnH},
(12.19)
= diag(s)(E{hhH} + 2σ2
wINwind )diag(sH),
(12.20)
= diag(s) C diag(sH),
(12.21)
where E{hhH} is the channel’s covariance matrix in either the time or the frequency domain, which
is determined by the speciﬁc domain of the differential encoding. More explicitly, the elements of
the covariance matrix E{hhH} can be computed by Equation (12.7), when differential encoding at
the transmitter is carried out along the TD. Otherwise, we employ Equation (12.9) to obtain the
covariance matrix, when differential encoding is employed in the FD. Furthermore, in the context of
Equation (12.21) we deﬁne
C ≜(E{hhH} + 2σ2
wINwind )
(12.22)
in order to simplify Equation (12.20).

12.2.3. Complexity Reduction Using SD
387
Since we have diag(s)−1 = diag(s)H = diag(s∗), the ML decision rule of Equation (12.17) can
be reformulated as
ˆsML = arg min
s∈MNwind
c
{yHΨ−1y}
(12.23)
= arg min
s∈MNwind
c
{yHdiag(s) C−1 diag(s)Hy}
(12.24)
= arg min
s∈MNwind
c
{s diag(y)HC−1diag(y)s∗}
(12.25)
= arg min
s∈MNwind
c
{s diag(y)HFHF diag(y)s∗},
(12.26)
where F is an upper-triangular matrix obtained using the Cholesky factorization of the inverse matrix
C−1, i.e. we have
C−1 = FHF.
(12.27)
Then, by further deﬁning an upper-triangular matrix as
U ≜(F diag(y))∗,
(12.28)
we ﬁnally arrive at [597]
ˆsML = arg min
s∈MNwind
c
{∥Us∥2},
(12.29)
which completes the process of transforming the ML-MSDD metric of Equation (12.17) to a shortest-
vector problem [597].
12.2.3
Complexity Reduction Using SD
While the performance of the MSDD improves steadily as Nwind is increased, the drawback is its
potentially excessive computational complexity, which increases exponentially with Nwind. On the
other hand, SD algorithms [556,560,603] are well known for their efﬁciency when solving the so-called
shortest-vector problem in the context of multi-user, multi-stream detection in MIMO systems. Thus,
due to the upper-triangular structure of the U matrix, the traditional SD algorithm can be employed to
solve the shortest-vector problem as indicated by Equation (12.29). Consequently, the ML solution of
the ML-MSDD metric of Equation (12.17) can be obtained on a component-by-component basis at a
signiﬁcantly lower complexity. Note that all the SD algorithms discussed in Chapter 9 can be employed
to solve the shortest-vector problem of Equation (12.29).
12.2.4
Simulation Results
Monte Carlo simulations are provided in this section in order to characterize the achievable performance
and the complexity imposed by the MSDSD for both TD and FD differentially encoded OFDM systems.
The simulation parameters are summarized in Table 12.3.
12.2.4.1
Time-Differential-Encoded OFDM System
Let us now consider the application of the MSDSD in the TD differentially encoded OFDM system
for three different normalized Doppler frequencies in the presence of the typical urban channel given
by Table 12.1. The T-DQPSK modulation scheme is employed at the transmitter, while the MSDSD
employing three different observation window sizes Nwind is used at the receiver, namely Nwind =
2, 6, 9. Note that, as mentioned in Section 12.1.1, when we have Nwind = 2 the MSDSD actually
degenerates to the CDD. Additionally, since T-DQPSK is employed, a relatively short transmission
frame length of 101 OFDM symbols is utilized in order to reduce the detection delay imposed by

the MSDSD. Figure 12.6(a) depicts the BER performance of the MSDSD for normalized Doppler
frequencies fd = 0.03, 0.01, 0.001, where we observe that for the slow-fading channel associated with
fd = 0.001, there is no need to employ an observation window size of more than Nwind = 2, since the
CDD does not suffer from an error ﬂoor. In other words, the MSDSD is unable to improve the CDD’s
performance further by increasing Nwind. However, when the channel becomes more uncorrelated,
i.e. when we have fd = 0.03 or 0.01, the BER curve is shifted downwards by employing an Nwind
value larger than 2, approaching that observed for fd = 0.001, at the expense of imposing a higher
computational complexity. The complexity imposed by the MSDSD versus the SNR is plotted in
Figure 12.6(b), where the complexity curves corresponding to Nwind = 9 are evidently above those
corresponding to Nwind = 6. Moreover, the complexity imposed by the MSDSD decreases steadily as
the SNR increases and ﬁnally levels out in the high-SNR range. This is not unexpected, since under the
assumption of having a reduced noise contamination, it is more likely that the ML solution point ˆsML
is located near the search centre (the origin in this case) of the SD used for ﬁnding the MSDD solution.
As a result, the SD’s search process may converge much more rapidly, imposing a reduced complexity.
Again, for more details about the characteristics of SDs, refer to Chapter 9. Furthermore, we can also
observe from Figure 12.6(b) that the Doppler frequency has a crucial effect not only on the performance
achieved by the MSDSD, but also on its complexity.

Chapter 12. Multiple-Symbol Differential Sphere Detection
Given a Doppler frequency of fd = 0.01, let us now investigate the complexity of the MSDSD
from a different angle by plotting the complexity versus Nwind in Figure 12.7, where complexity curves
are drawn for two different SNRs. Although both of the curves exhibit an increase upon increasing the
value of Nwind, the one corresponding to the relatively low SNR of 10 dB rises more sharply than the
other one recorded for an SNR of 35 dB.
12.2.4.2
Frequency-Differential-Encoded OFDM System
As discussed in Section 12.1.1.3 for the scenario of burst transmissions or detection-delay-sensitive
communications, F-DPSK is preferable to its TD counterpart. However, the channels experienced by the
OFDM modem may exhibit a moderate time but a signiﬁcant frequency selectivity, as exempliﬁed by the
TU and HT channel models given in Table 12.1. Therefore, the BER curves corresponding to the TU and
HT channel models exhibit an error ﬂoor when using the CDD associated with Nwind = 2, as observed
in Figure 12.8, due to the channel’s frequency selectivity. Other simulation parameters are summarized
in Table 12.3. Similar to the results obtained in the T-DPSK scenario, the error ﬂoor can be eliminated
with the aid of the MSDSD, where the observation window size was Nwind = 6. Remarkably, a
signiﬁcant performance improvement is achieved by the MSDSD for the severely frequency-selective
HT environment as seen in Figure 12.8. The BER curve associated with the CDD levels out as soon as
the SNR increases beyond 20 dB, while the MSDSD using Nwind = 6 completely removes the error
ﬂoor, resulting in a steadily decreasing BER curve as the SNR increases.
12.3
Multi-path MSDSD Design for Cooperative
Communication
12.3.1
System Model
After the brief review on the principle of the MSDSD designed for single-path channels in Section 12.2,
we continue by speciﬁcally designing an MSDSD scheme for the cooperative system discussed in
Section 12.1. As depicted in Figure 12.9, we consider a U-user cooperation-aided system, where
signal transmission involves two transmission phases, namely the broadcast phase and the relay phase,
which are also referred to as phase I and II. A user who directly sends his/her own information to the
destination is regarded as a source node, while the other users who assist in forwarding the information
received from the source node are considered as relay nodes. In both phases, any of the well-established
multiple-access schemes can be employed by the users to guarantee an orthogonal transmission among
them, such as Time-Division Multiple Access (TDMA), Frequency-Division Multiple Access (FDMA)
or Code-Division Multiple Access (CDMA). In this discussion, TDMA is considered for the sake
of simplicity. Furthermore, due to the symmetry of channel allocation among users, as indicated in
Figure 12.9, we focus our attention on the information transmission of source terminal TS seen in
Figure 12.10, which potentially employs (U −1) relay terminals TR1, TR2, . . . , TRU−1 in order to
achieve cooperative diversity by forming a VAA. Without loss of generality, we simply assume the
employment of a single antenna for each of the collaborating MSs and that of N receive antennas for
the BS. Additionally, a unitary total power P shared by the collaborating MSs for transmitting a symbol
is assumed.
Owing to the potential transmission inefﬁciency and implementational difﬁculty imposed by
the channel estimation in cooperation-aided systems, differential encoding and detection without
acquisition of the CSI is preferable to the employment of substantially more complex coherent
transmission techniques, as we discussed in Section 12.1. Hence, we assume that in phase I, the
source broadcasts its differentially encoded signals, while the destination as well as the relay terminals
are also capable of receiving the signal transmitted by the source. In the forthcoming phase II, we
consider two possible cooperation protocols which can be employed by the relay nodes: the relay
node may either directly forward the received signal to the destination after signal ampliﬁcation

(the Amplify-and-Forward (AF) scheme) or differentially decode and re-encode the received signal
before its retransmission (the Decode-and-Forward (DF) scheme).
Recall from Section 12.1.1.1 that the information is conveyed in the difference of the phases
of two consecutive PSK symbols for differentially encoded transmission. In the context of the user
cooperation-aided system of Figure 12.10, the source terminal TS broadcasts the lth differentially
encoded frame sl during phase I, which consists of Lf DMPSK symbols s[n] (n = 1, 2, . . . , Lf)
given by Equation (12.1). According to Equation (12.1), the differential encoding process of the source
node may be expressed as
ss[n] = ss[n −1]vs[n],
(12.30)
where vsd[n] ∈Mc = {ej2πm/Mc; m = 0, 1, . . . , Mc −1} is the information symbol obtained after
bit-to-symbol mapping, and ssd[n] ∈Mc = {ej2πm/Mc; m = 0, 1, . . . , Mc −1} represents the
differentially encoded symbols during the nth time slot. We assume a total power of unity, i.e. P = 1,
for transmitting a DMPSK symbol of the source over the entire user cooperation period and introduce
the broadcast transmit power ratio η which is equal to the transmit power Ps employed by the source.
Hence, during the forthcoming phase II, the total power consumed by all the (U −1) relay nodes
used for transmitting the signal received from the source is U−1
u=1 Pru = 1 −η, where Pru is the
power consumed by the relay terminal TRu for conveying the signal of the source node. To mitigate
the impairments imposed by the time-selective channels on the T-DPSK-modulated transmission,

frame-based rather than symbol-based user cooperation is carried out, which is achieved at the expense
of both a higher detection delay and increased memory requirements.
Furthermore, according to the cooperative strategy of Figure 12.9, where each of the (U −1)
spatially dispersed relay nodes helps forward the signal from the source node to the destination node
in (U −1) successive time slots, we construct a single-symbol system model for the source node’s nth
transmit symbol in the context of the TDMA-based user-cooperation-aided system of Figure 12.10 as
Yn = PSnHn + Wn,
(12.31)
where the diagonal matrix P is introduced to describe the transmit power allocation among the
collaborating MSs and is deﬁned as
P ≜diag([

(12.32)
Additionally, in Equation (12.31) Sn and Yn represent the transmitted user-cooperation-based signal
matrix and the received signal matrix at the destination, respectively, during both phase I and phase II.
Additionally, Hn and Wn denote the channel matrix and the AWGN matrix, respectively. Upon further
elaborating of Equation (12.31), we get

where the rows and columns of the transmitted user-cooperation-based signal matrix Sn denote the

are assumed to be far apart, the elements of the channel matrix Hn, corresponding to the CIRs between

12.3.2
Differentially Encoded Cooperative Communication Using CDD
In this section, for the sake of simplicity, we consider two differential-modulation-based two-user
cooperative schemes, namely, the DAF and DDF. Both these schemes are amenable to the CDD in
fading channels after a linear signal combination process, which will be discussed in our forthcoming
discourse.
12.3.2.1
Signal Combining at the Destination for DAF Relaying
For the DAF scheme, the (U −1) relay nodes of Figure 12.10 amplify the signal received from the
source node and forward it to the destination node in a preset order over (U −1) successive time slots
during phase II. In order to ensure that the average transmit power of the uth relay node remains Pru,
the corresponding ampliﬁcation factor fAM ru in Equation (12.34) employed by the uth relay node can
be speciﬁed as [604]
fAM ru =
"
Pru
Psσ2sru + N0 ,
(12.38)
where σ2
sru is the variance of the channel’s envelope spanning between the source and the uth relay
node, which can be obtained by long-term averaging of the received signals. Therefore, the signal
received at the destination from the uth relay node yrud[n+uLf] in Equation (12.33) can be represented
as follows [604]:
yrud[n + uLf] = fAM ru ysru[n]hrud[n + uLf] + wrud[n + uLf],
(12.39)
where ysru[n] is the signal received from the source node at the uth relay node during the broadcast
phase I, which was given by Equation (12.35).

394
Chapter 12. Multiple-Symbol Differential Sphere Detection
The destination BS linearly combines the signal at each of the N receive antennas received from the
source through the direct link during the broadcast, namely phase I and those at each receive antenna
received from all the relay nodes during phase II, followed by the CDD process operating without
acquiring any CSI. Based on the multi-channel differential detection principle of [467], we combine the
multi-path signal of the U-user cooperation system of Figure 12.10 prior to the CDD process as
y =
N

i=1
	
a0(ysdi[n −1])∗ysdi[n] +
U−1

u=1
au(yrudi[n + uLf −1])∗yrudi[n + uLf]

,
(12.40)
where Lf is the length of the frame, while the coefﬁcients a0 and au (u = 1, 2, . . .) are respectively
given by
a0 =
1
N0 ,
(12.41)
au =
Psσ2
sru + N0
N0(Psσ2sru + Pruσ2
rud + N0),
(12.42)
where σ2
sru and σ2
rud are the variances of the link between the source and relay nodes as well as of the
link between the relay node and the BS, respectively. By assuming that the CIRs hsru as well as hrud
are almost constant over two successive symbol periods, the destination node carries out the CDD based
on the combined signal y of Equation (12.40) as
ej2π ˆ
m/Mc =
arg max
ˇ
m=0,1,...,Mc−1
ℜ{e−j2π ˇ
m/Mcy},
(12.43)
where ℜ{·} denotes the real component of a complex number.
12.3.2.2
Signal Combining at Destination for DDF Relaying
For the DDF-aided U-user cooperation system of Figure 12.10, each relay node differentially decodes
and re-encodes the signal received from the source node, before forwarding it to the BS. Similarly,
based on the multi-channel differential detection techniques of [467, 605], the combined signal prior
to differential detection by the DDF scheme can be expressed in exactly the same form as that of
Equation (12.40) for the DAF scheme, which is repeated here for convenience:
y =
N

i=1
	
a0(ysdi[n −1])∗ysdi[n] +
U−1

u=1
au(yrudi[n + uLf −1])∗yrudi[n + uLf]

,
(12.44)
noting that different diversity combining weights of a0 and au (u = 1, 2, . . . , U −1) are used. Note
also that the choice of diversity combining weights may affect the achievable system performance. For
example, when the normalized total power of P = 1 used for transmitting a symbol during the entire
user-cooperation-aided process is equally divided among the source and relay nodes, i.e. when we have
Ps = Pru = 1/U (u = 1, 2, . . . , U −1), the SNR of the combiner output is maximized by opting
for [605]
a0 = au =
1
N0 ,
(12.45)
provided that the corresponding channel variances are identical. Although the choice of the diversity
combining weights is not optimal in general, it is optimal for the case when the SNR of the source–
destination link and those of the multiple relay–destination links are the same. Again, by assuming that
the CIRs taps hsru as well as hrud are constant during two successive symbol periods, the CDD process
of Equation (12.43) can be carried out by the destination after combining the multi-path signals.

12.3.2.3
Simulation Results
Figure 12.11 depicts the BER performance versus P/N0 for both the single-user non-cooperative
system and the two-user DAF-aided cooperative system, using the simulation parameters summarized
in Table 12.4. Note that we consider a scenario where the total power P used for transmitting a
differentially encoded symbol during an entire user cooperation process is equally shared between
the source and relay nodes, and the SNRs at the receiver of the relay and destination nodes are
identical. Additionally, in order to carry out a fair comparison between the non-cooperative and
cooperative systems, we assume that the power consumed by the single-user non-cooperative system
when transmitting a single T-DQPSK symbol is also equal to P = 1, which is identical to that consumed
by its user-cooperation-aided counterpart. As observed from Figure 12.11, in the presence of the slowly
fading TU channel of Table 12.1 associated with fd = 0.001, the DDF-aided two-user cooperative
system is capable of achieving the maximum attainable spatial diversity order of two, resulting in a
signiﬁcant performance gain of 10 dB, given a target BER of 10−4. This high gain is not unexpected,
since it is unlikely that both the direct and relay links suffer from a deep fade. However, since the
T-DQPSK modulation scheme is employed, the performance achieved by the CDD at the destination
node degrades signiﬁcantly as the normalized Doppler frequency fd becomes higher. This is due to,
for example, the relative mobility of the source and relay nodes with respect to the BS. For the sake
of simplicity, here we assume the same normalized Doppler frequency exhibited by all the three links
of the two-user cooperative system, namely the source–relay, relay–destination and source–destination
links. As shown in Figure 12.11, an error ﬂoor is formed by the BER curves corresponding to the
more time-selective scenarios associated with an increased normalized Doppler frequency fd ranging
from 0.001 to 0.03, which is an undesirable situation encountered also by the classic single-user non-
cooperative benchmark system. However, the lowest achievable end-to-end BER of 10−3 exhibited by
the CDD operating with the aid of the DAF-aided cooperation scheme is still lower than the BER of
10−2 achieved by the non-cooperative system under the assumption of fd = 0.03.

In comparison with the DAF-aided cooperative system, where the relay node directly forwards the
ampliﬁed signal to the destination, the differential decoding and re-encoding of the DDF-aided system
are carried out by the relay node before forwarding, as discussed in Section 12.3.2.2. The simulation
parameters are summarized in Table 12.4, where we can see that a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)
code is employed by the relay node in order to determine whether the current decoded signal is correct or
not and only the error-free decoded signal is forwarded to the destination. Otherwise, the relay remains
silent during phase II. Figure 12.12 plots the BER curves of the DDF-aided two-user cooperative system
using the CDD at both the relay and destination nodes in contrast to those of its non-cooperative
counterpart. Again, the DDF-aided cooperative scheme is capable of achieving the maximum attainable
diversity order of two, leading to a signiﬁcant performance gain for transmission over a slow-fading
channel associated with fd = 0.001. Furthermore, observe by comparing Figure 12.12 that a similarly
negative impact is imposed on the end-to-end BER performance by the relative mobility of the source,
relay and destination nodes for the DDF scheme as that imposed for the DAF scheme. Moreover, also
note in Figure 12.12 that although the DDF-aided cooperative system outperforms its non-cooperative
counterpart at the three different values of the normalized Doppler frequency considered, the achievable
performance gain becomes more negligible as fd increases. Speciﬁcally, only a slightly lower error ﬂoor
is exhibited in Figure 12.12 by the DDF-aided system associated with fd = 0.03 than that presented by
the classic single-user non-cooperative arrangement. In addition, as observed from both Figure 12.11
and Figure 12.12, both the DAF- and DDF-aided cooperative systems exhibit a worse BER performance
than the classic non-cooperative one in the relatively low-SNR range spanning from 0 to 15 dB, which
can also be observed for the co-located multiple-transmit-antenna-assisted system. This trend is not
unexpected, since the effective SNR experienced at the receiver is halved for the two-transmit-antenna-
aided system, and the beneﬁt of diversity is overwhelmed by the deleterious effects of the noise when
the SNR is low.
Let us now investigate the beneﬁt of the CRC-based error-detection capability of the relay node on
the end-to-end BER performance of a DDF-aided two-user cooperative system in Figure 12.13, where
the BER curves corresponding to different CRC codes are plotted in contrast to those of the so-called
ﬁxed-relay-based cooperative system as well as to that of the single-user non-cooperative one. Note that,
as summarized in Table 12.4, the frame length Lf employed is 101 DQPSK symbols, whereas CCITT-
6 was used by the relay node similarly to the previously simulated DDF-aided cooperative system
of Figure 12.12, which exhibits a desirable error-detection capability for this relatively short frame
length, since a full diversity order of two can be achieved. To improve the achievable transmission
efﬁciency, a CRC code using as few parity bits as possible is preferable, such as CCITT-4. However,

as observed in Figure 12.13, the achievable BER performance of the DDF-aided cooperative system
gradually degrades as the SNR increases, leading to an approximately 4 dB performance gain reduction
at a target BER of 10−5 in comparison with the system employing the CCITT-6. Another extreme
example worth considering is a ﬁxed-relay-based cooperative system, where the relay forwards the
re-encoded differential signal to the destination without checking whether the differentially decoded
bits are correct or not. Hence, the achievable transmission efﬁciency is improved by sacriﬁcing the
maximum achievable diversity gain. Speciﬁcally, without the aid of the CRC, no spatial diversity gain
can be achieved, although an additional transmit antenna provided by the relay node further assists the
source by forwarding the signal to the BS. The reason for this trend is that without CRC checking the
original diversity gain is eroded by the ﬂawed information delivered by the relay node, which is further
combined with the signal received via the direct link at the destination. Hence, a ﬂexible compromise
between maintaining a high transmission efﬁciency and the maximum achievable diversity gain can be
struck by employing an appropriate CRC code.
In comparison with the classic co-located multiple-transmit-antenna-assisted system, the perfor-
mance of the user-cooperation-aided system is affected both by the channel quality of the source–
destination and relay–destination links and by that of the source–relay link. This statement is true
for both the DAF- and DDF-aided cooperative systems as evidenced by our forthcoming discussions.
Figure 12.14 compares the BER performance achieved by the two-user cooperative system employing
either the DAF or the DDF scheme in two different scenarios, namely for a noisy source–relay link,
as assumed in the scenarios characterized in Figures 12.12 and 12.13, and for a perfect noise-free
source–relay link. In other words, the relay is assumed to have perfect knowledge of the source node’s
transmitted signal in the latter scenario, which can also be regarded as the conventional co-located
multiple-transmit-antenna-aided system, if the DDF scheme is employed. Additionally, recall from
Figures 12.11 and 12.12 that the maximum diversity order of two can indeed be achieved by the
T-DQPSK-modulated two-user cooperative system using the CDD when a quasi-static scenario of a

normalized Doppler frequency fd = 0.001 is assumed. Although the maximum achievable diversity
gain cannot be increased by having a perfect source–relay link, observe in Figure 12.14 that the system’s
BER performance was indeed improved. To be more speciﬁc, a performance gain as high as 5 dB was
attained in Figure 12.14 for the system using the DDF scheme by having a perfect source–relay link,
whereas only a negligible performance gain was attained in Figure 12.14 by its DAF-aided counterpart.
Furthermore, by comparing the performance achieved by the DAF and DDF schemes in Figure 12.14,
we observe that the latter is slightly outperformed by the former if the transmissions between the source
and relay nodes are carried out over a noisy link having an SNR at the relay node which is equal to that
measured at the destination node. However, it is expected that the latter will outperform the former as
a beneﬁt of having a better-quality source–relay link, as indicated by the extreme example of having
a noise-free source–relay link, which was characterized in Figure 12.14. Therefore, when the source–
relay link is of poor quality, it is preferable to employ the DAF scheme, which outperforms the DDF
scheme despite its lower complexity, since there is no need to carry out any differential decoding and
re-encoding.
12.3.3
Multi-path MSDSD Design for Cooperative Communication
In order to mitigate the potential negative impact induced by strongly time-selective or frequency-
selective channels on the conventional T-DQPSK or F-DQPSK scenarios of Section 12.1.1, the single-
path MSDSD introduced in Section 12.2 constitutes an attractive scheme for employment by the relay
nodes, when differential decoding is carried out at relay nodes using the DF protocol. Figure 12.15
characterizes the achievable performance improvements of the DDF-aided two-user cooperative system
attained by the single-path MSDSD scheme at the relay node in time-selective Rayleigh fading channels
at different normalized Doppler frequencies. When employing the MSDSD scheme using Nwind = 6 at
the relay node, observe in Figure 12.15 that the error ﬂoors encountered in time-selective channels
corresponding to fd = 0.01 and fd = 0.03 are signiﬁcantly mitigated, resulting in a substantial

performance gain. For example, given a target BER of 10−4, a performance gain in excess of 5 dB can be
achieved for fd = 0.01 as seen in Figure 12.15. However, since the end-to-end performance of the user
cooperative system of Figure 12.10 is determined by the robustness of the differential detection schemes
employed at both the relay and destination nodes, the single-path MSDSD-aided relay terminals alone
are unable to guarantee a desirable end-to-end performance. Hence, although a signiﬁcant performance
gain can be attained by improving the detection capability at the relay node, there is still a substantial
performance gap between the BER curve obtained at fd = 0.01 or fd = 0.03 and that corresponding
to fd = 0.001. The maximum diversity order of two is not achieved at fd = 0.03 or fd = 0.01,
as indicated by the slope of the BER curve seen in Figure 12.15. Hence, for further improving the
performance of the DDF-aided cooperative system or that of the DAF-aided one, a powerful differential
detector has to be applied at the destination node, which is robust to the impairments imposed by
time-selective channels. Unfortunately, the single-path MSDSD scheme cannot be directly employed
by the destination node in order jointly to decode differentially the multi-path signals received from
the source and relay nodes. Thus, a potential channel-induced performance degradation may still occur
when carrying out conventional differential detection of signals received over the multi-path channel,
which is discussed in Section 12.3.2. In the forthcoming sections, based on the principle of the single-
path MSDSD, we will propose an MSDSD scheme speciﬁcally designed for user-cooperation-aided
communication systems, which is capable of jointly detecting differentially the multi-path signals
delivered by the source and relay nodes.

Then, based on Equation (12.50) and Equation (12.56), we can construct the general input–output
relation of the channel for multiple differential symbol transmissions for both DAF- and DDF-aided
user-cooperative systems, where we have the equivalent multiple-symbol-based system model as
Y = ˜Sd ˜H + ˜
W.
(12.63)
Note that if A represents a matrix, then A is a block matrix, Ad denotes a diagonal matrix, and Ad
represents a block diagonal matrix. The block matrix Y hosting the received signal, which contains
signals received during Nwind successive user-cooperation-based symbol durations corresponding to
Nwind consecutively transmitted differential symbols ss[n] (n = 0, 1, . . . , Nwind −1) of the source
node, is deﬁned as
Y = [YT

(12.64)
and the block matrix ˜H representing the channel as well as the block matrix ˜
W of the AWGN are
deﬁned likewise by vertically concatenating Nwind matrices ˜Hn (n = 0, 1, . . . , Nwind −1) and ˜
Wn

(n = 0, 1, . . . , Nwind −1), respectively. Therefore, we can represent ˜H as
˜H = [ ˜HT

(12.65)
and express ˜

(12.68)
where ˜Sn (n = 0, 1, . . . , Nwind −1) was given by Equation (12.51) or Equation (12.58).
Note that all the elements in ˜Hn and ˜
Wn of (12.52) and (12.55) possess a standard Gaussian
distribution for the DDF-aided cooperative system, whereas most terms in ˜Hn and ˜
Wn of (12.59)
and (12.61) do not for its DAF-aided counterpart. However, our informal simulation-based investiga-
tions suggest that the resultant noise processes are near-Gaussian distributed in the DAF-aided scenario.
As a result, the PDF of the corresponding received signal in (12.63) is also near-Gaussian, especially for
low SNRs, as seen in Figure 12.16. Hence, under the simplifying assumption that the equivalent fading
and noise are zero-mean complex-Gaussian processes in the DAF-aided cooperative system, the PDF of
the non-coherent receiver’s output Y at the BS for both the DAF- and DDF-aided cooperative systems
can be obtained based on its counterpart of Equation (12.14) derived for the single-transmit-antenna
scenario in Section 12.2 as
Pr(Y|˜Sd) = exp(−Tr{YHΨ−1Y})

and DAF-aided systems, respectively, are diagonal due to the temporally and spatially uncorrelated
nature of the AWGN.
Although the basic idea behind the ML detector is that of maximizing the a posteriori probability of
the received signal block matrix Y, this problem can be readily shown to be equivalent to maximizing
the a priori probability of Equation (12.69) with the aid of Bayes’ theorem [542]. Thus, based on the
ML detection rule, an exhaustive search has to be carried out over the entire transmitted signal vector
space in order to ﬁnd the speciﬁc solution which maximizes the a priori probability of Equation (12.69).
Thus, the ML metric of the multi-path MSDD can be expressed as
ˆSML =

where s is a column vector hosting all the diagonal elements of the diagonal matrix ˜Sd. Note that
although s has UN wind elements, each of which is chosen from an identical constellation set of Mc, we
have s ∈MNwind
c
instead of s ∈MUN wind
c
, since all the U diagonal elements of our derived equivalent
U-user-cooperation transmitted signal ˜Sn of Equation (12.51) or (12.58) have the same symbol value
as that of the nth signal transmitted from the source in the broadcast phase I. More speciﬁcally, ˜s may
be expressed as
˜s = [˜s1 ˜s2 . . . ˜sU

(12.87)
where the subvector ˜sn is a column vector containing all the diagonal elements of the matrix ˜Sn.
12.3.3.2
Transformation of the ML Metric
Again, in a user-cooperation-aided system, the noise contributions imposed at the relay and destination
nodes are both temporally and spatially uncorrelated, thus we have diagonal noise autocorrelation
matrices for both the DDF-aided and DAF-aided systems, as observed in Equations (12.78) and (12.84),
respectively. Additionally, the equivalent transmitted signal matrix ˜Sd of the user-cooperation-aided
system as constructed in either Equation (12.51) or Equation (12.58) for the above-mentioned two
systems is a unitary matrix, hence we have
˜Sd
−1 = ˜Sd
H.
(12.88)
Then, we can further extend Equation (12.71) as
Ψ = ˜SdE{ ˜H ˜H
H}˜Sd
H + E{ ˜
W ˜

H}
(12.89)
= ˜Sd(E{ ˜H ˜H

where we have
C ≜E{ ˜H ˜H

(12.92)
which is deﬁned as the (UN wind × UN wind)-element channel-noise autocorrelation matrix. Now, the
ML metric of Equation (12.86) generated for the multi-path MSDD can be reformulated by substituting
Equation (12.91) characterizing Ψ into Equation (12.86) as
ˆSML =
arg min
˜Sd→˜s∈MNwind

Tr{YHΨ−1Y}
(12.93)

c
Tr{YH(˜SdC˜Sd

(12.94)

Furthermore, since the ˜Sd is unitary, we get
ˆSML =
arg min
˜Sd→˜s∈MNwind
c
Tr{YH ˜SdC−1˜Sd
HY}.
(12.95)
Now we deﬁne two matrix transformation operators, namely Fy(·) and Fs(·), for the received
signal matrix Y of Equation (12.54) or (12.57) and the transmitted signal matrix ˜Sd of Equation (12.51)
or (12.58), respectively, in the scenario of a differentially modulated U-user cooperative system
employing N receive antennas at the BS and jointly detecting differentially Nwind received symbols.

where −→
y i is the ith row of the matrix Y and the resultant matrix is a (UN wind × UNN wind)-element

Sd, is deﬁned as
Fs(˜Sd) ≜

where ˜si is the ith element of the column vector ˜s of Equation (12.87) hosting all the UN wind diagonal

Consequently, we exploit the transformation operators Fy(·) deﬁned in Equation (12.96) and Fs(·)
deﬁned in Equation (12.97), which allow us further to reformulate the ML solution expression of

a shortest-vector problem.

Multi-dimensional Tree-Search-Aided MSDSD Algorithm
Although the problem of ﬁnding an optimum solution for the ML-MSDD has been transformed into the
so-called shortest-vector problem of Equation (12.107), the multi-path ML-MSDD designed for user-
cooperation-aided systems may impose a potentially excessive computational complexity when aiming
at ﬁnding the solution which minimizes Equation (12.107), especially when a high-order differential
modulation scheme and/or a high observation window size Nwind are employed. Fortunately, in light of
the SD algorithms discussed in Chapter 9, the computational complexity imposed may be signiﬁcantly
reduced by carrying out a tree search within a reduced-size hypersphere conﬁned by either the search
radius C for the depth-ﬁrst SD or the maximum number of candidates K retained at each search tree
level for the breadth-ﬁrst SD. In our following discourse, we consider the depth-ﬁrst SD algorithm as
an example and demonstrate how to reduce the complexity imposed by the ML-MSSD.
In order to search for the ML solution of Equation (12.107) in a conﬁned hypersphere, an initial
search radius C is introduced. Thus, we obtain the metric relevant for the multi-path MSDSD scheme as

Furthermore, due to the employment of a differential modulation scheme, the information is encoded
as the phase difference between the consecutively transmitted symbols. Hence, in light of the multi-
layer tree search proposed for the SD in Section 11.3.2.3, the MSDSD scheme can start the search from
n = (Nwind −1) by choosing a trial submatrix for SF Nwind −1 satisfying
DNwind −1 ≤C2
(12.112)
from the legitimate candidate pool, after simply assuming that the Nwindth symbol transmitted by the
source is ss = 1. That is, according to Equation (12.102) we have

Given the trial submatrix SF Nwind −1 satisfying Equation (12.112), the search continues and a candidate
matrix is selected for SF Nwind −2 based on the criterion that the value of the resultant PED computed
using Equation (12.111) does not exceed the squared radius, i.e.
DNwind −2 ≤C2.
(12.114)
This recursive process will continue until n reaches 1, i.e. when we choose a trial value for ˜s1
within the computed range. Then the search radius C is updated by calculating the Euclidean distance
between the newly obtained signal point SF and the origin and a new search is carried out within
a reduced compound conﬁned by the newly obtained search radius. The search then proceeds in
the same way, until no more legitimate signal points can be found in the increasingly reduced
search area. Consequently, the last legitimate signal point SF found this way is regarded as the ML
solution of Equation (12.107). Therefore, in comparison with the multi-path ML-MSDD algorithm
of Equation (12.107), the MSDSD algorithm may achieve a signiﬁcant computational complexity
reduction, as does its single-path counterpart, as observed in Section 12.2. For more details on the
principle of SD algorithms refer to Chapter 9 and on the idea of multi-layer tree search to Chapter 11.

Performance of the MSDSD-Aided DAF-User-Cooperation System
As discussed in Section 12.3.2.3, the relative mobility among users imposes a performance degradation
on the user-cooperation-aided system. Thus, the multi-path MSDSD scheme proposed in Section 12.3.3,
which relies on the exploitation of the correlation between the phase distortions experienced by the
Nwind consecutive transmitted DPSK symbols, is employed in order to mitigate the channel-induced
error ﬂoor encountered by the CDD characterized in Figure 12.17. The system parameters used in our
simulations are summarized in Table 12.5.
Figure 12.17 depicts the BER performance improvement achieved by the MSDSD employed at
the destination node for the DAF-aided two-user cooperative system in the presence of three different
normalized Doppler frequencies, namely fd = 0.03, 0.01 and 0.001. With the aid of the MSDSD
employing Nwind = 6 at the destination node, both the error ﬂoors experienced in Rayleigh channels
having normalized frequencies of fd = 0.03 and 0.01 are signiﬁcantly mitigated. Speciﬁcally, the

with the MSDSD. Remarkably, in the scenario of a fast-fading channel having fd = 0.03, the BER
curve obtained when the CDD is employed at the destination node levels out just below 10−3, as the
SNR increases. By contrast, with the aid of the MSDSD the resultant BER curve decreases steadily,

suffering a modest performance loss of only about 4 dB at the target BER of 10−5 in comparison with
the curve associated with fd = 0.001. Hence, the more time selective the channel, the more signiﬁcant
the performance improvement achieved by the proposed MSDSD scheme.
For further reducing the detrimental impact induced by the time-selective channel on the DAF-
aided user-cooperative system, an observation window size of Ncand = 11 is employed by the MSDSD
arrangement at the destination node at the expense of a higher detection complexity. As seen in
Figure 12.18, the MSDSD using Nwind = 11 is capable of eliminating the error ﬂoor encountered
by the system employing the CDD, even when the channel is severely time selective, i.e. for fd = 0.03.
In other words, the BER curve corresponding to the MSDSD-aided system in Figure 12.18 and obtained
for fd = 0.03 coincides with that of its CDD-aided counterpart recorded for fd = 0.001. Furthermore,
the MSDSD-aided system with Nwind = 11 in a fast-fading channel associated with fd = 0.01 is able
to outperform the system employing Nwind = 2, even if the latter is operating in a slow-fading channel
having fd = 0.001. Therefore, even in the presence of a severely time-selective channel, the DAF-aided
user-cooperative system employing the MSDSD is capable of achieving an attractive performance by
jointly detecting differentially a sufﬁciently high number of consecutively received user-cooperation-
based joint symbols Sn (n = 0, 1, . . . , Nwind −1) of Equation (12.58) by exploiting knowledge of the
equivalent channel autocorrelation matrix E{ ˜H ˜H
H} of Equation (12.79), which characterizes the CIR
statistics of both the direct and relay links.
All the previously described simulations were carried out under the assumption that an identical
normalized Doppler frequency is exhibited by each link of the user-cooperation system, i.e. that we have
fd,sd = fd,sr = fd,rd = fd. However, a more realistic scenario is the one where the relative speeds of
all the cooperative users as well as of the destination terminal are different from each other, leading to
a different Doppler frequency for each link. Thus, in order to investigate the impact of different relative
speeds among all the nodes on the attainable end-to-end performance of the DAF-aided system, Monte
Carlo simulations were carried out for the three different scenarios summarized in Table 12.6. In all the

three situations, only one of the three nodes in the two-user cooperation-aided system is supposed to
move relative to the other two nodes at a speed resulting in a normalized Doppler frequency of 0.03,
while the latter two remain stationary relative to each other, yielding a normalized Doppler frequency
of 0.001.
In Figure 12.19 the BER curves corresponding to the three different scenarios of Table 12.6 are
bounded by the two dashed–dotted BER curves having no legends, which were obtained by assuming
an identical normalized Doppler frequency of fd = 0.03 and fd = 0.001 for each link in the user-
cooperation-aided system, respectively. This is not unexpected, since the two above-mentioned BER
bounds correspond to the least and most desirable time-selective channel conditions considered in
this chapter, respectively. The channel quality of the direct link characterized in terms of its grade of
time selectivity predetermines the achievable performance of the DAF-aided user-cooperation-assisted
system employing the MSDSD. Hence, it is observed in Figure 12.19 that the system is capable of
attaining a better BER performance in Scenario II (fd,sd = 0.001) than in the other two scenarios
(fd,sd = 0.03). However, as seen in Figure 12.19, due to the high speed of the relay node observed in
Scenario II relative to the source and destination nodes, the MSDSD employing Nwind = 6 remains
unable to eliminate completely the impairments induced by the time-selective channel, unless a higher
Nwind value is employed. Therefore, a modest performance degradation occurs in comparison with the
fd = 0.001 scenario. On the other hand, the MSDSD-aided system exhibits a similar performance in
Scenario I and Scenario III, since the source–relay and relay–destination links are symmetric and thus
they are exchangeable in the context of the DAF scheme, as observed in Equation (12.81).
12.3.4.2
Performance of the MSDSD-Aided DDF User-Cooperation System
Despite the fact that the performance degradation experienced by the conventional DDF-aided user-
cooperation system employing the CDD in severely time-selective channels can be mitigated by
utilizing the single-path MSDSD at the relay node, a signiﬁcant performance loss remains unavoidable
due to the absence of a detection technique at the destination node, which is robust to the time-selective
channel, as previously seen in Figure 12.15. Fortunately, the multi-path-based MSDSD designed for
the user-cooperation-aided system devised in Section 12.3.3 can be employed at the destination node in
order to mitigate further the channel-induced performance degradation of the DDF-aided system.
Figure 12.20 demonstrates a signiﬁcant performance improvement attained by the multi-path-based
MSDSD design employing Nwind = 6 at the destination node of the DDF-aided two-user cooperative
system over its counterpart dispensing with MSDSD at the destination at both fd = 0.03 and fd =
0.001 for each link, respectively. The more severely time selective the channel, the higher the end-to-
end performance gain that can be achieved by the MSDSD-assisted DDF-aided system. Speciﬁcally, for
a given target BER of 10−3, a performance gain as high as 9 dB is achieved at fd = 0.03, whereas only
negligible performance improvement is attained at fd = 0.01. On the other hand, by comparing the
simulation results of Figure 12.17 and Figure 12.20, we observe that the performance gains achieved
by the MSDSD employed at the destination node of the DDF-aided system is signiﬁcantly lower than
those recorded for its DAF-aided counterpart. Even though Nwind = 11 is employed, there is still a
conspicuous gap between the BER curves corresponding to high values of fd and the one obtained
at fd = 0.001 in the context of the DDF-aided system, as shown in Figure 12.21. This trend is not

unexpected owing to the fact that the design of the multi-path MSDSD used in the DDF-aided user-
cooperation-assisted system is carried out under the assumption of an idealized perfect reception-and-
forward process at the relay node, while actually the relay will keep silent when it fails to detect the
received signal correctly, as detected by the CRC check. In other words, the MSDSD employed at the
destination simply assumes that the relay node has knowledge of the signal transmitted by the source
node as implied by the system model of Equation (12.37) describing the DDF-aided system, operating
without realizing that sometimes only noise is presented to the receive antenna during the relay phase II.
In comparison with its DAF-aided counterpart, the end-to-end performance of the DDF-aided
system is jointly determined by the robustness of the differential detection technique to time-selective
channels at the destination node, as well as by that at the relay node. Previously, we employed the
same observation window size Nwind for the MSDSDs used at both the relay and destination nodes.
However, in reality there exist situations where the affordable overall system complexity is limited and
hence a low value of Nwind has to be used at both the relay and destination nodes. Thus, it is beneﬁcial
to characterize the importance of the detection technique employed at the relay and destination nodes
to determine the system’s required complexity. Figure 12.22 plots the BER curve of the DDF-aided
two-user cooperative system for Nwind = 6 at the relay node and for Nwind = 2 at the destination node
versus that generated by reversing the Nwind allocation, i.e. by having Nwind = 2 and Nwind = 6 at
the relay and destination nodes, respectively. Observe in Figure 12.22 that the system having a more
robust differential detector at the relay node slightly outperforms the other in the high-SNR range at
both fd = 0.03 and fd = 0.01. This is because a less robust detection scheme employed at the relay
node may erode the beneﬁts of relaying in the DDF-aided user-cooperation-assisted system. Naturally,
this degrades the achievable performance of the MSDSD at the destination, which carries out the
detection based on the assumption of a reliable relayed signal. Hence, in the context of the DDF-aided

user-cooperation-assisted system employing the MSDSD, a higher complexity should be invested at the
relay node in the interest of achieving an enhanced end-to-end performance.
Let us now investigate the effect of the relative mobility of the source, relay and destination nodes
on the achievable BER performance of the DDF-aided two-user cooperative system by considering
the BER curves corresponding to the three scenarios of Table 12.6, in Figure 12.23. Based on our
previous discussions, we understand that the performances of the detection schemes employed at both
the relay and destination nodes are equally important factors in determining the achievable end-to-end
system performance, which are mainly affected by the Doppler frequency characteristics of both the
source–relay link and the source–destination link in the DDF-aided user-cooperation-assisted system.
In Scenario I of Table 12.6 the system exhibits the worst BER performance, which is roughly the same
as the fd = 0.03 performance bound, since the beneﬁts brought about by a high-quality, near-stationary
relay–destination link may be eroded by a low-quality, high-Doppler source–relay link dominating the
achievable performance of the MSDSD scheme at the relay node, which in turn substantially degrades
the achievable end-to-end system performance. In Scenario II of Table 12.6, we assumed that the source
and destination nodes experience a low Doppler frequency in the direct link (fd,sd = 0.001), which is
one of the two above-mentioned dominant links in the DDF-aided system. Thus, for a given target BER
of 10−4, the system achieves a performance gain as high as 5 dB in Scenario II over that attained
in the benchmark scenario having an identical Doppler frequency of fd = 0.03 for each link, as
observed in Figure 12.23. Moreover, the achievable performance gain can be almost doubled if the
system is operating in Scenario III, where in turn the other important link, namely the source–relay link,
becomes a slow-fading channel associated with fd = 0.001. Remarkably, the performance achieved in
Scenario III is comparable with that attained by the same system in the benchmark scenario, where we
have fd = 0.001 for each of the three links. More speciﬁcally, the system operating in Scenario III only
suffers a performance loss of about 1 dB at a target BER of 10−4 in comparison with that associated
with the slow-fading benchmark scenario.

Chapter Conclusions
Cooperative diversity, emerging as an attractive diversity-aided technique to circumvent the cost and
size constraints of implementing multiple antennas on a pocket-sized mobile device with the aid
of antenna sharing among multiple cooperating single-antenna-aided users, is capable of effectively
combating the effects of channel fading and hence improving the attainable performance of the
network. However, the user-cooperation mechanism may result in a complex system when using
coherent detection, where not only the BS but also the cooperating MSs would require channel
estimation. Channel estimation would impose both an excessive complexity and a high pilot overhead.
This situation may be further aggravated in mobile environments associated with relatively rapidly
ﬂuctuating channel conditions. Therefore, the consideration of cooperative system design without
assuming knowledge of the CSI at transceivers becomes more realistic, which inspires the employment
of differentially encoded modulation at the transmitter and that of non-coherent detection dispensing
with both the pilots and channel estimation at the receiver. However, as discussed in Section 12.1.1,
the performance of the low-complexity CDD-aided direct-transmission-based OFDM system may
substantially degrade in highly time-selective or frequency-selective channels, depending on the domain
in which the differential encoding is carried out. Fortunately, as argued in Section 12.2, the single-
path MSDSD, which has been contrived to mitigate the channel-induced error ﬂoor encountered by
differentially encoded single-input, single-output transmission, jointly detects differentially multiple
consecutively received signals by exploiting the correlation among their phase distortions. Hence,
inspired by the proposal of the single-path MSDSD, our main objective in this chapter is speciﬁcally
to design a multi-path MSDSD which is applicable to the differentially encoded cooperative systems
in order to make the overall system robust to the effects of the hostile wireless channel. To this
end, in Section 12.3.3.1 we constructed a generalized equivalent multiple-symbol system model for
the cooperative system employing either the DAF or DDF scheme, which facilitated the process of

transforming the optimum detection metric to a shortest-vector problem, as detailed in Section 12.3.3.2.
Then, it was shown in Section 12.3.3.4 that the resultant shortest-vector problem may be efﬁciently
solved by a multi-layer tree search scheme, which is similar to that proposed in Section 11.3.2.3.
This procedure relies on the channel-noise autocorrelation matrix triangularization procedure of
Section 12.3.3.3.
Our Monte Carlo simulation results provided in Section 12.3.4.1 demonstrated that the resultant
multi-path MSDSD employed at the BS is capable of completely eliminating the performance loss
encountered by the DAF-aided cooperative system, provided that a sufﬁciently high value of Nwind is
used. For example, observe in Figure 12.18 that, given a target BER of 10−3, a performance gain of
about 10 dB can be attained by the proposed MSDSD employing Nwind = 11 for a DQPSK-modulated
two-user cooperative system in a relatively fast-fading channel associated with a normalized Doppler
frequency of 0.03. In contrast to the DAF-aided cooperative system, it was shown in Figure 12.21 of

418
Chapter 12. Multiple-Symbol Differential Sphere Detection
Section 12.3.4.2 that, although a signiﬁcant performance improvement can also be achieved by the
multi-path MSDSD at the BS in highly time-selective channels for the DDF-aided system, the channel-
induced performance loss was not completely eliminated, even when Nwind = 11 was employed.
This was because the MSDSD employed at the BS simply assumed a guaranteed perfect decoding
at the relay, operating without taking into account that sometimes only noise is presented to the
receive antenna during the relay’s phase II, i.e. when the relay keeps silent owing to the failure of
recovering the source’s signal. Furthermore, our investigation of the proposed MSDSD in the practical
Rayleigh fading scenario, where a different Doppler frequency is assumed for each link, demonstrated
that the channel quality of the direct source–destination link characterized in terms of its grade of
time selectivity predetermines the achievable performance of the DAF-aided cooperative system. By
contrast, the source–relay and relay–destination links are symmetric and thus they may be interchanged
without affecting the end-to-end performance. By contrast, observe in Figure 12.23 that the achievable
performance of the DDF-aided system employing the MSDSD is dominated by the source–relay link.
This is not unexpected, since a high-quality, near-stationary source–relay link enhances the performance
of the MSDSD at the BS, making its assumption of a perfect decoding at the relay more realistic. Finally,
based on the simulation results obtained in this chapter, we quantitatively summarize the performance
gains achieved by the MSDSD for the direct-transmission-based non-cooperative system as well as for
both the DAF- and DDF-aided cooperative systems in Table 12.7.

Introduction1
13.1.1
Chapter Contributions and Outline
It was observed in Chapter 12 that the differentially modulated user-cooperative uplink systems
employing either the DAF scheme of Section 12.3.2.1 or the DDF scheme of Section 12.3.2.2 were
capable of achieving cooperative diversity gain while circumventing the cost and size constraints of
implementing multiple antennas in a pocket device. Additionally, by avoiding the challenging task
of estimating all the (Nt × Nr) CIRs of multi-antenna-aided systems, the differentially encoded
cooperative system may exhibit a better performance than its coherently detected, but non-cooperative,
counterpart, since the CIRs cannot be perfectly estimated by the terminals. The CIR estimation
becomes even more challenging when the MS travels at a relatively high speed, resulting in a rapidly
fading environment. On the other hand, although it was shown in Chapter 12 that a full spatial
diversity can usually be achieved by the differentially modulated user-cooperative uplink system,
the achievable end-to-end BER performance may signiﬁcantly depend on the speciﬁc choice of the
cooperative protocol employed and/or on the quality of the relay channel. Therefore, in the scenario of
differentially modulated cooperative uplink systems, where multiple cooperating MSs are roaming in
the area between a speciﬁc MS and the BS seen in Figure 13.1, an appropriate Cooperative-Protocol
Selection (CPS) as well as a matching Cooperating-User Selection (CUS) becomes necessary in order
to maintain a desirable end-to-end performance. Motivated by the above-mentioned observations, the
novel contributions of this chapter are as follows:

• The achievable end-to-end performance is theoretically analysed for both the DAF- and DDF-
aided cooperative systems.
• Based on the above-mentioned analytical results, both CUS schemes and Adaptive Power
Control (APC) schemes are proposed for the above two types of cooperative system in the interest
of achieving the best possible performance.
• Intensive comparative studies of the most appropriate resource allocation in the context of both
DAF- and DDF-assisted cooperative systems are carried out.
• In order to make the most of the complementarity of the DAF- and DDF-aided cooperative
systems, a more ﬂexible resource-optimized adaptive hybrid cooperation-aided system is
proposed, yielding a further improved performance.
The remainder of this chapter is organized as follows. In Section 13.2 we ﬁrst theoretically analyse
the achievable end-to-end performance of both the DAF- and DDF-assisted cooperative systems. Then,
based on the BER performance analysis of Section 13.2, in Sections 13.3.1 and 13.3.2 we will propose
appropriate CUS schemes for both the above-mentioned two types of cooperative systems, along with
an optimized power control arrangement. Additionally, in order to improve further the achievable end-
to-end performance of the cooperation-aided UL of Figure 13.1 and to create a ﬂexible cooperative
mechanism, in Section 13.4 we will also investigate the CPS of the UL in conjunction with the CUS as
well as the power control, leading to a resource-optimized adaptive cooperation-aided system. Finally,
our concluding remarks will be provided in Section 13.5.
13.1.2
System Model
To be consistent with the system model employed in Chapter 12, the U-user TDMA UL is considered
for the sake of simplicity. Again, due to the symmetry of channel allocation among users, as indicated
in Figure 12.9, we focus our attention on the information transmission of a speciﬁc source MS seen in
Figure 13.1, which potentially employs Mr out of the Pcand = (U −1) available relay stations in order
to achieve cooperation-aided diversity by forming a VAA. Without loss of generality, we simply assume
the employment of a single antenna for each terminal. For simple analytical tractability, we assume that
the sum of the distances Dsru between the source MS and the uth RS, and that between the uth RS and
the destination BS, which is represented by Dru d, is equal to the distance Dsd between the source MS
and the BS. Equivalently, as indicated by Figure 13.1, we have
Dsru + Dru d = Dsd,
u = 1, 2, . . . , U −1.
(13.1)

Furthermore, by considering a path-loss exponent of v [607], the average power σ2
i,j at the output of
the channel can be computed according to the internode distance Di,j as follows:
σ2
i,j = C · D−v
i,j ,
i, j ∈{s, ru, d},
(13.2)
where C is a constant which can be normalized to unity without loss of generality and the subscripts s,
ru and d represent the source, the uth relay and the destination, respectively. Thus, Equation (13.2) can
be expressed as
σ2
i,j = D−v
i,j ,
i, j ∈{s, ru, d}.
(13.3)
Additionally, under the assumption of having a total transmit power of P and assuming that Mr
cooperating MSs are activated out of a total of Pcand, we can express the associated power constraint as
P = Ps +
Mr

m=1
Prm,
(13.4)
where Ps and Prm (m = 1, 2, . . . , Mr) are the transmit power employed by the source MS and the
mth RS, respectively.
13.2
Performance Analysis of the Cooperation-Aided UL
In this section, we commence analysing the error probability performance of both the DAF-aided and
DDF-aided systems, where the MSDSD devised in Chapter 12 is employed in order to combat the
effects of fast fadings caused by the relative mobility of the MSs and BS in the cell. Recall from
Chapter 12 that the Doppler-frequency-induced error ﬂoor encountered by the CDD (or equivalently by
the MSDSD using Nwind = 2) is expected to be signiﬁcantly eliminated by jointly detecting Nwind > 2
consecutive received symbols with the aid of the MSDSD, provided that Nwind is sufﬁciently high.
Therefore, under the assumption that the associated performance degradation can be mitigated by the
MSDSD in both the DAF-aided and DDF-aided cooperative systems, it is reasonable to expect that the
BER performance exhibited by the cooperation-assisted system employing the MSDSD in a relatively
rapidly fading environment can be closely approximated by that achieved by the CDD in slow-fading
channels. Hence, in the ensuing two sections our performance analysis is carried out without considering
the detrimental effects imposed by the mobility of the MSs, since these effects are expected to be
mitigated by employment of the MSDSD of Section 12.3. Consequently, our task may be interpreted as
the performance analysis of a CDD-assisted differentially modulated cooperative system operating in
slow-fading channels.

13.2.1.1
Performance Analysis
First of all, without loss of accuracy, we drop the time index n and rewrite the signal of Equation (12.35)
received at the mth cooperating MS and that of Equation (12.39) from the mth RS at the BS as follows:
ysrm =
√
Pssshsrm + wsrm,
(13.5)
yrmd = fAM rm ysrmhrm d + wrmd,
(13.6)
where the ampliﬁcation factor fAM rm employed by the mth relay node can be speciﬁed as [604]
fAM rm =
"
Prm
Psσ2srm + N0 ,
(13.7)

422
Chapter 13. Resource Allocation in Fast Rayleigh Fading Channels
with N0 being the variance of the AWGN imposed at all cooperating MSs as well as at the BS. Then,
we can further reformat Equation (13.6) with the aid of Equation (13.5) in order to express the signal
received at the destination BS from the RS as
yrmd = fAM rm hrm d(
√
Pshsrmss + wsrm) + wrmd
(13.8)
= fAM rm
√
Pshrm dhsrmss + fAM rm hrmdwsrm + wrmd.
(13.9)
Hence, we can calculate the received SNR per symbol at the BS for both the direct and the relaying
links, respectively, as
γs
sd = Ps|hsd|2
N0
,
(13.10)
γs
rmd =
PsPrm|hsrm|2|hrmd|2
N0(Psσ2srm + Prm|hrmd|2 + N0).
(13.11)
Furthermore, MRC is assumed to be employed at the BS prior to the CDD scheme for the system using
the DAF arrangement characterized in Equation (12.40) of Section 12.3.2.1, which is rewritten here for
convenience:
y = a0(ysd[n −1])∗ysd[n] +
Mr

m=1
am(yrmd[n + mLf −1])∗yrmd[n + mLf],
(13.12)
where Lf is the length of the transmission packet, while the coefﬁcients a0 and am (m = 1, 2, . . . , Mr)
are given by
a0 = 1
N0 ,
(13.13)
am =
Psσ2
srm + N0
N0(Psσ2srm + Prm|hrmd|2 + N0).
(13.14)
According to the basic property of the MRC scheme, the SNR at the MRC’s output can be expressed as
γs = γs
sd +
Mr

m=1
γs
rmd.
(13.15)
Equivalently, we can express the SNR per bit at the output of the MRC as
γb =

log2 Mc
= γb

(13.16)
where Mc is the constellation size of a speciﬁc modulation scheme.
On the other hand, the end-to-end BER expression conditioned on the SNR per bit at the combiner’s
output, namely γb of Equation (13.16), for the DAF-aided system activating Mr RSs for a speciﬁc
source MS can be expressed as [608]

(13.19)
and
β = a/b.
(13.20)
In Equation (13.17) the parameters a and b are the modulation-dependent factors deﬁned in [467].

2 for DQPSK modulation using Gray coding. Additionally, the parameter β, which is deﬁned
as Equation (13.20), can be calculated according to the speciﬁc modulation scheme employed [467].
Moreover, the parameter L of Equation (13.18) denotes the number of diversity paths. For example,
when Mr cooperating MSs are activated, we have L = Mr + 1, assuming that the BS combines the
signals received from all the Mr RSs as well as that from the direct link.
On the other hand, since a non-dispersive Rayleigh fading channel is considered here, the PDF of
the channel’s fading amplitude r can be expressed as [607]
pr(r) =



2r
Ωe−r2/Ω,
0 ≤r ≤∞
0,
r < 0,
(13.21)
where Ω= r2 represents the mean square value of the fading amplitude. Hence, the PDF of the
instantaneous received SNR per bit at the output of the Rayleigh fading channel is given by the so-
called Γ distribution [607]
pγb(γ) =



1
γb e−γ/γb,
γ ≥0
0,
γ < 0
(13.22)
where γb denotes the average received SNR per bit, which can be expressed as
γb = Pt,bit · Ω
N0
(13.23)
= Pt,symbol · Ω
N0 · log2 Mc ,
(13.24)
with Pt,bit and Pt,symbol representing the transmit power per bit and per symbol, respectively.
Now, the unconditional end-to-end BER of the DAF-aided cooperative system can be calculated by
averaging the conditional BER expression of Equation (13.17) over the entire range of received SNR
per bit values by weighting it according to its probability of occurrence represented with the aid of its
PDF in Equation (13.22) as follows [608,609]:

where the parameter Nn is introduced to control the accuracy of Equation (13.39). Since the Taylor
series in Equation (13.38) converges quickly, the integration in Equation (13.37) can be approximated
by the sum of the ﬁrst Nn elements in Equation 13.39. Consequently, the average BER of the DAF-
aided cooperative system where the desired source MS relies on Mr cooperating MSs activated in order
to form a VAA can be expressed as

(13.40)
Using the same technique as in [604], the BER expression of Equation (13.40) can be upper-
bounded by bounding Zrm(θ) of Equation (13.35), to simplify the exact BER expression of Equa-
tion (13.40). Speciﬁcally, Rrm(θ) of Equation (13.36) reaches its minimum value when α(θ) of
Equation (13.19) is maximized at θ = π/2, which in turn maximizes Zrm(θ) of Equation (13.35).
Thus, the error probability of Equation (13.40) may be upper-bounded as

Similarly, the average BER of Equation (13.40) can be lower-bounded by minimizing Zrm(θ) of
Equation (13.35) at θ = −π/2. Speciﬁcally, from Equation (13.40) we arrive at the error probability

For further simplifying the BER expressions of Equations (13.41) and (13.44), we can neglect
all the additive terms of ‘1’ in the denominators of both of the above-mentioned BER expressions
by considering the relatively high-SNR region. Consequently, after some further manipulations, the

Simulation Results and Discussion
Let us now consider a DAF-aided cooperative cellular uplink system using Mr relaying MSs in an
urban area having a path-loss exponent of v = 3. Without loss of generality, all the activated relaying
MSs are assumed to be located about half-way between the source MS and the BS, while the total power

RSs. To be more speciﬁc, we have Dsrm = Dsd/2, Ps = Prm = P/(Mr + 1), m = 1, 2, . . . , Mr.
Moreover, the normalized Doppler frequency is set to fd = 0.01 under the assumption that multiple
MSs are randomly moving around in the same cell. The system parameters considered in this section
are summarized in Table 13.1.
The theoretical BER curves of Equation (13.40) versus the SNR received for slow-fading channels
are depicted in Figure 13.2 in comparison with the results obtained by our Monte Carlo simulations,
where the MSDSD of Section 12.3 using Nwind = 8 is employed at the BS to eliminate the performance

loss imposed by the relative mobility of the cooperating MSs, which is again modelled by a normalized
Doppler frequency of fd = 0.01. As suggested previously in Section 13.2.1.1, the Taylor series in
Equation (13.38) converges rapidly and hence we employ Nn = 5 in Equation (13.39) to reduce
the computational complexity, while maintaining the required accuracy. Observe in Figure 13.2 that
all theoretical BER curves, corresponding to different numbers of activated cooperating MSs and to
DBPSK and DQPSK modulation schemes, match well with the BER curves obtained by our Monte
Carlo simulations. Therefore, with the aid of the MSDSD of Section 12.3 employed at the BS, a full
diversity order of L = (Mr+1) can be achieved by the DAF-aided cooperative system in rapidly fading
channels, where the achievable BER performance can be accurately predicted using Equation (13.40).
Additionally, the BER upper and lower bounds of Equations (13.41) and (13.44) derived for
both DBPSK- and DQPSK-modulated DAF-aided cooperative systems are plotted in Figures 13.3(a)
and 13.3(b), respectively, versus the theoretical BER curve of Equation (13.40). Both the lower and
upper bounds are tight in comparison with the exact BER curve of Equation (13.40) when the DBPSK
modulation scheme is used, as observed in Figure 13.3(a). On the other hand, a relatively loose upper
bound is obtained by invoking Equation (13.41) for the DQPSK-modulated system, while the lower
bound associated with Equation (13.44) still remains very tight. Therefore, it is sufﬁciently accurate
to approximate the BER performance of the DAF-aided cooperative system using the lower bound of
Equation (13.44).
Furthermore, in order to simplify the lower-bound expression of Equation (13.41), the integration
term of Equation (13.37) is omitted completely, assuming that we have Nn = 0 in Equation (13.45).
The corresponding BER curves are depicted in Figure 13.4 versus those obtained when Nn = 5. It
can be seen that the lower bound obtained after discarding the integration term in Equation (13.37) still
remains accurate and tight in the relatively high-SNR region. More speciﬁcally, the resultant BER lower
bound remains tight over a wide span of SNRs and only becomes inaccurate when the SNR of P/N0
dips below 5 dB and 10 dB for the DBPSK- and DQPSK-modulated cooperative systems, respectively.

When the SNR is sufﬁciently high and hence employment of the high-SNR-based lower bound
of Equation (13.48) can be justiﬁed, its validity is veriﬁed by the BER curves of Figures 13.5(a)

high-SNR-based BER lower bound of Equation (13.48) having Nn = 0 in Equation (13.45) is capable
of accurately predicting the BER performance achieved by the DAF-aided cooperative cellular uplink,
provided that the transmitted SNR expressed in terms of P/N0 is in excess of 15 dB for both the DBPSK
and DQPSK modulation schemes considered.

13.2.2.1
Performance Analysis
In the following discourse, the analytical BER performance expressions will be derived for a DDF-aided
cooperative cellular system in order to facilitate our resource allocation to be outlined in Section 13.3.2.
In contrast to its DAF-aided counterpart of Section 13.2.1, the Mr cooperating MSs selected will
make sure that the information contained in the frame or packet received from the source MS can
be correctly recovered by differentially decoding the received signal with the aid of CRC checking,
prior to forwarding it to the BS. In other words, some of the Mr cooperating MSs selected may not
participate during the relaying phase, to avoid potential error propagation due to the imperfect signal
recovery. By simply assuming that the packet length is sufﬁciently high with respect to the channel’s
coherent time, the worst-case Packet Loss Ratio (PLR) at the mth cooperating MS can be expressed as
PPLRm,upper = 1 −(1 −PSERm)Lf ,
(13.52)
for a given packet length Lf, where PSERm represents the symbol error rate at the mth cooperating
MS, which can be calculated as [611]
PSERm = Mc −1

(13.53)
where ρm and the function ξ(x), respectively, can be written as follows:

1 + (Psσ2srm/N0),
(13.54)
ξ(x) =
!
1 −|x|2 + tan2(π/Mc).
(13.55)
Then, based on the PPLRm,upper expression of Equation (13.52), the average end-to-end BER upper
bound of a DDF-aided cooperative system can be obtained. Explicitly, in the context of a system where
only Mr = 1 cooperating user is selected to participate in relaying the signal from the source MS to the

430
Chapter 13. Resource Allocation in Fast Rayleigh Fading Channels
BS, the average end-to-end BER upper bound P DDF
BER,upper is obtained by the summation of the average
BERs of two scenarios as
P DDF
BER,upper = (1 −PPLR1,upper)P Φ1
BER + PPLR1,upperP Φ2
BER,
(13.56)
where Φ1 is deﬁned as the ﬁrst scenario when the cooperating MS perfectly recovers the information
received from the source MS and thus transmits the differentially remodulated signal to the BS. By
contrast, Φ2 is deﬁned as the second scenario, when the cooperating MS fails to decode correctly the
signal received from the source MS and hence remains silent during the relaying phase. Therefore, the
scenarios Φ1 and Φ2 can be simply represented as follows, depending on whether the transmit power
Pr1 of the cooperating MS is zero or not during the relaying phase. Thus, we can represent Φ1 and
Φ2 as
Φ1 ≜{Pr1 ̸= 0},
(13.57)
Φ2 ≜{Pr1 = 0},
(13.58)
respectively. Recall our BER analysis carried out for the DAF-aided system in Section 13.2.1.1, where
the end-to-end BER expression of a cooperative system conditioned on the received SNR per bit γb can
be written as
PBER|γb(a, b, L) =
1
22Lπ
 π
−π
f(a, b, L, θ)e−α(θ)γb dθ,
(13.59)
where f(a, b, L, θ) given by Equation (13.18) is a function of the number of multi-path components L
and is independent of the received SNR per bit γb. The parameters a and b are modulation dependent, as
deﬁned in [467]. Consequently, the unconditional end-to-end BER, P Φi
BER, corresponding to the scenario
Φi can be expressed as
P Φi
BER =
 ∞
−∞
PBER|γb
Φi · pγb
Φi (γ) dγ,
(13.60)
where pγb
Φi (γ) represents the PDF of the received SNR per bit after diversity combining at the BS in
the scenario Φi of Equations (13.57) and (13.58).
On the other hand, since the MRC scheme is employed at the BS to combine the signals potentially
forwarded by multiple cooperating MSs and the signal transmitted from the source MS as characterized
by Equation (12.44) using the combining weights of Equation (12.45), the received SNR per bit after
MRC combining is simply the sum of that of each combined path, which is expressed as
γb
Φ1 = γb
sd + γb

(13.61)

Φ2 = γb

(13.62)

Similarly, the BER upper bound can also be attained for cooperative systems relying on Mr > 1
cooperating users. For example, when Mr = 2, the average end-to-end BER upper bound P DDF

becomes the sum of the average BERs of four scenarios expressed as

(13.76)

(13.77)

13.2.2.2
Simulation Results and Discussion
Under the assumption of a relatively rapidly Rayleigh fading channel associated with a normalized
Doppler frequency of fd = 0.008 and a packet length of Lf = 16 DQPSK-modulated symbols, the
BER curves corresponding to DDF-aided cooperative systems with Mr = 1 and Mr = 2 cooperating
MSs are plotted in comparison with the worst-case theoretical BERs of Equations (13.56) and (13.74)
in Figure 13.6(a). Since the worst-case BER expression derived in Section 13.2.2.1 for the DDF-aided
system does not take into account the negative impact of the time-selective channel, the resultant
asymptotic line may not be capable of accurately approximating the true achievable BER performance
of a DDF-aided system employing the CDD in the context of a rapidly fading environment. However,
with the aid of the MSDSD of Section 12.3 using Nwind > 2, the performance loss induced by
the relative mobility of the cooperating terminals and the BS can be signiﬁcantly eliminated. Thus,
as revealed by Figure 13.6(a), the worst-case BER bound closely captures the dependency of the
system’s BER on the P/N0 ratio. On the other hand, the BER curves of DDF-aided cooperative systems
employing the MSDSD using different packet lengths Lf are plotted together with the corresponding
worst-case theoretical BER bound in Figure 13.6(b). Likewise, the theoretical BER bound based on
Equation (13.56) closely captures the dependency of the MSDSD-aided system’s BER on the packet
length Lf employed in the scenario of a rapidly fading channel associated with a normalized Doppler
frequency of fd = 0.008.

CUS for the Uplink
User-cooperation-aided cellular systems are capable of achieving substantial diversity gains by forming
VAAs constituted by the concerted action of distributed mobile users, while eliminating the space
and cost limitations of the shirt-pocket-sized mobile phones. Hence, the cost of implementing user
cooperation in cellular systems is signiﬁcantly reduced, since there is no need speciﬁcally to set
up additional RSs. On the other hand, it is challenging to realize user cooperation in a typical
coherently detected cellular system, since (Nt × Nr) CIRs have to be estimated. For eliminating
the implementationally complex channel estimation, in particular at the RSs, it is desirable to employ
differentially detected modulation schemes in conjunction with the MSDSD scheme of Section 12.3.
Furthermore, even if the Doppler-frequency-induced degradations are eliminated by employing the
MSDSD, another major problem is how to choose the required number of cooperating users from

13.3.1. CUS for DAF Systems with APC

the pool of Pcand available candidates, which may signiﬁcantly affect the end-to-end performance of
the cooperative system. These effects have been observed in our previous simulation results shown in
Figure 12.14 in Section 12.3.2.3, where we indicated that the quality of the source–relay link quantiﬁed
in terms of the SNR, which is dominated by the speciﬁc location of the cooperating users, plays a
vital role in determining the achievable end-to-end performance of a cooperative system. Moreover, the
employment of Adaptive Power Control (APC) among the cooperating users is also important in order
to maximize the achievable transmission efﬁciency. Hence, we will commence our discourse on the
above-mentioned two schemes, namely the CUS and the APC schemes, in the context of the cooperative
uplink, which will be based on the end-to-end performance analysis carried out in Section 13.2. More
speciﬁcally, we will propose a CUS scheme combined with APC for the DAF-aided cooperative system
employing the MSDSD of Section 12.3 and its DDF-aided counterpart in Sections 13.3.1 and 13.3.2,
respectively.

APC for DAF-Aided Systems [609]
As discussed in Section 13.1.2, for the sake of simplicity and analytical tractability, we assume that the
source MS is sufﬁciently far away from the BS and the available cooperating MSs can be considered to
be moving along the direct Line-Of-Sight (LOS) path between them, as speciﬁed by Equation (13.1) of
Section 13.1.2. Explicitly, Equation (13.1) can be rewritten by normalizing Dsd to 1, as follows:
Dsru + Dru d = Dsd = 1,
u = 1, 2, . . . , Pcand,
(13.79)
where Pcand is the RS pool size. This simpliﬁed model is readily generalized to a more realistic
geography by taking into account the angle between the direct link and the relaying links. Furthermore,
given a path-loss exponent of v, the average power σ2
i,j of the channel fading coefﬁcient can be
computed according to Equation (13.3), which is repeated here for convenience:
σ2
i,j = D−v
i,j ,
i, j ∈{s, ru, d}.
(13.80)
Then, by deﬁning
dm ≜Dsru

(13.81)
we can represent σ2
sru and σ2
ru d respectively as
σ2
sru = σ2
sd · dv
m = dv

(13.82)
σ2
rud = σ2
sd · (1 −dm)v = (1 −dm)v.
(13.83)
It was found in Section 13.2.1.2 that the simpler high-SNR-based BER lower-bound expression of
Equation (13.48) associated with Nn = 0 in Equation (13.45) is tight over a wide range of SNRs of
interest, e.g. for SNRs in excess of 15 dB for both the uncoded DBPSK- and DQPSK-modulated DAF-
aided cooperative systems, as observed in Figure 13.5. Therefore, a power control scheme taking into
account the location of the selected cooperating mobile users can be formulated, in order to minimize
the BER of Equation (13.48) under the total transmit power constraint of Equation (13.4), i.e. when we

Therefore, the optimum power control can be obtained by ﬁnding the speciﬁc values of cm (m =

dimensional search as speciﬁed in the summation of Equation (13.100) containing the power control
of each of the Mr cooperating users. Hence, a potentially excessive computational complexity may be
imposed by the search for the optimum power control solution. To reduce the search space signiﬁcantly,
the summation in the last term of Equation (13.100) may be removed, leading to

so that the resultant Equation (13.101) depends only on the speciﬁc cm value of interest. In other
words, the original (Mr + 1)-dimensional search is reduced to a single-dimensional search, resulting
in a substantially reduced power control complexity, while the resultant power control is close to that
corresponding to Equation (13.100).
13.3.1.2
CUS Scheme for DAF-Aided Systems
Since the quality of the relay-related channels, namely the source–relay and the relay–destination links,
dominates the achievable end-to-end performance of a DAF-aided cooperative system, the appropriate

436
Chapter 13. Resource Allocation in Fast Rayleigh Fading Channels
choice of cooperating users from the candidate pool of MSs roaming between the source MS and the
BS as depicted in Figure 13.1 appears to be important in the scenario of cellular systems. In parallel
with the APC scheme designed for the DAF-aided cooperative system discussed in Section 13.3.1.1, the
CUS scheme is devised based on the minimization problem of Equation (13.84), which can be further
simpliﬁed as
[{ ˆdm}Mr
m=1 | Ps, {Prm}Mr
m=1] = arg min
{ ˇ

(13.103)
which is subjected to the physical constraint of having a normalized relay location of 0 < dm < 1
(m = 1, 2, . . . , Mr) measured from the source.
Although Equation (13.103) can be directly solved numerically, it is difﬁcult to get physically
tangible insights from a numerical solution. To simplify further the minimization problem of Equa-
tion (13.103), we deﬁne the function f(dm) by taking the logarithm of the right-hand side of
Equation (13.103), leading to
f(dm) ≜ln

(13.105)
Then, by differentiating Equation (13.105) with respect to the normalized relay locations dm (m =
1, 2, . . . , Mr) and equating the results to zero, we get
∂fdm
∂dm = v(2dm −1)

Prm(1 −dm)v + Psdvm ˜Zrm,min

(13.106)
Hence, the optimum normalized relay distance of dm for a speciﬁc power control can be obtained
by ﬁnding the speciﬁc dm values which satisfy Equation (13.106). Consequently, the original Mr-
dimensional search of Equation (13.103) is broken down into Mr single-dimensional search processes.
Although the optimized location of the cooperating users can be calculated for a given power
control, the resultant location may not be the global optimum in terms of the best achievable BER
performance. In other words, to attain the globally optimum location and then activate the available
cooperating candidates that happen to be closest to the optimum location, an iterative power versus RS
location optimization process has to be performed. To be more speciﬁc, the resultant global optimization
steps are as follows:
Step 1: Initialize the starting point ({cm}Mr
m=1, {dm}Mr
m=1) for the search in the 2Mr-dimensional
space, hosting the Mr powers and RS locations.
Step 2: Calculate the locally optimum location {dm,local}Mr
m=1 of the cooperating users for the current
power control, {cm}Mr
m=1.
Step 3: If we have {dm,local}Mr
m=1 ̸= {dm}Mr
m=1, then let {dm}Mr
m=1 = {dm,local}Mr
m=1. Otherwise,
stop the search, since the globally optimum solution has been found: {dm,global}Mr
m=1
=
{dm,local}Mr
m=1 and {cm,global}Mr
m=1 = {cm}Mr
m=1.

Step 4: Calculate the locally optimum power control {cm,local}Mr
m=1 of the cooperating RSs for the
current location, {dm}Mr
m=1.
Step 5: If we have {cm,local}Mr
m=1 ̸= {cm}Mr
m=1, then let {cm}Mr
m=1 = {cm,local}Mr
m=1 and continue
to Step 1. Otherwise, stop the search, since the globally optimum solution has been found:
{dm,global}Mr
m=1 = {dm,local}Mr
m=1 and {cm,global}Mr
m=1 = {cm}Mr
m=1.
Furthermore, it is worth emphasizing that the above optimization process requires an ‘ofﬂine’ operation.
Hence, its complexity does not contribute to the complexity of the real-time CUS scheme. As mentioned
previously in this section, since it is likely that no available cooperating MS candidate is situated in the
exact optimum location found by the ofﬂine optimization, the proposed CUS scheme simply chooses the
available MS that roams closest to the optimum location and then adaptively adjusts the power control.
The rationale of the CUS scheme is based on the observation that the achievable BER is proportional to
the distance between the cooperating MS and the optimum location, as will be seen in Section 13.3.1.3.
13.3.1.3
Simulation Results and Discussion
Both the APC and CUS schemes designed for the DAF-aided cooperative system, which were devised
in Sections 13.3.1.1 and 13.3.1.2, respectively, are based on the high-SNR-related BER lower bound of
Equation (13.48), which was shown to be a tight bound for a wide range of SNRs in Figure 13.5. In
order to characterize further the proposed APC and CUS schemes and to gain insights into the impact
of power control as well as that of the cooperating user’s location on the end-to-end BER performance
of the DAF-aided uplink supporting different number of cooperating users, the BER lower bounds are
plotted versus Ps/P and dm in Figures 13.7(a) and 13.7(b), respectively, in comparison with the exact
BER of Equation (13.40) and with its upper bound of Equation (13.47). DQPSK modulation is assumed
to be used here. Furthermore, in order to cope with the effects of the rapidly ﬂuctuating fading channel,
the MSDSD scheme of Section 12.3 is employed at the BS. For the sake of simplicity, we assume that
an equal power is allocated to all activated cooperating MSs, which are also assumed to be located at
the same distance from the source MS. All the other system parameters are summarized in Table 13.3.
Observe from both Figures 13.7(a) and 13.7(b) that at a moderate SNR of 15 dB the lower bounds
remain tight across the entire horizontal axes, i.e. regardless of the speciﬁc values of Ps/P and dm.
By contrast, the upper bound of Equation (13.47) fails to predict accurately the associated BER trends,
especially when the number of activated cooperating MSs, Mr, is high. Therefore, despite using the
much simpler optimization metrics of Equations (13.86) and (13.103), which are based on the high-
SNR-related BER lower bound of Equation (13.48), the APC and CUS schemes of Sections 13.3.1.1
and 13.3.1.2 are expected to remain accurate for quite a wide range of SNRs.
Furthermore, both the power control strategy and the speciﬁc location of the cooperating MSs play
a vital role in determining the achievable BER performance of the DAF-aided cooperative system.
Speciﬁcally, as shown in Figure 13.7(a), under the assumption that all the activated cooperating users
are located about half-way between the source MS and the BS, i.e. for dm = 0.5 (m = 1, 2, . . . , Mr),
and for an equal power allocation among the cooperating users, i.e. for Prm = (P −Ps)/Mr
m = 1, 2, . . . , Mr), the minimum of the BER curve is shifted to the left when an increased number
of cooperating MSs participate in signal relaying. This indicates that the transmit power employed by
the source MS should be decreased in order to attain the best achievable end-to-end BER performance.
On the other hand, under the assumption of an equal power allocation among the source MS and all
the cooperating MSs, i.e. where we have Ps = Prm = P/Mr (m = 1, 2, . . . , Mr), we observe
from Figure 13.7(b) that the shape of the BER curves indicates a stronger sensitivity of the system’s
performance to the location of the cooperating users. This trend becomes even more dominant as
the number of cooperating MSs, Mr, increases. However, in contrast to the phenomenon observed
in Figure 13.7(a), the position of the BER minimum remains nearly unchanged, as observed in
Figure 13.7(b), indicating that the optimum location of the cooperating users remains unaffected for
this speciﬁc system arrangement, regardless of Mr.

Importantly, the horizontal coordinate of the BER minimum represents the optimum MS location
for the equal power allocation arrangement employed. Therefore, the achievable BER seen in
Figure 13.7(b) is proportional to the distance between the RS and the optimum location, which provides
the rationale for our distance-based CUS scheme.
In order to examine the tightness of the high-SNR-based BER lower bound of Equation (13.48)
for the DAF-aided cooperative system at different transmit SNRs of P/N0, the BER lower bounds
corresponding to three distinct values of P/N0 versus different power controls and relay locations are
depicted in Figures 13.8(a) and 13.8(b), respectively. Let us assume that Mr = 2 cooperating MSs
are activated. With an SNR as high as 20 dB, the lower bound is tight, as seen in both Figures 13.8(a)
and 13.8(b). As the SNR decreases, the lower bound becomes increasingly loose, but remains capable of
accurately predicting the BER trends and the best achievable performance in the vicinity of a moderate
SNR level of 15 dB. However, when the SNR falls to as low a value as 10 dB, the lower bound remains

no longer tight to approximate the exact BER, thus the APC and CUS schemes devised under the
assumption of a high SNR may not hold the promise of an accurate solution. Nevertheless, since the
low SNR range corresponding to high BER levels, such as for example 10−2, is not within our range
of interest, the proposed APC and CUS schemes of Sections 13.3.1.1 and 13.3.1.2 are expected to work
appropriately for a wide range of SNRs.
Let us now continue by investigating the performance improvements achieved by the optimization
of the power control and the cooperating user’s location. In Figure 13.9(a) the BER performance of
the DAF-aided cooperative system employing the APC scheme of Section 13.3.1.1 is depicted versus
the cooperating user’s location, dm, in comparison with that of the system dispensing with the APC
scheme. Again, we simply assume that multiple activated cooperating users are located at the same
distance from the source user. Observe in Figure 13.9 that signiﬁcant performance improvements can
be achieved by the APC scheme when the cooperating user is situated closer to the BS than to the source
MS. Hence the attainable BER is expected to be improved as the cooperating user moves increasingly
closer to the BS. For example, the single cooperating user (Mr = 1) DAF-aided cooperative system
using the APC scheme is capable of attaining its lowest possible BER at SNR = 15 dB, when we have
d1 = Dsr1/Dsd = 0.8. Therefore, the performance improvement achieved by the APC scheme largely
depends on the speciﬁc location of the cooperating users. Furthermore, the performance gains attained
by the APC scheme for a speciﬁc arrangement of dm is also dependent on the number of activated
cooperating MSs, Mr. More speciﬁcally, when we have Mr = 3, a substantially larger gap is created
between the BER curve of the system dispensing with the APC scheme and that of its APC-aided
counterpart than that observed for Mr = 1, as seen in Figure 13.9(a).
At the same time, the BER performance of the DAF-aided system using relay location optimization
is plotted in Figure 13.9(b) in comparison with that of the cooperative system, where the multiple
activated cooperating users roam midway between the source MS and the BS. Similarly, a potentially
substantial performance gain can be achieved by optimizing the location of the cooperating users,
although, naturally, this gain depends on the speciﬁc power control regime employed as well as on the
number of activated cooperating users. To be speciﬁc, observe in Figure 13.9(b) that it is desirable to
assign the majority of the total transmit power to the source MS in favour of maximizing the achievable

performance gain by location optimization. Moreover, the more the cooperating users are activated, the
higher the performance enhancement attained. Importantly, in the presence of a deﬁcient power control
regime, e.g. when less than 10% of the overall transmit power is assigned to the source MS, the DAF-
aided system may suffer from a severe performance loss, regardless of the location of the cooperating
users. This scenario results in an even worse performance than that of the non-cooperative system.
Therefore, by observing Figures 13.9(a) and 13.9(b) we infer that for the DAF-aided cooperative uplink,
it is beneﬁcial to assign the majority of the total transmit power to the source MS and choose the speciﬁc
cooperating users roaming in the vicinity of the BS in order to enhance the achievable end-to-end BER
performance.
The above observations concerning the cooperative resource allocation of the DAF-aided system
can also be inferred by depicting the three-dimensional BER surface versus both the power control and
the cooperating MS’s location in Figure 13.10(a) for a single-RS-aided cooperative system (Mr = 1).
Indeed, the optimum solution is located in the area where both Ps/P and d1 have high values. In order
to reach the optimum operating point, the iterative optimization process discussed in Section 13.3.1.2
has to be invoked. The resultant optimization trajectory is depicted in Figure 13.10(b) together with
the individual power-optimization- and location-optimization-based curves. The intersection point
of the latter two lines represents the globally optimum joint power–location solution. As seen in
Figure 13.10(b), by commencing the search from the centre of the two-dimensional power–location
plane, the optimization process converges after four iterations between the power and location
optimization phases, as the corresponding trajectory converges on the above-mentioned point of
intersection.
Let us now consider a DAF-aided DQPSK-modulated cooperative cellular system employing both
the CUS and APC schemes of Sections 13.3.1.1 and 13.3.1.2, where Mr = 3 cooperating MSs are
activated in order to amplify and forward the signal received from the source MS to the BS, which
are selected from Pcand = 9 candidates roaming between the latter two. Without loss of generality,
we simply assume that the locations of all the cooperating candidates are independent and uniformly
distributed along the direct LOS link connecting the source MS and the BS, which are expected
to change from time to time. Figure 13.11 depicts the performance of the DAF-aided cooperative

system employing the CUS and APC schemes of Sections 13.3.1.1 and 13.3.1.2 in comparison with
both that exhibited by its counterpart dispensing with the above-mentioned techniques and that of
the direct-transmission-based system operating without user cooperation in Rayleigh fading channels
associated with different normalized Doppler frequencies. Figure 13.11 demonstrates that the DAF-
aided cooperative system is capable of achieving a signiﬁcantly better performance than the non-
cooperative system. Observe in Figure 13.11 that a further signiﬁcant performance gain of 10 dB can
be attained by invoking the CUS and APC schemes for a cooperative system employing the CDD
of Section 12.1.1 (Nwind = 2), at a BER target of 10−5 and a normalized Doppler frequency of
fd = 0.008. Furthermore, employment of the CUS combined with the APC makes the cooperative
cellular system more robust to the deleterious effects of time-selective channels. Indeed, observe in
Figure 13.11 that an error ﬂoor is induced by a normalized Doppler frequency of fd = 0.03 at a
BER of 10−3 for the cooperative system dispensing with the CUS and APC arrangements, while the
BER curve corresponding to the system carrying out cooperative resource allocation only starts to level
out at a BER of 10−5. For the sake of further eliminating the BER degradation caused by severely
time-selective channels, the MSDSD employing Nwind > 2 can be utilized at the BS. As observed
in Figure 13.11, for a target BER level of 10−5, a P/N0 degradation of about 7 dB was induced by
increasing fd from 0.008 to 0.03 for the CDD-aided system, while it was reduced to 1 dB by activating
the MSDSD scheme of Section 12.3 using Nwind = 11.
Let us now consider the BER performance of DAF-aided cooperative systems dispensing with
at least one of the two above-mentioned schemes, which is plotted in Figure 13.12(a). To be more
speciﬁc, given a target BER of 10−5, performance gains of 6 and 2.5 dB can be achieved respectively
by employment of the CUS and APC over the benchmark system, where three cooperating users are
randomly selected from the available nine RS candidates and the total transmit power is equally divided
between the source and the relaying MSs. Hence, the distance-based CUS scheme of Section 13.3.1.2
performs well as a beneﬁt of activating the RS candidates closest to the predetermined optimum
locations, even in conjunction with a relatively small cooperating RS candidate pool, where it is more
likely that none of the available RS candidates is situated in the optimum locations. In order further
to enhance the achievable end-to-end performance, the APC is carried out based on the cooperating
users’ location as activated by the CUS and results in a performance gain as high as about 9.5 dB over

gains, the CUS and APC schemes are also capable of achieving a signiﬁcant complexity reduction in the
context of the MSDSD employed by the BS, as seen in Figure 13.12(b), where the complexity imposed
by the MSDSD using Nwind = 11 expressed in terms of the number of the PED evaluations versus
P/N0 is portrayed correspondingly to the four BER curves of Figure 13.12(a). Although the complexity
imposed by the MSDSD in all of the four scenarios considered decreases steadily, the transmit SNR
increases and then levels out at a certain SNR value around 20 dB. Observe in Figure 13.12(b) that a
reduced complexity is imposed when either the CUS or the APC scheme is employed. Remarkably, the
complexity imposed by the MSDSD at the BS can be reduced by a factor of about 10 for a wide range
of transmit SNRs, when the CUS and APC are amalgamated. By carefully comparing the simulation
results of Figures 13.12(a) and 13.12(b), it may be readily observed that the transmit SNR level, which
guarantees the BER of 10−5, is roughly the SNR level at which the complexity imposed by the MSDSD
starts to level out. Therefore, it is inferred from the above observations that an appropriate cooperative
resource allocation expressed in terms of the transmit power control and the appropriate cooperating
user selection may signiﬁcantly enhance the achievable end-to-end BER performance of the DAF-aided
cooperative cellular uplink, while substantially reducing the computing power required by the MSDSD
at the BS.
In a typical cellular system, the number of users roaming in a cell may also be referred to as the
size of the cooperating user candidate pool denoted by Pcand in the scenario of the user-cooperative
uplink. In order to investigate its impacts on the end-to-end BER performance of the DAF-aided
cooperative system employing the CUS and APC schemes, the BER curves corresponding to different
values of Pcand are plotted versus the transmit SNR, P/N0, against that of the idealized scenario used
as a benchmark, where the activated RSs are situated exactly in the optimum locations and have the
optimum power control. Again, we assume that Mr = 3 RSs are activated, which are selected from
the Pcand MSs roaming in the same cell. Interestingly, despite having a ﬁxed number of activated

cooperating MSs, the end-to-end BER performance of the DAF-aided system steadily improves and
approaches that of the idealized benchmark system upon increasing the value of Pcand, as observed
in Figure 13.13(a). On the other hand, it can be seen in Figure 13.13(b) that the higher the number of
cooperating candidates, the lower the computational complexity imposed by the MSDSD at the BS.
Speciﬁcally, by increasing the size of the candidate pool from Pcand = 3 to 9, a performance gain of
about 7 dB can be attained, while simultaneously achieving a detection complexity reduction factor of
6.5 at the target BER of 10−5. In comparison with the idealized scenario, where an inﬁnite number of
cooperating candidates are assumed to be independently and uniformly distributed between the source
MS and the BS, the DAF-aided cooperative system using both the CUS and APC schemes only suffers
a negligible performance loss when Pcand = 9 cooperating candidates. Therefore, the beneﬁts brought
about by the employment of the CUS and APC schemes may be deemed substantial in a typical cellular
uplink.
13.3.2
CUS Scheme for DDF Systems with APC
In contrast to the process of obtaining the optimum power and location allocation arrangements
discussed in Section 13.3.1 for DAF-aided cooperative systems, the ﬁrst-order conditions obtained by
differentiating the BER bound of a DDF-aided cooperative system formulated in Equations (13.56)
and (13.74) for the Mr = 1 and Mr = 2 scenarios have complicated forms which are impervious to
analytical solution. However, their numerical solution is feasible, instead of resorting to Monte Carlo
simulations. Explicitly, by taking Mr = 1 as an example, the optimum power control can be obtained
for a given RS location arrangement by minimizing the worst-case BER of Equation (13.56), yielding

Then, to attain the globally optimum location and activate the available cooperating candidates that
happen to be closest to the optimum location, an iterative power versus RS location optimization process
identical to that discussed in Section 13.3.1.2 in the context of an AF scheme has to be performed.
Again, the rationale of the proposed CUS scheme for the DDF-aided system is based on the observation
that the achievable BER is proportional to the distance between the cooperating MS and the optimum
location, as will be demonstrated in Section 13.3.2.1.
13.3.2.1
Simulation Results and Discussion
The beneﬁcial effects of cooperative resource allocation, in terms of the transmit power and the
cooperating user’s location on the achievable BER performance of the DDF-aided cooperative system,
are investigated in Figure 13.14. Under the assumption that the channel ﬂuctuates extremely slowly, e.g.
for fd = 0.0001, the worst-case BER performances corresponding to Equation (13.56) for Mr = 1 and
to Equation (13.74) for Mr = 2, for the DQPSK-modulated DDF-aided cooperative systems employing
either equal power allocation or the optimized power control, are plotted versus the different cooperating
users’ locations in Figure 13.14(a). The information bit stream is CCITT-4 coded by the source MS in
order to carry out the CRC checking at the cooperating MS with the aid of a 32-bit CRC sequence.
Hence, to maintain a relatively high effective throughput, two different transmission packet lengths are
used, namely Lf = 128 and Lf = 64 DQPSK symbols. All other system parameters are summarized
in Table 13.3. Observe in Figure 13.14(a) that the end-to-end BER performance can be substantially
enhanced by employing the optimized power control, if the cooperating MS is not roaming in the
neighbourhood of the source MS. Similar to the observation obtained for its DAF-aided counterparts

characterized in Figure 13.9(a) of Section 13.3.1.3, the higher the number of active cooperating MSs,
Mr, the more signiﬁcant the performance gain attained by optimizing the power control for the DDF-
aided system. However, due to the difference between the relaying mechanisms employed by the two
above-mentioned cooperative systems, it is interesting to observe that the trends seen in Figure 13.14(a)
are quite different from those emerging from Figure 13.9(a). Speciﬁcally, recall from the results depicted
in Figure 13.9(a) that it is desirable to choose multiple cooperating users closer to the BS than to the
source MS in a DAF-aided cooperative system, especially when employing the optimized power control
for sharing the power among the cooperating users. By contrast, Figure 13.14(a) demonstrates that
the cooperating MSs roaming in the vicinity of the source MS are preferred for a DDF-aided system
in the interest of maintaining a better BER performance. Furthermore, the performance gap between
the DAF-aided systems employing both the equal and optimized power allocations becomes wider as

446
Chapter 13. Resource Allocation in Fast Rayleigh Fading Channels
the cooperating MS moves closer to the optimum location corresponding to the horizontal coordinate
of the lowest-BER point in Figure 13.9(a). By contrast, only a negligible performance improvement
can be achieved by optimizing the power control, if the cooperating MS is close to the optimum
location corresponding also to the horizontal coordinate of the lowest-BER point in Figure 13.14(a).
In other words, the DDF-aided system suffers a relatively modest performance loss by employing the
simple equal power allocation, if the multiple cooperating MSs are closer to their desired locations.
Additionally, recall from Figure 13.9(a) recorded for the DAF-aided system that the worst-case BER
performance was encountered by having no cooperating user closer to the optimum locations, regardless
of whether the optimum power control is used or not, but the performance of this RS-aided DAF
system was still slightly better than that of the conventional direct transmission system. By contrast,
the DDF-aided system employing equal power allocation may unfortunately be outperformed by the
direct-transmission-based non-cooperative system, if the cooperating MSs are located nearer to the BS
than to the source MS. Finally, in contrast to the DAF-assisted system, the performance achieved by
the DDF-aided system is dependent on the speciﬁc packet length, Lf, due to the potential relaying
deactivation controlled by the CRC check carried out at the cooperating MS. To be speciﬁc, the shorter
the packet length Lf, the lower the resultant BER.
In parallel, the BER performance of the above-mentioned DDF-aided systems is depicted versus
Ps/P in Figure 13.14(b). Here, the transmit power of (P −Ps) is assumed to be equally shared
across multiple cooperating users. Again, similar to the results recorded for the DAF-aided system
in Figure 13.9(b), a signiﬁcant performance gain can be attained by locating the cooperating MS at the
optimum position rather than in the middle of the source MS and BS path. This performance gain is
expected to become even higher as the number of actively cooperating MSs, Mr, increases, as seen in
Figure 13.14(b). By contrast, for optimum cooperating user location, instead of allocating the majority
of the total transmit power to the source MS – as was suggested by Figure 13.9(b) for the DAF-aided
system in the interest of achieving an improved BER performance – the results of Figure 13.14(b)
suggest that only about half of the total power has to be assigned to the source MS, if the DDF scheme
is used. Furthermore, the mild sensitivity of the BER performance observed in Figure 13.14(b) for the
DDF-aided system beneﬁting from the optimum cooperating user location as far as the power control
is concerned coincides with the trends seen in Figure 13.14(a), i.e. a desirable BER performance can
still be achieved without optimizing the power control, provided that all the cooperating MSs roam
in the vicinity of their optimum locations. Interestingly, in contrast to the conclusions inferred from
Figure 13.14(a) for the DAF-aided system, the originally signiﬁcant performance differences caused
by the different packet lengths of Lf = 128 and Lf = 64 can be substantially reduced for the
DDF-aided system, provided that the cooperating user is situated at the optimum location. Finally, as
observed in Figure 13.14(b), when no active RS can be found in the vicinity of the optimum cooperating
user locations, the DDF-aided system might be outperformed by its more simple direct transmission
counterpart in the presence of deﬁcient power control imposed by high power control errors.
Observe for the Mr = 1 scenario by merging Figures 13.14(a) and 13.14(b) that the globally
optimum cooperative resource allocation characterized in terms of the transmit power control and RS
selection regime can be visualized as the horizontal coordinates of the lowest point of the resultant 3D
BER surface portrayed in Figure 13.15(a), where the 3D BER surface corresponding to different Lf
values is plotted versus Ps/P and d1 = Dsr1/Dsd for the DDF-aided cooperative system. The smaller
the packet length Lf, the lower the BER. This is because the likelihood that the activated cooperating
MS improves the signal relaying is inversely proportional to the packet length Lf. However, observe in
Figure 13.15(a) that the gap between the different BER curves of 3D surface becomes relatively small
in the vicinity of the globally optimum BER point, as predicted by Figures 13.14(a) and 13.14(b). On
the other hand, similar to the results of Figure 13.10(b) recorded for the DAF-aided cooperative system,
we plot the power-optimized curve versus d1, while drawing the location-optimized curve versus Ps/P
for the DDF-aided system associated with Mr = 1 in Figure 13.15(b), where the intersection of the
two curves is the globally optimum solution corresponding to the projection of the lowest BER point
onto the horizontal plane in Figure 13.15(a). The globally optimum solution can be found by the joint

power–location iterative optimization process discussed in Section 13.3.1.2. Furthermore, the globally
optimum resource allocation, denoted by the black dot in Figure 13.15(b), changes as the packet length
Lf varies. To be more speciﬁc, by increasing the packet length Lf, the optimum cooperating user
location moves increasingly closer to the source MS, while the percentage of the total transmit power
assigned to the source MS gradually decreases. This is not unexpected, since the probability of perfectly
recovering all the symbols of the source MS by the cooperating MS is reduced on employing a higher
packet length Lf, which has to be increased by choosing a cooperating MS closer to the source MS in
the interest of increasing the received SNR at the cooperating MS.
Let us now continue by examining the BER performance improvement achieved by optimizing the
resource allocation for the DDF-aided cooperative system in Figure 13.16, where the four subﬁgures
depict the BER performance of the systems both with and without optimized cooperative resource
allocation in terms of the transmit power and relay locations, while varying the packet length Lf.
As seen in Figure 13.16, signiﬁcant performance gains can be attained by using an optimum power
control among the Mr cooperating users and the source user, as well as by assuming that all the Mr
actively cooperating users are situated in their optimum locations, especially when we have a relatively
large packet length Lf. Although a better PLR performance is attained when using short packets, the
achievable performance gain is reduced, as indicated by the increasingly narrower gap between the BER
curves obtained with and without the optimized resource allocation. Consider the Mr = 2 scenario
as an example, where the originally achievable performance gain of 5 dB recorded for Lf = 128 is
reduced to about 0.5 dB for Lf = 16 at a BER of 10−5. In fact, this phenomenon coincides with the
observation inferred from our previous simulation results, such as for example the 3D BER surface
shown in Figure 13.15(a), which can be explained by the fact that the BER and PLR performance
loss induced by a high packet length Lf may be signiﬁcantly reduced by optimizing the cooperative
resource allocation. Again for the scenario of Mr = 2, a performance loss of 5 dB is endured when
employing Lf = 64 instead of Lf = 16 in the absence of resource allocation optimization, whereas
the performance loss is reduced to 1.5 dB when the cooperative resource allocation is optimized.
Furthermore, we also found that, interestingly, the asymptotic theoretical curves based on the worst-
case BER expressions of Equation (13.56) and Equation (13.74) for Mr = 1 and Mr = 2, respectively,
become tighter for the DDF-aided system using optimized resource allocation.

Figure 13.17 separately investigates the impact of the CUS and that of the APC on the end-to-end
BER performance of a DDF-aided cooperative system employing the MSDSD in a relatively rapidly
Rayleigh fading channel associated with fd = 0.008, where Nwind = 8 is employed to combat
the performance degradation induced by the time-selective fading channel. Similar to the results of
Figure 13.12(a) recorded for the DAF-aided system, a more signiﬁcant performance improvement can
be attained by invoking CUS than APC. However, in contrast to the DAF-aided system, the joint
employment of the CUS and APC schemes for the DDF-aided system only leads to a negligible
additional performance gain over the scenario where only the CUS is carried out. This is not unexpected,
if we recall the observations inferred from Figure 13.14(a), i.e. the additional performance improvement
achieved by optimizing the power control gradually erodes as the activated cooperating MS approaches
the optimum location. Furthermore, unlike the CUS scheme, which simply selects the cooperating

conducts a real-time search for the optimum power control based on the actual location of the activated
cooperating MS, may impose an excessive complexity. Hence, for reducing the complexity, the DDF-
aided cooperative system may simply employ equal power allocation, while still being capable of
achieving a desirable performance with the aid of the CUS scheme.

Joint CPS and CUS for the Differential Cooperative
Cellular UL Using APC
From our discussions on the performance of the DAF- and DDF-aided cooperative cellular uplink in
Sections 13.3.1.3 and 13.3.2.1, respectively, we may conclude that the above-mentioned two scenarios
exhibit numerous distinct characteristics due to the employment of different relaying mechanisms.
Therefore, the comparison of these two cooperative schemes will be further detailed in Section 13.4.1.
Based on the initial comparison of the DAF and DDF schemes, a novel hybrid CPS scheme will be
proposed in Section 13.4.2. In conjunction with the CUS and APC arrangements, we will then create a
more ﬂexible cooperative system, where the multiple cooperating MSs roaming in different areas might
employ different relaying mechanisms to assist in forwarding the source MS’s message to the BS to
achieve the best possible BER performance. This system may be viewed as a sophisticated hybrid of a
BS-aided ad hoc network or – alternatively – as an ad hoc network-assisted cellular network.

13.4.1.1
Sensitivity to the Source–Relay Link Quality
The fundamental difference between the DAF and DDF schemes is whether decoding and re-encoding
operations are required at the RS or not. Thus, generally speaking, the overall complexity imposed
by the DDF-aided cooperative system is expected to be higher than that of its DAF-aided counterpart.
However, as a beneﬁt of preventing error propagation by the RS, the DDF-aided system is expected to
outperform the DAF-aided one, provided that a sufﬁciently high source–relay link quality guarantees a
near-error-free transmission between the source MS and the RS, as previously indicated by Figure 12.14
of Section 12.3.2.3. For convenience, we repeat these results here in Figure 13.18, where we observe
that the sensitivity of the DDF-aided system to the source–relay link quality is signiﬁcantly higher than
that of the DAF-aided system. This is because the CRC employed may suggest to the RS to refrain from
participating in forwarding the signal to the BS with a high probability, when the source–relay link is
of low quality, which in turn leads to a rapid performance degradation. In practice, a high performance
can be achieved for the DDF-aided system by activating the cooperating MSs roaming in the vicinity of
the source MS and/or by invoking channel encoding.
13.4.1.2
Effect of the Packet Length
In contrast to the DAF-aided system, where the achievable performance is independent of the packet
length Lf employed in the absence of the channel encoding, the DDF-aided system’s performance
is sensitive to the packet length Lf, as was previously demonstrated for example by Figure 13.16 of
Section 13.3.2.1. This trend is not unexpected, since in the absence of the channel coding the PLR
increases proportional to the value of Lf. This in turn may precipitate errors in the context of a DDF-

aided system. However, this performance degradation can be substantially reduced by invoking the CUS
of Section 13.3.2, as evidenced by Figure 13.14.
13.4.1.3
Cooperative Resource Allocation
As demonstrated by the simulation results of Sections 13.3.1.3 and 13.3.2.1, signiﬁcant performance
gains can be attained for both the DAF- and DDF-aided cellular uplink by optimizing the associated
cooperative resource allocation with the aid of the CUS and APC schemes of Section 13.3. More
explicitly, the BER performance of both the above-mentioned systems operating with and without the
CUS and APC schemes is contrasted in Figure 13.19, where it is assumed that the Mr = 2 out of the
Pcand = 8 available cooperating MS candidates are activated and the MSDSD of Section 12.3 using
Nwind = 11 is employed in order to eliminate the detrimental effects of the fading having a Doppler
frequency of fd = 0.008. Moreover, the variance of the noise added at each terminal of the cooperative
system is assumed to be identical, namely N0. Indeed, as seen in Figure 13.19, the performance of both
the DAF and DDF systems is signiﬁcantly enhanced by the employment of the CUS and APC schemes.
We also note that the DAF-assisted system exhibits a better performance than the DDF-aided one, when
the SNR of P/N0 is relatively low, while the former is expected to be outperformed by the latter, as the
SNR of P/N0 is in excess of 20 dB. Again, this trend is not unexpected, since the sensitivity of the BER
performance to the source–relay link’s quality leads to a more rapid BER decrease upon increasing the
SNR of P/N0.
On the other hand, we also observed in Table 13.5 that, due to the distinct relaying mechanisms
which lead to different levels of sensitivity to the quality of the source–relay link, the desirable
cooperative resource allocation arrangement for the DAF-aided system may be quite different from that
of its DDF-aided counterpart. As indicated by the RS’s location arrangement of [d1, d2, . . . , dMr] seen
in Table 13.5, the cooperating MSs roaming in the area near the BS are expected to be activated for the
DAF-aided cooperative uplink, while those roaming in the neighbourhood of the source MS should be

selected for its DDF-aided counterpart in the interest of achieving the best possible BER performance.
It is also indicated in Table 13.5 that the increase of the SNR, P/N0, or the number of activated
cooperating MSs, Mr, will move the desirable RS’s location slightly further away from the source
MS towards the BS for both the DAF- and DDF-aided scenarios. As for the optimized power control,
the majority of the total transmit power P, i.e. about 88%, should be allocated to the source MS for the
DAF-aided system, as revealed by the optimized power control arrangement of [Ps, Pr1, . . . , PrMr ]
seen in Table 13.5. By contrast, only about 60% of the power should be assigned to the source MS
for the DDF-aided system. It is noteworthy that the optimized transmit power assigned to the Mr RSs
as well as their optimum locations are not expected to be identical in both the DAF- and DDF-aided
scenarios, as revealed in Table 13.5.
Furthermore, by comparing Figure 13.12(a) of Section 13.3.1.3 and Figure 13.17 of Section
13.3.2.1, we observe that a signiﬁcant performance degradation may occur if the DAF-aided system
dispenses with either the CUS or the APC scheme. By contrast, only a negligible performance loss is
imposed when the DDF-aided system dispenses with the APC scheme rather than with the CUS scheme.
Additionally, the CUS scheme of Section 13.3.2 is carried out by selecting the cooperating MSs roaming
in the area closest to the optimum locations which may be determined ofﬂine, i.e. before initiating a
voice call or data session. By contrast, the APC scheme of Section 13.3.2 may impose a relatively high
real-time complexity, when calculating the optimum power control arrangement based on the current
location of the activated RS. Hence, to minimize the complexity imposed by the cooperative resource
allocation process, the DDF-aided system employing the CUS scheme may dispense with APC, simply
opting for the equal power allocation arrangement at the expense of a moderate performance loss. In
contrast to the DDF scheme, the DAF-aided system has to tolerate a high BER performance degradation
if it dispenses with the APC scheme. It is also noteworthy that in contrast to the DAF-aided cooperative
system, the DDF-assisted scheme employing neither the CUS nor the APC may be outperformed by the
classic non-cooperative system, as observed in Figure 13.14, which is a consequence of its sensitivity
to the quality of the source–relay link.
13.4.2
Joint CPS and CUS Scheme for the Cellular UL Using APC
Each cooperative cellular uplink considered so far in the book employed either DAF or DDF principles.
As argued in the context of Figure 13.20, they both have their desirable RS area, when the CUS is
employed. Generally speaking, the neighbourhood of the BS and that of the source MS are the speciﬁc
areas where the RS should be activated for the DAF- and DDF-aided scenarios, respectively, again as
discussed in Sections 13.3.1 and 13.3.2. Thus, often no available cooperating MS is roaming in the

13.4.2. Joint CPS and CUS Scheme for the Cellular UL Using APC
453
desirable RS location area, and hence a performance loss may be imposed by selecting a cooperating
MS roaming far away from the optimum RS location. Furthermore, although the DDF-aided system
exhibits a better performance than its DAF-aided counterpart in the presence of a high source–relay
link quality, the former may be outperformed by the latter, as the quality of the source–relay link
degrades despite imposing a higher overall system complexity. On the other hand, from our comparison
of the DAF- and DDF-aided cooperative systems in Section 13.4.1, we realized that the two above-
mentioned relaying mechanisms have complementary characteristics, reﬂected, for example, by their
distinct optimum cooperative resource allocations. In light of the complementarity of the two relaying
schemes, a more ﬂexible cooperative scenario can be created, where either the DAF or DDF scheme
is activated in the interest of enhancing the achievable performance of the cooperative system, while
maintaining a moderate complexity. In contrast to the conventional cooperative system employing a
single cooperative mechanism, the cooperating MSs roaming in different areas between the source MS
and the BS may be activated and the relay schemes employed by each activated RS may be adaptively
selected, to achieve the best possible performance.
For the sake of simplicity, let us now consider the hybrid cooperative cellular uplink employing the
joint CPS and CUS scheme, as portrayed in Figure 13.20, where Mr = 2 cooperating MSs roaming in
the preferred DDF- and the DAF-RS-area are activated, in order to forward the source MS’s information
to the BS. The particular cooperative protocol employed by the activated RSs is determined according to
the speciﬁc area in which they happen to be situated. In order to make the most of the complementarity
of the DAF and DDF schemes, it may be assumed that one of the cooperating MSs is activated in the
preferred area of the DAF-RS, while the other is from the ‘DDF-area’, although, naturally, there may be
more than one cooperating MS roaming within a speciﬁc desirable area. Finally, under the assumption
that the ﬁrst selected cooperating MS is roaming in the ‘DDF-area’, while the second one is roaming in
the ‘DAF-area’, the MRC scheme employed by the BS, which combines the signals received from the
source MS and the cooperating MSs, can be expressed as
y = a0(ysd[n −1])∗ysd[n] +
2

m=1
am(yrmd[n + mLf −1])∗yrmd[n + mLf],
(13.109)
where Lf is the length of the transmission packet, while the coefﬁcients a0 and am (m = 1, 2) are
given by
a0 = a1 = 1
N0
(13.110)
and
a2 =
Psσ2
sr2 + N0
N0(Psσ2sr2 + Pr2σ2
r2d + N0).
(13.111)
In order to determine the optimum RS areas for the hybrid cooperative system employing Mr = 2
cooperating users, the worst-case BER expression will ﬁrst be derived in a similar manner to that derived
for the DDF-aided system of Section 13.2.1 in our following discourse.
First of all, let us deﬁne the scenario Φ1 as the situation when the cooperating MS employing the
DDF scheme perfectly recovers the information from the source MS and then transmits the differentially
remodulated signal to the BS, which is formulated as
Φ1 ≜{Pr1 ̸= 0}.
(13.112)
By contrast, the scenario Φ2 is deﬁned as the situation, when the cooperating MS using the DDF scheme
fails to correctly decode the signal received from the source MS and keeps silent during the relay phase,
which can be formulated as
Φ2 ≜{Pr1 = 0}.

average end-to-end BER upper bound, P CPS

of two scenarios as
P CPS

(13.129)
Hence, when using the minimum BER criterion, the desirable RS area can be located by ﬁnding the
globally optimum RS locations using the iterative power versus RS location optimization process of
Sections 13.3.2 or 13.3.2. Considering the Mr = 2 scenario as an example, the globally optimum power
and distance allocation arrangements are summarized in Table 13.6 under the assumption that the ﬁrst
cooperating MS is activated in the DDF mode. As expected, the ﬁgures shown in Table 13.6 reveal
that the ‘DDF-area’ and the ‘DAF-area’ are still located in the vicinity of the source MS and the BS,
respectively. Additionally, the majority of the total transmit power, i.e. about 70%, should be allocated
to the source MS, while two-thirds of the remaining power should be assigned to the cooperating MS
roaming in the ‘DDF-area’.
The BER performance of the hybrid cooperative cellular uplink, where Mr = 2 out of Pcand = 8
cooperating MSs are activated, is portrayed in comparison with that of its DAF- and DDF-aided
counterparts in Figure 13.21. Remarkably, as demonstrated by Figure 13.21, the hybrid cooperative
system outperforms both the DAF- and DDF-aided systems, regardless of whether the joint CPS–
CUS–APC scheme is employed. These conclusions remain valid across a wide SNR range of our
interest, although the performance advantage of the hybrid scheme over the latter two systems decreases
in the context of the joint CPS–CUS–APC scheme. Furthermore, as the SNR increases, the DDF-
aided system is expected to become superior to the other two systems, since the DDF-aided system

performs best when error-free transmissions can be assumed between the source MS and the RS. By
contrast, if the SNR is low, the DAF-aided system performs best among the three. In addition to the
performance advantage of the joint CPS–CUS–APC hybrid cooperative system, the overall system
complexity becomes moderate in comparison with that of the DDF-aided system, since only half of
the activated MSs have to decode and re-encode the received signal prior to forwarding it. Therefore,
the proposed hybrid cooperative system employing the joint CPS–CUS–APC scheme is capable of
achieving an attractive performance, despite maintaining a moderate overall system complexity.
13.5
Chapter Conclusions
In this chapter, CUS schemes and APC schemes designed for both the DAF- and DDF-aided cooperative
systems were investigated based on our theoretical performance analysis. Signiﬁcant performance gains
can be achieved with the aid of the optimized resource allocation arrangements for both the DAF- and
DDF-aided systems. Owing to the different levels of sensitivity to the quality of the source–relay link,
the optimum resource allocation arrangements corresponding to the two above-mentioned systems were
shown to be quite different. Speciﬁcally, it is desirable that the activated cooperating MSs are roaming
in the vicinity of the source MS for the DDF-aided system, while the cooperating MSs roaming in the
neighbourhood of the BS are preferred for the DAF-aided counterpart. In comparison with the former
system, a larger portion of the total transmit power should be allocated to the source MS in the context
of a DAF-aided system. Apart from achieving an enhanced BER performance, the complexity imposed
by the MSDSD of Chapter 12 may also be signiﬁcantly reduced by employing the CUS and APC
schemes, even in the context of rapidly fading channels. Based on the simulation results throughout this
chapter, the natures of the DAF- and DDF-aided systems are summarized and compared in Table 13.7.

Furthermore, in order to make the most of the complementarity of the two above-mentioned cooperative
systems, a more ﬂexible resource-optimized adaptive hybrid cooperation-aided system was proposed
in this chapter, where the cooperative protocol employed by a speciﬁc cooperating MS may also be
adaptively selected in the interest of achieving the best possible BER performance.
Finally, we quantitatively summarize and compare the performance gains achieved by the DAF-
aided, the DDF-aided as well as the hybrid cooperative systems over the direct-transmission-based
system in Table 13.8, based on the simulation results obtained throughout the chapter. Observe in
Table 13.8 that, given a target BER of 10−3, the DAF-aided cooperative system is capable of achieving
a slightly higher performance gain than that attained by its DDF-aided counterpart, regardless of the
employment of the optimized resource allocation. However, given a target BER of 10−5, the latter
becomes capable of achieving performance gains of 2 and 1.2 dB over the former for the non-optimized
and optimized resource allocation arrangements, respectively, as seen in Table 13.8. Furthermore,

458
Chapter 13. Resource Allocation in Fast Rayleigh Fading Channels
among the three types of cooperative systems investigated in this chapter, the adaptive hybrid DAF/DDF
cooperative system performs the best for a wide range of SNRs. Remarkably, as observed in Table 13.8,
the hybrid cooperative system is capable of achieving performance gains over its direct-transmission-
based counterpart, which are as high as 12.4 and 27.7 dB for the BER targets of 10−3 and 10−5,
respectively, when the optimized resource allocation is employed.

Introduction
In point-to-point communication systems using a single antenna or co-located multiple antennas, it is
feasible to achieve a high spectral efﬁciency by approaching Shannon’s capacity limit with the aid of
channel coding, as argued in Chapter 10. However, in contrast to the well-understood limitations of
point-to-point single-user transmissions, researchers are only beginning to understand the fundamental
performance limits of wireless multi-user networks, such as, for example, the cooperative cellular
uplink considered in Chapters 12 and 13. To be more speciﬁc, in the scenarios of the uncoded
DAF as well as DDF cooperative cellular uplinks, the best achievable BER performance can be
approached by optimizing both the power control and the cooperating user selection, as discussed
in Chapter 13. Naturally, the resultant cooperative system’s performance is expected to be better
than that of non-cooperative transmission. The attainable transmit diversity gains as well as path-
loss reduction achieved by the cooperative relay-aided system were considered in Chapter 13, which
translate into substantially enhanced robustness against fading for a given transmit power, or into
a signiﬁcantly reduced transmit power requirement for the same BER performance. However, the
transmit diversity gains or cooperative diversity gains promised by the cooperative system considered
are actually achieved at the cost of suffering a signiﬁcant multiplexing loss compared with direct
transmissions, which is imposed by the half-duplex communications of practical transceivers. More
explicitly, realistic transceivers cannot transmit and receive simultaneously, because at a typical transmit
power of, say, 0 dB and receiver sensitivity of −100 dBm the transmit power leakage imposed by the
slightest power ampliﬁer nonlinearity would leak into the receiver’s Automatic Gain Control (AGC)
circuit and would saturate it. Hence, the saturated AGC would become desensitized against low-power
received signals. Furthermore, the cooperative diversity gains achieved by the relay-aided system over
its direct-transmission-based counterpart may become modest in practical channel-coded scenarios,
where the interleaving and channel coding gains dominate. Therefore, when a cooperative wireless
communication system is designed to approach the maximum achievable spectral efﬁciency by taking
the cooperation-induced multiplexing loss into account, it is not obvious whether or not the repetition-

based relay-aided system becomes superior to its direct-transmission-based counterpart, especially
when advanced channel coding techniques are employed. In other words, in the interest of achieving
a high spectral efﬁciency, we have to answer the grave fundamental question: is it worth introducing
cooperative mechanisms into the development of wireless networks?
14.1.1
System Architecture and Channel Model
14.1.1.1
System Model
Since the realistic condition of having an imperfect source–relay communication link is taken into
account, the predominant DF as well as AF protocols employed may suffer from potential error
propagation and noise enhancement, respectively, as observed in Chapters 12 and 13 where no channel
coding was used. Fortunately, due to the advances of channel coding, well-designed channel-coded
DF schemes are capable of guaranteeing near-error-free SR transmissions without noise enhancement,
which in turn typically results in a superior performance in contrast to their AF-aided counterparts. In
this context, only the differentially encoded and non-coherently detected DF-aided cooperative system
dispensing with channel estimation will be investigated in the context of channel coding in this chapter.
Naturally, in this scenario a more advanced channel-coded RS is required. Examples of channel-coded
cooperative system designs may be found in [612, 613], although these contributions used coherent
detection. To be consistent with the system model employed in Chapters 12 and 13, the differentially
modulated TDMA cellular uplink is considered without any loss of generality, where no ICR estimation
is required. For the sake of simplicity, we consider a single-relay-assisted scenario, where only one
cooperating MS is activated in order to decode and re-encode the signal received from the source MS
prior to forwarding the signal to the BS. Again, we simply assume the employment of a single antenna
for each terminal, owing to the cost and size constraints of portable transceivers. Although we revealed
in Chapter 13 that an optimized transmit power control and RS selection scheme may result in an
enhanced end-to-end BER performance for the uncoded DDF-aided system, we simply assume here that
the total transmit power is equally divided between the source MS and the single cooperating RS, which
is assumed to be located half-way between the source MS and the BS, as depicted in Figure 14.1. This
is because the emphasis in this chapter is on investigating the achievable network capacity of a general
repetition-coded cooperative scenario and on techniques of approaching it. More speciﬁcally, for the
sake of analytical tractability, we simply assume that the sum of the normalized distances Dsr between
the source MS and the RS, and that between the RS and the destination BS, which is represented by Drd,
is equal to the normalized distance Dsd between the source MS and the BS. Naturally, the normalized
SD distance is equal to unity. As a result, observe in Figure 14.1 that we have
Dsr = Drd = 1
2Dsd = 1.
(14.1)
Furthermore, as seen in Equation (13.3), the normalized average power σ2
i,j at the output of the channel
is inversely proportional to the internode distance Di,j, which is rewritten as follows:
σ2
i,j = D−v
i,j ,
i, j ∈{s, r, d},
(14.2)
where v denotes the path-loss exponent [607] and the subscripts s, r and d represent the source, relay
and destination, respectively. Additionally, under the assumption of having a total transmit power of P
and an equal power allocation among the source and cooperating MSs, we may express the associated
power constraint as
Ps = Pr = 1
2P,
(14.3)
where Ps and Pr are the transmit power of the source and cooperating MSs, respectively.

14.1.1.2
Channel Model
Throughout this chapter we assume that the complex-valued baseband signals undergo Rayleigh fading,
which is modelled by multiplying the transmitted signal by a complex-valued Gaussian random variable.
In order to provide a good approximation for TDMA-based cooperative systems and to facilitate
the study of the non-coherent detection-based channel capacity, we consider a block-fading Rayleigh
channel, where the fading coefﬁcients are assumed to change in an i.i.d. manner from block to block.
This assumption allows us to focus our attention on a single fading block [614,615]. On the other hand,
instead of employing the standard block-fading channel, where the fading coefﬁcient remains constant
over the duration of several consecutive symbol periods, we consider here a time-selective block-fading
model [616], which includes the former as a special case. In the time-selective block-fading channel
model considered, the channel’s envelope exhibits correlation within a transmission block according to
the Doppler frequency induced by the relative movement of the transceivers.
Consider a single-antenna-assisted point-to-point transmission scheme communicating over a
block-fading channel which exhibits a correlated envelope for the duration of Tb consecutive symbols.
Then, the received signal may be formulated as
y = Sdh + w,
(14.4)
where
y = [y1, y2, . . . , yTb]T ,
(14.5)
h = [h1, h2, . . . , hTb]T
(14.6)
and
w = [w1, w2, . . . , wTb]T
(14.7)
representing the received signal column vector, the fading coefﬁcient column vector obeying a complex-
valued Gaussian distribution CN(0, σ2
h) and the Gaussian noise column vector having a distribution
of CN(0, 2σ2
w), respectively. The diagonal elements of the matrix Sd in Equation (14.4) may be

which represents the Tb consecutively transmitted signals within a fading block. Furthermore, in the

Chapter Contributions and Outline
Against the aforementioned background, the main objectives of this chapter are to investigate the
necessity of introducing the cooperative mechanisms of Figure 14.1 into wireless networks, such
as cellular voice and data networks. This design dilemma may be approached both from a pure
capacity perspective and from the practical perspective of approaching the Discrete-input, Continuous-
output Memoryless Channel (DCMC) capacity of the cooperative network. More speciﬁcally, the novel
contributions of this chapter are as follows:
• From a pure capacity perspective, we answer the grave fundamental dilemma of whether it is
worth incorporating cooperative mechanisms into wireless networks.
• A novel Irregular Distributed Hybrid Concatenated Differential (Ir-DHCD) coding scheme is
proposed for the DDF cooperative system, in order to maximize the system’s spectral efﬁciency.
• Based on our low-complexity near-capacity design criterion, we propose a practical framework
of designing an Ir-DHCD-assisted cooperative system which is capable of performing close to
the network’s corresponding non-coherent DCMC capacity.
• In order to reduce further the complexity imposed, while approaching the cooperative network’s
DCMC capacity, the so-called adaptive-window-duration-based SISO iterative MSDSD scheme
is proposed.
The remainder of this chapter is organized as follows. The fundamental performance limits of the
non-coherent detection-aided direct-transmission-based system will be ﬁrst studied in Section 14.2,
followed by a review of the MAP-based SISO MSDSD in Section 14.3, which is capable of achieving
a near-capacity performance at a low complexity. In order to answer the previously mentioned question
related to the ultimate spectral efﬁciency of the repetition-based cooperative relay-aided system,
the fundamental performance limits of the DDF-aided cooperative system will be investigated in
Section 14.4.1 in comparison with those of its direct-transmission-based counterpart. Then, based on
the novel Ir-DHCD coding scheme of Section 14.4.2 contrived for the DDF-aided cooperative system,
a practical framework designed for approaching the DCMC capacity of the cooperative network will
be proposed in Section 14.4.3, which is – naturally – different from that of point-to-point links. Hence,
Section 14.4.4 will demonstrate that the cooperative scheme designed is capable of performing close
to the corresponding network’s DCMC capacity. Finally, our concluding remarks will be provided in
Section 14.5.

Channel Capacity of Non-coherent Detectors
Since one of our goals in this chapter is to compare the maximum achievable spectral efﬁciency of
the DDF-aided cooperative system and that of its differentially modulated direct-transmission-based
counterpart as discussed in Section 14.1, the corresponding fundamental performance limits have to
be investigated in the ﬁrst place. Hence, in this section we ﬁrst focus our attention on the non-coherent
DCMC capacity of the classic single-antenna-assisted point-to-point communication scenario, based on
which the non-coherent DCMC network capacity of the DDF-aided cooperative system will be studied
in Section 14.4.1.
Recall the conditional PDF of the received signal vector from Equation (12.14), which was used for
the derivation of the ML metric of the multiple-symbol differential detection (MSDD) scheme discussed
in Section 12.2.1. The PDF of the received signal vector y in Equation (14.5) was conditioned on the
transmitted signal vector s of Equation (14.9), which may be readily expressed as
p(y|s) = exp(−yHΨ−1y)

(14.15)
with ITb denoting the (Tb × Tb)-element identity matrix.
Since differentially encoded modulation schemes, such as DQPSK, are assumed to be employed
at MSs, and each element si of the transmitted signal vector s is chosen independently from a ﬁnite
constellation set Mc with equal probabilities, the non-coherent DCMC capacity can be expressed as a
function of the SNR as follows:
C(SNR) = H(y) −H(y|s),

where H represents the differential entropy [617] of a random variable x deﬁned as H(x) =

On the other hand, the entropy H(y) of the continuous-valued faded and noise-contaminated received
signal vector y cannot be evaluated in a closed form. When the fading block size Tb over which the
fading envelope is assumed to be correlated is limited, a practical approach to the numerical evaluation
of H(y) is to carry out Monte Carlo integration as follows [618]:

Equation (14.28) is taken with respect to both different CIR realizations and to the noise.
The non-coherent DCMC capacity of the standard block-fading channel computed using the
DQPSK modulation scheme is plotted in Figure 14.2 for various fading block sizes of Tb = 2, 4
and 7. As observed in Figure 14.2, all the three DCMC capacity curves associated with different values
of Tb rise as the SNR increases and are expected to saturate when the SNR reaches a certain value,
although this is not explicitly shown in the ﬁgure. Moreover, a larger fading block size Tb results in a
higher DCMC capacity over a wide range of SNRs, while the capacity difference between the scenarios
of Tb = 2, 4 and 7 becomes increasingly wider as the SNR increases. Nonetheless, the capacity
difference above the saturation SNR remains constant. In other words, although an identical differential
modulation scheme (DQPK) is employed, the maximum achievable spectral efﬁciency associated with
a sufﬁciently high SNR is dependent on the fading block size Tb. This is not unexpected, since the
differential signalling process commences by transmitting a reference symbol for each fading block,
as argued earlier in Section 12.1.1.1, which does not contain any information. This reference symbol
constitutes unexploited transmission overhead, i.e. redundancy, which thus imposes a diminishing
capacity erosion as Tb is increased. Thus, given a sufﬁciently high SNR, the maximum achievable

ηmax = log2 Mc × (Tb −1)/Tb
bps/Hz,
(14.29)
approaches that of the coherent-detection-aided transmission scheme, as the fading block size Tb
increases towards inﬁnity.
On the other hand, according to [616], the predictability of the channel is characterized by the
rank Q of the channel’s covariance matrix Σh formulated in Equation (14.10). For example, the block-
fading channel, where the fading envelope remains constant over the entire fading block, is associated
with the most predictable fading envelope when the channel’s covariance matrix has a rank of Q = 1.
By contrast, the fading process has a ﬁnite differential entropy and becomes less predictable when
Q = Tb. Figure 14.3 compares the non-coherent DCMC capacity of the time-selective block-fading
channel computed from Equation 14.16 for the DQPSK modulation scheme and for various normalized
Doppler frequencies characterizing the correlation of the fading envelope exhibited over each fading
block period. When we have an increased channel unpredictability due to increased Doppler frequency,
a capacity loss is observed in Figure 14.3. In addition, it is also shown in [616] that for a ﬁxed value of
Q, the non-coherent capacity approaches the coherent capacity as Tb increases towards inﬁnity. Hence,
the observation of Figures 14.2 and 14.3 suggests that the non-coherent DCMC capacity of a time-
selective block-fading channel is dependent on both the fading block size Tb and the fading correlation
over blocks characterized by the corresponding covariance matrix Σh.

SISO MSDSD
For the sake of creating a near-capacity system design, the hard-input, hard-output multiple-symbol
differential sphere detector (MSDSD) of Chapter 12 is invoked here. The MSDSD is capable of
approaching the optimum ML performance in a channel-uncoded scenario at a signiﬁcantly lower

complexity than the brute-force full-search-based maximum likelihood MSDD (ML-MSDD). The
MSDSD will be employed in the context of the well-known bit-interleaved coded modulation scheme
using iterative detection (BICM-ID) [314], as portrayed in Figure 14.4. Hence, the MSDSD of
Chapter 12 has to be modiﬁed in order to be able to process as well as to generate soft-bit information at
its input and output, respectively, enabling the exchange of soft information between the outer channel
decoder and itself.
14.3.1
Soft-Input Processing [598]
Recall from Section 12.2 that the principle of the ML-MSDD or the MSDSD is to maximize the
a posteriori probability Pr(s|y), which can be expressed as
ˆsML = max
ˇs∈χ Pr(ˇs|y)
(14.30)
= max
ˇs∈χ
p(y|ˇs)Pr(ˇs)
p(y)
(14.31)
using Bayes’ theorem [467, 542]. Owing to the equiprobable nature of the transmitted symbol vectors
s and the independence of p(y) from s, Equation (14.31) may be further simpliﬁed, yielding the ML
metric as
ˆsML = max
ˇs∈χ p(y|ˇs).
(14.32)
When coupled with the outer channel decoder of Figure 14.4 in order to construct the iterative
detection-aided receiver, the inner detector is provided with soft-bit information, i.e. with the LLRs,
output by the outer decoder, which is regarded as a priori knowledge of the transmitted symbol vector
s. For convenience, the above-mentioned a priori LLR LA1(xk) of the kth bit of the bit vector x, which

14.3.1. Soft-Input Processing
467
was deﬁned in Equation (10.8) of Section 10.1.1.2, is rewritten here as
LA1(xk) = ln Pr(xk = +1)
Pr(xk = −1).
(14.33)
Thus, the transmitted symbol vectors s ∈χ can no longer be considered as equiprobable by the inner
MSDD detector of Figure 14.4. Consequently, bearing in mind the aim of maximizing the a posteriori
probability Pr(s|y) of the transmitted symbol vector s, we refer to the proposed detector as the MAP-
MSDD scheme, which can be implemented by incorporating the a priori soft information delivered by
the channel decoder of Figure 14.4, based on the MAP metric, expressed as follows:
ˆsMAP = max
ˇs∈χ Pr(ˇs|y)
(14.34)
= max
ˇs∈χ p(y|ˇs)Pr(ˇs).
(14.35)
The a priori probability Pr(s) of the transmitted symbol vector may be readily computed from the
a priori LLRs of Equation (14.33) by taking into account the binary-to-Mc-ary bit-to-symbol mapping
scheme characterized as s = map(x), under the assumption that, due to interleaving, the coded symbols
may indeed be considered to be independent.
Furthermore, the MAP metric of Equation (14.35) may be reformulated by taking the logarithm of
the right-hand side as
ˆsMAP = max
ˇs∈χ {ln(p(y|ˇs)Pr(ˇs))}
(14.36)
= max
ˇs∈χ {ln(p(y|ˇs)) + ln(Pr(ˇs))}.
(14.37)
Then, based on the conditional PDF p(y|s) of Equation (14.13), the transformation of the MAP metric
of Equation (14.35) to the so-called shortest-vector problem can be completed by further reformatting
Equation (14.37) as
ˆsMAP = max
ˇs∈χ {−yHΨ−1y + ln(Pr(ˇs))}
(14.38)
= min
ˇs∈χ{∥Uˇs∥2 −ln(Pr(ˇs))},
(14.39)
where U is an upper-triangular matrix deﬁned in Equation (12.28) of Section 12.2.2. Additionally,
according to the principles of differentially encoded modulation discussed in Section 12.1.1.1, a phase
shift common to all components of the transmitted symbol vector s does not alter the MAP metric of
Equation (14.39), which in turn yields the same data symbol vector v. This is not unexpected, since
the nth data symbol vn of the symbol vector v to be transmitted is differentially encoded as the phase
difference between the two consecutive transmitted symbols of sn−1 and sn. Hence, for the sake of
convenience, we may assume that the phase of the last element of the transmitted symbol vector s is
ﬁxed and set to zero. In the sequel, the other elements of the vector s may be obtained cumulatively as

where Nwind is the observation window size employed by the MSDSD. Owing to the unique relations
among the data bit vector x, the data symbol vector v and the differentially encoded signalling
symbol vector s, they are treated interchangeably in our forthcoming discourse. Moreover, owing to
the independence of the (Nwind −1) symbols vn (n = 1, 2, . . . , Nwind −1) from each other, we have

where Dn denotes the accumulated PED between the subvector candidate [ˇvn, ˇvn+1, . . . , ˇvNwind −1]T
and the origin. Hence, the MAP-MSDSD scheme starts the search from the (Nwind −1)th element of
the symbol vector v by choosing a legitimate symbol candidate ˇvNwind −1 from the constellation set of
Mc, which satisﬁes Equation (14.49), and then proceeds to search for the (Nwind −2)th element, and
so forth, until it reaches the n = 1 element. In other words, a trial vector ˇv = [ˇv1, ˇv2, . . . , ˇvNwind −1]T
and the vector ˇs = [ˇs1, ˇs2, . . . , ˇsNwind ] generated using Equation (14.40) are found. Then, the search
radius is updated to
R2 = D1 = ∥Uˇs∥2 −ln[Pr(ˇv)],
(14.50)
based on which the search is repeated by starting with the n = 2 component of the symbol vector v.
Therefore, the tree search employed by the MSDSD is carried out in a depth-ﬁrst manner, which was the
subject of a comprehensive discussion in Section 9.2.2. Finally, if the MSDSD of Figure 14.4 cannot
ﬁnd any legitimate symbol vector within the increasingly shrinking hypersphere-based search space,
the previously obtained vector ˇv is deemed to be the MAP solution of Equation (14.44).

Soft-Output Generation
Besides incorporating the a priori soft-bit information LA1(xk) of Equation (14.33) delivered by the
outer channel decoder of Figure 14.4, the iterative detection scheme requires the MAP-MSDSD to
provide the a posteriori soft-bit information LD1(xk) that will be used as a priori information by the
decoder component, which can be calculated as follows:
LD1(xk) = ln Pr(xk = +1|y)
Pr(xk = −1|y)
(14.51)
= ln p(y|xk = +1)Pr(xk = +1)/p(y)
p(y|xk = −1)Pr(xk = −1)/p(y)


x∈Xk,+1 exp(−∥Us∥2 + ln[Pr(x)])

where Xk,+1 represents the set of M Nwind
c
/2 legitimate transmitted bit vectors x associated with xk =
+1, and, similarly, Xk,−1 is deﬁned as the set corresponding to xk = −1.
To reduce the computational complexity imposed by the calculation of Equation (14.55), the
Jacobian logarithm [553] may be employed to approximate the a posteriori LLRs, which can be
expressed as
Jac[ln(a1, a2)] = ln(ea1 + ea2)
(14.56)
= max(a1, a2) + ln(1 + e−|a1−a2|),
(14.57)
where the second term may be omitted in order further to approximate the original logarithmic function,
since ln(1 + e−|a1−a2|) can be regarded as a reﬁnement or correction term of the coarse ‘sum-max’
approximation provided by the maximum, i.e. the ﬁrst term of Equation (14.57). Explicitly, we have
max sum[ln(a1, a2)] = max(a1, a2).
(14.58)
Therefore, the so-called ‘sum-max’ approximation of the exact a posteriori LLR of Equation (14.55)
can be reformulated with the aid of Equation (14.39) as
LD1(xk) = ln maxx∈Xk,+1{exp(−∥Us∥2 + ln[Pr(x)])}

vector estimation, respectively, obtained by the MSDSD by ﬁxing the kth bit value to b (b = −1

the corresponding a priori LLR, LA1(xk), from the a posteriori LLR, LD1(xk), as
LE1(xk) = LD1(xk) −LA1(xk),
(14.61)
which is exploited by the outer decoder after passing it through the interleaver.

Maximum Achievable Rate Versus the Capacity:
An EXIT-Chart Perspective
In order to visualize the extrinsic information transfer characteristics of the iterative MSDSD scheme,
we plot the EXIT curves associated with different observation window sizes of Nwind in Figure 14.5
by measuring the extrinsic mutual information, IE, at the output of the MSDSD for a given input
stream of bit LLRs, along with the a priori mutual information IA at an SNR of 3 dB. A Rayleigh
block-fading channel associated with a block length of Tb = 7 was assumed. Thus, the maximum
value of Nwind that may be employed by the MSDSD is seven. As observed in Figure 14.5, the slope
of the EXIT curve becomes increasingly steeper as the value of Nwind increases. More speciﬁcally,
the EXIT curve associated with conventional differential detection (CDD) or Nwind = 2 is horizontal
when Gray mapping is employed, indicating that no performance gains can be produced by the iterative
detection mechanism. However, apart from having a higher starting point in the EXIT curve, a steeper
slope is expected, when jointly and differentially detecting (Nwind −1) > 1 data symbols using the
MSDSD, leading to signiﬁcantly increased iterative gains. In addition, according to the area properties
of EXIT charts [579,619], the area A under the bit-based EXIT curve of a soft detector/soft demapper
is equal to the maximum possible code rate Router,max of the outer channel code that can be employed
to achieve near-error-free transmissions. Hence, the maximum achievable near-error-free transmission
rate Roverall,max of a differentially encoded system is computed as

corresponding EXIT curve of the MSDSD. Observe in Figure 14.6 that a performance gain of about
2 dB may be attained by using the MSDSD associated with Nwind = 7 over the system employing the
CDD of Section 12.1.1.1 for a wide range of SNRs, although naturally this is achieved at an increased
complexity owing to the higher observation window size Nwind as well as the potential increased
number of iterations between the MSDSD and the outer channel decoder.
On the other hand, according to the area properties of the EXIT chart [579], the area under the EXIT
curve of an MAP detector/demapper is equal to the maximum possible code rate of the outer channel
code, which can be employed in order to approach the DCMC capacity. In other words, the MAP-
based MSDSD employing the highest possible observation window size Nwind can be regarded as the
optimum differential detector in the interests of approaching the theoretically maximum transmission
rate for a given differentially encoded modulation scheme. Figure 14.7 depicts the maximum achievable
transmission rate of the system employing the MSDSD in comparison with the non-coherent DCMC
capacity of Section 14.2 for various fading block lengths Tb, when aiming for a vanishingly low BER.
Indeed, the former almost coincides with the latter for the Rayleigh block-fading channels associated
with the three different Tb values considered. The slight gap between them is not unexpected, since
the ‘max-sum’ approximation algorithm of Equation (14.60) is employed by the MSDSD in order
to reduce the complexity imposed by computation of the a posteriori LLRs. Consequently, based on
Equation (14.63), we have

Relay-Aided Cooperative Network Capacity
14.4.1.1
Perfect-SR-Link DCMC Capacity
In Sections 14.2 and 14.3 we discussed the non-coherent DCMC capacity of the SISO direct-
transmission-based system and the corresponding near-capacity MAP-based MSDSD detection scheme,
respectively. Let us now continue by investigating the proposed near-capacity system design for
the differentially modulated single-relay-aided cooperative system of Figure 14.1 by studying the
corresponding network’s DCMC capacity. We ﬁrst deﬁne the two-hop, single-relay-aided network’s
capacity as the maximum achievable rate attained during the transmission of the source MS in
the broadcast phase, namely phase I, which consists of Ls symbol periods, and an independent
transmission by the RS during the relaying phase, namely phase II, when Lr symbols are transmitted.
Initially a perfect SR link is assumed in order to guarantee ‘error-free’ relaying. Thus the above-
mentioned network capacity is termed the cooperative system’s DCMC capacity, which is not affected
or constrained by the quality of the SR link. Hence we refer to it in parlance as the ‘perfect-SR-
link’-based capacity. By contrast, in Section 14.4.1.2 its ‘imperfect-SR-link’-based counterpart will
be investigated by considering the speciﬁc performance limitations imposed by the potentially error-
prone SR link. According to the above deﬁnition, the corresponding network’s ‘perfect-SR-link’-based

(14.68)
where
α ≜

Ls + Lr .
(14.69)
In Equation (14.68) σ2
rd characterizes the reduced path-loss-related power gain, which was given
by Equation (14.2), and CDCMC(·) represents the SISO non-coherent DCMC capacity formula of
Equation (14.16). Furthermore, SNRs
e and SNRr
e in Equation (14.68) represent the equivalent SNRs at
the source and relay transmitters, respectively, which have the following relationship with the network’s
overall equivalent SNR, SNRoverall
e
:
SNRoverall
e
= SNRs
e + SNRr
e.
(14.70)
According to the simple cooperative resource allocation scheme mentioned in Section 14.1.1.1, namely
the equal power allocation and the midpoint relay location, Equation (14.68) can be written as
Ccoop
DCMC(α, SNRoverall
e

(14.71)
where v is the path-loss exponent. Furthermore, since the ratio of the differential-encoding frame lengths
used by the source and relay is inversely proportional to the ratio of the channel code rate employed by
the two, we have
Ls
Ls + Lr =
Rr
Rs + Rr = α.
(14.72)
Hence, Equation (14.71) may be reformulated as

(14.74)
Therefore, in contrast to the independence of the DCMC capacity of the channel code rate employed
in the scenario of the conventional direct transmission system, the DCMC capacity of the relay-aided
cooperative system is dependent on the ratio Rs/Rr of the channel code rates employed by the source
and relay or, equivalently, dependent on α. In Figure 14.8 the cooperative system’s DCMC capacity
curves associated with different values of α are depicted based on Equation (14.74) for the ‘perfect-SR-
link’ scenario at a constant code-rate ratio in comparison with the DCMC capacity curve of the direct-
transmission-based system. As observed in Figure 14.8, the cooperative system’s DCMC capacity is
gradually decreased as α is increased. This is not unexpected, since the weight of the second term in
Equation (14.74) decreases as that of the ﬁrst term increases, while the second term is typically larger
than the ﬁrst term owing to the reduced path-loss-related power gain. Furthermore, since the source has

to remain silent, when the relay is transmitting during phase II, the system’s constant code-rate-ratio-
based ‘perfect-SR-link’ DCMC capacity may become even lower than that of the direct-transmission-
based system, as seen in Figure 14.8, if both the overall equivalent SNR and α are sufﬁciently
high. Naturally, the half-duplex constraint imposes a potentially substantial multiplexing loss. In other
words, despite the reduced path-loss-related power gain, the single-relay-assisted cooperative system
considered does not necessarily outperform its direct-transmission-based counterpart in terms of the
maximum achievable transmission rate. In order to prevent this potential performance loss, a careful
system design is required.
On the other hand, given the channel code rates (Rs, Rr) employed by the source and relay, the
resultant bandwidth efﬁciency, η, may be expressed as
η =

(14.77)
Hence, by ﬁxing the value of Rs and varying that of α, the resultant bandwidth efﬁciency η can be
calculated using Equation (14.77). Based on Equation (14.77), the corresponding minimum overall
equivalent SNR required by near-error-free transmissions may be found with the aid of the constant
code-rate-ratio-based ‘perfect-SR-link’ DCMC capacity curves seen in Figure 14.8.
Consequently, the cooperative system’s constant-Rs ‘perfect-SR-link’ DCMC capacity curves
were plotted from Equation (14.77) based on Figure 14.8 for various values of Rs in Figure 14.9,
where we observe that the capacity increases as Rs increases. However, all the constant-Rs-related
capacity curves depicted in Figure 14.9 will intersect the capacity curve of the direct-transmission-based
system plotted in Figure 14.8, if the overall equivalent SNR becomes sufﬁciently high. This results

in a reduced maximum achievable transmission rate compared with the direct-transmission-based
counterpart. Therefore, based on the observation of Figures 14.8 and 14.9, we may state that although
the cooperative system’s capacity increases steadily as the overall equivalent SNR increases, it might
remain lower than that of its direct-transmission-based counterpart, even under the assumption of an
idealized error-free SR link, if both Rs and α are of relatively high values. In other words, under
the assumption of a perfect SR link, the single-relay-assisted DDF cooperative system is capable
of exhibiting a higher capacity than its point-to-point transmission system, provided that the target
throughput is low.
14.4.1.2
Imperfect-SR-Link DCMC Capacity
Until now the single-relay-assisted DDF cooperative system’s capacity has been investigated under the
assumption of an idealized error-free SR link. However, in practice the wireless channel connecting the
source and relay MSs is typically far from perfect and its quality plays an important role in determining
the overall cooperative network’s achievable performance, as discussed in Chapter 13 in the context of
uncoded scenarios. Furthermore, in order to create a near-capacity design for the overall cooperative
system, near-capacity transmission over the potentially error-infested SR link during the broadcast
phase I is a natural prerequisite, which in turn leads to an investigation of the performance limitations
imposed by the SR link on the overall cooperative system.
Under the assumption of equal power allocation and a midpoint relay location, the non-coherent
DCMC capacity of the SR link may be expressed as

(14.78)
where CDCMC(·) was formulated in Equation (14.16). Hence, the non-coherent DCMC capacity of the
SR link may be plotted versus the overall equivalent SNR, as shown in Figure 14.10. Then, according to

which is also depicted versus the overall equivalent SNR in Figure 14.10. Therefore, the minimum
overall equivalent SNR corresponding to a certain value of Rs, which facilitates near-error-free
information delivery from the source to the relay, may be observed in Figure 14.10. These minimum
overall equivalent SNRs characterize the performance limits imposed by the practical imperfect SR
link on the entire cooperative system, when the corresponding rate Rs is employed by the source.
Given these minimum overall equivalent SNRs associated with different values of Rs, we can now
draw the cooperative system’s ‘imperfect-SR-link’ DCMC capacity based on the constant-Rs ‘perfect-
SR-link’ DCMC capacity curves of Figure 14.9. More speciﬁcally, observe in Figure 14.11 that in order
to ﬁnd, for example, the cooperative system’s ‘imperfect-SR-link’ DCMC capacity for Rs = 0.3, we
locate the particular point on the constant-Rs ‘perfect-SR-link’ DCMC capacity curve associated with
Rs = 0.3, whose horizontal coordinate is equal to the corresponding minimum overall equivalent SNR
of −5.3 dB found previously in the context of Figure 14.10. Then, the vertical coordinate of the point
is the ‘imperfect-SR-link’ DCMC capacity of the cooperative system for Rs = 0.3 or when we have
SNRoverall
e
= −5.3 dB.
In order to gain an insight into the beneﬁts of the single-relay-assisted DDF cooperative system over
its conventional point-to-point direct-transmission-based counterpart from a pure capacity perspective,
the ‘imperfect-SR-link’ DCMC capacity of the cooperative system associated with both v = 2 and
v = 3 is depicted in comparison with that of the direct-transmission-based one in Figure 14.12.
It can be seen in the ﬁgure that when the overall equivalent SNR is relatively low, the single-
relay-assisted cooperative system exhibits a signiﬁcantly higher capacity than its direct-transmission-
based counterpart in typical urban cellular radio scenarios, e.g. when having a path-loss exponent of
v = 3. However, the achievable capacity gain may be substantially reduced if we encounter a free-
space propagation scenario, i.e. v = 2, since the reduced path-loss-related power gain achieved is

insufﬁciently high to compensate for the signiﬁcant multiplexing loss inherent in the single-relay-aided
half-duplex cooperative system. Moreover, as the overall equivalent SNR increases to a relatively high
value, there is no beneﬁt in invoking a single-relay-aided cooperative system, since its capacity becomes
lower than that of the conventional point-to-point system.
14.4.2
Ir-DHCD Encoding/Decoding for the Cooperative Cellular
Uplink
In conventional relay-aided DAF cooperative systems, the relay decodes the signal received from the
source and re-encodes it using an identical channel encoder. Then the destination receives two versions
of the same codeword, namely those from the source and relay, respectively, which may be viewed as a
repetition code. Finally, the two replicas of the signal may be combined using maximal ratio combining
(MRC) prior to the decoding. In order to enhance the coding gain achieved by the repetition code
constituted by the relay-aided system, while maintaining the cooperative diversity gain, the classic turbo
coding mechanism was introduced into the DF-aided cooperative system of [620], resulting in the so-
called distributed turbo coding scheme. Speciﬁcally, according to the principle of parallel concatenated
convolutional-code-based turbo coding, the data and their interleaved version are encoded in parallel,
using two distinct recursive systematic convolutional (RSC) codes, respectively. Therefore, a distributed
turbo code may be readily constructed at the relay by interleaving its received estimated source data
prior to re-encoding. Owing to this interleaving at the RS, its encoded stream may be expected to be
different from that of the source. Consequently, the direct encoding of the original bit stream takes
place at the source, while the encoding of the interleaved sequence ensues at the RS in a distributed
manner. A standard turbo decoder may be implemented at the destination. It was revealed in [620] that
a signiﬁcantly enhanced coding gain can be achieved by a distributed turbo code in comparison with
that attained by a single convolutional code for transmission over two independently fading channels.
In order to improve the iterative decoder’s achievable performance and hence achieve near-
error-free transmissions between the source and relay, a unity-rate-coded (URC) three-stage serially

concatenated transceiver employing the irregular convolutional codes (IrCCs) of Section 10.4.3 may
be employed in the single-relay-aided DDF cooperative system. More speciﬁcally, since the URC has
an inﬁnite impulse response due to its recursive encoder architecture, the resultant EXIT curve of the
URC-aided inner decoder is capable of reaching the point (1, 1) of the EXIT chart, provided that the
interleaver length is sufﬁciently high [619]. Furthermore, since the URC decoder employs the MAP
decoding scheme, the extrinsic probability generated at the output of the URC decoder contains the
same amount of information as the sequence at the input of the URC decoder [577,621]. In other words,
the area under the inner EXIT curve remains the same, regardless of the URC’s employment. Hence, a
higher end point of the EXIT curve leads to a lower starting point, implying a steeper slope for the EXIT
curve, which in turn yields a reduced error ﬂoor and a higher SNR threshold, above which decoding
convergence to a vanishingly low BER becomes possible, as we will demonstrate in the forthcoming
sections.
Based on the above-mentioned arguments, the transmitter’s architecture proposed for the source
is depicted in Figure 14.13, where we use a conventional differential modulation scheme, such as
DQPSK, amalgamated with the URC encoder in order to create a two-stage inner code, whereas an
IrCC associated with an average code rate of Rs, namely IrCCs, is employed as the outer code to
achieve a performance that is close to the capacity of the SR link. Speciﬁcally, at the transmitter of
the source in Figure 14.13, a block of L information bits u1 is ﬁrst encoded by the IrCCs encoder,
in order to generate the coded bits c1, which are interleaved by the interleaver πs1. Then the resultant
permuted bits u2 are successively fed through the URCs encoder and the interleaver πs2, yielding the
interleaved double-encoded bits u3, which are delivered to the bit-to-symbol differential modulator
of Figure 14.13. Note that the labels u and c represent the uncoded and coded bits, respectively,
corresponding to a speciﬁc module as indicated by the subscript. The corresponding URC-decoder-
assisted three-stage receiver proposed for the relay is also portrayed in Figure 14.13 together with
its two-stage transmitter schematic. Speciﬁcally, at the receiver of the relay, which comprises three
modules, namely the MSDSDs, the URCs decoder and the IrCCs decoder, the extrinsic information

A(·) represents the a priori information expressed in terms of the LLRs, while E(·) denotes the
corresponding extrinsic information. At the transmitter of the relay, the estimated data bit stream is fed
through the interleaver πr1 prior to the IrCCr encoder having an average code rate of Rr, as observed in
Figure 14.13, in order to construct a distributed turbo code together with the source. Consequently, the
proposed relay-aided cooperative system may be referred to here as an Ir-DHCD (Irregular Distributed
Hybrid Concatenated Differential) coding scheme, under the assumption of an error-free decoding at
the relay.
At the destination BS, according to the principles of the distributed turbo decoding mechanism
proposed in [620], the novel iterative receiver of Figure 14.14 is used for decoding the Ir-DHCD
coding scheme of Figure 14.13. To be speciﬁc, the ﬁrst part of the iterative receiver is an amalgamated
‘MSDSDs–URCs–IrCCs’ iterative decoder, which is used iteratively to decode the signal received
directly from the source during phase I, while the second part consists of the MSDSDr differential
detector and the IrCCr decoder, which is employed iteratively to decode the signal forwarded by the
relay during phase II. Since the MSDSDs–URCs–IrCCs decoder and the MSDSDr–IrCCr decoder
may be regarded as two-component decoders of a turbo receiver, the extrinsic information exchange
between them, which is referred to as the ‘outer iteration’, is expected to enhance signiﬁcantly the
achievable coding gain. In comparison with the conventional relay-aided cooperative system, where a
simple repetition code is constructed, the extra coding gain achieved by the proposed Ir-DHCD coding
scheme may be interpreted as the interleaving gain of the turbo code and the turbo processing gain of
the outer iterations.

Approaching the Cooperative System’s Capacity
In this section, we propose a practical framework capable of approaching the cooperative system’s
capacity. We propose a reduced-complexity near-capacity system design for the DQPSK-modulated
single-relay-assisted DDF cooperative cellular uplink. We will consider two different propagation
scenarios associated with a path-loss exponent of v = 2 and v = 3, respectively. Based on the
proposed cooperative system design, we will verify in Section 14.4.4 that a single-relay-aided DDF
cooperative system is not always superior to its conventional direct-transmission-based counterpart in

terms of the maximum achievable bandwidth efﬁciency. The time-selective block-fading channel model
of Section 14.1.1.2 is employed in conjunction with a normalized Doppler frequency of fd = 0.01. For
the sake of simplicity, the equal power allocation and the midpoint relay location scenarios are assumed
for the single-relay-aided cooperative system, where each terminal is equipped with a single Tx/Rx
antenna. All other system parameters are summarized in Table 14.1.
14.4.3.1
Reduced-Complexity Near-Capacity Design at Relay MS
Without loss of generality, the average code rate Rs of the IrCCs at the source is chosen to be 0.5. Based
on Equation (14.79) of Section 14.4.1.2, the maximum possible code rate Rs that may be employed
by the source to facilitate near-error-free transmissions between the source and relay is plotted in
Figure 14.15 versus the corresponding overall equivalent SNR required for both Scenarios I and II
of Table 14.1. According to Figure 14.15, the minimum overall equivalent SNRs required to support
an SR-link transmission at an inﬁnitesimally low BER are 1.1 and −1.9 dB for Scenarios I and II,
respectively, when Rs = 0.5. The 3 dB SNR gain attained in Scenario II in comparison with Scenario I
is due to the difference in the path-loss-related power gains/losses achieved in the two scenarios of

(14.80)
Theoretically, the SR link’s non-coherent DCMC capacity can be achieved with the aid of an inﬁnite
number of iterations between the inner combined MSDSDs–URCs decoder and an ideally designed
outer IrCCs decoder at the relay’s receiver of Figure 14.13, although naturally this would impose an
excessive computational complexity. However, in practice, to avoid potentially excessive complexity
at the relay, while approaching the capacity, a ‘higher-than-necessary’ EXIT curve may be ensured for
the inner MSDSDs–URCs decoder by having a slightly higher overall equivalent SNR of 2.3 dB for
Scenario I or −0.7 dB for Scenario II, as depicted in Figure 14.16 for a different number of iterations
between the MSDSDs and URCs blocks. The observation window size of the MSDSD was set to its
maximum value of Nwind = 7 in the time-selective block-fading channel having a fading block size
of Tb = 7. It may be observed from Figure 14.16 that the iterative information exchange between
the MSDSDs and URCs blocks approaches convergence as early as their second iteration. Hence, the
number of iterations between the MSDSDs and URCs blocks was set to Ir
inner = 2 in our future
simulations, in order to avoid any unnecessarily imposed complexity, while maintaining a near-capacity
performance. Then, using the EXIT curve of the inner amalgamated MSDSDs–URCs decoder, the
optimized weighting coefﬁcients of the half-code-rate IrCCs can be obtained with the aid of the EXIT-
curve-matching algorithm of [581], resulting in a narrow but marginally open tunnel between the EXIT
curves of the inner amalgamated MSDSDs–URCs decoder and the outer IrCCs decoder, as seen in
Figure 14.16.
On the other hand, in order to reduce further the complexity imposed by the MSDSDs–URCs
decoder during the iterative decoding process at the relay, an adaptive-window-based scheme is
proposed for the MSDSDs, where the observation window size was initially set to the smallest
value of Nwind = 2, which will be slightly increased as soon as the iterative decoding between
the MSDSDs–URCs decoder and the IrCCs decoder converges. The proposed adaptive-window-
based scheme is characterized by Figure 14.17(a), where it is observed that the resultant bit-by-bit

Monte Carlo simulation-based iterative decoding trajectory fails to reach the (1, 1) point associated
with Nwind = 2 and Nwind = 4. By contrast, it does indeed reach the (1, 1) point of the EXIT chart
for Nwind = 7. Thus, the original maximum achievable iteration gain corresponding to Nwind = 7
can be maintained by the adaptive-window-based scheme, despite having a reduced overall complexity
imposed by the MSDSDs. This is not unexpected, since although an increased number of iterations may
be needed between the MSDSDs–URCs decoder and the IrCCs decoder to achieve the same amount
of iteration gain when the adaptive-window-based scheme is employed, the complexity per iteration
imposed by the MSDSDs using a reduced Nwind value is expected to be exponentially reduced, yielding
a potentially reduced overall complexity. Indeed, the complexity imposed is signiﬁcantly reduced by the
adaptive-window-based scheme, as observed in Figure 14.17(b), where the complexity imposed by the
MSDSDs in terms of the number of PED evaluations per bit is plotted versus the overall equivalent
SNR for both systems operating with and without the adaptive-window-based scheme. To be speciﬁc,
regardless of the employment of the adaptive-window-aided scheme, the complexity imposed by the
MSDSDs arrangement during the iterative decoding process gradually decreases in Figure 14.17(b)
as the SNR increases from about 2 dB for Scenario I, where a narrow but open tunnel is created by
using Nwind = 7. This is because a reduced number of iterations are required in Figure 14.17(a)
in the presence of an increasingly wider open EXIT tunnel. Remarkably, the complexity imposed by
the MSDSDs in Scenario I is substantially reduced in Figure 14.17(b) with the aid of the adaptive-
window-assisted scheme by as much as 75% at SNRoverall
t
= 2 dB, when the open EXIT tunnel
created by having Nwind = 7 becomes rather narrow. The attainable complexity reduction increases
even further to about 83% when the open EXIT tunnel becomes wider at SNRoverall
t
= 4 dB, as seen
in Figure 14.17(b).

Reduced-Complexity Near-Capacity Design at Destination BS
In Section 14.4.3.1 the IrCCs decoder of Figure 14.13 was speciﬁcally designed to allow a near-
capacity operation over the SR link with the aid of the EXIT-curve-matching algorithm of [581] carried
out at the relay. Let us now consider the destination BS and optimize the weighting coefﬁcients of the

other irregular convolutional code employed by the RS’s transmitter in Figure 14.13. In other words,
we consider the IrCCr design now, in order to approach the overall cooperative system’s capacity
quantiﬁed in Section 14.4.1.2, while maintaining a relatively low complexity. First of all, the EXIT
curves of the amalgamated MSDSDs–URCs–IrCCs decoder employed by the BS are depicted in
Figure 14.18 for various values of Nwind for both Scenarios I and II associated with an overall equivalent
SNR of 2.3 dB and −0.7 dB, respectively. The number of iterations between the MSDSDs and the
URCs of Figure 14.14 as well as that between the combined MSDSDs–URCs decoder and the IrCCs
scheme are set to Id
inner1 = 1 and Id
inner2 = 5, respectively. It may be observed from Figure 14.18
that the desirable choice of the observation window size employed by the MSDSDs at the BS for
Scenario I is Nwind = 4, while Nwind = 2 for Scenario II, under our low-complexity near-capacity
design criterion.
Then, based on the above-mentioned desirable choices of Nwind, we continue by determining the
desirable number of iterations between the MSDSDs and the URCs arrangements as well as that
required between the combined MSDSDs–URCs decoder and the IrCCs, by plotting the EXIT curves
of the amalgamated MSDSDs–URCs–IrCCs decoder associated with various numbers of iterations
in Figure 14.19. Speciﬁcally, as observed in Figure 14.19(a) for Scenario I, only a modest iteration
gain may be attained by having more than a single iteration (i.e. Id
inner1 = 1) between the MSDSDs
and the URCs blocks of Figure 14.14. By contrast, we need about Id
inner2 = 5 iterations between the
combined MSDSDs–URCs decoder and the IrCCs, while beyond Id
inner2 = 5 the increase of the area
under the EXIT curve of the MSDSDs–URCs–IrCCs decoder becomes marginal. Similarly, observe
in Figure 14.19(b) that a sharply rising EXIT curve can be created for Scenario II when using our
low-complexity near-capacity design criterion, since only a single iteration (Id
inner1 = 1) is required
between the MSDSDs and the URCs, while Id
inner2 = 6 iterations may be necessitated between the
combined MSDSDs–URCs decoder and the IrCCs.
To determine the 17 optimized weighting coefﬁcients of the IrCCr employed by the transmitter of
the relay seen in Figure 14.13, we commence by investigating the EXIT function of the amalgamated
MSDSDr–IrCCr decoder associated with the 17 IrCC subcodes, which constitutes the second
component decoder of the iterative receiver of Figure 14.14 employed at the BS. Since the previously
considered equal power allocation and midpoint relay location scenarios are assumed, an identical
EXIT chart will be created for the combined MSDSDr–IrCCr decoder at the BS for Scenarios I

combined MSDSDr–IrCCr decoder of Figure 14.14 for a given input of a priori mutual information
IA. However, to achieve a near-capacity performance at a relatively low complexity, Nwind = 4 is
considered to be a reasonable choice which strikes a compromise between the achievable performance
and the complexity imposed. On the other hand, the EXIT curves of the combined MSDSDr–IrCCr
decoder associated with three selected IrCC subcodes are also depicted in Figure 14.20(b) for different
numbers of iterations between the MSDSDr and the IrCCr. As observed in Figure 14.20(b), although
the EXIT curve can be shifted to the left by increasing the number of iterations between the MSDSDr
and the IrCCr, any further shifting of the EXIT curve starts to become rather difﬁcult when the number
of iterations exceeds Id
inner3 = 2. Hence, based on the low-complexity near-capacity design criterion,
the number of iterations between the MSDSDr and the IrCCr blocks of Figure 14.14 is chosen to be
Id
inner3 = 2. In the sequel, a group of EXIT curves corresponding to the MSDSDr–IrCCr subcodes
associated with Nwind = 4 and Id
inner3 = 2 iterations can be seen in Figure 14.21.
Finally, we use the EXIT-curve-matching algorithm of [581] in order to match the SNR-dependent
EXIT curve of the combined MSDSDr–IrCCr decoder of Figure 14.14 to the target EXIT curves of the
amalgamated MSDSDs–URCs–IrCCs decoder of the BS portrayed in Figures 14.19(a) and 14.19(b)
for Scenarios I and II of Table 14.1, respectively, as shown in Figure 14.21. As a result, to achieve
a near-capacity performance while maintaining a moderate computational complexity, a ‘wider-than-
necessary’ EXIT tunnel is created between the EXIT curve of the amalgamated MSDSDs–URCs–
IrCCs decoder and that of the combined MSDSDr–IrCCr decoder at the BS. Thus, the resultant
average coding rates, Rr, of the IrCCr scheme designed for Scenarios I and II of Table 14.1 are equal
to 0.6 and 0.5, respectively, which cannot be achieved by simply using one of 17 IrCCr subcodes
having the same code rate, as observed in Figure 14.21, owing to the absence of an open EXIT tunnel.
The corresponding Monte Carlo simulation-based decoding trajectory is also plotted in Figure 14.21 for
both Scenarios I and II of Table 14.1, which reaches the (1.0, 1.0) point of the EXIT chart, indicating
the achievement of decoding convergence to an inﬁnitesimally low BER at near-capacity SNRs for the
Ir-DHCD coding scheme proposed in Section 14.4.2.
We have now completed the low-complexity near-capacity system design for the single-relay-aided
cooperative system contrived for both Scenarios I and II of Table 14.1. Since the average code rate is
ﬁxed to Rs = 0.5 for the IrCC s at the transmitter of the source, and the resultant capacity-achieving

Simulation Results and Discussion
In order to carry out a fair comparison between the cooperative system and its conventional direct-
transmission-based counterpart, we also carry out a near-capacity system design for the latter in this
section, which has exactly the same bandwidth efﬁciency as the former. To be more speciﬁc, according
to Equation (14.62), we can obtain the required code rate of the outer IrCC decoder employed by the
direct-transmission-based system in Scenario I as follows:
Router,Scenario I =
Tb · Roverall
(Tb −1) · log2 Mc
(14.84)
=

Scenario I

and similarly for Scenario II

= 0.25.
(14.88)
Hence, the near-capacity design for the URC-aided three-stage direct-transmission-based system can
be carried out for the target bandwidth efﬁciency, and the corresponding EXIT charts and Monte Carlo

simulation-based iterative decoding trajectories are plotted in Figure 14.22 for both Scenarios I and II
of Table 14.1.
Let us now depict the BER versus the overall equivalent SNR curves for both the point-to-point
transmission-based system and the single-relay-assisted cooperative system in Figure 14.23, which
were previously designed to approach their corresponding capacity at a relatively low complexity. It
is clearly shown in Figure 14.23 that, on using the near-capacity system design of Section 14.4.3, the
proposed Ir-DHCD coding scheme becomes capable of performing within about 2 dB and 1.8 dB from
the corresponding single-relay-aided DDF cooperative system’s DCMC capacity in Scenarios I and II,
respectively. Similarly, an inﬁnitesimally low BER can be achieved by the point-to-point transmission-
based system at an SNR of 1.6 dB and 1.9 dB from the corresponding SISO non-coherent DCMC
capacity in Scenarios I and II of Table 14.1, respectively. Furthermore, in line with our predictions
in Section 14.4.1.2, it is observed from Figure 14.23 that for a given target bandwidth efﬁciency, the
single-relay-aided cooperative system does not necessarily guarantee a performance superior to that
of the conventional direct-transmission-based system. More speciﬁcally, in Scenario I, where the path-
loss exponent was set to v = 2 to simulate a free-space propagation environment, an SNR gain of
0.65 dB can be achieved by the direct-transmission-based system over its single-relay-aided cooperative
counterpart, given a bandwidth efﬁciency of 0.4664 bps/Hz, as shown in Figure 14.23(a). However,
when we have v = 3, in order to model the typical urban area cellular radio environment of Scenario II,
the single-relay-aided cooperative system becomes capable of outperforming signiﬁcantly the direct-
transmission-based system, requiring an overall transmit power which is about 2.5 dB lower than that
needed by the latter to achieve an inﬁnitesimally low BER, while maintaining a bandwidth efﬁciency
of 0.4286 bps/Hz.

In Section 14.1, we commenced by reviewing the SISO non-coherent DCMC capacity. More speciﬁ-
cally, in Section 14.4.1 the single-relay-assisted DDF cooperative system’s DCMC capacity was
investigated and compared with that of the conventional direct-transmission-based system. For the sake
of convenience, we repeat the non-coherent DCMC capacity curves of both the direct-transmission-
based and of the cooperative systems in Figure 14.24. In order to create a near-capacity design for the

capable of approaching the capacity at a relatively low complexity. In contrast to the conventional point-

to two EXIT-curve-matching problems in order to optimize the weighting coefﬁcients of the IrCC
decoders employed by both the source and the relay. A near-capacity performance can indeed be
achieved by the proposed Ir-DHCD encoding/decoding schemes obeying our joint source–relay mode
design, as demonstrated in Figure 14.24. More importantly, based on the capacity and on the practically
achievable performance of classic direct transmission and single-relay-aided cooperative systems, we
found in Figure 14.23(a) that the latter might be outperformed by the former, owing to the signiﬁcant
multiplexing loss inherent in the half-duplex single-relay-aided cooperative system. To be speciﬁc, in
Figure 14.24 the single-relay-aided cooperative system was shown to be superior in comparison with its
direct-transmission-based counterpart only in the speciﬁc scenario when the reduced path-loss-related
power gain was sufﬁciently high in order to compensate for the multiplexing loss. In our future research
we will consider successive relaying-aided arrangements [622] in order to mitigate the above-mentioned
multiplexing loss.

Multi-stream Detection for
SDM-OFDM Systems
The principle of sphere decoding as a reduced-complexity near-ML SDMA MUD was ﬁrst introduced
in this volume in Chapter 9, where diverse SDs were studied comparatively. One of the important
techniques considered was the OHRSA SDMA MUD. In this chapter no channel coding was
employed – indeed, the sphere-decoding philosophy was originally conceived for hard-decision-aided
MUDs, rather than soft-decision-assisted channel-coded systems. As a further enhanced SD, the centre-
shifting philosophy was developed in Chapter 10 in the context of iterative detection-aided channel-
coded SDMA systems. The SD of Chapter 10 was then further exploited throughout Part II of the book
in diverse contexts, when a potentially complex detection task arose. For example, the SD was used for
reducing the detection complexity of sphere-packing modulation-aided STBCs in Chapter 11 and for
the complexity reduction of multiple-symbol differential detection in the cooperative wireless systems
of Chapter 12.
By contrast, throughout Part III of the book, the application of SDs such as the OHRSA will be
investigated in the context of SDM, rather than SDMA systems. The multi-stream detection task of
SDM systems may be deemed to be more challenging than the SDMA MUD task, since in the case of
SDM systems the antenna elements are likely to have a lower spatial separation than the geographically
dispersed users of an SDMA system. Unless unique user/antenna-speciﬁc spreading codes are employed
for differentiating the different data streams, the reduced-separation SDM antenna elements are likely
to have similar impulse responses and hence the separation of the individual antennas’ signals becomes
a more challenging task than that in SDMA systems.
15.1
SDM/V-BLAST OFDM Architecture
In a simple SDM/V-BLAST OFDM architecture [326] the incoming data stream is demultiplexed
into mt parallel data streams. Each of the resultant data streams is independently channel encoded
and OFDM modulated. The resultant mt OFDM-modulated signals are processed by a bank of mt
synchronized transmitters, which operate within the same frequency band. Each of the mt transmitters
comprises a conventional OFDM transmitter having K subcarriers and an OFDM symbol period of
T. In contrast to the D-BLAST scheme [312], the V-BLAST system conﬁguration [326] imposes no
special requirements on the particular structure of each of the multiple transmitters employed. Thus
each of the transmitters can be thought of as a single-user transmitter employing a single transmit

antenna. The SDM-OFDM architecture is illustrated in Figure 15.1. Observe that the structure of the
SDM scheme depicted in Figure 15.1 is equally applicable to point-to-point SDM systems, as well as to
systems supporting multiple users, each employing one or more transmit antennas. Consequently, the
system conﬁguration considered in this section is equivalent to the uplink multi-user SDMA-OFDM
system discussed in [265].
15.2
Linear Detection Methods
The simple philosophy of the linear SDM detector is to recover the signal vector x[n, k] ∈Cmt
transmitted from the mt elements of the transmit antenna array at time instance n and OFDM subcarrier
k from the corresponding signal vector y[n, k] ∈Cnr, which is described by the received signal vector
of Equation (1.25) recorded at the nr elements of the receiver antenna array at time instance n and
OFDM subcarrier k. More explicitly, we have
ˆx[n, k] = WH[n, k]y[n, k],
(15.1)
where W[n, k] ∈Cnr×mt is the corresponding linear SDM detector weight matrix, which is designed
to yield the optimal linear estimate of the transmitted signal vector x[n, k], as detailed henceforth.
By substituting Equation (1.25) into (15.1) we have

where (H)i is the ith column of the channel matrix H, while wi denotes the ith column of the
weight matrix W. We also deﬁne the corresponding additive components ˆxi;S, ˆxi;I and ˆxi;N of the
estimated signal ˆxi as suggested by Equation (15.2), where the subscripts S, I and N denote the Signal,
Interference and the AWGN-related Noise signal components, respectively. Furthermore, we deﬁne the
corresponding quantities seen in Equation (15.3) as in [265], namely
Hii;eﬀ= wH
i(H)i
and
vi;eﬀ= ˆxi;I + ˆxi;N,
(15.4)
which are the effective channel coefﬁcient and the effective interference-plus-noise component,
respectively.
The choice of the particular linear SDM detector weight matrix W is dependent on the optimization
criterion used. A number of examples of the relevant optimization criteria are discussed in [265]
and include maximizing the Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR) as in the Least Squares (LS) method,
maximizing the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) as in the Minimum Mean Square Error
(MMSE) technique, as well as maximizing the SIR, while ensuring a partial suppression of the AWGN
as in the Minimum Variance (MV) method. When maximizing the SINR, which can be expressed as
SINRi =

,
(15.5)
the associated MMSE method [265, Section 17.2.6.1] constitutes an optimal linear approach to the
problem of the SDM detection. Thus, we will limit our discussion of the linear SDM detection methods
here to the characterization of the MMSE SDM detector.
15.2.1
MMSE Detection
As advocated in [265], the problem of maximizing the SINR of Equation (15.5) is equivalent to
minimizing the mean square error at the output of the linear SDM detector of Equation (15.1). The
MSE of the linear SDM detector of Equation (15.1) may be expressed as
MSE = E{∆xH∆x}
= E{(x −WHy)H(x −WHy)}.
(15.6)
Differentiating the MSE of Equation (15.6) with respect to the elements of the liner SDM detector
weight matrix W yields

(15.7)

= −2(Ryx −RyW) = 0,
(15.8)
where 0 ∈Cnr×mt is a zero matrix, while the cross-correlation and autocorrelation matrices Ryx and
Ry of the transmitted and received signals, respectively, are given by
Ryx = E{(Hx + v)xH}
= HE{xxH} = HRx
(15.9)

and
Ry = E{(Hx + v)(Hx + v)H}
= HE{xxH}HH + E{vvH}
= HRxHH + Rv
= HRxHH + σ2
vI.
(15.10)
Observe that Equation (15.7) represents the so-called orthogonality principle [330]. More speciﬁcally,
the extremum of the cost function deﬁned by the MSE of Equation (15.6) occurs when the estimation
error signal ∆x is orthogonal to the received signal y. From Equation (15.8) we can deduce that
WMMSE = (Ry)−1Ryx.
(15.11)
Furthermore, substituting Equations (15.10) and (15.9) into (15.11) yields
WMMSE = (HRxHH + σ2
vI)−1HRx.
(15.12)
Equation (15.12) may be further expanded as follows:
W = (R−1

(15.13)
Finally, substituting the Hermitian transpose of the weight matrix W of Equation (15.13) into
Equation (15.1) yields the MMSE SDM detector, which can be expressed as
ˆx = (RH
x;SNRHHH + I)−1RH
x;SNRHHy,
(15.14)
where we deﬁne the SNR-dependent autocorrelation matrix of the transmitted space-division signal
vector x as Rx;SNR = (1/σ2

substreams Rx;SNR may be expressed as Rx;SNR = diag

where, as before, γ is the average SNR value recorded at the receive antenna elements. Hence, the

Generation of Soft-Bit Information for Turbo Decoding
The BER associated with the process of communicating over a fading noisy MIMO channel can be
dramatically reduced by means of employing channel coding. A particularly effective channel coding
scheme is constituted by the soft-input, soft-output turbo coding method. Turbo coding, however,
requires soft information concerning the bit decisions at the output of the SDM detector, in other words
the a posteriori information regarding the conﬁdence of the bit decision is required.

15.2.1. MMSE Detection
499
The derivation of an expression for the low-complexity evaluation of the soft-bit information
associated with the bit estimates of the linear SDM detector’s output characterized by Equation (15.16)
is given in [265]. Here, we present a brief summary of the results deduced in [265].
The soft-bit value associated with the mth bit of the QAM symbol transmitted from the ith transmit
antenna element is determined by the log-likelihood function deﬁned in [623]
Lim = ln P{bim = 1|ˆxi, Hii;eﬀ}
P{bim = 0|ˆxi, Hii;eﬀ},
(15.17)
which is the logarithm of the a posteriori probabilities’ ratio associated with the logical values of 1
and 0 of the mth bit corresponding to the QAM symbol transmitted from the ith transmit antenna. The
term ˆxi in Equation (15.17) denotes the estimate of the transmitted signal x obtained by applying the
linear SDM detection method considered, while Hii;eﬀis the effective channel coefﬁcient deﬁned by
Equation (15.2), which can be evaluated as the ith element on the main diagonal of the effective channel
matrix given by Heﬀ= WHH, where W is the linear SDM detector’s weight matrix associated with
the particular linear SDM detection method employed. More explicitly, in the case of the MMSE SDM
detector of Equation (15.16) we have
Heﬀ=
 γ
mt HHH + I
−1 γ
mt HHH.
(15.18)
The PDF of Equation (15.17) can be expressed as [265, Section 17.2.5]
P{bim = b | ˆxi, Hii;eﬀ} =

ˇx∈Mbm
P{ˇxi|ˆxi, Hii;eﬀ},
(15.19)
where Mb
m denotes the speciﬁc subset of the total set M of constellation points associated with the
modulation scheme employed, which have a logical value b at their mth bit position, i.e.
Mb
m = {ˇx | ˇx ∈M, bm = b},
b ∈{0, 1}
(15.20)
and bm denotes the mth bit associated with the constellation point ˇx. Furthermore, it is demonstrated
in [265, Section 17.2.5] that
P{ˇxi|ˆxi, Hii;eﬀ} =
1
(πσ2vi;eff ) exp

Performance Analysis of the Linear SDM Detector
In this section, we present our simulation results for the SDM-OFDM system employing the MMSE
SDM detection schemes described in Section 15.2.1.
Our simulations were performed in the baseband frequency domain and the system conﬁguration
characterized in Table 7.1 is to a large extent similar to that used in [260]. We assume a total bandwidth
of 800 kHz. The OFDM system utilizes 128 QPSK-modulated orthogonal subcarriers. For Forward
Error Correction (FEC) we use
1
2-rate turbo coding [314] employing two constraint-length K =
3 Recursive Systematic Convolutional (RSC) component codes and the standard 124-bit WCDMA
UMTS turbo code interleaver of [512]. The octally represented RCS generator polynomials of (7, 5)
were used. Finally, throughout this report we stipulate the assumption of perfect channel knowledge,
where knowledge of the frequency-domain subcarrier-related coefﬁcients H[n, k] is deemed to be
available in the receiver.

SDM detector of Equation (15.14) and mt = nr = 1, . . . , 6 transmit and receive antennas. The
abscissa represents the average SNR recorded at the receive antenna elements. The system parameters
are summarized in Table 7.1.
Figure 15.2 demonstrates the ability of the SDM-OFDM system employing the MMSE SDM
detector of Equation (15.16) to exploit the available MIMO channel capacity gain in the fully loaded
system conﬁguration, i.e. when the number of the transmit antenna elements mt is equal to that of the
receiver antenna elements nr. Figure 15.2 depicts the achievable BER performance of the SDM-OFDM
system considered as a function of the average SNR recorded at each of the receiver antenna elements.
More explicitly, the results depicted in Figure 15.2 illustrate that the SDM-OFDM system employing
mt = nr = 6 transmit and receive antennas, as well as the MMSE SDM detector of Equation (15.16),
is capable of achieving an SNR gain of about 1 dB at the target BER of 10−3, when compared with the
same system employing a single antenna element at both the transmitter and receiver.

method of Equation (15.16) and having a constant number of nr = 4 receive antenna elements.
Speciﬁcally, we aim at exploring the performance of the MMSE SDM detector in the overloaded
system scenario, where the number of transmit antenna elements exceeds that of the receiver elements.
Figure 15.3 demonstrates the achievable BER performance of the MMSE SDM detector considered as
a function of the average SNR recorded at each of the receiver antenna elements. We can see that the
MMSE SDM detector exhibits a relatively good performance whenever the number of transmit antenna
elements is lower than or equal to the number of receiver antenna elements. As seen in Figure 15.3, the
system exhibits a diversity gain of about 2 dB recorded in terms of the SNR at the target BER of 10−3,
when comparing the scenarios of mt = 3 and mt = 4 receiver antenna elements. On the other hand,
however, the MMSE SDM detector of Equation (15.16) exhibits a severe performance degradation in
the overloaded scenario, i.e. when we have mt > nr, which is conﬁrmed by the curves corresponding
to the scenarios of mt = 5 and 6 characterized in Figure 15.3.

Nonlinear SDM Detection Methods
In Section 15.2 we discussed the linear approach to the problem of SDM detection. The major advantage
of the linear detection strategy is its conceptual simplicity and corresponding low computational
complexity. Unfortunately, however, as is evident from our discussion in Section 15.2, the output of
the linear SDM detector contains a substantial amount of residual interference.
In this section we explore a family of nonlinear SDM detection methods. We commence our
discourse with the derivation of the Maximum Likelihood (ML) SDM detection method, which
constitutes an optimal solution of the SDM detection problem from the ML sequence detection point
of view. Unfortunately, the brute-force ML detection method does not provide a feasible solution to the
generic SDM detection problem as a result of its excessive computational complexity. Nevertheless, it
provides an important benchmark for the overall achievable performance of a generic SDM detector.
We then continue our discussions by considering two additional nonlinear SDM detection methods,
which achieve a suboptimal performance at a realistic computational complexity. More explicitly, in
Section 15.3.2 we consider the SIC-aided SDM detection method. Furthermore, in Section 15.3.3 we
invoke the Genetic Algorithm (GA) aided MMSE SDM detector.
15.3.1
ML Detection
The ML method [193, 265, 299] constitutes an optimal SDM detection method in the sense of an
a posteriori probability. The simple philosophy of ML detection is based on an exhaustive search
through all possible values of the transmitted signal vector x with the aim of determining the value
which is most likely to have been transmitted. Clearly, the major drawback of this strategy is its
excessive computational complexity. Speciﬁcally, the number of potential candidate values of the
signal vector x[n, k] of the mt transmit antennas associated with the kth OFDM subcarrier of the
nth OFDM symbol is given by M mt = 2rmt, where M is the number of phasor constellation points
comprising the M-QAM/M-PSK constellation employed, while r is the corresponding number of bits
per M-QAM/M-PSK modulated symbol. More explicitly, this relationship suggests that the number of

502
Chapter 15. Multi-stream Detection for SDM-OFDM Systems
potential signal vector candidates to be examined by the ML detector increases exponentially with the
number of transmitter antennas, as well as with the number of bits per modulated symbol. The resultant
computational complexity may become excessive for systems employing a high number of transmit
antennas and/or high-level modulation schemes, which renders it unsuitable for practical applications.
As noted above, however, the performance of the ML SDM detector constitutes an important benchmark
for the performance evaluation of other, more practical SDM detection schemes.
Let us recall that our channel model described by Equation (1.25) was given by
y = Hx + w,
(15.23)
where, as before, we omit the OFDM subcarrier and symbol indices k and n, respectively. As outlined
above, the output of the ML SDM detector considered comprises a signal vector candidate ˆx, which
maximizes the a posteriori probability function
ˆx = arg max
ˇx∈Mmt P{ˇx|y, H},
(15.24)
where Mmt is the set of all possible candidate symbol values of the transmitted signal vector x, i.e.
Mmt = {ˇx = (ˇx1, . . . , ˇxmt)T; ˇxi ∈M}
(15.25)
and M denotes the entire set of M complex constellation points associated with the particular
M-QAM/M-PSK modulation scheme employed.
It follows from Bayes’ theorem [623] that the conditional probability of Equation (15.24) can be
expressed as
P{ˇx|y, H} = P{y|ˇx, H}P{ˇx}
P{y},
(15.26)
where all possible values of the transmitted signal vector ˇx are assumed to be equally probable and
therefore we have P{ˇx} = 1/M mt = const. Moreover, we have
P{y} =

ˇx∈Mmt
P{y|ˇx, H}P{ˇx} = const,
(15.27)
which follows from the probability function normalization property of

ˇx∈Mmt
P{ˇx|y, H} ≡1.
(15.28)
We can therefore infer that
ˆx = arg max
ˇx∈Mmt P{ˇx|y, H}
⇔
ˆx = arg max
ˇx∈Mmt P{y|ˇx, H}.
(15.29)
As was pointed out in [265], the signal vector y recorded at the nr receive antenna elements can be
represented as a sample of multi-variate complex-Gaussian-distributed random variables with mean Hx
and the covariance matrix given by Equation (15.10), which may be summarized as y ∼CN(Hx, Ry),
where we denote the complex-valued normal distribution having a mean given by the vector µ and the
covariance matrix C as CN(µ, C). The corresponding PDF can thus be expressed as in [330]
P{y|x, H} =
1
(πσ2w)nr exp

−1
σ2w
∥y −Hx∥2

.
(15.30)
The PDF in Equation (15.30) has a form of P{J} = αe−βJ, where α and β are constants and we
deﬁne J(ˇx) = ∥y −Hˇx∥2
2. Clearly, P{J} is a monotonically decreasing function of its argument
J. Consequently, the maximum of the a posteriori probability function of Equation (15.24) can be

15.3.1. ML Detection

substituted by the minimum of the corresponding argument J(ˇx), such that
ˆx = arg min
ˇx∈Mmt J(ˇx),
(15.31)
where, again, J(ˇx) is deﬁned as a Euclidean distance-based cost function, which may be expressed as
J(ˇx) = ∥y −Hˇx∥2

Generation of Soft-Bit Information
Based on our arguments in Section 15.2.1.1, the soft-bit value associated with the mth bit of the QAM
symbol transmitted from the ith transmit antenna element is determined by the log-likelihood function
deﬁned in [623]:
Lmi = ln

(15.34)
and Mb
m denotes the speciﬁc subset of the entire set M of constellation points of the modulation
scheme employed, which comprises the bit value b = {0, 1} at the mth bit position.
Substituting Equation (15.30) into (15.33) yields

(15.35)
Note that Equation (15.35) involves summation over 2rmt−1 exponential functions. This operation
may potentially impose an excessive computational complexity for large values of mt and/or r.
As demonstrated in [265], however, the expression in (15.35) may be closely approximated by a
substantially simpler expression, namely by

Performance Analysis of the ML SDM Detector
In this section, we present our simulation results characterizing the SDM-OFDM system employing
the ML SDM detection schemes described in Section 15.3.1. Our simulation setup is identical to that
described in Section 15.2.1.2 and the corresponding simulation parameters are summarized in Table 7.1.
Figure 15.4 demonstrates that the SDM-OFDM system employing the ML SDM detector of
Equation (15.31) is capable of exploiting the available MIMO channel’s multiplexing gain in the fully
loaded system scenario, when the number of transmit antenna elements mt is equal to that of receiver
antenna elements nr. More speciﬁcally, Figure 15.4 depicts the achievable BER performance of the
SDM-OFDM ML detector considered as a function of the average SNR recorded at the receiver antenna
elements.
The results depicted in Figure 15.4 illustrate that the SDM-OFDM ML detector having mt = nr =
6 transmit and receive antennas exhibits an SNR gain of 3 dB at the target BER of 10−3, when compared

with the same system employing a single antenna element at both the transmitter and receiver, as well
as a higher throughput by a factor of six.
Additionally, Figure 15.5 characterizes the capability of the SDM-OFDM system employing the
ML SDM detector of Equation (15.31) and having a constant number of nr = 4 receive antenna
elements, to detect the multiplexed signals arriving from various numbers of transmit antenna elements.
Speciﬁcally, we aim at exploring the performance of the ML SDM detector in the overloaded system
scenario, where the number of transmit antenna elements exceeds that of receiver elements and thus we
have mt > nr. Figure 15.5 demonstrates the achievable BER performance of the SDM-OFDM system
employing the ML SDM detector as a function of the average SNR recorded at the receive antenna
elements. We can see that, as opposed to the MMSE SDM detector discussed in Section 15.3.1, the ML
SDM detector exhibits a good performance both when mt ≤nr and in the overloaded system scenario
when the number of transmit antenna elements exceeds the number of receive antenna elements, i.e.
when mt > nr.
15.3.2
SIC Detection
The SIC-assisted SDM detector was proposed by Foschini et al. in [312] and was discussed in further
detail in [326,327,441,624,625].
In order to commence our discourse, let us recall the philosophy of the linear SDM detector
discussed in Section 15.2, where the detection of the transmitted signal vector x[n, k] was performed
using a linear transformation described by Equation (15.1), i.e. by
ˆx[n, k] = WH[n, k]y[n, k],
(15.38)
where W[n, k] ∈Cnr×mt is the corresponding linear SDM detector weight matrix.
As was further inferred in Section 15.2, the corresponding SINR at the output of the linear SDM
detector may vary considerably across different elements of the transmitted signal vector x[n, k], as
substantiated by Equation (15.5). Consequently, as suggested in [265], the overall MSE at the output
of the linear SDM detector employed is dominated by the SINR associated with the transmitted signal

parameters are summarized in Table 7.1.
component having the lowest signal power [265] determined by 
j |Hij|2. This observation suggests
that a considerably higher performance can be achieved by employing SIC.
Following the SIC paradigm, the detection of the transmitted signal vector x[n, k] associated with
the kth OFDM subcarrier of the nth OFDM symbol is performed in a successive manner, where at
each detection iteration i we detect a single vector component xi[n, k] using the linear MMSE SDM
detection method discussed in Section 15.2.1. We then modify the received signal vector y[n, k] by
removing the remodulated interfering signal components and repeat the aforementioned linear detection
process in order to estimate the next transmitted signal component xji+1. The iterative process described
above is then repeated until the transmitted signal components associated with all transmitter antenna
elements are detected. In this section we will demonstrate that the successive structure of the detection
process results in a substantially improved SIR for the weaker signal components. Note that in our
forthcoming derivation we, once again, omit the OFDM symbol and subcarrier indices n and k,
which does not restrict the generality of the results obtained, since the space-division detection process
described is performed independently for each pair of time- and frequency-domain indices [n, k].
More speciﬁcally, we commence our SIC detection process with a linear detection of the transmitted
signal component xj1, as suggested by Equation (15.1), where we have
ˆxj1 = wH
1y1,
(15.39)
and w1 = (W)j1 is the j1th column of the SDM MMSE detector’s weight matrix described by
Equation (15.13), while y1 is assumed to be identical to the original received signal vector y.
In the next step, the interference imposed by the just detected and remodulated signal component
xj1 is subtracted from the received signal y1, yielding
y2 = y1 −(H)j1Q(ˆxj1),
(15.40)
where (H)j1 is the j1th column of the channel matrix H, while Q(x) represents the slicing or
hard-decision operation performed in the receiver in order to estimate the transmitted information-
carrying QAM/PSK symbol. The resultant partially decontaminated signal y2 comprises the contribu-
tions of a reduced number of interferers. In order to detect our next desired transmitted signal component

506
Chapter 15. Multi-stream Detection for SDM-OFDM Systems
xj2, we have to calculate the updated linear SDM detector weight matrix W2, which may be readily
achieved by substituting the effective channel matrix Hj1, obtained by zeroing column j1 of the original
channel matrix H, into Equation (15.13), yielding
W2 = Hj1(HH
j1Hj1 + mtσ2
wI)−1,
(15.41)
where we follow the notation employed in [624] and correspondingly Hji denotes the matrix obtained
by zeroing columns j1, . . . , ji of the original matrix H. By substituting the terms ˆxj1, w1 and y1
of Equation (15.39) by the corresponding terms ˆxj2, y2 of Equation (15.40) and w2 = (W)2 of
Equation (15.41), we arrive at the desired estimate of the next transmitted signal component. Finally, the
iterative detection process described above is repeated until all desired transmitted signal components
are successfully detected.
As argued in [624], the order in which the detection of the transmitted signal components xj[n], j =
1, . . . , mt, is performed is important for the overall performance of the detection process. Moreover,
as demonstrated in [624], the optimal ordering arises if the ‘best-ﬁrst’ successive detection strategy is
applied, where the best possible performance is achieved when at each iteration i of the SIC detection
process the desired signal component is selected according to the selection criterion of
ji+1 = arg max
j
∥(Hji)j∥2,
(15.42)
implying that the least-attenuated, i.e. the highest-power, antenna’s signal is detected ﬁrst.
The SDM SIC detection process employing the MMSE detection method of Section 15.2.1 is
summarized in Algorithm 15.1.

More speciﬁcally, the results portrayed in Figure 15.6 illustrate on the SNR scale that the SDM-

2 dB at the target BER of 10−3, when compared with the same system employing a single antenna

Furthermore, Figure 15.7 illustrates the capability of the SDM-OFDM system employing the SIC

we aim at exploring the attainable performance of the SIC SDM detector in the overloaded system
scenario, where the number of transmit antenna elements exceeds that of receiver antenna elements and
thus we have mt > nr. Figure 15.7 demonstrates the achievable BER performance of the SDM-OFDM
system employing the SIC SDM detector as a function of the average SNR recorded at the receive
antenna elements. In can be seen by comparing Figures 15.7 and 15.3 that in an overloaded scenario
the SIC SDM detector considered performs better than the MMSE SDM detector of Section 15.2.1.
Nevertheless, note from the comparison of Figures 15.7 and 15.5 that a substantial performance
degradation may still be observed in comparison with the ML SDM detector of Section 15.3.1.
A more detailed comparison of the achievable performance corresponding to the various SDM detection
methods considered will be carried out in Section 15.5.

Genetic algorithms [328, 454] constitute a family of optimization algorithms often utilized to ﬁnd
approximate solutions to optimization problems having irregular error surfaces associated with local
minima, such as in interference, rather than noise-limited propagation environments [626]. GAs use
biologically inspired search and optimization methods, such as inheritance, mutation, natural selection
and recombination (or cross-over) of genes, each representing for example a bit string describing

represented as strings of discrete symbols, such as for instance zeros and ones, but using different
encoding schemes is also possible. In each generation, pairs of parent individuals are selected from the
current population based on their ﬁtness properties. They are modiﬁed (mutated or recombined) to form
a new population, which becomes the current population in the next iteration of the algorithm.
GAs were found to be highly efﬁcient in numerous global search and optimization problems,
especially when their solution using conventional methods is not feasible or otherwise would impose
an excessive computational complexity. GAs were ﬁrst applied to the problem of multi-user detection
by Juntti et al. in [329] and Wang et al. in [627]. They were then documented in great detail in [626].
In our case, we explore the achievable performance of the GA-aided SDM detection method in the
context of the SDM-OFDM system of Section 1.8.3. We employ an SDM-MMSE detector described
in Section 15.2.1 as our solution in the initial population at the input of the GA-aided SDM detector.
A detailed description of GA-aided detection and the particular conﬁguration of the GA employed is
beyond the scope of this report. The conﬁguration of the GA employed here is identical to that described
in much detail in [628]. The interested reader may also refer to [626] for further insight.
In the next section, we explore the achievable performance of the GA-aided SDM detector in the
context of the SDM-OFDM system of Figure 15.1. The simulation setup of the SDM-OFDM system is
identical to that described in Section 15.2.1.2, as summarized in Table 7.1, while details concerning the
conﬁguration of the GA-MMSE SDM detector employed can be found in Table 15.1.

Performance Enhancement Using Space–Frequency
Interleaving
Employing frequency-domain interleaving is common practice in OFDM transceivers [265], since
it enables exploitation of the available Frequency-Domain (FD) diversity provided by a frequency-
selective wireless fading channel. In this section we explore the further beneﬁts of employing space–
frequency interleaving in the context of the SDM-OFDM system architecture investigated.

Figure 15.9: Schematic of an SDM-SFI-OFDM transceiver. In contrast to the SDM-OFDM scheme
characterized in Figure 15.1, here the OFDM-subcarrier-related data substreams associated with
different transmit antenna elements are SFI at the output of the channel encoder.
15.4.1
Space–Frequency-Interleaved OFDM
The structure of the Space–Frequency-Interleaved (SFI) SDM-OFDM system considered is illustrated
in Figure 15.9. Observe that, in contrast to the system architecture portrayed in Figure 15.1, the set
of OFDM-subcarrier-related data substreams at the outputs of the bank of channel encoders seen in
Figure 15.9 are jointly interleaved, resulting in the SFI signal vectors xi, where i = 1, . . . , mt is
the index corresponding to the different transmit antenna elements. Correspondingly, at the SDM-
SFI-OFDM receiver of Figure 15.9 the set of detected OFDM-subcarrier-related signal vectors ˆxi is
space–frequency deinterleaved, before they are processed by the bank of channel decoders portrayed
in Figure 15.9. As a result, the impact of the channel impairments, such as fading and interference, is
uniformly spread across the data substreams associated with the different transmit antenna elements. In
other words, the SDM-SFI-OFDM system considered is capable of more efﬁciently exploiting both the
space and frequency diversity beneﬁts of the wireless MIMO channel. Consequently, we may expect
that the SDM-SFI-OFDM system advocated will outperform the SDM-OFDM system of Section 15.1
in terms of the achievable BER performance.
15.4.1.1
Performance Analysis of the SFI-SDM-OFDM
As a test case for exploring the achievable performance of the SDM-SFI-OFDM scheme advocated, we
employ the GA-MMSE SDM detector characterized in Section 15.3.3. Figure 15.10 demonstrates the
ability of the SDM-SFI-OFDM system employing the GA-MMSE SDM detector of Section 15.3.3 to
exploit the available MIMO channel capacity gain in the fully loaded system conﬁguration, i.e. when the
number of transmit antenna elements mt is equal to that of receiver antenna elements nr. Speciﬁcally,
Figure 15.10 depicts the achievable BER performance of the SDM-OFDM system considered as a
function of the average SNR recorded at each of the receiver antenna elements. Furthermore, the results
depicted in Figure 15.10 illustrate that the SDM-OFDM system employing mt = nr = 6 transmit and
receive antennas, as well as the GA-MMSE SDM detector, is capable of achieving an SNR gain of 3 dB
at the target BER of 10−3, when compared with the same system employing a single antenna element
at both the transmitter and receiver.

characterized in Figure 15.8. The OFDM system parameters are summarized in Table 7.1 and the
corresponding GA conﬁguration parameters are outlined in Table 15.1.

Performance Comparison and Discussion
In this section we compare the achievable performance of the SDM detection methods considered
in Sections 15.2 and 15.3 in the context of both the SDM-OFDM and SDM-SFI-OFDM systems of
Sections 15.1 and 15.4.1, respectively. More speciﬁcally, Figure 15.11 portrays the achievable BER
performance of the SDM-MMSE detector of Section 15.2.1, as well as that of the ML, SIC and GA-
MMSE SDM detectors described in Sections 15.3.1, 15.3.2 and 15.3.3, respectively. Figures 15.11(a)
and 15.11(b) correspond to the scenarios of mt = nr = 2 and 6 transmit and receive antenna elements,
respectively. Furthermore, the open markers in Figures 15.11(a) and 15.11(b) correspond to the SDM-
OFDM scheme characterized in Figure 15.1, while the solid markers correspond to the SDM-SFI-
OFDM arrangement portrayed in Figure 15.9.
It can be seen in Figures 15.11(a) and 15.11(b) that the SNR performance of the nonlinear SDM
detection methods, namely that of the ML, SIC and GA-MMSE detectors of Sections 15.3.1, 15.3.2
and 15.3.3, respectively, is signiﬁcantly higher than the corresponding performance of the linear MMSE
SDM detector characterized in Section 15.2.1. This conclusion holds for the scenarios of both the SDM-
OFDM and SDM-SFI-OFDM systems. Furthermore, the SNR performance of the GA-MMSE detector
is within a 1 dB margin of the SNR performance exhibited by the ML SDM detector in both the SDM-
OFDM and SDM-SFI-OFDM scenarios.
By comparing Figures 15.11(a) and 15.11(b) we can conclude that the SNR performance of all
the SDM detection methods considered improves upon increasing the number of transmit and receive
antenna elements. Additionally, Figure 15.11(b) suggests that for a high number of transmit and receive
antennas, the achievable performance of the turbo-coded SDM-SFI-OFDM system employing the ML
SDM detector of Section 15.3.1 and communicating over the dispersive fading channel categorized by
Bug’s channel model [346] approaches the performance attained over an AWGN channel. Speciﬁcally,
in the scenario of mt = nr = 6 characterized in Figure 15.11(b), the SNR performance of the
turbo-coded SDM-SFI-OFDM system communicating over the dispersive fading channel categorized

channel.
Finally, it can be seen in Figures 15.11(a) and 15.11(b) that the SDM-SFI-OFDM system employing
the SDM detectors considered outperforms its SDM-OFDM counterpart. Quantitatively, in the scenario
of mt = nr = 6, the SDM-SFI-OFDM system employing the ML, SIC or GA-MMSE SDM detector
exhibits an SNR gain of about 1 dB, when compared with its SDM-OFDM counterpart. In the case
of employing the linear MMSE detector, the corresponding SNR difference between the SDM-SFI-
OFDM and SDM-OFDM systems is about 2 dB at the target BER of 10−3. It should be noted that
the performance gains portrayed here are dependent on the particular channel model considered. The
diversity gain associated with employing the SFI method becomes higher if the channel considered
is less dispersive, i.e. the corresponding power delay proﬁle characterizing the channel considered
comprises fewer non-zero taps.

Conclusions
In this chapter we investigated the attainable performance beneﬁts of employing multiple-antenna-aided
SDM-OFDM architectures invoked in wireless communication systems in the context of a point-to-
point system scenario, where two peer terminals employing multiple antennas communicate over a
time-varying frequency-selective fading channel. We demonstrated that the linear capacity increase,
predicted by the relevant information theoretical analysis [310], can indeed be achieved by employing a
relatively low-complexity linear detection technique, such as the MMSE detector. We also showed that
the ML detector is capable of attaining signiﬁcant transmit diversity gains in fully loaded systems, where

the number of transmit and receive antennas is identical. Furthermore, the ML detector is capable of
adequately performing in an overloaded system conﬁguration, where the number of transmit antennas
exceeds that of receive antennas. Subsequently, we explored the potential of a range of additional
advanced nonlinear SDM detection methods, which may potentially constitute an attractive compromise
between the low complexity of the MMSE linear detector and the high performance of the ML detector.
More explicitly, we demonstrated that the family of detection methods based on SIC as well as GA-aided
MMSE detection are capable of satisfying these challenging requirements. Finally, we proposed a novel
technique termed here SFI, which may be employed in the SDM system architecture advocated and may
be beneﬁcially combined with all the aforementioned detection techniques, resulting in a further SNR
performance improvement of up to 2 dB.

OHRSA-Aided SDM Detection1
As was pointed out in [265], the ‘brute-force’ ML detection method does not provide a feasible
solution to the generic SDM detection problem as a result of its excessive computational complexity.
Nevertheless, since typical wireless communication systems operate at moderate-to-high SNRs, a
Reduced Search Algorithm (RSA) may be employed, which is capable of approaching the ML solution
at a complexity considerably lower than that imposed by the ML detector of [265]. The most potent
among the RSA methods found in the literature is constituted by the Sphere Decoder (SD) [333]. The SD
was ﬁrst proposed for employment in the context of space–time processing in [334], where it is utilized
for computing the ML estimates of the modulated symbols transmitted simultaneously from multiple
transmit antennas. The complex version of the SD, which is capable of approaching the channel capacity,
was proposed by Hochwald and ten Brink in [335]. The subject was further investigated by Damen et al.
in [336]. Subsequently, an improved version of the Complex Sphere Decoder (CSD) was advocated by
Pham et al. in [337]. The issue of achieving near-capacity performance while reducing the associated
complexity was revisited by Wang and Giannakis in [343, 629]. Further results on reduced-complexity
CSD were published by Zhao and Giannakis in [342]. Finally, CSD-aided detection was considered by
Tellambura et al. in a joint channel estimation and data detection scheme explored in [285], while a
revised version of the CSD method, namely the so-called Multi-stage Sphere Decoding (MSD), was
introduced in [338,340].
In this chapter we introduce a novel Optimized Hierarchy Reduced Search Algorithm (OHRSA)
aided SDM detection method, which may be regarded as an advanced extension of the CSD method
portrayed in [337]. The algorithm proposed extends the potential range of applications of the CSD
methods of [335] and [337], as well as reduces the associated computational complexity, rendering the
algorithm attractive for employment in practical systems.
The method proposed, which we refer to as the Soft-output OPtimized HIErarchy (SOPHIE)
algorithm, exhibits the following attractive properties:

Chapter 16. Log-MAP SDM-OFDM Multi-stream Detection
1. The method can be employed in the so-called overloaded scenario, where the number of transmit
antenna elements exceeds that of receive antenna elements. A particularly interesting potential
application is found in a multiple-input, single-output scenario, where the system employs
multiple transmit antennas and a single receive antenna. Moreover, the associated computational
complexity is only moderately increased even in heavily overloaded scenarios and it is almost
independent of the number of receive antennas.
2. As opposed to the conventional CSD schemes, the calculation of the sphere radius is not required
and therefore the method proposed is robust to the particular choice of the initial parameters in
terms of both the achievable performance and the associated computational complexity.
3. The method proposed allows for a selected subset of the transmitted information-carrying
symbols to be detected, while the interference imposed by the undetected signals is suppressed.
4. The overall computational complexity required is only slightly higher than that imposed by the
linear MMSE multi-user detector designed for detecting a similar number of users.
5. Finally, the associated computational complexity is fairly independent of the channel conditions
quantiﬁed in terms of the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) encountered.
16.1.1
OHRSA-Aided ML SDM Detection
We commence our discourse by deriving an OHRSA-aided ML SDM detection method for a constant
modulus modulation scheme, such as M-PSK, where the transmitted symbols s satisfy the condition
of |s|2 = 1, ∀s ∈M, and M denotes the set of M complex-valued constellation points. In the next
section, we will demonstrate that the method derived is equally applicable for high-throughput multi-
level modulation schemes, such as M-QAM.
Let us recall that our system model described in detail in Section 1.8 is given by
y = Hs + w,
(16.1)
where we omit the OFDM subcarrier and symbol indices k and n, respectively. As outlined in [265], the
ML SDM detector provides an mt-antenna-based estimated signal vector candidate ˆs, which maximizes
the objective function deﬁned as the conditional a posteriori probability function P{ˇs|y, H} over the
set Mmt of legitimate solutions. More explicitly, we have
ˆs = arg max
ˇs∈Mmt P{ˇs|y, H},
(16.2)
where Mmt is the set of all possible mt-dimensional candidate symbol vectors of the mt-antenna-
based transmitted signal vector s. More speciﬁcally, we have
Mmt = {ˇs = (ˇs1, . . . , ˇsmt)T; ˇsi ∈M}.
(16.3)
Furthermore, it was shown in [265]that
P{ˇs|y, H} = A exp
	
−1
σ2w
∥y −Hˇs∥2

,
(16.4)
where A is a constant which is independent of any of the values {ˇsi}i=1,...,mt. Thus, it may
be shown [265] that the probability maximization problem of Equation (16.2) is equivalent to the
corresponding Euclidean distance minimization problem. Speciﬁcally, we have
ˆs = arg min
ˇs∈Mmt ∥y −Hˇs∥2,
(16.5)
where the probability-based objective function of Equation (16.2) is substituted by the objective func-
tion determined by the Euclidean distance between the received signal vector y and the corresponding
product of the channel matrix H with the a priori candidate of the transmitted signal vector ˇs ∈Mmt.
Consequently, our detection method relies on a speciﬁc observation, which may be summarized in
the form of the following lemma.

16.1.1. OHRSA-Aided ML SDM Detection
517
Lemma 16.1. The ML solution of Equation (16.2) of a noisy linear problem described by Equa-
tion (16.1) is given by
ˆs = arg min
ˇs∈Mmt {∥U(ˇs −ˆx)∥2},
(16.6)
where U is an upper-triangular matrix having positive real-valued elements on the main diagonal and
satisfying
UHU = (HHH + σ2
wI),
(16.7)
while
ˆx = (HHH + σ2
wI)−1HHy
(16.8)
is the unconstrained MMSE estimate of the transmitted signal vector s, which was derived in [265].
Note 1.
Observe that Lemma 16.1 imposes no constraints on the dimensions or rank of the matrix
H of the linear system described by Equation (16.1). This property is particularly important, since it
enables us to apply our proposed detection technique to the scenario of overloaded systems, where the
number of transmit antenna elements exceeds that of receive antenna elements.
Note 2.
As substantiated by Equation (16.5), it is sufﬁcient to prove that the following minimization
problems are equivalent:
ˆs = arg min
ˇs∈Mmt ∥y −Hˇs∥2
(16.9)
⇔
ˆs = arg min
ˇs∈Mmt ∥U(ˇs −ˆx)∥2.
(16.10)
Proof of Lemma 16.1.
It is evident that in contrast to the matrix HHH, the matrix (HHH + σ2
wI)
of Equation (16.6) is always Hermitian and positive deﬁnite, regardless of the rank of the channel
matrix H associated with the particular MIMO channel realization encountered. Consequently, it may
be represented as the product of an upper-triangular matrix U and its Hermitian adjoint matrix UH using
for example the Cholesky factorization method [630].
Let U be the matrix generated by the Cholesky decomposition of the Hermitian positive deﬁnite
matrix (HHH + σ2
wI) of Equation (16.7). More speciﬁcally, we have
UHU = (HHH + σ2
wI),
(16.11)
where U is an upper-triangular matrix having positive real-valued elements on its main diagonal.
On expanding the objective function of Equation (16.6) and subsequently invoking Equation (16.7),
we obtain
J(ˇs) = ∥U(ˇs −ˆx)∥2
= (ˇs −ˆx)HUHU(ˇs −ˆx)
= (ˇs −ˆx)H(HHH + σ2
wI)(ˇs −ˆx)
= ˇsH(HHH + σ2
wI)ˇs −ˆxH(HHH + σ2
wI)ˇs
−ˇsH(HHH + σ2
wI)ˆx + ˆxH(HHH + σ2
wI)ˆx.
(16.12)
Furthermore, substituting Equation (16.8) into (16.12) yields
J(ˇs) = ˇsHHHHˇs −yHHˇs −ˇsHHHy
+ σ2
wˇsHˇs + yHH(HHH + σ2
wI)−1HHy
= ∥y −Hˇs∥2 + σ2
wˇsHˇs + yH(H(HHH + σ2
wI)−1HH −I)y

Chapter 16. Log-MAP SDM-OFDM Multi-stream Detection
Observe that in the case of a system employing a constant modulus modulation scheme, such as
M-PSK, where we have ˇsHˇs = 1, ψ of Equation (16.13) constitutes a real-valued scalar and its
value does not depend on the argument ˇs of the minimization problem formulated in Equation (16.6).
Consequently, the minimization of the objective function J(ˇs) of Equation (16.13) can be reduced to
the minimization of the term ∥y −Hˇs∥2, which renders it equivalent to the minimization problem of
Equation (16.9). This completes the proof.
2
Using Lemma 16.1, in particular the fact that the matrix U is an upper-triangular matrix, the
objective function J(ˇs) of Equation (16.13) may be reformulated as follows:
J(ˇs) = ∥U(ˇs −ˆx)∥2

Note that the term ai is a complex-valued scalar which is independent of the speciﬁc symbol value ˇsi
of the ith element of the a priori candidate signal vector ˇs.
Furthermore, let Ji(ˇsi) be a Cumulative Sub-Cost (CSC) function recursively deﬁned as
Jmt(ˇsmt) = φmt(ˇsmt) = |umtmt(ˇsmt −ˆxmt)|2
(16.16a)
Ji(ˇsi) = Ji+1(ˇsi+1) + φi(ˇsi),
i = mt−1, . . . , 1,
(16.16b)
where we deﬁne the candidate subvector as ˇsi = [ˇsi, . . . , ˇsmt]. Clearly, Ji(ˇsi) exhibits the following
properties:
J(ˇs) = J1(ˇs1) > J2(ˇs2) > · · · > Jmt(ˇsmt) > 0
(16.17a)
Ji(ˇsi) = Ji({ˇsj}, j = i, . . . , mt)
(16.17b)
for all possible realizations of ˆx ∈Cmt and ˇs ∈Mmt, where the space Cmt contains all possible
unconstrained MMSE estimates ˆx of the transmitted signal vector s.
Equations (16.17a) and (16.17b) enable us to employ a highly efﬁcient RSA, which decreases the
number of objective function evaluations of the minimization problem outlined in Equation (16.6) to a
small fraction of the set Mmt. This reduced-complexity search algorithm is outlined in the next section.

Our task is to obtain the ML estimate of the transmitted signal vector s. Firstly, we evaluate the triangular
matrix U of Equation (16.7) as well as the unconstrained MMSE estimate ˆx of Equation (16.8). The

$T. Subsequently, following the philosophy outlined in Section 16.1.1, for each
legitimate candidate ˇs ∈Mmt of the mt-antenna-based composite transmitted signal vector s we
calculate the corresponding value of the cost function J(ˇs) of Equation (16.14) using the recursive
method described by Equation (16.16). The search process performed is illustrated in Figure 16.1(a).
Each evaluation step, i.e. each evaluation of the CSC function Ji(ˇsi) of Equation (16.16b), is indicated
by an elliptic node in Figure 16.1(a). The label inside each node indicates the order of evaluation as well
as the corresponding value Ji(ˇsi) of the CSC function inside the brackets. Furthermore, the branches
corresponding to the two legitimate values of ˇsi = −1 and 1 are indicated using the dashed and solid
edges and nodes, respectively.
More speciﬁcally, commencing from the top of Figure 16.1(a), at recursive step i = 3 we calculate
the CSC function of Equation (16.16a) associated with all legitimate values of the last element of the
signal vector s, where
J3(ˇs3 = −1) = |u33(ˇs3 −ˆx3)|2 = (0.40(−1 −(−0.01)))2 = 0.15
(16.20)
and
J3(ˇs3 = 1) = (0.40(1 −(−0.01)))2 = 0.16.
(16.21)
The corresponding values of J3(ˇs3 = −1) = 0.15 and J3(ˇs3 = 1) = 0.16 are indicated by the nodes
1 and 8 in Figure 16.1(a). Observe that the recursive nature of the search process considered suggests
that the latter value of J3(ˇs3 = 1) is not considered until the entire search branch originating from the
more promising node 1 associated with the lower CSC value of 0.15 is completed. Consequently, the
value J3(ˇs3 = 1) is the eighth value of the CSC function to be evaluated, which is indicated by the
corresponding node’s index 8.
Furthermore, at recursive step i = 2 for each hypothesized value ˇs3 we calculate both the quantity
a2 of Equation (16.15) as well as the subcost function of Equation (16.15) and the corresponding CSC
function of Equation (16.16b) associated with all legitimate values of the last-but-one element of the
signal vector s. Explicitly, for ˇs3 = −1 we have
a2 = u23(ˇs3 −ˆx3) = −0.15(−1 −(−0.01)) = 0.15
(16.22)
and
J2(ˇs2 = −1, ˇs3 = −1) = J3(ˇs3 = −1) + φ2(ˇs2 = −1, ˇs3 = −1)
= J3(ˇs3 = −1) + |u22(ˇs2 −ˆx2) + a2|2
= 0.15 + (1.18(−1 −(−1.05)) + 0.15) = 0.20
J2(ˇs2 = 1, ˇs3 = −1) = J3(ˇs3 = −1) + φ2(ˇs2 = 1, ˇs3 = −1)
= 0.15 + (1.18(1 −(−1.05)) + 0.15) = 6.79.
(16.23)
The corresponding values of J2(ˇs2 = [−1, −1]) = 0.20 and J2(ˇs2 = [1, −1]) = 6.79 are indicated
by nodes 2 and 5 in Figure 16.1(a).

Chapter 16. Log-MAP SDM-OFDM Multi-stream Detection
Finally, at recursive index i = 1 for each hypothesized subvector ˇs2 we calculate the quantity
a1(ˇs2) and the subcost function φ1(ˇs1) of Equation (16.15) as well as the corresponding total cost
function J(ˇs1 = −1,ˇs2) and J(ˇs1 = 1,ˇs2) of Equation (16.14) associated with all legitimate values
of the ﬁrst element of the signal vector s. Speciﬁcally, for the leftmost search branch of Figure 16.1(a)
corresponding to the a priori candidate ˇs2 = [−1, −1] we have
a1 = u12(ˇs2 −ˆx2) + u13(ˇs3 −ˆx3)
= 1.48(−1 −(−1.05)) + (−0.10)(−1 −(−0.01)) = 0.17
(16.24)
and
J1(ˇs1 = −1, ˇs2 = −1, ˇs3 = −1)
= J2(ˇs2 = −1, ˇs3 = −1) + φ1(ˇs1 = −1, ˇs2 = −1, ˇs3 = −1)
= J2(ˇs2 = −1, ˇs3 = −1) + |u11(ˇs1 −ˆx1) + a1|2
= 0.20 + (1.15(−1 −0.85) + 0.17) = 4.03,
J1(ˇs1 = 1, ˇs2 = −1, ˇs3 = 1)
= J2(ˇs2 = −1, ˇs3 = −1) + φ2(ˇs1 = 1, ˇs2 = −1, ˇs3 = −1)
= 0.20 + (1.15(1 −0.85) + 0.17) = 0.31.
(16.25)
On completing the entire search process outlined above we arrive at eight values of the total cost
function J(ˇs) associated with eight legitimate 3-bit solutions of the detection problem considered. The
eight different candidate solutions are indicated by the eight bottommost elliptic nodes in Figure 16.1(a).
Clearly, the ML solution is constituted by the search branch terminating at node 11 of Figure 16.1(a)
and having the minimum value J(ˇs) = 0.19 of the total cost function.
Observe that the difference between the values of J3(ˇs3 = −1) and J3(ˇs3 = 1) associated with
nodes 1 and 8 in Figure 16.1(a) is quite small and thus the potential of ﬁnding the ML solution along
either of the search branches commencing at nodes 1 and 8 in Figure 16.1(a) may not be recognized with
a high degree of conﬁdence. On the other hand, the difference between the values of the CSC function
along two complementary search branches commencing at nodes 1 and 8 becomes substantially more
evident if we apply the best-ﬁrst detection strategy suggested in [631]. More speciﬁcally, we sort the
columns of the channel matrix H in increasing order of their Euclidean or square norm. The resultant
reordered channel matrix H′ as well as the corresponding triangular matrix U and the unconstrained
MMSE estimate ˆx′ may be expressed as
H′ =

(16.26)
The search tree generated by applying the aforementioned search process and using the modiﬁed
quantities H′, U′ and ˆx′ is depicted in Figure 16.1(b). Note the substantial difference between the
values of the CSC function J3(ˇs3 = −1) and J3(ˇs3 = 1) associated with nodes 1 and 8. Moreover, by
comparing the value of the CSC function J3(ˇs3) of node 8 with that of the total cost function J(ˇs) of
node 7 we can conclude that the search along the branch commencing at node 8 is in fact redundant.
In order to optimize our search process further, at recursive steps of i = 3 and 2 we ﬁrst calculate the
subcost functions φ3(ˇs3 = {−1, 1}) and φ2(ˇs3, ˇs2 = {−1, 1}) of Equation (16.15). We then compare
the values obtained and continue with the processing of the speciﬁc search branch corresponding to the
smaller value of the subcost function φi(ˇsi) ﬁrst. The resultant search tree is depicted in Figure 16.1(c).
Observe that in Figure 16.1(c) the minimum value of the total cost function J(ˇs) = 0.19 is obtained
faster, i.e. in three evaluation steps in comparison with seven steps required by the search tree of
Figure 16.1(b).

Note that the ML solution is obtained in six evaluation steps in comparison with the 14 steps required
in the case of the exhaustive search of Figure 16.1(a). In conclusion, on performing the appropriate

16.1.1.2
Generalization of the OHRSA-ML SDM Detector
Let us now generalize and substantiate further the detection paradigm derived in Example 16.1. Firstly,
we commence the recursive search process with the evaluation of the CSC function value Jmt(ˇsmt) of
Equation (16.16a). Secondly, at each recursive step i of the search algorithm proposed we stipulate
a series of hypotheses concerning the value of the M-ary transmitted symbol si associated with
the ith transmit antenna element and subsequently calculate the conditioned subcost function Ji(ˇsi)
of Equation (16.16b), where ˇsi = (ˇsi, . . . , ˇsmt)T denotes the subvector of the mt-antenna-based
candidate vector ˇs comprising only indices higher than or equal to i. Furthermore, for each tentatively
assumed value of ˇsi we execute a successive recursive search step i −1, which is conditioned on the
hypotheses made in all preceding recursive steps j = i, . . . , mt. As substantiated by Equations (16.15)
and (16.16b), the value of the CSC function Ji(ˇsi) is dependent only on the values of the elements
{ˇsj}j=i,...,mt of the a priori candidate signal vector ˇs, which are hypothesized from step j = mt up
to the present step i of our recursive process. At each arrival at step i = 1 of the recursive process,
a complete candidate vector ˇs is hypothesized and the corresponding value of the cost function J(ˇs)
formulated in Equation (16.14) is evaluated.
Observe that the recursive hierarchical search procedure described above may be employed to
perform an exhaustive search through all possible values of the transmitted signal vector ˇs and the
resultant search process is guaranteed to arrive at the ML solution ˇsML, which minimizes the value
of the cost function J(ˇs) of Equation (16.14). Fortunately, however, as opposed to other ML search
schemes, the search process described above can be readily optimized, resulting in a dramatic reduction
of the associated computational complexity. Speciﬁcally, the potential optimization complexity gain
originates from the fact that most of the hierarchical search branches can be discarded at an early stage
of the recursive search process. The corresponding optimization rules proposed may be outlined as
follows.
Rule 1.
We reorder the system model of Equation (16.1) as suggested in [631]. Speciﬁcally, we apply
the best-ﬁrst detection strategy outlined in [265, pp. 754–756], which implies that the transmitted signal
vector components are detected in decreasing order of the associated channel quality. As advocated
in [265, pp. 754–756], the quality of the channel associated with the ith element of the transmitted
signal vector s is determined by the norm of the ith column of the channel matrix H. Consequently,
for applying the best-ﬁrst detection strategy, the columns of the channel matrix H are sorted in
increasing order of their norm. Thus, the resultant, column-reordered channel matrix H complies with
the following criterion:
∥(H)1∥2 ≤∥(H)2∥2 ≤· · · ≤∥(H)mt∥2,
(16.27)
where (H)i denotes the ith column of the channel matrix H. Note that the elements of the transmitted
signal vector s are reordered correspondingly, but their original order has to be reinstated in the ﬁnal
stage of the detection process.
Rule 2.
At each recursive detection index i = mt, . . . , 1, the potential candidate values, namely
{cm}m=1,...,M ∈M of the transmitted signal component si, are considered in increasing order of the
corresponding value of the subcost function φi(ˇsi) = φi(cm,ˇsi+1) of Equation (16.15), where
φi(c1,ˇsi+1) < · · · < φi(cm,ˇsi+1) < · · · < φi(cM,ˇsi+1),

16.1.1. OHRSA-Aided ML SDM Detection
523
and according to Equation (16.15),
φi(cm,ˇsi+1) = |uii(cm −ˆxi) + ai|2
= uii
cm −ˆxi + ai
u2
ii

2
.
(16.28)
Consequently, the more likely candidates cm of the ith element of the transmitted signal vector s are
examined ﬁrst. Observe that the sorting criterion of Equation (16.28) may also be interpreted as a biased
Euclidean distance of the candidate constellation point cm from the unconstrained MMSE estimate ˆxi
of the transmitted signal component si.
Rule 3.
We deﬁne a cut-off value of the cost function Jmin = min{J(ˇs)} as the minimum value
of the total cost function obtained up to the present point of the search process. Consequently, at each
arrival at step i = 1 of the recursive search process, the cut-off value of the cost function is updated as
follows:
Jmin = min{Jmin, J(ˇs)}.
(16.29)
Rule 4.
Finally, at each recursive detection step i, only the high probability search branches
corresponding to the highly likely symbol candidates cm resulting in low values of the CSC function
obeying Ji(cm) < Jmin are pursued. Furthermore, as follows from the sorting criterion of the
optimization Rule 2, as soon as the inequality Ji(cm) > Jmin is encountered, the search loop at the ith
detection step is discontinued.
An example of the search tree generated by the algorithm invoking Rules 1–4 described above is
depicted in Figure 16.2. The search trees shown correspond to the scenario of using QPSK modulation
and employing mt = nr = 8 antenna elements at both the transmitter and the receiver. The cases
of encountering the average SNRs of (a) 10 and (b) 20 dB were considered. Each step of the search
procedure is depicted as an ellipsoidal-shaped node. The label associated with each node indicates
the order of visitation, as well as the corresponding value of the CSC function Ji(ˇsi) formulated
in Equation (16.16), as seen in the brackets. As suggested by the fact that QPSK modulation is
considered, at each recursive step i, four legitimate search branches are possible. However, as can
be seen in Figure 16.2(a), only a small fraction of the potential search branches are actually pursued.
Observe that the rate of convergence of the algorithm proposed is particularly rapid at high values of
SNR. In the case of encountering low SNR values, the convergence rate decreases. Nevertheless, the
associated computational complexity is dramatically lower than that associated with an exhaustive ML
search.
The pseudo-code summarizing the recursive implementation of the OHRSA-ML SDM detector
proposed is depicted in Algorithm 16.1.
Given the cost functions of Equation (16.14) and the appropriately ordered matrix H of Equa-
tion (16.1), the proposed algorithm may be viewed as a speciﬁc manifestation of a tree search
algorithm [632]. Another example of a tree search algorithm commonly employed in the design of
communication systems constitutes the well-known Viterbi algorithm [314,633]. More speciﬁcally, the
subcost function values of Equation (16.15) may be regarded as being analogous to the branch metrics,
and the CSC values of Equation (16.16) to accumulated path metrics. It should be noted, however, that
the OHRSA-ML algorithm described here and the classic tree-search-based Viterbi algorithm exhibit
substantial differences. Speciﬁcally, the Viterbi algorithm assumes that the branch metric is a function of
the system states constituting one particular state transition, which is equivalent to assuming a diagonal
matrix U in Equation (16.7). Evidently, this requirement cannot be satisﬁed by our generic MIMO
system. Consequently, the tree-search-based Viterbi algorithm cannot be applied to the search problem
described above.

(16.31)
As before, our task is to obtain the ML estimate of the transmitted signal vector s. Firstly, we apply the
OHRSA-ML method of Algorithm 16.1.
As suggested by Algorithm 16.1, we commence the detection process by evaluating the quantities
U and ˆx of Equations (16.30c) and (16.30d) respectively, which yields
U =
	0.63
−0.85 + 0.27

1.45

,
ˆx =
	 0.43 −0.34
−1.10 −0.79

.
(16.32)
Furthermore, we proceed by calculating four values of the CSC function J2(ˇs2 = cm), m = 1, . . . , 4,
of Equation (16.30l) associated with the four different points cm of the QPSK constellation. For

526
Chapter 16. Log-MAP SDM-OFDM Multi-stream Detection
instance, we have
J2(ˇs2 = −1 −1) = φ2(ˇs2 = −1 −1) = |u22(ˇs2 −ˆx2)|2
= |1.45(−1 −1−(−1.10 −0.79))|2 = 0.12.
(16.33)
Subsequently, four QPSK symbol candidates cm are sorted in the order of increasing subcost function
φ2(cm), as described by Equation (16.30i) of Algorithm 16.1. For each hypothesized symbol value ˇs2 =
cm we can now obtain four values of the total cost function J(ˇs) = J1(ˇs1, ˇs2) of Equation (16.30l)
associated with four legitimate values of ˇs1 = cm. For instance, we have
J(ˇs1 = 1 −1, ˇs2 = −1 −1)
= J2(ˇs2 = −1 −1) + φ1(ˇs1 = 1 −1, ˇs2 = −1 −1)
= J2(ˇs2 = −1 −1) + |u11(ˇs1 −ˆx1)) + a1|2
= 0.12 + |0.63[1 −1−(0.43 −0.34)] + (−0.03 + 0.21)|2 = 0.27,
(16.34)
where the quantity a1 is given by Equation (16.30h) of Algorithm 16.1 as follows:
a1(ˇs2 = −1 −1) = u12(ˇs2 −ˆx2)
= (−0.85 + 0.27)[−1 −1−(−1.10 −0.79)] = −0.03 + 0.21.
(16.35)
As further detailed in Algorithm 16.1, we calculate the values of the total cost function J(ˇs1, ˇs2)
only for the speciﬁc hypothesis ˇs2, for which the value of the CSC function J2(ˇs2) is lower than the
minimum value Jmin obtained.
The resultant search tree is depicted in Figure 16.3(a), where, as before, each evaluation step, i.e.
each evaluation of the CSC function Ji(ˇsi) of Equation (16.30l), is indicated by an elliptic node.
Moreover, the label inside each node indicates the order of evaluation as well as the corresponding
value Ji(ˇsi) of the CSC function inside the brackets. The branches corresponding to four legitimate
values of the QPSK symbol are indicated by the speciﬁc type of the edges and nodes. Speciﬁcally, the
grey and black lines indicate the value of the real part of the QPSK symbol R{ˇsi} = −1 and 1, while
the dashed and solid lines indicate the value of the imaginary part I{ˇsi} = −1 and 1.
Example 16.3. Bit-wise OHRSA-ML QPSK 2 × 2
Let us consider a QPSK system identical to that described in Example 16.2 and attempt to derive
an alternative way of ﬁnding the ML estimate of the transmitted signal vector s using the bit-based
representation of the QPSK symbols. In order to describe this bit-based multi-user phasor constellation,
let us develop a matrix- and vector-based mathematical model. Firstly, observe that each point of the
QPSK constellation cm ∈M may be represented as the inner product cm = qTdm of a unique bit-
based vector dm = [dm1, dm2]T, dml = {−1, 1} and the vector q = [1, 1]T. For instance, we have
c1 = −1 −1= qTd1 =
#
1
1

(16.36)
Furthermore, let us deﬁne a (4 × 2)-dimensional matrix

(16.37)
where I is (2 × 2)-dimensional identity matrix, while ⊗denotes the matrix direct product [634].
Consequently, the QPSK-modulated signal vector s may be represented as

where t = [tT

2]T is a column supervector comprising the two bit-based vectors t1 and t2 associated
with the QPSK-modulated symbols s1 and s2, respectively.
Substituting Equation (16.38) into the system model of Equation (16.1) yields
y = HQt + w.
(16.39)
Moreover, since t is a real-valued vector, we can elaborate a bit further and deduce a real-valued system
model as follows:
	R{y}
I{y}

	R{HQ}
I{HQ}

t +

(16.41)
Thus, we arrive at the new system model of Equation (16.40), which may be interpreted as a (4 × 4)-

we have

Furthermore, the ﬁrst two steps of the recursive search process of Algorithm 16.1 are given by
J4(ˇt4 = −1) = |u44(ˇt4 −ˆx4)|2
= |1.45(−1 −(−0.79))|2 = 0.10
(16.43)
and
a3(ˇt4 = −1) = u34(ˇt4 −ˆx4)
= 0(−1 −(−0.79)) = 0,
J3(ˇt3 = −1, ˇt4 = −1) = |u33(ˇt3 −ˆx3) + a3|2
= |1.45(−1 −(−1.10)) + (0)|2 = 0.12.
(16.44)
On completing the recursive search process of Algorithm 16.1 we arrive at the search tree depicted
in Figure 16.3(b). As before, each evaluation step, i.e. each evaluation of the CSC function Ji(ˇti) of
Equation (16.30l), is indicated by an elliptic node. Moreover, the label inside each node indicates the
order of evaluation as well as the corresponding value Ji(ˇti) of the CSC function inside the brackets.
The branches corresponding to two legitimate values ˇti = −1 and 1 are indicated using the dashed and
solid edges and nodes, respectively.
Observe that the ML estimates ˆs and ˆt of Figures 16.3(a) and 16.3(b) are obtained within the same
number of evaluation steps. Nevertheless, the latter search procedure is constituted by lower-complexity
real-valued operations. Furthermore, in contrast to the detection method considered in Example 16.2,
the search method outlined in this QPSK-based example can be readily generalized for the scenario of
M-QAM SDM systems, as demonstrated in the forthcoming section.

as the corresponding value Ji(ˇsi) of the CSC function of Equation (16.16), as seen in the brackets.
16.1.2.1
Generalization of the BW-OHRSA-ML SDM Detector
In this section we generalize the result obtained in Section 16.1.1 to the case of systems employing
hyper-rectangular modulation schemes, namely M-QAM, where each modulated symbol belongs to a
discrete phasor constellation M = {cm}m=1,...,M. It is evident that each phasor point cm of an M-
QAM constellation map may be represented as the inner product of a unique bit-based vector dm =
{dml = −1, 1}l=1,...,b and the corresponding quantization vector q. Speciﬁcally, we have
cm = qTdm.
(16.45)
Some examples of the quantization vectors corresponding to the modulation schemes of BPSK, QPSK,
16-QAM as well as 64-QAM are portrayed in Table 16.1.
Furthermore, we deﬁne a (bmt × mt)-dimensional quantization matrix Q = I ⊗q, where I is
an (mt × mt)-dimensional identity matrix and q is the aforementioned quantization vector, while ⊗
denotes the matrix direct product [634]. Consequently the M-QAM-modulated signal vector s may be
represented as
s = Qt,
(16.46)
where t = [tT
1, . . . , tT
mt]T is a column supervector comprising the bit-based vectors ti associated with
each transmitted signal vector component si. Substituting Equation (16.46) into the system model of
Equation (16.1) yields
y = HQt + w.
(16.47)

Moreover, since t is a real-valued vector, we can elaborate a bit further and deduce a real-valued system
model as follows:
˜y =

I{y}

=
	R{HQ}
I{HQ}

t +
	R{w}
I{w}

= ˜Ht + ˜w,
(16.48)
where ˜H is a real-valued (2nr × bmt)-dimensional bit-wise channel matrix. Observe in Equa-
tion (16.47) that the requirement of having constant modulus symbols is satisﬁed by the modiﬁed system
model of Equation (16.47), since we have |ti|2 = 1 and thus the method described in Section 16.1.1
and summarized in Algorithm 16.1 is applicable for the evaluation of the bit-wise ML estimate ˆt of
Equation (16.47). Consequently, we apply the following changes to Algorithm 16.1:
1. Include the evaluation of the bit-wise channel matrix ˜H in (16.49a).
2. Adjust the number of candidate bit values of ti to dm = {−1, 1} in (16.49l).
Hence we arrive at a new detection technique, namely the bit-wise OHRSA-ML SDM detector, which
is summarized in Algorithm 16.2.
The operation of Algorithm 16.2 is illustrated by the search tree diagram depicted in Figure 16.4.
Each circular node in the diagram represents a subvector candidate ˇti = {ˇtj}j=i,...,r of the transmitted
bit-based signal vector t. The solid and open nodes denote the binary values of the bit ˇti = {−1, 1}
assumed in the current step of the recursive search process. The corresponding values of the CSC
function Ji(ˇti) are indicated by the tint and thickness of the transitions connecting each child or
descendant node ˇti with the corresponding parent node ˇti+1. The search tree diagram depicted in
Figure 16.4 corresponds to the system scenario employing QPSK modulation, mt = nr = 8 operating
at the average SNR of 6 dB. Observe that the ML solution is attained in 139 evaluation steps in
comparison with the 216 = 65 536 evaluation steps required by the exhaustive ML search.
16.1.3
OHRSA-Aided Log-MAP SDM Detection
It is evident [265] that the BER associated with the process of communicating over a noisy fading
MIMO channel can be dramatically reduced by means of channel coding. A particularly effective
channel coding scheme is constituted by the soft-input, soft-output turbo coding method [314]. Turbo
coding, however, requires soft information concerning the bit decisions at the output of the SDM
detector, in other words the a posteriori soft information regarding the conﬁdence of the bit decision is
required.
The derivation of an expression for the low-complexity evaluation of the soft-bit information
associated with the bit estimates of the SDM detector’s output characterized by Equation (16.5) is
given in [265]. Here, we present a brief summary of the results deduced in [265].

Figure 16.4: Example of a search tree formed by the BW-OHRSA method of Algorithm 16.2 in the
scenario of QPSK, mt = nr = 8 and an average SNR of 6 dB. Each circular node in the diagram
represents a subvector candidate ˇti = {ˇtj}j=i,...,r of the transmitted bit-based signal vector t. The
solid and open nodes denote the duo-binary values of the bit ˇti = {−1, 1} assumed. The corresponding
value of the CSC function Ji(ˇti) quantiﬁed in Equation (16.17b) is indicated by both the tint and the
thickness of the transitions connecting each child node ˇti with the corresponding parent node ˇti+1. The
ML solution is attained in 139 evaluation steps in comparison with the 216 = 65 536 evaluation steps
required by the exhaustive ML search.
Correspondingly, the soft-bit value associated with the mth bit of the QAM symbol transmitted
from the ith transmit antenna element is determined by the Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR) values deﬁned
in [623] as
Lim = log P(bim = 1)

However, the direct calculation of the accumulated a posteriori conditional probabilities in the
numerator and denominator of Equation (16.52) may have an excessive complexity in practice.
Fortunately, as advocated in [265], the LLR values characterized in Equation (16.52) may be closely

we have

As suggested by the nature of Equation (16.54), the detection process employing the objective function
determined by Equations (16.54) and (16.55) is usually referred to as the Logarithmic Maximum-A-
Posteriori (Log-MAP) probability detector.
A practical version of the Log-MAP detector may be derived as follows. Substituting Equa-
tion (16.4) into Equations (16.52) and (16.50) yields

(16.57)
respectively. Note that Equation (16.57) involves two summations over 2rmt−1 exponential functions.
This operation may potentially impose an excessive computational complexity for large values of mt
and/or r. However, as demonstrated in [265], the expression in (16.57) may be closely approximated by
a substantially simpler expression, namely
Lim ≈

associated with the modulation scheme employed, which comprises the bit value b = {0, 1} at the
mth bit position of the ith signal vector component.
The Log-MAP detector deﬁned by Equations (16.58) and (16.59) may be applied to obtain the
soft-bit information associated with the bit-wise OHRSA-ML SDM detector derived in Section 16.1.2.
Consequently, substituting the bit-wise system model of Equation (16.47) into (16.58) and (16.59)
yields

(16.62)
where ˇtm
i;min and the corresponding cost function value J(ˇtm
i;min) may be obtained by applying the
constrained OHRSA-ML detection method derived in Section 16.1.2.
Consequently, the evaluation of the bit-wise Max-Log-MAP estimates of the transmitted bit-wise
signal vector t involves repetitive evaluation of 2r constrained ML estimates ˇtm
i;min along with the
associated 2r values of the objective function J(ˇtm
i;min).
Example 16.4. OHRSA-Log-MAP BPSK 3 × 3
Consider a BPSK system having nr = mt = 3 transmit and receive antennas, which is described
by Equation (16.1). The transmitted signal s, received signal y as well as the channel matrix H of
Equation (16.1) are exempliﬁed by the following values:
s =

(16.63)
Observe that the channel matrix H of Equation (16.63) happens to be best-ﬁrst ordered and does not
require any further reordering. Furthermore, in our scenario of BPSK modulation the channel matrix H
of Equation (16.63) is equivalent to the bit-wise channel matrix ˜H of Algorithm 16.3.
Subsequently, our task is to obtain the Log-MAP estimate of the transmitted signal vector t = s. We
apply the OHRSA-Log-MAP method of Algorithm 16.3. Firstly, we evaluate the triangular matrix U of
Equation (16.85d) as well as the unconstrained MMSE estimate ˆx of Equation (16.85e). The resultant
quantities are given by
U =

(16.64)
Secondly, as further suggested by Algorithm 16.3, for each transmitted bit-wise symbol ti we calculate
the quantities J(ˇt−1
i;min) and J(ˇt1
i;min) corresponding to the values of the cost function J(ˇt) of
Equation (16.85o) associated with the constrained ML estimates of the transmitted bit-wise vector t
with the ith bit component assuming values of −1 and 1, respectively.
For instance, the cost function value J(ˇt−1
1;min) associated with the ML estimate of the bit-wise
signal vector t constrained by bit-component value ˇt1 = −1 may be calculated as follows:
J3(ˇt3 = 1) = |u33(ˇt3 −ˆx3)|2 = (0.46(1 −(0.13)))2 = 0.16,
a2(ˇt3 = 1) = u23(ˇt3 −ˆx3) = −1.35(1 −(0.13)) = −1.17,
J2(ˇt2 = 1, ˇt3 = 1) = J3(ˇt3 = 1) + |u22(ˇt2 −ˆx2) + a2|2
= 0.16 + |1.35(1 −(−0.01)) + (−1.17)|2 = 0.20.
(16.65)
Furthermore, we have
a1(ˇt2 = 1, ˇt3 = 1) = u12(ˇt2 −ˆx2) + u13(ˇt3 −ˆx3)
= −0.07(1 −(−0.01)) + 0.09(1 −(0.13)) = 0.00,
J(ˇt−1
1;min) = J1(ˇt1 = −1, ˇt2 = 1, ˇt3 = 1)
= J2(ˇt2 = 1, ˇt3 = 1) + |u11(ˇt1 −ˆx1) + a1|2
= 0.20 + |0.56(−1 −(−0.80)) + (0.00)|2 = 0.21.

Observe that, for the sake of brevity, we omit the calculation of the CSC values outside the major search
branch of Algorithm 16.3, i.e. outside the search branch leading to the constrained ML estimate. The
corresponding search tree formed by the evaluation of the value of J(ˇs−1
1;min) using Algorithm 16.3 is
depicted in Figure 16.5(a). Furthermore, Figures 16.5(b)–(f) illustrate the search trees formed by the
search subprocesses of Algorithm 16.3 corresponding to the remaining ﬁve values {J(ˇsb
i;min)}b=−1,1
i=1,...,3.
Finally, upon completing the calculation of all six values {J(ˇsb
i;min)}b=−1,1
i=1,...,3 we arrive at the
following matrix:
ˆJ = {J(ˇsb

(16.67)
where the elements of the matrix ˆJ, which we refer to as the Minimum Cost Function (MCF) matrix,
are deﬁned as ˆJij = J(ˇs
bj
i;min). Consequently, the soft-bit vector representing the Log-MAP estimate
of the transmitted bit-wise signal vector t may be expressed as
L = 1

(16.68)
where (ˆJ)j denotes the jth column of the MCF matrix ˆJ deﬁned in Equation (16.67).
Example 16.5. OHRSA Approximate Log-MAP BPSK 3 × 3
Again, consider a BPSK system identical to that described in Example 16.4. Speciﬁcally, we have a
(3 × 3)-dimensional real-valued linear system described by Equation (16.1) with the corresponding
transmitted signal s, the received signal y and the channel matrix H described in Equation (16.63). In
this example we want to demonstrate an alternative search paradigm, which avoids the repetitive process
characterized by Algorithm 16.3 and exempliﬁed in Figure 16.5 of Example 16.4, while obtaining a
similar result.
Firstly, we apply the OHRSA-ML method of Algorithm 16.2. The triangular matrix U of
Equation (16.49d) as well as the unconstrained MMSE estimate ˆx of Equation (16.49e) are similar
to those evaluated in Example 16.4 and are characterized by Equation (16.64). The resultant search
process is characterized by the search tree diagram portrayed in Figure 16.6(a).
Additionally, however, we deﬁne a (3 × 2)-dimensional MCF matrix ˆJ, which will be used for
evaluation of the soft-bit information, and assign to it an initial value of ˆJ = J0 1, where 1 is a
(3 × 2)-dimensional matrix of ones and J0 ≫γ is some large constant, which should be greater than
the average SNR of γ = 10 encountered. For instance, let us assume J0 = 100. Subsequently, the
cost-function-related matrix ˆJ is updated according to a procedure to be outlined below each time the
search branch forming the search tree portrayed in Figure 16.6(a) is terminated, regardless of whether its
termination occurred owing to reaching the ﬁnal recursive index value of i = 1, or owing to exceeding
the minimum value of the cost function Jmin. More speciﬁcally, we update the elements of the matrix
ˆJ corresponding to the bit-wise symbols ˇtj, j = i, . . . , 3, constituting the bit-wise subvector candidate
ˇti associated with the particular search branch, as outlined below:
ˆJjbj = min{ ˆJjbj , Ji(ˇti)},
j = i, . . . , 3,
ˇtj = {−1, 1}bj .
(16.69)
For instance, on completing the ﬁrst, leftmost search branch depicted in Figure 16.6(a) and associated
with the transmitted signal candidate ˇt =
#
−1

$T, i.e. on reaching node 3 of the search tree, the
following update of the MCF matrix ˆJ is performed:
ˆJ11 = min{ ˆJ11, J(ˇt)} = min{100, 0.21} = 0.21
ˆJ22 = ˆJ32 = min{100, 0.21} = 0.21.

Algorithm 16.2 using different values of the parameter ρ, namely (a) 1.0, (b) 1.3 and (c) 2.0. We
consider a system employing BPSK modulation, mt = nr = 3 transmit and receive antennas and
encountering an average SNR of 10 dB. The labels indicate the order of evaluation, as well as the
corresponding value Ji(ˇsi) of the CSC function of Equation (16.16), as seen in the brackets.
Finally, by substituting the resultant value of the MCF matrix ˆJ(6) into Equation (16.68) we obtain the
following soft-bit estimate of the transmitted bit-wise signal vector t:
La =


−9
62.39


.
(16.73)
Observe that the soft-bit estimate La of Equation (16.73) appears to be considerably more reliable
than the MMSE estimate ˆx of Equation (16.64). Speciﬁcally, as opposed to the MMSE estimate ˆx
in Equation (16.19), the direct slicing of the soft-bit estimate La results in the correct signal vector
s of Equation (16.63). Moreover, the soft-bit estimate La provides further information concerning the
reliability of each estimated bit, albeit the resultant soft-bit information of Equation (16.73) substantially
deviates from the more reliable exact Log-MAP estimate L given by Equation (16.68).
Fortunately, however, the precision of the soft-bit estimate La may be readily improved. Speciﬁ-
cally, we introduce an additional parameter ρ, which will allow us to control the rate of convergence
in the search process of Algorithm 16.2 by increasing the threshold value of the CSC function,
which controls the passage of the recursive search process through low-likelihood search branches
having CSC function values Ji(ˇti) in excess of ρJmin, as opposed to Jmin of Equation (16.49o) in
Algorithm 16.2. Let us now execute the modiﬁed OHRSA-ML method of Algorithm 16.2, where the
condition Ji < Jmin of Equation (16.49o) is replaced by the corresponding condition of Ji < ρJmin.
The search trees formed by the execution of the modiﬁed Algorithm 16.2 in the scenarios of setting
(b) ρ = 1.3 and (c) ρ = 2.0 are depicted in Figures 16.5(b) and 16.5(c), respectively. Furthermore, the
convergence of the MCF matrix ˆJ as well as the resultant soft-bit estimate L in both scenarios may be

where, as before, ˆJ(n) denotes the state of the MCF matrix at search step n corresponding to the nth

by Figures 16.5(b) and 16.5(c) merely expand the search process portrayed in Figure 16.5(a).
Consequently, for the sake of brevity, the corresponding Equations (16.74) and (16.75) depict only
the extra states of the MCF matrix introduced by the expanded search procedure. For instance, the
states ˆJ(10) and ˆJ(8) of Equation (16.75) complement the state ˆJ(7) of Equation (16.74), as well as
the states ˆJ(6), ˆJ(5), ˆJ(4) and ˆJ(3) of Equations (16.71) and (16.72), respectively.
Finally, by comparing the resultant soft-bit estimates La, Lb and Lc of Equations (16.73), (16.74)
and (16.75), corresponding to the scaling values of ρ = 1.0, 1.3 and 2.0, to the corresponding Log-MAP
estimate L of Equation (16.68), we may hypothesize that the value of the soft-bit estimate obtained by
the modiﬁed OHRSA-ML method of Algorithm 16.2 rapidly converges to the Log-MAP estimate of the
OHRSA-Log-MAP method of Algorithm 16.3 on increasing the value of the parameter ρ. As expected,
there is a trade-off between the accuracy of the soft-bit information obtained and the corresponding
computational complexity associated with the particular choice of ρ. In the next section we will
generalize the results obtained in this example and substantiate the aforementioned convergence-related
hypothesis, as well as deduce the optimal value of the associated scaling parameter ρ.
16.1.4
Soft-Input, Soft-Output Max-Log-MAP SDM Detection
The OHRSA-aided Max-Log-MAP SDM detection method outlined in Section 16.1.3 may be easily
adopted to exploit any a priori bit-related soft information available. More speciﬁcally, in Section 16.1.3
we assumed having equiprobable transmitted phasors ˇs. Correspondingly, in order to accommodate any
available a priori probability information P(ˇti) associated with the estimated bit values ti, i = 1, . . . , r,
Equations (16.60) and (16.61) may be modiﬁed as follows:
Li ≈1

(16.76)

b = 0, 1,
(16.77)
where, again, Db;r
i
denotes the subset of the entire set Dr of (r = mt log2 M)-dimensional bit-wise
vectors, which comprise the binary value ˇti = db = {−1, 1} at the ith bit position.
In practice, the probability-related soft information associated with the estimated bit values ti is
conveyed using the LLR values Li. Correspondingly, the logarithm of the probability value log(P(ˇt))
of Equation (16.61) may be calculated as follows [314]:
log(P(ˇt)) =

i
P(ˇti),
(16.78)
where
P(ˇti = −1) = JacLog(0, Li)
(16.79)

538
Chapter 16. Log-MAP SDM-OFDM Multi-stream Detection
and
P(ˇti = 1) = 1 −JacLog(0, Li),
(16.80)
where JacLog(·) denotes the Jacobian logarithm [635] deﬁned as JacLog(a, b) = log(ea + eb).
The resultant a priori probability values P(ˇti) may be incorporated into the OHRSA SDM
detector of Algorithm 16.2. That is, cost function constituent φi of Equation (16.49k) is redeﬁned to
accommodate the a priori log-probabilistic information P(ˇti) as follows:
φi(d) = |uii(d −ˆxi) + ai|2 −σ2
wP(ˇti).
(16.81)
The pseudo-code describing the implementation of the bit-wise soft-input, soft-output OHRSA Max-
Log-MAP SDM detector is summarized in Algorithm 16.3.
Clearly, the repetitive nature of the search process entailing Equations (16.85f, i–r) in Al-
gorithm 16.3 and exempliﬁed by Example 16.4 imposes a substantial increase on the associated
computational complexity. Hence, in the next section we derive an OHRSA-aided approximate Log-
MAP method which is capable of approaching the optimum Log-MAP performance, while avoiding
the repetitive evaluation of Equation (16.85f) in Algorithm 16.3 and therefore imposes considerably
reduced complexity requirements.
16.1.5
SOPHIE-Aided Approximate Log-MAP SDM Detection
Let us deﬁne the (r × 2)-dimensional Bit-wise Minimum Cost (BMC) function matrix ˆJ having
elements as follows:
ˆJib = J(ˆtb
i), i = 1, . . . , r, b = −1, 1,
(16.82)
where ˆtb
i is deﬁned by Equation (16.59). Using the BMC matrix of Equation (16.82), Equation (16.62)
may also be expressed in vectorial form as
L = 1
σ2w
[(ˆJ)1 −(ˆJ)2],
(16.83)
where, as before, (ˆJ)b denotes the bth column of the matrix ˆJ having elements deﬁned by Equa-
tion (16.82).
Consequently, in order to evaluate the bit-related soft information we have to populate the BMC
matrix ˆJ of Equation (16.82) with the corresponding values of the cost function of Equation (16.82).
Observe that the evaluation of the ML estimate ˆt will situate half the elements of the cost matrix ˆJ with
the corresponding minimum value of the cost function associated with the ML estimate, such that we
have
Jib = J(ˆt), i = 1, . . . , r, b = ˆti.
(16.84)
Subsequently, let us introduce the following adjustments to Algorithm 16.2. Firstly, we introduce an
additional parameter ρ, which we refer to as the search radius factor. More speciﬁcally, the parameter
ρ allows us to control the rate of convergence for the tree search process of Algorithm 16.2 and affects
the cut-off value of a CSC function, which limits the passage of the recursive search process through
low-likelihood search branches having a CSC function value Ji(ˇti) in excess of ρJmin, as opposed to
Jmin. Thus, the following rule replaces Rule 4 of Section 16.1.1.1.
Rule 4a.
At each recursive detection level i, only the high-probability search branches corresponding
to the highly likely symbol candidates cm resulting in low values of the CSC function obeying Ji(cm) <
ρJmin are pursued. Furthermore, as follows from the sorting criterion of the optimization in Rule 2, as
soon as the inequality Ji(cm) > ρJmin is satisﬁed, the search loop at the ith recursive detection level
is discontinued.
Secondly, we introduce an additional rule which facilitates the evaluation of the elements of the
BMC matrix ˆJ of Equation (16.82). Explicitly, we postulate Rule 5.

That is, we have
ˆJib = min{ ˆJib, J(ˇt)},
i = 1, . . . , r, b = ˇti.
(16.86)
Subsequently, we suggest that the evaluation of the BMC matrix ˆJ, which is performed in the process of
the ML search of Algorithm 16.2 extended by Rule 4a and using Rule 5, will allow us to provide reliable
soft-bit information, while imposing a relatively low computational complexity. The main rationale of
this assumption will be outlined in our quantitative complexity and performance analysis portrayed in
Section 16.1.5.1.
As we will further demonstrate in Section 16.1.5.1, the resultant approximate Log-MAP SDM
detector exhibits a particularly low complexity at high SNR values. On the other hand, at low
SNR values the associated complexity substantially increases. Consequently, in order to control
the computational complexity at low SNR values, we introduce the additional complexity control
parameter γ. Our aim is to avoid the computationally demanding and yet inefﬁcient detection of the
speciﬁc signal components which have their signal energy well below the noise ﬂoor. More speciﬁcally,
we modify Equation (16.49p) of Algorithm 16.2 according to Rule 6.
Rule 6.
The branching of the tree search described by Algorithm 16.2 is truncated if the SNR
associated with the corresponding signal component is lower than the value of the complexity control
parameter γ. In other words, the search along a given branch is truncated if we have ∥Hi∥2/σ2
w < γ.
On applying Rules 4, 5 and 6 in the context of the OHRSA-ML method of Algorithm 16.2, we
arrive at an approximate OHRSA-Log-MAP SDM detector, which avoids the repetitive search required
by the OHRSA-Log-MAP SDM detector of Section 16.1.3. The resultant OHRSA-aided approximate
Log-MAP SDM detector, which we refer to as the SOPHIE (Soft-output OPtimized HIErarchy) SDM
detector, is summarized in Algorithm 16.4 and exempliﬁed in Figure 16.7.

SOPHIE Algorithm Complexity Analysis
As pointed out in [265], ‘the brute-force’ ML SDM detection method does not provide a feasible
solution to the generic SDM detection problem, as a result of the excessive associated computational
complexity. More explicitly, the ML SDM detector advocated in [265]has a computational complexity

542
Chapter 16. Log-MAP SDM-OFDM Multi-stream Detection
of the order of
CML = O{M mt · (3nr + 2nrmt)},
(16.88)
where 3nr + 2nrmt is the complexity associated with a single search step, namely with the evaluation
of the objective function value ∥Hˇs −y∥2, while M mt is the number of legitimate candidates
of the transmitted signal vector s. Clearly, the order of complexity imposed by Equation (16.88)
becomes excessive for a large number of transmit antennas, e.g. in the case of employing 16-QAM
and mt = nr = 8 transmit and receive antennas, where the computational complexity associated with
ML detection is of the order of 107 complex operations per channel use, or 109 complex operations per
OFDM symbol formed by K = 128 subcarriers. Furthermore, the evaluation of the soft-bit information
required by an efﬁcient turbo-decoder implementation imposes a further substantial increase on the
associated computational complexity. Speciﬁcally, the soft-output Log-MAP SDM detector advocated
in [265] has a computational complexity of the order of
CLM = O{mt log2M · 2mt log2 M−1 · (3nr + 2nrmt)}.
(16.89)
On the other hand, the MMSE SDM detector derived in [265]constitutes the low-complexity SDM
detector. The complexity imposed by the MMSE SDM detector of [265]may be shown to be of the
order of
CMMSE = O{m3
t + mtn2
r + m2
tnr + mtnr}.
(16.90)
Clearly, the MMSE SDM detector’s complexity is substantially lower than that associated with the ML
or Log-MAP SDM detectors. Speciﬁcally, for example, only 1600 complex operations are required for
detecting 16-QAM signals transmitted and received by mt = nr = 8 transmit and receive antennas.
Unfortunately, however, as demonstrated in [265], the achievable performance exhibited by the linear
MMSE SDM detector is considerably lower than that attained by the optimal Log-MAP SDM detector
advocated in [265]. Moreover, linear SDM detectors such as the MMSE detector do not allow for the
high-integrity detection of signals in the overloaded scenario, where the number of transmit antennas
exceeds that of receive antennas.
Consequently, in Sections 16.1.2, 16.1.3 and 16.1.5 we have derived a family of methods which
combine the advantageous properties of the ML and Log-MAP detection, while imposing a substantially
lower complexity. In this section we demonstrate that the computational complexity associated with the
SOPHIE-aided Log-MAP SDM detector of Algorithm 16.4 is in fact only slightly higher than that
imposed by the low-complexity MMSE SDM detector advocated in [265], while its performance is
virtually identical to the performance of the Log-MAP SDM detector [265].
The direct calculation of the complexity associated with the OHRSA methods of Algorithms 16.2,
16.3 and 16.4 is infeasible, since the complexity is a random variable which is a function of several
parameters, such as the number mt and nr of transmit and receive antennas, the average SNR
encountered as well as the value of the parameter ρ in Algorithm 16.4. Therefore, we perform the
corresponding complexity analysis using computer simulations.
Figure 16.8(a) illustrates our comparison between the computational complexity required by
different SDM detection methods, namely the linear MMSE detector advocated in [265], the SIC
detector of [265, pp. 754–756], the exhaustive search-based ML and Log-MAP detectors of [265]as well
as the OHRSA-aided ML, Log-MAP and SOPHIE SDM detectors of Algorithms 16.2, 16.3 and 16.4,
respectively. The results depicted in Figure 16.8(a) correspond to the fully loaded scenario, where we
have mt = nr transmit and receive antennas. Observe that the complexity associated with both the
OHRSA-ML and SOPHIE SDM detectors is only slightly higher than that imposed by the MMSE
SDM detector and is in fact lower than the complexity imposed by the SIC SDM detector.
Furthermore, the achievable performance of the SDM-OFDM system employing the different
SDM detection methods considered is depicted in Figure 16.8(b). Observe that both the OHRSA-Log-
MAP and SOPHIE SDM detectors considerably outperform the linear MMSE detector. Moreover, the
associated BER decreases upon increasing the number of transmit and receive antennas mt = nr,
which suggests that, as opposed to both the MMSE and the SIC SDM detectors, the OHRSA-Log-MAP

receive antenna elements. The corresponding system parameters are summarized in Table 7.1.
SDM detector is capable of achieving spatial diversity even in the fully loaded system. In other words, it
is capable of simultaneously achieving both multiplexing and diversity gains, while maintaining a low
computational complexity.
The relatively low performance of the OHRSA-ML SDM detector may be attributed to the fact
that it produces no soft-bit information and therefore the efﬁciency of the turbo code employed is
substantially degraded. Moreover, observe that while the SIC SDM detector outperforms its MMSE
counterpart at high SNR values [265], the achievable performance of the two methods is fairly similar
at low SNR values, such as 6 dB.
Additionally, Figure 16.9 illustrates the complexity imposed by the OHRSA methods of Algo-
rithms 16.2, 16.3 and 16.4 as a function of the average SNR encountered. Figures 16.9(a) and 16.9(b)
portray the average complexity encountered in the scenarios of mt = nr = 8 and mt = 8, nr = 4
transmit and receive antennas, respectively. Observe that the complexity associated with both the
OHRSA-ML and SOPHIE methods of Algorithms 16.3 and 16.4 is mainly determined by the number
mt of transmit antennas employed. Furthermore, the complexity associated with the SOPHIE method
closely matches that exhibited by the OHRSA-ML method at high SNR values and the complexity
exhibited by both methods is only slightly higher than the complexity exhibited by the low-complexity
MMSE SDM detector.

OHRSA-aided SDM detection schemes described in Section 16.1. Our simulations were performed in
the baseband frequency domain and the system conﬁguration characterized in Table 7.1 is to a large
extent similar to that used in [260]. We assume a total bandwidth of 800 kHz. The OFDM system

2 turbo coding [314] employing two constraint-length K = 3 Recursive Systematic Convolutional
(RSC) component codes and the standard 124-bit WCDMA UMTS turbo code interleaver of [512].
The octally represented RCS generator polynomials of (7, 5) were used. Furthermore, we employ the
eight-path urban non-line-of-sight Bug Rayleigh fading channel model characterized in [346]. Finally,
throughout this report we stipulate the assumption of perfect channel knowledge, where knowledge of
the frequency-domain subcarrier-related coefﬁcients H[n, k] is deemed to be available in the receiver.
Figure 16.10 characterizes the achievable performance as well as the associated computational
complexity exhibited by the 4×4 16-QAM-SDM-OFDM system employing the SOPHIE SDM detector
of Algorithm 16.4. More speciﬁcally, we analyse the associated performance versus complexity trade-
offs of using various values of the complexity control parameters ρ and γ. In Figure 16.10(a) we can
observe how the achievable BER performance (top) and the corresponding computational complexity
depend on the value of the parameter γ. Using the results depicted in Figure 16.10(a) we may conclude
that the optimum choice of the complexity control parameter γ lies in the range 0.5–0.8, where we have
a minor BER performance degradation of less than 0.5 dB, while achieving a complexity reduction
up to two orders of magnitude at low SNR values, when compared with the full-complexity SOPHIE
algorithm assuming γ = 0.
On the other hand, Figure 16.10(b) portrays both the achievable BER performance and the
associated complexity of the 4×4 16-QAM-SDM-OFDM system for different values of the complexity
control parameter ρ. We may conclude that the optimum trade-off between the attainable BER
performance and the associated complexity is achieved when the value of the complexity control
parameter ρ lies in the range of 1.3–1.5, where the BER performance degradation imposed does not

Furthermore, Figure 16.11(a) demonstrates both the BER performance (top) and the associated
computational complexity exhibited by the (8 × 8) 4-, 16- and 64-QAM-SDM-OFDM systems

SDM-OFDM system employing the SOPHIE SDM detector of Algorithm 16.4 and having a constant

arriving from various numbers of transmit antenna elements. Speciﬁcally, we aim at exploring the
performance of the SOPHIE SDM detector in the overloaded system scenario, where the number of
transmit antenna elements exceeds that of receiver elements and thus we have mt > nr. Indeed, the

SDM detector of Algorithm 16.4 in both systems employing high-throughput modulation schemes as

speciﬁcally, we consider three ranges of SNR values: low SNRs, the critical SNR, which corresponds
to the ‘waterfall’ region of the BER versus SNR curve, as well as high SNRs, which correspond to the
error-free detection region. In Figure 16.12 we can see that the computational complexity imposed by

Figure 16.13(a) demonstrates that the SDM-OFDM system employing the SOPHIE SDM detector
of Algorithm 16.4 is capable of exploiting the available MIMO channel’s multiplexing gain in the
fully loaded system scenario, when the number of transmit antenna elements mt is equal to that of
receiver antenna elements nr. More speciﬁcally, the results depicted in Figure 16.13(a) suggest that
the SDM-OFDM SOPHIE SDM detector having mt = nr = 8 transmit and receive antennas exhibits
an SNR-related diversity gain of 2 dB at the target BER of 10−4, as well as a higher throughput by a
factor of four, when compared with the same system employing two antennas at both the transmitter
and receiver.
Additionally, Figure 16.13(b) characterizes the SDM-OFDM system employing the SOPHIE SDM
detector of Algorithm 16.4 and having a constant number of nr = 4 receive antenna elements in terms of

Speciﬁcally, we aim at exploring the performance of the SOPHIE SDM detector in the overloaded
system scenario, where the number of transmit antenna elements exceeds that of receiver elements
and thus we have mt > nr. We can see that, as opposed to the MMSE SDM detector [265], the
SOPHIE SDM detector exhibits a good performance both when we have mt ≤nr and in the overloaded
system scenario, when the number of transmit antenna elements exceeds the number of receive antenna
elements, i.e. when we have mt > nr.

Iterative Channel Estimation and
Multi-stream Detection for
SDM-OFDM
17.1
Iterative Signal Processing
Despite the immense interest of both the academic and the industrial research communities, the
conception of a practical multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) transceiver architecture which is
capable of approaching the MIMO channel’s capacity in realistic channel conditions remains largely
an open problem. An important overview encompassing most major aspects of broadband MIMO-
OFDM wireless communications including both channel estimation and signal detection, as well as
time- and frequency-domain synchronization, was contributed by St¨uber et al. [295]. Other important
publications considering MIMO systems operating in realistic channel conditions include those by
M¨unster and Hanzo [297], Li et al. [294], Mai et al. as well as Qiao et al. [308]. Nevertheless, substantial
contributions addressing all the major issues pertaining to the design of MIMO transceivers, namely
error correction, space–time detection and channel estimation, in realistic channel conditions remain
scarce.
Against this background, in this chapter we introduce an iterative, so-called turbo Multi-Antenna,
Multi-Carrier (MAMC) receiver architecture. Our turbo receiver is illustrated in Figure 17.1. Following
the philosophy of turbo processing [314], our turbo SDM-OFDM receiver comprises a succession
of detection modules which iteratively exchange soft-bit-related information and thus facilitate a
substantial improvement in the overall system performance.
More speciﬁcally, our turbo SDM-OFDM receiver comprises three major components, namely
the soft-feedback decision-directed channel estimator detailed in Section 7.8, followed by the soft-
input, soft-output OHRSA Log-MAP SDM detector derived in Section 16.1.3, and a classic parallel-
concatenated soft-input, soft-output turbo code [345]. Consequently, in this chapter we analyse the
achievable performance of each individual constituent of our turbo receiver, as well as the achievable
performance of the entire iterative system. Our aim is to document the various design trade-offs, such
as the achievable error-rate performance, the attainable data rate and the associated computational
complexity.

17.2
Turbo Forward Error-Correction Coding
The family of the so-called turbo codes was ﬁrst introduced by Berrou et al. [345, 636, 637]. The
properties of turbo codes have been extensively studied in the context of various system architectures
by a multiplicity of authors, for instance Benedetto [638], Battail [639], ¨Omer et al. [640] and Hanzo
et al. [314]. The plausible conclusion of these studies was that turbo codes are capable of approaching
capacity, while imposing a realistic computational complexity.
Consequently, at the ﬁrst stage of our iterative turbo receiver architecture illustrated in Figure 17.1
we employ a turbo decoder. The detailed structure of the turbo decoder considered is depicted in
Figure 17.2. More speciﬁcally, our turbo decoder consists of a pair of parallel-concatenated Soft-
Input, Soft-Output (SISO) RSC decoders which iteratively exchange information-bit-related extrinsic
information in the form of LLR values Lex to attain the highest possible reliability of the decoded
information-carrying bits. In this treatise we employed two rate 1
2 punctured RSC codes [640]. Observe
that the parallel-concatenated codes share the same information bits, while the corresponding parity bits
at the output of the encoder are punctured, which results in the overall concatenated code rate of 1
2. The
octally represented RCS generator polynomials of (7, 5) having a constraint length of 3 were used for
both RCS codes. Note also that in the introduction of this treatise, namely in Figure 1.7, we depicted
a serial-concatenated turbo decoder. In contrast, as seen in Figures 17.1 and 17.2, in this chapter we
employed a parallel-concatenated code, reminiscent of that derived in [345]. Both the parallel and the
serial versions of turbo codes are applicable in our system. Both methods were found to exhibit fairly
similar performance, but in the rest of this chapter we will focus our attention on the former.
In this section we quantify the achievable performance of the turbo code considered in the context
of increasingly more sophisticated systems communicating under increasingly more realistic channel
conditions. We commence our discourse by characterizing the achievable BER performance of the turbo
code in the uncorrelated Rayleigh fading in Figure 17.3. Subsequently, in Figure 17.4 we consider the

BER performance of the turbo code in the context of a 128-subcarrier OFDM system encountering both
uncorrelated Rayleigh fading in the time domain as well as correlated fading having a time-domain
correlation determined by the OFDM-symbol-normalized Doppler frequency spanning the range of
fD = 0.1 to 0.003.
More speciﬁcally, to characterize the achievable BER performance, in Figure 17.3 we portray the
BER performance of the parallel-concatenated turbo decoder when encountering uncorrelated Rayleigh
fading. More speciﬁcally, we considered a narrowband single-carrier QPSK-modulated system which
employs a time-domain random block interleaver encompassing 1000 consecutive bits. Observe that
the BER performance exhibited by the turbo decoder improves rapidly on increasing the number of
decoding iterations performed. Furthermore, the decoder approaches its best possible performance after
eight iterations. Consequently, in our further studies we consider performing idec = 8 iterations by the
turbo decoder.
On a similar note, Figure 17.4 characterizes the achievable BER performance of the turbo decoder
considered in the context of a QPSK-modulated OFDM system, while encountering a Rayleigh
fading channel exhibiting various correlation properties. For benchmarking purposes, we contrast the
performance of a narrowband system encountering uncorrelated Rayleigh fading as well as that of
a K = 128-subcarrier OFDM system encountering a dispersive channel having uncorrelated time-
domain Rayleigh fading taps speciﬁed by the COST207 Bad Urban (BU) seven-tap CIR [347]. In the
frequency domain this CIR results in a corresponding correlated frequency-selective CTF. Furthermore,
we also consider the more realistic scenario of a K = 128-subcarrier OFDM system encountering
correlated time-domain Rayleigh fading having the Doppler frequencies of fD = 0.1, 0.03 and 0.003
as well as a dispersive CIR characterized by the COST207 BU model [347].
From Figure 17.4 we conclude that, as expected, while our turbo decoder exhibits a good BER
performance [266] in uncorrelated Rayleigh fading, the corresponding BER performance recorded
in correlated fading is substantially degraded owing to the relatively low-memory 1000-bit turbo
interleaver, which is unable to break up and randomize the long fading-induced error bursts.

Iterative Detection – Decoding
Figure 17.5 portrays a schematic of the iterative space–time detector and decoder considered. Following
the philosophy of iterative turbo detection, the incoming subcarrier-related signal vector y[n, k] is
processed by SISO OHRSA Log-MAP detector of Algorithm 16.3, which delivers the bit-related
a posteriori LLR values Ldet
apt. The resultant LLR values Ldet
apt are then normalized and deinterleaved
to generate the a priori bit-related LLR values Ldec
apr, which may be utilized by the turbo decoder of
Figure 17.5. Subsequently, the a posteriori LLR values Ldec
apt generated at the output of the decoder are
normalized, interleaved and fed back to the SDM detector in the form of the LLR values Ldet
apr. This
iterative detection process is continued for idet number of detection iterations.
As a next step, we characterize the achievable performance of the iterative SDM detection
and decoding scheme illustrated in Figure 17.5. Throughout this section we stipulate the idealistic
assumption of having perfect knowledge of the OFDM-subcarrier-related CTF.
Firstly, for the sake of benchmarking, in Figure 17.6 we quantify the BER versus Eb/N0
performance of the iterative SDM detection and decoding scheme of Figure 17.5 in the context of a rate

2 turbo-coded 4 × 4 SDM-QPSK-OFDM system communicating over the uncorrelated time-domain
Rayleigh fading channel characterized by the COST207 BU model [347]. We consider carrying out
idet = 1, 2, 3 and 4 iterations for the SDM detector, while performing idec = 8 iterations for the inner
turbo decoder per iteration of the SDM detector. From Figure 17.6 we can see that an Eb/N0 gain of

about 1 dB is achieved by invoking idet = 3 iterations of the SDM detector and decoder in comparison
with invoking a single detection iteration. By contrast, only a further minor improvement in Eb/N0
may be achieved by invoking idet > 3 number of iterations for the SDM detector and decoder complex
of Figure 17.5.
Let us now consider the effects of realistic time-domain correlations encountered by our SDM-
OFDM system employing the iterative SDM detection and decoding scheme of Figure 17.5. Figure 17.7
characterizes the achievable BER versus Eb/N0 performance of the iterative SDM detection and
decoding scheme, which assumes the iteration pattern of (idet, idec) = (3, 8), in the context of a
rate 1
2 turbo-coded 4 × 4 SDM-QPSK-OFDM system encountering the OFDM-normalized Doppler
frequencies of fD = 0.1, 0.03 and 0.003. The corresponding BER performance recorded in the
uncorrelated time-domain Rayleigh fading conditions when using the seven-path COST207 BU CIR,
is also shown for the sake of benchmarking. In contrast to the single-antenna scenario characterized in
Figure 17.4, we may observe from Figure 17.7 that the BER performance exhibited by the system
encountering a realistic OFDM-symbol-normalized Doppler frequency of fD = 0.003 lies within
an Eb/N0 range of 0.8 dB from the corresponding BER curve exhibited by the system encountering
idealistic uncorrelated time-domain Rayleigh fading conditions, when using the seven-path COST207
BU CIR. We may therefore conclude that, as expected, our 4×4-SDM-QPSK-OFDM system efﬁciently
exploits the spatial diversity potential inherent in the MIMO channel.
This conclusion is further supported by the results depicted in Figure 17.8, where we plot the
BER versus EB/N0 performance exhibited by the rate 1
2 turbo-coded SDM-QPSK-OFDM system
employing the iterative SDM detection and decoding scheme of Figure 17.5 and having mt = nr =
1, 2, 4 and 8 transmit and receive antennas. We assumed encountering an OFDM-symbol-normalized
Doppler frequency of fD = 0.003, while employing bit interleaving across Nd = 10 OFDM symbols.
Observe that having an interleaved block of bits spanning the duration of NdTs = 10Ts, which is
substantially shorter than channel’s coherence time of 1/fD ≈300Ts, corresponds to having virtually
no time-domain diversity gain. In other words, a relatively short interleaver is unable to break up and
randomize the long fading-induced error bursts. Consequently, we may conclude from Figure 17.8 that

the BER performance exhibited by the single-antenna OFDM system is limited by the probability of
occurrence of a precipitated burst of errors in some of the OFDM symbols, which we may refer to as
an outage [266] inherent in single-antenna Rayleigh fading channels. On the other hand, SDM-OFDM
systems operating in MIMO scenarios exhibit a BER performance which improves on increasing the
number mt = nr of transmit and receive antennas.
17.4
Iterative Channel Estimation – Detection and
Decoding
In this section we consider the transmission of a sequence of consecutive SDM-OFDM transmission
bursts, which are processed independently. In other words, each of the self-contained SDM-OFDM
transmission bursts includes all the necessary data, such as for instance pilot signals, required for
successful detection and decoding of the information accommodated by the OFDM transmission
burst. Correspondingly, each SDM-OFDM transmission burst may be processed independently of the
neighbouring bursts. This philosophy is reminiscent of the packet-based transmission scheme adopted,
for example, in the IEEE 802.11 a/g WLAN standard [641]. The structure of a single SDM-OFDM
transmission burst considered is depicted in Figure 17.9. More speciﬁcally, our OFDM transmission
burst portrayed in Figure 17.9 commences with a channel-sounding preamble formed by Np pure pilot
SDM-OFDM symbols. Subsequently, our SDM-OFDM transmission burst accommodates a sequence
of Lf so-called OFDM symbol frames. More explicitly, as seen in Figure 17.9, each OFDM symbol
frame constitutes a single bit-interleaved turbo-encoded codeword and comprises a single full-pilot
SDM-OFDM symbol followed by Nd information-carrying SDM-OFDM symbols.
For each SDM-OFDM transmission burst the detection process commences with initialization of the
channel estimator by utilizing the pilot SDM-OFDM symbols constituting the burst’s preamble, as seen

in Figure 17.9. Speciﬁcally, both the received signals y[n] and the corresponding transmitted signals
s[n] associated with the Np pilot SDM-OFDM symbols constituting the burst preamble of Figure 17.9
are sequentially fed into the channel estimator of Figure 7.1 to attain an initial convergence for the three
adaptive ﬁlters constituting the decision-directed channel estimator of Figure 7.1.
During the ﬁrst iteration of the detection process, which is carried out for each subsequent Nd
OFDM symbol data frame of Figure 17.9 that commences with a full-pilot SDM-OFDM symbol
associated with the SDM-OFDM symbol index n, we perform a long-term prediction of the CIR-
related taps using the CIR tap predictor of Figure 7.1. More speciﬁcally, we aim at predicting the CIR
associated with the last OFDM symbol of the current OFDM symbol frame of Figure 17.9, i.e. the one
associated with the SDM-OFDM symbol index of (n + Nd). The CIRs associated with the remaining
(Nd −1) SDM-OFDM symbols hosted by the current OFDM symbol frame are then obtained using
linear interpolation between those associated with the nth pilot SDM-OFDM symbol preceding the

symbol.
The predicted and interpolated MIMO-CTF coefﬁcients ˇH[m], m = n+1, . . . , n+Nd, are utilized
to perform initial detection of the information-carrying data SDM-OFDM symbols s[n]. Observe that
with the CIRs and the corresponding CTFs associated with the entire SDM-OFDM symbol frame, we
are able to employ the iterative SDM detection and decoding scheme outlined in Section 17.3.
The resultant tentative estimates of the data bits d, as well as the associated soft-bit information,
corresponding to the entire data SDM-OFDM-symbol frame of Figure 17.9, are remodulated in order
to generate the soft reference signal ˜s[m], m = n + 1, . . . , n + Nd, of Equation (7.98). The reference
signal ˜s[m] is fed back to the soft-input channel estimator of Algorithm 7.8 to reﬁne the estimates of
the CTF coefﬁcients H[m], m = n + 1, . . . , n + Nd. The interaction between the iterative channel
estimator of Algorithm 7.8 and the iterative SDM detection and decoding module of Section 17.3 is
illustrated in Figure 17.10. The iterative channel estimation–detection–decoding process portrayed in
Figure 17.10 is repeated, until a sufﬁciently reliable detected SDM-OFDM symbol ˆs is generated.
17.4.1
Mitigation of Error Propagation
As we noted in Section 7.2, the main difﬁculty associated with the decision-directed approach to
channel estimation is constituted by the potential error propagation, where the erroneous data decisions
result in erroneous channel estimation, which inﬂicts further precipitated data decision errors etc. In
other words, the reliability of the estimated CTF coefﬁcients degrades rapidly in the presence of
decision errors routinely occurring in the low-SNR region. The resultant degradation of the channel
state information accuracy results in further decision errors and ultimately in divergence of the iterative
channel estimation–data detection process and in a subsequent avalanche of decision errors. As we
pointed out in Section 7.8.1.4, the soft-feedback-assisted RLS CTF estimator of Algorithm 7.7 is
capable of substantially mitigating the effects of error propagation. Nevertheless, ensuring the stability
of an iterative channel estimation–data detection system in the presence of data decision errors remains
a challenging issue. Consequently, to mitigate the system’s vulnerability to error-propagation-related
instability effects we propose the following method.
Firstly, after each channel estimation and SDM detection iteration, which is performed on the
Nd SDM-OFDM symbol data frame of Figure 17.9, we record the resultant MSE. The joint channel
estimation and SDM detection MSE may be expressed as follows:
ei[n] =
n+Nd

m=n+1
K

k=1
∥y[m, k] −ˆHi[m, k]ˆsi[m, k]∥2,
(17.1)
where, as before, y[m, k] denotes the SDM signal associated with the kth subcarrier of the mth
SDM-OFDM symbol and recorded at the nr receive antennas, while ˆHi[m, k] and ˆsi[m, k] are the
corresponding estimates of the CTF coefﬁcient matrix and the transmitted signal vector, which were
obtained after the ith iteration of the channel estimation and detection process.
Subsequently, after carrying out ice channel estimation iterations, we select the particular pair of
CTF estimates ˆHi[m, k] and data estimates ˆsi[m, k] which correspond to the speciﬁc iteration resulting

17.4.2. MIMO-PASTD-DDCE Aided SDM-OFDM Performance Analysis
557
in the minimum MSE. More explicitly, the decision rule employed may be expressed as
{ ˆH[m, k],ˆs[m, k]} = arg min
i
ei[n],
(17.2)
where we have m = n + 1, . . . , n + Nd; k = 1, . . . , K and i = 1, . . . , ice.
Let us now consider the scenario of encountering a large number of decision errors. Naturally,
the decision errors in any of the iterations would result in a degraded channel estimation accuracy in
the subsequent iteration and hence even more decision errors as well as an inevitable increase of the
corresponding MSE ei[n]. Consequently, invoking the ﬁnal-decision rule of Equation 17.2 substantially
mitigates the system’s avalanche-like error propagation and hence improves the system’s stability and
robustness.

MIMO-PASTD-DDCE Aided SDM-OFDM Performance
Analysis
17.4.2.1
Number of Channel Estimation–Detection Iterations
Firstly, we characterize the BER performance gain attained by the iterative MIMO-PASTD-DDCE in
comparison with single-iteration channel estimation. More speciﬁcally, Figure 17.11 portrays the BER
versus Eb/N0 performance of the rate 1/2 turbo-coded 4×4 SDM-QPSK-OFDM system employing the
MIMO-PASTD-DDCE of Algorithm 7.8 and invoking ice = 1, 2, 3 and 4 channel estimation iterations
as well as idet = 2 SDM detector iterations and idec = 4 iterations of the parallel-concatenated turbo
decoder per iteration of the channel estimator. We assumed employing the transmission burst structure
depicted in Figure 17.9, where the corresponding parameters were given by (Lf, Np, Nd) = (8, 8, 10),
which yields an overall pilot overhead of ε = (Np + Lf)/(LfNd) = 0.1, or, in other words, 10%. The
seven-path COST207 BU channel model was used and we assumed encountering the Doppler frequency
of fD = 0.003. As may be concluded from Figure 17.11, the SDM-OFDM system employing the
iterative channel estimation scheme of Algorithm 7.8 exhibits an Eb/N0 gain of about 2 dB when
comparing three iterations and a single iteration of the channel estimator. Moreover, only a modest
further Eb/N0 gain may be achieved upon invoking a higher number of channel estimation iterations.
17.4.2.2
Pilot Overhead
In order to provide further insights, Figure 17.12 characterizes the achievable BER versus Eb/N0
performance of the MIMO-PASTD-DDCE of Algorithm 7.8 in the context of employing different
numbers mt and nr of transmit and receive antennas. Speciﬁcally, we consider the SDM-QPSK-
OFDM turbo receiver of Figure 17.10, which invokes (ice, idet, idec) = (3, 2, 4) channel estimation,
detection and decoding iterations, respectively, while employing mt = nr = 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 transmit
and receive antennas. Observe that the BER performance improves rapidly on increasing the number
mt = nr of transmit and receive antennas, as long as it does not exceed mt = nr = 4. Furthermore,
the BER performance degrades slowly on further increasing the number of antennas according to
mt = nr > 4. A simple explanation of this phenomenon is that, as expected, the SDM-OFDM
system beneﬁts from the increased spatial diversity associated with a higher number of antennas. On the
other hand, as noted in Section 7.8, the channel estimation problem becomes increasingly more rank
deﬁcient and hence the estimation accuracy of the CIR taps as well as the corresponding subcarrier-
related CTF coefﬁcients degrades on increasing the number of independent spatial links constituting
the MIMO channel. The overall system performance is determined by the associated trade-off between
the beneﬁcial diversity gain increase and the inevitable degradation of the estimated CTF accuracy.
Ultimately, however, deterioration of the estimated CTF accuracy does not appear to constitute a major
impediment. Quantitatively, as evidenced by the results of Figure 17.12, the BER performance exhibited
by the high-complexity system having mt = nr = 8 antennas lies within a 1 dB margin in comparison
with the corresponding BER performance curve associated with the system having mt = nr = 4
transmit and receive antennas. Observe that the 4 × 4 system exhibits the best recorded performance

and hence appears to represent an optimum trade-off between the beneﬁcial spatial diversity gain and
the degradation in accuracy of the system-size-related channel estimation.
17.4.2.3
Performance of a Symmetric MIMO System
Subsequently, we characterize the achievable BER performance exhibited by the SDM-QPSK-OFDM
turbo receiver of Figure 17.10 employing the MIMO-PASTD-DDCE scheme of Algorithm 7.8 and
using various densities of the dedicated pilot SDM-OFDM symbols. More speciﬁcally, in Figure 17.13
we have plotted the rate 1/2 turbo-coded QPSK-related BER exhibited by our SDM-OFDM system
employing mt = nr transmit and receive antennas. For benchmarking purposes we have included the
BER versus Eb/N0 performance of the SDM-OFDM system assuming perfect CIR knowledge, as well
as assuming channel estimation based on the idealistic scenario of having 100% pilots. Furthermore,
we present our results for the SDM-OFDM system using pilot overheads of 30, 10 and 3%, which
correspond to the pilot overhead ratios of ε = 0.3, 0.1 and 0.003, respectively. We observe from
Figure 17.13 that the 100% pilot-based channel estimation results in an approximately 1 dB Eb/N0
degradation in comparison with the perfect CIR estimation scenario. Furthermore, the more realistic
assumption of employing up to 10% dedicated SDM-OFDM pilot symbols results in a further Eb/N0
degradation of about 1.5 dB in comparison with the 100% pilot-based scenario. Additionally, a further
reduction of the pilot overhead to as low as 3% of pilots results in an Eb/N0 degradation of 2.5 dB in
comparison with the 100% pilot-based scenario.

Performance of a Rank-Deﬁcient MIMO System
Similar phenomena may be observed in Figure 17.14, which characterizes the achievable BER
performance exhibited by a rank-deﬁcient 4 × 2 SDM-QPSK-OFDM system. The 4 × 2 MIMO

scenario constitutes a particularly interesting detection problem. More speciﬁcally, let us consider the
kth subcarrier of the nth SDM-OFDM symbol. The computational challenge lies in the fact that we
have to estimate as many as four transmitted M-QAM symbols sj[n, k], j = 1, . . . , 4, as well as the
corresponding eight CTF coefﬁcients Hij [n, k], i = 1, 2; j = 1, . . . , 4, while utilizing merely the two
recorded signal samples of yi[n, k], i = 1, 2. Consequently, similar to Figure 17.13, we have plotted the
BER versus Eb/N0 performance of the 4×2 SDM-QPSK-OFDM system assuming perfect CSI as well
as assuming channel estimation based on the idealistic scenario of having 100% pilots. Furthermore, we
have plotted the BER corresponding to scenarios using pilot overheads of 30, 10 and 3%. Similar to the
4×4 scenario, assuming 100% pilot-based channel estimation results in an approximately 1 dB Eb/N0
degradation in comparison with the perfect CIR knowledge scenario. On the other hand, in contrast to
the 4 × 4 scenario characterized in Figure 17.13, in Figure 17.14 we can see that the system employing
10% of dedicated SDM-OFDM pilot symbols results in nearly 6 dB Eb/N0 degradation in comparison
with the 100% pilot-based scenario. Furthermore, an additional reduction of the pilot overhead to 3%
of pilots results in system instability and hence no satisfactory BER performance may be achieved,
regardless of the SNR encountered.

Chapter Summary
In conclusion, in this chapter we documented the performance trends exhibited by the proposed turbo
SDM-OFDM receiver of Figure 17.1, which comprises three main components, namely the soft-
feedback decision-directed MIMO channel estimator derived in Section 7.8, the SISO OHRSA Log-
MAP SDM detector of Section 16.1.3 and a SISO parallel-concatenated turbo code [345]. We analysed
the achievable performance of each individual constituent component of our turbo receiver, as well as
the achievable performance of the entire iterative system.

17.5. Chapter Summary
561
We found that our turbo SDM-OFDM system employing the MIMO-DDCE scheme of Section 7.8
as well as the OHRSA Log-MAP SDM detector of Section 16.1.3 remains effective in channel
conditions associated with high terminal speeds up to 130 km/h, which corresponds to the OFDM-
symbol-normalized Doppler frequency of 0.006. Additionally, in Figure 17.12 we reported a virtually
error-free performance for a rate 1/2 turbo-coded 8 × 8 QPSK-OFDM system, exhibiting an effective
throughput of 8 MHz · 8 bps/Hz = 64 Mbps and having a pilot overhead of only 10% at an SNR of
7.5 dB and a normalized Doppler frequency of 0.003, which corresponds to a mobile terminal speed of
about 65 km/h.1

Summary of Results
In this monograph we characterized a suite of iterative turbo receivers suitable for employment in a wide
range of multi-antenna-aided multi-carrier systems operating in realistic, rapidly ﬂuctuating channel
conditions. More speciﬁcally, we reported the following major ﬁndings.
18.1.1
OFDM History, Standards and System Components
Chapter 2 provided a broad state-of-the-art review with reference to the open literature and detailed the
general background of our studies throughout this book. The key milestones, events and contributions
to the development of OFDM systems spanning several decades were summarized in Tables 1.1 and 1.2.
Furthermore, in Section 1.1.1.1 an overview of the MIMO techniques was provided, followed by the
introduction to MIMO-OFDM systems in Section 1.1.1.2, where the associated contributions found in
the literature were outlined in Tables 1.3–1.5. Moreover, our review of the SDMA and SDMA-OFDM
literature outlined in Section 1.1.1.3 was summarized in Tables 1.6 and 1.7. Chapter 1 outlined the
basic functional blocks of MIMO-OFDM systems.
18.1.2
Channel-Coded STBC-OFDM Systems
Our research in Chapter 3 was conducted in the context of both single-user, single-carrier and single-
user OFDM systems, which constitutes the introductory and background work for the following
chapters. Speciﬁcally, in Section 3.2, a general outline of Alamouti’s simple scheme [400] using two
transmitters in conjunction with a number of receivers for communications in non-dispersive Rayleigh
fading channels was provided, followed by a brief review of various Space–Time Block Codes (STBCs)
proposed by Tarokh et al. [413, 414], namely the G2, G3, G4, H3 and H4 codes, as well as their
achievable performances over uncorrelated and correlated Rayleigh fading channels. The performances
of all the space–time block codes considered are summarized in Table 3.2.
Following the above foundational work, in Section 3.3.1 the STBCs were combined with various
Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes in order to improve the system’s performance. It was found
that, provided the same modulation scheme was used, a lower-rate LDPC code beneﬁted the system
more than a space–time code of a higher-diversity order did for transmission over the uncorrelated
MIMO-OFDM for LTE, Wi-Fi and WiMAX

Rayleigh fading channels. On the other hand, when the same LDPC code was used, a lower-order
modulation scheme tended to offer a higher performance improvement than an STBC of a higher
diversity order did. The performance of different LDPC-aided STBC schemes was summarized in
Table 3.5, where the half-rate LDPC-coded STBC G2 was found to be the best option among all
the LDPC-STBC-concatenated schemes investigated. Furthermore, in Section 3.3.2, we compared the
performance of an LDPC-aided G2-coded scheme with a half-rate Turbo Convolutional (TC) code,
i.e. to that of a TC(2,1,4)-aided G2-coded arrangement, which was found to be the best scheme in a
range of TC-STBC-concatenated systems [314] designed for transmission over uncorrelated Rayleigh
fading channels. From our coding gain versus complexity performance comparisons, it was concluded
that the half-rate TC(2,1,4)-assisted STBC G2 slightly outperforms the LDPC-assisted STBC schemes.
However, the LDPC-STBC-concatenated schemes may be considered as better design options for
complexity-sensitive systems, where the achievable performance does not necessarily have to be the
highest possible, since the LDPC-aided schemes are capable of maintaining a lower complexity than
the TC(2,1,4)-aided scheme is. In conclusion, the performance of the different schemes studied was
summarized in Table 3.8.
Moreover, channel coding assisted STBC single-user OFDM systems were studied in Section 3.4.
More speciﬁcally, in Section 3.4.1 Trellis-Coded Modulation (TCM), Turbo Trellis-Coded Modulation
(TTCM), Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation (BICM) and iterative decoded BICM (BICM-ID) of
the Coded Modulation (CM) family were amalgamated with an STBC G2-aided OFDM system for
communicating over wideband channels. Our corresponding simulation results were summarized in
Table 3.11, which was followed by Section 3.4.2, where the performance of the TTCM and LDPC-
assisted G2-coded single-user OFDM systems was documented. It was found that the coding gain
performance of the TTCM-aided G2 schemes surpasses that of the LDPC-aided G2 schemes when the
affordable complexity is higher than approximate 500, as observed in Figure 3.38. At a low complexity,
i.e. below a value of about 500, however, the LDPC-aided schemes tend to achieve a higher coding gain
than the TTCM-aided schemes. The associated results were summarized in Table 3.13.
18.1.3
Coded-Modulation-Assisted Multi-user SDMA-OFDM Using
Frequency-Domain Spreading
In Chapter 4, our attention was focused on Space-Division Multiple Access (SDMA) based up-
link multi-user OFDM systems, where the various CM-assisted SDMA-OFDM schemes using the
frequency-domain subcarrier-based Walsh–Hadamard Transform Spreading (WHTS) were investigated.
In this chapter, the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) based Multi-User Detection (MUD)
technique was considered. From the simulation results provided in Section 4.3, it was found that
WHTS was capable of improving the system’s performance, especially in uncoded scenarios, since
the bursty subcarrier errors can be pseudo-randomly spread across the subcarriers of the entire WHT
block. Furthermore, when we had two receiver antenna elements, the TTCM-aided WHTS-MMSE-
SDMA-OFDM system achieved the best CodeWord Error Ratio (CWER) performance among all the
CM- and WHTS-assisted schemes considered for transmission over the three-path SWATM channel
of Figure 3.32. Comparing Figure 4.8 with Figure 4.10, we found that at the same user load level,
e.g. at α4 = α2 = 0.5 or α4 = α2 = 1.0, the Eb/N0 performance achieved by the four-receiver
system was better than that of the two-receiver system, provided that the same CM-assisted scheme was
used, since employing a higher number of SDMA receiver antennas offers a higher spatial diversity.
Additionally, the performance of the various CM- and WHTS-assisted MMSE-SDMA-OFDM systems
was evaluated in the context of the more dispersive 12-path COST207 HT channel of Figure 4.12 in
Section 4.3.2.2, including the two- and four-receiver scenarios in Section 4.3.2.2.1 and Section 4.3.2.2.2,
respectively. It was found that with the aid of WHTS, the TTCM-assisted scheme constituted the best
design option in terms of both the Bit Error Ratio (BER) and CWER in comparison with the other three
CM-aided schemes. Furthermore, the spreading-induced Eb/N0 gain achieved by all the schemes over
the COST207 HT channel was higher than that achieved over the SWATM channel. This may suggest

18.1.4. Hybrid Multi-user Detection for SDMA-OFDM Systems
565
that in highly dispersive environments the channel-coded SDMA-OFDM system’s performance may be
further improved by employing WHTS.
In Table 4.4 we summarized the Eb/N0 values required by the various CM- and WHTS-assisted
MMSE-SDMA-OFDM schemes for achieving a BER of 10−5, also showing the corresponding gains
attained by the WHTS-assisted schemes. We observed that, on one hand, when we had a speciﬁc user
load, the spreading-induced Eb/N0 gain achieved by a system having a lower diversity order was
higher, regardless of the employment of CM. In other words, the subcarrier-based WHTS technique
may be expected to attain a higher system performance improvement in relatively lower diversity-order
scenarios. Moreover, if we supported a ﬁxed number of users but varied the number of receiver antenna
elements, similar conclusions might be drawn. A plausible explanation for this fact may be that in the
SDMA-MIMO system, a potentially higher space diversity gain may be achieved, when a higher number
of receiver antenna elements are employed, and thus the beneﬁts of WHTS may be less substantial. This
may be particularly true in the context of the CM-aided systems, since most of the attainable gain has
already been achieved by using the channel codes. On the other hand, when a given number of receiver
antenna elements was used, the spreading-induced Eb/N0 gains achieved in the context of the fully
loaded systems were higher than in the half-loaded systems, regardless of the employment of channel
codes. This suggests that more beneﬁts may arise from WHTS, especially in the fully loaded scenarios,
where the MUD suffers from a relatively low efﬁciency in differentiating the different users’ signals.
Additionally, we provided the Eb/N0 crossing points and the corresponding total gain achieved by
the various CM-WHTS-MMSE-SDMA-OFDM schemes at the BER of 10−5, in Figures 4.19 and 4.20,
respectively. It was demonstrated that the performance gap between the different CM-aided schemes
increased as the user load increased. It was also found that when the user load was higher, i.e. when
the Multi-User Interference (MUI) was increased, the performance degradation of the TTCM-aided
schemes was lower than those of the TCM-, BICM- and BICM-ID-aided arrangements. By contrast,
at a relatively low user load the various schemes provided a similar performance, because most of the
attainable gain of the four-receiver SDMA-OFDM system had already been achieved.
The effects of using different WHT block sizes were studied in Section 4.3.2.3, in both the SWATM
and COST207 HT channel scenarios, as seen in Figures 4.21 and 4.22, respectively. As expected, it was
found that the system’s performance was improved, while the WHT block size used was increased.
In Section 4.3.2.4 the effects of the Doppler frequency were demonstrated. It was concluded that
the maximum Doppler frequency does not signiﬁcantly affect the performance of the WHTS-assisted
MMSE-SDMA-OFDM system, regardless of the employment of CM, as for example portrayed in
Figure 4.23.
From the investigations conducted in Chapter 4, it was concluded that the various CM schemes,
namely TCM, TTCM, BICM and BICM-ID, are capable of substantially improving the achievable
performance of SDMA-OFDM systems. The employment of WHTS has the potential of further
enhancing the system’s performance in highly dispersive propagation environments. As a result,
the TTCM- and WHTS-assisted schemes were found to have the best CWER performance in all
the scenarios investigated. Furthermore, this was also the best design option in terms of the achievable
Eb/N0 gain expressed in dB, when communicating in highly dispersive environments, e.g. over the
COST207 HT channel of Figure 4.12, while carrying a high user load of αP ≥0.5.
18.1.4
Hybrid Multi-user Detection for SDMA-OFDM Systems
Since the performance of the linear MMSE MUD employed in Chapter 4 is limited, our work was
carried forward in Chapter 5 towards the design of more sophisticated MUDs for the multi-user
SDMA-OFDM systems. More speciﬁcally, we proposed an MMSE-aided Genetic Algorithm (GA)
based MUD for employment in a TTCM-assisted SDMA-OFDM scheme.
In Section 5.2.1 we provided a system overview of the proposed GA-assisted TTCM-MMSE-
SDMA-OFDM system. The antenna-speciﬁc optimization metric of Equation (5.3) designed for the
proposed GA MUD was derived in Section 5.2.2.1 from that of the optimum Maximum Likelihood

566
Chapter 18. Summary, Conclusions and Future Research
(ML) MUD. Moreover, in order to solve the decision conﬂict resulting from the P antenna-speciﬁc
metrics, a joint metric of Equation (5.6) was employed in the GA MUD. Section 5.2.2.2 outlined
the operation process of the concatenated MMSE-GA MUD, while its performance was evaluated in
Section 5.2.3, where the GA-based schemes were shown to be capable of achieving a near-optimum
performance. Additionally, a complexity comparison between the proposed GA MUD and the optimum
ML MUD was provided in Section 5.2.4, where we showed that the complexity of the GA MUD was
signiﬁcantly lower than that of the ML MUD.
In order to enhance further the achievable performance of the TTCM-assisted MMSE-GA-SDMA-
OFDM system, an improved GA MUD was proposed in Section 5.3. This was discussed in two steps.
Firstly, we proposed the novel Biased Q-function-Based Mutation (BQM) scheme in Section 5.3.1. This
consisted of a review of the conventional Uniform Mutation (UM) scheme in Section 5.3.1.1 and the
detailed explanation of the BQM mechanism in Section 5.3.1.2. The proposed BQM-aided GA MUD
exploits an effective mutation strategy, which signiﬁcantly improves the mutation efﬁciency so that
the GA’s search space can be substantially compressed. Hence, the BQM-aided GA MUD is capable
of achieving a better performance in comparison with its UM-aided counterpart, especially at high
SNRs or high user loads, as evidenced by the simulation results given in Section 5.3.1.3. Furthermore,
in Section 5.3.1.2.2 we pointed out that the BQM scheme can be readily simpliﬁed to the Closest-
Neighbour Uniform Mutation (CNUM) scheme, which only considers a subset of all the theoretically
possible mutation target symbols during the mutation process. The CNUM-related transition probability
values associated with different modems were summarized in Table 5.4. As a result, the BQM-
induced search space can be further reduced by the CNUM scheme without signiﬁcantly degrading
the achievable performance.
Secondly, an Iterative GA (IGA) aided MUD was introduced in Section 5.3.2. The theoretical
foundations of the IGA MUD were presented in Section 5.3.2.1, where we characterized the IGA
framework as well as its optimization potential. Speciﬁcally, the IGA MUD is capable of exploiting the
beneﬁts accruing both from improved TTCM-decoded initial symbol estimates and from the embedded
two-dimensional joint optimization invoked in the codeword domain as well as the in the frequency
domain, as illustrated in Figure 5.15. From the numerical results provided in Section 5.3.2.2, the
combined BQM-IGA-aided system was found to give the best performance in all scenarios considered,
while maintaining a modest computational complexity. More speciﬁcally, the underloaded and fully
loaded scenarios were ﬁrst investigated in Section 5.3.2.2.1, where the number of users was assumed
to be less than or equal to the number of receiver antenna elements. In low-throughput fully loaded
scenarios, e.g. in a six-user system employing a 4-QAM modem, a two-iteration BQM-IGA MUD
associated with X = 20 and Y = 5 was capable of achieving the same performance as the optimum
ML-aided system at a complexity of 200, which is only about 50% and 5% of the MUD-related
complexity imposed by the conventional UM-aided single-iteration IGA MUD and by the optimum
ML MUD, respectively. On the other hand, in high-throughput six-user systems where for example
a 16-QAM modem was employed, the UM-aided GA or IGA MUDs suffered from a high residual
error ﬂoor even when exploiting the iterative framework. By contrast, a two-iteration BQM-IGA MUD
associated with X = 40 and Y = 5 achieved an Eb/N0 gain of about 7 dB over the MMSE MUD
benchmark at the BER of 10−5.
Moreover, in Section 5.3.2.2.2 we demonstrated that the proposed BQM-IGA MUD is capable of
providing a near-optimum performance even in the so-called overloaded scenarios, where the number of
accommodated users is higher than the number of receiver antenna elements, while many conventional
detection techniques suffer from an excessively high error ﬂoor. For instance, when we had L = 8 users
and P = 6 receivers in Figure 5.20, the two-iteration-based BQM-IGA MUD reduced the BER recorded
at an Eb/N0 value of 3 dB by four orders of magnitude in comparison with the classic MMSE-MUD-
aided benchmark system. This high robustness of the BQM-IGA MUD was achieved since the high MUI
experienced in overloaded scenarios was effectively suppressed. Moreover, the associated Eb/N0 gain
was attained at a modest complexity of 400 objective function evaluations, which is only 0.002 38%
of the excessive complexity imposed by the ML MUD that is prohibited from simulations in this case.

18.1.5. DSS and SSCH-Aided Multi-user SDMA-OFDM Systems
567
As a further investigation, we demonstrated in Section 5.3.2.2.3 that the proposed system was capable
of achieving a satisfactory performance even in conjunction with imperfect channel information.
In Section 5.3.3, a complexity analysis of the proposed BQM-IGA scheme was carried out, where
we concluded that the complexity of the proposed detection scheme is only moderately higher than
that imposed by the linear MMSE MUD, and is substantially lower than that imposed by the optimum
ML MUD, as shown in Figures 5.25 and 5.26. We also showed that in both the fully loaded scenario
of Section 5.3.1.3.2 and the overloaded scenario of Section 5.3.2.2.2.2, the complexity of the BQM
approach can be further reduced by employing its simpliﬁed version, namely the CNUM scheme, at the
cost of a slightly degraded system performance. Additionally, in Table 5.6 we further demonstrated the
attractive performance versus complexity balance of the BQM-IGA scheme, which reduced the BER
by up to ﬁve orders of magnitude in comparison with the MMSE MUD at the cost of only a moderate
complexity.
Note that the system parameters of the IGA framework, such as the number of TTCM iterations,
the number of IGA MUD iterations and the GA-related parameter settings, are all readily conﬁgurable,
enabling us to strike an attractive trade-off between the achievable performance and the complexity
imposed. For speciﬁc scenarios, the TTCM scheme used in the system can also be conveniently
substituted by other FEC schemes, e.g. the TC codes. Therefore, the facility provided by the proposed
IGA MUD may make it possible for applications in multi-mode terminals, where good performance,
low complexity and easy ﬂexibility are all important criteria. It is also worth pointing out that the
proposed BQM-aided IGA MUD can be readily incorporated into the multi-user CDMA systems, e.g.
those of [38]. In this case, the initial detected signal supplied to the GA MUD for creating the ﬁrst GA
population is provided by the bank of matched ﬁlters installed at the CDMA BS, rather than by the
MMSE MUD. However, the BQM scheme may remain unchanged.
18.1.5
DSS and SSCH-Aided Multi-user SDMA-OFDM Systems
As we saw in Chapter 5, in the so-called overloaded scenarios, the classic MMSE MUD results
in an excessive residual BER, since the degree of freedom becomes insufﬁciently high. However,
the GA-based MUDs are capable of supporting a higher number of users than the MMSE MUD.
Furthermore, with the aid of a new Slow Frequency-Hopping (SFH) type of technique, more users can
be accommodated by the SDMA-OFDM system. This constituted our main objective in Chapter 6,
where we proposed a TTCM-assisted SDMA-OFDM system employing the MMSE-IGA MUD of
Chapter 5 with the aid of both Direct-Sequence Spreading (DSS) and the so-called Slow SubCarrier-
Hopping (SSCH) techniques.
Firstly, the conventional SDMA-OFDM systems were brieﬂy reviewed in Section 6.1, where
their two disadvantages were identiﬁed. On the one hand, conventional SDMA-OFDM is incapable
of efﬁciently exploiting frequency diversity, because all the users simultaneously share the entire
bandwidth for their own communications. On the other hand, in conventional SDMA-OFDM systems,
supporting a high number of bandwidth-sharing users will result in a high MUI across the entire
bandwidth, inevitably degrading all users’ performance. Against this background, in Section 6.2 we
introduced the concept of hybrid SFH/SDMA-OFDM as well as the proposed SSCH/SDMA-OFDM
schemes and discussed their potential beneﬁts, aiming at ﬁnding an effective solution to the above-
mentioned problems. In Section 6.3 a comparison of conventional SDMA-OFDM, SFH/SDMA-OFDM
and SSCH/SDMA-OFDM systems in terms of their frequency resource allocation strategies was given,
where the SSCH scheme was considered to have more advantages than the others, such as for example
its higher efﬁciency in exploiting frequency diversity.
Our design of the proposed hybrid DSS/SSCH SDMA-OFDM system was detailed in Section 6.4.
More speciﬁcally, ﬁrst an overview of the proposed hybrid system was provided in Section 6.4.1,
followed by the design of the transmitter and receiver presented in Sections 6.4.1.1 and 6.4.1.2,
respectively. Figures 6.3 and 6.4 provided an example of the architecture of the DSS/SSCH transmitter
and receiver, respectively. In Section 6.4.2, we analysed two SSCH pattern assignment strategies,

568
Chapter 18. Summary, Conclusions and Future Research
namely the Random SSCH (RSSCH) scheme of Section 6.4.2.1 and the Uniform SSCH (USSCH)
scheme of Section 6.4.2.2, where the USSCH strategy was considered to be better. On the one hand,
in order to mitigate the MUI, the USSCH strategy disperses rather than concentrates each user’s
high-MUI subcarriers across the FD. On the other hand, to combat FD fading, the USSCH scheme
uniformly distributed the subcarriers activated by the same user across the entire bandwidth, rather
than consecutively mapping them to a small fraction of the entire bandwidth, and thus making it
possible to exploit frequency diversity efﬁciently. As a result of employing the USSCH technique
of Section 6.4.2.2.1, the number of users activating each subcarrier becomes similar, which in
turn minimizes the average MUI across the whole system bandwidth. Moreover, we pointed out in
Section 6.4.2.4 that the USSCH patterns can be generated by ofﬂine pre-computation, since their choice
is not based on any channel knowledge. This requires a substantially lower computational complexity
than that imposed by other adaptive algorithms exploiting real-time channel knowledge. The acquired
patterns can also be reused according to predeﬁned reuse time intervals, which should be sufﬁciently
long for ensuring efﬁcient exploitation of frequency diversity. Additionally, to provide insight into the
hybrid DSS/SSCH SDMA-OFDM system, in Section 6.4.3 the DSS despreading and SSCH demapping
operations invoked at the SDMA receiver were presented, followed by a discussion of the MUD process
in the context of the hybrid system in Section 6.4.4.
Section 6.5 compared the simulation results generated by the proposed DSS/SSCH SDMA-OFDM
system with those of various other SDMA-OFDM systems. In Section 6.5.1, the performances of
the DSS- and/or SSCH-aided SDMA-OFDM systems were compared, when employing either the
classic MMSE MUD discussed in Chapter 4 or the MMSE-IGA MUD proposed in Chapter 5. More
speciﬁcally, it was shown in Figure 6.8 that in the moderately overloaded scenario associated with a
total system throughput of BT = 5120 bits per OFDM symbol, most of the MUI encountered can be
effectively suppressed by the MMSE-IGA MUD, while the overloaded MMSE MUD results in a high
error ﬂoor. This result achieved in the context of the DSS/SSCH SDMA-OFDM system was consistent
with our ﬁndings in Chapter 5, where the performance advantages of the MMSE-IGA MUD have been
recognized.
In Section 6.5.2, we further compared the performances of various hybrid SDMA-OFDM as well
as conventional SDMA-OFDM systems. More speciﬁcally, a moderately overloaded scenario was ﬁrst
considered in Section 6.5.2.1. It was observed that the Random SFH (RSFH), the Uniform SFH (USFH)
and the RSSCH schemes suffered from the employment of random hopping patterns that resulted in an
increased average BER due to the high MUI encountered at the subcarriers or subbands activated by
an excessive number of users. By contrast, the schemes exploiting the uniform patterns generated by
the algorithm of Section 6.4.2.2 were capable of providing an improved performance, as shown in
Figure 6.9.
Furthermore, we pointed out that the proposed uniform pattern assignment algorithm is capable
of providing more beneﬁts in the scenarios associated with a higher throughput. This argument was
validated in Section 6.5.2.2, where a highly overloaded scenario corresponding to a total system
throughput of BT = 6144 bits per OFDM symbol was considered. It was shown in Figure 6.10 that
the USFH, the USSCH and the hybrid DSS/USSCH systems were capable of achieving a signiﬁcantly
better performance in comparison with the conventional SDMA-OFDM, the DSS/SDMA-OFDM as
well as the RSFH/RSSCH-aided SDMA-OFDM systems, while the USSCH/SDMA-OFDM system
was found to be the best option. The superior performance of the USSCH scheme was attributed to its
speciﬁc characteristics, which successfully suppressed the MUI and thus eliminated the associated error
ﬂoor. For example, we observed in Figure 6.10 that at an Eb/N0 value of 10 dB, the USSCH/SDMA-
OFDM system reduced the BER by about two, three and four orders of magnitude in comparison with
the conventional SDMA-OFDM, the RSSCH/SDMA-OFDM and the RSFH/SDMA-OFDM systems,
respectively. We also concluded that the frequency diversity beneﬁts achieved by USSCH may be
more signiﬁcant than those of the time diversity attained by DSS, since the hybrid DSS/USSCH
SDMA-OFDM system attained a performance between those of the USSCH/SDMA-OFDM and the
DSS/SDMA-OFDM systems, while the DSS/SDMA-OFDM scheme achieved a similar performance to

18.1.6. Channel Estimation for OFDM and MC-CDMA
569
that of the conventional SDMA-OFDM system. This suggests that the ﬁxed-bandwidth hybrid system
should avoid using long DSS codes that result in a wider subcarrier bandwidth, so that a sufﬁciently
high number of Q > K subcarriers becomes available for maintaining a sufﬁciently high frequency
diversity.
The proposed USSCH scheme’s high robustness against MUI was further conﬁrmed by Figures 6.11
and 6.12, where the USSCH/SDMA-OFDM system exhibited the best BER versus total system through-
put performance as well as the best maximum total system throughput versus Eb/N0 performance
among the various SDMA-OFDM arrangements, respectively. For instance, as shown in Figure 6.12,
at the Eb/N0 value of 12 dB, a capacity increase of about 4%, 13% and 44% was achieved by the
USSCH scheme compared with the USFH, the RSSCH and the RSFH arrangements at the target BER
of 10−3, and 4%, 14% and 78% at the BER of 10−5, respectively. In Section 6.5.4, we demonstrated
that the proposed hybrid system is capable of achieving an acceptable performance even without
accurate channel knowledge. Finally, we pointed out that the superior performance of the USSCH-
aided SDMA-OFDM system is achieved at a similar complexity to that of the conventional SDMA-
OFDM arrangement, since the additional computational complexity imposed by the USSCH algorithm
manifests itself in terms of ofﬂine pre-computation.
The capability of effectively exploiting frequency diversity and suppressing high MUI renders
the channel-coded USSCH technique an attractive design option, lending a beneﬁcial ﬂexibility to
practical applications. Furthermore, the USSCH/SDMA-OFDM scheme can be readily extended to a
variable-rate system offering a high grade of ﬂexibility required by future wireless multimedia services,
supporting variable bit rates and different QoS requirements. Each user may activate a different number
of subcarriers, depending on the type of service to be delivered or the bit rate to be supported. In such
scenarios, the USSCH algorithm of Section 6.4.2.2 can be modiﬁed by taking into account the different
rates. Moreover, in SSCH-based systems the different subcarriers do not have to be contiguously
allocated, which is a further attractive property, especially in those scenarios where several systems
operated by different service providers have to coexist and/or fractional bandwidths have to be exploited.
In addition, the different types of hybrid SFH/SSCH-assisted SDMA-OFDM systems can be readily
implemented by exploiting different numbers of subbands having different bandwidths, depending on
the speciﬁc system requirements.
18.1.6
Channel Estimation for OFDM and MC-CDMA
The DDCE scheme proposed in Chapter 7 is suitable for employment in both OFDM and MC-CDMA
systems. We analysed the achievable performance of the estimation scheme considered in conjunction
with a realistic dispersive Rayleigh fading channel model having a realistic Fractionally Spaced (FS)
rather than an idealized Symbol-Spaced (SS) Power Delay Proﬁle (PDP).
Speciﬁcally, in Section 7.4.1 we proposed the MMSE FD-CTF estimator, which is suitable for
employment in both OFDM and MC-CDMA systems. In Section 7.4 we continued our discourse with
the derivation of both sample-spaced as well as fractionally spaced CIR estimators. In Section 7.4.5 we
performed a comparison between the two methods considered and demonstrated the advantages of the
fractionally spaced scheme. Subsequently, in Section 7.5 we developed a parametric fractionally spaced
CIR tap tracking technique, which facilitates low-complexity channel estimation in realistic channel
conditions characterized by time-variant fractionally spaced power delay proﬁles. More speciﬁcally,
we employ the deﬂation PAST method of Algorithm 7.2 for recursive tracking of the CTF’s covariance
matrix and for subsequent tracking of the corresponding CIR taps. We demonstrated that the PAST-aided
DDCE scheme proposed exhibits a good performance over the entire range of practical propagation
conditions.
In Section 7.6 we discussed two major CIR tap prediction strategies, namely the robust predictor,
which was capable of guaranteeing a certain level of performance under speciﬁed worst-case PDP
conditions, and the adaptive RLS predictor. In Figures 7.19 and 7.20 of Section 7.6.5 we characterized
and compared the achievable performance of both methods considered and drew conclusions concerning

570
Chapter 18. Summary, Conclusions and Future Research
their relative merits. Speciﬁcally, we demonstrated that the RLS prediction technique outperforms its
robust counterpart over the entire range of the relevant channel conditions.
Subsequently, in Section 7.8 we addressed the problem of channel estimation in multi-antenna,
multi-carrier systems. Speciﬁcally, we proposed a DDCE scheme which is suitable for employment
in a wide range of multi-antenna, multi-carrier systems capable of operating over the entire range of
practical channel conditions. In particular, we considered a generic MIMO-OFDM system employing
K orthogonal frequency-domain subcarriers as well as having mt and nr transmit and receive antennas,
respectively. The MIMO channel estimation scheme derived in Section 7.8 comprises an array of K
per-subcarrier MIMO-CTF estimators, followed by a (nr × mt)-dimensional array of parametric CIR
estimators and a corresponding array of (nr × mt × L) CIR tap predictors, where L is the number of
CIR taps tracked per link of the MIMO channel.
In Section 7.8.1 we explored a family of recursive MIMO-CTF tracking methods, which were
combined with the aforementioned PAST-aided CIR-tracking method of Section 7.5 as well as with the
RLS CIR tap prediction method of Section 7.6.4 in order to create an efﬁcient channel estimation
scheme for MIMO-OFDM systems. More speciﬁcally, in Section 7.8.1 we considered both hard-
and soft-feedback-assisted LMS and RLS CIR tap tracking algorithms as well as the modiﬁed RLS
algorithm, which is capable of improved exploitation of the soft information associated with the
decision-based estimates.
Finally, in Figures 7.25–7.28 of Section 7.8.1.5 we documented the achievable performance of the
resultant MIMO-DDCE scheme employing the recursive CTF tracking of Section 7.8.1 followed by the
parametric CIR tap tracking and CIR tap prediction techniques of Sections 7.5 and 7.6, respectively.
We demonstrated that the MIMO-DDCE scheme proposed exhibits a good performance over the
entire range of practical conditions. More speciﬁcally, both the BER as well as the corresponding
MSE performance of the channel estimation scheme considered were characterized in the context of
a turbo-coded MIMO-OFDM system in Figures 7.25–7.28. We demonstrated that the MIMO-DDCE
scheme proposed remains effective in channel conditions associated with high terminal speeds of
up to 130 km/h, which corresponds to the OFDM-symbol- normalized Doppler frequency of 0.006.
Additionally, we reported a virtually error-free performance for a rate 1
2 turbo-coded 8 × 8 QPSK-
OFDM system, exhibiting a total bit rate of 8 bps/Hz and having a pilot overhead of only 10%, at an
SNR of 10 dB and normalized Doppler frequency of 0.003, which corresponds to a mobile terminal
speed of about 65 km/h.
In conclusion, the performance of the PAST-aided MIMO-DDCE scheme derived in Chapter 7 may
be characterized based on the MSE performance results depicted in Figure 18.1. More speciﬁcally, the
MSE σ2
e exhibited by the channel estimation scheme considered may be expressed as

where L is the number of estimated CIR taps, while mt and nr are the numbers of transmit and receive
antennas, respectively. Correspondingly, Lmtnr denotes the total number of independent channel-
related parameters estimated, while γ is the average SNR encountered at the receiver. Furthermore,
we employ the estimation efﬁciency factor κ of Equation 7.110. The value of the parameter κ was
determined empirically using Equation 7.110, yielding κ = 4 dB.
18.1.7
Joint Channel Estimation and MUD for SDMA-OFDM
The assumption of perfect channel estimation has been used in most of the previous chapters to simplify
the constraints. However, in practical MIMO-OFDM systems accurate channel estimation is required at
the receiver for invoking both coherent demodulation and interference cancellation. This task is more
challenging than that in the SISO scenario, owing to an increased number of independent transmitter–
receiver channel links as well as an increased interference level, as a result of employing multiple
transmitter antennas. Aiming to overcome the channel estimation challenge in MIMO-OFDM systems,

the PASTD forgetting factor was η = 0.95. The OFDM-symbol-normalized Doppler frequency was
fD = 0.001. The abscissa represents the average SNR recorded at the receive antenna elements.
in Chapter 8 we proposed a GA-assisted iterative Joint Channel Estimation and Multi-User Detection
(GA-JCEMUD) scheme which constitutes an attractive and effective solution to this problem.
In Section 8.1, various channel estimation approaches designed for MIMO-OFDM were outlined,
where we pointed out that none of the methods proposed for the BLAST- or SDMA-type multi-user
MIMO-OFDM systems in the open literature allowed the number of users to exceed that of the receiver
antennas, which we refer to as an overloaded scenario, because the corresponding singular channel
matrix results in an insufﬁcient degree of freedom at the detector. Explicitly, in this overloaded scenario
channel estimation becomes more challenging, especially in the context of decision-directed channel
estimators which are more vulnerable to error propagation. Against this background, we proposed an
iterative joint channel estimation and symbol detection scheme beneﬁtting from the GA’s optimization
power, which was illustrated in Figure 8.1 of Section 8.2. A full discussion of the proposed iterative
GA-JCEMUD approach was provided in Section 8.3, where the structure of the GA-JCEMUD was
detailed in Figure 8.2. The joint optimization method ﬁrst uses pilot OFDM symbols for generating
initial Frequency-Domain CHannel Transfer Function (FD-CHTF) estimates, which are then improved
by the time-domain ﬁlters, as elaborated on in Section 8.3.1. The improved channel estimates are used
to assist the Optimized Hierarchy Reduced Search Algorithm (OHRSA) of Section 8.3.2 in invoking
a ﬁrst-stage MUD. The initially detected user signals and the FD-CHTF estimates associated with the
previous OFDM symbol duration are then forwarded to the proposed GA-JCEMUD printed in the grey
block of Figure 8.2 for jointly optimizing the estimates of both the FD-CHTFs and multi-user data
symbols.
The GA-aided joint optimization process was detailed in Section 8.3.3. More speciﬁcally, we
outlined the mathematical representation of the GA individuals according to the MIMO channel’s
structure in Section 8.3.3.1 and described the initialization of the joint optimization in Section 8.3.3.2.
Furthermore, since the data symbols belong to the discrete legitimate constellation symbol set Mc,

572
Chapter 18. Summary, Conclusions and Future Research
while the FD-CHTFs are continuous valued and can be potentially inﬁnite across the complex plane C,
separate cross-over/mutation methods have to be invoked for the symbol chromosome and the channel
chromosome, as discussed in Sections 8.3.3.3.1 and 8.3.3.3.2. Additionally, in order to overcome the
limitations imposed by the conventional GA-aided MUDs, which can only provide single-individual-
based hard-decoded symbol estimates, a new algorithm was derived in Section 8.3.3.4 to assist the
GA in generating soft outputs based on the entire population, where we also argued that the proposed
GA generating the above-mentioned population-based soft outputs imposes only a modest complexity
increase in comparison with its conventional hard-decision-aided individual-based counterparts.
In Section 8.4 the numerical results generated by computer simulations were provided. As a
preliminary investigation, in Section 8.4.1 we ﬁrst identiﬁed the effect of the maximum mutation step
size λmax used in the GA-JCEMUD. It was shown in Figures 8.3 and 8.4 that the choice of λmax has
a signiﬁcant effect on the system’s performance, especially in high-SNR scenarios. In order to achieve
the best possible performance, typically a higher λmax value is required, when a higher OFDM-symbol-
normalized Doppler frequency FD is encountered, so that the rapid changes of the channel fades can
be successfully captured by the GA-JCEMUD. Based on Figure 8.4, the recommended values of λmax
in conjunction with different values of FD in terms of achieving the best attainable BER performance
can be identiﬁed. In Figure 8.5 of Section 8.4.2, the effect of different Doppler frequencies on the
proposed scheme was evaluated, where it was noticed that the performances of both the uncoded and
coded GA-JCEMUD-aided systems degraded as FD was increased. Nonetheless, the proposed GA-
JCEMUD-aided SDMA-OFDM system using a modest pilot overhead of ϵ = 2.5% was capable of
achieving a performance close to the perfect-CSI-aided optimum ML MUD at FD = 0.001, as seen in
Figure 8.5, while the system employing the MMSE MUD completely failed even with the aid of perfect
CSI. Furthermore, it was shown in Section 8.4.3 that the system’s performance can be improved by
invoking a higher number of GA-JCEMUD iterations, both with and without channel coding. Observe
in Figure 8.7 that at an SNR value of about 13 dB, the GA-JCEMUD using ϵ = 2.5% pilot overhead
approached the best-case FD-CHTF estimation MSE performance associated with ϵ = 100%. In an
effort to investigate the effect of the pilot overhead ϵ, we argued that a satisfactory performance can be
achieved with the aid of a pilot overhead as low as ϵ = 1.5% to 2.5%, as evidenced by Figure 8.8 of
Section 8.4.4.
To evaluate further the beneﬁts of the proposed joint optimization approach, in Section 8.4.5 we
compared the performances of the GA-JCEMUD and its counterpart, namely the GACE-OHRSA-
MUD, which serially concatenates the OHRSA MUD with the stand-alone GA-aided channel estimator.
It was shown in Figure 8.9 that the GA-JCEMUD outperformed the GACE-OHRSA-MUD, especially
in high-Doppler scenarios. This demonstrates the superiority of the joint optimization mechanism over
conventional ‘serially concatenated’ detection architectures. In Section 8.4.6, the merits of the proposed
soft GA-JCEMUD scheme were identiﬁed in terms of its ability of providing soft outputs. Observe in
Figure 8.10 that, with the advent of FEC codes, the proposed population-based soft-decoded GA was
capable of signiﬁcantly outperforming the conventional individual-based hard-decoded GA, especially
in high-Doppler scenarios, since it exhibited a higher robustness against fast-fading channels than the
conventional GAs. Last but not least, in Section 8.4.7 we examined the robustness of the GA-JCEMUD
in MIMO scenarios. As portrayed in Figure 8.11, the proposed iterative GA-JCEMUD was capable of
simultaneously capturing the fading envelope changes of each individual user–receiver link, regardless
of its instantaneous fading envelope value, and thus achieving an equally good performance over all
the user–receiver links. This result potently demonstrates the robustness of the GA-JCEMUD in MIMO
scenarios.

detector, the complexity of the LSD may still become excessive in the channel-coded iterative-detection-
aided MIMO system supporting a high number of users/transmit antennas and/or employing high-order
modulation schemes, such as 16-QAM. This is because the size of the transmitted MIMO symbol
candidate list generated by the LSD has to remain sufﬁciently large in the above-mentioned scenarios,
in order to deliver sufﬁciently accurate soft-bit information, i.e. LLRs, to the channel decoder during
the iterative detection process, thus achieving a high iteration gain.
Based on the above-mentioned observations of Chapter 9 we demonstrated in Chapter 10 that the
LSD’s EXIT curve may even decay upon increasing the a priori information fed back by the channel
decoder, as observed in Figure 10.2 of Section 10.2.1.3 as a consequence of having an insufﬁciently
large candidate list size. This results in a signiﬁcantly reduced iteration gain. This is because the inner
SD and outer channel decoder of Figure 10.1 exchange ﬂawed information owing to a shortage of
candidate solutions – more particularly, owing to the absence of the ML solution in the candidate list, as
revealed in Section 10.2.1.3. Thus, in order to reduce further the computational complexity imposed by
the conventional LSD, we optimized the LSD algorithm based on the exploitation of the LLRs gleaned
from the channel decoder during the iterative detection process by devising two enhanced SD schemes,
namely the centre-shifting-based SD of Section 10.2 and the ALT-based SD of Section 10.3.
More speciﬁcally, the SD procedure may be divided into two successive phases, namely the search-
centre calculation phase followed by the conﬁned tree search phase, as shown in Figure 18.2. The
operations in both of these phases may be optimized independently by exploiting the LLRs provided by
the channel decoder during the iterative detection process. For the centre calculation phase, conventional
SDs employ either the LS or the MMSE algorithm for computation of the search centre ˆc, as discussed
in Section 10.2.2, which is carried out only once during the ﬁrst iteration. However, during our
investigations in Section 10.2.2, we realized that it would be desirable to set the SD’s search centre
to a multi-user signal constellation point, which may be obtained using more sophisticated algorithms
rather than the LS or MMSE scheme and thus is expected to be closer to the real MAP solution than
both the LS and MMSE solutions, because this would allow us to reduce the SD’s search space and
hence its complexity.
Then, based on the centre-shifting theory, we proposed a generic centre-shifting-aided SD scheme
in Section 10.2.2, as portrayed in Figure 18.3, which may be expected to become signiﬁcantly more
powerful if it is employed in an iterative-detection-aided channel-coded system, since the process of
generating a more accurate search centre is further aided by the channel decoder, which substantially

contributes towards the total error-correction capability of the iterative receiver. Hence, in this treatise,
three particular centre-shifting-based SD schemes were devised, as shown in Figure 18.2, which
are the DHDC-aided centre-shifting SD of Section 10.2.3.1, the DSDC-aided centre-shifting SD of
Section 10.2.3.2 and the SIC-MMSE-aided centre-shifting SD of Section 10.2.3.3. The former two
simply update the search centre of the SD by the hard and soft decisions of the corresponding
transmitted MIMO symbols, respectively, which are obtained based on the a posteriori LLRs at
the output of the channel decoder, while the latter one exploits the slightly more sophisticated
SIC-MMSE algorithm in order to update the search centre based on the a priori LLRs provided
by the channel decoder. The operations of the proposed centre-shifting schemes are summarized
in Table 18.1 in contrast to those of the conventional SD using no centre shifting. Note that in
contrast to the LSD dispensing with the centre-shifting scheme, which may generate the candidate
list only once at the very beginning of the entire iterative detection process, our proposed iterative
centre-shifting-based SDs have to regenerate the candidate list for the following soft-bit-information
calculation, as long as the search centre is updated during the iterative detection process. However,
the computational complexity imposed by each candidate list generation of the centre-shifting-based
SD may be exponentially reduced, since the increasingly accurate search centres generated during
the iterative detection process allow us to rely on a signiﬁcantly reduced candidate list size, while
maintaining a near-MAP performance. Hence, the overall complexity imposed by the iterative centre-
shifting-based SD is expected to be signiﬁcantly reduced in comparison with the conventional SD
dispensing with the centre-shifting scheme, despite having an increased number of list generations
during the entire iterative detection process.
According to the iterative centre-shifting-based SD receiver design of Sections 10.2.3.1–10.2.3.3,
the centre-shifting SD-aided receiver design principles can be summarized as follows:
1.The search-centre calculation is based on the soft-bit information provided by the channel
decoder.
2. The search-centre update can be carried out in a more ﬂexible manner by activating the proposed
centre-shifting scheme, whenever the system requires its employment during the iterative detection
process in order to maximize the achievable iterative gain.
3. The search-centre update is ﬂexible, since it may be carried out by any of the well-known linear
or nonlinear detection techniques.
The key simulation results obtained in Section 10.2 for the BER performance and complexity of
the three proposed iterative centre-shifting-based SDs are summarized and quantiﬁed in Table 10.7,
in comparison with the conventional SD-aided iterative receiver using no centre-shifting scheme.
Speciﬁcally, in the challenging (8 × 4)-element 4-QAM SDMA-OFDM system, the DHDC-aided,

the DSDC-assisted and the SIC-MMSE-aided centre-shifting SDs of Sections 10.2.3.1–10.2.3.3 using
K = Ncand = 32 are capable of achieving a BER of 10−5 by requiring 0.1, 0.6 and 2.6 dB lower
transmit power or SNR than that necessitated by the conventional SD dispensing with the centre-
shifting scheme and using the same values of K as well as Ncand. Remarkably, the SIC-MMSE centre-
shifting SD scheme of Section 10.2.3.3 using K = Ncand = 32 may enable the iterative receiver to
exhibit a near-MAP performance which is achieved by the conventional SD using no centre shifting
in conjunction with a signiﬁcantly larger candidate list size of K = Ncand = 1024. This near-MAP
performance is achieved despite imposing a reduced complexity relating to detection candidate list
generation, which is about an order of magnitude lower than that exhibited by the list SD dispensing
with the proposed centre-shifting scheme. As a further beneﬁt, the computational complexity associated
with the extrinsic LLR calculation was reduced by a factor of about 64. The associated memory
requirements were also reduced by a factor of 64.
As shown in Figure 18.2, the soft-bit information delivered by the channel decoder may be exploited
for both the tree search phase and the centre calculation phase of the SD. The LSD proposed by Vikalo,
Hassibi and Kailath (VHK-SD) [642] was the ﬁrst one to exploit the a priori LLRs provided by the

channel decoder in the conﬁned tree search process, which was arranged by including the effect of the a
priori LLRs in the OF of the SD in a similar manner to that seen in Equation (14.44) of Section 14.3.1,
where the exploitation of the soft-bit information by the MSDSD was highlighted. In Section 10.3,
another reduced-complexity technique termed the ALT-aided SD scheme was devised by exploiting the
reliability of the bit decision conveyed by the a priori LLRs. More speciﬁcally, the philosophy of the
ALT-aided SD is to assume perfect knowledge of a particular bit, i.e. 0 or 1, and then test whether the
absolute value of the corresponding a priori LLR is higher than the preset threshold (ALT), followed by
pruning the branch associated with the opposite bit value, before the tree search continues. Thus, a better
pruning search tree may be formed as seen for example in Figure 10.23 of Section 10.3.1, resulting in an
improved performance and a reduced complexity, as observed in Figure 10.24 of Section 10.3.2.1 and
Figure 10.25 of Section 10.3.2.2, respectively. As demonstrated in Section 10.3.2.3, the ALT threshold
has to be carefully adjusted to achieve the target performance as a function of the SNR encountered.
Furthermore, Section 10.3.2.4 demonstrated that the non-Gaussian distribution of the LLRs at the output
of the ALT-aided SD during the iterative detection process limits its capacity and imposes difﬁculties
in predicting the EXIT-chart-assisted performance. On the other hand, although the proposed ALT
scheme is capable of providing useful performance improvements, which are slightly less signiﬁcant
than those achieved by the SIC-MMSE-assisted centre-shifting-based SD scheme of Section 10.2.3.3,
an attractive performance–complexity trade-off may be achieved by the combination of the two, as seen
in Section 10.3.3. More particularly, the detection complexity imposed by the SIC-MMSE-assisted
centre-shifting SD can be halved with the aid of the ALT technique as observed in Figure 10.32,
despite suffering a modest performance loss of about 0.5 dB, as demonstrated in Figure 10.31 in the
(8×4)-element 4-QAM SDMA-OFDM scenario. The characteristics of a range of centre-shifting-aided
SDs are summarized in Table 18.2, while the features of the proposed ALT technique are summarized
in comparison with those of the centre-shifting scheme in Table 18.3. Note that the ALT scheme is
applicable to both the coherent SD and the non-coherent SDs (MSDSD), whereas the centre-shifting
scheme works only for the coherent SDs. This is because the equivalent search centre of the MSDSD
of Chapter 12 is the origin, which is independent of the transmitted signal, thus requiring no updates.

EXIT-Chart-Aided Adaptive SD Mechanism
As a further evolution of the LLR-exploitation-based complexity-reduction schemes contrived for co-
herent SD-aided iterative receivers in Sections 10.2 and 10.3, an EXIT-chart-aided adaptive mechanism
was proposed to reduce the complexity imposed by an SD-aided near-capacity system in the context
of non-coherently detected SD-aided cooperative systems. Speciﬁcally, an adaptive-window-duration-
based MSDSD scheme was devised in Section 14.4.3.1. The philosophy of the proposed adaptive-
window-based scheme, which is characterized by the EXIT chart of Figure 14.17(a) in Section 14.4.3.1,
is based on the observation that the intersection point of the EXIT curves of the inner and outer
decoders may be gradually pushed towards the (1, 1) point by increasing the observation window size
Nwind at the cost of imposing an exponentially increased computational complexity per iteration. Thus,
in order to reduce the overall detection complexity while maintaining a near-capacity performance,
the observation window size of the adaptive-window-duration-based MSDSD was initially set to the
smallest value of Nwind = 2, which would be slightly increased as soon as the iterative decoding
between the inner and outer decoders converged. The signiﬁcantly reduced overall complexity observed
in Figure 14.17(b) of Section 14.4.3.1 is due to the exponentially reduced complexity imposed by the
early-stage iterations using small values of Nwind, despite having an increased total number of iterations
required by the decoding trajectory to reach the (1, 1) point. Remarkably, the complexity imposed by
the MSDSDs is substantially reduced, as seen in Figure 14.17(b) of Section 14.4.3.1, which is a beneﬁt
of the adaptive-window-assisted scheme. Quantitatively, observe in Figure 14.17(b) that this complexity
reduction may be as high as 75% at SNRoverall
t
= 2 dB, when the open EXIT tunnel created by having
Nwind = 7 becomes rather narrow. The attainable complexity reduction increases even further to about
83% when the open EXIT tunnel becomes wider at SNRoverall
t
= 4 dB, as also seen in Figure 14.17(b).
Importantly, we should point out here that the simple yet powerful adaptive SD mechanism
proposed for the MSDSD in Section 14.4.3.1 may be also applied to the coherent SD-aided iterative
receiver of Chapter 10 for reducing the overall iterative detection complexity. More speciﬁcally,
the candidate list size Ncand may be adaptively increased based on the same philosophy used by
the adaptive-window-duration-aided scheme during the iterative detection process, since the EXIT
curve is shifted upwards as the value of Ncand increases, as observed for example in Figure 10.2 of
Section 10.2.1.3. The principles of the generic adaptive SD mechanism invoked in iterative receivers
are summarized in Table 18.4 along with its major characteristics.
18.1.9
Transmit Diversity Schemes Employing SDs
A multi-layer tree search mechanism was proposed for SDs in Chapter 11 in order to facilitate
its application in STBC-SP-assisted MU-MIMO systems in the interest of achieving a near-MAP
performance at a low complexity. Based on the philosophy of the multi-layer tree search, we also
adopted the SD algorithm at the BS for the differentially modulated user-cooperation-based cellular

uplink scenario of Chapter 12 for jointly and non-coherently detecting the multi-path signals transmitted
by the source and relay nodes. In the ensuing Section 18.1.9.1 the idea of the multi-layer tree-search-
aided SD will be brieﬂy echoed, followed by a summary of its applications in the above-mentioned
transmit-diversity-oriented systems in Section 18.1.9.2.
18.1.9.1
Generalized Multi-layer Tree Search Mechanism
In comparison with the tree search of Section 9.2 conducted by the conventional SD algorithm, where
each tree node is a single dimension associated with the trial symbol point transmitted from a speciﬁc
transmit antenna, the tree node of the generic multi-layer search tree depicted in Figure 18.4 may
consist of a number of symbol candidates transmitted from multiple spatially separated antennas either
of a particular user or of different users, and thus may be of multi-dimensional nature. Actually, the
generic multi-layer tree search mechanism of Section 11.3.2.3 includes the conventional single-layer
tree search as a special case, when the signals transmitted from different antennas are uncorrelated with
each other. In other words, when the signals transmitted from different antennas are jointly designed,
as, for example, experienced in the STBC-SP-aided MU-MIMO system of Section 11.2.2.1, or exhibit
correlations, as, for example, encountered in the user-cooperation-based systems of Section 12.3.1, the
multi-layer tree search of Section 11.3.2.3 has to be invoked.
18.1.9.2
Spatial Diversity Schemes Using SDs
It was argued in Section 11.2.2.1 that combining orthogonal transmit diversity designs with the principle
of SP is capable of maximizing the achievable coding advantage. The resultant STBC-SP scheme was
capable of outperforming the conventional orthogonal-design-based STBC schemes in the SU-MIMO
scenario. Speciﬁcally, the STBC-SP scheme of Section 11.2.2.1 combines the signals transmitted from
multiple antennas into a joint ST design using the SP scheme, as demonstrated in Figure 11.4. However,
existing MU-MIMO designs make no attempt to do so, owing to the associated complex detection. We
solved this complexity problem by further developing the SD for detection of SP modulation using
the proposed multi-layer tree search mechanism in Section 11.3, because SP may offer a substantial
SNR reduction, although at a potentially excessive complexity, which can be reduced by the multi-
dimensional tree-search-based SD of Section 11.3.2. Explicitly, the K-best SD algorithm designed for
a four-dimensional SP modulation scheme was summarized in Section 11.3.2.3. The enhanced coding

18.1.10. SD-Aided MIMO System Designs
579
advantage achieved by the STBC-SP is indicated by the increased area under the corresponding EXIT
curve in contrast to that associated with the conventional STBC scheme, as observed in Figure 11.9
of Section 11.3.3. More particularly, as a beneﬁt of employing the SP modulation, performance gains
of 1.5 dB and 3.5 dB can be achieved by 16-SP and 256-SP modulated systems in Scenario I and
Scenario II of Table 11.2, respectively, in comparison with their identical-throughput QAM-based
counterparts, given a target BER of 10−4 and Ncand = 128, as observed from Figures 11.10(a)
and 11.10(b) of Section 11.3.3.
Although co-located multiple-transmit-antenna-aided diversity techniques are capable of mitigating
the deleterious effects of fading, as discussed in Chapter 11, it is often impractical for a pocket-sized
terminal to employ a number of antennas owing to its limited size and cost constraint. Fortunately,
another type of transmit diversity, namely the so-called cooperative diversity relying on cooperation
among multiple single-antenna-assisted terminals, may be achieved in multi-user wireless systems.
Hence, more realistic user-cooperation mechanisms requiring no CSI were advocated in Chap-
ter 12, which was based on differentially encoded transmissions and on non-coherent detection
techniques. Hence they circumvent the potentially excessive-complexity channel estimation as well
as the high pilot overhead encountered by conventional coherent-detection-aided cooperative systems,
especially in mobile environments associated with relatively rapidly ﬂuctuating channel conditions.
The ML-MSDD technique of Section 12.2.1 was introduced in support of user cooperation in the
context of the multi-layer tree-search-based SD algorithm of Section 12.3.3.4, for rendering the system
robust to time-selective propagation environments at an affordable complexity, leading to an MSDSD-
aided differential user-cooperation-based system. The characteristics of the uncoded MSDSD-aided
cooperative systems using both the DAF and DDF schemes of Sections 12.3.2.1 and 12.3.2.2 are
compared and summarized in Table 18.5. Note that during the MSDSD design procedure adopted for
differentially encoded cooperative systems in Section 12.3.3, we relied on the assumptions that both
the signal and noise received at the BS in the DAF-aided system obey complex-Gaussian distributions
and that the source’s signal can always be error-freely decoded prior to forwarding it to the BS in the
DDF-aided system. This allowed us to simplify signiﬁcantly the associated MSDSD design problems,
while still being able to construct a powerful non-coherent detector which is substantially more robust
to the effects of mobile environments than the CDD. Finally, since the SD devised for both the
STBC-SP-based non-cooperative MU-MIMO system of Chapter 11 and the differentially encoded user-
cooperation-based system of Chapter 12 employs the multi-layer tree search mechanism, the salient
features concerning the multi-dimensional search tree are summarized in Table 18.6.

SD-Aided MIMO System Designs
18.1.10.1
Resource-Optimized Hybrid Cooperative System Design
Although it was shown in Chapter 12 that the maximum attainable spatial diversity gain can usually
be achieved by the differentially modulated user cooperative uplink system, the achievable end-to-end
BER performance may signiﬁcantly depend on the speciﬁc choice of the cooperative protocol employed
and/or on the quality of the relay channel. Therefore, the resource allocation arrangements employed by
the cooperative cellular uplink, namely the transmit power allocation and the RS’s geometric location,
play a vital role in achieving the best possible performance. In order to achieve the best possible BER
performance, a ﬂexible resource-optimized adaptive hybrid cooperation-aided system was designed in
Chapter 13.
The corresponding system design procedure based on the major ﬁndings of each section of
Chapter 13 is summarized in Table 18.7. More speciﬁcally, the associated theoretical performance
analysis was carried out for both the DAF- and DDF-aided cooperative systems in Sections 13.2.1
and 13.2.2, respectively. The derived exact end-to-end BER expression of Equation (13.40) for the
DAF-aided system was signiﬁcantly simpliﬁed by assuming a high SNR and by using the same
technique as in [604], resulting in the tight BER lower bound of Equation (13.48), as characterized
in Figure 13.5, which was valid for high SNRs. As for the DDF-aided system, the BER upper bound of

Equation (13.56) was derived for the single-relay-assisted system as an example based on the worst-case
PLR of Equation (13.52) at the RS, which was shown to be capable of closely capturing the dependency
of the BER on the SNR, as seen in Figure 13.6.
The above-mentioned power allocation and RS location selection schemes were investigated for
both the DAF- and DDF-aided systems in Section 13.3 with the aid of our theoretical BER results of
Section 13.2. More particularly, based on the minimum BER criterion, the APC schemes of the DAF-
and DDF-aided system were devised in Sections 13.3.1.1 and 13.3.2 respectively, which were capable
of achieving signiﬁcant performance gains by ﬁnding the optimum power allocation for a given RS
location arrangement, as depicted in Figures 13.9(a) and 13.14(a). On the other hand, based on the
observation of Figures 13.9(b) and 13.14(b), we found that the achievable BER is proportional to the
distance between the cooperating MS and the optimum RS location. Hence the CUS schemes, which
were contrived for both the DAF- and DDF-aided systems in Sections 13.3.1.2 and 13.3.2, respectively,
simply activate the RS closest to the optimum location from the available RS candidate pool, resulting in
substantial performance improvements, as observed in Figures 13.11 and 13.17. To achieve the globally
optimum resource allocation, iterative power versus RS location optimization was also carried out in
Sections 13.3.1.2 and 13.3.2, as illustrated in Figures 13.10 and 13.15. Remarkably, apart from having
an enhanced BER performance, the complexity imposed by the MSDSD of Chapter 12 can also be
signiﬁcantly reduced by employing the CUS and APC schemes in the context of rapidly fading channels,
as observed in Figures 13.12(b) and 13.13(b).

2. Mechanism: cooperative protocol employed by the activated RS is adaptively chosen
(Section 13.4.2)
in the interest of achieving the best BER performance
3. Beneﬁts: improved performance (see Figure 13.21)
Owing to the different levels of sensitivity to the quality of the SR link as seen in Figure 13.18,
the optimum resource allocation arrangements corresponding to the two above-mentioned systems may
be quite different, as revealed by our comparative studies in Section 13.4.1. Speciﬁcally, as indicated
by Table 13.5, it is desirable that the activated cooperating MSs are roaming in the vicinity of the
source MS for the DDF-aided system, while the cooperating MSs roaming in the neighbourhood of the
BS are preferred for its DAF-aided counterpart. Additionally, in comparison with the former system,
a larger portion of the total transmit power should be allocated to the source MS in the context of
a DAF-aided system. Furthermore, in order to exploit the complementarity of the above-mentioned
cooperative systems, a more ﬂexible resource-optimized adaptive hybrid cooperation-aided system was
proposed in Section 13.4.2, where the protocol employed by a speciﬁc cooperating MS may also be
adaptively selected in the interest of achieving the best possible BER performance. Thus, the DAF and
DDF cooperative protocols may coexist in the same cooperative network. As an example, the operations
of the hybrid cooperative cellular uplink system are summarized as follows:
1. Determine the DAF and DDF areas between the source MS and the BS by calculating the
globally optimum RS locations via the proposed iterative power versus RS location optimization
scheme.
2. In order to exploit the complementarity of the DAF and DDF schemes, activate an RS in each of
the above-deﬁned areas which is situated closest to the globally optimum location.
3. Adaptively calculate the power allocation solution based on the actual locations of the activated
RSs.

Near-Capacity Cooperative and Non-cooperative System Designs
To achieve a near-capacity performance, in Chapter 14 we devised a low-complexity near-capacity
system design with the aid of near-optimum SDs for both the non-cooperative and cooperative MIMO
systems in Section 10.4 and Section 14.4, respectively. The near-capacity design of the former system,
which is reduced to an EXIT-curve-matching problem, serves as the fundamental method of achieving
the cooperative network’s capacity for the latter system, since the joint source–relay mode design

4. Design the IrCCs for the average target rate using EXIT-curve matching
procedure of the single-relay-aided cooperative system can be decoupled into two separate EXIT-curve-
matching problems.
For the non-cooperative MIMO system, the near-capacity system design procedure is summarized
in Table 18.8 along with its corresponding URC-aided three-stage receiver structure. To be speciﬁc,
in order to approach the channel capacity of the non-cooperative MIMO system, we demonstrated in
Section 10.4.1 that the iterative decoding convergence of this two-stage system may be improved by
incorporating a URC having an inﬁnite impulse response which improves the efﬁciency of extrinsic
information exchange, as observed in Figure 10.35(a). More particularly, the URC-aided inner decoder’s
EXIT curve of Figure 10.35(a) is capable of reaching the (1, 1) point by having a lower starting
point, which in turn yields a reduced error ﬂoor and a higher SNR threshold, above which decoding
convergence to a vanishingly low BER becomes possible. Furthermore, this slightly more complex
three-stage system architecture allows us to use a low-complexity SD having a signiﬁcantly reduced
candidate list size Ncand. Alternatively, a reduced SNR is required. For example, as depicted in
Figure 18.5(a), given a target BER of 10−5 and Ncand = 32 for the SD, the three-stage receiver
is capable of achieving a performance gain of 2.5 dB over its two-stage counterpart in a rank-
deﬁcient SDMA-OFDM 4-QAM system supporting U = 8 co-channel users and employing N = 4
receive antennas at the BS, i.e. in an (8 × 4)-element system. For further enhancing the three-stage
concatenated receiver, the proposed iterative centre-shifting SD scheme of Section 10.2.3.3 and IrCCs
of Section 10.4.3 are intrinsically amalgamated, leading to an additional performance gain of 2 dB, as
also observed in Figure 18.5(a).
Figure 18.5(b) depicts the computational complexity – which is quantiﬁed in terms of the number
of PED evaluations corresponding to the term φ of Equation (9.25) – imposed by the SD versus the
Eb/N0 value for the above-mentioned receivers. The number of PED evaluations carried out per
channel use by the system dispensing with the centre-shifting scheme remains as high as 13 652,
regardless of the SNR and the number of iterations, since we assume a sufﬁciently large buffer size
to store the resultant candidate list in order to eliminate the need for list regeneration. On the other
hand, in the presence of the centre-shifting scheme, the candidate list has to be regenerated at each
iteration; nonetheless, the total complexity imposed by the centre-shifting-based SD of the two-stage
receiver is substantially reduced, as seen in Figure 18.5(b). We can also observe from Figure 18.5(b)
that the centre-shifting K-best SD employed by the IrCC-aided three-stage system using the near-
capacity design of Section 10.4.1 imposes a computational complexity, which is even below that of its
centre-shifting-aided two-stage counterpart, while achieving a performance gain of 2 dB at the target
BER of 10−5, as seen in Figure 18.5(a). Hence, the signiﬁcant complexity reduction facilitated by the
proposed SD scheme in the context of the three-stage receiver outweighs the relatively small additional
complexity cost imposed by the URC, which only employs a two-state trellis, leading to an overall
reduced complexity. Furthermore, in addition to the complexity reduction achieved by the proposed
scheme, another beneﬁt is the attainable memory reduction, since there is no need to store the resultant

reduced by having signiﬁcantly reduced values of Ncand and K.
Prior to outlining the near-capacity design principles for the DDF-aided user-cooperation-based
system of Section 14.4.3, the corresponding DCMC capacity was quantiﬁed in Section 14.4.1 in
comparison with that of its classic direct-transmission-based counterpart in order to answer the
grave fundamental question of whether it is worth introducing cooperative mechanisms into the
development of wireless networks, such as the cellular voice and data networks. This is because,
when a cooperative wireless communication system is designed to approach the maximum achievable
spectral efﬁciency by taking the cooperation-induced multiplexing loss into account, it is not obvious
whether or not the repetition-based relay-aided system becomes superior to its direct-transmission-
based counterpart, especially when advanced channel coding techniques are employed. It was observed
in Figure 14.12 of Section 14.4.1 that when the overall equivalent SNR is relatively low, the single-
relay-assisted cooperative system exhibits a signiﬁcantly higher capacity than its direct-transmission-
based counterpart in typical urban cellular radio scenarios, e.g. when having a path-loss exponent of
v = 3. However, the achievable capacity gain may be substantially reduced if we encounter a free-
space propagation scenario [607], i.e. v = 2, since the reduced-path-loss-related power gain achieved is
insufﬁciently high to compensate for the signiﬁcant multiplexing loss inherent in the single-relay-aided
half-duplex cooperative system. Moreover, as the overall equivalent SNR increases to a relatively high
value, there is no beneﬁt in invoking a single-relay-aided cooperative system, since its capacity becomes
lower than that of the conventional point-to-point system.
Then, based on the investigation of the single-relay-assisted DDF-based cooperative system’s
DCMC capacity detailed in Section 14.4.1, we proposed a practical framework for designing a
cooperative system which is capable of performing close to the network’s corresponding non-coherent
DCMC capacity. Speciﬁcally, based on our low-complexity near-capacity design criterion, a novel
Ir-DHDC coding scheme was contrived, which was depicted in Figure 14.13 in Section 14.4.2 for
the DDF-aided cooperative system employing the low-complexity SISO iterative MSDSD scheme of
Section 14.3. The SISO MSDSD was shown to achieve capacity for direct transmission over time-
selective block-fading channels, as shown in Figure 14.7, provided that the observation window size

Nwind employed was equal to the fading block length Tb. On the other hand, in order to enhance the
coding gain achieved by the repetition code constituted by the relay-aided system, while maintaining
a high cooperative diversity gain, the classic turbo coding mechanism was introduced into the DF-
aided cooperative system by interleaving the RS’s estimated source data prior to re-encoding them, as
seen in Figure 14.13 of Section 14.4.2, resulting in the so-called distributed turbo coding philosophy.
Furthermore, in order to achieve near-capacity transmissions between the source and relay, a URC-aided
three-stage serially concatenated transceiver employing the IrCCs of Section 10.4.3 may be employed
in the single-relay-aided DDF cooperative system in Figure 14.13 together with the corresponding
three-stage receiver employed by the RS. According to the principles of the distributed turbo decoding
mechanism proposed in [620], at the destination BS the novel iterative receiver of Figure 14.14 is used
for decoding the Ir-DHCD coded signal received from the source and relay nodes. More explicitly,
we have to decode iteratively the signal received during the broadcast phase and the relay phase,
respectively, followed by the classic extrinsic information exchange between the two. The near-capacity
single-relay-assisted cooperative system design procedure of Section 14.4.3 is summarized in Table 18.9
along with the proposed Ir-DHCD coding scheme of Section 14.4.2.
It was clearly shown in Figure 14.23 that, on using the near-capacity system design of Sec-
tion 14.4.3, the proposed Ir-DHCD coding scheme becomes capable of performing within about 2 dB
and 1.8 dB from the corresponding single-relay-aided DDF cooperative system’s DCMC capacity for
the free-space environment associated with v = 2 and for the typical urban scenario associated with
v = 3, respectively. Furthermore, an SNR gain of 0.65 dB can be achieved in a free-space scenario
by the direct-transmission-based system over its single-relay-aided cooperative counterpart, given a
bandwidth efﬁciency of 0.47 bps/Hz, as shown in Figure 14.23(a). However, in a typical urban area
cellular radio environment, the single-relay-aided cooperative system becomes capable of signiﬁcantly
outperforming the direct-transmission-based system, requiring an overall transmit power which is about
2.5 dB lower than that necessitated by the latter in order to achieve an inﬁnitesimally low BER, while
maintaining a bandwidth efﬁciency of 0.43 bps/Hz, as depicted in Figure 14.23(b). Therefore, in line
with our predictions made in Section 14.4.1.2, it was observed from Figures 14.23 and 14.24 that

18.1.11. Multi-stream Detection in SDM-OFDM Systems
585
for a given target bandwidth efﬁciency, the single-relay-aided cooperative system does not necessarily
guarantee a performance superior to that of the conventional direct-transmission-based system.
18.1.11
Multi-stream Detection in SDM-OFDM Systems
In Chapter 15, we presented an overview of several popular SDM detection methods available in the
literature. Speciﬁcally, in Section 15.2.1 we demonstrated that the linear increase in capacity, which
was predicted by the information theoretical analysis of [266], may indeed be achieved by employing
a relatively low-complexity linear SDM detection method, such as the MMSE SDM technique [330].
Secondly, in Section 15.3.1 we showed that a substantially better performance can be achieved by
employing the higher-complexity nonlinear Maximum Likelihood (ML) SDM detector [311,331,332],
which constitutes the optimal detection method from a probabilistic sequence-estimation point of view.
To elaborate a little further, the ML SDM detector is capable of attaining transmit diversity in fully
loaded systems, where the number of transmit and receive antennas is equal. Moreover, as opposed
to the linear detection schemes considered, the ML SDM detector is capable of operating in the rank-
deﬁcient system conﬁguration, when the number of transmit antennas exceeds that of receive antennas.
Unfortunately, however, the excessive computational complexity associated with the exhaustive search
employed by the ML detection method renders it inapplicable to practical implementation in systems
having a high number of transmit antennas. Subsequently, in Sections 15.3.2 and 15.3.3 we explored a
range of advanced nonlinear SDM detection methods, namely both an SIC and a GA-aided MMSE
detector, respectively, where the latter may constitute an attractive compromise between the low
complexity of the linear SDM detector and the high performance of the ML SDM detection schemes.
Indeed, we demonstrated in Section 15.3.3 that both the SDM detection method based on the SIC and
the GA-MMSE detector [329] are capable of satisfying these requirements.
18.1.12
Iterative Channel Estimation and Multi-stream Detection in
SDM-OFDM Systems
In Chapter 16 we focused our attention on a family of potent Reduced Search Algorithm (RSA) aided
space–time processing methods, the members of which exhibit a particularly advantageous trade-off
between the achievable performance and the associated computational complexity, namely the family of
SD-aided SDM detection methods. Consequently, a set of novel OHRSA-aided SDM detection methods
was outlined in Section 16.1. Speciﬁcally, in Section 16.1.1 we derived the OHRSA-aided ML SDM
detector, which beneﬁts from the optimal performance of the ML SDM detector [265], while exhibiting
a relatively low computational complexity which is only slightly higher than that required by the low-
complexity MMSE SDM detector [265]. To elaborate a little further, in Section 16.1.2 we derived a bit-
based OHRSA-aided ML SDM detector which allows us to apply the OHRSA method of Section 16.1
in high-throughput systems which employ multi-level modulation schemes, such as M-QAM [265].
In Section 16.1.3 we deduced the OHRSA-aided Max-Log-MAP SDM detector which allows for
efﬁcient evaluation of the soft-bit information and therefore results in highly efﬁcient turbo decoding.
Unfortunately, however, in comparison with the OHRSA-aided ML SDM detector of Section 16.1.2
the OHRSA-aided Max-Log-MAP SDM detector of Section 16.1.3 still exhibits a substantially higher
complexity. Consequently, in Section 16.1.5 we derive an approximate Max-Log-MAP method, namely
the SOPHIE SDM detector. This detector combines the advantages of both the OHRSA-aided ML
and OHRSA-aided Log-MAP SDM detectors of Sections 16.1.2 and 16.1.3, respectively. Speciﬁcally,
it exhibits a similar performance to that of the optimal Max-Log-MAP detector, while imposing a
modest complexity which is only slightly higher than that required by the low-complexity MMSE SDM
detector [265]. The computational complexity as well as the achievable performance of the SOPHIE
SDM detector of Section 16.1.5 were analysed and quantiﬁed in Sections 16.1.5.1 and 16.1.5.2,
respectively.

2 turbo-coded 16-QAM systems, respectively.
18.1.13
Approximate Log-MAP SDM-OFDM Multi-stream Detection
In Chapter 17 we derived an iterative, so-called turbo Multi-Antenna, Multi-Carrier (MAMC) receiver
architecture. Following the philosophy of turbo processing [314], our turbo SDM-OFDM receiver of
Figure 17.1 comprises a succession of detection modules which iteratively exchange soft-bit-related
information and thus facilitate a substantial improvement in the overall system performance.
More speciﬁcally, our turbo SDM-OFDM receiver comprises three major components, namely the
soft-feedback decision-directed channel estimator discussed in detail in Section 7.8, followed by the
soft-input, soft-output OHRSA Log-MAP SDM detector derived in Section 16.1.3 and a soft-input, soft-
output serially concatenated turbo code [345]. Consequently, in Figures 17.3–17.14 of Chapter 17 we
analysed the achievable performance of each individual constituent component of our turbo receiver, as
well as the achievable performance of the entire amalgamated iterative system. We aimed at identifying
the optimum system conﬁguration while considering various design trade-offs, such as the achievable
BER performance, the attainable data rate and the associated computational complexity.
In Section 17.4.2.4 we demonstrated that our turbo SDM-OFDM system employing the MIMO-
DDCE scheme of Section 7.8 as well as the OHRSA Max-Log-MAP SDM detector of Section 16.1.3
remains effective in channel conditions associated with high mobile speeds of up to 130 km/h,
which corresponds to the OFDM-symbol-normalized Doppler frequency of 0.006. Additionally, in
Figure 17.13 we reported a virtually error-free performance for a rate 1/2 turbo-coded 8 × 8 QPSK-
OFDM system, exhibiting an effective throughput of 8 MHz · 8 bps/Hz = 64 Mbps and having a pilot
overhead of only 10% at an SNR of 7.5 dB and a normalized Doppler frequency of 0.003, which
corresponds to a mobile terminal speed of about 65 km/h.

18.2. Suggestions for Future Research
587
In conclusion, we offer the following important observations. The potential performance gain
achievable by an iterative multi-antenna, multi-carrier system may be dissected into several major
regions, where we may identify the diversity gain region, the detection gain region and the iterative
gain region. Consider the BER versus SNR performance curves depicted in Figure 18.6:
• Firstly, the diversity gain region may be associated with the interval spanning the SNR values
of Figure 18.6, which lie between performance curves 1 and 2 corresponding to the scenarios of
low and high diversity ranks,1 respectively. Correspondingly, the achievable diversity gain may
be realized by attaining a sufﬁcient diversity rank contributed by the combination of the channel
and waveform parameters. This phenomenon is exempliﬁed, for instance, by Figure 17.8 of
Section 17.3.
• The detection gain region may be identiﬁed as the region of the SNR values located between
performance curves 2 and 3 of Figure 18.6, which correspond to the systems employing for
example a linear MMSE detector and a near-optimum Max-Log-MAP detector, respectively.
The achievable detection gain may be realized by means of employing an efﬁcient MIMO
detection method reminiscent of the OHRSA method derived in Chapter 16. This phenomenon
is exempliﬁed, for instance, by Figure 15.11 of Section 15.5.
• Finally, the iterative gain region corresponds to the interval of the SNR values located between
performance curves 3 and 4 of Figure 18.6, which correspond to the systems employing a single
as well as eight detection and decoding iterations. Correspondingly, the attainable iterative gain
may be realized by employing iterative detection and decoding, which invokes the iterative
exchange of soft-bit-related information and thus facilitates the efﬁcient exploitation of the
diversity rank available. This phenomenon is exempliﬁed, for instance, by Figures 17.3 and 17.6
of Sections 17.2 and 17.3, respectively.
18.2
Suggestions for Future Research
In this section, based on the work reported in this monograph, a few suggestions for future research are
summarized.
18.2.1
Optimization of the GA MUD Conﬁguration
The GA-based MUDs have found applications in diverse SDMA-OFDM systems investigated in this
book. It is worth pointing out that the proposed GAs may be further improved in various ways. On
the one hand, the operators and parameters are all tunable, implying that the conﬁgurations we have
invoked may not necessarily be optimum. For example, the value of the mutation probability pm can be
adapted according to:
• The number of users. A higher value of pm can be used when more users’ signals have to be
detected, which may increase the chances of ﬁnding the optimum solution.
• The GA’s generation index. During the early generations, pm can be set to a high value to assist
the GA in identifying the more promising search branches. As the search process progresses, pm
can be reduced to achieve a better local ﬁne resolution of the search region.
The maximum mutation step size λmax of the GA-JCEMUD of Chapter 8 can also be adjusted
adaptively in accordance with the Doppler frequency, as discussed in Section 8.3.3.3.2. Other
GA parameter control methods, e.g. those of [466], may also be employed to optimize the GA’s
conﬁgurations.
On the other hand, in the context of generating the GA’s soft output, in this book we only
exploited the individuals of the ﬁnal generation for calculating the soft information. However, a
1Quantitatively speaking, the low diversity rank channel is a channel where the distribution of the total channel energy is
reminiscent of a χ2
2D distribution, with D ≈1. Correspondingly, the high diversity channels are channels where we have D ≫1.

performance improvement may be achieved by introducing an ‘individual log’, which stores the OSs of
all meritorious individuals throughout all generations and thus assists in improving the reliability of the
GA’s soft output.
Additionally, the GA individual’s symbol chromosome, which consists of the multiple users’ hard-
decoded symbol estimates, may also be represented by the soft-bit estimates, enabling the GA to beneﬁt
from the soft information provided by the channel decoders during the external iterative processing. This
is expected to improve the performance of the iterative GAs, such as the IGA MUD of Section 5.3.2
and the GA-JCEMUD of Chapter 8.
18.2.2
Enhanced FD-CHTF Estimation
While the proposed GA-JCEMUD scheme of Chapter 8 uses the previous FD-CHTF estimates as
a reference for the current FD-CHTF estimates, its mutation operator, namely the step mutation of
Section 8.3.3.3.2, invokes the mutation process based on a uniform probability for all directions around
the original FD-CHTF to be mutated, as implied by Equation (8.26). In other words, it does not
exploit the ‘directional’ information of the time-domain correlation between the FD-CHTFs associated
with the subcarriers of consecutive OFDM symbols. Here we recall Figure 8.11, which compared the
real/imaginary values’ evolution of the perfect as well as the GA-estimated FD-CHTFs. In the same
spirit, an example of the above-mentioned directional correlation is illustrated in Figure 18.7, where
the virtual contours of n = 1, . . . , 5 OFDM symbols observed in ﬁve consecutive OFDM symbol
durations at a speciﬁc user–receiver channel link are portrayed, which are constituted by the different
dashed curves. Similar to Figure 8.11, each black dot seen in Figure 18.7 represents the FD-CHTF at a
speciﬁc subcarrier. The solid curves with arrows show the direction of evolution for the FD-CHTFs at
each subcarrier in the context of the time domain.

Figure 18.8: Methodological analysis of the mobile wireless communication system.
Therefore, by borrowing the idea of the BQM approach proposed in Section 5.3.1.2, it would
be beneﬁcial to design a mutation operator which is capable of tracking the direction of the FD-
CHTF variation at each subcarrier in consecutive OFDM symbol durations. Similarly, the directional
frequency-domain correlation between consecutive subcarriers in the same OFDM symbol can also be
exploited. The mutation operator combining both the time-domain and the frequency-domain direction-
tracking strategies may be expected to improve the performance of the GA-JCEMUD scheme.
Moreover, the joint channel estimation and symbol detection approach can be further enhanced
by introducing a Soft-Input, Soft-Output (SInSOu) mechanism. More speciﬁcally, not only the GA-
optimized FD-CHTF estimates but also the GA-optimized symbol estimates can be forwarded to the
OHRSA MUD of Section 8.3.2 to assist in the initial symbol detection invoked in the next iteration. In
this way the OHRSA MUD would be capable of beneﬁtting from the GA in terms of both perspectives,
thus improving the reliability of the initial symbol estimates, which in turn may be expected to result in
a better overall system performance.
18.2.3
Radial-Basis-Function-Assisted OFDM
Generally speaking, GAs belong to the family of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) [643, 644], which
invokes the principles of natural evolution. With the aid of the advances in Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI),
a range of other problem-solving methods have also emerged. One of these techniques is constituted
by the family of Neural Networks (NNs) [645, 646], which is based on the models that mimic the
operation of how biological neurons are connected in the human brain. Furthermore, EAs/GAs have
been applied in constructing and training NNs in numerous research ﬁelds [538, 647, 648]. In the
context of wireless communications, NNs have also found employment in various ﬁelds, e.g. in channel
equalization [569, 649, 650]. Moreover, NNs are also applicable to the ﬁeld of multi-user detection.

For example, the so-called Radial Basis Function (RBF) [569, 651, 652] based NN has been proposed
for multi-user detection in CDMA-type systems [653–656]. However, hardly any research has been
conducted in the context of RBF-assisted multi-user OFDM systems [657–660]. Explicitly, exploiting
RBF with or without the aid of EAs/GAs for employment in OFDM, MIMO-OFDM and SDMA-OFDM
systems, especially for highly complicated nonlinear applications such as for example joint detection
schemes, constitutes a wide research area. Alternatively, Minimum Bit Error Rate (MBER) types of
receivers [202,661] may also be employed, which are capable of supporting up to twice the number of
users in comparison with the classic MMSE MUD.

Non-coherent Multiple-Symbol Detection in Cooperative
OFDM Systems
The novel aspects of the cooperative OFDM systems investigated may be summarized as follows:
• A Priori LLR-Threshold-Assisted MSDSD in Channel-Coded Cooperative Systems: In
Chapter 10 the ALT scheme was proposed for the coherent SD-aided non-cooperative MIMO-
OFDM system in order to achieve the required complexity reduction. Similar ideas can be
employed in the non-coherent SD-aided cooperative system for further reducing the complexity
imposed.
• DSTBC/DSFBC-SP-Aided Cooperative Systems: DSTBC/DSFBC schemes can be employed
in the MSDSD-aided cooperative OFDM system in order to improve the attainable transmission
efﬁciency further. Moreover, the sphere-packing scheme of Chapter 11 can also be employed
jointly to design the ST signals transmitted from distributed multiple antennas for further
improving the achievable performance.

• Resource Allocation for Channel-Coded Near-Capacity Differential Cooperative Systems:
Given the importance of resource allocation in the uncoded differential cooperative system of
Chapter 13, it is worthwhile investigating cooperative resource allocation schemes designed for
the channel-coded differentially encoded cooperative systems.
• Successive Relaying-Aided Differential Cooperative Systems: As revealed in Chapter 14,
the single-relay-assisted DDF cooperative system does not guarantee a superior performance
in comparison with that achieved by the conventional direct-transmission-based system, owing
to the signiﬁcant multiplexing loss inherent in the half-duplex relaying mechanism. In order to
recover this multiplexing loss, a successive relaying cooperative protocol may be introduced in
the differentially modulated cooperative system.
• Interference-Limited Multi-user Differential Cooperative Systems: In this treatise we
considered a single-source differentially encoded cooperative system in order to investigate the
achievable diversity gains. However, it is worth investigating how to improve the fundamental
trade-offs between the achievable multi-path diversity gain and multiplexing gain in the context
of interference-limited multi-user scenarios relying on half-duplex relay networks.

Semi-Analytical Wireless System Model
The family of state-of-the-art communication systems invokes a conglomerate of complex mathematical
algorithms. The analytical expressions describing the behaviour of these algorithms are often hard to
derive. Correspondingly, the performance of complex systems is typically evaluated using extensive
software simulations. Unfortunately, however, the multiplicity of effects imposed by the different

phenomena in the complex systems considered tends to obscure the important trends and trade-offs
which have to be considered in the process of system design and optimization.
Consequently, we propose a semi-analytic methodology which facilitates the prediction of the
performance achievable by a system characterized by a speciﬁc ensemble of system and channel
parameters.
The proposed semi-analytical technique attempts to dissect the complex problem of system
performance analysis into a set of factors originating from different aspects of both the channel and
the waveform characteristics, thus exposing the various trends and trade-offs inherent in the design of
an efﬁcient wireless mobile smart-antenna-aided multi-carrier communication system.
Let us consider the system analysis methodology characterized in the stylized illustration of
Figure 18.8, where we identify two sets of parameters which characterize our system. Firstly, on the
left of the ﬁgure we have a set of channel parameters, which comprise the Doppler frequency fD,
the RMS delay spread τrms, the angular spread σ2
a as well as the AWGN variance σ2
w. Additionally,
we have to consider the statistical distribution of the CIR taps-related fading coefﬁcients. Secondly, for
each channel-related parameter, we have the corresponding waveform parameter, as seen on the right of
Figure 18.8. That is, we have the bit interleaver depth T, the signal bandwidth B, the numbers mt and nr
of transmit and receive antennas as well as the SNR γ. Additionally, we have the statistical distribution
of the energy associated with the transmitted symbols, which is determined by the particular coding,
spreading and modulation scheme. Some examples of the possible symbol–power distributions include
the constant power in the case of a PSK modulation, the quantized multi-level uniform distribution in
the case of M-QAM as well as the near-Rayleigh power distribution in the cases of CDMA and OFDM.
Consequently, our aim is to derive a set of semi-analytical expressions which would describe the
interdependencies between the aforementioned system parameters and a set of criteria characterizing
the performance of the mobile wireless communication system considered. Speciﬁcally, we choose
four major performance criteria, which form the performance metric depicted in Figure 18.8, namely
the BER, complexity, throughput and latency.

18.2.5. Semi-Analytical Wireless System Model
595
We have completed a feasibility study and our preliminary results suggest that a semi-analytical
model may be devised for characterizing the various phenomena, which is capable of accounting for the
majority of the effects featuring in Figures 18.9–18.14, which determine the performance of a complex
mobile wireless communication system. Some examples of these aspects, which may be taken into
account in a corresponding model, include:
• Modulation scheme, e.g. 4-, 16-, 64-QAM (Figures 18.9 and 18.12).
• Coding scheme, e.g. block, convolutional, turbo code with a given number of decoding iterations
(Figure 18.11).
• MIMO system dimensions, i.e. number of transmit and receive antennas (Figure 18.12).
• Multi-user environment, i.e. number of coherent and non-coherent users (Figures 18.12 and
18.13).
• Channel correlation properties, i.e. Doppler frequency, delay spread (Figure 18.10).
• MIMO detection complexity (Figures 18.13 and 18.14).
• Imperfect channel estimation (Figure 18.15).

A Brief Introduction to Genetic Algorithms
The GAs [328,453–456] were ﬁrst introduced by Holland [453] during the 1960s. Since then, a growing
interest in GAs has resulted in a rapid development in this area [328, 662, 663], since GAs have been
shown to perform well in numerous robust global search and optimization problems, which may not be
conveniently be solved by using traditional search methods.
In this section, we will brieﬂy introduce the GAs in the context of multi-user SDMA-OFDM
systems, in order to offer a better understanding of our proposed GA-based MUD of Chapter 5.
Figure A.1 shows a ﬂowchart of the GA MUD employed in our multi-user SDMA-OFDM system,
while the actions of the GA-based search procedure during one generation are detailed in Figure A.2.
Both of these ﬁgures will be referred to during our further discourse in this section.
Population Initialization. At the beginning of the GA-based search, an initial population consisting of
X so-called individuals is created, each representing a possible solution of the optimization problem
considered, either on a random basis or with the aid of a priori knowledge concerning the optimum
solution. In the context of the SDMA-OFDM MUD, an individual is represented by a symbol vector
containing L complex symbols, each of which belongs to one of the L users at the speciﬁc subcarrier
considered. More speciﬁcally, the xth individual of the yth generation is expressed as
˜s(y,x) = [˜s(1)
(y,x), ˜s(2)
(y,x), . . . , ˜s(L)
(y,x)],
x = 1, . . . , X, y = 1, . . . , Y,
(A.1)
where ˜s(l)
(y,x) ∈Mc denotes the lth (l = 1, . . . , L) gene of the xth individual, while Mc is the set
containing the 2m legitimate constellation symbols. For example, if the 4-QAM modem constellation
given in Figure A.3 is used, each gene ˜s(l)
(y,x) of an individual illustrated in Figure A.4 can be represented
by the indices of the 4-QAM constellation symbols, namely ˜s(l)
(y,x)
.= {1, . . . , 4}. For example, given
L = 6 users, each employing 4-QAM, the composite multi-user signal of each OFDM subcarrier may
assume 46 = 4096 possible symbol combinations. In this case the ML-aided MUD would have to ﬁnd
the most likely combination by invoking a full search of all the 4096 metric evaluations. By contrast, the
GA-aided MUD typically ﬁnds this optimum solution by searching only a fraction of this search space.
The population consisting of X individuals then forms the starting point of the optimization process,
which is referred to as the y = 1st generation, as depicted in Figure A.2.
Fitness Value Evaluation. The GA’s task is to ﬁnd an individual which is considered optimum or
near optimum in terms of minimizing the joint metric of Equation (5.6), which is based on the

Objective Function (OF) given in Equation (5.3) in the context of a P-antenna SDMA-OFDM system.
More explicitly, for each individual, an associated Objective Score (OS) can be derived by evaluating
Equation (5.6). The OS is then converted to a corresponding ﬁtness value, which indicates the ﬁtness of
the speciﬁc individual. This ﬁtness calculation is carried out in the ‘Fitness Value Evaluation’ block of
Figure A.1.
Mating Pool Creation. Based on the ﬁtness values, T individuals that have the highest ﬁtness values
may be selected for creating the so-called mating pool, as shown in Figure A.2. However, for the
SDMA-OFDM system, a better strategy for creating the mating pool is to follow the principle of
Pareto-Optimality [328]. This strategy favours the so-called non-dominated individuals and ignores
the so-called dominated individuals [38]. More speciﬁcally, the uth L-symbol individual is considered
to be dominated by the vth individual, if we have [465]
∀i ∈{1, . . . , P } : Ωi(˜s(y,v)) ≤Ωi(˜s(y,u))
∧∃j ∈{1, . . . , P} : Ωj(˜s(y,v)) < Ωj(˜s(y,u)),
(A.2)
where Ωp(·) is the OF associated with the pth receiver antenna element, which is deﬁned by
Equation (5.3). If an individual is not dominated in the sense of Equation (A.2) by any other individuals

in the population, then it is considered to be non-dominated. All the non-dominated individuals are then
selected and placed in the mating pool, which will have a size of 2 < T ≤X [38].
Selection. In order to evolve the population throughout the consecutive generations, the individuals in
the mating pool are then selected as parents for producing offspring. The selection process is based on
the so-called ﬁtness-proportionate algorithm employed by the ‘Fitness-proportionate Selection’ block
of Figure A.1, which is widely used in the literature [664]. According to ﬁtness-proportionate selection,
each of the T individuals in the mating pool is ﬁrst assigned a selection probability proportionate to
its ﬁtness value. More precisely, the individuals having higher ﬁtness values will be assigned higher
selection probabilities, based on which X/2 pairs of parents are selected, as illustrated in Figure A.2.
Moreover, during the selection process the so-called incest prevention [665] technique can be invoked,
which requires that the two individuals selected to form a pair of parents are different. This can
effectively prevent the GA from premature convergence.
Cross-over. For each pair of the X/2 selected parents, a genetic operation referred to as cross-
over [454] is invoked, as shown in Figure A.2. The cross-over operation is a process during which

some of the genes of a parent are exchanged with those of the other parent, thus creating two offspring.
In our proposed GA MUD, the well-known uniform cross-over [666] scheme corresponding to the
‘Uniform Cross-over’ block of Figure A.1 is employed, as illustrated in Figure A.5. Suppose we have
L = 6 users; hence each individual will have six genes accordingly, as portrayed in Figure A.5. Two
individuals are then selected as parents from the mating pool, followed by the creation of a binary
cross-over mask, which contains L = 6 randomly generated ones and zeros. The genes, represented for
example by the indices of the 4-QAM constellation symbols given in Figure A.3, are then exchanged
between the selected pair of parents at positions associated with a one in the cross-over mask, giving
birth to two offspring.
Mutation. After the cross-over operation is applied to each pair of parents, X offspring are produced,
which are then subjected to the so-called mutation [454] operation and some of the offspring’s genes
may be changed. More speciﬁcally, any gene of an offspring may be mutated to another legitimate gene
under the control of the speciﬁc mutation strategy employed. Furthermore, activation of the mutation
process is governed by the so-called mutation probability pm. An example of the mutation procedure
following the cross-over operation of Figure A.5 is plotted in Figure A.6. Therefore, following the
cross-over and mutation blocks illustrated in Figure A.1, the new population consists of X mutated
offspring. It is worth pointing out that the mutation operation is critical to the success of the genetic
evolution, since it ensures that sufﬁcient diversity is maintained in the population, thus preventing the
GA’s search from being trapped at local optima.
Elitism. While the cross-over and mutation operations offer the opportunity to improve the average
ﬁtness of the population, they do not guarantee that each of the offspring is better than their parents
in terms of their ﬁtness values. In other words, the better individuals associated with the higher ﬁtness
values found in the yth generation may not be retained in the (y + 1)th generation. To ensure that
the high-ﬁtness individuals are not lost from generation to generation, the best or a few of the best
individuals of the parent population are copied into the new population, replacing the worst offspring.
This technique is known as elitism [454], as illustrated in Figures A.1 and A.2.
The genetic operation cycle mentioned above forms the basis of the GA-aided optimization,
yielding an offspring population having an improved average ﬁtness. This evolution continues until
the generation index reaches its maximum. Then the operation of the GA is terminated and the

highest-ﬁtness individual of the last population will be considered as the ﬁnal solution, which is the
speciﬁc length-L symbol vector that contains the detected transmitted symbols of the L users at the
speciﬁc OFDM subcarrier considered. If the population size X and/or the number of generations Y is
sufﬁciently high, the GA’s ﬁnal solution approaches the optimum [38].
