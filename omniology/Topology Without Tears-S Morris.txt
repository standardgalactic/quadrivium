Introduction
Topology is an important and interesting area of mathematics, the study of
which will not only introduce you to new concepts and theorems but also put
into context old ones like continuous functions. However, to say just this is to
understate the signiﬁcance of topology. It is so fundamental that its inﬂuence
is evident in almost every other branch of mathematics. This makes the study
of topology relevant to all who aspire to be mathematicians whether their
ﬁrst love is (or will be) algebra, analysis, category theory, chaos, continuum
mechanics, dynamics, geometry, industrial mathematics, mathematical biology,
mathematical
economics,
mathematical
ﬁnance,
mathematical
modelling,
mathematical
physics,
mathematics
of
communication,
number
theory,
numerical mathematics, operations research or statistics. Topological notions
like compactness, connectedness and denseness are as basic to mathematicians
of today as sets and functions were to those of last century.
Topology has several diﬀerent branches — general topology (also known
as point-set topology), algebraic topology, diﬀerential topology and topological
algebra — the ﬁrst, general topology, being the door to the study of the others.
We aim in this book to provide a thorough grounding in general topology.
Anyone who conscientiously studies about the ﬁrst ten chapters and solves at
least half of the exercises will certainly have such a grounding.
For the reader who has not previously studied an axiomatic branch of
mathematics such as abstract algebra, learning to write proofs will be a hurdle.
To assist you to learn how to write proofs, quite often in the early chapters, we
include an aside which does not form part of the proof but outlines the thought
process which led to the proof. Asides are indicated in the following manner:
In order to arrive at the proof, we went through this thought process,
which might well be called the “discovery” or “experiment phase”.
However, the reader will learn that while discovery or experimentation
is often essential, nothing can replace a formal proof.

INTRODUCTION
There are many exercises in this book.
Only by working through a good
number of exercises will you master this course.
Very often we include new
concepts in the exercises; the concepts which we consider most important will
generally be introduced again in the text.
Harder exercises are indicated by an *.

Chapter 1
Topological Spaces
Introduction
Tennis, football, baseball and hockey may all be exciting games but to play
them you must ﬁrst learn (some of) the rules of the game. Mathematics is no
diﬀerent. So we begin with the rules for topology.
This chapter opens with the deﬁnition of a topology and is then devoted
to some simple examples: ﬁnite topological spaces, discrete spaces, indiscrete
spaces, and spaces with the ﬁnite-closed topology.
Topology, like other branches of pure mathematics such as group theory, is
an axiomatic subject. We start with a set of axioms and we use these axioms
to prove propositions and theorems. It is extremely important to develop your
skill at writing proofs.
Why are proofs so important?
Suppose our task were to construct a
building.
We would start with the foundations.
In our case these are the
axioms or deﬁnitions – everything else is built upon them.
Each theorem or
proposition represents a new level of knowledge and must be ﬁrmly anchored to
the previous level. We attach the new level to the previous one using a proof.
So the theorems and propositions are the new heights of knowledge we achieve,
while the proofs are essential as they are the mortar which attaches them to
the level below. Without proofs the structure would collapse.
So what is a mathematical proof?
A mathematical proof is a watertight
argument which begins with information you are given, proceeds by logical
argument, and ends with what you are asked to prove.

CHAPTER 1.
TOPOLOGICAL SPACES
You should begin a proof by writing down the information you are given
and then state what you are asked to prove. If the information you are given or
what you are required to prove contains technical terms, then you should write
down the deﬁnitions of those technical terms.
Every proof should consist of complete sentences. Each of these sentences
should be a consequence of (i) what has been stated previously or (ii) a theorem,
proposition or lemma that has already been proved.
In this book you will see many proofs, but note that mathematics is not a
spectator sport. It is a game for participants. The only way to learn to write
proofs is to try to write them yourself.
1.1
Topology
1.1.1
Deﬁnitions.
Let X be a non-empty set. A collection τ of
subsets of X is said to be a topology on X if
(i) X and the empty set, Ø, belong to τ ,
(ii) the union of any (ﬁnite or inﬁnite) number of sets in τ belongs to τ ,
and
(iii) the intersection of any two sets in τ belongs to τ .
The pair (X,τ ) is called a topological space.
1.1.2
Example.
Let X = {a, b, c, d, e, f} and
τ 1 = {X, Ø, {a}, {c, d}, {a, c, d}, {b, c, d, e, f}}.
Then τ 1 is a topology on X as it satisﬁes conditions (i), (ii) and (iii) of
Deﬁnitions 1.1.1.
1.1.3
Example.
Let X = {a, b, c, d, e} and
τ 2 = {X, Ø, {a}, {c, d}, {a, c, e}, {b, c, d}}.
Then τ 2 is not a topology on X as the union
{c, d} ∪{a, c, e} = {a, c, d, e}
of two members of τ 2 does not belong to τ 2 ; that is, τ 2 does not satisfy
condition (ii) of Deﬁnitions 1.1.1.

1.1.4
Example.
Let X = {a, b, c, d, e, f} and
τ 3 = {X, Ø, {a}, {f}, {a, f}, {a, c, f}, {b, c, d, e, f}}.
Then τ 3 is not a topology on X since the intersection
{a, c, f} ∩{b, c, d, e, f} = {c, f}
of two sets in τ 3 does not belong to τ 3 ; that is, τ 3 does not have property (iii)
of Deﬁnitions 1.1.1.
1.1.5
Example.
Let N be the set of all natural numbers (that is, the
set of all positive integers) and let τ 4 consist of N, Ø, and all ﬁnite subsets of
N. Then τ 4 is not a topology on N, since the inﬁnite union
{2} ∪{3} ∪· · · ∪{n} ∪· · · = {2, 3, . . ., n, . . . }
of members of τ 4 does not belong to τ 4 ; that is, τ 4 does not have property
(ii) of Deﬁnitions 1.1.1.
1.1.6
Deﬁnitions.
Let X be any non-empty set and let τ be the
collection of all subsets of X. Then τ is called the discrete topology on the
set X. The topological space (X,τ ) is called a discrete space.
We note that τ in Deﬁnitions 1.1.6 does satisfy the conditions of Deﬁnitions
1.1.1 and so is indeed a topology.
Observe that the set X in Deﬁnitions 1.1.6 can be any non-empty set. So
there is an inﬁnite number of discrete spaces – one for each set X.
1.1.7
Deﬁnitions.
Let X be any non-empty set and τ = {X, Ø}.
Then τ
is called the indiscrete topology and (X,τ ) is said to be an
indiscrete space.
Once again we have to check that τ satisﬁes the conditions of Deﬁnitions
1.1.1 and so is indeed a topology.
We observe again that the set X in Deﬁnitions 1.1.7 can be any non-empty
set. So there is an inﬁnite number of indiscrete spaces – one for each set X.

CHAPTER 1.
TOPOLOGICAL SPACES
In the introduction to this chapter we discussed the
importance of proofs and what is involved in writing
them.
Our ﬁrst experience with proofs is in Example
1.1.8 and Proposition 1.1.9.
You should study these
proofs carefully.
1.1.8
Example.
If X = {a, b, c} and τ is a topology on X with {a} ∈τ ,
{b} ∈τ , and {c} ∈τ , prove that τ is the discrete topology.
Proof.
We are given that τ is a topology and that {a} ∈τ , {b} ∈τ , and {c} ∈τ .
We are required to prove that τ is the discrete topology; that is, we
are required to prove (by Deﬁnitions 1.1.6) that τ contains all subsets
of X. Remember that τ is a topology and so satisﬁes conditions (i),
(ii) and (iii) of Deﬁnitions 1.1.1.
So we shall begin our proof by writing down all of the subsets of X.
The set X has 3 elements and so it has 23 distinct subsets. They are: S1 = Ø,
S2 = {a}, S3 = {b}, S4 = {c}, S5 = {a, b}, S6 = {a, c}, S7 = {b, c}, and S8 = {a, b, c} = X.
We are required to prove that each of these subsets is in τ .
As τ is a
topology, Deﬁnitions 1.1.1 (i) implies that X and Ø are in τ ; that is, S1 ∈τ
and S8 ∈τ .
We are given that {a} ∈τ , {b} ∈τ and {c} ∈τ ; that is, S2 ∈τ , S3 ∈τ and
S4 ∈τ .
To complete the proof we need to show that S5 ∈τ , S6 ∈τ , and S7 ∈τ .
But S5 = {a, b} = {a} ∪{b}. As we are given that {a} and {b} are in τ , Deﬁnitions
1.1.1 (ii) implies that their union is also in τ ; that is, S5 = {a, b} ∈τ .
Similarly
S6 = {a, c} = {a} ∪{c} ∈τ
and
S7 = {b, c} = {b} ∪{c} ∈τ .

In the introductory comments on this chapter we observed that mathematics
is not a spectator sport.
You should be an active participant.
Of course
your participation includes doing some of the exercises. But more than this is
expected of you. You have to think about the material presented to you.
One of your tasks is to look at the results that we prove and to ask pertinent
questions. For example, we have just shown that if each of the singleton sets
{a}, {b} and {c} is in τ and X = {a, b, c}, then τ is the discrete topology.
You
should ask if this is but one example of a more general phenomenon; that is,
if (X,τ ) is any topological space such that τ contains every singleton set, is τ
necessarily the discrete topology?
The answer is “yes”, and this is proved in
Proposition 1.1.9.

CHAPTER 1.
TOPOLOGICAL SPACES
1.1.9
Proposition.
If (X,τ ) is a topological space such that, for
every x ∈X, the singleton set {x} is in τ , then τ is the discrete topology.
Proof.
This result is a generalization of Example 1.1.8. Thus you might expect
that the proof would be similar.
However, we cannot list all of the
subsets of X as we did in Example 1.1.8 because X may be an inﬁnite
set. Nevertheless we must prove that every subset of X is in τ .
At this point you may be tempted to prove the result for some special
cases, for example taking X to consist of 4, 5 or even 100 elements.
But this approach is doomed to failure. Recall our opening comments
in this chapter where we described a mathematical proof as a watertight
argument. We cannot produce a watertight argument by considering
a few special cases, or even a very large number of special cases. The
watertight argument must cover all cases. So we must consider the
general case of an arbitrary non-empty set X. Somehow we must prove
that every subset of X is in τ .
Looking again at the proof of Example 1.1.8 we see that the key
is that every subset of X is a union of singleton subsets of X and we
already know that all of the singleton subsets are in τ .
This is also
true in the general case.
We begin the proof by recording the fact that every set is a union of its
singleton subsets. Let S be any subset of X. Then
S =

x∈S
{x}.
Since we are given that each {x} is in τ , Deﬁnitions 1.1.1 (ii) and the above
equation imply that S ∈τ . As S is an arbitrary subset of X, we have that τ is
the discrete topology.
That every set S is a union of its singleton subsets is a result which we shall
use from time to time throughout the book in many diﬀerent contexts. Note
that it holds even when S = Ø as then we form what is called an empty union
and get Ø as the result.

(x) τ 10 consists of R, Ø, every interval [−n, n], and every interval (−r, r), for
n any positive integer and r any positive real number.
1.2
Open Sets, Closed Sets, and Clopen Sets
Rather than continually refer to “members of τ ”, we ﬁnd it more convenient
to give such sets a name.
We call them “open sets”.
We shall also name
the complements of open sets.
They will be called “closed sets”.
This
nomenclature is not ideal, but derives from the so-called “open intervals” and
“closed intervals” on the real number line. We shall have more to say about
this in Chapter 2.
1.2.1
Deﬁnition.
Let (X,τ ) be any topological space. Then the
members of τ are said to be open sets.
1.2.2
Proposition.
If (X,τ ) is any topological space, then
(i) X and Ø are open sets,
(ii) the union of any (ﬁnite or inﬁnite) number of open sets is an open set
and
(iii) the intersection of any ﬁnite number of open sets is an open set.
Proof.
Clearly (i) and (ii) are trivial consequences of Deﬁnition 1.2.1 and
Deﬁnitions 1.1.1 (i) and (ii). The condition (iii) follows from Deﬁnition 1.2.1
and Exercises 1.1 #4.
On reading Proposition 1.2.2, a question should have popped into your
mind: while any ﬁnite or inﬁnite union of open sets is open, we state only that
ﬁnite intersections of open sets are open.
Are inﬁnite intersections of open
sets always open? The next example shows that the answer is “no”.

10
CHAPTER 1.
TOPOLOGICAL SPACES
1.2.3
Example.
Let N be the set of all positive integers and let τ
consist of Ø and each subset S of N such that the complement of S in N, N \ S,
is a ﬁnite set. It is easily veriﬁed that τ satisﬁes Deﬁnitions 1.1.1 and so is a
topology on N. (In the next section we shall discuss this topology further. It is
called the ﬁnite-closed topology.) For each natural number n, deﬁne the set Sn
as follows:
Sn = {1} ∪{n + 1} ∪{n + 2} ∪{n + 3} ∪· · · = {1} ∪
∞

m=n+1
{m}.
Clearly each Sn is an open set in the topology τ , since its complement is a ﬁnite
set. However,
∞

n=1
Sn = {1}.
(1)
As the complement of {1} is neither N nor a ﬁnite set, {1} is not open. So (1)
shows that the intersection of the open sets Sn is not open.
You might well ask: how did you ﬁnd the example presented in Example
1.2.3? The answer is unglamorous! It was by trial and error.
If we tried, for example, a discrete topology, we would ﬁnd that each
intersection of open sets is indeed open.
The same is true of the indiscrete
topology. So what you need to do is some intelligent guesswork.
Remember that to prove that the intersection of open sets is not necessarily
open, you need to ﬁnd just one counterexample!
1.2.4
Deﬁnition.
Let (X,τ ) be a topological space. A subset S of
X is said to be a closed set in (X,τ ) if its complement in X, namely X \ S,
is open in (X,τ ).
In Example 1.1.2, the closed sets are
Ø, X, {b, c, d, e, f}, {a, b, e, f}, {b, e, f} and {a}.
If (X,τ ) is a discrete space, then it is obvious that every subset of X is a closed
set. However in an indiscrete space, (X,τ ), the only closed sets are X and Ø.

1.2.
OPEN SETS
11
1.2.5
Proposition.
If (X,τ ) is any topological space, then
(i) Ø and X are closed sets,
(ii) the intersection of any (ﬁnite or inﬁnite) number of closed sets is a
closed set and
(iii) the union of any ﬁnite number of closed sets is a closed set.
Proof.
(i) follows immediately from Proposition 1.2.2 (i) and Deﬁnition
1.2.4, as the complement of X is Ø and the complement of Ø is X.
To prove that (iii) is true, let S1, S2, . . . , Sn be closed sets. We are required
to prove that S1 ∪S2 ∪· · · ∪Sn is a closed set. It suﬃces to show, by Deﬁnition
1.2.4, that X \ (S1 ∪S2 ∪· · · ∪Sn) is an open set.
As S1, S2, . . . , Sn are closed sets, their complements X \ S1, X \ S2, . . . , X \ Sn
are open sets. But
X \ (S1 ∪S2 ∪· · · ∪Sn) = (X \ S1) ∩(X \ S2) ∩· · · ∩(X \ Sn).
(1)
As the right hand side of (1) is a ﬁnite intersection of open sets, it is an
open set. So the left hand side of (1) is an open set. Hence S1 ∪S2 ∪· · · ∪Sn is
a closed set, as required. So (iii) is true.
The proof of (ii) is similar to that of (iii). [However, you should read the
warning in the proof of Example 1.3.9.]
Warning.
The names “open” and “closed” often lead newcomers to the
world of topology into error. Despite the names, some open sets are also closed
sets! Moreover, some sets are neither open sets nor closed sets! Indeed, if we
consider Example 1.1.2 we see that
(i) the set {a} is both open and closed;
(ii) the set {b, c} is neither open nor closed;
(iii) the set {c, d} is open but not closed;
(iv) the set {a, b, e, f} is closed but not open.
In a discrete space every set is both open and closed, while in an indiscrete
space (X,τ ), all subsets of X except X and Ø are neither open nor closed.

12
CHAPTER 1.
TOPOLOGICAL SPACES
To remind you that sets can be both open and closed we introduce the
following deﬁnition.
1.2.6
Deﬁnition.
A subset S of a topological space (X,τ ) is said
to be clopen if it is both open and closed in (X,τ ).
In every topological space (X,τ ) both X and Ø are clopen1.
In a discrete space all subsets of X are clopen.
In an indiscrete space the only clopen subsets are X and Ø.
Exercises 1.2
1.
List all 64 subsets of the set X in Example 1.1.2.
Write down, next to
each set, whether it is (i) clopen; (ii) neither open nor closed; (iii) open
but not closed; (iv) closed but not open.
2.
Let (X,τ ) be a topological space with the property that every subset is
closed. Prove that it is a discrete space.
3.
Observe that if (X,τ ) is a discrete space or an indiscrete space,then every
open set is a clopen set. Find a topology τ on the set X = {a, b, c, d} which
is not discrete and is not indiscrete but has the property that every open
set is clopen.
4.
Let X be an inﬁnite set. If τ is a topology on X such that every inﬁnite
subset of X is closed, prove that τ is the discrete topology.
5.
Let X be an inﬁnite set and τ a topology on X with the property that the
only inﬁnite subset of X which is open is X itself. Is (X,τ ) necessarily an
indiscrete space?
1We admit that “clopen” is an ugly word but its use is now widespread.

1.3.
FINITE-CLOSED TOPOLOGY
13
6.
(i)
Let τ be a topology on a set X such that τ consists of precisely four
sets; that is, τ = {X, Ø, A, B}, where A and B are non-empty distinct
proper subsets of X. [A is a proper subset of X means that A ⊆X and
A ̸= X. This is denoted by A ⊂X.] Prove that A and B must satisfy
exactly one of the following conditions:
(a) B = X \ A;
(b) A ⊂B;
(c) B ⊂A.
[Hint.
Firstly show that A and B must satisfy at least one of the
conditions and then show that they cannot satisfy more than one of
the conditions.]
(ii) Using (i) list all topologies on X = {1, 2, 3, 4} which consist of exactly
four sets.
1.3
The Finite-Closed Topology
It is usual to deﬁne a topology on a set by stating which sets are open. However,
sometimes it is more natural to describe the topology by saying which sets are
closed. The next deﬁnition provides one such example.
1.3.1
Deﬁnition.
Let X be any non-empty set. A topology τ on
X is called the ﬁnite-closed topology or the coﬁnite topology if the closed
subsets of X are X and all ﬁnite subsets of X; that is, the open sets are Ø
and all subsets of X which have ﬁnite complements.
Once again it is necessary to check that τ in Deﬁnition 1.3.1 is indeed a
topology; that is, that it satisﬁes each of the conditions of Deﬁnitions 1.1.1.
Note that Deﬁnition 1.3.1 does not say that every topology which has X
and the ﬁnite subsets of X closed is the ﬁnite-closed topology. These must be
the only closed sets. [Of course, in the discrete topology on any set X, the set
X and all ﬁnite subsets of X are indeed closed, but so too are all other subsets
of X.]
In the ﬁnite-closed topology all ﬁnite sets are closed. However, the following
example shows that inﬁnite subsets need not be open sets.

Example.
If N is the set of all positive integers, then sets such as
{1}, {5, 6, 7}, {2, 4, 6, 8} are ﬁnite and hence closed in the ﬁnite-closed topology.
Thus their complements
{2, 3, 4, 5, . . .}, {1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, . . .}, {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, . . .}
are open sets in the ﬁnite-closed topology.
On the other hand, the set of
even positive integers is not a closed set since it is not ﬁnite and hence its
complement, the set of odd positive integers, is not an open set in the ﬁnite-
closed topology.
So while all ﬁnite sets are closed, not all inﬁnite sets are open.
1.3.3
Example.
Let τ be the ﬁnite-closed topology on a set X. If X
has at least 3 distinct clopen subsets, prove that X is a ﬁnite set.
Proof.
We are given that τ is the ﬁnite-closed topology, and that there are at
least 3 distinct clopen subsets.
We are required to prove that X is a ﬁnite set.
Recall that τ is the ﬁnite-closed topology means that the family of
all closed sets consists of X and all ﬁnite subsets of X. Recall also that
a set is clopen if and only if it is both closed and open.
Remember that in every topological space there are at least 2 clopen
sets, namely X and Ø.
(See the comment immediately following
Deﬁnition 1.2.6.) But we are told that in the space (X,τ ) there are at
least 3 clopen subsets. This implies that there is a clopen subset other
than Ø and X. So we shall have a careful look at this other clopen set!
As our space (X,τ ) has 3 distinct clopen subsets, we know that there is
a clopen subset S of X such that S ̸= X and S ̸= Ø. As S is open in (X,τ ),
Deﬁnition 1.2.4 implies that its complement X \ S is a closed set.
Thus S and X \ S are closed in the ﬁnite-closed topology τ . Therefore S
and X \ S are both ﬁnite, since neither equals X. But X = S ∪(X \ S) and so X
is the union of two ﬁnite sets. Thus X is a ﬁnite set, as required.

1.3.
FINITE-CLOSED TOPOLOGY
15
We now know three distinct topologies we can put on any inﬁnite set –
and there are many more. The three we know are the discrete topology, the
indiscrete topology, and the ﬁnite-closed topology. So we must be careful always
to specify the topology on a set.
For example, the set {n : n ≥10} is open in the ﬁnite-closed topology on
the set of natural numbers, but is not open in the indiscrete topology. The set
of odd natural numbers is open in the discrete topology on the set of natural
numbers, but is not open in the ﬁnite-closed topology.
We shall now record some deﬁnitions which you have probably met before.
1.3.4
Deﬁnitions.
Let f be a function from a set X into a set Y .
(i) The function f is said to be one-to-one or injective if f(x1) = f(x2)
implies x1 = x2, for x1, x2 ∈X;
(ii) The function f is said to be onto or surjective if for each y ∈Y there
exists an x ∈X such that f(x) = y;
(iii) The function f is said to be bijective if it is both one-to-one and onto.
1.3.5
Deﬁnitions.
Let f be a function from a set X into a set Y .
The function f is said to have an inverse if there exists a function g of Y
into X such that g(f(x)) = x, for all x ∈X and f(g(y)) = y, for all y ∈Y . The
function g is called an inverse function of f.
The proof of the following proposition is left as an exercise for you.
1.3.6
Proposition.
Let f be a function from a set X into a set Y .
(i) The function f has an inverse if and only if f is bijective.
(ii) Let g1 and g2 be functions from Y into X. If g1 and g2 are both inverse
functions of f, then g1 = g2; that is, g1(y) = g2(y), for all y ∈Y .
(iii) Let g be a function from Y into X. Then g is an inverse function of f
if and only if f is an inverse function of g.

16
CHAPTER 1.
TOPOLOGICAL SPACES
Warning.
It is a very common error for students to think that a function is
one-to-one if “it maps one point to one point”.
All functions map one point to one point. Indeed this is part of the deﬁnition
of a function.
A one-to-one function is a function that maps diﬀerent points to diﬀerent
points.
We now turn to a very important notion that you may not have met before.
1.3.7
Deﬁnition.
Let f be a function from a set X into a set Y .
If S is any subset of Y , then the set f −1(S) is deﬁned by
f −1(S) = {x : x ∈X and f(x) ∈S}.
The subset f −1(S) of X is said to be the inverse image of S.
Note that an inverse function of f : X →Y exists if and only if f is bijective.
But the inverse image of any subset of Y exists even if f is neither one-to-one
nor onto. The next example demonstrates this.
1.3.8
Example.
Let f be the function from the set of integers, Z, into
itself given by f(z) = |z|, for each z ∈Z.
The function f is not one-to one, since f(1) = f(−1).
It is also not onto, since there is no z ∈Z, such that f(z) = −1.
So f is
certainly not bijective.
Hence, by Proposition 1.3.6 (i), f does not have an
inverse function. However inverse images certainly exist. For example,
f −1({1, 2, 3}) = {−1, −2, −3, 1, 2, 3}
f −1({−5, 3, 5, 7, 9}) = {−3, −5, −7, −9, 3, 5, 7, 9}.
□
We conclude this section with an interesting example.

1.3.
FINITE-CLOSED TOPOLOGY

1.3.9
Example.
Let (Y,τ ) be a topological space and X a non-empty
set. Further, let f be a function from X into Y . Put τ 1 = {f −1(S) : S ∈τ }. Prove
that τ 1 is a topology on X.
Proof.
Our task is to show that the collection of sets, τ 1, is a topology on X;
that is, we have to show that τ 1 satisﬁes conditions (i), (ii) and (iii)
of Deﬁnitions 1.1.1.
X ∈τ 1
since
X = f −1(Y )
and
Y ∈τ .
Ø ∈τ 1
since
Ø = f −1(Ø)
and
Ø ∈τ .
Therefore τ 1 has property (i) of Deﬁnitions 1.1.1.
To verify condition (ii) of Deﬁnitions 1.1.1, let {Aj : j ∈J} be a collection
of members of τ 1 , for some index set J. We have to show that 
j∈J Aj ∈τ 1.
As Aj ∈τ 1, the deﬁnition of τ 1 implies that Aj = f −1(Bj), where Bj ∈τ . Also

j∈J Aj = 
j∈J f −1(Bj) = f −1 
j∈J Bj

. [See Exercises 1.3 # 1.]
Now Bj ∈τ , for all j ∈J, and so 
j∈J Bj ∈τ , since τ is a topology on Y .
Therefore, by the deﬁnition of τ 1, f −1 
j∈J Bj

∈τ 1; that is, 
j∈J Aj ∈τ 1.
So τ 1 has property (ii) of Deﬁnitions 1.1.1.
[Warning.
You are reminded that not all sets are countable.
(See the
Appendix for comments on countable sets.)
So it would not suﬃce, in the
above argument, to assume that sets A1, A2. . . . , An, . . . are in τ 1 and show that
their union A1 ∪A2 ∪. . . ∪An ∪. . . is in τ 1. This would prove only that the union
of a countable number of sets in τ 1 lies in τ 1, but would not show that τ 1 has
property (ii) of Deﬁnitions 1.1.1 – this property requires all unions, whether
countable or uncountable, of sets in τ 1 to be in τ 1.]
Finally, let A1 and A2 be in τ 1. We have to show that A1 ∩A2 ∈τ 1. As
A1, A2 ∈τ 1, A1 = f −1(B1) and A2 = f −1(B2), where B1, B2 ∈τ .
A1 ∩A2 = f −1(B1) ∩f −1(B2) = f −1(B1 ∩B2).
[See Exercises 1.3 #1.]
As B1 ∩B2 ∈τ , we have f −1(B1 ∩B2) ∈τ 1. Hence A1 ∩A2 ∈τ 1, and we have shown
that τ 1 also has property (iii) of Deﬁnitions 1.1.1.
So τ 1 is indeed a topology on X.

1.4
Postscript
In this chapter we introduced the fundamental notion of a topological space.
As examples we saw various ﬁnite spaces, as well as discrete spaces, indiscrete
spaces and spaces with the ﬁnite-closed topology. None of these is a particularly
important example as far as applications are concerned. However, in Exercises
4.3 #8, it is noted that every inﬁnite topological space “contains” an inﬁnite
topological space with one of the ﬁve topologies: the indiscrete topology, the
discrete topology, the ﬁnite-closed topology, the initial segment topology, or the
ﬁnal segment topology of Exercises 1.1 #6. In the next chapter we describe
the very important Euclidean topology.
En route we met the terms “open set” and “closed set” and we were warned
that these names can be misleading. Sets can be both open and closed, neither
open nor closed, open but not closed, or closed but not open. It is important
to remember that we cannot prove that a set is open by proving that it is not
closed.
Other than the deﬁnitions of topology, topological space, open set, and
closed set the most signiﬁcant topic covered was that of writing proofs.
In the opening comments of this chapter we pointed out the importance
of learning to write proofs. In Example 1.1.8, Proposition 1.1.9, and Example
1.3.3 we have seen how to “think through” a proof.
It is essential that you
develop your own skill at writing proofs. Good exercises to try for this purpose
include Exercises 1.1 #8, Exercises 1.2 #2,4, and Exercises 1.3 #1,4.
Some students are confused by the notion of topology as it involves “sets
of sets”. To check your understanding, do Exercises 1.1 #3.
The exercises included the notions of T0-space and T1-space which will be
formally introduced later. These are known as separation properties.
Finally we emphasize the importance of inverse images.
These are dealt
with in Example 1.3.9 and Exercises 1.3 #1.
Our deﬁnition of continuous
mapping will rely on inverse images.

Appendix 1: Inﬁnite Sets
Introduction
Once upon a time in a far-oﬀland there were two hotels, the Hotel Finite (an
ordinary hotel with a ﬁnite number of rooms) and Hilbert’s Hotel Inﬁnite (an
extra-ordinary hotel with an inﬁnite number of rooms numbered 1, 2, . . .n, . . . ).
One day a visitor arrived in town seeking a room. She went ﬁrst to the Hotel
Finite and was informed that all rooms were occupied and so she could not be
accommodated, but she was told that the other hotel, Hilbert’s Hotel Inﬁnite,
can always ﬁnd an extra room. So she went to Hilbert’s Hotel Inﬁnite and was
told that there too all rooms were occupied. However, the desk clerk said at
this hotel an extra guest can always be accommodated without evicting anyone.
He moved the guest from room 1 to room 2, the guest from room 2 to room
3, and so on. Room 1 then became vacant!
From this cute example we see that there is an intrinsic diﬀerence between
inﬁnite sets and ﬁnite sets. The aim of this Appendix is to provide a gentle but
very brief introduction to the theory of Inﬁnite Sets. This is a fascinating topic
which, if you have not studied it before, will contain several surprises. We shall
learn that “inﬁnite sets were not created equal” - some are bigger than others.
At ﬁrst pass it is not at all clear what this statement could possibly mean. We
will need to deﬁne the term “bigger”. Indeed we will need to deﬁne what we
mean by “two sets are the same size”.

APPENDIX 1: INFINITE SETS
A1.1
Countable Sets
A1.1.1
Deﬁnitions.
Let A and B be sets. Then A is said to be
equipotent to B, denoted by A ∼B, if there exists a function f : A →B
which is both one-to-one and onto (that is, f is a bijection or a one-to-one
correspondence).
A1.1.2
Proposition.
Let A, B, and C be sets.
(i) Then A ∼A.
(ii) If A ∼B then B ∼A.
(iii) If A ∼B and B ∼C then A ∼C.
Outline Proof.
(i) The identity function f on A, given by f(x) = x, for all x ∈A, is a one-to-one
correspondence between A and itself.
(ii) If f is a bijection of A onto B then it has an inverse function g from B to
A and g is also a one-to-one correspondence.
(iii) If f : A →B is a one-to-one correspondence and g : B →C is a one-to-one
correspondence, then their composition gf : A →C is also a one-to-one
correspondence.
Proposition A1.1.2 says that the relation “∼” is reﬂexive (i), symmetric (ii),
and transitive (iii); that is, “∼” is an equivalence relation.
A1.1.3
Proposition.
Let n, m ∈N. Then the sets {1, 2, . . ., n} and
{1, 2, . . ., m} are equipotent if and only if n = m.
Proof.
Exercise.
□
Now we explicitly deﬁne the terms “ﬁnite set” and “inﬁnite set”.

23
A1.1.4
Deﬁnitions.
Let S be a set.
(i) Then S is said to be ﬁnite if it is the empty set, Ø, or it is equipotent
to {1, 2, . . ., n}, for some n ∈N.
(ii) If S is not ﬁnite, then it is said to be inﬁnite.
(iii) If S ∼{1, 2, . . ., n} then S is said to have cardinality n, which is denoted
by card S = n.
(iv) If S = Ø then the cardinality is said to be 0, which is denoted by
card Ø = 0.
The next step is to deﬁne the “smallest” kind of inﬁnite set. Such sets will
be called countably inﬁnite.
At this stage we do not know that there is any
“bigger” kind of inﬁnite set – indeed we do not even know what “bigger” would
mean in this context.
A1.1.5
Deﬁnitions.
Let S be a set.
(i) The set S is said to be countably inﬁnite (or denumerable) if it is
equipotent to N.
(ii) The set S is said to be countable if it is ﬁnite or countably inﬁnite.
(iii) If S is countably inﬁnite then it is said to have cardinality ℵ0, (or ω),
denoted by card S = ℵ0 (or card S = ω).
(iv) A set S is said to be uncountable if it is not countable.
A1.1.6
Remark.
We see that if the set S is countably inﬁnite, then
S = {s1, s2, . . . , sn, . . . } where f : N →S is a one-to-one correspondence and
sn = f(n), for all n ∈N.
So we can
list
the elements of S.
Of course if S
is ﬁnite and non-empty, we can also list its elements by S = {s1, s2, . . . , sn}. So we
can list the elements of any countable set. Conversely, if the elements of S can
be listed then S is countable as the listing deﬁnes a one-to-one correspondence
with N or {1, 2, . . ., n}.

24
APPENDIX 1: INFINITE SETS
A1.1.7
Example.
The set S of all even positive integers is countably
inﬁnite.
Proof.
The function f : N →S given by f(n) = 2 n, for all n ∈N, is a
one-to-one correspondence.
Example A1.1.7 is worthy of a little contemplation. We think of two sets
being in one-to-one correspondence if they are “the same size”. But here we
have the set N in one-to-one correspondence with one of its proper subsets.
This does not happen with ﬁnite sets. Indeed ﬁnite sets can be characterized
as those sets which are not equipotent to any of their proper subsets.
A1.1.8
Example.
The set Z of all integers is countably inﬁnite.
Proof.
The function f : N →Z given by
f(n) =





m,
if n = 2m, m ≥1
−m,
if n = 2m + 1, m ≥1
0,
if n = 1.
is a one-to-one correspondence.
A1.1.9
Example.
The set S of all positive integers which are perfect
squares is countably inﬁnite.
Proof.
The function f : N →S given by f(n) = n2 is a one-to-one
correspondence.
Example A1.1.9 was proved by G. Galileo about 1600. It troubled him and
suggested to him that the inﬁnite is not man’s domain.
A1.1.10
Proposition.
If a set S is equipotent to a countable set
then it is countable.
Proof.
Exercise.

25
A1.1.11
Proposition.
If S is a countable set and T ⊂S then T is
countable.
Proof.
Since S is countable we can write it as a list S = {s1, s2, . . . } (a ﬁnite
list if S is ﬁnite, an inﬁnite one if S is countably inﬁnite).
Let t1 be the ﬁrst si in T (if T ̸= Ø). Let t2 be the second si in T (if T ̸= {t1}).
Let t3 be the third si in T (if T ̸= {t1, t2}), . . . .
This process comes to an end only if T = {t1, t2, . . . , tn} for some n, in which
case T is ﬁnite.
If the process does not come to an end we obtain a list
{t1, t2, . . . , tn, . . . } of members of T. This list contains every member of T, because
if si ∈T then we reach si no later than the ith step in the process; so si occurs
in the list. Hence T is countably inﬁnite.
So T is either ﬁnite or countably inﬁnite.
As an immediate consequence of Proposition 1.1.11 and Example 1.1.8 we
have the following result.
A1.1.12
Corollary.
Every subset of Z is countable.
A1.1.13
Lemma.
If S1, S2, . . . , Sn, . . . is a countably inﬁnite family of
countably inﬁnite sets such that Si ∩Sj = Ø for i ̸= j, then
∞
i=1
Si is a countably
inﬁnite set.
Proof.
As each Si is a countably inﬁnite set, Si = {si1, si2, . . ., sin, . . . }. Now
put the sij in a square array and list them by zigzagging up and down the short
diagonals.

This shows that all members of ∞
i=1 Si are listed, and the list is inﬁnite
because each Si is inﬁnite. So ∞
i=1 Si is countably inﬁnite.

26
APPENDIX 1: INFINITE SETS
In Lemma A1.1.13 we assumed that the sets Si were pairwise disjoint. If
they are not paiwise disjoint the proof is easily modiﬁed by deleting repeated
elements to obtain:
A1.1.14
Lemma.
If S1, S2, . . ., Sn, . . . is a countably inﬁnite family
of countably inﬁnite sets, then
∞
i=1
Si is a countably inﬁnite set.
A1.1.15
Proposition.
The union of any countable family of
countable sets is countable.
Proof.
Exercise.
A1.1.16
Proposition.
If S and T are countably inﬁnite sets then
the product set S × T = {⟨s, t⟩: s ∈S, t ∈T} is a countably inﬁnite set.
Proof.
Let S = {s1, s2, . . . , sn, . . . } and t = {t1, t2, . . . , tn, . . . }.
Then S × T =
∞
i=1
{⟨si, t1⟩, ⟨si, t2⟩, . . ., ⟨si, tn⟩, . . .}. So S×T is a countably inﬁnite union of countably
inﬁnite sets and is therefore countably inﬁnite.
A1.1.17
Corollary.
Every ﬁnite product of countable sets is
countable.
We are now ready for a signiﬁcant application of our observations on
countable sets.
A1.1.18
Lemma.
The set, Q>0, of all positive rational numbers is
countably inﬁnite.
Proof.
Let Si be the set of all positive rational numbers with denominator
i, for i ∈N. Then Si =
1
i , 2
i , . . . , n
i , . . .

and Q>0 =
∞
i=1
Si. As each Si is countably
inﬁnite, Proposition A1.1.15 yields that Q>0 is countably inﬁnite.

27
We are now ready to prove that the set, Q, of all rational numbers is
countably inﬁnite; that is, there exists a one-to-one correspondence between
the set Q and the (seemingly) very much smaller set, N, of all positive integers.
A1.1.19
Theorem.
The set Q of all rational numbers is countably
inﬁnite.
Proof.
Clearly the set Q<0 of all negative rational numbers is equipotent to
the set, Q>0, of all positive rational numbers and so using Proposition A1.1.10
and Lemma A1.1.18 we obtain that Q<0 is countably inﬁnite.
Finally observe that Q is the union of the three sets Q>0, Q<0 and {0} and
so it too is countably inﬁnite by Proposition A1.1.15.
A1.1.20
Corollary.
Every set of rational numbers is countable.
Proof.
This is a consequence of Theorem A1.1.19 and Proposition A1.1.11.
A1.1.21
Deﬁnitions.
A real number x is said to be an algebraic
number if there is a natural number n and integers a0, a1, . . ., an with a0 ̸= 0
such that
a0xn + a1xn−1 + · · · + an−1x + an = 0.
A
real
number
which
is
not
an
algebraic
number
is
said
to
be
a
transcendental number.
A1.1.22
Example.
Every rational number is an algebraic number.
Proof.
If x = p
q, for p, q ∈Z and q ̸= 0, then qx−p = 0; that is, x is an algebraic
number with n = 1, a0 = q, and an = −p.
A1.1.23
Example.
The number
√
2 is an algebraic number which is
not a rational number.
Proof.
While
√
2 is irrational, it satisﬁes x =
√
2 satisﬁes x2 −2 = 0 and so is
algebraic.

28
APPENDIX 1: INFINITE SETS
A1.1.24
Remark.
It is also easily veriﬁed that
4√
5 −
√
3 is an algebraic
number since it satisﬁes
x8 −12x6 + 44x4 −288x2 + 16 = 0.
Indeed any real
number which can be constructed from the set of integers using only a ﬁnite
number of the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and
the extraction of square roots, cube roots, . . . , is algebraic.
A1.1.25
Remark.
Remark A1.1.24 shows that “most” numbers we
think of are algebraic numbers. To show that a given number is transcendental
can be extremely diﬃcult.
The ﬁrst such demonstration was in 1844 when
Liouville proved the transcendence of the number

It was Charles Hermite who, in 1873, showed that e is transcendental. In
1882 Lindemann proved that the number π is transcendental thereby answering
in the negative the 2,000 year old question about squaring the circle.
(The
question is: given a circle of radius 1, is it possible, using only a straight edge
and compass, to construct a square with the same area? A full exposition of
this problem and proofs that e and π are transcendental are to be found in the
book: “ Abstract Algebra and Famous Impossibilities” by Arthur Jones, Sidney
A. Morris, and Kenneth R. Pearson, Springer-Verlag Publishers New York,
Berlin etc. (187 pp. 27 ﬁgs., Softcover) 1st ed. 1991. ISBN 0-387-97661-2
Corr. 2nd printing 1993. ISBN 3-540-97661-2.)
We now proceed to prove that the set A of all algebraic numbers is also
countably inﬁnite. This is a more powerful result than Theorem A1.1.19 which
is in fact a corollary of this result.

29
A1.1.26
Theorem.
The set A of all algebraic numbers is countably
inﬁnite.
Proof.
Consider the polynomial f(x) = a0xn + a1xn−1 + · · · + an−1x + an , where
a0 ̸= 0 and each ai ∈Z and deﬁne its height to be n + |a0| + |a1| + · · · + |an|.
For each positive integer k, let Ak be the set of all roots of all such
polynomials of height k. Clearly A =
∞
k=1
Ak.
Therefore, to show that A is countably inﬁnite, it suﬃces by Proposition
A1.1.15 to show that each Ak is ﬁnite.
If f is a polynomial of degree n, then clearly n ≤k and |ai| ≤k for i = 1, 2, . . ., n.
So the set of all polynomials of height k is certainly ﬁnite.
Further, a polynomial of degree n has at most n roots. Consequently each
polynomial of height k has no more than k roots. Hence the set Ak is ﬁnite, as
required.
A1.1.27
Corollary.
Every set of algebraic numbers is countable.
Note that Corollary A1.1.27 has as a special case, Corollary A1.1.20.
So far we have not produced any example of an uncountable set. Before
doing so we observe that certain mappings will not take us out of the family of
countable sets.
A1.1.28
Proposition.
Let X and Y be sets and f a mapping of
X into Y . Then
(i) if X is countable and f is surjective (that is, an onto mapping), then
Y is countable;
(ii) if Y is countable and f is injective (that is, a one-to-one mapping),
then X is countable.
Proof.
Exercise.

APPENDIX 1: INFINITE SETS
A1.1.29
Proposition.
Let S be a countable set. Then the set of
all ﬁnite subsets of S is also countable.
Proof.
Exercise.
A1.1.30
Deﬁnition.
Let S be any set. The set of all subsets of S
is said to be the power set of S and is denoted by P(S).
A1.1.31
Theorem.
(Georg Cantor)
For every set S, the power
set, P(S), is not equipotent to S; that is, P(S) ̸∼S.
Proof.
We have to prove that there is no one-to-one correspondence
between S and P(S). We shall prove more: that there is not even any surjective
function mapping S onto P(S).
Suppose that there exists a function f : S →P(S) which is onto. For each
x ∈S, f(x) ∈P(S), which is the same as saying that f(x) ⊆S.
Let T = {x : x ∈S and x ̸∈f(x)}. Then T ⊆S; that is, T ∈P(S). So T = f(y)
for some y ∈S, since f maps S onto P(S). Now y ∈T or y ̸∈T.
Case 1.
y ∈T ⇒y ̸∈f(y)
(by the deﬁnition of T)
⇒y ̸∈T
(since f(y) = T).
So Case 1 is impossible.
Case 2.
y ̸∈T ⇒y ∈f(y)
(by the deﬁnition of T)
⇒y ∈T
(since f(y) = T).
So Case 2 is impossible.
As both cases are impossible, we have a contradiction. So our supposition
is false and there does not exist any function mapping S onto P(S). Thus P(S)
is not equipotent to S.

31
A1.1.32
Lemma.
If S is any set, then S is equipotent to a subset
of its power set, P(S).
Proof.
Deﬁne the mapping f : S →P(S) by f(x) = {x}, for each x ∈S.
Clearly f is a one-to-one correspondence between the sets S and f(S). So S is
equipotent to the subset f(S) of P(S).
A1.1.33
Proposition.
If S is any inﬁnite set, then P(S) is an
uncountable set.
Proof.
As S is inﬁnite, the set P(S) is inﬁnite. By Theorem A1.1.30, P(S)
is not equipotent to S.
Suppose P(S) is countably inﬁnite. Then by Proposition A1.1.11, Lemma
1.1.31 and Proposition A1.1.10, S is countably inﬁnite.
So S and P(S) are
equipotent, which is a contradiction. Hence P(S) is uncountable.
Proposition A1.1.33 demonstrates the existence of uncountable sets. However
the sceptic may feel that the example is contrived. So we conclude this section
by observing that important and familiar sets are uncountable.

32
APPENDIX 1: INFINITE SETS
A1.1.34
Lemma.
The set of all real numbers in the half open
interval [1, 2) is not countable.
Proof.
(Cantor’s diagonal argument)
We shall show that the set of all
real numbers in [1, 2) cannot be listed.
Let L = {r1, r2, . . . rn . . . } be any list of real numbers each of which lies in the
set [1, 2). Write down their decimal expansions:
r1 =1.r11r12 . . . r1n . . .
r2 =1.r21r22 . . . r2n . . .
...
rm =1.rm1rm2 . . . rmn . . .
...
Consider the real number a deﬁned to be 1.a1a2 . . . an . . . where, for each
n ∈N,
an =

1
if rnn ̸= 1
2
if rnn = 1.
Clearly an ̸= rnn and so a ̸= rn, for all n ∈N. Thus a does not appear anywhere
in the list L. Thus there does not exist a listing of the set of all real numbers
in [1, 2); that is, this set is uncountable.
A1.1.35
Theorem.
The set, R, of all real numbers is uncountable.
Proof.
Suppose R is countable. Then by Proposition A1.1.11 the set of all
real numbers in [1, 2) is countable, which contradicts Lemma A1.1.34. Therefore
R is uncountable.
A1.1.36
Corollary.
The
set,
I,
of
all
irrational
numbers
is
uncountable.
Proof.
Suppose
I is countable.
Then R is the union of two countable
sets: I and Q. By Proposition A1.1.15, R is countable which is a contradiction.
Hence I is uncountable.

33
Using a similar proof to that in Corollary A1.1.36 we obtain the following
result.
A1.1.37
Corollary.
The set of all transcendental numbers is
uncountable.
A1.2
Cardinal Numbers
In the previous section we deﬁned countably inﬁnite and uncountable and
suggested, without explaining what it might mean, that uncountable sets are
“bigger” than countably inﬁnite sets. To explain what we mean by “bigger” we
will need the next theorem.
Our exposition is based on that in Paul Halmos’ book: “Naive Set Theory”,
Van Nostrand Reinhold Company, New York, Cincinnati etc.,104 pp., 1960.

34
APPENDIX 1: INFINITE SETS
A1.2.1
Theorem.
(Cantor-Schr¨oder-Bernstein)
Let S and
T be sets. If S is equipotent to a subset of T and T is equipotent to a subset
of S, then S is equipotent to T.
Proof.
Without loss of generality we can assume S and T are disjoint. Let
f : S →T and g : T →S be one-to-one maps. We are required to ﬁnd a bijection
of S onto T.
We say that an element s is a parent of an element f(s) and f(s) is a
descendant of s. Also t is a parent of g(t) and g(t) is a descendant of t. Each
s ∈S has an inﬁnite sequence of descendants: f(s), g(f(s)), f(g(f(s))), and so on.
We say that each term in such a sequence is an ancestor of all the terms that
follow it in the sequence.
Now let s ∈S. If we trace its ancestry back as far as possible one of three
things must happen:
(i) the list of ancestors is ﬁnite, and stops at an element of S which has no
ancestor;
(ii) the list of ancestors is ﬁnite, and stops at an element of T which has no
ancestor;
(iii) the list of ancestors is inﬁnite.
Let SS be the set of those elements in S which originate in S; that is, SS
is the set S \ g(T) plus all of its descendants in S. Let ST be the set of those
elements which originate in T; that is, ST is the set of descendants in S of
T \ f(S). Let S∞be the set of all elements in S with no parentless ancestors.
Then S is the union of the three disjoint sets SS, ST and S∞. Similarly T is the
disjoint union of the three similarly deﬁned sets: TT, TS, and T∞.
Clearly the restriction of f to SS is a bijection of SS onto TS.
Now let g−1 be the inverse function of the bijection g of T onto g(T). Clearly
the restriction of g−1 to ST is a bijection of ST onto TT.
Finally, the restriction of f to S∞is a bijection of S∞onto T∞.
Deﬁne h : S →T by
h(s) =





f(s)
if s ∈SS
g−1(s)
if s ∈ST
f(s)
if s ∈S∞.
Then h is a bijection of S onto T. So S is equipotent to T.

35
Our next task is to deﬁne what we mean by “cardinal number”.
A1.2.2
Deﬁnitions.
A collection, ℵ, of sets is said to be a cardinal
number if it satisﬁes the conditions:
(i) Let S and T be sets. If S and T are in ℵ, then S ∼T;
(ii) Let A and B be sets. If A is in ℵand B ∼A, then B is in ℵ.
If ℵis a cardinal number and A is a set in ℵ, then we write card A = ℵ.
Deﬁnitions A1.2.2 may, at ﬁrst sight, seem strange. A cardinal number is
deﬁned as a collection of sets. So let us look at a couple of special cases:
If a set A has two elements we write card A = 2; the cardinal number 2 is
the collection of all sets eqipotent to the set {1, 2}, that is the collection of all
sets with 2 elements.
If a set S is countable inﬁnite, then we write card S = ℵ0; in this case the
cardinal number ℵ0 is the collection of all sets equipotent to N.
Let S and T be sets. Then S is equipotent to T if and only if card S = card T.
A1.2.3
Deﬁnitions.
The cardinality of R is denoted by c; that is,
card R = c. The cardinality of N is denoted by ℵ0.
The symbol c is used in Deﬁnitions A1.2.3 as we think of R as the
“continuum”.
We now deﬁne an ordering of the cardinal numbers.
A1.2.4
Deﬁnitions.
Let m and n be cardinal numbers. Then the
cardinal m is said to be less than or equal to n, that is m ≤n, if there are
sets S and T such that card m = S, card T = n, and S is equipotent to a
subset of T. Further, the cardinal m is said to be strictly less than n, that
is m < n, if m ≤n and m ̸= n.
As R has N as a subset, card R = c and card N = ℵ0, and R is not equipotent
to N, we immediately deduce the following result.

36
APPENDIX 1: INFINITE SETS
A1.2.5
Proposition.
ℵ0 < c.
We also know that for any set S, S is equipotent to a subset of P(S), and
S is not equipotent to P(S), from which we deduce the next result.
A1.2.6
Theorem.
For any set S, card S < card P(S).
The following is a restatement of the Cantor-Schr¨oder-Bernstein Theorem.
A1.2.7
Theorem.
Let m and n be cardinal numbers. If m ≤n and
n ≤m, then m = n.
A1.2.8
Remark.
We observe that there are an inﬁnite number of
inﬁnite cardinal numbers. This is clear from the fact that:
(∗)
ℵ0 = card N < card P(N) < card P(P(N)) < . . .
The next result is an immediate consequence of Theorem A1.2.6.
A1.2.9
Corollary.
There is no largest cardinal number.
Noting that if a ﬁnite set S has n elements, then its power set P(S) has 2n
elements, it is natural to introduce the following notation.
A1.2.10
Deﬁnition.
If a set
S
has cardinality ℵ,
then
the
cardinality of P(S) is denoted by 2ℵ.
Thus we can rewrite (∗) above as:
(∗∗)
ℵ0 < 2ℵ0 < 22ℵ0 < 222ℵ0 < . . . .
When we look at this sequence of cardinal numbers there are a number of
questions which should come to mind including:

37
(1) Is ℵ0 the smallest inﬁnite cardinal number?
(2) Is c equal to one of the cardinal numbers on this list?
(3) Are there any cardinal numbers strictly between ℵ0 and 2ℵ0?
These questions, especially (1) and (3), are not easily answered.
Indeed
they require a careful look at the axioms of set theory. It is not possible in this
Appendix to discuss seriously the axioms of set theory.
Nevertheless we will
touch upon the above questions later in the appendix.
We conclude this section by identifying the cardinalities of a few more
familiar sets.
A1.2.11
Lemma.
Let a and b be real numbers with a < b. Then
(i) [0, 1] ∼[a, b];
(ii) (0, 1) ∼(a, b);
(iii) (0, 1) ∼(1, ∞);
(iv) (−∞, −1) ∼(−2, −1);
(v) (1, ∞) ∼(1, 2);
(vi) R ∼(−2, 2);
(vii) R ∼(a, b).
Outline Proof.
(i) is proved by observing that f(x) = a + b x deﬁnes a one-
to-one function of [0, 1] onto [a, b]. (ii) and (iii) are similarly proved by ﬁnding
suitable functions. (iv) is proved using (iii) and (ii). (v) follows from (iv). (vi)
follows fromm (iv) and (v) by observing that R is the union of the pairwise
disjoint sets (−∞, −1), [−1, 1] and (1, ∞). (vii) follows from (vi) and (ii).
.
A1.2.12
Proposition.
Let a and b be real numbers with a < b.
If S is any subset of R such that (a, b) ⊆S, then card S = c. In particular,
card (a, b) = card [a, b] = c.
Proof.
Using Lemma A1.2.11 observe that
card R = card (a, b) ≤card [a, b] ≤card R.
So card (a, b) = card [a, b] = card R = c.
.

38
APPENDIX 1: INFINITE SETS
A1.2.13
Proposition.
If R2 is the set of points in the Euclidean
plane, then card (R2) = c.
Outline Proof.
By Proposition A1.2.11, R is equipotent to the half-open
interval [0, 1) and it is easily shown that it suﬃces to prove that [0, 1)×[0, 1) ∼[0, 1).
Deﬁne f : [0, 1) →[0, 1)×[0, 1) by f(x) is the point ⟨x, 0⟩. Then f is a one-to-one
mapping of [0, 1) into [0, 1) × [0, 1) and so c = card [0, 1) ≤card [0, 1) × [0, 1).
By the Cantor-Schr¨oder-Bernstein Theorem, it suﬃces then to ﬁnd a one-
to-one function g of [0, 1] × [0, 1] into [0, 1]. Deﬁne
g(⟨0.a1a2 . . . an . . . , 0.b1b2 . . . bn . . . , ⟩) = ⟨0.a1b1a2b2 . . . anbn . . . ⟩).
Clearly g is well-deﬁned (as each real number is [0, 1) has a unique decimal
representation) and is one-to-one, which completes the proof.
A1.3
Cardinal Arithmetic
We begin with a deﬁnition of addition of cardinal numbers. Of course, when
the cardinal numbers are ﬁnite, this deﬁntion must agree with addition of ﬁnite
numbers.
A1.3.1
Deﬁnition.
Let α and β be any cardinal numbers and select
disjoint sets A and B such that card A = α and card B = β. Then the sum of
the cardinal numbers α and β is denoted by α+β and is equal to card (A∪B).
A1.3.2
Remark.
Before knowing that the above deﬁnition makes sense
and in particular does not depend on the choice of the sets A and B, it is
necessary to verify that if A1 and B1 are disjoint sets and A and B are disjoint
sets such that card A = card A1 and card B = card B1, then A ∪B ∼A1 ∪B1; that
is, card (A ∪B) = card (A1 ∪B1). This is a straightforward task and so is left as
an exercise.

39
A1.3.3
Proposition.
For any cardinal numbers α, β and γ :
(i) α + β = β + α ;
(ii) α + (β + γ) = (α + β) + γ ;
(iii) α + 0 = α ;
(iv) If α ≤β then α + γ ≤β + γ .
Proof.
Exercise
A1.3.4
Proposition.
(i) ℵ0 + ℵ0 = ℵ0;
(ii) c + ℵ0 = c;
(iii) c + c = c;
(iv) For any ﬁnite cardinal n, n + ℵ0 = ℵ0 and n + c = c.
Proof.
(i) The listing 1, −1, 2, −2, . . ., n, −n, . . . shows that the union of the two countably
inﬁnite sets N and the set of negative integers is a countably inﬁnite set.
(ii) Noting that [−2, −1] ∪N ⊂R, we see that card [−2, −1] + card N ≤card R = c.
So c = card [−2, −1] ≤card ([−2, −1] ∪N) = card [−2, −1] + card N = c + ℵ0 ≤c.
(iii) Note that c ≤c + c = card ((0, 1) ∪(1, 2)) ≤card R = c from which the required
result is immediate.
(iv) Observe that ℵ0 ≤n + ℵ0 ≤ℵ0 + ℵ0 = ℵ0 and c ≤n + c ≤c + c = c, from which
the results follow.
Next we deﬁne multiplication of cardinal numbers.
A1.3.5
Deﬁnition.
Let α and β be any cardinal numbers and select
disjoint sets A and B such that card A = α and card B = β. Then the product
of the cardinal numbers α and β is denoted by αβ and is equal to card (A×B).

40
APPENDIX 1: INFINITE SETS
As in the case of addition of cardinal numbers, it is necessary, but routine,
to check in Deﬁnition A1.3.5 that α β does not depend on the speciﬁc choice
of the sets A and B.
A1.3.6
Proposition.
For any cardinal numbers α, β and γ
(i) αβ = βα ;
(ii) α(βγ) = (αβ)γ ;
(iii) 1.α = α ;
(iv) 0.α = 0;
(v) α(β + γ) = αβ + αγ;
(vi) For any ﬁnite cardinal n, nα = α + α + . . . α (n-terms)
(v1i) If α ≤β then αγ ≤βγ .
Proof.
Exercise
A1.3.7
Proposition.
(i) ℵ0 ℵ0 = ℵ0;
(iii) cc = c;
(ii) c ℵ0 = c;
(iv) For any ﬁnite cardinal n, n ℵ0 = ℵ0 and nc = c.
Outline Proof.
(i) follows from Proposition 1.1.16, while (ii) follows from
Proposition A1.2.13. To see (iii), observe that c = c.1 ≤c ℵ0 ≤cc = c. The proof
of (iv) is also straightforward.
The next step in the arithmetic of cardinal numbers is to deﬁne exponentiation
of cardinal numbers; that is, if α and β are cardinal numbers then we wish to
deﬁne α β.
A1.3.8
Deﬁnitions.
Let α and β be cardinal numbers and A and
B sets such that card A = α and card B = β. The set of all functions f of B
into A is denoted by AB. Further, α β is deﬁned to be card AB.

41
Once again we need to check that the deﬁnition makes sense, that is that
αβ does not depend on the choice of the sets A and B. We also check that if
n and m are ﬁnite cardinal numbers, A is a set with n elements and B is a set
with m elements, then there are precisely nm distinct functions from B into A.
We also need to address one more concern: If α is a cardinal number and
A is a set such that card A = α, then we have two diﬀerent deﬁnitions of 2α.
The above deﬁnition has 2α as the cardinality of the set of all functions of A
into the two point set {0, 1}.
On the other hand, Deﬁnition A1.2.10 deﬁnes
2α to be card (P(A)).
It suﬃces to ﬁnd a bijection θ of 0, 1A onto P(A).
Let
f ∈{0, 1}A. Then f : A →{0, 1}. Deﬁne θ(f) = f −1(1). The task of verifying that θ
is a bijection is left as an exercise.
A1.3.9
Proposition.
For any cardinal numbers α, β and γ :
(i) α β+γ = α β α γ ;
(ii) (αβ)γ = αγ βγ ;
(iii) α βγ ;
(iv) α ≤β implies αγ ≤βγ ;
(v) α ≤β implies γα ≤γ β .
Proof.
Exercise
After Deﬁnition A1.2.10 we asked three questions. We are now in a position
to answer the second of these questions.

42
APPENDIX 1: INFINITE SETS
A1.3.10
Lemma.
ℵ0
ℵ0 = c.
Proof.
Observe that card NN = ℵ0
ℵ0 and card (0, 1) = c.
As the function
f : (0, 1) →NN given by f(0.a1a2 . . . an . . . ) = ⟨a1, a2, . . . , an, . . . ⟩is an injection, it
follows that c ≤ℵ0
ℵ0.
By the Cantor-Schr¨oder-Bernstein Theorem,
to conclude the proof it
suﬃces to ﬁnd an injective map g of NN into (0, 1).
If ⟨a1, a2, . . . , an, . . .⟩is any
element of NN, then each ai ∈N and so we can write ai = . . . ain ai(n−1) . . . ai2 ai1,
where for some Mi ∈N, ain = 0, for all n > Mi [For example 187 = . . . 0 0 . . . 0 1 8 7
and so if ai = 187 then ai1 = 7, ai2 = 8, ai3=1 and ain = 0, for n > Mi = 3.] Then
deﬁne the map g by
g(⟨a1, a2, . . . , an, . . . ⟩) = 0.a11a12a21a13a22a31a14a23a32a41a15a24a33a42a51a16 . . . .
(Compare this with the proof of Lemma A1.1.13.)
Clearly g is an injection, which completes the proof.
We now state a beautiful result, ﬁrst proved by Georg Cantor.
A1.3.11
Theorem.
2ℵ0 = c.
Proof.
Firstly observe that 2ℵ0 ≤ℵ0
ℵ0 = c, by Lemma A1.3.10.
So we
have to verify that c ≤ℵ0. To do this it suﬃces to ﬁnd an injective map f of
the set [0, 1) into {0, 1}N.
Each element x of [0, 1) has a binary representation
x = 0.x1x2 . . . xn . . . , with each xi equal to 0 or 1.
The binary representation is
unique except for representations ending in a string of 1s; for example,
1/4 = 0.0100 . . .0 · · · = 0.0011 . . .1 . . ..
Providing that in all such cases we choose the representation with a string
of zeros rather than a string of 1s, the representation of numbers in [0, 1) is
unique.
We deﬁne the function f : [0, 1) →{0, 1}N which maps x ∈[0, 1) to the
function f(x): N →{0, 1} given by f(x)(n) = xn, n ∈N. To see that f is injective,
consider any x and y in [0, 1) with x ̸= y.
Then xm ̸= ym, for some m ∈N.
So f(x)(m) = xm ̸= ym = f(y)(m).
Hence the two functions f(x): N →{0, 1} and
f(y): N →{0, 1} are not equal. As x and y were arbitrary (unequal) elements of
[0, 1), it follows that f is indeed injective, as required.

43
A1.3.12
Corollary.
If α is a cardinal number such that 2 ≤α ≤c,
then αℵ0 = c.
Proof.
Observe that c = 2ℵ0 ≤αℵ0 ≤cℵ0 = (2ℵ0)ℵ0 = 2ℵ0.ℵ0 = 2ℵ0 = c.

In a movie there is usually a character about whom the plot revolves.
In the story of topology, the Euclidean topology on the set of real
numbers is such a character. Indeed it is such a rich example that we
shall frequently return to it for inspiration and further examination.
Let R denote the set of all real numbers. In Chapter 1 we deﬁned
three topologies that can be put on any set: the discrete topology, the
indiscrete topology and the ﬁnite-closed topology. So we know three
topologies that can be put on the set R. Six other topologies on R
were deﬁned in Exercises 1.1 #5 and #9. In this chapter we describe
a much more important and interesting topology on R which is known
as the Euclidean topology.
An analysis of the Euclidean topology leads us to the notion of
“basis for a topology”. In the study of Linear Algebra we learn that
every vector space has a basis and every vector is a linear combination
of members of the basis. Similarly, in a topological space every open
set can be expressed as a union of members of the basis. Indeed, a set
is open if and only if it is a union of members of the basis.

Topology Without Tears
2.1
The Euclidean Topolology on R
2.1.1
Deﬁnition.
A subset S of R is said to be open in the
Euclidean topology on R if it has the following property:
∗

For each x ∈S, there exist a and b in R,
with a < b, such that x ∈(a, b) ⊆S.
Notation.
Any time that we refer to the topological space R without
specifying the topology, we mean R with the Euclidean topology.
2.1.2
Examples.
(i)
The “Euclidean topology” τ is a topology.
Proof.
We are required to show that τ satisﬁes conditions (i), (ii), and (iii) of Deﬁni-
tion 1.1.1.
We are given that a set is in τ if and only if it has property ∗.
Firstly, we show that R ∈τ. Let x ∈R. If we put a = x −1 and
b = x + 1, then x ∈(a, b) ⊆R; that is, R has property ∗and so R ∈τ.
Secondly, Ø ∈τ as Ø has property ∗by default.
Now let {Aj : j ∈J}, for some index set J, be a family of members
of τ. Then we have to show that

j∈J Aj ∈τ; that is, we have to show
that

j∈J Aj has property ∗. Let x ∈

j∈J Aj. Then x ∈Ak, for some
k ∈J. As Ak ∈τ, there exist a and b in R with a < b such that
x ∈(a, b) ⊆Ak. As k ∈J, Ak ⊆

j∈J Aj and so x ∈(a, b) ⊆

j∈J Aj.
Hence

j∈J Aj has property ∗and thus is in τ, as required.
Finally, let A1 and A2 be in τ. We have to prove that A1 ∩A2 ∈τ.
So let x ∈A1 ∩A2. Then x ∈A1. As A1 ∈τ, there exist a and b
in R with a < b such that x ∈(a, b) ⊆A1. Also x ∈A2 ∈τ. So
there exist c and d in R with c < d such that x ∈(c, d) ⊆A2. Let e
be the greater of a and c, and f the smaller of b and d. It is easily
checked that e < x < f, and so x ∈(e, f). As (e, f) ⊆(a, b) ⊆A1
and (e, f) ⊆(c, d) ⊆A2, we deduce that x ∈(e, f) ⊆A1 ∩A2. Hence
A1 ∩A2 has property ∗and so is in τ.

Euclidean Topology
21
We now proceed to describe the open sets and the closed sets in
the Euclidean topology on R. In particular, we shall see that all open
intervals are indeed open sets in this topology and all closed intervals
are closed sets.
(ii)
Let r, s ∈R with r < s. In the Euclidean topology τ on R,
the open interval (r, s) does indeed belong to τ and so is an open set.
Proof.
We are given the open interval (r, s).
We are required to show that (r, s) is open in the Euclidean topology; that is,
we have to show that (r, s) satisﬁes condition (∗) of Deﬁnition 2.1.1.
So we shall begin by letting x ∈(r, s). We want to ﬁnd a and b in R with
a < b such that x ∈(a, b) ⊆(r, s).
Let x ∈(r, s). Choose a = r and b = s. Then clearly
x ∈(a, b) ⊆(r, s).
So (r, s) is an open set in the Euclidean topology.
(iii)
The open intervals (r, ∞) and (−∞, r) are open sets in R,
for every real number r.
Proof.
Firstly, we shall show that the interval (r, ∞) is an open set; that is, that it
has property ∗.
To show this we let x ∈(r, ∞) and seek a, b ∈R such that
x ∈(a, b) ⊆(r, ∞).
Let x ∈(r, ∞). Put a = r and b = x + 1. Then
x ∈(a, b) ⊆(r, ∞)
and so (r, ∞) ∈τ.

Topology Without Tears
(iv)
It is important to note that while every open interval is an
open set in R, the converse is false. Not all open sets are intervals.
For example, the set (1, 3) ∪(5, 6) is an open set in R, but it is not an
open interval. Even the set
∞
n=1(2n, 2n + 1) is an open set in R.
(v)
For each c and d in R with c < d, the closed interval [c, d] is
not an open set in R.
Proof.
We have to show that [c, d] does not have property ∗.
To do this it suﬃces to ﬁnd any one x such that there is no a, b satisfying the
condition in ∗.
Obviously c and d are very special points in the interval [c, d]. So we shall
choose x = c and show that no a, b with the required property exist.
We use the method of proof called proof by contradiction. We suppose that a
and b exist with the required property and show that this leads to a contradiction,
that is something which is false. Consequently the supposition is false! Hence no
such a and b exist. Thus [c, d] does not have property ∗and so is not an open set.
Observe that c ∈[c, d]. Suppose there exist a and b in R with
a < b such that c ∈(a, b) ⊆[c, d]. Then c ∈(a, b) implies a < c < b
and so a < c+a
2
< c < b. Thus c+a
2
∈(a, b) and c+a
2
/∈[c, d]. Hence
(a, b) ̸⊆[c, d], which is a contradiction. So there do not exist a and b
such that c ∈(a, b) ⊆[c, d]. Hence [c, d] does not have property ∗and
so [c, d] /∈τ.
(vi)
For each a and b in R with a < b, the closed interval [a, b]
is a closed set in the Euclidean topology on R.
Proof.
To see that it is closed we have to observe only that its
complement (−∞, a) ∪(b, ∞), being the union of the two open sets, is
an open set.
(vii)
Each singleton set {a} is closed in R.
Proof.
The complement of {a} is the union of the two open sets
(−∞, a) and (a, ∞) and so is open. Therefore {a} is closed in R, as
required.
[In the terminology of Exercises 1 3 #3 this result says that R is

Euclidean Topology
23
(viii)
Note that we could have included (vii) in (vi) simply by
replacing “a < b” by “a ≤b”.
The singleton set {a} is just the
degenerate case of the closed interval [a, b].
(ix)
The set Z of all integers is a closed subset of R.
Proof.
The complement of Z is the union
∞

n=−∞
(n, n + 1)
of open subsets (n, n + 1) of R and so is open in R. Therefore Z is
closed in R.
(x)
The set Q of all rational numbers is neither a closed subset
of R nor an open subset of R.
Proof.
We shall show that Q is not an open set by proving that it does not have
property ∗.
To do this it suﬃces to show that Q does not contain any interval (a, b), with
a < b.
Suppose that (a, b) ⊆Q, where a and b are in R with a < b.
Between any two distinct real numbers there is an irrational number.
(Can you prove this?) Therefore there exists c ∈(a, b) such that c /∈Q.
This contradicts (a, b) ⊆Q. Hence Q does not contain any interval
(a, b), and so is not an open set.
To prove that Q is not a closed set it suﬃces to show that R \ Q
is not an open set. Using the fact that between any two distinct real
numbers there is a rational number we see that R\Q does not contain
any interval (a, b) with a < b. So R \ Q is not open in R and hence Q
is not closed in R.

Basis for a Topology
2.2.1
Proposition.
A subset S of R is open if and only if it is a
union of open intervals.
Proof.
We are required to prove that S is open if and only if it is a union of open
intervals; that is, we have to show that
(i) if S is a union of open intervals, then it is an open set, and
(ii) if S is an open set, then it is a union of open intervals.
Assume that S is a union of open intervals; that is, there exist
open intervals (aj, bj), where j belongs to some index set J, such that
S =

j∈J(aj, bj). By Examples 2.1.2 (ii) each open interval (aj, bj) is
an open set. Thus S is a union of open sets and so S is an open set.
Conversely, assume that S is open in R. Then for each x ∈S,
there exists an interval Ix = (a, b) such that x ∈Ix ⊆S. We now claim
that
S =

x∈S
Ix.
We are required to show that the two sets S and 
x∈S Ix are equal.
These sets are shown to be equal by proving that
(i) if y ∈S, then y ∈
x∈S Ix, and
(ii) if z ∈
x∈S Ix, then z ∈S.
[Note that (i) is equivalent to the statement S ⊆
x∈S Ix, while (ii) is equivalent
to 
x∈S Ix ⊆S.]
Firstly let y ∈S. Then y ∈Iy. So y ∈

x∈S Ix, as required.
Secondly, let z ∈

x∈S Ix. Then z ∈It, for some t ∈S. As each Ix ⊆S,
we see that It ⊆S and so z ∈S. Hence S =

x∈S Ix, and we have that
S is a union of open intervals, as required.
The above proposition tells us that in order to describe the topol-
ogy of R it suﬃces to say that all intervals (a, b) are open sets. Every
other open set is a union of these open sets
This leads us to the

26
Topology Without Tears
2.2.2
Deﬁnition.
Let (X,τ) be a topological space. A collection
B of open subsets of X is said to be a basis for the topology τ if every
open set is a union of members of B.
If B is a basis for a topology τ on a set X then a subset U of X is
in τ if and only if it is a union of members of B. So B “generates” the
topology τ in the following sense: if we are told what sets are members
of B then we can determine the members of τ – they are just all the
sets which are unions of members of B.
2.2.3
Example.
Let B = {(a, b) : a, b ∈R, a < b}. Then B is a
basis for the Euclidean topology on R, by Proposition 2.2.1.
2.2.4
Example.
Let (X,τ) be a discrete space and B the family
of all singleton subsets of X; that is, B = {{x} : x ∈X}. Then, by
Proposition 1.1.9, B is a basis for τ.
2.2.5
Example.
Let X = {a, b, c, d, e, f} and
τ1 = {X, Ø, {a}, {c, d}, {a, c, d}, {b, c, d, e, f}}.
Then B = {{a}, {c, d}, {b, c, d, e, f}} is a basis for T1 as B ⊆T1 and
every member of τ1 can be expressed as a union of members of B.
Note that τ1 itself is also a basis for τ1.
2.2.6
Remark.
Observe that if (X,τ) is a topological space then
B = τ is a basis for the topology τ. So, for example, the set of all
subsets of X is a basis for the discrete topology on X.
We see, therefore, that there can be many diﬀerent bases for the
same topology. Indeed if B is a basis for a topology τ on a set X and
B1 is a collection of subsets of X such that B ⊆B1 ⊆τ, then B1 is also
a basis for τ. [Verify this.]
As indicated above the notion of “basis for a topology” allows us
to deﬁne topologies
However the following example shows that we

Euclidean Topology
27
2.2.7
Example. Let X = {a, b, c} and B = {{a}, {c}, {a, b}, {b, c}}.
Then B is not a basis for any topology on X. To see this, suppose that
B is a basis for a topology τ. Then τ consists of all unions of sets in
B; that is,
τ = {X, Ø, {a}, {c}, {a, c}, {a, b}, {b, c}}.
However, this is not a topology since the set {b} = {a, b}∩{b, c} is not
in τ and so τ does not have property (iii) of Deﬁnition 1.1.1. This is
a contradiction, and so our supposition is false. Thus B is not a basis
for any topology on X.
Thus we are led to ask: if B is a collection of subsets of X, under
what conditions is B a basis for a topology? This question is answered
by Proposition 2.2.8.
2.2.8
Proposition.
Let X be a non-empty set and let B be a
collection of subsets of X. Then B is a basis for a topology on X if
and only if B has the following properties:
(a) X =

B∈B B, and
(b) for any B1, B2 ∈B, the set B1 ∩B2 is a union of members of B.
Proof.
If B is a basis for a topology τ then τ must have the
properties (i), (ii), and (iii) of Deﬁnition 1.1.1. In particular X must
be an open set and the intersection of any two open sets must be an
open set. As the open sets are just the unions of members of B, this
implies that (a) and (b) above are true.
Conversely, assume that B has properties (a) and (b) and let τ be
the collection of all subsets of X which are unions of members of B.
We shall show that τ is a topology on X. (If so then B is obviously a
basis for this topology τ and the proposition is true.)
By (a), X =

B∈B B and so X ∈τ. Note that Ø is an empty union
of members of B and so Ø ∈τ. So we see that τ does have property
(i) of Deﬁnition 1.1.1.
Now let {Tj} be a family of members of τ.
Then each Tj is a
union of members of B. Hence the union of all the Tj is also a union
of members of B and so is in τ. Thus τ also satisﬁes condition (ii) of
Deﬁnition 1.1.1.
Finally let C and D be in τ. We need to verify that C∩D ∈τ. But
C =

k∈K Bk for some index set K and sets Bk ∈B Also D =

j∈J Bj

28
Topology Without Tears
C ∩D =


k∈K
Bk




j∈J
Bj


=

k∈K
j∈J
(Bk ∩Bj).
You should verify that the two expressions for C ∩D are indeed equal!
In the ﬁnite case this involves statements like
(B1 ∪B2) ∩(B3 ∪B4) = (B1 ∩B3) ∪(B1 ∩B4) ∪(B2 ∩B3) ∪(B2 ∩B4).
By our assumption (b), each Bk ∩Bj is a union of members of B
and so C ∩D is a union of members of B. Thus C ∩D ∈τ. So τ has
property (iii) of Deﬁnition 1.1.1.
Hence τ is indeed a topology, and B is a basis for this topology, as
required
Proposition 2.2.8 is a very useful result.
It allows us to deﬁne
topologies by simply writing down a basis. This is often easier than
trying to describe all of the open sets.
We shall now use this proposition to deﬁne a topology on the plane.
This topology is known as the “Euclidean topology”.
2.2.9
Example.
Let B be the collection of all “open rectangles”
{⟨x, y⟩: ⟨x, y⟩∈R2, a < x < b, c < y < d} in the plane which have
each side parallel to the X or Y axis.

Then B is a basis for a topology on the plane – called the Euclidean

29
Whenever we use the symbol R2 we mean the plane, and if we
refer to R2 as a topological space without explicitly saying what the
topology is, we mean the plane with the Euclidean topology.
To see that B is indeed a basis for a topology, observe that (i) the
plane is the union of all of the open rectangles, and (ii) the intersection
of any two rectangles is a rectangle. [By “rectangle” we mean one with
sides parallel to the axes.] So the conditions of Proposition 2.2.8 are
satisﬁed and hence B is a basis for a topology.
2.2.10 Remark.
By generalizing Example 2.2.9 we see how to put
a topology on Rn = {⟨x1, x2, . . . , xn⟩: xi ∈R, i = 1, . . . , n} for each
integer n > 2. We let B be the collection of all subsets
{⟨x1, x2, . . . , xn⟩∈Rn : ai < xi < bi, i = 1, 2, . . . , n}
of Rn with sides parallel to the axes. This collection B is a basis for
the Euclidean topology on Rn.

2.3
Basis for a Given Topology
Proposition 2.2.8 told us under what conditions a collection B of
subsets of a set X is a basis for some topology on X.
However
sometimes we are given a topology τ on X and we want to know
whether B is a basis for this speciﬁc topology τ. To verify that B is a
basis for τ we could simply apply Deﬁnition 2.2.2 and show that every
member of τ is a union of members of B. However, Proposition 2.3.2
provides us with an alternative method.
But ﬁrst we present an example which shows that there is a diﬀer-
ence between saying that a collection B of subsets of X is a basis for

32
Topology Without Tears
2.3.1
Example.
Let B be the collection of all half-open intervals
of the form (a, b], a < b, where (a, b] = {x : x ∈R, a < x ≤b}. Then
B is a basis for a topology on R, since R is the union of all members
of B and the intersection of any two half-open intervals is a half-open
interval.
However, the topology τ1 which has B as its basis, is not the
Euclidean topology on R. We can see this by observing that (a, b] is
an open set in R with topology τ1, while (a, b] is not an open set in R
with the Euclidean topology. (See Exercises 2.1 #1.) So B is a basis
for some toplogy but not a basis for the Euclidean topology on R.
2.3.2
Proposition.
Let (X,τ) be a topological space. A family
B of open subsets of X is a basis for τ if and only if for any point x
belonging to any open set U, there is a B ∈B such that x ∈B ⊆U.
Proof.
We are required to prove that
(i) if B is a basis for τ and x ∈U ∈τ, then there exists a B ∈B such that
x ∈B ⊆U, and
(ii) if for each U ∈τ and x ∈U there exists a B ∈B such that x ∈B ⊆U, then
B is a basis for τ.
Assume B is a basis for τ and x ∈U ∈τ. As B is a basis for τ,
the open set U is a union of members of B; that is, U =

j∈J Bj, where
Bj ∈B, for each j in some index set J. But x ∈U implies x ∈Bj, for
some j ∈J. Thus x ∈Bj ⊆U, as required.
Conversely, assume that for each U ∈τ and each x ∈U, there
exists a B ∈B with x ∈B ⊆U. We have to show that every open set
is a union of members of B. So let V be any open set. Then for each
x ∈V , there is a Bx ∈B such that x ∈Bx ⊆V . Clearly V =

x∈V Bx.
(Check this!) Thus V is a union of members of B.
2.3.3
Proposition.
Let B be a basis for a topology τ on a set X.
Then a subset U of X is open if and only if for each x ∈U there exists
a B ∈B such that x ∈B ⊆U.
Proof.
Let U be any subset of X. Assume that for each x ∈U,
there exists a Bx ∈B such that x ∈Bx ⊆U. Clearly U =

x∈U Bx. So
U is a union of open sets and hence is open as required The converse

Observe that the basis property described in Proposition 2.3.3 is
precisely what we used in deﬁning the Euclidean topology on R. We
said that a subset U of R is open if and only if for each x ∈U, there
exist a and b in R with a < b, such that x ∈(a, b) ⊆U.
Warning.
Make sure that you understand the diﬀerence between
Proposition 2.2.8 and Proposition 2.3.2.
Proposition 2.2.8 gives conditions for a family B of subsets of a set
X to be a basis for some topology on X. However, Proposition 2.3.2
gives conditions for a family B of subsets of a topological space (X,τ)
to be a basis for the given topology τ.
We have seen that a topology can have many diﬀerent bases. The
next proposition tells us when two bases B1 and B2 on the same set X
deﬁne the same topology.
2.3.4
Proposition.
Let B1 and B2 be bases for topologies τ1 and
τ2, respectively, on a non-empty set X. Then τ1 = τ2 if and only if
(i) for each B ∈B1 and each x ∈B, there exists a B
′ ∈B2 such that
x ∈B
′ ⊆B, and
(ii) for each B ∈B2 and each x ∈B, there exists a B
′ ∈B1 such that
x ∈B
′ ⊆B.
Proof.
We are required to show that B1 and B2 are bases for the same topology
if and only if (i) and (ii) are true.
Firstly we assume that they are bases for the same topology, that is τ1 = τ2,
and show that conditions (i) and (ii) hold.
Next we assume that (i) and (ii) hold and show that τ1 = τ2.
Firstly, assume that τ1 = τ2.
Then (i) and (ii) are immediate
consequences of Proposition 2.3.2.
Conversely, assume that B1 and B2 satisfy the conditions (i) and
(ii). By Proposition 2.3.2, (i) implies that each B ∈B1 is open in
(X,τ2); that is, B1 ⊆τ2. As every member of τ1 is a union of members
of τ2 this implies τ1 ⊆τ2
Similarly (ii) implies τ2 ⊆τ1
Hence

2.3.5
Example.
Show that the set B of all “open” equilateral
triangles with base parallel to the X-axis is a basis for the Euclidean
topology on R2. (By an “open” triangle we mean that the boundary
is not included.)
Outline Proof.
(We give here only a pictorial argument. It is left
to you to write a detailed proof.)
We are required to show that B is a basis for the Euclidean topology.
We shall apply Proposition 2.3.4, but ﬁrst we need to show that B is a basis
for some topology on R2.
To do this we show that B satisﬁes the conditions of Proposition 2.2.8.

The ﬁrst thing we observe is that B is a basis for some topology
because it satisﬁes the conditions of Proposition 2.2.8. (To see that
B satisﬁes Proposition 2.2.8, observe that R2 equals the union of all
open equilateral triangles with base parallel to the X-axis, and that
the intersection of two such triangles is another such triangle.)
Next we shall show that the conditions (i) and (ii) of Proposition
2.3.4 are satisﬁed.
Firstly we verify condition (i). Let R be an open rectangle with
sides parallel to the axes and any x any point in R. We have to show
that there is an open equilateral triangle T with base parallel to the
X-axis such that x ∈T ⊆R. Pictorially this is easy to see.

Finally we verify condition (ii) of Proposition 2.3.4. Let T ′ be an
open equilateral triangle with base parallel to the X-axis and let y
be any point in T ′. Then there exists an open rectangle R′ such that
y ∈R′ ⊆T ′. Pictorially, this is again easy to see.

So the conditions of Proposition 2.3.4 are satisﬁed.
Thus B is
indeed a basis for the Euclidean topology on R2.
In Example 2.2.10 we deﬁned a basis for the Euclidean topology
to be the collection of all “open rectangles” (with sides parallel to the
axes). Example 2.3.5 shows that “open rectangles” can be replaced by
“open equilateral triangles” (with base parallel to the X-axis) without
changing the topology. In Exercises 2.3 #1 we see that the conditions
above in brackets can be dropped without changing the topology. Also
“open rectangles” can be replaced by “open discs”*.
Exercises 2.3
1.
Determine whether or not each of the following collections is a
basis for the Euclidean topology on R2 :
(i) the collection of all “open” squares with sides parallel to the
axes;
(ii) the collection of all “open” discs;
(iii) the collection of all “open” squares;
(iv) the collection of all “open” rectangles.
(v) the collection of all “open” triangles

2.4
Postscript
In this chapter we have deﬁned a very important topological space – R,
the set of all real numbers with the Euclidean topology, and spent some
time analyzing it. We observed that, in this topology, open intervals
are indeed open sets (and closed intervals are closed sets). However,
not all open sets are open intervals. Nevertheless, every open set in
R is a union of open intervals. This led us to introduce the notion of
“basis for a topology” and to establish that the collection of all open
intervals is a basis for the Euclidean topology on R.
In the introduction to Chapter 1 we described a mathematical
proof as a watertight argument and underlined the importance of writ-
ing proofs. In this chapter we introduced proof by contradiction in
Examples 2.1.2 (v) with another example in Example 2.2.7. Proving
“necessary and suﬃcient” conditions, that is, “if and only if” condi-
tions, was explained in Proposition 2.2.1, with further examples in
Propositions 2.2.8, 2.3.2, 2.3.3, and 2.3.4.
Bases for topologies is a signiﬁcant topic in its own right.
We
saw, for example, that the collection of all singletons is a basis for
the discrete topology. Proposition 2.2.8 gives necessary and suﬃcient
conditions for a collection of subsets of a set X to be a basis for some
topology on X. This was contrasted with Proposition 2.3.2 which gives
necessary and suﬃcient conditions for a collection of subsets of X to
be a basis for the given topology on X. It was noted that two diﬀerent
collections B1 and B2 can be bases for the same topology Necessary

38
Topology Without Tears
We deﬁned the Euclidean topology on Rn, for n any positive inte-
ger. We saw that the family of all open discs is a basis for R2, as is
the family of all open squares, or the family of all open rectangles.
The exercises introduced three interesting ideas.
Exercises 2.1
#8 covered the notions of Fσ-set and Gδ-set which are important in
measure theory. Exercises 2.3 #4 introduced the space of continuous
real-valued functions. Such spaces are called function spaces which are
the central objects of study in functional analysis. Functional analysis
is a blend of (classical) analysis and topology, and was for some time
called modern analysis. Finally, Exercises 2.3 #5–12 dealt with the
notion of subbasis.

On the real number line we have a notion of “closeness”. For example
each point in the sequence .1, .01, .001, .0001, .00001, . . . is closer to 0
than the previous one. Indeed, in some sense, 0 is a limit point of this
sequence. So the interval (0, 1] is not closed, as it does not contain
the limit point 0. In a general topological space we do not have a
“distance function”, so we must proceed diﬀerently. We shall deﬁne
the notion of limit point without resorting to distances. Even with our
new deﬁnition of limit point, the point 0 will still be a limit point of
(0, 1] . The introduction of the notion of limit point will lead us to a
much better understanding of the notion of closed set.
Another very important topological concept we shall introduce in
this chapter is that of connectedness. Consider the topological space
R. While the sets [0, 1] ∪[2, 3] and [4, 6] could both be described as
having length 2, it is clear that they are diﬀerent types of sets . . . the
ﬁrst consists of two disjoint pieces and the second of just one piece.
The diﬀerence between the two is “topological” and will be exposed
using the notion of connectedness.

Limit Points and Closure
3.1.1
Deﬁnition.
Let A be a subset of a topological space (X,τ).
A point* x ∈X is said to be a limit point (or accumulation point or
cluster point) of A if every open set, U, containing x contains a point
of A diﬀerent from x.
3.1.2
Example.
Consider the topological space (X,τ) where the
set X = {a, b, c, d, e}, τ = {X, Ø, {a}, {c, d}, {a, c, d}, {b, c, d, e}}, and
A = {a, b, c}. Then b, d, and e are limit points of A but a and c are
not.
Proof.
The point a is a limit point of A if and only if every open set containing a
contains another point of the set A.
So to show that a is not a limit point of A, it suﬃces to ﬁnd even one open
set which contains a but contains no other point of A.
The set {a} is open and contains no other point of A. So a is not
a limit point of A.
The set {c, d} is an open set containing c but no other point of A.
So c is not a limit point of A.
To show that b is a limit point of A, we have to show that every open set
containing b contains a point of A other than b.
We shall show this is the case by writing down all of the open sets containing
b and verifying that each contains a point of A other than b.
The only open sets containing b are X and {b, c, d, e} and both
contain another element of A, namely c. So b is a limit point of A.
The point d is also a limit point of A, even though it is not in
A. This is so since every open set containing d contains a point of A.
Similarly e is a limit point of A even though it is not in A.
* If (X τ) is a topological space then it is usual to refer to the elements of the set X as

Limit Points
41
3.1.3
Example.
Let (X,τ) be a discrete space and A a subset of
X. Then A has no limit points, since for each x ∈X, {x} is an open
set containing no point of A diﬀerent from x.
3.1.4
Example.
Consider the subset A = [a, b) of R. Then it is
easily veriﬁed that every element in [a, b) is a limit point of A. The
point b is also a limit point of A.
3.1.5
Example.
Let (X,τ) be an indiscrete space and A a subset
of X with at least two elements. Then it is readily seen that every
point of X is a limit point of A. (Why did we insist that A have at
least two points?)
The next proposition provides a useful way of testing whether a
set is closed or not.
3.1.6
Proposition.
Let A be a subset of a topological space
(X,τ). Then A is closed in (X,τ) if and only if A contains all of
its limit points.
Proof.
We are required to prove that A is closed in (X,τ) if and only if A contains
all of its limit points; that is, we have to show that
(i) if A is a closed set, then it contains all of its limit points, and
(ii) if A contains all of its limit points, then it is a closed set.
Assume that A is closed in (X,τ). Suppose that p is a limit point
of A which belongs to X \A. Then X \A is an open set containing the
limit point p of A. Therefore X \ A contains an element of A. This is
clearly false. Therefore every limit point of A must belong to A.
Conversely, assume that A contains all of its limit points.
For
each z ∈X \ A, our assumption implies that there exists an open
set Uz ∋z such that Uz ∩A = Ø; that is, Uz ⊆X \ A. Therefore
X \ A =

∈X\A Uz (Check this!) So X \ A is a union of open sets and

42

3.1.7
Example.
As applications of Proposition 3.1.6 we have the
following:
(i) the set [a, b) is not closed in R, since b is a limit point and b /∈[a, b);
(ii) the set [a, b] is closed in R, since all the limit points of [a, b] (namely
all the elements of [a, b]) are in [a, b];
(iii) (a, b) is not a closed subset of R, since it does not contain the limit
point a;
(iv) [a, ∞) is a closed subset of R.
3.1.8
Proposition.
Let A be a subset of a topological space
(X,τ) and A′ the set of all limit points of A. Then A ∪A′ is a closed
set.
Proof.
From Proposition 3.1.6 it suﬃces to show that the set A∪A′
contains all of its limit points or equivalently that no element of
X \ (A ∪A′) is a limit point of A ∪A′.
Let p ∈X \ (A ∪A′). As p /∈A′, there exists an open set U
containing p with U ∩A = {p} or Ø. But p /∈A, so U ∩A = Ø. We
claim also that U ∩A′ = Ø. For if x ∈U then as U is an open set and
U ∩A = Ø, x /∈A′. Thus U ∩A′ = Ø. That is, U ∩(A ∪A′) = Ø, and
p ∈U. This implies p is not a limit point of A ∪A′ and so A ∪A′ is a
closed set.
3.1.9
Deﬁnition.
Let A be a subset of a topological space (X,τ).
Then the set A ∪A′ consisting of A and all its limit points is called
the closure of A and is denoted by A.
3.1.10
Remark.
It is clear from Proposition 3.1.8 that A is a
closed set. By Proposition 3.1.6 and Exercises 3.1 #5 (i), every closed
set containing A must also contain the set A′. So A ∪A′ = A is the
smallest closed set containing A. This implies that A is the intersection
of all closed sets containing A.
3.1.11
Example.
Let X = {a, b, c, d, e} and
τ = {X, Ø, {a}, {c, d}, {a, c, d}, {b, c, d, e}}.
Show that {b} = {b, e}, {a, c} = X, and {b, d} = {b, c, d, e}.

Limit Points
43
Proof.
To ﬁnd the closure of a particular set, we shall ﬁnd all the closed sets containing
that set and then select the smallest. We therefore begin by writing down all of
the closed sets – these are simply the complements of all the open sets.
The closed sets are Ø, X, {b, c, d, e}, {a, b, e}, {b, e} and {a}.
So
the smallest closed set containing {b} is {b, e}; that is, {b} = {b, e}.
Similarly {a, c} = X, and {b, d} = {b, c, d, e}.
3.1.12
Example.
Let Q be the subset of R consisting of all the
rational numbers. Prove that Q = R.
Proof.
Suppose Q ̸= R. Then there exists an x ∈R \ Q. As R\Q is
open in R, there exist a, b with a < b such that x ∈(a, b) ⊆R \ Q. But
in every interval (a, b) there is a rational number q; that is, q ∈(a, b).
So q ∈R\Q which implies q ∈R\Q. This is a contradiction, as q ∈Q.
Hence Q = R.
3.1.13
Deﬁnition.
Let A be a subset of a topological space
(X,τ). Then A is said to be dense in X if A = X.
We can now restate Example 3.1.12 as: Q is a dense subset of R.
Note that in Example 3.1.11 we saw that {a, c} is dense in X.
3.1.14
Example.
Let (X,τ) be a discrete space.
Then every
subset of X is closed (since its complement is open). Therefore the
only dense subset of X is X itself, since each subset of X is its own
closure.
3.1.15
Proposition.
Let A be a subset of a topological space
(X,τ). Then A is dense in X if and only if every non-empty open
subset of X intersects A non-trivially (that is, if U ∈τ and U ̸= Ø
then A ∩U ̸= Ø.)
Proof.
Assume, ﬁrstly that every non-empty open set intersects A
non-trivially. If A = X, then clearly A is dense in X. If A ̸= X, let
x ∈X \A If U ∈τ and x ∈U then U ∩A ̸= Ø So x is a limit point of

44
Topology Without Tears
point of A. So A′ ⊇X \A and then, by Deﬁnition 3.9, A = A′∪A = X;
that is, A is dense in X.
Conversely, assume A is dense in X. Let U be any non-empty
open subset of X. Suppose U ∩A = Ø. Then if x ∈U, x /∈A and x
is not a limit point of A, since U is an open set containing x which
does not contain any element of A. This is a contradiction since, as
A is dense in X, every element of X \ A is a limit point of A. So our
supposition is false and U ∩A ̸= Ø, as required.

3.2
Neighbourhoods
3.2.1
Deﬁnition.
Let (X,τ) be a topological space, N a subset
of X and p a point in X. Then N is said to be a neighbourhood of the
point p if there exists an open set U such that p ∈U ⊆N.
3.2.2
Example.
The interval [0, 1] in R is a neighbourhood of the
point 1
2, since 1
2 ∈(1
4, 3
4) ⊆[0, 1].
3.2.3
Example.
The interval (0, 1] in R is a neighbourhood of the
point 1
4, since 1
4 ∈(0, 1
2) ⊆(0, 1]. But (0, 1] is not a neighbourhood of
the point 1. (Prove this.)
3.2.4
Example.
If (X,τ) is any topological space and U ∈τ,
then from Deﬁnition 3.2.1, it follows that U is a neighbourhood of
every point p ∈U. So, for example, every open interval (a, b) in R is a
neighbourhood of every point that it contains.
3.2.5
Example.
Let (X,τ) be a topological space, and N a neigh-
bourhood of a point p. If S is any subset of X such that N ⊆S, then
S is a neighbourhood of p.
The next proposition is easily veriﬁed so its proof is left to the

3.2.6
Proposition.
Let A be a subset of a topological space
(X,τ). A point x ∈X is a limit point of A if and only if every
neighbourhood of x contains a point of A diﬀerent from x.
As a set is closed if and only if it contains all its limit points we
deduce the following:
3.2.7
Corollary.
Let A be a subset of a topological space (X,τ).
Then the set A is closed if and only if for each x ∈X \ A there is a
neighbourhood N of x such that N ⊆X \ A.
3.2.8
Corollary.
Let U be a subset of a topological space (X,τ).
Then U ∈τ if and only if for each x ∈U there exists a neighbourhood
N of x such that N ⊆U.
The next corollary is readily deduced from Corollary 3.2.8.
3.2.9
Corollary.
Let U be a subset of a topological space (X,τ).
Then U ∈τ if and only if for each x ∈U there exists a V ∈τ such
that x ∈V ⊆U.
Corollary 3.2.9 provides a useful test of whether a set is open or
not. It says that a set is open if and only if it contains an open set
about each of its points.
Exercises 3.2

Let A be a subset of a topological space (X,τ). Prove that A is

3.3
Connectedness
3.3.1
Remark.
We record here some deﬁnitions and facts you
should already know. Let S be any set of real numbers. If there is an
element b in S such that x ≤b, for all x ∈S, then b is said to be the
greatest element of S. Similarly if S contains an element a such that
a ≤x, for all x ∈S, then a is called the least element of S. A set S of
real numbers is said to be bounded above if there exists a real number
c such that x ≤c, for all x ∈S, and c is called an upper bound for S.
Similarly the terms “bounded below” and “lower bound” are deﬁned. A
set which is bounded above and bounded below is said to be bounded.
Least Upper Bound Axiom:
Let S be a non-empty set of real

Limit Points
49
The least upper bound, also called the supremum of S, may or may
not belong to the set S. Indeed, the supremum of S is an element of
S if and only if S has a greatest element. For example, the supremum
of the open interval S = (1, 2) is 2 but 2 /∈(1, 2), while the supremum
of [3, 4] is 4 which does lie in [3, 4] and 4 is the greatest element of
[3, 4]. Any set of real numbers which is bounded below has a greatest
lower bound which is also called the inﬁmum.
3.3.2
Lemma.
Let S be a subset of R which is bounded above
and let p be the supremum of S. If S is a closed subset of R, then
p ∈S.
Proof.
Suppose p ∈R\S. As R\S is open there exist real numbers
a and b with a < b such that p ∈(a, b) ⊆R \ S. As p is the least
upper bound for S and a < p, it is clear that there exists an x ∈S
such that a < x. Also x < p < b, and so x ∈(a, b) ⊆R \ S. But this is
a contradiction, since x ∈S. Hence our supposition is false and p ∈S.
3.3.3
Proposition.
Let T be a clopen subset of R. Then either
T = R or T = Ø.
Proof.
Suppose T ̸= R and T ̸= Ø. Then there exists an element
x ∈T and an element z ∈R \ T. Without loss of generality, assume
x < z. Put S = T ∩[x, z]. Then S, being the intersection of two closed
sets, is closed. It is also bounded above, since z is obviously an upper
bound. Let p be the supremum of S. By Lemma 3.3.2, p ∈S. Since
p ∈[x, z], p ≤z. As z ∈R \ S, p ̸= z and so p < z.
Now T is also an open set and p ∈T.
So there exist a and b
in R with a < b such that p ∈(a, b) ⊆T.
Let t be such that
p < t < min(b, z), where min(b, z) denotes the smaller of b and z.
So t ∈T and t ∈[p, z]. Thus t ∈T ∩[x, z] = S. This is a contradiction
since t > p and p is the supremum of S. Hence our supposition is false
and consequently T = R or T = Ø.
3.3.4
Deﬁnition.
Let (X,τ) be a topological space. Then it is
said to be connected if the only clopen subsets of X are X and Ø.
So restating Proposition 3.3.3 we obtain:

50
Topology Without Tears
3.3.6
Example.
If (X,τ) is any discrete space with more than one
element, then (X,τ) is not connected as each singleton set is clopen.
3.3.7
Example.
If (X,τ) is any indiscrete space, then it is con-
nected as the only clopen sets are X and Ø. (Indeed the only open
sets are X and Ø.)
3.3.8
Example.
If X = {a, b, c, d, e} and
τ = {X, Ø, {a}, {c, d}, {a, c, d}, {b, c, d, e}},
then (X,τ) is not connected as {b, c, d, e} is a clopen subset.
3.3.9
Remark.
From Deﬁnition 3.3.4 it follows that a topological
space (X,τ) is not connected (that is, it is disconnected) if and only
if there are non-empty open sets A and B such that A ∩B = Ø and
A ∪B = X. (See Exercises 3.3 #3.)*
We conclude this section by recording that R2 (and indeed, Rn,
for each n ≥1) is a connected space. However the proof is delayed to
Chapter 5.
Connectedness is a very important property about which we shall
say a lot more.

1. Let S be a set of real numbers and T = {x : −x ∈S}.
(a) Prove that the real number a is the inﬁmum of S if and only
if −a is the supremum of T.
(b) Using (a) and the Least Upper Bound Axiom prove that every
non-empty set of real numbers which is bounded below has a

(X,τ) connected?

(X,τ) connected?
7. Which of the topological spaces of Exercises 1.1 #9 are connected?
3.4
Postscript
In this chapter we have introduced the notion of limit point and shown
that a set is closed if and only if it contains all its limit points.
Proposition 3.1.8 then tells us that any set A has a smallest closed
set A which contains it. The set A is called the closure of A.
A subset A of a topological space (X,τ) is said to be dense in
X if A = X.
We saw that Q is dense in R and the set P of all
irrational numbers is also dense in R. We introduced the notion of
neighbourhood of a point and the notion of connected topological
space. We proved an important result, namely that R is connected.
We shall have much more to say about connectedness later.
In the exercises we introduced the notion of interior of a set, this
being complementary to that of closure of a set.

In each branch of mathematics it is essential to recognize when two
structures are equivalent. For example two sets are equivalent, as far
as set theory is concerned, if there exists a bijective function which
maps one set onto the other. Two groups are equivalent, known as
isomorphic, if there exists a a homomorphism of one to the other which
is one-to-one and onto. Two topological spaces are equivalent, known
as homeomorphic, if there exists a homeomorphism of one onto the
other.

4.1
Subspaces
4.1.1
Deﬁnition.
Let Y be a non-empty subset of a topological
space (X,τ). The collection τY = {O ∩Y : O ∈τ} of subsets of Y is
a topology on Y called the subspace topology (or the relative topology
or the induced topology or the topology induced on Y by τ).
The topological space (Y,τY ) is said to be a subspace of (X,τ).
Of course you should check that TY is indeed a topology on Y .
4.1.2
Example.
Let X = {a, b, c, d, e, f, },
τ = {X, Ø, {a}, {c, d}, {a, c, d}, {b, c, d, e, f}}
and Y = {b, c, e}. Then the subspace topology on Y is
τY = {Y, Ø, {c}}.
4.1.3
Example.
Let X = {a, b, c, d, e},
τ = {X, Ø, {a}, {c, d}, {a, c, d}, {b, c, d, e}},
and Y = {a, d, e}. Then the induced topology on Y is
τY = {Y, Ø, {a}, {d}, {a, d}, {d, e}}.
4.1.4
Example.
Let B be a basis for the topology τ on X and let
Y be a subset of X. Then it is not hard to show that the collection
BY = {B ∩Y : B ∈B} is a basis for the subspace topology τY on Y .
[Exercise: verify this.]
So let us consider the subset (1, 2) of R. A basis for the induced
topology on (1, 2) is the collection {(a, b) ∩(1, 2) : a, b ∈R, a < b};
that is, {(a, b) : a, b ∈R, 1 ≤a < b ≤2} is a basis for the induced
topology on (1, 2).
4.1.5
Example.
Consider the subset [1, 2] of R. A basis for the
subspace topology τ on [1, 2] is
{(a, b) ∩[1, 2] : a, b ∈R, a < b};

Homeomorphisms
55
that is,
{(a, b) : 1 ≤a < b ≤2}∪{[1, b) : 1 < b ≤2}∪{(a, 2] : 1 ≤a < 2}∪{[1, 2]}
is a basis for τ.
But here we see some surprising things happening; e.g. [1, 11
2) is
certainly not an open set in R, but [1, 11
2) = (0, 11
2) ∩[1, 2], [1, 11
2) is
an open set in the subspace [1, 2].
Also (1, 2] is not open in R but is open in [1, 2]. Even [1, 2] is not
open in R, but is an open set in [1, 2].
So whenever we speak of a set being open we must make perfectly
clear in what space or what topology it is an open set.
4.1.6
Example.
Let Z be the subset of R consisting of all the
integers.
Prove that the topology induced on Z by the Euclidean
topology on R is the discrete topology.
Proof.
To prove that the induced topology, τZ, on Z is discrete, it suﬃces, by
Proposition 1.1.9, to show that every singleton set in Z is open in τZ; that is, if
n ∈Z then {n} ∈τZ
Let n ∈Z.
Then {n} = (n −1, n + 1) ∩Z. But (n −1, n + 1)
is open in R and therefore {n} is open in the induced topology on Z.
Thus every singleton set in Z is open in the induced topology on Z.
So the induced topology is discrete.
Notation.
Whenever we refer to
Q = the set of all rational numbers,
Z = the set of all integers,
N = the set of all positive integers,
P = the set of all irrational numbers,
(a, b), [a, b], [a, b), (−∞, a), (−∞, a], (a, ∞), or [a, ∞)
as topological spaces without explicitly saying what the topology is, we
mean the topology induced as a subspace of R. (Sometimes we shall
refer to the induced topology on these sets as the “usual topology”.)

complements of these closed sets form a topology τ on R which
is Hausdorﬀbut not regular.
4.2
Homeomorphisms
We now turn to the notion of equivalent topological spaces. We begin
by considering an example:
X = {a, b, c, d, e},
Y = {g, h, i, j, k},
τ = {X, Ø, {a}, {c, d}, {a, c, d}.{b, c, d, e}}
and
τ1 = {Y, Ø, {g}, {i, j}, {g, i, j}, {h, i, j, k}}.
It is clear that in an intuitive sense (X,τ) is “equivalent” to (Y,τ1).
The function f: X →Y deﬁned by f(a) = g, f(b) = h, f(c) =
i, f(d) = j, and f(e) = k, provides the equivalence. We now formalize
this.
4.2.1
Deﬁnition.
Let (X,τ) and (Y,τ1) be topological spaces.
Then they are said to be homeomorphic if there exists a function
f : X →Y which has the following properties:
(i) f is one-to-one (that is f(x1) = f(x2) implies x1 = x2),
(ii) f is onto (that is, for any y ∈Y there exists an x ∈X such that
f(x) = y),
(iii) for each U ∈τ1, f −1(U) ∈τ, and
(iv) for each V ∈τ, f(V ) ∈τ1.
Further, the map f is said to be a homeomorphism between (X,τ) and
(Y,τ1). We write (X,τ) ∼= (Y,τ1).
We shall show that “∼=” is an equivalence relation and use this to
show that all open intervals (a, b) are homeomorphic to each other.
Example 4.2.2 is the ﬁrst step, as it shows that “∼=” is a transitive
relation.

Homeomorphisms
59
4.2.2
Example.
Let (X,τ), (Y,τ1) and (Z,τ2) be topological
spaces. If (X,τ) ∼= (Y,τ1) and (Y,τ1) ∼= (Z,τ2), prove that (X,τ) ∼=
(Z, T2).
Proof.
We are given that (X,τ) ∼= (Y,τ1); that is, there exists a homeomorphism
f : (X,τ) →(Y,τ1). We are also given that (Y,τ1) ∼= (Z,τ2); that is, there
exists a homeomorphism g : (Y,τ1) →(Z,τ2).
We are required to prove that (X,τ) ∼= (Z,τ2); that is, we need to ﬁnd a
homeomorphism h : (X,τ) →(Z,τ2). We will prove that the composite map
g ◦f : X →Z is the required homeomorphism.
As (X,τ) ∼= (Y,τ1) and (Y,τ1) ∼= (Z,τ2), there exist homeomor-
phisms f : (X, T ) →(Y,τ1) and g : (Y,τ1) →(Z,τ2). Consider the
composite map g◦f : X →Z. [Thus g◦f(x) = g(f(x)), for all x ∈X.]
It is a routine task to verify that g ◦f is one-to-one and onto. Now
let U ∈τ2. Then, as g is a homeomorphism g−1(U) ∈τ1. Using the
fact that f is a homeomorphism we obtain that f −1(g−1(U)) ∈τ. But
f −1(g−1(U)) = (g ◦f)−1(U). So g ◦f has property (iii) of Deﬁnition
4.2.1. Next let V ∈τ. Then f(V ) ∈T1 and so g(f(V )) ∈τ2; that
is g ◦f(V ) ∈τ2 and we see that g ◦f has property (iv) of Deﬁnition
4.2.1. Hence g ◦f is a homeomorphism.
4.2.3
Remark.
Example 4.2.2 shows that “∼=” is a transitive
relation. Indeed it is easily veriﬁed that it is an equivalence relation;
that is,
(i) (X,τ) ∼= (X,τ)
[Reﬂexive]
(ii) (X,τ) ∼= (Y,τ1) implies (Y,τ1) ∼= (X,τ)
[Symmetric]
[Observe that if f : (X,τ) →(Y,τ1) is a homeomorphism, then its
inverse f −1 : (Y,τ1) →(X,τ) is also a homeomorphism.]
(iii) (X,τ) ∼= (Y,τ1) and (Y,τ1) ∼= (Z,τ2) implies (X,τ) ∼= (Z,τ2).
[Transitive].
The next three examples show that all open intervals in R are
homeomorphic.
Length is certainly not a topological property.
In
particular, an open interval of ﬁnite length, such as (0, 1), is homeo-
morphic to one of inﬁnite length, such as (−∞, 1). Indeed all open
intervals are homeomorphic to R.

4.2.4
Example.
Prove that any two non-empty open intervals
(a, b) and (c, d) are homeomorphic.
Outline Proof.
By Remark 4.2.3 it suﬃces to show that (a, b) is homeomorphic to (0, 1) and
(c, d) is homeomorphic to (0, 1). But as a and b are arbitrary (except that a < b),
if (a, b) is homeomorphic to (0, 1) then (c, d) is also homeomorphic to (0, 1). To
prove that (a, b) is homeomorphic to (0, 1) it suﬃces to ﬁnd a homeomorphism
f : (0, 1) →(a, b).
Let a, b, ∈R
with a < b and consider the function f : (0, 1) →
(a, b) given by f(x) = a(1 −x) + bx.
...............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Clearly f : (0, 1) →(a, b) is one-to-one and onto. It is also clear from
the diagram that the image under f of any open interval in (0, 1) is an
open interval in (a, b); that is,
f(open interval in (0, 1)) = an open interval in (a, b).
But every open set in (0, 1) is a union of open intervals in (0, 1)
and so
f(open set in (0, 1)) = f(union of open intervals in (0, 1))
= union of open intervals in (a, b)
= open set in (a, b).
So condition (iv) of Deﬁnition 4.2.1 is satisﬁed. Similarly, we see that
f −1 (open set in (a, b)) is an open set in (0, 1). So condition (iii) of
Deﬁnition 4.2.1 is also satisﬁed.
[Exercise:
write out the above proof carefully.]

Homeomorphisms
61
Hence f is a homeomorphism and (0, 1) ∼= (a, b), for all a, b ∈R
with a < b.
From the above it immediately follows that (a, b) ∼= (c, d), as
required.
4.2.5
Example.
Prove that the space R is homeomorphic to the
open interval (−1, 1) with the usual topology.
Outline Proof.
Deﬁne f : (−1, 1) →R by
f(x) =
x
1−| x |.
It is readily veriﬁed that f is one-to-one and onto, and a diagrammatic
argument like that in Example 4.2.2 indicates that f is a homeomor-
phism.

4.3
Non-Homeomorphic Spaces
To prove two topological spaces are homeomorphic we have to ﬁnd a
homeomorphism between them.
But, to prove that two topological spaces are not homeomorphic is
often much harder as we have to show that no homeomorphism exists.
The following example gives us a clue as to how we might go about
showing this.
4.3.1
Example.
Prove that [0, 2] is not homeomorphic to the
subspace [0, 1] ∪[2, 3] of R.
Proof.
Let (X,τ) = [0, 2] and (Y,τ1) = [0, 1] ∪[2, 3]. Then
[0, 1] = [0, 1] ∩Y ⇒[0, 1] is closed in (Y,τ1)

64
Topology Without Tears
and
[0, 1] = (−1, 11/2) ∩Y ⇒[0, 1] is open in (Y,τ1).
Thus Y is not connected, as it has [0, 1] as a proper non-empty clopen
subset.
Suppose that (X,τ) ∼= (Y,τ1). Then there exists a homeomor-
phism f: (X,τ) →(Y,τ1).
So f −1([0, 1]) is a clopen subset of X,
and hence X is not connected.
This is false as [0, 2] = X is con-
nected. (See Exercises 4.1 #15.) So we have a contradiction and thus
(X,τ) ̸∼= (Y,τ1).
What do we learn from this?
4.3.2
Proposition.
Any topological space homeomorphic to a
connected space is connected.
Proposition 4.3.2 gives us one way to try to show two topological
spaces are not homeomorphic . . . by ﬁnding a property “preserved by
homeomorphisms” which one space has and the other does not.
Amongst the exercises we have met many properties “preserved
by homeomorphisms”:
(i) T0-space;
(ii) T1-space;
(iii) T2-space or Hausdorﬀspace;
(iv) regular space;
(v) T3-space;
(vi) satisfying the second axiom of countability;
(vii) separable space. [See Exercises 4.2 #7.]
There are also others:
(viii) discrete space;
(ix) indiscrete space;
(x) ﬁnite-closed topology;
(xi) countable-closed topology.
So together with connectedness we know twelve properties pre-
served by homeomorphisms. Also two spaces (X,τ) and (Y,τ1) cannot
be homeomorphic if X and Y have diﬀerent cardinalities or if τ and τ1
have diﬀerent cardinalities, e.g. X is countable and Y is uncountable.

Homeomorphisms
65
Nevertheless when faced with a speciﬁc problem we may not have
the one we need. For example, show that (0, 1) is not homeomorphic
to [0, 1] or show that R is not homeomorphic to R2. We shall see how
to show that these spaces are not homeomorphic shortly.
Before moving on to this let us settle the following question: which
subspaces of R are connected?
4.3.3
Deﬁnition.
A subset S of R is said to be an interval if it
has the following property: if x ∈S, z ∈S, and y ∈R are such that
x < y < z, then y ∈S.
4.3.4
Remarks. (i) Note that each singleton set {x} is an interval.
(ii) Every interval has one of the following forms: {a}, [a, b], (a, b),
[a, b), (a, b], (−∞, a), (−∞, a], (a, ∞), [a, ∞), (−∞, ∞).
(iii) It follows from Example 4.2.6, Remark 4.2.7, and Exercises
4.2 #1, that every interval is homeomorphic to (0, 1), [0, 1],
[0, 1), or {0}. In Exercises 4.3 #1 we are able to make an even
stronger statement.
4.3.5
Proposition.
A subspace S of R is connected if and only
if it is an interval.
Proof.
That all intervals are connected can be proved in a similar
fashion to Proposition 3.3.3 by replacing R everywhere in the proof by
the interval we are trying to prove connected.
Conversely, let S be connected. Suppose x ∈S, z ∈S, x < y < z,
and y /∈S. Then (−∞, y) ∩S = (−∞, y] ∩S is an open and closed
subset of S. So S has a clopen subset, namely (−∞, y) ∩S. To show
that S is not connected we have to verify only that this clopen set is
proper and non-empty. It is non-empty as it contains x. It is proper
as z ∈S but z /∈(−∞, y) ∩S.
So S is not connected.
This is a
contradiction. Therefore S is an interval.
We now see a reason for the name “connected”. Subspaces of R
such as [a, b], (a, b), etc. are connected, while subspaces like
X = [0, 1] ∪[2, 3] ∪[5, 6]
which is a union of “disconnected” pieces, are not connected.
Now let us turn to the problem of showing that (0, 1) ̸∼= [0, 1].
Firstly, we present a seemingly trivial observation.

66
Topology Without Tears
4.3.6
Remark.
Let f : (X,τ) →(Y,τ1) be a homeomorphism.
Let a ∈X, so that X\{a} is a subspace of X and has induced topology
τ2. Also Y \ {f(a)} is a subspace of Y and has induced topology τ3.
Then (X \ {a},τ2) is homeomorphic to (Y \ {f(a)},τ3).
Outline Proof.
Deﬁne g: X \ {a} →Y \ {f(a)} by g(x) = f(x), for
all x ∈X \ {a}. Then it is easily veriﬁed that g is a homeomorphism.
(Write down a proof of this.)
As an immediate consequence of this we have:
4.3.7
Corollary.
If a, b, c, and d are real numbers with a < b and
c < d, then
(i) (a, b) ̸∼= [c, d),
(ii) (a, b) ̸∼= [c, d], and
(iii) [a, b) ̸∼= [c, d].
Proof.
(i)
Let (X,τ) = [c, d) and (Y,τ1) = (a, b). Suppose that
(X,τ) ∼= (Y,τ1). Then X \ {c} ∼= Y \ {y}, for some y ∈Y . But,
X \ {c} = (c, d), an interval, and so is connected, while no matter
which point we remove from (a, b) the resultant space is disconnected.
Hence
X \ {c} ̸∼= Y \ {y}, for each y ∈Y.
This is a contradiction. So [c, d) ̸∼= (a, b).
(ii)
[c, d] \ {c} is connected, while (a, b) \ {y} is disconnected for
all y ∈(a, b). Thus (a, b) ̸∼= [c, d].
(iii)
Suppose that [a, b) ∼= [c, d]. Then [c, d]\ {c} ∼= [a, b)\ {y} for
some y ∈[a, b). Therefore ([c, d] \ {c}) \ {d} ∼= ([a, b) \ {y}) \ {z}, for
some z ∈[a, b) \ {y}; that is, (c, d) ∼= [a, b) \ {y, z}, for some distinct
y and z in [a, b). But (c, d) is connected, while [a, b) \ {y, z}, for any
two distinct points y and z in [a, b), is disconnected. So we have a
contradiction. Therefore [a, b) ̸∼= [c, d].

a subspace homeomorphic to (N,τ4) where τ4 is the indiscrete

one of the two topologies described in (iv), known as the initial
segment topology and the ﬁnal segment topology, respectively.
Further, no two of these ﬁve topologies on N are homeomor-
phic.
4.4
Postscript
There are three important ways of creating new topological spaces
from old ones: forming subspaces, products, and quotient spaces. We
examine all three in due course. Forming subspaces was studied in this
section. This allowed us to introduce the important spaces Q, [a, b],
(a, b), etc.
We deﬁned the central notion of homeomorphism. We noted that
“∼=” is an equivalence relation. A property is said to be topological
if it is preserved by homeomorphisms; that is, if (X, T ) ∼= (Y,τ1)
and (X,τ) has the property then (Y, T1) must also have the property.
Connectedness was shown to be a topological property. So any space
homeomorphic to a connected space is connected. (A number of other
topological properties were also identiﬁed.) We formally deﬁned the
notion of an interval in R, and showed that the intervals are precisely
the connected subspaces of R.

Homeomorphisms
69
Given two topological spaces (X,τ) and (Y,τ1) it is an interesting
task to show whether they are homeomorphic or not. We proved that
every interval in R is homeomorphic to one and only one of [0, 1],
(0, 1), [0, 1), and {0}.
In the next section we show that R is not
homeomorphic to R2. A tougher problem is to show that R2 is not
homeomorphic to R3. This will be done later via the Jordan curve
theorem. Still the cr`eme de la cr`eme is the fact that Rn ∼= Rm if and
only if n = m. This is best approached via algebraic topology, which
is only touched upon in this book.
Exercises 4.2 #6 introduced the notion of group of homeomor-
phisms, which is an interesting and important topic in its own right.

CHAPTER 5
Continuous Mappings
In most branches of pure mathematics we study what in category the-
ory are called “objects” and “arrows”. In linear algebra the objects
are the vector spaces and the arrows are the linear transformations.
In group theory the objects are groups and the arrows are homomor-
phisms, while in set theory the objects are sets and the arrows are
functions. In topology the objects are the topological spaces. We now
introduce the arrows . . . the continuous mappings.

Topology Without Tears
5.1
Continuous Mappings
Of course we are already familiar with the notion of a continuous
function from R into R.*
A function f : R →R is said to be continuous if for each a ∈R
and each positive real number ε, there exists a positive real number δ
such that | x −a |< δ implies | f(x) −f(a) |< ε.
It is not at all obvious how to generalize this deﬁnition to general
topological spaces where we do not have “absolute value” or “subtrac-
tion”. So we shall seek another (equivalent) deﬁnition of continuity
which lends itself more to generalization.
It is easily seen that f : R →R is continuous if and only if for each
a ∈R and each interval (f(a) −ε, f(a) + ε), for ε > 0, there exists a
δ > 0 such that f(x) ∈(f(a) −ε , f(a) + ε) for all x ∈(a −δ , a + δ).
This deﬁnition is an improvement since it does not involve the
concept “absolute value” but it still involves “subtraction”. The next
lemma shows how to avoid subtraction.
5.1.1
Lemma.
Let f be a function mapping R into itself. Then
f is continuous if and only if for each a ∈R and each open set U
containing f(a), there exists an open set V containing a such that
f(V ) ⊆U.
Proof.
Assume that f is continuous. Let a ∈R and let U be any
open set containing f(a). Then there exist real numbers c and d such
that f(a) ∈(c, d) ⊆U. Put ε equal to the smaller of the two numbers
d −f(a) and f(a) −c, so that
(f(a) −ε , f(a) + ε) ⊆U.
As the mapping f is continuous there exists a δ > 0 such that f(x) ∈
(f(a) −ε , f(a) + ε) for all x ∈(a −δ , a + δ). Let V be the open set
(a −δ , a + δ). Then a ∈V and f(V ) ⊆U, as required.
Conversely assume that for each a ∈R and each open set U
containing f(a) there exists an open set V containing a such that
f(V ) ⊆U. We have to show that f is continuous. Let a ∈R and
*The early part of this section assumes that you have some knowledge of real analysis and,
in particular, the ε–δ deﬁnition of continuity. If this is not the case, then proceed directly
to Deﬁnition 5.1.3.

Continuous Mappings
73
ε be any positive real number. Put U = (f(a) −ε , f(a) + ε). So U
is an open set containing f(a). Therefore there exists an open set V
containing a such that f(V ) ⊆U. As V is an open set containing
a, there exist real numbers c and d such that a ∈(c, d) ⊆V . Put
δ equal to the smaller of the two numbers d −a and a −c, so that
(a −δ , a + δ) ⊆V . Then for all x ∈(a −δ , a + δ), f(x) ∈f(V ) ⊆U,
as required. So f is continuous.
We could use the property described in Lemma 5.1.1 to deﬁne
continuity, however the following lemma allows us to make a more
elegant deﬁnition.
5.1.2
Lemma.
Let f be a mapping of a topological space (X,τ)
into a topological space (Y,τ ′). Then the following two conditions are
equivalent:
(i) for each U ∈τ ′, f −1(U) ∈τ,
(ii) for each a ∈X and each U ∈τ ′ with f(a) ∈U, there exists a
V ∈τ such that a ∈V and f(V ) ⊆U.
Proof.
Assume that condition (i) is satisﬁed. Let a ∈X and U ∈τ′
with f(a) ∈U. Then f −1(U) ∈τ. Put V = f −1(U), and we have that
a ∈V, V ∈τ, and f(V ) ⊆U. So condition (ii) is satisﬁed.
Conversely, assume that condition (ii) is satisﬁed. Let U ∈τ ′. If
f −1(U) = Ø then clearly f −1(U) ∈τ. If f −1(U) ̸= Ø, let a ∈f −1(U).
Then f(a) ∈U. Therefore there exists a V ∈τ such that a ∈V and
f(V ) ⊆U. So for each a ∈f −1(U) there exists a V ∈τ such that
a ∈V ⊆f −1(U). By Corollary 3.2.9 this implies that f −1(U) ∈τ. So
condition (i) is satisﬁed.
So putting together Lemmas 5.1.1 and 5.1.2 we see that f : R →R
is continuous if and only if for each open subset U of R, f −1(U) is an
open set.
This leads us to deﬁne the notion of a continuous function between
two topological spaces as follows:
5.1.3
Deﬁnition.
Let (X,τ) and (Y,τ1) be topological spaces
and f a function from X into Y . Then f : (X,τ) →(Y,τ1) is said to
be a continuous mapping if for each U ∈τ1, f −1(U) ∈τ.

74
Topology Without Tears
From the above remarks we see that this deﬁnition of continuity
coincides with the usual deﬁnition when (X,τ) = (Y,τ1) = R.
Let us go through a few easy examples to see how nice this deﬁni-
tion of continuity is to apply in practice.
Example 5.1.4. Consider f : R →R given by f(x) = x, for all
x ∈R; that is, f is the identity function. Then for any open set U in
R, f −1(U) = U and so is open. Hence f is continuous.
5.1.5
Example.
Let f : R →R be given by f(x) = c, for c a
constant, and all x ∈R. Then let U be any open set in R. Clearly
f −1(U) = R if c ∈U and Ø if c ̸∈U. In both cases, f −1(U) is open.
So f is continuous.
5.1.6
Example.
Consider f : R →R deﬁned by
f(x) =
 x −1,
if x ≤3
1
2(x + 5),
if x > 3.

Recall that a mapping is continuous if and only if the inverse image of every
open set is an open set.
Therefore, to show f is not continuous we have to ﬁnd only one set U such
that f −1(U) is not open.
Then f −1((1, 3)) = (2, 3], which is not an open set. Therefore f is
not continuous.
Note that Lemma 5.1.2 can now be restated in the following way.*
* If you have not read Lemma 5.1.2 and its proof you should do so now.

Continuous Mappings

5.1.7
Proposition.
Let f be a mapping of a topological space
(X,τ) into a space (Y,τ ′). Then f is continuous if and only if for
each x ∈X and each U ∈τ ′ with f(x) ∈U, there exists a V ∈τ such
that x ∈V and f(V ) ⊆U.
5.1.8
Proposition.
Let (X,τ), (Y,τ1) and (Z,τ2) be topological
spaces. If f : (X,τ) →(Y,τ1) and g : (Y, T1) →(Z,τ2) are continuous
mappings, then the composite function g ◦f : (X,τ) →(Z,τ2) is
continuous.
Proof.
To prove that the composite function g ◦f : (X,τ) →(Z,τ2) is continuous,
we have to show that if U ∈τ2, then (g ◦f)−1(U) ∈τ.
But (g ◦f)−1(U) = f −1(g−1(U)).
Let U be open in (Z,τ2). Since g is continuous, g−1(U) is open
in τ1.
Then f −1(g−1(U)) is open in τ as f is continuous.
But
f −1(g−1(U)) = (g ◦f)−1(U). Thus g ◦f is continuous.
The next result shows that continuity can be described in terms
of closed sets instead of open sets if we wish.
5.1.9
Proposition.
Let (X,τ) and (Y,τ1) be topological spaces.
Then f : (X,τ) →(Y,τ1) is continuous if and only if for every closed
subset S of Y, f −1(S) is a closed subset of X.
Proof.
This results follows immediately once you recognise that
f −1(complement of S) = complement of f −1(S).
5.1.10
Remark.
There is a relationship between continuous maps
and homeomorphisms: if f : (X,τ) →(Y,τ1) is a homeomorphism
then it is a continuous map. Of course not every continuous map is a
homeomorphism.
However the following proposition, whose proof follows from the
deﬁnitions of “continuous” and “homeomorphism” tells the full story.

(iii) f −1 is continuous.
A useful result is the following proposition which tells us that the
restriction of a continuous map is a continuous map. Its routine proof
is left to the reader – see also Exercise Set 5.1 #8.

than T1) if τ1 ⊇τ2. Prove that
(i) the Euclidean topology on R is ﬁner than the ﬁnite-closed
topology on R;
(ii) the identity function f : (X,τ1) →(X,τ2) is continuous if and
only if τ1 is a ﬁner topology than τ2.

(Y,τ1) a continuous map. If f is one-to-one, prove that
(i) (Y,τ1) Hausdorﬀimplies (X,τ) Hausdorﬀ.
(ii) (Y,τ1) a T1-space implies (X,τ) is a T1-space.

13. Let (X,τ) and (Y,τ1) be topological spaces and let f be a mapping
of (X,τ) into (Y,τ1). Prove that f is continuous if and only if for
every subset A of X, f(A) ⊆f(A).
[Hint: Use Proposition 5.1.9.]
5.2
Intermediate Value Theorem
5.2.1
Proposition.
Let (X,τ) and (Y,τ1) be topological spaces
and f : (X,τ) →(Y,τ1) surjective and continuous.
If (X,τ) is
connected, then (Y,τ1) is connected.
Proof.
Suppose (Y,τ1) is not connected.
Then it has a clopen
subset U such that U ̸= Ø and U ̸= Y . Then f −1(U) is an open set,
since f is continuous, and also a closed set, by Proposition 5.1.9; that
is, f −1(U) is a clopen subset of X. Now f −1(U) ̸= Ø as f is surjective
and U ̸= Ø. Also f −1(U) ̸= X, since if it were U would equal Y , by the
surjectivity of f. Thus (X,τ) is not connected. This is a contradiction.
Therefore (Y,τ1) is connected.
5.2.2
Remarks.
(i)
The above proposition would be false if the
condition “surjective” were dropped. (Find an example of this.)
(ii) Simply put, Proposition 5.2.1 says: any continuous image of a
connected set is connected.
(iii) Proposition 5.2.1 tells us that if (X,τ) is a connected space
and (Y,τ′) is not connected (i.e. disconnected) then there exists
no mapping of (X,τ) onto (Y,τ′) which is continuous.
For
example, while there are an inﬁnite number of mappings of
R onto Q (or onto Z), none of them are continuous. Indeed
in Exercise Set 5.2 # 10 we observe that the only continuous
mappings of R into Q (or into Z) are the constant mappings.
The following strengthened version of the notion of connectedness
is often useful.
5.2.3
Deﬁnition.
A topological space (X,τ) is said to be path-
connected (or pathwise connected) if for each pair of distinct points a
and b of X there exists a continuous mapping f : [0, 1] →(X,τ), such
that f(0) = a and f(1) = b. The mapping f is said to be a path joining
a to b.

Continuous Mappings
79
5.2.4
Example.
It is readily seen that every interval is path-
connected.
5.2.5
Example.
For each n ≥1, Rn is path-connected.
5.2.6
Proposition.
Every path-connected space is connected.
Proof.
Let (X,τ) be a path-connected space and suppose that it
is not connected. Then it has a proper non-empty clopen subset U.
So there exist a and b such that a ∈U and b ∈X \ U. As (X,τ) is
path-connected there exists a continuous function f : [0, 1] →(X,τ)
such that f(0) = a and f(1) = b. Then f −1(U) is a clopen subset
of [0, 1].
As a ∈U, 0 ∈f −1(U) and so f −1(U) ̸= Ø.
As b ̸∈U,
1 ̸∈f −1(U) and thus f −1(U) ̸= [0, 1]. Hence f −1(U) is a proper non-
empty clopen subset of [0, 1], which contradicts the connectedness of
[0, 1]. Consequently (X,τ) is connected.
5.2.7
Remark.
The converse of Proposition 5.2.6 is false; that is,
not every connected space is path-connected. An example of such a
space is the following subspace of R2:
X = {⟨x, y⟩: y = sin(1/x), 0 < x ≤1} ∪{⟨0, y⟩: −1 ≤y ≤1}.
[Exercise Set 5.2 #6 shows that X is connected. That X is not path-
connected can be seen by showing that there is no path joining ⟨0, 0⟩
to, say, the point ⟨1/π, 0⟩. Draw a picture and try to convince yourself
of this.]
We can now show that R ̸∼= R2.
5.2.8
Example.
Clearly R2\{⟨0, 0⟩} is path-connected and hence,
by Proposition 5.2.6, is connected. However R \ {a}, for any a ∈R, is
disconnected. Hence R ̸∼= R2.
We now present the Weierstrass Intermediate Value Theorem which
is a beautiful application of topology to the theory of functions of a
real variable. The topological concept crucial to the result is that of
connectedness.

80
Topology Without Tears
5.2.9
Theorem. (Weierstrass Intermediate Value Theorem)
Let f : [a, b] →R be continuous and let f(a) ̸= f(b). Then for every
number p between f(a) and f(b) there is a point c ∈[a, b] such that
f(c) = p.
Proof.
As [a, b] is connected and f is continuous, Proposition 5.13
says that f([a, b]) is connected. By Proposition 4.3.5 this implies that
f([a, b]) is an interval.
Now f(a) and f(b) are in f([a, b]).
So if p
is between f(a) and f(b), p ∈f([a, b]), that is, p = f(c), for some
c ∈[a, b].
5.2.10
Corollary.
If f : [a, b] →R is continuous and such that
f(a) > 0 and f(b) < 0, then there exists an x ∈[a, b] such that
f(x) = 0.
5.2.11
Corollary.
(Fixed Point Theorem)
Let f be a con-
tinuous mapping of [0, 1] into [0, 1]. Then there exists a z ∈[0, 1] such
that f(z) = z. (The point z is called a ﬁxed point.)
Proof.
If f(0) = 0 or f(1) = 1, the result is obviously true. Thus
it suﬃces to consider the case when f(0) > 0 and f(1) < 1.
Let
g : [0, 1] →R be deﬁned by g(x) = x −f(x). Then g is continuous,
g(0) = −f(0) < 0, and g(1) = 1 −f(1) > 0.
Consequently, by
Corollary 5.2.10 there exists a z ∈[0, 1] such that g(z) = 0; that
is, z −f(z) = 0 or f(z) = z.
5.2.12
Remark.
Corollary 5.2.11 is a special case of a very im-
portant theorem called the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem which says
that if you map an n-dimensional cube continuously into itself then
there is a ﬁxed point. [There are many proofs of this theorem, but
most depend on methods of algebraic topology. An unsophisticated
proof is given on pp. 238–239 of the book “Introduction to Set Theory
and Topology”, by K. Kuratowski (Pergamon Press, 1961).]

5.3
Postscript.
In this chapter we said that a mapping** between topological spaces
is called “continuous” if it has the property that the inverse image of
every open set is an open set. This is an elegant deﬁnition and easy to
understand. It contrasts with the one we meet in real analysis which
was mentioned at the beginning of this section. We have generalized
the real analysis deﬁnition, not for the sake of generalization, but
rather to see what is really going on.
The Weierstrass Intermediate Value Theorem seems intuitively
obvious, but we now see it follows from the fact that R is connected
and that any continuous image of a connected space is connected.
We introduced a stronger property than connected, namely path-
connected.
In many cases it is not suﬃcient to insist that a space
be connected, it must be path-connected.
This property plays an
important role in algebraic topology.
We shall return to the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem in due course.
It is a powerful theorem. Fixed point theorems play important roles in
various branches of mathematics including topology, functional analy-
sis, and diﬀerential equations. They are still a topic of research activity
today.
In Exercises 5.2 #9 and #10 we met the notions of “component”
and “totally disconnected”. Both of these are important for an under-
standing of connectedness.

Warning:
Some books use the terms “mapping” and “map” to mean continuous
mapping. We do not.

CHAPTER 6
Metric Spaces
The most important class of topological spaces is the class of metric
spaces. Metric spaces provide a rich source of examples in topology.
But more than this, most of the applications of topology to analysis
are via metric spaces.
85

86
Topology Without Tears
6.1
Metric Spaces
6.1.1
Deﬁnition.
Let X be a non-empty set and d a real-valued
function deﬁned on X × X such that for a, b ∈X:
(i) d(a, b) ≥0 and d(a, b) = 0 if and only if a = b,
(ii) d(a, b) = d(b, a) and
(iii) d(a, c) ≤d(a, b) + d(b, c), [the triangle inequality] for all a, b
and c in X.
Then d is said to be a metric on X, (X, d) is called a metric space, and
d(a, b) is referred to as the distance between a and b.
6.1.2
Example.
The function d : R × R →R given by
d(a, b) = |a −b|,
a, b ∈R
is a metric on the set R since
(i) |a −b| ≥0, for all a and b in R, and |a −b| = 0 if and only if
a = b,
(ii) |a −b| = |b −a|, and
(iii) |a−c| ≤|a−b|+ |b−c|. (Deduce this from |x+ y| ≤|x|+ |y|.)
We call d the Euclidean metric on R.

Metric Spaces
87
6.1.3
Example.
The function d : R2 × R2 →R given by
d(⟨a1, a2⟩, ⟨b1, b2⟩) =

(a1 −b1)2 + (a2 −b2)2
is a metric on R2 called the Euclidean metric on R2.
6.1.4
Example.
Let X be a non-empty set and d the function
from X × X into R deﬁned by
d(a, b) =
 0,
if a = b
1,
if a ̸= b.
Then d is a metric on X and is called the discrete metric on X.

88
Topology Without Tears
Many important examples of metric spaces are “function spaces”.
For these the set X on which we put a metric is a set of functions.
6.1.5
Example.
Let C[0, 1] denote the set of continuous functions
from [0, 1] into R. A metric is deﬁned on this set by
d(f, g) =
 1
0 |f(x) −g(x)| dx
where f and g are in C[0, 1].
A moment’s thought should tell you that d(f, g) is precisely the
area of the region which lies between the graphs of the functions and
the lines x = 0 and x = 1, as illustrated below.

Metric Spaces
89
6.1.6
Example.
Again let C[0, 1] be the set of all continuous
functions from [0, 1] into R. Another metric is deﬁned on C[0, 1] as
follows:
d∗(f, g) = sup{|f(x) −g(x)| : x ∈[0, 1]}.
Clearly d∗(f, g) is just the largest vertical gap between the graphs
of the functions f and g.
6.1.7
Example.
We can deﬁne another metric on R2 by putting
d∗(⟨a1, a2⟩, ⟨b1, b2⟩) = max{|a1 −b1|, |a2 −b2|}
where max{x, y} equals the larger of the two numbers x and y.

90
Topology Without Tears
6.1.8
Example.
Yet another metric on R2 is given by
d1(⟨a1, a2⟩, ⟨b1, b2⟩) = |a1 −b1| + |a2 −b2|.
A rich source of examples of metric spaces is the family of normed
vector spaces.
6.1.9
Example.
Let V be a vector space over the ﬁeld of real or
complex numbers. A norm ∥∥on V is a map : V →R such that for
all a, b ∈V and λ in the ﬁeld
(i) ∥a ∥≥0 and ∥a ∥= 0 if and only if a = 0,
(ii) ∥a + b ∥≤∥a ∥+ ∥b ∥and
(iii) ∥λa ∥= |λ| ∥a ∥.
A normed vector space (V, ∥∥) is a vector space V with a norm ∥∥.
Let (V, ∥∥) be any normed vector space. Then there is a corre-
sponding metric on the set V given by d(a, b) =∥a −b ∥, for a and b
in V .
It is easily checked that d is indeed a metric. So every normed
vector space is also a metric space in a natural way.
For example, R3 is a normed vector space if we put
∥⟨x1, x2, x3⟩∥=

x2
1 + x2
2 + x2
3
for x1, x2, and x3 in R. So R3 becomes a metric space if we put
d(⟨a1, b1, c1⟩, ⟨a2, b2, c2⟩) =∥(a1 −a2, b1 −b2, c1 −c2) ∥
=

(a1 −a2)2 + (b1 −b2)2 + (c1 −c2)2.
Indeed Rn, for any positive integer n, is a normed vector space if
we put
∥⟨x1, x2, . . . , xn⟩∥=

x2
1 + x2
2 + . . . + x2n.
So Rn becomes a metric space if we put
d(⟨a1, a2, . . . , an⟩, ⟨b1, b2, . . . , bn⟩) =∥⟨a1 −b1, a2 −b2, . . . , an −bn⟩∥
=

(a1 −b1)2 + (a2 −b2)2 + . . . + (an −bn)2.

Metric Spaces
91
In a normed vector space (N, ∥∥) the open ball with centre a and
radius r is deﬁned to be the set
Br(a) = {x : x ∈V and ∥x −a ∥< r}.
This suggests the following deﬁnition for metric spaces:
6.1.10
Deﬁnition.
Let (X, d) be a metric space and r any positive
real number. Then the open ball about a ∈X of radius r is the set
Br(a) = {x : x ∈X and d(a, x) < r}.
6.1.11
Example.
In R with the Euclidean metric Br(a) is the
open interval (a −r, a + r).
6.1.12
Example.
In R2 with the Euclidean metric, Br(a) is the
open disc with centre a and radius r.
6.1.13
Example.
In R2 with the metric d∗given by
d∗(⟨a1, a2⟩, ⟨b1, b2⟩= max{|a1 −b1|, |a2 −b2|},
the open ball B1(⟨0, 0⟩) looks like

92
Topology Without Tears
6.1.14
Example.
In R2 with the metric d1 given by
d1(⟨a1, a2⟩, ⟨b1, b2⟩) = |a1 −b1| + |a2 −b2|,
the open ball B1(⟨0, 0⟩) looks like
The proof of the following Lemma is quite easy (especially if you
draw a diagram) and so is left for you to supply.

Metric Spaces
93
6.1.15
Lemma.
Let (X, d) be a metric space, a and b points of
X, and δ1 and δ2 positive real numbers. If c ∈Bδ1(a) ∩Bδ2(b), then
there exists a δ > 0 such that Bδ(c) ⊆Bδ1(a) ∩Bδ2(b).
The next Corollary follows in a now routine way from Lemma
6.1.15.
6.1.16
Corollary.
Let (X, d) be a metric space and B1 and B2
open balls in (X, d). Then B1 ∩B2 is a union of open balls in (X, d).

94
Topology Without Tears
Finally we are able to link metric spaces with topological spaces.
6.1.17
Proposition.
Let (X, d) be a metric space.
Then the
collection of open balls in (X, d) is a basis for a topology τ on X.
[The topology τ is referred to as the topology induced by the metric d,
and (X,τ) is called the induced topological space or the corresponding
topological space.]
Proof.
This follows from Proposition 2.2.8 and Corollary 6.1.16.
6.1.18
Example.
If d is the Euclidean metric on R then a basis
for the topology τ induced by the metric d is the set of all open balls.
But Bδ(a) = (a −δ , a + δ). From this it is readily seen that τ is the
Euclidean topology on R. So the Euclidean metric on R induces the
Euclidean topology on R.
6.1.19
Example.
From Exercises 2.3 #1 (ii) and Example 6.1.12,
it follows that the Euclidean metric on the set R2 induces the Euclidean
topology on R2.
6.1.20
Example.
From Exercises 2.3 #1 (i) and Example 6.1.13
it follows that the metric d∗also induces the Euclidean topology on
the set R2.
It is left as an exercise for you to prove that the metric d1 of
Example 6.1.14 also induces the Euclidean topology on R2.
6.1.21
Example.
If d is the discrete metric on a set X then
for each x ∈X, B 1
2(x) = {x}. So all the singleton sets are open in
the topology τ induced on X by d. Consequently, τ is the discrete
topology.
We saw in Examples 6.1.19, 6.1.20, and 6.1.14 three diﬀerent met-
rics on the same set which induce the same topology.
6.1.22
Deﬁnition.
Two metrics on a set X are called equivalent
if they induce the same topology on X.
So the metrics d, d∗, and d1, of Examples 6.1.3, 6.1.13, and 6.1.14
on R2 are equivalent.

Metric Spaces
95
6.1.23
Proposition.
Let (X, d) be a metric space and τ the
topology induced on X by the metric d. Then a subset U of X is
open in (X,τ) if and only if for each a ∈U there exists an ε > 0 such
that the open ball Bε(a) ⊆U.
Proof.
Assume that U ∈τ. Then, by Propositions 2.3.2 and 6.1.17,
for any a ∈U there exists a point b ∈X and a δ > 0 such that
a ∈Bδ(b) ⊆U.
Let ε = δ −d(a, b). Then it is readily seen that
a ∈Bε(a) ⊆U.
Conversely, assume that U is a subset of X with the property that for
each a ∈U there exists an εa > 0 such that Bεa(a) ⊆U. Then, by
Proposition 2.3.3, U is an open set.
We have seen that every metric on a set X induces a topology τ
on the set X. However, we shall now show that not every topology on
a set is induced by a metric. First, a deﬁnition which you have already
met in the exercises. (See Exercises 4.1 #13. )
6.1.24
Deﬁnition.
A topological space (X,τ) is said to be a
Hausdorﬀspace (or a T2-space) if for each pair of distinct points a
and b in X, there exist open sets U and V such that a ∈U, b ∈V , and
U ∩V = Ø.
Of course R, R2 and all discrete spaces are examples of Hausdorﬀ
spaces, while any set with at least 2 elements and which has the
indiscrete topology is not a Hausdorﬀspace. With a little thought
we see that Z with the ﬁnite-closed topology is also not a Hausdorﬀ
space. (Convince yourself of all of these facts.)
6.1.25
Proposition.
Let (X, d) be any metric space and τ the
topology induced on X by d. Then (X,τ) is a Hausdorﬀspace.
Proof.
Let a and b be any points of X, with a ̸= b. Then d(a, b) > 0.
Put ε = d(a, b). Consider the open balls Bε/2(a) and Bε/2(b). Then
these are open sets in (X,τ), a ∈Bε/2(a), and b ∈Bε/2(b). So to show
τ is Hausdorﬀwe have to prove only that Bε/2(a) ∩Bε/2(b) = Ø.

96
Topology Without Tears
Suppose x ∈Bε/2(a) ∩Bε/2(b). Then d(x, a) < ε
2 and d(x, b) < ε
2.
Hence
d(a, b) ≤d(a, x) + d(x, b)
< ε
2 + ε
2 = ε.
This says d(a, b) < ε, which is false. Consequently there exists no x in
Bε/2(a) ∩Bε/2(b); that is, Bε/2(a) ∩Bε/2(b) = Ø, as required.

Metric Spaces
97
6.1.26
Remark.
Putting Proposition 6.1.25 together with the
comments which preceded it, we see that an indiscrete space with
at least two points has a topology which is not induced by any metric.
Also Z with the ﬁnite-closed topology τ is such that τ is not induced
by any metric on Z.
6.1.27
Deﬁnition.
A space (X,τ) is said to be metrizable if there
exists a metric d on the set X with the property that τ is the topology
induced by d.
So, for example, the set Z with the ﬁnite-closed topology is not a
metrizable space.
Warning.
One should not be misled by Proposition 6.1.25 into
thinking that every Hausdorﬀspace is metrizable. Later on we shall
be able to produce (using inﬁnite products) examples of Hausdorﬀ
spaces which are not metrizable. [Metrizability of topological spaces
is quite a technical topic. For necessary and suﬃcient conditions for

the topology induced on Y by d1 and τ2 is the subspace topology
on Y (induced by τ on X), prove that τ1 = τ2. [This shows that

(Y, d1) such that for all x1 ad x2 in X,
d(x1, x2) = d1(f(x1), f(x2)).
Such a mapping f is said to be an isometry. Prove that every
isometry is a homeomorphism of the corresponding topological
spaces. (So isometric metric spaces are homeomorphic!)
6.2
Convergence of Sequences
You are familiar with the notion of a convergent sequence of real
numbers. It is deﬁned as follows. The sequence x1, x2, . . . , xn, . . . of

100
Topology Without Tears
real numbers is said to converge to the real number x if given any ε > 0
there exists an integer n0 such that for all n ≥n0, |xn −x| < ε.
It is obvious how this deﬁnition can be extended from R with the
Euclidean metric to any metric space.
6.2.1
Deﬁnitions.
Let (X, d) be a metric space and x1, . . . , xn, . . .
a sequence of points in X. Then the sequence is said to converge to
x ∈X if given any ε > 0 there exists an integer n0 such that for all
n ≥n0, d(x, xn) < ε. We denote this by xn →x.
The sequence y1, y2, . . . , yn, . . . of points in (X, d) is said to be
convergent if there exist a point y ∈X such that yn →y.
The next proposition is easily proved, so its proof is left as an
exercise.
6.2.2
Proposition.
Let x1, x2, . . . , xn, . . . be a sequence of points
in a metric space (X, d). Further, let x and y be points in (X, d) such
that xn →x and xn →y. Then x = y.

Metric Spaces
101
The following proposition tells us the surprising fact that the
topology of a metric space can be described entirely in terms of its
convergent sequences.
6.2.3
Proposition.
Let (X, d) be a metric space. A subset A of
X is closed in (X, d) if and only if every convergent sequence of points
in A converges to a point in A. (In other words, A is closed in (X, d) if
and only if an →x, where x ∈X and an ∈A for all n, implies x ∈A.)
Proof.
Assume that A is closed in (X, d) and let an →x, where
an ∈A for all positive integers n. Suppose that x ∈X \ A. Then, as
X \A is an open set containing x, there exists an open ball Bε(x) such
that x ∈Bε(x) ⊆X \ A. Noting that each an ∈A, this implies that
d(x, an) > ε for each n. Hence the sequence a1, a2, . . . , an, . . . does not
converge to x. This is a contradiction. So x ∈A, as required.
Conversely, assume that every convergent sequence of points in A
converges to a point of A. Suppose that X \A is not open. Then there
exists a point y ∈X \ A such that for each ε > 0, Bε(y) ∩A ̸= Ø. For
each positive integer n, let xn be any point in B1/n(y) ∩A. Then we
claim that xn →y. To see this let ε be any positive real number, and
n0 any integer greater than 1/ε. Then for each n ≥n0,
xn ∈B1/n(y) ⊆B1/n0(y) ⊆Bε(y).
So xn →y and, by our assumption, y ∈X \ A. This is a contradiction
and so X \ A is open and thus A is closed in (X, d).

102
Topology Without Tears
Having seen that the topology of a metric space can be described
in terms of convergent sequences, we should not be surprised that
continuous functions can also be so described.
6.2.4
Proposition.
Let (X, d) and (Y, d1) be metric spaces and
f a mapping of X into Y . Let τ and τ1 be the topologies determined
by d and d1, respectively. Then f : (X,τ) →(Y,τ1) is continuous if
and only if xn →x ⇒f(xn) →f(x); that is, if x1, x2, . . . , xn, . . . is
a sequence of points in (X, d) converging to x, then the sequence of
points f(x1), f(x2), . . . , f(xn), . . . in (Y, d1) converges to f(x).
Proof.
Assume that xn →x ⇒f(xn) →f(x). To verify that f is
continuous it suﬃces to show that the inverse image of every closed
set in (Y,τ1) is closed in (X,τ). So let A be closed in (Y,τ1). Let
x1, x2, . . . , xn, . . . be a sequence of points in f −1(A) convergent to a
point x ∈X. As xn →x, f(xn) →f(x). But since each f(xn) ∈A
and A is closed, Proposition 6.2.3 then implies that f(x) ∈A. Thus
x ∈f −1(A).
So we have shown that every convergent sequence of
points from f −1(A) converges to a point of f −1(A). Thus f −1(A) is
closed, and hence f is continuous.
Conversely, let f be continuous and xn →x. Let ε be any positive
real number. Then the open ball Bε(f(x)) is an open set in (Y,τ1).
Therefore f −1(Bε(f(x)) is an open set in (X,τ) and it contains x.
Therefore there exists a δ > 0 such that
x ∈Bδ(x) ⊆f −1(Bε(f(x))).
As xn →x, there exists a positive integer n0 such that for all n ≥n0,
xn ∈Bδ(x). Therefore
f(xn) ∈f(Bδ(x)) ⊆Bε(f(x)), for all n ≥n0.
Thus f(xn) →f(x).
The corollary below is easily deduced from Proposition 6.2.3
6.2.5
Corollary.
Let (X, d) and (Y, d1) be metric spaces, f a
mapping of X into Y , and τ and τ1 the topologies determined by
d and d1, respectively. Then f : (X,τ) →(Y,τ1) is continuous if and
only if for each x0 ∈X and ε > 0, there exists a δ > 0 such that x ∈X
and d(x, x0) < δ ⇒d1(f(x), f(x0)) < ε.

Postscript
Metric space theory is an important topic in its own right. As well
metric spaces hold an important position in the study of topology. In-
deed many books on topology begin with metric spaces, and motivate
the study of topology via them.
We saw that diﬀerent metrics on the same set can give rise to the
same topology. Such metrics are called equivalent metrics. We were
introduced to the study of function spaces, and in particular, C[0, 1].
En route we met normed vector spaces, a central topic in functional
analysis.
Not all topological spaces arise from metric spaces. We saw this
by observing that topologies induced by metrics are Hausdorﬀ.
We saw that the topology of a metric space can be described en-
tirely in terms of its convergent sequences and that continuous func-
tions between metric spaces can also be so described.
Exercises 6.2 #9 introduced the interesting concept of distance
between sets in a metric space.

CHAPTER 7
Compactness
The most important topological property is compactness. It plays a
key role in many branches of mathematics. It would be fair to say that
until you understand compactness you do not understand topology!
So what is compactness? It could be described as the topologists
generalization of ﬁniteness. The formal deﬁnition says that a topolog-
ical space is compact if whenever it is a subset of a union of an inﬁnite
number of open sets then it is also a subset of a union of a ﬁnite num-
ber of these open sets. Obviously every ﬁnite subset of a topological
space is compact. And we quickly see that in a discrete space a set is
compact if and only if it is ﬁnite. When we move to topological spaces
with richer topological structures, such as R, we discover that inﬁnite
sets can be compact. Indeed all closed intervals [a, b] in R are compact.
But intervals of this type are the only ones which are compact.
So we are led to ask: precisely which subsets of R are compact?
The Heine-Borel Theorem will tell us that the compact subsets of R
are precisely the sets which are both closed and bounded.
As we go farther into our study of topology, we shall see that
compactness plays a crucial role. This is especially so of applications
of topology to analysis.

Topology Without Tears
7.1
Compact Spaces
7.1.1
Deﬁnition.
Let A be a subset of a topological space (X,τ).
Then A is said to be compact if for every set I and every family of open
sets, Oi, i ∈I, such that A ⊆

i∈I Oi there exists a ﬁnite subfamily
Oi1, Oi2. . . . , Oin such that A ⊆Oi1 ∪Oi2 ∪. . . ∪Oin.
7.1.2
Example.
If (X,τ) = R and A = (0, ∞), then A is not
compact.
Proof.
For each positive integer i, let Oi be the open interval (0, i).
Then, clearly, A ⊆
∞
i=1 Oi. But there do not exist i1, i2, . . . in such that
A ⊆(0, i1) ∪(0, i2) ∪. . . ∪(0, in). Therefore A is not compact.
7.1.3
Example.
Let (X,τ) be any topological space and A =
{x1, x2, . . ., xn} any ﬁnite subset of (X,τ). Then A is compact.
Proof.
Let Oi, i ∈I, be any family of open sets such that A ⊆

i∈I Oi. Then for each xj ∈A, there exists an Oij, such that xj ∈Oij.
Thus A ⊆Oi1 ∪Oi2 ∪. . . ∪Oin. So A is compact.
7.1.4
Remark.
So we see from Example 7.1.3 that every ﬁnite
set (in a topological space) is compact. Indeed “compactness” can be
thought of as a topological generalization of “ﬁniteness”.

Compactness
109
7.1.5
Example.
A subset A of a discrete space (X,τ) is compact
if and only if it is ﬁnite.
Proof.
If A is ﬁnite then Example 7.1.3 shows that it is compact.
Conversely, let A be compact. Then the family of singleton sets
Ox = {x}, x ∈A is such that each Ox is open and A ⊆

x∈A Ox. As
A is compact, there exist Ox1, Ox2, . . . , Oxn such that A ⊆Ox1 ∪Ox2 ∪
. . . ∪Oxn; that is, A ⊆{x1, . . . , xn}. Hence A is a ﬁnite set.
Of course if all compact sets were ﬁnite then the study of “com-
pactness” would not be interesting. However we shall see shortly that,
for example, every closed interval [a, b] is compact. Firstly, we intro-
duce a little terminology.
7.1.6
Deﬁnitions.
Let I be a set and Oi, i ∈I, a family of open
sets in a topological space (X,τ). Let A be a subset of (X,τ). Then
Oi, i ∈I, is said to be an open covering of A if A ⊆

i∈I Oi. A ﬁnite
subfamily, Oi1, Oi2, . . . , Oin, of Oi, i ∈I is called a ﬁnite subcovering
(of A) if A ⊆Oi1 ∪Oi2 ∪. . . ∪Oin.
So we can rephrase the deﬁnition of compactness as follows:
7.1.7
Deﬁnitions.
A subset A of a topological space (X,τ) is said
to be compact if every open covering of A has a ﬁnite subcovering. If
the compact subset A equals X, then (X,τ) is said to be a compact
space.

110
Topology Without Tears
7.1.8
Remark.
We leave as an exercise the veriﬁcation of the
following statement:
Let A be a subset of (X,τ) and τ1 the topology induced on A by
τ. Then A is a compact subset of (X,τ) if and only if (A,τ1) is a
compact space.
[This statement is not as trivial as it may appear at ﬁrst sight.]
7.1.9
Proposition.
The closed interval [0, 1] is compact.
Proof.
Let Oi, i ∈I be any open covering of [0, 1]. Then for each
x ∈[0, 1], there is an Oi such that x ∈Oi. As Oi is open about x,
there exists an interval Ux, open in [0, 1] such that x ∈Ux ⊆Oi.
Now deﬁne a subset S of [0, 1] as follows:
S = {z : [0, z] can be covered by a ﬁnite number of the sets Ux}.
[So z ∈S ⇒[0, z] ⊆Ux1 ∪Ux2 ∪. . . ∪Uxn, for some x1, x2, . . . , xn.]
Now let x ∈S and y ∈Ux. Then as Ux is an interval containing x
and y, [x, y] ⊆Ux. (Here we are assuming, without loss of generality
that x ≤y.) So
[0, y] ⊆Ux1 ∪Ux2 ∪. . . ∪Uxn ∪Ux
and hence y ∈S.
So for each x ∈[0, 1], Ux ∩S = Ux or Ø.
This implies that
S =

x∈S
Ux
and
[0, 1] \ S =

x/∈S
Ux.
Thus we have that S is open in [0, 1] and S is closed in [0, 1]. But [0, 1]
is connected. Therefore S = [0, 1] or Ø.
However 0 ∈S and so S = [0, 1]; that is, [0, 1] can be covered by
a ﬁnite number of Ux. So [0, 1] ⊆Ux1 ∪Ux2 ∪. . . Uxm. But each Uxi is
contained in an Oi, i ∈I. Hence [0, 1] ⊆Oi1 ∪Oi2 ∪. . . ∪Oim and we
have shown that [0, 1] is compact.

7.2
The Heine-Borel Theorem
The next proposition says that “a continuous image of a compact space
is compact”.
7.2.1
Proposition.
Let f : (X,τ) →(Y,τ1) be a continuous
surjective map. If (X,τ) is compact, then (Y,τ1) is compact.
Proof.
Let Oi, i ∈I, be any open covering of Y ; that is Y ⊆

i∈I Oi.
Then f −1(Y ) ⊆f −1(

i∈I Oi); that is, X ⊆

i∈I f −1(Oi).

112
Topology Without Tears
So f −1(Oi), i ∈I, is an open covering of X. As X is compact,
there exist i1, i2, . . . , in in I such that
X ⊆f −1(Oi1) ∪f −1(Oi2) ∪. . . ∪f −1(Oin).
So
Y = f(X)
⊆f(f −1(Oi1) ∪f −1(Oi2) ∪. . . ∪f −1(Oin))
= f(f −1(Oi1) ∪f(f −1(Oi2)) ∪. . . ∪f(f −1(Oin))
= Oi1 ∪Oi2 ∪. . . ∪Oin ,
since f is surjective.
So we have Y ⊆Oi1
 Oi2
 . . .
 Oin; that is, Y is covered by a ﬁnite
number of Oi. Hence Y is compact.
7.2.2
Corollary.
Let (X,τ) and (Y,τ1) be homeomorphic topo-
logical spaces. If (X,τ) is compact, then (Y,τ1) is compact.
7.2.3
Corollary.
For a and b in R with a < b, [a, b] is compact
while (a, b) is not compact.
Proof.
The space [a, b] is homeomorphic to the compact space [0, 1]
and so, by Proposition 7.2.1, is compact.
The space (a, b) is homeomorphic to (0, ∞). If (a, b) were compact,
then (0, ∞) would be compact, but we saw in Example 7.1.2 that (0, ∞)
is not compact. Hence (a, b) is not compact.
7.2.4
Proposition.
Every closed subset of a compact space is
compact.
Proof.
Let A be a closed subset of a compact space (X,τ). Let
Ui ∈τ, i ∈I, be any open covering of A. Then
X ⊆(

i∈I
Ui) ∪(X \ A);
that is, Ui, i ∈I, together with the open set X \ A is an open covering
of X. Therefore there exists a ﬁnite subcovering Ui1, Ui2, . . . , Uik, X\A.
[If X \ A is not in the ﬁnite subcovering then we can include it and
still have a ﬁnite subcovering of X.]
So
X ⊆Ui1 ∪Ui2 ∪. . . ∪Uik ∪(X \ A).

Compactness
113
Therefore,
A ⊆Ui1 ∪Ui2 ∪. . . ∪Uik ∪(X \ A)
which clearly implies
A ⊆Ui1 ∪Ui2 ∪. . . ∪Uik
since A ∩(X \ A) = Ø. Hence A has a ﬁnite subcovering and so is
compact.
7.2.5
Proposition.
A compact subset of a Hausdorﬀtopological
space is closed.
Proof.
Let A be a compact subset of the Hausdorﬀspace (X,τ).
We shall show that A contains all its limit points and hence is closed.
Let p ∈X \ A. Then for each a ∈A, there exist open sets Ua and Va
such that a ∈Ua, p ∈Va and Ua ∩Va = Ø.
Then A ⊆

a∈A Ua. As A is compact, there exist a1, a2, . . . , an in
A such that
A ⊆Ua1 ∪Ua2 ∪. . . ∪Uan.
Put U = Ua1
 Ua2
 . . .
 Uan and V = Va1 ∩Va2 ∩. . . ∩Van. Then p ∈V
and Va ∩Ua = Ø implies V ∩U = Ø which in turn implies V ∩A = Ø.
So p is not a limit point of A, and V is an open set containing p which
does not intersect A.
Hence A contains all of its limit points and is therefore closed.
7.2.6
Corollary.
A compact subset of a metrizable space is closed.
7.2.7
Example.
For a and b in R with a < b, the intervals
[a, b) and (a, b] are not compact as they are not closed subsets of the

7.2.8
Proposition.
A compact subset of R is bounded.
Proof.
Let A ⊆R be unbounded.
Then A ⊆
∞
n=1(−n, n), but
{(−n, n) : n = 1, 2, 3, . . .} does not have any ﬁnite subcovering of A
as A is unbounded. Therefore A is not compact. Hence all compact
subsets of R are bounded.
7.2.9
Theorem. (Heine-Borel Theorem) Every closed bounded
subset of R is compact.
Proof.
If A is a closed bounded subset of R, then A ⊆[a, b], for
some a and b in R. As [a, b] is compact and A is a closed subset, A is
compact.
The Heine-Borel Theorem is an important result. The proof above
is short only because we extracted and proved Proposition 7.1.9 ﬁrst.
7.2.10
Proposition.
(Converse of Heine-Borel Theorem)
Every compact subset of R is closed and bounded.
Proof.
This follows immediately from Proposition 7.2.8 and 7.2.5.
7.2.11
Deﬁnition.
A subset A of a metric space (X, d) is said to
be bounded if there exists a real number r such that d(a1, a2) ≤r, for
all a1 and a2 in A.

7.2.12
Proposition.
Let A be a compact subset of a metric space
(X, d). Then A is closed and bounded.
Proof.
By Corollary 7.2.6, A is a closed set. Now ﬁx x0 ∈X and
deﬁne the mapping f : (A,τ) →R by
f(a) = d(a, x0), for every a ∈A,
where τ is the induced topology on A. Then f is continuous and so,
by Proposition 7.2.1, f(A) is compact. Thus, by Proposition 7.2.10,
f(A) is bounded; that is, there exists a real number M such that
f(a) ≤M, for all a ∈A.
Thus d(a, x0) ≤M, for all a ∈A. Putting r = 2M, we see by the
triangle inequality that d(a1, a2) ≤r, for all a1 and a2 in A.
Recalling that Rn denotes the n-dimensional Euclidean space with
the topology induced by the Euclidean metric, it is possible to gener-
alize the Heine-Borel Theorem and its converse from R to Rn, n > 1.
We state the result here but delay its proof until the next chapter.
7.2.13
Theorem.
(Generalized Heine-Borel Theorem)
A
subset of Rn, n ≥1, is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded.
Warning.
Although Theorem 7.2.13 says that every closed bounded
subset of Rn is compact, closed bounded subsets of other metric spaces
need not be compact. (See Exercises 7.2 #9.)

7.2.14
Proposition.
Let (X,τ) be a compact space and f a
continuous mapping from (X,τ) into R.
Then the set f(X) has a
greatest element and a least element.
Proof.
As f is continuous, f(X) is compact. Therefore f(X) is a
closed bounded subset of R. As f(X) is bounded, it has a supremum.
Since f(X) is closed, Lemma 3.3.2 implies that the supremum is in
f(X).
Thus f(X) has a greatest element – namely its supremum.
Similarly it can be shown that f(X) has a least element.
7.2.15
Proposition.
Let a and b be in R and f a continuous
function from [a, b] into R. Then f([a, b]) = [c, d], for some c and d in
R.
Proof.
As [a, b] is connected, f([a, b]) is a connected subset of R
and hence is an interval. As [a, b] is compact, f([a, b]) is compact. So
f([a, b]) is a closed bounded interval. Hence
f([a, b]) = [c, d]
for some c and d in R.

Compactness
121
7.3
Postscript
Compactness plays a key role in applications of topology to all branches
of analysis. As noted in Remark 7.1.4 it can be thought as a topological
generalization of ﬁniteness.
The Generalized Heine-Borel Theorem characterizes the compact
subsets of Rn as those which are closed and bounded.
Compactness is a topological property.
Indeed any continuous
image of a compact space is compact.
Closed subsets of compact spaces are compact and compact sub-
spaces of Hausdorﬀspaces are closed.
Exercises 7.2 # 5 introduces the notions of open mappings and
closed mappings. Exercises 7.2 #10 notes that a compact Hausdorﬀ
space is a normal space (indeed a T4-space). That the closed unit ball
in each Rn is compact contrasts with Exercises 7.2 #9. This exercise
points out that the closed unit ball in the metric space (C[0, 1], d∗) is
not compact. Though we shall not prove it here, it can be shown that
a normed vector space is ﬁnite-dimensional if and only if its closed unit
ball is compact.
Warning.
It is unfortunate that “compact” is deﬁned in diﬀerent
ways in diﬀerent books and some of these are not equivalent to the
deﬁnition presented here.
Firstly some books include Hausdorﬀin
the deﬁnition of compact. Some books, particularly older ones, use
“compact” to mean a weaker property than ours—what is often called
sequentially compact. Finally the term “bikompakt” is often used to
mean compact or compact Hausdorﬀin our sense.

CHAPTER 8
Finite Products
There are three important ways of creating new topological spaces
from old ones. They are by forming “subspaces”, “quotient spaces”,
and “product spaces”.
The next three chapters are devoted to the
study of product spaces. In this chapter we investigate ﬁnite products
and prove Tychonoﬀ’s Theorem. This seemingly innocuous theorem
says that any product of compact spaces is compact.

8.1
The Product Topology
If X1, X2, . . . , Xn are sets then the product
X1 × X2 × . . . × Xn is
the set consisting of all the ordered n-tuples ⟨x1, x2 . . . , xn⟩, where
xi ∈Xi, i = 1, . . . , n. The problem we now discuss is: Given topological
spaces (X1,τ1), (X2,τ2), . . . , (Xn,τn) how do we deﬁne a reasonable
topology τ on the product set X1 × X2 × . . . × Xn? An obvious (but
incorrect!) candidate for τ is the set of all sets O1 × O2 × . . . × On,
where Oi ∈τi, i = 1, . . . , n. Unfortunately this is not a topology.
For example, if n = 2 and (X, T1) = (X,τ2) = R then τ would
contain the rectangles (0, 1) × (0, 1) and (2, 3) × (2, 3) but not the set
[(0, 1)×(0, 1)]∪[(2, 3)×(2, 3)], since this is not O1×O2 for any choice of
O1 and O2. [If it were O1×O2 for some O1 and O2, then 1
2 ∈(0, 1) ⊆O1
and 21
2 ∈(2, 3) ⊆O2 and so the ordered pair ⟨1
2, 21
2⟩∈O1 × O2 but
⟨1
2, 21
2⟩/∈[(0, 1) × (0, 1)] ∪[(2, 3) × (2, 3)].] Thus τ is not closed under
unions and so is not a topology.
However we have already seen how to put a topology (the usual
topology) on R2 = R × R. This was done in Example 2.2.9. Indeed
this example suggests how to deﬁne the product topology in general.
8.1.1
Deﬁnitions.
Let (X1,τ1), (X2,τ2), . . . , (Xn,τn) be topo-
logical spaces. Then the product topology τ on the set X1×X2×. . .×Xn
is the topology having the family {O1 × O2 × . . . On, Oi ∈τi, i =
1, . . . , n} as a basis. The set X1 ×X2 ×. . .×Xn with the topology τ is
said to be the product of the spaces (X1,τ1), (X2,τ2), . . . , (Xn,τn) and
is denoted by (X1×X2×. . . Xn,τ) or (X1,τ1)×(X2,τ2)×. . .×(Xn,τn).
Of course it must be veriﬁed that the family {O1 × O2 × . . . × On :
Oi ∈τi, i = 1, . . . , n} is a basis for a topology; that is, it satisﬁes the
conditions of Proposition 2.2.8. (This is left as an exercise for you.)
8.1.2
Proposition.
Let B1, B2, . . . , Bn be bases for topological
spaces (X1,τ1), (X2,τ2), . . . , (Xn,τn), respectively. Then the family
{O1 × O2 × . . . × On : Oi ∈Bi, i = 1, . . . , n} is a basis for the product
topology on X1 × X2 × . . . × Xn.
The proof of Proposition 8.1.2 is straightforward and is also left
as an exercise for you.

125
8.1.3
Observations
(i)
We now see that the usual or Euclidean
topology on Rn, n ≥2, is just the product topology on the set R×R×
. . . × R = Rn. (See Example 2.2.9 and Remark 2.2.10.)
(ii)
It is clear from Deﬁnitions 8.1.1 that any product of open sets
is an open set or more precisely: if O1, O2, . . . , On are open subsets of
topological spaces (X1,τ1), (X2,τ2), . . . , (Xn,τn), respectively, then
O1 × O2 × . . . On is an open subset of the product space (X1,τ1) ×
(X2,τ2) × . . . × (Xn,τn). The next proposition says that any product
of closed sets is a closed set.

8.1.4
Proposition.
Let C1, C2, . . . , Cn be closed subsets of the
topological spaces (X1,τ1), (X2,τ2),. . . , (Xn,τn), respectively. Then
C1 × C2 × . . . × Cn is a closed subset of the product space (X1 × X2 ×
. . . × Xn,τ).
Proof.
Observe that
(X1 × X2 × . . . × Xn) \ (C1 × C2 × . . . × Cn)
=[(X1 \ C1) × X2 × . . . × Xn] ∪[X1 × (X2 \ C2) × X3 × . . . × Xn]
∪. . . ∪[X1 × X2 × . . . × Xn−1 × (Xn \ Cn)]
which is a union of open sets (as a product of open sets is open) and so
is open in (X1,τ1)×(X2,τ2)×. . .×(Xn,τn). Therefore its complement,
C1 × C2 × . . . Cn, is a closed set, as required.

Projections onto Factors of a Product
Before proceeding to our next result we need a couple of deﬁnitions.
8.2.1
Deﬁnitions.
Let τ1 and τ2 be topologies on a set X. Then
τ1 is said to be a ﬁner topology than τ2 (and τ2 is said to be a coarser
topology than τ1) if τ1 ⊇τ2.
8.2.2
Example.
The discrete topology on a set X is ﬁner than
any other topology on X. The indiscrete topology on X is coarser
than any other topology on X. [See also Exercises 5.1 #10.]
8.2.3
Deﬁnitions.
Let (X,τ) and (Y,τ1) be topological spaces
and f a mapping from X into Y . Then f is said to be an open mapping
if for every A ∈T , f(A) ∈τ1. The mapping f is said to be a closed
mapping if for every closed set B in (X,τ), f(B) is closed in (Y,τ1).
8.2.4
Remark.
In Exercises 7.2 #5, you were asked to show
that none of the conditions “continuous mapping”, “open mapping”,
“closed mapping”, implies either of the other two conditions. Indeed
no two of these conditions taken together implies the third.
(Find
examples to verify this.)

131
8.2.5
Proposition.
Let (X,τ1, ), (X2,τ2), . . . , (Xn,τn) be topo-
logical spaces and (X1 × X2 × . . . × Xn,τ) their product space. For
each i ∈{1, . . . , n}, let pi : X1 × X2 × . . . × Xn →Xi be the pro-
jection mapping; that is, pi(⟨x1, x2, . . . , xi, . . . , xn⟩) = xi, for each
⟨x1, x2, . . . , xi, . . . , xn⟩∈X1 × X2 × . . . × Xn. Then
(i) each pi is a continuous surjective open mapping, and
(ii) τ is the coarsest topology on the set X1 × X2 × . . . × Xn such that
each pi is continuous.
Proof.
Clearly each pi is surjective. To see that each pi is continu-
ous, let U be any open set in (X1,τi). Then
p−1
i (U) = X1 × X2 × . . . × Xi−1 × U × Xi+1 × . . . × Xn
which is a product of open sets and so is open in (X1×X2×. . .×Xn,τ).
Hence each pi is continuous. To show that pi is an open mapping it
suﬃces to verify that for each basic open set U1 × U2 × . . . × Un, where
Uj is open in (Xj,τj), for j = 1, . . . , n, pi(U1 × U2 × . . . × Un) is open
in (Xi,τi). But pi(U1 × U2 × . . . × Un) = Ui which is, of course, open
in (Xi,τi). So each pi is an open mapping. We have now veriﬁed part
(i) of the proposition.
Now let τ′ be any topology on the set X1 × X2 × . . . × Xn such
that each projection mapping pi : (X1 ×X2 ×. . .×Xn,τ′) →(Xi,τi) is
continuous. We have to show that τ′ ⊇T . Recalling the deﬁnition of
the basis for the topology τ (given in Deﬁnition 8.1.1) it suﬃces to show
that if O1, O2, . . . , On are open sets in (X1,τ1), (X2,τ2), . . . , (Xn,τn)
respectively, then O1 × O2 × . . . × On ∈τ′. To show this, observe that
as pi is continuous, p−1
i (Oi) ∈τ′, for each i = 1, . . . , n. Now
p−1
i (Oi) = X1 × X2 × . . . × Xi−1 × Oi × Xi+1 × . . . × Xn,
so that
n
i=1 p−1
i (Oi) = O1 × O2 × . . . × On. Then p−1
i (Oi) ∈τ′ for
i = 1, . . . , n, implies
n
i=1 p−1
i (Oi) ∈τ′ ; that is, O1 ×O2 ×. . .×On ∈τ′,
as required.
8.2.6
Remark.
Proposition 8.2.5 (ii) gives us another way of
defining the product topology.
Given topological spaces (X1, T1),
(X2,τ2), . . . , (Xn,τn) the product topology can be deﬁned as the coars-
est topology on X1 × X2 × . . . × Xn such that each projection pi :
X1 × X2 × . . . Xn →Xi is continuous.
This observation will be of

132

greater signiﬁcance in the next section when we proceed to a discus-
sion of products of an inﬁnite number of topological spaces.
8.2.7
Corollary.
For n ≥2, the projection mappings of Rn onto
R are continuous open mappings.
8.2.8
Proposition.
Let (X1,τ1), (X2,τ2), . . . , (Xn, Tn) be topo-
logical spaces and (X1 × X2 × . . . × Xn,τ) the product space. Then
each (Xi,τi) is homeomorphic to a subspace of (X1×X2×. . .×Xn,τ).
Proof.
For each j, let aj be any (ﬁxed) element in Xj. For each i,
deﬁne a mapping fi : (Xi,τi) →(X1 × X2 × . . . × Xn,τ) by
fi(x) = ⟨a1, a2, . . . , ai−1, x, ai+1, . . . , an⟩.
We claim that fi: (Xi,τi) →(fi(Xi),τ′) is a homeomorphism, where
τ′ is the topology induced on fi(Xi) by τ. Clearly this mapping is
one-to-one and onto. Let U ∈τi. Then
fi(U) = {a1} × {a2} × . . . × {ai−1} × U × {ai+1} × . . . × {an}
= (X1 × X2 × . . . × Xi−1 × U × Xi+1 × . . . × Xn)
∩({a1} × {a2} × . . . × {ai−1} × Xi × {ai+1} × . . . × {an})
= (X1 × X2 × . . . × Xi−1 × U × Xi+1 × . . . × Xn) ∩fi(Xi)
∈τ′
since X1 ×X2 ×. . .×Xi−1×U ×Xi+1×. . .×Xn ∈τ. So U ∈τi implies
that fi(U) ∈τ′.
Finally, observe that the family
{(U1 × U2 × . . . × Un) ∩fi(Xi) : Ui ∈Ti, i = 1, . . . , n}
is a basis for τ′, so to prove that fi is continuous it suﬃces to verify
that the inverse image under fi of every member of this family is open
in (Xi,τi). But
f −1
i [(U1 × U2 × . . . Un) ∩fi(Xi)]
= f −1
i (U1 × U2 × . . . × Un) ∩f −1
i fi(Xi)
=
 Ui ∩Xi,
if aj ∈Uj, j ̸= i
Ø,
if aj /∈Uj, for some j ̸= i.
As Ui ∩Xi = Ui ∈τi and Ø ∈τi we infer that fi is continuous, and so
we have the required result.

Tychonoﬀ’s Theorem for Finite Products
We now proceed to state and prove the very important Tychonoﬀ
Theorem. (This is actually Tychonoﬀ’s Theorem for ﬁnite products.
The generalization to inﬁnite products is proved in Chapter 10.)
8.3.1
Theorem.
(Tychonoﬀ’s Theorem)
If (X1, T1), (X2, T2),
. . . , (Xn,τn) are compact spaces then
n
i=1(Xi,τi) is a compact space.
Proof.
Consider ﬁrst the product of two compact spaces (X,τ1)
and (Y,τ2). Let Ui, i ∈I be any opening covering of X × Y . Then
for each x ∈X and y ∈Y , there exists an i ∈I such that ⟨x, y⟩∈Ui.
So there is a basic open set V (x, y) × W(x, y), such that V ⟨x, y⟩∈τ1,
W(x, y) ∈τ2 and
⟨x, y⟩∈V (x, y) × W(x, y) ⊆Ui.
As ⟨x, y⟩ranges over all points of X × Y we obtain an open covering
V (x, y) × W(x, y), x ∈X, y ∈Y , of X × Y such that each V (x, y) ×
W(x, y) is a subset of some Ui, i ∈I. Thus to prove (X,τ1) × (Y,τ2)
is compact it suﬃces to ﬁnd a ﬁnite subcovering of the open covering
V (x, y) × W(x, y), x ∈X, y ∈Y .
Now ﬁx x0 ∈X and consider the subspace {x0} × Y of X × Y .
As seen in Proposition 8.2.8 this subspace is homeomorphic to (Y,τ2)
and so is compact. As V (x0, y) × W(x0, y), y ∈Y , is an open covering
of {x0} × Y it has a ﬁnite subcovering.
V (x0, y1)×W(x0, y1), V (x0, y2)×W(x0, y2), . . . , V (x0, ym)×W(x0, ym).
Put V (x0) = V (x0, y1) ∩V (x0, y2) ∩. . . ∩V (x0, ym). Then we see that
the set V (x0)×Y is contained in the union of a ﬁnite number of sets of
the form V (x0, y) × W(x0, y), y ∈Y. Thus to prove X × Y is compact
it suﬃces to show that X × Y is contained in a ﬁnite union of sets of

136
Topology Without Tears
the form V (x)×Y . As each V (x) is an open set containing x ∈X, the
family V (x), x ∈X, is an open covering of the compact space (X,τ1).
Therefore there exist x1, x2, . . . , xk such that X ⊆V (x1) ∪V (x2) ∪
. . . V (xk). Thus X ×Y ⊆(V (x1)×Y )∪(V (x2)×Y )∪. . .∪(V (xk)×Y ),
as required. Hence (X,τ1) × (Y,τ2) is compact.
The proof is completed by induction. Suppose that the product of
any N compact spaces is compact. Consider the product (X1,τ1) ×
(X2,τ2)×. . .×(XN+1,τN+1) of compact spaces (Xi,τi), i = 1, . . . , N +
1. Then
(X1,τ1) × (X2,τ2) × . . . × (XN + 1,τN + 1)
∼=[(X1,τ1) × . . . × (XN, TN)] × (XN + 1,τN + 1).
By our inductive hypothesis (X1,τ1) × . . . × (XN,τN) is compact, so
the right-hand side is the product of two compact spaces and thus is
compact. Therefore the left-hand side is also compact. This completes
the induction and the proof of the theorem.
Using Proposition 7.2.1 and 8.2.5 (i) we immediately obtain:
8.3.2
Proposition.
(Converse of Tychonoﬀ’s Theorem) Let
(X1,τ1), (X2,τ2), ..., (Xn,τn) be topological spaces. If
n
i=1(Xi,τi) is
compact, then each (Xi,τi) is compact.
We can now prove the previously stated Theorem 7.2.13.

137
8.3.3
Theorem.
(Generalized Heine-Borel Theorem)
A sub-
set of Rn, n ≥1 is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded.
Proof.
That any compact subset of Rn is bounded can be proved in
an analogous fashion to Proposition 7.2.8. Thus by Proposition 7.2.5
any compact subset of Rn is closed and bounded.
Conversely let S be any closed bounded subset of Rn. Then, by
Exercises 7.2 #8, S is a closed subset of the product
n terms



[−M, M] × [−M, M] × . . . × [−M, M]
for some positive real number M. As each closed interval [−M, M] is
compact, by Corollary 7.2.3, Tychonoﬀ’s Theorem implies that the
product space
[−M, M] × [−M, M] × . . . × [−M, M]
is also compact. As S is a closed subset of a compact set, it too is
compact.
8.3.4
Example.
Deﬁne the subspace S1 of R2 by
S1 = {⟨x, y⟩: x2 + y2 = 1}.
Then S1 is a closed bounded subset of R2 and thus is compact.
Similarly we deﬁne the n-sphere Sn as the subspace of Rn+1 given
by Sn = {⟨x1, x2, . . . , xn+1⟩: x2
1 + x2
2 + . . . + x2
n+1 = 1}. Then Sn is a
closed bounded subset of Rn+1 and so is compact.
8.3.5
Example.
The subspace S1 × [0, 1] of R3 is the product
of two compact spaces and so is compact.
(Convince yourself that
S1 × [0, 1] is the surface of a cylinder.)

Products and Connectedness
8.4.1
Deﬁnition.
Let (X,τ) be a topological space x any point
in X. The component in X of x, CX(x), is deﬁned to be the union of
all connected subsets of X which contain x.
8.4.2
Proposition.
Let x be any point in a topological space
(X,τ). Then CX(x) is connected.
Proof.
Let {Ci : i ∈I} be the family of all connected subsets of
(X,τ) which contain x. (Observe that {x} ∈{Ci : i ∈I}.) Then
CX(x) =

i∈I Ci. Let O be a subset of CX(x) which is clopen in the
topology induced on CX(x) by τ. Then O∩Ci is clopen in the induced
topology on Ci, for each i. But as each Ci is connected, O ∩Ci = Ci
or Ø, for each i. If O ∩Cj = Cj for some j ∈I, then x ∈O. So, in
this case, O ∩Ci ̸= Ø, for all i ∈I as each Ci contains x. Therefore
O∩Ci = Ci, for all i ∈I or O∩Ci = Ø, for all i ∈I; that is, O = CX(x)
or O = Ø. So CX(x) has no proper non-empty clopen subset and hence
is connected.
8.4.3
Remark.
We see from Deﬁnition 8.4.1 and Proposition 8.4.2
that CX(x) is the largest connected subset of X which contains x.
8.4.4
Lemma.
Let a and b be points in a topological space (X,τ).
If there exists a connected set C containing both a and b then CX(a) =
CX(b).
Proof.
By Deﬁnition 8.4.1, CX(a) ⊇C and CX(b) ⊇C. Therefore
a ∈CX(b).
By Proposition 8.4.2, CX(b) and so is a connected set
containing a. Thus, by Deﬁnition 8.4.1, CX(a) ⊇CX(b). Similarly
CX(b) ⊇CX(a), and we have shown that CX(a) = CX(b).
8.4.5
Proposition.
Let (X1,τ1), (X2,τ2), . . . , (Xn,τn) be topo-
logical spaces.
Then
n
i=1(Xi,τi) is connected if and only if each
(Xi,τi) is connected.
Proof.
To show that the product of a ﬁnite number of connected
spaces is connected, it suﬃces to prove that the product of any two
connected spaces is connected, as the result then follows by induction.
So let (X,τ) and (Y,τ1) be connected spaces and ⟨x0, y0⟩any point
in the product space (X × Y,τ2). Let ⟨x1, y1⟩be any other point in

140
Topology Without Tears
X × Y . Then the subspace {x0} × Y of (X × Y,τ) is homeomorphic
to the connected space (Y,τ1) and so is connected.
Similarly the
subspace X × {y1} is connected.
Furthermore, ⟨x0, y1⟩lies in the
connected space {x0} × Y , so CX×Y (⟨x0, y1⟩) ⊇{x0} × Y ∋⟨x0, y0⟩,
while ⟨x0, y1⟩∈X × {y1}, and so CX×Y ((x0, y1)) ⊇X × {y1} ∋(x1, y1).
Thus ⟨x0, y0⟩and ⟨x1, y1⟩lie in the connected set CX×Y (⟨x0, y1⟩),
and so by Lemma 8.4.4, CX×Y (⟨x0, y0⟩) = CX×Y (⟨x1, y1⟩). In partic-
ular, ⟨x1, y1⟩∈CX×Y (⟨x0, y0⟩). As ⟨x1, y1⟩was an arbitrary point in
X × Y , CX×Y (⟨x0, y0⟩) = X × Y. Hence (X × Y,τ2) is connected.
Conversely if
n
i=1(Xi,τi) is connected then Propositions 8.2.5 and
5.2.1 imply that each (Xi,τi).
8.4.6
Remark.
In Exercises 5.2 #9 the following result appears:
For any point x in any topological space (X,τ), CX(x) is a closed set.
8.4.7
Deﬁnition.
A topological space is said to be a continuum
if it is compact and connected.
As an immediate consequence of Theorem 8.3.1 and Propositions
8.4.5 and 8.3.2 we have the following proposition.
8.4.8
Proposition.
Let (X1,τ1), (X2,τ2), . . . , (Xn,τn) be topo-
logical spaces. Then
n
i=1(Xi,τi) is a continuum if and only if each
(Xi,τi) is a continuum.
Exercises 8.4

and metrizable. Let (X1,τ1), (X2, T2), . . . , (Xn,τn) be topolgical

n

(ii) Using (i) show that if the metrizable space (X,τ) is connected and
X has at least 2 points, then X has the uncountable number of
points.

3. If (X,τ) and (Y,τ1) are path-connected spaces, prove that the
product space (X,τ) × (Y,τ1) is path-connected.

. . . × CXn(xn).
(ii) Deduce from (i) and Exercises 5.2 #10 that

(i) R, with the group operation being addition, is a topological group.
(ii) Let T be the subset of the complex plane consisting of those

Fundamental Theorem of Algebra
In this section we give an application of topology to another branch of
mathematics. We show how to use compactness and the Generalized
Heine-Borel Theorem to prove the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.
8.5.1
Theorem.
(The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra)
Every polynomial f(z) = anzn + an−1zn−1 + . . . + a1z + a0, where each
ai is a complex number, an ̸= 0, and n ≥1, has a root; that is, there
exists a complex number z0 s.t. f(z0) = 0.

Then |f(0)| = p0 = |a0|. So there exists a T > 0 such that
|f(z)| > p0,
for all |z| > T
(1)

144
Topology Without Tears
Consider the set D = {z : z ∈complex plane and |z| ≤T}. This
is a closed bounded subset of the complex plane C = R2 and so,
by the Generalized Heine-Borel Theorem, is compact. Therefore, by
Proposition 7.2.14, the continuous function |f| : D →R has a least
value at some point z0. So
|f(z0)| ≤|f(z)|,
for all z ∈D.
By (1), for all z /∈D, |f(z)| > p0 = |f(0)| ≥|f(z0)|. Therefore
|f(z0)| ≤|f(z)|,
for all z ∈C
(2)
Thus it is enough to prove that f(z0) = 0. To do this it is con-
venient to perform a ‘translation’. Put P(z) = f(z + z0). Then, by
(2),
|P(0)| ≤|P(z)|,
for all z ∈C
(3)
The problem of showing that f(z0) = 0 is now converted to the
equivalent one of proving that P(0) = 0.
Now P(z) = bnzn + bn−1zn−1 . . . + b0,
bi ∈C. So P(0) = b0.
We shall show that b0 = 0. Suppose b0 ̸= 0. Then
P(z) = b0 + bkzk + zk+1Q(z)
where Q(z) is a polynomial and bk is the smallest bi ̸= 0,
i > 0.
[e.g. if P(z) = 10z7 + 6z5 + 3z4 + 4z3 + 2z2 + 1, then b0 = 1, bk = 2,
(b1 = 0), and
P(z) = 1 + 2z2 + z3
Q(z)

(4 + 3z + 6z2 + 10z4) .]
Let w ∈C be a kth root of the number −b0/bk; that is, wk = −b0/bk.
As Q(z) is a polynomial, for t a real number,
t |Q(tw)| →0,
as t →0
This implies that t |wk+1Q(tw)| →0
as t →0. So
there exists 0 < t0 < 1 such that t0 |wk+1Q(t0w)| < |b0|
(4)
P(t0w) = b0 + bk(t0w)k + (t0w)k+1Q(t0w)

But (5) contradicts (3). Therefore the supposition that b0 ̸= 0 is false;
that is, P(0) = 0, as required.

Postscript
As mentioned in the introduction, this is one of three sections devoted
to the study of product spaces. The easiest case is the one we have just
completed – ﬁnite products. In the next section we study countably
inﬁnite products and in Chapter 10, the general case.
The most
important result proved in this section is Tychonoﬀ’s Theorem.* In
Chapter 10 this is generalized to arbitrary sized products.
The second result we called a theorem here is the Generalized
Heine-Borel Theorem which characterizes the compact subsets of Rn
as those which are closed and bounded.
Exercises 8.4 #5 introduced the notion of topological group, that
is a set with the structure of both a topological space and a group, and
with the two structures related in an appropriate manner. Topological
group theory is a rich and interesting branch of mathematics. Exercises
8.3 #1 introduced the notion of locally compact topological space.
Such spaces play a central role in topological group theory.
Our study of connectedness has been furthered in this section by
deﬁning the component of a point. This allows us to partition any
topological space into connected sets. In a connected space like Rn the
component of any point is the whole space. At the other end of the
scale, the components in any totally disconnected space, for example,
Q, are all singleton sets.
As mentioned above, compactness has a local version.
So too
does connectedness. Exercises 8.4 #6 deﬁned locally connected. Note,
however, that while every compact space is locally compact, not every
connected space is locally connected. Indeed many properties P have
local versions called locally P, and P usually does not imply locally
P and locally P usually does not imply P.
At the end of the chapter we gave a topological proof of the
Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. Hopefully the fact that a theorem
in one branch of mathematics can be proved using methods from
another branch will suggest to you that mathematics should not be
compartmentalized. While you may have separate courses on algebra,
topology, complex analysis, and number theory these topics are, in
fact, interrelated.
* You should have noticed how sparingly we use the word “theorem”, so when we do use that
term it is because the result is important.

147
In the next section we are faced with a problem – how do extend
our deﬁnition of product space to countable products? As pointed out
in Remark 8.2.6, Proposition 8.2.5 provides the bridge to the case of
inﬁnite products.
For those who know some category theory, we observe that the cat-
egory of topological spaces and continuous mappings has both products
and coproducts. The products in the category are indeed the products
of the topological spaces. You may care to identify the coproducts.

CHAPTER 9
Countable Products
Intuition tells us that a curve has zero area.
Thus you should be
astonished to learn of the existence of space-ﬁlling curves. We attack
this topic using the curious space known as the Cantor Space.
It
is surprising that an examination of this space leads us to a better
understanding of the properties of the unit interval [0, 1].
154

9.1
The Cantor Set
9.1.1
Remark.
We now construct a very curious (but useful) set
known as the Cantor Set. Consider the closed unit interval [0,1] and
delete from it the open interval (1
2, 2
3), which is the middle third, and
denote the remaining closed set by G1. So
G1 = [0, 1/3] ∪[2/3, 1] .
Next, delete from G1 the open intervals (1
9, 2
9) and (7
9, 8
9) which are the
middle third of its two pieces and denote the remaining closed set by
G2. So
G2 = [0, 1/9] ∪[2/9, 1/3] ∪[2/3, 7/9] ∪[8/9, 1] .
If we continue in this way, at each stage deleting the open middle third
of each closed interval remaining from the previous stage we obtain a
descending sequence of closed sets
G1 ⊃G2 ⊃G3 ⊃. . . Gn ⊃. . . .
The Cantor Set, G, is deﬁned by
G =
∞

n=1
Gn
and, being the intersection of closed sets, is a closed subset of [0,1]. As
[0,1] is compact, the Cantor Space (G,τ), (that is, G with the subspace
topology) is compact. [The Cantor Set is named after the famous set
theorist, George Cantor (1845–1918).]
It is useful to represent the Cantor Set in terms of real numbers
written to base 3; that is, ternaries. You are familiar with the decimal
expansion of real numbers which uses base 10. Today one cannot avoid

156
Topology Without Tears
computers which use base 2. But for the Cantor Set, base 3 is what is
best.
In the ternary system, 76 5
31 would be written as 2211·0012, since
this represents
2.33 + 2.32 + 1.31 + 1.30 + 0.3−1 + 0.3−2 + 1.3−3 + 2.3−4.
So a number x in [0, 1] is represented by the base 3 number ·a1a2a3 . . . an . . .,
where
x =

1 = 0·2222 . . .
(Of course another ternary expression for 1
3 is 0·10000 . . . and another
for 1 is 1·0000 . . .. )
Turning again to the Cantor Set, G, it should be clear that an
element of [0, 1] is in G, if and only if it can be written in ternary form

f is one-to-one and onto. Later on we shall make use of this function
f.

The Product Topology
9.2.1
Deﬁnition.
Let (X1,τ1), (X2, T2), . . ., (Xn, T ), . . . be a
countably inﬁnite family of topological spaces.
Then the product
∞
i=1 Xi of the sets Xi, i = 1, 2, . . . , n, . . .
consists of all the inﬁ-
nite sequences ⟨x1, x2, x3, . . . , xn, . . .⟩, where xi ∈Xi for all i. (The
inﬁnite sequence ⟨x1, x2, . . . , xn, . . .⟩is sometimes written as
∞
i=1 xi.)
The product space
∞
i=1(Xi,τi) consists of the product
∞
i=1 Xi with the
topology τ having as its basis the family
B =



∞

i=1
Oi : Oi ∈τi and 0i = Xi for all but a ﬁnite number of i.



The topology τ is called the product topology.
So a basic open set is of the form
O1 × O2 × . . . × On × Xn+1 × Xn+2 × . . . .
WARNING.
It should be obvious that a product of open sets need
not be open in the product topology τ. In particular, if O1, O2, O3, . . . , On, . . .
are such that each Oi ∈τi, and Oi ̸= Xi for all i, then
∞
i=1 Oi cannot
be expressed as a union of members of B and so is not open in the
product space (
∞
i=1 Xi,τ).

159
9.2.2
Remark.
Why do we choose to deﬁne the product topology
as in Deﬁnition 9.2.1? The answer is that only with this deﬁnition do
we obtain Tychonoﬀ’s Theorem (for inﬁnite products), which says that
any product of compact spaces is compact. And this result is extremely
important for applications.
9.2.3
Example.
Let (X1,τ1), (X2, T2), . . . , (Xn, Tn), . . . be a count-
ably inﬁnite family of topological spaces. Then the box topology τ′ on
the product
∞
i=1 Xi, is that topology having as its basis the family
B′ = {
∞

i=1
Oi : Oi ∈τi}.
It is readily seen that if each (Xi,τi) is a discrete space, then the
box product (
∞
i=1 Xi,τ′) is a discrete space. So if each (Xi,τ) is a ﬁnite
set with the discrete topology, then (
∞
i=1 Xi,τ′) is an inﬁnite discrete
space, which is certainly not compact. So we have a box product of
the compact spaces (Xi,τi) being a non-compact space.
Another justiﬁcation for our choice of deﬁnition of the product
topology is the next proposition which is the analogue for countably
inﬁnite products of Proposition 8.2.5.
9.2.4
Proposition.
Let (X1,τ1), (X2, T2), . . . , (Xn, Tn), . . . be a
countably inﬁnite family of topological space and (
∞
i=1 Xi,τ) their
product space. For each i, let pi:
∞
j=1 Xj →Xi be the projection map-
ping; that is pi(⟨x1, x2, . . . , xn, . . .⟩) = xi for each ⟨x1, x2, . . . , xn, . . .⟩∈
∞
j=1 Xj. Then
(i) each pi is a continuous surjective open mapping, and
(ii) τ is the coarsest topology on the set
∞
j=1 Xj such that each pi is
continuous.
Proof.
The proof is analogous to that of Proposition 8.2.5 and so
left as an exercise.
We shall use the next proposition a little later.
9.2.5
Proposition.
Let (Xi,τi) and (Yi,τ′
i), i = 1, 2, . . . , n, . . .
be countably inﬁnite families of topological spaces having product
spaces (
∞
i=1 Xi,τ) and (
∞
i=1 Yi,τ′), respectively.
If hi: (Xi,τi) →

160
Topology Without Tears
(Yi, T ′
i ) is a continuous mapping for each i, then so is the mapping
h: (
∞
i=1 Xi,τ) →(
∞
i=1 Yi,τ′) given by h: (
∞
i=1 xi) =
∞
i=1 hi(xi); that
is, h(⟨x1, x2, . . . , xn, . . .⟩) = ⟨h1(x1), h2(x2), . . . , hn(xn), . . .⟩.
Proof.
It suﬃces to show that if O is a basic open set in (
∞
i=1 Yi,τ′),
then h−1(O) is open in (
∞
i=1 Xi,τ).
Consider the basic open set
U1 × U2 × . . . Un × Yn+1Yn+2 × . . . where Ui ∈τ′
i, for i = 1, . . . , n.
Then
h−1(U1 × U2 × . . . × Un × Yn+1 × Yn+2 × . . .)
=h−1
1 (U1 × h−1
2 (U2) × . . . × h−1
n (Un) × Xn+1 × Xn+2 × . . .
and the set on the right hand side is in τ, since the continuity of each
hi implies h−1
i (Ui) ∈τi, for i = 1, . . . , n. So h is continuous.

9.3
The Cantor Space and the Hilbert Cube
9.3.1
Remark.
We now return to the Cantor Space and prove
that it is homeomorphic to a countably inﬁnite product of two-point
spaces.
For each i ∈{1, 2, ..., n, ...} we let (Ai,τi) be the set {0, 2} with
the discrete topology, and consider the product space (
∞
i=1 Ai,τ′). We
show in the next proposition that it is homeomorphic to the Cantor
Space (G,τ).
9.3.2
Proposition.
Let (G,τ) be the Cantor Space and (
∞
i=1 Ai,τ′)
be as in Remark 9.3.1. Then the map f: (G,τ) −→(
∞
i=1 Ai, T ′) given
by f(
∞
n=1
an
3n) = ⟨a1, a2, . . . , an, . . .⟩is a homeomorphism.
Proof.
We have already noted in Remark 9.1.1 that f is one-to-
one and onto.
As (G,τ) is compact and (
∞
i=1 Ai, T ′) is Hausdorﬀ
(Exercises 9.2 #4) Exercises 7.2 #6 says that f is a homeomorphism
if it is continuous.
To prove the continuity of f it suﬃces to show for any basic open
set U = U1 × U2 × . . . × UN × AN+1 × AN+2 × . . . and any point
a = ⟨a1, a2, . . . , an, . . .⟩∈U there exists an open set W ∋

that f(W) ⊆U.

let W

(G,τ) and if x =
∞
n=1
xn
3n ∈W, then xi = ai, for i = 1, 2, . . . , N. So
f(x) ∈U1 × U2 × . . . Un × AN+1 × AN+2 × . . . , and thus f(W) ⊆U, as
required.

164
Topology Without Tears
As indicated earlier, we shall in due course prove that any product
of compact spaces is compact – that is, Tychonoﬀ’s Theorem. However
in view of Proposition 9.3.2 we can show, trivially, that the product
of a countable number of homeomorphic copies of the Cantor Space is
homeomorphic to the Cantor Space, and hence is compact.
9.3.3
Proposition.
Let (Gi,τi), i = 1, 2, . . . n, . . . , be a countably
inﬁnite family of topological spaces each of which is homeomorphic to
the Cantor Space (G,τ). Then
(G,τ) ∼=
∞

i=1
(Gi,τi) ∼=
n

i=1
(Gi, Ti)
for each n ≥1.
Proof.
Firstly we verify that (G,τ) ∼= (G1,τ1) × (G2,τ2). This is,
by virtue of Proposition 9.3.2, equivalent to showing that
∞

i=1
(Ai,τi) ∼=
∞

i=1
(Ai,τi) ×
∞

i=1
(Ai,τi)
where each (Ai,τi) is the set {0, 2} with the discrete topology.
Now we deﬁne a function θ from the set
∞
i=1(Ai,τi) ×
∞
i=1(Ai, Ti)
to the set
∞
i=1(Ai,τi) by
θ(⟨a1, a2, a3, . . .⟩, ⟨b1, b2, b3, . . .⟩) −→⟨a1, b1, a2, b2, a3, b3, . . .⟩
It is readily veriﬁed that θ is a homeomorphism and so (G1,τ1) ×
(G2,τ2) ∼= (G, T ). By induction, then, (G,τ) ∼=
n
i=1(Gi, Ti), for every
positive integer n.
Turning to the inﬁnite product case, deﬁne the mapping

= ⟨a1, a2, b1, a3, b2, c1, a4, b3, c2, d1, a5, b4, c3, d2, e1, . . .⟩.
Again it is easily veriﬁed that φ is a homeomorphism, and the
proof is complete.

165
9.3.4
Remark.
It should be observed that the statement (G,τ) ∼=
∞
i=1(Gi,τi), in Proposition 9.3.3, is perhaps more transparent if we
write it as
(A,τ)×(A,τ)×. . . ∼= [(A,τ)×(A,τ)×. . .]×[(A,τ)×(A, T )×. . .] . . .
where (A,τ) is the set {0, 2} with the discrete topology.
9.3.5
Proposition.
The topological space [0, 1] is a continuous
image of the Cantor Space (G,τ).
Proof.
In view of Proposition 9.3.2 it suﬃces to ﬁnd a continuous
mapping φ of
∞
i=1(Ai,τi) onto [0, 1]. Such a mapping is given by
φ(⟨a1, a2, . . . , ai, . . .⟩) =
∞

i=1
ai
2i+1.
Recalling that each ai ∈{0, 2} and that each number x ∈[0, 1] has a
dyadic expansion of the form
∞
j=1
bj
2j, where bj ∈{0, 1}, we see that
φ is an onto mapping. To show that φ is continuous it suﬃces, by
Proposition 5.1.7, to verify that if U is the open interval



i=1


i=1

then there exists an open set W ∋⟨a1, a2, . . . , ai, . . .⟩such that φ(W) ⊆
U. Choose N suﬃciently large that
∞
i=N
ai
2i+1 < ε, and put
W = {a1} × {a2} × . . . × {aN} × AN+1 × AN+2 × . . . .
Then W is open in
∞
i=1(Ai,τi), W ∋⟨a1, a2, . . . , ai, . . .⟩, and φ(W) ⊆
U, as required.
9.3.6
Remark.
You should be somewhat surprised by Proposition
9.3.5 as it says that the “nice” space [0,1] is a continuous image of the
very curious Cantor Space. However, we shall see in due course that
every compact metric space is a continuous image of the Cantor Space.
9.3.7
Deﬁnition.
For each positive integer n, let the topological
space (In,τn) be homeomorphic to [0, 1].
Then the product space
∞
n=1(In,τn) is called the Hilbert cube and is denoted by I∞.
The
product space
n
i=1(Ii,τi) is called the n-cube and is denoted by In.

166
Topology Without Tears
We know from Tychonoﬀ’s Theorem for ﬁnite products that In is
compact for each n. We now prove that I∞is compact. (Of course
this result can also be deduced from Tychonoﬀ’s Theorem for inﬁnite
products, which is proved in Chapter 10.)
9.3.8
Theorem.
The Hilbert cube is compact.
Proof.
By Proposition 9.3.5, there is a continuous mapping φn of
(Gn,τn) onto (In,τ′
n), where (Gn,τn) and In,τ′
n) are homeomorphic
to the Cantor Space and [0,1], respectively. Therefore by Proposition
9.2.5 and Exercises 9.2 #2 (b), there is a continuous mapping ψ of
∞
n=1(Gn, Tn) onto
∞
n=1(In,τ′
n) = I∞. But Proposition 9.3.3 says that
∞
n=1(Gn, Tn) is homeomorphic to the Cantor Space (G,τ). Therefore
I∞is a continuous image of the compact space (G,τ), and hence is
compact.

167
9.3.9
Proposition.
Let (Xi,τi), i = 1, 2, . . . , n, . . . , be a count-
ably inﬁnite family of metrizable spaces. Then
∞
i=1(Xi,τi) is metriz-
able.
Proof.
For each i, let di be a metric on Xi which induces the topol-
ogy τi. Exercises 6.1 #2 says that if we put ei(a, b) = min(1, d(a, b)),
for all a and b in X1, then ei is a metric and it induces the topology τi
on Xi. So we can, without loss of generality, assume that di(a, b) ≤1,
for all a and b in Xi, i = 1, 2, . . . , n, . . . .
Deﬁne d:
∞
i=1 Xi ×
∞
i=1 Xi −→R by
d



ai,
∞

i=1
bi

=
∞

i=1
di(ai, bi)
2i
for all ai and bi in Xi.
Observe that the series on the right hand side converges because each
di(ai, bi) ≤1 and so it is bounded above by
∞
i=1
1
2i = 1.
It is easily veriﬁed that d is a metric on
∞
i=1 Xi. Observe that d′
i,
deﬁned by d′
i(a, b) = di(a,b)
2i
, is a metric on Xi, which induces the same
topology τi as di. To see this consider the following. Since
d


∞

i=1
ai ,
∞

i=1
bi

≥di(ai, bi)
2i
= d′
i(ai, bi)
it follows that the projection pi : (
∞
i=1 Xi, d) −→(Xi, d′
i) is continuous,
for each i. As d′
i induces the topology τ′
i, Proposition 9.2.4 (ii) implies
that the topology induced on
∞
i=1 Xi by d is finer than the product
topology. To prove that it is also coarser, let Bε(a) be any open ball
of radius ε > 0 about a point a =
∞
i=1 ai. So Bε(a) is a basic open
set in the topology induced by d. We have to show that there is a set
W ∋a such that W ⊆Bε(a), and W is open in the product topology.
Let N be a positive integer such that
∞
i=N
1
2i < ε
2. Let Oi be the open
ball in (Xi, di) of radius
ε
2N about the point ai, i = 1, . . . , N. Then
W = O1 × O2 × . . . × ON × XN+1 × XN+2 × . . .
is an open set in the product topology, a ∈W, and clearly W ⊆Bε(a),
as required.

Urysohn’s Theorem
9.4.1
Deﬁnition.
A topological space (X,τ) is said to be sepa-

Exercises 8.1 #9.)
9.4.2
Example.
Q is dense in R, and so R is separable.
9.4.3
Example.
Every countable topological space is separable.

Proposition.
Let (X,τ) be a compact metrizable space.
Then (X,τ) is separable.
Proof.
Let d be a metric on X which induces the topology T . For
each positive integer n, let Sn be the family of all open balls having
centres in X and radius 1
n. Then Sn is an open covering of X and so
there is a ﬁnite subcovering Un = {Un1, Un2, . . . , Unk}, for some nk. Let
ynj be the centre of Unj, j = 1, . . . , k, and Yn = {yn1, yn2, . . . , ynk}. Put
Y =
∞
n=1 Yn. Then Y is a countable subset of X. We now show that
Y is dense in (X,τ).
If V is any non-empty open set in (X,τ), then for any v ∈V , V
contains an open ball, B, of radius 1
n, about v, for some n. As Un is
an open cover of X, v ∈Unj, for some j. Thus d(v, ynj) < 1
n and so
ynj ∈B ⊆V . Hence V ∩Y ̸= Ø, and so Y is dense in X.
9.4.5
Corollary.
The Hilbert cube is a separable space.
We shall prove shortly the very striking Urysohn Theorem which
shows that every compact metrizable space is homeomorphic to a
subspace of the Hilbert cube. En route we prove the (countable version
of the) Embedding Lemma.
First we record the following proposition, which is Exercises 9.3
#3 and so its proof is not included here.
9.4.6
Proposition.
Let (Xi,τi), i = 1, 2, . . . , n, . . . be a count-
ably inﬁnite family of topological spaces and f a mapping of a topolog-
ical space (Y,τ) into
∞
i=1(Xi, Ti). Then f is continuous if and only if
each mapping pi ◦f: (Y,τ) −→(Xi,τi) is continuous, where pi denotes
the projection mapping.

Lemma.
(The Embedding Lemma)
Let (Yi,τi), i =
1, 2, . . . , n, . . ., be a countably inﬁnite family of topological spaces and
for each i, let fi be a mapping of a topological space (X,τ) into (Yi,τi).
Further, let e: (X,τ) −→
∞
i=1(Yi,τi) be the evaluation map; that is,
e(x) =
∞
i=1 fi(x), for all x ∈X. Then e is a homeomorphism of (X,τ)
onto the space (e(X),τ′), where τ′ is the subspace topology on e(X),
if
(i) each fi is continuous,
(ii) the family {fi : i = 1, 2, . . . , n, . . .} separates points of X; that is, if
x1 and x2 are in X with x1 ̸= x2, then for some i, fi(x1) ̸= fi(x2),
and
(iii) the family {fi : i = 1, 2, . . . , n, . . .} separates points and closed sets;
that is, for x ∈X and A any closed subset of (X,τ) not containing
x, fi(x) /∈fi(A), for some i.
Proof.
That the mapping e : (X,τ) −→(e(X), T ′) is onto is
obvious, while condition (ii) clearly implies that it is one-to-one.
As pi◦e = fi is a continuous mapping of(X,τ) into (Yi,τi), for each
i, Proposition 9.4.6 implies that the mapping e : (X,τ) −→
∞
i=1(Yi, Ti)
is continuous. Hence e : (X,τ) −→(e(X), T ′) is continuous.
To prove that e: (X,τ) −→(e(X),τ′) is an open mapping, it
suﬃces to verify that for each U ∈τ and x ∈U, there exists a set W ∈
τ′ such that e(x) ∈W ⊆e(U). As the family fi, i = 1, 2, . . . , n, . . .
separates points and closed sets, there exists a j ∈{1, 2, . . . , n, . . .}
such that fj(x) /∈fj(X \ U). Put
W = (Y1 × Y2 × . . .× Yj−1 × [Yj \ fj(X \ U)]× Yj+1 × Yj+2 × . . .)∩e(X).
Then clearly e(x) ∈W and W ∈τ′. It remains to show that W ⊆
e(U). So let e(t) ∈W. Then
fj(t) ∈Yj \ fj(X \ U)
⇒fj(t) /∈fj(X \ U)
⇒fj(t) /∈fj(X \ U)
⇒t /∈X \ U
⇒t ∈U.
So e(t) ∈e(U) and hence W ⊆e(U). Therefore e is a homeomorphism.

173
9.4.8
Deﬁnition.
A topological space (X,τ) is said to be a T1-space
if every singleton set {x}, x ∈X, is a closed set.
9.4.9
Remark.
It is easily veriﬁed that every Hausdorﬀspace (i.e.
T2-space) is a T1-space. The converse, however, is false. (See Exercises
4.1 #13 and Exercises 1.3 #3.) In particular, every metrizable space
is a T1-space.
9.4.10
Corollary.
If (X,τ) in Lemma 9.4.9 is a T1-space, then
condition (ii) is implied by condition (iii) (and so is superﬂuous).
Proof.
Let x1 and x2 be any distinct points in X.
Putting A
equal to the closed set {x2}, condition (iii) implies that for some i,
fi(x1) /∈{fi(x2)}. Hence fi(xi) ̸= fi(x2), and condition (ii) is satisﬁed.

9.4.11
Theorem.
(Urysohn’s Theorem)
Every separable metric
space (X, d) is homeomorphic to a subspace of the Hilbert cube.
Proof.
By Corollary 9.4.10 this result will follow if we can ﬁnd a
countably inﬁnite family of mappings fi: (X, d) −→[0, 1], which are (i)
continuous, and (ii) separate points and closed sets.
Without loss of generality we can assume that d(a, b) ≤1, for all
a and b in X, since every metric is equivalent to such a metric.
As (X, d) is separable, there exists a countable dense subset Y =
{y1, y2, . . .}. For each i ∈{1, 2, . . . , } deﬁne fi: X −→[0, 1] by fi(x) =
d(x, yi). It is clear that each mapping fi is continuous.
To see that the mappings {fi} separate points and closed sets, let
x ∈X and A be any closed set not containing x. Now X \A is an open
set about x and so contains an open ball B of radius ε and centre x,
for some ε > 0. Further, as Y is dense in X, there exists a yn such that
d(yn, x) < ε
2. Thus d(yn, a) ≥ε
2, for all a ∈A. So [0, ε/2] is an open
set in [0, 1] which contains fn(x) but contains no point of A. Hence
fn(x) /∈fn(A) and thus the family {fi} separates points and closed
sets.
9.4.12
Corollary.
Every compact metrizable space is homeo-
morphic to a closed subspace of the Hilbert cube.
9.4.13
Corollary.
If for each i ∈{1, 2, . . . , }, (Xi,τi) is a compact
metrizable space, then
∞
i=1(Xi, Ti) is compact and metrizable.
Proof.
That
∞
i=1(Xi,τi) is metrizable was proved in Proposition
9.3.9. That
∞
i=1(Xi,τi) is compact follows from Corollary 9.4.12 and
Exercises 9.3 #9 (ii).

175
Our next task is to verify the converse of Urysohn’s Theorem. To
do this we introduce a new concept. (See Exercises 2.2 #4.)
9.4.14
Deﬁnition.
A topological space (X,τ) is said to satisfy
the second axiom of countability (or to be second countable) if there
exists a basis B for τ such that B consists of only a countable number
of sets.
9.4.15
Example.
Let B = {(q−1
n, q+ 1
n) : q rational, n = 1, 2, . . .}.
Then B is a basis for the usual topology on R. (Verify this). Therefore
R is second countable.
9.4.16
Example.
Let (X,τ) be an uncountable set with the dis-
crete topology. Then as every singleton set must be in any basis for
τ, (X,τ) does not have any countable basis. So (X,τ) is not second
countable.
9.4.17
Proposition.
Let (X, d) be a metric space and τ the
corresponding topology. Then (X,τ) is a separable space if and only
if it satisﬁes the second axiom of countability.
Proof.
Let (X,τ) be separable.
Then it has a countable dense
subset Y = {y1, y2, . . .}. Let B consist of all the open balls (in the
metric d) with centre yi, for some i, and radius 1
n, for some positive
integer n. Clearly B is countable and we shall show that it is a basis
for τ.
Let V ∈τ. Then for any v ∈V , V contains an open ball, B,
of radius 1
n about v, for some n. As Y is dense in X, there exists a
ym ∈Y , such that d(ym, v) <
1
2n. Let B′ be the open ball with centre
ym and radius
1
2n. Then the triangle inequality implies B′ ⊆B ⊆V .
Also B′ ∈B. Hence B is a basis for τ. So (X,τ) is second countable.
Conversely let (X,τ) be second countable, having a countable basis
B1 = {B1, B2, . . .}. For each Bi ̸= Ø, let bi be any element of Bi, and
put Z equal to the set of all such bi. Then Z is a countable set. Further,
if V ∈τ, then V ⊇Bi, for some i, and so bi ∈V. Thus V ∩Z ̸= Ø.
Hence Z is dense in X. Consequently (X, T ) is separable.
9.4.18
Remark.
The above proof shows that any second count-
able space is separable, even without the assumption of metrizability.
However, it is not true, in general, that a separable space is second
countable. (See Exercises 9.4 #11.)

9.4.19
Theorem.
(Urysohn’s Theorem and its converse)
Let
(X, T ) be a topological space. Then (X,τ) is separable and metrizable
if and only if it is homeomorphic to a subspace of the Hilbert cube.
Proof.
If (X,τ) is separable and metrizable, then Urysohn’s The-
orem 9.4.11 says that it is homeomorphic to a subspace of the Hilbert
cube.
Conversely, let (X,τ) be homeomorphic to the subspace (Y,τ1)
of the Hilbert cube I∞. By Proposition 9.4.4, I∞is separable. So,
by Proposition 9.4.17, it is second countable.
It is readily veriﬁed
(Exercises 4.1 #14) that any subspace of a second countable space
is second countable, and hence (Y,τ1) is second countable. It is also
easily veriﬁed (Exercises 6.1 #6) that any subspace of a metrizable
space is metrizable. As the Hilbert cube is metrizable, by Corollary
9.3.10, its subspace (Y,τ1) is metrizable. So (Y,τ1) is metrizable and
satisﬁes the second axiom of countability. Therefore it is separable.
Hence (X,τ) is also separable and metrizable.

(ii) Let X = R2, d the Euclidean metric on R2 and d′ the metric on
X given by d′(x, y) = d(x, 0) + d(0, y) if x ̸= y and d′(x, y) = 0 if
x = y. Let τ be the topology induced on X by the metric d′. The
metric d′ is called the Post Oﬃce Metric. A topological space is
said to be extremely disconnected if the closure of every open set
is open. Prove the following:

9.5 Peano’s Theorem
9.5.1
Remark.
In the proof of Theorem 9.3.8 we showed that the
Hilbert cube I∞is a continuous image of the Cantor Space (G,τ). In
fact, every compact metric space is a continuous image of the Cantor
Space. The next proposition is a step in this direction.
9.5.2
Proposition.
Every separable metrizable space (X,τ1) is a
continuous image of a subspace of the Cantor Space (G,τ). Further,
if (X,τ1) is compact, then the subspace is closed in (G,τ).
Proof.
Let φ be the continuous mapping of (G,τ) onto I∞shown
to exist in the proof of Theorem 9.3.8. By Urysohn’s Theorem, (X,τ1)
is homeomorphic to a subspace (Y,τ2) of I∞. Let the homeomorphism
of (Y,τ2) onto (X,τ1) be Θ. Let Z = ψ−1(Y ) and τ3 be the subspace
topology on Z. Then Θ ◦ψ is a continuous mapping of (Z,τ3) onto
(X,τ1). So (X,τ1) is a continuous image of the subspace (Z,τ3) of
(G,τ).
Further if (X,τ1) is compact, then (Y,τ2) is compact and
hence closed in I∞. Hence Z = ψ−1(Y ) is a closed subset of (G,τ), as
required.

181
9.5.3
Proposition.
Let (Y,τ1) be a (non-empty) closed subspace
of the Cantor Space (G,τ). Then there exists a continuous mapping
of (G,τ) onto (Y,τ1).
Proof.
Clearly (G,τ) is homeomorphic to the middle two-third’s
Cantor Space (G′,τ′) which consists of the set of all real numbers
which can be written in the form
∞
i=1
a1
6i , where ai = 0 or 5, with
the subspace topology induced from [0, 1]. We can regard (Y,τ1) as a
closed subspace of (G′,τ′) and seek a continuous mapping of (G′,τ′)
onto (Y,τ1). Before proceeding, observe that if g1 ∈G′ and g2 ∈G′,
then g1+g2
2
/∈G′.
The map ψ : (G′,τ′) −→(Y,τ1) which we seek is deﬁned as follows:
for g ∈G′, ψ(g) is the unique element of Y which is closest to g in
the usual metric on R. However we have to prove that such a unique
closest element exists.
Fix g ∈G′. Then the map dg: (Y,τ1) −→R given by dg(y) = |g−y|
is continuous. As (Y,τ1) is compact, Proposition 7.2.15 implies that
dg(Y ) has a least element. So there exists an element of (Y,τ1) which
is closest to g. Suppose there are two such elements y1 and y2 in Y
which are equally close to g. Then g = y1+y2
2
. But y1 ∈G′ and y2 ∈G′
and so, as observed above, g = y1+y2
2
/∈G′, which is a contradiction.
So there exists a unique element of Y which is closest to g. Call this
element ψ(g).
It is clear that the map ψ: (G′,τ′) −→(Y,τ1) is surjective, since
for each y ∈Y , ψ(y) = y. To prove continuity of ψ, let g ∈G′. Let ε be
any given positive real number. Then it suﬃces, by Corollary 6.2.4, to
ﬁnd a δ > 0, such that if x ∈G′ and |g −x| < δ then |ψ(g)−ψ(x)| < ε.
Consider ﬁrstly the case when g ∈Y , so ψ(g) = g. Put δ = ε
2.
Then for x ∈G′ with |g −x| < δ we have
|ψ(g) −ψ(x)| = |g −ψ(x)|
≤|x −ψ(x)| + |g −x|
≤|x −g| + |g −x|, by deﬁnition of ψ since g ∈Y
= 2|x −g|
< 2δ
= ε, as required.
Now consider the case when g /∈Y , so g ̸= ψ(g).
Without loss of generality, assume ψ(g) < g and put a = g −ψ(g).

182
Topology Without Tears
If the set Y ∩[g, 1] = Ø, then ψ(x) = ψ(g) for all x ∈(g −a
2, g + a
2).
Thus for δ < a
2, we have |ψ(x) −ψ(g)| = 0 < ε, as required.
If Y ∩[g, 1] ̸= Ø, then as Y ∩[g, 1] is compact it has a least element
y > g.
Indeed by the deﬁnition of ψ, if b = y −g, then b > a.
Now put δ = b−a
2 .
So if x ∈G′ with |g −x| < δ, then either ψ(x) = ψ(g) or ψ(x) = y.
Observe that
|x −ψ(g)| ≤|x −g| + |g −ψ(g)| < δ + a = b −a
2
+ a = b
2 + a
2
while
|x −y| ≥|g −y| −|g −x| ≥b −b −a
2
= b
2 + a
2.
So ψ(x) = ψ(g).
Thus |ψ(x) −ψ(g)| = 0 < ε, as required. Hence ψ is continuous.

183
Thus we obtain from Propositions 9.5.2 and 9.5.3 the following
theorem of Alexandroﬀand Urysohn:
9.5.4
Theorem.
Every compact metrizable space is a continuous
image of the Cantor Space.
9.5.5
Remark.
The converse of Theorem 9.5.4 is false. It is not
true that every continuous image of a Cantor Space is a compact
metrizable space. (Find an example.) However, an analogous state-
ment is true if we look only at Hausdorﬀspaces. Indeed we have the
following proposition.
9.5.6
Proposition.
Let f be a continuous mapping of a compact
metric space (X, d) onto a Hausdorﬀspace (Y,τ1).
Then (Y, T1) is
compact and metrizable.
Proof.
Since every continuous image of a compact space is compact,
(Y,τ1) is certainly compact.
We deﬁne a metric d1 on Y as follows:
d1(y1, y2) = inf{d(a, b) : a ∈f −1{y1} and b ∈f −1{y2}}
for y1 and y2 in Y.
Since {y1} and {y2} are closed in the Hausdorﬀspace (Y,τ1), f −1{y1}
and f −1{y2} are closed in the compact space (X, d). Hence the sets
f −1{y1} and f −1{y2} are compact.
So the
product
f −1{y1} × f −1{y2},
which
is
a subspace
of
(X,τ) × (X, T ), is compact, where τ is the topology induced by d.
Observing that d: (X,τ)×(X,τ) →R is a continuous mapping, Propo-
sition 7.2.15 implies that d(f −1{y1} × f −1{y2}), has a least element.
So there
exists
an element x1
∈
f −1{y1} and an element
x2 ∈f −1{y2} such that
d(x1, x2) = inf

d(a, b) : a ∈f −1{y1}, b ∈f −1{y2}

= d1(y1, y2).
So if y1 ̸= y2, then f −1
1 {y1} ∩f −1{y2} = Ø.
Thus x1 ̸= x2 and hence d(x1, x2) > 0; that is, d1(y1, y2) > 0.
It is easily veriﬁed that d1 has the other properties required of a
metric, and so is a metric on Y .

184
Topology Without Tears
Let τ2 be the topology induced on Y by d1. We have to show that
τ1 = τ2.
Firstly, by the deﬁnition of d1, f: (Xτ) −→(Y,τ2) is certainly
continuous.
Observe that
C is a closed subset of (Y,τ1)
⇒f −1(C) is a closed subset of (X,τ)
⇒f −1(C) is a compact subset of (X,τ)
⇒f(f −1(C)) is a compact subset of (Y, T2)
⇒C is a compact subset of (Y,τ2)
⇒C is closed in (Y,τ2).
So τ1 ⊆τ2. Similarly τ2 ⊆τ1, and thus τ1 = τ2.
9.5.7
Corollary.
Let (X,τ) be a Hausdorﬀspace. Then it is a
continuous image of the Cantor Space if and only if it is compact and
metrizable.
Finally in this chapter we turn to space-ﬁlling curves.
9.5.8
Remark.
Everyone thinks he (or she) knows what a “curve”
is. Formally we can deﬁne a curve in R2 to be the set f[0, 1], where f
is a continuous map f : [0, 1] −→R2. It seems intuitively clear that a
curve has no breadth and hence zero area. This is false! In fact there
exist space-ﬁlling curves; that is, f(I) has non-zero area. Indeed the
next theorem shows that there exists a continuous mapping of [0, 1]
onto the product space [0, 1] × [0, 1].
9.5.9
Theorem.
(Peano)
For each positive integer n, there
exists a continuous mapping ψn of [0, 1] onto the n-cube In.
Proof.
By Theorem 9.5.4, there exists a continuous mapping φn of
the Cantor Space (G,τ) onto the n-cube In. As (G, T ) is obtained
from [0, 1] by successively dropping out middle thirds, we extend φn
to a continuous mapping ψn : [0, 1] −→In by deﬁning ψn to be linear
on each omitted interval; that is, if (a, b) is one of the open intervals
comprising [0, 1] \ G, then ψn is deﬁned on (a, b) by
ψn (αa + (1 −α) b) = α φn(a) + (1 −α) φn(b),
0 ≤α ≤1.
It is easily veriﬁed that ψn is continuous.

185
We conclude this chapter by stating (but not proving) the
Hahn-Mazurkiewicz Theorem which characterizes those Hausdorﬀspaces
which are continuous images of [0,1]. [For a proof of the theorem see
R.L.Wilder, “Topology of Manifolds”, Amer. Math. Soc. Colloq. Publ.
32 (1949) p. 76 and K. Kuratowski, “Introduction to Set Theory and
Topology”, Permagon Press (1961), p. 221.] But ﬁrst we need a deﬁ-
nition.
9.5.10
Deﬁnition.
A topological space (X,τ) is said to be locally
connected if it has a basis of connected (open) sets.
9.5.11
Remark.
Every discrete space is locally connected as are
Rn and Sn, for all n ≥1. However, not every connected space is locally
connected. (See Exercises 8.4 #6.)
9.5.12
Theorem.
(Hahn-Mazurkiewicz Theorem)
Let (X,τ)
be a Hausdorﬀspace. Then (X,τ) is a continuous image of [0, 1] if and
only if it is compact, connected, locally connected, and metrizable.
Exercises 9.5
1. Let S ⊂R2 be the set of points inside and on the triangle ABC,
which has a right angle at A and satisﬁes AC > AB. This exercise

Let D on BC be such that AD is perpendicular to BC.
Let a =

construct a sequence (Dn) of points of S as follows : D1 is the foot of
the perpendicular from D onto the hypotenuse of the larger or smaller

(i) the sequence (Dn) tends to a limit D(a) in S;
(ii) if λ ∈[0, 1] is represented by distinct binary decimals a, a′ then

Postscript
In this section we have extended the notion of a product of a ﬁnite
number of topological spaces to that of the product of a countable
number of topological spaces. While this step is a natural one, it has
led us to a rich collection of results, some of which are very surprising.
We proved that a countable product of topological spaces with
property P has property P, where P is any of the following:
(i) T0-space
(ii)
T1-space
(iii)
Hausdorﬀ
(iv)
metrizable
(v) connected
(vi) totally disconnected
(vii) second countable.
It
is also true when P is compact, this result being the TychonoﬀThe-
orem for countable products. The proof of the countable Tychonoﬀ
Theorem for metrizable spaces presented here is quite diﬀerent from
the standard one which appears in the next section. Our proof relies
on the Cantor Spaces.
The Cantor Space was deﬁned to be a certain subspace of [0, 1].
Later is was shown that it is homeomorphic to a countably inﬁnite
product of 2-point discrete spaces.
The Cantor Space appears to
be the kind of pathological example pure mathematicians are fond
of producing in order to show that some general statement is false.
But it turns out to be much more than this.
The Alexandroﬀ-Urysohn Theorem says that every compact metriz-
able space is an image of the Cantor Space. In particular [0, 1] and
the Hilbert cube (a countable inﬁnite product of copies of [0, 1]) is a
continuous image of the Cantor Space. This leads us to the existence
of space-ﬁlling curves – in particular, we show that there exists a con-
tinuous map of [0, 1] onto the cube [0, 1]n , for each positive integer n.
We stated, but did not prove, the Hahn-Mazurkiewicz Theorem: The
Hausdorﬀspace (X,τ) is an image of [0, 1] if and only if it is compact
connected locally connected and metrizable.
Finally we mention Urysohn’s Theorem, which says that a space
is separable and metrizable if and only if it is homeomorphic to a
subspace of the Hilbert cube.
This shows that [0, 1] is not just a
“nice” topological space, but a “generator” of the important class
of separable metrizable spaces via the formation of subspaces and
countable products.

In Chapter 9 we deﬁned the product of a countably inﬁnite family
of topological spaces. We now proceed to deﬁne the product of any
family of topological spaces by replacing the set {1, 2, . . . , n, . . .} by an
arbitrary index set I. The central result will be the general Tychonoﬀ
Theorem.

10.1 The Product topology for All Products
10.1.1
Deﬁnitions.
Let I be a set, and for each i ∈I, let (Xi,τi)
be a topological space.
We write the indexed family of topological
spaces as {(Xi,τi) : i ∈I}. Then the product (cartesian product) of
the family of sets {Xi : i ∈I} is denoted by

i∈I Xi, and consists of
the set of all functions f: I −→

i∈I Xi such that fi = xi ∈Xi. We
denote the element f of the product by

i∈I xi, and refer to f(i) = xi
and the ith coordinate.
[If I = {1, 2} then

i∈{1,2} Xi is just the set of all functions f: {1, 2} →
X1 ∪X2 such that f(1) ∈X1 and f(2) ∈X2. A moment’s thought
shows that

i∈{1,2} Xi is a set “isomorphic to” X1 × X2. Similarly if
I = {1, 2, . . . , n, . . .}, then

i∈I Xi is “isomorphic to” our previously
deﬁned
∞
i=1 Xi].
The product space, denoted by

i∈I(Xi,τi), consists of the product
set

i∈I Xi with the topology T having as its basis the family
B =




i∈I
Oi : Oi ∈τi and Oi = Xi, for all but a ﬁnite number of i


.
The topology τ is called the product topology (or the Tychonoﬀtopol-
ogy).
10.1.2
Remark.
Although we have deﬁned

i∈I(Xi,τi) rather
diﬀerently to the way we did when I was countably inﬁnite or ﬁnite you
should be able to convince yourself that when I is countably inﬁnite
or ﬁnite the new deﬁnition is equivalent to our previous ones. Once
this is realized many results on countable products can be proved
for uncountable products in an analogous fashion.
We state them
below. It is left as an exercise for the reader to prove these results for
uncountable products.
10.1.3
Proposition.
Let I be a set and for i ∈I, let Ci be a
closed subset of a topological space (X,τi). Then

i∈I Ci is a closed
subset of

i∈I(Xi,τi).
10.1.4
Proposition.
Let {(Xi,τi) : i ∈I} be a family of topo-
logical spaces having product space (

i∈I Xi,τ). If for each i ∈I, Bi
is a basis for τi, then B′ = {

i∈I Oi : Oi ∈Bi and Oi = Xi for all but
a ﬁnite number of i} is a basis for τ.

Tychonoﬀ’s Theorem
191
10.1.5
Proposition.
Let {(Xi,τi) : i ∈I} be a family of topo-
logical spaces having product space (

i∈I Xi,τ). For each j ∈I, let
pj :

i∈I Xi −→Xj be the projection mapping; that is, pj(

i∈I xi) = xj,
for each

i∈I xi ∈

i∈I Xi. Then
(i) each pj is a continuous surjective open mapping, and
(ii) τ is the coarsest topology on the set

i∈I Xi such that each pj is
continuous.
10.1.6
Proposition.
Let {(Xi,τi) : i ∈I} be a family of topo-
logical spaces with product space

i∈I(Xi,τi). Then each (Xi,τi) is
homeomorphic to a subspace of

i∈I(Xi,τi).
10.1.7
Proposition.
Let {(Xi,τi) : i ∈I} and {(Yi,τ′
i) : i ∈
I} be a family of topological spaces. If hi: (Xi,τi) −→(Yi,τ′
i) is a
continuous mapping, for each i ∈I, then h:

i∈I(Xi,τi) −→

i∈I(Yi,τ′
i)
is continuous, where h(

i∈I xi) =

i∈I hi(xi).
10.1.8
Proposition.
Let {(Xi,τi) : i ∈I} be a family of topo-
logical spaces and f a mapping of a topological space (Y,τ) into

i∈I(Xi,τi). Then f is continuous if and only if each mapping pi ◦f :
(Y,τ) −→(Xi, Ti) is continuous, where pi denotes the projection map-
ping.
10.1.9
Lemma.
(The Embedding Lemma)
Let {(Yi, Ti) :
i ∈I} be a family of topological spaces and for each i ∈I, let fi
be a mapping of a topological space (X,τ) into (Yi,τi). Further let
e : (X,τ) −→

i∈I(Yi,τi) be the evaluation map; that is, e(x) =

i∈I fi(x), for all x ∈X. Then e is a homeomorphism of (X,τ) onto
the space (e(X),τ′), where τ′ is the subspace topology on e(X) if
(i) each fi is continuous.
(ii) the family {fi : i ∈I} separates points of X; that is, if x1 and x2
are in X with x1 ̸= x2, then for some i ∈I, fi(x1) ̸= f1(x2), and
(iii) the family {fi : i ∈I} separates points and closed sets; that is,
for x ∈A and A any closed subset of (X,τ) not containing x,
fi(x) /∈fi(A), for some i ∈I.
10.1.10
Corollary.
If (X,τ) in Lemma 10.1.9 is a T1-space, then
condition (ii) is superﬂuous.

10.1.11
Deﬁnitions.
Let (X,τ) and (Y, T ′) be topological spaces.
Then we say that (X,τ) can be embedded in (Y,τ′) if there exists
a continuous mapping f: (X,τ) −→(Y,τ′), such that f: (X, T ) −→
(f(X),τ′′) is a homeomorphism, where T ′′ is the subspace topology
on f(X) from (Y,τ′). The mapping f : (X,τ) −→(Y,τ′) is said to be
an embedding.

10.2
Zorn’s Lemma
Our next task is to prove the general TychonoﬀTheorem which says
that any product of compact spaces is compact. However, to do this
we need to use Zorn’s Lemma which requires a little preparation.
10.2.1
Deﬁnition.
A partial order on a set X is a binary relation,
denoted by ≤, which has the properties:
(i) x ≤x, for all x ∈X
(reﬂexive)
(ii) if x ≤y and y ≤x then x = y
(antisymmetric), and
(iii) if x ≤y and y ≤z then x ≤z
(transitive)
for x, y and z and X
The set X equipped with the partial order ≤is called a partially
ordered set and denoted by (X, ≤). IF x ≤y and x ̸= y we write x < y.
10.2.2
Examples.
The prototype of a partially ordered set is
the set N of all natural numbers equipped with the usual ordering of
natural numbers.
Similarly the sets Z, Q, and R with their usual orderings form
partially ordered sets.
10.2.3
Example.
Let N be the set of natural numbers and “ ≤′′
be deﬁned as follows:
n ≤m if n divides m
So 3 ≤6 but 3 ̸≤5. (It is left as an exercise to verify that with this
ordering N is a partially ordered set.)

194
Topology Without Tears
10.2.4
Example.
Let X be the class of all subsets of a set U. We
can deﬁne a partial ordering on X by putting
A ≤B if A is a subset of B
where A and B are in X.
It is easily veriﬁed that this is a partial order.
10.2.5
Example.
Let (X, ≤) be a partially ordered set. We can
deﬁne a new partial order ≤∗on X by deﬁning
x ≤∗y
if
y ≤x.
10.2.6
Example.
There is a convenient way of picturing partially
ordered sets – this is by an order diagram.
An element x is less than an element y if and only if one can go
from x to y by moving upwards on line segments. So in our order

Tychonoﬀ’s Theorem
195
diagram
a < b, a < g, a < h, a < i, a < j, b < g, b < h,
b < i, c < b, c < g, c < h, c < i, d < a, d < b,
d < g, d < h, d < 1, d < j, e < g, e < h, e < i,
f < g, f < h, g < h, g < i.
However d ̸≤c and c ̸≤d, e ̸≤f and f ̸≤e, etc.
10.2.7
Deﬁnition.
Two elements x and y of a partially ordered
set (X, ≤) are said to be comparable if either x ≤y or y ≤x.
10.2.8
Remark.
We saw in the order diagram above that the
elements d and c are not comparable. Also e and f are not comparable.
In N, Q, R, and Z with the usual orderings every two elements are
comparable.
In Example 10.2.4, 3 and 5 are not comparable.
10.2.9
Deﬁnition.
A partially ordered set (X, ≤) is said to be
linearly ordered if every two elements are comparable. The order ≤is
then said to a linear order.
10.2.10
Examples.
The usual orders on N, Q, R, and Z are linear
orders.
The partial order of Example 10.2.4 is not a linear order (if U has
at least two points).
10.2.11
Deﬁnition.
Let (X, ≤) be a partially ordered set. Then
an element s ∈X is said to be the greatest element of X if x ≤s, for
all x ∈X.
10.2.12
Deﬁnition.
Let (X, ≤) be a partially ordered set and Y
a subset of X. An element t ∈X is said to be an upper bound for y if
y ≤t, for all y ∈Y .
It is important to note that an upper bound for Y need not be in
Y .
10.2.13
Deﬁnition.
Let (X, ≤) be a partially ordered set. Then
an
element w ∈X is said to be maximal if w ≤x, with x ∈X, im-
plies w = x.

196
Topology Without Tears
10.2.14
Remark.
It is important to distinguish between maximal
elements and greatest elements. Consider the order diagram in Remark
10.2.6.
There is no greatest element!
However, j, h, and i are all
maximal elements.
10.2.15
Remark.
We can now state Zorn’s Lemma. Despite the
name “Lemma”, it is, in fact, an axiom and cannot be proved. It is
equivalent to various other axioms of Set Theory such as the Axiom
of Choice and the Well-Ordering Theorem. [See, for example, Paul
R. Halmos, “Naive Set Theory” (Van Nostrand Reinhold Co., 1960)
or R.L. Wilder, “Introduction to the Foundations of Mathematics”
(Wiley, 1952).] We shall take Zorn’s Lemma as one of the axioms of
our set theory and so use it whenever we wish.
10.2.16
Axiom.
(Zorn’s Lemma)
Let (X, ≤) be a non-empty
partially ordered set in which every subset which is linearly ordered
has an upper bound. Then (X, ≤) has a maximal element.
10.2.17
Example.
Let us apply Zorn’s Lemma to the lattice
diagram of Remark 10.2.6. There are many linearly ordered subsets:
{i, g, b, a}, {g, b, a}, {b, a}, {g, b}, {i, g}, {a}, {b},
{g}, {i}, {i, b, a}, {i, g, a}, {i.a}, {g, a}, {h, g, e},
{h, e}, {g, e}, etc.
Each of these has an upper bound −−i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, h, h, h,
etc.
Zorn’s Lemma then says that there is a maximal element. In fact
there are 3 maximal elements, j, h and i.

10.3 Tychonoﬀ’s Theorem
10.3.1
Deﬁnition.
Let X be a set and F a family of subsets of
X. Then F is said to have the ﬁnite intersection property if for any
ﬁnite number F1, F2, . . . , Fn of members of F, F1 ∩F2 ∩. . . ∩Fn ̸= Ø.
10.3.2
Proposition.
Let (X,τ) be a topological space.
Then
(X,τ) is compact if and only if every family F of closed subsets of X
with the ﬁnite intersection property satisﬁes

F∈F F ̸= Ø.
Proof.
Assume that every family F of closed subsets of X with
the ﬁnite intersection property satisﬁes

F∈F F ̸== Ø. Let U be any
open covering of X.
Put F equal to the family of complements of
members of U. So each F ∈F is closed in (X,τ). As U is an open
covering of X,

F∈F F = Ø. By our assumption, then, F does not
have the ﬁnite intersection property.
So for some F1, F2, . . . , Fn in
F, F1 ∩F2 ∩. . . ∩Fn = Ø.
Thus U1 ∪U2 ∪. . . ∪Un = X, where
Ui = X \ Fi, i = 1, . . . , n. So U has a ﬁnite subcovering. Hence (X,τ)
is compact.
The converse statement is proved similarly.
10.3.3
Lemma.
Let X be a set and F a family of subsets of X
with the ﬁnite intersection property. Then there is a maximal family of
subsets of X that contains F and has the ﬁnite intersection property.
Proof.
Let Z be the collection of all families of subsets of X which
contain F and have the ﬁnite intersection property. Deﬁne a partial
order ≤on Z as follows: if F1 and F2 are in Z then put F1 ≤F2
if F1 ⊆F2.
Let Y be any linearly ordered subset of Z. To apply
Zorn’s Lemma we need to verify that Y has an upper bound.
We
claim that

Y∈Y Y is an upper bound for Y . Clearly this contains F,

Tychonoﬀ’s Theorem
199
so we have to show only that it has the ﬁnite intersection property. So
let S1, S2, . . . , Sn ∈

Y∈Y Y. Then each Si ∈Yi, for some Yi ∈Y . As
Y is linearly ordered, one of the Yi contains all of the others. Thus
S1, S2, . . . , Sn all belong to that Yi. As Yi has the ﬁnite intersection
property, S1 ∩S2 ∩. . . ∩Sn = Ø. So

Y∈Y Y has the ﬁnite intersection
property and is, therefore, an upper bound in X of Y . So by Zorn’s
Lemma, Z has a maximal element.
We can now prove the much heralded TychonoﬀTheorem.
10.3.3
Theorem.
(Tychonoﬀ’s Theorem)
Let {(Xi,τi) :
i ∈I} be any family of topological spaces.
Then

i∈I(Xi,τi) is
compact if and only if each (Xi,τi) is compact.
Proof.
We shall use Proposition 10.3.2 to show that (X,τ) =

i∈I(Xi,τi) is compact, if each (Xi,τi) is compact.
Let F be any
family of closed subsets of X with the ﬁnite intersection property. We
have to prove that

F∈F F ̸= Ø.
By Lemma 10.3.3 there is a maximal family H of (not necessarily
closed) subsets of (X,τ) that contains J and has the ﬁnite intersection
property. We shall prove that

H∈H H ̸= Ø, from which follows the
required result

F∈F F ̸= Ø, since each F ∈F is closed.
Observe that as H is maximal, any subset of X which intersects
non-trivially every member of H is itself in H.
Fix i ∈I and let pi :

i∈I(Xi,τi) be the projection mapping.
Then the family {pi(H) : H ∈H} has the ﬁnite intersection property.
Therefore the family {pi(H) : H ∈H} has the ﬁnite intersection
property.
As (Xi, Ti) is compact,

H∈H pi(H) ̸= Ø.
So let xi ∈

H∈H pi(H). So for each i ∈I, we can ﬁnd a point xi ∈

H∈H pi(H).
Put x =

i∈I xi ∈X.
We shall prove that x ∈

h∈H H. Let O be any open set containing
x. Then O contains a basic open set about x of the form

i∈J p−1
i (Ui),
where Ui ∈τ, xi ∈Ui and J is a ﬁnite subset of I.
As xi ∈
pi(H), Ui ∩pi(H) ̸= Ø, for all H ∈H. Thus p−1
i (Ui) ∩H = Ø, for all
H ∈H. By the observation above, this implies that p−1
i (Ui) ∈H, for all
i ∈J. As H has the ﬁnite intersection property,

i∈J p−1
i (U1)∩H ̸= Ø,
for all H ∈H. So O ∩H ̸= Ø for all H ∈H. Hence x ∈

H∈H H, as
required.
Conversely, if

I∈I(Xi,τi) is compact, then by Proposition 10.1.5
(i) each (Xi,τi) is compact.

homeomorphic to a subspace of the cube IX.
Proof.
Without loss of generality, assume d(a, b) ≤1 for all a and
b in X. For each a ∈X, let fa be the continuous mapping of (X, d)
into [0, 1] given by
fa(x) = d(x, a).
That the family {fa : a ∈X} separates points and closed sets is easily
shown (cf. the proof of Theorem 9.27). Thus, by Corollary 10.1.10 of
the Embedding Lemma, (X, d) is homeomorphic to a subspace of the
cube IX.
10.3.7
Remark.
This leads us to ask: What topological spaces
are homeomorphic to subspaces of cubes? We now address this ques-
tion.
10.3.8
Deﬁnitions.
Let (X,τ) be a topological space.
Then
(X,τ) is said to be completely regular if for each x ∈X and each
open set U ∋x there exists a continuous function f: (X,τ) −→[0, 1]
such that f(x) = 0 and f(y) = 1 for all y ∈X \ U. If (X,τ) is also
Hausdorﬀ, then it is said to be Tychonoﬀspace (or a T3 1
2-space).
10.3.9
Proposition.
Let (X, d) be a metric space and τ the
topology induced on X by d. Then (X,τ) is a Tychonoﬀspace.
Proof.
Let a ∈X and U be any open set containing a. Then U
contains an open ball with centre a and radius ε, for some ε > 0.
Deﬁne f : (X, d) −→[0, 1] by
f(x) = min


1, d(x, a)

,
for x ∈X.
Then f is continuous and satisﬁes f(a) = 0 and f(y) = 1, for all
y ∈X \ U. As (X, d) is also Hausdorﬀ, it is a Tychonoﬀspace.

Tychonoﬀ’s Theorem
201
10.3.10
Corollary.
The space [0, 1] is a Tychonoﬀspace.
10.3.11 If {(Xi,τi) : i ∈I} is any family of completely regular
spaces, then

i∈I(Xi,τi) is completely regular
Proposition.
Proof.
Let a =

i∈I xi ∈

i∈I Xi and U be any open set containing
a. Then there exists a ﬁnite subset J of I and sets Ui ∈τi such that
a ∈

i∈I
Ui ⊆U
where Ui = Xi for all i ∈I \ J. As (Xj, Tj) is completely regular, for
each j ∈J there exists a continuous mapping fj : (Xj,τj) −→[0, 1]
such that fj(xj) = 0 and fj(y) = 1, for all y ∈Xj \ Uj.
Then
fj ◦pj:

i∈I(Xi,τi) −→[0, 1], where pj denotes the projection onto
the jth coordinate. Further, if we put f(x) = max{fj ◦pj(x): j ∈J},
we see that f :

i∈I(Xi,τi) −→[0, 1] is continuous (as J is ﬁnite).
Further, f(a) = 0 while f(y) = 1 for all y ∈X \ U. So

i∈I(Xi,τi) is
completely regular.
The next proposition is easily proved and so its proof is left as an
exercise.
10.3.12
Proposition.
If {(Xi,τi) : i ∈I} is any family of Haus-
dorﬀspaces, then

i∈I(Xi,τi) is Hausdoroﬀ.
10.3.13
Corollary.
If {(Xi,τi) : i ∈I} is any family of Tychonoﬀ
spaces, then

i∈I(Xi,τi) is a Tychonoﬀspace.
10.3.14
Corollary.
For any set X, the cube IX is a Tychonoﬀ
space.
The next proposition is also easily proved.
10.3.15
Proposition.
Every subspace of a completely regular
space is completely regular.
10.3.16
Corollary.
Every subspace of a Tychonoﬀspace is a
Tychonoﬀspace.

10.3.17
Proposition.
If (X,τ) is any Tychonoﬀspace then it is
homeomorphic to a subspace of a cube.
Proof.
Let F be the family of all continuous mappings f : (X,τ) −→
[0, 1]. Then if follows easily from Corollary 10.1.10 of the Embedding
Lemma and the deﬁnition of completely regular, that the evaluation
map e: (X,τ) →IF is an embedding.
Thus we now have a characterization of the subspaces of cubes.
Putting together Proposition 10.3.17 and Corollaries 10.3.14 and 10.3.16
we obtain:
10.3.18
Proposition.
A topological space (X,τ) can be embed-
ded in a cube if and only if it is a Tychonoﬀspace.
10.3.19
Remark.
We now proceed to show that the class of
Tychonoﬀspaces is quite large and, in particular, includes all compact
Hausdorﬀspaces.
10.3.20
Deﬁnitions.
A topological space (X,τ) is said to be a
normal space if for each pair of disjoint closed sets A and B, there
exist open sets U and V such that A ⊆U, B ⊆V and U ∩V = Ø. A
normal space which is also Hausdorﬀis said to be a T4-space.
10.3.21
Remark.
In Exercises 6.1 #9 it is noted that every
metrizable space is a normal space. A little later we shall verify that
every compact Hausdorﬀspace is normal. First we shall prove that
every normal Hausdorﬀspace is a Tychonoﬀspace (that is, every T4-
space is a T3 1
2-space).
10.3.22
Theorem.
(Urysohn’s Lemma)
Let (X,τ) be a topo-
logical space. Then (X,τ) is normal if and only if for each pair of dis-
joint closed sets A and B in (X, T ) there exists a continuous function
f: (X,τ) −→[0, 1] such that f(a) = 0 for all a ∈A, and f(b) = 1 for
all b ∈B.
Proof.
Assume that for each A and B and f with the property
stated above exists. Then U = f −1([0, 1
2)) and V = f −1((1
2, 1]) are
open in (X,τ) and satisfy A ⊆U, B ⊆V , and A ∩B = Ø. Hence
(X,τ) is normal.

Tychonoﬀ’s Theorem
203
Conversely, assume (X,τ) is normal. We shall construct a family
{Ui : i ∈D} of open subsets of X, where the set D is given by
D =
 k
2n : k = 1, 2, . . . , 2n, n = 1, 2, 3, . . .

.
So D is a set of dyadic rational numbers, such that A ⊆Ui, Ui∩B = Ø,
and d1 ≤d2 implies Ud1 ⊆Ud2.
As (X,τ) is normal, for any pair A, B of disjoint closed sets, there
exist disjoint open sets U 1
2 and V 1
2 such that A ⊆U 1
2 and B ⊆V 1
2. So
we have
A ⊆U 1
2 ⊆V C
1
2 ⊆BC
where the superscript C is used to denote complements in X (that is,
V C
1
2 = X \V 1
2 and BC = X \B). Now consider the disjoint closed sets A
and U C
1
2 . Again, by normality, there exist disjoint open sets U 1
4 and V 1
4
such that A ⊆U 1
4 and U C
1
2 ⊆V 1
4. Also as V C
1
2 and B are disjoint closed
sets there exists disjoint open sets U 3
4 and V 3
4 such that V C
1
2 ⊆U 3
4 and
B ⊆V 3
4. So we have
A ⊆U 1
4 ⊆V C
1
4 ⊆U 1
2 ⊆V C
1
2 ⊆U 3
4 ⊆V C
3
4 ⊆BC.
Continuing by induction we obtain open sets Ud and Vd, for each
d ∈D, such that
A ⊆U2−n ⊆V C
2−n ⊆U2.2−n ⊆V C
2.2−n ⊆. . . ⊆U(2n−1)2−n ⊆V C
(2n−1)2−n
⊆BC.
So we have, in particular, that for d1 ≤d2 in D, Ud1 ⊆Ud2.
Now we deﬁne f: (X,τ) −→[0, 1] by
f(x) =
 inf{d : x ∈Ud},
if x ∈

d∈D Ud
1,
if x /∈

d∈D Ud.
Observe ﬁnally that since A ⊆Ud, for all d ∈D, f(a) = 0 for all
a ∈A. Also if b ∈B, then b /∈

d∈D Ud and so f(b) = 1. So we have to
show only that f is continuous.
Let f(x) = y, where y ̸= 0, 1 and set W = (y −ε, y + ε), for some
ε > 0 (with 0 < y −ε < y + ε < 1). As D is dense in [0, 1], we can
choose d0 and d1 such that y −ε < d0 < y < d1 < y0 + ε. Then, by
the deﬁnition of f, x ∈U = Ud1 \ U d0 and the open set U satisﬁes

204
Topology Without Tears
f(u) ⊆W. If y = 1 then we put W = (y −ε, 1], choose d0 such that
y −ε < d0 < 1, and set U = X \ U d0. Again f(U) ⊆W. Finally, if
y = 0 then put W = [0, y + ε), choose d1 such that 0 < d1 < Y + ε and
set U = Ud1 to again obtain f(U) ⊆W. Hence f is continuous.
10.3.23
Corollary.
If (X,τ) is a Hausdorﬀnormal space then it is
a Tychonoﬀspace; that is, every T4-space is a T3 1
2-space. Consequently
it is homeomorphic to a subspace of a cube.
10.3.24
Proposition.
Every compact Hausdorﬀspace (X,τ) is
normal.
Proof.
Let A and B be disjoint closed subsets of (X,τ).
Fix
b ∈B.
Then, as (X,τ) is Hausdorﬀ, for each a ∈A, there exist
open sets Ua and Va such that a ∈Ua, b ∈Va and Ua ∩Va = Ø. So
{Ua : a ∈A} is an open covering of A. As A is compact, there exists
a ﬁnite subcovering Ua1, Ua2, . . . , Uan. Put Ub = Ua1 ∪Ua2 ∪. . . ∪Uan
and Vb = Va1 ∩Va2 ∩. . . Van.
Then we have A ⊆Ub, b ∈Vb, and
Ub ∩Vb = Ø. Now let b vary throughout B, so we obtain an open
covering {Vb : b ∈B} of B. As B is compact, there exists a ﬁnite
subcovering Vb1, Vb2, . . . , Vbm. Set V = Vb1 ∪Vb2 ∪. . . ∪Vbm and U =
Ub1 ∩Ub2 ∩. . . ∩Ubm. Then A ⊆U, B ⊆V , and U ∩V = Ø. Hence
(X,τ) is normal.
10.3.25
Corollary.
Every compact Hausdorﬀspace can be em-
bedded in a cube.
10.3.26
Remark.
We can now prove the Urysohn metrization
theorem which provides a suﬃcient condition for a topological space
to be metrizable. It also provides a necessary and suﬃcient condition
for a compact space to be metrizable – namely that it be Hausdorﬀ
and second countable.
10.3.27
Deﬁnition.
A topological space (X,τ) is said to be reg-
ular if for each x ∈X and each U ∈τ such that x ∈U, there exists a
V ∈τ with x ∈V ⊆U. If (X,τ) is also Hausdorﬀit is said to be a
T3–space.

Tychonoﬀ’s Theorem
205
10.3.28
Remark.
It is readily veriﬁed that every T3 1
2-space is a
T3-space.
So, from Corollary 10.3.23, every T4-space is a T3-space.
Indeed we now have a hierarchy:
compact space Hausdorﬀ⇒T4 ⇒T3 1
2 ⇒T3 ⇒T2 ⇒T1 ⇒T0
metrizable ⇒T4 ⇒T3 1
2 ⇒T3 ⇒T2 ⇒T1 ⇒T0
10.3.29
Proposition.
Every normal second countable Hausdorﬀ
space (X,τ) is metrizable.
Proof.
It suﬃces to show that (X,τ) can be embedded in the
Hilbert cube I∞. To verify this it is enough to ﬁnd a countable family
of continuous maps of (X,τ) into [0, 1] which separates points and
closed sets.
Let B be a countable basis for τ, and consider the set S of all pairs
(V, U) such that U ∈B, V ∈B and V ⊆U. Then S is countable. For
each pair (V, U) in S we can, by Urysohn’s Lemma, ﬁnd a continuous
mapping f: (X,τ) −→[0, 1] such that f(V ) = 0 and f(X \ U) = 1.
Put F equal to the family of functions, f, so obtained. Then it is
countable.
To see that F separates points and closed sets, let x ∈X and W
be any open set containing x. Then there exists a U ∈B such that
x ∈U ⊆W. By Remark 10.3.28, (X,τ) is regular and so there exists
a set P ∈τ such that x ∈P ⊆P ⊆U. Therefore these exists a V ∈B
with x ∈V ⊆P. So x ∈V ⊆P ⊆U. Then (V, U) ∈S and if f is the
corresponding mapping in F, then f(x) = 0 /∈{1} = f(X \ W).
10.3.30
Lemma.
Every regular second countable space (X,τ) is
normal.
Proof.
Let A and B be disjoint closed subsets of (X, T ) and B
a countable basis for τ. As (X,τ) is regular and X \ B is an open
set, foreach a ∈A there exists a Va ∈B such that V a ⊆X \ B. As
B is countable we can list the members {Va : a ∈A} so obtained
by V1, V2, . . . , Vn, . . .; that is, A ⊆
∞
i=1 Vi and V i ∩B = Ø, for all i.
Similarly we can ﬁnd sets U1, U2, . . . , Un, . . . in B such that B ⊆
∞
i=1 Ui
and Ui ∩A = Ø, for all i. Now deﬁne U ′
i = U1 \ V 1 and V ′
1 = V1 \ U 1.
So U ′
1 ∩V ′
1 = Ø, U ′
1 ∈τ, V ′
1 ∈τ, U ′
1 ∩B = U1 ∩B, and V ′
1 ∩A = V1 ∩A.
Then we inductively deﬁne
U′
n = Un \
n

i=1
V i
and
V ′
n = Vn \
n

i=1
U i

206
Topology Without Tears
So that U ′
n ∈τ, V ′
n ∈τ, U ′
n ∩B = Un ∩B, and V ′
n ∩A = An ∩A. Now
put U =
∞
n=1 U ′
n and V =
∞
n=1 V ′
n. Then U ∩V = Ø, U ∈τ, V ∈τ
and A ⊆V and B ⊆U. Hence (X,τ) is normal.
We can now deduce from Proposition 10.3.29. and Lemma 10.3.30
the Urysohn Metrization Theorem, which generalizes Proposition 10.3.29.
10.3.31
Theorem.
(Urysohn Metrization Theorem)
Ev-
ery regular second countable Hausdorﬀspace is metrizable.
From Urysohn’s Metrization Theorem, Proposition 9.20, and Propo-
sition 9.33, we deduce the following characterization of metrizability
for compact spaces.
10.3.32
Corollary.
A compact space is metrizable if and only if
it is Hausdorﬀand second countable.
10.3.33
Remark.
As mentioned in Remark 10.3.21, every metriz-
able space is normal. It then follows from Proposition 9.4.17 that every
separable metric space is normal, Hausdorﬀ, and second countable.
Thus Uryshohn’s Theorem 9.4.11, which says that every separable
metric space is homeomorphic to a subspace of the Hilbert cube, is
a consequence of (the proof of) Proposition 10.3.29.

10.4 Stone-˘Cech Compactiﬁcation
10.4.1
Deﬁnition.
Let (X,τ) be a topological space, (βX,τ′)
a compact Hausdorﬀspace and β: (X,τ) −→(βX,τ′) a continuous
mapping, then (βX,τ′) together with the mapping β is said to be the
Stone- ˘Cech compactiﬁcation of (X,τ) if for any compact Hausdorﬀ
space (Y,τ′′) and any continuous mapping φ : (X,τ) −→(Y,τ′′), there
exists a unique continuous mapping φ : (βX,τ′) −→(Y,τ′′) such that
Φ ◦β = φ; that is, the diagram below commutes:
WARNING.
The mapping β is usually not surjective, so β(X) is
usually not equal to βX.
10.4.2
Remark.
Those familiar with category theory should im-
mediately recognize that the existence of the Stone-˘Cech compactiﬁca-
tion follows from the Freyd adjoint functor theorem. [We are seeking
a left adjoint to the forgetful functor from the category of compact
Hausdorﬀspaces and continuous functions to the category of topo-
logical spaces and continuous functions.] For a discussion of this see

210
Topology Without Tears
S. Maclane, “Categories for the working mathematician” (Graduate
Texts in Mathematics 5, Springer-Verlag, 1971.)
While the Stone-˘Cech compactiﬁcation exists for all topological
spaces, it assumes more signiﬁcance in the case of Tychonoﬀspaces.
For the mapping β is an embedding if and only if the space (X,τ)
is Tychonoﬀ. The “only if” part of this is clear, since the compact
Hausdorﬀspace (βX,τ′) is a Tychonoﬀspace and so, therefore, is any
subspace of it.
We now address the task of proving the existence of the Stone-
˘Cech compactiﬁcation for Tychonoﬀspaces and of showing that the
map β is an embedding in this case.
10.4.3
Lemma.
Let (X,τ) and (Y,τ′) be Tychonoﬀspaces and
F(X) and F(Y ) the family of all continuous mappings of X and
Y into [0, 1], respectively. Further let eX and eY be the evaluation
maps of X into

f∈F(X) If and Y into

g∈F(Y ) Ig, respectively, where
If ∼= Ig ∼= [0, 1], for each f and g. If φ is any continuous mapping
of X into Y , there exists a continuous mapping Φ of

f∈F(X) If into

g∈F(Y ) Ig such that Φ ◦eX = eY ◦Φ; that is, the diagram below
commutes.
Further, Φ(eX(X)) ⊆eY (Y ).
Proof.
Let

f∈F(X) xf ∈

f∈F(X) If. Deﬁne
Φ


g∈F(Y )
yg,
where yg is deﬁned as follows: as g ∈F(Y ), g is continuous map from
(Y,τ′) into [0, 1]. So g ◦φ is a continuous map from (X,τ) into [0, 1].

Tychonoﬀ’s Theorem
211
Thus g ◦φ = f, for some f ∈F(X). Then put yg = xf, for this f, and
the mapping Φ is now deﬁned.
To prove continuity of Φ, let U =

g∈F(Z) Ug be a basic open
set containing Φ(

f∈F(X) xf) =

g∈F(Y ) yg.
Then Ug = Ig for all
g ∈F(Y ) \ {gi1, . . . , gin}, for some gi1, . . . , gin. Put fi1 = gi1 ◦φ,
fi2 = gi2◦, . . . , fin = gin ◦φ.
Now deﬁne V
=

f∈F(X) Vf, where
Vf = If, for some f ∈F(X) \ {fi1, fi2, . . . , fin}, and Vfi1 = Ugi1, Vf12 =
Ugi2, . . . , Vfin = Ugin. Clearly

f∈F(X) xf ∈V and Φ(V ) ⊆U. So Φ is
continuous.
To see that the diagram commutes, observe that
Φ(eX(x)) = Φ




f∈F(X)
f(x)


=

g∈F(Y )
g(φ(x)),
for all x ∈X. So Φ ◦eX = eY ◦φ.
Finally as Φ is continuous, Φ(ex(X)) ⊆eY (Y ), as required.
10.4.4

Let φ1 and φ2 be continuous mappings of a topo-
logical space (X,τ) into the Hausdorﬀspace (Y, T ′). If Z is a dense
subset of (X,τ) and Φ1(z) = Φ2(z) for all z ∈Z, then Φ1 = Φ2 on X.
Proof.
Suppose Φ1(x) ̸= Φ2(x), for some x ∈X. Then as (Y,τ′)
is Hausdorﬀ, there exist open sets U ∋Φ1(x) and V ∋Φ2(x), with
U ∩V = Ø. Then Φ−1
1 (U) ∩Φ−1
2 (V ) is an open set containing x. As Z
is dense in (X,τ), there exists a z ∈Z such that z ∈Φ−1
1 (U)∩Φ−1
2 (V ).
So Φ1(z) ∈U and Φ2(z) ∈V . But Φ1(z) = Φ2(z). So U ∩V ̸= Ø,
which is a contradiction. So Φ1(x) = Φ2(x), for all x ∈X.
10.4.5
Proposition.
Let (X,τ) be any Tychonoﬀspace, F(X)
the family of continuous mappings of (X,τ) into [0, 1], and eX the
evaluation map of (X,τ) into

f∈F(X) If, where each If ∼= [0, 1]. If
we put (βX, T ′) equal to eX(X) with the subspace topology and β :
(X,τ) −→(βX,τ′) equal to the mapping eX, then (βX,τ′) together
with the mapping β is the Stone- ˘Cech compactiﬁcation of (X,τ).
Proof.
Firstly observe that (βX,τ′) is indeed a compact Hausdorﬀ
space. Let φ be any continuous mapping of (X,τ) into any compact
Hausdorﬀspace (Y,τ′′).
Let F(Y ) be the family of all continuous
mappings of (Y, T ′′) into [0, 1] and eY the evaluation mapping of (Y,τ′′)
into

g∈F(Y ) Ig, where each Ig ∼= [0, 1]. By Lemma 10.4.3, there exists

a continuous mapping Γ :

f∈F(X) If −→

g∈F(Y ) Ig, such that eY ◦φ =
Γ ◦eX, and Γ(eX(X)) ⊆eY (Y ); that is, Γ(βX) ⊆eY (Y ). As (Y,τ′′) is
a compact Hausdorﬀspace and eY is one-to-one, we see that eY (Y ) =
eY (Y ) and eY : (Y,τ′′) −→(eY (Y ), T ′′′) is a homeomorphism, where τ′′′
is the subspace topology on eY (Y ). So e−1
Y : (eY (Y ),τ′′′) −→(Y, T ′′) is
a homeomorphism. Put Φ = e−1
Y ◦Γ so that Φ is a continuous mapping
of (βX,τ′) into (Y, T ′′). Further,
Φ(β(x)) = Φ(eX(x),
for any x ∈X
= e−1
Y (Γ(eX(x)))
= e−1
Y (eY (φ(x))),
as eY ◦φ = Γ ◦eX
= φ(x).
Thus Φ ◦β = φ, as required.
Now suppose there exist two continuous mappings Φ1 and Φ2 of
(βX,τ′) into (Y,τ′′) with Φ1 ◦β = φ and Φ2 ◦β = φ . Then Φ1 = Φ2
on the dense subset β(X) of (βX,τ′). So by Lemma 10.4.4, Φ1 = Φ2.
So the mapping Φ is unique.
10.4.6
Remark.
In Deﬁnition 10.4.1 we have referred to the
Stone-˘Cech compactiﬁcation implying that for each (X,τ) there is
a unique (βX,τ′). The next proposition indicates in precisely what
sense this is true. However we ﬁrst need a lemma.
10.4.7
Lemma.
Let (X,τ) be a topological space and let (Z,τ1)
together with a mapping β: (X, T1) −→(Z,τ1) be a Stone- ˘Cech com-
pactiﬁcation of (X,τ). Then β(X) is dense in (Z,τ1).
Proof.
Suppose β(X) is not dense in (Z,τ1). Then there exists an
element z ∈Z \ β(X). As (Z,τ1) is a compact Hausdorﬀspace it is a
Tychonoﬀspace. Observing that Z \β(X) is an open set containing z,
we deduce that there exists a continuous mapping Φ1: (Z,τ1) −→[0, 1]
with Φ1(z) = 1 and Φ1β(X)) = 0.
Also there exists a continuous
mapping Φ2: (Z,τ1) −→(0, 1
2] with Φ2(z) = 1
2 and Φ2(β(X)) = 0. So
we have the following diagrams which commute

Tychonoﬀ’s Theorem
213
where φ(x) = 0, for all x ∈X. This contradicts the uniqueness of the
mapping Φ in Deﬁnition 10.4.1. Hence β(X) is dense in (Z,τ1).
10.4.8
Proposition.
Let (X,τ) be a topological space and (Z1,τ1)
together with a mapping β1: (X,τ) −→(Z1,τ1) a Stone- ˘Cech compact-
iﬁcation of (X,τ). If (Z2,τ2) together with a mapping β2: (X,τ) −→
(Z2,τ2) is also a Stone- ˘Cech compactiﬁcation of (X,τ) then (Z1,τ1) ∼=
(Z2,τ2). Indeed, there exists a homeomorphism Θ: (Z1,τ1) →(Z2,τ2)
such that Θ ◦β1 = β2.
Proof.
As (Z1,τ1) together with β1 is a Stone-˘Cech compactiﬁ-
cation of (X,τ) and β2 is a continuous mapping of (X,τ) into the
compact Hausdorﬀspace (Z2,τ2), there exists a continuous mapping
Θ: (Z1,τ1) −→(Z2,τ2), such that Θ ◦β1 = β2. Similarly there exists a
continuous map Θ1: (Z2,τ2) −→(Z1,τ1) such that Θ1 ◦β2 = β1. So for
each x ∈X, Θ1(Θ(β1(x))) = Θ1(β2(X)) = β1(x); that is, if idZ1 is the
identity mapping on (Z1,τ1) then Θ1 ◦Θ = idZ1 on β1(X), which by
Lemma 10.4.7 is dense in (Z1,τ1). So, by Lemma 10.4.4, Θ1 ◦Θ = idZ1
on Z1.
Similarly Θ ◦Θ1 = idZ2 on Z2. Hence Θ = Θ−1
1
and as both are
continuous this means that Θ is a homeomorphism.

10.4.9
Remark.
Note that if (X,τ) is any Tychonoﬀspace and
(βX,τ′) together with β: (X,τ) →(βX,τ′) is its Stone-˘Cech com-
pactiﬁcation then the proof of Proposition 10.4.5 shows that β is an
embedding. Indeed it is usual, in this case, to identify X with βX,
and so regard (X,τ) as a subspace of (βX,τ′).
We, then, do not
mention the embedding β and talk about (βX,τ′) as the Stone-˘Cech
compactiﬁcation.
10.4.10
Remark.
If (X,τ) is any compact Hausdorﬀspace then
the Stone-˘Cech compactiﬁcation of (X,τ) is (X,τ) itself. Obviously
(X,τ) together with the identity mapping into itself has the required
property of a Stone-˘Cech compactiﬁcation. By uniqueness, it is the
Stone-˘Cech compactiﬁcation. This could also be seen from the proof of
Proposition 10.4.5 where we saw that for the compact Hausdorﬀspace
(Y,τ′′) the mapping eY : (Y,τ′′) −→(eY (Y ),τ′′′) is a homeomorphism.
10.4.11
Remark.
Stone-˘Cech compactiﬁcations of even quite nice
spaces are usually complicated. For example [0, 1] is not the Stone-
˘Cech compactiﬁcation of (0, 1], since the continuous mapping φ: (0, 1] −→
[−1, 1] given by φ(x) = sin(1
x) does not extend to a continuous map
Φ: [0, 1] −→[−1, 1]. Indeed it can be shown that the Stone-˘Cech com-
pactiﬁcation of (0, 1] is not metrizable.
Exercises 10.4
1. Let (X,τ) by a Tychonoﬀspace and (βX,τ′) its Stone-˘Cech com-
pactiﬁcation. Prove that (X, T ) is connected if and only if (βX,τ′)
is connected.
[Hint: Firstly verify that providing (X,τ) has at least 2 points it
is connected if and only if there does not exist a continuous map
of (X,τ) onto the discrete space {0, 1}.]
3.
Let (X,τ) be a Tychonoﬀspace and (βX,τ′) its Stone-˘Cech
compactiﬁcation. If (A,τ) is a subspace of (βX,τ′) and A ⊇X,
prove that (βX,τ′) is also the Stone-˘Cech compactiﬁcation of
(A,τ1).
[Hint: Verify that every continuous mapping of (X,τ) into [0, 1]
can be extended to a continuous mapping of (A,τ1) into [0, 1].
Then use the construction of (βX,τ′).]

Tychonoﬀ’s Theorem
215
3. Let (X,τ) be a dense subspace of a compact Hausdorﬀspace
(Z,τ1). If every continuous mapping of (X,τ) into [0, 1] can be
extended to a continuous mapping of (Z,τ1) into [0, 1], prove that
(Z,τ1) is the Stone-˘Cech compactiﬁcation of (X,τ).
10.5
Postscript
At long last we deﬁned the product of an arbitrary number of topo-
logical spaces and proved the general TychonoﬀTheorem. We also
extended the Embedding Lemma to the general case. This we used to
characterize the Tychonoﬀspaces as those which are homeomorphic
to a subspace of a cube (that is, a product of copies of [0, 1]).
Urysohn’s Lemma allowed us to obtain the following relations
between the the separation properties:
T4 ⇒T3 1
2 ⇒T3 ⇒T2 ⇒T1 ⇒T0.
Further, both compact Hausdorﬀand metrizable imply T4.
We have also seen a serious metrization theorem – namely Urysohn’s
Metrization Theorem, which says that every regular second countable
Hausdorﬀspace is metrizable.
