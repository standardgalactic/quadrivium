Reliability 
•  Classical test theory 
– Raw scores (X) are not perfect   
– They are influenced by bias and chance error 
•  For example, measurement of body temperature  
5 
Reliability 
•  Classical test theory 
– In a perfect world, it would be possible to 
obtain a “true score” rather than a “raw 
score” (X) 
•  X = true score + bias + error 
•  This is also known as “true score theory” 
6 
Reliability 
•  A measure (X) is considered to be reliable 
as it approaches the true score   
– The problem is we don’t know the true score   
– So, we estimate reliability 
7 
Reliability 
•  Methods to estimate reliability 
– Test / re-test 
– Parallel tests 
– Inter-item estimates

Reliability 
•  Example: Body temperature 
– Orally 
– Internally 
– Infrared thermometer: “The wand”

Body temperature

Body temperature F°  
11 
Body temperature C°

Body temperature F°: Biased

Body temperature C°: Biased 
14 
Reliability 
•  Test / re-test 
– Measure everyone twice 
•  X1 
•  X2 
15 
Reliability 
•  Test / re-test 
– The correlation between X1 and X2 is an 
estimate of reliability 
•  However, if the bias is uniform then we won’t detect 
it with the test / re-test method 
16

Reliability 
•  Parallel tests 
– Measure body temperature with the wand 
(X1) and with an oral thermometer (X2)   
– The correlation between X1 and X2 is an 
estimate of reliability 
•  AND, now the bias of the wand will be revealed 
17 
Reliability 
•  Inter-item 
– Inter-item is the most commonly used method 
in the social sciences 
•  Test / re-test and parallel tests are time consuming 
•  Inter-item is therefore more cost efficient 
18 
Reliability 
•  Inter-item 
– For example, suppose a 20-item survey is 
designed to measure extraversion 
•  Randomly select 10 items to get sub-set A (X1) 
•  The other 10 items become sub-set B (X2) 
•  The correlation between X1 and X2 is an estimate 
of reliability

Validity 
22 
Validity 
•  What is a construct? 
– How to operationalize a construct 
– Construct validity 
•  Content validity 
•  Convergent validity 
•  Divergent validity 
•  Nomological validity 
23 
Validity 
•  What is a construct? 
– An ideal “object” that is not directly observable  
•  As opposed to “real” observable objects 
•  For example, “intelligence” is a construct 
24 

10/12/13

Validity 
•  How do we operationalize a construct? 
– The process of defining a construct to make it 
observable and quantifiable 
•  For example, intelligence tests 
25 
Validity 
•  Construct validity 
– Content validity 
– Convergent validity 
– Divergent validity 
– Nomological validity 
26 
Validity 
•  An example:  
– Construct: Verbal ability in children 
27 
Validity 
•  How to operationalize? 
– A vocabulary test 
28

Validity 
•  Construct validity 
– Content validity 
•  Does the test consist of words that children in the 
population and sample should know? 
29 
Validity 
•  Construct validity 
– Convergent validity 
•  Does the test correlate with other, established 
measures of verbal ability? 
–  For example, reading comprehension 
30 
Validity 
•  Construct validity 
– Divergent validity 
•  Does the test correlate less well with measures 
designed to test a different type of ability? 
–  For example, spatial ability  
31 
Validity 
•  Construct validity 
– Nomological validity 
•  Are scores on the test consistent with more general 
theories, for example, of child development and 
neuroscience 
–  For example, a child with neural damage or disease to 
brain regions associated with language development 
should score lower on the test

Sampling 
•  Random and representative 
•  Recall the color wheel from Lecture 1

Not random

Sampling error 
•  Sampling error: The difference between 
the population and the sample  
– Notice that even the “random” histogram is 
not “perfectly” random 
– There is some fluctuation due to sampling 
error 
41 
Sampling error 
•  PROBLEM! 
– We typically don’t know the population 
parameters  
–  So, how do we estimate sampling error? 
42 
Sampling error 
•  Sampling error mainly depends on the size of 
the sample, relative to the size of the 
population 
–  As sample size increases, sampling error 
decreases 
•  It also depends on the variance in the 
population

Sampling error 
•  Assume 6 samples from a normal 
population 
•  N = 10 
•  N = 20 
•  N = 50 
•  N = 100 
•  N = 200 
•  N = 1000

Sampling error 
46 
Sampling error 
•  Sampling error is estimated from the size 
of the sample and the variance in the 
sample  
– Under the assumption that the sample is 
random and representative of the population 
47 
Standard error 
•  Standard error is an estimate of amount of 
sampling error 
•  SE = SD / SQRT(N) 
•  SE: Standard error 
•  SD: Standard deviation of the sample 
•  N: Size of the sample
