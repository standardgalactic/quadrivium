Preface
This book encompasses applied (epoxy) coating chemistry, formulation, and properties. Additional technological
platforms, such as phenolics and microencapsulation, are included in compliance with a broader scope of appli-
cable thermosetting systems surrounding epoxies. As the author herein aims to offer refreshing insights from his
experiences as a hands-on formulation scientist and engineer for over 20 years in the coatings industry, in-depth
discussions are incorporated throughout the context, combining advanced fundamentals with related coating for-
mulations suited for a range of intended industrial applications.
The entire narrative throughout this book is divided into parts and chapters that, in general, are self-contained
and coherently organized using theoretical concepts and practical topics, both crucial to understanding and fab-
ricating epoxy coatings, adhesives, and laminates, among other product formats. The contents presented in this
monograph, including modules of in-depth debriefs and recaps in the middle or at the end of each chapter, are
data-driven and exclusive in one way or the other, rejecting a similar or duplicate impression and committed
to a problem-solving paradigm by sharing the most up-to-date overview of epoxy-related science and technol-
ogy advancements, as the readers, particularly formulators dealing with epoxy and other chemistries, will notice.
Readers are exposed to a series of real-world illustrations that explicitly apply chemical principles to formulating
pragmatism (for example, crosslinker-free epoxy formulations, low-temperature cure for high-temperature ser-
vice, and super high dual Tgs); readers are given access to an effective DSC (differential scanning calorimetry)
exothermic analysis method for obtaining numerical approximations of kinetic parameters as disclosed in privi-
lege; and readers would learn that a physical steric effect rather than chemical crosslinking of fluorene epoxies
sometimes plays a crucial role in achieving super-elevated glass transition temperatures up to 250 ∘C. These are
but a few exhibitions of value propositions that may both encourage and call for ingenious thoughts to develop.
Additionally, these are also a few instances of insights that are probably hard to come across elsewhere. Regard-
less of technical proficiency, there are a wealth of fresh concepts and findings related to coatings chemistry and
formulation that will keep professional readers interested and motivated.
The author and this manuscript are committed to remaining impartial, positively providing discretionary view-
points, and assisting some readers in their professional interests and efforts to develop innovation-oriented epoxy
coatings and beyond to more effectively address emerging and advanced challenges in the future. Enjoy and thank
you for reading!

Introduction
As an introductory statement, science and technology, which are the primary drivers behind productive forces,
continue to advance human society and economy, including particularly industrial civilization, by constantly
improving existing products and creating new materials, such as in the realm of polymer coatings and adhe-
sives, among others, that have come to become essential to every aspect of life on Earth, in space, and underwater.
On the one hand, individuals, scientists, and engineers included, are persistently dedicated to learning, mastering,
improving, and surpassing generation by generation so that technology implementation is more competent and
confident when tackling current and emerging challenges. On the other hand, scientific and technological com-
munities, the polymer coatings sector included, spare no effort to produce data as proof to understand truths, call
for better and more affordable formulation solutions, and advocate for ecologically responsible thinking, among
many other encouraging and beneficial initiatives.
Within the scope of this work, and without restriction to theory, applied coating products and the like rely pri-
marily on five chemistry platforms of epoxy, polyurethane (PUR), polyester (including alkyds), acrylic/acrylate,
and silicone, as outlined in Table 1. Particularly, epoxies are superior to or at least competitive with others,
tailor-offering all-around adhesion, toughness, flexibility, dielectric, chemical, and thermal resistance but not UV
(ultraviolet) resistance, thus unsuitable for direct exterior end uses. Instead, polyurethanes (PURs) resist UV light,
so do polyesters, acrylics, and silicones. PURs, flexible and durable PUR elastomers as well as environmentally
compatible PUDs (i.e., PUR dispersions) included, perform competitively well in abrasion, wear, and chemical
resistance, while acrylics are capable of flash cure in seconds upon UV radiation or free radical initiation. In
general, PURs have advantages over acrylics in terms of higher and more sustainable elasticity across a range of
temperatures, for instance, from −20 to 6 ∘C. A schematic composed vertically of an epoxy basecoat and a PUR
topcoat is durable with respect to bonding strength (associated with both adhesion and cohesion) and weather-
ability; a stacking structure reinforced with an additional zinc primer applied underneath is considered the most
robust possible for utmost corrosion protection [1]. Advantageous and disadvantageous attributes of polyesters
and acrylics are reviewed in Chapter 9. Comparatively, silicones are poor in mechanical and anti-fouling
properties, but they afford elastomeric qualities imparting unparalleled flexibility and heat resistance, although
their glass transition temperatures (Tgs) are nearly –40 ∘C or below, greatly suited for wide-ranging applications
from electrical and electronics, automotive, aerospace, medical, and construction industries.
For the global epoxy resin market, it was valued at USD 8.9 billion in 2020, corresponding to over 2.0 million
metric tons in volume, and is projected to grow up to USD 16.6 billion by 2030 [2]. As of 2023, Kukdo Chemical and
Olin Corporation represent the two largest epoxy resin suppliers in the world, having an annual capacity of 630,000
and 610,000 tons, respectively, followed by a dozen tier manufacturers in Asia (e.g., Japan, Thailand, etc.), Europe,
and the Americas. By form, epoxy resins are classified into liquid and solid, including, by type, DGEBA, DGEBF,
novolac, aliphatic, GAER (i.e., glycidylamine), specialties, and others. Epoxies are also classified into building
and construction, transportation, general industrial, consumer goods, wind energy, aerospace, and marine, by

end use, including paints and coatings, adhesives and sealants, composites (non-reinforced and reinforced), elec-
tronic encapsulation, and others, by application, as re-grouped and charted in Figure 1 according to research data
as of 2021 [3], where the segment of electrical and electronics accounted for approximately 36% of total volumes,
the largest. Notably, the general industrial sector, of protective and decorative functions, consists mainly of trans-
portation, ACE (i.e., agricultural, construction, and earth moving) heavy machinery, protective coatings (e.g., oil
and gas pipelines), industrial finishes, consumer finishes (e.g., white compliance), and containers.
Moreover, epoxies are relatively cheap, easy to apply, and less labor-intensive. Currently, the automotive indus-
try adopts lightweight composite materials to meet the demand for increased design freedom, flexibility, high
strength, and reduced vehicle weight. The aerospace industry has been increasingly demanding light-weighted,
tough, high-heat, and pressure-tolerant epoxy resins for the assembly of, for example, aircraft panels and heli-
copter rotor blades. The wind energy industry utilizes epoxy thermosets of high creep resistance and high tensile
strength to make wind farm blades more durable; toughened epoxies have shown positive results toward making
the blades corrosion resistant and fatigue proof. The solar energy industry also employs epoxy resins for protection
of the solar panels from daily and seasonal variations in temperature. All these uptrends of cost reduction and per-
formance increase are expected to propel the growth of the epoxy resin market globally. However, the fluctuations
in the cost of raw materials affect the production cost of epoxy resins, which can impact the dynamic stock and
incremental market sizes during the forecast period to 2031.
For these reasons, epoxy coatings are chosen as priorities and focuses across parts and chapters of this mono-
graph, specifically (e.g., Parts I through III and Chapters 1 through 6) and broadly (e.g., Parts II, IV, V, and

Introduction

Chapters 7 through 10). Obviously, epoxy thermosets, typical of covalently crosslinked networks, are one of the
most versatile and enabling materials technologies for a vast variety of industrial applications, demonstrating
superior physical, chemical, electrical, and thermal performance for encapsulation and surface coatings on single
substrates (C1S), for prepregs, structural laminates, and adhesives on dual substrates (C2S, similar and dissimi-
lar materials like metals, glass, and plastics), for injection molding, and for 3D printing (i.e., additive printing or
manufacturing) on no underlying substrate (i.e., self-contained), among others. Considering structure-property
relationships that are core to establishing an organic correlation of chemistry and formulation to applications,
initial resins and curing agents or curatives (including crosslinkers or hardeners and catalysts), incumbent chem-
ical crosslinking, supporting physical entanglement of polymeric chains, and bulk cured matrixes or networks all
contribute to the final structures that describe cohesive performance such as Tg, modulus, toughness, flexibility,
impermeability, polarity, porosity, and so on, and ultimately determining mechanical, chemical, thermal, and elec-
trical properties (refer to Table 1), depending on layouts of original formulations and consequent cure schedules.
Considering rheo-kinetics that is key to understanding epoxy chemistry and formulation reversely (or in hind-
sight), cure pathways define gelation, the extent (or degree) of cure, that is, 𝛼(T, t) in %, as a function of temperature
(T in ∘K, ∘C, or ∘F) and time (t in sec, min, or hour) combined that governs overall crosslinking and ultimately
cured film properties; furthermore, the T/t- and 𝛼-dependent or dynamic rheological behaviors influence adhe-
sion to substrates, processing, sagging, edge coverage, and appearance, which are relevant to minimal viscosity
(𝜂*min), time to gelation, initial viscosity, leveling, wet-out, and so on, as thoroughly revealed in Chapter 5.
Macroscopically and commercially, performance, manufacturability, and affordability are three key parameter
indicators (KPIs) or driving forces for the successful launch and operation of applied coating products and the
like. In a microscopic sense and at a stage of development, reactive polymer coatings, such as epoxies, have four
intrinsic attributes, including chemistry, processing, structure, and performance. These characteristics are essen-
tially governed by and attributed to formulation recipes, which in turn drive curing behaviors that, in the end,
define the molecular structure of the crosslinked networks. Applied cure kinetics and contingent reactive rheol-
ogy are utilized to qualify and quantify curing or crosslinking behaviors with complete DSC and DMA (dynamic
mechanical analysis) data chains and algorithms in Chapter 5. A comprehensive discussion of phenolic coat-
ings is provided in Chapter 7, including BOX (i.e., benzoxazine) and BMI (bismaleimide) with first-hand data,
so is one of microcapsules per 1K in-situ and 2K interfacial polymerizations at commercial scales in Chapter 8.
Non-epoxy platforms such as PUR, acrylic, polyester, silicone, and hybrids are captured in Chapter 9. Adhesion is
thoroughly discussed in Chapter 10, based on both conceptual and pragmatic value propositions. Exclusively cov-
ered in part of Chapter 6 are boundary or extreme formulations, including crosslinker-free (the formulation index
or FI = infinity) and dual cure (anionic and cationic co-catalyzation) LAT (low application temperature) systems,
including ultra-LAT FBEs (fusion bonded epoxies). In Chapters 6 through 9, allied formulations of originality and
unique compositions are presented, demonstrating extraordinary structural performance in Tg, flexibility, tough-
ness, adhesion, and combinations thereof. For instance, homogeneous phthalonitrile (PN) self-crosslinking at a
temperature below 225 ∘C produces a Tg of 345 ∘C without introducing the risk of vitrification that is typical of het-
erogeneous systems, including compounded epoxies, and BOX-PN systems exhibit dual Tgs of 245 ∘C and 316 ∘C,
to mention a few.
In a further aspect, there are a number of excellent books and textbooks on polymer, organic, and surface coat-
ings that offer generic ideas and insights in one way or another [4–8]; however, it is difficult to find one specifically
dedicated to epoxy coatings and formulations that presents concepts, performance, and applications integrally
from specific formulation case studies. When discussing epoxies and their chemistry and technology, for instance,
nearly all references focus only on the co-polymerization of epoxy-amine reactions, inadvertently overlooking
epoxy homo-polymerization, which is equally and profoundly important in determining the structural perfor-
mance of the finished products. A piece of insight like this, among many others relating to epoxies, is quite difficult
to properly understand or pay attention to without years of practical experience, let alone leverage it to propose and
carry out high-performing formulations to address real-world challenges. As a result, the exquisiteness left behind

Introduction
is profoundly lost or missed, and it is challenging for a college student or even a professional formulator to capture
and implement in practice. This book will close those by providing an independent, comprehensive, and easily
understandable reference source for students, chemists, scientists, and engineers from a variety of fields (including
polymer, coatings, chemistry, materials, and chemical engineering) and industries (chemical, electronics, CASEs.,
among others).
In a still further aspect, this book is structurally separated into five consecutive parts of ten chapters total.
Independent discussions and presentations throughout the chapters regularly center around structure-property
relationships, that is, intentionally focusing on a particular chemistry, formulation, and testing findings for spe-
cific performance metrics and applications that readers can readily refer to. A typical trial-and-error approach
followed by deductive reasoning toward a scientific topic is also closely followed, which can be rephrased as: (i)
observations and collection of data, (ii) establishment of models (and theories) and application of mathematics,
(iii) verification or denial of hypotheses, and (iv) rational prediction and re-observations as guidance for future
work. This method adheres to a straightforward concept of significances in two aspects: (v) continuous advances
from good to better to best (i.e., like quantitative accumulation from one to ten to the hundred), and (vi) occa-
sional innovations from nothing to capability (i.e., like a qualitative leap from null to existence). To transform from
a follower who learns and understands concepts and theories to a leader who improves and innovates processes
and products, it unquestionably takes more than technical passion, clever ideas (or, alternatively, saying “smart
thinking”), and paying attention to detail. In a word, it coincides with a doctrine of “hold on to scriptures and
reach changes” (or “持经达变” per an ancient Chinese wisdom from I Ching or “易经”) that one must follow
through studying and mastering fundamentals before he or she may lead through putting their creativity to use in
problem-solving inventions.

Epoxy Resins, Monomers, and Derivatives
Applied epoxy coatings and adhesives are those that are specifically formulated with epoxy resins, monomers,
and derivatives as the primary ingredient, along with crosslinkers or hardeners, catalysts and/or accelerators, and
accessory components such as fillers, pigments, extenders, and additives (reactive and non-reactive). Typically,
epoxies are referred to as glycidyl ethers, oxiranes, or 3-membered-ring epoxides that are identified by Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) fingerprint signals at 1,255, 1,139, 915, and 750–780 cm−1 [1, 2]. Extreme
epoxy systems, such as crosslinker-free formulations, have also been developed and will be described in Chapter 6.
This chapter reviews the various epoxy materials, with a particular emphasis on their functional structures, molec-
ular weights (MWs), epoxy equivalent weights (abbreviated as EEWs), functionality, and other attributes (such as
hydrophobicity). These resources consist of monomers such as fluorene-based specialties, oligomers, resins, pre-
polymers, derivatives like vinyl esters, toughening and flexibilizing modifications, oxetane analogs, BPA-free, and
bio-based, both bi- and multi-functional, as the essential constituents for diverse epoxy formulations.
1.1
BPA-Based Epoxies (or DGEBAs)
Depending on the desired performance and uses, formulators can choose from a huge variety of epoxy resin grades
or types that are commercially available. Table 1.1 represents an initial and generic classification in this regard.
The most widely used epoxy resins are unquestionably aromatic, and more specifically, BPA-based epoxies, that is,
based on bisphenol-A (where “A” stands for acetone, MW 228.3, Tm 158 ∘C, and pKa ≈10.29), also known as DGE-
BAs (short for di-glycidyl ethers of bisphenol-A), as structurally shown in Figure 1.1. Aliphatic epoxies are covered
separately. When discussing epoxy resins, systems, and applications generally, one can hardly avoid bringing them
up at some point because these BPA-based epoxies and derivatives have become so pervasive in both industries
and academics. BPA-based epoxies, or DGEBAs, are linearly ether-linked, strictly para-structured, structurally
symmetric, and bi-functional in terms of epoxides. All these characteristics intrinsically impart flexibility. In addi-
tion, DGEBAs contain in each of their repeating units one aliphatic secondary hydroxyl group (secondary OH;
refer to the chemical structure in Figure 1.1) that, under certain conditions, is not only readily reactive, that is,
providing additional means for modification and/or crosslinking with, for example, isocyanates or melamine, but
also alternately forms H bonds to improve adhesion (to substrates) and cohesion (within the coating films).
It is always referred to as the BPA-based grades or DGEBAs in a solid form and associated exclusively with the
number of repeating units in the structure backbone as represented by “n” when it comes to the “Type” of epoxy
resins from, for example, Type 1 to Type 10, as tabulated and exampled in Figure 1.1, where the numbers in brackets
represent EEWs. In one sense, greater n values are correlated with higher MWs, better flexibility, higher EEW or
WPE (i.e., weight per epoxide) values, and lower glass transition temperatures (Tg) for the cured resin. To put it
another way, formulations are typically optimized at a specific formulation index (FI) or stoichiometric ratio, that
is, total resins versus total crosslinkers or hardeners in mole, and the higher the EEW of a resin is, the more parts by

weight (or pbw) of the resin are required in formulation. Additionally, the MW has an impact on a resin’s solubility
in a solvent, solution, and melting viscosity, softening or nominal melting temperature (Tm) for solid grades, and its
form as a liquid or a solid at room temperature. Chemical resistance is provided by ether linkages in the structure
of BPA-based epoxies. In several ways, benzene or aromatic segments offer better structural performance than
aliphatic ones, including toughness, cohesive modulus, and heat resistance.
The most commonly used BPA-based epoxies for solvent-free powder and solvent-borne liquid coatings are prob-
ably Types 4 and 5 of medium MWs and EEWs, which combine good flow from the low-MW side and great enough
flexibility from the high-MW side. Instead, high-MW and high-EEW grades, such as Type 7 and above, are pre-
ferred for can and coil coatings due to their greater flexibility, film formation, and moisture resistance. The “Type”
specifications can be used to acquire technical details about epoxy resins. If a “Type” 2 epoxy is specified, for
instance, it is then known to be a solid resin of BPA origin; its EEW ranges from 600 to 720 g/eq, and it is likely
applicable to a liquid (solvent-borne or 100% solids if diluents are also used) or a powder system; and more likely
for general coating or adhesive applications; and vice versa. It should be emphasized once more that “Types” are
exclusively, and without exception, within the purview of BPA-based epoxy resins; otherwise, it is confusing or
misleading. There are many specialties, such as a fluorene-based (non-BPA-based) epoxy monomer, for example,
having an EEW of roughly 250 g/eq, which is comparable to that of BPA-based DER 337 that is classified as a
“Type” 0.5 semi-solid grade in Figure 1.1; however, they are solid rather than liquid. A resin’s “Type” can some-
times be determined by the last numerical number in its trade name, as in the cases of EPON 1007F (EEW 2,000,
Tm 125 ∘C) and 1009F (EEW 2,900, Tm 144 ∘C, Hexion), which stand for a resin of “Type” 7 and “Type” 9, respec-
tively. Notably, low “Type” liquid grades like EPON 828 (EEW 187–189) from Hexion and DER 331 from Olin
are recognized as standard and adaptable DGEBAs for all purposes, including coatings, construction adhesives,
composites, and many others such as synthesis of higher “Types” of solid resins (refer to Debrief C).
Bi-functional resins are unable to crosslink and only allow polymer chain propagation, as taught by polymer
chemistry [4]. Epoxies, however, constitute a special exception to this rule. As an illustration, bi-functional
BPA-based epoxies, when cured under heat by a bi-functional crosslinker, such as a primary or secondary
amine, continue with crosslinking to develop sufficient crosslinking density via the formation of in-situ four-fold
functionalities, as schematically exhibited in Figure 1.2. Since epoxy homo-polymerization (or homo-cures)
thermally takes place under catalysis and produces anionic intermediates RO−as well, this mechanism is
applicable to crosslinker-free formulations, that is, epoxy plus catalyst systems. In other words, regardless of
whether epoxy resins are bi-functional or the formulation stoichiometric ratio is significantly modified, the
majorities of epoxy systems are formulating-friendly and cure very well as long as an appropriate catalyst with an
adequate loading level is applied. Epoxy curing agents, such as crosslinkers and catalysts, as well as epoxy curing
reactions, primarily epoxy-hardener co-polymerization and epoxy-epoxy homo-polymerization, are explained in
Chapters 2 and 3, respectively. In addition, the glass transition temperatures (Tgs) of cured BPA-based epoxies
are typically less than 120 ∘C, alluding to the generic Tg capacity of epoxies.
1.2
BPF-Based (or DGEBF) and Novolac Epoxies
BPF (bisphenol-F, where “F” stands for formaldehyde, pKa ≈10.14)-derived and novolac epoxy resins, as shown
in Figure 1.3, are liquid and solid grades different from but structurally similar to BPA-based ones. Specifically, the

variants, where b stands for one of a variety of MWs and isomeric structures, c stands for epoxy BPA novolac, d stands for
epoxy cresol novolac (ECN), and e stands for epoxy phenol novolac (EPN).
BPF-based (also known as DGEBF or di-glycidyl ethers of bisphenol-F) duplicates DGEBA’s linear para-structures
and pure bi-functionality but lacks the two methyl (–CH3) groups (Figure 1.3a). Novolac epoxies, which function
as more than two, are essentially branched BPFs (Figures 1.3b/c/d/e, also refer to Figure 1.8a). A feature of this
minor difference between the structures of epoxies based on BPF and those based on BPA has significant effects on
performance, including a detrimental reduction in Tg and toughness as well as an improvement in impermeability.
Contrary to theoretical predictions that structural removal of methyl groups apparently diminishes steric effects
in favor of flexibility, BPF-based epoxies do not necessarily improve cured film flexibility in contrast to BPA-based
ones (see Chapter 6 for details). In one embodiment, BPF-based epoxies are formulated with an FI of 1.15: 1
(in favor of epoxies) to produce FDA175.300-compliant, ambient-temperature curable tank linings with adequate
adhesion and flexibility [5]. In contrast to bi-functional (bi-f) DGEBFs (Figure 1.3a), which are obviously derived
directly from BPF, novolac epoxy resins, containing no more aliphatic-OH groups, as shown in Figures 1.3b/c/d/e,
are primarily phenol (C6H5OH, pKa ≈10.0, tri-functional nature comprising ortho-, meta-, and para-positions)
derivatives with Ar-O-R linkages, BPA-derived, or cresol-derived, with their functionalities (f’s) all greater than
two. As a result, cured novolac epoxies develop higher Tg values than DGEBAs. Novolac modified Types 4 (such as
DER 642U and EPON 2012) and 7 (such as DER 672U and EPON 2014) typically have EEW values ranging from
500 to 600 and 750 to 850, respectively. A BPA novolac epoxy (Figure 1.3c) is represented commercially by jER
157 (EEW 208, Mitsubishi Chemical), while a phenol novolac one (Figure 1.3e) is represented commercially by
EPPN-201L (n ≈5, EEW 190, Nippon Kayaku), respectively. An ortho-methyl group in O-cresol novolac epoxies
(Figure 1.3d) structurally distinguish them from phenol novolac ones. Notably, DEN 438 (semi-solid, EEW 178,
formerly DOW) is a general-purpose or commodity novolac epoxy resin suited for applications such as laminations
and microencapsulation.
As illustrated in Figure 1.4, BPF-based and novolac epoxies are expected to perform significantly better than
the BPA-based epoxies in terms of resisting concentrated acids (such as 98% sulfuric acids), as polymer chain
cleavages by carbocation reactions are prohibited with the formers (Figure 1.4b). In other words, novolac and
BPF-based epoxies are preferred over BPA-based grades for developing strong acid-resistant epoxy coatings; multi-f
novolac epoxies should be used over di-f DGEBFs generally. Therefore, BPA-based coal tar epoxies are unsuitable
for situations with high H2S concentrations (such as interior pipelines).
In brief, the most popular grades—often referred to as conventional, traditional, or commodity epoxy resins—are
the BPA-based (or DGEBA) and novolac epoxies. Technically, it is prudent and advantageous to select a linear
BPA-based resin as the bulk resin for formulations emphasizing flexibility and to select a branched novolac for

improving glass transition temperatures (Tg) in practice. This is accomplished by comparing MWs, EEWs, func-
tionality (f), and particularly the chemical structures of epoxy resins or monomers. Without being restricted
to both classes, higher MWs result in lower cured Tg and higher flexibility, which makes sense given that the
polymeric chain segments between crosslinked points get longer or larger as a result of the crosslinking density
declining with increasing MWs. It still applies to both grades, but more so to the BPA-based. Higher the MW, or
“Type,” the more difficult it is to process a compounded premix due to related higher Tms for powder coatings
and the reduced solubility in solvents for liquid coatings. For example, under certain extruder temperature set-
tings of, say, 85/125 ∘C, a Type 7 epoxy (typical with a solution viscosity of 55–100 cPs at 80% concentration in
MEK and melting points of 120–135 ∘C) and beyond for fast gel powder formulations becomes noticeably diffi-
cult to extrude, leading to incomplete/unhomogenized mixing, if underheated, or unacceptable viscosity buildup
causing seeds/grits, if overheated.
1.3
Modified Epoxies
Epoxy resins, especially DGEBA modifications and those defined similarly in terms of the BPA-based structures
but modified by a variety of reactive materials, are becoming increasingly available on the market for formulators
to choose from in order to improve such properties as Tg, toughness, flexibility, abrasion resistance, moisture bar-
rier, adhesion, and others. CTBN (i.e., carboxyl terminated butadiene acrylonitrile), acrylics, urethanes, polyols,
and silicones are among the most common elastomer or rubber materials suitable for epoxy modifications. For
example, EPON 58120 (average EEW 950, 20% CTBN rubber modified, Hexion) and HyPox UA10 (liquid, average
EEW 215, 12% thermoplastic polyurethane modified, Huntsman) are designed to improve toughness, as is KR-693
(average EEW 850, micronized acrylic core-shell particle of 0.5 μm, Kukdo Chemical) for enhancing toughness and
flexibility. KSR-1000 (average EEW 1,200, Kukdo Chemical) and Pel-Sil CX740 (average EEW 2,300, Ele Corp.) are
examples of silicone-modified epoxies with a wide range of MW-dependent EEWs for improving adhesion and
heat resistance.
In practice, these modified epoxies of di-functionality are typically employed as additives or secondary resins
due to issues of incompatibility, mechanical strength impairment, and sometimes blistering after immersion in
hot water, such as at 75 and 95 ∘C for HWA (hot water soak adhesion) testing. There is a reasonable limitation
on the use of these resins in applied coatings unless compatibility and performance harms are addressed; it is
always a tradeoff to incorporate them effectively into formulations. In comparison, isocyanate (−N=C=O, with a

characteristic FTIR peak at 2,274 cm−1)-modified epoxy resins are becoming more popular and significant in high-
performing formulations and applications due to the multiple advantages they have brought to the cured film prop-
erties, including toughness improvement, high Tg capacity (even exceeding 200 ∘C in some valid cases, as discussed
in Chapter 6), and sustained flexibility combined. Depending on the reaction conditions, NCO-modifications of
epoxies result in the creation of isocyanurate rings, a triazine (Figure 1.5b), and/or oxazolidinones (Figures 1.5a/b),
a class of 2-oxazolidine-containing compounds, respectively. Oxazolidines are an interesting standalone chemi-
cal for two-component (2K) polyurethane (PUR) systems because they may be loaded into the polyol side to act
as a moisture scavenger, reactive diluent, and latent curing agent. Examples of such 2-oxazolidine additives are
Incorez’s Incozol® products. Trazines, on the other hand, confer resistance to heat and moisture. Depending on the
isocyanate precursors and as well co-reactions that take place between NCO and the aliphatic secondary OH in the
epoxy backbone (refer to the chemical structure shown in Figure 1.1), NCO-modified epoxies may also produce
bi- or multi-functionalities, as illustrated in Figures 1.5a/b. Typical NCO-modified resins are structurally symmet-
ric, steric, and overall linear (imparting flexibility), as shown in Figure 1.5a, and they have a reasonably high Tg
capability that depends partially on the structures of R and R’ units, as disclosed in a patent application [6]. One
such commercial resin with bi-functional properties is SEY-5310 (EEW ∼320, Tm 102 ∘C, Shin-A T&C), where R’ is
bisphenol TMC (i.e., tri-methyl-cyclohexylidene). Fortegra 310 (EEW ∼425, 10–12% core-shell-rubber materials,
Olin), in contrast, may or may not represent the other isocyanate-toughened epoxy resin product (Figure 1.5b).
Under controlled conditions, bi-functional EPON 828 (EEW 187–189) or multi-functional DEN438 (EEW 200, f =
3.5) can react with MDI (e.g., Covestro’s Mondur M) to produce an offset resin comparable to SEY-5310 or Fortegra
310. When properly used alone or in combination with either SEY-5310 or Fortegra 310 as a co-binder, Tg eleva-
tion, toughening, flexibility, adhesion, and compatibility can be collectively enhanced (refer to relevant sections
in Chapter 6 for details). Blendur products from Covestro are essentially polyisocyanate-modified epoxies.
Di-block copolymers (like PEP-PEO, Figure 1.6a), DCPD (i.e., dicyclopentadiene, Figure 1.6b), adamantane,
PBD (i.e., polybutadiene, Figure 1.6c), polysulfide, and various non-isocyanate modifiers with similar advanta-
geous characteristics are a few examples. Regardless of aromaticity and aliphaticity, these modified epoxy resins
exhibit great adhesive, hydrophobic (for moisture resistance), toughening, and flexibilizing properties when

are DCPD-modified epoxies with the ability to provide low-dielectric constants (Dk) and additional benefits,
including noticeable Tg enhancement (refer to relevant sections in Chapter 6 for formulations and discussion).
Note that adamantane, that is, (CH)4(CH2)6, and DCPD have similar chemical structures. Albipox 8001 (EEW
210, liquid), a special nitrile rubber-modified tackifier from Evonik, is used to effectively improve toughness and
adhesion. When used as low as 5% of all binder resins, Denalex R-15EPT (liquid, EEW 910, Nagase, Figure 1.6c)
offers elasticity and superior wet adhesion to withstand cathodic disbondment while having no incompatibility
concerns. Epolead PB3600 (liquid) from Daicel represents a divergent epoxidized PBD with terminated hydroxyls
in addition to vinyl functionalities for dual reactivities. PIB (polyisobutylene) is also a choice that offers flexibility,
toughness, and adhesion to modifications.
From a broader perspective, liquid crystalline (LC) compounds are distinguished by their dielectric
anisotropy (𝛥𝜀), which is one of the most important physical properties for liquid crystal displays (LCDs).
PVPHS, or poly(4-vinylphenol-co-4-hydrostyrene), and PEO-PPO-PEO, or polyethylene oxide-co-propylene
oxide-co-ethylene oxide, also known as Pluronics, are examples of LCPs with high, positive dielectric anisotropy
(𝛥𝜀> 0) that are commercially available. Hydrostyrene (HS) and PEO serve as flexible blocks, while vinylphenol
(VP) and PPO serve as rigid and polar blocks. Instead, negative dielectric anisotropy (𝛥𝜀< 0) liquid crystals
are predominantly difluoro based, including difluorobenzofuran based [8], difluorophenylene based [9], and
others as described by Chen et al. [10]. In the meantime, it is worthwhile to discuss a few further distinctive
epoxies from a narrower perspective, such as liquid crystalline epoxy resins (LCERs), which have regulated
crystallinity and molecular orientation by employing mesogenic monomers [11, 12], primarily type I biphenyls
(refer to Figure 1.9a), type II bi-naphthalenes (e.g., EPBN monomers, Figure 1.7a), and type III. LCERs, which are
typically low MWs, di- or, multi-epoxide-functional, are reported to improve tensile strength and toughness at the
sacrifice of flexibility. A brand-new class of reactive toughening agents known as liquid crystalline polyurethane
(LCPU, Figure 1.7b) has both flexible chains and rigid biphenyl groups, enabling higher Tg and improved storage
modulus in a rubber state, according to reports [13]. When used as a toughening agent, LC is similar to PES
(polyether sulfone), which is strongly acid resistant. LCE-2615 (EEW 503, Tm 94 ∘C, Nippon Kayaku, Figure 1.6d)

is one of such commercially available LCER products. Reportedly, cured LCE-2615 improves toughness and
thermal conductivity up to 0.31 W/m-∘K (compared to the average 0.24 W/m-∘K for the BPA-based epoxies).
Other special modifications include liquid jER YX-7400 (EEW 430, Mitsubishi Chemical) with high elastic
modulus (i.e., resilience) similar to silicone rubber (low elastomeric Tg −40 ∘C) and semi-solid YX-7110 (EEW
1,124, Mitsubishi Chemical) with excellent flexibility (due to segments of extended MWs and linear structures)
at certain temperatures, respectively, as shown in Figures 1.6e/f. Similar to jER YX-7400 (Figure 1.6e), Albiflex
296 (EEW 825–850, silicone content 40%, Nanoresins/Evonik) and series are epoxy-silicone copolymers with
enhanced elasticity and flexibility. Epoxyphosphazene (Figure 1.6g), which exhibits unique poly-functionalities,
is reported to accelerate the thermal cure process [6]. Acryset® BPA328 (liquid, EEW 230 ± 10) and BPF307
(liquid, EEW 210 ± 10) from Nippon Shokubai are acrylic rubber dispersed epoxy resins that provide outstanding
adhesion and toughness without scarifying the thermal resistance typical of chemical rubber modifications.
However, compatibility and processability should always be verified when working with these resins.
Thiokol Flep-60 (liquid, EEW 280) by Toray Fine Chemicals is a special polysulfide-modified epoxy resin
that allows for great flexibility, moisture resistance, dielectric strength, flow, and adhesion. It is suitable for
low-temperature applications such as fast-curing adhesives and resilient floor coatings. Unfortunately, these
resins release an odor, especially during thermal cure. In addition, there are epoxies with phosphorus and
bromine modifications for flame retardance, such as SEN-920 (average EEW 300, Shin-A T&C) and equivalently
GEBR-589 (average EEW 310, Grace Epoxy, China), with chelate and block urethane modifications for structural
adhesives and sealants, such as EP-49-10P2 (liquid, EEW 300, Adeka) and EPU-17T-6 (liquid, EEW 270, Adeka),
and with di-block PEO-PEP copolymer and polyol modifications for toughened fusion bonded epoxy (FBE)
powder coatings, such as Fortegra 664-12 (EEW 1,010, Olin) and Fortegra 304 (EEW 980, Olin), respectively.
Chelate-modified epoxies, particularly, are suitable for use as structural adhesives on rusted metals and non-metal
substrates, as are blocked urethanes as flexible and tough body sealants. Sometimes compatibility is more impor-
tant when using silicone-modified epoxies as a co-binder. Notably, various other modifications can be used to
improve a variety of performance characteristics, such as viscosity, adhesiveness, compatibility, flexibility, low
water absorption, low-dielectric loss tangent (Df)/Dk, high Tg, and toughness. These modifications include, but
are not limited to, phosphorus, sulfuric acid, dimer acids, LC biphenyls, silicones, and others. Please note that no
attempt has been made herein to provide an exhaustive list of modified epoxies, as this quest is also impossible.
Instead, researchers and formulators are encouraged to keep an open mind about emerging resins with distinct
structural alterations and to evaluate them as necessary for the greatest performance and cost-effectiveness.
1.4
Poly-functional or Matrix Epoxies
An essential class for creating high Tg coatings is multi- or poly-functional, or simply matrix epoxies that can
build up a high crosslinking density. The market for heat-resistant products that address thermal stability and UV
(ultra-violet) blocking in niche end uses is seen to be steadily expanding. Matrix epoxies are typically in a solid form
of low-MW monomers, which results in low EEWs and melting temperatures that are generally easy to process

before curing, high modulus, and low moisture absorption (which indicates hot/wet properties), but brittleness
(lack of toughness and elongation) as a result of low MWs combined with high crosslinking density after curing.
DGEBAs are straightly di-functional; therefore, poly-functional epoxies are rarely BPA-based; some matrix
epoxies also exhibit flame-retardant characteristics. Formulators have access to a wide variety of commercially
accessible matrix epoxies that are all aromatic and multi-f, such as jER 1032 (EEW 169, Mitsubishi Chemical,
Figure 1.8b), EPON 165 (EEW 215, f = 5.5–6.0, Hexion, Figure 1.8a), and EOCN-102S (EEW 211, Nippon
Kayaku), an EPON 165 equivalent, which are phenol novolac grades structurally containing ortho-methyl groups
(in comparison to Figure 1.3e). Tri-functional products are such as Tactix 742 (EEW 160, Huntsman, Figure 1.8c),
an offset to Aditya Birla’s YDM 460 (EEW 165), and NC-6000 (EEW 192–210, Nippon Kayaku, Figure 1.8d),
or competitively, Techmore VG3101L (EEW 210, Printec/Japan). Tetra-functional products are such as jER 604
(liquid, EEW 120), that is, tetraglycidyl-4, 4′-diaminodiphenyl methane (abbreviated TGDDM, Figure 1.8e),
an offset to Aditya Birla’s YDM 441 (EEW 108–117), and Hexion’s EPON 1031 (EEW ∼210, novolac-free).
Kukdo Chemical’s KDT-4400, Mitsubishi Chemical’s jER 1031S (Figure 1.8f), Nippon Kayaku’s GTR-1800, and
JSI’s Glyether EJ-3110 are all direct offsets to EPON 1031. Epiclon HP-4710 (EEW 165, DIC, Figure 1.8g) is a
naphthalene-based, 4-fold functional epoxy resin in particular. Notably, most epoxies contain chlorine, such
as TGDDM (Figure 1.8e); low chlorine grades are believed to offer improved anticorrosion performance due
to decreased electrolyte migration (refer to Figure 10.18 in Chapter 10), in addition to reduced contamination
(leaching) concerns, better film transparency, and non-yellowing desired for electronics applications.
Poly-functional epoxies are engineered primarily for composite applications in the aerospace industry, such as
CFRP (carbon-fiber-reinforced plastics or polymers). In this regard, the following three attributes of resins are
desirable: i) low viscosity for processing (e.g., fiber wet-out); ii) toughness and high modulus (or sometimes the
composite strength described as
𝜏
Δ𝜀or the reciprocal of creep compliance = strain change (𝛥𝜀)/stress (𝜏) in 1/Pa;
refer to Chapter 5); and iii) high Tg (indicating heat resistance once cured). Combining a high modulus with a
high Tg yields advantageous hot-wet properties. As the cured Tg or crosslinking density grows, the flexural or bend-
ing modulus appears to decrease, which is a direct result of functionality (f) increasing from low (e.g., HP-4770,
EEW 204, f = 2) to medium (e.g., XEA-4750, EEW 185, f = 3) to high (HP-4710, EEW 170, f = 4). As experimentally
confirmed [14], the compressive strength of cured CFRP measured by three-point bending is highly dependent on
the shear rigidity of the cured resin.

Specialty Epoxies
Figure 1.9 and Table 1.2 illustrate examples of specialty epoxy monomers and resins, either di-f or multi-f, that
are not necessarily derived from BPA-based grades or by modifications similar to those described in the preceding
sections for isocyanates and others. Several of them, including those based on biphenyl (Figure 1.9a), are recog-
nized as molding compounds. jER YX4000 (EEW 186) from Mitsubishi Chemical and SE-400 (EEW 182) from
Shin-A T&C are both biphenyl type epoxies with low melt viscosity and high crystalline tendency (i.e., for pattern-
ing and orientation), making them suitable for encapsulating and molding applications similar to the one depicted
in Figure 1.9a. In addition, due to their rigid aromatic structures, di-f ETMBPS (i.e., epoxy tetramethyl bisphenol-S,
Figure 1.9b), the high-MW phenoxy type (Figure 1.9c), the anthracene based (Figure 1.9d), and tetra-f nitrogen
containing (i.e., partially resembling the structure of TGDDM, Figure 1.9e [15]) are all anticipated to deliver rel-
atively high-cured Tgs. Particularly, ETMBPS has a low melting viscosity, supposedly allowing cured Tg to reach
up to 200 ∘C for great heat resistance while enhancing dielectric constant and dielectric loss (Dk/Df). Nonetheless,
its mechanical properties are comparable to or inferior to those of commodity DGEBAs. Similarly, the high-MW
phenoxy, such as jER YL7600 (EEW 420, Mitsubishi Chemical), and anthracene grades, such as jER YX8800 (EEW
178–180, Mitsubishi Chemical), can offer high-cured Tgs despite their di-functionality, high thermal conductivity
due to molecular orientation like LCERs, low CTE (coefficient of thermal expansion), good compatibility, and film
formation.
Fluorinated epoxy resins (FER) are superhydrophobic, such as di-functional 6F Bis-A-AF (here “F” denotes
fluorine) as tabulated in Table 1.2a, allowing for significantly enhanced repellent performance. It is well known
that post-fluorination of plastic bottles increases their chemical and moisture resistance and prevents paneling.
Etna Tec is one of the companies that supplies commercial FERs. Mitsubishi Chemical’s jER YX7760 (EEW 238,
off-white powder at room temperature) has been tested on an FBE platform to achieve a regular Tg around 115 ∘C
and excellent adhesion to metal substrates; the finished powders are sprayable, but their low-surface energy makes
them too sticky to be fluidizable in fluidized bed dipping application systems, creating processing and cleaning
challenges.
To emphasize, fluorene (not “fluorinated”) epoxies and similar compounds, such as the di-f bisphenol
fluorene-based (Table 1.2b-1), the tetra-f BCAFG (Table 1.2b-2), the di-f naphthalene fluorene-based (Table 1.2c),
the di-f PPP-BP epoxy (Table 1.2d), and the di-f phthalazinone-based (Table 1.2e) with fluorenyl or phthalide
cardo groups, among others, likely represent the most advanced epoxy resin technology thus far. Simply

described, fluorene epoxies and analogous monomers would comprise the apex of an epoxy pyramid, with
conventional or commodity DGEBAs and novolacs serving as the foundation and everything else in between.
Di- and tetra-functionalities of fluorene epoxies are not unusual, but they are distinguished by multiple ben-
zene rings or naphthalene rings rigidly fused together to form a super bulky, three-dimensionally steric, yet
molecularly rotatable >C< center. Fluorene epoxies such as OGSOL PG-100 (softening temperature 65 ∘C, Osaka
Gas Chemicals, Table 1.2b-1) or equivalently SE-250 from Shin-A T&C, and naphthalene fluorene ones such as
OGSOL CG-500 (softening temperature 87 ∘C, Osaka Gas Chemicals, Table 1.2c) can be formulated exclusively to
achieve Tg values up to 250 ∘C. When properly formulated and cured, the employment of these fluorene epoxy
monomers as an additive or bulk resin results in coating films with unrivaled toughness, adhesion, flexibility, and
impermeability. The compositions of patent-protected coatings [16] are detailed in Chapter 6. Notably, and as
described in the same patent application, di-functional N-phenyl phenolphthalein bisphenol (PPP-BP) epoxies,
such as Noryl® PPP-BP epoxy (EEW 250–260, Sabic Thermosets, Table 1.2d) [17] and equivalently WHR-991S
(EEW 269, Nippon Kayaku), in a fine powder form, have been evaluated to perform competitively in terms of
their high heat resistance and toughness. According to Zhang et al. [18], phthalazinone-based epoxies (Table 1.2e)
with a low melting point (indicating good flow before gelation) result in a Tg of up to 274 ∘C when properly
formulated and cured for intrinsic flame retardancy. Even with di-functionality, these novel epoxies demonstrate

14
1 Epoxy Resins, Monomers, and Derivatives
exceptional Tg and toughness, indicating that physical stericity and chain entanglements, as opposed to typical
chemical crosslinking, sometimes play a larger-than-anticipated role in the crosslinked networks of epoxy
resins.
1.6
Aliphatic and UV-Curable Epoxies
Aliphatic epoxies, including alicyclic (i.e., cycloaliphatic) varieties, have UV-resistant advantages over their aro-
matic counterparts. Due to their superior color stability over time, aliphatic and alicyclic epoxies are more suit-
able for certain niche applications, including benchtop molding, for instance. PBD-modified epoxies (refer to
Figure 1.6c) and similar compounds appear to be aliphatic, as do glycidyl esters (refer to Figure 2.5 in Chapter 2).
Aliphatic and alicyclic epoxies are either di-f or multi-f (e.g., Daicel EHPE 3150, EEW 177, Tm 75 ∘C, Figure 1.10a)
and hydrophobic, exhibiting moisture resistance and electrical insulation that are crucial to certain electronic
applications. In terms of epoxide reactivity, the following sequence is typically observed, from fastest to slowest:
aromatic > aliphatic > cycloaliphatic. It is not uncommon for aromatic and aliphatic epoxies to be incompatible
in hybrid formulations, as indicated by fisheyes and pinholes.
Hydrogenated DGEBAs obviously replace aromatic benzene rings with aliphatic xylene rings, thereby enhanc-
ing UV resistance, moisture barrier performance, and transparency (e.g., for unfilled clearcoats), but at the expense
of reactivity and heat resistance. As illustrated in Figure 1.10b, liquid YX8000 (EEW 198) from Mitsubishi Chem-
ical and solid ST-4100D (EEW 1,100, Tm 108 ∘C) from Kukdo Chemical are convenient commercial grades of
hydrogenated epoxies that are di-functional and linearly structured. Note that hydrogenated C5 (aliphatic) and
C9 (aromatic) hydrocarbon resins, such as the Bitoner® series, are commonly utilized as tackifiers in hot melts
(HMs) and pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs; refer to adhesion in Chapter 10).
UV (ultra-violet) curing of epoxies relies heavily on aliphatic and alicyclic epoxides because aromatic epoxies
break down chalking when exposed to UV. Cure reactions take place very rapidly, particularly for alicyclic epoxies,
via cationic ring-opening etherification of epoxies (i.e., epoxy homo-polymerization) catalyzed by oxonium ions
such as onium salts (refer to Figures 2.14a/b in Chapter 2 for cationic catalysts and refer to Table 2.6a and
Figure 3.7 in Chapter 3 for cationic cure reactions, respectively). Please note that base materials or impurities
such as water (which is a chain transfer agent), anionic surfaces, and negatively charged substrates will inhibit
the cationic polymerization of aliphatic epoxies. Daicel EHPE 3150 and the aforementioned hydrogenated
epoxies are undeniably UV curable. Cyracure UVR-6128 (EEW 200) from Dow is a di-functional alicyclic epoxide
resin (essentially a glycidyl ester, Figure 1.10c) that is commercially available for UV-curing formulations and
is anticipated to afford anti-yellowing, great adhesion, and low-shrinkage properties. In contrast, the UV curing
of acrylics/acrylates follows a free radical mechanism that uses peroxides as photo-initiators. Aliphatic epoxies
are generally less effective than aromatic epoxies in terms of Tg, flexibility, and toughness because they lack
aromaticity.

1.7 Oxetanes

1.7
Oxetanes
It is not a coincidence, as reviewed by Bull et al. and Thompson [19, 20], that all commercially available med-
ications contain the oxetane ring or oxetanes (pKa 2.0, ring strain 107 kJ/mol), which are 4-membered cyclic
ethers that are more acidic and elastic but less reactive than oxirane analogs (i.e., epoxides, pKa 3.7, ring strain
114 kJ/mol) [21]. Oxetanes have an FTIR peak at 980 cm−1 as opposed to 780 cm−1, which is typical of oxiranes.
Notably, oxetanes undergo ring-opening reactions via UV or cationic catalysis in a manner similar to oxiranes;
however, oxetanes are very difficult to react with strongly nucleophilic amines under basic conditions unless they
are specifically catalyzed, as shown in Figure 1.11a [22]. Consequently, both primary and secondary aliphatic
hydroxyl groups are produced. As has also been reported [23], oxetanes react with active esters when catalyzed
(e.g., by tetraphenyl phosphonium chloride, or TPPCI) at 180–190 ∘C for up to nine hours to produce a gel prod-
uct (insoluble in NMP or DMAc solvents). Miscellaneous di-f, tri-f, and multi-f oxetane resins are illustrated in
Figures 1.11d/e/f/g, including specialty fluorene-based monomers (Figure 1.11e).
In contrast to epoxy resins, which typically undergo rapid initiation but sluggish propagation, the cure reactions
of oxetanes are thermally slow to initiate, even when exposed to UV light; however, when the concentration of
initiators exceeds a certain threshold, they undergo rapid polymerization. For rapid cure completion, it is, there-
fore, potentially synergistic to combine aliphatic epoxies with oxetane resins [24]. In other words, when epoxy
resins with fast initiation are combined with a sufficient amount of mono-f or di-f oxetanes, the curing speed may
be comparable to or superior to that of cycloaliphatic epoxies used for UV-cationic polymerization, in addition
to likely flexibility and toughness advantages (due to higher MWs). Appropriate oxetane resins or monomers are
so reactive that post-curing (also known as dark reactions [25]) can be completed in approximately ten minutes
of UV radiation, as opposed to up to four hours required for cycloaliphatic epoxies. Notably, oxetane derivatives,
particularly mono-functional diluents such as mono-f OXA (Figure 1.11b) and di-f DOX (Figure 1.11c), acceler-
ate UV curing and curing completion. In the majority of instances, the addition of oxetanes to epoxies improves
modulus and Tg (with the exception of aromatic epoxies), but not necessarily adhesion, especially for plastic sub-
strates, unless cure rates are managed and optimized. If inhibitors are not introduced, formulations of epoxies
containing oxetanes may exhibit an increase in viscosity with time. Since oxetanes are more sensitive to water
than oxiranes, the UV-cationic curing of oxetanes is also affected by atmospheric humidity unless air moisture
is controlled. Nagase, Perstorp, Toagosei, and Sanyo, among others, are suppliers of commercial oxetane resins,

both mono-functional and di-functional. Thietanes and azetidines, which are sulfur and nitrogen substituting for
oxygen in oxetanes, have chemical reactivity that is either less than or equivalent to that of oxetanes.
1.8
Epoxy Derivatives
Self-crosslinkable epoxies are not completely novel, but it is worthwhile to briefly introduce them herein as a
derivative of epoxies because they may be suitable for some niche applications. Epoxies must be dual-functional
in order to self-crosslink under heat in the presence or absence of a catalyst, going beyond epoxide-epoxide
homo-polymerization under catalysis. Dual functions indicate that one of the functions is the epoxide and
the other is an epoxide-reactive function. KD-3013 (EEW 700–1,500, EW-PhOH 700–2,500, Tm 95 ∘C, Kukdo
Chemical) and KD-4014 (EEW 1,000–2,000, EW-PhOH 1,000–3,000, Tm 105 ∘C), both from Kukdo Chemical,
are commercial grades of self-crosslinkable epoxies with both epoxide and phenyl hydroxyl (Ph-OH) functions
capable of intra- and inter-molecular crosslinking when thermally activated, as illustrated in Figure 1.12a. In
addition, Fine-Clad A-241 (EEW 600, EW-OH 1,122 calculated from hydroxyl value 50, Tm ∼66 ∘C, Reichhold)
as an additive resin with both glycidyl and aliphatic hydroxyl functional groups may be another example for
powder coatings, despite the hydroxyls being aliphatic, reactive with, for example, isocyanates or melamine under
catalysts, but not necessarily with epoxides under normal cure settings.
Flexible phenoxy resins are an epoxy derivative lacking epoxide-functional groups (Figure 1.12b); nevertheless,
the original aliphatic hydroxyls (i.e., secondary OHs) on the backbone remain intact and reactive or crosslinkable
with, for example, polyisocyanates (such as TDI and MDI) at room temperature and melamine-formaldehyde (MF)
at elevated temperatures (such as 150 ∘C and above) for additional crosslinking, if necessary. Similar to thermo-
plastics, phenoxy resins of high MWs are compatible with 1/2K solvent-based coatings, such as zinc-rich primers,
and function as coating tougheners. For example, phenoxy resins applied to magnetic coatings enhance adhesion
to PET film substrates. In a similar fashion, the addition of high-MW phenoxy PK-ZN40 (Gabriel/Huntsman) as
an additive to solvent-borne zinc-based anticorrosive coatings improves their flexibility, toughness, and adhesion.
If employed as a secondary resin in epoxy composites or coatings, phenoxy resins are preferably combined with
DGEBAs of Type 4 or lower; otherwise, unacceptable incompatibility may develop. As described previously, jER
YL7600 DMAcH25 (MW 30,000, EEW 420, 25% solution in DMAc; refer to Figure 1.10b) by Mitsubishi Chemical
is essentially an epoxy-terminated phenoxy resin.

1.9 BPA-Free Epoxies
17
In addition to glycidyl methacrylate acids, or GMAs (refer to Figure 2.5a/b in Chapter 2), epoxy vinyl esters, or
simply vinyl esters (Figures 1.12c/d), are considered an epoxy derivative with functional groups transferred from
epoxides to alternating vinyl, di-functional if derived from DGEBAs, and multi-functional if derived from epoxy
novolac grades. Vinyl functions are self-crosslinkable via free radicals (refer to Table 9.2 in Chapter 9), crosslink-
able by amines via Michael Addition (refer to Figures 3.9 in Chapter 3 and 8.5a in Chapter 8), crosslinkable
by thiols via thiol-Michael click reactions (refer to Figure 9.20c in Chapter 9), crosslinkable by acetylacetonate
in the presence of base catalysts (refer to Figures 4.1d in Chapter 4 and 8.9a in Chapter 8), crosslinkable by
conjugated aldehyde in the presence of acid catalysts (refer to Figure 3.11c in Chapter 3), and crosslinkable by
silicon hydride under organometallic catalysis (refer to Figure 9.14c in Chapter 9). Crosslinking of vinyl esters
by aldehydes (R-CHO) under cationic catalysis (refer to Figure 3.11c in Chapter 3) [26] is very similar to amino
resins (refer to Chapter 8) under acid catalysis and vinyl-thiol (SH-functional) reactions via UV radiation (refer
to Figure 9.20c in Chapter 9). Novolac vinyl esters have relatively higher HDT (heat distortion temperatures)
than BPA-derived vinyl esters [27], comparable to conventional novolac epoxies relative to DGEBAs. For example,
Reichhold/Polynt Composites’ Dion® 9100 series and elastomer-modified 9500 (61% solids in vinyl toluene) are
BPA-based epoxy-derived vinyl esters. AOC (www.aocresins.com), Poliya (www.poliya.com), and Showa Denso
(Ripoxy Epoxy-Acrylates) are probably the leading vinyl ester suppliers in the United States, Europe, and Japan,
respectively. Vinyl ester-based coating systems are typically 2K solvent-based and are cured at ambient tempera-
ture by organic peroxides, preferably in conjunction with a metal salt (such as cobalt naphthenate) and dimethy-
laniline as co-promoters (details are not offered as it is a separate subject). After curing, vinyl ester coatings should
exhibit robust performance characteristics between polyesters and epoxies, making them suitable for rail cargo,
containers, and other end-use applications.
1.9
BPA-Free Epoxies
In general, aliphatic, alicyclic, and other epoxy resins and monomers, such as the aforementioned fluorene-based
monomers, are BPA-free, a driver in food packaging coatings. However, “BPA-free” here refers specifically to epox-
ies devoid of BPA-skeleton structures that perform similarly to the standard BPA-based epoxy resins. BPA-free
epoxies are of tremendous interest to consumer sectors that are massively transitioning to a circular economy
and sustainable polymer material resources. Currently, can and food packaging coatings rely on the all-around
epoxy technology (benchmarked against other platforms such as polyesters, acrylics, and polyurethanes) in some
capacity to the extent of 80%. Commercial beverage can coatings commonly employ modified Type 8 and beyond
bulk epoxies, that is, those having a repeating unit number “n” greater than 14 (a.k.a., MW 4,500–7,500; refer to
Figure 1.1), in conjunction with ETPPI (i.e., ethyltriphenylphosphorium iodide) as the catalyst of choice (readers
may also refer to Debrief C). The absence of BPA is the driver for change on an industrial scale; being BPA-free
entails monomer alternatives that do not contain BPA, BPF, BPS, or any other, in addition to full HSE (health
safety environment) compliance. As a result, the monomers that can be used to produce BPA-free epoxy resins
are narrowed down and listed in Figure 1.13. Among them, di-butyl-HQ (Figure 1.13c) and TMBPF (Figure 1.13d)
are acceptably devoid of biological responses in HSE considerations, whereas TMBPF, HQ (Figure 1.13a), and
di-butyl-HQ are suitable in terms of monomer reactivity. However, only TMBPF and HQ are cost-effective. In the
end, TMBPF and HQ are singled out, according to patent disclosures [28, 29]. A valid and preferred epoxy resin
product of TMBPF-DGE-HQ (Figure 1.13e) demonstrates BPF-like aromaticity, EEW 2,941, uncured Tg at 40 ∘C,
and cured Tg at 105 ∘C in coatings of 20–22% NVM (non-volatile mass), which is comparable to the performance of
many liquid BPA-based epoxies, albeit with the caveat that the formulation must be properly fabricated to address
its slow reactivity (due to its high MW and EEW).

In another embodiment, PSG DGEs (EEW ∼210, Tm ∼100 ∘C, Figure 1.13f), also known as pentaspirogly-
col di-glycidyl ethers, are derived from hydroxyl di-functional 2,4,8,10-tetraoxaspiro [5,5] undecanes (CAS#
1455-42-1), either unsubstituted or substituted, by reacting with epichlorohydrin (ECH) [30]. They are completely
aliphatic and di-functional epoxies that are BPA-free or BPA-NI (no BPA intentionally added) and used as
alternatives for can and food packaging coatings that operate at high line speeds, such as 2,000 cans per minute.
However, PSG DGE’s performance is expected to be inferior due to its lack of aromaticity. In other embodiments,
bio-based furan-based epoxies have the potential to be BPA-free supplements [31–33].
1.10
Bio-Based Epoxies
BPA-free epoxies are not necessarily bio-based, nor are bio-based epoxies necessarily BPA-free. Conventionally,
epoxies are manufactured from BPA and ECH, both of which are derived from non-renewable and non-recyclable
petroleum feedstocks, such as propylene with zero bio-content. BPA is typically non-bio-based, whereas ECH can
be produced entirely from biomass, such as agricultural glycerol. It is believed that GHGs (greenhouse gases, such
as CO2 and methane) are responsible for global climate change; therefore, efforts to develop epoxies from green
and renewable feedstocks promote the reduction of CO2 emissions and carbon footprints. According to Thipa et al.
[34], the total bio-based carbon content of BPA-based epoxies, such as the Epotec G series epoxy resins and diluents,
which consist of green glycerol-based ECH and still fossil fuel-based BPA, is 28%. Di-functional epoxy monomers
synthesized from magnolol, that is, aromatic epoxidized 2,2′-dimethyoxy-5,5′-diallyl-(1,1′-biphenyl) (EMDBP for
short, Figure 1.14a), are entirely bio-based and capable of attaining a relatively high Tg of up to 168 ∘C as measured
by the Tan𝛿peak from DMA (dynamic mechanical analysis) [2].

1.11
Epoxy Diluents and Flexibilizers
Reactive epoxy diluents are functional liquids with low viscosity, MWs, and EEWs that can react with curing agents
in a similar fashion to LERs (liquid epoxy resins). If necessary, reactive diluents are used to reduce the viscosity
of the base resin, improve handling and processing, and optimize the bulk epoxy system’s performance attributes
[35], such as impact strength, flexibility, filler loading, and solvent resistance, for a variety of applications. The
majority of reactive diluents are either aliphatic or aromatic glycidyl ethers; the former are typically mono-f, di-f,
or multi-f, whereas the latter are only mono-f or di-f. Aditya Birla’s RD 124, 129, and 143, for instance, are aliphatic
tri-f (castor oil-based), tetra-f (pentaerythritol-based), and six-fold reactive (sorbitol-based) diluents, while RD
138 and 137 are aromatic mono-f (nonyl-phenyl-based) and di-f (resorcinol-based) diluents, respectively; some
of them qualify as bio-based thinners. Alcohols, xylene, and butanol solvents, as well as the plasticizers DIDP
(diisodecyl phthalate), DOP (dioctyl phthalate), and DIOP (diisooctyl phthalate), are examples of non-reactive
diluents. Moreover, certain reactive liquid polymers with epoxy or other functional groups, such as CTBN (or other
rubber)-modified epoxies, dimer acid-modified epoxies (such as Hypox DA323), urethane-elastomer-modified
epoxies (such as Hypox UA10), acrylate-functional resins (such as Evonik’s Ancarez® 2364; refer to Table 6.2 in
Chapter 6), and others, can serve as flexibilizers in epoxy systems if properly formulated. Molecular aromaticity
and film formation are crucial to the cured performance of epoxy coatings.
1.12
Epoxy Vitrimers
Epoxy vitrimers, which are non-reactive matrix materials, are discussed in conjunction with epoxy resins,
monomers, and derivatives that exhibit chemical reactivity upon activation. This is an emerging area of extensive
research and development interest. Specifically speaking, epoxy and other vitrimers are non-reactive in the form of
a finished product that has already undergone at least a minimal degree of curing or crosslinking, whereas epoxy
coatings are typically completely cured for end uses. As attentively reviewed by Yang et al. [36], epoxy vitrimers are
reversible covalently crosslinked networks with dynamic covalent bonds [37] that combine the reprocessability
of thermoplastics (e.g., functional self-healing, welding, reshaping, and recycling properties) with the superior
mechanical properties of thermosets. At some point, epoxy vitrimers can be classified as pseudo-thermosets or
pseudo-thermoplastics. Catalyst-free epoxy vitrimers have emerged alongside catalyst-based epoxy vitrimers as
a new generation of vitrimeric systems and composites [38]. For example, these new epoxy vitrimers can be
synthesized free of catalysts via click thiol-Michael Addition followed by transesterification [39].
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) can be utilized to readily characterize the curing kinetics of an epoxy
vitrimer; if required, FTIR monitoring can also be employed in tandem. One recent embodiment [40] uses DSC pri-
marily to determine the cure behaviors and rheology of a vitrimeric molding composite (based on an autocatalytic
model). As reported, the epoxy vitrimer matrix derived from DGEBAs and 4-APDS (4-aminophenyl disulfide; MW
248.4 g/mol, Tm 77–78 ∘C, EW-NH 62.1 g/eq, Figure 1.14b) at an epoxy to amine molar ratio of 2: 1 in the formu-
lation exhibited a topological transition temperature of 149.5 ∘C, which was noticeably lower than the expected
fully cured Tg of 162.6 ∘C. Electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding composites comprised of stainless-steel
fabric and epoxy-based vitrimers have been recently described as demonstrating mechanical properties that
remain sustainable even after repeated recycling [41]. Regardless of the reactive or non-reactive state of an epoxy
vitrimer, DMA techniques presumably enable the quantitative prediction of its re-processable flow and rheology
properties.

20
1 Epoxy Resins, Monomers, and Derivatives
Debrief A Hydrophobicity
All polymers, including cured epoxies, are permeable, which has a negative impact on barrier properties, such as
protection against surface corrosion, over time. As a key characteristic of epoxy systems, hydrophobicity, accompa-
nied by low-surface tension or energy, is the basis for moisture barrier or wetting repellence; super hydrophobicity
typically denotes exceptional long-term water or moisture resistance, in addition to dielectric performance. Con-
ceptually, the attractive force between molecules at the surface of a liquid is referred to as its surface tension;
the equivalent attractive force between molecules at the surface of a solid substance is referred to as its sur-
face energy. Notably, hydrophobicity is a function of physical van der Waals interactions with water molecules,
independent of polarity, which is chemically determined by intramolecular covalent electronegativity, as revealed
by Dalvi et al. [42]. Without being restricted by theory, non-polar compounds, such as hydrocarbons (C-C and
C-H), are typically hydrophobic, whereas strongly polar bonds, such as fluorocarbons (C-F), exhibit hydrophobic
behaviors.
Some of the preceding materials, including fluorinated and fluorene epoxies, etc., are highly hydrophobic. Reac-
tive silica nanoparticles reportedly render epoxies extremely hydrophobic [43]. Impermeability is essential for
polymer matrix composites, such as cured epoxies, to maintain thermomechanical properties, as water uptake
(on top of the saturated water content) results in a considerable dry Tg reduction, also known as a wet Tg knock-
down. Consequently, the upper thermal operational limit of the cured film, which is constrained by the wet
Tg, is subject to catastrophic degradation. The cured Tg of epoxies is estimated to decrease by 20 ∘C for every
1% increase in water absorption weight, whereas non-polar hydrocarbon substitutions (Figure 1.14c) increase
hydrophobicity [44].
Debrief B MWs, EEWs, and functionality (f )
In terms of MW in g/mol, MWD (molecular weight distribution), EEW in g/eq, and functionality (f), epoxy
monomers and resins are not created equal, as these are universal parameters that define their final performance,
even if they are of the same type or regarded as direct substitutes. MW and MWD, as determined by GPC/SEC using
a refractive index (RI) detector, are nominal and relative; however, absolute MWs are often more appropriate when
light scattering (LS) detection is utilized. Especially for high-MW resins and polymers, the actual MWs fall some-
where between Mn by RI and Mw by LS. In certain high-performance formulations, MWD ultimately differentiates
resins from one another; for example, macroscopically, some Type 5 resins are consistently successful in the for-
mulation of FBE rebar coatings in terms of sustaining extreme low-temperature (e.g., −45 ∘C) bending (correlated
primarily to flexibility and secondarily to adhesion and toughness), whereas others (reportedly the same grades
also having similar MW/EEW levels but from different vendors) simply fail. This outcome is perhaps something
that can only be understood through hands-on experience. In Chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6, epoxy crosslinking and
crosslinked structures will be discussed in terms of their microscopic and cure-dynamic significance.
Without limiting to theory, functionality (f) =
MW
EEW, where MW commonly represents the number averaged
Mn. If the f for a specific epoxy resin is already known (e.g., f = 2 for DGEBAs) and the MW is also correctly
quantified by GPC/SEC, or alternatively, the chemical structure, including the repeating unit, is well determined
by, for example, NMR techniques, it is straightforward to calculate the approximate or exact EEW of the resin or
monomer using the equation EEW = MW
f . The MWs of BPA-based epoxy resins can be conveniently approximated
by f x EEW = 2 x EEW, and vice versa.
Occasionally, modified epoxies (e.g., isocyanate-modified) are not completely soluble in a GPC solvent (such as
THF), resulting in an underestimation of their MWs. Titration is an alternative, simpler method for determining
the EEW of an unidentified epoxy resin, as follows: using a rough EEW estimate, weigh up, for example, 0.50 g
of the resin, add 25 ml of the solvent chlorobenzene, heat and stir as necessary to completely dissolve the resin,
charge 15 ml of an indicator, titrate the solution with perchloric acid of 0.1 M (mol/l) until the color changes from

1.12 Epoxy Vitrimers
21
purple to blue/green, and repeat the steps to obtain an averaged value using the following equation:
Epoxy Equivalent Weight (EEW) =
Weight of resin (g) × 104
Volume of the acid consumed (ml)
As a comparison, the following equation is universally valid for, for example, polyols and hydroxyl-functional
polyesters and acrylics (MW of KOH = 56.1 g/mol):
Hydroxyl Equivalent Weight (EW −OH) =
56.1 × 1,000
OH number (or acid value or number)
Likewise, the following equation calculates the equivalent weight of isocyanates in terms of the functional NCO
group (MW of NCO = 42.0 g/mol):
NCO Equivalent Weight (EW −NCO) =
42.0 × 100
NCO%by wt.
An OH number and NCO content can be determined through titration or NIR (near-infrared) spectroscopy. It
is noted that f = MW
EW holds true for epoxies, polyesters, and isocyanates alike.
Critical to certain NSF61/600-compliant products are the subtle variations in epoxies’ alien benzene content
that exist among various formulations. According to NSF600 certification protocols, GCMS detection of benzene
in water extracts of coated and cured articles immersed in commercial hot water (82 ∘C) for 24 hours must be
below 0.50 ppb. Certain coating products formulated with particular epoxy resins pass the stringent threshold,
whereas others fail due to and in accordance with the initial benzene residues in the resin sources, as compared in
Table 1.3. Araldite GT-7220 and GT-7255 are currently the most suitable materials for formulating NSF-approved
products.
Debrief C Synthesis of SERs from LERs
Within the scope of DGEBAs, low-MW LERs are typically lower types (e.g., n < 0.5) produced by reacting BPA (i.e.,
phenyl hydroxyl- or PhOH-functional) with ECH, whereas medium and high-MW SERs (solid epoxy resins) can

be produced by reacting BPA with LERs under an applicable stoichiometric ratio (of BPA to the liquid resin) and
thermal control as well as slight catalyzation, as illustrated in Table 1.4, where solid Type 5 epoxy (EEW ∼1,300) is
made from liquid EPON 828 (EEW 187–189) at a molar ratio of di-f epoxy to di-f BPA at 1.284. Notably, high-MW
SERs can also be produced from aliphatic and alicyclic glycidyl ethers and esters (with free BPA content below
1 ppm) [45], as opposed to the conventional low-MW BPA/BPF epoxy resins. Other grades of epoxy resins can be
produced in the same manner.
It is all about keeping MW accumulation under control. Catalyst type and loading level are critical parameters;
ETPPI at low loading (e.g., 0.070 phr) is typically employed. The following operations are performed in sequence
during processing: LER is heated to 30 ∘C, charged with BPA and ETPPI (short for ethyl triphenyl phosphonium
iodide, a cationic catalyst; refer to Chapter 2) into the reaction tank, and slowly heated to 135 ∘C while agitated;
the external heating is turned off, allowing the exothermic reaction to reach its maximum temperature of ∼174 ∘C;
the system is then cooled to 165 ∘C and held between 165 ∘C and 150 ∘C for 30 minutes before testing resin samples
for EEW (1,250–1,350 g/eq) and viscosity (36,000–66,000 cPs at 150 ∘C and at 75 rpm) and unloading. Continuous
and uniform mixing is necessary.
Streamlining initial operations at an industrial scale (e.g., over 26,000 pounds per batch) is challenging, partic-
ularly for Types 7, 8, and 9 with high-MW and high-EEW grades. Between the first and last out of a batch, EEW
drift (buildup) occurs (due to epoxy homo-polymerization cationically initiated by ETPPI; refer to Chapters 3
and 6). Low-temperature (< 150 ∘C) during the unloading process reduces viscosity drift. However, the relatively
high viscosity of Type 5 tends to require higher discharging temperatures.
Debrief D Oxazolidinones, oxazolidones, oxazolidines, bisoxazolidines, and bis-oxazolines
Prior to subsequent discussions on crosslinkers, curing reactions, and other related topics, it is very worthwhile
to distinguish these chemical compounds based on their chemical structures, reactivities, and potential structural
performance. Oxazolidinones (Figure 1.15a), which contain a carboxyl (C=O) group characteristically observ-
able at 1,749 cm−1 by FTIR, are segmental structures produced by epoxy-isocyanate co-polymerization (refer to
Figure 1.5), compared to isocyanate groups that have a characteristic IR signal at 2,260 cm−1. According to reports
[46], epoxy-functional oxazolidinone prepolymers, essentially isocyanate-modified epoxy resins, are produced by
reacting low-viscosity butanediol di-glycidyl ether (BDDE; e.g., Araldite DY-D from Huntsman Advance Materials;
EEW 118–125 g/eq) with Desmodur VP.PU 1806, an MDI, and/or Desmodur 44V10L, a polymeric MDI (NCO con-
tent 30.5–32.5% by weight), at an epoxy to isocyanate molar ratio of 2.5: 1, and under stirring at 400 rpm and 185 ∘C

Chemical structures of (a) oxazolidinones (also refer to Figure 1.5), (b) hydroxy-functional oxazolidones
re-arranged from glycidyl-functional carbamates (or epoxy-urethanes), (c1/c2) oxazolidines/isoxazolidines, (d) a bis-
oxazolidine with a ﬂexible chain between functional groups, and (e) 1,3-PBO (phenylene bis-oxazoline). Source: (d) adapted

for 1–3 hours. The resulting prepolymers are utilized for coatings. Figure 1.15b depicts a hydroxyl (OH)-functional
oxazolidone, which is structurally substituted on the carbon atom adjacent to nitrogen (as opposed to oxygen, as
in oxazolidinones) and is produced by the thermal re-arrangement of glycidyl-functional carbamate resins; such
oxazolidones can then react with isocyanates through the OH-functional group. Consequently, glycidyl carba-
mates cure faster than conventional aliphatic epoxies [47], while incorporating polyurethane attributes such as
flexibility, toughness, and maybe improved adhesion. In oxazolidines (Figure 1.15c-1), all carbon atoms in the
ring structure are also saturated; in their derivatives, there is always a carbon between the O and N atoms; other-
wise, the molecule is an isoxazolidine (Figure 1.15c-2). Through their NH-functional groups, oxazolidines appear
to readily react with isocyanates and epoxies. There have also been reports of cyclic carbonate dual-functional
(with primary amines) and glycidyl urea resins and their crosslinked polymers as coatings [48, 49]. Figure 4.1c in
Chapter 4 and Figure 9.20b-1 in Chapter 9 illustrate the reactions between cyclic carbonate and diamines that
result in the formation of urethane linkages (–O-CO-NH–).
Bisoxazolidines with two oxazolidine rings serve as di-functional performance modifiers or overall, four-fold
(f = 4, including amines) latent curing agents if employed in polyurethane (PUR) paints and coatings. The choice
of chain linkages between the two oxazolidine rings has a significant effect on the performance when used to cure
isocyanates; specifically, a rigid linking group increases the PUR’s toughness, whereas a flexible linking group, as
shown in Figure 1.15d, imparts flexibility and increases the coating’s elongation. According to studies [50], such
flexible bisoxazolidines enable one-component (1K) PUR formulations that can cure in the presence of moisture
to generate crosslinked coatings. In fact, the structure of bisoxazolidines is similar to that of polyaspartic acid
esters (made from reacting polyamines with a maleate and/or fumarate) containing hindered secondary aliphatic
amines in the backbone, such as Covestro’s Desmophen NH 1520 (100% solids, amino f = 2, and EW-amino 290),
which are utilized to create polyaspartic polyurea (PUA) coatings with corrosion resistance superior to PUR or PUA
alone [51]. Bis-oxazolines, such as 1,3-phenylene bis-oxazoline (abbreviated 1,3-PBO, MW 216.2, Tm 147–151 ∘C,
pKa 4.78 predicted, EW of O-C=N 108.1, Figure 1.15e), in contrast, are di-functional and structurally constituted
of O-C=N groups in each hetero-5-membered ring. With a benzene ring linker between two functional groups,
1,3-PBO can serve as crosslinkers for epoxies (refer to Figure 6.14 and the discussion in Chapter 6) and isocyanates.
Recaps and Highlights
Commodity epoxy resins, or the most widely accessible BPA-based epoxies (also known as DGEBAs), are com-
posed of the BPA-based aromaticity, structural linearity, di-functionality, and aliphatic hydroxyl groups, allowing

24
1 Epoxy Resins, Monomers, and Derivatives
for the fabrication of the most flexible coatings. Structurally defined, the MWs of DGEBAs vary by 284 x n, there-
fore EEWs vary by approximately 142 x n (n = 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, etc.). Medium MW SERs (Types 3, 4, and 5) are
ideal for solvent-free powder coatings, whereas high-MW SERs (Types 7, 8, and 9) are optimal for solvent-borne
can coatings, roofing sheets, and other niche industrial applications. Regardless of di- or multi-functionality, the
relationship between EEWs and MWs applies to all epoxy resins, monomers, and derivatives. Due to the absence of
two methyl groups in an otherwise identical structure to DGEBAs, BPF-based epoxies (also referred to as DGEBFs)
have inferior structural properties such as impaired Tg, flexibility, and toughness compared to DGEBAs, as do
aliphatic epoxies due to their lack of aromaticity. Toughness and flexibility are intrinsically related and derived
from the cohesive modulus development of coatings during curing. For the formulation of coatings resistant to
strong acids, novolac epoxies and DGEBFs are preferred over DGEBAs.
Isocyanate-modified BPA-based epoxies are superior to multi-functional (matrix) epoxy resins or monomers
when it comes to formulating coatings with high Tgs exceeding 200 ∘C, as well as excellent cohesive toughness
(e.g., impact resistance) and flexibility. Modifications result in the formation of oxazolidinones and/or isocyanu-
rates, depending on the curing conditions (such as the interaction temperature and the stoichiometric ratio of
epoxies to isocyanates). Individually or in combination, other modified or specialty epoxy resins and monomers
exhibit exceptional structural performance in terms of adhesion, modulus, flexibility, impermeability, and dielec-
tric properties, among others. Specialty epoxy monomers with even di-functionality, such as those based on highly
aromatic fluorenyl cardo (refer to Tables 1.2b/c) or phthalide cardo (refer to Table 1.2d) groups, are capable of
generating high Tg up to 250 ∘C for outstanding heat resistance, filling the Tg gap of epoxy systems between 200
and 250 ∘C via a physical effect of additional macromolecular entanglements in the cured network. Superior to
poly-functional epoxy grades of similarly low MWs and EEWs, fluorene-based epoxy monomers tend to improve
other essential properties such as adhesion, flexibility, toughness, and impermeable barrier, all in a one-pot system
(refer to Subsection 6.2.7 in Chapter 6). Aliphatic and alicyclic epoxies, especially hydrogenated grades, react
more slowly with traditional curing chemicals than aromatic epoxies, but they cure very quickly via UV-induced
cationic polymerization, making them ideal for applications such as clearcoats on non-anionic surfaces and sub-
strates. Under catalysis, the ring-opening reactions of oxetanes by, for instance, amines or active esters generate not
only secondary but also primary aliphatic hydroxyl groups, which can be utilized to expedite the UV-curing process
of aliphatic epoxies. In addition to carboxyl acid-curable GMAs as valuable additions to epoxy resin technology,
di-f and multi-f vinyl esters with grafted C=C functional groups constitute a significant class of film-forming
epoxy derivatives that can be crosslinked through acid, base, or thiol catalysis at ambient or elevated tempera-
tures. Non-BPA epoxies with comparable performance (adhesion, acid- and moisture-resistance, etc.) are gaining
popularity for sustainable food packaging applications that are currently dominated by high-type DGEBAs and
modified grades.
Physical and intermolecular hydrophobicity, as well as chemical and intramolecular polarity, are crucial to the
dielectric performance and long-term moisture and corrosion resistance of cured epoxy resins or monomers for
a variety of applications. In addition to qualitative structures, the MW, EEW, functionality, catalysis (refer to
Section 2.2 in Chapter 2), and FI (refer to Section 4.2 in Chapter 4) are important quantitative factors that
determine the formulation and performance of epoxy coating products.
This chapter attempted to update the epoxy resins, monomers, oligomers, and prepolymers that are of the
greatest interest and value to coating formulations, but it is impossible to cover all of them because epoxy resin
technology is constantly evolving and new innovations are introduced over time. Without limiting to theory, the
structure-property relationships of epoxy systems are highly dependent on the structural morphology (e.g., steric-
ity), MWs, EEWs, and functionality of uncured resins, monomers, and derivatives at the molecular level, the
formulation parameters, such as the FI, catalyst type, and loading, as well as cure schedules. Essential to the
superior cured overall performance of functional epoxy coatings are molecular aromaticity and macroscopic film
formation. In other words, the technical vitality surrounding epoxy resins, which is based on molecular aromaticity

and film formation, is increasingly focusing on modifications, specialties, and hybrids that embrace synergisti-
cally unique and enhanced performance while allowing compatibility with other functional constituents. Epoxy
resins cannot be recycled once they have cured; however, carbon fibers from carbon-fiber-reinforced (epoxy)
composites/polymers (CFRECs or CFRPs; refer to Table 10.4 in Chapter 10) can be recycled using mechanical
and pyrolysis degradation methods, as well as newly developed ionic liquids [52, 53]. Epoxy vitrimers, includ-
ing those derived from biomaterials [54, 55], are reformable and recyclable, as are phosphonated epoxy-based
thermosets [56] and epoxy vitrimer adhesives [57].

Epoxy Curing Agents
As previously stated, epoxy curing agents, also terminologically known as curatives, include both crosslinkers and
catalysts. Crosslinkers and hardening agents are essentially identical, whereas catalysts and accelerators may dif-
fer. For example, it is acceptable to refer to a primary or a secondary amine as a curing agent because they possess
autocatalytic effects after reacting to form tertiary amines; however, it may be inappropriate to refer to pheno-
lic resins as curing agents because they are merely hardeners without autocatalytic properties. Nonetheless, it is
not unusual for curing agents, curatives, and crosslinkers to be used interchangeably on occasion. Monomers,
oligomers, resins, and prepolymers as epoxy crosslinkers are abundantly available from a vast array of materials,
ranging from primarily basic and modified amines such as amine adducts, polyamides, dihydrazides, polyamines
(aromatic, aliphatic, and cycloaliphatic), and Mannich bases (i.e., 𝛽-amino-ketones), to phenyl hydroxyls (Ph-OH)
including various phenolic resins, to organic acids and anhydrides, to active esters, to secondarily polysulfides (Sn),
mercaptans or thiols (SH), to isocyanates (NCO), and occasionally hydroxyl-functional silicones under appropri-
ate catalyzation. Without being constrained by theory, epoxies are so adaptable as a reactive binder that they can
be crosslinked by acids, bases, esters, etc. In applied epoxy coating and adhesive products, anionic polyamines
such as polyamides and weakly cationic phenolics such as BPA-based phenolic resins are likely the most preva-
lent and widely employed curatives or crosslinkers. Epoxy-crosslinker reactions involve the opening of an epoxide
ring and the subsequent co-polymerization of the two dissimilar molecules; these crosslinking agents differentiate
themselves in performance, including reactivity, as ultimately determined by their chemical structures, equivalent
weights (EWs), functionalities, and molecular weights (MWs).
2.1
Crosslinkers or Hardeners
2.1.1
Primary and secondary amines
Primary (−NH2, 1∘), secondary (−NH−, 2∘), and tertiary (>N−, 3∘) amines are Lewis bases and lone-pair donors.
To avoid conceptual ambiguities, 3∘-amines serving as epoxy curing catalysts are re-grouped separately from
1∘- and 2∘-amines serving only as epoxy crosslinkers in this chapter. Specifically, and in an aspect, a primary (1∘)
amine with two reactive hydrogens and a secondary (2∘) amine with one are regarded as regular nucleophilic
hardeners for curing epoxies twice and once, respectively, in relation to stepwise epoxy-amine co-polymerization
(Figure 2.1a). Aside from this, upon completion of crosslinking epoxies, both 1∘- and 2∘-amines convert to
3∘-amines and subsequently act as active catalysts for epoxy homo-polymerization or homo-cures (Figure 2.1b).
In the sense of being ultimately autocatalytic, 1∘- and 2∘-amines are referred to interchangeably as curing agents
or curatives, whereas other epoxy curing agents without intrinsic autocatalytic effects are referred to exclusively
as epoxy hardeners or crosslinkers.
In terms of reactivity, a key parameter for determining the efficacy of a crosslinker, primary (1∘) amine-reacting
powers (e.g., the ability to crosslink epoxies) are generally ranked from highest to lowest as follows: aliphatic

(relative rate constant, or Krel = 13.6) > cycloaliphatic (Krel = 11.0) > aromatic (aniline’s Krel = 1.00) [1]; the
sequences of reactivity are functionally and structurally driven by the nucleophilicity of amines, in stark contrast
to the reactivity of epoxy functions (aromatic epoxies are always more reactive than aliphatic ones), which relies
on the electrophilicity of epoxides (or glycidyls or oxiranes). In addition, 1∘-amines react roughly twice as fast as
2∘-amines. When it comes to typical and preferred 1∘- and 2∘-amines as epoxy crosslinkers, it is difficult to avoid
DICY (i.e., dicyandiamide, Figure 2.2a), which is essentially an amide-amine [2], as it is the most widely used
curative or curing agent across a wide range of epoxy-based platforms, from 1/2K liquid (solvent-borne) to 1K
paste to 1K powder. DICY (MW 84.0, Tm 208 ∘C, FTIR fingerprint signals at 2,180 cm−1) is physically white, solid
(preferably micronized powders ≤10 μm in particle size for industrial applications, such as AlzChem’s Dyhard
100S and Evonik’s Amicure CG-1200), soluble in water but requiring heat and/or severe mixing to dissolve in
certain industrial solvents (such as PM and NMP). With a theoretical equivalent weight of 21.0 g/eq (i.e., 4-fold
crosslinking in terms of a pair of reactive −NH2 groups), DICY is also chemically aliphatic, latent (due partially to
its high-melting point Tm), and autocatalytic (consisting initially of 3∘-amines and following crosslinking reactions
of −NH2 twice). The nitrile group (−CN) is said to react with −OH groups at elevated temperatures, resulting in the
formation of amides (−NH−CO−, FTIR at 1,690 cm−1) and catalytic 5-fold crosslinking [3]. Biguanide (MW 101.1,
Tm 135 ∘C, Figure 2.2b) possesses seven NH functionalities and is expected to have a lower curing temperature and
greater crosslinking capacity than DICY.
Representative amino-curing monomers, adducts, or resins consisting of at least one 1∘- or 2∘-amine that read-
ily react with epoxies once (if 2∘-amines) or twice (if 1∘-amines) before transforming into a tertiary amine catalyst
are depicted in Figure 2.2. In one respect, all listed dihydrazides (Figure 2.2c and Table 2.1) are latent, aliphatic
(indicating color stability over time) except for IDH (Table 2.1g), and tetra-functional in terms of the number of
reactive amino-hydrogens. The majority of these dihydrazides feature a linear CH2 chain in their backbone struc-
tures (Tables 2.1a/b/c/e/f) that supposedly confer flexibility. ADH, that is, adipic dihydrazide (e.g., fine powders
from Otsuka Chemical), is widely used as a latent curing agent in numerous applications, such as waterborne
latexes and epoxy powder coatings. SDH, or sebacic dihydrazide (e.g., fine powders less than 10 μm from Otsuka
Chemical), is effective in the formulation of high-performance FBE (fusion bonded epoxy) rebar coatings [4]. Par-
ticularly, VDH (Table 2.1d) is capable of low-cure onset due to its 120 ∘C melting point, which is advantageous
for formulating low-temperature application (LAT) powder coatings desired for wood finishing (refer to LAT in
Chapter 6) and other specialty applications such as adhesives and sealants [5]. In dihydrazides, the 2∘-NH adjacent
to the 1∘-NH2 is not reactive. In another respect, dihydrazides crosslink isocyanates to produce polyurea and cure

acrylics through rapid Michael Addition reactions involving amines and vinyls. Dihydrazides and DICY are both
primary amines; consequently, DICY catalysts and accelerators are also applicable to dihydrazides. Poly-functional
keto-hydrazides, such as oxalyl difunctional (m = 2 and n = 0 in Table 2.1h), are utilized as an epoxy curing agent
in aqueous latex systems, per a patent [6].
Back to Figure 2.2, trifunctional primary amines (Figure 2.2d) and similar compounds tend to accelerate cur-
ing and increase crosslinking density, or Tg. HexatranTM from Ascend Performance Materials is such an aliphatic
amine curing agent for both epoxies and isocyanates. Typically liquid, polyamides (−CO-NH−) consist of multi-
ple reactive amides; importantly, some polyamides readily transform into imidazolines, a type of tertiary amine
(Figure 2.2e) that are well known for their catalytic properties, such as imidazoles, that is, cyclic amines. In other
words, polyamides are reactive toward epoxies because they contain both amide and imidazole bonds. Polyamides
are one of the most popular curing agents for 2K liquid epoxies of 100% solids that can cure at ambient tempera-
ture or even lower, whereas amines such as DICY are preferred for 1K solvent-based liquid and powder coatings
that are typically cured at elevated temperatures. The majority of 2K liquid epoxy patch products for pipelines and
tanks are formulated with polyamides (e.g., Evonik’s Ancamide® and many others). Moreover, Ancamide 2832 and
2864 are examples of modified polyamides with rapid through cure and excellent blush resistance at both room
temperature and low temperatures (5 ∘C). The BCA P310 from Brenntag is a solid or semi-solid polyamide used
as an epoxy curing agent. As depicted in Figure 2.3, aromatic polyamides are reported to react with epoxides via
polyaddition and an insertion reaction in terms of cure chemistry. When, for example, imidazoles are used as cata-
lysts [7], the insertion reaction takes place most easily. In contrast to amines, which cure quickly but tend to blush
in moist conditions, amides are slower curing but favorably more surface tolerant and less affected by moisture.
Structurally symmetric 4,4′-DDS (EW-NH 62.0, Tm 148 ∘C, Figure 2.2f) and asymmetric SAA (EW-NH 43.0, Tm
165 ∘C, Figure 2.2g) are aromatic, 4-fold functional by active hydrogens, and are also optional curatives for LCERs
(liquid crystalline epoxy resins). Asymmetry permits spatial orientations in polymer backbones that disrupt crys-
tallinity in an exclusive way to reduce the melting point and Tg. Amine adducts (Figure 2.2h), that is, oligomers
derived from BPA-based epoxies reacting with excessive primary amines under controlled conditions, contain both
1∘- and 2∘-amines in their molecular structures that readily crosslink epoxies (refer to Figure 2.1a), ultimately
leading to tertiary amines that, once again, catalyze epoxy-epoxy homo-polymerization (refer to Figure 2.1b).
Therefore, amine adducts (MWs vary, Tm 85–105 ∘C) consisting of both 1∘- and 2∘-amines are frequently used as a
co-crosslinker and/or co-catalyst (when an imidazole is added), allowing for improved blush resistance and more
consistent control of gel and cure times than bulk amines. As modified amines, ketimines (e.g., Ancamine 2458
from Evonik and Curamine 33-672 from Britrez), composed of 2∘- and 3∘-amines, are typically aliphatic liquids
and latently absorb moisture to re-generate 1∘-amines (Figure 2.2i) for fast-curing epoxies at ambient temperature,
enabling, for example, the rapid return to service floor coatings. Epikure 3502 from Hexion/Westlake is a ketimine
adduct. All these relatively representative amines and derivatives in Figure 2.2, with the exception of polyamides,
exhibit latency, indicating their suitability for 1K or B-staged liquid and powder formulations. In addition, in terms
of LAT epoxy powder coatings, solid amine hardeners, such as dihydrazides excluding IDH (due to a higher Tm
than DICY), are the preferred curing agents, subject to practical validation.
Furthermore, formulators have access to a large number of specialty 1∘- and 2∘-amines as epoxy curing agents
for achieving unique and/or enhanced structural performance, such as flexibility, hydrophobicity, dirt repellence,
reactivity upon thermal activation, and latency when not thermally activated, as listed in Table 2.2. Specifically, and

first, the corrosive liquid AEP (Table 2.2a) represents an amine curative that combines a 1∘, a 2∘, and a 3∘-amino
function in one molecule. OTB (Table 2.2b) is essentially a modified DICY consisting of both 1∘- and 2∘-amines
with EW-NH at 31.9 g/eq, nearly identical to that of DICY; commercial grades are abundant, including Aradur 2844
from Huntsman and Dyhard OTB from AlzChem, respectively. Phenalkamines (i.e., Mannich reaction of cardanol,
formaldehyde, and specific amines, Table 2.2c) enable extremely fast and low-temperature (even below 0 ∘C) cure,
which is highly desired by, for example, floor coatings; they also share the advantages of Mannich base curatives
in addition to their high hydrophobicity. Liquid phenalkamines are a new class of epoxy curing agents with dual
amino- and phenyl hydroxyl (Ph-OH)-functional groups, similar to Mannich bases (to be categorized into phe-
nolics later). They are typically derived from natural cardanols such as extracted cashew nutshell liquids (CNSL).
Commonly used as soap antioxidants, methylenebis (2-ethyl-6-methylanilines) (e.g., Versalink P-1000 and the like,
Table 2.2d) and poly(tetramethylene, 3-methyltetramethylene ether)glycol bis(4-aminobenzoate) (Table 2.2e) with
an elongated linear chain between amino-functions are expected to confer additional flexibility to cured coating
films. Polyetherdiamines (Table 2.2f) of high MWs and EW-NHs in addition to a linear backbone (e.g., Dyneon
HC1101 from 3M) are a paste and primary amine functional as an epoxy curative, ostensibly enhancing flexibility
and toughness; however, incompatibility and processing difficulty must be properly addressed.
TPTDA (Table 2.2g) is an amine curing agent with a sulfone-nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring, according
to Ghaemy et al. [9]. BAF (Table 2.2h) introduces a fluorene (not “fluorinated”)-based bulky but rotary blocks
(i.e., highly aromatic fluorenyl cardo groups) into the cured epoxy-amine skeleton, imparting superior toughness,
hydrophobicity, and flexibility. For example, and surprisingly, a highly flexible FBE rebar coating has been
innovatively formulated using BAF instead of aliphatic SDH or conventional phenolics, exhibiting improved
toughness in support of minimizing micro-tears during cold (−45 ∘C) bending (refer to Chapter 6 for details).
Silicone-modified amines (e.g., Dowsil 3055 resins, Table 2.2i) and other amine-terminated silicone resins (e.g.,
SH-120, -180, -240, and -300, where the numbers denote amine hydrogen equivalent weight or AHEW, Biro Tech-
nologies) afford synergy of epoxy-silicone hybrid networks upon cure (Figure 2.4); nonetheless, incompatibility is
observed to result in porosity and deterioration of film integrity, similar to issues observed with silicone-modified
epoxies. Fluorinated (not “fluorene”) amines (e.g., Bis-A-AF, Table 2.2j) are highly hydrophobic and are therefore
anticipated to improve chemical and moisture-resistant performance; likewise, fluorinated epoxies (e.g., jER
YX-7760, EEW 238, Bis-A-AF type; Mitsubishi Chemical) from Chapter 1 have been shown to exhibit superior
adhesion but are difficult to process (e.g., spray and fluidized bed) as FBE powder coatings. Intriguingly, the
recently developed bis-diazirine (Table 2.2k) is touted as a universal curing agent for all polymers [10], including
epoxies, polyurethane, and cyanoacrylate. Under heat or UV light, diazirines produce highly reactive carbenes that
undergo insertion reactions with any of the C—H, O—H, and N—H bonds [11] (refer to Debrief C in Chapter
3). Xlynx Materials (https://xlynxmaterials.com/) offers commercial bis-diazirine-derived products, such as
photo- and thermally curable PlastiLynx© and BondLynx©. However, their performance in applied formulations
remains to be fully investigated. A vast array of amine curing agents are used as pharmaceutical raw materials
or intermediates, and a great deal more are searchable on websites such as www.trc-canada.com (Toronto
Research Chemicals) and Actylis.com, to name a few. BCl3•DMOA (dimethyl octylamine, similar to BF3•amine

functionally diverse amines (either primary, secondary, tertiary, or a combination of amino groups) that deserve
investigation by attentive formulators for their suitability and performance in specific or situational liquid or
powder formulations and end applications.
2.1.2
Phenolics and polyphenols
Stepwise epoxy ring-opening co-polymerization also takes place with non-amine curatives, including phenolics,
anhydrides, and/or isocyanates, under heat and/or catalyzation. Specifically, viable amine-free crosslinkers
include, but are not limited to, phenolics, active esters, anhydrides, organic acids, polysulfides, isocyanates, and
hydroxyl-functional silicones, typically in the presence of an anionic tertiary amine or imidazole as a catalyst,
as these hardeners have much lower nucleophilicity than amines, as selectively illustrated in Table 2.3, where
simplified cure reactions are demonstrated. In the next chapter, the principal cure reactions are described in
greater detail.
There are a few notable patterns or characteristics observable for the curatives compiled in Table 2.3. First,
all cure reactions result in the formation of secondary-aliphatic OH groups, with the exception of active phenyl
esters and anhydrides, which produce new ester bonds. On the one hand, these newly formed OHs, if any, can
further react with epoxides at elevated temperatures to give rise to polyamides. These OHs create intra-molecular
H-bonding to promote cohesion and intermolecular H-bonding at the interface of metal substrates to enhance
adhesion. The elimination of polar OHs in the cured network, on the other hand, improves dielectric properties
such as higher dielectric strength and a lower dielectric constant that are suitable for use in electronic applica-
tions. Second, BPA-based epoxies, or DGEBAs, are essentially glycidyl ethers that generate secondary-aliphatic
OHs when cured by such crosslinkers as phenolics, acids, and thiols, among others. In stark contrast, glycidyl
esters, when selectively and conditionally cured (depending on temperature, type of acids, ratio of the acid to the
ester, and presence of catalysts), for example, by methacrylic acid (MAA), result in primary (1∘) aliphatic OHs
(Figure 2.5a) [12, 13] that are more reactive toward crosslinking isocyanates, thereby providing a fast and easy
method for developing APOS (aliphatic polyols)-based waterborne coatings without or with low VOC. Commer-
cial glycidyl ester liquids include, for instance, the mono-functional Cardura E10P, the difunctional Epikote Resin
760 (EEW 176) from Hexion/Westlake, and the equivalent di-f Denacol FCA-640 (EEW 164) from Nagase. Reich-
hold’s Epotuf 608 (EEW 250), a similar oxirane ester product designed for 2K epoxy-polyester (COOH-functional)
systems, in which secondary-aliphatic OHs are typically formed. Similarly, as an alternative to 2K solvent-borne
liquids reported for automotive clearcoats [14], glycidyl ester/COOH powder coatings formulated with GMAs
(glycidyl methacrylate acids) such as AC2710 (powder, EEW 300–350, King Industries) are cured by multiple
carboxyl-functional acrylic resins such as Joncryl 819 (solid, EW-COOH 148, BASF) at 100 ∘C for 30 minutes,
under cationic catalysis at 1.0 phr, and via oxirane ring-opening condensation, generating stable ester linkages
along with typical secondary OHs with greatly enhanced crosslinking density and chemical resistance, as illus-
trated in Figure 2.5b. Almatex PD-6300 GMA acrylic (EEW 535, Tm 60 ∘C, Anderson Development Company)
and comparable resins are competitive for clear powder coatings intended for indoor and outdoor applications.
Dodecanedioic acid (DDDA for short, pKa 5.70, Tm 130 ∘C, Figure 2.5c) is a dibasic acid (COOH-functional) that

uid) and −614B (EEW 173, water-soluble liquid) from Nagase ChemteX are tetra-functional aliphatic glycidyl
ethers proposed as NISO alternatives for 2K SB and WB coatings cured ambiently by COOH-functional acrylics,
respectively.
However, GMA-based coatings may spread contamination, causing undesirable craters on other products if
production equipment is shared. Lastly, note that glycidyl esters (Figure 2.5) are epoxide functional as opposed
to vinyl esters or epoxy vinyl ester prepolymers (refer to Figures 1.12c/d in Chapter 1), which are vinyl (C=C

between epoxy and acrylic acids, such as methyl acrylic acids (MAA), and represent a class of liquid, low-MW
binder resins for 2K composite and coating applications.
Regarding latent phenolic resins as epoxy crosslinkers, there are a variety of grades, such as resole, novolac, and
BPA-derived, in a liquid or powder form, for a vast array of industrial applications, ranging from food packaging
to functional coatings. In-depth coverage of phenolics and relevant coatings as a contingent topic will be provided
in Chapter 7. Having reactive phenyl hydroxyl (Ph-OH) groups, phenolics are weakly acidic but stronger than
aliphatic OHs to react with epoxides at elevated temperatures (Table 2.3a), with the reaction being substantially
accelerated in the presence of a catalyst or initiator, such as tertiary amines or imidazoles. As shown in Figure 2.6,
commercial phenolic resins include, but are not limited to, the following: i) polyvinyl-based (derived from
4-PVP via free-radical reactions, Figure 2.6a), ii) resole (base catalyzed and HCHO in excess), iii) novolac (acid
catalyzed, phenol in excess), and iv) BPA/epoxy-derived (BPA in excess). Resoles and novolacs are structurally
(ortho-, meta-, and para-substituted) and functionally (Ph-OH) identical. With the exception of the presence of

methylol (CH2—O—CH2) linkages in resoles but not in novolacs. Instead, BPA-based phenolics are exclusively
para-structured, thereby imparting flexibility. In addition, resoles (Figure 2.6b) and novolacs (Figure 2.6c) are typ-
ically liquid, butylated, and brunched with both ortho- and para-structures, that is, they are not necessarily linear
like BPA-based grades (Figure 2.3d). Regarding Ph-OH functionality, the BPA-based solid resins are bifunctional
(f = 2), whereas the other three are obviously multi-functional. Taking equivalent weights (EW-PhOH or H.E.W.)
into account, the H.E.W. of the polyvinyl-based resoles and novolacs range from approximately 104 to 140, as
each substituted phenol (MW ∼120) is reactive. In contrast, the difunctional BPA-based phenolics accommodate
a broad range of EW-PhOH from 250 up to 710 based on MWs (i.e., linear chain extension), making them the
preferred crosslinkers for FBE powder coatings utilized in pipeline, rebar, and valve applications.
Commercial grades of phenolic resins include Lyncure M (H.E.W. 120, Tm ∼90 ∘C, Maruka or Maruzen Petro-
chemical) as a narrow MWD-controlled polyvinyl-based phenolic suitable for copper clad laminates (CCL) and
prepregs, Bakelite 6535 (H.E.W. 140, 64.2% solids, Hexion), Phenodur EP 560 (H.E.W. ∼140, 71% solids, All-
nex), GPRI 7590 (H.E.W. ∼140, 60% solids, Georgia-Pacific Chemical) as a resole for, for example, food packaging

coatings, and GP 2074 (H.E.W. 104, Georgia-Pacific Chemical) as a novolac, among others. GP BKR-2620 (H.E.W.
130–150, softening point 82–99 ∘C, Georgia-Pacific) is a solid version of resole phenolic resins, but it contains over
10% of free phenol that is directly reactive with epoxies to generate low-MW fragments and is, therefore, con-
cerned. Kukdo Chemical’s KD-405 (H.E.W. 250), KD-427 (H.E.W. 380), and KD-448 (H.E.W. 700) are BPA-based
phenolic hardeners that are direct substitutes for DEH-85, DEH-87, and DEH-8X from Olin, respectively. Please
be advised that Curaphen 22-506 (H.E.W. 250, Britrez), DEH-84, and KD-404J are all BPA-based phenolic equiva-
lents, each containing approximately 2.5% of 2-MI as a catalyst. Notably, eugenol (liquid, MW 164.2, Figure 2.6e) is
a natural phenolic substance; however, due to the mono-functionality of Ph-OH, it cannot crosslink epoxies unless
the vinyl group (i.e., the carbon-carbon double bond) is concurrently activated. Since vinyl-functional acrylics are
capable of undergoing a Michael Addition reaction with an amine to significantly accelerate curing, this strategy
is entirely feasible. Within the scope of applied microencapsulation, Michael Addition will be discussed in detail
in Chapter 8 of microencapsulation. As reported by Shibata et al. and Kalita et al. [16, 17], the transformations
of eugenol into bismaleimides (cyclic vinyl), that is, BMIs, and poly (vinyl ethers) represent novel and ingenious
transformation efforts. As described in Chapters 7 and 9, BMI is known to readily self-crosslink or be cured by
either amines or ortho-substituted Ph-OHs.
In addition, as shown in Table 2.4, numerous specialty phenolic monomers, resins, and pre-polymers are also
commercially available for formulators to choose from in order to address specific performance requirements such
as flexibility, toughness, heat resistance, and barrier properties. Specifically, due to their rigid structures, epoxy
hardeners with difunctional biphenyl phenolic resins such as Kayahard GPH-103 (Table 2.4a) and tri-functional
grades such as TP-VG100 (Table 2.4b) are suitable for high Tg and tough crosslinking. PPO (PPE), such as Noryl®
SA-90 (EW-PhOH 840), is aromatically unique and bulkily linear with a high MW. Unexpectedly, powder coat-
ings formulated with this hardener and a novolac epoxy resin at a molar ratio of 1: 1.05 produced dual Tgs at
114.3 ∘C and 162.5 ∘C, both of which were equally significant, but resulted in flaking films, that is, poor flexibility,
toughness, or integrity. Inferior flexibility is also observed for other curatives such as aliphatic Dyneon HC1101
(an amine; refer to Table 2.2f) and PA-18 (a polyanhydride; refer to Figure 2.9a) and even for binder resins such
as phenoxy epoxies (refer to Figure 1.12b in Chapter 1), indicating that excessively high MW, EW, or excessively
long linear chains are not always advantageous for high-performance formulations. Similar to their amine- and
epoxide-functional counterparts (refer to Tables 2.2h and 1.2b/c in Chapter 1, respectively), fluorene-based phe-
nolic monomers with highly aromatic fluorenyl cardo groups (Table 2.4d) performed exceptionally well in FBE
systems in terms of superior toughness as indicated by impact resistance up to a maximum of 160 lb-in, unri-
valed adhesion as indicated by passing HWA at 95 ∘C and a three-phase autoclave at 177 ∘C and 3500 psi for 24
hours, and outstanding moisture barrier or impermeability as indicated by low hot water uptake after 28 days at
95 ∘C [18]. When properly formulated, PPP-BP with a phthalide cardo group (Table 2.4e) as a phenolic crosslinker
for epoxies behaved comparably to fluorene crosslinkers due to their steric yet flexible structures, which amplify
structure-property relationships at certain points. Detailed results will be reported in Chapter 6.
In addition, melamine-modified phenolic resins as epoxy hardeners are multi-functional, for example, 5-fold
as shown in Figure 2.7a [19], which is anticipated to greatly increase crosslinking density for heat resistance and
probably toughness for wear and crack resistance, both of which are important parameters for certain indus-
trial applications, such as automotive friction pads. Sumitomo Bakelite’s Sumiliteresin® PR-X19160 is one of these
phenolic-functional melamine resins. Particularly, phosphorus epoxy resins cured with melamine phenolics sup-
posedly achieve synergic flame retardancy. Furthermore, benzoxazines (BOXs) constitute a distinct subclass of
Ph-OH-functional crosslinkers. BOXs undergo cationic ring-opening self-crosslinking thermally to generate a hard
but brittle PBZ (polybenzoxazines) matrix rich in freshly formed phenyl hydroxyls (Ph-OHs) that readily cure epox-
ies under heat and/or catalysis. Experiments reveal that epoxy-cured BOXs improve toughness, but at the expense
of Tg, which decreases from approximately 185–190 ∘C to 115 ∘C (refer to Figure 7.13a in Chapter 7), for example.
BOX formulations and performance will be described alongside phenolic resins in Chapter 7, with an emphasis
on the roles played by their structures and compositions in the performance of polymer systems.

Figure 2.8
Illustration of partial structures of (a) wood-derived lignin, which consists of p-coumaryl, coniferyl, and sinapyl
alcohols (bottom right) as the major structural units; and (b) tannin, which contains tannin acids (bottom right) as the major
structural units.
Bio-based polyphenols are predominantly lignins [20–22], which may also contain aliphatic OHs (Figure 2.8a),
tannins, also known as polyflavonoids (Figure 2.8b) [23], consisting exclusively of Ph-OHs, and their derivatives
such as fractions of monomeric carbohydrates (e.g., glucoses, sucrose, etc.) [24] that are rich in aliphatic OHs.
On the one hand, because phenols are tri-functional, the ortho-, meta-, and para-positions can be substituted
with formaldehyde (HCHO) prior to condensation to generate resinous substances with methylene ether linkages
or methylene bridges while releasing water. In contrast, the MWs and amounts of Ph-OH groups of a polyphe-
nol molecule have a substantial effect on its properties. By utilizing the multiple Ph-OHs on the structures of
polyphenols, lignin-phenol glyoxal adhesives for plywood and fiberboard are developed, as are tannin-derived
NIPU wood adhesives capable of curing at low temperatures, as reported [25–27]. HCHO and glyoxal are the
smallest molecules of mono- and difunctional aldehydes, respectively, and are advantageous for the development
of optional NISO/NIPU coatings (refer to Figures 3.11d/8.8 in Chapters 3/8, respectively) and acid-catalyzed
UF/MF/UMF polymers (refer to Figure 8.3a in Chapter 8).
2.1.3
Active esters
Active phenyl esters (Table 2.3b), which are unrelated to amines, behave as epoxy crosslinkers in a manner remark-
ably similar to that of phenolics, with the exception that the active hydrogen in Ph-OH is replaced by a partial
ester function. Crosslinking processes produce a new ester linkage rather than a secondary hydroxyl. Because
the elimination of polar OHs during cure reduces moisture affinity and eliminates branching sites for subsequent
reactions, this tiny structural difference may have a substantial effect on the cured film’s dielectric characteris-
tics. Indeed, improvements in bulk dielectric strength, or voltage breakdown, and moisture absorption are widely
desired by electrical and electronic components such as copper and aluminum busbars for robust AC/DC power
control and conversion in the automotive and electronics industries. Until activation, active phenyl esters are
more dormant (or less reactive) than their corresponding phenolics and are catalyzed similarly by tertiary amines
or imidazoles. Formulations and characterization of active esters in contrast to amine curing agents and pheno-
lic hardeners of epoxies can be found in an associated section of Chapter 6. Active phenyl ester products on the
market include, among others, aromatic HPC-8000 (solid flakes after solvent purging, EW-ester 225, Tm > 150 ∘C,
DIC/Sun Chemicals), aromatic SHC-5900 (solid flakes after solvent purging, EW-ester 223, Tm > 150 ∘C, Shin-A

T&C), and aliphatic EC-312 in a powder form (EW-ester 163, Tm 93 ∘C, Designer Molecules), where “aromatic”
and “aliphatic” correspond to the R’ segment in the molecular structure, as shown in Table 2.3b. As depicted in
Figure 2.7b, a cyclic boric acid ester (liquid, MW 241.9) is reported by Yamamoto and Daikai [28] as a latent epoxy
hardener as well.
2.1.4
Mannich bases
In accordance with Table 2.3, Mannich bases are typically categorized as modified amines. In terms of their molec-
ular structure, this class of liquid epoxy curing agents is closely connected to both phenolics and amines, as they
are essentially phenol-modified amines or amine-modified phenols (Tables 2.3a/c). It should be introduced imme-
diately after the phenolic-curative discussion. Obviously, phenalkamines (Table 2.2c) are Mannich base deriva-
tives that maintain not only Ph-OH but also a few amine functions, as mentioned previously. Notably, Mannich
bases refer to phenols with ortho-substitutions that are structurally comparable to resole- or novolac-phenolics
(Figures 2.6b/c) and ring-opened BOXs or PBZ. In other words, Mannich bases, including phenalkamines, can
crosslink vinyls, including cyclic vinyls such as bismaleimides (BMIs), resulting in hetero-6-membered rings via a
Diels−Alder reaction pathway (refer to Chapter 7 for details). From the standpoint of phenol-substituted amines,
Mannich bases reduce the functionality of the amine, whereas the presence of the phenolic hydroxyl function-
ality at an orthoposition substantially accelerates epoxy-amine crosslinking reactions. Consequently, Mannich
bases cure epoxies rapidly at low temperatures (35−45 ∘F), making them one of the most preferred curatives for
applications such as floor coatings and clearcoats that require low-temperature cure (< 50 ∘F for liquid coatings)
and yellowing resistance. Mannich bases, which include phenalkamines, are advantageously more compatible
with epoxy resins than unmodified alkylene amines and are more resistant to water spots and blushing. It is well
known that primary amines react with ambient carbon dioxide and water to produce carbamates, which can lead
to the surface and cause blush [29]. The formation of blush (also known as blooming or exudate) has detrimental
effects on coating performance, including a decrease in gloss, an increase in yellowing, and poor recoatability (i.e.,
inter-coat adhesion). Commercial Mannich bases used as epoxy curing agents include, among others, Epikure 185
and 197 (EW-NH 110 and 75, respectively, Hexion).
2.1.5
Anhydrides and carboxylic acids
Still referring to Table 2.3, anhydrides, and particularly high-MW polyanhydrides such as PA-18 (MW 20,000 to
50,000, Tm 110–140 ∘C, EW-anhydride 351, Figure 2.9a) from Chevron Phillips Specialty Chemicals, among others
such as PMDA (i.e., pyromellitic dianhydride), have elevated melting points and decreased solubility in epoxies,

2.1 Crosslinkers or Hardeners

which make it difficult to disperse or homogenize, for example, in powder coating extruding processes. Anhydrides
cure epoxy typically under the catalysis of a cationic agent due to improved compatibility or of a tertiary amine
(such as DMAP or 4-dimethylaminopyridine), generating new ester linkages and without hydroxyls (Table 2.3d),
making them appropriate for acid-resistant applications. For example, Neximid 300 (phenylethyl trimellitic anhy-
dride, or PETA, MW 276.2, Tm 167 ∘C) from Nexam Chemical enables curing of epoxies below 190 ∘C in the
presence of a catalyst; otherwise, curing cannot proceed unless temperatures reach 190−230 ∘C. SMAs (styrene
maleic anhydrides, Figure 2.9b) are poly-anhydride-functional (depending on MWs) co-polymers and latent epoxy
curatives, such as SMA 3000 (MW 3800, Tm ∼125 ∘C) from Cray Valley and Xiran® SZ08250 (SMA granules) from
Polyscope Polymer for low-gloss powder coatings. Formulations with a SMA as the crosslinker can be catalyzed
by, for example, DMAP. Notably, di-f maleic anhydrides (containing a cyclic C=C bond like BMIs, Figure 2.9c),
including Nadic methyl anhydride or NMA (liquid, EW-anhydride 178.2 g/eq), undergo a Diels−Alder reaction
with active methylene or methine compounds such as malonate or acetoacetate esters in the presence of a sodium
acetate catalyst [30], as well as with resole- and novolac-phenolics under a cationic catalyst (refer to Chapter 7
for more details). Supposedly, siloxinated anhydrides (e.g., Gelest’s DMS-Z21, Figure 2.9d) as epoxy crosslinkers
improve adhesion to polycarbonates and other surfaces (with bonding strength measured at almost 0 mil conical
bend) upon curing at 120 ∘C and higher.
In regard to carboxylic acid crosslinkers, epoxy/carboxyl (COOH)-functional polyester hybrids, and particularly
TGIC/COOH-functional polyester durable (UV resistant) systems, including their powder and liquid coatings,
are representative formulations and products where COOH-functional resins are incorporated as epoxy harden-
ers, typically generating new ester linkages and OH groups after crosslinking (Table 2.3e). The abbreviation TGIC
refers to tri-glycidyl isocyanurate (EEW ∼99.1, tri-functional, Tm 95–125 ∘C). It is noted that TGIC/COOH systems
without aromatic structures are highly weatherable, while epoxy (primarily DGEBAs)/COOH hybrids are not;
both are integral platforms of epoxy and COOH-functional polyester powder coatings for decorative applications
where mechanical and color durability under exterior conditions are essential attributes. Epoxy/COOH, includ-
ing TGIC/COOH coatings, is preferably accelerated by cationic catalysts such as phosphonium salts or similar
compounds (refer to cationic catalysts in Section 2.2.1.2). This is because COOH and cationic substances are nat-
urally compatible. Please note that almost all polyester resins for decorative powder coatings are already pre-loaded
with catalysts (e.g., ETPPI or ETPPBr) by the manufacturer, which are searchable in SDS (i.e., safety data sheet).
In systems containing COOH-functional resins, however, weakly anionic tertiary amines and imidazoles, with
the exception of those that are fugitive or unstable, such as Albemarle’s ADMA-8, are valid and more effective
catalysts than cationic grades, with minimal incompatibility concerns. Some organometallic zinc catalysts, such
as Nacure XC-271 and XC-286 from Kings Industries, offer improved UV resistance and a low-temperature cure
(e.g., 30 minutes at 120 ∘C). Cetrimide BP (powder, Peninsula Polymers), MYTAB 6110 (powder, Vertellus), and
AMC-2 and ATC-3 (liquids; AMPAC Fine Chemicals), among many others, are applicable alternatives to ETPPI
in epoxy/anhydride systems, although they are not necessarily more effective than tertiary amines. In contrast,
hydroxyl (OH)-functional polyesters and acrylics cured by either internally or externally blocked isocyanates and
typically catalyzed by DBTDL (dibutyl-tin dilaurate) are another chemistry platform for powder coatings for wide
decorative applications; the other is OH-functional polyesters cured by HAAs (β-hydroxyl alkyl amides) via con-
densation, which is discussed separately in Chapter 9. Please be aware that DBTDL is also a potent catalyst for
silicone elastomer systems. Due to safety concerns, tin-free alternatives are commercially available, such as bis-
muth octoate, bismuth carboxylate (e.g., K-KAT XK-651, also good for blocked isocyanates, 2K urethanes, and
polysiloxanes), nickel octoate, zinc complex (e.g., K-KAT XK-635, also good for low-temperature cure of blocked
isocyanates, and K-KAT XK-661, also for 1K moisture cure systems), and so on.
Regarding TGIC (refer to Table 2.3e) in particular, it is aliphatic, tri-functional in terms of epoxides or gly-
cidyls, with a practical EEW of 107 g/eq as opposed to 99.1 g/eq theoretically, and it is often excessively loaded
in COOH-functional polyester formulations to ensure complete cure, as epoxide homo-polymerization (refer to
Figures 3.1/3.2b in Chapter 3) always consumes additional glycidyl groups, regardless of whether catalyzation is

cationic (e.g., via an onium salt) or anionic (e.g., via a tertiary amine or preferably an imidazole). COOH-functional
polyester suppliers almost always provide a weight ratio, such as, for example, 93/7 (polyester/TGIC), as a formu-
lation guide, which results in TGIC consistently in excess at a calculated molar ratio of about 1: 1.2 in the system.
Isocyanates are occasionally added to epoxies, including TGIC/COOH formulations, as a crosslinking booster by
reacting with both glycidyls and newly formed aliphatic OHs (refer to Figure 2.11).
Notably, AGC Chemicals’ Lumiflon® FEVE resins (e.g., typical powder grades of Tm 90–136 ∘C, EW-OH 1,058,
Figure 2.9e) contain either OH- or COOH-functional groups that cure melamine and blocked isocyanates readily
at elevated temperatures. In general, such fluoropolymers possess C-F bonds in the FE segments for low-surface
tension and super hydrophobicity, as well as C—H and reactive groups in the VE segments for solubility or com-
patibility, gloss, and adhesion. In addition to their widespread use in liquid coatings and paints, FEVE resins can be
incorporated into epoxy/COOH hybrid coatings and TGIC/COOH systems to impart durability and weatherability
for exterior applications. In comparison, commercially available fluorinated polyether polyols include Polytex 656
and 6520, as well as other products from ThermoFisher Scientific.
2.1.6
Polysulﬁdes or mercaptans
Referring once more to Table 2.3, liquid polysulfides, or mercaptans, are sulfur-containing base pre-polymers with
advantageously distinct features such as rapid and low-temperature cure, flexibility, and adhesion. They have a
distinct odor and coloring, which is an obvious disadvantage when used as epoxy cures. Huntsman/Gabriel is most
likely the leading US provider of polymeric mercaptans. Polysulfides are commonly used as an epoxy crosslinker in
adhesives, sealants, and coatings, as are their epoxidized derivatives as binder resins. Mercaptans are also utilized
in polyurethanes as a chain transfer agent.
QE-340M (12% wt SH content, Figure 2.10a) from Toray Fine Chemicals, an aliphatic thiol-terminated polyether
polymer, and Thiocure TEMPIC, that is, tris[2-(3-mercapto-propionyloxy) ethyl] isocyanurate (CAS# 36196-44-8,
EW-SH ∼175.2) from Bruno Bock, among others, are commercial poly-sulfur products that can cure epoxies,
preferably under catalyzation of a tertiary amine such as DMP-30 (refer to Table 2.5b). TEMPIC is structurally
similar to glycidyl-functional TGIC, except that it has three-fold SH functionality. Particularly, Shikoku Chemi-
cals’ waxy TS-G (Figure 2.10b) magnifies a quadruple functional thiol compound as an epoxy crosslinker, enabling
low temperature and fast cure (e.g., 83 seconds gel time at 80 ∘C and 1 phr) for epoxy coatings and adhesives, as well
as high Tg and humidity/acid/alkali resistance. Notably, crosslinking reactions of epoxies by polysulfides are read-
ily enhanced by organic amines, such as DETA (diethyldiamine) and BDMA (benzyldimethylamine), irrespective
of whether they are primary or tertiary, as depicted in Figure 2.10c. Clearly, polysulfides (−SH) can be cured by
isocyanates for liquid or paste adhesive and sealant applications, as well as by acrylates and vinyl-functional com-
pounds (such as vinyl esters) via photo-initiated click Michael reactions (refer to Figure 9.20c in Chapter 9).

These polysulfide epoxies can be suitably cured with 1∘- and 2∘-amines to offer low-temperature cure and thermal
stability.
2.1.7
Isocyanates
Isocyanates, which are not listed in Table 2.3, are also one of the most important crosslinkers for epoxies. Iso-
cyanates and epoxies can react via a number of distinct pathways. First, epoxides directly react with NCO to
produce oxazolidinones (refer to Figure 1.5a in Chapter 1), which is a strategy for isocyanate-modified epox-
ides to develop high-performance resin derivatives. Second, the aliphatic secondary OHs existing on the backbone
of epoxy resins also react with NCO, preferably under catalysis such as by DBTDL, resulting in urethane linkages
(NH—CO—O−, Figure 2.11), which is part of the chemistry-enhancing crosslinking density for epoxy/COOH

hybrid systems as discussed previously. An illustrative formulation of a blocked isocyanate and epoxy is presented
in Table 9.1 of Chapter 9. In addition, isocyanurates are simultaneously produced via NCO trimerization (refer
to Figure 1.5b in Chapter 1), depending on the reaction and catalytic conditions, as reported in [31]. NCO trimer-
ization is, coincidentally, crucial to isocyanurate foam applications.
From the standpoint of being bulk binder resins, isocyanates and epoxies are both amine- and hydroxyl-
crosslinkable (typically phenyl hydroxyls for epoxies). In terms of crosslinkers’ reactivity for isocyanates, the
following is typically the order from fastest to slowest: primary aliphatic amines > secondary aliphatic amines
> aromatic amines > primary alcohols > H2O > secondary alcohols > COOH > urea > urethanes [32], which is
largely consistent with the order of their reactivities for epoxies, except that alcohols and water directly react with
isocyanates in PUR systems and serve as catalysts for anionic step growth (Figures 3 and 66B/C in Vidil et al. [33])
and chain transfer agents for cationic chain-growth (Figure 3.8b) in epoxy systems, respectively. The general
order of isocyanate polymerization rates is aromatic > aliphatic > cycloaliphatic > primary isocyanates, which
is essentially consistent with that of epoxies. Isocyanates are especially amenable to catalysis; their common
catalysts include tertiary amines (such as DABCO and DMP-30; refer to Tables 2.5a/b) and organometallic
complexes (like DBTDL). Instead, epoxies are significantly less sensitive to cationic catalysts such as DBTDL
unless crosslinkers are compatibly anhydrides or organic acids.
In addition, it has been reported that the use of imidazole-blocked isocyanates (e.g., HDI trimers) as crosslink-
ers permits low-temperature cure (e.g., 100–120 ∘C) of automotive clearcoats formulated with polyester polyols
[34]. These blocked isocyanates and similar compounds should be suitable for epoxy crosslinking, leveraging the
synergy between the isocyanate as a crosslinker and imidazole as a catalyst.

2.1 Crosslinkers or Hardeners
47
2.1.8
Silicones
In a further aspect, and yet unlisted in Table 2.3, hydroxyl-functional silicone resins or intermediates crosslink
epoxies via etherification reactions with epoxide- and hydroxyl-functional groups on epoxy resins, preferably
under, for example, DBTDL catalysis [35], as illustrated in Figure 2.12, where Z-6018 is identical to Dow Corning’s
Dowsil RSN-6018 (MW 1,500−2,500, solid flake at room temperature), a silanol (Si-OH)-functional silicone resin
intermediate. In addition to the addition reactions with epoxides, silanols undergo direct self-condensation and
indirect co-condensation with epoxy’s secondary-aliphatic OHs, releasing trace amounts of water. This implies
that the formulation must be properly planned and processed in terms of, for example, the loading level of the
silicone resin intermediate and moisture-absorbing additives or fillers, such that incompatibility and moisture
interference at the interface and in bulk phases are contained or minimized. Otherwise, problematic porosity,
poor integrity, and impaired adhesion may develop, particularly when compatibility between the applied silicone
and bulk epoxy components in the system is either moderate or poor.
A two-component (2K) room temperature-curable coating has been disclosed by Raiyani et al. [36], consisting
of an epoxy-functional silicone serving as the bulk resin and a package containing an amino-functional silicone
and an aminoalkoxysilane as the curative. Introducing silicones as a reactive ingredient at modest loading
levels (e.g., 0.45 phr) into epoxy coatings can be cost-effective, similar to the incorporation of silanes in liquid
coatings, if executed properly. The advantages of this formulation strategy include improved coating homogeneity,
particularly for powder systems with much higher filler loading levels, such as up to 45% by weight of the entire
formulation, enhanced flow and adhesion, and improved moisture resistance. All of these effects are attributed
to the low-surface energy and hydrophobicity of the silicone additive, which are eventually cured into the
bulk system. Sufficient cure schedules (i.e., a suitable combination of cure durations and temperatures) are
also important for silicone-contained systems, which are always subject to trials and errors for performance
optimization.

2 Epoxy Curing Agents
2.2
Catalysts and Accelerators
2.2.1
Catalysts
Catalysts are the second most essential composition in the vast majority of epoxy coatings, following resins. Specif-
ically, catalysts are more important than crosslinkers in constructing robustly functional epoxy formulations due
to the fact that some systems, such as FBEs, perform even better in terms of modulus, Tg, and toughness in the
absence of a crosslinker (refer to crosslinker-free formulation studies in Chapter 6). The driving mechanism of
cure is epoxy-epoxy homo-polymerization (refer to Figures 3.1/3.2b in Chapter 3), which will be described in
greater depth in the subsequent chapter. From a processing standpoint, using a more effective catalyst allows for-
mulations to cure in less time, or at lower temperatures, or both without sacrificing coating performance. From a
chemical standpoint, catalytic ingredients expedite curing by initiating or creating reactive intermediates or com-
plexes under heat, although most of them do not directly participate in the cured network and are ultimately
unconsumed. Small molecules, such as water, alcohols, and phenols, are excellent catalytic agents for epoxies, as
they stimulate epoxy-crosslinker co-polymerization (refer to Figures 3.1/3.2a in Chapter 3). In epoxy systems, the
kinetic situation becomes more complicated as competing events of homo-cures and co-polymerization concur-
rently take place. As an intrinsic part of overall crosslinking reactions, homo-polymerization is more promoted by
a catalyst (such as a tertiary amine or imidazole), thus inevitably altering the cure dynamics and the architecture
of the cured polymer structure. From a kinetic standpoint, even minute amounts of catalysts applied as additives
can have a considerable effect on curing rates, as indicated by activation energy (Ea) and the reaction orders (m, n)
(refer to cure kinetics in Chapter 5). In this sense, DSC (differential scanning calorimetry) allows for the exact
quantification of the catalytic power of a known or unknown catalyst.
This section focuses on catalysts that promote epoxy self-crosslinking or homo-polymerization (homo-cures),
because this type of cure is just as important and substantial for epoxy systems. Homo-cures are in a chain-growth
mode (as opposed to stepwise co-polymerization), with tertiary (3∘) amines, onium salts, and certain organometal-
lic complexes serving as active catalysts. Recall, as discussed in Chapter 1, that difunctional (f = 2) epoxies, such
as the BPA-based epoxies, are capable of crosslinking via the formation of 4-fold functional (f = 4) RO−intermedi-
ates in order to proceed primarily with homo-polymerization, regardless of the type of crosslinkers (difunctional
or multi-functional) applied.
2.2.1.1
Anionic catalysts: tertiary (3∘) amines and imidazoles
Having no active hydrogens, tertiary (3∘) amines do not co-polymerize with epoxide groups like 1∘- and 2∘-amines
do. Instead, 3∘-amines typically function as catalysts to stabilize the transitional states for epoxy self-crosslinking
facilitation. As the most prevalent epoxy catalysts for industrial applications, 3∘-amines are typical of Lewis base
or anionic catalysts and imidazole derivatives, as classified in Table 2.5, bearing one or more NR3 in their aliphatic
or aromatic structures. Under heat, these NR3 exclusively initiate epoxide ring-opening events, yielding RO−
intermediates that carry out subsequent epoxy homo-cures. The 3∘-amines may be generated in-situ from the
co-polymerization of 1∘-and 2∘-amines with epoxies, freshly loaded into formulations, or both.
Referring specifically to Table 2.5, first, dicyclic DABCO (Table 2.5a) is a highly nucleophilic amine that is
effective in not only epoxy systems but also polyurethanes and others intended for a wide range of applications,
including liquid and powder coatings, adhesives, turbine blades, and composites. Aromatic tertiary amines
include liquid 2,4,6-tris (dimethylaminomethyl) phenol, also known as DMP-30 (Table 2.5b), for example,
Ancamine K54 from Evonik, and latent DMAP (Table 2.5c), for example, Reillcat FCS Catalyst from Vertellus.
Gabriel Products’ GPA-30, which is an analogous tertiary amine to Ancaminc K54. Similar to Mannich bases but
modified with three-fold tertiary mines, DMP-30 is uniquely structured with a phenyl hydroxyl that is capable of
directly crosslinking epoxies. DMP-30, Mannich bases [37], and phenalkamines are ideal amine curing agents for
low-temperature cure liquid coatings and clearcoats for this reason as well.

2.2 Catalysts and Accelerators
49
Second, when thermally activated, imidazoles, such as 2MI (Table 2.5d) and 2PI, or 2-propyl-imidazole
(Table 2.5e), are even more effective than 3∘-amines in terms of faster gel and cure at a given loading level. Please
note that 2IPI (2-isopropyl-imidazole) and 2PI of still great latency are semi-solid at room temperature, revealing
that they are favorably more soluble and compatible with epoxy melts, a characteristic that can be leveraged in
advanced FBE formulations for rebar (reinforced steel bar for concrete), where solid imidazoles otherwise must
be ground into fine particles (e.g., Epikure P-101 from Hexion ≤10 μm) for maximizing mutual mixing and
uniform cure and flexibility performance at optimal levels. Certain imidazole-metal complexes exhibit improved
stability and reactivity (upon thermal activation) in comparison to imidazoles. For example, 1-cyanoethyl-2E4MI
(refer to Figures 3.3b and 3.5a in Chapter 3), where the cyano group has a strong electron-withdrawing effect,
can be modified using copper (II) chloride from a liquid state to a complex-liquid and complex-solid mixture at
ambient temperature to increase its thermal latency and reactivity with respect to epoxy resins [38].
Thirdly, imidazole adducts (Table 2.5f) resulting from reactions between imidazoles and BPA-based epoxies are
frequently utilized as anionic catalysts due to their enhanced compatibility, latency (higher Tm), and consistency.
Imidazole adducts comprise only tertiary amines, whereas amine adducts (refer to Figure 2.2h) apparently con-
tain both primary and secondary amines. In addition to being custom or in-house manufacturable, commercial
imidazole adducts consist of, but are not limited to, the following products: Cureduct P-0505 fine powders from
Shikoku Chemicals, Technicure LC-80 and -100 from ACCI Specialty Materials, Epikure P-100 and P-101 granules
from Hexion/Westlake, Curaid E100-P powders from Sovereign Technologies, and Aradur 3088 flakes from Hunts-
man. To increase their reactivity, the majority of these imidazole-adduct grades contain up to 5% 2MI. Epikure
P-100 and P-101 have the precise chemical structure depicted in Table 2.5f for imidazole adducts, where the car-
bons at labeled positions 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 exhibit characteristic peaks at 142.2, 125.4, 119.7, 47.7, and 12.2 ppm,
respectively, as determined by 13C-NMR analysis using DMSO as the solvent; it is misleading to refer to these solid
imidazole-adduct compounds as amine adducts, which are typically liquid.
Fourth, urea (−NH−CO−NH−) derivatives that are either aromatic or aliphatic (Tables 2.5g/h) and
consist of 2∘- and 3∘-amines are just as effective as other anionic catalysts being discussed. Particularly,
3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea, or DCMU, also known as Diuron (CAS# 330-54-1), is a dormant
catalyst, transforming into an isocyanate moiety and a 2∘-amine under heat prior to proceeding with the respec-
tive cure reactions of co-polymerization with epoxies, as depicted in Figure 2.13. Lastly, liquid and semi-solid
amino-catalysts, such as DMP-30, 2-PI, and urea modifications, can be converted into a free-flow powder for best
premix dispersing in practice, if necessary, via a physical encapsulation technique employing silica or zeolite

Technologies are, in fact, encapsulated free-flow powders of DMP-30 (Table 2.5b) and the aliphatic urea derivative
(Table 2.5h) containing 65% of the active ingredient, respectively.
2.2.1.2
Cationic catalysts
As remarkable as the preceding anionic (RO−) mechanism, cationic or proton (H+) catalyzation represents an
alternating epoxy homo-cure route. As a result, ring-opening etherification of epoxies takes place similarly and
rapidly under UV radiation, and it is readily initiated by Lewis acid (cationic) catalysts such as metal halides, onium
salts with a variety of counterions and organometallic complexes, etc. In this regard, oxonium cations, that is,
essentially H
O , are initially formed and responsible for subsequent chain-growth polymerization, as described in
Table 2.6. As previously stated, epoxy homo-cures utilizing cationic catalysts produce only a single OH in addition
to flexible ether linkages in the bulk chain propagation (Table 2.6a), which is readily terminated by counterions or
negatively charged impurities, including alcohols (Tables 2.6b/c). For additional information, readers may refer
to relevant resources [33, 39]. Typical examples of inorganic metal salts or complexes include BF3, BCl3, FeCl3,
SnCl4, ZnCl2, etc., of which some are latent and others are not. Notably, boron trihalide (BX3)-amine complexes
promote epoxy homo-polymerization exceptionally well as cationic catalysts. Still notably, ZnCl2 is effective at
catalyzing not only aromatic epoxies such as DEGBAs but also aliphatic (or linear) and alicyclic ones, in addition
to being an epoxy-isocyanate modification catalyst. Comparatively, organic onium salts are frequently referred
to as sulphonium, phosphonium, and nitrogen-containing, including aromatic ETPPI (MW 418.2, Tm 166 ∘C,
CAS# 4736-60-1, for example, supplied by Deepwater Chemicals, QPS Dow, and others) and aliphatic Cyphos
IL 169 (CAS# 20445-90-7, MW 384.5, for example, supplied by Solvay), a phosphonium ionic liquid, as shown in
Figures 2.14a/b, respectively. Cyphos IL 169 is claimed to have low viscosity, latency at low temperatures, solubil-
ity in both neat epoxies and 2K epoxy-anhydride systems, fast cure at elevated temperatures, and hydrophobicity,

prepared NHC-stabilized HP2
+ cations (where P2 is unstable, Figure 2.14c), analogous to aryl diazonium cations
RN2
+ (where N2 is stable), for the first time [40] using the NHC Lewis bases with a sturdy lone pair of e−that bonds
and stabilizes metals and molecule fragments, thereby opening up new avenues of cationic catalyst research.
Due to mutual cancellation of reactivity, it is not recommended to employ cationic (positively charged) salt com-
plexes as a catalyst in conjunction with an anionic (negatively charged) amine curing agent in an epoxy system.
In any case, the compatibility and minimum loading levels of such catalysts and additives must be practically
evaluated, validated, and optimized for the intended formulations and applications. Other organic salts of indus-
trial significance include, but are not limited to, BTEAC (benzyl triethyl ammonium chloride), BTPPCI (benzyl
triphenol phosphonium chloride), cetrimide BP or CTAB (cetrimonium bromide quaternary ammonium salt),
TBAB (tetra butyl ammonium bromide), and ETPPBr (QPS ethyltriphenylphosphonium bromide). Due to their
ionic compatibility with carboxyl groups, these options offer a variety of reactivities and latent powers as cationic
catalysts, particularly for formulating decorative hybrid powder coatings based on epoxy and COOH-functional
polyesters, including TGIC/COOH-functional polyester systems.
Metal salt derivatives such as organometallic complexes and similar compounds are also effective cationic cat-
alysts, including ZnAcAc (zinc acetylacetonate chelates, Tm 139 ∘C) and similar compounds, as well as DBTDL
(dibutyltin dilurate) and similar compounds. ZnAcAc is an effective catalyst for hybrid epoxy/COOH-functional
polyester systems. In terms of reactivity and cost-effectiveness, however, imidazoles, essentially weak Lewis bases,
such as 2-PI, tend to outperform ZnAcAc and many cationic (salt) complex catalysts at a given loading level in such
hybrid systems and TGIC/COOH-functional polyester formulations. Sometimes, strong organic Bronsted acids,
most of which are also Lewis acids, such as p-TSA (Tm 106 ∘C), dodecanedioic acid (Tm 128 ∘C), dodecylbenzene-
sulfonic acid (DDBSA, corrosive liquid; refer to Table 8.7 in Chapter 8), and the like, are suitable cationic catalysts
for systems of interest, such as isocyanate-cured benzoxazines where anionic amines are ineffective [41]. Notably,
DABCO (Table 2.5a) and DBTDL are highly effective and widely employed in liquid and powder polyurethanes,
where anionic amine catalysts also perform well; however, strongly cationic p-TSA is ineffective. Again, DOEs
(design of experiments) should always be carried out to verify the compatibility and efficacy of a particular catalyst
in a particular formulation or platform.
Moreover, Al POMs, that is, aluminum polyoxometalates (Tm 285 ∘C, Hybrid Plastics, Figure 2.14d), com-
posed of Lewis acidic aluminum atoms, thermally stable cages (−Si-O-Si−), and solubilizing organic groups

52
2 Epoxy Curing Agents
(i-Bu), are anticipated to serve as a novel cationic catalyst from chemical and structural standpoints. As stable
discrete complexes similar to POSS (i.e., polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes), Al POMs are developed using
nano-dispersing technology to behave as polymeric catalyst carriers more compatible with epoxies and other
resins such as bismaleimides (BMIs). By generating acidic aluminum atoms or strong cationicity, Al POMs allow
for a lower curing temperature at low-loading levels (e.g., 1% by weight), as well as very low-catalyst migration.
Al POMs may also be efficient catalysts for systems such as benzoxazines (BOXs) and BMIs, as discussed in
Chapters 7 and 9.
2.2.2
Accelerators and modiﬁers
The term “accelerator” is sometimes used to describe weak Lewis base catalysts like tertiary amines and imida-
zoles; however, in this context, accelerators refer to reactive monomers that do not serve as catalysts (to be reformed
in the end), but can accelerate or modify cure reactions by reacting into crosslinking networks if incorporated. As
regards accelerators and modifiers for epoxy curing, phenol derivatives and acrylates are the two most common
types used in practice.
2.2.2.1
Phenol derivatives
Epoxy curing accelerators are mono-functional phenol derivatives, such as phenol, benzyl alcohol, nonyl phenol
(Figure 2.15a), butyl phenol, cardanol, salicylic acid (Figure 2.15c), and so on, since phenols (Ph-OHs) are reactive
toward epoxides, as shown in Table 2.3a. If incorporated, they should be loaded together with the crosslinker(s) in
the 2K liquid coatings’ Component B. Nonyl phenols are a similarly efficient accelerator in polyurethane systems
and must likewise be added to the Component B of amines. The Kumanox 311F (Figure 2.15b) offered by Kumho
Petrochemical is a direct substitute for nonyl phenol. Please note that all of these accelerators are essentially
mono-functional and aromatic hydroxyls that do not engage in crosslinking. Aliphatic hydroxyls do not operate
as accelerators for epoxy curing, but they do act as chain transfer agents in UV-induced cationic homo-cures of
epoxies (refer to Tables 2.6b/c).
On the one hand, applying heat or raising the acidity of a phenol derivative accelerator expedites the cur-
ing process. On the other hand, free BPAs (which are bifunctional) persisting in BPA-based phenolic resins
(refer to Figure 2.6d, and Figure 7.2 in Chapter 7) react directly with epoxies, as do free phenols (which are
mono-functional) in resole and novolac-phenolic resins (refer to Figures 2.6b/c, and Figures 7.1g/h in Chapter 7)
per se. Based on historical and statistical data, the overall coating performance is not adversely affected and

is sometimes enhanced. The explanation for this is because Ph-OH-functional BPAs and phenols behave
synergically as a crosslinker and an accelerator, respectively, in the compounded systems.
2.2.2.2
Acrylates
Vinyl-functional acrylates readily react with primary (1∘) and secondary (2∘) amines (but not tertiary ones) via the
well-known Michael Addition reaction under mild conditions (e.g., heat), especially when anionic-ally catalyzed
by amines (of basicity) or metal complexes or organo-catalysts, generating 2∘- and 3∘-amines, respectively; the for-
mer can further react with epoxides to generate a co-polymerized network, whereas the latter (i.e., the 3∘-amines)
ends the polymerization or behaves as a catalyst on its own. Application of the Michael Addition, which entails the
reaction of a nucleophile (e−-donor) with an electron-deficient alkene (e−-acceptor), preferably in the presence of
a catalyst, for non-isocyanate (NISO) formulations in various forms, will be addressed as needed throughout the
chapters. Ethenesulfonyl fluoride (ESF), with electrophilicity values of −12.09, is one of the most powerful Michael
acceptors according to Chen et al. [42]. Multi-functional acrylates such as TMPTA (Figure 2.15d) and DiTMPTA
(Figure 2.15f), if employed as accelerators, must be loaded with the epoxy resin(s) in the component B of 2K liquid
coatings. Similarly, those with mono-vinyl functionality, such as DEMM (i.e., di-substituted alkene, Figure 2.15e),
as an accelerator, are capable of anionic co-polymerization (or Michael Addition) with amines that selectively
react with epoxies but not crosslinking. DEMM is commercially available, such as ChemilianTM M1000 XP from
Sirrus Chemistry [43]. In a sense, epoxy-amine-acrylate formulations are hybrids for enhanced performance in
addition to accelerated curing. Epoxy-phenolic-acrylate formulations also function well when the phenolic(s)
are ortho-substituted, such as the resole and novolac types, since the interactions between acrylates and phe-
nolics are no longer the Michael Addition but the Diels−Alder (refer to Chapter 7). Other crosslinkers, excluding
amines and phenolics, may inhibit the incorporation of acrylates as a co-resin, accelerator, or modifier in epoxy
systems. Regardless of their mono-, di-, or multi-functionality, acrylates and vinyl-functional compounds, includ-
ing vinyl esters, and styrene, as bonding resins and polymers, are typically capable of free-radical polymerization,
for example, by peroxides, as opposed to Michael Addition.
In addition to acid etching on metal substrates for adhesion, acrylic monomers such as MAAs (methacrylic
acids, Figure 2.15g) with dual functionality (vinyl and COOH) can be incorporated as an accelerator in 1K liq-
uid coatings. This MAA formulation strategy is accepted in certain coil/packaging coatings formulated with a
high-MW BPA-based epoxy resin (such as EPON 1009F for superior flexibility) and a resole phenolic crosslinker
(such as Epikure 200-N-60). As for 2K liquid coatings of epoxies, co-accelerators consisting of a phenol derivative
in Component B and an acrylate resin in Component A are practically accepted and utilized in formulations (refer
to Table 6.2 in Chapter 6 and Figure 8.6 in Chapter 8). In addition, it has been reported that xylene formaldehyde
resins and their modifications favorably extend cure times of liquid epoxy adhesives, depending on their reactivity
and chemical structures [44]; this class of epoxy-reactive modifiers is typically loaded alongside crosslinkers in
Component B of 2K formulations.
2.3
UV Radiation
In contrast to crosslinkers and catalysts as chemical sources, incident UV radiation as an energy source enables
epoxy homo-polymerization to occur effectively and cationically in the presence of, for example, an onium salt.
This is due to the photo-initiation of oxonium cations (H
O ) by UV radiation. However, combination resins must
be non-aromatic grades, such as aliphatic and cycloaliphatic epoxies. As discussed and shown in Figure 1.10c of
Chapter 1. Cyracure UVR-6128 (EEW 200) from Dow is a cycloaliphatic epoxide resin designed exclusively for UV
cationic cure with anti-yellowing, great adhesion to metals and plastics, including polyolefins, and low-shrinkage
properties. When formulating adhesives, the addition of a silane such as Silquest® A-186 (e.g., from Momentive

54
2 Epoxy Curing Agents
Performance Materials) can further improve adhesion [45]. In contrast to UV curing of epoxies, which follows a
cationic mechanism as depicted in Table 2.6a [39], UV curing of acrylics is typically free radical using peroxides
(such as organic peroxides from Nouryon) as photo initiators. UV curing of epoxies is consequently a rapid process,
although not as rapid as the free-radical reactions of acrylics. In addition, UV-induced epoxy homo-cures are
immune to film shrinkage and so-called oxygen inhibition, whereas acrylic free radicals are susceptible to both.
Upon cationic UV curing, straight cycloaliphatic epoxides are frequently too brittle to be useful. As a result,
hydroxyl-functional modifiers are purposely incorporated for successive co-polymerization and improved tough-
ness [46–48] via chain transfer reactions (Figures 3.8a/b in Chapter 3). The most common transfer agents of
hydroxyls are polyether polyols, hydroxyl-functional siloxanes, castor oil, phenoxy resins, etc., enabling a variety
of rapid cure end uses, including paper coatings, wood coatings, overprinting varnishes, and so on. Water, alco-
hols, phenols, and acids, if present in formulations, are all effective chain transfer agents. Throughout the years,
researchers at the University of Akron have conducted extensive research on the cationic UV coating technology
[49, 50]. Additionally, hybrid resin systems are developed by Verschueren and Kaur [47], such as via a combina-
tion of cationic and free-radical cures under UV light, for increased cure speed and decreased moisture sensitivity,
and are highly desired for enhanced compatibility with pure cationic or pure free-radical coatings. Hybrid resins
are typically composed of alicyclic epoxides as well as acrylates, or alternatively glycidyl esters (refer to Figure
1.10c in Chapter 1 and Figures 2.5a/b), ethers, or other aliphatic epoxides such as PBD-modified epoxies (refer
to Figure 1.6c in Chapter 1), perhaps oxetanes (refer to Figures 1.12c/d in Chapter 1) and the like for improved
performance, such as chemical resistance and flexibility. It is worth noting that photo-initiated curing is inferior
to redox (reduction-oxidation) reactions or redox-initiated curing in terms of improved depth of cure and slower
accumulation of stress during the initial stage of polymerization [51]. As a result, a photo base-redox initiating
system, potentially comprising a quaternary ammonium salt and a peroxide, is preferred for dark cure [52, 53].
Debrief A Amine and anhydride crosslinkers
Amines, both primary and secondary grades, are arguably the most important crosslinkers or hardeners for epoxy
coatings, especially 2K liquid epoxy coatings, in which the amines are also liquid. The variations of liquid amines
and anhydrides, including formulation advantages and disadvantages, as well as their commercial grades, are
summarized in Table 2.7.
The following are abbreviations and acronyms for the common amines and anhydrides listed in Table 2.7. DETA
stands for diethyl-diamine, AEP stands for aminoethylpiperazine (Table 2.2a), TETA stands for triethylenete-
tramine, TOFA/TEPA stands for tall oil fatty acid/tetraethylenepentamine, MXDA stands for meta-xylenediamine,
and THPA stands for tris(2-hydroxypropyl)amine. MHHPA represents methyl-hexahydro-phthalic anhydride,
HHPA represents hexahydrophthalic anhydride, MDA represents 4,4′-methylene-dianiline, and MDPA represents
3,4′-(methylene)-di-phthalic anhydride, respectively. Particularly, the chlorinated aromatic amine methylene
bis-ortho-chloroaniline (MBOCA, MW 267.15 g/mol, EW-NH 66.80 g/eq, Tm ∼106.5 ∘C, Figure 2.16a), also
abbreviated as MOCA, is a cost-effective solid curative or chain extender for a wide range of thermosetting
systems, including TDI-based polyurea elastomers; it possesses a combination of properties such as tensile and
impact strength, durability, resilience, and cut, tear and abrasion resistance, in addition to favorable reactivity
profiles. However, as previously explained, the presence of chlorine ions in the system are detrimental to corrosion
resistance.
Debrief B Aromaticity vs. aliphaticity, and hydrophilicity vs. hydrophobicity
The reactivity and performance of a formula are also determined by its curing agents. Similar to epoxy resins,
epoxy curatives can be distinguished structurally according to their aromaticity and aliphaticity. Without limit-
ing to theory, and in terms of the overall structure-property relationships, aromatics mainly contribute adhesion

to substrates, stiffness to bulk modulus, and Tg under certain conditions, whereas aliphatics typically promote
bulk flexibility and weatherability. Crosslinking bio-based epoxies in liquid systems with acyclic aliphatic amines
may result in enhanced thermal cure and mechanical properties (e.g., adhesion, hardness, impact resistance, etc.)
compared to cyclic aliphatic amines [54]. When certain epoxy resins are employed in a coating, the best system
performance, including toughness, is primarily attained by integrating an appropriate crosslinker that imparts
the optimal amount of rigidity or flexibility to the cured network. In addition to functionality considerations, it
makes sense to choose, for example, DDS (Figure 2.2f) with aromatic rings or particularly BAF (Table 2.2h) with
stacked aromatic rings or the like as a curative for a given epoxy resin package of FBEs when a higher Tg is desired
for heat-resistant applications, while selecting dihydrazides (Figure 2.2c) with aliphatic chains or the BPA-based
phenolics (Figure 2.6d) with a linear- or para-structure or the analogous as a crosslinker when flexibility is more

56
2 Epoxy Curing Agents
important to end users. Regardless, allied compositions and formulations are always validated through conducting
quantitative DOEs of resin and crosslinker combinations.
Similarly, hydrophobic (i.e., water repulsion) crosslinkers are generally preferred over hydrophilic (i.e., water
affinity) ones, if compatible with epoxies (that are hydrophobic to varying degrees and hydrophobicity gener-
ally increases with MWs, as discussed in Chapter 1), for electrical and electronics applications in which mois-
ture resistance, cured film permeability, and dielectric properties (such as low-dielectric constant and tangent
loss) are crucial, in particular. Fundamentally, a hydrophilic surface refers to a water droplet’s receding angle
θR < 90∘, switching to hydrophobicity if θR > 90∘, as a result of water’s high-surface tension; superhydrophobicity
is defined as an advancing angle θA ≥145∘with no affinity for water [55]. Hydrophobic moieties are typically
non-polar hydrocarbons, cyclohexyls, phenyls, and mixtures thereof; the hydrophobicity of these fractions rises
as their chain lengths grow. The basicity of amines affects their water solubility, particularly in acidic environ-
ments. Hydrophobic amine curing agents, such as those containing ortho-alkyl substitutions (Figure 2.16b) [56],
imply that the cured structure upon completion of epoxide-amine reactions allows for improved water or mois-
ture repellence even at elevated service temperatures. Many epoxy curatives are considered and/or tested to be
hydrophobic, including, amongst others, fluorene amines (Table 2.2h), fluorene phenolics (Table 2.4d), silicone
amines (Table 2.2i), fluorinated amines (Table 2.2j), PPP-BPs (Table 2.4e), FEVEs (Figure 2.9e), and Zeffle GK-570
equivalents (Daikin Chemicals).
As with epoxy resins, the selection of appropriate hardeners is situation- and formulation-dependent and driven
by performance. For instance, the hardeners required for 1- and 2-component (1/2K) epoxy liquid and powder
coatings are considerably different. In general, it is safe to follow technical common sense; for example, aliphatic
and cycloaliphatic amines and certain amine adducts are suitable for clearcoats; dihydrazides are preferred over
DICY for lower temperature cure and better flexibility due to their lower melting points and more flexible CH2
chains, respectively; aromatic amines such as 4,4-DDS are hardeners in favor of arguably higher Tg formulations;
and phenolics over amines are obviously better choices for acid-resistant applications because phenolics’ Ph-OH
functions are weakly acidic in nature. There are unquestionably additional variables and parameters that must
be concurrently taken into account, such as adhesion to a specific substrate, customer-friendly cure schedules,
compatibility, and latency.
Debrief C Reactivity and effectiveness of catalysts
In contrast to how epoxy resins and hardeners are measured, EWs are no longer an applicable term for describing
catalysts or their reactivity because a catalyst remains unchanged stoichiometrically and in mass at the end of cure
reactions. Empirically, nucleophilicity, MWs, structures including steric effects, solubility, and compatibility are all
important considerations. In practice, no single catalyst is suitable for all reactions, so screening and determination
of a catalyst for an intended formulation is always necessary. In epoxy coatings excluding those by UV radiation,
imidazoles (such as Tables 2.5d/e/f) and tertiary amines (such as Tables 2.5a/b/c) are typically more effective
catalysts than others.
In general, a catalyst accelerates the rate of reaction but has no effect on the yield of the reaction. However,
catalysts in epoxy systems alter the yield’s overall composition due to a substantial increase in epoxy etherification
relative to epoxy-hardener co-polymerization. From a kinetic standpoint, the primary function of catalysts is to
provide a low-energy threshold pathway for reactions to proceed more freely at a given cure cycle (i.e., a combina-
tion of temperatures and times). Reactivity and effectiveness of one catalyst or comparisons of multiple catalysts
at a given loading level by weight are universally measured by the cure rates (i.e., d𝛼
dt ) in terms of temperatures,
which are fundamentally governed by four kinetic parameters such as the pre-exponential factor (A, 1/sec for
a first-order reaction), the activation energy (Ea, J/mol), and the reaction orders (m and n) in accordance with
an autocatalytic model applicable to catalyzed epoxy formulations, as follows: d𝛼
dt = A•e
−Ea
RT •𝛼m(1 −𝛼)n. These key
model parameters can be determined numerically by performing DSC thermal characterization on formulation

specimens (refer to Chapter 5 for exclusive details). In general and qualitatively, an effective and efficient catalyst
will have either a low Ea value, a small m + n value, or both. Quantitatively, and without being constrained by
theory, when comparing the effectiveness of two or more catalysts in a particular formulation (where resins and
hardeners as well as their ratios are held constant), the catalyst with the lowest Ea and/or smallest m + n is the
most effective. In addition, completed kinetics in the form of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) allow formu-
lators to establish cure schedules, for example, at a temperature consistent with customer capacity, and to direct
further formulation modifications, for example, in terms of an exact gel time. Please note that a faster cure does not
necessarily equate to a better cure. Please also note that there is a maximum mass loading level for the catalysts in a
particular formulation; above this level, the additional quantity of catalysts ceases to accelerate the curing process.
Recaps and Highlights
According to a recent analysis by Future Market Insights Inc. [57], the global market for epoxy curing agents is esti-
mated to be worth approximately USD 3.11 billion in 2022 and to reach a peak of approximately USD 5.16 billion in
2032. Primary (1∘) and secondary (2∘) amines function as catalytic crosslinkers that result in anionic epoxy-amine
co-polymerization. To crosslink epoxies, the former is roughly twice as fast as the latter. Aliphatic > alicyclic >
aromatic is the general order from fastest to slowest for the reactivity of 1∘- and 2∘-amines. Tertiary (3∘) amines and
imidazoles (cyclic amines) are dependable catalysts for anionically catalyzing epoxy-epoxy homo-polymerization
or etherification. In contrast, metal salts and complexes, onium salts, and organometallic complexes are the most
effective catalysts for cationically accelerating epoxy homo-curing under UV or thermal conditions. Pure amine
curatives consist of DICY, dihydrazides, polyamides (aliphatic and aromatic), amine adducts, and ketimines, all of
which are latent, with the exception of polyamides containing transformable imidazole and amine functions. ADH
and SDH enable lower temperature cure powder coatings (180 ∘C) and greater flexibility than DICY; moreover,
VDH with a Tm of 120 ∘C and MOCA with a Tm of ∼106.5 ∘C are likely to enable formulations of the lowest tem-
perature cure powders for wood coatings. Non-latent Mannich bases and modified phenalkamines are synergic
curatives with dual-purpose curable functions (i.e., phenyl hydroxyls and ortho-substituted amines in conjunc-
tion). Amine adducts, Mannich bases, and phenalkamines are superior to slow-curing polyamides for rapid and
low-temperature cure liquid coatings (< 5 ∘C), including anti-yellowing and blush-resistant floor coatings, bench-
tops, and automotive clearcoats.
Purely non-amine hardeners consist primarily of a variety of grades of phenolics, active phenyl esters, organic
acids, and anhydrides, as well as isocyanates and silicones. Phenolics and active esters crosslink epoxies by a
similar mechanism, with the exception that the latter reacts with epoxies to produce no more hydroxyls; anhydrides
also react in this manner. Maximum flexibility can be achieved with the use of BPA-based phenolic resins that have
pure para-structures. As the MW of phenolics increases, so does the compatibility between epoxies and BPA-based
phenolics. In contrast to the BPA-based, ortho-structured resoles, novolac phenolics, and benzoxazines not only
cure epoxies but also crosslink bismaleimides through a Diels−Alder reaction. Crosslinking reactions between
epoxies and isocyanates or silicones should ideally occur under catalyzed and carefully controlled conditions;
otherwise, they may result in undesirable side effects or reactions. Specialty fluorene-based amine (e.g., BAF) and
phenolic (e.g., BPF) curatives and the like with highly aromatic fluorenyl cardo or phthalide cardo groups are
expected to achieve unrivaled structural performance in terms of flexibility, toughness, adhesion, hydrophobicity,
and combinations, if properly formulated. Similar to polyamides and ketimines, which can transform into tertiary
amines by losing water and vice versa, urea-derived DCMU is a latent catalyst that decomposes thermally into an
effective tertiary amine catalyst. In applied epoxy systems, liquid amine adducts and Mannich bases, including
phenalkamines, are the most applicable curatives for liquid coatings, such as clearcoats, for which color stability
is essential over the lifetime of the coating, whereas solid imidazole adducts are the most frequently used catalysts
for functional epoxy powder coatings, that is, FBEs.

2 Epoxy Curing Agents
The majority of cationic catalysts are metal salts and complexes with various counterions, onium salts, and
organometallic complexes, including BX3•amine complexes. Most of them are latent, more ionically compatible
with acids (positively charged), anhydrides, phenolics (weakly acidic), and active esters (neutral), and are
therefore the preferred choices for formulating 1K epoxy/COOH-functional polyester (or acrylic) systems,
such as TGIC/COOH-functional polyester powder coatings intended for exterior decoration. There are no
oxygen-inhibition concerns with cationic UV polymerization, unlike peroxide-induced free radicals such
as acrylate- and vinyl ester-containing coatings. Alcohols, phenols, water, and acids are all effective epoxy
homo-cure catalysts or chain transfer agents. Cationic UV curing of cycloaliphatic epoxies (anti-yellowing) in
combination with vastly selectable polyols and/or electron-deficient vinyls, such as bismaleimides of cyclic vinyl
groups, unleashes enormous potential for novel liquid formulations and applications.
In order to determine the effectiveness and efficiency of a crosslinker or a catalyst in a particular formulation,
no technique on paper is superior to experiments in practice, such as DSC kinetic incorporated DOEs. The field
of epoxy curing agents, which includes hardeners and catalysts, has been evolving and is likely to continue to be
fruitful as new applications continue to emerge as the global economy shifts toward a circular model.

Epoxy Curing Reactions
In Chapter 2, we discussed that epoxies (or epoxides or oxiranes or glycidyls) react with a wide range of
crosslinkers and/or catalysts, such as acids, bases, esters, and so on. Epoxy curing principles are generally
complex and far from being fully understood, despite substantial research into and reasonable proposals for a
few of the curing mechanisms. A technical overview of epoxide reactions by Parker et al. [1] is still incredibly
enlightening, more than six decades after it was first published. Still, from a materials and chemistry standpoint,
this chapter examines those that are both theoretically sound and practically beneficial in driving robust
formulations.
3.1
Co- and Homo-Polymerizations
In most cases, the terms curing, polymerization, and crosslinking are interchangeable; however, in some cases,
crosslinking is more specifically referred to as a three-dimensional (3D) network formed by reactions involving
more than two functional groups, such as epoxy systems. Polyethylene (PE), for example, is produced through ethy-
lene polymerization, which involves chain propagation but no crosslinking. Epoxy curing is a chemical reaction
that solidifies a liquid coating or, in the case of powder coatings, a melted fluid. Co-polymerization with crosslink-
ers and homo-polymerization by themselves, as described in Figure 3.1, are two of the most fundamental and
important events in epoxy curing, irrespective of the activation or initiation method (e.g., thermally, anionic-ally,
cationic-ally, or combinations). If there are any universal mechanisms that apply to all formulations, these two cur-
ing responses must be among them. In most, if not all, applied epoxy coatings, the two paths co-exist and compete
until curing is complete for epoxy resin consumption.
Co-polymerization denotes a stepwise reaction that takes place between epoxies and crosslinkers, which is
commonly referred to as crosslinking. In this instance, epoxies must co-habit with an appropriate crosslinker
in the formulation. Nevertheless, homo-polymerization (or homo-curing) occurs exclusively among epoxies in
a chain-growth mode, with either anionic or cationic catalyzation, and without the involvement of crosslink-
ers. At some point, a combination of co- and homo-polymerization results in the complexity and intriguity of
epoxy crosslinking technologies. Advanced-level formulations rely on a thorough understanding of both curing
principles, not just the well-accepted co-polymerization as the de facto curing or crosslinking route; the equally
or more important epoxy homo-polymerization is sometimes overlooked as a side reaction by even experienced
formulators.
In one aspect, a polymeric network of cured epoxies is virtually always constructed by combining these two
competing processes, similar to the two sides of a coin. Crosslinker-free formulations created by using an anionic
catalyst (e.g., 2MI) in the absence of crosslinkers can lead to a robustly viable coating product (refer to relevant dis-
cussion in Chapter 6), given that epoxy homo-cures are the only curing mechanism involved; co-polymerization

alone, with the exception of autocatalytic amines as the crosslinker, rarely can unless properly catalyzed,
including autocatalyzation. Epoxy coating formulas and products are all about the cured microstructure, which
is composed of co-polymerization and homo-polymerization joined together. Without limiting to theory, epoxy
formulations, as governed by such parameters as the formulation index (that is, the stoichiometric ratio of epoxy
resins to crosslinkers; refer to Chapters 4 and 6) and the catalysts (types and loadings), are all about selecting
the ideal compositional proportions of co- and home-polymerizing segments in the bulk system. Specifically, the
formulation index (FI) drives primarily the proportion of co-polymerization, while the catalyst type and loading
level determine the proportion of homo-cures. Taking both co- and homo-polymerization into account, the FI for
applicable epoxy formulations should be at least 1: 1 and preferably larger.
In another aspect, there are at least three detailed questions to be asked and answered regarding the
co-existence of co-polymerization and homo-cures in epoxy systems, namely, i) which generates more crosslink-
ing or, alternatively, higher Tg? ii) which of the home- and co-cures reacts faster or earlier during a thermal
cure? and iii) whether 100% homo-cures (i.e., formulations without crosslinkers) provide the best flexibility
because ether linkages are flexible? The following are the answers, which are based on evidence, especially DSC
exothermic data (refer to details in Chapter 6): i) homo-polymerization does; ii) co-polymerization dominates
at lower temperature cure ahead of homo-polymerization, which leads to higher temperature cure during a
dynamic heating cycle; and iii) the best flexibility exists only in certain formulation-specific combinations.
3.1.1
Epoxy-amine (and -hydrazide) systems
When it comes to nucleophilic (lone-pair donating) and anionic amines and hydrazides that continue to be dom-
inant crosslinkers in epoxy coating products, they are clearly referred to as primary and secondary amines with
reactive hydrogens (as discussed in Chapter 2). As shown in Figure 3.2a, the relevant epoxy-amine ring-opening
co-polymerization proceeds stepwise and preferably with a catalyst to facilitate reaction advancements from
the rate-determining step to a transition state. Each >NH consumes one epoxide, generating a new secondary
hydroxyl group each time, until all epoxies, regardless of the form of monomers, resins, or derivatives, are
depleted. Crosslinked copolymers with a high MW are formed, and the original amines react integrally into the
network.

Figure 3.2
Generalized (a) epoxy-amine co-polymerization and (b) epoxy-epoxy homo-polymerization in epoxy-amine
systems.
Epoxy homo-polymerization, on the other hand, is unavoidable in epoxy-amine systems because tertiary amines
are formed from co-polymerization even if they are not necessarily freshly loaded, as shown in Figure 3.2b. Tertiary
amines, including imidazole, act as anionic catalysts to accelerate the formation of RO−intermediates, also known
as zwitterions [2], directing the rate-determining step in the entire ring-opening homo-curing process. Anionic
homo-polymerization produces linear backbones of bulk ether linkages (i.e., etherification) with no hydroxyl
formation.
Cure mechanisms of epoxy-DICY-imidazole systems where DICY and imidazole are used as the crosslinker and
the catalyst, respectively, are experimentally disclosed [3] in one embodiment (Figure 3.3a). DICY clearly acts
as a primary and secondary amine crosslinker independent of imidazole, generating a co-polymerized network
with newly formed hydroxyl groups. In another aspect, the newly formed hydroxyls are activated by imidazole,
producing RO−intermediates that initiate epoxy homo-polymerization (−O−), while reacting with cyano groups to
produce amides (−CO-NH−). The intensity of DICY’s FTIR fingerprint signal at 2,180 cm−1 is expected to decrease
and gradually disappear as the thermal curing process progresses and completes. As the reaction sequence shows,
co-polymerization appears to occur ahead of homo-polymerization in this case. Simultaneously, as proposed by
Farkas et al. [4], glycidyl ethers or epoxides directly interact with the ring nitrogen of 2MI at the third position
rather than with the hydroxyl groups, generating RO−intermediates for consequent anionic epoxy homo-cures
or ring-opening etherification. In this scenario, where DICY is not present, a portion of the imidazole acts as a
crosslinking agent that is eventually incorporated into the cured segments (Figure 3.3b).
Other epoxy-amine systems, such as those containing dihydrazides, are anticipated to have a similar curing com-
plexity based primarily on co- and homo-polymerization. In addition, there are formulation-dependent differences
in cure reactions; for instance, in epoxy-polyamide systems, additional insertion processes (refer to Figure 2.3 in
Chapter 2) take place to complement the flexibility and toughness.

Figure 3.3
The curing mechanisms of epoxy-DICY-imidazole systems are: (a) direct co-polymerization, indirect
homo-polymerization, and amide formation; and (b) 2E4MI-induced direct epoxy homo-polymerization.
The following are some additional technical implications: first, di-functional epoxies (for example, the leading
DGEBA grades) crosslink during homo-polymerization because epoxides develop four-fold functionalities via
RO−intermediates, as explicated in Figure 1.2 in Chapter 1; second, whenever an epoxy coating system is
catalyzed, homo-polymerization occurs and constitutes as part of the final cured network; third, epoxy-epoxy
homo-cures generate ether (−O−) linkages in linearly spreading polymer chains (Figures 3.2b/3.3b), which gen-
erally contribute to flexibility. However, a crosslinker-free formulation, that is, 100% epoxy homo-polymerization,
does not always provide the most flexibility, as data show (refer to relevant sections in Chapter 6). Instead,
there is always an optimal point at which appropriate amounts of co-polymerization and homo-polymerization
combined are best for a desired property, such as flexibility. Furthermore, pure co-polymerization, that is,
without any catalysts, is frequently, if not always, insufficiently robust in terms of mechanical performance.
Fourth, while homo-cures do not generate new secondary aliphatic hydroxyls (OHs), anionic-ally ring-opening
co-polymerization (of epoxies and crosslinkers) does (Figures 3.2/3.3). Nonetheless, when raw resins and reaction
conditions are controlled, primary (1∘) hydroxyls can be formed, as shown in Figure 2.5a in Chapter 2. These
newly produced OHs can then react with appropriate functional groups, such as isocyanates in the presence of
catalysts (refer to Figure 2.11 in Chapter 2), and cyano groups at elevated temperatures (Figure 3.3a). Fifth, and
anionic-ally, epoxy homo-polymerization can be initiated by imidazole, imidazole adducts, or urea derivatives in
addition to tertiary amines derived from epoxide-secondary amine reactions (e.g., the last step in Figure 3.2a) or
freshly loaded. Finally, and cationic-ally, epoxy homo-polymerization can be initiated equivalently by cationic
catalysts such as metal halide Lewis acids, onium salts (e.g., ETPPI), and organometallic complexes, which will
be discussed later in this chapter. Compatibility should be properly addressed in this situation of using inorganic
salts or the like.
3.1.2
Epoxy-phenolic systems
Industrial epoxy coatings that use a variety of phenolic resins as crosslinkers are likely the second-largest class
of formulations and chemistry platforms in terms of volume, trailing only those that use amine curing agents.

Simpliﬁed curing mechanisms of 2MI-catalyzed epoxy-phenolic systems.
Allied applications and end uses include, but are not limited to, liquid food packaging where resoles and novolacs
(refer to Figures 2.6b/c in Chapter 2) are the predominant crosslinkers; solvent-based laminates of insulated metal
substrates (IMS) where polyvinyl-based (refer to Figure 2.6a in Chapter 2) of controlled narrow MWs is suitable,
and functional powder coatings where BPA-based phenolics (refer to Figure 2.6d in Chapter 2) of varying MWs
and EW-PhOHs are the default or incumbent crosslinkers.
The use of catalysts in phenolic-crosslinked epoxy systems is preferred, optionally by anionic tertiary amines or
imidazole. Figure 3.4 depicts the associated crosslinking reactions, in which the imidazole facilitates the forma-
tion of phenolates in Step 1, which attack the glycidyls to undergo anionic-ally ring-opening co-polymerization in
Step 2. As a result, phenyl ether linkages and hydroxyls are formed. Meanwhile, homo-cures with direct imidazole
participation continue as usual, as already shown in Figure 3.3b, and the used catalyst, in this case 2MI, is partially
consumed during the curing reactions. According to BPA model studies conducted by Gagnebien et al. [2], branch-
ing reactions occur via the secondary OHs as initiated by both the imidazole catalyst and the RO−intermediates
(i.e., zwitterions; refer to Figure 3.2b), which partially coincide with homo-cures. Overall, the cured product has
a robust and balanced structural performance in terms of flexibility and toughness. Please keep in mind that the
cure mechanisms of epoxy-phenolic systems catalyzed by Group 5A elements such as nitrogen-containing tertiary
amines and phosphorus-containing TPP (triphenyl phosphine) of weak basicity may be more complicated than
described here, as thoroughly reviewed by Lin-Gibson et al. [5] and Biernath et al. [6].
3.1.3
Epoxy-ester systems
As previously stated, active esters are phenolic functional except for the substitution of the hydrogen atom in the
phenolic OH; similarly, heat-resistant matrix cyanate ester resins are phenolic functional except for the substitu-
tion of the hydrogen atom in the phenolic OH with a cyanide group. Consequently, active phenyl esters (e.g.,
HPC-8000 and SHC-5900; refer to Section 2.1.3 in Chapter 2) cure epoxies directly via a coined pathway as
depicted in Figure 3.4, producing bulk ether linkages along with individually new yet contingent esters in the
replacement of hydroxyl groups (refer to −OCOR’ in Table 2.3b in Chapter 2). Epoxy-ester systems are prefer-
ably catalyzed using anionic tertiary amines, such as DMAP, DMP-30, etc., imidazole, or imidazole adducts, etc.,
whenever possible. Therefore, catalyst-induced homo-polymerization of epoxies happens concurrently. In other
words, in order to meet resin demand, the formulation index for epoxy-active ester systems should be greater
than one, that is, epoxy resin-rich. When it comes to systems containing cyanate esters (CEs), which have an IR
fingerprint signal at ∼2,250 cm−1, and epoxies, which have an IR fingerprint signal at ∼915 cm−1, cyanate esters
(including mono-functional species) undergo trimerization under heat to form triazines [7] with an IR fingerprint
signal at ∼1,375 cm−1, which then react with epoxides to form oxazolines (refer to Figure 1.15e in Chapter 1 for
comparison) with an IR fingerprint signal at 1,760 cm−1 [8], as illustrated schematically in Figure 3.5a. In addition,
di-cyanate monomers can undergo a succession of cyclotrimerization reactions (i.e., self-crosslinking) at elevated
temperatures to produce triazine-containing prepolymers and thermosetting plastics, as depicted in Figure 3.5b.
Triazine structures in polymers improve both heat and water resistance.
As shown in Figure 3.5c, the reaction routes to the well-known BT (bismaleimide- or BMI-triazine) resins [9, 10]
are similarly intriguing. Specifically, CEs self-crosslink into triazines prior to interacting with BMIs to produce
hetero-six-membered rings with a high Tg close to 220 ∘C via a Diels−Alder reaction, allowing for enhanced heat
resistance. As heat-induced deformation of printed circuit boards (PCBs) becomes increasingly challenging to

manage, pyrimidine-containing BT resins are one of the most widely utilized resins in the fabrication of PCBs as
substrates for chips and chip-stacking. Cyanate ester-BMI systems may co-react to produce pyridines (Figure 3.5d),
as proposed by Lin et al. [11]. BT laminates and composites are typically derived from solvent-borne formulations.
Commercial CE resins include, among others, Primaset PT by Lonza and AroCy XU 371 by Huntsman. CEs are
commonly catalyzed by metal acetylacetonates at less than 0.2 phr.
In Chapter 7 of phenolic coatings, the relevant applied chemistry and formulations of BMIs will be exam-
ined in depth. Other epoxy-ester vehicles, such as epoxy alkyl silane ester coupling agents as adhesion promoters,
for instance Silquest® A-187 (Momentive Performance Materials), are also beneficial to coatings and adhesives,

without limiting to theory and within intended scopes. Adhesion and adhesion promotion will be thoroughly
discussed in Chapter 10.
3.1.4
Epoxy-anhydride systems
As reviewed in Chapter 2, anhydrides, including polyanhydrides, are a class of non-amine and acidic (or cationic)
crosslinkers for epoxies. Similar to other systems discussed, the curing reactions for epoxy-anhydride systems can
be catalyzed by weakly anionic catalysts such as tertiary amines and imidazole. Figure 3.6 depicts the associ-
ated cure mechanisms under imidazole catalyzation [12]. Summarily, the substituted 2-ethyl-4-methyl imidazole
(2E4MI) aids in the formation of an RO−intermediate from an anhydride molecule under heat, which then
ring-opens an epoxide before orderly incorporating a new anhydride molecule and another epoxide, and the
crosslinking continues in this manner until terminated by hydroxyl impurities like water or depletion of all epoxy
reactants. In the end, new ester bonds are formed between glycidyl oxides and phthalic anhydrides (Figure 3.6a).
In addition, the secondary OH groups on epoxy resins readily react with anhydrides to form carboxyl (COOH)
groups (Figure 3.6b), which then continue to react with epoxide via an epoxy-carboxyl pathway (refer to Table
2.3e in Chapter 2). Such collateral reactions provide epoxy-anhydride systems with superior performance, such
as chemical resistance. According to Liu et al. [13], a novel UV-curable resin was developed by leveraging these
chemistries to modify an epoxy cresol novolac resin (ECN; refer to Figure 1.3d in Chapter 1) with cholic acids,
tetrahydrophthalic anhydrides, and glycidyl methacrylates.
Considering this cure mechanism and the inherent epoxy homo-cures under anionic catalysis, we can draw
several technical implications on epoxy-anhydride formulations. First, a formulation index of epoxy resins
to anhydrides greater than one is applicable and preferred, regardless of whether the formulation is liquid

3 Epoxy Curing Reactions
(obviously solvent-borne since anhydrides are more solid and have a higher melting point) or powder. Second,
epoxy-anhydride coatings should be excellent at resisting acids due to the acidic nature of anhydrides. Third, the
ester bonds created during crosslinking are structurally susceptible to detrimental breakdown owing to hydrolysis,
which is allegedly accelerated at elevated temperatures and in an alkaline environment. Ester hydrolysis, or
saponification, is a defect of polyesters or similar substances (e.g., alkyds) that react with water or a hydroxide
ion and decompose into a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. Last but not the least, and relevant to anhydrides for
applicable formulations, compatibility and the homogenization issue should always be evaluated and addressed
for 1K liquid or powder systems.
Epoxy-active phenyl ester systems discussed previously are likewise concerned with ester hydrolysis and
long-term stability, as confirmed by the results of hot water soak adhesion (HWA) tests conducted at
95 ∘C (refer to the relevant active ester case in Chapter 6). Additionally, epoxy/COOH hybrids, including
TGIC/COOH-polyester systems, exhibit abundant ester (−COO−) linkages in their cured products (partially
mimicking Step 2 in Figures 3.4/3.6a). Regarding catalysts for epoxy/COOH formulations, cationically compatible
salt complexes and the like such as ETPPI are commonly used; however, as stated previously, slightly anionic
tertiary amines and imidazoles such as 2PI turn out to be more effective (i.e., faster gel and cure) than the cationic
ones at the same loading level while exhibiting even better compatibility (perhaps due to solubility) that aids in
the elimination of surface cratering defects.
Back to cure reaction discussion, when it comes to crosslinking epoxies with Mannich bases including phenalka-
mines (refer to Tables 2.2c/2.3c in Chapter 2), there are apparently dual-curing reactions pertaining to respective
phenyl hydroxyls (refer to Figures 3/4) and amines (refer to Figure 3.2a) taking place in parallel, in synergic addi-
tion to epoxy homo-cures (refer to Figure 3.2b), irrespective of whether a catalyst is also applied.
Understanding fundamental epoxy crosslinking reactions and mechanisms on a molecular scale is very con-
structive, but it does not necessarily lead to effective formulations on a macro-mass level immediately. As always,
there is a gap between theory, which focuses on hard concepts, and practice, which focuses on soft skills. Epoxy
curing is a dynamic process of building a heterogeneous network with epoxy homo-cures and epoxy-hardener
co-polymerizing blocks concurrently; these two drastically different curing reactions compete against one another.
The overall and ultimate coating properties, including Tg, flexibility, cohesive toughness, and elasticity, are largely
determined by the ratio of these two reacted segments as well as how and to what extent they are intertwined as
a single bulk system. The formulation index (FI), that is, the stoichiometric ratio of resins to hardeners in moles,
dictates the proportions of these two structural components in the cured network, typically under catalysis. Con-
sequently, an optimal FI in terms of one or more specifical properties (such as flexibility, toughness, and/or others)
often exists in a narrow or broad range, if not always. Considering finished products, sometimes apparent dispar-
ities in bulk physical properties, either favorable or unfavorable, appear in response to even minute variations in
FIs and other formulation parameters that define the entanglement architecture of the cured polymer chains. In a
sense, hardener-free (i.e., at an infinite FI) and anionic-ally catalyzed epoxy systems appear to represent an extreme
scenario, in that epoxy homo-cures account for 100% of the crosslinked system and epoxy-hardener interactions
are completely absent.
3.2
Cationic and UV-Curing Systems
Epoxy homo-polymerization can also be cationic-ally catalyzed by using a class of salts and complexes following a
chain-growth mechanism, as depicted in Figure 3.7, in the presence of boron trifluoride (BF3), an amine complex,
acting as the initiator [14]. Huntsman Accelerator DY 9577, distributed by Krayden, is an example of a commercial
BCl3•amine (MEA) product used in place of BF3. Specifically, oxonium ions as the “actual” catalysts (i.e., not
by virtue of liberated Lewis acids) are formed under heat and/or UV to drive the etherification of epoxies; the
propagated polymer chain concludes with polyether linkages and one singlet hydroxyl group on one side of the
entire backbone. This crosslinking pathway is universally applicable to heat, UV, or both as the energy source

outside of formulation, in conjunction with one or more cationic catalyst originators (i.e., the pertinent salts or
complexes) within formulation. Clearly, crosslinker-free formulations can be developed using not only anionic
catalysts such as imidazole adducts but also cationic catalysts such as onium salts.
Cationic and UV-curing formulations are typically devoid of standard hardeners but frequently contain chain
transfer agents or modifiers such as polyols. In addition, UV cationic curing systems are formulated to contain
aliphatic and, more preferably, cycloaliphatic epoxies that are resistant to yellowing rather than standard epox-
ies such as BPA-based that are susceptible to UV degradation. In hybrid systems, vinyl esters or vinyl ethers are
combined with epoxies to produce synergistic performance, as vinyls undergo UV curing via free radicals simul-
taneously. Dual catalysts composed of cationic salts and organic peroxides co-exist in the formulations without,
in this instance, without interfering with one another.
According to Verschueren et al. [15], UV cationic cure technology offers excellent adhesion to metals and certain
difficult substrates, such as polyolefins and other plastics, in addition to low shrinkage and good flexibility. Onium
salts and similar compounds produce a cationic proton, which then forms a reactive cationic species through
the ring opening of an epoxy moiety prior to opening the next epoxide monomer. Neutralization of the cationic
species by an anionic species, such as impurities, causes chain termination. Chain transfer can also occur, such
as with hydroxyl-functional materials such as alcohols. Transfer reactions are frequently used in cationic systems,
especially UV-curing systems of cycloaliphatic epoxies, to improve cured properties such as flexibility, toughness,
etc., by introducing polyols or similar modifiers, as shown in Figure 3.8 [16–18]. In essence, chain transfer reactions

formulations where chain transfer agents (such as Lonza DETDA 80, Ethacure 100, etc.) are properly incorporated
to achieve a balance of hardness and elasticity.
Thus far, the most important cure mechanisms of epoxies in terms of miscellaneous curing agents, including
cationic chemistry, have been gathered and elucidated, as summarized in Table 3.1, where isocyanates serve as
a benchmark. To enhance insights in support of applied formulations, which is the objective of this work, the
following specific questions must be answered: i) how would crosslinker-free epoxy formulations behave with
respect to anionic versus cationic catalysis? ii) how would dual catalysts influence the overall catalytic effects of

3.2 Cationic and UV-Curing Systems
73
formulations, including anionic and cationic kinds, when employed in combination? and iii) what is the actual
compatibility of not only dual catalysts (such as tertiary amines and onium salts), but also systems formulated
with anionic (such as amines) and cationic (such as organic acids) curing agents? The limited fact, as described
in previous chapters, is that imidazoles (such as 2MI and 2PI) can drop-in replace ETPPI or organometallic com-
plexes in epoxy/COOH formulations without any problems, actually improving performance in terms of cure and
defect-free appearance. These questions are rephrased or recaptured in the Recaps and Highlights section, and
each will be answered in Chapter 6 using experimental data as quantitative evidence.
Debrief A Base-catalyzed crosslinking reactions
The majority of polymer coating systems are either anionic (nucleophilic) or cationic (electrophilic) in favor of
crosslinking processes, which are commonly base- or acid-catalyzed, respectively. Nevertheless, not all of them
involve the transfer of electrons between two species, as is characteristic of reduction-oxidation (redox) reactions.
From a redox perspective, anionicity refers to negatively charged and to be oxidized, whereas cationicity refers
to positively charged and to be reduced, emulating the anode and cathode of a battery (refer to Figure 10.18 in
Chapter 10). Depending on the curing agents (crosslinkers and catalysts) used, epoxies are adaptable to both sce-
narios. Regarding base-catalyzed crosslinking, such as epoxy-amine and hydrazide systems with primary amines
(−NH2) and/or secondary amines (−NH−) as the bulk crosslinker, as discussed (refer to Subsection 2.2.2.2 in
Chapter 2), acrylates (such as TMPTA) and similar compounds, when incorporated, can accelerate curing speed
while enhancing performance, such as flexibility, if the acrylate-functional ingredient(s) are properly selected (e.g.,
Ancarez 2364 in Table 6.2 in Chapter 6). The chemistry is typical Michael Addition, which is essentially a con-
jugate or nucleophilic addition rather than redox. As depicted in Figure 3.9, Michael Addition is an illustration
of a base-catalyzed reaction involving amines (nucleophilic and electron-rich) as the electron donor and acrylates
(C=C or vinyl functional that is electron deficient) as the electron acceptor in the system.
Specifically, acrylates react with primary amines to generate secondary amine-acrylate adducts (the first step in
Figure 3.9), which subsequently react with either acrylates to form tertiary amine-acrylate adducts (the 2a step in
Figure 3.9) or epoxies to form tertiary amine-epoxy-acrylate prepolymers (the 2b step in Figure 3.9). Please take
note of the following facts about anionic epoxy-amine (including hydrazide)-acrylate systems: i) Michael Addi-
tion reactions take place at low temperatures, form films, and produce good adhesion on a variety of substrates,
including metals; ii) acrylate resins should be added to Part A with the epoxy resins of 2K liquid formulations;
iii) Michael Addition requires an anionic environment, preferably a strong base, and is therefore perfectly com-
patible with epoxy-amine or hydrazide systems in which amines serve as strong bases; iv) acrylate acceleration

is inapplicable to non-amine or only tertiary amine-containing epoxy formulations; and v) Michael Addition cur-
ing technology represents one of the NISO (non-isocyanate) routes to functional formulations and applications.
Base-catalyzed Michael Addition reactions are ubiquitous for miscellaneous applications (refer to Figures 8.5a/8.6
in Chapter 8), and they are discovered to even occur in natural plants, as recently reported by Bai et al. [19],
in which a PPO-catalyzed and BBL2-mediated Michael Addition pathway between caffeoyl-CoA-putrescine and
(Z)-3-hexenal produces CPH, which serves as the plants’ defense chemistry against attacks from leafhoppers. The
trend in implementing film-forming Michael Addition chemistry is to use malonates, acetoacetates, and other
compounds containing active hydrogen atoms (refer to Figure 4.1d in Chapter 4) as the electron donor under a
base catalyst for 2K industrial coatings rather than amines (which are overly reactive and corrosive).
Still specifically, mono-vinyl-functional acetoacetoxy ethyl methacrylate (AAEM, also with active methylene
and carbonyl groups, circled in pink, Figure 3.10a) and diacetone acrylamide (DAAM, also with an end carbonyl
function, circled in pink, Figure 3.10b), for example, commercially available from Gantrade and Eastman, are
designed for 1K waterborne (WB) acrylic paints and coatings. The resulting formulations are suited for indoor and
outdoor application on wood, metal, and concrete surfaces and are self-curing at room temperature. In addition
to standard Michael Addition and co-polymerization with other acrylic and methacrylic monomers, AAEM and
DAAM [20], both of which contain functional carbonyl (R2C=O) groups, react at room temperature with diamines
or hydrazides (refer to Figure 2.2c and Table 2.1 in Chapter 2), producing imines (>C=N−) while releasing water,
a process known as keto-hydrazide crosslinking. In fact, keto-hydrazide chemistry is primarily acid catalyzed
(to be detailed in the following section), as illustrated in Figure 3.11a, favored by the loss of water, resulting in
ketimine rather than enamine (>C=CR-NH−) linkages (refer to Figure 4.1b in Chapter 4 and Figure 3.10a),
which represents an excellent strategy for WB acrylic latexes [21–25], also captured in an attentive review of
self-crosslinking emulsion systems [26]. Notably, the acetoacetoxy function in polar AAEM is crosslinkable with
diamines, resulting in enamine intermediates while simultaneously releasing water (Figure 3.10a), which is also
film forming. In addition, the chelating properties of the acetoacetoxy moiety or the two carbonyl groups in AAEM
enable interactions with metal substrates to enhance adhesion, as does the methylene group’s ability to undergo
base-catalyzed Michael Addition crosslinking with, for example, acrylates. It has been reported that epoxy-amine
coatings incorproating acetoacetoxy-functionalized components enhance performance, including a reduction in
crosslinking or drying times [27]. Applied formulations can also benefit from click thiol-Michael step-growth
addition reactions (refer to Figure 9.20c in Chapter 9). Both carbon-carbon Michael Addition chemistry and
thiol-carbon Michael Addition chemistry are thoroughly reviewed by Mather et al. and Nair et al. [28, 29]. In
particular, epoxy-thiol condensation, as illustrated in Table 2.3f, is catalyzed by a base or a strong base such as
triazabicyclodecene tetraphenylborate (TBD-HBPh4). The nucleophilic ring-opening reaction of epoxides (FTIR
915 cm−1) forged by thiols (FTIR 2,575 cm−1) proceeds rapidly, resulting in the formation of secondary hydroxyl
groups (FTIR 3,485 cm−1) and a relatively low Tg of 55 ∘C, as reported by Konuray et al. [30].

subject to hydrolysis), all under acidic conditions.
Other than an upgraded Michael Addition reaction (also refer to Debrief C in Chapter 8), the active methylene
(−CH2−) group in AAEM and other similar compounds such as acetoacetate (refer to Figure 4.1d in Chapter 4)
is capable of additional reactive pathways, such as crosslinking isocyanates at room temperature to form amides
(−CO-NH−) instead of regular urethane (−O-CO-NH−) linkages, crosslinking aldehydes (R-CHO) at room tem-
perature, which will be discussed in the following debrief, crosslinking melamine to produce new C-C bonds
rather than ether (−C-O-C−) linkages when melamine is crosslinked by OHs, and coupling diazonium salts to
create azo-dyes [31].
Debrief B Acid-catalyzed crosslinking reactions
Acid-curing coatings are another widely used coating technology. In addition to epoxy systems that are either
anionically or cationically catalyzed and Michael Addition reactions that are base-catalyzed, acid-catalyzed
crosslinking systems are readily accessible and implemented for a variety of coating formulations and
industrial applications, such as traditional UF (urea-formaldehyde), MF (melamine-formaldehyde), and
UMF (urea-melamine-formaldehyde) polymeric products, which will be discussed separately in Chapter 8
within the context of extended formulations and applications. Carbodiimides crosslinking COOH-containing
resins, polyaziridines likewise crosslinking COOH-containing resins and polymers, and conjugated aldehydes
crosslinking vinyl esters are herein provided as examples of straightforward cationic or acidic chemistry for the
purposes of applied comparison and implementation. Due to their corrosive nature, aqueous coating systems

76
3 Epoxy Curing Reactions
containing free and strong inorganic acids should be used with caution on metal substrates such as steel
and iron.
First and foremost, possibly the most advanced development in technology for acrylic emulsion cure chemistry,
keto-hydrazide reactions, as exemplified in Figure 3.11a using DAAM and ADH, are essentially acid catalyzed
with the formation of ketimine moieties (circled in blue), despite the fact that dihydrazide monomers (e.g., ADH)
are anionic by themselves. This ambient-temperature crosslinking system, with DAAM up to 5% by weight in the
acrylic copolymer and “in-can” storage stability as a critical element of this technology, enhances film mechanical
properties, stain, water, chemical, and block resistance, toughness and impact resistance, scrub resistance, and
adhesion for a variety of high-performance WB paints and coatings applications such as architecture, wood, and
concrete surfaces, and more.
Second, an increasing number of amino and related systems constituted of, for example, an amino resin
and a hydroxyl-functional resin use an acid monomer or prepolymer or, more commonly, an acid catalyst
(such as p-TSA and NH4Cl) to accelerate crosslinking. Subsection 8.3 and Debriefs A and B of Chapter 8
explain additional curing chemistry and formulations of acid−catalyzed amino systems. In comparison to 2K
polyurethane (PUR) coatings, these film forming and low-temperature curing coatings have the advantages
of hard and wear-resistant paint films, high heat, water, and cold resistance of paint films, good transparency,
good yellowing resistance, and being free of isocyanates, making them suitable for wood substrates, particularly
furniture wood. However, in high-humidity environments and tropical climates, such acid-curing coatings are
susceptible to blushing, severely limiting their application. Solvent-borne acid-curing coating compositions
containing a hydroxyl-functional resin at 20–69% by weight, an amino compound at 20–50% by weight, and an
acid catalyst at 0.1–10% by weight are reported [32] to resolve the issue of blushing when applied in highly humid
settings, even with humidity levels of 85% or higher, by adding a specific amount of an amino-functional silane
at 0.2–2.0% by weight in accordance with ASTM D1735.
Carbodiimides with -N=C=N- linkages and a characteristic FTIR peak at 2,130 cm−1 crosslink polymers and
resins containing carboxyl groups but not hydroxyl groups, producing active esters (−COO-C(=NR)-NH−) that
can continue to react with amines, if necessary, to form crosslinked amides and urea byproducts, as shown in
Figure 3.11b. For labeling or crosslinking to carboxylic acids, carbodiimide compounds offer the most popular
and adaptable approach. 2K liquid coatings comprising polycarboxylic acid and at least one aliphatic polycar-
bodiimide cure rapidly under ambient conditions, as disclosed by Cannas [33]. The most readily available and
commonly used carbodiimides are the water-soluble EDC (aliphatic, Figure 3.10c) for aqueous crosslinking and
the water-insoluble DCC (cyclic, Figure 3.10d, Actylis) for non-aqueous organic synthesis. Modified polycarbodi-
imide compounds as a crosslinking agent of, for example, COOH (not COOR)-functional polyester and/or acrylic
coatings, such as Desmodur XP2802 from Covestro and the Carbodilite series from Nisshinbo Chemical/GSI Exim
America, are suitable for wood, metal, plastic, and cement board applications [34], in addition to leather finish. It is
worth mentioning that 1K PUR systems, which comprise malonic acid ester-blocked isocyanate prepolymers, are
intended to be competitive in leather coating [35]. Carbodilite E-05 (41.3% solids) as a WB crosslinker of carboxyl
groups containing acids and resins improves adhesion to a substrate, as reported in [36]. Note that carbodiimide
interacts with 1∘and 2∘amines under heat (e.g., ≥120 ∘C) and with Ph-OHs (with similar or greater reactivity
than COOHs), but not with aliphatic OHs.
Crosslinking of carboxylic groups (COOHs) by polyaziridines, that is, polyethylenimines with cyclic −N< func-
tions, is also acid catalyzed, film forming, ambiently curable (heat accelerates reactions), and competitive with
carbodiimides. As depicted in Figure 3.11c, reactions take place between the active hydrogen of COOHs and
the poly-functional aziridine. Di-functional PZBI-25 (WB, 80–120 ∘C activation, for adhesion improvement) and
tri-functional PZ-28/-33, as supplied commercially by PolyAziridine LLC, are suited for wood and leather coatings,
among other applications.

3.2 Cationic and UV-Curing Systems
77
The reaction illustrated in Figure 3.11d represents a system of alkyl vinyl esters crosslinked by benzaldehydes
(which are structurally conjugated), forming a film by cationic co-polymerization with weak Lewis-base-assisting
initiation [37]. The invention [38] discloses an inexpensive boron trihalide complex having the formula of BX3 •
x ROH (instead of GaCl3) as the catalyst. Notably, primary amines, such as hydrazides (R-CO-NH-NH2; refer to
Figure 2.2c in Chapter 2) and alkoxyamines (R-CH2-O-NH2), are the most important aldehyde-reactive functional
groups for incorporation into synthetic labeling reagents and crosslinkers, leading to imines, often referred to as
Schiff bases (R2C=NR’; refer to Figure 3.11a). The terminal amino groups in these two types of molecules are
much more nucleophilic (than protein amines), and they spontaneously react with aldehydes to generate stable
hydrazone (−CO-NH-N=CH−) and oxime (−O-N=CH−) bonds [39], respectively, while aniline (C6H5-NH2) acts
as an effective catalyst. In addition, aldehydes crosslink or bridge AAEMs (refer to Figure 3.10a) by reacting with
the methylene group at room temperature and releasing water. As versatile and prospective natural resources for
cationic polymerization, aldehydes, such as formaldehyde-free and bi-functional glyoxal (refer to Debrief B in
Chapter 8), can be leveraged to formulate high-performance coating products.
Finally, other acid-curing systems of applied coating value propositions (such as low-temperature cure)
include, but are not limited to, TGIC-COOH-functional polyesters (refer to Table 2.3e in Chapter 2 and Debrief
B in Chapter 6), GMA-carboxylic acids (or COOH-functional resins; refer to Figures 2.5a/b in Chapter 2),
ETPPI-catalyzed epoxies with or without weakly acidic phenolic crosslinkers (refer to Subsection 6.2.8 in
Chapter 6), hybrids that refer to epoxy and COOH-functional polyesters, and benzoxazines (refer to discussion
in Chapter 7), among others.
Debrief C Carbene insertion reactions
As depicted in Figure 3.12, both singlet and triplet carbenes can undergo insertion into inert C-H bonds to form
new C-C-H bonds at completely unfunctionalized centers [40], and these highly reactive carbenes can result from
diazirine precursors exposed to UV light or heat, as well as diazo decomposition [41]. This is the primary reason
why bis-diazirine is regarded as a universal crosslinker (refer to Table 2.2k in Chapter 2, when n = 1). These
insertion reactions can also occur to practically any N-H, O-H, or S-H bonds, making them very useful in coatings
such as epoxy, acrylate, and polyurethane systems where diazirines can serve as reactive crosslinkers via carbene
insertion.
Carbenes crosslink aliphatic polymers (such as polyethylene or PE and polypropylene or PP) with C-H bonds
but without functional groups [42], making them unique and ideal for covalently priming low-surface-energy
TPO (thermoplastic olefin) substrates to improve adhesion (refer to Chapter 10 for detailed discussion). As a
result of the same carbene insertion chemistry, polyfluorinated bis-diazirines (such as n = 4 and 8 in Table 2.2k of
Chapter 2) have been reported as molecular adhesives with long-chain flexibility [43]. According to Xlynx Mate-
rials, a company that specializes in diazirine-based products, diazirine-based adhesives and primers are effective
on the following substrates: LDPE, HDPE, PP, PTFE, PVC, PS (polystyrene), PCL (polycaprolactone), polyisoprene
elastomers, PURs, and others (glass, ceramics, wood, paper, textiles, leather, elastomers, and a few metals).

3 Epoxy Curing Reactions
Debrief D Additional understanding of ring-opening reactions
Epoxy systems are primarily about oxirane-ring-opening reactions under acidic, basic, and/or catalyzed con-
ditions, whereas CEs and other curing chemistries (such as Diels−Alder reactions; refer to Figure 7.15a in
Chapter 7) are primarily about ring-forming reactions under heat and/or catalysis, as afore elaborated. Within
the context of epoxies, ring-opening polymerization of epoxides in the presence of crosslinkers, on the one
hand, constitutes co-polymerization that generates a highly branched network for cohesive toughness with one
aliphatic secondary−OH group produced at each step-growth step (refer to Figure 3.2a). Epoxide ring-opening
polymerization in the absence of crosslinkers, on the other hand, results in homo-polymerization or epoxy
self-crosslinking; this can be achieved through anionic catalysis using a tertiary amine (Figure 3.13a), imidazole
(Figure 3.13b), or cationic catalysis using an onium salt or complex (Figure 3.13c). The chain-growth propagation
leads to the formation of a highly linear network that provides bulk flexibility while producing either zero
or only one aliphatic secondary-OH group. As a class of weakly anionic catalysts containing two heterocyclic
tertiary amines (>N−), imidazole adducts are expected to behave similarly to tertiary amines in that they will
not produce any OH groups. Crosslinker-free formulations, including synergistic dual systems consisting of an
anionic imidazole adduct and a cationic salt, will be described in depth in Subsections 6.2.1/2/8 and part of
Debrief B of Chapter 6.
Within a broader context of applied chemistry and materials, ring-opening polymerization can be utilized
to create stable biomaterials. As shown in Figure 3.14a, polyphosphazenes are synthesized by ring opening
of trimers and nucleophilic sequential substitution prior to blend fabrication [44], if needed. Accordingly,
the miscible polyphosphazene blend contains an underlying N=P backbone, organic side groups in addi-
tion to PLGA and peptides, and hydrogen bonding, making it a stable, biocompatible, and biodegradable
polymer system with regenerative engineering potential. Alternatively, fluoropolysphazenes (Figure 3.14b)
with anti-coagulant activity can form biocompatible nanocoatings via covalent interactions with heparin, as
reported by Marin et al. [45]. In another inspiring embodiment (Figure 3.14c), the hydrazonyl sultone, a novel
biorthogonal reagent, cleverly opens into the nitrile imine and performs the click reaction when meeting an
eligible alkyne [46, 47].

Recaps and Highlights
Epoxy-amine or -hydrazide co-polymerization does not necessarily need a catalyst, such as a tertiary amine or
imidazole, to proceed rapidly once activated because primary amines are autocatalytic. Co-polymerization with
crosslinkers (ring-opening polyaddition) and homo-polymerization (ring-opening etherification) predominate in
epoxy curing reactions, regardless of the specific crosslinkers and catalysts employed in formulations. Appropri-
ate combinations of step-growth co-cures and chain-growth homo-cures determine the structural performance
of epoxy formulations, particularly those with aromatic moieties required for specific applications. Table 3.2 and
Figures 3.13a/b provide an overview of the anionic curing mechanisms of epoxies. Figure 3.13c and Table 3.3 sum-
marize the cationic homo-polymerization mechanisms of epoxies. 100% cationic curing systems may not have as
good mechanical properties as 100% anionic curing systems. The mechanical properties of crosslinker-free formu-
lations catalyzed anionically by 3∘amines or imidazole may be superior to those of formulations cured using a
purely cationic mechanism.
Figure 3.15 provides a schematic summary and concise description of epoxies in terms of epoxide reactivities
in relation to all discussed curing agents and reactions, including cationic homo-polymerization. Each number

represents a crosslinker-specific pathway. For instance, the route “3” (where R3 = COOH) includes not only TGIC
(refer to Table 2.3e) and glycidyl esters (refer to Figure 2.5 in Chapter 2), but also glycidyl carbamates that lead to
the formation of OH-functional oxazolidones (refer to Figure 1.15b). Notably, diazirines (refer to Table 2.2k) likely
crosslink epoxies via carbene insertion reactions in cationic UV systems as a photoreactive crosslinker.
Overall, epoxy homo-polymerization is inspiring, including the cationic catalyzation chemistry, but there are
many unknowns concerning crosslinker-free and dual catalysts to be figured out for allied coating formulation and

application. These questions include i) the viability and structural performance of crosslinker-free formulations,
which represent 100% homo-polymerization; ii) whether epoxy homo-curing systems utilizing anionic catalysts
perform comparably to or better than those utilizing cationic catalysts; and iii) how compatible or incompatible
anionic tertiary amines and cationic salts are in one-pot systems. As a result, as shown in Table 3.4, “Standards”
as inputs for varying reactive compositions (resins, crosslinkers, and catalysts) and “Modifications and innova-
tions” as outputs for formulations are proposed for investigational execution. Using experimental data, Chapter 6
will describe in detail their robustness as viable coating alternatives, compatibility, structural performance, and
rheo-kinetic behaviors.
In summary, with the exception of certain features such as low-temperature cure, epoxy systems with at
least homo- and co-polymerizations are more comprehensively synergistic and preferred over other base- and
acid-catalyzed systems with only one main polymerizing reaction. Importantly, final coating performance is
determined by structure-property relationships, which are in turn driven by formulation-specific crosslinking
reactions. More importantly, crosslinking reactions must be associated with film formation in order to be useful
for coating formulation and application, which applies to all base- and/or acid-catalyzed systems, including
epoxies.
Finally, and remarkably, it is reported that universal dynamic crosslinking and crosslinkers (UDCs), such
as bis(diazirine) coupled with disulfide, can surmount incompatibility among plastic mixtures for one-pot
recycling [48]. Dynamic crosslinking is another promising technique for producing epoxy and non-epoxy
(such as polydimethylsiloxane- or PDMS-based) vitrimers with reprocessability, recyclability, and self-healing
properties [49, 50].

Concepts, Utilities, Methods, and Techniques
Basic concepts and underlying platform technologies relating to coatings, such as the important stoichiometry
considerations in epoxy formulations, are described in this chapter. Certain industrial applications, such as steel
corrosion resistance, laminated substrates for manufacturing high heat-resistant 5/6G telecom modules and IGBT
(insulated-gate bipolar transistor) units applicable to high-speed trains and new energy EVs (electric vehicles),
and high-pressure resistant hydrogen barrier coatings, for which functional epoxy coatings play an increasingly
substantial role as materials, are reviewed with the intention of highlighting their increasing significance. Methods
and techniques for testing and characterizing coatings in industrial settings are also selectively elaborated upon.
4.1
Liquids versus Powders
Table 4.1 categorizes paints and coatings, such as epoxy-based systems, into platforms of liquids, electro-coatings
(i.e., e-coatings), and powders based on their physical forms, solids contents, and VOC (volatile organic compound)
levels. In accordance with whether solvents, co-solvents, or water are utilized as carriers, liquids are further clas-
sified as solvent based (SB), high solids (HS), solvent free, or waterborne (WB). E-coating, often referred to as
e-dipping or e-priming, is either an anodic (base, e.g., an amine, pH 8.0–11.0) or a cathodic (acid, pH 4.0–6.5)
liquid solution with insoluble solids of, for example, 10% by weight dispersed as micelles in water of, for example,
84% by weight, and with solubilizers and solvents of 3% each as the remaining compositions. One gallon of liq-
uid covers 1,604 square feet at a thickness of 1 mil. Powders, which are also solvent-free or comprise 100 percent
solids, might be re-classified as thermosets versus thermoplastics in terms of chemistry or as decorative (mainly
polyesters, including TGIC/COOH-functional) versus protective (mostly epoxies) in terms of functionality. The
US and global markets for decorative paints and coatings, including liquids and powders, were valued at USD
20.9 billion and USD 76.6 billion in 2022, respectively [1].
Film formation inherently involves self-flowing and leveling under heat or not, co-enhanced by evaporation
and/or coalescence for SB and WB and by gelation and curing for thermosetting powders, regardless of whether
the material is a liquid or powder. E-coating is capable of uniform thin-film control by the applied current and is
therefore ideal for priming; the higher the solids content of liquids, the higher the upper film thickness limits for
liquids; powders allow the widest range of film thickness from 2.5 μm (or 0.1 mils, e.g., for automotive finishes)
up to 6,000 μm (or ∼240 mils, e.g., for busbars). Generally speaking, the particle sizes of powders, particularly for
decorative grades, are D90 at 65–75 μm and D10 at 7–12 μm for thin films (e.g., 1–6 mils), standard D90 at 75–85 μm
and D10 at 8–13 μm, as well as D90 at 110–130 μm and D10 at 10–15 μm for thick or textured finishes. Drying times
and pot life for liquids are typically short, with the exception of e-coatings, which have an indefinite shelf life.
Powder coatings’ shelf life is formulation dependent. Epoxy powders or fusion bonded epoxies (FBEs) outperform
liquids or e-coatings if properly formulated, at least in terms of flexibility, because FBEs can use high-molecular
weight (MW) resins that readily melt under heat but are difficult to dissolve in liquid coatings’ solvents. The high

flexibility of Type 7 or even Type 9 epoxy resins is one of the reasons why SB food packaging and can coatings
typically employ them.
SB coatings use solvents as the carrier to uniformly admix ingredients, and the formulation is predominantly
volume-based, including an explanation of the PVC (pigment volume concentration) concept, which involves both
mass and density, in contrast to powders, which are solvent-free and use heat to melt and homogenize components,
and the formulation of powder coatings is exclusively weight-based (density is very secondary unless coverage is
involved). Solvent-free coatings use self-contained liquids and solubilities of resins for compounding; e-coatings
are essentially WB but are applied to substrates using electricity. WB, HS, and powders are VOC (volatile organic
compound)-free or low-VOC systems. For instance, primers and floor paints typically contain 100 g/l or less of
VOCs, reflective wall coatings less than 50 g/l, and 1 K WB acrylic DTM (direct-to-metal) coatings typically contain
25 g/l or less.
4.1.1
Solvent-based coatings
According to market data [2], solvent-based (SB) coatings continue to dominate the global market, including all
1/2K technologies for automotive, industrial, and printing inks, which reached USD 21.06 billion in 2020 and
are projected to reach USD 26.27 billion by 2025 at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 4%. The market
segment with the largest share is architectural paints and coatings, followed by general industrial, wood coatings,
protective and marine, automotive, coil, and food packaging. As of the year 2020, wood coatings accounted for
approximately 7% of global varnishes and paints (AP ∼46%, NA 27%, EU 17%) and continue to grow steadily,
driven in part by the emergence of do-it-yourself (DIY) projects and smaller, less expensive furniture. In terms
of platforms within the purview of wood coatings, SB leads with a 50% share of EUR 3.9 billion, followed by
HS with EUR 1.9 billion, WB with EUR 1.6 billion, radiation cure with EUR 0.6 billion, and powders with EUR
0.04 billion, respectively, where radiation and powders have a small but niche existence. SB coatings continue to
hold the leading position, but the market is gradually or rapidly shifting to WB coatings and powders to address

VOC footprints on a global scale. For example, alkyds (oil and fatty acid-modified polyesters) have held the leading
position in SB coatings for decades, but they are currently transforming to acrylic technologies (primarily based
on acrylate and methacrylate monomers) due to a trending shift from SB to WB [3]. Alkyds are susceptible to
hydrolysis, cracking, and embrittlement; therefore, they are supposedly not used to coat galvanized steel.
SB platforms, which can be utilized as primers, topcoats, and other coating compositions, are gradually migrat-
ing to HS (e.g., 60–85% solids) and ultra-HS (e.g., 85–90% solids) formulations, such as 1K (siloxane), 2K (PUR,
SB, WB), and 3K (PUR clearcoat, e.g., for anti-graffiti). For instance, Sherwin-Williams’ Sumadur 137, or Acrolon®
C137V2, is an HS epoxy-amine product for offshore coatings. Regarding rail container linings as another example,
exterior coating warranties are as follows: DTM epoxies 12–16 years, DTM acrylics (WB) 15 years, DTM PUR
18 years, multicoat systems 20 years, polysiloxane 20 years or more, and polyaspartic 20 years or more. Regarding
interior coatings, they typically consist of a single 15–20 mil layer. Carboline, PPG, Sherwin-Williams, Hayward,
Hempel, and Davis Frost are the major competitors in the SB-HS coatings market currently.
HS, ultra-HS, and solvent-free epoxy coatings can be formulated with 2K epoxy-polyamine systems that have
good edge retention and are suitable for water tanks, chemical storage tanks, and so on. These coatings have a vis-
cosity that is up to three or four times thicker than traditional SB systems as a result of their higher solid content
and reduced solvents. In consequence, the application of an HS coating is more challenging; fortunately, coating
application equipment has progressed to meet these demands with the incorporation of plural components, pres-
sure pumps, and in-situ heating units. Typical epoxy clear coats utilize anhydrides or carboxylic acids to react with
acrylic-epoxy resins in the presence of a catalyst and heat. A 2K fast-cure SB DTM primer for aerospace coatings on
primarily controlled aluminum substrates has been patented [4]. In one embodiment, epoxies (e.g., Type 1 epoxy
equivalent weight 500), acetoacetate (AcAc) acrylics (e.g., EW-AcAc 525), and ketimines are formulated to chelate
to the metal surface for great adhesion under ambient cure in minutes; crosslinking is essentially a Michael Addi-
tion between amines and the AcAc acrylic (Figure 4.1a) in combination with epoxy-amine reactions, equivalent
to an anionic epoxy-acrylic hybrid formulation (refer to Figure 3.9 in Chapter 3). Therefore, the total ketimine
demand in the formulation is determined by the combined supplies of AcAc acrylics and epoxy resins. According
to Chen et al. [10], AcAc groups improve the appearance of the surface, and carbamates can be used as dormant ini-
tiators. Epoxy primers are more difficult to sand prior to the application of bulk basecoats, so polyurethane-based
formulations predominate in automotive priming applications targeting aluminum substrates as well. Allnex’s
KETAC curing chemistry (Figure 4.1b) as NISO (non-isocyanate) primers on metal is based on reactions between
the carbonyl end group and primary amines, that is, the acid-catalyzed keto-hydrazide crosslinking as discussed
(refer to Debrief A in Chapter 3), in which water is released to favor the curing advancement at room tempera-
ture, and the resulting coating has excellent dry time at high relative humidity and is rather soft but very flexible
(vs. epoxy brittle). Note that the remaining active methylene groups require a strong base to undergo Michael
Addition reactions.
There are other elegant chemistry routes to 2K SB coating formulations desired for low-temperature fast cure,
HS, NISO, and/or NIPU, such as epoxy-urethane hybrid coatings as reported by Wakarkar et al. [6], where urethane
synthesis is based on the reaction of cyclic carbonated compounds reacting with diamines (NIPU), as depicted
in Figure 4.1c (also refer to Figure 9.20b–1 in Chapter 9), and Allnex’s ACURE technology [8], among others.
Particularly requiring a strong base, for example, pKa > 13, the ACURE chemistry is NISO, innovatively exploiting
Michael Addition reactions by using malonated or AcAc resins (Figure 4.1d) or similar compounds, such as t-BAA
(Figure 4.1e, [11]), in place of amines to react with acrylates (e.g., DiTMPTA, TMPTA, and so on). Fundamentally,
the protons on malonates or the AcAc are first abstracted by the strong base catalyst, resulting in the formation of
an electron-donating anion on malonates or the AcAc, which then reacts with the electron-deficient acryloyl group
(i.e., an electron acceptor). The derived 2K formulations are fast-curing coatings suitable for metal, as disclosed by
Niu et al. [12], concrete (alkaline and porous surfaces), controlled wood (unless surface tannin acid contents are
of concern), and other substrates. Notably, all these malonates and AcAc resins contain active methylene groups
that, depending on the nature of catalysis, are reactive toward acrylates or amines. As an interesting side note,

diatomaceous earth (containing Nr2O3 and cobalt) is commonly added to SB barn (mostly aluminum substrates)
paints as an additive to produce a blue shade.
4.1.2
Waterborne (WB) coatings
As a result of environmentally friendly technologies, the global market for WB coatings is expanding rapidly,
probably faster than any other platform. The worldwide market was projected to reach ∼EUR 82.7 billion in 2022
(versus ∼EUR 62.4 billion in 2017), with APAC accounting for the largest share of ∼40.0%, Europe for ∼29.5%,
North America for 18.0%, the Middle East and Africa for 7.0%, and South Africa for 5.5%, respectively. Architectural
coatings account for 61% of the total WB coatings, followed by automotive at 9%, protective at 5%, wood at 4%,
general industrial at 3%, packaging at 3%, and others at 16%. Epoxy resins accounted for 22% of WB coatings in
2020, followed by polyesters at 20%, acrylics at 17%, polyurethanes at 17%, and others at 17%, respectively.
Resin emulsions, that is, polymer latex, intended for WB coatings, tend to be manufactured with a high MW
and a novel morphology; stable dispersions are typically high in solids (up to 73.0% by weight) and have a high
MW greater than 106 Daltons. System and design considerations for latexes include, but are not limited to, Tg,
MW, particle size, and viscosity by batch or continuous processing (e.g., multiple phases sequentially can be used
to custom design hard/soft or core/shell polymers). Latex binder films are formed by the coalescence of micelles;
low-VOC coalescing agents include butyl citrate, dioctyl maleate (for example, Genovique® DOM), and ester mix-
tures (for example, OptifilmTM Enhancer 400, Eastman Chemical). If formulations contain solvents or co-solvents,
their types and concentrations must be optimized for resistance to water and salt. In addition, the choice of pig-
ments (high-gloss coatings typically contain no active pigments) has a significant effect on corrosion; colorants,
defoamers, wetting agents (hydrophilic surfactants are preferred), and thickeners (HEUR, UMPE) may be used as
required, along with an additive (such as sodium nitrite) that is frequently included to prevent flash rust.
Acrylics are becoming the most important resin, especially for automotive base coats, which is a significant
trend in WB coatings. Due to WB’s yet inferior chemical resistance and weatherability, automotive clearcoats
and high-corrosion-resistant coatings continue to be primarily SB. For WB DTM coatings in particular, acrylic
emulsions or latexes self-crosslink upon room temperature or properly forced drying, offering high gloss finishes
> 80% at 60 ∘and at a dry film thickness (DFT) of 0.50 to 8.0 mils, provided that i) all ingredients (resins, sol-
vents, additives, and pigments) must be appropriately selected, ii) application conditions affect performance and
appearance, iii) low temperature and extreme humidity must be avoided, and iv) viscosity must be adjusted per
each type of application (dip, spray, brush, or roll). In comparison to 2K systems, WB self-crosslinking PUDs
(polyurethane dispersions), such as Joncryl U 4501, reduce cure temperatures to as low as 80 ∘C for wood and
automotive applications. WB acrylics continue to outperform epoxies, polyesters, and PUDs, despite challenges in
adhesion and chemical resistance in the long run that are to be addressed. As an illustration, BASF’s Acronal® Pro
770, Joncryl® OH 8314, and Basonat® HW are acrylic emulsion polymers and a polyisocyanate, respectively, for
formulating 2K WB DTM paints and possibly automotive primers. DowsilTM 8016, a 60% active and hydrophobic
WB resin (low VOC < 1% and low cyclics < 0.1%) compatible with organics such as acrylates, is claimed for DTM
and heat resistance up to 500–600 ∘C once properly cured (for example, one hour at 180–220 ∘C under a tin-free
condensation catalyst). In addition, Joncryl® 915 (high scratch resistance and low VOC) and Joncryl® RPD (spe-
cialty acrylic polyol, 2K PUR, fast cure) are suitable for automotive coatings, whereas Joncryl® 2981 (WB acrylic)
and Laromer UA Aqua (WB urethane acrylate) are appropriate for furniture and wood floor applications, respec-
tively. Dow Chemical’s RoshieldTM 3311 and PrimalTM EP-6060 emulsions (∼40% solids) appear promising for
high-performance WB wood coatings such as 1K or 2K blocking-resistant primers, sealers, and satin finishes,
as well as pigmented systems, among many others. Dow offers Primal® PR-600 emulsions as a replacement for
cationic primers that would react adversely with tannin acids (on wood substrates). Emulsion NX-8401 from Car-
boline is a WB epoxy coating curing agent. Solenis’ VOC- and formaldehyde-free PolycupTM crosslinking resins,
that is, polyamide epichlorohydrin (PAE) resins, react with amines, carboxyl groups, hydroxyls, and thiols in WB

systems. Hybrids are an additional trend for WB coatings. Applied examples include emulsions of OH-functional
FEVEs (fluoroethylene vinyl ethers; refer to Figure 2.9e in Chapter 2), acrylic resins the crosslinkers of isocyanates
(e.g., Vencorex EasaquaTM XD 401), silicone (amino-functional)-based, and epoxy (cycloaliphatic)/amine-based,
which complement DTM adhesion and flexibility. WB acrylic (hard)/urethane (soft) hybrids, that is, an acrylic
latex with hard domains in a soft latex (core-shell), prove to be advantageous in terms of corrosion resistance,
adhesion, gloss, durability, and low VOCs. In addition, novel technologies such as a non-zinc metal complex of
Nano-VpCl can be utilized as a vapor-phase corrosion inhibitor, as opposed to conventional corrosion-inhibiting
compounds such as molybdates (i.e., chromates yet containing the concerned Cr6+ ions) or similar compounds
that raise HSE concerns.
WB epoxy technology ostentatiously breaks down into four classes: i) 2K systems of resins and polyamines with
high MWs, an averaged particle size of 0.3–5.0 μm, and a viscosity of 1,000–15,000 cPs (mPa-s) at 25 ∘C, which min-
imizes or eliminates settling and water transportation; ii) water dilutable systems at 100% solids; iii) emulsions
or mixtures of two or more liquids; and iv) dispersions of water or water/co-solvent blends. According to current
market trends, there are five mainstream types of WB epoxy enamels, as outlined in Figure 4.2. These types consist
of resin emulsions or dispersions combined with WSA (water-soluble amines) for the lower types and amine dis-
persions for the higher types. In addition, the majority of resins are LER (liquid epoxy resin) emulsions, SER (solid
epoxy resin) dispersions, and combinations thereof. Types 1/2/3 are intended for use on masonry and concrete,
while Types 2/3 can be used to prime steel and as general-purpose topcoats. Talc is not recommended as a filler due
to its high oil absorption. How graphene (e.g., Xlynx Materials’ graphene powder) as a functional filler would per-
form in WB coatings is unknown. Type 4 coatings serve as specialty topcoat finishes. Type 5 coatings are intended
to replace traditional SB systems with metal substrates, which have the best performance to date. Occasionally,
3-layer systems (such as a primer at 100 μm, a middle coat at 125 μm, and a Type 4 WB acid acrylic/epoxy topcoat at
75 μm) outperform their SB counterparts in terms of chemical resistance, as determined by immersion tests. As a
showcase, Caterpillar (Qingzhou, China) successfully switched from oil-based coatings to Sherwin-Williams’ WB
coatings for production beginning in July 2021. The topcoat was sprayed directly onto the dried primer without
any intermediate baking (a so-called wet-on-wet solution).
Typical compositions by weight for current WB coatings are 57% resins/modifiers/curing agents (versus 40% for
SB), 10% solvent/water (versus 30% for SB), 25% pigments/extenders (also 25% for SB), and 8% additives (versus
5% for SB), respectively. When switching from powders to SB, solvents must be used, whereas when switching
from SB to WB, water/co-solvents as well as non-ionic additives and fillers are employed. It is difficult to elim-
inate co-solvents completely from WB systems. Because of their high flash points (typically up to 100–130 ∘C),

water solubility, slow evaporation rates, low-surface tension (less than 30 dynes/cm), and high coupling efficiency,
VOC-exempted ethylene glycol monobutyl ether (abbreviated EB solvents (such as DOW’s DowanolTM glycol
ethers and Eastman’s EB Solvent) are widely used in amine-solubilized, waterborne coatings as an effective coales-
cent that improves film integrity in, for example, architectural and industrial maintenance latex paints. Validation
of stability and performance on various substrates (including galvanized steel, blank/smooth steel, aluminum,
etc.) should always be performed.
4.1.3
Electro-coatings (E-coatings)
In fact, electro-coatings (e-coatings) accounted for annual sales of approximately one million gallons worldwide
in the 2020–2021 timeframe; associated benefits are readily apparent, including high throughput and protection,
throw power (reach inside), cost per unit, film build selectivity, in addition to zero waste, 99% reclaim, and only
2% VOCs. Also obvious are the disadvantages, which include conductive substrates, expensive and complicated
equipment, a precise process, the difficulty of color change, and the requirement that the coating bath dip tank be
kept constantly agitated.
Resins such as epoxies and acrylics are applicable to both cathodic (acidic) and anodic (basic) e-coatings for
functional priming and top coating, respectively. Anodic and cathodic epoxy e-coating technologies are both
suitable for priming metals (primarily steel) with a focus on corrosion resistance in the automotive industry; mean-
while, anodic epoxies are good for large parts with good edge protection and can cure at low temperatures (e.g.,
80 ∘C). In contrast, anodic and cationic acrylic e-coatings are appropriate for decorative topcoats, especially when
restricted to a specific color. E-coating is also compatible with cationic polyurethanes [14]. Using a self-emulsifying
blocked polyisocyanate with a neutralized amine, cathodic electrodeposition coatings are reportedly capable of
curing at temperatures below 160 ∘C while exhibiting enhanced stability and application performance [15, 16].
In addition, alkyd-based cathodic (e.g., Resydrol® AF 502w/35WA emulsion of Allnex) e-coatings are suitable for
large parts and low-temperature cure while producing high gloss. Typical e-coating is processed sequentially as
follows: pretreatment using zinc phosphate bath and non-chrome sealing, followed by e-coating dip, post rinse
(ultrafiltration permeate or DI water), and post baking oven (typically 350 to 375 ∘F, or 176 to 191 ∘C, for 15–20
minutes). A priming benchmark in the automotive industry, the German Q5L cathodic e-coating process uti-
lizes a 40-meter-long dip tank to pass a negatively charged autobody through in 227 seconds or at a line speed of
approximately 34.7 ft/min.
Epoxy resins modified to contain hydrophobic and hydrophilic chains as well as additives applicable to
e-coatings include anodic RESYDROL® AM 410w/67WABG of Allnex (i.e., a water-soluble plasticized phenolic
epoxy), Ancarez 2364 as an epoxy flexibilizer, Dowsil® 68 Additive, Laponite RDS as a rheology modifier, zinc dust,
and so forth. Cationic epoxy resins for e-coatings are fundamentally a variety of amine-extended adducts that are
typically produced in-house by formulators, such as Epoxy Salt from Valspar/Sherwin-Williams. Particularly, a
couple of patents have been filed on a cathodic epoxy resin mixture of amine-extended BPA-based epoxy resins
and alcohol-blocked aromatic isocyanate crosslinkers as applied e-coating formulations [17, 18]. In the coating
bath, additives and optional supporting ingredients include, among others, a tin-containing catalyst (or bismuth
compounds or non-metal catalysts) at 1–2% of total solids by weight, a gemini surfactant [19, 20] at 0.2% by
weight as the wetting agent, and a lactic acid at 0.2–1% by weight (to neutralize the amine-extended epoxies
for cathodicity). One of the resultant e-coating dispersion products appears to be marketed under the name
Vectrogard® 950, for which the baking schedule is 175–190 ∘C for 15–30 minutes to deblock the isocyanates that
crosslink epoxies (refer to isocyanate crosslinkers in Chapter 2). Notable is the fact that ZnCl2 is an effective
catalyst for epoxy-polyurethane systems. Chitosan (refer to Figure 10.13b in Chapter 10), a water-soluble linear
polysaccharide with randomly positioned dual hydroxyl- and amine-functional groups, is patented as an edge
protective agent in cathodic e-coatings [21].

4.1.4
Powder coatings
Powder coatings for a variety of corrosion, impact, and temperature protections accounted for USD 12.0 to USD
15.7 billion in global sales by 2020, representing approximately 12.5% of the industrial coatings market, and are
projected to reach USD 21.4 billion in 2025. Regional market shares are distributed as follows: Asia-Pacific has
the largest market share at 59%, followed by the Americas at 17.5%, the European Union (including the United
Kingdom) at 19.5%, and the rest of the world at 4%, respectively. In terms of materials and chemistry, they are
dominated by thermosetting of 95% and 5% thermoplastic, as follows: polyesters (PEs) 49.5%, PE/TGIC 19%,
PE/HAA (β-hydroxyalkyl amides, for example, PRIMID XL-552 from EMS) 10.5%, FBEs 11.5%, polyurethanes
6.5%, acrylics 2.2%, and others 0.8%. Please note that HAA crosslinking PEs is a condensation reaction that releases
water; therefore, benzoin or similar substances are frequently used in conjunction to address outgassing pinholes
in these decorative powder systems. HAA and internally blocked isocyanates (either difunctional uretdiones or
trifunctional isocyanurates such as THEIC by Actylis) do not respond to the application of catalysts.
Powder end-use markets are divided into the following major categories: oil and gas pipeline, rebar, valves,
busbars, automotive (including wheels, oil and fuel filters, battery trays, brake pads, suspension components,
etc.), appliances (including washing machines, refrigerators, etc.), ACE (agricultural, construction, and earth
moving) equipment, architectural, and furniture. In tandem with the global expansion of the oil and gas indus-
try, the demand for rebar and valves for infrastructure, as well as busbars for automotive (including EVs) and
photovoltaics, also continues to rise. The booming APAC automotive industry sold 39.3 million units/vehicles in
2018 alone, and powder coatings have become an essential coating option for key vehicle components, especially
wheels and there is a trend to adopt metallic color technologies. Household appliances are expanding beyond
metal to include other materials and surfaces, such as MDFs (medium density fiberboards). India’s appliances
and consumer electronics market was expected to reach USD 48.37 billion by 2022.
In laboratories, a powder batch size of 100 to 5,000 grams can be produced through a sequenced process of
premixing, extruding, grinding, and sieving, as schematically charted in Figure 4.3, where the use of an extruder
(e.g., twin screws, zones III/IV temperatures 85/120 ∘C, speed 500 rpm, and a feed rate of 20) is the essential step to
liquidify a premix and transform the homogenized compound into uniform chips on a chiller roll. Temperatures for
extrusion are determined by bulk resins’ melting points (Tm), also considering gel and cure times of formulations.
Dry flow agents, such as fumed silicas, are almost always added, either to chips prior to grinding, occasionally
to coarse powders prior to sieving, or occasionally to powders that have already been sieved. In the industrial
production of powder coatings, each process remains the same, albeit on a much larger scale, such as one ton
(i.e., 2,200 lbs) per premix bowl per load. If a liquid ingredient is to be combined, it is preferable to convert it into
a free-flowing powder before loading it into the formulation mixture prior to extrusion; for instance, a variety of
polyacrylate-derived wet flow agents and certain low-melting-temperature catalysts are incorporated in powder
coatings in this manner.
Powder coatings, including functional FBEs, are application-friendly, easily applied by electrostatic spray for
thin DFTs or fluidized bed dipping for thick DFTs, optionally applicable onto either cold or preheated substrates,
and readily curable via either a post-cure oven or residual heat of preheated parts, depending on the formulated
gel and cure properties.

4.1 Liquids versus Powders
95
Recent developments in epoxy powder coatings, also known as FBEs, include, but are not limited to, the
following: LAT (low-temperature application) formulations from 175 to 200 ∘C with a standard Tg (e.g.,
< 115–120 ∘C) for primarily OD (outer diameter) pipe; high heat resistance with cured Tg over 180–200 ∘C or
up to 225 ∘C for both ID (inner diameter) and OD pipe; high flexibility sustaining 180∘bending in seconds at
down to −45 ∘C crack-free for rebar; high impact resistance exceeding 100 up to 160 lb-in; and combinations.
For example, high-performing rebar FBEs are capable of gelling in two to three seconds and curing in 12 to 14
seconds, depending on the temperature of the incoming bar, allowing for an increased line speed of 65–70 ft/min.
Innovative LAT powder coatings (refer to the debrief of LAT powders in Chapter 6), not limited to FBEs, for
wood substrates (including MDFs) are highly desired by the market as an emerging platform, beyond current
hybrid options (e.g., epoxy/COOH-functional polyester), which as a universal primer or topcoat are becoming
increasingly commercially available with cure schedules such as 5 minutes at 138 ∘C. Particularly, ultra-LAT
wood technology necessitates a cure schedule of as low as 125 ∘C for 5–10 minutes at 3–4 mils and a PCI film
smoothness of preferably 5–10, as wood sources are heat-sensitive and vary in moisture content and surface
profiles.
4.1.5
UV-curable coatings
Lastly, we should not overlook the niche UV technologies, including light-emitting diode (LED)-UV (with narrow
wavelength sources at 365, 385, 395, 405, and 450 nm), across the SB, WB, and powder platforms, including for
LATs on alloys and wood substrates. UV coatings are predominantly composed of acrylic resins and derivatives of
urethane-, epoxy-, polyester-, and polyether-modification. Sprayable UV wood coatings of 100% solids, either clear
or pigmented, are good as sealers, primers, basecoats, and topcoats for a wide range of end uses; still, WB UV wood
coatings are preferably applied with mild heat (e.g., a 120 ∘F oven) in addition to UV energy for free radical induced
curing. The following is an embodiment of SB UV coating formulations totaling 100 pbw (parts by weight): Ebecryl
5129 (an aliphatic urethane acrylate) of 30 pbw, TPGDA (a di-functional reactive diluent) of 33 pbw, TMPEOTA
(a tri-functional reactive diluent) of 20 pbw, optional additives of 0.1–10 pbw, Tego® RAD 2100 (a leveling agent) of
0.6 pbw, Genocure MBF (a photo-initiator, Rahn USA) of 2.2 pbw, Omnikad 1173 (a photo-initiator, IGM Resins)
of 2.2 pbw, and isopropyl alcohol (IPA, as a solvent) of 2.0 pbw. In addition, UV powder coatings make it possible to
complete the prep/loading, application, melt/curing, and unloading process in as short as 20 minutes, according
to Keyland Polymer Ltd., a UV-curable powder coatings manufacturer.
Debrief A Liquid applications and end uses
While it is neither possible nor the intention herein to cover all coating applications, it is worthwhile to include
at least a few prominent areas and end-use examples for demonstrating value chain propositions concerning
materials, chemistry, formulations, and applications. Priority is given to wood finishes (refer to Debrief E), which
include furniture, flooring, and cabinetry. The global wood coatings market reached USD 10.6 billion in 2022 and
is projected to grow to USD 14.0 billion by 2027 [22]. Geographically, APAC, including China, is the largest mar-
ket, accounting for 60% of global volumes, followed by EMEA for 22.4%, and North America comes in third place.
The furniture industry dominates the landscape of wood coatings, accounting for 60% of the total consumption;
for example, IKEA is one of the largest customers in the world. The housing market has a direct impact on the
wood coatings market; approximately 40% of wood varnishes used in construction and building areas are applied
outdoors, with 50% of these being trim coatings. Interior furnishings and wood flooring are more concerned with
volatile organic compounds than exterior coatings, which are more concerned with lightfastness, extended war-
ranty periods, and service life. Mechanical grinding and smoothing of wood surfaces are common pretreatments;
coating applications range widely from dip, spray, brush, curtain coating, and vacuum coating; drying and curing
is a challenge in the application of WB wood coatings. Current DIY markets are dominated by gray and brown

colors, while yellow and blue are on the rise. Wood coatings are moving toward globalization of the market in
terms of raw material supply, line speeds, appearance (e.g., gloss), durability, and functional performance (e.g.,
scratch resistance, anti-slip, etc.). SB technologies for wood coatings range from 2K polyurethanes (PUs or PURs),
including NISO chemistries, to acrylics, to nitrocellulose (NC, e.g., for acoustic instruments), and possibly even
to specialties. Liquid wood coatings, including primers, basecoats, topcoats, sealers, and lacquers, are primarily
based on a variety of bio-based alkyd (polyester) resins and modified systems, further extended to WB and UV
cure, as shown in Table 4.2 (and outlined in Table 4.10)
Specifically, there are primarily five chemistry and formulation platforms for coatings on porous and
polar wood substrates, including i) OH-functional and acid-catalyzed amino-crosslinked alkyds and acrylics,
ii) styrene-free polyesters subject to free radical polymerization and cobalt catalysis, iii) polyester-isocyanate
systems (catalyzed by, e.g., DBTDL) as the most applicable route, iv) OH-functional acrylic-isocyanate systems,
and v) WB UV-curing systems (where vinyl-functional PUDs and isocyanates are used as the bulk resin and
crosslinkers). Still specifically, the amino-resin and acid-catalyzed coatings are heat-resistant but sensitive to oil
and grease, whereas urea-glyoxal (UG) emerges as an HCHO-free crosslinker. Still, specifically, NC, CAB (i.e.,
cellulose acetate butyrate), VCcoP (i.e., vinyl chloride copolymers and terpolymers, e.g., Vinnol E 22/48 A with
Tg 61 ∘C, OH-functional content 1.8% by weight from Wacker Chemie), and PVB (polyvinyl butyral) are optional
and preferred modifiers for use in the classic and robust SB systems. Again, SB systems continue to dominate a
market where alkyds continue to be the most commonly used resins. Polyester-isocyanate is superior to alkyds;
reduced isocyanates in the polyester systems improve flexibility (e.g., NCO-to-OH = 0.53 to 1 is suitable for wood
coatings).
Unsaturated polyesters under organic peroxides (e.g., Nouryon’s) and cured at 126.7 ∘C for 5 to 10 minutes are a
suitable formulation strategy [23] for powder coatings formulated for wood substrates. In the meantime, ultra-LAT
epoxies, including hybrid platforms aiming for rapid and low-temperature cure (five minutes at 125 ∘C or less),
are under development (refer to LAT coatings in Chapter 6), such as an epoxy/COOH-functional polyester hybrid
at a stoichiometric ratio of 1.30 to cure at 130 ∘C for 5–10 minutes, achieving a PCI smoothness of 5–6 at DFT
4–5 mils (or 100–125 μm) [24]. CAB gives powder coatings a hammer finish.

4.1 Liquids versus Powders
97
For architectural coatings (whose market is projected to grow from USD 85.1 billion in 2023 to USD 102 billion
in 2028 [25], including SB, WB, and other varieties), adhesion must take into account the surface characteristics
of substrates such as wood, metal, and brick. Scuff resistance (i.e., surface slip) by incorporating silicone additives
or wax with low melting points and high polarity (e.g., Ceraflour 932G, an LDPE-based wax) and fast return to
service (i.e., block resistance or anti-blocking by utilizing silane or wax with low melting points and low polarity,
e.g., Aquacer 539, a paraffin wax) are two current trends in architectural coatings. Architectural powder coatings
are only available on extruded aluminum and cannot be applied to coils. Thermoplastic PVDF fluoropolymer
resins (e.g., Hylar 5000, as opposed to FEVE, a thermosetting resin) are a crucial component of metal roofing
coatings; PVDF-based thermoplastic powder coatings account for 100% of this market in the European Union,
30% in Asia, and 10% in the United States, respectively. The following are the industrial specifications for both
liquid and powder architectural coating technologies: FGIA/AAMA 2603 is for regular acrylic/PE HS and interior
use only, 2604 is for super-durable PE/50–70% PVDF, and 2605 is for top-tier PVDF/FEVE, respectively. Notably,
Due to VOC issues, coatings for container and rail cargo are rapidly shifting from SB (e.g., epoxies, vinyl esters,
etc.) to largely WB acrylic-modified epoxies for both interior and exterior (Table 4.3) and polysiloxiranes (such as
Advanced Polymer Coatings’ well-known MarineLine® coatings). Still, notably, WB paints and styrenated acrylic
resins for metal substrates must contain phosphate surfactants for steel and sulfate surfactants for aluminum.
Acid monomers promote metal bonding; however, the incorporation of more acids typically results in increased
corrosion.
Steel and aluminum (e.g., Al-60 chrome phosphate-treated) coil coatings, including downstream applications
such as housing roofing, and siding, form a robust market segment that is experiencing fast growth. Figure 4.4
depicts a typical manufacturing line for SB coil coatings, where molding refers to the fabrication of shingles from
the coated and converted coil, and 98% of VOCs are captured and re-used in-house to provide heat for oven curing.
In industrial use, typical coil widths and line speeds are, respectively, 48 inches and 400–700 feet per minute.
Typically, coil coatings have a DFT of 25 μm or less, including a primer of 5 μm or less and a topcoat of 20 μm.
WB solutions for the coil sector are expanding rapidly since demand for topcoats, primers, and backers is high,
particularly in Asia. WB coil coatings are commonly cured at 224–232 ∘C (e.g., sometimes 270 ∘C for 40 seconds),
resulting in a film gloss of greater than 80% at 60∘and flexibility of 0T, both of which are on par with those of SB
versions.

Chemical structures of (a) blocked HDI and (b) monomeric HMMM (e.g., Allnex’s Cymel 303) crosslinkers, and an
illustration of (c) HMMM alkylation (ethoxymethyl and hydroxyl co-condensation).
Primer and topcoat coil coatings, which require weatherability, are formulated with OH-functional polyesters
or acrylics cured by blocked isocyanates or melamine, such as blocked HDI (i.e., hexamethylene di-isocyanate)
and HMMM (i.e., hexaethoxymethylmelamine) in Figures 4.5a/b. Acrylic building blocks or monomers can be
selected based on their structures and glass transition temperatures (Tg), for example, MAA (methacrylic acid)
Tg 185 ∘C, BA (butyl propionate) Tg −54 ∘C, etc., as can carboxylic acids and glycol alcohols for custom-tailoring
polyester resins (refer to Figure 9.5 in Chapter 9). Cymel® 303 LF (offered by Allnex), Nacure 1051 acid cata-
lysts, Heucophos® zinc phosphates, Silwet® L-7600 surfactants, Polyfluo® 523XF wax, Gasil® HP270 silica gels,
SolsperseTM 32000 dispersants, Syloid® Rad 2015 matting agents, Burgess no. 17 kaolin clay, Uniqflow 350W flu-
orocarbons, and EFKA® SL 3257 polysiloxanes for slip or anti-blocking are a few other ingredients that can be
used in coil coatings, in addition to a variety of lightfast pigments and colorants, such as TiO2 white, carbon black,
phthalo green, and red iron oxide.
Coatings crosslinked with melamine and MF (melamine-formaldehyde) derivatives such as HMMM are also
known as “acid curing” (Figure 4.5c and refer to Debrief A in Chapter 8) because these systems are acid catalyzed
(refer to Debrief B in Chapter 3). Commercial melamine and derivatives are available as monomeric (e.g., Ineos’s
Resimene 747) and polymeric, all multi-functional and versatile, similar to the resole- and novolac-phenolic resins
discussed in Chapter 2, and they are capable of fast and low-temperature crosslinking under acidic conditions,
applicable favorably to a number of industrial uses including coil, wood, non-wood flooring, concrete coatings,
and adhesives. Catalyzed with strong acids, such as Nacure 1051 (hydrophobic), K-Cure 1040 (a p-TSA solution),
and p-TSA (hydrophilic solid versus hydrophobic DNNSA), fully alkylated melamine/MF is produced; with weak
acids, such as Nacure 4054 and XC-235 from Kings Industries, only partially alkylated products are generated.
MF-derived self-condensation forms methylene (−CH2−) bridges (refer to Figure 8.3 in Chapter 8); however,
excessive self-polymerization has disadvantages, such as brittleness. Regarding acid catalysts, XC-311 allows fast
and low-temperature cure of OH-functional polyester resins (e.g., Polymac 220–1935 at 170 ∘C for 25 seconds) for
coil coatings, and Nacure XC-338, a direct offset to K-Cure 129B, performs well for wood coatings, to name a few.
Floor (non-wood) coatings, including terrazzo coverings, are typically self-leveling liquids, UV stable, 100%
solids or low VOC, super-fast return to service, and low-temperature cure down to 0 ∘C. Commercially viable
flooring technologies include, but are not limited to, 1K acrylic emulsion or thermoplastic acrylics, free radical
polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA), 2K PA (polyaspartic), 2K EP (epoxies), 2K PUR (polyurethanes),
and most recently, 2K NISO Michael Addition (MA), of which PA is considered the best compromise between ease
of application, high-performance properties, and fast return to service. Epoxy basecoats consisting of liquid resins
and cycloaliphatic amines, including amine adducts, Mannich bases, and phenalkamines, as curing agents, such
as Amicure IC 221, 321, and 322, provide sufficient flexibility, blush/blister/humidity resistance, preferably in
conjunction with a PUR topcoat, when properly formulated. According to Evonik, Anquamine 701 is a crosslinker

that purportedly imparts moisture vapor permeability for addressing osmotic pressure-driven blisters in concrete
and floor coatings, Anquamine 728 delivers a rapid cure, Ancamine 2800 CTL functions as a curing agent for
moisture vapor barriers in addition to adhesion to concrete, and Ancamine 2791 imparts high-temperature
and high-chemical resistance in addition to being crystallization resistant at low temperatures. According to
Fiolet et al. [26], floor coatings containing a filler mixture comprised of barite and mica at a weight ratio greater
than two exhibit enhanced qualities, including cracking resistance. In contrast, the homo-polymerization of
methyl-allyloxymethyl acrylates (MeAoMA; refer to Figure 10.16a in Chapter 10) provides competitive flooring
solutions for rapid installations in low-temperature conditions, as well as high Tg, flexibility, adhesion, and
toughness advantages. Other formulation chemistries include PURs for concrete (e.g., Sherwin-Williams’s
FasTopTM is claimed to be eco-consciously superior to epoxy coatings in terms of returning to service in 4–6 hours
and withstanding thermal shock, impact, corrosion, and chemicals), and polyaspartic (i.e., polyurea coatings
by utilizing aliphatic HDI trimers, e.g., Desmodur® XP-2410) for wall and deck coatings, among others. One
recent implementation of polyaspartic floor coatings reduces the curing time by facilitating reactions between
a polyisocyanate and a polyamine via a Michael Addition receptor (e.g., dimethyl maleate) in the presence of
a zirconium metal catalyst [27]. Aliphatic isocyanates are less reactive than aromatic ones; thus, they require
catalysts. In an upgrading MA formulation (refer to Figure 8.9 in Chapter 8) with faster curing than a commercial
PA as reported by Brauer et al. [28], a 90/10% combination of a malonated (154 g/eq) and an AcAc (acetoacetate,
65 g/eq) donor resin exhibits the best chemical-resistant performance (upon curing at RM for seven days) when
paired with DiTMPTA (di-trimethylolpropane tetra-acrylate, 116 g/eq) as the acceptor resin at a donor/acceptor
ratio of 0.95 in Part A. An organic amino catalyst at ∼5.3% by weight of total formulation as Part B is intended to
de-block into a strong base following coating application via evaporation of ethanol and CO2. The most important
characteristics of floor coatings are gloss, hardness, drying times (at DFT 4.0–6.0 mils), chemical resistance,
and weathering. From application standpoints, concrete and floor coatings typically consist of three functional
layers, including an epoxy primer at 3–5 mil wet film thickness (WFT) that is cured, sanded, and patched prior to
applying a bulk high-performance WB epoxy coating at 8–10 mil WFT, which is also cured, sanded, and solvent
wiped before applying a urethane topcoat at 3–5 mil WFT. Floor coatings are used in a variety of applications,
including commercial, industrial, and residential. Sherwin-Williams, Sika, Stonhard, and others are currently the
top suppliers in the United States.
Intumescent (fireproofing) coatings, expected to reach a global market size of USD 1.15 billion in 2023 and
USD 2.28 billion in 2030 [29], and accounting for market shares of over 60% by 2021–2022, are a fast-growing
sub-segment of industrial applications, used extensively to protect commercial and residential infrastructures,
such as marine, transportation, onshore and offshore oil/gas (including heavy-duty refinery tanks holding
chemicals and peroxides, etc.), water supply, sewage treatment, furnaces (heavy duty), bridges, offices, lodging,
among others. Public building expenditures in the United States are increasing at a double-digit rate to a total
of nearly USD 1 trillion per year. Since 2015, new construction applications in the oil and gas industry have
adopted a “massive trend” toward OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) and fireproofing, for instance.
Sherwin-Williams (e.g., Firetex FX6002), Jotun, AkzoNobel, Isolatek, Flamemaster, Benjamin Moore, Stanchem,
Flamecontrol, Carboline, etc. are among the world’s leading suppliers of intumescent coatings. As a functional
coating with great thermal insulation and limited flammability, intumescent paints of varying DFT from 250
μm to several millimeters must withstand temperatures as high as 200–600 ∘C for 30 to 120 minutes, which is
the time required for steel to reach its critical failure temperature of ∼550 ∘C under standard testing conditions,
depending on the perimeter. SB and WB liquid intumescent coatings can be formulated using a wide range
of chemistries, including thermosetting and thermoplastic materials such as acrylics (vinyl toluene, styrene,
and silicone), fluoropolymers, epoxies, urethanes, and chlorinated rubber. Specifically, vinyl acetates and
acrylics are primarily used against cellulosic fires, epoxies are exclusively used against hydrocarbon fires, thin
films are preferred for construction and steel, and thick films are more applicable to the oil and gas industry,
which requires low VOC and the ability to adhere to urethane foam. Acrylic resins in part A via a free radical

polymerization initiated by peroxides in part B at 1–4 phr, optionally boosted by a tertiary amine such as N,
N-dimethyl-p-toluidine, are commercialized in accordance with a 2K intumescent formulation designed for a
drying time as short as 60 minutes, as disclosed by Green et al. [30]. Preferably, an acid source (e.g., ammonium
polyphosphate), a carbon source (e.g., pentaerythritol), a gas blowing agent (e.g., melamine), a nucleating
agent (e.g., TiO2), and optionally a char formation additive (e.g., zinc borate) are loaded in conjunction with
other wetting/dispersing and thixotropic additives. In a patent application for intumescent coatings that are
conventionally formulated with pentaerythritol and/or melamine-containing components, tannic acid (refer to
Figures 2.8b and 7.1j in Chapters 2 and 7, respectively) is described as a blowing agent and char former, whereas
ammonium polyphosphate (APP) is used as an acid source [31]. In another embodiment, core/shell structured
particles are employed as a fire-resistant composition in conjunction with graphite as a thermally expandable
intumescent [32]. Epoxy-based intumescent coatings, such as an amine-rich epoxy (e.g., Epikote 828)/polyamide
(e.g., Ancamide 903MAV) system catalyzed by DMP-30 (refer to Table 2.5b in Chapter 2), have been evaluated
and approved to be tough, hard, weatherable, and highly adhesive, resulting in erosion-resistant char in the
event of hydrocarbon fires. If correctly prepared and applied, a topcoat (such as an epoxy, polyurethane, alkyd,
or acrylic) will improve the durability of a bulk intumescent coating; nevertheless, there is a trend to eliminate
topcoats in certain extreme applications.
Adhesives and sealants, which are categorized as specialty coatings, have also experienced robust expansion in
tandem with technological innovation and Industry 4.0 developments within the global and circular economy.
According to a report from online resources [33], the coatings market in 2021 was comprised of construction and
industrial applications, with WB, SB, and powders accounting for 56% (85% construction and 15% industry), 37%
(29% construction and 71% industry), and 7% (doubled in ten years) of total, respectively. Overall, the WB to SB ratio
for construction coatings is 81% to 19%. Due to environmental concerns and economic sustainability, bio-based
adhesives and sealants increase while SB and fossil-based raw materials decrease, in line with broader market
trends in the coatings industry. There are often two distinct adhesive systems, namely SB and polymer dispersions;
hybrids, such as SMP or silane-terminated polyethers (STP-E) and silyl-modified polyurethanes (SPUR), dominate
adhesive technologies [34, 35]. Kaneka Corporation, among others, is a pioneer in isocyanate-free MS polymer
production (i.e., SMP). STP-E (or SMP) and -U (or SPUR) are discussed in detail in Chapter 10.
Common catalysts used in silicone, SMP, and SPUR adhesives and sealants are listed in Table 4.4, along with
their most appropriate systems. It is possible to create 1K epoxy adhesives that can be formulated to bond structural
steel with high bonding strength up to 41 N/mm2 (i.e., 1,600 psi) and strong temperature resistance up to 250 ∘C.
2K epoxy adhesives cure at moderate temperatures and are suited to a wide range of substrates, but their heat
resistance is typically not greater than 120 ∘C. Acrylic structural adhesives are effective on a variety of substrates,

including plastics, with high shear and bonding strengths up to 28 N/mm2; debonding of cured acrylic adhesives
can take place at 200 ∘C. Cyanoacrylates exhibit exceptional bonding strength up to 30 N/mm2; however, their
impact resistance is inferior to that of epoxies or acrylics; cyanoacrylates are subject to de-bonding in hot water
or most polar solvents, and they cannot typically withstand temperatures over 100–120 ∘C, similar to 2K epoxies.
Anaerobic adhesives and sealants are ideal for bonding metal, and they are frequently used as thread lockers or
sealants, retaining compounds, form-in-place gaskets, etc., such as Click Bond’s aerospace adhesive fasteners and
Henkel’s Loctite adhesives, etc. The best adhesives for bonding plastics, such as PPO, PVC, SMC, and HIPC, are
UV curable (with excellent adhesion but plastics must light transmit), cyanoacrylates (with very high bonding
strength on most plastics but primers are required to bond polyolefins or silicones), structural acrylics such as
methyl methacrylate (MMA), and specialty products (for polyolefins). In Chapter 10, adhesives and adhesion are
extensively covered.
Debrief B Powder applications and end uses
As previously stated, thermoplastic powder coatings compete with liquid coatings or complement them for certain
architectural coating applications. Polyester thermosetting powder coatings, such as those that are TGIC-, HAA-,
and blocked isocyanate-cured, as well as hybrids (epoxy/COOH-functional), are primarily used for general indus-
trial and decorative purposes. In contrast, approximately 80% of the total volume of epoxy thermosetting powder
coatings (i.e., fusion bonded epoxies or FBEs) is consumed annually by oil and gas steel pipeline OD and ID lin-
ings, whereas the remaining 20% of the market share is attributed primarily to the rebar and valve categories.
Three-layer coatings consisting of an FBE primer, an adhesive, and a polyethylene (PE) or polypropylene (PP) top
wrap continue to be the industrial standard for OD pipe corrosion protection, for which FBEs are typically formu-
lated with amines (such as DICY and dihydrazides) or phenolics as crosslinkers. Key performance characteristics
of OD FBE coatings include adhesion, toughness, flexibility, and impermeability. For ID pipes, adhesion, integrity,
durability, and surface smoothness (in direct contact with oil and gas) are crucial for long-term performance; con-
sequently, a two-layer system consisting of a resole-phenolic primer (refer to Table 7.1 in Chapter 7) and a liquid
or powder epoxy topcoat is typical of industrial design. In the meantime, nearly all ID drill pipes are coated with
FBEs, preferably with a primer, due to heat-resistant requirements for formulations with Tg values between 120
and 225 ∘C, depending on drilling depths and geographies. In general, the environmental temperature and pres-
sure reach a maximum of 180 ∘C and 300 bars at a depth of 3,000 meters, increasing by 25 ∘C and 100 bars for
every 1,000 meters descended. Such high-temperature and high-pressure (HTHP) applications are challenging,
but they can be functionally addressed by modifying existing epoxy powder coatings or by developing new for-
mulations employing, for instance, fluorene epoxy monomers. Without limiting to theory, the achievable Tgs for
FBEs utilizing DICY (refer to Figure 2.2a), ADH (adipic dihydrazide; refer to Table 2.1a), and solid phenolic resins
(refer to Figure 2.6d in Chapter 2) are between 105 and 115 ∘C, 98 and 102 ∘C, and 105 and 108 ∘C, respectively.
Rebar (short for carbon steel reinforcing bar) and concrete coatings are indispensable for the long-term protec-
tion of infrastructure such as bridges and highways against deterioration. On the market, rebars made of galvanized
(50% market share), stainless steel or SS (2% market share), composite (i.e., carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer, or
CFRP, 1% market share), and other materials (2% market share, including bamboo, 0.1%) are competing with
epoxy-coated rebar (45% market share, and about 4–5 times less expensive than SS). FBE powder coatings provide
VOC-free solutions for corrosion protection of standard construction rebar, with an optional glossy or textured
finish. Considering a typical DFT thickness of 8–12 mils, 18 pounds of an FBE powder are required to coat one
ton of steel. As of the end of 2022, the total market for rebar coating powders in the United States is approximately
USD 80 million, accounting for one-third of the global total (one-third in China and one-third in the Middle East,
respectively). In a rebar coating plant, up to 17 blasted bars can be conveyed through preheating, spraying, residual
heat curing in seconds, and water quenching at a line speed of 50–70 ft/min. Key performance characteristics of
rebar FBEs compliant with ASTM A775 testing and DOT (Department of Transportation) specifications include

102
4 Concepts, Utilities, Methods, and Techniques
cold flexibility, sustaining 180∘bending fabrications in seconds at −45 ∘C without cracking, rapid gel and cure,
and anti-cobwebbing at spray. A combination of rapid cure and extreme cold flexibility represents the greatest
formulation challenge but is readily achievable by combining conventional and innovative epoxy cure chemistry
techniques (refer to Debrief A in Chapter 6 for a detailed discussion on super flexibility).
4.2
The Formulation Index
In a sense, the formulation of coatings, such as epoxy systems, liquids, and powders, for a particular application
consists solely of the following three scenarios: i) to develop from scratch, where resins, crosslinkers, and catalysts
are to be determined; ii) to modify from an existing formula, where a portion of reactive ingredients are to be
substituted with offsets; and iii) to optimize from an existing formula, where the reactive binder package is fixed
but their levels are to be optimized. Regardless, the formulation index (FI, abbreviated), which is the stoichiometric
molar ratio of resins to hardeners, is the most important parameter to consider. Catalysts and their loading levels
may represent an additional critical element for proper operation. FIs define the formulation dynamics, window,
and capacity if there is a formulation language or algorithm existing. A properly optimized FI determines the
greatest performance desired. Mastering and correctly applying the FI concept in practice is half the battle in
becoming a successful formulator.
Table 4.5 illustrates the third circumstance described thus far: FI optimization operations for an existing FBE
powder formulation where the catalyst variant remains unchanged at 4.15% of the formulation’s total weight or
4.50 phr (per hundred resin) of the total resins plus hardeners. FI is an independent variable; however, it is inher-
ently linked to two variables, the resin and the crosslinker, concurrently. As shown in Table 4.5, the epoxy resin
and phenolic hardener have an EEW of 1,300 g/eq and a phenyl hydroxyl equivalent weight (EW-PhOH) of 380,
respectively. Consequently, using Example #1 as an illustration, FIs are computed as follows:
Nominal FI (#𝟏) =
resin mole
hardener mole =
773.6
1300
148.8
380
= 2.25
By examining the resin/hardener ratios by weight ranging from 3.8 to 19.0 to infinity, which are consistent with
the nominal FIs increasing from 1.62 to 5.8 to infinity, the DOE of nine batches provides for a large variety of
resin and crosslinker combinations. Notably, Example #8 represents an extreme scenario in the absence of any
crosslinker (i.e., crosslinker-free or at an infinite FI), and we would be very curious to see how it compares to the
Table 4.5
Factorial DOEs of FBEs with FI as the only factor at nine levels (1 × 9).

other cases. In Chapter 6, the complete results of the DOE execution are presented, including the outcomes of
the key qualities and the associated implications and inspirations.
Advanced epoxy formulation techniques are essentially centered on the best FI determination, with the goal of
creating coating solutions that are not only functional but also superior. From the perspective of the epoxy curing
reactions, the best FI indicates that the fractions of epoxy homo-cures and epoxy-hardener co-polymerization in
the cured network are installed nearly precisely or in the maximum mode intended for one or more performance
qualities. At least for epoxy coatings, there is always an ideal catalyst loading amount when the formulation is
operating at an optimized FI or at its maximum capacity. In other words, the optimal FI for a given formulation
is catalyst-dependent; the performance of the ideal FI at a lower catalyst loading is quantitatively different from
that at a larger catalyst loading. Comparatively, liquid coatings are more tolerant to FIs, and the related FIs are
sometimes regulated by adjusting the proportions of epoxies and crosslinkers (e.g., polyamides) when equivalent
weights of crosslinkers are not always available.
4.3
Surface Coatings versus Structural Laminates
As described in Table 4.6, coatings can be divided into the following categories based on substrates and end uses:
primarily, surface coating of metal, plastics, wood, concrete, etc. for protective and decorative purposes; laminating

and adhesive bonding between similar or dissimilar substrates; to a lesser extent based on usages and perhaps
market shares; encapsulation, where substrates are totally sealed by coatings except for connections or joints;
injection molding that is mold-restricted but substrate-free; 3D printing without substrates (i.e., self-contained);
and printing inks. One substantial surface coating with one side exposed to the air is intended for corrosion resis-
tance of steel and iron such as steel pipeline, rebar, and valve, and one substantial adhesive bonding (both sides
bonded to substrates) is aimed at printed circuit boards (PCBs) including insulated metal substrates (IMS, also
called metal-core PCB or MCPCB) for, for example, 5/6G telecom modules, IGBTs for power conversion, and so
on. Notably, epoxy-encapsulated busbars capable of high current and/or voltage resistance are critical components
to one of the current photovoltaic (PV) technologies of MBB (multiple busbars) and PERC (passivation), part of
an up-trending clean energy ahead of next generation TOPCon and HJT (heterojunction) PV batteries (crystal
silicon-perovskite laminated) with up to 33.9% solar panel light converting efficiency (compared to 20–22% typical
of PERC). Moreover, advanced high-voltage IGBTs made from MCPCBs, resisting 3,300 and up to 8,000 volts, are
essential to high-speed trains and automotive, including burgeoning EVs with warranties of over 25 years and
200,000 kilometers under strict EMC (equilibrium moisture content) and temperature changes. IGBT modules are
to power systems what CPUs (central processing units) are to computers, and IGBTs are to electricity what a gate
is to water. Without special high-performance IGBTs, the most recent saleable EVs’ astounding accelerations from
zero to 100 km/h in 2.80 seconds would not be conceivable. Currently, the market-leading IGBT manufacturers are
Semikron with 30% of the global market share, Infineon with 14.8%, ABB with 11.3%, and various Chinese man-
ufacturers with 28.9%. Steel pipe and tank surface barrier coatings for pressured hydrogen (or syngas, ammonia,
or methanol) transportation and storage are a specialty application in the clean energy economy. MarineLINE®
coatings (2K polysiloxiranes containing both siloxanes and oxiranes; refer to discussion in Chapter 9) from
Advanced Polymer Coatings (Avon, Ohio, USA) account for over 12% of the global cargo tank coating market by
2022’s end [36].
This section concentrates on the corrosion resistance and barrier properties of outer and inner (i.e., exposed
and restricted) metal surface coatings, as well as the IMS of laminates, from the author’s hands-on experience. It
should be noted that surface coatings for a single substrate are formulated differently than structural laminates
for two substrates. Specifically, surface coatings with DFTs from 1 mil to unlimited that gel and cure either fast
or slowly are fully acceptable depending solely on processing because curing-induced shrinking is not much of a
concern for coated one side (C1S); in contrast, coating for structural laminates or laminations (e.g., IMS, typically
1.5 to 12 mils for the adhesive layer) should always gel and cure slowly enough to minimize the cure-induced stress
buildup and prevent warping of the laminated panels with a sandwiched structure, as illustrated in Figures 4.6a/b,
respectively. In each case, sufficient adhesion is necessary, although for laminations, pressure, vacuum, and heat
are often applied in conjunction.
Outer surface coatings for metal, mostly steel, against corrosion are of far-reaching significance in practice. As
reported in the literature [37], the annual costs of corrosion, including direct and indirect expenses, are approach-
ing USD 1.0 trillion, or 6% of the US national GDP (gross domestic product). Corrosion cannot be prevented but

can be managed. On the one hand, corroded metal is more thermodynamically stable than uncorroded metal;
on the other hand, good adhesion (wet and dry) and impermeability (i.e., moisture barrier) of coatings serving
as passivation discourage corrosion rates because they assist in slowing down metal surfaces’ access to O2 and
moisture (electrolytes) that must be present for an ordinary metal corrosion process to occur, where Fe is oxidized
into Fe2O3 or rust (refer to Figure 10.18 in Chapter 10).
Cathodic protection is supplementary as an additional method for enhancing rust prevention, for instance by
utilizing metallic zinc particles as part or all of the sacrificial fillers and pigments. According to Kalendova [39],
spherical zinc particles with an average diameter of 2.0 μm exhibit superior anticorrosive properties. Regarding alu-
minum (Al) substrates, anodization forms a very hard and inert surface layer consisting of nanosized Al2O3 pores,
which is highly corrosion resistant; however, anodization is not applicable to steel (or copper) because the result-
ing Fe2O3 is water-soluble, black in color, and subject to further oxidation into Fe3O4. The greatest concern for
Al substrates is galvanic corrosion, against which protective coatings consist of anodization, an epoxy primer, and
a fluorourethane topcoat with a substantially thinner DFT than steel. Fluorosilanes and fluorosiliconeurethanes
represent new coating materials and strategies. Steel to be coated is preferred over aluminum to be anodized for
the construction of big vessels, such as modern boats and warships, due to the ease of processing massive steel sub-
strates, including cutting and welding. In another aspect, hydrophobicity of coatings improves corrosion resistance
by strengthening coating film impermeability against water; moisture repellence, as indicated by WVTR (water
vapor transportation rate), is in a general order of least favorable 86.4 g H2O/m2–24 hours for pigmented alkyds >
51.9 for polyurethanes > 33.2 for epoxy-amine systems > 18.5 for acrylic/melamine-formaldehyde. Field surveys
conducted over many years in the pipeline industry indicated that olefin thermoplastics (e.g., polyethylene or PE
and polypropylene or PP) offer remarkably better water resistance than epoxy powder coatings (i.e., FBEs), but are
less resistant to oxygen. Moreover, rigid PVC is reportedly the best organic material in terms of moisture repellency,
followed by PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate). Some fluoro- and silicone-modified (e.g., polysiloxanes) polymers
are highly hydrophobic, resulting in a lower surface energy of 18–25 mJ/m2 (compared to cured epoxies, which
typically have a surface energy of 43 mJ/m2; refer to Table 10.4 in Chapter 10) and consequently improved imper-
meability. Note that conventional epoxy powder coatings are rarely used alone for applications that comply with
ISO 12944 C5 and C6 corrosion categories due to various limitations unless a primer and a topcoat are also applied.
Notably, a variety of liquid coatings, including Sherwin-Williams’ Zinc Clad 4100, Macropoxy 646, and Acrolon 218
(as a finish coat), are marketed as corrosion protection solutions for small to large steel fabrications in onshore and
offshore environments. In the interim, next generations of zinc-rich, epoxy, and polyaspartic corrosion-resistant
platforms are under development. As benchmarks, NORSOK M-501 (e.g., 25 replicates of the following cycles:
3 days of UV/condensation, 3 days of salt spray, 1 day at −20 ∘C, and then reverse) is the most stringent durability
test standard on offshore coatings in comparison to UL 2431 for the onshore industry.
According to Baghdachi [40], very high or very low electrical conductivity (i.e., dielectric strength) is favor-
able for corrosion barrier properties, on the other hand. Regarding exterior surface coatings, and in practice,
polyamide-cured epoxies are unsuitable for water and wastewater systems where bacteria are present, alkyds (i.e.,
fatty acid polyesters) are unsuitable for marine or tank applications, and phenolic-cured epoxies are strongly resis-
tant to acids (including H2SO4) but not alkalis. Corrosion resistance of metal by means of surface coatings can
be artificially measured and characterized using a variety of techniques pertinent to accelerated degradation of
adhesion and impermeability over time, such as HWA (hot water soak adhesion), CDT (cathodic disbondment
testing), autoclaves (e.g., three-phase HTHP), and EIS (electrochemical impedance spectroscopy), among others,
all of which will be discussed in the following section of materials and system properties.
Debrief C Surface coatings and end uses
Anti-graffiti coatings on metal and concrete substrates represent a specialty surface coating application that is
experiencing rapid global growth. Such coatings for the outer surfaces of metal substrates (e.g., bus bodies) should

106
4 Concepts, Utilities, Methods, and Techniques
be resistant to solvents, scratches, and UV light. Currently, silicone and polyurethane chemistries, and perhaps
fluoropolymers (like FEVE), liquids, and powders, dominate the market due to their outstanding weatherability
and easy-to-clean surfaces resulting from low-surface energy or hydrophobicity. Basonol HPE 1170 B, a hyper-
branched OH-functional polyester that is compatible with both 2K PUR and 1K amino systems, can be utilized
as a co-binder for clearcoats or topcoats to enhance scratch resistance. Pre-ceramic polysilazanes, particularly
organic OPSZ (analogous to sol-gel or silicate coatings), such as the Durazane® series from Merck KGaA, are also
proposed for durable surface graffiti protection [41] because the cured surface tends to be suitably dense, hard
(reaching 9H pencil hardness at 200 ∘C), and of low-surface energy less than 30 mN/m (or mJ/m2). However,
comparisons between polysilazanes and polysiloxanes are not included in the report; polysilazanes may not nec-
essarily perform better than polysiloxanes due to the lower Si-N bond strength of 439 kJ/mol compared to the Si-O
bond’s strength of 798 kJ/mol.
Inner surface coatings of steel pipes (sometimes referred to as ID pipe coatings) and tanks for pressured
hydrogen (H2) transportation and storage are gaining increasing public interest as a result of clean energy (zero
emission—wind, solar, PV, fuel cell, etc.) in a global circular economy centered on reduction, elimination, and
reuse (including fixation) of carbon dioxide (CO2), the most concerned greenhouse gas. Scientists have recently
synthesized polymeric starches more than 8.5 times as efficiently as a corn plant via 11 chemo-enzymatic
reactions, microbial protein from corn stover, and hexose (six carbon atoms) sugars from CO2 [42–44]. Monument
Chemical is slated to commercially produce polycarbonate ether polyols from CO2 waste in late 2023 using
Clean-Tech catalyst technologies licensed from Econic (www.econic-technologies.com), also representing a
revolutionary advance in carbon-neutral efforts. Additionally reported are a novel method to directly convert
CO2 into solid carbon by Ga-based liquid metals [45], an electrochemical and metabolic engineering approach to
upcycle CO2 into long-chain carbohydrates (such as glucose) [46], and CO2-negative concrete (www.carboncure
.com). Hydrogen, including green fuel cells, is considered as one of the most important sources of clean energy
to replace coal and fossil fuels in the future. As reported in September 2021 [47], Australia was developing
an ambitious project to produce up to 3.5 million tons of green H2 by 2030 using Siemens’ water electrolysis
technology, as illustrated in Figure 4.7a, with 1.25 MWatt fuel cells, which is seven times Germany’s planned
volume for the same time period. Singapore is also establishing an ambitious plan to become a major green
energy provider in the future. The scale of the project would greatly improve efficiency by halving production
or manufacturing costs, from USD 3.00 per kilogram of green H2 to approximately USD 1.50 per kilogram. By
the end of 2021, H2 fuel cell battery (Figure 4.7b)-powered vehicles (e.g., Toyota Motor’s Mirai) had a cost of
approximately USD 10.00/100 km compared to USD 1.54/100 km for lithium battery-driven EVs. Green H2 from
water electrolysis accounts for only 1.5–2.0% of the total H2 production, which also includes coal gasification
(22%, primarily from China) and industrial byproducts (76%, such as natural gas with steam methane reforming,
or SMR). Appendix A explains how hydrogen energy is derived from different resources. As a showcase, Toyota
debuted in September 2022 a mobile hydrogen-powered energy system comprised of a green electrolysis cell
(1.25 MW PEM), a storage unit (600 kg), and a 1 MW fuel cell engine.
Insightfully, hydrogen as an energy carrier has the highest energy content by weight but the lowest energy con-
tent by volume of all common fuels (34.0 kcal/g, approximately three times more than gasoline’s 10.3–8.4 kcal/g,
compared to wood 4.2 kcal/g, coal 7.8 kcal/g, and Li-batteries 0.14 kcal/g maximum [49], respectively). Typically,
natural gas is liquefied as liquid natural gas (LNG) at −162 ∘C for transport and storage; similarly, hydrogen is
either liquefied at −253 ∘C for super-insulated transport or must be highly compressed at 3,000 psi or 204 atm
for transport and at 10,000 psi or 680 atm for storage, respectively. According to reports, hydrogen refill stations
require 790 atm of pumping pressure. Considering the notorious hydrogen embrittlement of metal, such high pres-
sures present significant safety concerns. Hydrogen molecules cannot be absorbed directly by metal, but under
pressure, one H2 molecule on metal surfaces breaks into two hydrogen atoms that are subsequently absorbed by
metal, resulting in hydrogen brittleness, which is the culprit for structural failures. Still insightfully, hydrogen
at a pressure of 400 GPa or higher (approximately four million times the ambient pressure) assumes a metallic

state, exhibiting metallic behaviors (optical and superconductive). Back to our relevant discussion, the overall
CTQ’s (critical to quality) for hydrogen barrier coatings are translated as follows: i) the ability to sustain high pres-
sure, which requires an outstanding modulus; and ii) superior barrier properties, which require impermeability to
molecules smaller than H2O or O2 like H2, in addition to exceptional adhesion as always. For hydrogen-powered
vehicles, carbon-fiber wound composites with metal or non-metal cores are the norm for manufacturing the stor-
age tanks, and Japan is the market leader in this sector. Multi-layer graphene coatings have been and are being
investigated academically as a potential option [50]. Specialty epoxy coatings like fluorenes and hybrid systems like
benzoxazine-bismaleimides (BOX-BMI) are promising because they are capable of creating super high modulus
and barrier coatings, which will be discussed in Chapters 7 and 9, respectively.
Debrief D Structural laminates and end uses
Representative of laminate applications, IMS, also known as copper-clad laminates (CCLs) or metal-core PCBs,
are increasingly replacing FR-4 substrates (poor thermal conductivity 𝜆) for PCB fabrications aimed at a broader
range of electrical and electronics end uses, including 5/6G telecom, supercomputing, smartphones, UHV
(ultra-high-voltage) power transmission, high-speed trains, EVs, LEDs, and many others. The primary advantage
of CCLs is excellent thermal conductivity combined with electrical insulation if the middle dielectric layer
(mainly epoxy) is tailor-formulated with thermally conductive fillers, such as SiC (0.7 W/m-∘K, the same unit
for the following), alumina (30–40), AlN (aluminum nitride, 320), BN (boron nitride, 750), graphene (i.e., 2D
graphite, ∼4,000, in comparison to copper of 400 and aluminum of 235, respectively), and other engineered
ceramic particles. When both high-density interconnect (HDI) and miniaturization of PCBs increase rapidly,
heat management becomes the most pressing challenge to address. Figure 4.8 depicts a sequentially applied
CCL manufacturing process employing SB epoxy coatings and curtain coaters, where the cure temperature and
pressure are, for example, 204 ∘C and 1,300 psi, respectively, dependent in part on the Tg of the coatings. In
specific, there is edge cleaning and a HiPot quality control step after S4 (panels) but before S5 (circuit boards)
to ensure the absence of defects in electrical insulation. Optionally, B-staged prepregs are produced from the
same liquid coatings by dip impregnating reinforced glass fiber webs, followed by mild drying or conditioning
(that drives off solvents but does not trigger any cure). The rolled prepregs are then sold to laminators for the
production of CCLs in a manner comparable to that shown in S5 of Figure 4.8. Depending on dielectric strength

specifications (e.g., 5.0 kV/mil) and system thermal impedance (i.e., Ti =
dielectric thickness
thermal conductivity (Tc), e.g., 0.30∘C/W at
1.5 mils or 38 μm dielectric thickness), a uniform DFT of 1.5–10 mils is acceptable. It is typical to stack up as many
three-layer plates in a single press as possible at one time. Developing adhesion of the coating to dual substrates
during cure and laminating them under pressure, heat, and vacuum (e.g., 25 in-Hg) is essential for the production
of robustly functional products. Rheology studies of 𝜂*min (minimal viscosity) and gelation (the crossover of G′
and G′′) establish when and at what specific temperature pressure should be applied during production. Coating
overflowing in the press must be eliminated or minimized, which is also strongly related to the rheology of
dynamic melting and curing. In Chapter 5, cure kinetics and rheology are explored in depth. Appendices B
and C at the end of this chapter contain dissections of power (using IGBT dies) and LED modules.
4.4
Materials and System Properties of Cured Coatings
Materials properties are directly related to properly cured coatings, whereas system properties are more closely
related to coatings and substrates in conjunction. Please note that materials and system properties are rarely
considered separately; rather, they are interdependent, particularly when it comes to meeting CTQ’s for specific
end applications. Without limiting to theory, the properties of cured coating are primarily mechanical, thermal,
electrical, chemical, and combinations thereof, as summarized in Table 4.7, and are applicable to both surface
coatings and structural laminates (excluding optical).
From a material and systematic standpoint, including epoxy systems, some coating characteristics are of
universal importance, including the glass transition temperature (Tg), flexibility (a deformation or strain in
response to an applied stress), cohesion and toughness, permeability, and, perhaps most importantly, adhesion.
These properties have direct or indirect effects on other crucial product attributes, such as chemical and corrosion
resistance, long-term stability, and structural reliability (such as responses to an accelerated autoclave, HWA
and CDT), and so on. Unless thermally conductive fillers are incorporated, the thermal conductivity of regularly
filled or unfilled epoxy coatings is typically low, between 0.1 and 0.2 W/m-∘K. The coating’s CTE in ppm/ ∘C)
is more significant and concerning for structured laminates than for surface coatings, where CTE mismatches
between polymer coatings and substrates may risk adhesion or system failures of delamination and/or cracking.
Lightfastness is a material property associated with weatherability that distinguishes the exteriors from the
interiors.
Table 4.8 contains common testing standards (e.g., dielectric strength or voltage breakdown) and industry-
specific protocols (e.g., CDT and three-phase autoclave) applicable to surface- and laminate-oriented coatings
implemented primarily in the United States and Canada, as well as internationally. Overall, ensuring system
quality and performance (e.g., a product consisting of coatings and substrates) is of much greater importance

than cured coatings as a material. The majority of these methods or techniques are destructive, and their expo-
sure is also irreversible. There are sizable amounts of sub-industry- and application-specific testing specifications
(such as the United States’ AWWA C213 and C550 for water and wastewater, ASTM D6083 for elastomeric roof
coatings) that are not yet included, but they can be easily located through a search. In addition, each country
or economic entity may have its own national or regional testing standards for coatings, such as China’s GB,
Japan’s JIS, the United Kingdom’s WRAS (equivalent to AWWA), every EU member state, Australia, etc. Specifi-
cally, and additionally, for structural laminates, considering IMS coatings as an example, CTE (per ASTM D3386)
and Tc cover the necessary thermal properties, dielectric constant per ASTM D150, and resistivity per ASTM D257,
besides voltage breakdown complete electrical features, peel strength per ASTM D2861 and modulus per ASTM
4065 plus Tg per ASTM E1356 comprise mechanicals, water vapor retention per ASTM E595 represents primary
chemical properties, as well as the solder limit rating (i.e., UL maximum operating temperature) per UL746,
flammability per UL94, and CTI (UL comparative tracking index) per ASTM D3638 constitute agency ratings
and durability.
Concerning cured coating film properties, mechanical stress (𝜏)-strain (𝜀or 𝛾) behaviors are significant, such as
elastic modulus (also known as Young’s modulus, E′, a sum effect of temperature and MWs), yield tensile strength
(𝜏y), as well as elongation and tensile strength at break, as shown in Figure 4.9a. Explicitly, modulus equals Δ𝜏/Δ𝜀,
that is, the underlying reciprocal of creep = Δ𝜀(t)/Δ𝜏, which denotes the time-dependent elongation subject to
a rapid application of a constant stress and indicates the slope of the initial linear stage of the 𝜏-𝜀profile. The
steeper the slope, the greater the coating material’s or product’s modulus value. For 𝜏-𝜀relationships, 𝜏is not only
ε-dependent but also strain rate ( ̇𝜖or ̇𝛾)-dependent, which is also applicable and crucial to viscoelasticity (VE)
and rheological responses of epoxy coatings, which will be explicated in further detail later. As a result, how hard
(representing the extent of a strain) and how fast (representing the strain rate) CPs are bended leads to drastically
different flexibility results. Moduli measured by a tensile tester (e.g., Instron) and storage moduli (E′) obtained by
a dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA, e.g., TA Instruments’ DMA 850) in a tension film mode on cured coating
film samples are essentially consistent with one another but do not necessarily have the same numerical values
or magnitudes. Please note that cured film DMA totally differentiates from rheological DMA on uncured coating
specimens, which is performed using a rheometer such as TA Instruments’s ARES G2. DMA rheology will be
discussed in the following section.

The hardness of cured coatings on substrates is one of the system parameters most frequently evaluated. Sev-
eral methods, like Shore, pencil, Rockwell, and Barcol, can be used to quantify hardness; however, relationships
between them are not always available. Nano-indentation is a nondestructive test that measures the surface hard-
ness and micro-scratch resistance. Silane- and siloxane-based crosslinkers and additives increase surface hardness
to better resist scratches, for example, wood and metal substrates, for example, anti-graffiti applications as previ-
ously discussed, such as Vestanat EP-M 60 silane, Tegopren® 6875 and Tegomer® M-Si 2650 siloxanes (e.g., for
particularly unsaturated polyesters with MEK peroxide initiators), and so forth.
In the instance of cured film DMA, as demonstrated in Figure 4.9b, the data from a temperature ramping are
read and explained as follows: First, as conducted under the settings of a tension film mode, a strain controlled
constantly at 1.0 Hz, and an underlying heating rate of 3.0 ∘C/min, the dynamic analysis measures and reports
stresses; as a result, tensile E′ and E′′ (i.e., Young’s storage and loss moduli) are reported. Second, when the bulk
strength begins to decline rapidly (i.e., onsets of moduli), the Tg of the cured coating is approximated by E′′
max
(the loss modulus) at 103.13 ∘C, or the first Tan(𝛿)max = (E′′/E′)max peak at 108.29 ∘C, or the first E′′/E′ crossover
point at 104.61 ∘C (which may not be observed for thermoplastics or non-reactive adhesives), which is in close

agreement with the actual cured Tg of 104.6 ∘C as recorded by DSC. Third, the onset and endset of E′ at 101.50 ∘C
and 112.73 ∘C represent the softening (i.e., the beginning of the glass-rubber transition state) and the beginning of
the plateau or pseudo-plateau modulus that indicates crosslinking-derived heat-resistant behaviors; the higher the
modulus, for example, as high as 2.6565 MPa at 150 ∘C in this example, the better the heat resistance of the cured
coating. Last, while crossing the temperature range from 0 (or −50 ∘C) to 175 ∘C, the cured film, when subjected
to continual heating, first transforms from a hard glass state until ∼101.5 ∘C to a transient viscoelastic state until
∼112.73 ∘C, and then to a soft rubbery state until the end of the test. For high Tg coatings, cured film DMA must
be run up to a substantially higher temperature than the Tg to cover all phases; for instance, it is reasonable to run
up to 250 ∘C for samples of a Tg of 200 ∘C and perhaps up to 300 ∘C for those with Tgs of 240–250 ∘C. Note that
the creep compliance (i.e., a large strain or deformation when subjected to a rapid application of a constant stress,
especially at a low frequency) of a thermosetting coating or a thermoplastic material can be examined using cured
film DMA with a frequency sweep. A coating product exhibiting a higher E′ and a lower Tan(𝛿) at low frequency
ranges is believed to have a greater resistance to creep. For hotmelts (HMs) and pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs)
to be effective, a high creep value corresponding to a low modulus E′ is preferred, such as less than ∼0.3 MPa or
∼3 × 106 dynes/cm2, also known as Dahlquist Criteria (refer to Figure 10.4a in Chapter 10).
Historical and statistical data indicate flexibility is inversely related to modulus (E′), but gouge (i.e., weight
scrape testing) is linearly proportional to bulk hardness and modulus and inversely proportional to elongation.
UV exposure does not appear to visibly affect the FTIR fingerprints of cured epoxy coatings. In addition, the flex-
ibility of cured epoxy coatings exposed to UV light over time is considerably impaired; yet the impact resistance
and voltage breakdown (i.e., dielectric strength) are noticeably enhanced. Elasticity is a thermodynamically or
vibrationally reversible deformation that is linearly correlated to a stress per Hooke’s law (refer to Table 5.15 in
Chapter 5); plasticity, on the other hand, is a structurally or kinetically irreversible strain that is non-linearly
related to a stress. Flexibility (defined as a strain) is essentially a function of elasticity and plasticity, with adhesion
and toughness (or cohesion) also playing a role. The moisture barrier property (e.g., by WVTR) of epoxy coatings
is more about the hydrophobicity to repel water, which is subtly distinct from moisture absorption or water uptake
(e.g., by immersion) caused by free volumes available in the crosslinked network of coatings, of which the critical
water content at molecular levels remains unaffected. Hydrophobicity, which includes surface repellence, com-
plements impermeability, or the moisture barrier. Moisture resistance generally decreases when epoxy resin MWs
increase due to a drop in crosslinking density (or Tg), which likewise trends in the opposite direction of epoxy

resin MWs. In other words, moisture impermeability improves with increasing Tg, but Tg is negatively impacted
by water absorption, a bulk material property of coatings that is different from surface moisture impermeability. Tg
is directly proportional to crosslinking density (xld or CD for short, always ≤1.0), which is quantitatively approx-
imated by the tensile storage modulus E′ (from cured film DMA) or alternatively by the shear storage mosulus G′
(from rheology DMA) because E′ ≈3G′ when the material (for example, epoxy coatings) is incompressible (refer
to Equation 15b in Chapter 5), as follows:

crosslinks, the universal gas constant (8.314 J/mol-∘K), the absolute temperature, the density of the crosslinked
polymer, and the modulus determined at the selected temperature (T) within the rubbery plateau region, respec-
tively. Using Figure 4.9b, where E′ = 2.6565 MPa (1 Pa = 1 N/m2) at 150 ∘C or 423.15 ∘K (inside the pseudo-rubbery

Still focusing on testing methodologies, cathodic protection is widely approved for OD coated pipelines in the
field (typically 0.2–0.3 V applied), and there are great reports in this regard by Xu et al. and Det Norske Veritas
[55, 56]. As depicted in Figure 4.10a, CDT (cathodic disbondment test) up to 28 days is a routine laboratory test
for OD steel pipe epoxy coatings with a holiday drilled and a voltage (typically 1.5 or 3.0 V) applied while holding
salty water in a cell that is glued on top of the coating (a physical barrier except for the hole). CDT is comprised
of four parameters: time, temperature, voltage, and salt water (O2 and electrolyte sources at a neutral pH of ∼7.0).
Consequently, the reaction Cl−→1/2 Cl2 + e−takes place anodically or on a platinum wire, while the other reaction
2H2O →2OH−+ H2↑occurs cathodic-ally or via the holiday, and hypochlorite develops as a result of Cl2 + 2OH−
⇒H2O + Cl−+ ClO−in the end. In order to determine the corrosion-resistant performance, The delamination
starting from the holiday is measured at the conclusion of testing, and an acceptable benchmark, such as a control
or competitor product, is always tested in parallel, as is recommended. CDT essentially assesses the combined
effect on corrosion of a coating’s wet adhesion to a substrate and its film permeability at a given DFT. Corrosion
behaviors are profoundly influenced by a pH environment; for example, iron corrosion develops fast and linearly at
pH values below 4.0, then levels out at pH values between 4.0 and 10.0 and slows down linearly at pH values above
10. In contrast, aluminum corrosion is at its lowest when the pH is between 5.0 and 6.0, but it increases when the
pH is less than 5.0 or greater than 6.0. Electrolytes (e.g., NaCl) and dissolved oxygen (DO) are two essential factors

for corrosion to take place; seawater typically contains a NaCl concentration of 3–5%, and the DO concentration
in saltwater decreases as temperature rises, for example, dropping from ∼14 ppm at 0 ∘C to about ∼7 ppm at 35 ∘C.
To predict corrosion resistance, EIS (electrochemical impedance spectroscopy), as displayed in Figure 4.10b,
examines the film permeability-driven electrical impedance (or modulus in 𝛺instead of Pa) of a coating against
frequencies in Hz. EIS is more applicable to thin films, as a thicker film of a coating is always expected to improve
EIS performance. EIS results are simple and straightforward regarding impedance changes over time and are
typically explained via Bode (|Z| versus Hz) and/or Nyquist (Zimaginary versus Zreal) plots, as shown in Figure 4.11,
where theoretically equivalent circuits for a perfect and a damaged coating are also included as a reference. The
electrical resistance (R) of a coating can be computed assuming a coating thickness of 400 μm (or 16 mils or
0.04 cm), an area coverage of 1 m2 (or 10,000 cm2), and a volume resistivity of 5.6x1013 Ω•cm (as per ASTM D257),
as follows:

An intact coating and a defective coating may differ significantly in terms of EIS modulus versus frequency
(Figures 4.11a/b-2/b-3). Actual EIS results for an applied epoxy coating on a steel substrate are characteristic, par-
ticularly in the low and high frequency zones (Figures 4.11c-1/c-2). For example, with low f’s, modulus initially
decreases and subsequently increases over time, indicating that corrosion is taking place; thus, oxidized layers
accumulate at the interface. EIS data can be conveniently collected in 30 to 60 minutes upon the commencement
of aging. Historical EIS data reveal that an epoxy coating with a polyurethane topcoat tends to significantly out-
perform an epoxy basecoat system alone. Note with caution that equivalent circuits are not necessarily universally
representative unless they are experimentally validated to fit coated products in the field, instead of small sections
of samples arbitrarily assembled in the lab. In addition, EIS data must never be overexplained, as its practical value
is limited.
As previously described, impermeability and water absorption are two subtly different concepts, although they
may be correlated one way or the other; cautions should be exercised when employing them interchangeably.
Many bulk properties, including Tg and dielectric constant (Dk), are degraded by the plasticizing effect caused
by the absorption of water or moisture into the free volumes of the bulk coating film. Hot water soak adhesion
testing appears to evaluate the responses of cured coatings to hot water and is often carried out at 75 and 95 ∘C
for a continuous period of time, for instance, 28 days. The resistance to blistering, swelling, and the extent to
which delamination occurs upon knife picking off, etc. are all utilized to evaluate the materials and system perfor-
mance, which is fundamentally associated with adhesion, impermeability, and cohesion. In addition, HWA panels
(e.g., 4′′ × 4′′ × 1/4′′) encapsulated by an underlying coating at a given DFT can be used for water absorption or
uptake during the same period of testing in terms of g/g or g/mm2, enabling additional and robust comparisons
of formulations, particularly when cross-checked with WVTR data (on free films). Separately, the biased 85/85
or temperature humidity bias (THB) test up to typically 1,000 hours represents a standard and the most severe
humidity exposure, perhaps second only to Norsok M-501, for certain coated products, such as high-performance
semi-conducting components or modules made from PCBs and MCPCBs. This chamber test assesses the stabil-
ity and reliability of a coating or dielectric laminate under highly accelerated stress (including voltage-applied
self-heating) in terms of corrosion and other humidity-driven degradation.
For chemical resistance and corrosion testing, autoclave tests imitate HTHP conditions. As depicted in
Figure 4.12, three-phase autoclaves typically run a brine (or a NaCl solution) at the bottom, a hydrocarbon
medium in the middle, and a sour gas supercritical fluid (such as H2S and/or CO2) on top, due to the density
differences of these fluids under HTHP settings of, for example, 150 ∘C and 3,500 psi, and for 24 or 72 hours,
etc. Consequently, the corrosion and degradation of coatings pertinent to adhesion, cohesion toughness, and
impermeability in a harsh environment consisting of very different media such as salt water, solvents, and

acids are evaluated concurrently and adequately based on observations and results of delamination, blistering,

Characterization of Uncured Coatings
The most important and perhaps universal characteristics applicable to uncured coatings and adhesives, regardless
of whether they are liquid or powder epoxy systems, are cure kinetics and rheology. Thermal techniques such as
DSC according to ASTM 3418/E1356 and modifications, DMA rheometers (e.g., TA Instruments’ ARES G2, as
shown in Figure 4.15a) compliant to ASTM D4473 and modifications, as well as others such as DEA (dielectric
analysis), can readily quantify this pair of attributes. DEA will be discussed in this section as a supporting tool,
and DSC kinetics and DMA rheology (in a shear mode) will be comprehensively covered in the following chapter.
First, the pertinent properties of uncured coatings and the fundamentals of DSC and rheology DMA should be
understood. Gel times measured on hot plates according to CSA Z245.20 Section 12.2 (or alternatively ASTM
D3451/D4217) and inclined plate flows according to CSA Z245.20 Section 12.1, respectively, are typical testing
items to run, particularly for powder coatings, as are density, particle sizes, etc. Typical characteristics of liquid
coatings include viscosity (e.g., as measured by Brookfield viscometers), solids content, Hegman scaled particle
size, VOC, pH if WB, and PVC. Using a rheometer, the shelf life or open times of 1/2K liquids upon mixing at a
given temperature can be determined from a profile of viscosity doubling versus time.
It is straightforward to run DSC and rheology DMA on uncured solvent-free coatings, such as powders and liq-
uids containing 100% solids, because samples can be directly loaded as needed. When running 1/2K SB coatings,
coating samples must be adequately mixed and conditioned to purge away solvents, preferably without concerns
for premature curing ahead of loading (e.g., prepregs are conditioned until solvent-free prior to loading samples).
Hands-on skills to properly handle various types of samples for the successful execution of a particular tech-
nique or protocol are always advantageous. DSC is a highly quantitative and information-rich tool for monitoring
heat-induced transitions, such as Tm, a first-order transition with discontinuities in volume and enthalpy, and Tg,
a second-order transition with discontinuities in CTE and heat capacity Cp (= ΔH/ΔT), and the cure behaviors
of reactive polymer coatings, including epoxy systems. DSC exothermic curves detect the instantaneous sum heat
flow of all (not individual) cure reactions; for epoxy coatings, that means the collective thermal responses of co-
(epoxy-crosslinker) and homo (epoxy-epoxy) cures. Data collection and interpretation of standard DSC on coating
samples are herein focused on, as opposed to the physicochemical mechanisms behind DSC, which may be found
in open-access literature by Menczel et al. [59]. Figure 4.13 depicts DSC exotherms for solvent-free epoxy coatings
that are uncured and cured, respectively.
The following are technical interpretations of DSC exotherms based on Figures 4.13a/b. First, “Exo up”
indicates that exothermic profiles position up and endothermic (if any) profiles position down; consequently,
the enthalpy (ΔH) for the uncured and cured coating should be rationally reported as −62.388 and −2.7333 J/g,
respectively, with the minus sign indicating reaction heat released (i.e., exothermic). In other words, the total
curing or crosslinking reactions of the coating produced heat rather than absorbing energy (i.e., endothermic).
Second, tests on uncured and cured samples (Figures 4.13a/b) are conducted in accordance with each conven-
tional procedure specified (with slight discrepancies) and not in any modulated mode. Third, each DSC test
consists of two consequential scans at a specific heating rate (i.e., 𝛽, such as 20 ∘C/min for all in this case) and
up to a maximum temperature (250 and 160 ∘C in Figure 4.13a, and 225 and 160 ∘C in Figure 4.13b, respectively)
according to the executed “Program” as listed as an insert. The heating rate (𝛽) and maximum temperature
settings are subject to changes based on the Tg of formulations, gel and cure schedules, etc. Specifically, 𝛽affects
thermal output values but not Tg or ΔH under the assumption of complete curing; the faster the 𝛽, the greater
Tonset and Tpeak, for example, at 109.0 and 148.4 ∘C in Figure 4.13a, respectively. Always choose the maximum
temperature properly to ensure cure completion (i.e., the exothermic curve after Tpeak drops down to a baseline

level). When working with an under-catalyzed system or one with a high Tg (e.g., >180 ∘C), it is more likely
that higher maximum temperatures are required. Please note that Tonset is apparent or nominal, not actual, and
is typically more instructive for processing settings such as powder coating extrusion temperatures. Tpeak is the
temperature at which or close to which the maximum cure rate ( ̇𝛼) takes place kinetically. Rarely, in practice,
is a cure temperature lower than Tpeak. Fourth, Figure 4.13a’s first midpoint at 71.69 ∘C represents the FBE
coating’s uncured Tg1 (also known as Tg, powder), which denotes the coating’s melting temperature; hence, Tg1
is typically used to define the maximum permissible storage and transit temperature. Fifth, the second midpoint
at 103.86 ∘C (black) in Figure 4.13a, as well as the two midpoints at 101.99 ∘C (blue) and 104.27 ∘C (red) in
Figure 4.13b, all indicate Tgs; specifically, Tg2 (cure in machine or formulation capable Tg), Tg3 (actual), and Tg4
(maximum), respectively. The difference between Tg3 and Tg4 approximates the under-cure level, which is more
accurately determined by the residual ΔH, for example, 2.7333 J/g in Figure 4.13b. As a result, the under-cure
level for this coating is estimated as residualΔH
TotalΔH
= 2.7333
62.388 = 4.38%, where the total ΔH is derived from Figure 4.13a’s
initial enthalpy. Please note that under cures of up to 5–10% are acceptable for certain epoxy coatings (e.g., rebar
coatings), despite the fact that a complete cure is usually preferable for optimal performance. Last, and for these
two DSC exhibitions, the first scan in Figure 4.13b determines to what extent the coating film was cured, whereas
the second scans at 20 ∘C/min to 160 ∘C in Figures 4.13a/b are used to determine for the post-cure Tg.
The most common temperature-modulated DSC technique, or TMDSC, imposes a sinusoidal heating profile
that resolves overlapping transitions by separating the reversible component (e.g., heat capacity Cp = ΔH
ΔT ) and
non-reversible component (e.g., crosslinking) out of the overall heat flow. TMDSC is useful for ascertaining com-
plex transitions including real Tgs, such as the dual Tg of formulations solely from the reversing signal (applied
to cured film samples in this situation). Reversing and non-reversing components are analogous to inventories
and incremental assets, respectively, when discussing the economy. As illustrated in Figure 4.14 for a solvent-free
coating consisting of epoxy and bismaleimide (BMI) of 85 and 15% by weight, respectively, the reversible heat flow
reveals Tg1 at 89.6 ∘C representing the powder’s melting onset, and the non-reversible profile is overlapped with
two peak temperatures at 102.2 ∘C and 123.2 ∘C, respectively, indicative correspondingly of dual reactions tak-
ing place, generating an overall high exotherm (–158.2 J/g). Apparently, the coating is already substantially cured
when it melts at approximately Tg1, which is ahead of the initial peak temperature. The approximation of kinetic
parameters according to a suitable model is based either on the single underlying exothermic curve from a conven-
tional DSC or on the crosslinking-associated irreversible exothermic curve from TMDSC. Please note that estab-
lishing the arbitrary baseline under the curve, which is frequently one of the user-defined variables, can be chal-
lenging because even a minor modification in its selection can have a substantial impact on the analytical results.
Rheology DMA and DEA are thermal techniques that monitor dynamic mechanical viscosity (𝜂*) and ion
viscosity (𝜌DC) versus temperature or time, respectively, to reveal the cure status of a thermosetting system, such

as epoxy coatings, from an uncured A-stage to a partially cured B-stage (before gelation) to a fully cured C-stage.
The 𝜌DC in ohms under a DC (direct current) is equivalent to resistivity 𝜌, or the inverse of conductivity 𝜎, which
measures the mobility of free ions through a medium under the influence of an electric field. In particular, rheol-
ogy DMA evaluates viscoelastic behaviors under a controlled temperature ramp, while DEA illustrates dielectric
variations in response. Figure 4.15 depicts that a DMA rheometer reports dynamic viscosity (𝜂* in Pa-s, i.e., rhe-
ology), shear storage and loss moduli (G′ and G′′ in Pa, not tensile moduli E′ and E′′ in Pa), Tan𝛿(= G′′/G′), and
other parameters at a defined heat rate (𝛽) or ramped temperature, strain (𝛾), and frequency (f). Following is a
summary of the most important data readings and explanations for rheology, DMA, and dielectric DEA. According
to Figure 4.15b, the coating melts and flows under heat (at 7.0 ∘C/min), reaching 𝜂*min at 118.6 ∘C just before the
gelling point at 119.9 ∘C, which is estimated by the crossover of G′ and G′′, and the coating is fully cured when the
temperature rises to 155.86 ∘C, at which G′ and 𝜂* both reach their maximums; continuous heat begins to soften
the cured coating thereafter. Tan(𝛿) reaches its dynamic maximum at 113.3 ∘C, which corresponds to the actual
cured Tg of 104.8 ∘C determined by DSC.
DEA instead establishes profiles of f-independent ion viscosity 𝜌DC and f-dependent loss factor 𝜀′′ across a
ramped temperature and/or frequency range, considering an equivalent circuit model (Figure 4.16a) [58]. The loss
factor 𝜀′′ in dielectric DEA appears to be comparable to the loss modulus G′′ in rheology DMA. Please note that
the frequency determines the magnitude of the ionic conductivity 𝜎or resistivity 𝜌. Specifically, in the early curing
stage, when the material is most conductive in terms of bulk ion flow, the f-independent 𝜎tends to dominate; 𝜎
may continue to dominate throughout the curing process at low f’s. In this case, 𝜀′′ is inversely proportional to f.
During a later stage of curing, f-dependent 𝜎due to dipoles may begin to dominate the dielectric response, espe-
cially at high f’s. It is important to identify these times and f’s in order to avoid misinterpretation of data for cure
monitoring. The f-dependent dipolar relaxations resulting from vitrification tend to manifest as shoulders in the
loss factor 𝜀′′ profiles, especially at high f’s. Accordingly, Figure 4.16b reveals that ion viscosity 𝜌decreases rapidly
in response to applied heat reaching CP2 (i.e., the critical point at which minimal viscosity and maximal con-
ductivity occur), then rises substantially due to crosslinking that impedes ion mobility, typically proportionately
with mechanical viscosity, until they diverge around the time of gelation (CP3). CP3 can also be determined using
the peak point of the contingent slope curve of log(ion viscosity 𝜌), that is, the d[log(ion viscosity 𝜌)]/dt—time (t)
plot. Rheology DMA and dielectric DEA both detect the minimum viscosity (correspondingly close to the highest

ionic conductivity), the gel point, and vitrification (if present) during a thermosetting cure. In practice, minimal
viscosity and gelation are important parameters; for example, injection molding compounds should be formu-
lated to flow at minimal viscosity before gelation occurs. Typically, diverged G′′ in DMA and dipolar relaxations as
shoulders of the loss factor 𝜀′′ in DEA are able to capture f-dependent vitrification, a reversible B-stage. Tg cannot
be determined directly by DEA unless enthalpy from DSC is obtained, and DEA requires an appropriate sensor
and fixture for sample preparation. Commercially available simultaneous-DMA-DEA equipment and techniques
consolidate viscosity and dielectric dynamics in tandem for instantaneous gel point detection.
Summarily, and in comparison, DSC enables the determination of kinetic events such as the proceedings of
cure reactions by exotherms, the maximum cure rate ( ̇𝛼max) by Tpeak, and other variables, in addition to the most
commonly measured Tg and enthalpy (ΔH), but neither vitrification (unless TMDSC is applied) nor gelation. The
glass transition occurs at a range of temperatures; as a result, the value varies depending on the methodology
employed. DSC determination of Tg for epoxy coatings is essentially via a heat capacity (Cp) jump commensurate
with the most widely accepted method, followed by standard DMAs on cured films via tensile loss modulus E′′ or
Tan(𝛿max) or the onset of storage modulus E′, TMA on cured films via CTE, as well as rheology DMA on uncured
samples via shear loss modulus G′′ and Tan(𝛿max); in terms of values, they are all relatively close to one another,

non-thermosetting material, as included in Table 4.9. TRIOS, software provided by TA Instruments, is capable of
performing a variety of executions and operations on DSC, rheology DMA, and cured film DMA data, including,
among others, exothermic curve stacking, integration, onsets, and crossover analysis. Nevertheless, for the most
effective optimization and development of integrated formulations, DSC and rheology DMA are ideally combined
with physical tests such as adhesion, flexibility, impact toughness, CDT, and salt spray, as discussed previously.
Debrief E Illustrations of applied coating technology
Wood coatings
Wood coatings constitute a significant sector and area of innovation within the coatings industry. The fact that
the structural properties of various wood species vary is a critical consideration in formulation development.
The structural properties comprise density, pore size, grain structure, surface anisotropy, and natural oil content,
among others. In addition, surface wetting is an even more important factor to consider than others for developing
wood coatings. For example, the hard and tight-grained nature of oak wood impedes coating penetration, pine and
redwood are high in rosin content, and the presence of oils in tropical woods impairs wetting.
The overall applications and formulation technologies for wood coatings are detailed in Table 4.10; for
comprehensive liquid chemistry and composition information, readers are encouraged to consult Table 4.2.
Ambient-temperature curable coatings consist of SB varnishes, 2K polyurethanes or PURs (SB and WB), unsat-
urated (C=C) polyesters, and WB self-crosslinking systems. Low-solid varnishes include traditional rosin and
unsaturated oil. PURs are inherently weather-resistant. Polyesters comprising unsaturated (C=C) molecules
and, in most cases, styrene generally have low VOCs and are capable of high DFT due to their HS content.
WB self-crosslinking coatings are based on acrylics and/or urethanes with nearly zero or zero VOCs, a driving
force behind the development of the most innovative products. Wood coatings that can be cued at elevated
temperatures comprise primarily catalyzed varnishes, crosslinked solid color coatings, and low-temperature (e.g.,
150 ∘C) and dual-cure (thermal and UV) powder coatings. Typically, melamine-cured or based on UF resins (refer
to Debrief A in Chapter 8), catalyzed varnishes produce hard and durable films but are losing market share due
to formaldehyde and VOC concerns. Curing primarily with amino resins (refer to Table 4.2), crosslinked solid

color systems find application in engineering wood composites (such as MDFs), office furniture, DIY furniture,

or GMA-based (refer to Table 2.3e and Figure 2.5 in Chapter 2, respectively), are most effective when applied
in a solid color to engineered wood or other temperature-stable substrates. In contrast, radiant-energy-curable
coatings fall into three distinct categories: EB-cured sealers, UV-cured stains, and UV-cured topcoats. Sealers
are capable of very rapid cure at high process rates as they can penetrate deeply into substrates; however, curing
equipment is expensive. UV-curable stains are capable of curing very quickly and are ideal for semi-transparent
colors due to their minimal penetration distance by UV light and relatively inexpensive equipment. UV-curable
topcoats typically contain low VOCs or are 100% solids (considered “green”), best for clearcoats.
Wood coatings continue to evolve toward the following trends: engineered wood products, robust fire retardant
for building products, removal of highly concerned substances, biobased and renewable ingredients, lower tem-
perature cure or application (LAT, e.g., 125 ∘C) powders (refer to Debrief B in Chapter 6), and lower energy UV
(possibly UV-LED).
Road markings and trafﬁc paints
The United States road infrastructure, including highways, is arguably the most extensive in the world, encom-
passing over 4.1 million miles of public roads [61]. In conjunction with traffic signs and signals, road markings and
traffic paints are essential components of traffic control devices and measures designed to safeguard traffic safety
on the road. Paints and coatings are extensively utilized in the manufacture of road markings as well as in adja-
cent applications such as pavement markings for parking lots and airfields. The total US market for traffic paints
was valued at approximately USD 710 million in 2023, representing 10% of the value of the special-purpose coat-
ings segment. Traffic paints and road markings are predominately produced using two non-reactive technologies:
waterborne (WB) paints and hotmelt (HM) thermoplastics. As opposed to solvent-borne (SB) chlorinated rubber
and alkyd coatings, which were prevalent prior to the 1990s, acrylic latex-based WB coatings are the most widely
used type of traffic paint today due to their fast dry times and low-VOC emissions. Latex resins are emulsions of
soft polymer particles in water that solidify and form films upon coalescence. Acrylics are generally resistant to

122
4 Concepts, Utilities, Methods, and Techniques
weathering and durable, with great adhesion to the asphalt and concrete surfaces of roadways. Multi-component
liquid coatings that utilize highly crosslinked films, such as 2K epoxies and polyureas, which exhibit superior
adhesion to the road surface and enhanced resistance to wear and abrasion, can be utilized when enhanced film
toughness (and thus extended service life) is desired. Methyl methacrylate (MMA) coatings, alternatively known
as cold plastic, are an additional HS solution for road markings; these coatings consist of acrylic monomers and
oligomers at 100% solids that are combined with peroxide initiators prior to application. Due to their high cost,
however, these crosslinked coatings are less common than WB coatings. HM thermoplastics (such as polyesters
and polyamides; refer to Figure 10.6a in Chapter 10) comprising 100% solids and having a typical softening point
of, for example, 120 ∘C represent another prevalent road marking technology in solid form (along with optional
plasticizers) that is reworkable.
Functional color (white and yellow colors preferred) and contrast with the road surface for visibility, especially
during the daytime, in addition to adhesion and abrasion resistance, are important attributes of traffic paints.
Retroreflectivity is essential for ensuring nighttime visibility, which is achieved by incorporating retroreflective
glass beads into the road and pavement marking paints, specifically throughout the top thermoplastic layer. The
glass beads must partially protrude from the film surface (e.g., optimally 50%) to function; parameters for addition
include bead size, refractive index, and weight loading of beads. Retroreflectivity can be measured using portable
instruments according to standard methods, such as ASTM E1710 for dry conditions and ASTM E2177/E2832
for wet conditions, respectively. Durability of road markings and traffic paints, measurable according to ASTM
D913, is affected by factors such as adhesion to the road surface, toughness, weathering, and abrasion resistance;
poor durability leads to loss of color and visibility even in daylight. Dry time as a key property of traffic paints,
particularly for liquid coatings such as WB acrylics, can be assessed according to ASTM D713. Rapid dry times are
important to prevent the tracking of paint if wet lines are run over by traffic or washed by rainwater.
Debrief F Reverse engineering
Every day, small and large inventions are made in the coatings industry; therefore, it is essential for formulators
to stay abreast of the most recent technologies, which encompass diverse competitions and continue to improve
applied formulations and products. Reverse engineering is important for not only quality control (which is about
consistency) but also for technical advancements (which are about innovation), including the impartial inspiration
of patents and the legal detection of potential commercial infractions. As far as epoxy coating formulations are con-
cerned, the techniques listed in Table 4.11 can be applied and combined to reveal major formulation compositions
qualitatively and sometimes quantitatively or semi-quantitatively to the greatest extent possible.
Reactive polymer coatings, such as epoxies, are typically comprised of bulk resins, crosslinkers, catalysts, pig-
ments, fillers, flow agents, and additives (reactive and/or inert) as required, excluding solvents and diluents.

Reverse engineering is always complemented by the inclusion of a control or reference sample, as it is other-
wise difficult to quantify a totally unknown blend of ingredients or fractional compositions. Specifically, FTIR is
generic but useful in identifying initial or overall signal patterns of curing chemistry, such as amines as opposed to
phenolics as the underlying crosslinkers. As an exhibition, Figure 4.17 displays multiple peaks between 1,600 and
750 cm–1 for epoxy-phenolic coatings versus only two significant peaks at 1,405 and 950 cm–1 for epoxy-dihydrazide
formulations, in addition to the shared signal at 1,139.1 cm–1 attributable to ethylene oxides and ether linkages in
epoxies.
Tg determined by DSC is sometimes strong evidence for further characterization; for example, for the two for-
mulations in Figure 4.17, the cured Tgs for phenolic crosslinkers typically range from 105 to 108 ∘C, whereas Tgs
for dihydrazides are characteristically lower, ranging from 98 to 102 ∘C. In addition, DSC unanimously detects
significantly lower exotherms for Type 7 than Type 5 (e.g., −35.0 J/g versus −55.0 J/g) when each is used as the
bulk binder resin. Light-scattering GPC (reporting absolute MWs) is better suited for pure resin samples than com-
pounded coating samples; instead, standard GPC (with a differential refractive index, or RI detector) that reports
comparative MWs relative to styrene standards is more appropriate. Please note that MWs by RI GPC are a sum of
binder resins (such as epoxies) and crosslinkers from a 1K coating sample, with the former typically dominating;
this is technically informative, particularly when a reference specimen is tested in parallel. NMR is a powerful
technique for identifying and characterizing the chemical structures of resins, crosslinkers, catalysts, and addi-
tives; however, its sensitivity is highly dependent on sample concentrations and preparation, and it is sometimes
unable to detect key components with trace amounts or poor solubility in solvents (e.g., chloroform).
Figure 4.18 exhibits the proton (1H)-NMR spectrum of an FBE coating formulated with a BPA-based epoxy (refer
to Figure 1.1 in Chapter 1) and a BPA-based phenolic crosslinker (refer to Figure 2.6d in Chapter 2) with an imi-
dazole adduct (refer to Table 2.5f in Chapter 2) as the catalysts. Clearly, these reactive ingredients are all identified
in detail, and some of the consistent and non-overlapped signals can also be utilized for semi-quantitative purposes
as well. 1H-NMR spectra, such as the one exhibited in Figure 4.18, are more informative structurally than 13C-NMR
spectra, which nevertheless provide signals for verification. As general rules of thumb for 13C-NMR, acrylic poly-
mers typically exhibit weak peaks at ∼173 ppm, aromatic C’s at 160–100 ppm, aliphatic C’s at 80–30 ppm, qua-
ternary C’s at ∼40 ppm, and so forth. Again, NMRs are highly concentration-dependent, and solvent selection is

important; for example, DMSO outperforms chloroform in dissolving epoxy powder coatings because wax addi-
tives are sometimes incorporated. Use and selection of GC/MS or LC/MS for unknown coating characterization
depend on the MWs of the substances of interest: room temperature and high pressure. LC/MS is suitable for
detecting high MWs or large molecules that are difficult to evaporate (e.g., free BPA molecules), whereas high
temperature (HT)-GC/MS is more amenable to low MWs or small molecules (e.g., headspace trace benzene as an
impurity, wax as an additive). When a reference is calibrated, XRF (X-ray fluorescence) is useful for determining
the loading level of an additive or filler.
When necessary, other strategies and methods are considered. For example, ASAP (atmospheric solids analysis
probe mass spectrometry) can identify crosslinkers and catalysts relative to a reference. In Chapter 7, a facile
UV/visible spectroscopic protocol for qualifying and quantifying BPA-based phenolic resin crosslinkers in, for
instance, FBE systems is described in detail. Moreover, measurements of density, ash content, and elemental anal-
ysis can often identify the filler and pigment types and loading levels (and thus the P/B ratio and PVC). As a result,
high-density fillers such as BaSO4 (4.5 g/ml, comparable to 4.2 g/ml of TiO2 as a white pigment) and low-density
fillers such as CaCO3 (2.2 g/ml) can be easily distinguished. According to customer feedback, denser fillers such
as BaSO4 have advantages over looser fillers such as CaCO3 in at least weight-based powder coatings, not only
in terms of pricing but also performance, such as the sometimes-preferred thinner buildup, improved leveling,
and glossier finish. As an interesting point of reference, Vantablack® [62], created by the British company Surrey
NanoSystems, continues to hold the world record for the darkest man-made substance; it absorbs 99.965% of light.
On the opposite end of the spectrum, Purdue University scientists developed the whitest white paints (acrylic, 60%
PVC, or 562.5 phr as roughly calculated from BaSO4 with an appropriate nanoparticle size and a broad particle size
distribution) that reflect up to 97.6% of solar light [63], as certified and collected in the 2022 edition of Guinness
World Records, as well as winning the 2023 Innovation Award in the sustainability category by South by Southwest
Conference and Festivals (SXSW) [64]. However, the problem with cool-roof systems reflecting sunlight that are
currently on the market is that they continue to radiate heat out in the winter, thereby increasing the cost of home
heating. Recently, a temperature-adaptive radiative coating, or TARC, has been developed to enable energy savings
by automatically shutting off the radiative cooling in the winter or when the temperature falls below 25 ∘C using

tungsten-doped vanadium dioxide to overcome roof or window overcooling [65], as have low-emissivity (i.e., high
reflectance in IR wavelengths) paints [66]. Intriguingly, it has been recently reported that ultra-lightweight (sur-
face density 0.40 g/m2), pigment-free plasmonic paints utilize nanoscale structural arrangements of aluminum
and aluminum oxide to produce color [67], as has a thermochromic pigment consisting of crystal violet lactone,
which transforms the color from white at ambient temperature below 20 ∘C to dark within 20–30 ∘C [68].
In one respect, there is no universally applicable method. In another respect, historical and statistical data
on straight resins, crosslinkers, and other coating components, including a variety of additives, as well as on as
many commercial product offerings for similar applications as possible, are almost always useful for effective
reverse engineering of unidentified coating samples. The DSC enthalpy database mentioned previously is a use-
ful illustration. In addition, for instance, BPA-based phenolic crosslinkers typically contain free BPA from 25%
by weight for low-MW grades to 15% by weight for medium grades to 5% by weight for high-MW grades (refer
to Figure 7.2 in Chapter 7); thus, compounded coatings can be determined with respect to specific BPA-based
phenolics if they are incorporated as the crosslinkers by comparing the free BPA level to that of a known coating
reference.
Recaps and Highlights
Powder coatings are nearly always B-staged 1K systems based on weight or parts by weight, whereas liquid coatings
(SB, HS, solvent-free, and WB) are volume-based 1/2/3K systems depending on compatibility and latency; they can
be distinguished primarily by their solid contents and VOC levels. While the former is aggressively competing and
expanding quickly, the latter continues to dominate the market. In contrast to powder coatings, which can work
with high-MW epoxies and other resins for better performance, most liquid coatings (such as epoxies) deal with
solvents and co-solvents as well as relatively low-MW binder resins. When appropriately prepared, SB coatings
are perhaps the alternatives to powder coatings as both primers and base coats in terms of crucial properties such
as Tg, flexibility, toughness, and adhesion. E-coatings are a type of specialized liquid coatings; cathodic e-coatings
appear to be gaining popularity and are suitable for priming metal, including controlled (for use in automotive
and aerospace sectors) and uncontrolled (for use in general industries) steel and aluminum substrates. In a trend-
ing circular economy, WB coatings, particularly acrylic-based systems, continue to evolve in order to eventually
substitute SB counterparts.
The global market is still dominated by surface coatings on one or more (e.g., surface encapsulation) bulk sides of
substrates, while structural laminates (such as thermally conductive but electrically insulative MCPCB for mak-
ing LED and IGBT power modules) concurrently on one side of two substrates each, as well as self-contained
applications in the absence of substrates (such as molding and 3/4D printing), are crucial and occupy a niche
share. In contrast to surface coatings that are readily designed to cure fast in seconds or minutes depending on
end uses, coatings for structural laminates are frequently formulated to cure slowly (in hours) in order to reduce
crosslinking-induced stress buildup under heat, pressure, and vacuum and thereby prevent panel deformation
(e.g., warping). Surface coatings and structural laminates both require adhesion, whereas self-contained materi-
als just need cohesion. Surface coatings are typically used for a variety of exterior and interior utilities, including,
among others, wood finishes, coil and packaging, flooring, concrete, electrical insulation (e.g., busbar), and protec-
tion of metal against corrosion, fire, and graffiti. In addition to improved adhesion, HTHP applications, including
hydrogen barrier applications under pressure, require a material with a high Tg and strong impermeability. Formu-
lations are driven by applications, and unique applications are the drivers of outstanding formulations. As a result,
applied NISO and/or NIPU technologies, including Michael Addition-based pathways, find their applications in
coatings. Despite having advantages such as long potlife, low VOC, low odor, and being TDI-free, the ACURE tech-
nology has disadvantages, including RT-cured or dried film hardness that is considerably lower than conventional
2K PUR coatings in, for example, wood finishes. Hybrids and non-epoxy systems complement industrial epoxy
routes in the coatings industry, allowing for wide-ranging improvements and innovations.

4 Concepts, Utilities, Methods, and Techniques
Particularly for epoxy systems with complex curing reactions, the FI serves as the bloodline throughout the
formulation process, making it suitable for both the optimization of existing performance (continuous improve-
ments) and the development of new products (innovations). To attain the best of one or more desired properties
(e.g., flexibility, modulus, etc.) for a particular end-use application, there exists nearly always an optimal epoxy
formulation at a given loading level of a specific catalyst. Crosslinker-free formulations (i.e., at an infinite FI) rep-
resent an extreme scenario with unique performance, including the ability to cure at low temperatures. On the
molecular level, FIs regulate the ratio of epoxy homo-cures (in a chain-growth mode) to co-polymerization (in a
step-growth mode), which, in turn, determines the ultimate network topology after curing. Generic epoxy coating
formulations are tolerant of FIs and continue to function when the FI is less than, equal to, or greater than one,
albeit not necessarily at their peak performance. The most flexible epoxy coatings at low temperatures (down to
−45 ∘C), regardless of slow or rapid gel and cure rates, can be formulated with linear BPA-based epoxies in con-
junction with flexible crosslinkers such as BPA-based phenolics or linear amines at a moderate FI (e.g., 3.0 to 5.0);
using fluorene-based epoxies, it is possible to fabricate coatings with super high Tgs (up to 250 ∘C) together with
exceptional adhesion, toughness, and impermeability at a typical low FI (e.g., 1.0 to 2.0). Hence, FI-driven screen-
ing and optimization are effective for maximizing coating performance (e.g., flexibility), especially for systems
with a fixed resin and crosslinker package. Hence, there is always an optimal FI for a given maximal structural
performance under a specific catalyzation condition (a constant grade and level). In other words, there exists, for
a given FI, an optimal loading level of a specific catalyst for a proposed property to be superior. Understanding
and effectively executing the FI concept is one of the essential skills that enable formulators to “excel” in applied
epoxy coating formulations, as opposed to running DOE mindlessly, randomly, or at most maintaining a “good
enough” level.
Important material properties of cured coatings include glass transition temperature (Tg), cohesive modulus
and toughness, tensile and elongation, bending flexibility, hardness and abrasion, impermeability and moisture
resistance, thermal conductivity, dielectric strength, acid/alkali resistance, and weatherability, among others. To
measure or characterize these mechanical, thermal, electrical, chemical, and optical qualities, a wide range of test-
ing methods and standards can be used. Dry and wet adhesion is preferably considered as a system attribute linked
to interactions between a bulk coating and a specific substrate. Fundamentally, wet adhesion and impermeability
determine corrosion rates in a variety of end-user conditions. Several accelerated tests, such as CDT, autoclave,
HWA, and others, are commonly used to estimate the corrosion resistance of cured epoxy surface coatings, which
is probably the most important system function in practice. Effective metal (particularly steel) corrosion manage-
ment through segregation of surface coatings is multi-disciplinary, combining electrochemistry, materials, physics,
mechanical engineering, and chemical engineering.
Capabilities to characterize uncured coatings of known or unknown compositions are desirable for the advance-
ment of high-performance formulations, including, particularly, DSC kinetics in conjunction with rheology DMA.
When performed appropriately, kinetic DSC generates cure schedules for epoxy coatings and describes in-situ cure
behaviors in terms of conversion, viscosity, and modulus at any time or temperature when paired with rheology
DMA; both will be exclusively covered in the following chapter. Rheology DMA approximates the dynamic cur-
ing viscosity and shear moduli (G′ and G′′) rather than the tensile moduli (E′ and E′′) determined by standard
DMAs on cured coatings. Please remember that all rheology and viscosity issues are either stress (𝜏) or shear-rate
( ̇𝛾) driven, and all applicable testing techniques are either stress (𝜏) or strain (𝛾) controlled. Combining different
analytical methods, such as GPC, LC/MS, GC/MS, NMR, elemental analysis, etc., when required, is a common
approach for deciphering a coating’s composition. In addition, mechanical or physical tests on cured samples, such
as bending flexibility, toughness (energy dissipation), CDT, water absorption, etc., should always be conducted in
support of formulation modifications and enhancements due to the inability of thermal techniques such as DSC
and rheology DMA to directly predict such materials or system properties.

A Hydrogen Energy

A
Hydrogen Energy
Green, green economy, green energy, and green hydrogen (as an energy carrier) are common themes when it comes
to sustainability and energy freedom in contemporary life and society. In addition to nuclear fusion (refer to NOTE
given later) and biomass-based energy (refer to DOE Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center), zero-carbon and
renewable hydrogen energy are a crucial directions for the future independence of the energy market. In terms of
hydrogen energy produced by electrolysis (refer to Figure 4.7), 1.7 tons of water may generate 1.3 tons of hydrogen.
As described by Xie et al. [69], scientists have made headway in producing H2 directly from seawater using a
membrane-based electrolysis device (with side reactions that release Cl2; refer to Figure 4.10 and Figure 10.18 in
Chapter 10). According to projections made by www.viensolar.com at the beginning of 2023, global investments
in green hydrogen will amount to around USD 15 trillion by 2050, or USD 800 billion per year. NOTE: the United
States announced on December 13, 2022, that Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory’s (LLNL) Nuclear Ignition
Facility (NIF) has recently achieved fusion ignition, that is, fusion energy gain factor Q > 1, for the first time. This is
an important step toward green nuclear energy, considering that one liter of seawater containing hydrogen isotopes
(deuterium and tritium) could create energy equivalent to 300 liters of diesel.
Typically, low-cost renewable wind and solar (photovoltaic) energy is used to power zero-emission green hydro-
gen by electrolysis. Numerous nations, including the United States, China, Germany, South Africa, Saudi Arabia,
Singapore, Brazil, Sweden, the Netherlands, Kazakhstan, and Egypt, among others, are currently planning, initi-
ating, and implementing projects on hybrid green energy facilities consisting of wind, solar-PV, and hydrogen (via
electrolysis cells). For example, The Line City (170-kilometers-long and 0.2-kilometers-wide) proposed by Saudi
Arabia will be entirely powered by renewable energy; as of the end of 2022, South Africa is financing to invest
USD 250 billion for green hydrogen with a total capacity of 300 GW (installations of 10 GW wind and PV and
5 GW electrolysis by 2030); China is the world’s largest producer of renewable energy (wind, hydro, solar, hydro-
gen from coal gasification and electrolysis, and nuclear) to date, with 1.1 billion kilowatts, or 25.5% of the country’s
total energy consumption in 2021. The most recent costs (as of 2021–2022) are USD 2.00/kg for green hydrogen,
USD 10–13/kg for electrolysis, USD 2–6/kg for fossil fuels (natural gas), and USD 2–3/kg for gasification of coal,
USD 6–10/kg for gray hydrogen, and USD 6–7/kg for brown hydrogen from carbon capture and sequestration.
The price of green hydrogen is anticipated to decrease from USD 3.53 to USD 2.51/kg between 2020 and 2030 to
USD 1.38 between 2040 and 2050. Physically, hydrogen (compressed gas) pipe transportation is typically under a
pressure of 3,000 psi (206.8 bars or 204.1 atms); hydrogen refill stations require 790 atm pressure; hydrogen (gas
under no pressure) does not require any special equipment for generation, transport, and storage, nor does liq-
uid hydrogen at low temperature, with the exception of extreme heat insulation, which is also required for LNG
and ammonia. Wind onshore at USD 46/MWh, solar (utility) at USD 51, natural gas (combined cycle, or CC) at
USD 59, geothermal at USD 77, wind offshore at USD 100, coal at USD 112, nuclear at USD 164, and natural gas
(peak) at USD 175/MWh represent the cost of global electricity generated by different technologies. The price of
renewable electricity continues to decline.
Hydrogen is regarded as the most eco-friendly and ultimate energy resource, but it is not the only “green” one;
ammonia and methanol are “green” as well. Production of H2 by electrolysis of water (e.g., PEM is representative
of the mainstream fuel cell type) is a mature technique, but it is not the only one; production of H2 by magnesium
hydride (MgH2) hydrolysis [70, 71] (Figure 4.19a) and methanol electrolysis [72] (Figure 4.19b) is also desirable, as
MgH2 and methanol are high H2 storage media (7.6 and 12.5% by weight, respectively), releasing 15.2 and 37.5% H2
(water excluded) by weight, respectively. Particularly, MgH2 is considered one of the best materials for H2 storage in
solid form; it has been reported that MgH2 doped with VNbO5 exhibits remarkable hydrogen storage capacities at
275 ∘C (switch 0–20 bar) [73, 74]. Other material-based (non-physical) hydrogen storages include adsorbents (e.g.,
MOF-5), liquid organics (e.g., BN-methyl-cyclopentane), interstitial hydrides (e.g., LaNi5H6), complex hydrides
(e.g., NaAlH4), and chemical hydrogen (e.g., NH3BH3) [49].

Electrolysis mechanisms for producing hydrogen from (a) magnesium hydride (MgH2) and (b) methanol (where
optimal dehydration reactivity relies on the ratio of methanol to water, e.g., 3: 1).
Li et al. [75] provides an in-depth review of the in-situ production of hydrogen from methanol and their
metal-based catalysts. Decarbonization of fuel and polymer manufacture is notably developing new markets for
methanol from a macroeconomic and energy standpoint [76]. Carbon Recycling International produces 110,000
metric tons of methanol and captures 160,000 tons of CO2 annually at one of the world’s largest CO2-to-methanol
plants in Anyang, Henan Province, China [77]. As reported by BIS Research [78], the global market for green
methanol will grow from USD 122.35 million in 2021 to more than USD 3.15 billion by 2031, with the use of
methanol as a fuel for heavy-duty oceangoing vessels serving as a significant driver.

Cure Kinetics and Rheology
5.1
Cure Kinetics
The kinetics of curing is a mathematical description of time (t), temperature (T), and the degree of curing (𝛼).
Thermal characterization of epoxy coatings and adhesives by DSC (differential scanning calorimetry) is perhaps
the most essential and valuable technique when it comes to advanced formulations for both optimizations and
innovations via cure kinetics. The combination of DSC kinetics with dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) rheol-
ogy studies is more effective and powerful. Simply expressed, cure kinetics is concerned with the rate of curing
( ̇𝛼= d𝛼/dt), while rheology is concerned with stress deformation (𝜏and ̇𝛾). There are coatings scientists who rely
exclusively on traditional wisdoms of trial-and-error, but they would reach an even greater or highest level if they
were armed with applied skills in kinetics and rheology. This chapter is dedicated to these two aspects from a
practically sensible, operational, relevant, and quantitative standpoint. Please note that “cure” and “curing” may
be used interchangeably throughout this entire chapter.
Chemical structures and reactivities of epoxy resins and curing agents (refer to Chapters 1 and 2), the formu-
lation index to be applied (refer to Subsection 4.2 in Chapter 4), and subsequent crosslinking reactions (refer to
Chapter 3) determine the end performance commensurate with a specific formulation. In other words, their
structure-property relationships are the most important aspect of epoxy coatings. The path to the objective is
guided by kinetics and rheology. DSC reveals cure advancements or dynamics, whereas DMA describes contingent
rheological behaviors quantitatively and in great detail, aiding in the characterization of such curing events and
viscoelastic properties as the gel point or gelation, the cure onset, the minimum viscosity or maximum flow, the
maximum cure rate, vitrification, de-vitrification, cure endset, the maximum viscosity, the maximum modulus,
the glass transition temperature (Tg), and so on. Quantity is justice; quantitative kinetics enables formulators to
predict and, consequently, prescribe a curing schedule suited to a customer’s unique operational environment.
Curing is simply a process that converts viscous monomers or resins into elastic polymers with regard to bulk
modulus, which dictates the end properties of coatings.
Numerous works have been completed and published on reaction kinetics, such as a doctoral dissertation [1],
comprehensive reviews from the past [2, 3], testing methods [4], whitepaper types [5, 6], book chapters [7], etc.,
covering the model-free (i.e., iso-conversional), the heavily studied model based (i.e., model fitting), viable linear
regression, integral, and differential techniques for miscellaneous systems. Kinetic research can be conducted
without formulation expertise, but not necessarily vice versa. Due to the reaction complexity involved in, for
example, epoxy systems, there is no single model that fits all; therefore, the use of MFK (model-free kinetics) or any
other model-based method is well acceptable so long as the resulting data allow users to make reasonable expla-
nations and sensible predictions as guidance for real-world applications. In a sense, practically kinetic functions
and models are derived directly or indirectly from the Arrhenius rate equation k = A ⋅e
−Ea
RT , which defines generic
variables such as the activation energy (Ea) and temperature (T), which affect the reaction rate constant (k).

5 Cure Kinetics and Rheology
5.1.1
Gel time model
Gelation is an essential phenomenon and concept, and the gel time at a given temperature is a significant curing
and rheological event in thermosetting coatings and adhesives, such as 1/2K epoxy systems. Again, gelation is evi-
dent through rheology DMA as the crossing of shear G′ and G′′, but undetectable through DSC. Presumably, and
often, the gelation of a coating is associated with the degree of cure (𝛼) remaining constant regardless of tempera-
ture. In other words, 𝛼gel or the extent of conversion at gelation is constant, for a given formulation. However, gel
times are temperature dependent; the greater the temperature, the quicker the gelation occurs because the time
required to reach 𝛼gel at a higher temperature is shorter. The gel time model [8] is probably the simplest model of
kinetics due to the fact that gel times in seconds or minutes at specific temperatures (e.g., 350, 400, and 450 ∘F)
are easily measured with hot plates. Considering an autocatalytic dynamic (i.e., non-isothermal) cure of an epoxy
coating, the cure rate may be expressed as ̇𝛼= k(T) • g(𝛼) [9], and by substituting the Arrhenius equation for the
temperature-dependent rate constant k(T), we obtain:
Equation 1:
d𝛼
dt = k(T) ⋅g(𝛼) = A ⋅e
−Ea
RT ⋅f(𝛼)
where ̇𝛼= d𝛼
dt is the cure reaction rate, A is the pre-exponential factor, g(𝛼) and f(𝛼) are generic forms of an appro-
priate reaction model (g(𝛼) may have a different form depending on the cure mechanisms involved), Ea is the
activation energy in J/mol (not J/g for enthalpy), and R is the universal gas constant (= 8.314 J/mol- ∘K).
Rearranging Equation 1 produces:
Equation 1a:
d𝛼
f(𝛼) = A ⋅e
−Ea
RT ⋅dt
and integrating Equation 1a from time zero to tgel (sec) results in:
Equation 2:
tgel =
1
A ∗exp
(
−Ea

) ⋅∫
𝛼gel

Then using natural logarithms on Equation 2, we obtain:
Equation 3:
ln(tgel) = Ea
R ⋅1
T + ln
[

𝛼gel

f(𝛼)d𝛼
]
In Equation 3, tgel and T represent, respectively, the gel time in seconds at a specific temperature T and the
absolute temperature in ∘K. As aforementioned, the second term on the right side of Equation 3 is constant as
C since 𝛼gel and f(𝛼) remain unchanged by temperature at gelation. Therefore, plotting ln(tgel) versus 1
T yields a
linear line with Ea derived from the slope and C calculated correspondingly. For example, the typical gel times at
350 ∘F (i.e., 176 ∘C) and 400 ∘F (i.e., 204 ∘C) for an epoxy powder coating (formulated with a Type 7 resin, ADH
as the crosslinker, and 2MI as the catalyst; refer to Table 5.10) were 12.8 and 5.7 sec, respectively, and a set of two
equations was derived using Equation 3:
Equation 3a:
ln(12.8) = C +
Ea

and
Equation 3b:
ln(5.7) = C +

+ 273.15
Solving Equations 3a/b jointly yields the kinetic parameters apparent Ea = 52,016.9 J/mol and C = −11.36,
which are characteristic of this coating and may be used to compare with other coatings and to predict cure times
required to reach full cure at a given cure temperature. Nevertheless, users should be careful not to over-explain

things beyond Ea (i.e., the threshold energy needed to activate a cure). Taking three or additional data points
(e.g., one addition of the gel time at 450 ∘F) as opposed to the two data points demonstrated in this embodiment
produces greatly improved C and Ea values via a linear regression of ln(tgel) versus 1/T (in 1/ ∘K).
5.1.2
Tg model
Also devoid of a rate function g(𝛼) like the gel time model where g(𝛼) is considered as a constant, the Tg model
is proposed and refined on the assumption that Tg is a function of 𝛼ranging from Tg0 when uncured (i.e., 𝛼= 0)
to Tg∞when completely cured (i.e., 𝛼= 1) [10, 11]. The expression for an extended DiBenedetto equation is as
follows:
Equation 4:
Tg =
(1 −𝛼) ⋅Tg0 + 𝜆𝛼Tg∞
(1 −𝛼) + 𝜆𝛼
where 𝜆= Fx/Fm is the ratio of segmental mobilities, which is an adjustable and structure-dependent parameter
with an originally proposed value between zero (uncured) and one (fully cured).
In fact, Tg0 and Tg∞are readily determined using DSC for both liquid and fusion bonded epoxy (FBE) powder
coatings (refer to Chapter 4), with the exception that the value of Tg0 for liquid coatings is user-defined. As a result,
it is straightforward to establish a Tg-conversion (𝛼) curve for predicting the extents of cure (i.e., 𝛼’s) as per actual
Tgs, and vice versa, when the arbitrary 𝜆and experimental Tg0 and Tg∞are known. Using Figure 4.13 (Chapter 4)
as an example, Tg-𝛼curves are constructed according to Equation 4, as shown in Figure 5.1, where Tg1 and Tg4
correspond to Tg0 and Tg∞at 71.69 and 104.27 ∘C, respectively, assuming 𝜆= 0.50, 1.00, and 1.20 in the interim.
The obvious limitation or disadvantage of Equation 4 is that 𝜆as a variable is grossly underestimated by this
model, which is inapplicable for at least epoxy systems since Figure 5.1 exhibits that 𝛼develops at a constant rate,
which is largely inconsistent with actual situations. Specifically, epoxy coatings typically cure fast and build up Tg
quickly upon initiation, then both slow down throughout the late and later stages of cure; hence, a reasonable 𝜆
value should be revised and placed between 1.20 and 1.50 to more accurately reflect the actual cure behaviors.
5.1.3
Model-free kinetics
In a sense, MFK (model-free kinetics) and advanced MFK are centered around the approximation of the unknown
activation energy (Ea) in terms of conversion (𝛼). Subsequently, an 𝛼(conversion)-t (time)/-T (temperature) profile

is generated for predicting not only isothermal cure cycles, or the cure time required at a specific cure temperature
(e.g., a custom setting in the field or at a customer) to reach a certain conversion level or full cure (𝛼≈1) for, for
example, a particular epoxy coating, but also a dynamic cure profile (e.g., at a given heating rate 𝛽), as needed.
MFK is fundamentally based on Equation 1 or Equation 1b as well as the iso-conversion concept as employed
in the gel time model. In other words, MFK assumes that i) Ea in Equations 1b and 5 (i.e., executing a logarithm
transformation) is not constant but varies as curing reactions progress, and ii) Ea at a specific conversion (𝛼) level
remains independent of temperature profiles, namely, iso-conversion. In other words, the second term on the right
side of Equation 5 is taken as a constant; thus, Ea is readily determined from the slope of −Ea
R by linear regression
of ln(d𝛼/dt) versus 1/T, where 𝛼and ̇𝛼(= d𝛼/dt) are obtained from DSC exothermic data.
Equation 1b:
k ⋅g(𝛼) = 𝛽⋅d𝛼
dT = d𝛼
dt = A ⋅exp
(

Using Friedman’s method to solve Equation 1 [12], we obtain:
Equation 5:

RT + ln(A ⋅g(𝛼))
Experimentally, MFK algorithms deal with DSC exothermic curves under a minimum of three runs each at
a constant heating rate (𝛽= dT/dt, such as 2, 4, 8, and 12 ∘C/min). The following example demonstrates actual
step-by-step operations regarding how to implement MFK; it is important to understand the mathematics behind
MFK even though TRIOS offers programmed procedure to perform full MFK analysis rather than tedious and
time-consuming Excel spreadsheet calculations.
First, four DSC tests are performed on an FBE coating (labeled FBE-V1) at heating rates of 4, 8, 12, and 20 ∘C/min,
respectively; each exothermic curve is then individually integrated for the area under the curve to produce the total
enthalpy (𝛥H) or the heat of reaction, as seen in Figure 5.2a. 𝛥H’s are relatively constant yet with slight variations,
that is, between −46.12 and −49.66 J/g, as the total heat of reaction is only associated with formulation-driven
crosslinking processes and is heating rate (𝛽)-independent. Please note that each of the base line selections (the
beginning and ending of each curve) is important and, at times, quite challenging, as it affects approximations
resulting from not just one but multiple curves. In the instance of FBE-V1, the four baselines (i.e., the black
lines underneath the curves) appear to be robust as they are all nearly horizontal. Next, each of these four initial
exothermic curves is divided into segments of equal temperature space spanning their respective baselines; the
finer the space between segments, the more accurate the results of 𝛼and ̇𝛼. This step’s operations closely resem-
ble Kissinger’s plot and Borchardt–Daniels’ approach, which will be examined in the following sections under
the nth-order model. Third, these conversion (𝛼) data are merged and converted into activation energy (Ea) data
as correlated by Equation 5, producing an Ea-𝛼curve for FBE-V1 as shown in Figure 5.2b. Last, the activation
energy curve and the iso-𝛼assumption are then used to generate dynamic or isothermal cure profiles, as exhibited
in Figures 5.2c/d for FBE-V1, respectively.
It is a crucial step to develop the iso-conversion (𝛼) curves with 𝛼between zero and 100% so that an iso-𝛼curve
can be generated for any specific 𝛼of interest for this coating. For a dynamic (heat ramping) cure (Figure 5.2c)
based on MFK, FBE-V1 is expected to reach 164.4 ∘C (from 80 ∘C) in 3.52 min, achieving 50% cure, and 202.1 ∘C
in 5.42 min, achieving complete cure; the cure reaction rate ̇𝛼reaches a maximum at 172.3 ∘C and 𝛼= 63.9% cure
level before rapidly decelerating. For an isothermal cure (Figure 5.2d) based on MFK, FBE-V1 cures in 1.16 min at
200 ∘C, 3.31 min at 180 ∘C, and 10.36 min at 160 ∘C, assuming a minimum cure level of at least 99%. In addition,
a desired cure schedule can be specified based on a desired cure level (e.g., 𝛼= 90, 95, 99%, or something) for
a certain processing setting at a particular customer. As established, certain European applicators have already
adopted MFK for process control in the oil and gas pipeline coating sector.

In addition to the Arrhenius rate k(T) portion, the nth-order model incorporates the reaction order of n relevant to
the conversion of 𝛼term, that is, g(𝛼) = (1 −𝛼)n, into the kinetics. In other words, k(T) and g(𝛼) become dependent
variables, as opposed to g(𝛼) being viewed as a constant. Therefore, three independent parameters, namely, A—the
pre-exponential factor, Ea—the nominal activation energy, and n—the nth (n ≠1) reaction order, must be deter-
mined in order to solve the corresponding cure kinetic model equation of d𝛼/dt or ̇𝛼, as consolidated in Table 5.1’s
Equation 6. When n equals one, the nth-order kinetic model is simplified to ̇𝛼= d𝛼
dt = k(T) ∗(1 −𝛼), which can
be solved analytically or experimentally in a manner comparable to solving any of the nth-order equations. As it
turns out, there exist applied epoxy coating formulations with a first reaction order, that is, n = 1, which will be
disclosed in Debrief D of Chapter 6.

The nth-order model has a differential form of Equation 6 that may end up having a variety of integral for-
mats, such as Equations 7, 8, 9, and 10, as analytical solutions, as listed in Table 5.1, depending upon which
specific terms are of primarily concern and the associated assumptions and boundary conditions for each. The
nth order models are categorized as non-isothermal because they all rely on dynamic DSC ramping (𝛽) runs to
derive the values of key kinetic parameters, that is, A, Ea, and n. In this section, Kissinger’s plot [13], the BD
(Borchardt−Daniels) approach [14], and the Ozawa-Flynn-Wall method [15, 16], among others, will be quantita-
tively applied and compared utilizing applicable epoxy formulations. Linear regressions are heavily employed for
solving the nth order models in their integral forms. Particularly, the BD approach entails multiple linear regres-
sions, whereas the Ozawa-Flynn-Wall method requires iterative corrections to achieve accuracy, as specified in
ASTM E698 for DSC exothermic data and ASTM E1641 for TGA measurements.
5.1.4.1
The Kissinger plot
The Kissinger plot is theorized to concurrently determine Ea and A, but not the reaction order n, as the maximum
reaction rate d𝛼max/dt of a non-isothermal cure at an underlying heating rate 𝛽(= dT/dt) takes place at Tpeak. The
Tpeak is identified and is the same as the peak temperature of a DSC exothermic curve ramped at 𝛽( ∘K/min). That
is, the derivative of d𝛼max/dt is zero, or d2𝛼max/dt2 equals zero. Equation 7 is obtained by considering a first-order
reaction of Equation 6 with n = 1, differentiating the equation, and then setting it to zero. The intended result of
plotting ln

Tpeak is a straight line with slope = −Ea

(

, from which Ea and A
(or lnA) can be determined. Kissinger’s technique is deemed a remarkable approximation for nth-order reactions
[17], and it is effective for first-order processes [18]. Nonetheless, the Kissinger plot is only valid under certain
conditions, one of which is the assumption that the other reaction order m equaling zero disregards catalytic
intermediates [19]. Taking the natural log on both sides of Equation 6 yields Equation 8, also known as the
Friedman differential method [20], which represents a straight line in the form of Y = b + a X, where Y = ln
(
d𝛼

)
and X = ln(1 −𝛼). Kissinger’s strategy is fundamentally an expanded Friedman approach. In the meantime, the
degree of cure (𝛼) is proportional to the reaction heat [21], therefore, multiple isothermal DSC tests can determine
𝛼= ΔHtotal−ΔHresidue
ΔHtotal
for a particular formulation at any given temperature. When ln
(
d𝛼
dt
)
is plotted against ln(1 −𝛼),
a linear regression curve with slope = n, the reaction order, is obtained. Thus, the consolidated method determines

5 Cure Kinetics and Rheology
reactivity 𝛥HR’s are used to calculate the cured fractions of 𝛼’s for the five individual isothermal tests at 325 ∘F;
subsequently, a linear regression of ln(𝛥𝛼/𝛥t) versus ln(1-𝛼) is established, as shown in Figure 5.4b, with a slope
of 1.308 that approximates the reaction order n. The reaction order n’s at other isothermal temperatures of 300,
350, 375, and 400 ∘F were similarly estimated to be 1.05 (R2 = 0.99), 1.43 (R2 = 0.97), 1.86 (R2 = 0.87), and 1.50
(R2 = 0.43), respectively. Evidently, the reaction order n for FBE-V1 increases with the isothermal curing temper-
atures utilized; the greater the curing temperature, the weaker the correlation. In part, this is due to the fact that
isothermal conditions are rarely attainable in the real world, including in the built-in DSC oven.
Both regression plots in Figure 5.4 demonstrate an excellent linear correlation between the dependent
and independent variables. Consequently, the complete nth-order kinetic equation for FBE-V1 is determined
as d𝛼

T
⋅(1 −𝛼)1.308. Figure 5.4b’s intercept of −3.5897 corresponds to lnA−Ea/RT according to
Equation 8a. Substituting lnA = 14.348 and Ea = 69,140.9 J/mol along with T = 435.93 ∘K and R = 8.314 J/mol- ∘K
yields lnA−Ea/RT = −4.7, which is off but not unacceptably so (compared to intercept = −3.5897), given that
these are literally exponential factors.
Real isothermal conditions are difficult to achieve in the laboratory or in the field. It turned out that the FBE-V1
coating was already 17.5% cured within the 49 sec it took to heat up from 20 ∘C to an isothermal temperature of
325 ∘F. Such premature curing was even worse when an isothermal program was executed, as the initial temper-
ature of 325 ∘F was reached prior to sample loading. As a direct result of such a pseudo-isothermal process, the
reaction order n, calculated to be 1.308, is overestimated; in other words, the actual value of n should be lower.
In addition, the baseline selection for isothermal peak integration is significant since it can significantly affect the
values of 𝛥H’s, leading to an even more biased n value.
5.1.4.2
Borchardt−Daniels (BD) approach
The BD approach, which requires only a single dynamic DSC scan to generate quantitative data on Ea, n, and
A, is based upon the following assumptions: uniform temperature throughout, heat transfer only via conduction
(strictly applicable only to stirred liquids), absence of overlapping peaks, and Arrhenius dependency. In order to
determine the nth-order kinetic parameters using the BD method, an underlying DSC exothermic curve must
be divided into fine segments equally spaced by temperature or time, similar to the first step in MFK. The heat
of reaction 𝛥H (J/g = W⋅sec/g) is calculated by multiplying heat flow in W/g by time in seconds. To implement
the BD method on raw DSC exothermic data dynamically run at a constant heating rate (e.g., 𝛽= 4.0 ∘C/min),
the following steps are taken: initially, users establish the baseline using TRIOS and then determine its slope and
intercept in an Excel spreadsheet after data transfer (Figure 5.5a); next, users calculate the area of each segment as
𝛥Hi in terms of J/g (the time interval was 0.102 sec in this case of 𝛽= 4.0 ∘C/min), based on which the accumulative
fraction of cure 𝛼’s are generated. Third, users compute ln(d𝛼/dt) and ln(1-𝛼) for 𝛼’s within the range of 𝛼= 0.10 to
0.90, while simultaneously populating the corresponding values of ln[k(T)] = ln
(
d𝛼

)
−n•ln(1 −α)’s by assuming
n = 0.50, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 per Equation 8a, respectively. Finally, users plot ln(k(T))’s versus 1/T to identify the
optimal linear regression according to Equation 8b, as shown in Figure 5.5b, from which n, Ea, and In(A) or A
are all determined.
Multiple linear regressions yield n = 1.00 (R2 = 0.9999) as the best approximation for the FBE-V1 coating
formulation (Figure 5.5b), and as a result, the correlated Ea and lnA are determined to be 73,515.7 J/mol and
15.69, respectively. Again, and please take note, the baseline selection in Figure 5.5a affects the results. Simi-
lar processes are applied to other DSC exothermic curves run at 2, 8, 12, and 20 ∘C/min, respectively, and the
consistent results are given in Table 5.2. The complete nth-order kinetic equation for FBE-V1 is defined as d𝛼

⋅(1 −𝛼)1.01 by taking averages. Notably, the BD technique tends to produce relatively high Ea and lnA
values while recurrently generating n values close to 1.00, that is, a first-order reaction. In addition, it appears that
the value of n via the BD pathway gradually decreases as the applied heating rate is increased. According to Sun
[1], the BD method is more appropriate for describing simple curing processes involving a single cure reaction,

such as stirred liquid systems with a uniform bulk temperature. The BD approach’s robustness will be evaluated
by comparing it to other models in Subsection 5.1.6.
Regarding the Ozawa plot and the extended Ozawa-Flynn-Wall method, that is, Equations 9 and 10 listed in
Table 5.1, the techniques, including the mathematical algorithms and linear regression operations, are detailed and
illustrated in the industrial test standard ASTM E698. Within the scope of the nth-order kinetic models (including
n = 1, i.e., first-order reactions), the Kissinger plot is superior to the BD approach not just in terms of indepen-
dent accuracy but also in terms of the ease of performing linear regression operations. In comparison, the MFK
technique requires the most computations or calculations, followed by the BD method.
5.1.5
Autocatalytic model
The autocatalytic (i.e., sigmoidal) model is re-expressed from the general nth-order equation by adding 𝛼m and
(1-𝛼)n terms to the rate-controlled function of g(𝛼). Consequently, the autocatalytic model equations take the form
of Equation 11 in Table 5.3, commonly known as the PT (Prout–Tompkins) or SB (Sesták–Berggren) (m, n) model
[22, 23], where m and n (often non-integers) are the exponents or reaction orders. 𝛼m is claimed to be a catalytic
effect term in the review [24]; the term 𝛼m coupled with (1-𝛼)n constituting g(𝛼) describes the total autocatalytic
reactions involved. The curing of epoxy coatings is characteristic of autocatalytic reactions in which intermedi-
ates (such as tertiary amines) function as additional catalysts. The two-parameter (m and n) model preserves its

physical significance only when m ≤1 [25], according to Equation 11, which applies to a dynamic curing process.
Instead, Equation 12 in Table 5.3 is the autocatalytic model provided for an isothermal reaction [26], wherein the
initial rate constant k1 is not necessarily zero, although it is for a dynamic cure. When diffusion is taken into
account, the diffusion factor f(𝛼) [27] is substituted into Equation 12 to yield Equation 13.
In contrast to the nth-order models, neither Equation 11 nor Equation 12 has analytical solutions; hence,
numerical methods such as nonlinear multivariate regressions [1, 28] can be employed to determinate the four
kinetic parameters lnA (or A), Ea, m, and n according to Equations 11/12a. Technically, the BD approach is also
applicable to the autocatalytic cure kinetics [1]; however, its application to the SB (m, n) model generates a large
number of calculations (similar to MFK’s) due to the wide variety of m and n combinations that must be tested.
Parameter determination makes more sense when applying mathematical techniques and tools such as MATLAB
for model fitting. Recently, researchers have created software capable of solving Equation 11 by simulating either
conventional DSC or MTDSC curves. DCS (DSC Curve Solutions) of Cao Technology (www.caotechnology.com
.au), which is supported by numerical and experimental methods, is an excellent example of such efforts. In theory
and practice, a DSC exothermic curve obtained by heating at a constant rate 𝛽for a reactive polymer coating, such
as epoxy coatings, including FBEs, represents an energy change profile adhering to its inherent kinetics from zero
to full cure. All associated parameters, including lnA (or A), Ea, m, and n, are intrinsically confounded inside
the exothermic curve; thus, they are retrievable by the application of the proper transformations or simulations.
This quantitative concept is implemented precisely by DCS. Once all parameters are determined, an autocatalytic
equation according to Equations 11 and 12 is complete, enabling the accurate description and prediction of curing
behaviors under any time span or temperature profile. For nearly all 1K coatings of latency at room temperature
and most 2K coatings just prior to mixing, it is reasonable to assume k1 = 0 in Equation 12 to reduce the form
back to Equation 11 (i.e., consisting of four parameters to work out simultaneously by applying DCS on a single
DSC test) because the initial crosslinking is close to zero. This applies to the FBE-V1 coating used as an example in
this section about the application of DCS and subsequent sections about application of cure kinetics to processing
and formulation. As it turns out, almost all epoxy and non-epoxy systems as discussed throughout the following
chapters, regardless of formulation variations (e.g., resins, crosslinkers, and catalysts), tend to behave according to
an autocatalytic cure profile rather than an nth-order one (i.e., m = 0 in Equation 11), which, however, does occur
on occasion. DCS is straightforward to implement on a single DSC exothermic curve run at a specific heating rate,
as outlined here.

First, export data as plain text into Notepad or as an Excel file and organize them; then import or open the data
file in the DCS application. Third, input due settings properly for sample (actual sample mass enters “1” if heat
flow data are already normalized) and DSC experimental conditions, such as “glass transition” with zero initial
crosslinking and “curing” with 𝛥H, the reference or default heat capacity value (machine specific and should be
determined in advance), and the heating rate(s), as shown in Figure 5.6a. Fourth, input the best guesses on k20
(i.e., lnA or A), Ea2, m, and n according to Equation 11 while assuming k10 = 0 as previously described. Last,
repeat Step 4 until the hypothesized curve (in red) corresponds as closely as possible to the actual DSC exothermic
curve (in black) in a separate window, as shown in Figure 5.6b.

5 Cure Kinetics and Rheology
Following the DCS curve fitting protocol described earlier, the approximate kinetic parameters for FBE-V1
per Equation 11 using the DSC exothermic curve run at 4.0 ∘C/min from 20 to 215 ∘C and 𝛥H = −43.9 J/g are:
A = 15,200, Ea = 51,600 J/mol, m = 0.40, and n = 1.13. The complete ordinary differential equation (ODE) con-
sistent with the SB (m, n) cure model for FBE-V1 is therefore: d𝛼
dt = 15200 ⋅e
−6206.4
T
⋅𝛼0.40 ⋅(1 −𝛼)1.13. Instanta-
neous factions of cure (𝛼’s) are obtained under the same dynamic heat ramping, from which the immediate cure
rates ( ̇𝛼i) at Ti ( ∘C) or ti (sec) are derived from 𝛥𝛼/𝛥t (= 𝛼i−𝛼i−1
ti−ti−1 ), as is the specific temperature range in which
the maximum cure rate ( ̇𝛼max) takes place by plotting ̇𝛼versus 𝛼. Regarding isothermal curing, the desired cur-
ing temperature (e.g., 204 ∘C) is substituted as a constant into the completed ODE, resulting in a function of
d𝛼
dt = f(𝛼) = 0.034109 ⋅𝛼0.40 ⋅(1 −𝛼)1.13 that is easily solved with respect to the cure time to any particular level of
𝛼. Please note, i) the DSC curve fitting approach is completely based on experimental data and makes no assump-
tions, whereas other models do, ii) the heating rates do more or less affect the curve fitting results, iii) the reference
heat capacity is 0.047 J/ ∘K as determined for the DSC machine used, and the same instrument is used for gener-
ating all experimental DSC data in this book unless otherwise specified, and iv) the default heating rate for DSC
kinetics and rheology DMA throughout this book is 7.0 ∘C/min unless otherwise specified. The objective is always
to offer scientifically sound facts and consistent competitive analyses.
5.1.6
Comparisons of model-based kinetics
As recouped in Table 5.4, three ODEs have been obtained for FBE-V1 using three separate techniques: Kissinger’s
plot paired with isothermal according to Equation 7, the BD approach according to Equations 8a/b, and DCS
according to the SB (m, n) model or Equation 11. Notably, model curve fitting does not make any assumptions,
but the other two methods do. In addition, the BD approach and DCS only require a single DSC exothermic curve
to generate all parameter data, but Kissinger’s plot requires multiple exotherms. The finalized ODEs are all fully
solvable using mathematical software such as MATLAB or the like by properly setting the initial values and the
time span, including the desired delta increment of differentiations, as exhibited in Figure 5.7, where VisualLab,
a free-subscribed MATLAB offset, is employed as a demonstration, in that the initial value of x(0) = 1 × e−6 is an
important but adjustable setting. Variations may happen when modifying these boundaries, as may be observed
for t0.99’s at 325 and 450 ∘F reported for the SB (m, n) model in Table 5.4 and Figure 5.8c (i.e., 12.3 versus 14.8 min

and 106.0 sec versus 2.2 min, respectively); however, overall trends or patterns remain consistent. To clarify, t0.99
denotes the cure time required to reach an 𝛼= 99% cure level at a specific curing temperature, etc. Please note
that VisualLab is retained in this book for generating numerical solutions to all ODEs throughout the following
chapters unless otherwise specified.
Accordingly, by differentiating the three respective ODEs in Table 5.4 by substituting any intended tempera-
tures (e.g., 325, 350, 375, 400, 425, and 450 ∘F), iso-conversional cure times and cure curves (i.e., the cure times
versus the cure temperatures) can be readily obtained for any level of cure (i.e., 𝛼), as selectively populated in
Table 5.4 and plotted in Figure 5.8. Consequently, these cure time predictions allow comparisons of models as
well as competitive analysis of applied formulations. In head-to-head comparisons in Figure 5.8a, the nth-order
equations out of Kissinger’s+Iso (i.e., Kissinger’s plot paired with isothermal) and the BD approach tend to severely
underestimate cure times, especially at a low conversion stage of, for instance, 50%, across the temperature range
of 325–450 ∘F. Kissinger’s+Iso appears to shift cure time estimates closer to those of the SB (m, n) model as 𝛼
approaches and exceeds 90% (Figures 5.8b/c/d and Table 5.4). Specifically, cure times at low-cure temperatures,
according to Kissinger’s+Iso, converge to those of the fitted SB (m, n) equation as 𝛼approaches 90% (Figure 5.8b),
while those at high cure temperatures converge when 𝛼is less than 99% (Figures 5.8c/d). Figures 5.8c/d and
Table 5.4 demonstrate that the BD method tends to substantially underestimate (or remarkably shorten) cure
times at high conversion stages of 90% and above across the 325–450 ∘F temperature range. This exhibits that the
nth order of Kissinger’s+Iso method is preferable than the BD approach when used to explain results or make
predictions; however, caution must be exercised with respect to temperature ranges.
The nth-order kinetics derived using the BD approach is too aggressive to be valid, for instance, for FBEs. In
addition, for fast cure or highly reactive epoxy coatings such as rebar and OD pipe FBE powder coatings that are
typically cured at 450 ∘F or higher, it is not easy to acquire the reaction order n to complete the nth-order ODEs
if using the Kissinger’s+Iso method because cure reactions occur or even finish during the time of temperature
ramping. A further shortcoming or inadequacy of nth-order models, and perhaps one of the reasons why nth-order
kinetic equations are inadequate, is that the ignored 𝛼m component is correlated essentially to the DSC exothermic
curve region preceding Tpeak (to be discussed next). Therefore, it follows that the SB (m, n) autocatalytic model is
the most efficient and facile option, and it is applied to all kinetic data in subsequent chapters unless otherwise
specified.
Debrief A Thermal and kinetic parameters and their correlations
The cure kinetics (Equation 11) based on the autocatalytic SB (m, n) model comprises four parameters: the
pre-exponential factor A, the activation energy Ea, and the dual reaction orders m and n. From a DSC exother-
mic perspective, characteristic variables include, among others, enthalpy 𝛥H, which is indicative of reactivity or
the heat of cure reactions, Tg, which indicates a shift in heat capacity (Cp = ΔQ
ΔT , J/ ∘K), and Tpeak, which divides
the exothermic curve into ascending and descending sections, respectively. Ea and 𝛥H are two intrinsic elements
in chemical reactions. As depicted in Figure 5.9a, Ea represents the energy threshold for a thermosetting polymer
system (e.g., an epoxy coating) to initiate cure reactions; 𝛥H is the total heat released (exo-) or absorbed (endo-)
from crosslinking with respect to the initial energy status, that is, excluding any energy initially absorbed due to
the Ea threshold.
Catalyzed coatings have lower Ea’s due to the presence of more activated complexes as intermediates, but their
overall 𝛥H remains intact; the more catalysts incorporated, the lower the Ea until saturation is reached, after which
additional accelerators no longer drive Ea reduction. Ea and 𝛥H remain independent of the external heating rate
(𝛽); however, a quicker heating rate allows the energy ceiling (Ea) to be achieved and the sum of cure heat (𝛥H)
to be released earlier than a slower 𝛽does. An isothermal curing process has no effect on Ea or 𝛥H. Isothermal
denotes a constant internal energy, that is, 𝛥U = 0, as opposed to an adiabatic process with zero heat transfer, that
is, 𝛥Q = 0. Typically, extrusion is a staged, or zoned, isothermal process.

Without restriction to theory, including Equation 11, the pre-exponential factor A and activation energy Ea are
numerically correlated; this is acknowledged in the literature [29]. Following the simple and valid mathematical
transformations expressed in Table 5.5, k(T) does not change its exact value at a given temperature as long as
the term of (RT*lnA−Ea)/RT remains constant; in other words, when lnA increases or decreases to lnA’, there
is always an Ea’ at the same temperature increasing or decreasing accordingly to readily maintain the value
of (RT*lnA’−Ea’)/RT unchanged, as illustrated in the worksheet using the BD approach yielded parameters for
FBE-V1, where A and Ea are 16.41 and 75,950 J/mol, respectively (refer to Table 5.4). Obviously, A’ = 25,000 cou-
pled with Ea’ = 49,550∼53,900 J/mol (with temperature-dependent variations) is equivalent in terms of algebraic
values to the original A = 16.41 coupled with Ea = 75,950 J/mol. As a result, when DCS is used to acquire kinetic
parameters according to Equation 11, Ea should be treated as nominal or apparent, and it is likely to be substan-
tially less than the absolute Ea because A can be set at a number of the user’s choosing, such as 25,000 in Table 5.5,
and the resulting Ea is inherently associated with it. Nonetheless, both the nominal or apparent Ea and the com-
plete ODE attained remain effective to describe due cure behaviors and make reasonable predictions as long as
DCS curve fitting is performed in a consistent manner, such as by using the same machine settings, the same

heating rate (e.g., 7.0 ∘C/min), and the same A as chosen. Unless otherwise specified, A = 25,000 is always used in
subsequent chapters to calculate Ea based on the autocatalytic SB (m, n) model and the DCS method described in
the previous section.
As previously noted, a DSC heat flow curve’s exothermic profile is primarily determined by the cure kinetics of a
coating under testing conditions (dynamic or isothermal). As depicted in Figure 5.9b, when exothermic curves are
performed at the same dynamic heating rate (e.g., 7.0 ∘C/min) for formulations with identical cure chemistry (e.g.,
resins and hardeners), the positions and shapes of the curves reveal characteristic thermal and kinetic parame-
ters, Note that the same rule applies when utilizing multiple heating rates on the same coating, as exhibited in
Figure 5.3a and Table 5.5, where Ea appears to be essentially temperature dependent to some degree. Specifically,
the horizontal position of Tpeak is strictly correlated with the respective Ea’s, but the vertical position of Tpeak is
substantially defined by heat capacity (Cp) and 𝛥H. The values of apparent Ea vary with the position of Tpeak;
namely, Ea is high when Tpeak is high with respect to the x-axis and low when Tpeak is low.
Thermal and kinetic data via DSC curve fitting are presented in Table 5.6 for these three epoxy coatings depicted
in Figure 5.9b, where the only variance in composition is the catalyst employed in each formula while all are
at an identical level of 4.5 phr (total of epoxy and hardener resins). As shown in Figure 5.10a, and consistent
with historical and statistical data, Ea and Tpeak are positively correlated; additionally, ̇𝛼max for each of these three
formulations takes place very close to and just before Tpeak (i.e., the temperature at ̇𝛼max of 133.0∼134.3 ∘C versus its
Tpeak at 135.67 ∘C for Formula 1, 143.1∼143.8 ∘C versus 145.3 ∘C for Formula 2, and 182.6∼182.9 ∘C versus 184.2 ∘C
for Formula 3, respectively). This substantially verifies the Kissinger plot’s assumption that the maximum cure rate
( ̇𝛼max) occurs at Tpeak. Completed ODEs allow users to obtain instant 𝛼values at any temperature, including Tpeak
and Tonset, subject to the same dynamic ramping, such as 7.0 ∘C/min, as applied. In addition, by substituting a
specific temperature (e.g., 438 ∘F as selected at random) into each of the ODEs and solving it in terms of 𝛼with
VisualLab, cure behaviors are predicted with respect to, such as ̇𝛼max, 𝛼at ̇𝛼max, and t0.999 (time required to reach
full cure), in addition to cure curves as needed or of interest. The following steps determine the values of ̇𝛼max and

′s to be calculated and plotted
in a worksheet to obtain ̇𝛼max and 𝛼at ̇𝛼max accordingly; for an isothermal cure, the iso-temperature (e.g., 438 ∘F
or 498.7 ∘K as an example shown in Table 5.6) is substituted into the intended ODE which is subsequently solved
with regard to 𝛼’s (assumed and uniformly fragmented from 0 to 1) to obtain ̇𝛼max and 𝛼at ̇𝛼max, or alternatively
by employing d2𝛼
dt2 ≈0, as exhibited in Figure 5.10b. Specifically, the indices of ̇𝛼max are 0.066 1/s (the highest) at
𝛼= 0.44 for the imidazole adduct formula, 0.061 1/s at 𝛼= 0.58 for the 2MZA formula, and 0.026 1/s (the lowest)
at 𝛼= 0.57 for the 2PHZ formula, respectively; ̇𝛼max does not necessarily happen at the halfway point of curing or
𝛼= 0.50. Thermal and kinetic data, particularly gel times, Ea, Tonset, and t0.999, strongly indicate that the imidazole
adduct is the most effective of the three catalysts at the given loading level and also has the lowest latency, followed
by 2MZA. However, 2PHZ is seen to have a narrower cure window and a uniquely higher latency; its curing does
not begin until the temperature exceeds 140 ∘C. In other words, formulations desiring a high level of dormancy
yet a rapid acceleration of cure upon activation at temperatures over 180 ∘C could benefit from this characteristic.
However, low Ea alone does not necessarily equate to a fast cure, nor is Ea associated with Tonset cure; overall cure
behaviors are determined by the total cure kinetics or the contingent ODE as a whole.
Moreover, the reaction orders m and n in the SB (m, n) kinetic model characterize the shape and pattern of DSC
exothermic curves [29]. The greater the value of m, the steeper the segment of the curve before Tpeak, and vice versa;
the lower the value of n, the sharper the slope of the sectional curve following Tpeak, and vice versa. Combining
smaller m and n values results in a faster gel and cure, which is desirable for flash-cure formulations. Theoretically
and practically, the smaller the total reaction order value of m plus n (generally between 1 and 2) or the closer to one
the sum, the faster the overall cure rate and thus the shorter the cure time at a given cure temperature, particularly
when the value of Ea is concurrently low, that is, Tpeak is located at a lower temperature. Comparatively, Formula
1 (i.e., the imidazole adduct seen in Figure 5.9b and Table 5.6) conforms to these descriptors. Still, specifically, the
values of m and n are typically between 0 and 1.0 and between 0.5 and 2.0 for most epoxy coatings, respectively.
It seems logical that cure reactions initiate and accelerate until the ̇𝛼max reaches around Tpeak (Phase 1), and then
begin to decelerate after Tpeak until cure completes (Phase 2). During Phase 1, resin and crosslinker molecules
are infinitely abundant, leading to a fast first-order reaction or less for m; during Phase 2, reactant concentrations
are diluted as curing proceeds, and diffusion, vitrification, etc. may get involved in slow curing, resulting in a
slow reaction order greater than 1.0 for n. Still specifically, an n value greater than 2.0 is indicative of a long tail
at the end of the DSC curve, usually suggesting high-Tg formulations that require an extended cure time and/or

152
5 Cure Kinetics and Rheology
a higher temperature to fulfill sufficient cure. Furthermore, for low conversion (small 𝛼’s) stages, the cure rate
( ̇𝛼) is governed primarily by 𝛼m regardless of the magnitude of n, as (1-𝛼)n approaches one; likewise, as cure
advances (i.e., 𝛼approaches one), ̇𝛼becomes increasingly dependent on (1-𝛼)n regardless of the value of m, as
𝛼m approaches one. Last but not least, complete cure kinetics enables users or formulators to readily identify the
values of 𝛼(%) and calculate ̇𝛼(= d𝛼
dt = Δ𝛼
Δt , 1∕s) at any time or temperature, including Tpeak, from a DSC exothermic
curve, as illustrated in Table 5.6. Comprehensive cure descriptions should, however, incorporate viscosity and
rheological behaviors that provide the simultaneous evaluation of essential attributes such as the gel point, 𝛼gel,
the minimum dynamic viscosity (i.e., 𝜂*min), the temperature at 𝜂*min, and modulus profiles. Rheology will be
discussed immediately following kinetics.
5.1.7
Application of cure kinetics to processing
As discussed, the nth-order cure equation of d𝛼
dt = e14.348 ⋅e
−𝟖𝟑𝟏𝟔.2
T
⋅(1 −𝛼)1.308 as determined via Kissinger’s plot and
isothermal DSC combined, is adequate to describe cure behaviors and predict cure schedules for the FBE-V1 coat-
ing due to the method’s valid assumption that ̇𝛼max occurs close to Tpeak. This subsection is dedicated to the effective
application of cure kinetics to a customer’s oven profile in the field, where the preheated parts or panels are coated
and then returned to the oven for post cure. Considering the nth-order kinetics, Equation 6 (Table 5.7) is rewritten
as Equation 6a, where k(T) = A ⋅exp
(
−Ea
RT
)
is a function dependent solely on the cure temperature (T) since Ea
and A are already known. By integrating Equation 6a, we get (−1) ⋅(1−𝛼)−n+1
−n+1
= k(T) ⋅t + Constant C, where Con-
stant C =
1
n−1 at t = 0 and 𝛼= 0. It is subsequently rewritten as Equation 6b and converted to Equations 6c/d,
as listed in Table 5.7. It is seen that Equation 6d is identical to the one presented in the literature [17], with the
exception that the cured fraction 𝛼is employed here as opposed to the unreacted fraction x = 1−𝛼used there.
Equation 6c (Table 5.7) is then used to compute the cure start time tstart’s at intervals of 60 sec, and Equation
6d is used to calculate the accumulative cure% at any oven temperature, since k(T) and n = 1.308 at 325 ∘F (repre-
senting an average of the in situ oven plateau temperatures recorded entirely by Datapag at the customer’s place,
as shown in Figure 5.11a) are both determined. The specifics are provided in Table 5.8, where the temperatures
in k(T) are expressed as absolute values in ∘K. As shown in Figure 5.11a, a real-time cure curve is developed at
the end.
Under the same dynamic post-cure oven conditions and assuming that timing starts when coated parts enter the
oven, the worksheet (Table 5.8) estimates that the times required to achieve 50% (t1/2) and 99% (t0.99) cure levels
are approximately 3.5 and 16.0 min, respectively. The customer can therefore adjust the line speed to guarantee
the cure is complete in 16.0 min (also refer to Figure 5.11a) prior to the parts exiting the oven for cooling without
modifying the oven settings. As a rule of thumb, cure levels (𝛼’s) at or above 99% are considered to be fully cured
for most epoxy coatings; however, there are exceptions based on formulations and specifically the Tg capability. In
turn, fully cured products typically exhibit optimal performance.
As shown in Figure 5.11b, isothermal cure curves at any objective temperature of interest can be easily estab-
lished by substituting each specific isothermal temperature and solving the ODE of 𝛼(%) in terms of time (sec) with
Table 5.7

VisualLab or MATLAB. In one aspect, solving the nth-order kinetic equation using Kissinger’s+Iso yields a cure
time of 19.2 min at a 99% cure level for FBE-V1, that is, t0.99 = 19.2 min. In another aspect, the DSC curve-fitted SB

T
⋅𝛼0.40 ⋅(1 −𝛼)1.13 for FBE-V1 under identical isothermal conditions at 325 ∘F
predicts t0.99 = 12.3 min, which is even shorter than 16.0 min derived from Figure 5.11a for a dynamic cure (i.e.,
ramping from room temperature to and then remaining at 325 ∘F). The nth order is less aggressive because it omits
the 𝛼m term or the initial fast-cure stage; hence, t0.99 = 16.0 min derived from a dynamic cure profile makes more
sense than one derived from an isothermal cure when it comes to the nth-order model in practice. Technically, the
cure time should begin to be measured when the coated film achieves the bulk temperature consistently (i.e., the

154
5 Cure Kinetics and Rheology
plateau zone in Figure 5.11a or the target temperature in an isothermal setting). In fact, a real-time cure schedule
is more effective and beneficial to customers than an isothermal one. Figure 5.11b objectively illustrates how exec-
utive cure curves of time against temperature at any chosen cure level or window (e.g., t1/2, t0.90, t0.95, t0.99, etc., as
shown in Figure 5.8) on technical data sheets are derived from applied cure kinetics.
5.1.8
Implementation of cure kinetics in formulation
In addition to offering data-driven guidance for the processing and application of coatings, cure kinetics pro-
vides directive insights into formulations for rapid and proactive screening of reactive ingredients such as resins,
crosslinkers, catalysts, and additives. Physical testing is time-consuming and provides only limited insight into the
technical aspects of complex compositions and advanced formulations.
5.1.8.1
Resins
DGEBAs with functionality (f) = 2 (refer to Figure 1.1 in Chapter 1) are most commonly used for liquid and
powder epoxy coatings. When considering the DGEBA of incremental MWs such as Types 4, 5, and 7 resins,
parameters such as viscosity, Tm, and EEWs are directly proportional to the number “n” of the repeating unit
and increase as n (not a reaction order here) increases; however, the di-functionality remains unchanged. It is of
great interest to determine the quantitative relationship between epoxy resin MWs and their curing responses.
Cure kinetics is capable of scrutinizing such technical information; for example, Table 5.9 details the DOEs of
three executed FBE powder coatings (i.e., FBE-O1, -O2, and -O3) utilizing three types of bulk resins individually
(i.e., Types 4, 5, and 7).

Tabulated in Table 5.9 also include the SB (m, n) kinetics (by fitting DSC curves conducted at 20.0 ∘C/min)
and physical properties selectively assessed for FBE-O1, -O2, and -O3, with Olin’s FortegraTM 104 (EEW 1010,
Tm 100 ∘C estimated) accounting for the remaining 15% by weight of the total resins. Ea increases noticeably as
resin MWs increase (i.e., from Type 4 to Type 5 to Type 7), while the reaction orders m down and n up, all at an
identical formulation index and catalyst loading. The total reaction order is essentially constant, remaining at
1.33. Isothermal cure times obtained by solving each of the three complete ODEs show that t0.50’s and t0.99’s
at 425 ∘F, for example, both steadily increase by seconds as the resin MW increases, which are consistent with gel
times. As the MW of a resin increases, the heat of reaction (𝛥H) and Tg decrease significantly due to the decreased
crosslinking. In the meantime, Tonset rises a few degrees, indicative of reduced reactivity for increased resin MWs.
It has been confirmed that fillers and pigments are inert and have minimal influence on curing behaviors. In terms
of physical properties, flexibility increases from 5.75∘/PD for FBE-O1 using only Type 4 to 8.18∘/PD for FBE-O3
using mostly Type 7 as a result of an extended linear structure caused by an increase in the resin MW. Due mostly
to MW-induced viscosity development, pill flows decline in a similar ladder pattern.
5.1.8.2
Crosslinkers
From the standpoint of FBE powder coating hardeners, the melting temperatures (Tm) of the crosslinkers influence
the minimum cure temperatures (Tcure) of the corresponding coatings; in general, the lower the Tm, the lower the
Tcure. Technically and practically, low application temperatures (LATs) for coating products are constantly desired
for saving energy and protection of heat-sensitive substrates (e.g., wood, plastics). For instance, dihydrazides of
various NH equivalent weights (EW-NH’s) such as VDH, ADH, SDH, and DDH (refer to Table 2.1 in Chapter 2)
allow FBE formulations for LATs because of their low Tms, as opposed to DICY, which has a relatively higher Tm
of 209.5 ∘C.
ADH is expected to give greater flexibility to cured films than DICY due to its linear C4H8 chain-contained
backbone, which is fundamentally equivalent to the effect of resin MWs. Due to their longer linear C8H16 and
C10H20 structures, SDH and DDH should exhibit superior performance in this regard. Cure kinetics is once again
the optimal technique for investigating FBEs of LATs, as it is all about structure-driven curing, that is, the extent
or fraction of cure (𝛼) as a function of temperature over time. As indicated, LAT-ADH was a commercial FBE
product for OD pipe applications per Zhang [30], while LAT-SDH and -DDH were experimental batches with
an identical resin package except SDH and DDH were substituted for ADH at an equal stoichiometric ratio or
formulation index (FI), respectively. LAT-DICY was similarly a marketable FBE product formulated with DICY as
the hardener for similar pipe applications. Each of these four formulations employed a Type 4 epoxy resin (EEW
938 g/eq), an imidazole adduct catalyst, and fillers at a loading level of 27.4% by weight of the overall formulation.
The SB (m, n) cure model in the form of Equation 11 was adopted, and conventional DSC curves performed at
20 ∘C/min are used to obtain all associated kinetic parameters by curve fitting, as previously discussed. Table 5.10
contains results including kinetic parameters (where A = 25,000); LAT-DICY is presented in parallel for compara-
tive purposes. FIs and catalyst loadings in phr were at comparable levels, although variations had an impact on the
outcomes. In general, the data reveal that (i) the reactivity (i.e., 𝛥H) of formulations is negatively correlated with
the equivalent weights of dihydrazides and DICY but positively correlated with Tg, (ii) LAT-DICY exhibits great
flexibility at similar gel times, pill flows, and Tg (which decreases as the MW of dihydrazides increases), and (iii)
dihydrazides should be able to readily improve structural flexibility further if their formulations are optimized. In
addition, SDH and DDH are optionally stronger crosslinkers than ADH for more flexible cured films. ADH, SDH,
and DDH allow lower curing temperatures or shorter curing times than DICY, as evidenced by significantly lower
Ea and the reaction order n for all three dihydrazides than those for DICY (49,300 J/mol and 1.66, respectively, the
highest values). Figure 5.12 demonstrates that, when considering only dihydrazides, ADH, SDH, and DDH are
virtually similar in terms of overall LAT performance, all being noticeably superior to DICY, despite the variable
catalyst loading levels.

Figure 5.12
Cure curves for LAT formulations with DICY and different dihydrazide crosslinkers, as determined by the ﬁtted
SB (m, n) kinetics.
Kinetic parameters are very compliant with DSC exothermic data. Tpeak and Tonset for these four formulations
are located at ∼174.0 and ∼165.0 ∘C, respectively, with the exception of Tonset for LAT-DICY, which falls at 145.3 ∘C,
which is consistent with its lower m = 0.69. In other words, both DICY and dihydrazides in the specified formula-
tions allow for great latency (pertinent to Tonset). The smaller m and larger n = 1.66 indicate that LAT-DICY cures
much faster in the early stage prior to Tpeak, while crosslinking reactions remarkably slow down after Tpeak. In
conclusion, kinetics quantifies even minute changes in the crosslinking processes of coatings, enabling unblinded
and proactive formulation decisions.
5.1.8.3
Catalysts
Often, if not always, appropriate catalysts are used in all types of epoxy formulations, including liquids and FBEs,
to reduce the energy barrier corresponding to Ea allowing curing reactions to proceed more rapidly. As described
in Chapter 3, the curing of epoxies is a complex process involving a series of concurrent and competing reac-
tions, most commonly epoxy-crosslinker co-polymerization and tertiary-amine-initiated homo-polymerization

5.1 Cure Kinetics
157
(i.e., epoxy etherification). Semi-solid and solid catalysts applicable to FBEs include tertiary amines, imidazoles,
imidazole adducts, and others such as triphenyl phosphine (TPP) and derivatives. In terms of cure kinetics, cat-
alyst types and loading levels have a substantial impact on Ea and the reaction orders. In this subsection, the SB
(m, n) cure model in the form of Equation 11 (Table 5.3) and DCS are again applied. This means that kinetic
parameters are all determined in the same manner using DSC exothermic curves (actually tested at 8.0 ∘C/min for
all these formulations), as discussed in previous sections, and that A is also held constant at 25,000.
DOEs consist of six FBE batches (Table 5.11) formulated with Olin’s DER 672U (an epoxy novolac, EEW 800)
and Kukdo’s KD-405 (a BPA-based phenolic, EW-PhOH 250) as the bulk resin and crosslinker, respectively, at
an FI of 1.05 and a P/B ratio of 3.33: 1, with the exception of IF-STD, which was an uncatalyzed formulation.
Note that 2PI, P100, 2MI, DMAP, and TPP stand for 2-propyl imidazole, Epikure P-100 (an imidazole adduct from
Hexion, analogous to other commercial grades such as Aradur 3088 and 9690 from Huntsman Advanced Materi-
als), 2-methyl imidazole, 4-dimethylaminopyridine, and triphenyl phosphine, which are all common catalysts for
epoxy curing, and that their loading levels are expressed in terms of phr (parts per hundred resin). Thermal and
kinetic results are presented in a random sequence in Table 5.11 and in part in Figure 5.13a, which highlights the
total reaction order of each formulation and isothermal cure times t1/2, t0.99, and t0.999 at 375 ∘F.

5 Cure Kinetics and Rheology
The inclusion of a catalyst consistently and considerably decreases Ea relative to IF-STD in the absence of any
catalyst; however, the reaction orders may or may not decrease simultaneously. 2PI had the lowest Ea reduction
(from 55.80 to 54.15 kJ/mol) of all the catalysts evaluated concurrently, indicating that 2PI is a less efficient catalyst
than the others. In contrast, 2MI and DMAP are equally effective for reducing Ea, which is indicative of the highest
reactivity. However, the Ea alone cannot sufficiently explain the cure rate ( ̇𝛼), as only the complete SB (m, n)
equation encompassing all four parameters of A, Ea, m, and n determines the overall curing behaviors.
Table 5.11’s results are technically informative. First, it is acknowledged that the 𝛼m term has little to do with the
presence or absence of catalyzation. In other words, m does not necessarily equal zero in catalyst-free formulations;
on the other hand, trace levels of catalysts such as ETPPI are already present in the underlying epoxy resins (refer
to Table 1.4 in Chapter 1), therefore IF-STD is not truly catalyst-free. The sum of m and n (Figure 5.13a) varies
considerably between 1.58 for 2PI and 1.21 for DMAP, depending on the catalyst types at a given loading level.
Second, the catalytic efficiency is specified in a decreasing order as DMAP > 2MI > TPP > P100 > 2PI, which is
consistent with gel times with the exception of TPP. Explicitly, TPP had the lowest enthalpy value (𝛥H = −42.3 J/g),
which is close to that of IF-STD but is more competitive overall than 2MI. Third, the effects of catalysts on the
reaction orders are rather unpredictable; for example, 2MI decreased m the most while DMAP decreased n the
most. Lower m and n values suggest that cure acceleration is encouraged prior to and following Tpeak, respectively.
In summary, the data collected in Table 5.11 and Figure 5.13a indicate that 2MI is a good choice for promoting
crosslinking at an early stage, although DMAP tends to finish curing the fastest; epoxy systems with n ≤1 can be
readily formulated with DMAP, followed by 2MI and TPP at a given loading. In other words, these catalysts, with
the exception of 2PI, are all viable catalyst options depending on the desired gel and cure time for a formulation
aimed at a particular application. Again, cure kinetics enables formulators to discern fine discrepancies in the
curing behaviors of one catalyst against another in a precisely measurable manner.
The TGA weight loss results (Figure 5.13b) are also technically instructive: first, thermal stability is explicitly
ranked as DMAP < 2MI < ETPPI < Epikure P-100, Aradur 3088 < Aradur 9690, from worst to best. Specifically,
DMAP and 2MI are entirely volatilized at temperatures of 134.8 and 178.2 ∘C, respectively. Epikure P-100 and
Aradur 3088 have comparative first onset temperatures of over 315 ∘C; however, Aradur 9690 has a lower Tonset at
184.4 ∘C but remains stable above 400 ∘C (equivalent to temperatures of 531.8 at 50% weight loss and over 600 ∘C at
99% weight loss, respectively). ETPPI is as thermally stable as Epikure P-100 and Aradur 3088 imidazole adducts,
losing 90% of its weight at 363.3 ∘C. Moreover, it is likely inferred that ETPPI and imidazole adducts (such as
Epikure P-100, Aradur 3088, and Aradur 9690) are better suited for high-temperature curing (e.g., greater than
200–250 ∘C) than DMAP and 2MI. On the other hand, it is implied that DMAP and 2MI are suitable catalysts for
fast-cure formulations and that their combinations with imidazole adducts and/or ETPPI are likely best suited
for fast and robust cure at elevated temperatures, whereas they may perform similarly in low-temperature (e.g., ≤
150 ∘C) curing powder systems, subject to experimental verification.
5.1.8.4
Reactive additives
Aromatic acid molecules such as pyrogallic acid (PGA, Tm 133.3 ∘C) [31] are reactive additives that are sometimes
added to epoxy formulations (e.g., again, FBEs) to improve adhesion to metal substrates. Increased adhesion is
advantageous for improving cathodic disbondment testing (CDT) performance because CDT is fundamentally
influenced by two parameters, namely wet adhesion and moisture impermeability. As an example, PGA is com-
posed of three phenyl hydroxyls that, through a plausible chelating mechanism, contribute to increased adhesion.
It is unknown whether PGA directly affects cure reactions until cure kinetics is introduced to provide conclusive
evidence, as shown in Table 5.12 and Figure 5.14, where a ladder DOE with one variable using FBE formulations,
subsequent thermal and kinetic data, and overlaid DSC exothermic curves are collected. Due to the compatibility
of PGA with weakly acidic phenolics, the IF-ADD1, -ADD2, and -ADD3 formulations were based on epoxy novolac
and phenolic curing chemistry (similar to those discussed in the catalyst section, except that the actual catalyst

used was 2PI and at 0.27 phr of the total epoxy and phenolic resins). It makes less sense to apply acidic PGA to
extremely basic amine cure chemistry (such as DICY).
These three formulations were designed to exhibit slow cure responses by using a low loading level of 2PI; in the
meantime, three different PGA loading levels at zero (as the control), 0.44, and 0.77 phr are utilized. The thermal
and kinetic properties of formulations with varying amounts of PGA exhibit obvious and consistent trends, albeit
maybe at an insubstantial scale. Specifically, Tg decreases, but Tonset, Tpeak, and the heat of reactions gradually
increase with increasing PGA loading levels (Figure 5.14), showing that PGA impedes crosslinking reactions in
these formulations. Ea increases kinetically from 54.9 kJ/mol for the control to 55.25 kJ/mol at 0.44 phr of PGA
to 55.3 kJ/mol at 0.77 phr, respectively; meanwhile, m tends to remain at 0.35 or slightly increase to 0.38, while
n mainly remains at 1.14. It appears that the total reaction order (m + n) remains at 1.50 for everyone. Overall,
PGA as a reactive additive impairs or slows down cure reactions, and to a greater extent at higher loading levels,
consistent with iso-conversional cure times at, for example, 425 ∘F being prolonged by 5–10 sec as PGA levels
increase (Table 5.12). From the perspective of physical testing, CDT and HWA findings imply that the addition of

5 Cure Kinetics and Rheology
PGA, preferably at a loading level of 0.44 phr equivalent to IF-ADD2, improves adhesion to steel substrates at the
cost of a slightly slower cure rate.
In these three formulations with identical curing chemistry, the values of Ea obtained for IF-ADD1, -ADD2,
and -ADD3 correspond strictly to the horizontal positions of Tpeak in DSC exothermic curves, that is, Ea’s in the
order from high (IF-ADD3) to low (IF-ADD1) are translated into Tpeak’s positioned orderly from the right to the
left, which is both qualitatively and quantitatively valid. These kinetic findings confirm that PGA is reactively
involved in the curing process, which is unsurprising given that PGAs of triphenyl hydroxyls (Ph-OH’s) are funda-
mentally acidic (H+’s) like a low-MW phenolic monomer or lignin (a natural wood ingredient; refer to Figure 2.8a
in Chapter 2), capable of interacting with OH’s and metal ions on substrate surfaces and with the bulk epoxides
in the formulations.
5.1.9
Implementation of cure kinetics in 2K liquid epoxy coatings
Cure kinetics is perfectly applicable to FBE systems since these epoxy powder coatings are solvent-free, allowing
DSC exothermic curves to be acquired quickly and easily. Consequently, kinetic data can be utilized to aid for-
mulation designs and optimizations related to any reactive components, as precedingly described. Similarly, and
without limitation to theory, cure kinetics is applicable to 1/2K liquid coatings so long as they are VOC (volatile
organic compound)-free or conditioned to have solvents purged out prior to performing DSC for thermal char-
acterization. As a straightforward illustration of cure kinetics applied to a 2K liquid epoxy coating, a hands-on
case study is shown and explained herein. Similar formulation philosophy and specifications, including inherent
concepts and the FI, will be elaborated in Chapter 6 for this particular liquid epoxy formulation (refer to Table 6.2).
The 2K liquid coating intended for, for example, steel metal applications (perhaps applicable to OD pipe) is
formulated with amine curing agents to have a mixing ratio of 2: 1 (volume) for application, that is, Part A (epoxies)
versus Part B (crosslinkers); it should be noted that it contains a trace amount of VOC due to residual solvents
trapped in Part A. DSC was carried out as follows: Part A (12.811 lbs/gal) and Part B (9.132 lbs/gal) of this 2K
liquid coating were appropriately measured per the volume ratio or weighted per the calculated parts by weight and
speedmixed immediately in a disposable container, then a mixed coating sample of 5–10 mg was quickly weighed
up and loaded into DSC equipment prior to running a standard dynamic program at 6.0 ∘C/min. Due to the rapid
curing that occurs upon mixing, rapid sampling is essential for accurate DSC data. The subsequent exothermic
curve was then fitted using the SB (m, n) model and DCS, resulting in a complete kinetic analysis (Table 5.13).
When it comes to evaluating a new or untested epoxy coating, whether it is a powder or a liquid, customers or
even formulators themselves will likely want to have cure schedules in advance, as either undercuring or over-
curing a coating would compromise the mechanical and physical properties that would be assessed later. DSC
kinetics is unquestionably the optimal method for providing rapid and accurate answers to questions regarding
cure schedules. In this instance, and from a kinetic perspective, Ea at 44.80 kJ/mol as the energy threshold for
curing to proceed is significantly lower than those of almost all (if not all) FBEs, indicative of poor latency (or

high reactivity) if the 2K liquid coating is mixed together. In addition, m as low as 0.24 indicates that the coating
cures quickly in the early stage (i.e., prior to Tpeak), whereas n as high as 1.52 indicates that the coating takes a
long time to attain full cure, especially at low-cure temperatures (e.g., ambient conditions). Large values of n are
consistent with the DSC curve’s characteristically extended tails. Further, it is understood and confirmed that at a
given cure temperature, the reaction order n is the primary factor controlling the cure rate and, consequently, the
cure time at the later conversion phase (after Tpeak and approaching 𝛼= 1); the larger the value of n, the longer
the cure time required. As a result, excessive curing is not a concern for this product. Specifically, cure kinetic data
accurately suggest that this coating product requires 19.2 hours at room temperature to cure to 99% after mixing
and that the cure time will be reduced by more than half if cured at 40 ∘C. When subjected to heat, which makes
more sense depending on the customer’s process capabilities, the coating cures in only 13.9 min at 121 ∘C.

Debrief C Evaluation of latent catalysts by DSC kinetics
Powder coatings have gained market share steadily over the years due to the absence of VOCs throughout appli-
cation. Formulators are always interested in novel latent catalysts for functional epoxy powder coatings as a
formulation enabler for the development of high-performance goods. As previously discussed, common catalysts
for FBEs include, but are not limited to, tertiary amines, imidazoles, and derivatives, and quaternary ammonium

162
5 Cure Kinetics and Rheology
salts (refer to Chapter 2). Balances of latency, affordability, reactivity, and compatibility are challenges associated
with the continuous quest for the ideal catalyst in functional FBE powder coatings. Simply put, a substance that is
cost-effectively stable during storage and transport but manageably reactive upon thermal activation is generally
favored and needed.
Thermal characterization by DSC cure kinetics can be used to investigate potential catalysts or accelerators
applicable to epoxy systems. In this subsection, this technique is employed to map the performance of a variety of
liquid and solid amino-functional catalysts of latency. Specifically, a group of 11 amino molecules of varying struc-
tures (Figure 5.15a), that is, latent salts (C6) and carbene precursors (C5), were identified and analyzed in terms
of their catalytic effects in a simplified epoxy-anhydride formulation where liquid EPON 828 (EEW ∼188.5 g/eq)
and solid HHPA (i.e., hexahydrophthalic anhydride, EW-anhydride 154.2 g/eq) were employed as the bulk resin
and crosslinker, respectively. The formulation parameters and laboratory DOEs are presented in Table 5.14, where
2MI denotes latent 2-methyl imidazole (as the control); the specific cure reactions between epoxides and anhy-
drides are re-illustrated in Figure 5.15b. Notably, carbenes are extremely reactive carbon species that are capable
of undergoing C-H bond insertions to crosslink epoxies and other systems (refer to bis-diazirines in Table 2.2k in
Chapter 2 and Debrief C in Chapter 3).
In one aspect, there were three experimental inputs on each catalyst of 12 in total, including 2MI as the control,
at a 1-to-1 molar ratio of EPON 828 to HHPA in conjunction with a 1.0% or 8.0% catalyst loading level by mole as
well as a 2-to-1 molar ratio in conjunction with an 8.0% catalyst loading level by mole, respectively, as outlined
in Table 5.14. In the other aspect, there were also three DSC outputs for the control and each of the 11 catalyst
candidates for 𝛥H (J/g), Tg ( ∘C), Tpeak ( ∘C), Tonset ( ∘C), cure kinetic parameters (A, Ea, m, n), and predicted t0.999

the best as a latent catalyst, followed distantly by L/Cat-66 (structurally similar to L/Cat-88) and 1MI, greatly
exceeding the control (i.e., 2MI). Specifically, and as shown in Figure 5.16a, in the case of a 1-to-1 molar ratio and
a 1.0% mol catalyst loading level, L/Cat-88 decreased Tpeak/Tonset from 163.6/148.6 ∘C for 2MI to 144.2/123.8 ∘C
while increasing Tg from 109.5 ∘C for 2MI to 118.4 ∘C when running at 5.0 ∘C/min, corresponding to data for #4
versus #1, respectively. In the instance of a 1-to-1 molar ratio but an 8.0% mol catalyst loading level, L/Cat-88
outpaced the control in decreasing Tpeak/Tonset (from 119.5/93.0 ∘C for 2MI to 109.4/82.8 ∘C) and in increasing Tg
(from 107.2 ∘C for 2MI to 121.4 ∘C), which corresponds to #5 and #2 in Figure 5.16a, respectively. When the molar
ratio of epoxy to anhydride is increased to 2: 1, DSC exothermic curves clearly exhibit a pattern diverging into
dual peaks (associated accordingly with dual Tpeak and Tonset) corresponding to #3 for L/Cat-88 and #6 for 2MI,
respectively. Explicitly, the second peak was a result of epoxy homo-polymerization in the epoxide-rich system,
which was boosted by each individual tertiary amine catalyst. L/Cat-88 remains much more effective than 2MI in
terms of Tpeak/Tonset reduction and Tg enhancement at a 2-to-1 molar ratio (i.e., #3 and #6 in Figure 5.16a).
With respect to cure kinetics, the #2 for L/Cat-88 and #5 for 2MI at a 1-to-1 molar ratio and an 8.0% mol catalyst
loading are representatively determined in accordance with the autocatalytic model of four parameters, which

164
5 Cure Kinetics and Rheology
is also presented in Figure 5.16a. Overall, L/Cat-88 enables lower Ea, m, and n than Cat-2MI at a given molar
loading level, allowing the experimental formulation to cure at 400 ∘F in 25.0 sec for L/Cat-88 versus 39.8 sec for
2MI. The trends in the cure kinetic parameters and the model-predicted cure times are consistent with those
in DSC Tpeak/Tonset. However, catalysts are typically added to powder coating systems in terms of mass rather
than mole; hence, L/Cat-88 (MW 250)’s mass loading level (in terms of per hundred resin, or phr) is at least
three times that of 2MI (MW 82) at a given molar loading level, as is its cost. In other words, L/Cat-88 may not
necessarily be more advantageous or cost-effective than 2MI in a practical sense. As experimentally confirmed,
L/Cat-88 is not so effective as 2MI at a mass ratio of 1: 1, which corresponds to a molar ratio of 2.6: 8.0. How-
ever, L/Cat-88 is somewhat more reactive than 2MI at a mass ratio of 2: 1 (corresponding to a molar ratio of
2.6: 4.0), which is better than anticipated. L/Cat-88 precursors or analogs are commercially accessible, such as
BLD Pharmatech’s 3-benzyl-1,2-dimethyl-1H-imidazol-3-ium chloride (CAS# 36443-79-5, Figure 5.16c), which
performed effectively in two applied epoxy-phenolic formulations examined, especially when paired with an imi-
dazole adduct at a weight ratio of 50/50. In addition, DSC thermal and kinetic analysis revealed that the L/Cat-88
precursor behaved differently from L/Cat-88 itself. Figures 5.16b/c propose their functioning mechanisms; the
bicarbonate-based L/Cat-88 is presumably producing carbene, whereas the chloride-based precursor or analog
develops an imidazole-like molecule prior to serving as a catalyst.
Recaps and Highlights (I)
The cure kinetic models for reactive polymeric coatings based on Tg (glass transition temperature) and viscosity
are limited or hardly operable, so is the BD approach. The gel model is facile to make competitive analysis of Ea
(activation energy). Kissinger’s plot is effective in retrieving Ea from the valid assumption that the maximum cure
rate ̇𝛼max takes place at Tpeak, and it is found to adequately describe the cure behaviors of some functional coat-
ings, such as FBE powders, allowing the establishment of cure times required at a given oven temperature profile
and in situ cure schedules in the field when combined with isothermal DSC studies that additionally estimate an
nth-order reaction order. On the basis of iso-conversional and non-constant Ea hypotheses, MFK is easily opera-
tional via TRIOS, which generates isothermal cure curves without the need for reaction orders. Excluding MFK,
a four-parameter (i.e., A, Ea, m, and n) autocatalytic or SB (m, n) kinetic model is as follows:
d𝛼
dt = A ⋅e
−Ea
RT ⋅𝛼m ⋅(1 −𝛼)n
Which is regarded as general, universal, and perhaps the most comprehensive and useful cure kinetic expression
covering all other empirical forms, including an nth-order model (when m = 0) and a first-order model (when m =
0 and n = 1). The 𝛼m term by itself may not necessarily have any relation to catalyst addition. Non-reactive fillers
have no influence on kinetics. The sum of m and n, or the overall reaction order, is infrequently constant but
generally remains between 1.0 and 2.0 (or up to 3.0 for high Tgs), depending on formulation chemistry, catalyst
types, and catalyst loading levels. Generally, m < 0.5 and n < 1.0 are indications of rapid gelling and curing, which
are typically attributed to catalysts. High Tg epoxy formulations are frequently characterized by n > 1.5 and a high
𝛥H value (such as greater than |−80 J/g|), but not vice versa. Often, n values greater than 1.5 or even 2.0 correspond
to long tails in DSC exothermic curves, indicating a significantly longer required cure time. Such products are not
concerned with overcuring; rather, an extended post-baking time is desired. It is strongly recommended that the
SB (m, n) model for a particular thermosetting coating be solved experimentally and numerically, as opposed
to analytically; specifically, independent parameters of Ea (mathematically corrected to A), m, and n are readily
quantified via curve fitting of dynamic DSC exothermic data at a given heating rate, for example, as per a DCS
paradigm. The reaction orders m and n intrinsically govern the shape and slope of a DSC thermogram before
and after Tpeak, respectively; Ea and A positively define the horizontal position of Tpeak, and vice versa; and heat

5.2 Rheology
165
capacity (Cp) and enthalpy (𝛥H, or heat of reactions) determine the vertical position and amplitude of Tpeak. In
general, 𝛥H is dependent on the total amounts of crosslinking potential and independent of catalysts or heating
rates; Tpeak grows with the heating rate (𝛽), which has little effect on kinetics with the exception of some variations.
A completed cure kinetic ODE is consequently applied to real-world cure conditions using MATLAB or VisualLab
for predictions, such as isothermal (t–𝛼) and dynamic (t–T) cure curves, extents of cure (𝛼’s) at arbitrary times or
temperatures, and many more, as required.
The chemistry-driven cure kinetics of liquid and powder coatings are informative and valuable in revealing
insights into known and unknown formulas, allowing formulators to avoid ineffective or blind formulation
attempts. Kinetic parameters respond sensitively to selections and modifications of bulk resins, crosslinkers,
catalysts, and additives, alone or in combination, and are capable of driving formulation improvement and
optimization and advanced development when accompanied with physical testing outcomes. The quantitative
differences between dihydrazides and DICY as crosslinkers and between imidazole and TPP as catalysts at a given
loading level can be easily and exactly determined by kinetic studies; PGA as an adhesion-promoting additive
that integrally inhibits cure reactions is revealed precisely by kinetic discrepancies. Cure kinetics are equally
important in cure-driven end product performance and platform product characterization, such as competitive
analysis, reverse engineering, quality control (QC), stability, shelf life, and so on.
5.2
Rheology
Given sufficient time, everything flows, including the human body. Without confining itself to theory and
within the framework of fluid mechanics, rheology is the study of strains or stress deformation (= Δx
y0 = tan 𝛼x if
one-dimensional or 1D, as illustrated in Figure 5.17, referred to as 𝛾for shear and 𝜀for extension or elongation,
often dimensionless in %), that is, liquid flow and solid deformation, of a fluid-able material subjected to a
stress (= force (F)
area (A), denoted by 𝜏for shear or 𝜎for extension, both in Pa) at a particular temperature and pressure.
Rheology is one of the most elegant and eloquent sciences, covering mechanics, mathematics, physiochemistry,
engineering, and other fields.
Applied rheology relates phenomenological theories to the measurement, characterization, processing, and
product performance of a large array of non-reactive and reactive materials, including paints, coatings, adhesives,
inks, and many other functional systems. Remember that as coatings formulators, our primary objective is to
select the simplest and most appropriate model that sufficiently reflects the relevant phenomena or observations
for microstructure (non-reactive)- or curing (reactive)-related problems of concern. Specifically, one would
end up selecting appropriate rheometers (including geometry, methods, and settings, such as steady-state,
transient, or oscillatory) for particular samples to be tested, analyze data, fit constitutive models, explain struc-
tural mechanisms, predict actual applications and product performance, and ultimately advance formulation
excellence.

5.2.1
Rheology of non-reactive ﬂuids
Graessley stated that all real substances are viscoelastic (VE) [33]. Before discussing viscoelasticity (VE) and
viscoelastic materials, which are of the utmost importance and interest in this chapter, it is crucial to under-
stand the hierarchical classifications of non-Newtonian (nonlinear) fluids in comparison with Newtonian (linear)
fluids in advance, as outlined in Figure 5.18, where strain rate ( ̇𝛾)-dependent viscosity of these fluids under a
shear is either time dependent or time independent. Non-Newtonian fluids are not necessarily VE materials;
rather, most rheological behaviors and properties of non-Newtonian fluids overlap with those of VE materials
[34]. When using linear theories, viscoelasticity is the time-dependent anelastic behavior of materials, although
viscoelastic characteristics may be regarded as time-independent in a nonlinear setting. Fundamental rheologi-
cal concepts and theories surrounding a stress 𝜏(also known as a shear stress), a strain 𝛾(also known as a shear
strain), and a strain rate ̇𝛾(= 1
y0 ⋅dx(t)
dt , also known as a shear rate) are developed using non-reactive fluids, such
as Newtonian fluids (purely viscous, such as water and solvents) at room temperature or elevated temperatures.
They are then modified and expanded to physically complicated fluids and VE materials (such as polymer melts,
paints, coatings, and adhesives) and further to chemically reactive systems (e.g., thermosetting polymers such as
epoxies, polyurethanes, and so on) when new sciences and technologies emerge over time. This subsection dis-
cusses the rheology and viscoelasticity of non-reactive fluids so that well-established concepts and phrases are
familiarized and understood. Please note that all interactions and correlations are shown at constant temper-
atures and atmospheric pressure, unless otherwise specified. If readers are interested in constitutive algorithms,
including MATLAB codes, underlying characterization, and modeling of viscoelastic materials, there are resources
accessible [35, 36].
Newton’s law on viscous liquids (e.g., water) and Hooke’s law on elastic solids (e.g., rubber) are the simplest and
earliest constitutive equations characterizing fluids, as shown in Table 5.15, in terms of the one-dimensional (1D,
scalar) and the three-dimensional (3D, tensor), respectively. The time (t)-dependent strain rate (or shear rate) ̇𝛾
∝d𝛾/dt in 1/s constitutes one of the most important parameters or variables (together with 𝜏and 𝛾) for under-
standing and defining rheology or flow behaviors. Occasionally, Newtonian liquids in terms of extensional (or
elongational) viscosity are considered as VE liquids (viscous fluids with some elasticity) and Neo-Hookean’s as
VE solids (elastic solids with some viscosity), respectively. Viscosity (𝜂, 𝜂ue) is intrinsic to liquids, much as elastic-
ity (G—shear modulus, E—tensile or Young’s modulus) is inherent to solids. Ideal Newtonian liquids with zero
viscosity do not exist, nor do perfect Hooke’s solids with infinite elasticity. The modulus of a Neo-Hookean solid in
uniaxial extension (or 3D) is E = 3G (Equation 15b), which corresponds to a linear relationship between elastic
modulus E and shear modulus G as E = 2G(1+v), where the Poisson’s ratio v = 0.5 for incompressibility. Almost all
liquids and solids, if not all, are incompressible, including coating materials. In the meantime, it should be noted
that Trouton’s rule defines 𝜎E = σ11 −𝜎22 = 𝜂E ̇𝜀in consideration of a solid, where 𝜎E and 𝜂E are, respectively, the
real tensile stress (𝜎11—pull and 𝜎22—squeeze) and the extensional viscosity; Equation 14b is often known as

Trouton’s expression for simple Newtonian liquids. A shear flow equals the sum of extensional and rotational
flows in the sense that extensional flows are purely stretching flows (no rotation), while rotational flows are too
weak to deform microstructure. Unfortunately, extension flows are difficult to create and analyze in the labora-
tory; unentangled polymer solutions (also known as Boger fluids, which are elastic yet have a constant viscosity
of, for example, ≤100 Pa-s) and low-viscosity materials are more challenging to place in an extensional flow.
Newton’s law (Equations 14a/b), which establishes the viscous boundary for liquids, defines the apparent vis-
cosity of a liquid as 𝜂= 𝜏/ ̇𝛾(not 𝛾). Likewise, the modulus of a solid is governed by G = 𝜏/𝛾(not ̇𝛾) according
to Hooke’s law (Equation 15a), which determines the elastic boundary for solids. Viscoelastic (VE) fluids or
materials exhibit, upon deformation, strain and/or stress responses consisting of a viscous characteristic typical
of Newtonian’s liquids as well as an elastic component typical of Hooke’s solids, that is, complex rheology. Surfac-
tant solutions (e.g., body wash), dilute polymer solutions (e.g., oil additives), concentrated solutions (e.g., viscosity
> 100 Pa-s), and entangled polymers (e.g., polyethylene melts), emulsions (e.g., mayonnaises), suspensions (e.g.,
latex paints), and gels (e.g., gelatin) are six types of applied materials that are representative of such VE fluids.
Viscoelasticity is a time-dependent phenomenon; VE behaviors are typically linear at small deformations, that
is, the so-called linear viscoelasticity (LVE), and ostensibly nonlinear when subjected to large deformations, that
is, the more complex nonlinear viscoelasticity (NLVE), both ascribed to microstructures and molecular responses
to deformations in specific circumstances. LVE behaviors are initially and best described by a simple Maxwell
model conceptually formed of a Hookean spring and a Newtonian dashpot in series (Figure 5.19a), and then
by a Kelvin–Voigt model of the two elements (i.e., a spring and a dashpot) connected in parallel (Figure 5.19b),
respectively.

In a Maxwell or stress relaxation model (Figure 5.19a) that simulates VE liquids using a linear elastic solid of
G0 coupled with a viscous liquid of 𝜂0 at t = 0 sec, the spring and the dashpot are subject to the same stress 𝜏, but
each element responds with an independent strain of 𝜀1 and 𝜀2, so the total strain 𝜀= 𝜀1 + 𝜀2 remains constant
(i.e., ̇𝜖= d𝜀/dt = 0). Constitutively, this model is a linear first-order representing linear viscoelasticity (LVE), that
is, 0 = ̇𝜖1 + ̇𝜖2, or 0 = ̇𝜏∕G0 + 𝜏∕𝜂0 in mathematical terms. In a Kelvin–Voigt or creep scheme (Figure 5.19b) used
to model VE solids, the spring and the dashpot are parallel, and each element is subject to the same strain (𝜀)
but a different stress, resulting in a total stress of 𝜏= 𝜏1 + 𝜏2. In Table 5.16, numerical solutions to Maxwell’s and
Kelvin–Voigt’s LVE models, where Laplace transforms may apply accordingly, are compiled. Notably, 𝜆≡𝜂0/G0, as
introduced by Maxwell’s LVE model, is the dimensionless relaxation time (i.e., relaxation to a constant strain 𝜀) in
seconds (sec or s), which is a constant defined by the initial viscous (𝜂0) and elastic (G0) components according to
Newton’s and Hooke’s laws. The characteristic relaxation time 𝜆is strongly dependent on temperature, pressure,
and other factors that affect the mobility of the LVE material under consideration and is roughly inverse to the
rate of molecular motion; for example, 𝜆is very short above the glass transition temperature (Tg) and it is very
long below it. 𝜆R = 𝜂/E, as obtained from the Kelvin–Voigt LVE model, is similarly explained, albeit it is more
applicable to VE solids. As two of the most important properties of VE materials, stress relaxation and anelastic
creep recovery tests are often both transient.
By referring to Equations 16b/c in Table 5.16, a stress relaxation test determines how much t-dependent stress
𝜏(t) or 𝜎(t) a material can withstand at a given deformation, such as 𝜀; the stress and modulus diminish to zero at t =
infinity. A creep and creep recovery test, on the other hand, monitors the t-dependent strain 𝛾(t) or 𝜀(t) in response
to a suddenly applied constant load (or stress) 𝜏0 and to the subsequent removal of that load at t1, as illustrated
in Figure 5.20a, where shear creep compliance J(t < t1) = 𝜀(t)/𝜎0 = 1/G(t) in the creep zone (t < t1), by referring
to Equations 17b/c/d in Table 5.16. Thus, compliance is the inverse of modulus (or stiffness) in terms of linear
attributes. In the creep recovery zone (t > t1), the extents of strain recoiling vary depending on the elasticity of VE
materials. The recoverable shear compliance at steady state is Js
0 = 𝜎0𝜂, where Js
0 = 0 denotes a Newtonian liquid;
when considerably above Tg, Js
0 is essentially temperature independent. In addition, J(s)G(s) = 1
s2 is a unique and
straightforward relationship between relaxation and creep behaviors for an LVE material derived from Laplace
transforms (J(t) →J(s), etc.) [37].
Further, in consideration of a VE material that has a typical processing time of t (or duration of observation), an
important parameter known as the Deborah number De = 𝜆/t (= 𝜆𝜔) is introduced to best classify the likelihood of
linear and nonlinear VE behaviors, that is, LVE and NLVE associated, respectively, with small and large deforma-
tions (strains and stresses), for complex fluids or materials (including coatings and polymer systems), as rigorously
captured by the Pipkin diagram [38]. In a Pipkin map, the abscissa is the imposed angular frequency (𝜔) multiplied
by 𝜆, which is indicative of De, and the ordinate is the dimensionless strain amplitude A, or 𝛾0. De is 0 and infinite

(i.e., ∞) for a Newtonian liquid on the left boundary of a Pipkin diagram and a Hooke’s solid on the right; De is
low when viscous liquid behavior dominates, while De is high when elastic solid behavior dominates. Recently,
the Pipkin map has been expanded constitutively to accommodate TEVP (thixo-elasto-visco-plastic) materials
[39], including those with Bingham behaviors, that is, yield stress (𝜏y) liquids. Note that unless the deformation
is very small or slow, the rheological behavior of a VE fluid is strongly nonlinear. Weissenberg number Wi = 𝜆̇𝛾
(= 𝛾0𝜆𝜔) involving a characteristic rate of deformation rather than a duration of observation 𝜆is thus adopted in
place of De, which more precisely defines viscoelasticity and flow unsteadiness, to characterize fluid nonlinearity
of a rheological response [40].
Non-Newtonian behaviors of shear rate ( ̇𝛾) dependence described by a function of 𝜂( ̇𝛾) are primarily dilatant
shear thickening (e.g., sand mud), pseudo-plastic shear thinning (e.g., motor oil, blood), and yield stress (e.g.,
ketchup, lotions), which includes Bingham fluids exhibiting either Newtonian or a plastic shear-thinning flow
with a yield, as shown in Figure 5.20b. Yield (𝜏y) is the threshold force or stress required for a liquid to start
to flow. Particularly, t-dependent dilatants and shear-thinners are classified as rheopectic (e.g., silly putty) and
thixotropic (e.g., paints) fluids, respectively. Power law (consisting of two constants, k and n), often known as the
“Ostwald−de Waele relationship,” is the most popular constitutive equation for describing pseudo-plastic behav-
iors of general viscous fluids subject to a steady shear. When n = 1, the 𝜂( ̇𝛾)-defined power law (Equation 18 in
Table 5.17) is simplified to Newton’s law (i.e., Equation 14a in Table 5.15); when n > 1 or < 1, the power law
predicts shear-thickening or -shinning behaviors, respectively. The Cross model (four constants: 𝜂0, 𝜂∞, K in sec,
and n) describes Newtonian regions at both low and high-shear rates while capturing shear-thinning behaviors
at medium shear rates similar to the power law with n < 1, applicable to a variety of materials such as PS latex,
ABS melt at 200 ∘C, blood, xanthan, yogurt, and so on. Other well-known visco-plastic models include Ellis (three
constants) and Carreau (five constants). Additional models are available to simulate visco-plastic behaviors such
as Casson, Two-viscosity, and Papanastasiou, for which readers may refer to the comprehensive literature available
[41–43] for further information.
Fluids with yield stress (𝜏y), such as foodstuffs and personal care products, are visco-plastic and exhibit plastic
behaviors. Magnetic fluids may also behave similarly to yield stress liquids. Weak networks, gels, etc. formed by
flocculated particles are the source of yield stress. These unique liquids are mathematically best described by the
1D and 3D Bingham models (Equations 20a/b in Table 5.17). Herschel–Bulkley (𝜏= 𝜏y + 𝜂HB ̇𝛾n) and Casson

𝜏= √𝜏y + √𝜂c ̇𝛾) models likewise include 𝜏y in their respective constitutive expressions; the Herschel-Bulkley
equation is reduced to Bingham’s (Equation 20 in Table 5.17) when n = 1. In practical testing or studies, the yield
stress 𝜏y, which indicates the stress strength required to elicit a significant flow, must be measured using a very
low strain rate ( ̇𝛾); when mapping for 𝜏y, slip must be avoided. Thixotropic and rheopectic phenomena are also
highly important, as they are special shear thinning and thickening (i.e., continuous decrease and increase of the
apparent viscosity), respectively, which occur under a shear that evolves over time, followed by viscosity recovery
when the shear and flow are discontinued. In other words, both are described by a function of 𝜂( ̇𝛾, t), which
denotes concurrent strain rate- and time dependence and is indicative of the reversibility of structure change in
such materials. Specifically, thixotropic materials are true colloidal suspensions or dispersions with Newtonian
media, such as some paints, printing inks, food products, and crude oil, which are caused by particle structures
and interactions. As shown in Figure 5.21a, it is advantageous to use thixotropy in the paint industry, for example,
to facilitate transfer, dispensing, and application (leveling and sagging) by incorporating thixotropic agents or
additives such as polysaccharides (e.g., xanthan gum, sodium alginate) into particularly WB formulations.
In general, VE properties or behaviors are t-dependent, and VE materials with microstructures and 𝜏y’s (also
useful for processing) may exhibit not only time dependency (e.g., shear creep compliance J(t) = t/𝜂in Table 5.18)
but also amplitude (A)-dependent (e.g., shear-thinning) responses. Numerous polymer systems demonstrate LVE
characteristics when subjected to modest strains or stresses. Within the scope of LVE, so long as frequency (f)
in Hz is constant (it becomes nonlinear if f is changed), dynamic shear moduli and other LVE responses, such as
primarily G′ (storage modulus), G′′ (loss modulus), Tan𝛿(loss tangent), and 𝜂* (dynamic viscosity), are detailed in
Table 5.18 and selectively illustrated in Figure 5.21b, where the rubbery plateau (Gn

when well above Tg [33]) and terminal regions are indicative of MWs and/or crosslinking density. Oscillation
denotes that a dynamic stress is applied sinusoidally; a sinusoidal oscillatory test does not require any corrections
to account for edge fracture limits or similar conditions. The 𝛿represents the phase angle or shift—a difference or
gap between a strain applied at a certain frequency 𝜔as the input and a stress deformation response as the output;
0∘< 𝛿< 90∘are characteristic of VE materials, whereas 𝛿= 0∘, that is, the stress in phase with the strain so G′(𝜔)
= G and G′′(𝜔) = 0, represents a Hookean solid (purely elastic), and 𝛿= 90∘, that is, the stress out phase with the
strain but in phase with the strain rate of 𝛾0𝜔cos(𝜔t) so G′(𝜔) = 0 and G′′(𝜔) = 𝜂𝜔(Equation 21 in Table 5.18),
represents a Newtonian liquid (purely viscous), respectively. In other words, VE systems exhibit both viscous and
elastic responses since 0 < 𝛿< 90∘(or 𝜋/2).
Every model has both a physical mechanism and a mathematical solution. Some established LVE models, such
as Boltzmann superposition (Equation 23 in Table 5.18, where the “t-s” and “ds” terms are time derivatives from
Laplace transforms), are especially applicable in an industrial setting. Specifically, this LVE constitutive equation
leads to G′, G′′, and Tan𝛿graphs in terms of frequency (f), time (t), or temperature (T) for rheometric DMA (via, for
example, TA Instruments’ ARES G2) that are also suitable for reactive systems, such as thermosetting coatings.
In addition, Equation 21 in Table 5.18 determines the complex (or dynamic) viscosity denoted as 𝜂*, which is
applicable to reactive polymers; Equations 22 and 24 describe and relate the characteristic creep compliance J(t)
to 𝜂and the stress relaxation modulus G(t) to MWs, respectively. Notably, the Cox–Merz rule describes an empirical
relationship between the dynamic viscosity (𝜂*) plotted against frequency (𝜔) and the steady shear viscosity (𝜂s)
plotted against the shear rate ( ̇𝛾), which is observed to work with non-reactive polymer melts as 𝜂( ̇𝛾) ≡𝜂∗(𝜔), the
former 𝜂( ̇𝛾) = 𝜏/ ̇𝛾according to Equation 14a in Table 5.15 and the latter 𝜂*(𝜔) = G*/𝜔according to Equation
21, where ̇𝛾and 𝜔must be in 1/s and rad/sec, respectively. As long as the strain amplitude falls within the linear
region, also referred to as a small amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS) test, this valuable law enables a steady shear
flow to be conveniently obtained from a dynamic frequency sweep without wall slip and edge fracture corrections,
which are otherwise required during steady shear testing.
TTS (time and temperature superposition) is an experimental technique applicable to LVE materials with t- and
T-dependent properties, where lowering temperature has the same effect on VE properties as rising frequency (the
inverse of time). For such VE materials, temperature changes can be utilized to re-scale time, and vice versa, in
order to anticipate behaviors over time scales that are otherwise difficult or impossible to observe. In addition, TTS
can be used to extend the frequency beyond the limits of the instrument. From modulus or other dynamic response

perspectives, the profiles of E’ (G′)/E’’ (G′′) versus frequency (f) and the graphs of E’ (G′)/E’’ (G′′) versus tempera-
ture (T) are mirrored images. TTS is suited to non-reactive materials such as amorphous, non-modified polymers,
and thermo-rheological simple. In TTS operations, master curves can be constructed utilizing temperature shift

As far as polymer melts are concerned in practice, for example, in industrial manufacturing of epoxy resins
(refer to Debrief C in Chapter 1), the shear rates from 10 to 1,000 1/s are generally in the extended range with
oscillation and Cox–Merz (sequentially after the power law region that in turn follows the first Newtonian plateau),
which cover, for example, extrusion processing. The high-shear rate range of 1,000 to 1.0×105 1/s, which also
encompasses the region for the second Newtonian plateau, stays about the extended zone with TTS and Cox–Merz,
suited to processes such as blow and injection molding. Measuring the oscillatory shear is the most used method for
characterizing the linear VE properties of polymer melts and concentrated solutions. Still, for polymer melts, the
viscosity at zero shear is 𝜂0 = k*MW for low MWs with no entanglements and 𝜂0 = k*MW3.4, for MWs greater than
the critical MWc [33]. MWs affect viscosity at zero, low shear, or low frequency (f); however, viscosity behaviors at
high f are independent of MWs (thus TTS is applicable to obtain the extended f range). Moreover, a polymer with a
broad MWD exhibits non-Newtonian behaviors at low shear rates while maintaining the same 𝜂0 as a polymer with
a narrow MWD. Modulus G′ and G′′ curves are shifted to lower f with increasing MWs under a dynamic oscillatory
shear; a greater crossover modulus indicates a narrower MWD. In addition, an f sweep test can correlate modulus
data to tack or tackiness (per ASTM D2979 using 8 mm parallel plates) and peel performance of, for example,
adhesives (one single f sweep cannot cover the entire f range of interest, so TTS applies again). Particularly, smaller
variances or variations between G′ (tack modulus) at low f’s and G′ (peel modulus) at high f’s are indicative of
good tack and peel performance (refer to Figures 10.4a/10.6a in Chapter 10). The dynamic temperature ramp
test is the most used method for assessing adhesives, as it correlates performance to thermal crosslinking (e.g.,
an increase in G′ at high-temperature regions). In the case of hotmelt adhesives, a DMA technique employing a
heating and cooling cycle is useful for determining the operation temperature window based on the two crossovers
of the G′ and G′′ profiles, as similarly illustrated in Figure 5.21b.
In the case of NLVE (e.g., Wi > 1), the stress-strain relationship is no longer linear, and the Boltzmann superpo-
sition integral (Equation 23 in Table 5.18) is no longer applicable because material properties such as the shear
moduli (G′ and G′′) begin to exhibit deformation-dependent behaviors due to disentanglement and molecular
orientation at large deformations, which are more representative of processing flow in reality. Dynamic shear
tests are therefore referred to as large-amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS) rather than SAOS. In order to account
for nonlinearity, investigators incorporated nonlinear behaviors into the constitutive model equations for LVE.
Second-order fluid (S.O.F.) is the simplest nonlinear constitutive equation capable of modeling steady shear mate-
rials and uniaxial (i.e., net tensile stress) extensional viscosity (𝜂ue). If 𝛾and ̇𝛾are small enough, all fluids behave as
second-order, although there are no true S.O.F.’s. Upper-convected Maxwell and extensions, or the UCM model, is
also applicable to NLVE, along with a number of modifications, such as the Giesekus equations. Moreover, Lodge
Integral equations with the same behaviors as UCM’s and many other models are established to fit NLVE in a
variety of interesting applications. NLVE behaviors are also amplitude (A)-dependent depending on the applied
stress, of which process conditions are often transient and nonlinear due to large enough deformations. From the
standpoint of the Pipkin diagram, NLVE is allocated to a specific regime above the LVE zone when the De of VE
materials increases (i.e., in the direction of elasticity; refer to Figure 5.28) and A increases simultaneously. Typical
NLVE fluids include polymers at elevated temperatures that have melted.
In addition to shear-thickening and -thinning as described by a function of 𝜂( ̇𝛾, t) and the time (t)-dependent
modulus as described by G(t, 𝛾), normal shear N1 in a shear flow is another one of the four key rheological phe-
nomena (refer to Table 5.19), which is denoted by N1
+( ̇𝛾, t), indicating both strain rate and time dependence, and
the “+” represents transient. The first normal stress (N1 = T11−T22) is typically measured by angle cone-plate

rheometers in terms of 𝜏( ̇𝛾) and N1( ̇𝛾) at relatively low shear rates (0–50 1/s, for example), whereas parallel
plates (torsional flow) are typically used for measuring the normal stress difference or the second normal stress
(N2 = T22−T33). For ideal or perfect rubber, N2 = 0, but for real rubber and polymer liquids, N2 ≪N1 with an
opposite sign. It should be noted that capillary measurements cover a high-shear-rate range, providing viscosity
data that are complementary to those of cone-plate rheometers. Notwithstanding, the first and second normal
stresses are essentially NLVE properties [33]. A Weissenberg effect (i.e., rod rise) is intrinsically a result of a nor-
mal stress in a shear flow, as is the die swell phenomenon, which is an elastic recoil or recovery [33, 45] that
occurs when normal stress N1 exceeds shear stress 𝜏by an ever-increasing amount, such as in polymer or pow-
der coating extrusion. Polymer melts and concentrated polymer solutions behave like crosslinked rubber due to
disentanglement at short times and high strain rates. Hooke’s law at small strains and Neo-Hookean’s law at large
strains predict the normal stress N1 for solids but not for liquids. The fourth and final key rheological event is
extensional thickening (also known as nonlinear elongation flow, Table 5.19), where the extensional viscosity 𝜂ue
is equal to or greater than three times the shear stress viscosity 𝜂s, namely, 𝜂ue ≥3𝜂s, which is NLVE similar to a
normal stress. In a sense, an extensional flow and the normal stress in a shear flow are interrelated. Neo-Hookean’s
(Equation 15b: E = 3G) captures only the elasticity of solids, whereas LVE Maxwell’s and generalized Newtonian
fluids (Equation 14b: 𝜂ue = 3𝜂s) are applicable only to small deformations and purely viscous liquids; when the
Reynolds number (= 𝜌VD/𝜂) increases, so does the elasticity.
Extensional viscosity indicates a nonlinear elongation flow that is more sensitive than simple shear flows to poly-
mer chain entanglements. LCB (long-chain-branched) polymers, for instance, exhibit a strain-hardening effect
corresponding to a Trouton ratio of 𝜂E(t, ̇𝜖)/𝜂0 (t) > 3 (compared to the Trouton ratio = 3 for linear polymers or
𝜂E = 3𝜂). Numerous industrial flows involve uniaxial elongation or extension, and vice versa; examples include
fiber spinning, injection molding, extruding, film blowing, foam production, liquid paint spraying, inkjet print-
ing, WB roll coating, and paper calendaring, among others. As a result, measurements of extensional viscosity

5.2 Rheology
175
𝜂ue (or 𝜂E) can be used to predict processibility. It is difficult to evaluate extensional viscosity due to a number
of factors, including primarily surface tension, the restricted ability to manage large or substantial strains (i.e.,
big strains equal to very thin or narrow samples), the need to avoid shear stress, etc. Establishing constitutive
equations for extensional viscosity or flow is additionally challenging since parametrization requires steady-state
viscosity, which in turn necessitates extremely large Hencky strains (e.g., > 3). Practical measurements of exten-
sional viscosity are typically performed with INDEXERS, which compare differences between material responses
utilizing, for example, a FSER fiber spinning extensional rheometer for paints and coatings, a CaBER capillary
breakup extensional rheometer, etc., and/or rheometers, which impose a rheologically simple flow field and mea-
sure steady-state viscosity utilizing, for example, an SER TA with EVF Sentmanat extensional rheometer fixture,
Open Loop, etc.
Still considering concentrated polymer solutions and polymer melts with viscosity (𝜇), for example, greater
than 100 Pa-s, there are four parameters that govern linear and nonlinear rheology: m, 𝜏11 (tension–pulling), 𝜏22
(compression–squeezing), and ̇𝜖. In one aspect, LVE forecasts extensional rheology based on the stress growth
coefficient Pa-s versus time or strain. In a second aspect, the nonlinear stretching critical Wi = ̇𝜖𝜏R (i.e., the relax-
ation time of the chains or the Rouse time 𝜏R = Z2𝜏c versus the timescale of the flow 𝜏F = 1/ ̇𝜖, where Z ∝
3.4√
𝜏d∕𝜏c
while 𝜏d and 𝜏c are the crossover points from plot of G′/G′′ versus frequency in rad/s) is introduced; when Wi <
0.5, there is modest orientation but no stretching; when Wi > 0.5, there is substantial orientation and stretching.
As the extensional rate increases rapidly (large Wi), strain hardening happens (stretch rates: ̇𝜖≫1/𝜏d, ̇𝜖> 0.5/𝜏R).
Considering 𝜇< 100 Pa-s, it is recommended to abandon stress/viscosity and instead assess behavior/kinematics,
determine timescales, and measure critical strains for behavior [46–49]. Such an extensional viscosity is difficult
to measure (𝜏11−𝜏22 = F(t)/𝜋R(t)2−𝜎/R(t), where 𝜎= 0.072N/m, F(t) and R(t) are respectively the force and radius
at t) because surface tension (𝜎), in addition to gravity and inertia forces, is involved as 𝜏∝f(𝜎), so that the exten-
sional stress quickly becomes part of the instrument noise. It is acceptable to index or compare the behavior of
the material under uniaxial deformation. A very fast relaxation time 𝜆corresponds to extremely high extension
rates (i.e., Wi > 0.5); 𝜆is a linear VE parameter, whereas extensional is a nonlinear process requiring nonlinear
variables. Currently, INDEXERS is a method utilized to characterize the fluid relaxation time 𝜆. Considering elas-
tic dilute solutions (i.e., unentangled Boger fluids, which are elastic with constant viscosity) with 𝜇∼100 Pa-s,
a Newtonian viscosity in shear and a strain-hardening effect in extension are observed for them. The transition
from viscous to elastic behaviors is revealed by kinematics (i.e., about motion of objects without reference to force
source causing it). Boger fluids exhibit the critical axial strain breakup to a greater degree than Newtonian fluids
due to the former’s higher critical radial strains. As for elastic but extremely dilute solutions or Boger fluids with
𝜇∼1–4 mPa-s (or ∼0.001−0.004 Pa-s or ∼1−4 cPs), there are two methods for measuring their kinematics: constant
rate experiments and constant velocity experiments.
According to a recent viewpoint by McKinley [50], extensional viscosity is best viewed as a transient material
function that evolves from equilibrium to a steady state or breakup. Understanding the kinematics of deformation
imposed by the instrument and the dynamics of filament stretching evolution is crucial for extracting the true
functions of materials ranging from polymer melts to dilute polymer solutions. Specifically, at low shear rates,
applicable extensional rheometry [51] includes EVF (extensional viscosity fixture, a small sample size of 5–200 mg,
up to 250 ∘C) and SER (sentmanat extensional rheometer, a universal testing platform readily adopted onto tor-
sional rheometers) with a constant sample length (L) and the capacity to measure large 𝜆and 𝜂ue at high-shear
viscosity scales (104 Pa-s, for example). Still specifically, at high-shear rates, appropriate equipment includes the
microfluidic capillary rheometer (for strong shear-thinning specified by the Carreau-Yasuda model) by plotting vis-
cosity 𝜂(Pa-s) versus shear rate (1/s) [52] and the ARG2-cone (e.g., 4 mm, 2∘, truncation gap 54μm, Figure 5.23d)

3 ̇𝛾(1/s), where 𝜂E/3 = 𝜂0 + 2ηp

L2 (at ̇𝜖= ∞) [53].
In conclusion, extensional flows are understood as strong flows that lead to molecular deformation, microstruc-
tural alignment, and high tensile stresses (e.g., viscosity increases when increasing ̇𝜖or De = ̇𝜖𝜏s1, which is indica-
tive of the strain rate, or by the Henchy strain 𝜀H = ̇𝜖0t = ln(L(t)/L0), resulting in strain hardening and tension

thickening, such as in the real-world applications of blow-molding, extrusion, and coating. Dilute polymer solu-
tions exhibit pronounced strain hardening (De 4∼50), whereas concentrated solutions and polymer melts are much
less significant in terms of the transient Trouton ratio (< 2) [46]. In fact, phenomenological concepts such as the
Henchy rate, strain hardening, necking, and fracture encountered in extensional rheology are extremely analo-
gous to those in the nonlinear region of tensile and elongation tests on solid samples (Figure 5.22), which may
aid readers in understanding them physically. Still, when it comes to the interfacial rheology of non-reactive sys-
tems, surface tension (𝜎measured in mN/m) plays a crucial thermodynamic role in driving interfacial dynamics
and stability. Complex interfaces, generally 2D rather than 3D, are prevalent in oil recovery, biology, personal
care, and food industries, and they consist of two major types of surfaces, namely Gibbs monolayers (soluble
materials, such as fluid-fluid with surfactants) and Langmuir films (insoluble monolayers, such as fluid-air).
Readers are strongly encouraged to refer to one of Professor Fuller’s most recent lectures [54]. As far as paint-
ing and coating are concerned, typical shear rates of leveling due to surface tension or sagging/draining under
gravity (relevant only if DFT > 4 mils [55]) are between 0.01 and 0.10 1/s, with leveling being normally lower than
sagging.
Debrief D Major rheological phenomena
As previously stated, Table 5.19 lists four important rheological phenomena, including shear-thinning/-
thickening, time-dependent modulus, normal stress in shear, and extensional thickening, that is, functions of
𝜂+( ̇𝛾, t) (hereof + indicates transient), G(t, 𝛾), N1( ̇𝛾, t), and 𝜂ue ≥3𝜂s, respectively, where applicable, G.N.F.
means generalized Newtonian fluids. All constitutive models presented thus far are intended to account for these
non-reactive rheological events, including qualitative and quantitative LVE and NLVE properties.
Neo-Hookean describes normal stress in solids but not in liquids; LVE (linear viscoelasticity) Maxwell, of course,
defines LVE properties, excluding shear-thinning. LVE is an adequate approximation for the time-dependent
behaviors of polymers, metals, and ceramics at relatively low temperatures and under relatively low stress. Gen-
eralized Newtonian fluid (G.N.F.) models, which include the power law, explain steady flow and shear-thinning
but neither VE nor normal stress (i.e., N1 or N2) nor strong extensional thickening (i.e., 𝜂ue ≥3𝜂s) nor simply time
dependence. On a Pipkin diagram, the S.O.F. model within the NLVE′s scope has small De’s and is adjacent to the
right side of Newtonian liquids (refer to Figure 5.28). From the perspective of fluid mechanics, the flexibility and
rigidity of coatings are explained by the fact that high-MW polymers require large strains to stretch and orient,
whereas stiff particles orient rapidly at small strains.

Without being constrained by theory, non-reactive rheological materials are physically heterogeneous but chemi-
cally homogeneous. These substances with a wide range of rheological properties, including viscoelasticity (VE),
include, but are not limited to: i) structured fluids, such as low-viscosity liquids, creams/slurries/pastes, gels, and
soft solids; ii) polymers, such as polymer melts, solid polymers, and concentrated solutions; iii) emulsions, that
is, fluids in fluids; iv) suspensions, that is, solid particles in a Newtonian fluid; and v) foam, that is, gas in a fluid
or solid, as specified in Table 5.20, combined with characterization-appropriate rheometric settings.

5 Cure Kinetics and Rheology
Non-Newtonian (nonlinear) behaviors, yield stress, thixotropy, and viscoelasticity, among others, are important
rheological features of structured fluids. For example, orange juice has a very low yield and literally stabilizes itself
without phase separation. Yields are time dependent and are quantitatively determined using a stress ramp, stress
sweep, stress rate ramp, or dynamic stress/strain sweep on a rotational rheometer. Shear thinning is essentially a
response to shear-induced structural destruction. Thixotropy is also time dependent, and can be measured using
rotational rheometers according to a few protocols, such as (i) stepped flows of viscosity versus time consisting of
low shear at 0.1 1/s first, high shear at 10 1/s next, and low shear at 0.1 1/s last (refer to Figure 5.21a); (ii) stepped
dynamic; (iii) stress ramp up and down to measure loop stress versus the shear rate; and (iv) a dynamic time
sweep after a pre-shear method determining G′/G′′ versus t for structure recovery time.
Complex fluids, including a wide range of emulsions (soft particles dispersed) and suspensions (hard parti-
cles colloidal), are typically viscoelastic (VE). Brownian dynamics properly explains the rheology of suspensions,
including zero shear viscosity, non-Newtonian shear-thinning/-thickening, and VE [57]. Many dispersions exhibit
solid-like behaviors under oscillation. When it comes to elasticity characterization, oscillation tests, such as fre-
quency sweep (the most common), creep recovery, and normal stress (N1) measurement, are still commonly used.
As for polymer systems, a suitable geometry for preventing edge fracture due to normal forces is a cone-divided
plate. Dynamic oscillation is ideal for polymers, such as a time sweep to determine degradation or stability, a
strain sweep to find LVR (linear viscoelastic region), a frequency sweep to correlate G′, G′′, Tan𝛿, and 𝜂* (versus
frequency 𝜔) to MWs and MWD, and a temperature ramp/temperature step to identify transitions and end per-
formance, to name a few. Flow/steady shear also quantifies viscosity in terms of shear rates, allowing polymer
processing to be simulated, zero shear viscosity to be detected, and low shear information to be obtained. In gel
polymers, the elastic modulus (G′) represents the network strength.
Notably, all rotational geometries, such as couette and those illustrated in Figures 5.23a/b/c/d, can exhibit or
generate a secondary order flow (also known as inertia). Viscous effects are never significant compared to inertia,
capillary forces, and elastic effects in the pinch region of drop formation for dilute polymer solutions with low
viscosity [58]. Last but not least, VE capillary thinning and filament breakup of complex fluids is an important
dynamic process with commercial impacts (such as jet atomization by referring to Figure 5.23f, paint dispens-
ing, nozzle spraying, etc.) involving fluid dynamics and transient extensional flow behaviors driven by capillarity
and resisted by inertia, as reviewed in detail by McKinley [59]. Specifically, for pure Newtonian fluids, Rmid(t)

5.2.2
Rheology of reactive systems
In most cases, if not all, the rheological behaviors of reactive systems, such as thermosetting polymers, including
epoxy coatings and adhesives, are complicated by both chemical reactions (multi-functional crosslinking and/or
di-functional polymerization) and thermal discrepancies. Consequently, both the viscosity and modulus develop-
ments of a formulation are dynamic functions of temperature (T), time (t), and the conversion (𝛼), also known as
the extent or degree of cure in percentage (%), which is governed by cure kinetics (refer to Section 5.1). Note that
such reactive systems, including polymer gels, are physically homogeneous but chemically heterogeneous upon
complete mixing prior to application and never attain a steady state until full cure or polymerization completion
unless quenching is applied. Gelation or the gel point (Tgel, tgel, and 𝛼gel), minimum dynamic viscosity (𝜂*min),
and vitrification, among others (e.g., G′, G′′, Tan𝛿, ̇𝛼max), are the most important phenomena or rheological
parameters when it comes to the rheology of curable polymers or materials comprised of reactive ingredients or
constituent mixtures.
First is chemical gelation, or the gel point at which an immobile network (macromolecular cluster) is developed
with infinite viscosity, that is, 𝜂∼(𝛼gel −𝛼)−s, and zero equilibrium modulus, that is, Ggel∼(𝛼−𝛼gel)−z, transitioning
from an uncured liquid to a cured rubbery state (also known as a “sol-gel transition”), where nc in Equation 25
(Table 5.21) equals z/(z + s) and the factors z and s are predicted from theory [63, 64]. In other words, gelation is
an active and crucial point that distinguishes a VE liquid (before) from a VE solid (after). In addition, the wetting

5 Cure Kinetics and Rheology
properties of a reactive liquid encourage adhesion as the viscous modulus (G′′) dominates prior to the gel point;
after gelation, cohesive strength leads as the elastic modulus (G′) of a solid predominates in reverse. In a sense, and
in retrospect, the rheology of non-reactive fluids is more similar to rheological phenomena, including viscoelas-
ticity, up to the gel point of reactive fluids. Dynamic oscillation (e.g., temperature ramp, Table 5.21) at a constant
frequency 𝜔(e.g., 6.28 rad/s) and a small strain 𝛾or 𝜀(e.g., 0.05%) is the most suitable method for studying the
rheology of crosslinking polymer systems; consequently, concepts, constitutive relationships, and rheometric set-
tings for LVE behaviors as outlined in Table 5.18 remain valid for reactive systems, including, for example, reactive
liquid and powder coatings.
Because steady-state measurements are challenging, DMA employing oscillatory shear rheology is commonly
used to concurrently determine the gel point [65] and 𝜂*min of a particular reactive system. Concerning the gel
point, stress relaxation at gelation follows a power law behavior [66, 67]; therefore, Equation 25 in Table 5.21
holds, where S = stiffness (or rigidity or gel strength—resistance to deformation) and nc = relaxation exponent
(0 < nc < 1) for crosslinking gels if 𝜆0, chem ≤t ≤∞(infinite sample or time to relax). Winter−Chambon gelation
(Equation 26) is derived by combining the general constitutive LVE model (i.e., the strain 𝛾is small enough that
G = G′ + iG′′ is independent of 𝛾, Equation 23a) and the power law of gelation modulus (i.e., Equation 25).
Thus, if nc = 0.5 (i.e., G′ = G′′ or slope-equal), the frequency-independent Tan(𝛿c) = 1, indicating that both moduli
are identical and proportional to
√
𝜔[68], further indicating that the crossover of G′ and G′′ is close to the gel
point [69, 70]. However, as cautioned by Winter [63], the critical gelation detection by the G′ and G′′ crossover is
only valid for nc = 0.5 (nc ≈0.70 for epoxies), and only a limited variety of polymers match such conditions of a
stoichiometric balance, an excess of crosslinkers, at temperatures well above Tg, etc.; otherwise, the intersection
does not represent the actual liquid-to-solid transition and gives only a rough estimation. For applied epoxies that
consume all reactive monomers or resins to complete crosslinking, however, these preconditions are rarely met.
For example, epoxy systems are more sensibly formulated with imbalanced stoichiometric ratios and crosslinker
deficiency (or even in the absence of crosslinkers) because epoxy readily self-crosslinks upon initiation by anionic
(e.g., tertiary amines) or cationic (onium salts) catalysts, as discussed in Chapter 3. Since thermosetting poly-
mers coated on substrates, with the exception of low-cure 2K’s, are practically subject to a dynamic or isothermal
oven cure at temperatures sometimes exceeding 200–240 ∘C (e.g., for oil and gas pipeline and rebar) and a full Tg
(typically 120 ∘C or under, except formulations of super high Tg greater than 200 ∘C) is not established until cure
completion (i.e., complete conversion) or upon vitrification (e.g., quenching), a prerequisite of cure temperatures
well above Tg is perhaps always true. Multi-wave oscillation, or imposing multiple f’s simultaneously to plot a
series of Tan𝛿versus time (the inverse of frequency), enables the Tan𝛿crossover to be identified as the actual gel
point or the instant of gelation [65]. In fact, and in practice, the detection of gelation by the intersection of G′ and
G′′ is a reasonable estimation for competitive characterization of many crosslinking polymers, including a variety
of epoxy coatings that are tailor-formulated to have a wide range of gel, cure, and Tg capacities. Table 5.21 also
includes shear rheometric methods and settings for characterizing reactive systems.
In the meantime, chemical gelation is cure- or specifically conversion (𝛼)-driven, irreversible (non-ergodic,
non-reproducibly the same), f-independent, and compliant with the iso-conversion principle [71], which states
that chemical gelling occurs only at a certain extent of conversion (𝛼) regardless of cure temperatures applied.
In other words, gelation of, for instance, a particular epoxy coating does not take place until its intrinsic 𝛼gel,
which is formulation dependent, is attained, independent of cure temperature; of course, it gels faster at higher
temperatures than at lower temperatures. Gelation determines the upper limit of the pot or work life of a reac-
tive system from a processing standpoint; too rapid gelation may cause undesired molecular gridlocks before all
reactive groups crosslink.
The minimal dynamic (or complex) viscosity denoted as 𝜂*min is another parameter of significance. The gel
point nearly invariably occurs after 𝜂*min, forming a unique rheological region from 𝜂*min to gelation for virtually
all reactive systems, including flash-cure coatings. Prior to 𝜂*min, it is all about the liquid’s viscous properties;
between 𝜂*min and gelation, it resembles an elastic liquid, although viscous modulus (G′′) continues to dominate

but tends to decrease with altitude, indicating that G′′ and elastic modulus (G′) co-dominate in this area, which
may be narrow or broad depending on formulation and temperature. Retrospectively, the rheology of non-reactive
fluids appears to be more concerned with rheological behaviors prior to the location of 𝜂*min than in reactive
liquids. When properly formulated, the 𝜂*min of a coating or paint is utilized to provide excellent adhesion due to
plenty of leveling and surface wetting of substrates while preventing undesirable sagging at an intended DFT.
The third essential parameter is vitrification, or the transition from a rubbery to a glassy state, which can occur
at any moment or not at all depending on the actual processing, application, and curing schedules. Cure reac-
tions of a crosslinking polymer or system slow down, momentarily freeze, or stop entirely at vitrification, which is
f-dependent and reversible but occurs only if the actual cure temperature (Tcure) is lower than the already estab-
lished Tg. Temperature is the driving force behind vitrification; cold water quenching, which is commonly seen in
the coatings industry, is essentially vitrification to eliminate any remaining cure or crosslinking. Being B-staged
is a literal state of persistent vitrification that is utilized for storage and transport. High-Tg formulations are more
likely to vitrify during thermal curing due to the fact that Tg can develop rapidly close to or slightly above Tcure.
In such instances, vitrification is undesirable and should be avoided by increasing Tcure (by at least 5–10 ∘C above
the formulated Tg potential, for example) in order to de-vitrify as effectively as possible for adequate cure. At or
near vitrification, crosslinking reaction rates decelerate significantly, resulting in poor conversion as the system
transitions from a chemically controlled phase (close to a first order) to a diffusion-controlled phase (at least above
a first order), in which monomer or reactant concentrations play a secondary role in driving continuous cure reac-
tions. In a sense, a rapid and uniform heating rate is desired to prevent not only unfavorable side reactions but
also vitrification (i.e., aid in de-vitrification) during curing.
Gelation, 𝜂*min, the formation of a crosslinked network, vitrification, and glass transition near Tg are all aspects
of the material dynamics of reactive coatings and similar materials subjected to heat-induced crosslinking. During
curing, some thermosets shrink more than others; thermosetting shrinkage can be gauged by (i) maintaining
a constant plate gap and measuring the shrinking force (a normal force) in Newton’s (N), and (ii) setting the
axial force to zero and measuring the dimension (gap) change in micrometers (μm). As one of the convenient
user-defined parameters for analyzing rheometric DMA data by TRIOS, flow index = frequency/G* (where G*
denotes the complex modulus) in 1/Pa allows comparisons of substrate wetting (in a molecular-level contact) and
thus adhesion potential for a specific or a group of formulation(s), particularly when combined with 𝜂*min and
surface tension at a given DFT.
When evaluating rheology, the leveling and sagging properties of reactive coating materials prior to gela-
tion should be maximized and minimized/eliminated, respectively. According to the Orchard equation of
a = a0 exp
(
−16𝜋4h3𝜎t

)
[73], leveling is a function of both surface tension (with a positive effect) and viscosity (with
a negative effect), where 𝜎and 𝜂are the surface tension in mN/m and viscosity in Pa-s of the fluid, respectively,
as depicted in Figure 5.24a. In general, a maximum surface tension induces maximum flow and leveling, but

minimum substrate surface wetting [55]. In one aspect, a high-surface tension of coatings promotes coalescence
(i.e., a low-surface tension impedes leveling) but it adversely affects substrate wetting (or leads to poor wetting),
creating a surface tension conundrum. In another aspect, low melting viscosity, for example, in thermosetting
powder coatings, enhances leveling and wetting, although it might lead to undesirable sagging (Figure 5.24b).
Consequently, viscosity is the essential driving factor for wetting and leveling, ultimately promoting adhesion.
Still, the initial low viscosity, which achieves its minimum at 𝜂*min (showing good flow), should be monitored
and optimized according to formulation design in order to facilitate wetting and leveling at the desired DFT
without sagging. For flow and leveling management, the selection of bulk resins in a crosslinking formulation is
the most important aspect, followed by the selection of catalysts and crosslinkers (refer to relevant case studies
in Chapter 6). In addition, common wet flow agents such as acrylic polymers, Type A, that decrease the surface
tension 𝜎, promote flow uniformity for the elimination of orange peels at a typical loading level of 0.5−1.5% of
the total formulation. Type B flow agents are analogous to alcohols in that they decrease the contact angle 𝜃(an
inverse measure of wettability) or increase cos 𝜃; epoxy resins and coatings with both types of additives result in
good flow and wetting.
Figures 5.25/5.26 present complete rheological charts for two applied epoxy powder coatings developed, respec-
tively, for rebar (generic Tg) and ID (inner diameter) drill pipe (high-Tg) applications, that is, long-term corrosion
protection of steel substrates. DMA was performed on both FBE coating samples using an ARES G2 rheometer
with a dynamic temperature ramp at 𝛽= 7.0 ∘C/min from 70 to 220 ∘C or 250 ∘C (depending on Tg, which was
determined by DSC ahead of time), a constant strain at 𝛾= 0.05%, and a fixed frequency at f = 1.0 Hz. A 0.30-gram
sample each was compressed into a two-millimeter-tall pill, which was then loaded onto parallel plates with a
13-millimeter (mm) diameter (initial and final gaps were 10 mm and 1 mm, respectively).
For the formulation with a generic Tg of less than 120 ∘C (i.e., FBE-O3 of 104.4 ∘C, Figure 5.25), first of all, the
dynamic viscosity 𝜂* and storage modulus G′ consistently followed each other in their trending profiles over the
entire temperature range examined, with the exception of slight variations observed during the melting stage. This
is due to the correlation between these two variables by a scalar term of the relaxation time, 𝜆= 𝜂/G. The FBE-O3

formulation clearly displayed 𝜂*min at 118.0 ∘C and gelation at roughly 129.6 ∘C (i.e., the crossover of G′ and G′′)
when subjected to a heating rate of 7.0 ∘C/min. These quantifications, together with other annotations in the chart,
provide insights into this particular formulation; for example, gelation (the gel point) occurred approximately
2 min after 𝜂*min and not the other way around. As outlined in Figure 5.25, the melting and curing of FBE-O3 under
heat progressed from a B-staged solid at around 75 ∘C to a VE liquid intermediate at approximately 100∼130 ∘C
to a VE solid at 130 ∘C perhaps 140 ∘C or 150 ∘C to a completely cured solid at 160 ∘C and higher. Specifically, the
coating underwent a quick transition from a VE liquid to an elastic solid surrounding the gel point at approximately
129.6 ∘C that separated them. Throughout the softening and flowing stage, which reached a minimum value at
𝜂*min and concluded with gelation, G′′ was consistently greater than G′, indicating that the system was very viscous
but elastic. G′′ remained lower than G′ after gelation and throughout, suggesting an inversed elastic dominance.
Gelation does not appear to be a point at which 𝜂*max concurrently occurs; rather, the gel point relates to the
incipient of crosslinked cluster formation, whereas 𝜂*max corresponds to a complete cure. Notably, 𝜂*min, G′
min,
and G′′
min took place at around the same time or temperature of 118.0 ∘C. Signals of vitrification were not observed,
or diffusion control was absent or too weak to detect, at a heating rate of 7.0 ∘C/min (fast enough to maintain Tcure
above any instant Tg) for a generic Tg formulation of this type.
On the other hand, high-Tg (e.g., greater than 200 ∘C but less than 250 ∘C) epoxy formulations exhibit remark-
ably different rheological behaviors in terms of gelation, flow (including 𝜂*min), vitrification and de-vitrification,
and Tg indications compared to their generic counterparts. Figure 5.26 illustrates the DMA rheology for TG208
(a fluorene-epoxy formulation with Tg = 208 ∘C as determined by DSC, as labeled; refer to relevant sections in
Chapter 6), which is characteristic of such applied epoxy coatings. Full rheological data for TG208 in Figure 5.26a
include profiles of G′, G′′, Tan𝛿, 𝜂* in terms of temperature as well as the flow index (a user-defined variable) on
a separate time scale. The occurrence of 𝜂*min, G′
min, and G′′
min for TG208 invariably at 135.7 ∘C confirms that
viscosity and modulus consistently follow one another. Rheologically, gelation, or the gel point, was no longer
a distinct point but rather a broad intersection of G′ and G′′ interactions; hence, a nominal Tgel of 173.7 ∘C was
reported. As the half-height line traverses the gel point from around 70 to 173.7 ∘C (the gel point), a broad flow
window is observed, indicative of a wide-open pot life; 𝜂*min is as low as 48.3 Pa-s, and the flow index (i.e., the
area under the curve) is as high as 4.78 1/Pa, showing enormous flow and a great deal of wetting in favor of adhe-
sion development prior to gelation. However, TG208 was found to resist sagging up to 20 mil DFT during testing.
Diverged (or oscillating) dual peaks as signals appearing on G′′ and Tan𝛿at 184.4 ∘C are indicative of vitrification

occurring before the final Tg of 208.1 ∘C, which is closely indicated by the onset of 𝜂*, G′, and G′′ at 207.3 ∘C as
marked (as is the onset of the last Tan𝛿peak at 213.5 ∘C with a slight overestimation). The section of the rhe-
ological profiles following the maximal modulus (G′
max) at roughly 200 ∘C is essentially equivalent to curd film
DMA on solid samples. High-Tg epoxy formulations, such as TG208, typically encounter a spike in viscosity and
moduli immediately after 𝜂*min until Tgel and beyond, implying that these coatings gel and cure very quickly upon
thermal activation; TG208 was actually measured to gel in 14.1 sec at 204 ∘C on a hot plate. The effect of heating
rates on vitrification and de-vitrification is depicted in Figure 5.26b, in which TG208 samples were heated at 𝛽=
4.0 (A: blue), 7.0 (B: green), and 10.0 ∘C/min (C: red), respectively. Notably, a slower 𝛽= 4.0 ∘C/min appeared to
cause the double peaks of G′′ and Tan𝛿to diverge more sharply while occurring at a lower temperature or a wider
range, that is, 169.0 to 210 ∘C for G′′ and 146.0 to 215 ∘C for Tan𝛿, as opposed to 183.0 to 206.0 ∘C for G′′ and 153.0
to 214.0 ∘C for Tan𝛿at 𝛽= 7.0 ∘C/min. In contrast, a faster 𝛽= 10.0 ∘C/min greatly reduced the dual G′′ and Tan𝛿
peaks while pushing them to a higher temperature range (195.0 to 200 ∘C for G′′ and 157.0 to 209.0 ∘C for Tan𝛿).
In addition, a faster 𝛽minimizes thermal gradients, enlarges the flow window, increases Tgel, and decreases 𝜂*min
while increasing the temperature at 𝜂*min, which is equivalent to the effect of lower catalyst loading levels in for-
mulation. As a result, as fast 𝛽’s as feasible are preferable to encourage flow and minimize vitrification, as long as
sagging or overflow is not a concern; in practice, this entails application of the highest possible cure temperature,
particularly for formulations with a high Tg.
How epoxy formulations with Tg between 120 and 200 ∘C respond rheologically in terms of 𝜂*min, gelation,
and vitrification is dependent on formulation parameters, particularly the FI and applied catalyst(s). When Tg is
at the lower or higher end of this medium range, respectively, it may be more similar to the generic or high-Tg
formulations discussed. On the other hand, it is true that vitrification precludes Tg values from being greater than
Tcure values for epoxy systems that are chemically heterogeneous. This rule applies equally to liquid coatings; for
example, the 2K liquid epoxy coating shown in Table 5.13 was cured at ambient temperature (i.e., Tcure ∼20 ∘C)
as recommended, but it ended up with a Tg of 62.4 ∘C because it was highly exothermic (𝛥H = −98.8 J/g) and
generated so much heat as to keep the real Tcure significantly higher than the final Tg. However, this decree is
no longer valid for purely homogeneous polymers, such as phthalonitrile, which self-crosslinks and is capable
of developing a Tg as high as 344.4 ∘C, squarely exceeding a Tcure of 250–300 ∘C that it was subjected to in a DSC
study, a situational case of Tg > Tcure (i.e., no concern for vitrification) that will be discussed in Subsection 9.3.1 of
Chapter 9.
Debrief F Rheological DMA
Other than critical events of gelation, 𝜂*min, and vitrification (if any) in the curing process of reactive systems,
secondary variables and parameters generated or retrieved from dynamic oscillatory DMA are highly support-
ive of a comprehensive understanding of rheological measurement settings, relevant concepts, and correlations.
Figures 5.27a/b depict such cases for FBE-O3 and TG208, respectively. Specifically, for generic Tg formulations
such as FBE-O3, as exhibited in Figure 5.27a, the strain and strain rate were held constant at 2.0% and 0.125 1/s
when FBE-O3 coating samples were run, as was the frequency at 1.00 Hz or 6.28 rad/s. The phase angle (𝛿) matched
the loss tangent in terms of the trend and pattern over time, as expected: initially, it was high around 80∘to 50∘and
peaked at 113.2 ∘C (i.e., Tan𝛿max) ahead of 𝜂*min, indicating a most viscous liquid, then it dropped throughout the
gel point as cure progressed, and finally it leveled off at ∼4∘, indicating a most elastic solid when cure completed.
As also anticipated, the normal stress N1 was zero under these dynamic oscillatory measurements. The profile of
the complex compliance J* (i.e., 1/G*) turned out to be the inverse of modulus from melting at ∼84.0 ∘C to near full
cure at 150–160 ∘C with a maximum at 118.0 ∘C (i.e., 𝜂*min). Except for the phase angle and complex compliance,
the heating rate 𝛽is not expected to impact any of these variants.
Similarly, for high-Tg formulations such as TG208, as depicted in Figure 5.27b, the angular frequency (𝜔)
remained unchanged at 6.28 rad/s, so did the normal stress N1 = 0 and the phase angle (𝛿), which strictly followed

the respective profile of Tan𝛿and exhibited similar peak signals of vitrification for this high-Tg formulation.
Differently, the strain starting at 2% was set up in a stepped manner so that it changed in response to modulus
variations from the uncured liquid (more deformable and subject to larger strains) to the cured solid (much less
deformable and subject to smaller strains); as a result, the strain rate changed in steps. Moreover, the complex
compliance or the inverse of complex modulus for TG208 was observed to vary in a manner similar to that of
FBE-O3, a generic Tg formulation with faster gel and cure but with a significantly larger amplitude.
Recaps and Highlights (II)
Everything flows, and all actual substances, liquids and solids, are viscoelastic in some sense. Viscosity is to
liquids as modulus is to solids. Viscous properties define adhesion to substrates and process performance (pro-
cessing window or pot life), whereas elasticity determines cohesion and product performance, attributable to
structure-property relationships fundamentally driven by microstructures in the case of non-reactive fluids or
formulations in the case of reactive systems.
Regardless of non-reactive and reactive fluids, understanding rheology is almost impossible without principal
Newton’s and Hooke’s laws and the related constitutive equations that define the viscosity of Newtonian or viscous
liquids (i.e., 𝜂= 𝜏/ ̇𝛾) associated also with De = 0 (i.e., steady state) and the modulus of elastic solids (i.e., G = 𝜏/𝛾)
associated also with De = ∞, which, respectively, define the lower and upper limits of all rheological phenom-
ena, including viscoelasticity (VE), as depicted in Figure 5.28. Specific to t-dependent VE materials, liquids and
solids, the dimensionless De = 𝜆/tp = 𝜆𝜔(where tp is the process time) typically ranges from 0.1 for a low rate of
deformation to 10 for a high rate of deformation. In accordance with a Pipkin map (Figure 5.28), De < 1 represents
viscous flow behaviors that are able to respond to deformation easily, whereas De > 1 represents elastic behaviors
ascribed to internal structures that reach the NLVE (i.e., nonlinear VE) region more rapidly as the strain amplitude
(A or 𝛾0) increases. Wi = 𝜆𝛾0, which is analogous to De, defines fluid nonlinearity of a rheological response rather
than flow unsteadiness. In addition, the Maxwell and Kelvin–Voigt models describe how LVE liquids undergo
a stress relaxation test (i.e., ̇𝜖= 0) and LVE solids undergo a creep recovery or stress retardation test, in which
𝜏0 is sustained until at t1, to reach a steady state over a longer period of time, respectively. LVE stress responses
to strains are described by the constitutive equation (1D) of 𝜏(t)=∫∞
0 G(s) ̇𝛾(t −s)ds as captured by a Boltzmann
superposition (also known as WLF). Under a dynamic test commonly used in oscillation to investigate the short
time range of steady-state responses, VE materials always exhibit viscous and elastic components dynamically,

a Newtonian liquid (strictly viscous) and a Hookean solid (strictly elastic), the lower and upper boundaries of VE
rheology, respectively.
The rheology of non-reactive and non-Newtonian fluids is primarily concerned with explaining ̇𝛾- and/or
t-dependent flow and viscosity properties from practical processing viewpoints, such as yield stress (𝜏y), shear
thickening (dilatant and rheopectic), shear thinning (pseudoplastic and thixotropy), viscoelasticity, and so on.
Specifically, it should be able to address four key rheological phenomena and a wide range of materials with
t- and A-dependency (LVE for small and NLVE for large deformations, Figure 5.28). These major rheological
phenomena are transient shear thickening/thinning per 𝜂+( ̇𝛾, t), t-dependent modulus per G(t, 𝛾), normal stress
in shear per N1( ̇𝛾, t), and extensional flow and viscosity per 𝜂ue ≥3𝜂s; meanwhile, diverse substances of interest
include, but are not limited to, structured fluids (such as low-viscosity liquids, creams/slurries/pastes, gels, and
soft solids), polymers (polymer melts, solid polymers, and concentrated solutions), emulsions, suspensions, and
foams. More specifically, the power law of 𝜂( ̇𝛾) = k(T) ̇𝛾n−1 and the Bingham’s of 𝜏= 𝜏y + 𝜂B ̇𝛾are representative of
an array of generalized constitutive equations best modeling generic non-Newtonian and yield stress fluids within
LVE, respectively, whereas S.O.F. is representative of others for conditionally describing those four significant
phenomena within NLVE but restricted to small De’s adjacent to zero (i.e., Newtonian’s). Comparatively and
positionally symmetric to S.O.F., Neo-Hookean’s equation of E = 3G indicates VE solids adjacent to the upper
limit of De = ∞, as seen in Figure 5.28. Still more specifically, an extensional flow (e.g., die swell of an elastic
recovery effect) is a processing flow containing normal stress in shear, difficult to measure due to transiency and
interfacial surface tension being involved, and typically modeled in an empirical manner heavily dependent on
both the prominent nature of fluids (e.g., Newtonian, VE, MWs, entanglements, concentrations, temperature,
etc.) and custom rheometric settings.
The most important rheological characteristics and parameters to consider for reactive systems are gelation (esti-
mated by the intersection of G′ and G′′), minimum viscosity (𝜂*min), and vitrification (if any when Tcure ≤Tg). For
reactive polymers of homogeneity or reactive coatings of heterogeneity, G′′ > G′ in the early stage of curing indi-
cates that the VE liquid is very viscous but still elastic, and G′′ < G′ in the late stage of curing indicates that the VE
solid becomes very elastic and still viscous; G′′ = G′ or the modulus crossover represents the gel point, where Tan𝛿
= 1 (i.e., 𝛿= 45∘), the most important rheological event that is driven by chemical crosslinking, is t-independent,
and irreversibly separates domination of liquid viscosity from domination of solid elasticity. Compared to those
with a generic Tg, epoxy formulations with a high Tg exhibit unique rheological responses, such as vitrification
and others to be discussed in the following section.

5.3 Kinetics and Rheology Combined

5.3
Kinetics and Rheology Combined
In a logical sense, rheology and kinetics are two essential characteristics of polymer coatings and paints that can
cure. In one aspect, DMA rheology quantitatively characterizes gelation, 𝜂*min, and vitrification events during
cure but not the extent or degree of cure (𝛼) or the cure rate ( ̇𝛼) directly. In the other aspect, DSC kinetics numer-
ically reveals cure pathways using the exothermic curve (disclosing kinetic parameters of A, Ea, m, and n), 𝛼, ̇𝛼,
the peak temperature (Tpeak), and the glass transition temperature (Tg), but not the gel point or the associated
flow and viscosity changes, or vitrification directly. When applied kinetics and rheology are unified by measuring
DSC and DMA at the same heating rate (𝛽), a complete and thorough thermal characterization of most reactive
polymer coatings is robustly established for capturing all important variables simultaneously to better elucidate
process and product performance as well as structure-property relationships [74], and beyond, for instance, to aid
in formulation improvement and optimization.
Before moving on to illustrative data analyses for such rheo-kinetic jointed characterization of applied formu-
lations, it is worthwhile to review and acknowledge a great deal of prior efforts ever made in this regard [75–80],
using cone-plate viscometers or parallel-plate rheometers in order to provide guidance for, for example, processing
epoxy prepregs and coatings. Note that these empirical equations were mostly obtained from isothermal (i.e., T =
constant and 𝛥T = 0) conditions and subsequently extended to dynamic (non-isothermal) cure settings that are
more relevant in practice. Considering a polymer melt devoid of curing agents and assuming a first-order reaction
(i.e., d𝛼
dt = k𝜂⋅(1 −𝛼), thus
1
1−𝛼= e∫t
0 k𝜂dt) [76], the melt viscosity 𝜂is a function of 𝜂0(T, 𝛼) in Pa-s and the viscosity
increase rate constant is k𝜂(T) in 1/s, that is, defined in an Arrhenius form but without a negative sign, or in a
logarithm coordinate (Equation 27) in that 𝜂0 and k𝜂are also expressed in Arrhenius forms (Equations 27a/b),
which constitutes a dual Arrhenius viscosity model.
Equation 27:
𝜂(T, t) = 𝜂0ek𝜂tor ln(𝜂(T, t)) = ln(𝜂0) + k𝜂t
Equation 27a:
𝜂0 = 𝜂∞exp

Equation 27b:
k𝜂= k∞exp

where 𝜂∞is the zero-time viscosity at temperature T = ∞, E𝜂is the effective activation energy of viscous flow,
R is the gas constant, k∞and Ek are analogs of 𝜂∞and E𝜂, respectively. k𝜂of the four parameters (i.e., 𝜂∞, E𝜂,
k∞, and Ek) in Equation 27 can be related to tgel by k𝜂∼
1
tgel [81], which indicates that 1/tgel versus k𝜂is a linear
relationship (refer to Equation 3). In addition, both 𝜂0 and k𝜂in Equation 27 are readily obtained by plotting 𝜂
against t prior to gelation measured at multiple isothermal temperatures (i.e., T = constant 1, constant 2, etc.). Note
that Equation 27 no longer describes viscosity changes when approaching or reaching the gel point. Analytically,
substituting Equations 27a/b into Equation 27 yields:

where 𝜙is a proportionality factor introduced for model modification that corresponds to the number of
chain entanglements. In fact, a first-order assumption before gelation is quite reasonable since concentrations
of reactants (such as epoxies and crosslinkers) are abundant in the system prior to gelation, which causes
immobilization. In addition, if we examine an nth-order reaction (i.e., n ≠1), then d𝛼

where n is determined by the slope of the ln( 𝛥H

theless, it was assumed that 𝜂*min is close to the gel point, which is literally only true for limited systems such as
fast-cure 2K liquid epoxies. Still, k∞and Ek in Equation 29 are computed individually using linear regressions
[80]. An equation in the form of 𝜂= (f•k•t)n, where f represents the functionality of resins and n is a constant,
is also proposed [82] to arbitrarily create two or three discontinuous sections of linearity prior to gelation, which
correspond to specific structural transformations at, for example, n = 1, 1 < n < 3.5, and 3.5 < n < 4.5, respectively.
Obviously, each of these models has its own limitations, preventing their use in a variety of circumstances. For
example, the author attempted to apply Equations 27/27a to FBE-O3 (Figure 5.25) and TG208 (Figure 5.26a) in

that made sense. In other words, it is rather challenging to define the pertinent parameters of 𝜂∞, E𝜂, k∞, and Ek
independently and correctly, despite the fact that DSC kinetic data are also utilized to determine 𝛼’s at the onset of
cure, 𝜂*min, the gel point, etc. Ideal models should consist of two expressions capable of fitting real-world dynamic
𝜂* data from the onset of cure to 𝜂*min and separately from 𝜂*min to gelation. Notably, the shape and the slope of
practical viscosity profiles for non-homogeneous systems where resins, catalysts, flow agents, rheology modifiers,
and fillers all play a role are more complicated than anticipated.
A sensible combination of rheological DMA and kinetic DSC is highly effective for describing the curing mecha-
nisms of epoxy systems, including functional epoxy powder coatings, or FBEs, in their entirety. Back to the FBE-O3
(i.e., with a generic Tg of 104.4 ∘C) and TG208 (i.e., with a high Tg of 208.1 ∘C) formulations from the preceding, an
in-depth discussion is provided on each of them, including compositional formulations as disclosed in Table 5.22.
Let’s begin with a basic anatomy of the formulas. FBE-O3 was preliminarily formulated with an amine chemistry

to maximize flexibility while having fast gel and cure (as indicated by the relatively small reaction orders m = 0.40
and n = 0.90, Figure 5.29) for applications such as rebar [83], so it was dominated by a high-MW Type 7 epoxy
resin (i.e., YD-017) that was toughened and unfilled. At 1.046, the FI for FBE-O3, was not optimized but rather
situational. The TG208 formula, on the other hand, was designed to have a high Tg, toughness, adhesion, and
adequate flexibility (e.g., > 2.0∘/PD or pipe diameter) for ID drill pipe applications [84], so it employed SE-250
(a fluorene-epoxy monomer) with massive flow upon melting at temperatures as low as 65.0∼92.0 ∘C. That is
also why a viscosity thickener (optionally fumed silica or organic clay) was incorporated to avoid sagging; CaO
fillers are an example of selective water absorbers. TG208 is characterized by a high Tg, a low initial viscosity (e.g.,
48.3 Pa-s at 𝜂*min, Figures 5.26a/5.30), and fairly fast gel, but is preferably subjected to an extended cure time at
an adequately high temperature to overcome vitrification issues (indicated by the reaction order n as high as 1.75;
refer to the caption of Figure 5.30). Kinetically, these two formulations have adequate latency, as evidenced by Ea
values greater than 51.0 kJ/mol, and once thermally activated, they gel and cure rapidly, as indicated empirically by
m < 0.50 and n < 1.00 at least, respectively.
Regarding a comprehensive description of rheo-kinetics (Figure 5.29), DSC kinetic results and DMA rheological
data for FBE-O3 are highly complementary in terms of quantitative 𝜂*min, gelation, ̇𝛼max versus Tpeak, and so forth.
Specifically, the coating softened and flowed, and curing commenced at about 80–82 ∘C after the coating melted
and well before 𝜂*min or the gel point. The FBE-O3 coating’s viscosity continued to decline, indicating good flow
and leveling, and reached its lowest value at 𝜂*min. Neither 𝜂*min at 118.0 ∘C nor the gel point at 129.6 ∘C represent
the onset of cure because the coating is already 24.5% and 49.1% cured at these temperatures; it is incorrect to
assume that 𝜂*min or the gel point signals the beginning of cure. As cure progressed, the extent of cure (𝛼) level
at gelation nearly doubled that at 𝜂*min, while viscosity substantially increased from 1.54e4 Pa-s at 𝜂*min to 0.271
MPa-s (or 2.71e5 Pa-s) at the gel point prior to reaching the maximum cure rate ( ̇𝛼max) at approximately 134.5 ∘C
(i.e., at 𝛼= 61.6% and 𝜂* = 0.485 MPa-s) in about 30 sec following the gel point. Tpeak occurring at 135.9 ∘C

190
5 Cure Kinetics and Rheology
(𝛼= 65.3% and 𝜂* = 0.530 MPa-s) was immediately after ̇𝛼max (fully validating Kissinger’s hypothesis). As a prac-
tical rule of thumb, Tpeak of a formulation is referred to as the minimal temperature required for conducting cure.
As the temperature continued to rise, chemical crosslinking of FBE-O3 progressed at an ever-declining ̇𝛼(i.e., 𝛼
continues to grow but at a slower rate); G′
max reached 1.24 MPa at 160.4 ∘C, which corresponds to a cure level (𝛼)
of 99.4% but not necessarily full cure, which occurred at 179.3 ∘C around 3 min after G′
max. Sequentially, coating
melted between 71.5 ∘C and 81.0 ∘C, cure started, first reaching 𝜂*min followed by gelation as cure accelerated
reaching ̇𝛼max in front of Tpeak, then cure entered a second stage of decreasing ̇𝛼’s due to consumption of the
majority of reactive sites on resins migrating to adequate and complete cure in the end. Throughout the entire cure
phase of FBE-O3 at 7.0 ∘C/min, vitrification was not observed since Tg < Tcure was constantly satisfied until cure
completion. In other words, vitrification is not an issue for such a coating with a generic Tg capacity when cured
at 7.0 ∘C/min or higher. In practice, a cure oven or residual temperature of 180−200 ∘C and preferably 200–220 ∘C
is sufficient and proper for curing FBE-O3; nevertheless, a cure temperature below 136.0 ∘C (Tpeak > Tg)
is judged inadequate or even prohibitive. One of the final cure schedules for FBE-O3 was determined to be at
232 ∘C for 44.0 sec at DFT 8–12 mils, followed by quenching.
Figure 5.30 demonstrates that the superpositioned DSC-DMA profiles for TG208 provide much more technical
information regarding its curing mechanisms and evolution of VE properties. In general, the progression of cure
at 7.0 ∘C/min for TG208 can be divided into two stages: from the onset of cure to the gel point, and from the gel
point to the end of cure. Specifically, in the viscosity-dominant region, cure begins at ∼102.5 ∘C (according to DSC

data), corresponding to a melting viscosity of about 702.6 Pa-s; the coating flows and its viscosity decreases; and
cure continues as temperature increases, reaching 𝜂*min of as low as 48.3 Pa-s at 135.7 ∘C in 4.7 min, corresponding
to G′ = 45.8 Pa, G′′ = 299.9 Pa, and 𝛼= 10.4%, respectively. Cure appears to accelerate after 𝜂*min and reaches
̇𝛼max at approximately 152.4 ∘C and 𝛼= 42.5% in 2.4 min, which is quadrupled. Again, it is shown that ̇𝛼max takes
place just before Tpeak, which occurs at 154.4 ∘C and 𝛼= 47.1% before ̇𝛼begins to decelerate. VE gelation (the
crossing of G′ and G′′ according to DMA data) does not occur until approximately 173.7 ∘C, where 𝛼= 81.2%,
which is a substantial increase compared to 𝛼’s at 𝜂*min and Tpeak. In the subsequent stage of elasticity dominance,
and shortly after the gel point, cure reactions slow down to an extent at which crosslinking changes from
kinetically driven to diffusion-controlled, most likely at 184.0 ∘C based on the diverged G′ peaks corresponding
to 𝛼= 89.3%; G′
max = 170.4 MPa of the cured film is developed at 193.3 ∘C where 𝜂* is as high as 28.42 MPa-s
prior to de-vitrification, at which curing is re-established starting at around 213.5 ∘C and 𝛼= 97.4% as the cure
temperature surpasses the in-situ Tg. End of cure can be assumed at 234.3 ∘C when 𝛼= 99.0% (albeit not yet cure
completion due to the high-Tg formulation), equivalent to G′ up to 46.6 MPa, which is lower than G′
max since the
cured film begins to soften as Tcure substantially exceeds the final Tg. Moduli and viscosity jump immediately after
𝜂*min, indicating that the latent TG208 coating gels and cures very fast upon thermal activation. Additionally,
and evidently, TG208’s wide flow window (i.e., the half-height line across gelation) and still thin 𝜂*min upon
fumed silica modification (resisting sagging according to physical testing on steel substrates) are good markers for
wetting and adhesion development. Vitrification occurs because both the Tan𝛿and G′′ curves exhibit divergent
dual peaks. Lastly, the 𝜂* onset after 𝜂*max and the G′ onset after G′
max at ∼207.3 ∘C are consistently indicative of
the final cured Tg, mimicking DMA on solid cured film samples that begin to transition to a rubbery state with a
decreasing modulus at that temperature profile.
Comparing TG208, which is representative of high-Tg epoxy formulations, to FBE-O3, which is representative of
generic Tg epoxy coatings, there are a few points to reiterate, as follows: Firstly, vitrification is a concern for TG208
during the late stage of cure, whereas over-cure is never a concern, as indicated by the long tail of the DSC exother-
mic curve; therefore, a fast enough heating rate for an extended enough time is desired to cure such high-Tg formu-
lations; this translates to a cure temperature of, for example, 240 ∘C or 250 ∘C, if practically possible. A workable
cure schedule was determined to be 232 ∘C for at least 15 min with Tcure > Tg + 10∼15 ∘C. The G′′ signals appear
to be more coherent indicators of vitrification than the Tan𝛿’s signals. Secondly, in addition to vitrification and
de-vitrification, the most significant difference between TG208 and FBE-O3 is that gelation takes place after Tpeak
for TG208 and before Tpeak for FBE-O3. Lastly, a broad flow window, which suggests a long pot life, and a low 𝜂*min,
which indicates favorable processing viscosity, complement adhesion, provided that sagging is not a concern.
Debrief G DMA-DSC consolidation
As stated previously, standard DSC is accurate to reveal kinetics, including 𝛼’s, whereas rheological DMA is sen-
sitive to measure viscoelasticity, including 𝜂*min, and the gelation of reactive polymers. When run at an identical
heat rate, two sets of data are naturally correlated, allowing users to uncover full cure behaviors for any particular
formulation and provide insights for advanced formulations from a bird’s-eye view. This is the basic concept under-
lying the combination of DSC and DMA. Rheological DMA is typically conducted under a dynamic temperature
ramp and a strain (𝛾)-controlled mode, that is, it measures the instantaneous stresses required to reach a fixed but
small strain (e.g., 2.0% or less); small strains are required to validate an LVR for characterization. More specifically,
dynamic rheology under modest strains surrounding the chemical crosslinking gelation reveals a transient phase
change from a VE liquid like a sol between Newton’s liquids and the critical gel point (when 𝛼< 𝛼gel) to a VE solid
like a gel between the critical gel and Hooke’s solids (when 𝛼> 𝛼gel), as illustrated in Figure 5.31. At or near the
gel point, the transient viscoelasticity possesses the wetting properties of a pre-gel liquid as well as the cohesive
strength of a post-gel solid, imparting the adhesion or tackiness of a flowable liquid as well as the cohesion or
toughness of an immobilized solid. The references of Winter and Lodge et al. [63, 85] provide profound insights.

Diagram illustrating the comprehensive rheo-kinetic properties of reactive polymer systems such as epoxies.
Figure 5.31 depicts a graphical scheme of the rheological characteristics of thermally reactive systems. The extent
of cure (𝛼) in %, or from 0 to 1, as well as the cure rate ( ̇𝛼) in 1/s, are crucial to the associated rheological land-
scape, which is also heavily affected by the heating rate (𝛽), as indicated on the horizontal axis. On the left side
are A/B-staged liquid coatings or coating melts described by Newton’s law or relevant in terms of viscosity and
flow, in that 𝜂*min should be emphasized as it governs adhesion or bonding strength on substrate surfaces with
given surface tensions. On the other hand, the right side of the graph represents the boundary of C-staged coat-
ing films when a maximum modulus is reached at full conversion corresponding to 𝛼= 1 or close to it, which is
solid according to Hooke’s law in terms of elastic dominance and for which Tg is consequently a crucial material
property. The region in between highlights the VE zone, which is separated into VE liquid and VE solid by the
critical gel (or gelation) occurring at a specific 𝛼gel for a specific formulation without exception; note that the crit-
ical gel occurs in the physical center of the VE region (i.e., 𝛼= 50%) only rarely, depending on formulations. The
maximum cure rate ( ̇𝛼max) correlates characteristically to Tpeak from DSC (not necessarily occurring at 𝛼= 50%
either). ̇𝛼max could happen prior to gelation, that is, 𝛼(at ̇𝛼max) < 𝛼gel and typically for generic Tg formulations, or
after gelation, that is, 𝛼(at ̇𝛼max) > 𝛼gel and typically for high-Tg formulations. As for vitrification, it could occur
anywhere throughout the entire 𝛼range, depending on Tcure; for example, vitrification at ambient temperature
(i.e., B-stage or B-staged) is desirable for storage and transport, whereas vitrification at elevated temperatures is
detrimental to cure fulfillment.
Last but not least, physical entanglements are just as significant as chemical crosslinking in determining gela-
tion, as the viscosity and elasticity of reactive polymers are both a function of their structural predicaments. As
lectured by Winter and Lodge et al. [63, 85], for stepwise polymerization that is temperature controlled, the gel
point is said to occur at approximately 𝛼gel ≥50%, for example, epoxies and polyurethanes; for chain-growth
polymerization crosslinking reactions that are controlled by catalysts and typically experiencing much greater
shrinkage, 𝛼gel ≤1% (very minimal), for example, BMIs (bismaleimides). In addition to the processing rheology
of reactive materials such as epoxy coatings and adhesives, physical entanglements (i.e., steric effects) joined by
chemical crosslinking have a substantial impact on product properties such as Tg, toughness, and flexibility, which
will be discussed in Chapter 6 when fluorene epoxies are discussed.

Recaps and Highlights (III)

Recaps and Highlights (III)
Reactive materials with viscoelasticity exhibit physical homogeneity (like non-reactive materials) but chemical
heterogeneity (unlike non-reactive materials). The rheology of reactive polymers and fluids is complicated as a
result of multiple variables and interactions in addition to temperature, pressure, and strain rate ( ̇𝛾), such as pri-
marily the degree of cure (𝛼) related to the FI, the cure rate ( ̇𝛼or d𝛼/dt) related to catalysts, resin MWs (that affect
at least the initial viscosity), rheology modifiers, and fillers with varying loading levels and morphology (e.g., the
aspect ratio). A number of empirically established models, including dual Arrhenius equations, have incorporated
𝛼and MW in one way or another but are unable to concurrently account for other equally significant factors. To
uncover crosslinking-driven structure-property performance for intended reactive systems, it appears that char-
acterization of rheological behaviors is more important than modeling; gelation, 𝜂*min, and vitrification measured
by dynamic oscillatory DMA tests are crucial in terms of material qualities such as flow, viscosity, and moduli.
Particularly, when paired with DSC kinetics, these important rheological events are readily quantified using 𝛼’s to
reveal the complete rheo-kinetics, hence facilitating formulation improvement and innovation.
Specifically, as a formulation property, chemical gelation represents the critical and transient onset of an immo-
bilized (solid) network formation from a flowable liquid; it is driven by chemical reactions, so it is f-independent;
and it does no harm to the instant ̇𝛼, so it cannot be detected by conventional DSC. Gelation is an iso-conversion
point independent of curing temperature. In other words, 𝛼gel is a constant for a given coating formulation; it does
not gel unless the exact 𝛼gel is attained, regardless of the temperature it is subjected to; 𝛼gel is less than or close to
50% for generic Tg (typically < 120 ∘C) epoxy formulations, and it can reach over 80% for high-Tg epoxy formula-
tions. In addition, the gel point indicates the processibility window or open time of a product. As a formulation
property, 𝜂*min affects processing by facilitating the unfolding of flow, leveling, and wetting of substrates when
the surface tension and contact angle stay essentially unchanged; 𝜂*min with the most viscous property physically
promotes adhesion development. As a formulation property, vitrification that occurs during curing is detrimental
since it results in undesired ̇𝛼slowing and incomplete curing. Similar to quenching, vitrification is reversible and
f-dependent, and it no longer reflects kinetic- but diffusion-controlled cure reactions. Higher Tg formulations are
more easily observed for vitrification at a given heating rate for cure; higher Tg means more inclination to vitrify at a
particular Tcure, or it is more challenging to accomplish a higher Tg capacity in practice. A high enough heating rate
to a high enough Tcure (> Tg) is thus required for de-vitrification. It is unlikely to formulate low-temperature-cure
epoxies for high-temperature application (associated with high Tgs) due to vitrification, which precludes it. How-
ever, vitrification is not a concern for homogeneous systems even with extremely high Tg potentials, such as the
self-polymerization of phthalonitrile, which will be investigated in Chapter 9. In other words, Tg values greater
than Tcure are entirely attainable for homogeneous polymerizations without any concern for cure-inhibiting vitri-
fication, or low-temperature-cure formulations for high-temperature applications are possible for chemically and
physically homogeneous systems. All rheological behaviors are altered by heating rates; a quicker heating rate is
equal to a formulation containing fewer catalysts.
Flowability and 𝜂*min, in conjunction with the rheological flow window, impact not only adhesion, including
surface wetting and leveling, but also processing, including sagging resistance; t- and T-dependent cure kinet-
ics define modulus development from a viscous liquid to an elastic solid, and consequently product properties
mechanically (Tg, flexibility, toughness, permeability, etc.), chemically, thermally, and electrically. Regardless of
technology platforms (e.g., liquid, e-coat, and powder), or end applications (general industrial surface coating,
lamination, adhesives including die-attaches, injection molding, and underfills), or specific layers (direct-to-metal
primers and topcoats), the gel point or gelation, 𝜂*min, Tpeak, and vitrification at specific transient cure levels and

cure rates (𝛼’s and ̇𝛼’s) are universal parameters to consider. In the VE liquid phase, 𝜂*min is the most important
event to monitor; in the VE solid phase, the profiles of G′, G′′, and Tan𝛿are examined for overcoming any vit-
rification (in which case the heating rate must be increased) and for ensuring cure completion. The critical gel
point separates the two phases, occurring exclusively at a constant 𝛼gel; it can take place before or after Tpeak, or,
depending on formulation, ̇𝛼max (literally at Tpeak) can occur before or after the gel point.

Formulation Case Studies
In this chapter, a wide variety of applied epoxy coating formulations are covered as standalone modules and
discussed in terms of particular themes or parameters, such as various packages of resins, crosslinkers, catalysts,
and other ingredients that highlight structure-property relationships of industrial interest or value proposition.
Although allied one-/two-component (1/2K) solvent-based (SB) and 100% solids liquid coating examples are
included in this chapter, the primary emphasis is on functional fusion bonded epoxy (FBE) formulations, which
are solvent-free and readily re-formulated into yet one-pot or 1K SB systems of equivalent product performance
as long as appropriate solvents such as MEK (methyl-ethyl-ketone), NMP (N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone), and PM
acetate (propylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate) are used. KJCMPATM-100 (CAS# 53185-52-7, surface tension
32.4 mN/m, KJ Chemicals) and bio-cellulose-derived dihydrolevoglucosenone (e.g., Cyrene supplied by Circa
Group, France) are regarded as functional alternatives to NMP.

Liquid Epoxy Coatings and Adhesives
6.1.1
One-component (1K) SB epoxy coatings for laminating
As far as one-component (1K) liquid formulations are concerned, it is optional and more convenient to mix and
prepare coatings on a weight basis as opposed to on a volume basis. Table 6.1 exemplifies a dielectric coating
formulated with amine chemistry, heavily filled with functional thermal fillers, and of 1K stability sufficiently
sustained by latent 4, 4′-DDS (CAS# 80-08-0, Tm 148 ∘C; refer to Figure 2.2f in Chapter 2) as the crosslinker and
Curezol 2MA-OK, a dormant triazine isocyanuric acid imidazole-adduct dihydrate (CAS# 68490-66-4, Tm 260 ∘C),
as the catalyst.
Following is an analysis of the compositional formulation of this thermally conductive dielectric coating
(Table 6.1). Kane Ace MX215 (Kaneka) is a CSR (core-shell-rubber) consisting of butadiene acrylic as the core
and epoxy novolac as the shell, similar to Kane Ace MX125 with the exception of a styrene-butadiene rubber
(SBR) core of 25% and a BPA-based epoxy (i.e., DER438L) shell of 75%. These epoxy-compatible CSRs are
intended to provide toughening or prevent easily occurring fractures (tensile, shear, and tear) in addition to
improving T-peel and lap-shear strengths according to ASTM D1876 and D1002, respectively. Araldite MY721
(CAS# 28768-32-3, from formerly Huntsman Performance Materials) is a semi-solid epoxy as the bulk resin and
tetra-functional for high-Tg fulfillments, as is the latent Lapox K10 (from Atul), that is, 4, 4′-DDS as the sole
crosslinker with 4-fold reactive −NH−sites increasing crosslinking density and of latency allowing 1K capability.
The formulation index (FI) is calculated to be 2.786, which means a resin-rich system. It indicates that epoxy
homo-polymerization will take place significantly in crosslinking reactions, encouraging the development of

flexibility, Tg, and fracture-resistant toughness. Curezol 2MA-OK (produced by Air Products/Evonik or Shikoku
Chemicals) is loaded at 1.024 phr as the cure accelerator to primarily promote epoxy homo-cures. BN (boron
nitride) and alumina are thermally conductive fillers comprising 3.52 phr or 53.28% by weight of the whole
formula, indicating a highly filled system. As a dual-functional (epoxide and trimethoxy silane chemically
interacting with the bulk resins and OH-functional substrate surfaces, respectively) adhesion promoter, 0.39 phr
of Silquest A-187 silane is incorporated.
Following is an analysis of the coating’s processing, application, and performance as a product. In general, for
mixing, solvents are added first, then resins, then fillers and curing agents, and finally silanes. Preferably, the
hard-to-mix Kane Ace MX215 is heated up to 100 ∘C (to make it flowable) prior to being fully premixed into
incumbent solvents and loading other resins. It is preferable to apply high-shear mixing at a rate of, for example,
1,200 rpm for 45 min prior to loading BN (silane surface-treated), Lapox, Curezol, alumina, and the silane for an
additional 60 min of high-shear blending. The dielectric coating premix is then transferred and circulated for a
minimum of 120 min in an attritor with ceramic media until a Hegman grind fineness of at least 7.5 is reached.
The milled coating slurry is subsequently pumped through a filter (optionally vacuumed to remove trapped air)
before being ready for curtain coating onto pretreated metal substrates (e.g., 5052 and 6061 aluminum, 1–6 oz ED
copper, etc.) to produce MCPCB laminates as described in Chapter 4. For consistent process control, the coating’s
viscosity is measured and adjusted in real time using pure MEK while it is subjected to constant but mild mixing
and circulation. Cure schedules in a hot presser may be, for example, 204 ∘C (i.e., 400 ∘F) for 2 hours (dynamic
heating at the beginning and cooling in the end) under vacuum; such appropriately managed cure cycles aid in
limiting stress accumulation in the sandwiched coating layer throughout the curing process. At 1.5 mil dielectric
DFT (precisely controlled by curtain die slot opening and coating solids), peel strength at room temperature is
typically up to 5.0 lb/in (0.90 N/mm) per ASTM D2861; thermal conductivity is ∼3.0 W/m-∘K per ASTM D5470;
glass transition temperature (Tg) is up to 185 ∘C per ASTM E1356; and UL RTI (relative thermal index typical of
maximum operating temperature) is 140 ∘C per UL746 and a UL94 rating of V-0.

6.1.2
Two-component (2K) epoxy coatings for surface lining
General industrial surface coatings are primarily used to protect steel from corrosion. Long-term corrosion
resistance is dependent on wet adhesion and coating film impermeability to moisture or water. Parts A and B of
Table 6.2 represent bulk epoxies and crosslinkers, respectively, of a two-component (2K) fast-cure liquid epoxy
coating containing nearly 100% solids for possible use as a base- or top-coat on primarily steel substrates in
broad industrial applications. This epoxy formulation is representative of applied 2K systems where a number
of valuable formulation techniques are perfectly accommodated, including: i) cure acceleration via the use of
acrylates and phenols (refer to Figures 2.15d/a in Chapter 2, respectively), ii) a combination of both amines and
a Mannich base (refer to Table 2.3c in Chapter 2) in the crosslinker package, and iii) epoxy toughening and
flexibilizing via the incorporation of a compatible flexibilizer. It should be reiterated that acrylates readily react
with amines (except tertiary ones), so the component (i.e., Ancarez 2364) is loaded with epoxies in Part A; on the
other hand, phenols are reactive toward epoxides, so the component (i.e., nonyl phenol) is loaded with amine
curing agents in Part B, and not the other way around. The tertiary amine catalyst (i.e., Ancamine K54) is sensibly
selected for Part B; nevertheless, it may be optionally combined with epoxies in Part A until thermal activation or
maybe not, subject to validation of latency.
First and foremost, 2K liquids are exclusively volume-based, requiring density for all constituents when it comes
to the pre-determined mixing ratio of the epoxy resin component and the amine curing agent component for
formulation design and application. Once the binders, which consist of resins and curing agents, are volume quan-
tified and the formulation structure is pre-constructed, it is recommended to add filler packages per the required
pigment to binder ratio (supposedly check it and the PVC in calculation), to enter solvents and/or diluents as
applicable (supposedly check VOCs in calculation), to add adhesion promoters as a weight percentage or parts by
weight (pbw) of the total formulation if applicable, and to enter additives. In a formulation worksheet, it is nearly
always suggested that formula calculations be double-checked to confirm the intended FI and that the batch total
be set according to the planned volume ratio in the end, for example, three (3) gallons for a 2: 1 ratio. Particularly,

204
6 Formulation Case Studies
Table 6.2 displays a 2K formulation that is almost 100% solids (except for a minimal amount of VOCs in Part A)
and has a volume ratio of 2: 1. Unless otherwise specified, the following discussion is best understood in terms of
the converted grammages, or pbw, while focusing on the associated chemistry, variables, and performance.
Specifically, and qualitatively, in Part A of the bulk epoxy resins, DER 331 (epoxy equivalent weight (EEW)
187, Olin; refer to Figure 1.1 in Chapter 1), much like EPON 828 (EEW 187-190, Hexion/Westlake), is a com-
monly used liquid BPA-based epoxy resin for all general applications; however, Ancarez 2364 is a moderately
viscous acrylate (C=C)-functional urethane resin that serves as an epoxy flexibilizer, co-binder, and cure accel-
erator. Acrylates are known to readily react with primary (1∘) and secondary (2∘) amines via Michael Addition
reactions (refer to Figure 3.9 in Chapter 3), generating secondary (2∘) and tertiary (3∘) amine-acrylate adducts,
respectively, wherein the newly formed secondary (2∘) amines continue to optionally react with either epoxides
or acrylates, further forming a 3D crosslinked network. Aerosil® 200 or 380 (hydrophilic, surface areas 200 or
380 m2/g, Evonik) is a fumed silica used as a rheology modifier and anti-settling agent in both Part A and Part
B as part of the filler and pigment package. Alternatively, hydrophobic silica can be used, such as Aerosil® R 972
(surface area 110 m2/g, silane surface-treated). If shear thinning or thixotropy is needed, other viscosity additives
can be organoclays (e.g., Bentone 38 or 27) and hydrogenated castor oils. As discussed previously, Silquest A-187
silane is once again included to promote adhesion to surfaces.
Still specifically and qualitatively in Part B of the amine curing agents, Ancamine 2089M with an EW-NH or
AHEW (amine hydrogen equivalent weight) of 75.0 g/eq and containing both 1∘and 2∘amines is a modified
aliphatic amine curing agent that provides rapid cure at ambient and low temperatures for liquid epoxy coatings,
including flooring. Please note that this amine crosslinker has an amine equivalent weight of 142.0 g/eq based
on its amine value of 395 mg KOH/g, which is applicable to polyureas in which a primary amine reacts with iso-
cyanates only once. Cardolite® NC-558 (produced by Cardolite; refer to Table 2.2c in Chapter 2) is a low-viscosity
solvent-free phenalkamine, essentially a Mannich base having dual phenyl hydroxyl (Ph-OH) and amine (−NH−
and −NH2) functions (refer to Table 2.3c in Chapter 2), and it is recommended for metal and concrete substrate
applications. The mono-phenyl hydroxyl functional nonyl phenol is representative of the other types of epoxy
curing accelerators, as demonstrated by the epoxy-phenyl hydroxyl reaction mechanism as previously described
(refer to Figure 3.4 in Chapter 3). Para- or 4-tert butyl phenol is an effective offset to nonyl phenol. Ancamide
K54 (Evonik), equivalent to Cardolite NT-1300, is a trade name for the well-known tertiary (3∘) amine of DMP-30
(refer to Table 2.5b in Chapter 2) as the catalyst in this formulation.
Still specifically and quantitatively, in this coating formulation as a whole, the FI or the stoichiometric ratio is
nominally at 0.976, with the acrylate resin (EW-acrylate 470) included on the epoxy side but the nonyl phenol
accelerator (EW-PhOH 220.4, versus 4-tert-butyl phenol’s EW-PhOH 150.2) not included on the amine side. The
entire system can be viewed as amines with a molar excess of 0.8%, or up to 11.8% if the phenol is also counted
on the amine side. In addition, the Mannich base (i.e., Cardolite NC-558) is comprised of both phenyl hydroxyls
(Ph-OH) and amines, but only the amine content is factored into the FI calculation, meaning that the actual FI
is appreciably less than 0.86. The stoichiometrically excessive crosslinker component or epoxies in deficiency
are advantageously designed for cure expeditions at low temperatures. Epoxy-crosslinker co-polymerization
and Michael Addition are anticipated to predominate in the cure reactions. On the other hand, this means
that liquid coatings are frequently more forgiving of ratios, especially when dual-functional curing agents
and mono-functional accelerators are used. The total fillers and pigments account for 37.9% by weight of the
total formulation, which corresponds to a P/B ratio of 0.62 when all co-resin components are accounted for;
A-187 silane is loaded at 0.40% by weight of the total formula, which is a reasonable level; acrylate and phenol
accelerators comprise 3.7% and 4.2% by weight of the total formulation, respectively, which correspond to 10.0
and 11.4 phr (of the bulk epoxy resin) at fairly high levels. The DMP-30 catalyst is loaded at 0.52% by weight, or
1.43 phr, demonstrating the formulation’s purpose to gel and cure rapidly. In fact, this 2K liquid epoxy coating
is thermally and kinetically characterized to gel in minutes and almost completely cure at 25 ∘C in 19.2 hours

6.1 Liquid Epoxy Coatings and Adhesives

(or overnight) with a Tg of 62.4 ∘C (refer to Table 5.13 in Chapter 5), exhibiting a very rapid tack-free service
turnaround time consistent with its kinetic parameters (A 25,000, Ea 44,800 J/mol, m 0.24, and n 1.52).
When it comes to determining the gel point of 2K liquid coatings or adhesives, for example, at room temperature,
for pot life purposes, the following two methods are typically employed: i) measure viscosity upon mixing of the
two parts with an F-t bar spindle at 2 rpms or most commonly 20 rpms and record the time it takes to double its
viscosity; and ii) perform DMA isotherm at 25 ∘C, 1.0 Hz, 1.0% strain, using, for example, 4-cm plates recording
for the time to reach Tan𝛿= 1 or the storage modulus (G′) to reach 90% of the final G′
max value. In the DMA
method, a testing sample should be dispensed into the rheometer, preferably using a two-part tube that has been
prepared with the 2K coating in advance; the coating should also fill the gap without overflowing (a gap of 1,000
to 1,500 μm, for example).
6.1.3
2K epoxy adhesives as thermal interface materials
Thermal interface materials (TIMs) are essentially thermally conductive coatings or adhesives, and they are an
indispensable yet underappreciated solution to telecom industries, automotive, consumer and medical devices,
LED lighting, DC/AC power conversion, and many others for dissipating or transferring heat from electronic
components to primarily the environment. As digital, 5/6G, and AI (artificial intelligence) technologies grow, the
heat generated by highly integrated units of electronics, such as supercomputing, is exponentially overpowering.
According to https://www.researchandmarkets.com, leading global suppliers of TIMs include Laird Technologies,
Henkel Adhesives, and Panasonic, among others. The global TIM market for 5G alone accounted for USD 434.5
million in 2020 and is expected to reach USD 908.9 million by 2026, led by Asia-Pacific, including Japan [1].
TIMs include, without limiting to theory or chemistry, a variety of polymer products in a variety of forms with
a variety of softness or low modulus, such as low-cost high-usage greases and phase change materials (PCMs)
designed for thin interfaces, gap pads and tapes based on silicone, polyurethane, and other chemistries designed
for non-thin interfaces, in addition to gap fillers, liquid adhesives (acrylics, epoxies, silicones, and hybrids), and
film adhesives (fiber glass or film reinforced) developed for miscellaneous interfaces. Conformality and flexibility
of TIMs are required for most end applications and are commonly obtained by controlled the extent of under cur-
ing of, for example, silicone elastomers and thermoplastics (such as polybutadiene or PBD for short), in contrast
to hard thermosetting epoxies for thermally conductive laminates, as discussed in Section 6.1.1. The thermal
conductivity in W/m-∘K and thermal impedance in ∘K/W at a given bond line are, of course, the most impor-
tant qualities of TIMs. Thermal conductivity of commercially available TIMs on global markets ranges from 1.0
to 5.0 W/m-∘K as primarily filled with alumina ceramics (25.0 W/m-∘K) at 400 to 1,500 phr (as needed), whereas
high-performance TIM products of up to 20 W/m-∘K or perhaps higher (e.g., DBC or direct bond copper on ceram-
ics) can be specially formulated by using expensive ceramics such as BN (boron nitride, 751 W/m-∘K) [2] and AlN
(aluminum nitride, 321 W/m-∘K), among others. Notably, the thermal conductivity (𝜆) of B3As14, also known as
boron arsenide or BA (CAS# 12005-69-5), is up to 1300 W/m-∘K. Notably, graphene is high in in-plane but low in
through-plane thermal conductivity; DBCs are utilized in certain value-added power modules, despite their low
adhesion and brittleness.
In Chapter 9 of non-epoxy platforms and Chapter 10 of adhesion, acrylic- and silicone-based adhesives and
coatings with formulated thermal conductivity for TIMs and without for generic industrial applications will be
examined in detail. Table 6.3 provides an illustration of a TIM-oriented 2K epoxy adhesive formulation that is
highly filled with alumina particles of varying sizes. Please note that this formulation is weight-based due to the
extremely high viscosity of each component, which resembles a paste or dough (see viscosity in Table 6.3 as mea-
sured with a TF spindle and Brookfield), even though the designed mix ratio of Part A to Part B at 2: 1 remains
volume-based (corresponding to a mix ratio of 1.764: 1 by weight), which is representative of and consistent with
standard formulation metrics for liquid coatings and adhesives. To ensure the correct mix ratio during process-
ing and application, the two components can be pre-filled into, for example, a dual cartridge with a 2-to-1 mix

nozzle (piston pump metering and mixing dispensing equipment are preferred for high viscosity adhesives like
this one), and sufficient mixing is achieved by dispensing the dual components through the nozzle (e.g., includ-
ing for subsequent cure and lap-shear studies). This process eliminates concerns regarding the correct ratio and
adequate mixing in systems that are highly filled. Typically, low-viscosity silicone fluids have more filling capacity
than epoxies, which is advantageous for processing.
Specific to compositions, EPON 862 and EPON 825 on the A-side of epoxies are BPF- and BPA-based
low-viscosity liquid resins, respectively; DETA (i.e., diethylenetriamine) on the B-side of curing agents is a liquid
amine crosslinker with 5-fold NH-functionality. Not coincidentally, and as seen from the foregoing, nonyl phenol
functions both as an accelerator and a reactive diluent that reacts with epoxies via its mono-functional Ph-OH.
This formulation is filled with alumina ceramics at a level of 512.5 phr of epoxy resins, or 79.6% by weight of the
whole formulation, resulting in a thermal conductivity of up to 2.5 W/m-∘K. In addition, FI is calculated to be
0.611 when epoxies and DETA are accounted for. Epoxy resin deficit or crosslinker excess is justified by i) ensuring
complete curing of epoxies, ii) the elusive nature of DETA, and iii) the use of nonyl phenol as a plasticizer to
increase the adhesive’s softness. Notably, 10-mil glass beads are used to guarantee that the bond line is invariably
at 10 mils under pressure. When preparing these two components, it is suggested to utilize a speed mixer in the
lab or a planetary mixer in production under 30-inHg vacuum to remove any trapped air. Curing reactions take
place when the two components are well mixed at room temperature or by introducing heat to accelerate.

Functional Epoxy Powder Coatings
6.2.1
Formulation index-oriented formulation optimization
As described in Chapter 4, the formulation index (FI), also referred to as the stoichiometric ratio, plays a vital
role in formulating and optimizing high-performance coatings and adhesives of all types, such as FBEs in their

capacities of maximized Tg up to 250 ∘C for enduring heat and UV lights, cohesive toughness up to 160 lb-in for
withstanding impact shocks, low-temperature flexibility greater than 8.5∘/PD (pipe diameter, or sustaining 180∘
bending in seconds [sec] without cracks) at −45 ∘C, impermeability close to zero (testable via hot water soak tests at
95 ∘C for 28 days) for resisting moisture, intact wet adhesion to metal substrates (testable under harsh three-phase
high temperature and high pressure or HTHP, for example, 175–205 ∘C and 3,500–10,000 psi autoclave settings)
for battling long-term corrosion, as well as functional formulations free of crosslinkers but properly catalyzed,
other than cationic UV curable. These highly capable formulations and properties are of great interest to a wide
variety of high-performance applications, including injection molding for benchtops and similar applications,
protective powder coatings, functional clearcoats without “amine blush,” 3D printing, insulated metal substrate
lamination (refer to Figures 4.6b/4.8 in Chapter 4), and carbon fiber or glass fiber-reinforced epoxy composites
(CF/GFRPs; refer to Table 10.4 in Chapter 10), among others. Particularly, epoxy protective coatings [3], including
clearcoats, both liquids (i.e., solvent-borne and waterborne), and powders that are unfilled and require color sta-
bility and lightfastness, have been increasingly utilized in a variety of end applications, including but not limited
to infrastructure (floorings, ceilings, bridges, etc.), oil and gas, power and mining, industrial (metal, wood fin-
ishes, plastics, concrete, etc.), aerospace, marine, automotive, and consumer products. The FI is an independent
variable; however, it is inherently linked to two variables, the resin and the crosslinker, concurrently. In retro-
spect, Table 4.5 (Chapter 4) illustrates the design of experiments (DOE) driven by FI optimization operations for
a latent yet fast-gel FBE coating formulation in which a weakly anionic imidazole adduct catalyst variant (e.g.,
Epikure P-101) remains constant at 4.15% of the formulation’s total weight or 4.50 phr (per hundred resin) of the
total resins and hardeners. Cationic catalysts (e.g., ethyl triphenyl phosphonium iodide, or ETPPI; refer to Figure
2.14a in Chapter 2) on their own typically lead to slow-gel/-cure epoxy formulations; therefore, they are reported
separately in Subsection 6.2.8 and Debrief B. The specified epoxy resin and hardener have a nominal EEW of
approximately 1,300 g/eq and a reactive equivalent weight of approximately 380 g/eq, respectively. Consequently,
FIs are computed and tabulated (refer to Table 4.5 in Chapter 4).
Again, this set of underlying formulations differed only in FIs while using the identical Type 5 epoxy resin
and BPA-based phenolic hardener; the resin/hardener weight ratios ranged from 3.8 to 19.0 to infinity, which are
consistent with the nominal FIs increasing from 1.62 to 5.8 to infinity. The nine-batch DOE provided for a large
variety of resin and crosslinker combinations. Notably, Batch #8 represents an extreme scenario in the absence
of crosslinker (i.e., crosslinker-free or at an infinite FI). Eight of the nine total batches, except for Batch #0 with
a nominal FI = 1.62, were executed and evaluated, generating complete physical and kinetic results as presented
in Figures 6.1/6.2, respectively. It is explicitly demonstrated that an optimal formulation window lies between
3.15 and 4.91, specifically between 3.45 and 4.61, in terms of achieving maximum flexibility performance. Phys-
ical chain entanglements, which reduce flexibility while increasing crosslinking density, are responsible for the
crosslinker-free condition’s inability to achieve maximal flexibility. In the interim, gel times decreased and the Tg
rose as the FI increased. In other words, a higher FI results in a faster gel and greater heat resistance. Particularly
when FI = ∞or infinity, that is, when there were no crosslinkers present in the formulation, the gel time was the
shortest at 3.90 sec and the Tg was the highest at 106.7 ∘C, which is still within the scope of a generic Tg capacity
below 120 ∘C.
The objective of an advanced epoxy formulation technique is to determine the optimal FI factor by design. From
the perspective of the epoxy curing reactions, an optimal FI of epoxy coatings indicates that the fractions of primary
epoxy homo-cures and epoxy-hardener co-polymerization, in addition to aliphatic secondary −OH-associated
crosslinking reactions in the cured network, are installed nearly precisely or in the maximum mode intended
for one or more performing characteristics, such as the maximum flexibility examined in the following sets of
DOE implementation. There is always an ideal catalyst loading when the formulation is operating at an optimized
FI or at full capacity. In other words, the optimal FI for a specific formulation is catalyst-dependent; the perfor-
mance of the optimal FI at a lower catalyst loading differs quantitatively from that at a higher catalyst loading.
Crosslinker-free formulations (to be discussed in the following subsection), which are practically applicable to both

indicating physically homogeneous systems and chemically 100% epoxy homo-polymerization (i.e., completely

which are sometimes regulated by adjusting the weight proportions of epoxies and crosslinkers when the corre-
sponding equivalent weights of some crosslinkers (especially dual-functional or -reactive, such as Mannich bases
(refer to Tables 2.2c/2.3c in Chapter 2) with both Ph-OH and primary/secondary amine moieties, are not always

Figure 6.3
Overlapping (a) DSC exothermic curves and (b) complex viscosity (𝜂*) from DMA rheology testing corresponding
to formulations in Figure 6.1.
The kinetic parameters for these DOE batches, including A = 25,000, Ea, m, and n, are acquired and analyzed.
It is evident that Ea decreased as the FI increased (Figure 6.2a), reaching a minimum value of 48.85 kJ/mol for the
crosslinker-free formulation. Meanwhile, the reaction orders m increased and n decreased until they reached an
equal level of 0.60 at FI = ∞(Figure 6.2b), which corresponds to the highest total reaction order (m + n) at 1.19
(greater than a first-order reaction); the lowest total reaction order at a level of 0.92–0.93 (less than a first-order
reaction indicating faster cure) was in the greatest agreement with maximal flexibility, which occurred between
FI values of 3.45 and 4.61. The reaction orders m and n were identical in the absence of crosslinkers, indicating
that the slope and shape of the exothermic curves from DSC before and after Tpeak are identical. In other words,
the curing rate in the later stage of crosslinking (as governed by n) is as fast as that in the initial stage (as governed
by m), allowing for a faster overall cure completion.
From a thermogram (Figure 6.3a) perspective, nominal Tonset and enthalpy grew consistently with the FI, albeit
with some variations; Tpeak rose and peaked at FI = 3.45 before falling to its lowest point at 131.7 ∘C, which corre-
sponds to the crosslinker-free configuration. Similarly, and in general, 𝜂* (Figure 6.3b) increased with FIs across
the temperature range, such as from 90 ∘C to 160 ∘C. Specifically, 𝜂*min is the lowest (30,773.7 Pa-s) at the highest
temperature of 117.8 ∘C (corresponding to the smallest FI = 2.25) and the highest (62,291.7 Pa-s) at the lowest tem-
perature of 113.5 ∘C (corresponding to the largest FI = ∞). Consistent with the cured modulus (G′), 𝜂*max increased
sizably from its minimum at FI = 2.25 to its maximum at FI = infinity. In addition, cured film DMA data report
E′ (Figure 6.4), indicating that the tensile modulus at elevated temperatures (such as the rubbery plateau zone
from 125 ∘C to 170 ∘C) increased invariably with the FIs, which corresponds to Tg, which by definition suggests
the crosslinking density. In other words, the greater the FI, the greater the modulus, and it is anticipated that the
cured modulus and Tg attain their maximum values for maximum heat resistance at FI = ∞or in the absence of
crosslinkers, without exception unless catalysts are changed (refer to Appendix A).
From the perspective of curing chemistry, crosslinker-free formulations suggest that epoxy-epoxy homo-
polymerization accounts for all due cure reactions that occur in the absence of co-polymerization in the system.
Recall that epoxy homo-cures result in 100% highly linear ether-linked homo-structures (refer to Figure 3.2b
in Chapter 3), which theoretically should lead to the greatest flexibility and minimum Tg. The experimental
results presented in Figures 6.1/6.3a/6.4 unequivocally and reproducibly refute these two hypotheses, since
Tg was the highest in the absence of hardeners, poor-flexibility-induced cracking at an infinite FI was the
worst, and the best flexibility indeed occurred at nominal FIs between 4.01 and 4.61. In other words, the

optimal bend-sustaining flexibility performance of epoxy coatings is typically attained at an acceptable ratio of
homo-cures to co-polymerization dependent on the resin package and the catalyst (type and loading) utilized,
and not at straight homo-polymerization. Substantial quantities of physical entanglements of the overextended
etherification chains are presumably responsible for this phenomenon, which also contributes to a rise in Tg.
Summarily, Tg (and hence the associated heat resistance), modulus (especially at elevated temperatures), and
toughness are all greatest at the infinite FI or in the absence of crosslinkers, the gel time is the shortest, and
flexibility ends up being suboptimal at best.
6.2.2
Crosslinker-free formulations
Crosslinker-free formulations refer to those without crosslinkers or with the FI extended to infinity, indicating
physically homogeneous systems and chemically 100% epoxy homo-polymerization (i.e., purely linear chain prop-
agation that is intended to achieve maximum flexibility like polyethylene). Using an FBE powder platform with
di-functional (di-f) EPON 2004 (Type 4 epoxy, EEW 925), more than di-f KD-213H (epoxy novolac, EEW 800),
multi-f EPON 165 (a matrix epoxy monomer, EEW 215, Figure 1.8a in Chapter 1), and other specialty epoxy
resins and monomers such as FortegraTM 310 (isocyanate-modified, EEW 472), OGSOL PG-100 (fluorene-based
specialty epoxy monomer, EEW 250–251 g/eq), etc., crosslinker-free epoxy coating formulations (i.e., FI = ∞) were
investigated in greater detail and compared to conventional crosslinker-containing formulations (i.e., FIs between
zero and infinity). As noted previously, epoxy systems formulated without hardeners represent an extreme case in
which epoxy homo-cures monopolize crosslinking and epoxy-hardener interactions are completely absent. From
the standpoint of coatings chemistry and performance at the molecular level, epoxy curing is a dynamic process of
generating a heterogeneous network with epoxy homo-cures and epoxy-crosslinker co-polymerization combined.
The overall structural properties of cured coatings, including Tg, flexibility, cohesive toughness, adhesion, imper-
meability barrier, and elasticity, are intrinsically determined by the proportions of these two crosslinking segments

and how and to what extent they are finally interwoven into a single bulk system. Epoxy homo-polymerization
(i.e., etherification) is initiated primarily by weakly anionic 3∘amines (i.e., Lewis bases) and imidazoles, result-
ing in chain-growth and homogeneous propagation of ether linkages upon thermal activation (refer to Figures
3.1/3.2b/3.3b in Chapter 3). Epoxy-hardener polyaddition reactions, on the other hand, are stepwise, heteroge-
neous, and inevitably introduce additional aliphatic hydroxyls (>C-OH) into the cured network (refer to Figures
3.1/3.2a in Chapter 3). These two routes of curing reactions are in direct competition because they both consume
epoxy resins until they are depleted. The stoichiometric ratio, or FI, is a factor that strongly affects the amounts
of these two structural components in the final network; as a result, an optimal FI often exists for a particular
formulation to demonstrate a maximum coating performance property, such as bulk flexibility, as highlighted in
the preceding section. In another aspect, an applied product may exhibit a pronounced discrepancy in one or
more of its bulk physical properties, either favorably or unfavorably, in response to a negligible FI variation, which
determines the entangled architecture of the cured system.
In light of the FI, crosslinker-free formulations have an infinite stoichiometric ratio of resins to crosslinkers (i.e.,
1: 0), in contrast to formulations that are theoretically and practically close to 1: 1. Unless otherwise specified, ter-
tiary amines or imidazoles such as 2MI are employed as catalysts, whereas amine adducts such as Epikure P-100
and others are preferred for curing at elevated cure temperatures. This subsection employs solvent-free FBE for-
mulations and novolac epoxies, if necessary, for comparison, in place of the BPA-based epoxies used in the prior
subsection. The physical and rheo-kinetic results for FIs increasing from 1.05, 1.20, 1.50, and 2.00 to infinity at
the same 2MI loading level are presented in Tables 6.4/6.5, respectively. Uncured powder coating samples were
characterized primarily by gel times, pill flows, DSC exotherms, and DMA rheology; cured coating films on blasted
steel panels at 12–14 mil DFT were then evaluated for flexibility, direct impact, dielectric strength, Patti pull adhe-
sion, and hot water soak adhesion (HWA) according to respective standards (refer to Chapter 4). Relevant cure
schedules were determined exclusively by DSC kinetics and empirically validated by the DSC residual exotherms
of cured films.
Overall, the crosslinker-free formulation using a novolac epoxy (i.e., the batch with an infinite FI in
Tables 6.4/6.5) exhibited apparent and similar advantages in terms of the highest Tg and shortest gel and cure
times, in addition to competitive performance in wet and dry adhesion, moisture resistance, and perhaps
dielectric strength. Specifically, the formulation with an infinite FI resulted in a Tg of 117.0 ∘C (still within the
range of generic Tg capacity of epoxies less than 120 ∘C), indicating the highest crosslinking density compared to
those with Tgs below 110 ∘C. It is demonstrated that di-functional epoxy cure reactions are capable of developing a

greater degree of crosslinking density on their own without the addition of crosslinkers, contrary to conventional
perceptions that multi-functional crosslinkers are required for crosslinking di-functional epoxies [4]. At the same
0.68 phr catalyst level, gel times at 204 ∘C decreased from 11.3 sec at FI = 1.05 to 5.0 sec at FI = ∞; gel times at
other stoichiometric ratio conditions of 1.20, 1.50, and 2.00 were all close to 8.6 sec. As a result, gel times decrease
correspondingly with FIs; in other words, epoxy homo-addition enables significantly faster gel and cure to fulfill
crosslinking, commensurate with cure schedules (Table 6.5) derived from kinetic data. Excluding the highlighted
FI = 1.20 as an outlier, practically all attributes, including Tg, pill flow, impact, kinetic cure times, dynamic
gelation, 𝜂*min, etc., exhibit a consistent trending pattern. Otherwise, an analytically substantial correlation
between these performance characteristics and FIs makes less sense; for example, if the data point for FI = 1.20
is excluded, pill flows appear to follow a similar pattern to gel times.
As consistently observed, the coated surface at 12 mils had a gloss level of more than 80% at all FI levels tested.
Flexibility was greater than 6.0∘/PD and linearly proportional to FIs from 1.05 to 2.00; it was 4.12∘/PD for the
infinite FI or crosslinker-free condition, which is adequately high but obviously not the best, consistent with the
previous results for BPA-based epoxies. In conclusion, crosslinker-free formulations may not necessarily exhibit
the greatest bending flexibility, regardless of whether the formulation is composed of novolac epoxies or DGEBAs,
if the Tg is within the generic Tg capacity. Dielectric strength in terms of voltage breakdown increased with rising
FI levels; it was 1.26 kV/mil for FI = 1.05 (Table 6.4) compared to 1.17 kV/mil for typical amine-cured FBEs. Patti
pull-dry adhesion was constantly greater than 65.0 psi owing to adhesive failures. Direct impact shock resistance
improved with FIs reaching as high as 80–90 lb-in at FI = 1.20 and then nearly sustaining at 70–80 lb-in at FI =
infinity, indicating that pure epoxy homo-cures retain a high level of toughness. Moisture resistance, as measured
by water uptake at both 75 and 95 ∘C for 28 days, was best for FIs at 2.00, 1.05, and infinity, which also ranked best
in wet adhesion; nevertheless, FI = 2.00 was observed to cause minor but massive blistering at 95 ∘C, while the
other two did not. Without being limited to theory, water absorption by cured polymer films reduces Tg, hence
weakening thermomechanical properties; epoxy is expected to reduce Tg by up to 20 ∘C per 1% weight gain [5].
Commercial hot water extraction at 82 ∘C according to NSF61 protocols revealed that higher FIs may result in
more undesirable benzene leaching out than lower FIs; therefore, selecting a lower FI such as 1.05 would perform
better in this regard, even though other product characteristics may be compromised to some degree.
Gelation (or the gel point) is kinetically an iso-conversion point at which the extent of cure (𝛼) remains constant
(i.e., 𝛼gel = constant) for a formulated coating to incept into an immobilized network, irrespective of the applied

cure temperatures. This differs from gel times, which are always temperature dependent. According to rheolog-
ical data (Table 6.5), an infinite FI (i.e., the formulation without hardeners) resulted in a significantly reduced
Tgel at 121.0 ∘C and 𝛼gel at 18.7%, respectively. According to kinetic results, the crosslinker-free batch cured greatly
faster (96.5 sec at 191 ∘C to attain full cure), mostly due to a sizable reduction in Ea to 47,860 J/mol. In addition,
the hardener-free formulation released exotherms up to 68.3 J/g (𝛥H’s in Figure 6.5a) that were much greater
than those of other formulations. The linear regression equation Tg = −0.4918*𝛥H + 83.30 (R2 = 0.989) estab-
lishes an inverse relationship between Tg and enthalpy (𝛥H), or the total heat of crosslinking reactions. Trending
patterns of DSC exothermic curves, specifically the two overlapped peaks observed for FI = 1.20 (the blue curve
in Figure 6.5a), reveal the phase of transition from co-polymerization dominance to homo-polymerization dom-
inance for a given catalyst type and loading. More specifically, it is indicated that the bulk homo-curing occurs
behind the bulk co-polymerization but reacts more rapidly once activated. In addition, the crosslinker-free for-
mulation has a uniquely symmetric exothermic curve (i.e., the pink curve in Figure 6.5a), which suggests that
an infinite stoichiometric ratio resulted in the quickest cure, as the Tpeak shifted to the lowest level at 133.4 ∘C,
attributable to the close-in-value reaction orders. Tpeak, as described by cure kinetics, is the condition at which
the maximum cure rate ( ̇𝛼max) takes place. 𝜂*min increased from 4,511 Pa-s at 122.6 ∘C for FI = 1.05 to 8,339 Pa-s at
111.2 ∘C for FI = ∞(Table 6.5 and Figure 6.5b), indicating a higher viscosity buildup at an even lower temperature,
which is advantageous for sagging resistance and edge coverage.
In particular, FI = 1.20 appeared unique from all other FIs in that epoxy homo-cures and epoxy-hardener
co-polymerization co-dominate, as exhibited by the exothermic curve with two overlapped peaks (refer to the
blue curve in Figure 6.5a) instead of a single peak for all other FIs. By inference, epoxy-hardener reactions
dominated crosslinking at FI = 1.05, followed by co-dominance at FI = 1.20, and epoxy homo-cures monopolized
at FI = ∞, or hardener-free. Still, by inference, epoxy-hardener co-polymerization happened prior to epoxy
homo-polymerization, or the former predominated in the presence of hardeners; epoxy self-crosslinking did not
manifest until epoxy-hardener crosslinking reached a particular stage. In other words, homo-curing occurred
after epoxy-hardener reactions, consistent with and validated in the interim by 𝛼’s at 𝜂*min and gelation (refer
to data in Table 6.5). Coincidentally, it was discovered that FI = 1.20 behaved as an outlier, as previously noted,
although this perhaps mirrored what was fundamentally governed by the genuine transitioning cure complexity
as FI varied. This distinct transient exotherm is dependent on the catalyst employed; an overlapping exothermic
trend was observed at FI = 2.00 when a less reactive imidazole adduct catalyst at a greater amount of 0.94 phr was
substituted. It appears that co-dominant curing reactions occur at a lower FI as the catalytic activity increases.

6 Formulation Case Studies
In sectional conclusion, the shape and pattern of DSC exothermic curves varying from a low to infinite FI
indicate that homo-cures (i.e., corresponding to the second peak of the blue curve in Figure 6.5a) occurred later
than co-polymerization, but they proceeded at a much faster rate once activated, resulting in a faster cure comple-
tion, with FI = 1.20 serving as a critical transition point in this series of formulations (Tables 6.4/6.5), where cure
completion was the fastest when FI = infinity and the slowest when FI = 1.05. For the hardener-free formulation,
DSC revealed the presence of a secondary crosslinking domain with a Tg of 211.9 ∘C out of the generic Tg capacity,
in addition to the primary crosslinking domain with a Tg of 117.0 ∘C under the generic Tg capacity. Production
trial batches confirmed dual Tg values of ∼108.8 and ∼218.5 ∘C across FI levels ranging from 1.05 to 2.00, indicat-
ing that they are not necessarily exclusive to FI = ∞. There is an overall linear relationship between FIs and such
rheological and kinetic parameters as Tgel, 𝜂*min, Tan𝛿, G′
max, 𝜂*max, the flow index, and Ea, excluding data at FI =
1.20. However, there is only a loose or random correlation between FIs and kinetic parameters when data at FI =
1.20 are included. Again, rheologically, FIs not exceeding 1.20 tended to render low viscosity and high flow prior
to gelation (Figure 6.5b) in favor of processing and adhesion; the infinite FI imparted a higher 𝜂* and a narrower
flow window prior to gelation which would be more effective against sagging, especially for heavy coat films.
Figure 6.6 displays DMA and Instron tensile and elongation (or strain) tests conducted on cured films, respec-
tively, where Young’s tensile moduli (E′ and E′′) are reported, whereas DMA rheology on uncured coatings offers
shear moduli (G′ and G′′), and E ≈3G when the coating material is incompressible, as described in Chapter 5.
At a given temperature, the cured film data supplied by Intron are not necessarily as accurate as, but generally
consistent with, those from a DMA rheometer. The tensile modulus E′ at 25 ∘C was determined to be 1.65, 3.74,
2.92, 2.78, and 1.71 GPa at FIs ranging from 1.05 to infinity (Figure 6.6a), respectively. How the strain (𝜀) and the
strain rate ( ̇𝜖) are measured affects the results; for example, the faster the strain rate, the higher the modulus, and
the more rigid or brittle the cured film. As demonstrated, E′ for FI = infinity was lower at temperatures below
Tgs of 105–115 ∘C but higher above Tgs, especially exceeding 125 ∘C; the rubbery state plateau (the pink curve
in Figure 6.6a) persists up to 200 ∘C, indicating the crosslinker-free formulation with the greatest heat resistance
among these five coatings. Comparatively, FI = 1.05 exhibited the lowest heat stability based on its constant yield-
ing E′ across temperatures (falling to 1.10 MPa at 175 ∘C, as seen by the black curve). As shown in Figure 6.6b,
the maximum tensile strength and flexibility (i.e., strain) at break of the respective cured films grew gradually
with increasing FIs or the proportion of etherification-featured epoxy homo-cures increased, as did the Instron
storage modulus E′ (i.e., the slope = 𝛥𝜏
𝛥𝜀; refer to Figure 4.9a in Chapter 4). In general, the relationship between

flexibility and modulus is inverse, whereas the relationship between gouge (i.e., resistance to scratching under
pressure) and modulus is linear. Note that, Instron elongations discussed here relate to tension strains, whereas
the flexibility reported in Table 6.4 refers to bending or shear strains, which are dimensionally different and hence
mathematically different.
In addition, DSC thermal and kinetic responses of BPA-based and novolac epoxy resins in crosslinker-free
systems at identical 2MI catalyst levels (e.g., 0.50 phr) were examined (Figure 6.7a), revealing only slight changes
in enthalpy (𝛥H) and kinetics (which governs cure schedules), as was the case with BPF-based epoxies. Specif-
ically, di-functional BPA-based epoxies exhibited a slightly lower Tg (111.9 versus 117.0 ∘C for epoxy novolacs);
additional catalyst loadings (such as 0.68 phr) allowed further decreases in Ea (corresponding to the horizontal
position of Tpeak) and the reaction order n (defining the later stage of cure after Tpeak), resulting in an expedited
cure completion; the reaction order n was significantly reduced to 0.50 and below when 2MI at 1.00 phr or an
imidazole adduct at 1.46 phr was charged, respectively. Notably, the correlation between the horizontal location
of Tpeak in DSC and the Ea value only applies to formulations comprising the same epoxy and crosslinker (if any)

resin package. In terms of physical properties, crosslinker-free formulations of BPA-based and novolac epoxies at
a given catalyst level may exhibit comparable adhesion and flexibility, for example, 4.42∘/PD for the BPA-based
(#1 in Figure 6.7a) against 4.12∘/PD for the epoxy novolac (refer to Table 6.4), which were not necessarily maxi-
mal either. In one aspect, not infinite but sufficiently high FIs (such as up to 2.00) can be used to formulate epoxy
coatings with super flexibility due to an increase in epoxy self-crosslinking segments inside the cured network.
In another aspect, epoxy coating formulations are often unconcerned with unreacted resin residues in the final
cured film, provided that an appropriate homo-curing catalyst (such as imidazole adducts) is added in a sufficient
quantity to ensure complete resin consumption. In other words, epoxy formulations for generic applications do
not require rigorous stoichiometric control as long as there is an excess of suitably catalyzed epoxies.
In crosslinker-free systems, BPA-based and novolac-based epoxies exhibit similar curing behaviors and cured
performance. More specifically, crosslinker-free epoxy coatings with generic Tgs (≤120 ∘C) have the fastest gel
and cure responses, the highest Tg and modulus for heat resistance, and the highest toughness for impact resis-
tance. Another advantage of crosslinker-free formulations noticed is bulk resin homogeneity, which eliminates
the incompatibility or lack of uniformity between epoxies and crosslinkers. As determined by thermal analysis,
crosslinker-free formulations all have the highest exotherms and reaction order n, but the lowest Ea, without excep-
tion unless, again, catalysts are changed (refer to Appendix A). Homo-polymerization is also identified kinetically
as taking place at a later stage (i.e., at a higher temperature) than co-polymerization, but once initiated, it proceeds
at a much faster rate.
Comparatively, crosslinker-free formulations utilizing high-Tg (greater than 120 ∘C)-capable epoxy resins and
monomers exhibited vastly different thermal gelling, curing behaviors, and cured mechanical properties, as
determined by evaluating EPON 165, a matrix or multi-f monomer, FortegraTM 310 (EEW 472; refer to Figure 1.5
in Chapter 1), an isocyanate-modified resin, SE-250, a di-f fluorene monomer offset to SOGOL PG-100 (EEW
251; refer to Table 1.2b-1 in Chapter 1), and their combinations (such as 83.4% PG-100 and 16.6% FortegraTM
310 by weight, referred to as PG100&FT310 in Table 6.6). These batches were exclusively catalyzed with 2MI
(2-methyl imidazole) at 0.765 or 0.85 phr and were filled at either 25.6 or 30.6% by weight. EPON165 gelled
rapidly at 177/204 ∘C, as shown in Table 6.6, but PG100 &FT310 with a larger catalyst loading level, gelled
more slowly even at a high temperature of 232 ∘C. The final Tgs were 173.8 ∘C for EPON165, 125.5 ∘C for FT310,
194.2 ∘C for SE250, and 190.4 ∘C for the combination, significantly lower than those of their straight loadings,
such as up to 230.0 ∘C for SE250 (or PG100) and 224.5 ∘C for PG100&FT310, which were easily accomplished
by incorporating crosslinkers such as DICY or a specialty fluorene amine at FI = 1.0−2.0 [6]. Considerable Tg
reductions suggest that physical chain entanglements are no longer as important or pronounced as chemical
crosslinking in high-Tg-capable crosslinker-free formulations. Depending on the epoxy resin(s) or monomers used
in these high-Tg formulations without crosslinkers, the finished surface or appearance of cured films was subtly
smooth and varied in gloss. In addition, viscosity, flow, and elastic modulus development varied, depending on the
formulation and the resin or monomer’s initial viscosity and molecular weight (MW), during the curing process
of high-Tg-capable FBE coatings without crosslinkers. When properly formulated, such as a hybrid of FortegraTM
310 and PG100 (i.e., Batch PG100&FT310 consisted of 83.4% and 16.6% by weight, respectively, Table 6.6), the
crosslinker-free coating enabled superior adhesion to steel substrates (as measured by HWA ratings) and stronger
impermeability to moisture (as measured by HWA water uptake at 0.11 g or 1.78% by weight of the coating film
following 28 days of HWA immersion at 95 ∘C).
As observed, in contrast to generic Tg formulations without crosslinkers, which promoted gelation and curing,
high-Tg-capable crosslinker-free formulations using di-f resins or monomers greatly inhibited gelation and curing
compared to their crosslinker-containing equivalents. In comparison, multi-functional epoxies, such as EPON 165,
promoted gel and cure greatly more than di-functional resins and monomers in high-Tg-capable formulations in
the absence of crosslinkers. Under curing is generally of great concern for high-Tg-capable FBE coatings without
crosslinkers, as it is difficult for them to attain full cure without significantly higher cure temperatures and/or
significantly longer cure times, such as 240–250 ∘C for at least 30 min, as opposed to standard cure temperatures

and times, such as 232 ∘C for 10 min, required for their crosslinker-containing formulations (with high-Tg capacity)
to be readily cured completely. The issue of under cure is partially attributed to catalyst decomposition; TGA
data (Figure 5.13b in Chapter 5) demonstrate that DMAP (i.e., di-methyl-aminopyridine) and 2MI rapidly and
completely evaporate at 135 ∘C and 178 ∘C, respectively, rendering them unsuitable catalysts for crosslinker-free
formulations with high-Tg capacity, which require elevated temperatures for cure, at which these catalysts become
ineffective. Imidazole adducts, such as Epikure P-100 or P-101 and Aradur 3088 (better than Aradur 9690), are
preferred as catalysts for curing at high temperatures because their Tonset’s of decomposition are greater than
315.5 ∘C.
In terms of rheological behaviors, these high-Tg-capable and 2MI-catalyzed formulations without crosslink-
ers responded significantly differently in terms of 𝜂*min (minimum complex or dynamic viscosity), gelation, and
vitrification, contingent on the specific resin or monomer in addition to the specific formulation, including the
catalyst utilized. Specifically, 𝜂*min is highly dependent on the catalyzed formulation and the initial properties of
the epoxy resin or monomer, such as its MW, initial viscosity, EEW, functionality, and steric structure. Gelation
(indicated by the crossover between G′ and G′′) for crosslinker-free formulations with a high-Tg capacity above
120 ∘C is highly Tg-dependent. Specifically, the viscoelastic event of gelation, characteristic of thermally curable
coatings, took place at a low extent of crosslinking reaction (𝛼) and before Tpeak when the Tg of a formulation to
be developed is on the lower end or close to 120 ∘C (such as FT310 with 𝛼= 12.9% and Tg = 125.5 ∘C), and at a
high 𝛼and after Tpeak when the Tg is on the higher end or close to 200 ∘C (such as SE250 with 𝛼= 89.9% and
Tg = 194.2 ∘C and PG100&FT310 with 𝛼= 93.4% and Tg = 190.4 ∘C), as exhibited in Figure 6.7c. Higher Tg values

218
6 Formulation Case Studies
corresponded with higher moduli after cure. Homogeneous coatings may still vitrify due to the dynamic Tg versus
Tcure of heterogeneous systems [7] as well as the MW, f, flow, modulus, and gelation onset of epoxies during the
curing process. For these nearly homogeneous, high-Tg-capable formulations, diffusion-dependent vitrification
was typically not a concern, with the exception of FT310 (with a high initial viscosity and modulus over 10 MPa,
the blue curves in Figure 6.7c) at a slow heating rate of 7.0 ∘C/min (the blue curve with two diverging peaks in
Figure 6.7d).
Summarily, the thermal responses of high-Tg (> 120 ∘C)-capable epoxy formulations without crosslinkers are
not universal, defined by the functionality, MWs (EEWs), flow and modulus upon gelation (which occurs before
Tpeak if the Tg is close to 120 ∘C and after Tpeak if the Tg is close to 200 ∘C), steric effects of the resin(s) and/or
monomer(s), and catalyst decomposition, but not necessarily vitrification. These coatings with Tgs around the
upper end of 200 ∘C are characterized by long gelling times (and hence excellent adhesion), while being concerned
about long cure times and inappropriately catalyzed under cure even if a considerably higher Tcure is applied for
an extended time. The risk of under curing increases with an increasing MW and decreasing flowability.
6.2.3
Bisphenol F-based epoxy resins
Bisphenol-F (BPF)-based epoxies are distinguished from bisphenol-A (BPA)-based epoxies by the absence of dual
methyl groups on the otherwise standard structure, as described in Chapter 1, and epoxy novolacs are essentially
brunched BPF epoxies. Due to the mechanisms also described (refer to Figure 1.4 in Chapter 1), novolac and
BPF-based epoxies are supposed to resist concentrated acids or low-pH chemicals, whereas BPA-based epoxies do
not. In consideration of steric effects, BPF-based epoxies should produce coatings with better flexibility and lower
Tg than BPA-based resins from the standpoint of structure-defining properties. This subsection’s experimental
efforts are specifically designed to seek answers to or data-supported validation of these basic hypotheses. DOE
matrices with detailed FBE formulations are presented in Table 6-7, where BPF-based epoxy resins such as Kukdo’s
KD-9x04 (Ts or softening temperature 85–95 ∘C), -9x05 (Ts 90–100 ∘C), and -9x06 (Ts 95–105 ∘C) are compared
with a conventional BPA-based Type 4 epoxy (i.e., EPON 2004) and an epoxy novolac (i.e., KD-213H) as controls.
Specifically, KD-9204 and -9206 are Type 4 and Type 6 BPF-based epoxy resins from Kukdo; KD-9005, and -9006
are likewise Type 5 and Type 6 BPF-based epoxies, but according to the vendor, they are produced using an older
indirect process method different from that used to make KD-9204/6.
There are two sets of four FBE batches, one containing a phenolic resin crosslinker (i.e., KD-427) and the
other containing an amine curing agent (i.e., DICY). FIs were 0.99 for KD-427-based formulations and 1.07
for DICY-based batches, both of which are close to one, indicating that epoxy-crosslinker co-polymerization
predominates in all of these batches, including the control in each group. Since these preliminary formulations
are for screening and competitive analysis propositions, FIs were selected at random. If any crosslinker molecules
remain unconsumed during curing, they are preserved in the cured film as unreacted components. Optimization
of FIs for maximum performance should be prioritized whenever it is determined that a given formula merits
additional investigation in order to lead to an applied solution. Note that AP in Table 6.7 represents an adhesion
promoter that is actually ADH Pro Coup40, a di-functional 𝛾-amino-propyl-tri-ethoxy-silane carried on silica at
65% active, was from Sovereign Technologies, while the wet flow agent was Resiflow PF-67 (Estron Chemical)
and the dry flow agent was Alumina Oxide C (Evonik). The fillers used were generic wollastonite, such as the
obsolete Vansil W20 of Grade 1 Hegman fineness.
Tabulated in Table 6.8 and Figure 6.8 are the results of physical testing, including DSC kinetic characteriza-
tion, on executed batches of uncured FBE powders and their cured films on panels. Comparing Batches #2 and
#5, KD-9006 with a higher MW (derived from f = 2 times EEW) outperforms KD-9206 in flexibility (3.62 versus
2.74∘/PD) and wet adhesion (as indicated by better performance in CDT at both RT and 65 ∘C), while performing
comparably in all other respects except for variations in kinetic-related gel times and cure schedules. As revealed
by DSC (Figure 6.8a), KD-9206 generated more crosslinking heat than KD-9006 (𝛥H = −34.5 versus −26.9 J/g) and

resulted in a faster gel, as indicated by a lower Tonset (101.5 versus 105.9 ∘C); however, KD-9206 does not necessarily
complete cure faster yet as reflected by quantified kinetic parameters and cure schedules (Table 6.8).
Overall, BPF-based epoxies give rise to remarkably lower Tg than BPA-based or novolac epoxies. Lower Tgs
for BPF epoxy-based formulations are anticipated, but the greater extent of Tg reduction by 20 degrees is unex-
pected, namely 81.1 to 83.7 ∘C versus 103.6 ∘C when cured by phenolics (i.e., KD-427) and 84.1 to 89.3 ∘C versus
112.3 ∘C when cured by DICY (Figure 6.8b), respectively. In terms of flexibility, BPF epoxy-based formulations are
significantly inferior to BPA-based epoxies or novolacs regardless of whether the crosslinker is phenolic or amine,
with values of less than 4.0 versus 5.6∘/PD and less than 5.0 versus 7.7∘/PD, respectively. The surprising result
in flexibility completely contradicts the assumption that BPF-based epoxies should enhance flexibility. Consis-
tent with HWA and CDT results, these BPF epoxy-based formulations exhibited excellent adhesion throughout

all batches; Controls I and II exhibited mild and severe blisters with poor and poorer ratings in HWA at 95 ∘C,
respectively, despite having higher Tgs. All BPF epoxy series were rated “1” for HWA at 75 and 95 ∘C due to supe-
rior adhesion. The impact resistance (indicating toughness) of BPF epoxy-based batches was found to be inferior
to that of novolac or BPA-based epoxy batches (Controls I and II, respectively). Control II, cured with DICY, had
the worst measured water uptake.
BPF-based epoxies have lower melting points and viscosities than their BPA-based counterparts at a given
temperature. Pill flows (Table 6.8) and rheology data, including 𝜂*min and the flow index (Table 6.9) for their com-
pounded formulations, are consistent in this regard; low-viscosity complements adhesion. Gel times at a given
catalyst level appear to be slower for phenolic-cured BPF-based epoxy formulations (i.e., Control I, #1, #2, and
#5) and faster for DICY-cured formulations (i.e., Control II, #3, #4, and #6), which are consistent with rheological
gelation data in terms of higher and lower Tgel’s. In contrast to gel times, cure levels (𝛼′s) become much higher
for the phenolic-cured formulations, which are catalyzed by 2MI at 0.62 phr, and much lower for the DICY-cured
formulations, which are instead catalyzed by Epikure P-100 at 1.54 phr. Specifically, the former group corresponds
to 𝛼values of 20.0 to 27.2% at 𝜂*min and 48.8 to 67.9% at gelation, while the latter group corresponds to 𝛼values of

7.70 to 11.9% at 𝜂*min and 24.3 to 34.0% at gelation, respectively. Comparing Tgel versus the temperatures at 𝜂*min
and 𝛼gel versus the 𝛼at 𝜂*min (Table 6.9), gelation (i.e., the crossover of G′ and G′′ according to rheological DMA
data shown in Figure 6.9) obviously takes place after 𝜂*min for all BPF-based epoxy formulations, as well as those
of the two controls. This rheological pattern of 𝜂*min followed by gelation near to or ahead of Tpeak (Figure 6.8)
is characteristic of generic Tg (below 120 ∘C) epoxy formulations, regardless of amine or phenolic cure chemistry.
Figure 6.9 illustrates full rheological DMA profiles conducted at 7.0 ∘C/min, demonstrating similarity in Tan𝛿and
the loss modulus (G′′), but variations or non-similarity in the storage modulus (G′) and the complex viscosity (𝜂*)
depending on the resins, curing agents, and catalysts utilized in the formulations. For example, Batches #2 and
#6 cure completely at 200 ∘C and reach 𝜂*max values of 0.107 and 0.323 MPa-s, which correspond to G′
max values
of 0.672 and 2.030 MPa, respectively; that is to say, Batch #6 gave rise to a sharply higher modulus than Batch #2
did, consistent with Intron tensile and elongation testing (Table 6.9) and tension film mode DMA results on cured
free film samples.
Specifically, DICY is structurally non-rigid but multi-functional, whereas KD-427 (phenolic) is linearly flexible
and di-functional; this explains why DICY-cured formulations appear to result in higher moduli (i.e., E′ on cured
free films and G′ on uncured powder samples) and Tgs than phenolic-cured formulations (Tables 6.8/6.9), as dis-
cussed in detail for comparing #2 and #6. Still specifically, free film DMA results reveal that phenolic batches
Control I, #1, #2, and #5 all had a plateau modulus (E′) of approximately 2.0 MPa, which is nearly five times lower
than DICY batches Control II, #3, #4, and #6 at ∼10 MPa. Summarily, unless properly formulated, BPF-based
epoxy resins may compromise Tg, flexibility, and toughness, regardless of amine or phenolic cure chemistry. Thus,
it is proposed that BPF-based epoxies be employed as an additive resin rather than as a bulk resin in general

formulations. Advantageously, low-viscosity BPF-based epoxies enhance adhesion to better resist moisture under
heat. BPF-based epoxies are excellent in resisting acids, similar to novolac and phenolic resins; BPF-based epoxy
resins are also excellent at resisting alkalis and solvents. Subject to optimization, amine-cured (including DICY)
formulations with appropriately high FIs would be more effective against poor wet adhesion or water sensitivity,
especially under heat, than formulations with lower FIs.
6.2.4
Aliphatic epoxies and silicone-modiﬁed amines
Epikote 760 (EEW 176, Hexion) is a 100% solids liquid di-functional cycloaliphatic epoxy resin, functionally
equivalent to Denacol FCA-640 (EEW 164, Nagase), also known as a di-glycidyl ester (refer to Figure 2.5 in
Chapter 2). To incorporate Epikote 760 as a component of epoxide- or glycidyl-functional resins into FBE powder
formulations for performance evaluation, it was encapsulated with silica into a free-flowing powder at 70% active
prior to premixing. There are varieties of commercially available aliphatic epoxies, including silicone-modified
ES-450 (liquid, EEW 374, Biro Technologies), and KSR-1000 (solid, EEW 1200, f = 4, Kukdo Chemical), among
others. According to Table 6.10, Epikure 760 accounts for 12% of the total resins by weight in both IF-760 and
PC-760 formulations, or close to 40% by molar percentage. Control III and IF-760 as a group were formulated with
phenolic (KD-427) cure chemistry at an FI close to 2.0, whereas Control IV (i.e., essentially Control II from the
previous subsection) and PC-760 as another group were designed with amine (DICY) cure chemistry at an actual
FI = 1.07 and 1.35, respectively. As shown in Table 6.10, catalyst loading levels varied, with 2MI in Control III at
0.62 phr and IF-760 at 0.55 phr and Epikure P-100 in Control IV at 1.54 phr and PC-760 at 0.94 phr, respectively.
Epikote 760, representative of aliphatic and alicyclic epoxies, was found to be more compatible with novolac
epoxy and phenolic systems at up to 12% of all resins by weight in formulations (i.e., Control III and IF-760) than
with BPA-based epoxy and DICY ones; cured films of IF-760 on metal substrates did not develop pinholes on
surfaces, while those of PC-760 did. Addition of Epikote 760 in replacement of a portion of standard aromatic
epoxy resins slows down gel and cure slightly for phenolic cure, but drastically for amine cure, unless the catalyst
loading level is significantly increased. Adding 12% by weight of the Epikote 760 resin to IF-760 and PC-760,
the flexibility was reduced by almost half (i.e., 2.95 versus 5.62∘/PD for Control III) and by more than half (i.e.,
2.64 versus 7.70∘/PD for Control IV), respectively. Both the IF- and PC-760 formulations also exhibited a slight
reduction in impact resistance, an indicator of toughness. Patti pull, which evaluates dry adhesion, was slightly
enhanced, as was dielectric strength. Wet adhesion by HWA at 75 ∘C and 95 ∘C was comparable for phenolic

formulations (rated 2–3 for IF-760 versus 1–3 for Control III), but IF-760 blistered while Control III did not, and
slightly improved for amine formulations (rated 2–3 for PC-760 versus 3–4 for Control IV), but PC-760 blistered
as well. In terms of moisture resistance measured by water uptake at 75 ∘C and 95 ∘C for 28 days, the addition of
Epikote 760 in formulations was 5–10 times poorer than the controls (refer to Table 6.10).
Notably, regardless of whether the formulation is phenolic-based (from a Tg of 108.3 ∘C for Control III to 101.3 ∘C
for IF-760) or amine-based (from a Tg of 112.3 ∘C for Control IV to 103.0 ∘C for PC-760), the addition of aliphatic
epoxies at 12% by weight (replacing aromatic epoxies) resulted in a considerable decrease in Tg (Figure 6.10a).
According to DSC data (Table 6.11) and experimental observations, IF-760 with 12% aliphatic and 88% novolac
epoxies makes a reasonably competitive formulation, free of pinhole defects (seen when Epikote 760 was over-
loaded), with gel and cure times comparable to Control III. In contrast, Epikote 760 formulations containing
amine curing agents resulted in coatings that are difficult to cure, as kinetically indicated by the dull slope, shape,
and tail of the exothermic curve after Tpeak (Figure 6.10a) unless additional catalysts are loaded. This is due to
DICY’s high-melting temperature of up to 208 ∘C. As expected, aliphatic epoxies (lacking aromaticity) react more
slowly, resulting in lower Tg, poorer flexibility, impaired toughness, compromised integrity, and decreased tensile
strength of the cured films when partially incorporated into formulations of otherwise straight aromatic epoxy
resins. Compatibility between aromatic and aliphatic counterparts must be addressed by determining the optimal

loading level of the aliphatic resin(s). There do not appear to be any advantages to incorporating aliphatic epoxies
into standard BPA-based or novolac epoxies, with the exception of improvements in UV resistance for exterior
applications. Inversely, when utilizing structurally aromatic epoxies as an additive resin in bulkily aliphatic epoxy
formulations, these disadvantages are overcome and become more or less favorable; again, an appropriate loading
level should always be screened and applied to minimize or eliminate incompatibility.
In contrast, utilizing the same platform of solvent-free FBEs, the effects of siloxane-modified amines with var-
ied NH equivalent weights (EW-NH) were examined. These amines include SH-120, -180, -240, and -300 (supplied
from Biro Technologies), where the number suffix represents EW-NH. Dowsil 3055 (EW-NH 260, Dow Corning)
is a commercially available amine-functional silicone resin alternative as an epoxy curing agent. Each of these
crosslinkers started out as a liquid; therefore, they were all encapsulated with a silica carrier to turn each of them
into a 90% active free-flowing powder before compounding. As tabulated (Table 6.12), formulations were exclu-
sively based on a standard BPA-based Type 4 epoxy, that is, EPON 2004, at a constant FI of 2.22 for all, a level

at which epoxy homo-polymerization is believed to account for a considerable proportion of the overall curing
reactions. In each of these four formulations, the level of an imidazole adduct catalyst (i.e., Epikure P-100) was
at 0.993 phr, as was the filler loading of 27.5% (including the silica from each of the encapsulated hardeners)
and other components. Consequently, the only formulation variation was the hardeners, whose loading levels by
weight changed in accordance with their equivalent weights. Figure 6.10b and Table 6.12, respectively, illustrate
the DSC results and physical properties of these FBEs.
The glass transition temperature (Tg), which is all close to 110 ∘C (Figure 6.10b), decreases slightly with silicone
amines’ EW-NH, as does the heat of reaction (𝛥H), which is all about −53.5 J/g, with the exception of SH-300′s,
which is noticeably lower at −47.3 J/g. Tpeak and Tonset from DSC conducted at 7.0 ∘C/min are rather stable for
all batches at ∼143.0 and ∼125.0 ∘C, respectively. From a kinetic standpoint, Ea increases gradually with EW-NH,
whereas m decreases somewhat and n increases slightly. Overall, the shortest cure time to 𝛼= 99.9% at 232 ∘C is
168.0 sec for SH-120 (i.e., EW-NH of 120), and the longest is 259.2 sec for SH-300 (i.e., EW-NH of 300). In terms of
physical performance (Table 6.12), SH-120 demonstrated the highest levels of flexibility and impact resistance at

6.07∘/PD and 50–60 lb-in, respectively, compared to the three other equivalent weight alternatives, whose values
were lower. HWA testing at 95 ∘C, with the exception of SH-300 (not determined due to severe pinhole finishes),
was rated “1” for excellent adhesion and blister-free; meanwhile, moisture resistance, as indicated by water uptake
measured using encapsulated 4′′ × 4′′ × 1/4′′ panels, gradually improved with equivalent weights, all at levels supe-
rior to standard amine-cured FBEs (refer to water uptake for Control II in Table 6.8 and Control IV in Table 6.10)
but inferior to standard phenolic-cured formulations (refer to Controls I and III). Specifically, and as observed,
SH-240 had the best wet adhesion and performed the best as an applied formulation, followed by SH-180. Dowsil
3055 was evaluated competitively in a separate batch and found to perform similarly to SH-240 in general.
In summary, incompatibility is a crucial aspect to consider in cases of formulation amendments in which
modified epoxy or crosslinker resins (e.g., Epikote 760 and SH-240, respectively) are partially or bulkily integrated
for the purpose of achieving potential synergies. Such reactive resin constituents are not restricted to glycidyl
esters (i.e., one class of aliphatic epoxies) or siloxane amines, as assessed, but are also applicable to many others,
such as acrylic- and rubber-modified epoxies, the compatibility of which should always be determined in advance
because some are more compatible than others. In essence, modified resins comprise secondary domains in
the bulk phase that inevitably change bulk properties in either an adverse or beneficial way, which must be
minimized or optimized for intended applications. Offered as another argument, for example, FortegraTM 304
(EEW 1,005, Olin), a toughening epoxy resin derived from polyol modifications, is found to be more compatible
with bulk BPA-based epoxies than FortegraTM 104 (EEW 1,010, Olin), a toughening epoxy resin modified by
PEP-PEO di-block copolymers; consequently, the former provides greater improvements in toughness, flexibility,
and adhesion for some high-performance coatings, such as rebar FBE powders.
6.2.5
Active ester crosslinkers
Active esters crosslinking epoxies is not a brand-new concept, but they are undervalued in industrial and applied
coatings, where conventional amine and phenolic hardeners are favored. As illustrated in Figure 6.11a, there
is a growing interest in diverse active ester compounds as epoxy curing agents for an array of applications,
such as making copper clad laminates (CCLs), high-Tg printed circuit boards (PCB) products, low-dielectric
tangent (Df) prepreg, and adhesive films [8–10], primarily due to the elimination of the polar aliphatic
(secondary-substituted) hydroxyls in the backbone of the cured epoxy-active ester polymeric systems. In addition,
niche ester compounds as epoxy curing agents are reported or under investigation, such as phosphate ester
compounds for flame-retardant features [11], poly-functional TAB (triacetoxybenzene), TPCP (tetraphenoxycar-
bonyl pentaerythritol), dicyclopentadiene (DCPD)-derived polyarylates, and PC1300-02-65MA (dual functional:
EW-active ester 199, EW-vinyl 1,400, Figure 6.11b, Ajinomoto) for high Tg and low-dielectric CCLs with excellent
adhesion to conductive substrates [12–14], among others. In contrast to cyanate esters, which react with epoxies
to produce oxazolines (refer to Figure 3.5a in Chapter 3), active esters behave substantially like reactive phenolic,

substituted phenolate, or phenoxide compounds. However, both classes of esters (i.e., cyanate esters and active
esters) are notably different from proton-donating anionic amines and cationic phenolics (refer to Figure 2.1 and
Table 2.3a in Chapter 2), both of which react with epoxies to create new secondary OH groups. As previously
noted, these aliphatic OH groups can be further crosslinked by epoxides [15], isocyanates, melamine, and silanols
in the presence of catalysts and/or at elevated temperatures. Moreover, mono- or di-functional glycidyl esters (e.g.,
CarduraTM acid scavengers or diluents) readily react their active glycidyl groups with, for example, methacrylic
acid (MAA) under controlled conditions, generating primary (or 1∘-substituted) rather than secondary aliphatic
hydroxyls (refer to Figures 2.5a/b in Chapter 2). Multiple product qualities, including adhesion, hydrophobicity,
and dielectric, among others, may be drastically altered by the elimination of such polar and hydrophilic −OH
groups.
In this subsection, a couple of active phenyl esters, including HPC-8000 (EW-ester 223 at 100% solids,
Figure 6.11c, DIC), SHC-5900 (EW-ester 225 at 100% solids, Shin-A T&C) as a drop-in offset to HPC-8000, and
EC-312 (EW-ester 163 g/eq, Figure 6.11d, Designer Molecules), were investigated using FBE formulations in
order to determine the structural performance of active ester crosslinked epoxy systems. EPON 2004 (EEW
925) as a standard BPA-based epoxy resin and KD-213H (EEW 800) as an epoxy novolac resin were used in
formulations; meanwhile, KD-405 (EW-PhOH 250, Kukdo Chemical) as a BPA-based phenolic crosslinker was
employed for comparisons wherever applicable. Specifically, HPC-8000 is a multi-functional active ester with
a MW of approximately 1,100, resulting in a theoretical functionality (f) ≈5, and a softening temperature of
150 ∘C; it was initially dissolved in toluene at 65% solids as received and completely solvent purged prior to any
FBE premixing. Instead, EC-312 is a bi-functional phenyl ester in powder form with a MW of 312.4 and a melting
temperature of about 93 ∘C. The ester’s reactivity is determined by the presence of aromatic moieties, specifically
the phenyl or phenolic structures; in other words, analogous chemically and structurally to phenolics in the form
of Ar−O-H (weakly acidic, pKa > 10.0), active esters as epoxy crosslinkers possess Ar−O−(C=O)−R′ linkages to
be reactive toward oxiranes under heat and catalysis of, for example, tertiary amine compounds. According to the
illustration (Figure 6.11a), the simple reaction stoichiometric ratio of oxiranes to active esters is 1: 1 (assuming
no epoxy homo-cures or 100% co-polymerization), generating one new ester linkage (as circled in Figure 6.11a)
rather than one conventional 2∘-substituted aliphatic hydroxyl (OH) from a single epoxy-amine or -phenolic
reaction. Additional modifications to −Ar and/or −R′ are obviously optional, such as −R′ containing an aromatic
structure that supposedly improves latency and heat resistance during and after thermal curing, respectively.
Without limiting to theory, OH groups in uncured resins and cured polymers advantageously impart dry adhe-
sion to, for example, steel substrates via H-bonding; however, the hydrophilicity of OHs likely impairs wet adhe-
sion, which is viewed as crucial to corrosion resistance. In addition, polar OHs have a negative impact on chemical
resistance and dielectric properties; the dielectric constant (Dk) and dissipation factor (Df) both rise adversely with
absorbed water. For circuit board laminates, in-vehicle applications, and a variety of other uses, low Dk and Df val-
ues and high moisture resistance are always desirable characteristics. Moisture absorption is regarded as one of
the most important causes of delamination [11]. Crosslinking epoxides with active phenyl esters is an effective
method for removing OHs and reducing polarity from the crosslinked network.
Table 6.13 contains comprehensive physical and kinetic data, including HWA at 75 and 95 ∘C and CDT at room
temperature and 65 ∘C, respectively. HPC-8000 with aromatic moieties in −R′ demonstrated excellent adhesion
at both FIs 1.05 and 2.00, as determined by HWA ratings and Patti pull (more than 65 psi with cohesive glue fail-
ure without exception), in accordance with CDT results. Even at 95 ∘C, the standard phenolic formulation using
KD-405 exhibited superior adhesion and water resistance. Nevertheless, EC-312 with aliphatic moieties in −R′
was inferior in all aspects, including flexibility, Tg, and HWA failure at 75 ∘C in 9 days due to severe swelling,
blistering, and delamination. Historically, water retention in cured epoxy films has been reported [5]; statistically,
generic amine-cured FBE products of Tg ≤115 ∘C absorb 5–12% of water in 28 days at 75 ∘C HWA and 15–30%
at 95 ∘C, respectively; switching to hydrophobic epoxies and phenolic cure chemistry reduces water absorption
to 2.5–5.0%. For HPC-8000 evaluated at two respective FI levels, FI = 1.05 (i.e., close to the 1: 1 molar ratio)

fared better than FI = 2.00 in terms of impact resistance, HWA, and CDT. After voltage breakdown testing, it
was observed that these two HPC-8000 formulations did not leave any burning marks on panels. Regarding DSC
exotherms (Figure 6.12) and cure kinetics (Table 6.13), active ester formulations led to reduced Tg, Tpeak, Tonset,
and Ea, regardless of aromatic HPC-8000 or aliphatic EC-312. Particularly, HPC-8000 was tested to increase Tg
from 100.3 ∘C at FI = 1.05 to 104.6 ∘C at FI = 2.00, on par with KD-405, and to kinetically cure much faster due to
a reduction in Ea and the reaction order n. Cure acceleration as FI grows appears to be consistent with the extent
of cure (𝛼) levels at Tpeak’s, that is, increasing from 𝛼= 59.5% at FI 1.05 to 𝛼= 74.9% at FI 2.00.
Figure 6.12 and Table 6.14 detail the DSC exothermic and DMA rheological data for active ester formulations
in comparison to the phenolic formulation described in Table 6.13. Comparatively, G′
max upon full cure was
the highest for an amine-based cure (4.56 MPa, from separate experiments), followed by the phenolic-based
cure at 2.90 MPa, and the active ester cure the least (1.48 MPa for FI = 1.05 in Figure 6.12b and 2.10 MPa for
FI = 2.00, respectively), correlated to Tg at the same FI level of 1.05. As far as HPC-8000 is concerned, Tg at
FI = 2.00 was approximately 4.3 degrees higher than that at FI = 1.05 (Figure 6.12a); 𝜂*min including the contin-
gent 𝛼and temperature at 𝜂*min remained close for FI = 1.05 and 2.00, as did the flow index; moduli at gelation
(i.e., where G′ = G′′) nearly doubled at FI = 2.00 compared to FI = 1.05, despite the fact that Tgel was slightly
different, with 𝛼gel = 63.4% at FI = 2.00 and 𝛼gel = 53.4% at FI = 1.05. Active ester formulations gelled after 𝜂*min
regardless of FIs (Figure 6.12b and Table 6.14), comparable to the phenolic formulation in spite of varying catalyst
loading levels.

Three-phase autoclave testing (refer to Figure 4.12 in Chapter 4) at 3,500 psi and 300 ∘F for 24 hours revealed
that HPC-8000 as a single direct-to-metal (DTM) coating applied onto blasted steel panels remained perfectly intact
in the bottom salty aqueous phase but blistered in the middle hydrocarbon phase and became brittle in the top
supercritical CO2 phase, although there was no delamination. Comparatively, existing ID drill pipe platform FBE
products in conjunction with a primer have a tendency to blister severely in the aqueous phase despite remaining
structurally intact in the upper two phases. In this sense, active esters appear to impart greater DTM adhesion and
salt immersion resistance. Overall, it was determined that HPC-8000 and SHC-5900 promote adhesion, dimen-
sional stability (i.e., low coefficient of thermal expansion, or CTE), toughness, hydrophobicity, and dielectric
strength, as well as low moisture absorption at temperatures not exceeding 75 ∘C (Table 6.13 and Figure 6.13a).
However, FBE coatings formulated with these active esters cannot withstand moisture or water at 95 ∘C or above,
resulting in severe swelling. This is because polyester linkages are structurally susceptible to detrimental hydrol-
ysis, which occurs slowly at ambient temperature but is accelerated at elevated temperatures and in the presence
of acids or bases. Additionally, phenolic-derived active esters are compatibly soluble in epoxy resins and are
latent based on their melting points (e.g., HPC-8000 does not melt until temperatures of 150 ∘C and higher). In
hybrid cure systems, unlike phenolic hardeners with Ph-OH functions, phenyl active esters do not interfere with

free radical cure (e.g., vinyl by peroxides) if applied. According to a competitive assessment, 2MI (pKb = 6.14)
is an effective catalyst in active ester formulations; however, catalysts with a stronger basicity, such as DMAP
(dimethyl-aminopyridine, pKb = 4.48), should be more efficient as an accelerator [13].
DSC comparisons of formulations containing EPON 2004, a conventional BPA-based epoxy resin, and KD-213H,
a standard epoxy novolac resin, cured by HPC-8000, an aromatic active ester, at an identical FI of 1.05 and catalyst
loading level of 1.10 phr are displayed in Figure 6.13b. Both coatings exhibited excellent adhesion to blasted steel
substrates and high direct impact resistance. The novolac formulation produced considerably higher crosslinking
density than the BPA epoxy formulation, as indicated by Tg (i.e., 111.4 ∘C versus 100.3 ∘C) and enthalpy (−60.5 J/g
versus −54.68 J/g); the former also appeared to cure more quickly than the latter, as indicated by lower Tpeak
(129.5 ∘C versus 140.4 ∘C) and Tonset (94.5 ∘C versus 96.2 ∘C); cure schedules were suitably established to be two
and three minutes at 450 ∘F (or 232 ∘C) without quenching, respectively.
In addition, high-Tg epoxy formulations, for example, using SOGOL PG-100 and FortegraTM 310 resin blends of
83.4 and 16.6% by weight, respectively, resulted in Tg of 152.4 ∘C when cured by HPC-8000 at FI = 1.05, which
was significantly lower than Tg of up to 227.8 ∘C when cured by a conventional amine such as DICY (refer to
Subsection 6.2.7). The cured films were extremely brittle and rigid (i.e., too little flexibility or too much dimen-
sional stability), shattering immediately upon quenching in tap water. Consequently, active ester curing agents
of epoxies perform inferior to amines in terms of Tg greater than 120 ∘C and flexibility (refer to Table 6.13), and
they are recommended only for generic Tg (under 120 ∘C) coating formulations, unless flexibility is a secondary
or dimensional stability is a more important attribute to achieve in conjunction with a moderate Tg. Summar-
ily, active esters, particularly aromatic grades such as HPC-8000 and SHC-5900, when properly formulated as
hardeners for general Tg epoxy coatings at optimized FIs, impart excellent adhesion, dielectric strength (refer to
Table 6.13), dimensional stability, and moisture resistance at moderate temperatures (not exceeding 75 ∘C), making
them perhaps ideal for electric insulation applications such as busbars.

1.5/1.15a/b in Chapter 1, respectively) in terms of both the structure and functionality. Theoretically, 1,3-PBO
thermally and/or catalytically reacts with carboxyl groups (R-COOH) at 80–100 ∘C to form amide-ester bonds,
with epoxy’s glycidyl ethers to form amide-ether linkages (Figure 6.14a), most likely with aromatic thiols (Ar-SH),
with bismaleimides [16], and perhaps with resole phenolics (though this remains to be validated). No gel at
350 ∘F or 400 ∘F and no DSC exotherm were experimentally observed or detected for their formulation at a 1-to-1
molar ratio and catalyzed by ZnAcAc (refer to PBO-XL2 in Table 6.15), disapproving the existence of crosslinking
reactions between PBO and BPA-based phenolic resins (Figure 6.14b) such as KD-448 (EW-PhOH 700).
It is claimed that 1,3-PBO functions as crosslinkers and adhesion promoters in thermosetting systems, as well
as reactive compatibilizers in thermoplastic systems [17]. As a specialty crosslinker for epoxies, 1,3-PBO resins are
commercially supplied by several vendors, including Evonik and Nippon Shokubai’s EpocrosTM, among others.
A set of two FBE formulations and subsequent testing results are collected in Table 6.15, confirming PBO-epoxy
reactions (Figure 6.14a) but denying PBO-phenolic reactions (Figure 6.14b). Specifically, the PBO-XL1 formulation
of 1,3-PBO and epoxy novolac (i.e., KD-213H) at FI = 1.046 and catalyzed by Epikure P-100 at 0.678 phr exhibited

normal gel times, fill flows, a relatively low Ea of 47,400 J/mol, and relatively high values in the reaction orders m
and n. More specifically, and considering its cure kinetic behaviors, cure reactions take place rather quickly before
Tpeak (corresponding to the reaction order m = 0.85), while the rate greatly slows down after Tpeak, as indicated by
the reaction order n, which reaches as high as 1.65. As a result, overall cure times are predictable at 456.0 sec and
practically determined as eight minutes at 450 ∘F (a little longer than regular FBE formulations cured by amines
such as DICY or phenolics such as KD-405), flexibility is slightly low, and impact resistance ends up being close
to normal or somewhat lower as well.
Figure 6.15 displays the corresponding DSC exothermic curves and Tg. As observed, Tg determined by DSC run
at 20.0 ∘C/min (i.e., the second scan in Figure 6.15) was 95.5 ∘C, whereas Tg was 103.9 ∘C when the initial scan
of cure was carried out at 20.0 ∘C/min (instead of 7.0 ∘C/min). This suggests, on the one hand, that the heating
rate or cure temperature has a significant impact on the extent of crosslinking or the final cured Tg; faster heat-
ing or higher cure temperatures, such as 450 ∘F rather than 400 ∘F or below, are preferred in practice. On the
other hand, it is reaffirmed that the epoxy resin selection, and not the crosslinker, is crucial to achieving high-Tg
performance. The amount of exothermic heat released was 26.4 J/g, which is slightly lower than the 30–40 J/g typ-
ically observed in FBE formulations using Type 7 or higher epoxy resins and significantly lower than the 50–70 J/g
typically observed in FBE formulations containing Types 4 and 5 epoxy resins. The results of HWA tests (Table 6.15)
suggest that amide-ether linkages in the cured PBO-epoxy polymer network are vulnerable to water erosion at
temperatures over 75 ∘C, similar to active esters. In contrast, the PBO-XL2 formulation of 1,3-PBO and KD-448,
a high-MW BPA-based phenolic resin, at FI = 1.013 and catalyzed by ZnAcAc at 0.678 phr gave rise to no cure
reaction advancement.
As a crosslinker, 1,3-PBO, when appropriately formulated, can offer viable epoxy coating formulations
with normal properties, including cure dynamics and Tg. However, 1,3-PBO cannot develop a Tg greater
than 110–120 ∘C; moreover, PBO-crosslinked epoxy coatings may have poor water resistance unless exposed
temperatures are maintained at 75 ∘C or below.

6.2.7
Fluorene monomers for heat-resistant coatings
Super high Tg (greater than 180 ∘C, especially those exceeding 200 ∘C) epoxy formulations for outstanding
heat-resistant performance, including increasingly growing HTHP applications, are a challenging quest,
particularly when the underlying systems require sufficient flexibility, toughness, and adhesion simultaneously.
As disclosed in a patent [6], low-molecular-weight di- or multi-functional fluorene (not fluorine or fluorinated
but containing highly aromatic fluorenyl cardo groups) epoxy monomers, such as OGSOL PG-100 and CG-500,
commercially offered by Osaka Gas Chemical (OGC for short; refer to Tables 1.2b/c in Chapter 1), have been
investigated thus far to outperform any counterparts in this regard, exhibiting achievable Tgs of up to 250 ∘C if
properly formulated. Those counterparts include, among others, EPON 165 (f 5.5–6.0), specialty epoxies such
as isocyanate-modified FortegraTM 310 (EEW 472, Ts 111.0 ∘C, Olin), and SEY-5310 (EEW 321 g/eq, Ts 102.4 ∘C,
Shin-A T&C; refer to Figure 1.5a in Chapter 1).
For general-purpose formulations, standard BPA-based and novolac epoxies with functionality (f) of two
and less than three or four, respectively, often result in cured Tgs below 120 ∘C, including the crosslinker-free
scenarios as detailed in Subsection 6.2.2. Regardless of the curing agent employed, multi-functional epoxies
are commonly used to produce coating formulations with Tgs above 120 ∘C that require increased crosslinking
density. Multi-functional or matrix epoxy resins or monomers are typically low MWs and widely available,
such as tri-functional Tactix 742, tetra-functional THPE, TGDDM, and EPON 165; nonetheless, maximum Tgs
surpassing 180–200 ∘C are rarely attained, perhaps without exceptions. In addition, coatings produced by them,
even when unfilled, are susceptible to impact shock damage or have poor toughness because of the low MWs
between crosslinked points.
As an intrinsic material property, Tg resembles a thermodynamic second-order transition because there is a
DSC-detectable heat capacity (Cp) jump across a temperature range of the Tg [18], at which the glassy state of
a thermoset changes into a rubbery or melt state, a threshold for bulk mechanical and chemical properties of
coatings to persist, degrade, or collapse. It should be noted that Tg, as determined by DMA (on cured films), is
referred to as the relaxation temperature and is frequently overestimated in comparison to that determined by
DSC. Tg is a crucial concept since it defines the maximum temperature at which various polymers can be used.
In one aspect, the toughness of an epoxy coating tends to increase with Tg up to a certain point, after which (e.g.,
at 120–150 ∘C) it decreases unless the system is suitably toughened [19]. In another aspect, flexibility and Tg are
often inversely proportional; the higher the Tg above a specific threshold, the less flexible the cured coating.
In essence, fluorene monomers, including the oxirane-, oxetane-, amine-, and phenyl hydroxyl functional
monomers/oligomers (refer to Tables 1.2b/c and Figure 1.11e in Chapter 1, and Tables 2.2h/2.4d in Chapter 2,
respectively), possess three-dimensional and bulky ring structures, as well as crowded and steric arrangements of
physical symmetry between a pair of functional groups. Their structures are substantially different from conven-
tional epoxy and crosslinker resins of simple linearity or brunchness, resulting in exceptional structural properties
that will be described in this subsection. There have been reports of fluorene epoxies for applications such as
injection molding, PCBs [20–23], and liquid functional coatings [24]. Here, innovative epoxy powder coatings, or
FBEs, formulated with fluorene monomers are highlighted for their unrivaled performance attributes. As listed in
Table 6.16, epoxy-functional PG-100, SE-250 (equivalent to PG-100), CG-500, and WHR-991S (refer to Table 1.2d
in Chapter 1) were investigated as binder resins, while amine-functional BAF and phenolic-functional BPF,
BCF, and PPP-BP consisting of highly aromatic phthalide cardo groups (refer to Table 2.4e in Chapter 2) were
investigated as crosslinkers, respectively. Please note that the di-functional WHR-991S and PPP-BP phenolics
both have asymmetric structures of polarity and hydrophilicity that distinguish them from structurally symmetric
fluorenes that are rather non-polar and hydrophobic. Particularly, a PG-100 monomer sample was analyzed
by GPC light scattering and perchloric acid titration, respectively, to establish its di-functionality based on its
measured MW of 468 and EEW of 251; this should be applicable to all registered monomers of interest herein;
in other words, these fluorene compounds are monomeric molecules, not oligomers or resins, as specified.

From an application standpoint, epoxy coatings that are capable of withstanding temperatures as high as 250 ∘C
while maintaining effective mechanical and chemical protection are increasingly pursued by industries such as
microelectronics, power control, automotive, and construction. Overall, enabling polymers and materials are
scarce. Silicone and inorganic coatings likely account for a portion of end applications with service temperatures
exceeding 250 ∘C, which will be described in Chapter 9 of the non-epoxy platforms. This subsection focuses
on advanced epoxy-based formulations that simultaneously address challenges requiring high Tg, flexibility,
toughness, and adhesion as a one-stop solution.
FTIR spectra (Figure 6.16a) reveal that PG-100 out of fluorene epoxies is comparable to EPON 2004, a BPA-based
epoxy, in terms of IR signals, with the exception of a few peaks at 729, 745, and 913 cm−1 corresponding to the
distinctive fluorene structure; however, PG-100′s IR peaks are very different from those of FortegraTM 310
(isocyanate-modified) and CG-500 (naphthalene-based fluorene), both of which exhibit the existence of extra
peaks in the fingerprint region of 650 to 1,600 cm−1. Preliminary formulation mapping effects of fluorene epoxy
monomers cured by DICY on Tg and flexibility using an FBE platform formulation (Figure 6.16b) revealed that
PG-100 enables Tg from 200 ∘C to 250 ∘C to be capably formulated depending on its loading level from less than
30 to 100% in the resin package, respectively, with FortegraTM 310 accounting for the remaining parts of epoxies.
SE-250 was evaluated to be competitive with PG-100; CG-500 was found to be more capable than PG-100 of
formulating even higher Tgs consistent with its bulkier naphthalene structure; Olin’s experimental XZ19646
epoxy resin (EEW 295, Tm ∼110 ∘C) was capable of achieving maximal Tg up to 206.9 ∘C when used at 100%
loading; so was Shin-A T&C′s SEY-5310 up to 202.3 ∘C. Using FortegraTM 310, PG-100, and CG-500 at 100% loading
each in the underlying formulation allowed for maximum Tg values of 165.0, 231.2, and 250.0 ∘C, respectively.
At a given filler loading (including the moisture absorber CaO, if any) of 26.2% by weight of the total formula,
flexibility decreased gradually as Tg increased, and the downward trend leveled off at approximately 2.00∘/PD for
a resin package consisting of 100% PG100 and no FortegraTM 310 in the formulation.
Multi-functional epoxies (e.g., EPON 165) or modified epoxies (e.g., FortegraTM 310), however, have yet to achieve
such high-Tg levels exceeding 200 ∘C as di-functional fluorene epoxies, indicating extremely high crosslinking
density formed and presumably driven by entanglements of the densely stacked structures of PG-100 and CG-500
between two crosslinked domains. CG-500 in place of PG-100 (i.e., the #2 formulation in Table 6.17) fulfilled Tg
as high as 243.4 ∘C at an identical loading level of 83.4%, roughly 20 degrees higher than PG-100′s under identical
formulation parameters, which include the resin ratio of fluorene monomers to FortegraTM 310 by weight, the
FI, DICY as the crosslinker, and the catalyst loading. When a relatively low-MW BPA-based phenolic crosslinker
such as DEH 84 (containing about 2% of 2MI by weight) was substituted for DICY while FI was also adjusted
accordingly (because phenolics per se have little catalytic effect on curing like DICY does), Tg decreased to 137.0 ∘C

for PG-100, accounting for 64.0% by weight of resins, and 146.6 ∘C for CG-500, accounting for 68.4% by weight of
resins, corresponding to the #3 and #4 formulations in Table 6.17, respectively. In fact, it has been verified that
the achievable Tg of phenolic-cured fluorene epoxies is invariably at a level on par with DICY’s when the loading
levels of PG-100 or CG-500 in the system are matched up to 83.4%. By using BAF, a specialty amine-functional
fluorene monomer, as the crosslinker in place of DICY, Tg up to 244.8 ∘C was maintained, which is on par with
DICY’s (i.e., the #5 and #2 formulations, respectively). Explicitly, epoxy resins or monomers are recognized as
playing a far more critical role in Tg potential development than crosslinkers.
In addition to high-Tg values, it was found that fluorene epoxies, when used as the bulk resin in formulation,
regardless of whether the crosslinker was an amine or a phenolic, confer exceptional toughness as measured by
impact resistance of 80 up to 160 lb-in (the testing maximum) and water impermeability as measured by water
uptake in HWA at 95 ∘C for 28 days of as little as 8.32 g/m2 (Table 6.17). When compared to these results, the
impact resistance and water uptake of standard FBE coatings formulated with BPA-based or novolac epoxies
cured by amines or phenolics are typically 40–60 lb-in and 64.6–107.6 g/m2 (refer to Table 7.9 in Chapter 7),
respectively, all at ∼12 mil DFT and under the same testing conditions. Flexibility of the cured coatings at ∼12
mil DFT on steel panels turned out to be greater than 2.00∘/PD at 26.2% filler loading by weight when PG-100 was
at 83.4% by weight in the resin package, that is, the #1 formulation in Table 6.17, meeting and exceeding super
high-end ID drill pipe specifications including Tg greater than 200 ∘C, flexibility greater than 2.00∘/PD, and impact
resistance greater than 50 lb-in combined. One such high-Tg ID drill pipe liner now on the market is TK-505,
manufactured by Tuboscope. Filler loading PVC reduction in formulation is a suitable means of gaining additional
flexibility, and, as has been demonstrated previously, FI optimization at a given resin package is also helpful.
Table 6.18 collects the results of kinetic DSC and rheological DMA (all exclusively conducted at 7.0 ∘C/min
unless otherwise specified) on these fluorene monomer-based formulations listed in Table 6.17, disclosing dis-
tinctive behaviors associated principally with the fluorene-driven high-Tg characteristic. Specifically, the following
observations and conclusions can be drawn with regard to the #1 PG100-DICY formulation: i) the DSC exothermic
curve (Figure 6.17a) has a lengthy tail typical of a large value of the reaction order n = 1.68 (Table 6.18), suggesting
that an extended cure time is required; ii) 𝜂*min at 126.1 ∘C and 𝛼= 6.1% drops to as low as 33.7 Pa-s, indicating
strong flow for adhesion and warning against sagging; iii) the gel point takes place at 158.0 ∘C with 𝛼gel = 67.6%

after Tpeak at 149.2 ∘C (𝛼= 43.9%) and well after 𝜂*min, showing a flow window till gelation sufficient enough for
adhesion development; iv) broken G′′ and Tan𝛿profile curves indicate vitrification occurs around 200 ∘C (perhaps
starting at 171.2 ∘C when the G′′ and Tan𝛿peaks both tend to diverge, and ending or devitrifying at 224.6 ∘C where
local G′′
max is retained), implying that a faster heating rate to a high enough cure temperature greater than Tg is
preferred to avoid vitrification, which is a diffusion rather than kinetically controlled stage adversely halting or
slowing down cure reactions; and v) the final Tg of the coating (i.e., 224.3 ∘C by DSC) can be estimated from the
onset of the 𝜂* curve at 226.6 ∘C and the onset of the G′ curve after the maximum plateaus.
Vitrification and de-vitrification are not necessarily exclusive to high-Tg formulations of heterogeneity but are
more distinctive to them due to temperature dependence; vitrification is typically indicated by the loss modulus
G′′ of dual peaks of divergence or discontinuity in between and by the Tan𝛿curve of similar signals as well. For
the PG-100-based laddering formulations (Figure 6.16b), the one with Tg = 208.1 ∘C or PG-100 of 30% in the total
resins avoided vitrification, or it barely occurred for a short period of time when run at 7.0 ∘C/min, while the one
with Tg = 214.0 ∘C (i.e., PG-100 of 50%) exhibited vitrification as signaled by dual but continuous G′′ peaks. If
severe vitrification is occurring, it will show up as a break or discontinuity in the G′′ and Tan𝛿curves, as seen in
Figure 6.17b. In conclusion, the greater the Tg, the more probable it is that a coating will suffer due to vitrification;
thus, a higher temperature and a faster heating rate should be utilized to cure such coatings.
Still specifically, and rheo-kinetically, the #2 CG500-DICY formulation exhibited 𝜂*min as low as 18.45 Pa-s, a
flow index as high as 14.15 1/Pa (Table 6.18-#2), and a wide flow window prior to gelation, all of which justify a

super adhesion to be attained. In addition to gelation that also occurred after Tpeak and 𝜂*min, another common
characteristic is rapid cure after 𝜂*min at 174.9 ∘C, which accelerates crosslinking reactions to reach Tpeak at 202.8 ∘C
and 𝛼= 43.9% in less than four minutes and to the gel point at 212.8 ∘C and 𝛼= 76.8% in 1.4 min more. However,
fast cure does not necessarily translate into fast-cure completion; such high-Tg (243.4 ∘C, Figure 6.17c) coatings of
heterogeneity require higher cure temperatures and longer cure times to achieve a sufficient cure level or avoid
under cure, without exception. Although this formulation is still vulnerable to vitrification, it is less severe than
that of PG100-DICY due to the diverged but not yet broken G′′ and Tan𝛿curves, which is likely ascribed to the
formulation’s lower modulus, as demonstrated by G′
max (135.0 versus 246.6 MPa, Table 6.18). Comparing the cure
level at 𝜂*min, that is, 0.02% versus 6.1%, it is shown that the initial cure rate before 𝜂*min for the #2 CG500-DICY
formulation is much slower, affecting the viscosity and moduli very marginally and to a much lesser extent than
the #1 PG100-DICY formulation.
Still specifically, considering fluorene epoxy-phenolic formulations (i.e., #3 and #4 in Tables 6.17/6.18), their
thermograms and rheo-kinetic behaviors, as shown in Figure 6.18 for the #3 formula, are typical of systems with
a moderate Tg, for example, from 120 ∘C to 180 ∘C. Based on DSC kinetic analysis, the exothermic curve does not
have a tail after Tpeak (Figure 6.18a), which is in agreement with the reaction order n = 1.09, which is close to
one. DMA rheological analysis shows that there is no more vitrification occurring either (Figure 6.18b), hence a
heating rate of 7.0 ∘C/min is sufficient to ensure curing without vitrification. Sequentially, the #3 powder coating
melts and flows under heat, arriving at its 𝜂*min at 107.0 ∘C and 𝛼= 14.7% first, reaching Tpeak at 131.5 ∘C and 𝛼=
59.2% next, and getting to the gel point at 155.1 ∘C and 𝛼= 95.1% (where G′ and G′′ cross over), which is a stage
close to full cure. The Tan𝛿peak is observed at 143.7 ∘C (Figure 6.18b), which slightly overestimates the Tg, which
is 137.0 ∘C according to DSC (Figure 6.18a). A practical post-cure schedule of 3.0 min at 232 ∘C with no quenching
was determined for this coating at ∼12 mil DFT on steel substrates. Consequently, the system (panel and coating)
flexibility at −30 ∘C was 4.34∘/PD, and the impact resistance at room temperature was greater than 80 but less
than 100 lb-in, both of which were superior to those of regular or conventional FBE formulations at a given filler
loading of 22.1% and without any toughening agent addition. Generic liquid and powder epoxy coatings typically
have an impact resistance of 20–40 lb-in due to their relatively low MWs of resins [19] and 40–60 lb-in, respectively,
even when adequately toughened. To toughen a coating, a second phase, such as CSR domains, is introduced into
the bulk coating matrix (without greatly affecting some bulk properties, such as Tg), allowing for more efficient

energy dissipation upon impact shocks or bending. Notably, both the flexibility associated with the MWs between
crosslinked dots and the toughness associated with cohesion are bulk material properties, originating primarily
and structurally from the bulk resin package. According to testing results (Table 6.18), the #4 CG500-phenolic for-
mulation did not vitrify and exhibited rheo-kinetic behaviors similar to that of the #3 PC100-phenolic formulation
as described (i.e., melt and flow →𝜂*min at 109.2 ∘C →Tpeak at 128.8 ∘C →gelation at 164.8 ∘C), with the exception
of much higher modulus and viscosity at the corresponded temperatures of events.
Still specifically, considering the #5 CG500-BAF formulation in that the CG500 epoxy and the BAF amine
crosslinker are both fluorene monomers, two exothermic peaks appear at 132.8 ∘C and 190.2 ∘C in DSC
(Figure 6.19a), indicating at least two crosslinking reactions taking place around these two temperature ranges
sequentially and independently, resulting in a single Tg at as high as 244.8 ∘C (meaning that only one bulk domain
was formed in the cured network). Such a high Tg is associated with an overall enthalpy of −150.55 J/g. The long
tail following the second exothermic peak is consistent with the reaction order n = 2.62, suggesting that a very
long cure time or high temperature is required to achieve adequate cure; the temperature at the end of the tail is
302.0 ∘C, corresponding to a cure level of 𝛼= 93.2% according to kinetics. A proper cure cycle of at least 30 min

(a) DSC exothermic curves (blue: the ﬁrst scan up to 315 ∘C at 7.0 ∘C/min for determining thermals and kinetics,
and green: the second scan at 20 ∘C/min for measuring the cured Tg), and (b) complete rheological DMA proﬁles for the #5
CG500-BAF formulation (Tables 6.17/6.18).
at 250 ∘C (instead of the usual 232 ∘C) was determined to be necessary in order to achieve 𝛼= 95.0% (as opposed
to the usual 99.9%). In other words, this coating is susceptible to under cure unless an excessively high cure
temperature (higher than Tg) is used in conjunction with an extended curing time. The cured coating of ∼12 mils
on blasted steel substrates was tested to withstand impacts of over 60 lb-in, have excellent impermeability (water
uptake after 28 days in HWA at 95 ∘C was 9.08 g/m2, Table 6.17), and exhibit great adhesion.
On the other hand, as shown rheo-kinetically in Figure 6.19b, the flow and rheology of the #5 CG500-BAF
formulation throughout the curing process are characterized as follows: initially, 𝜂*min takes place at 131.8 ∘C,
where 𝛼= 0.55%, which coincidentally occurs just before the first Tpeak at 132.8 ∘C. Secondly, the gel point is
attained at 196.6 ∘C, corresponding to 𝛼= 44.0%, immediately after the second Tpeak at 190.2 ∘C, where 𝛼= 36.0%;
the majority of formulation enthalpy is seen around gelation and up to 300 ∘C (Figure 6.19a). Thirdly, vitrification is
not evident in the G′′ or Tan𝛿curves up to 250 ∘C, which is the maximum temperature monitored by the rheometer.
Lastly, moduli and viscosity reveal a slightly leveled-off range following 𝜂*min, that is, approximately between
132.0 ∘C and 165.0 ∘C, where cure reactions appear to stagnate in correlation to the DSC exothermic curve from the

240

first Tpeak to the onset of the second exothermic peak. Please note that DMA rheological analysis should constantly
focus on the behaviors of the dynamic 𝜂*min, gelation, vitrification (if any), and flow window/index (for adhesion).
Overall, the #2 CG500-DICY formulation appears to outperform the #5 CG500-BAF formulation due to its higher
flow, faster gel and cure responses at a given temperature, equivalent Tg, and lower catalyst addition (i.e., 0.890
versus 1.022 phr).
In addition to fluorene epoxies (such as PG-100, SE-250, and CG-500) and fluorene amines (such as BAF),
PPPBP-based epoxies (such as WHR-991S; refer to Tables 1.2d in Chapter 1 and Table 6.16) and fluorene-based
phenolics (such as BPF and BCF) as well as PPP-BP-based phenolics have been investigated for their competitive
performance. These structure-driven coating properties include rapid gel and cure if properly formulated, super
Tg (over 200 ∘C), toughness, flexibility in conjunction with low modulus at elevated temperatures, and remarkable
adhesion, which are individually or collectively attainable in one-pot formulations. Notably, PPP-BP is structurally
similar to fluorene in terms of sterically and bulkily stacked rings but differs from fluorene in terms of polarity,
hydrophilicity, and asymmetry due to hetero-N and carboxyl substitutions, which may greatly affect consequent
attributes.
Comparing to the #1 PG100-DICY formulation in Table 6.17, the #6 991S-DICY formulation in Table 6.19, com-
prised of WHR-991S (i.e., a PPPBP-based epoxy) as the bulk resin at 84.3% by weight combined with FortegraTM
310 at 15.7%, was capable of achieving comparable high performance, including Tg up to 227.0 ∘C, impact resis-
tance greater than 60 lb-in, and adhesion rated “1–2” in HWA at 95 ∘C. However, the moisture impermeability of
23.4 g/m2 as measured by water uptake in HWA was more than doubled, likely due to the polar and hydrophilic
properties of PPP-BP. In addition, this formulation (#6) exhibited a surprising dual Tg, with the minor one located
at ∼113.0 ∘C (the green curve in Figure 6.20a). Dual Tg coatings are favored and well-received because they can
accommodate a wide range of service temperatures for end-use applications between the two Tgs. In this sense,
readily gelling in 8.9 sec at 204 ∘C and fully curing at 232 ∘C for 10 min, the #6 formulation would function as a
universal product covering any serve temperature from 113.0 ∘C (typical of regular FBE coatings) to 227.0 ∘C (rep-
resenting superior heat resistance) rather than multiple products with a singular Tg each that would otherwise be
required in practice.
Other monomers (i.e., BPF, BCF, and PPP-BP) in Table 6.16 and formulations (i.e., from #7 to #10) in Table 6.19
can be evaluated in a similar fashion. Briefly, the #7 formulation of WHR-991S cured by DEH 84, a standard phe-
nolic resin as the crosslinker, resulted in a medium Tg of 143.1 ∘C as well as excellent toughness and flexibility.
Still briefly, the #8 and #9 formulations of a typical novolac epoxy, when cured by the BPF and BCF phenolic
monomers, respectively, led to superior toughness and adhesion, but a normal Tg (< 120 ∘C) unless fluorene epox-
ies are utilized as the bulk resin. Still briefly, the #10 formulation of a similar novolac epoxy, but cured by PPP-BP,
demonstrated superior adhesion but not flexibility, toughness, or Tg.
Notably, it has been discovered that the final Tg of high-Tg epoxy formulations, when exclusively cured by DICY,
is drastically lowered if the curing temperature exceeds 250 ∘C. For example, when the cure temperature exceeded
250 ∘C, such as up to 300 ∘C, the 991S-DICY formulation (#6) gave rise to a final Tg of 203.7 ∘C, as shown by the
second scan (i.e., the green curve) in Figure 6.20b, as opposed to 227.0 ∘C when the maximum curing temperature
was set to 250 ∘C (Figure 6.20a). Interestingly, such a significant Tg reduction in relation to the upper temperature
limit cutoffs happens not only with the #6 formulation but also with the #1 and #2 formulations whenever DICY
is used as the curing agent, as is also consistently observed with many other DICY-cured formulations, such as the
one with a capable Tg of 164.9 ∘C shown in Figures 6.20c/d; coatings formulated with phenolics as the crosslinkers
are never concerned with it yet in relation to the upper temperature limit. In general, uncured FBE powder coatings
have a characteristic FTIR peak corresponding to DICY at 2,190 cm−1, which disappears following curing. It is
believed that DICY-related de-crosslinking or deterioration affecting crosslinking density happens at temperatures
above 250 ∘C; however, the exact chemical mechanism responsible for this reversible crosslinking density remains
unknown. In practice, DICY-based epoxy formulations, particularly those with a high-Tg capacity, should not be
cured at temperatures over 250 ∘C unless the cured Tg is not aimed at heat resistance.

Conclusively, fluorene monomers and structurally similar compounds, especially the epoxy-functional, repre-
sent one of the most innovative resin technologies to date, allowing advanced coating performance, such as super
Tg, durable toughness, high flexibility, great impermeability, and excellent adhesion to substrates, to be readily
formulated in one-pot solutions that are applicable not only to functional powder coatings but also to liquid coat-
ings. Nevertheless, crosslinker-free formulations of high Tg (above 200 to 250 ∘C) using fluorene or comparable
monomers such as PG-100, SE-250, and WHR-991S, mixed with FortegraTM 310 or not, are shown to have difficulty
achieving full cure, regardless of the catalyst grades and loading levels.
6.2.8
Cationic catalysts and dual cure
Anionic amines as the crosslinkers and weakly anionic imidazoles (also regarded as one type of tertiary amines)
as the catalysts of applied epoxy coatings for mainstream industrial applications, including structural laminates
and surface lining of metal substrates, are widely recognized and utilized. In contrast, cationic catalysts of epoxies,
typically in the form of liquid or powder salts, are largely underestimated in one manner or another. The situation
of cationic versus anionic catalysts is analogous to that of underappreciated epoxy homo-polymerization versus
epoxy-crosslinker co-polymerization. As summarized in Table 3.4 of Chapter 3, this subsection’s efforts and aims

6.2 Functional Epoxy Powder Coatings
243
are geared toward ascertaining the following unknown or unproven facts: i) effects of cationic catalysts on epoxy
cure reactions and kinetic rates compared to their normal anionic counterparts; ii) compatibility between cationic
catalysts and anionic amines, specifically primary (1∘), secondary (2∘), and tertiary (3∘) amines, including imida-
zoles; and iii) any feasibility and appropriate means of synergy if such cationic and anionic catalysts are combined
in epoxy formulations.
Cationic complex salts, such as ETPPI (Tm ∼169.5 ∘C; refer to Figure 2.14a in Chapter 2), ETPPBr (Tm
207.5 ∘C), etc., are being used as benchmark catalysts or accelerators on the platform of TGIC/COOH-functional
polyester-based decorative powder coatings. Chemically acid-compatible, such cationic catalysts are typically
premixed into bulk polyester resins, and their SDS documentations are easily accessible. In addition to ETPPI
and similar compounds, there are a variety of cationic salt complexes with varying reactivities that are suitable as
epoxy homo-curing catalysts. These include, but are not limited to, Cyphos IL 169 (a phosphonium ionic liquid,
PR4
+; refer to Figure 2.14b in Chapter 2), BTPPCl (benzyl triphenyl phosphonium chloride, Tm > 300 ∘C), BTACI
(benzyl triethyl ammonium chloride, Tm 191 ∘C), Cetrimide (NR4
+), TBAB (tetrabutylammonium bromide), and
MYTAB (myristyl trimethyl ammonium bromide, Tm 247.5 ∘C). Indeed, complexes of weakly anionic tertiary
amines and imidazoles as catalysts in TGIC/COOH-polyester systems are free of incompatibility concerns and
even more effective than cationic counterparts, such as Aal Chem’s AALMATT31 (i.e., 2-phenyl-imidazoline),
Hunstman’s Accelerator DY 9577 (i.e., boron trichloride amine complex; refer to Appendix A), Aceto’s Acetomer
940, and Longchem’s Hardener MH-500, whether used alone or in conjunction with cationic salts. However,
strong organic acids such as p-TSA (both a Bronsted and a Lewis acid), weak acidic salts such as ZnCl2 (also a
Lewis acid), organometallic complexes such as zinc acetylacetonate (or ZnAcAc for short), DBTDL (i.e., dibutyltin
dilaurate), DABCO (refer to Table 2.5a in Chapter 2), alternatively stannous octoate (e.g., Octaflow ST-70 on
a silica carrier, Estron Chemical), and the like, are tentatively excluded from the technical consideration of
cationic catalysts. Instead, this subsection focuses on phosphonium-derived ETPPI and Cyphos IL 169, which are
representative of cationic catalysts for epoxies. Meanwhile, prior to any FBE premixing and compounding, the
liquid Cyphos IL 169 was converted into a free-flowing powder containing 70% active on a silica carrier.
The compatibility of Cyphos IL 169 with primary (1∘) amines in the presence of tertiary (3∘) amines was exam-
ined utilizing applied FBE formulations containing highly anionic DICY and/or ADH (refer to Figure 2.2a and
Table 2.1a in Chapter 2, respectively) as a 1∘amine crosslinker and an imidazole adduct (i.e., Epikure P-100; refer
to Table 2.5f in Chapter 2) as a 3∘amine catalyst, respectively, as detailed in Table 6.20. Controls 1 and 2 were
formulated with DICY at FI = 1.07 and with ADH at FI = 1.43, respectively; they were catalyzed by Epikure P-100
at 1.50 and 1.62 phr, respectively; and their filler loadings were 38.37% and 27.4% by weight of the total formula-
tion, respectively. In Table 6.20, IL169-1 and -2 stand for the two formulations loaded with the cationic Cyphos IL
169 salt as a co-catalyst at 0.415 phr on top of Control 1 and at 0.400 phr on top of Control 2, respectively; IL169-1
is therefore factually relevant to Control 1, as is IL169-2 to Control 2. Figure 6.21 reports testing findings for gel
times at 450 ∘F (i.e., 232 ∘C), pill flows of 0.50-g pills at 350 ∘F, and kinetic activation energy Ea according to the
DSC exothermic curve (conducted at 7.0 ∘C/min) fitting kinetics, while Table 6.20 reports kinetic reaction orders.
These two sets of FBE formulations containing Cyphos IL 169 at two loading levels, IL169-1 versus Control 1
and IL169-2 versus Control 2, exhibited excellent adhesion on blasted steel substrates, comparable flexibility of
6.0–7.5∘/PD, and typical impact resistance of 40–50 lb-in. The addition of such a cationic salt as a co-catalyst in
these coatings consisting of anionic 1∘and 3∘amines, regardless of DICY or ADH, inhibited rather than accelerated
cure reactions, as invariably indicated by slowed down gel times, increased pill flows to some extent, and tangi-
bly higher Ea in particular (Figure 6.21), consistent with extra cure times consequently required for the cationic
catalyst loaded formulations (i.e., IL169-1 and -2) to complete cure (refer to t0.999’s for IL169-1 versus Control 1
and t0.99’s for IL169-2 versus Control 2 in Table 6.20). If the cationic Cyphos IL 169 was compatible with anionic
amines, all these physical and kinetic properties would have shifted in the opposite direction. In other words, such
complexes are incompatible with highly anionic primary amines (−NH2), if present, in compounded epoxy coat-
ing systems. In a similar but separate DOE, the compatibility between cationic salts (e.g., ETPPI and Cyphos IL

169) and phenolic crosslinkers (e.g., KD-405) in the presence of the same imidazole adduct catalyst (e.g., Epikure
P-100) was investigated kinetically, as summarized in Table 6.21, which includes formulations, physical testing
results, and DSC-based cure kinetics. Figure 6.22 presents DSC thermograms and DMA rheology for these ladder-
ing formulations. It is inferred that they are fully compatible, consistent with the fact that the BPA-based phenolic
is weakly acidic (i.e., cationic) and the imidazole adduct is essentially a weakly basic 3∘amine as well.
Specifically, the control, that is, the batch labeled as 0(Std) in Table 6.21, which was formulated with the DER
672U novolac epoxy and the KD-405 phenolic crosslinker in the absence of catalysts, was found to have a flexi-
bility of 3.47∘/PD at −30 ∘C and impact resistance of 40–50 lb-in at room temperature, while the others modified
with ETPPI or Cyphos IL 169 at varied loading levels of 0.35, 0.70, 1.40, and 2.10 phr were comparable with regard
to these two properties. Importantly, as listed in Table 6.21, gel times invariably decreased as the loading level

of ETPPI or Cyphos IL 169 increased, as did Ea and t0.999 (or times to full cure) at 204 ∘C according to kinetics,
demonstrating the catalytic effects of ETPPI and Cyphos IL 169 on promoting epoxy homo-polymerizing cure.
Shorter gel times further reveal that Cyphos IL-169 is more effective than ETPPI at identical charge levels, espe-
cially at higher temperatures, consistent with t0.999 data indicating that the IL169 batches attain full cure in less
time than the ETPPI batches at the same loading. It should be noted that the effects of ETPPI and Cyphos IL 169
on the reaction orders m and n are different; specifically, Cyphos IL 169 is more capable of lowering the value
of n (governing the exothermic profile after Tpeak) from 1.16 for the control to 1.12 (i.e., corresponding to steeper
slopes behind Tpeak as shown in Figure 6.22b versus those for ETPPI in Figure 6.22a), resulting in a quicker cure
completion.
According to DSC thermal characterization (Figures 6.22a/b), Tg for those formulations loaded with Cyphos IL
169 or ETPPI largely remained at the same level as the control’s, 𝛥H decreased with the cationic salt loading level
in general, and both Tpeak and Tonset decreased gradually as the loading level of Cyphos IL 169 or ETPPI increased,
with the exception of Tonset for IL169′s that appeared to reach the lowest level of 118.6 ∘C at 0.35 phr. Again, apropos
to the reaction order n, the exothermic curves of the ETPPI series after Tpeak were flatter than that of the control,
with the exception of the one with ETPPI loaded likewise at 0.35 phr; the exothermic curves of the Cyphos IL 169
series after Tpeak were all steeper, indicating expedited curing as previously discussed. From viscosity and rheol-
ogy perspectives (Figure 6.22c), IL169 batches turned out to impart greatly better flow than ETPPI, as indicated
by 𝜂*min and the flow index at a given temperature before gelation; for example, the #169-210 batch (i.e., Cyphos
IL 169 at 2.10 phr) led to 𝜂*min = 144.3 Pa-s and a flow index = 2.516 1/Pa, compared to 525.7 Pa-s and barely 0.597
1/Pa for the etppi-210 batch (i.e., the ETPPI at 2.10 phr), respectively. Uncoincidentally, and according to data,
#169-210 reached 𝜂*min at 145.5 ∘C while etppi-210 did so at 135.0 ∘C, more than 10 ∘C earlier; meanwhile, the

former gelled at 167.6 ∘C, corresponding to G′ = G′′ = ∼3,525.2 Pa, whereas the latter did earlier, again, at 160.4 ∘C,
corresponding to a five times higher modulus at 18,382.5 Pa, respectively, indicating a much wider flow window
before the gel point for the #169-210 formulation to establish favorable adhesion under the prescribed cure set-
tings. The reason for this is that ETPPI has a melting point of up to 169.5 ∘C, but Cyphos IL 169 is flowable at
room temperature. DSC thermograms (Figure 6.22d) reveal a steady reduction in Tpeak and Tonset with increasing
ETPPI loading, indicating that ETPPI complements 2MI (i.e., 2-methyl imidazole) in catalyzing epoxy-phenolic
crosslinking reactions. Clearly, cationic salts, such as ETPPI and Cyphos IL 169, are fully compatible with phenolic
crosslinkers, which are typically weak acids with a pKa of ∼10.5 due to the phenyl hydroxyl functionality. In other
words, these cationic salt complexes are effective as co-catalysts enhancing crosslinking reactions between epoxies
and phenolics. The remaining question is whether cationic salts are effective in crosslinker-free epoxy formula-
tions that promote epoxy homo-polymerization as the only crosslinking pathway or cure mechanism. As a result,
DOEs in Table 6.22 were designed and executed to seek a response to this unknown as well as the compatibility
issue between cationic salts and 3∘amines, including imidazole adducts.
For clarification, the et000 batch in Table 6.22 denotes a fresh control (which is identical to the #8 formulation
with FI = ∞in Table 4.5 of Chapter 4) catalyzed solely by Epikure P-101 at 4.50 phr without the addition of

any other catalysts; meanwhile, the et035 and et230 batches represent formulations catalyzed by ETPPI partially
replacing 0.35 and 2.25 phr of the original P-101 loading level, respectively, as do the il035 and il230 batches
substitute 0.35 phr and 2.25 phr of P-101′s total 4.50 phr with Cyphos IL 169 (of 70% active). Gel times and pill flows
were evaluated using hot plates and 0.50-g pills at 350 ∘F, respectively; flexibility was evaluated at −30 ∘C using
four-point bending in accordance with NACE RP0394; and impact was evaluated at room temperature according to
CSA Z245.20 (refer to Table 4.8 in Chapter 4). Specifically, the gel times of ETPPI and Cyphos IL 169 formulations
(Table 6.22) remained comparable to the control’s (i.e., et000) or slightly decreased at 0.35 phr, but significantly
longer when the loading level of ETPPI or Cyphos IL 169 further increased to 2.30 phr. Pill flows also followed
a similar pattern. There was a slight reduction in flexibility for et230 or il230; impact resistance remained the
same as the control or improved with any cationic catalyst addition at two levels (Table 6.22). According to DSC
thermals and kinetics (Figure 6.23a), partial replacement of P-101 with either ETPPI or Cyphos IL 169 at a level of
0.35 phr had few effects on Tonset, Tpeak, Tg, and kinetic parameters, ending up with similar full cure times. Tonset,
Tpeak, Ea, and the reaction order n all increased when the loading level of either ETPPI or Cyphos IL 169 was
increased to 2.25 phr out of a total of 4.50 phr, indicating a reduction in cure performance. In addition, according
to DMA rheological data (Figure 6.23b), the 𝜂* profiles for 340-et035 and -il035 were similar to that of 340-et000
(i.e., the control), whereas those for 340-et230 and -il230′s were significantly different from the control’s, including
the temperatures at 𝜂*min and the gel points. Physical testing results, primarily flexibility and impact resistance
(Table 6.21), were consistent with kinetic and rheological evidence, re-affirming that a cationic salt loading level
of 0.35 phr, applicable to both ETPPI and Cyphos IL 169, is ostensibly the best in conjunction with an imidazole
as dual-cure catalysts for phenolic-crosslinked epoxy systems; more specifically, cure attributes were maintained
at 0.35 phr while toughness is noticeably enhanced, as evidenced by the fact that dowel or rebar coated at 8–12
mils subject to 180∘bending in seconds exhibited minimal hairline cracking or absence of micro-tearing, which
otherwise occurs frequently in the absence of either salt addition.
As also evaluated, when the Epikure P-101 catalyst in the et000 crosslinker-free formulation was completely
substituted by ETPPI or Cyphos IL 169 at 4.50 phr, no gel for ETPPI or very long gel (e.g., > 150 sec) for Cyphos IL

(a) Overlapping DSC exothermic curves and kinetics and (b) rheological DMA proﬁles for crosslinker-free
formulations utilizing ETPPI or Cyphos IL 169 as a co-catalyst with Epikure P-100 (imidazole adduct catalyst).
169 was observed at 450 ∘F, and the coated panels exhibited poor impact resistance (e.g., < 10 lb-in), validating that
low-melting Cyphos IL 169 performs more effectively than high-melting ETPPI as a cationic co-catalyst. On the
other hand, these cationic salt complexes are not as effective as the Epikure P-101 catalyst unless they are used in
combination. In other words, cationic salts partially substituting anionic 3∘amines as a dual catalyzing package are
chemically compatible and synergic at a specific loading level, such as roughly 0.35 phr for Cyphos IL 169 or ETPPI.
Notably, in conjunction with an imidazole adduct and/or an imidazole catalyst, the use of anionic dimethyl steary-
lamine (DMS, CAS# 124-28-7) or a cationic boron trichloride (BCl3)•amine complex noticeably improved epoxy
crosslinking, according to a competitive investigation (refer to Appendix A for details). The BCl3•amine complex
substantially accelerates epoxy homo-cures in the crosslinker-free formulation (Batch #6 in Appendix A), as evi-
denced by the gel and cure times. However, unless meticulously formulated, this does not necessarily imply that
adhesion and/or cohesion are enhanced. DMS was found to be superior to BCl3•amine in water impermeability.
In addition, formulations without crosslinkers while employing DMS or BCl3•DMOA as the sole catalyst exhib-
ited a tendency to gel and cure at a reduced temperature (e.g., 350 ∘F), while failing to gel or cure at an increased
temperature (e.g., 400 ∘F) as a result of catalyst decomposition. A separate experiment was conducted where the
Tg value of a fast-cure FBE formulation (similar to Batch #3 in Table 4.5 of Chapter 4 and Figure 6.1) increased by
2 ∘C and 4 ∘C, respectively, at loading levels of 0.25% and 0.50% by weight of the complex as a secondary catalyst.
The batch exhibited enhanced compatibility, flowability, and color richness simultaneously while maintaining
its superior flexibility and performance unaffected. BX3•amine complexes, including BCl3•DMOA, BF3•MEA, and
BCl3•TMA (trimethylamine), are cationic catalysts that are anticipated to promote epoxy homo-cures significantly
more efficiently than Cyphos IL 169 or ETPPI.
In terms of reactivity, effectiveness, and latency, it is worthwhile and practically useful for formulators to
understand how cationic salts as a catalyst compare to competing catalyzing chemicals such as 2MI, DMAP,
and TPP, among many others. These are well addressed by carrying out two sets of DOEs in accordance with
consistent DSC kinetic quantification, as presented in Table 6.23, Figure 6.24, and Table 6.24, respectively. In
specific, the first set of experiments were conducted using the 0(Std) formulation (refer to Table 6.21) with an
epoxy novolac (i.e., DER 672U) as the bulk binder resin and a low-MW BPA-based phenolic (i.e., KD-405) as
the hardener, and each of the listed catalysts (Table 6.23) was loaded at 0.70 phr except for 0(Std), that is, the
control. Consequently, gel times, pill flows (0.50-g pills at 350 ∘F), and exclusive DSC kinetic parameters were
obtained from physical testing and their exothermic curves performed at 7.0 ∘C/min. Consistent data of gel
times (from the shortest to longest), pill flows (from the highest to lowest), Ea (from the smallest to largest),

and particularly t0.999 (from the shortest to longest) suggest that the effectiveness of catalyzation is in the order
(from the highest to lowest) of DMAP ≥2MI > Epikure P-100 ≈Aradur 3088 > TPP (triphenyl phosphine) >
2PI > ETPPI > Cetrimide, where 2PI (i.e., 2-propyl imidazole) was in the form of a free-flowing powder (60%
active carried on silica). Latency, according to kinetic Ea indications, except for the control, generally follows
the reverse order of reactivity. Reactivity and latency of underlying catalysts can be consistently evaluated by
comparing DSC thermograms, as demonstrated in Figure 6.24, in which all samples were all run at 20.0 ∘C/min.
Although 𝛥H may vary, Tpeak and Tonset are almost always the lowest for the most reactive catalyst, that is,
DMAP, closely followed by 2MI, and the highest for the least effective catalyst, that is, Cetrimide, closely
followed by ETPPI. Aradur 3088 and 2PI are very competitive with one another. It is clear that this classification
would aid formulators in selecting the most suitable catalyst for specific formulation requirements, notably
epoxy systems.
In addition, ETPPI at three levels of 0.10, 0.20, and 0.50 phr as well as miscellaneous complexes such as
ZnAcAc, AlAcAc (Tm ∼191.5 ∘C, Actylis), BTPPCl, and TPPO (triphenylphosphine oxide) at one level of 0.50 phr
each as a co-catalyst were investigated in a dual catalyst system, which used a similar epoxy novolac resin and
phenolic-crosslinked FBE formulation with 2MI as the bulk catalyst preloaded at 0.32 phr (refer to Figure 6.22d).
According to their DSC exotherms tested at 7.0 ∘C/min and kinetic responses (Table 6.24), reactivity was com-
pared. On the one hand, based on Ea and t0.999 for the ETPPI series, its optimal loading level lies between 0.20 and
0.50 phr, which is consistent once again with previously determined 0.35 phr independently or in conjunction
with the Epikure P-101 imidazole adduct or 2MI catalyst, indicating that an optimized loading of about 0.35 phr

for this class of cationic salts is not necessarily accidental. On the other hand, considering the kinetic parameters
and resulting t0.999’s for each and all these five co-catalysts at 0.50 phr, the catalytic effectiveness appears to be in
the order of BTPPCl > ETPPI > TPPO > ZnAcAc > AlAcAc, from the most reactive to the least reactive. Such
a sequence should be representative of their respective catalytic abilities if applied independently (i.e., without
tertiary amines) in formulation. Particularly, DMS demonstrated its unique cure behavior as evidenced by its
kinetic parameters A = 25,000, Ea = 55,000 J/mol (comparable to that of Cetrimide), m = 0.43, and n = 0.92 (even
lower than that of 2MI), as presented in Appendix A, which were concurrently assessed using the identical
FBE platform with a formulation index of 1.05 and a loading level of 0.70 phr. As determined by its autocatalytic
ODE, the resulting formulation was fully curable at 204 ∘C for 263.0 sec (t0.999), which was even more effective
than Epikure P-100 but also developed superior adhesion to unprofiled steel panels. It can be inferred that DMS
competently facilitates rapid epoxy homo-polymerization in the presence of a phenolic resin crosslinker (namely
KD-427) and with high latency.
To conclude this subsection, the catalyzation of epoxy coatings by cationic salts alone is not necessarily the
most viable alternative for producing strong formulations unless they are combined with cationic crosslinkers
such as COOH-functional polyesters and phenolic resins. Preferably, cationic salts, such as ETPPI and Cyphos
IL 169, can be used as a co-catalyst at 0.35 phr in combination with a tertiary amine catalyst; this is leveraged to
develop LAT (low application temperature) powder coatings, which are described in Debrief B. It is preferable
to avoid using highly anionic primary and secondary amines in systems containing cationic complexes as a part
of catalysts or accelerators. It is more desirable to combine cationic salts as co-catalysts with compatible cationic
crosslinkers (e.g., phenolics) and compatible tertiary amine bulk catalysts, such as imidazoles (e.g., 2MI), and
preferably imidazole adducts (e.g., Epikure P-100 or P-101).

6.2 Functional Epoxy Powder Coatings

6.2.9
Specialty and miscellaneous materials and formulations
In addition to the previously mentioned fluorene monomers, active phenyl esters, etc., the commercial availability
of many specialties and innovative resin modifications enables coating formulators to pursue unique or niche
performance attributes. These miscellaneous epoxies and crosslinker materials include, but are not limited to,
LCE-2615, jER YX7400, jER YX7760 (refer to Figures 1.6d/e and Table 1.2a in Chapter 1, respectively), and Noryl
SA-90 (refer to Table 2.4c in Chapter 2), all of which have been examined herein employing allied FBE formulation
platforms. In accordance with formulations and structure-property relationships, results and, where applicable,
refreshing findings are reported.
LCE-2615 with di-functionality and a softening temperature of 94.0 ∘C refers to a liquid crystalline epoxy resin
offered by Nippon Kayaku, and it is said, without being limited to theory, to potentially improve the toughness,
moisture resistance, adhesion, and shrinkage of cured films [25]. Difunctional jER YX7400 (Mitsubishi Chemical)
is a silicone rubber-modified liquid epoxy with a high elastic modulus (not flexibility) that is expected to enhance
toughness and adhesion. Prior to compounding or premixing its FBE formulations, jER YX7400 was encapsulated
into a free-flowing powder of 90% active (silica as the carrier). In addition, di-functional jER YX7760 (Mitsubishi
Chemical) is a solid epoxy resin modified with fluorine (or called fluorinated, unrelated to fluorene) and is antic-
ipated to provide low permittivity (i.e., low-dielectric constant and loss tangent) and perhaps other advantages.
In Table 6.25, individual formulations and their associated physical properties, including gel times, pill flows,
Tg, flexibility, and impact resistance (an indicator of toughness), are provided, along with DSC thermal and cure
kinetics. All these three FBEs, that is, LCE2615-30, YX7400-06, and YX7760-63, where the suffix numbers repre-
sent the weight percentage of the specific resin in the total resins of each formulation, were formulated at FI =
1.046 using KD-405 or DEH 84 as the crosslinker. Both KD-405 and DEH 84 are low MW and equivalent weight
phenolic resins, but only DEH 84 contains ∼2.5% by weight of 2MI. Explicitly and consistently, gel times at 350 ∘F
and 400 ∘F decreased proportionally as the overall catalyst loading level increased, as did the kinetic Ea’s, which
reduced significantly from 54,300 J/mol for LCE2615-30 at 0.736 phr of the catalyst to 50,400 J/mol for YX7400-06
at 1.04 phr to 50,200 J/mol for YX7760-63 at 1.42 phr, respectively.
In particular, LCE-2615 was observed to substantially increase cured film flexibility up to 8.17∘/PD without
cracking but not to improve toughness at 30.0% loading by weight of all epoxy resins; jER YX7400 ended up con-
siderably lowering Tg from typically 105.0 ∘C to approximately 92.9 ∘C at just 6.28% loading by weight of all epoxies,
but it did not necessarily impart any advantages in flexibility or impact resistance; and jER YX7760 was found to
increase Tg up to 115.0 ∘C at 62.8% loading by weight of all epoxies while considerably improving toughness. In
addition, YX7400 rendered excellent adhesion; however, additional YX7400 loading, for example, 30% by weight
of all resins, decreased Tg from 92.9 to 58.7 ∘C and slowed curing as the reaction order n increased from 0.81 to
1.41, in addition to reduced flexibility at 1.44∘/PD and impact resistance of ≤20 lb-in. Consistent with its massive
flow (e.g., pill flows were as high as 93.0 mm at 1.42 phr catalyst loading), the YX7760-63 formulation exhibited
extremely tough adhesion, making it challenging to clean off processing equipment and during application unless
solvents are used. Its superior adhesion contributes in part to the enhancement of impact resistance. In terms
of DSC thermal characterization, these co-resins had a negligible impact on the pattern or shape of exothermic
curves, which remained representative of phenolic-cured epoxies, as illustrated in Figure 6.25.
Sabic’s di-functional Noryl SA-90, on the other hand, is one of the specialty phenolic resins that is linearly
structured, has a high EW-PhOH of 840 g/eq and a high-melting temperature of over 180 ∘C, and has plenty of
aromatically rigid moieties. It is worthwhile to evaluate SA-90′s performance as an epoxy crosslinker, and this
has been carried out using applied FBE formulations as provided in Table 6.26, where the two epoxy novolac resin
and phenolic crosslinker formulations of SA90-100 and -15 represent Noryl SA-90 employed as the sole crosslinker
(i.e., at 100%) and as a co-crosslinker (i.e., at 15% by weight of the total crosslinkers) in conjunction with KD-405
at 85%, respectively. The SA90-100 formulation was overloaded with a catalyst loading level of 2.124 phr, lead-
ing to a gel time of less than one second at 350 ∘F; surprisingly, it exhibited an exothermic curve with a single

peak for the first scan (the blue curve in Figure 6.26a) but two significant Tg domains at 115.2 ∘C and 163.4 ∘C,
respectively, as detected by the second scan (the green curve in Figure 6.26a). As depicted in Figure 6.26b, the
dual Tgs from a single cure were confirmed by MDSC conducted at 3.0 ∘C/min. The first lower Tg is attributed to
epoxy homo-polymerization, and the second higher Tg is credited to co-polymerization between epoxy and Noryl
SA-90. These hypotheses are, however, subject to experimental verification. As previously discussed, dual Tgs are
an advantageous characteristic of applied coating products, allowing any service temperature that falls between
them to function robustly and sustain heat resistance over time.
Typically, as Tg increases, so does enthalpy (i.e., 𝛥H), and vice versa. Surprisingly, SA90-100 exhibited an
exotherm or heat of reactions as low as −25.0 J/g (Figure 6.26a), despite the fact that one of its two Tgs was as
high as 163.4 ∘C, indicating that a great deal of enthalpy was likely re-consumed by additional crosslinking events
that ultimately resulted in dual Tgs. Unfortunately, SA90-100 coated steel panels exhibited very poor toughness,
as the coating fragmented upon impact shocks, suggesting that Noryl SA-90, with its extremely rigid structure as

the single crosslinker, hardly constitutes a viable formulation as coating products. In fact, when Noryl SA-90 was
applied as a co-hardener at 15% by weight at a similar FI while the catalyst loading level was concurrently reduced
to 0.736 phr, the resulting SA90-15 formulation (Table 6.26) did produce a robust product demonstrating fairly
decent performance, including gel times (e.g., 19.0 sec at 204 ∘C), pill flows, cure cycles (e.g., 5.0 min at 204 ∘C
without quenching), a toughness between 40 and 50 lb-in as determined by impact resistance, and a bending
flexibility of up to 4.65∘/PD at −30 ∘C. Toughness or impact resistance was slightly enhanced or maintained.
Notably, the SA90-15 formulation no longer produced dual Tg values but rather a single Tg at 104.7 ∘C, as is
common for epoxy novolac-phenolic formulations. Therefore, maximizing the structural performance of Noryl
SA-90 depends mostly on formulation design.
As a supplementary example of dual Tg formulations, SBHPP’s Durez PR-33979 as a di-functional phe-
nolic crosslinker, which is phenol-based, not BPA-based, at 20.7% by mole coupled with DICY as the other
multi-functional curing agent, which is amine-based, not phenolic, at 79.3% by mole in an FBE formulation
(Figure 6.27a), where FI was 0.9333, the catalyst loading was 2.50 phr, and the filler loading was 31.0% by
weight of the total formula, exhibited comparable dual Tgs at 111.9 and 165.6 ∘C (Figure 6.27b), respectively.
Different from SA90-100, which comprised a single epoxy resin and a single phenolic-functional crosslinker,
this formulation contained a resin package of three resin variants and dual amine and phenolic crosslinkers. In
terms of functionality, the Tg domain at 111.9 is primarily derived from di-functional KR-693 (an acrylic-modified
BPA-based epoxy from Kukdo) and EPON 2004 crosslinked by the phenolic, whereas the Tg domain at 165.6 ∘C is
derived from isocyanate-modified DER 6510HT crosslinked by DICY, respectively.
Debrief A Extremely ﬂexible FBE coatings through SDH and BAF amines
According to Global Market Insights, the market for protective and decorative powder coatings is forecasted
to reach USD 17.57 billion by 2025 [26]. Rebar FBE coatings are one of the niche powder applications within
infrastructure (e.g., bridges and highways), with a current market worth of approximately USD 50 million in
the United States alone. Critical to quality (CTQ) is the exceptional flexibility of coatings applied and cured on

tage of their flexible linear structures. Crack-free bending as well as fast gel (e.g., down to 2–4 sec) and cure (e.g.,

down to 12–14 sec) for rebar FBE coatings are widely recognized as the highest performance criteria desired by
application and fabrication for maximum line speeds (e.g., 70 ft/min) and productivity.
This embodiment is intended to illustrate, using experimental data as evidence, that rebar coating technolo-
gies, among others, are depending on formulation strategy and are not necessarily confined to phenolic or any
specific cure chemistry. In addition to phenolics of phenol hydroxyl functionality, other linearly para-structured
or highly flexible crosslinkers, such as amine-functional SDH (sebcic dihydrazide; refer to Table 2.1b) and BAF
(bisaniline fluorene; refer to Table 2.2h in Chapter 2), can impart flexibility to coatings from a structure-property
relationship perspective. Mechanically, flexibility is correlated to creep compliance (J, 1/Pa) =

modulus (G), which
measures the bending deformation (𝛥𝜀) of cured films under a rapidly applied stress (𝜏), implying that crack-free
bending performance requires either a high creep or a low modulus. In addition to minimizing or preventing tent-
ing fractures, stronger adhesion and cohesion are more likely to eliminate micro-tears (sometimes severe along
the rebar rims, Figure 6.28a). In light of these concepts, it is simpler to understand that rebar coating formulations

require adequate flow and leveling prior to gelling in seconds, especially for fast-gel grades; however, Tg must be
appropriate, often between 100 ∘C and 110 ∘C, not too high (adverse to flexibility) or too low (impairing toughness).
Multiple rounds of DOEs were executed to determine the optimal resin package consisting of Types 7 and
4 epoxy blends along with a toughening resin at 12.5% by weight of the total resins, the optimal crosslinker
loading level or FI at 2.84, and the synergistic catalyst combination of 2MI (granules sourced from A&C Cat-
alysts) and 2PI (60% active carried on silica) at ∼1.77 phr total. The finalized SDH [27] and BAF formulations
(Table 6.27) exhibited cold bending capacity devoid of cracks. For equivalent gel (e.g., 6–7 sec at 400 ∘F) and cure
(15–20 sec at 450 ∘F) performance, the overall catalyst loading level was approximately 2.5 times less than is nor-
mally required in phenolic-curing formulations (e.g., 4.50 phr total). Explicitly, it is not only advantageous to
eliminate the undesirable tendency to yellow upon curing at elevated temperatures but also to minimize costs
without sacrificing CTQs. As experimentally verified, FortegraTM 304 (Tm 102 ∘C), a polyol-modified epoxy, is

DCPD (dicyclopentadiene)-modified Epiclon HP-7200H (EEW 275, which can result in a Tg up to 108.1 ∘C), and
EXA-7311 (EEW 277, DIC), among others. The SDH formulation window in terms of FIs for a crack-free trait is
as broad as the phenolic-cured systems, ranging from 1.634 to 5.00, which corresponds to 35.44 to 11.58 pbw of
SDH needed for the same resin package and batch size detailed in Table 6.27. Both SDH and BAF of fine particles,
for example, averaged 3–6 μm, are crucially necessary, as coarse grades (e.g., 30–60 μm) have been found to fail
cold bending badly. Extruding temperatures of 85/105 ∘C (Zones III/IV) as determined from the onset of a DSC
test conducted at 20 ∘C/min were found to function without issue, neither too low to melt resins nor too high to
cause premature curing, as opposed to fast-gel phenolic formulations that must use low temperatures for extrud-
ing, such as 60/90 ∘C. Aerosil 380 or 200 are preferred as dry flow agents or post adds for such powder coatings
due to their hydrophilic surfaces for moisture absorption. Optimal SDH and BAF formulations can be cured in
14 sec at 450 ∘F with crack-free performance, little cobwebbing, minimal micro-tearing, superior adhesion, and a
glossy finish.
DSC thermal and cure kinetics (Figure 6.28b and Table 6.27) indicate that the heat of reactions (𝛥H) was modest
for both SDH (i.e., −61.85 J/g) and BAF’s (i.e., −54.70 J/g) formulations, Tgs were in the range of 102 to 104 ∘C, Ea’s
were close to 50,000 J/mol, and the total reaction order of m plus n was close to one (implying a first-order reaction).
The kinetics predicted full cure times to be 450 ∘F as 17.3 sec for the SDH formulation and 18.3 sec for the BAF
formulation, which were consistent with 14–18 sec seen during testing. Again, it should be noted that slight under
cure, such as up to 5%, has no effect on bending crack performance. In conclusion, super-flexible FBE formulations
are not limited to di-functional phenolic-curing chemistry; rather, SDH and BAF of flexible-chain or low-modulus
structures as the amine crosslinkers are equally capable of similar performance, favorably at even much lower cata-
lyst loading levels, which means that such functional amine hardeners impart faster cure responses than phenolics
at a given catalyst addition. In addition, regardless of whether the formulation is amine- or phenolic-based, there
exists an optimal catalyst loading for a specific or fixed resin or a resin package that is neither overloaded nor under-
loaded to achieve crack-free and the fastest gel performance. Flexibility is fundamentally proportional to modulus,
molecular weights, and Tg, depending on formulations that govern the ratio of epoxy homo-polymerization to
epoxy-hardener co-polymerization in the cured network.

heat-sensitive substrates, and adaptability to application circumstances (e.g., one coat finish). Low-cure
temperatures are specified differently for liquid and powder coatings, as well as for different purposes. For
example, liquid epoxy coatings that are formulated, excluding 1K’s, to cure at temperatures below 34–50 ∘F
(1–10 ∘C), are considered as low cure. Carboline’s SP-2810 LTC, a modified 2K epoxy coating, is reportedly
capable of curing at temperatures as low as 14 ∘F (−10 ∘C), making it suitable for concrete maintenance in the
winter. Low-cure concepts for powder coatings (excluding 2K’s, if any) that always require adequate thermal
latency for processing, storage, and transport are somewhat complicated. In particular, decorative powder
coatings primarily based on TGIC-polyester/acrylic, HAA-polyester, and polyurethane chemistries are sometimes
curable at temperatures as low as 325 ∘F (or 163 ∘C) or even 302 ∘F (or 150 ∘C) for at least 15–30 min or longer
when deemed to have low-cure capabilities. In contrast, amine (like DICY and ADH, both with a melting point
above 185 ∘C) crosslinked FBEs (also known as one platform of protective powder coatings) are commonly
thermally cured above 200 ∘C up to 250 ∘C intended for steel pipeline applications; these FBEs, if properly
formulated and curable at a temperature between 175 ∘C and 200 ∘C, are therefore regarded as having low-cure
performance [28]. Commercial FBEs based on phenolics as the crosslinker and appropriately catalyzed (also
known as another platform of protective powder coatings) are readily and sufficiently curable at 150–175 ∘C for
5–15 min on steel/iron substrates such as rebar and valves. Powder coatings, regardless of formulation chemistry,
for heat-sensitive substrates, such as medium density fiberboards (MDFs), must be capable of curing below 300 ∘F
(149 ∘C) and preferably between 250 ∘F and 257 ∘F (121–125 ∘C) [29], which is described as ultra-LAT.

6 Formulation Case Studies
In one aspect concerning liquids, traditional workhorse amine curatives, such as polyamidoamines (or
polyamides), are not recommended for LAT liquid epoxy coatings (which remain challenging from a technologi-
cal and performance standpoint) due to their slow reactivity and inability to meet the cure rate and cured chemical
resistance requirements. LAT liquid epoxies must be formulated to resist deleterious blush and water spots that
cause gloss loss, increased yellowing, poor recoatability, and inter-coat adhesion issues [30]. Blush is created when
primary amines react with ambient CO2 and water to form carbamates that can exude to the surface; situations of
high humidity increase the likelihood of blush formation. Liquid curing agent manufacturers have developed a
wide variety of modified amine adducts, including multi-functional phenalkamine curatives (refer to Table 2.2c in
Chapter 2), for LAT applications while minimizing carbamate formation (blush root cause) and improving early
water spot resistance due to the pre-reaction of primary amine hydrogens with epoxide groups. The descending
order of the reactivity of amino-functional curing agents with liquid BPA-based epoxies is Mannich base > amine
adducts > phenalkamines > high-MW amine adducts. In terms of the reactivity with polyacrylate-modified
epoxies, such as EPON 8111 (EEW 140) and EPON 8101 (EEW 192), which are characteristic of low viscosity,
improving film hardness, blush resistance, and clarity, phenalkamines (rather than high-MW amine adducts) are
the most effective curing agents, with a gel time of less than 10 min at −10 ∘C. DMP-30 (refer to Table 2.5b in
Chapter 2) is a suitable accelerator for LAT liquid coatings. Notably, Nuplex/Allnex’s ACURE technology (refer
to Michael Addition reactions in Figure 3.9 [1/2a] in Chapter 3 and Figure 4.1d in Chapter 4) is low cure, as are
Bayer’s Blulogig hardeners (reducing cure temperatures from 140 ∘C to 80 ∘C) and Vestanat EP-M (pertaining to
urethane-modified polyalkoxysilane crosslinking chemistry) as well as UV-curable systems.
In another aspect concerning powders, the evolving global markets continue to pursue ultra-LAT products
suitable for heat-sensitive and non-conductive substrates such as industrial MDFs (homogeneous and low poros-
ity), composites, plastics, and alloys. This type of powder coating should ideally cure sufficiently at 125 ∘C or
below in 10 min and allow a PCI smoothness of 5–10 (preferably 7–10) at 4–5 mil DFT, in addition to low cost,
easy and friendly processing and storage, and standard wood lining functions. Table 6.28 lists existing formu-
lation platforms, such as UV-curable, free-radical, TGIC, HAA, and PUR, and proposed technologies, such as
epoxy-based and Michael Addition. Specifically, UV-curable and free-radical powder coatings comprising unsat-
urated resins with ultra-LAT capacity for MDFs have been commercialized; TGIC outperforms HAA or PUR,
an excellent option for LAT but not ultra-LAT. Still specifically, several formulation strategies within the scope
of epoxies, such as the use of low-melting phenolic crosslinkers, such as VDH or MOCA (refer to Table 2.1d or
Figure 2.16a in Chapter 2, respectively) as the crosslinker, and dual cure (tertiary amines and cationic salts) in
conjunction with crosslinker-free concepts, are proposed and implemented to achieve ultra-LAT CTQs, as detailed
in the remainder of this debrief. In the interim, modified epoxy/COOH-functional polyester-based hybrids and a
commercial free-radical unsaturated polyester system are examined and compared.
LAT and ultra-LAT formulations are strategically feasible through the employment of crosslinkers with an
appropriately low-melting point, such as phenolic hardeners (e.g., KD-405, etc.), rather than some high soften-
ing or melting amines (e.g., DICY, DDS), the selection of low-type epoxies such as Type 1.5 to Type 4, the addition
of as much of a catalyst (e.g., imidazoles, imidazole adducts) as is required, and the combinations. Table 6.29 is a
screening DOE intended to evaluate the ultra-LAT capabilities of formulations using a Type 2 epoxy resin and phe-
nolic crosslinkers. Specifically, a Type 2 epoxy resin, that is, Kukdo’s YD-012Q (Ts 75–85 ∘C), was selected alongside
phenolic crosslinkers with ascending MWs and EW-PhOHs, that is, Kukdo’s KD-405, -427 (Ts 95–100 ∘C), -452,
and -448. The resulting DOE included four formulations with an identical FI of 3.50, a catalyst loading level of
3.736 phr, and a batch size of 1,441.96 pbw. According to physical testing (Table 6.29), KD-452 of EW-PhOH 530
appeared to perform the best, as it had the shortest gel time and the longest pill flow; KD-448 likely has a MW
that is too high to be more reactively responsive. Smoothness and gloss were consistent with flow data, and edge
coverage was the best for the KD-427 formulation at 4–5 mil DFT on MDF and at 12–14 mil DFT on blasted steel
substrates, followed by the KD-452 formulation. By mapping the FIs up and down, it is possible to optimize the
KD-427 and perhaps KD-452 formulas to further improve gel and cure.

Characterization of cure behaviors is essential for the development of ultra-LAT formulations but can be
challenging to address quantitatively and objectively. In this sense, physical tests are only supportive, while DSC
analysis is indispensable and conclusive. DSC was used to determine the LAT performance of the DOEs listed
in Table 6.29, as exhibited in Figure 6.29a, where the blue and brown curves represent KD-405 and KD-448,
respectively. These four formulations cured very similarly in terms of Tpeak and Tonset at approximately 150 and
132 ∘C when run at 20 ∘C/min and 133.0 and 115.0 ∘C when run at 7.0 ∘C/min, respectively, with Tpeak falling
within the range of 125–150 ∘C. Please note that Tcure being greater than Tpeak in practice is often preferred but
not necessarily always required. Figure 6.29b depicts MDF panels sprayed and cured at 125 ∘C for 10 min with a
PCI smoothness of 5–7, where the glossy finish can be modified easily by adding more fillers for a desired matte
finish. Cured film DSC data on KD-427 and -452 (Table 6.29) validate that a sufficient cure level (i.e., 𝛼’s > 99%)
was achieved on MDF panels by the implemented cure schedule, commensurate with the cure times predicted
from cure kinetics, and therefore the use of shorter cure times, if desired, is possible.
Dihydrazides are nucleophilic and versatile amines that readily react with epoxies as a curing agent upon
thermal activation, react in polyurethanes/polyureas as a chain extender at ambient temperature, and cure acrylic
resins (vinyl-functional and with pendant ketone moieties), such as AAEM and DAAM (refer to Figures 3.10a/b),
by the so-called keto-hydrazide crosslinking (refer to Debrief A in Chapter 3) that releases water throughout the
film-forming process at room temperature. Specifically, VDH is a commercially accessible dihydrazide having the

lowest melting point of all dihydrazides, 120 ∘C. Theoretically, VDH should perform well as an ultra-LAT FBE
crosslinker when a suitable catalyst is incorporated. By extending the previous studies on DICY, ADH, SDH, and
DDH (refer to Table 5.10 in Chapter 5), viable ultra-LAT FBE formulations using VDH were quickly narrowed
down and secured by running DOEs of FI and catalyst optimizations, with a formulation (of a black color) and
its characterization serving as a representative example in Table 6.30 and Figure 6.30. Gel times and pill flows
(0.50-gram pills) were measured to be 29.0/6.6 sec and 46.8/53.9 mm at 250/350 ∘F, respectively.
The corresponding DSC thermal results (Figure 6.30a) reveal that Tpeak/Tonset are 126.3/101.9 ∘C when heated at
20 ∘C/min and 106.9/82.6 ∘C when heated at 7.0 ∘C/min, respectively, which are close to or remarkably lower than
the desired cure temperature of 125 ∘C. Tg consistently ended up at roughly 112.5 ∘C, which is also considerably

lower than the desired cure temperature, which is advantageous for preventing probable vitrification during an
oven cure process. The shoulder peaks on the DSC curves are associated with epoxy homo-polymerization at FI
= 2.00. The DSC curve solution (DCS) technique determined the cure kinetic parameters to be A = 25,000, Ea =
45,750 J/mol, m = 0.59, and n = 1.41, predicting t0.95 = 331.2 sec for sufficient cure and t0.99 = 648 sec for complete
cure, less than or close to the CTQ-compliant cure time of 10 min at 125 ∘C. Actual DSC tests on cured films sam-
pled from sprayed and cured (125 ∘C for 10 min) MDF panels confirmed a cure level of 95.7%. Rheological DMA
(Figure 6.30b) characterized a flow index (i.e., the complex compliance) of 0.077 1/Pa (versus comparably 0.070
1/Pa at FI = 1.50 and inferiorly 0.023 1/Pa at FI = 1.15), consistent with a PCI smoothness rating of “5-7” reached
on MDF panels at 4–5 mils (Figure 6.30d) in comparison to the formulations at FI = 1.50 with a semi-gloss and at
FI = 1.15 with a matte finish, respectively. As it turned out, the FI for VDH formulations should be between 1.50
and 2.00 for sufficient flow to achieve the appropriate smoothness (not gloss). In other words, the VDH crosslinker
loading level cannot be too excessively charged. Additionally, DMA on cured films (Figure 6.30c) indicates that
the implemented coating offers good heat resistance over 165 ∘C.

6.2 Functional Epoxy Powder Coatings

In a sense, LAT formulations are characterized by fast gelling and curing properties or being highly catalyzed
(if not UV-curable or free-radical). As previously discussed (refer to Tables 6.4/6.5), crosslinker-free epoxy
formulations with regular Tgs (≤120 ∘C) exhibit the quickest gel and cure times at a given temperature, as
well as improved modulus and impact resistance. In addition, the described dual-cure technology (refer to
Tables 6.20/6.21/6.22) utilizing anionic tertiary amines (including imidazoles) in conjunction with cationic
onium salts of preferably low-melting temperatures facilitates cure and increases cohesive toughness. An
ultra-LAT FBE formulation tactic integrating crosslinker-free and dual-cure chemistry is therefore executed
through many rounds of experiments and tests, including sprayability on MDF panels and curability at 125 ∘C in
less than 10 min. This type of formulation development began with the crosslinker-free concept, which eliminates
concerns regarding appropriate crosslinker selection or incompatibility between the selected crosslinker with
other gradients as a result of 100% epoxy homo-polymerization accounting for the cure reactions; concurrently,
it was combined with dual-cure systems consisting of a weakly anionic tertiary amine and a cationic onium
salt to synergically maximize low-cure capacity and toughness. Cyphos IL 169 was selected over ETPPI or other
cationic salts due to its low-melting point, and its loading level was maintained at around 0.35 phr as previously
described (refer to Tables 6.21/6.22). The selection of an epoxy resin with a low-melting point (e.g., < 100 ∘C)
for enough flow on wood surfaces in a short period of time before gelation was then vital to the development of
effective formulations. As shown in Figure 6.31, initial batches at a total catalyst loading of 4.50 phr (containing
Epikure P-101 at 4.15 phr) were executed to select an epoxy resin from among five types (i.e., Types 1.5, 1.9,
2.0, 4.0, and 5.0, respectively) employing relevant EEWs versus curing responses including notably gel and cure
times at 125 ∘C, Tg, and enthalpy. The gel time for a formulation is frequency-dependent but constant at a given
temperature; thus, tgel’s were determined by the G′ and G′′ crossovers to the same gel point per isothermal DMA
conducted at 125 ∘C but at multiple frequencies (e.g., 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 Hz), although higher frequencies may
present difficulties in adjusting in-situ strains and tensions in practice. Cure times to 𝛼= 99.9% were obtained
using DSC kinetics (Figure 6.32a) and plotted in Figure 6.31. As the EEW decreases, gel and cure times reduce
and enthalpy rises favorably; however, Tg rises unfavorably, indicating that vitrification is more likely to occur at
a given Tcure (e.g., 125 ∘C) when it is closer to Tg, thereby impeding cure completion. As expected, Type 1.5 resin
produced the highest Tg at 119.8 ∘C and exotherm of −140.7 J/g, followed by Types 1.9 and 2.0. Thermally and
kinetically (Figure 6.32a), Type 1.5 resin resulted in the lowest Tpeak at 121.8 ∘C and Tonset at 101.2 ∘C, when DSC
was run at 7.0 ∘C/min, as well as the smallest reaction orders m = 0.62 and n = 0.73, but Ea was comparable to

all others at 47.30 kJ/mol. According to rheological DMA, the cured modulus increased as EEW decreased, and
Type 1.5 resin with the lowest MW led to the hardest cure at about 182 MPa.
Based on DSC Tpeak and Tonset temperatures that exceeded the target cure temperature of 125 ∘C as well as the
resulting gritty finishes on MDF panels, Types 4 and 5 resin formulations were deemed unsuitable for further
development. In general, and in practice, Tonset should be significantly lower than the underlying cure temperature,
which should preferably be greater than Tpeak. Crosslinker-free formulations utilizing Type 1.5, 1.9, and 2.0 resins
coupled with dual catalysts of Epikure P-101 and Cyphos IL 169 were validated to achieve adequate cure levels
(𝛼= 93.8%, 94.3%, and 96.0%, respectively, upon cure at 125 ∘C for 7.5 min according to oven post-cure studies
and cured film DSC testing) and smoothness (Figure 6.32b) per specifications. In addition, they exhibited superior
flow and leveling for a smooth finish and edge coverage. Considering the cured Tg (i.e., 119.8 ∘C for Type 1.5 versus
115.0 ∘C for Type 2.0) and modulus (i.e., 182 MPa for Type 1.5 versus ∼90 MPa for Type 2.0), Type 2 appeared to be
a better option than Type 1.5 in terms of cure advancement performance because its lower Tg is likely to introduce
fewer concerns of vitrification during the curing process at the intended Tcure = 125 ∘C. Residual exothermic data
obtained by DSC in post-cure studies were consistent with this conclusion.
As for the path of hybrid formulations comprising an epoxy and a COOH-functional polyester resin, the most
important technical consideration is the use of an appropriate resin and catalyst package. Again, lower-type epoxy
resins with lower EEWs are preferable due to their lower MWs and thus faster cure response and better flowability
at the desired cure temperature. The coupled polyester resin must compatibly render great flow and leveling in
order to achieve a high level of smoothness. Preliminary screening DOEs indicated that a Type 1.9 epoxy resin (the
same as used in dual-cure crosslinker-free formulations) performed well in combination with Crylcoat E 1551-6, a
COOH-functional polyester resin (EW-COOH 790 g/eq), preferably at FI = 1.50, that is, the molar ratio of epoxies
to polyesters, in terms of capable cure schedules at 125 ∘C. Crylcoat E 04712 (EW-COOH 555.4) and Joncryl 848
(EW-COOH 261) did not perform as well as Crylcoat E 1551-6 in terms of flow and smooth finishes under compa-
rable formulation parameters and processing conditions. When it comes to enabling catalysts, cationic onium salts
are regarded as the primary and default option for hybrid powder coatings (because of their compatibility) at nor-
mal cure temperatures, such as 150 to 200 ∘C. According to the SDS, Crylcoat E 1551-6 already contained ∼0.87%
ETPPBr by weight as delivered. Nevertheless, for ultra-LAT hybrid systems in development, low-melting Cyphos
IL 169 was favored over ETPPI or ETPPBr with high-melting points surpassing Tcure. In addition, the dual-cure

catalyst approach remains effectively applicable and delivers faster and better curing performance than cationic
salts alone. As reported in Table 6.31, cationic Cyphos IL 169 at 0.35 phr of the combined epoxy and polyester
resins along with an imidazole adduct (such as Epikure P-100 or P-101) or a straight imidazole (such as 2MI)
bulkily loaded as the catalyst package was determined to be suitable for such hybrid formulations. A couple of
dual-cure crosslinker-free formulations that were substantially filled at 26.3% by weight were also included for
comparison (Table 6.31 and Figure 6.33a).
As opposed to the dual-cure crosslinker-free formulations, highly catalyzed hybrids exhibited noticeable advan-
tages, such as lower Tpeak below 120 ∘C and Tonset and Tg lower than 85 ∘C (Figure 6.33a), all in favor of faster
cure completion at the underlying 125 ∘C. It was necessary to reduce filler loading levels for hybrids to pro-
duce MDF panels with a sufficiently smooth PCI finish of 5–7 at 4–5 mils. Unfortunately, hybrids on MDFs that
were subjected to an oven post-cure setting of 125 ∘C for 10 min were severely under-cured, that is, 69.1% cured
against 76.0% cured for the dual-cure crosslinker-free formulations (Table 6.31). As determined experimentally,
the incorporation of carbodiimide (refer to Figure 3.11a in Chapter 3), such as Nisshinbo Chemical’s Carbodilite
HMV-15CA (solid, EW 262) and V-02B (liquid, EW 600), to be converted into a free-flowing powder (refer to phys-
ical semi-encapsulation in Chapter 8) prior to formulation, as a co-crosslinker of COOH-functional polyesters,
performed quite well with respect to toughness and a smooth finish, whereas a comparable cure level was retained.

DSC exothermic proﬁles for (a) dual-cure crosslinker-free (the blue curves using a Type 1.5 epoxy resin) and
hybrid formulations (the green curves using a Type 2.0 epoxy resin) in Table 6.31, and (b) Sherwin-Williams France’s Powdura
Sprint White A 1704, a salable polyester powder coating for MDFs.
Otherwise, the hybrid coating’s mechanical and physical properties were observably compromised by under-cure.
The optimal cure temperature range for these hybrid systems was found to be between 130 ∘C and 150 ∘C.
For clarification, in these additional ultra-LAT epoxy formulations (Table 6.31), Micral 1500 is aluminum
trihydrate (ATH) with a fine particle size average of 1.5μm incorporated for even cold sprayability on MDF panels,
and S-345-N5 is a micronized polyethylene wax with a melting point of 110 ∘C to address grain raise or puff
issues that are specific to wood substrates. For hybrid formulations, epoxy resins should be used so that their pbw
addition levels are greater than those of the polyester resins in order to improve flow and leveling. Reiterating,
one of the disadvantages of using Type 1.5 resins, with the exception of hybrids, is that the cured Tg will likely
end up over 120 ∘C, which is near to the desired curing temperature of 125 ∘C, causing concerns about harmful
vitrification during curing. In another aspect, filler overloading impedes cure completion; for instance, 26.3% of
filler loadings in dual-cure Type 1.5 and 10.55% of filler loadings in hybrid Type 1.9 reduced cure levels from over
90% to below 80% and 70%, respectively. Therefore, filler loadings in both types of formulations should be tuned
such that adequate cure (up to 90%) can be achieved on thermally insulating MDF panels. According to historical
and statistical data, an under-cure level of up to 5−10% for FBEs has no or limited effect on physical performance
as a whole.
Figure 6.33b demonstrates the DSC exotherms of a commercially available free-radical unsaturated polyester
powder coating, designed for a textured flow with a recommended cure schedule of 3–7 min at 130 ∘C and 3 mil
DFT, for comparison. Specifically, this coating exhibited a sharp slope (equivalent to m = 0.95, close to 1.0) before
Tpeak = 110.6 ∘C, indicating a rapid curing reaction upon free-radical initiation, consistent with a gel time of 4.3 sec
at 250 ∘F and negligible flow. Residue 𝛥H = −13.84 J/g (versus −79.099 J/g initially) when sprayed onto MDF
panels and cured at 125 ∘C for 10 min (refer to Appendix B), corresponding to a cure level of 82.5% (consistent with
a long tail in the DSC exotherm relating to the reaction order n value greater than 3.50), resulting in a smooth matte
finish and excellent adhesion and impact resistance. Dual exothermic peaks imply the presence of two separate
cure reactions. Other formulation and processing advice for ultra-LAT epoxy powder coatings may include, but is
not limited to, the following: i) The optimal temperature settings for a twin-screw extruder are 60/90 ∘C (Zones
III/IV). ii) Powder particle sizes are controlled such that they are excessively fine, such as D10 = 35–40 μm and D90
= 80–85 μm. iii) Spray voltages of, for instance, around 60 kV for robust film buildup and adhesion. iv) Depending
on formulations, it is suitably filled to improve edge coverage and see-through. v) The moisture content of wood
panels varies greatly from lot to lot, but a minimum of 8% is necessary for conductive sprayability. vi) Hydrophilic

dry flow agents are preferred over hydrophobic ones. vii) White, gray, and black are entirely adaptable colors. viii)
The application of waterborne conductive primers prior to preheating and spraying may or may not be beneficial.
The physical advantages of such epoxy formulations include storage and transport at ambient temperature, as
opposed to the low storage temperatures necessary for formulations such as unsaturated polyesters and free-radical
peroxides.
Debrief C Primers, epoxy primers, and epoxy powder primers
This sectional topic of primers purportedly serves as a bridge between the preceding discussion of liquid coatings
(refer to Section 6.1) and the following discussion of powder coatings (refer to Section 6.2) in the context. Primers
perform to provide priming purposes, including but not limited to establishing physical adhesion or bonding
strength between the substrate and the subsequent topcoat (e.g., polyurethane or PUR, polyester, acrylic, polyurea,
epoxy), penetrating and sealing porous substrates (e.g., wood, concrete, etc.), and improving edge coverage.
A diverse range of primers are commercially available, including 2K SB (e.g., Sherwin-Williams’ P60G2 wash
primer; refer to Table 9.9 in Chapter 9), 1K WB (including e-coatings), and powder-based in terms of the carrier
medium, as well as primers in terms of chemistry, including epoxy, phenolic, PUR, and acrylic, among others,
for a wide variety of substrates and applications. An appropriate primer selected for a specific project can, among
other functions, block stains and odors, resist mold and rust, and so forth. Primers are sometimes indispensable
to long-lasting surface protection against corrosion and other forms of degradation, such as in general industrial
uses, as outlined in Figure 6.34, where an epoxy powder primer and a polyester topcoat are demonstrated.
Epoxy resins that can develop strong direct-to-substrate adhesion and structural cohesion are likely the most
favored reactive primer platform for ferrous metal substrates. Epoxy powder primers are increasingly replacing
2K SB epoxy primers, primarily because of recyclability and concerns about VOC-associated emissions (refer
to Table 4.1 in Chapter 4). Epoxy powder primers, which are zinc-rich (such as Sherwin-Williams’ Powdura®
EAS6-C0025, PPG′s Envirocron® PrimeronTM Zinc, and IFS’s ELSS 72683) or zinc-free (such as PPG′s Envirocron®
PCMT70101), exhibit superior performance compared to alternative chemistries across a wide array of applica-
tions. These primers offer enhanced corrosion protection for both steel (including galvanized steel) and aluminum
substrates, such as gas and liquid tanks, pipelines, trucks, trailers, auto parts, boats, structural metalwork, and
more. However, for a thin film (e.g., 2–6 mils) of a powder topcoat to be electrostatically sprayed at room tem-
perature, liquid or powder primers, including epoxy powder primers, should be electrically conductive or at least
semi-conductive. It is unnecessary for a primer to be conductive when preheated substrates (primed or unprimed)
are coated with a powder overcoat via either spraying or fluidized bed dipping; this is applicable to thick coating
films exceeding, for example, 6–8 mils.
Epoxy powder primers, whether zinc-rich or zinc-free, are better formulated to cure slowly at a specific
application cure temperature in order to allow physical adhesion to substrates and the chemical morphology of

6 Formulation Case Studies
outer surfaces to anchor the subsequent topcoat. In conjunction with an amine (e.g., ADH) or phenolic crosslinker
(e.g., KD-404J and KD-405) and a catalyst at a light loading (e.g., 0.60 phr), zinc-rich primers can be formulated
using epoxies or a modified grade with a medium to high MW. The catalyst can be an anionically tertiary amine,
imidazole, or imidazole adduct, or a cationically BX3 (boron trihalide)•amine complex (preferably coupled with
an acidic crosslinker, e.g., phenolic, anhydride, etc.). Epoxy powder primers are desired to have adequate but not
excessive flow for wetting, non-sagging, and excellent edge coverage. Significantly, in the formulation of zinc-rich
primers, the loading level of zinc ducts (e.g., with an average particle size of 5.5 μm or less) can reach 65% by
weight, resulting in a powder density of probably as high as 2.80–2.85 g/cm3. Dense zinc particles present in
zinc-rich powder primers fulfill dual roles—primarily passive corrosion protection and secondarily conductivity.
Nevertheless, high density compromises the deliverable sprayability and flowability of the powder. Epoxy powder
primers are anticipated to produce uniform thin-film coatings with fine powder particle sizes, such as D10 = 10
μm, D50 = 32.0 μm, and D90 = 70.0 μm.
Instead, zinc-free powder primers characterized by low density, for example, down to 1.50–1.60 g/cm3, which
is only slightly higher than typical powder coatings, are up-trending due to user-friendly handling and sprayabil-
ity. To address film buildup and electrostatic spray of such powder primers, semi-conductive fillers and pigments
such as carbon-based (e.g., carbon black, graphene, carbon nanowires or CNWs, and carbon nanotubes or CNTs),
silicon carbide (SiC), nickel, metal-coated, and ceramic fillers (e.g., zinc oxide), in addition to conductive metal
particles with light density such as aluminum, silver, etc. (to a lesser extent), may find applicable values in replace-
ment of zinc-rich technology. In one embodiment, PPG′s commercial Envirocron® PCMT70101 has been thermally
characterized, with DSC and DMA results presented in Figure 6.35. This low-gloss zinc-free powder primer has a
density of 1.56 g/cm3 and a typical gel time of approximately 31.0 sec at 400 ∘F by a hot plate.
This commercial powder has an uncured melting point of 49.8 ∘C and a cured Tg value of 102.9 ∘C, as
determined by DSC run at 7.0 ∘C/min (Figure 6.35a); the heat of crosslinking reactions, peak temperature,
and onset temperature are 55.52 J/g, 177.5 ∘C, and 154.2 ∘C, respectively. In addition, alongside the principal
exothermic peak observed at 177.5 ∘C, a minor shoulder peak appears at 168.9 ∘C. This shoulder peak corresponds
ostensibly to a distinct epoxy co-resin present in the formulation, which differs purportedly in terms of the MW,
EEW, and melting point (essentially analogous to the exothermic profile illustrated in Figure 6.19a). The exother-
mic curve following Tpeak exhibits a lengthy tail, which signifies slow cure. The kinetic parameters obtained
for this primer formulation according to an autocatalytic model are as follows: A = 25,000, Ea = 53,700 J/mol,

m = 0.70, and n = 1.10. Its slow-cure property is determined by its high activation energy (Ea), which is intrinsi-
cally defined by the formulation, including the catalyst(s). On rheology (Figure 6.35b), which was also conducted
at a heating rate of 7.0 ∘C/min, this powder primer exhibits unusual dual minimum complex viscosity (𝜂*min)
events at 110.3 ∘C and 151.2 ∘C (similar to Figure 6.19b), which confirms the constituents of two epoxy resins;
however, the powder is only minimally cured at both temperatures. The dynamic viscosity (𝜂*, the black curve)
and modulus (storage G′ and loss G′′, the blue and green curves, respectively) profiles exhibit a comparable trend
from 80 ∘C to 180 ∘C, the temperature range in which 𝜂*min and gelation develop. The nominal gelation takes
place at 120.2 ∘C with a low modulus of 2,462 Pa, in between two 𝜂*min events and well ahead of the occurrence
of Tpeak at 177.5 ∘C. This epoxy powder primer appears to have minimal flow, as evidenced by an oven pill flow of
16.8 mm (0.50-g pills at 350 ∘F) and a DMA flow index of 0.81 1/Pa. The cure kinetic ODE (listed in Figure 6.35a)
specifies that the cure times for this powder primer range from 609.6 sec (to a cure level of 𝛼= 99.0%) to 892.8 sec
(to a cure level of 𝛼= 99.9%), that is, a minimum of 10–15 min, at 350 ∘F or 177 ∘C. The primer contains an
estimated 30% by weight of fillers and pigments, as determined by TGA at a heating rate of 20.0 ∘C/min up to
600 ∘C. The fillers and pigments are predominantly composed of TiO2, Zn, carbon black, BaSO4; to a less extent,
SWNTs (single-walled nanotubes; e.g., Tuball’s Matrix Beta 809); and to the least extent, SiC (3.1 g/cm3), overall
consistent with the formulations disclosed in their patent application for zinc-rich powder coatings [36].
In contrast, according to recent news [37], Europolveri has launched a new epoxy powder primer Anticorro-
sion11 Plus 6L4871113T0C0, a conductive zinc-based primer that combines zinc phosphate for corrosion and an
antistatic additive for conductivity. The presence of zinc phosphate fillers improves the barrier effect by increasing
the coating’s resistance to oxidation, rust formation, and delamination with reduced costs and increased service
life, even if exposed to particularly severe environmental conditions. In addition, this primer has proved to be
particularly effective in covering sharp edges (even those created by laser cutting of metal sheets) with adequate
thickness.
Debrief D Illustration of ﬁrst-order reaction (n ≈1.0 and m = 0) epoxy formulations
It was contemplated what the exothermic appearance and behavior of an applied epoxy coating formulation with a
first reaction order (or n = 1) would be when the nth order model was described in Subsection 5.1.4 of Chapter 5.
Table 6.32 presents one such embodiment on an FBE platform, where the autocatalytic kinetic parameters, includ-
ing the reaction orders m and n, are consistently determined by means of the DCS estimation (refer to Figure 5.6
for details).
According to Table 6.32, the FBE powder coating is composed of dual novolac resins (i.e., Types 4 and 7 mod-
ified, respectively) in combination with triple curing agents (4, 4′-DDS, DICY, and OTB; refer to Figures 2.2a/f
and Table 2.2b in Chapter 2, respectively), yielding an overall FI = 1.124 with an excess of epoxy resins. It is
worth mentioning that the melting points of 4, 4′-DDS, and OTB are in close proximity at 144–148 ∘C, which is
significantly lower than that of DICY at 208 ∘C. As a result, DSC exotherms (Figure 6.36a) reveal a minor shoulder
peak (corresponding to OTB and 4, 4′-DDS) preceding the primary peak at 245.2 ∘C (corresponding to DICY). The
substantial latent nature of the FBE formula is due to its elevated Ea value of 62,900 J/mol. In accordance with its
elevated Tpeak, dynamic or isothermal curing necessitates a cure temperature exceeding its Tpeak, preferably greater
than 250 ∘C or reaching 300 ∘C. The DSC exothermic curve fitting provides an approximation of the reaction order
m as zero and the reaction order n as 1.09, which is close to one or the first order. The data clearly indicates that
the exothermic curve, represented by the blue curve in Figure 6.36a, exhibits a symmetric slope (approximately
45∘) and a “bell” shape prior to and following Tpeak. The symmetry conforms to a normal distribution spanning
from the actual Tonset = 117.0 ∘C, which attains an extent of cure, or 𝛼onset = 0.50%, to T = 329.9 ∘C, which signifies
complete curing of the coating (or 𝛼end = 99.95%), as outlined in Figure 6.36a. Greatly surpassing 50%, the extent
of cure (𝛼) at Tpeak was determined to be 64.3%, indicating that curing occurred rapidly after thermal activation.
The second DSC scan (represented by the green curve in Figure 6.36a) determines the ultimate Tg to be 101.7 ∘C,

falling within the generic Tg capacity (< 120 ∘C) that was previously deliberated. As a result, it is anticipated that
this FBE powder coating will gel before Tpeak at 245.2 ∘C or the maximum cure rate ( ̇𝛼max), which is approximately
between 236.6 ∘C and 241.0 ∘C according to kinetic analysis. As shown in Figure 6.36b, the cure curves for this

are consistent with practically verified cure schedules, such as 10 min at 450 ∘F.

mulations. Structure-property relationships and crosslinking chemistry are the fundamentals of high-performance

epoxy coatings. In one aspect of applied formulation, it is about the selection of epoxies and hardeners, including
specialties and those of unique monomeric or polymeric structures, such as fluorene-based monomers and similar
compounds (e.g., PPP-BP-derived resins); in another aspect of advanced formulation, it relies on cure chemistry
design and maximal synergy of compositions, such as optimization of FIs for super flexibility, the use of dual-cure
catalysts for faster cure responses and improved toughness, and so on. As far as DTM epoxy coatings are concerned,
the most important performance characteristics include durable adhesion (substrate-specific; refer to Chapter 10),
Tg, flexibility, modulus and cohesive toughness, impermeability and chemical resistance, and dielectrics, among
others.
For 1K SB epoxy coatings that are acceptable for structural lamination, formulas with latent amine curing
agents, such as DICY and DDS, are typically utilized. These formulations are moderately catalyzed and cure rather
slowly. Silanes (either epoxy- or amine-functional) are frequently added for coupling and adhesion, and FIs greater
than two are typically used to facilitate epoxy homo-curing. Amine-reactive acrylate and epoxy-reactive phenol
accelerators are optionally loaded in Part A of epoxies and Part B of amine blends, respectively, for 2K liquid epoxy
coatings suitable for fast-cure surface linings at ambient temperature. However, extended cure times may still be
required unless heat is applied to accelerate the curing process. In Part A, epoxy binder resins are often coupled
with reactive flexibilizers, and in Part B, a couple of amines, such as Mannich bases, may be combined to constitute
an effective amine curing agent package. In 2K liquid systems that are more FI forgiving, the FI can be formu-
lated at less than 1.0, and silanes can be added to formulations at up to 0.5% by weight. The advantages of liquid
epoxy coatings with a high solids content, or 100%, are their flow, leveling, and coverage of the intended sub-
strates, while the disadvantages are obviously their poor flexibility, toughness, and comparatively low Tg. Highly
filled functional coatings, adhesives, and sealants are likely to build up viscosity, resembling pastes that can be
metrically dispensed by weight rather than volume.
As an applied platform, epoxy powder coatings enable the development of functional coatings with superior
Tg, flexibility, toughness, adhesion, and impermeability, individually or in combination, compared to liquid epoxy
coatings, including SB epoxy coatings. Powder formulations are often relevant to SB liquids since they are mutu-
ally transformable with the use of appropriate solvents. The FI is perhaps one of the most essential factors in
epoxy formulations, as it regulates the ratio of epoxy homo-cures and co-polymerization, which, in turn, deter-
mines the ultimate network topology after curing. Generic epoxy coating formulations are tolerant of FIs and
continue to function when an FI is less than, equal to, or greater than one, albeit not necessarily at their peak
performance. Thus, FI-driven screening and optimization are effective in maximizing coating performance (e.g.,
flexibility), especially for systems with a fixed resin and crosslinker package. There is always an optimal FI for a
given maximum structural performance under a particular catalyzation condition (a constant grade and level).
In other words, for a given FI, there exists an optimal loading level of a specific catalyst for a proposed trait to be
superior.
Promoted by either anionic or cationic catalysts or appropriate combinations and practically applicable to
liquid coatings, crosslinker-free epoxy formulations essentially extend the FI to infinity (or ∞), that is, 100%
epoxy homo-polymerization of linear ether linkages in the crosslinked network, which should, in theory,
maximize flexibility. Due to the randomness of physical entanglements, crosslinker-free formulations are not
necessarily the most flexible; rather, formulations built in tandem with a specific quantity of co-polymerization
or at a specific FI ≠∞exhibit the highest flexibility, sustaining crack-free bending. Formulation effectiveness
and product performance are determined by the FI in terms of the optimal ratio or combination of co- and
homo-polymerization in the cured and bulkily amorphous network. For example, achieving a maximum
flexibility requires a certain amount of co-polymerization; in other words, coatings fabricated in tandem with a
specific quantity of co-polymerization or at a specific FI ≠∞exhibit the greatest flexibility, resisting maximum
bending stresses. Epoxy homo-cures, driven by a chain-growth mode, typically occur after epoxy-crosslinker
co-polymerization (driven by a step-growth mode), but proceed more rapidly once activated. Both intended

272
6 Formulation Case Studies
chemical curing of resins and/or monomers and random physical entanglements of polymeric chains are
responsible for epoxy crosslinking architecture and morphology.
In addition, the curing kinetics and structural performance of crosslinker-free formulations as functional
coatings are not universal, as they are driven by 100% epoxy homo-polymerization in accordance with their
Tgs that will be developed during curing, which are chemically and physically combined. Crosslinker-free
formulations with a Tg below 120 ∘C are robustly advantageous in multiple respects, including Tg, gel time,
toughness, impermeability barrier performance, adhesion, and bulk resin homogeneity, but not necessarily in
terms of a maximum flexibility. Multiple disadvantages are exhibited by crosslinker-free formulations with a Tg
over 120 ∘C (entry level > 120 ∘C, moderate > 150 ∘C, elevated > 180 ∘C, and severe or super > 200 ∘C), including
under-curing concerns, but not necessarily adhesion, barrier properties, or vitrification, with 𝜂*min depending
on the formulation design (including catalysts) and the initial MWs and viscosity of the epoxy resin(s) and/or
monomer(s), and with gelation depending on the Tg to be developed. Unless properly fabricated and catalyzed,
crosslinker-free epoxy systems with Tgs near to or greater than 200 ∘C are not recommended as functional
coatings. Instead, crosslinker-free formulations of epoxies as functional coatings are best suited for generic
Tg (≤120 ∘C) systems, such as functional FBEs, clearcoats, injection molding, including benchtop molding,
self-contained 3D printing, carbon fiber or glass fiber-reinforced epoxy polymer composites, and advanced
insulated metal substrate lamination for PCBs, among other applications.
Minor discrepancies in structure may result in substantial variations in performance. Regardless of whether they
are cured by an amine or a phenolic, BPF-based epoxies are shown to have lower Tg, flexibility, and toughness than
their BPA-based equivalents. BPF-based epoxies are naturally acid-resistant; according to CDT and HWA testing,
despite low Tgs, their significantly lower viscosity complements their outstanding adhesion, moisture resistance,
and heat resistance. Aliphatic epoxies are less reactive than aromatic epoxies, and they are incompatible unless
they are combined in formulations with a proper ratio. With the exception of UV protection, it appears that inte-
grating an aliphatic epoxy resin into a bulky aromatic system provides no further benefit, including flexibility. On
the other hand, siloxane-modified amines of an intermediate EW-NH, such as 240 g/eq, as the sole crosslinker
perform better than others (higher or lower EW-NH) in terms of compatibility, adhesion, and moisture resistance
at a given FI of, say, 2.22.
None or only phenyl esters or ester-substituted phenolics are active ester crosslinkers of epoxies; cure reactions
follow the same crosslinking pathway as phenyl hydroxyl-epoxide interactions. The prominent characteristic of
active phenyl esters crosslinking epoxies is the elimination of secondary −OH formation, which is characteristic
of regular epoxy cure reactions with amines and phenolics, permanently altering the polarity and hydrophilicity of
the cured system and influencing its moisture resistance and dielectric properties. Active ester-based epoxy formu-
lations demonstrate superior adhesion, dimensional stability, and dielectric strength. Due to newly created ester
linkages that are vulnerable to hydrolysis, however, the water resistance of the resultant coating products is poor,
especially at temperatures above 75 ∘C. Likewise, coatings formulated with 1,3-PBO as the crosslinker to produce
fresh amide-ether chains are susceptible to water attacks at elevated temperatures. For the objective of increasing
flexibility, bifunctional active ester crosslinkers with an aliphatic chain between two aromatic functional ends are
preferred. Active ester-epoxy and PBO-epoxy formulations are not confined to the theoretical 1-to-1 molar ratio
but should be tuned with respect to the FI for optimal performance and desired end uses, such as busbar and
dielectric insulation. Active esters and 1,3-PBO require the same catalyzation and curing schedules as normal
amine or phenolic crosslinkers, enhancing and diversifying the formulation tools for epoxy coatings and similar
systems.
Perhaps for the first time in the history of applied epoxy coatings, fluorene or fluorenyl cardo group-based epoxy
monomers and analogous materials make innovative five-in-one (i.e., high Tg, flexibility, toughness, adhesion,
and impermeability) coating solutions readily accessible. Regardless of whether conventional amine or pheno-
lic crosslinkers are utilized, fluorene epoxies allow formulators to obtain any Tg between 180 ∘C and 250 ∘C,
depending on their loading levels in an appropriate resin package. Although multi-functional fluorene epoxies

Recaps and Highlights
273
are accessible, the distinctive bulkily stacked aromatic structures of difunctional fluorenes that confer physical
entanglements on top of chemical crosslinking are responsible for their exceptional Tg properties. In addition,
these fluorenes drive high-Tg formulations exhibiting great flexibility (due to their structurally rotational nature),
excellent toughness in terms of impact resistance (due to their structural bulkiness), exceptional adhesion (due in
part to aromaticity, low melt, and massive flow), and superior water resistance (due to their structural hydropho-
bicity and non-polarity), making them highly suitable for a wide range of HTHP applications. Monomers such
as PPP-BP-based epoxies exhibit comparable performance (due to their structural similarities) with the exception
of moisture resistance likely due to the presence of polar and hydrophilic moieties. Fluorene amines and pheno-
lics and the like (e.g., phthalide cardo group-based PPP-BP phenolics) as crosslinkers of even generic BPA-based
and novolac epoxy resins provide coating products with superlative flexibility (e.g., BAF for rebar formulations)
and/or toughness (e.g., up to 160 lb-in in impact resistance). When employed in conjunction with fluorene epoxies,
fluorene crosslinkers are complementary in nearly all respects, including Tg; formulations of such combinations
sometimes demonstrate unique kinetic and rheological behaviors (e.g., dual exothermic peaks in DSC and corre-
spondingly pseudo-dual 𝜂*min in DMA). Vitrification during the cure of high-Tg formulations, including fluorene
epoxy-based formulations, is detrimental to cure completion and must be addressed by employing a high enough
cure temperature and a long enough post-cure time. As a result, epoxy formulations with a Tg capacity over 250 ∘C
are no longer desirable because their cure is difficult to achieve in practice. The heat-resistant Tg gap between
250 ∘C and 350 ∘C are mostly filled by specialty polymers or high-performing matrix resins, such as polyimides,
cyclotene, and phthalonitrile; Tgs beyond 350 ∘C are territories covered by silicones; all of these non-epoxy systems
are covered exclusively in Chapter 9. Still, and particularly in the case of DICY-cured formulations with moderate
to high Tgs, the maximum post-cure temperature should not exceed 250 ∘C in order to avoid crosslinking reversal
or a cured Tg reduction.
In certain epoxy systems, latent cationic catalysts like onium (e.g., ammonium and phosphonium) salts are
compatible with tertiary amines (weakly basic), including imidazoles, but not with primary or secondary amines
(strongly anionic). Cationic salts are not viably effective or effectively viable if used alone as the only catalyst in
crosslinker-free systems, and they are preferably and compatibly employed in tandem with one or more tertiary
amines constituting dual cure, more preferably with a phenolic (weakly acidic) crosslinker, and most preferably
with a phenolic crosslinker and tertiary amines (constituting trios) in formulations. In both dual cure and trio
formulations, the optimal loading level of an onium salt to confer efficacy is determined to be approximately 0.35
phr, subject to verification over time. As catalysts in epoxy-phenolic coating formulations, BX3•amine complexes
generally outperform onium salts such as tributyl(ethyl)phosphonium diethylphosphate (i.e., Cyphos IL 169) and
ETPPI, which are more effective than other organometallic complexes such as ZnAcAc and AlAcAc. Dual-cure for-
mulations, when tailor-formulated, improve cure responses and cohesive toughness to minimize micro-cracking
upon cold bending (e.g., for rebar applications).
Other than highly aromatic fluorenes, specialty and miscellaneous epoxies, including DCPD (dicyclopentadi-
ene), adamantane, and PBD (polybutadiene) derivatives, are primarily modifications of standard difunctional
BPA-based resins for niche structural properties, such as adhesion by fluorination, flexibility and elasticity by
aliphatic and elastomeric amendments, and toughness by liquid crystalline, among many others. All marketed
or stated performance should not be taken for granted unless it has been verified through testing and real-world
applications. Unique crosslinkers, such as Noryl SA-90, distinguish themselves from fluorene amines, fluorene
phenolics, and active esters by enabling inventive dual Tg coating formulations when utilized on their own.
Dual Tg FBEs may be alternatively formulated by combining multiple resins and hardeners with drastically
dissimilar equivalent weights and melting temperatures without being constrained to particular resins or
crosslinkers.
As far as functional powder coatings or FBEs are concerned, applied formulations with super flexibility and fast
gel and cure are not restricted to a particular cure chemistry; both amines (e.g., SDH and BAF) and BPA-derived
phenolics as the crosslinker are validated, provided that structurally flexible resins or a resin package and

274
6 Formulation Case Studies
optimized catalyzation are concurrently secured. FBEs with extraordinary toughness and adhesion, as well as Tgs
ranging from 180 ∘C to 250 ∘C (if required) can be readily formulated employing fluorene monomers, including
epoxies as the binder and BAF, BPF, or BCF as the crosslinker, either alone or in combination. In addition,
ultra-LAT (e.g., cure at as low as 125 ∘C in 10 min) epoxy powder formulations for thermally sensitive and
non-traditional substrates, including MDFs, are otherwise very fast-cure products at regular cure temperatures
that are not limited to any specific cure chemistry either, and they are tailor formula-table using a preferably
low-melting point crosslinker such as VDH (a dihydrazide amine) or probably MOCA (an aromatic amine) and
KD-427 (a phenolic), a dual-cure (combined with crosslinker-free) technique, and a COOH-functional polyester
hybrid where dual-cure remains optionally applicable. Epoxies with low-melting points but not too low MWs,
such as Types 1.9 and 2, are preferable regardless of the ultra-LAT formulation approaches. Even when fillers
are properly selected and not overloaded, the greatest concern with powder coatings, including free-radical
polyesters, on poorly conductive MDF substrates is still under-curing; accelerators such as acrylamides, if suitably
incorporated, may or may not aid in addressing the issue. Slow-curing zinc-free epoxy powder primers are viably
emerging in lieu of epoxy liquid primers.
Kinetic first-order (m = 0, n ≈1) epoxy formulations are achievable in practical applications. These formula-
tions generally exhibit a symmetric exothermic curve and a nearly 45-degree slope vertically through the Tpeak,
indicating that upon activation, these coatings tend to cure rapidly till completion.

Phenolic Coatings
Phenolic resins generally fall within the broader category of epoxies, and they possess functional Ph-OH groups
(very weakly acidic in nature) in their molecular structures and are functionally reactive toward epoxies,
isocyanates, and bismaleimides (BMI) under certain conditions [1]. There are a couple of specific concepts
and chemical compounds that should be described in the introduction. Important and relevant monomers
include phenol (MW 94.1, Tm 40.5 ∘C, and pKa ≈10.0, Figure 7.1a) and bisphenol-A (CAS# 80-05-7, MW 228.3,
Tm 159 ∘C, and pKa ≈10.2, Figure 7.1b), that is, 4,4′-Isopropylidenediphenol or BPA. Phenol is tri-functional
(ortho- or o-, meta- or m-, and para- or p-) and mono-phenyl hydroxyl (Ph-OH), whereas BPA is para-structured
and bifunctional in terms of Ph-OH. Bifunctional BPA monomers are widely employed in the production of
polycarbonates and solid epoxy resins (i.e., higher-type BPA-based epoxies; refer to Figure 1.1 in Chapter 1).
Bisphenol-S (abbreviated as BPS, pKa 7.4–10.4, Figure 7.1c) is a BPA analogue. In addition, and notably, TMBPF
(bifunctional in terms of Ph-OH, Figure 7.1d; also refer to Figures 1.13d/e in Chapter 1) is a new coating-oriented
as a safer alternative to BPA and BPF for use in epoxy coatings of aluminum and steel cans.
7.1
Phenolic Resins and Derivatives
Phenolics or phenolic resins are typically divided into two classes: i) conventional phenol-formaldehyde (or PF)
resins that do not contain BPA or its structural derivatives, also known as phenol-based and non-BPA grades, and
ii) BPA-based phenolic resins that contain free BPA and/or its reacted analogues. Phenolics, as focused on in this
chapter, therefore, include both phenol-based (non-BPA) PF resins and BPA-based (non-phenol) resins. Please
note that i) resoles are not limited to PF chemistry and can also be made from BPA-formaldehyde; ii) o-, m-, and
p-cresol are specific to methyl-substituted phenols in the ortho-, meta, and para-positions, respectively; iii) car-
danol (Figure 7.1e), a major component of cashew nutshell liquid (CNSL), represents a phenol m-substituted by
an unsaturated hydrocarbon chain, such as C15H31-2n [2], and 1K mono-f cardanol derived alkyd-type coatings
have recently been reported [3]; iv) tannic acid (Figure 7.1j) is triple Ph-OH functional, partially similar to pyro-
gallic acid (PGA; refer to Subsection 5.1.8.4 In Chapter 5) with chelating reactivity; and v) novolac phenolics
photopolymerize in the presence of UV light, whereas resole phenolics photodegrade. In addition, polyphenols,
as briefly depicted and circled in red in Figure 7.1j, are effective radical scavengers [4].
7.1.1
BPA-based phenolic resins
BPA-derived phenolics (Figure 7.1f), one class of major commercial phenolic resins, that is, products of BPA
monomers reacting with liquid BPA-based epoxy resins, are generally latent and thermally stable, in a solid form
due to high enough MWs, relatively less UV sensitive, strictly para-structured with di-functional Ph-OHs on
both ends (circled in red, Figure 7.1f), and particularly suitable as curatives for formulating flexible and tough

epoxy powder coatings. In accordance with the principles of structure-property relationships, BPA-based pheno-
lics confer superior flexibility due to their di-functionality and linear p/p-structures, as discussed about functional
FBE formulations (refer to Table 6.4 in Chapter 6).
Notably, BPA-derived phenolics contain considerable levels of free BPA over 25% by weight when the resin’s
EW-PhOH is at around 250 g/eq, reducing to approximately 15% at 380 g/eq and down to 5.0% at around 700 g/eq,
according to LC-UV analysis of commercial resin samples 50 times diluted in acetonitrile (Figure 7.2). The
presence of free BPA monomers does not appear to have a tangible impact on coating performance, including
curing behaviors and even cured flexibility; however, EHS (environment, health, and safety) concerns are raised
when they are in service in contact with commercial hot water (82 ∘C) per NSF61/600 specifications. KD-452
(EW-PhOH 530, Kukdo Chemical), an exclusive BPA-based phenolic grade with zero free BPA, is one of the
preferred crosslinkers for NSF61/600 compliant formulations that also utilize benzene-free epoxy resins, such
as Araldite GT 7255 (refer to Table 1.3 in Chapter 1). Additionally, BPA-based phenolic resins with moderate to
high EW-PhOHs and low levels of free BPA monomers, such as KD-427, DEH 87 (equivalent to KD-427), and
KD-448, are all observed to be more compatible with novolac epoxies in FBE formulations than KD-405 and
DEH85 (equivalent to KD-405) with low EW-PhOHs and high levels of free BPA monomers, as defects as fisheyes,
craters, etc. on cured coating film surfaces are largely eliminated. At the conclusion of this chapter, a simple
UV/visible method for quantifying the Ph-OH content of BPA-based phenolic resins is described. Moreover, and
structurally, BPA-based phenolics have a secondary aliphatic hydroxyl (OH) in the repeating unit (circled in blue,

majority, if not all, of polyols for polyurethanes (PUR) contain both reactive primary (1∘) and secondary (2∘)
aliphatic OH groups, which are weaker acids than aromatic Ph-OH groups and so require elevated temperatures
or catalysts if reactions with epoxies are desired at all. As a crosslinker, Fineplus AC-2410 (EW-OH 56, EEW 530)
from Reichhold is essentially an aliphatic OH-functional acrylic polymer along with epoxide functionality.
7.1.2
Novolac and resole phenolic resins
Figure 7.1g/h depict the primary commercial non-BPA phenolic resins, which are phenol-based novolacs and
resoles. These multi-functional phenolic compounds are consistently between 104 and 120 g/eq in terms of
EW-PhOH (equivalent to a phenol molecule), readily crosslinking epoxies, and isocyanates upon thermal
activation. Particularly, resole phenolics (Figure 7.1h), under heat, have a tendency to inter-condensate via
Ph-OH and methylene groups (Figure 7.3a) [7], as well as to inter-crosslink via a Diels−Alder ring-forming
reaction of the methylol ether groups (−CH2-O-CH2−) (Figure 7.3b) [8]; consequently, they are the preferred
resins of choice for liquid and powder direct-to-metal primers. Table 7.1 presents an example of a liquid primer
formulation based on butylated resole phenolic, where the resole resin is apparently the only binder component
in the system. Specifically, GP BKS-2600 is a resole PF resin at 54.0% solids, 700−1,100 cPs (25 ∘C), and pH
4.5−5.0 in ethanol supplied by ASK Chemicals/Georgia-Pacific, and there are various offsets to it if necessary,
such as Durez, Bakelite PF, Phenodur PR, Phenalloy, Varcum, etc., the majority of which are butylated liquids
(refer to Table 7.2). GLYEO, like GLYMO (refer to Figure 10.10a-3 in Chapter 10), is a mono-epoxy functional
organosilane employed in the formula as an adhesion promoter, whereas Organosilane G301 is a direct offset.
Methanol or denatured ethanol is a low-boiling solvent that should only be processed when the formulation
dispersion temperature runs below 140 ∘F. Optionally, the primer coating can be applied by hand with a spray
gun at an air pressure of 50 psi, and the cure cycle can be optionally 15 min of air drying followed by 30 min
at 180 ∘F and 20 min at 350 ∘F, if required. Note that DSC analysis of this primer sample yielded no exotherm
discouraging its self-crosslinking mechanisms one way or the other; however, tacky resole phenolics do conduct
strong adhesive interactions with metal surfaces via a chelating effect [7] before and after alcohol-type solvents
dry out, as has been observed consistently in practice. In general, resole phenolics are heat reactive and undergo

7.1.3
Non-BPA phenolic resins and bio-derivatives
As illustrated in Figure 7.1i, another commercially available non-BPA phenolic resin grade is polyvinyl-phenol,
that is, poly (4-vinylphenol) or 4-PVP for short, such as Maruzen Petrochemical’s Maruka Lyncur M, which is of
EW-PhOH 120 g/eq (equivalent to phenol-vinyl) and with a narrowly controlled MW and MWD.
Projected to reach USD 19.13 billion in global sales by 2026 [9], non-BPA phenolic resins are ubiquitous and have
enormous commercial utility, including molding compounds [10], foundry and sand casting [9, 11], and coatings
[9, 12, 13] that complement epoxies, among others. Traditional phenol-based novolacs and, in particular, resoles
have been extensively utilized to crosslink epoxies in food packaging can and coil coatings [14]. As depicted in
Figures 7.4a/b, both resoles and novolacs are ortho- and para-structured, with the notable structural difference
being that resoles also contain −CH2-O-CH2−ortho-substitutions while novolacs have only methylene (−CH2−).
As explained previously and illustrated in Figure 7.3, both ortho-methylene and methylol ether groups are func-
tional or reactive in certain thermal circumstances. Resole phenolic resins with ortho-substituted methylol ether
groups reportedly have greater flexibility and shorter gel times than novolacs with mixed methylene replacements
(refer to o/o, o/p, and p/p in Figure 7.4a).
As has been mindfully noted, lignin, an amorphous bio-polyphenol (Tg ∼90 ∘C and Tm ∼170 ∘C for pure lignin;
refer to Figure 2.8a in Chapter 2), has been the subject of growing research efforts for a variety of industrial
applications. To mention a few, lignin-based phenol-formaldehyde and polyurethane resins in adhesives [15],
agricultural fertilizers [16, 17], as well as recently epoxidized lignin [18], waterborne epoxies [19], and powder
coatings [20], are among the many end-use application initiatives. Commercially, Sumitomo Bakelite (i.e., SBHPP)
offers lignin-modified novolac phenolic resin products with multiple Ph-OH functionalities (Figure 7.4c); the
global paper industry also offers a variety of renewable lignin bioproducts as phenolic resin precursors, such as Lig-
nol Energy’s Lignol, Domtar’s Biochoice, Renmatix’s lignin extracted from aqueous fluids, Borregaard Lignotech’s
Marasperse CBOS-4, a grade of lignosulfonate, Huangshan Deping Chemical’s Lunamer MB-68, UPM Biochemi-
cals’ BioPivaTM, and Ecohelix’s Woodmer® [21], among others. When a modified lignin with Ph-OH functionality

as a substitute crosslinker is identified for incorporation, its EW-PhOH, solubility, and melting point should be
evaluated beforehand to prevent blind formulation.
Table 7.2 provides a reference list of representative commercial phenolic resins, including BPA-based, non-BPA
phenol-based, and bio-lignin-based resins, some of which are in solid form and others in liquid form. Specifically,
non-BPA resole PFs are nearly all butylated liquids containing greater than 50% solids, making them suitable for
SB food packaging coatings with the exception of Curaphen 40-815 BX57, which is BPA-based in butanol-xylene
according to its TDS; BPA-based phenolic resins are all solid without exception, making them suitable for epoxy
powder formulations. A solvated resole can be freeze-dried, preferably under vacuum, or heated at 160 ∘C for
60 min to remove water and solvents while maintaining the liquid condition of the resin. Notably, any phenolic
resin containing free BPA monomers is ineligible as a crosslinker candidate for food-contact applications due to
widespread HSE concerns; this may be one of the reasons why resoles are favored in this regard. In the practice of
green chemistry, it is always desired to reduce or remove the amount of free BPA, formaldehyde, and perhaps phe-
nol in coating resins. As molding compounds, solid novolac PFs (such as Bakelite PF 7595) are excellent options;
Albiflex H 1083 S1 (EW-PhOH 200, 20% silicone content, Nanoresins/Evonik) is a phenolic resin typically used
at loadings of 5–15% in replacement of traditional additives such as PVB (polyvinyl butyral), nylon, and rubber
to provide elasticity and strength enhancements to molding compounds of phenolic resins [22]. Lignin-modified
phenolics can be either solid novolacs (e.g., PR-X20084, which is said to balance flexibility with heat resistance)
or liquid resoles. Similar to BPA-based phenolics, which contain free BPA residues unless refined (e.g., KD-452,
a grade free of BPA), generic novolac and resole PFs typically contain free phenol, formaldehyde, or both. For
instance, GP BKR-2620 contains up to 10% by weight of free phenol. Kukdo Chemical and Olin are the leading
industrial manufacturers of solid BPA-based phenolic resins, while SBHPP, Durez, DynaChem, Allnex, Britrez,
and SII are the leading suppliers of liquid resole phenolic resins. Notably, bio-based luteolin (Figure 7.4d) is rec-
ognized as an interesting 4-fold PhOH-functional monomer capable of developing high Tg values comparable to
fluorenes and flame-retardant properties when transformed into epoxies, as reported [23].
On the other hand, and beyond existing phenolics, benzoxazines (BOXs, e.g., Figure 7.4e) are widely regarded as
next-generation phenolic resins [24–27]. BOXs readily undergo self-polymerization (i.e., ring-opening polyaddi-
tion) when thermally initiated, resulting in a hard and brittle polybenzoxazine (PBZ) matrix [28, 29] consisting of i)
Mannich base bridges of −CH2-N(R′)-CH2−rather than −CH2−, and ii) a large amount of newly formed Ph-OHs
that facilitate intra-molecular H-bonding for strong water resistance [27, 29]. In other words, a ring-opened BOX
or the resulting PBZ matrix structurally resembles the ortho-substituted structure of resole phenolics, which is
essential for these phenolics to crosslink other substances such as epoxies, cyclo-vinyl-functional bismaleimides

Possible curing reactions between cyclic unsaturated Nadic diesters and ortho-substituted resole or novolac
phenolics via (a) Diels−Alder ring formation (NOTE: the cleaved molecule with remaining ortho-substitutions continues to
undergo the same reaction until cure completion), (b) vinyl self-crosslinking, and (c) vinyl-PhOH etheriﬁcation.
(BMIs, e.g., Figure 7.4f), and Nadic esters (refer to Figure 7.5). Consecutive Ph-OHs react with oxiranes to produce
BOX-epoxy copolymers [30], with isocyanates to yield BOX-functionalized PURs [31], and with BMIs to gener-
ate BOX-BMI alloys [32, 33]. Also reported are fully eugenol-based epoxy thermosets [34] and a Ph-OH tribrid
resin containing eugenol, siloxane, and BMI with excellent mechanical, thermal, and low-Dk properties [35].
Extensive research has been conducted on BOX and PBZ systems for advanced applications, such as electronic
packaging and aerospace composites, including fiber-reinforced prepregs. When it comes to applied compositions
of advanced and low-VOC industrial coatings, however, there are few accessible resources, particularly regarding
effective formulations and robust catalyzation for cure temperature reductions of BOXs or toughness improve-
ment of PBZs [24, 26, 36] and structural performance of novel BOX systems modified by isocyanates [1, 37, 38]
and BMIs [1, 39, 40].
Dedicated formulators of coatings should always remain abreast of fundamental and applied advancements
and innovations in the fields of epoxies and phenolics. As one of these advancements, bifunctional poly (ary-
lene ethers), that is, polyphenylene ethers (PPEs), supplied as Noryl PPE resins by Sabic Innovative Plastics, are
a type of plastics noted for their excellent resistance, dimensional stability, and intrinsic flame retardancy [41].
Noryl SA-90, as described previously (refer to Table 2.4c in Chapter 2 and Table 6.26 in Chapter 6), is the low-
est MW PPE resin grade; PPE resins are significantly and unexpectedly more soluble in solvents (such as NMP,

286
7 Phenolic Coatings
DMA, N, N-dimethylformamide, and MEK) than their mono-functional analogues, and it has been claimed that
they reduce brittleness or improve toughness of cured thermosets (such as epoxies, cyanate esters, maleimides,
acrylates, and BOXs) in solvent-borne (SB) formulations [42]. As another example within the same scope, and as
shown in Figure 7.3c, novolac phenolics reacting with cyanogen bromide (BrCN) under basic conditions produce
cyanate esters that can be thermally crosslinked to yield a void-free network of phenolic triazine (PT) resins or
polymers (refer to Figure 3.5b in Chapter 3 for BT resins to compare with). Non-BPA PT resins may be used to
crosslink epoxy, for instance, at 465 ∘F (240 ∘C) for 15 sec, for beverage end coatings. Typically, can and bever-
age coil coatings are flash cured at, for instance, 230–250 ∘C for 10–20 sec at a line speed of 590–660 ft/min. Still,
typically, a single beverage can typically have 0.20 g of coatings, comprising a WB epoxy for the side spray, a WB
polyester for the external base, a WB acrylic for the external varnish, and a UV rim coating made from cationic or
acrylic. As for aluminum coil coatings for production of internal can lacquers, a suitable package coating compo-
sitionally includes a resole PF resin as the crosslinker, such as Epikure 200-N-60 of 60% solids in n-butanol, and
a high MW epoxy as the binder resin, such as EPON 1009F, resulting in a highly flexible and adhesive SB coating
of ∼50% solids, which is curable at, for instance, 425 ∘F for 3.5 min. In such an epoxy-phenolic formulation, an
acrylic monomer, such as MAA (methacrylic acid), can be incorporated as an accelerator to expedite resole phe-
nolic crosslinking of epoxies, thereby imparting the excellent adhesion, chemical, and blush resistance required
for food and beverage packaging applications [43].
From coating platform perspectives, in general, but not limited to, and consistent with cure chemistry, as
collectively listed in Table 7.2, solid BPA-based phenolics are suited as crosslinkers to formulate functional
powder coatings or fusion bonded epoxies (FBEs) (refer to Chapter 6 for in-depth discussion), as are novolac
phenolic resins as great molding compounds and as developers in the form of WB emulsions for heat- and
pressure-sensitive paper coatings. In fact, phenolic resins and phenol-based compounds, such as BPA and BPS,
are the natural developers of choice for color-formers in thermal and carbonless paper technology. One or more
of these weakly acidic phenolics contribute protons to color-formers, thus changing the color from light to dark;
ODB-2 and zinc salicylate are alternatives to phenol- and BPA-containing color developers. As for bio-based
and lignin-derived phenolics, they are low-cost alternatives and additive resins with green footprints for a
variety of coatings and adhesives. On the basis that up to 25% of free BPA monomers in BPA-based phenolic
resins (refer to Figure 7.2) and 10% of free phenol monomers in phenol-based phenolics (refer to Table 7.2)
remain acceptable in applied powder and liquid formulations, respectively, it is expected that up to 25% of
low MW lignin derivatives, depending on grades of MWs (solubility and the melting point), can be added as
a secondary crosslinker in generic coatings and adhesives without compromising performance. Particularly,
non-BPA ortho-substituted resole phenolic resins are the most frequently employed crosslinkers in can and
container coil coatings; however, other phenolics having meta-substitution by an unsaturated hydrocarbon chain,
such as cardanol, are also claimed for similar applications [2]. From a bulk resin and chemistry perspective, all
of the phenolic grades listed in Table 7.2 readily cure epoxies and isocyanates, without exception. However, only
novolac and particularly resole phenolic resins with ortho-substitutions (e.g., −CH2−and −CH2-O-CH2−) are
capable of crosslinking BMIs and unsaturated polyesters, including cyclic-vinyl-functional ones, such as Nadic
diesters, via a Diels−Alder ring-forming reaction generating chroman rings (Figure 7.5a). This reaction likely
dominates the unique and exclusive cure reactions of BOX-BMI coating systems because BOX ring-openings
that give rise to ortho-substituted Mannich bridges also enable Diels−Alder reactions, which will be addressed
in one of the following subsections. Other possible reactions involved in the formulation of Nadic di-esters
and ortho-substituted phenolics include vinyl self-crosslinking (Figure 7.5b) and etherification (perhaps the
least, Figure 7.5c). All these reactions under heat are catalyzed by cationic salts (e.g., ETPPI) or organometallic
complexes (e.g., ZnAcAc), in contrast to epoxide-phenolic crosslinking, which is often anionically catalyzed by
tertiary amines, including imidazoles.
Epoxy-phenolic coatings have been extensively explored in Chapter 6 of miscellaneous FBE case studies relat-
ing primarily to BPA-based phenolics with varied MWs and EW-PhOHs, as well as in the previously mentioned SB

coatings, BMI-phenolic formulations, and BOX-based systems, including applied BOX-BMI formulations, are pur-
posefully captured and quantitatively investigated for specific and functional industrial applications.
7.2
Phenolic-Isocyanate Coatings
Polyurethanes (abbreviated PURs or PUs) are typically products of isocyanate-polyol (including diols) reactions
with characteristic urethane linkages (−NH-CO-O−). Almost all of these commodity polyols, such as those derived
from modified polyesters and acrylics, are aliphatic and contain primary and secondary aliphatic OH groups that
are reactive with isocyanates but are weaker acids than aromatic Ph-OHs. PUR topcoats in conjunction with an
epoxy basecoat often exhibit both sufficient UV resistance and bonding strength; a zinc primer applied underneath
is widely accepted for utmost corrosion protection [44], for instance, conforming to ISO 12944 C3-C5 specifica-
tions. Within the scope of PUR technology, the aromatic Ph-OH sources as opposed to aliphatic OHs in this subsec-
tion are derived exclusively from BPA-based phenolic prepolymers (refer to Figure 7.1f) rather than from generic
phenol resoles or novolacs (refer to Figures 7.1g/h) and are aimed at fast-growing anti-graffiti markets that are
currently dominated by silicone and polyester PUR chemistries [45] due in part to their excellent UV resistance. It
should be noted that i) oxidizable (unsaturated) phenolic-based urethanes (OPUs) have been reported to improve
the performance of conventional SB systems, including shortened dry time, enhanced toughness, mar resistance,
high gloss, and improved chemical resistance [46]; ii) in hybrids of PF resins and MDI for wood applications,
acetone promotes curing of the co-polymerization systems [47]; and iii) phenolic-isocyanate (tri-functional HDI)
coatings modified by PDMS as a scratch resistant topcoat and similar modifications are reported to have a high
crosslinked modulus, fluorine-free self-cleaning and anti-smudge properties [48, 49], as illustrated in Figure 7.6
for the proposed reaction mechanisms.
In this topic module, active powder formulations are utilized to aid in addressing functional barrier applications
such as anti-graffiti coatings. Graffiti resistance demands a mix of high hardness and gloss, scratch and cleaner
chemical resistance, and exterior durability. In one aspect, for phenolic PURs, BPA-based phenolic resins with
aromatic −OH groups (rigid) are a more robust alternative to existing aliphatic OH (soft)-functional polyester pow-
der formulations for anti-graffiti applications. In another aspect, in stepwise polymerization, isocyanates (such as
MDI and TDI) and polyols (such as polyesters) contribute hard aromatic urethane and soft aliphatic segments,
delivering regulated hardness and elasticity to the cured film. Similarly, BPA-based phenolic resins and inter-
nally blocked IPDI dimers were combined to produce a thermosetting PUR with Ph-OH and urethane struc-
tures constituting the hardened portions. As a result, a set of five powder formulations was developed, including
KD-405 (EW-PhOH 250), KD-427 (EW-PhOH 380), KD-448 (EW-PhOH 700), PU0-KD448-Isocyanate (i.e., a 50-50
hybrid), and PU0-Isocyanate, a polyester PUR benchmark product formulated using Rucote 117 (EW-OH 510 g/eq)
and Crelan 403 EF (EW-NCO 310 g/eq) for graffiti-resistant applications, without stain-/mar-resistant additives.
KD-405, KD-427, and KD-448 (refer to Table 7.2) represent phenolic resins with increasing MWs and EW-PhOHs.
Other formulation design factors included: i) a fixed stoichiometric ratio of NCO to OH at 1.025, ii) being unfilled
but color tinted, iii) the incorporation of outgassing agents and flow modifiers, and iv) identical catalyzation
by DBTDL at 1.18 phr. Between an NCO-to-OH ratio of 1.050 and 1.025, batch-to-batch variations in finished
properties were found to be minimal.
To begin with, FTIR (Figure 7.7) confirmed the reaction advancement of each formulation where urethane
linkages developed during thermal cure, particularly at wavenumbers ∼3,379 (−NH−), 1,702∼1,717 (C=O), and
1,228∼1,242 cm−1 (N−C−O against N=C=O at 2,274 cm−1), respectively. Absorptions observed at 1,508 (C=C)
and 828 cm−1 (CH2=CH) are expectedly attributed to aromatic rings present in KD-448, KD-427, and KD-405
(refer to the inserted structure in Figure 7.7) but absent in PU0-Isocyanate. Signals detected at 1,101 (C−O−C)

and 728 cm−1 (aliphatic C−C chains) are fingerprints characteristic of PU0-Isocyanate. All these peaks were seen
for the PU0-KD48-Isocyanate hybrid.
In addition, DSC exothermic curves (Figure 7.8a) additionally validated the cure proceeding involving Ph-OHs
and isocyanates. All DSC profiles for these formulations are comparable to those of epoxy systems; thus, cure
kinetics are quantified (Table 7.3), including cure times predicted from subsequent ODEs and cure schedules
confirmed by cured film DSCs. PU0-Iso gelled in 17.3 sec at 204 ∘C (Table 7.4), the fastest among these batches,
but it required 7 min and 25 sec, a longer time to complete cure because its cure reaction rate slowed down after
Tpeak at 195.4 ∘C, as indicated by the highest reaction order n = 0.69 and the lowest extent of cure 𝛼= 69.5% at Tpeak.
As the MWs or EW-PhOHs of phenolic resins increased, so did the cure times, with KD-405 curing the quickest.
The total reaction order (m + n) for PU0-Iso was the highest at about 1.24, further away from a first-order reaction,
which is consistent with the fact that aliphatic OHs are less reactive than Ph-OHs. Aromatic phenolics apparently
facilitated a decrease in the total reaction order and Ea, hence expediting the cure kinetically. In short, phenolic
PURs can undergo full curing at either lower temperatures or in a shorter amount of time.
Third, the minimum dynamic viscosity (𝜂*min), the gel point, and the flow index were determined for each
formulation using DMA rheological measurements, as exemplified in Figure 7.8b for PU0-KD448-Iso. Among
all formulations, PU0-Iso exhibited the lowest 𝜂*min (12.0 Pa-s) and the highest flow index (21.3 1/Pa) and Tgel
(178.8 ∘C). Phenolic PURs turned out to reduce flow and Tgel as phenolic MWs increased. Increasing flow prior to
gelation enhances film formation and, often, adhesion. Taking into account 𝛼’s at 𝜂*min and the gel point, PU0-Iso

reached 𝜂*min at 𝛼= 7.7% and gelled at 𝛼= 25.6%. All phenolic PUR batches, however, were observed to gel well
before 𝜂*min. PU0-KD448-Iso (Figure 7.8b) appeared to gel into an immobilized network at 154.3 ∘C first, reach
𝜂*min at 164.4 ∘C next, and undergo substantial crosslinking until cure completion at around 220.9 ∘C, where G′
was at its maximum level. Rheological flow indices were highly consistent with pill flows (Table 7.4).
The physical properties of the uncured powders and cured films (Table 7.4) demonstrate that phenolic PURs
outperformed the polyester control (PU0-Iso) in terms of i) considerably higher Tgs, ii) enhanced hardness and
scratch resistance, and iii) a glossier finish. Tg increased with increasing phenolic resin MWs or EW-PhOHs,
conclusively proving that the aliphatic secondary-OH concurrently engaged in the crosslinking reaction, as Tg
normally decreases with increasing MWs. A greater Tg indicates a higher crosslinking density, hence enhancing
resistance to chemicals and solvents such as graffiti-removing solvents. In formulating polyester PURs, Tg can be
increased by incorporating a polyol with increased functionality (e.g., Polymac 3110: f = 10.4 and EW-OH 190).
However, this approach impairs flexibility, another desired feature. Polyesters are also structurally susceptible to

detrimental hydrolysis, which happens slowly at ambient temperature but tends to accelerate in the presence of
acids or bases. Lacking the ester linkage (−CO-O−), phenolic PURs are substantially less vulnerable to hydrolysis.
Data from nanoindentation (Table 7.4) indicate that the hardness (H) and elastic modulus (E′) decreased with
increasing phenolic resin MWs or EW-PhOHs. Flexibility and direct impact resistance were evaluated and found
to be comparable to the polyester control (PU0-Iso) at 12 mil DFT on steel panels.
Functional coatings almost invariably require hardness, elasticity, and toughness to provide scratch, abrasion,
and impact shock resistance, respectively. In addition to their elevated Tgs, the higher H and E′ of phenolic
PURs were ascribed to the initial resin MWs and the rigid benzene ring-containing structures. According
to micro-scratch data, PU0-Iso, at 1.27 μm, was the softest and least scratch-resistant material, whereas
PU0-KD448-Iso was intermediate between PU0-Iso and KD448-Iso. Slight data transformation reveals that H, E′,
and actual scratch resistance are inversely proportional to the functionality (f) of BPA-based phenolic resins. The
maximum storage modulus (G′
max) upon completion of curing was at 211–222 ∘C (Table 7.4), demonstrating that
phenolic PURs with higher MWs were more resistant to heat. The PU0-KD448-Iso hybrid was found to have the
highest G′
max up to 173.9 kPa. Clearly, PU0-KD448-Iso and PU0-Iso were more abrasion-resistant than KD448-Iso,
KD427-Iso, and KD405-Iso based on the Taber weight loss data (Figure 7.9). With increased phenolic resin MWs
or the addition of polyester resins to these batches, abrasion was improved. The ratios of H/E′ postulated to
describe abrasion resistance [50] were consistent with the small to substantial weight loss data in Figure 7.9.
Lower-MW phenolic resins (such as KD-405) would result in harder and more rigid films that are more resistant
to scratches but not necessarily abrasion. PU0-Iso turned out to be the least resistant to scratches, although it
withstood abrasion as much as or better than PU0-KD448-Iso, the hybrid.
The cured film integrity, including gloss, of phenolic PURs matched or exceeded that of the control, PU0-Iso.
PU0-KD448-Iso provided compatibility and synergistic interactions from a combination of aromatic- and
aliphatic-OH groups, thereby enhancing flow, gloss, hardness, modulus and abrasion, weatherability potential,
mitigating hydrolytic degradation, and, most importantly, accelerating cure and boosting Tg for improved chemi-
cal resistance, all of which were complementary to graffiti resistance. KD427-Iso, KD448-Iso, and PU0-KD448-Iso
were rated “1” according to anti-graffiti specifications for removing blue wax crayons, lipsticks, and black
water-based ink markers with a dry cotton cloth, comparable to PU0-Iso. The phenolic PURs were all rated “4
“(i.e., complete removal with isopropyl alcohol or IPA) for removing permanent blue markings versus PU0-Iso,
which was underrated “5” (i.e., complete removal with a more aggressive acetone solvent); all products, including
PU0-Iso, were preserved or resumed full gloss after cleaning. Surface paint cleansers may comprise vegetable oil
and isopropylamine alkylbenzene sulfonate-based emulsifiers [51] (refer to Debrief D in Chapter 8). Scale-up
performance should be further improved by incorporating stain-resistant additives and other stabilizers into
an optimum formulation. Apparently, phenolic-isocyanate formulations are equally applicable to resoles and
novolacs, but probably in liquid form.

Phenolic-BMI Systems
The structure-property relationship and chemistry of BMIs, such as Compimide MAHD (Figure 7.4f, Evonik) and
MIR-3000 (combining maleimide and biphenyl functions, Figure 7.4g, Nippon Kayaku), which are representative
of BMI’s difunctional symmetry consisting of hetero-N-5-membered rings, should be thoroughly understood first.
The cyclic vinyl (or C=C) functional groups of BMIs are similar to those of aliphatic acrylates and derivatives, but
they are more reactive (i.e., more electron deficient due to ring strains) toward self-crosslinking polyaddition in
free-radical, carbon-carbon Michael Addition (with primary and secondary amines), and thiol-Michael Addition
reactions. In specific, as depicted in Figure 7.10a, vinyl groups in maleimides are the most reactive, followed in
decreasing order by vinyl sulfones, acrylates, acrylamides, and methacrylates (the least of the five listed). On the
one hand, it is revealed that BMIs and vinyl sulfones are most likely more effective cure accelerators than acrylates
in, for example, 2K epoxy-amine systems (refer to Ancarez 2364 in Table 6.2 of Chapter 6), albeit subject to valida-
tion that depends on formulation and compatibility. On the other hand, DMAA (i.e., N, N-dimethyl acrylamide, KJ
Chemicals) is likely a better alternative than methacrylates as a coating additive for promoting adhesion and the
cure speed of similar epoxy-amine coatings. As depicted in Figure 7.10b, a patent has been applied for heat-curable
biscitraconimides with BMI-like structures [52].
As anticipated, Compimide MAHD, a bifunctional BMI, underwent vinyl homo-polymerization, as confirmed
by DSC thermograms of its underlying samples (Figure 7.11a) and speed mixer-prepared samples if a catalyst was
introduced (Figure 7.11b). In the absence of catalysts and at a heating rate of 7.0 ∘C/min (the initial scan and the
blue curve in Figure 7.11a), this BMI monomer or resin first absorbed heat up to 146.2 J/g to melt at 137.0 ∘C,
then vinyl self-crosslinking began at approximately 200 ∘C throughout Tonset at 223.1 ∘C and Tpeak at 252.2 ∘C prior
to reaching full cure at approximately 350 ∘C. Its cure kinetic pathway corresponded to an ODE of d𝛼
dt = 25000 ⋅
e
−64300
R⋅T
⋅𝛼0.61 ⋅(1 −𝛼)1.54 according to the DCS approach discussed in Chapter 5. Therefore, it was estimated that it
would take at least 20.8 and 68.5 min at 232 ∘C to obtain 90% and 99% cure levels, respectively, unless a very high
cure temperature, such as 350 ∘C, is used to achieve full cure (i.e., 𝛼= 99.9%) in still 12.88 min. The homo-cured
Tg was determined to be 173.7 ∘C after the cured-in-machine BMI sample was re-scanned at 20.0 ∘C/min (i.e., the
second red curve in Figure 7.11a). Please note that the Cp crossover zone around the Tg on the red curve is hardly
discernible, similar to that of polyimide (PI), polyethylene (PE), and polypropylene (PP) thermoplastics but unlike
that of thermosetting epoxies, indicating the thermoplastic properties of the self-crosslinked BMI.
In the presence of a cationic catalyst, such as ETPPI or Cyphos IL 169 at 6.60 phr, the cure schedule was sub-
stantially accelerated, as evidenced by Tpeak, Tonset, and even 𝛥H values (Figure 7.11b). Cyphos IL 169 turned
out to be much more effective than ETPPI at lowering the Tpeak, that is, from as high as 273.7 ∘C without a cat-
alyst to as low as 174.9 ∘C with Cyphos IL 169 contrasted to 241.6 ∘C with ETPPI at the same loading level, all
performed at 20 ∘C/min. Importantly, it was revealed that BMI self-crosslinking is indeed cationic-ally catalyzed

or alternatively catalyzed by organometallic complexes (from the succeeding experiments in Table 7.5). Notably,
BMI homo-polymerization was associated with extremely high exotherms above −300 J/g, regardless of the pres-
ence or absence of catalysts. An elevated exotherm (𝛥H) is one of two essential conditions that promote frontal
polymerization [54]; the other is a low-energy threshold (in terms of Ea) for crosslinking to take place.
Compimide MAHD BMI along with KD-448 (a solid BPA-based phenolic resin), GP-2074 (a solid novolac PF
resin), Bakelite 6535 (a liquid resole at 64.2% butylated solids), and GP BKR-2620 (a solid resole PF resin) were
subsequently used to study co-polymerization between BMI and phenolics, as detailed in Table 7.5, including
their labeling (i.e., BPA-#01, Novolac-#02, Resole A-#03, and Resole B-#04, respectively). Note that bathes #02
and #03 were homogenized with a speed mixer at a 1-to-1 BMI-to-phenolic molar ratio, devoid of any catalysts
or other ingredients, before sampling for DSC analysis (Figures 7.12b/c). Please also note that Bakelite 6535 was
purged of its solvent by a two-hour stay at 120 ∘C before sampling; a straight sample did not cure according to
DSC non-exothermic detection (similar to what was observed in Figure 7.12a). Separately, #01 and #04 were fully
formulated and executed according to powder coating manufacturing protocols, such as premixing, extrusion, and
chip grinding (refer to Figure 4.3 in Chapter 4), prior to full thermal and physical characterization on uncured
powders for gel times, pill flows, and DSC (Figures 7.12a/d) and on coated and cured steel panels for flexibility,
impact, and others (Table 7.5).
No gel or cure (i.e., crosslinking reactions) was detected for the BPA-#01 formulation, that is, BMI and KD-448,
a BPA-based phenolic resin with purely para-substituted structures, utilizing anionic DMAP or organometallic
ZnAcAc as the catalyst, as confirmed by the absence of DSC exotherms (Figure 7.12a). This piece of technical data
suggests that the etherification reaction pathway between BMI’s vinyls and BPA-derived phenolic’s Ph-OHs does
not occur or occurs rather minimally. In the meantime, it is inferred that the role of ortho-substitution played
by phenolics is supposedly indispensable to cure reaction advancements of BMI’s vinyls and phenolic’s Ph-OHs
in formulations. In contrast, both novolacs and resoles successfully crosslinked BMIs, as explicitly exhibited by
the robust DSC exotherms in Figures 7.12b/c/d. This constitutes direct evidence of ortho-substitution’s role in
proceeding Diels−Alder hetero-O-6-membered cycling reactions leading to the formation of chroman rings (refer
to Figure 7.5a for an analogous pathway). Note that the endotherms in Figures 7.12b/c/d (i.e., the first peaks on the
blue curves) were caused by the melting of the coating mixtures, each of which absorbed a considerable amount
of heat. By comparing the shapes and slopes of the exothermic curves in Figures 7.12b/c/d, corresponding to
novolac GP-2074, resole Bakelite 6535, and resole GP-2620, respectively, it is clear that cure reactions are phenolic

resin-specific, following their own individual pattern and varying remarkably in terms of enthalpy (i.e., heat of
the overall crosslinking reactions), Tpeak, Tonset, and the final Tg. For example, at otherwise identical formulation
conditions, the Novolac-#02 without catalyzation ended up having the highest Tg at 181.4 ∘C, followed by the
liquid Resole A-#03 (also without a catalyst) at 165.6 ∘C, and the least for the solid Resole B-#04 catalyzed by
ZnAcAc; however, its Tg still remained at up to 143.5 ∘C.
Particularly, the exothermic shape and pattern of Bakelite 6535 (#03) and GP-2620 (#04) were completely dis-
similar, indicating that the crosslinking mechanisms involved were significantly dependent on catalyzation and
on the resole phenolic grade. Resole B-#04 was fully cured at 232 ∘C in 20 min, leading to superior adhesion and
dielectric strength (i.e., up to 2.07 kV/mil) as measured at 4–6 mil DFT on steel substrates, as well as adequate
flexibility and impact resistance (Table 7.5). Cure reactions of properly catalyzed BMI-phenolic systems involve
primarily Diels−Alder ring-forming co-polymerization and secondarily BMI homo-polymerization, which sug-
gests that an applicable formulation index of BMI-to-phenolic in mole is preferably greater than one, or BMI in
excess, subject to optimization for developing high-performance coating products for intended applications.

BOXs and BOX-Isocyanate Coatings
Some industrial applications, such as downhole inner diameter (ID) drill pipe linings in the oil and gas industry,
demand high Tg values exceeding the service temperature (which can reach 204 ∘C or higher depending on the
drilling depths), strong adhesion, moisture and chemical resistance, and toughness to withstand high temperature
and high pressure (HTHP) environments below the earth’s surface. Frequently, OD pipeline coatings in specific
regions, such as Saudi Arabia, require Tg values above 200 ∘C as well. This subsection demonstrates that ben-
zoxazines (BOXs), considered as an avant-garde phenolic resin, are viable coating options for high heat-resistant
challenges requiring the aforementioned structural performance when properly formulated for curability (accept-
able cure temperatures) and processibility (anti-sagging viscosity). Fusion bonded epoxies (FBEs) formulated with
generic amine or BPA-based phenolic crosslinkers are currently the leading protective coatings for applications
such as pipeline, rebar, and valve. BOXs could supplement the FBE formulation toolset by expanding their util-
ity under more punishing environments. As a first step prior to formulation, DSC analysis was performed on
P-d, a BOX grade of 100% solids (EW 213-215; refer to Figure 7.4e) supplied by Shikoku Chemicals, and Lapox
ARBZ-10 (EW 215-230) supplied by Atul of India. P-d and Lapox ARBZ-10, representative of BOXs, thermally

self-polymerized to produce an extremely high exotherm of –306.6 J/g and a Tg of up to 186.8 ∘C (i.e., BX2 in
Figure 7.13a), similar to BMIs (refer to Figure 7.11a). As with the vast majority of epoxy thermosets, the self-curing
path of BOXs was closely followed the applied autocatalytic model (refer to Equation 11 in Table 5.3 of Chapter 5).
Kinetic parameters according to the exothermic curve conducted at 7.0 ∘C/min (BX2 in Figure 7.13a) were thus
estimated as the reaction orders of 0.96 for m and 1.42 for n, as well as the activation energy of 55.55 kJ/mol for
Ea, a high value comparable to some uncatalyzed epoxy formulations. A narrow cure window between roughly
215 and 265 ∘C reveals that P-d remained highly latent until the cure temperature (Tcure) surpassed ∼215 ∘C, after
which homo-cures proceeded rapidly until gelation at 233.9 ∘C (Figure 7.13b and Table 7.6); the cure rate peaked
at approximately 234.6 ∘C immediately after gelation, and full cure was achieved at ∼273 ∘C.
The majority of P-d (i.e., BX2) self-curing at 7.0 ∘C/min, accounting for ∼84.4% of the total exotherm, took place
between 𝜂*min at 226.3 ∘C and 𝜂*max at 244.3 ∘C within 2.6 min surrounding gelation at 233.9 ∘C (Figures 7.13a/b).
P-d melted at ∼80 ∘C, resulting in a massive flow and a constant viscosity (𝜂*) below ∼10 Pa-s until 226.3 ∘C. The
flow window between ∼80 and 233.9 ∘C was expansive, resulting in a high substrate-wetting adhesion potential.
Dynamic viscosity (𝜂*) experienced a sharp increase starting at 𝜂*min and continuing throughout 𝜂*max, indicating
rapid curing upon thermal initiation. At 226.3 ∘C, P-d was already ∼8.60% cured kinetically; hence, it is misleading
to assume that this exact 𝜂*min turning point (Figure 7.13b) represents the actual cure or gel onset. Viscous and
elastic components (G′′ and G′) co-dominated until the gel point, after which elasticity started to dominate, as G′

> G′′. Gelation of P-d happened at 𝛼= 50.2% after 𝜂*min and prior to Tpeak at 234.6 ∘C and 𝛼= 55.2%. 𝜂*max emerged
at 244.3 ∘C and 𝛼= 93.0%, which corresponds to an in-situ G′
max of ∼2.08 MPa.
These distinctive kinetic and rheological traits observed for P-d BOX homo-cures prescribed that the formulation
must overcome a couple of inherent difficulties for robust performance. One challenge was a water-like viscosity
(𝜂*) prior to gelation that resulted in a flow index of 206.4 1/Pa and a pill flow of over 200 mm (BX2 in Table 7.6)
that, if not addressed, would have resulted in severe sagging when applied. Incorporation of flow control agents
(such as Aerosil R 972) and fillers assisted in effectively managing the flow issue. At 25.6% filler loading, the
flow index and pill flow were lowered to ∼46.0 1/Pa and ∼90 mm (BX4 and BX6), respectively, leading to fully
processible and sag-free compositions without loss of adhesion.
Another concern was the elevated Tcure necessary for the P-d BOX, which was greater than 240 and preferably
260 ∘C for full cure. Clearly, decreasing Tcure and cure times would boost the commercial applicability of BOX
systems dramatically. As implemented, mixing P-d with epoxy and phenolic resins at a stoichiometric ratio of 10:
6: 2 effectively decreased the cure time at 232 ∘C from 19.4 to 13.1 min (BX2 and BX4 in Figure 7.13a and Table 7.6).
However, doing so resulted in a significant decrease in Tg from 186.8 to 114.2 ∘C, indicating a substantial dilution
in crosslinking density in the BX4 formulation where a BOX-epoxy copolymer was supposedly created in place
of PBZ alone. Combining P-d with only an epoxy resin was ineffective, although maintaining a physically high
Tg with BPA-based or novolac-based epoxies performed similarly. As a kinetic consequence of the reaction orders
decreasing from 0.96 to 0.78 for m and from 1.42 to 1.05 for n, BX4 exhibited remarkably faster cure responses.
Catalysts were also investigated to facilitate P-d’s cure conditions. Common tertiary amines, imidazoles, and imi-
dazole adducts, such as 2MI, DMAP, which are all effective accelerators for epoxies, were surprisingly ineffective
for P-d formulations, irrespective of their loading amounts or combinations. Other BOX grades exhibited a simi-
lar response, indicating that basic or anionic materials are not suitable catalysts for BOX ring-opening reactions,
similar to BMI. Instead, it was determined that un-blocked p-TSA, a strong organic acid, was effective as long as a
phenolic resin was present (BX6 in Figure 7.13 and Table 7.6), allowing the cure time at 232 ∘C to further decrease
to 11.8 min. Figure 7.13a compares the overlapping DSC exothermic curves of BX2, BX4, and BX6; p-TSA worked
by further driving the reaction orders down to 0.53 for m and 0.89 for n, while increasing Ea to 62.35 kJ/mol. The
incorporation of catalytic p-TSA had minimal effects on mechanical toughness, flexibility, and Tg, if any. In fact,
p-TSA was most effective in BOX-phenolic systems devoid of epoxy resins, reducing cure temperatures or times
while retaining a high Tg but decreasing the toughness to a level on par with that of conventional epoxy systems
(e.g., ≤40 impact). The optimal loading level of p-TSA was estimated to be 1.21 phr. Thiodipehnol (TDP) appears to
be a good choice for BOX self-curing accelerators, as reported in [55]. Other organic Bronsted acids such as dodecyl
benzenesulfonic acid or Lewis acids such as FeCl3 and several others (electrophilic or e−acceptors), either blocked
or un-blocked with higher reactive temperatures, should be suitable catalysts for BOXs [56, 57].
P-d BOX self-curing (i.e., BX2) and BOX-epoxy co-polymerization (i.e., BX4) were supported by FTIR spectra.
For example, a strong and broad absorption appearing at ∼3,630 cm−1 correlates to OH and H-bonding from the
PBZ matrix in BX2. The spectrum of the uncured BX4 was nearly identical to that of conventional epoxy-phenolic
formulations, exhibiting an intense and sharp fingerprint signal at ∼1,139 cm−1, which is characteristic of ethers
(−O−). This absorption, however, disappeared in cured film samples of BX4 and epoxy-phenolic systems. In addi-
tion, the OH-related signal for the cured BX4 film became too weak to detect, inferring that phenol OHs from both
the original phenolics and the resultant PBZ had been depleted.
BX4 and BX6 sprayed and cured on blasted steel panels demonstrated remarkable impact resistance, greater
than 100 up to 160 lb-in at 12–14 mils. Water uptake upon hot water soak for 28 days at 75 and 95 ∘C was averaged
at 0.31 and 0.90 g, whereas the water uptake of generic FBEs with a similar Tg ranges typically from 0.5−1.0 to
1.5−2.5 g. The direct-to-steel single coat application of BX4 passed autoclave testing at 177 ∘C and 3,500 psi for 24
hours without blisters, delamination, or other defects, in contrast to current FBE systems that still require a liquid
primer to achieve similar high temperature and high pressure (HTHP) performance, suggesting that i) high Tg are
not necessarily a prerequisite for some challenging HTHP applications such as downhole drill pipes, and ii) fusion

bonded benzoxazines, when innovatively formulated with an epoxy and a phenolic as a direct-to-metal basecoat,
can provide superior structural adhesion for uptrending applications, including ISO 12944 C5, without the need
for a primer.
Undoubtably, it is of interest to determine whether isocyanate-cured BOXs (i.e., BOX-PUR) can offer a functional
coating platform with a universal catalyst and a joint cure schedule. Theoretically, a compatible accelerator in such
one-pot formulations would promote not only BOX ring-opening but also reactions between isocyanates and the
newly produced Ph-OH groups. In other words, an appropriate and effective catalyst must bridge the Tcure gap
between temperatures exceeding 240 ∘C for BOXs and temperatures below ∼200 ∘C for isocyanates. Specifically,
in a co-curing process, such a catalyst would prevent isocyanates from being prematurely reacted or evaporated
prior to the presence of a PBZ complex that supplies Ph-OHs.
The previously described BX6 was modified to BS61 by fully substituted the epoxy resin with Crelan 403 EF
(EW-NCO 310, or NCO content 13.5%, Tm 70–78 ∘C, unblock 170–180 ∘C), an internally blocked aliphatic IPDI,
at an identical molar level and ratio. These additional experiments were carried out in an effort to unleash the
potential of BOXs. Note that 𝜀-caprolactam-blocked IPDI such as Vestagon® B1400 (EW-NCO 310, Tm 75–100 ∘C,
unblock at 160 ∘C) and B1530 (EW-NCO 275, Tm 62–80 ∘C, unblock > 170 ∘C) tend to smoke during oven cure.
The p-TSA catalyst and its loading level of 1.22 phr stayed the same, as did the phenolic resin (i.e., KD-405).
In addition, two parallel formulations were implemented in which p-TSA was replaced by DBTDL (e.g., Estron
Chemical’s Butaflow BT71) in BS62 and by ZnAcAc in BS63, respectively. BS63 with ZnAcAc as the loaded catalyst
turned out to be a more viable formulation, offering a tough coating with an impact resistance of up to 160 lb-in
and a Tg as high as 152.7 ∘C (Table 7.7 and inserts in Figure 7.14a) upon cure at 239 ∘C for 10–12 min. Given
how difficult it is to formulate tough coatings with a high Tg, these qualities are outstanding. The following were
specific observations: i) ZnAcAc narrowed down the Tcure gap between the two otherwise disengaged reactions,
as proved by the fact that the isocyanate-OH exothermic Tpeak at 191.0 and the P-d BOX Tpeak at 237.8 ∘C stay
partially overlapped (Figure 7.14a); ii) ZnAcAc resulted in reasonable and valid gel times, kinetic parameters, and
cure schedules (Table 7.7); and iii) BS63 produced a bulk coating film with excellent adhesion, toughness, fair
flexibility, and defect-free integrity.
In contrast, BS61 catalyzed by p-TSA proved ineffective, lacking even a gel point at 204 ∘C; its singular DSC
exotherm peaked at 239.7 ∘C (Figure 7.14a). This demonstrates that only BOX self-crosslinking has been identified.
BS62 catalyzed by DBTDL exhibited two distinctive exotherms, with peaks at 185.8 and distantly 250.7 ∘C, corre-
sponding to isocyanate-phenolic and BOX self-curing domains, respectively. DBTDL appears to be more effective
at accelerating the curing of isocyanates, while p-TSA is better suited for BOXs. If accessible, blocked isocyanates
with higher de-blocking temperatures, such as Daiichi Kogyo Seiyaku’s Elastron BN-27, which has a de-blocking
temperature of 180 ∘C and preferably over 200 ∘C, would substantially promote the development of more robust
BOX-PUR formulations.

Focusing on formulation feasibility, curing characteristics, and cured film properties, technical efforts were
naturally extended to BOX-bismaleimide (BMI) to direct the development of a novel applied coating system. BMI
uniquely offers a few potential curing mechanisms, including hetero-Diels−Alder cyclization [58], etherification
via nucleophilic substitution [59], with, for example, Ph-OHs, and free-radical-driven vinyl self-polymerization
(refer to Figure 7.11a). Overall, such co-polymerization (Figures 7.15a/b) and homo-cures lead to the formation
of highly crosslinked networks within the resulting polymeric matrixes. Compimide MAHD is a difunctional
BMI monomer or resin (refer to Figure 7.4f) with an aliphatic chain that imparts flexibility. BM64 was modified
from BS63 by substituting Crelan 403 EF IPDI resin with MAHD at an identical molar amount and ratio,
while ZnAcAc at 1.22 phr was unchanged. BM65 was formulated by adjusting the total stoichiometric ratio of

Ph-OH versus vinyl to be close to 1: 1; that is to say, the molar P-d to MAHD to KD-405 ratio for BM65 was
10: ∼11.2: 2, as opposed to 10: 6: 2 for BM64, with formulations specified in Table 7.8. The consequential coating
vehicles of BM64 and BM65 performed unexpectedly well in terms of i) application exhibiting exceptional
adhesion and edge coverage at thin film thickness, and ii) cure cycles reduced to 5.0 min at 239 ∘C while pre-
serving a high Tg up to 171.8 ∘C. Specifically, Tpeak/Tonset from DSC conducted at 7.0 ∘C/min for BM64 and BM65
were 212.0/192.4 ∘C and 214.5/195.5 ∘C, respectively (Figure 7.14b). These values were significantly lower than
239.1/204.8 ∘C for BX6 (refer to Figure 7.13a). Ea, as estimated kinetically to be 57.4 kJ/mol for both BM64 and
BM65, was unaffected by the increased MAHD loading and was once again drastically lower than 62.35 kJ/mol
for BX6. BOX-BMI systems appeared to cure much faster under ZnAcAc catalysis than fusion-bonded BOXs
under p-TSA catalysis. Notably, when the loading level of ZnAcAc was increased from 8.75 to 17.50 pbw in BM64,
everything thermally (e.g., Tpeak, Tonset, Tg, etc.) remained almost unchanged except that i) the gel times at 350 ∘F
and 400 ∘F reduced by nearly half accordingly, and ii) kinetic parameters trended toward shorter cure times (see
the data highlighted in blue color in Table 7.8).
According to thermal data (Figure 7.14b), the heating rate considerably affected the BOX-BMI cure reaction
enthalpy and crosslinking density. When BMI was deficient, that is, at a molar ratio of 10: 6: 2, a faster heating
rate of 20 ∘C/min produced a higher cure heat of −234.2 J/g and a Tg of 171.8 ∘C versus −222.8 J/g and 154.4 ∘C
at a slower heating rate of 7.0 ∘C/min. These data may indicate a cure kinetic deviation connected with a set of
competing processes that diverge cure reactions based on the in-situ cure temperature applied. In addition to BMI’s
vinyl homo-polymerization, competing reactions include those depicted in Figures 7.15a/b: a hetero-Diels−Alder
reaction to form a chroman ring, and Ph-OHs generated from BOX homo-cures undergoing etherification with
BMI [60]. Mannich base bridges of ring-opened BOXs are structurally similar to ortho-substitutions of −CH2-O−
in resole phenolics, facilitating 6-membered heterocyclic cure via BMIs [24, 61]. As determined experimentally,
a slow curing process, that is, increasing the cure time at a given cure temperature, was preferred for BOX-BMI
systems; otherwise, incomplete curing occurred.
By FTIR, cyclic ether (C−O−C) linkages (Figure 7.15a) cannot be distinguished from non-cyclic ether linkages
(Figure 7.15b), as both exhibit absorption peaks at around 1,139 cm−1. LC/MS results from an analogous small
molecule model reaction simulating resole phenolics and cyclic-vinyl-containing Nadic esters (refer to Figure 7.5a)
were very consistent with the Diels−Alder path (Figure 7.15a), showing the significant presence of a chroman
ring-specific ion at m/z 513.3. In addition, formulations comprised of MAHD and purely para-structured KD-405,
KD-427, or KD-448 in the absence of P-d failed to cure regardless of catalysts, Tcure, or cure times employed, implic-
itly demonstrating the need of ortho-substitutions in a chroman ring route. In the meantime, DSC exothermic
data (i.e., 𝛥H −302.6 J/g, Tpeak 252.2 ∘C, Tonset 223.1 ∘C, and Tg 173.7 ∘C) conclusively confirmed the occurrence of
BMI’s vinyl self-crosslinking at elevated temperatures over 250 ∘C (refer to Figure 7.11a). However, confirmation
or exclusion of etherification as one of the complex cure mechanisms for BOX-BMI systems is not yet available.
From formulation perspectives, KD-405 (or equivalently DEH 85) is a BPA-based phenolic resin that is
unreactive with BMIs; however, it facilitates BOX ring-opening reactions that generate fresh ortho-substituted
Ph-OHs that readily react with the vinyl of BMIs. This was not understood until a thorough data analysis was

conducted. In fact, BM64 (Table 7.8) was originally formulated with a ratio of BOX’s reactive Ph-OHs to BMI’s
vinyl to KD-405’s unreactive Ph-OHs of 10: 6: 2, which corresponds to a total stoichiometric Ph-OH to C=C ratio
of 2: 1. In other words, vinyl from MAHD BMI was in short supply in MB64 due to the fact that only BOX-driven
Ph-OH functional groups were consumed by reacting with vinyl for crosslinking contribution. In contrast, BM65
(Table 7.8) was originally formulated with an overall molar ratio of Ph-OH to C=C of approximately 1: 1, equating
to a particular component ratio of 10: ∼11.2: 2 (i.e., BOX’s reactive Ph-OHs to BMI’s vinyl to KD-405’s inert
Ph-OHs), indicating excessive supply of BMIs in the formulation. As a result, and essentially, BM64 represents

302
7 Phenolic Coatings
a vinyl deficit, but BM65 represents a vinyl surplus. BM64 cured on steel panels at 232 ∘C for 7.5 min was found
to be slightly under cured with a residue exotherm of −5.2 J/g detected by DSC on its cured film samples; a
cure schedule of 239 ∘C (462 ∘F) for 10 min was therefore determined to cure BM64 sufficiently and optimally in
practical applications.
In addition, the physical and kinetic properties of these formulations are listed in Table 7.8. Specifically, hot
plate gel and pill tests revealed that gelation at 204 ∘C occurred in 153 sec for BM64 and 127 sec for BM65, with
both exhibiting massive flow (> 140 mm) and adhesion. The observed flexibility was 1.17∘/PD or less, which is
low but not necessarily unreasonable given the filler loading level of 25.1% and the elevated Tg of 165.6–169.1 ∘C.
Please note that these Tg data were for bulkily cured films sampled from coated panels, which represent achievable
values, as opposed to those from DSC cured-in-machine using very small amounts of uncured coating specimens
(Table 7.8); variations between application cured and DSC cured can be somewhat inconsistent when the curing
chemistry is complicated. Figure 7.16 depicts the complete thermal characterization of the uncured BM64 powder
coating using DSC and DMA. This BOX-BMI formulation exhibited rheo-kinetic characteristics similar to those of
BOX-epoxy systems (such as a needle-shaped exothermic curve indicating a narrow cure window and a viscosity
hike in the vicinity of gelation indicating a rapid transition from a viscoelastic liquid to a viscoelastic solid), but
with a significantly more manageable viscosity prior to gelation. Specifically, the coating started to melt starting
from ∼75 ∘C to 110 ∘C with continued viscosity dilution (under heat) and remained at 𝜂*min = 3.52 Pa-s from 154.7
to 179.5 ∘C (Figure 7.16b), corresponding to 𝛼from 0.03% to ∼1.4%, whereas the cure onset was close to 149.0 ∘C,
corresponding to 𝛼≈0.01%. Next, 𝜂* and the storage modulus (G′) ramped up rapidly throughout gelation, which
occurred between 202.9 and 207.4 ∘C (corresponding to steep increases of G′ and 𝛼from 147.9 Pa-s and 29.8% to
14,356.2 Pa-s and 45.8%, respectively) as a crossover zone of G′ and G′′ prior to Tpeak = 212.0 ∘C, which corresponds
to 𝛼= ∼64.25%. BOX ring-opening and BOX-BMI ring-forming reactions presumably occurred simultaneously
during this time period. Beyond Tpeak, curing continued at a fast rate but slowed until full cure happened at around
250 ∘C, equivalent to G′
max at ∼1.89 MPa and 𝛼= 99.99%, resulting in a high modulus, concrete-like, tough coating
with a smooth, semi-glossy finish (55.2% at 60∘).
Regarding the mechanical properties of cured films on steel panels, BM64 and BM65 formulations exhibited
exceptional wet and dry adhesion (as assessed by HWA and Patti pull tests, respectively) at thin film thicknesses
of 2–3 mils, perhaps outperforming fluorene and BMI-phenolic systems. Three-phase autoclave (177.0 ∘C,
3,500 psi, and 24 hours) and HWA water uptake results clearly proved the coating’s outstanding adhesion and
impermeability under heat. Increasing BMI loading moderately increased Tg from 154.4 for BM64 to 163.3 ∘C for

BM65 (Figure 7.14b); balancing the molar ratio of Ph-OH to vinyl in the formulations did not impact adhesion,
but it did impair compatibility and moisture barrier performance with respect to water uptake (Table 7.8).
In conclusion, BOX-BMI formulations, particularly BM64 with under-loaded or deficient BMIs, tend to offer
unrivaled impermeability of cured films, which is desired for HTHP and ISO 12944 C5 primer-less basecoat
applications.
Historical and statistical impermeability data of as many functional powder coating platforms as possible are
compiled in Table 7.9, where water uptake is all uniformly measured in g/m2 of cured films encapsulated on
steel panels out of HWA immersion at 75 ∘C and 95 ∘C after 28 days, respectively, and the enclosed image rep-
resents BM64 (i.e., a BOX to BMI ratio of 2: 1 or BMIs in deficit) after 28 days of HWA testing. Standard FBEs
(fusion bonded epoxies) are the generic ones formulated with commodity epoxies and cured by amines (such as
DICY) or BPA-based phenolics (such as KD-405); phenolic-cured FBEs are typically roughly twice as resistant to
moisture as amine-cured FBEs. DCPD-modified refers to epoxy resins containing hydrophobic dicyclopentadiene
modifications, such as Mitsubishi Chemical’s XD-1000 (EEW 245-260) and DIC’s Epiclon HP-7200H (EEW 275),
which considerably improve the moisture barrier performance. In terms of impermeability, FBEs based on fluo-
rene monomers, such as OGSOL PG-100 and CG-500, are currently the second best. Evidently, BOX-BMI coatings,
if properly formulated like BM64, are capable of supreme moisture resistance or small molecule impermeability,
that is, amazingly zero water uptake at 75 ∘C and merely 1.51 g/m2 at 95 ∘C after 28 days of HWA immersion,
which is at least 50 times better than standard FBEs. BOX-BMI systems are arguably the most promising thus far
for high-end high-performance interior barrier applications, such as upstream HTHP drill pipe, middle stream
steel pipe transit of hydrogen fuels at, for example, 3,000 psi, and downstream steel tank storage of hydrogen fuels
at, for example, 10,000 psi. In addition, abrasion and blasting tests using black diamond 30/60 grits demonstrated
that BM64 (Tg 154.4 ∘C) and an upgraded FBE (Tg 125.0 ∘C) required 35 and 75 sec, respectively, to remove the
23-mil cured films on profiled steel substrates, proving that BM64 is more than twice tougher than or twice as
resistant to such an erosion as standard FBEs. Please note that BOX and BMI both have color issues, making them
unsuitable for outdoor applications; for example, BM64 and BM65 were originally formulated in a green color, but
after curing, they turned dark brown (refer to the inserted picture in Table 7.9).
Lastly, the BOX-oriented coatings described in this subsection were all produced on a powder coating plat-
form (viewing them as solvent-free reactive hotmelts), although they may be simply reformulated as solvent-based
substitutions.
7.6
Quantiﬁcation of Ph-OHs by UV/Visible
Phenyl hydroxyls (Ph-OHs) are the core concept and function imparting reactivity in all phenolic resins, covering
a vast array of important industrial materials and bioproducts for a variety of industrial liquid and powder appli-
cations (refer to Table 7.2). In one aspect, Ph-OHs readily react with epoxies to produce flexible ether linkages;
in another aspect, similarly to aliphatic primary and secondary hydroxyls, Ph-OHs polymerize with isocyanates,
silanes (condensation), melamine, and derivatives (refer to Chapter 8 of microencapsulation), among others, in
the absence or presence of catalysts.
The content of functional Ph-OHs and the contingent EW-PhOHs are critical quality control (QC) criteria for
phenolic resins and coating formulation design. Specifically, the Ph-OH equivalent weight (EW) and functionality
(f) of phenolic resins are of applied significance in support of the incoming resin QC, iterative formulation pro-
posals, and the outcoming structural performance for specific end-use applications. According to a review of open
resources, there are no established methods for straightforward quantification of the Ph-OH concentration of phe-
nolic resins, although ASTM titrations, NMR, and UV/visible are principally implementable techniques. Several
analytical protocols have been developed to characterize amorphous lignin-associated Ph-OH groups [62–65];
however, they are neither readily applicable nor valid for phenolic resins. Due to the fact that phenols absorb
strongly in the UV region, a simple and effective UV/visible technique has been developed to accurately measure

Ph-OH contents in solid BPA-based phenolic resins, using the BPA monomer as a model reference compound
for calibration and tetra butyl ammonium hydroxide (TBAH) as a co-solvent. As a result, EW-PhOHs and the
functionality of uncompounded 100% solid phenolic resins can be recouped arithmetically. As compared system-
atically, the UV/visible technique that will be described hereunder is as robust as or outperforms an established
1H-NMR approach or existing titration methods for straight, unformulated resins. The progressive protocol is also
applicable to competitive analysis and reverse engineering of formulated coating products containing, for example,
BPA-derived phenolic resins, exhibiting qualitative and quantitative advantages over 1H-NMR in real-world cir-
cumstances involving extremely low phenolic resin crosslinker concentrations.
From a materials perspective, the following chemicals, products, and sources were utilized in this development
work: i) TBAH (MW 259.48 g/mol) of a 10% aqueous solution was from TCI America; ii) BPA (MW 228.29 g/mol,
EW-OH 114.15 g/eq) and Bisphenol-F (BPF) certified reference standards were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich;
iii) HPLC-grade tetrahydrofuran (THF) and ACS-grade methanol (MeOH, > 99.8%) as solvents were purchased
from Honeywell and Sigma-Aldrich, respectively; iv) BPA-based phenolic resin samples of three MW or EW-PhOH
levels each (Table 7.10) were from two separate vendors, Olin and Kukdo Chemical; and v) two commercial FBE
powder coatings, namely, IF194M with known formulation compositions and SK-206N with unknown formula-
tion, were sourced from the open market.
From a methodological perspective, the following should be noted: i) MWs and MWD of the six (6) resin
samples were analyzed by GPC/SEC (gel permeation chromatography/size-exclusion chromatography) utilizing a

solutions at 2 mg/ml (0.25 μm PTFE, Millipore) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, from which the MW averages (Mn and
Mw) and polydispersity (Pd) were then calculated against the calibration by analyzing the standards (Table 7.11
and Figure 7.17); ii) the hydroxyl content of one contingently selected resin sample was also determined by
acetic anhydride based solvent titration in accordance with a modified protocol of ASTM D1957-63, E222-65T,
and D1683 (Table 7.12); iii) the total hydroxyl number consisting of hydroxyl and acid values, both reported as
mg-KOH/g-sample, were aqueously and potentiometric-ally titrated with TBAH, on three selected resin samples,
respectively, in accordance with ASTM E1899-08 and D4662-93 (Table 7.12); and iv) NMR (nuclear magnetic
resonance) was performed on each of the six solid resins and the two powder coating samples by dissolving them
in DMSO (without filtration) prior to analysis, from which 1H (and 13C, if necessary)-NMR spectral data were
acquired and qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed (refer to Table 7.15).
Still, from a methodological perspective, UV/visible spectra were acquired for each of these eight resin and
coating samples using a PerkinElmer Lambda 950 UV/Vis/NIR Spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating
sphere detector and autozero capability and with a UV/Vis resolution ≤0.05 nm. VWR optical glass spectropho-
tometer cells of 10 x 10 x 45 mm (path length 10 mm) and VWR pipettes with adjustable volume transfer of 50 to 250

following manner: THF and MeOH were mixed at a weight ratio of 94: 6, then 1.20 ml of the 10% TBAH was added
to 210 ml of the THF/MeOH solution, serving as the bulk reference solvent. ii) Standard BPA solutions were pre-
pared in the following manner: 20.6, 16.0, and 11.9 mg of the standard BPA solid were randomly weighed up and
fully dissolved into 50 ml of the bulk reference solvent each, respectively, from which the resulting BPA solutions
at 0.412 mg/ml (or 0.003609 meq/ml), 0.320 mg/ml (or 0.002803 meq/ml), and 0.238 mg/ml (or 0.002085 meq/ml)
were further diluted using the bulk reference solvent, randomly and as needed, into multiple sub-standards of
differing concentrations for the purposes of calibration. iii) Resin sample solutions were prepared in the follow-
ing manner: a certain amount of the solid resin samples was weighed up and completely dissolved in 50 ml of
the bulk reference solvent, followed by further dilution using the same bulk reference solvent to obtain the resin
solutions of varying and very diluted concentrations for UV measurements. iv) FBE coating sample solutions were
similarly prepared in the following manner: a certain amount of the two powder coating samples was weighed up
and completely dissolved in 50 ml of the bulk reference solvent, which was centrifuged to remove any undissolved
residue prior to further dilution of the clear solution on top prior to subsequent UV measurements. Meanwhile,
uncentrifuged coating sample solutions of each were also mounted for UV measurements for comparisons, if nec-
essary. In addition, the UV/visible instrument was auto-zeroed at 100% T/0A baseline and 0% T/blacked beam
baseline prior to measuring any resin or coating sample solution; during UV/visible measurement, BPA standards
and multiple sample solutions of varying concentrations were transferred individually into the curvet cell and
measured. The THF/MeOH/TBAH bulk reference solvent was utilized as the reference blank. Absorbance values
measured at wavelengths between 250 and 400 nm were maintained for data processing.
To begin with, Table 7.11 and Figure 7.17 collect the MWs of the six BPA-based phenolic resins evaluated as
received and an illustration of one specific elution profile, respectively. In general, the RI (refractive index) of
GPC reports relative MW values, while the LS (light scattering) delivers absolute MW values, that is, Mn and
Mw, respectively. In addition, the trend of the RI MWs obtained by two independent labs was consistent, albeit

with considerable variations. Specifically, Lab C appeared to have tighter deviation control than Lab M. It is
established that the two sets of three phenolic resins (from two different sources) were identical in terms of MWs.
As anticipated, DEH 85 and KD-405 were equivalent, as were DEH 87 and KD-427, as well as DEH 8X and KD-448.
Please note that Mn from Lab C and Mw from Lab M were adopted for subsequent estimates of the resins’ func-
tionality (f), if necessary. The partitioning pattern depicted in Figure 7.17 is indicative of all of these phenolic
resins; the retention behaviors and MW distribution of two MW-equivalent resins were highly similar, confirming
their equivalence with respect to MWs and EW-PhOHs. In other words, DEH 85 is comparable to KD-405 in terms
of chemical structure and functionality; likewise, DEH 87 is equivalent to KD-427, and DEH 8X closely resem-
bles KD-448 as drop-in offsets. Taking into account Mn data by Lab Resource C and RI in Table 7.11 and BPA’s
monomeric MW of 228.19 g/mol as part of the general structure of BPA-based phenolic resins (refer to Figure 7.18),
the repeating unit numbers n for DEH 85 and KD-405 were around 1.0–1.5. Likewise, the n values for DEH 87 (or
KD-427) and DEH 8X (or KD-448) were 2.0–2.5 and 4.0–4.5, respectively.
In addition, an aqueous TBAH titration for the hydroxyl number on DEH 85, 87, and 8X selected from these
BPA-based phenolic resins was conducted using potentiometric endpoints and reported in Table 7.12, together
with the result of a solvent-borne acetic anhydride titration carried out on a randomly selected DEH 87. These
two types of titrations gave consistent EW-PhOH values, determined to be 204.5 versus 197.8 g/eq. Nevertheless,
these titrated EW-PhOH values significantly deviated from TDS-reported values (refer to Table 7.10). Specifically,
titrations had a tendency to grossly underestimate the results of EW-PhOHs; discrepancies became unacceptable
when resin MWs increased, for example, 205.6 g/eq by titration versus 700 g/eq by TDS or COA for the DEH 8X
resin. Apparently, titration measures just a portion of the overall Ph-OH content of these phenolic resins that are
distinctive from aliphatic polyols. This is ascribed to the fact that aromatic Ph-OHs are only partially liberated for
measurement due to the weak acidity or cationicity of Ph-OH groups. In addition, the greater the MW of the resin,
the lower its solubility, and the more difficult it is to free the acid moieties (H+) of Ph-OH groups. As observed,
DEH 8X did have difficulty completely dissolving in solvents such as acetonitrile or acetic anhydride pyridine,
which are commonly employed in titration. In addition, the presence of aliphatic secondary OHs in the repeating
unit structure of these BPA-based phenolic resins (refer to the signal at 5.35 ppm, Figure 7.18) has the potential to
interfere with titration reactions. These two hydroxyl sources constitute an integral part of titration reactions.
Furthermore, 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra revealed that these phenolic resins are indisputable products of
reactions between monomeric BPAs and BPA-based epoxy resins, and their structural details are depicted in

Figure 7.18, where 1H-NMR peaks at 9.15 and 5.35 ppm are assigned to the Ph-OH and aliphatic secondary-OH
components, respectively. Other signals and their corresponding proton sources are also straightforwardly
correlated to. On the basis of the peak intensity of the Ph-OH moieties at 9.15 ppm in the 1H-NMR spectrum
of each resin or powder coating sample, the weight percentage (wt.%) of the Ph-OH groups can be calculated.
Therefore, the Ph-OH number and the Ph-OH equivalent weight (EW-PhOH) are computed according to the
following equations (Equations 7a/b).
Equation 7a:
OH# of Ph −OH in resin = 56106 × Wt.% of Ph −OH in resin

The 1H-NMR-derived EW-PhOH results are conveniently reported in Table 7.15 for comparisons later.
Irrespective of resin MWs, it appears that EW-PhOHs determined by NMR are significantly closer to the TDS
reported (with an approximate 10% overestimation, if any) than by titrations. Thus far, GPC and NMR have been
used extensively to examine the MWs, and structures of these BPA-based phenolic resins have been extensively
characterized, including the rational quantification of EW-PhOHs by 1H-NMR. Regarding a UV/visible approach,
benzene-containing chemical compounds, such as phenol, BPA, and lignin, are sensitive to UV light; also, the
UV absorption intensity is proportional to the number of Ph-OH groups that are structurally affiliated. TBAH as
an organic co-solvent was found to effectively intensify the UV absorption for detection through the formation
of phenolates (C6H5-O−), as exhibited in Figure 7.19a, where the peak absorbance is sizably magnified and
shifted sharply and consistently from 295 nm to 305 nm regardless of whether the original Ph-OH source is from
the reference BPA, the pure resins, or the formulated coating samples. This is indeed a crucial element upon
which the entire UV/visible technique rests for its validity. Fresh TBAH facilitates the complete and compatible
dissolution of phenolic resins in the bulk reference solvent, that is, the THF/MeOH mixture, without chromic
interference. As confirmed, some common solvents, such as acetone and acetonitrile, are unsuitable for this
application because they drastically disrupt the UV absorption peaks and patterns. The employment of BPA as
the reference compound for qualification and quantification is a second essential element that strongly supports
the UV/visible technique. It appears appropriate to choose BPA over other substances, considering the structural
and functional similarities of BPA monomers with BPA-based phenolic resins. As competitively assessed, BPF

The calibration curve established using the reference BPA solutions listed in Table 7.13.
(i.e., bisphenol-formaldehyde) turned out to be an inappropriate model reference because its UV absorption peak
occurs at 290 nm at any concentrations, as shown in Figure 7.19b, diverging inconsistently from 305 nm (which
is characteristic of all these BPA-based phenolic resin samples), making it unsuitable for quantitative analysis.
The first step toward high-resolution UV/visible quantification is establishing a sound in-situ calibration curve
using reference BPA solutions. As demonstrated in Figure 7.19b, with the universal use of TBAH, the BPA reference
and the BPA-based phenolic resins of varied MWs and concentrations were both proven to invariably have the most
intense absorbance at 𝜆max = 305 nm, validating the calibration proposition. According to the Beer−Lambert rule,
absorbance (A) at 𝜆max is linearly proportional to the concentration (Conc.) of the properly dissolved and diluted
substance, expressed in mg/ml or mmol/ml (a.k.a. meq/ml). Some variations or testing discrepancies may result
from the preparation of the reference and resin sample solutions; for example, it is preferable to use volumetric
flasks each and every time to consistently control the volume-based (not mass-based) concentrations of dilutions
in order to prevent unintended experimental errors.
The data in Table 7.13 reflect a series of randomly and progressively diluted reference BPA solutions prepared
and measured for UV/visible calibration to identify the linear regression zone of A versus Conc., or [Ph-OH].
A deviated gradually from the linear projection as the BPA concentration exceeded 0.001042 meq/ml or
0.1190 mg/ml, as illustrated in Figure 7.20, which was generated by plotting the data; in other words, [Ph-OH]
in meg/ml began to saturate above this minimum concentration. The BPA reference-based calibration curve was
thus established as A = 2183.3 × Conc. + 0.3259 with R2 = 99.59 using data in Table 7.13 excluding those above
the threshold of 0.1190 mg/ml (i.e., the data set un-squared by dashed lines), where A was plotted as a function
of BPA’s [Ph-OH] effective from approximately 0.00030 to 0.001042 meq/ml. As an example of bad calibration,
including the incorrect use of gram/gram (g/g) as the solution concentration unit, a separate calibration equation
was found as A = 23.831 x Conc. + 1.4372 (R2 = 0.999) for the linear range of 0.10% to 0.15%. In this case,
considering a maximum A measured value of 2.1006, the intercept of A(0) equals 1.4372, which corresponded to
an experimental error of up to 68.4%, which was unacceptable for quantification. In comparison, still assuming a
concentration of zero, the linear regression of the calibration curve in Figure 7.20 produces A(0) = 0.3259 (ideally,
A(0) should be zero), which corresponds to an experimental error of 12.6% given the maximum A value of 2.580
(Table 7.13), which is substantially reduced and acceptable. The experimental error is therefore proportional to
the difference between the y-axis intercept value (i.e., at Conc. = 0) and the upper limit of A at 𝜆max within the
linear regression range.

The derived calibration curve or equation in Figure 7.20 shows that [Ph-OH] values ranging from 0.00030 to
0.00104 meq/ml should be used for the Ph-OH content determination of unknown resin or coating samples, cor-
responding to A values ranging from 0.937 to 2.580 (Table 7.13). A measured for any prepared sample solution
must fall within this range of absorption intensity to be effective. Due to errors and variations, concentrations of
any sample solutions resulting in an A value outside of this linear range are unacceptable. In addition, at least two
diluted solutions were measured for each resin sample to attain averaged validation data points. Consequently, an
averaged or mean [Ph-OH] in meq/ml was determined for each of the six resin samples using Equation 7c, or
the calibration equation. As a result, the EW-PhOH and functionality (f) for each resin were calculated using the
following Equations 7d/e. Table 7.14 summarizes all experimental and analytical data, including standard devia-
tions (i.e., ±SD, if any). Functionality (f, Table 7.14) was determined to be about between 2.5 and 4.0 regardless
of resin MWs, which is higher than the structure-defined di-functionality (f = 2). However, it makes sense given
that each phenolic resin is essentially a mixture of BPA monomers (refer to Figure 7.2) and oligomers with varied
MWs and Pd values (Table 7.11 and Figure 7.17).
Table 7.15 compares the Ph-OH contents of all of these pure BPA-based phenolic resin solution samples as
determined by UV/visible and 1H-NMR. Conclusively, the facile UV/visible method is comparable to 1H-NMR
in terms of accuracy, with even improved deviations. Specifically, 1H-NMR may overestimate or underestimate
the EW-PhOH of the same resin samples, whereas UV/visible outperforms 1H-NMR as long as the reference and
resin sample solutions are properly prepared. Leveraging the UV/visible method outlined thus far, it is feasible
to reverse engineer compounded epoxy coatings in terms of their binder and crosslinker resin compositions, par-
ticularly when paired with NMR techniques. Notably and interestingly, substantial large UV/visible spectrum

and a typical novolac epoxy, that is, Kukdo’s KD-213H (EEW 800 g/eq, labeled as KD213), were identified, as
exhibited in Figures 7.21a/b. Specifically, in the absence of TBAH, BPA-based epoxies resulted in a single absorp-
tion peak at 295 nm (corresponding to their BPA-based aromatic structures), whereas novolac epoxies resulted
in two characteristic peaks at 285 and 295 nm, respectively. The underlying peaks at 295 nm coincide with those
of BPA-based phenolic resins (refer to Figure 7.19a). In contrast, in the presence of TBAH, both EPON 2004 and
KD-213H appeared to respond similarly to UV absorption, developing a strong peak at 290 nm and a weak shoulder
peak at 305 nm, although the absorption signal at 305 nm was even weaker for the novolac than for the BPA-based.
Additional testing revealed that CTBN-modified epoxies had a nearly identical response to UV absorption as EPON
2004 with and without the addition of TBAH.

By reviewing the data sets of concentrations and absorptions (Table 7.14) against MWs (Table 7.11), low-MW
resin samples such as DEH 85 and KD-405 appeared to require relatively small sample sizes or more diluted
concentrations between 0.10 and 0.20 mg/ml to fit well within the linear calibration range. In contrast, high-MW
resins such as DEH 8X and KD-448 entailed considerably higher concentrations between 0.36 and 0.55 mg/ml to
surrender within the valid calibration region. Reasonably, the original Ph-OH contents of phenolic resins with
a higher MW are supposedly lower for equal functionality; consequently, larger sample sizes are necessary for
[Ph-OH] in the sample solutions to be at an analogous level and readily detectable within the linear range. A too
high concentration for low-MW resin samples or a too low concentration for high-MW counterparts is likely to
generate invalid data points outside of ranges, as tabulated (in red) in Table 7.14.
When working with formulated or compounded coatings as opposed to pure phenolic crosslinker resins, the
situation gets complicated. It is essential to ascertain qualitatively the type or grade of the bulk epoxy resin used
in the systems of interest. Fortunately, the bulk epoxy resin in, for instance, an unidentified FBE coating for-
mulation may be UV/visible spectrally differentiated without the addition of TBAH by examining the presence
of the novolac-driven peak at 285 nm. Next, it is necessary to apply TBAH as a co-solvent in the subsequent
procedures for qualifying and quantifying any phenolic crosslinking resin in the formulations. Specifically, the
phenolic-characteristic signal at 305 nm remains the focal point, but it is unavoidable that the bulk epoxy binder
resins will interfere with quantification due to their absorption at the same wavelength (Figures 7.21a/b). Evidence
speaks for itself. The UV/visible spectra of two commercially available FBE coatings, IF194M with a known

novolac epoxy and BPA-based phenolic formulation and SK-206N with unknown compositions, are depicted in
Figures 7.21c/d. Qualitatively, both coating samples displayed a single UV/visible absorption signal at 290 nm but
a completely different trending pattern before the peak in the absence of TBAH in the samples; Figure 7.21c is asso-
ciated with a novolac epoxy and a phenolic hardener resin combination. Comparing UV/visible spectral signals in
the presence of TBAH, IF194M exhibited a single peak at 305 nm, whereas SK-206N exhibited two intense peaks
at 295 and 305 nm (Figure 7.21d), respectively. Given that IF194M is known to be composed of a novolac epoxy
and a phenolic resin, and that its UV spectra without and with TBAH are consistently comparable to those of a
reference BPA (Figure 7.19a), it is conclusive that SK-206N is composed of a vastly different resin package, mostly
likely consisting of modified BPA-based epoxies and non-phenolic crosslinkers such as amines. Otherwise, the
absorption signal at 305 nm should be far more intense than that at 295 nm. In general, UV/visible spectra with-
out TBAH are merely qualitative; data analysis reveals that with TBAH, peaks can be assigned to either BPA-based
or novolac-based bulk epoxy resins.
If a BPA calibration curve governing the linear concentration range of [Ph-OH] in meq/ml is constructed, appro-
priately diluted samples can theoretically be scanned to quantify the phenolic resin content, if any, in the original
formulation. In practice, however, formulated FBE coatings are a heterogeneous and reactive mixture of ingredi-
ents that includes more than just resins and curatives of even varying grades; thus, quantitative signals are easily
biased. To clarify, IF194M was constituted of DEH 85 as the crosslinker at 17.8% by weight of the total formulation
and KD-213H as the bulk epoxy resin. In addition, a new calibration curve of A = 2,706.5*Conc. + 0.0225 (where R2
= 0.9999 and Conc. in meq/ml) was constructed for this separate set of measurements using the absorption signals
at 305 nm. Accordingly, the Ph-OH content and EW-PhOHs of IF194M and SK-206N samples were determined,
with the results reported in Table 7.16.
The results are technically instructive and represent a step in the direction of realizing UV/visible’s potential
for reverse engineering of coating formulations in terms of chemistry (qualification) and stoichiometric ratio
(quantification). First, it was determined that unfiltered coating sample solutions of IF194M dissolved or dispersed
in the THF/MeOH solvent with TBAH contain a phenolic crosslinker resin of 207.3 g/eq in terms of EW-PhOH
(Table 7.16), which was an underestimate but reasonably consistent with the employed DEH 85 of actually

∼250 g/eq. In contrast, filtered sample solutions contained EW-PhOH at a concentration of 529.4 g/eq, which
was more than doubled or grossly inflated. Assuming SK-206N contained a phenolic resin, then its EW-PhOH
would be 582.5 g/eq (Table 7.16), which was literally invalid or nonexistent; hence, its formulation did not contain
any phenolic resins, agreeing with qualitative examination (Figures 7.21c/d). 13C-NMR, as executed separately,
confirmed that SK-206N utilized one or a mixture of BPA-based epoxies. Second, and in one aspect, 1H-NMR
conducted on IF194M and SK-206N samples pre-dissolved in DMSO and without filtration or centrifuging (to
separate out pigments and fillers) failed to detect any content of Ph-OHs in either sample, despite the presence
of DEH 85 at a minimum of 17.8% by weight in the IF194M sample. Part of the reason is that the phenolics in
the coating samples were substantially absorbed onto the undissolved fillers, causing them to settle to the bottom
and become undetectable under fast NMR spinning. Specifically, signals at 9.15 and 5.35 ppm corresponding to
phenol hydroxyls and the aliphatic secondary hydroxyls (refer to Figure 7.18) disappeared from each sample,
indicating that the Ph-OH content in the sample solution was at a very low concentration, below the detectable
limits of the NMR spectrometer but still validly measurable by UV/visible. In this sense, UV/visible is superior
to NMR for quantifying phenolic resins in formulated coating samples and at extremely low concentrations.
Third, and in another aspect, when testing formulated coating samples by UV/visible and NMR, filtering sample
solutions should be avoided because it removes resins undissolved or affiliated with the filler particulates, which
prevents them from being supposedly tested; meanwhile, those resin portions, if eliminated by filtration, are
never counted in measurements, but they remain included in the calculation of corresponding concentrations in
preparing sample solutions.
In summary, UV/visible spectroscopy represents a highly capable method for de-formulating specific coat-
ings both qualitatively and quantitatively. For compounded coating samples that have been pre-dissolved
in bulk THF/MeOH solvents, all sample solution tests must be conducted with the addition of TBAH and
without filtering. NMR can be used for a limited degree of qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis of for-
mulated FBE coating samples, depending on the loading level of insoluble and inert pigments and fillers,
while taking into account that NMR detection is primarily reliant on the mobility of molecules. As supporting
evidence, phenolic resins, if included in unfilled FBE powder coatings, are fully detectable by 1H-NMR (refer to
Figure 7.18).
In conclusion and as a supplement, it is advantageous for formulators to create a database of native and exist-
ing FBE formulation portfolios using UV/visible spectral mapping, which proactively serves as a benchmark to
compare or match up with any UV/visible spectrum (with and without TBAH) of any unknown epoxy powder
coating products of interest, enabling reverse engineering of coating formulations to proceed more effectively
and efficiently. Reference spectra should encompass as many conceivable combinations of epoxy resins (i.e., stan-
dard and a variety of modifications such as rubber-, acrylic-, and silicone-modified) and curatives (i.e., amines,
anhydrides, phenolics, etc.) as possible.
Debrief A BMIs and Diels−Alder ring-forming reactions
Structures drive performance, which is true for Compimide MAHD (refer to Figure 7.4f), as has been extensively
discussed, and for MIR-3000 (refer to Figure 7.4g). Resinous MIR-3000 BMI, structurally like Kayahard GPH-103
except for the functional groups (refer to Table 2.4a in Chapter 2), but unlike MAHD BMI, which has a flexible
chain between the functional cyclic vinyl groups, contains a rigid biphenyl between maleimide functionalities.
If properly formulated, the former would confer a far greater Tg and perhaps dielectric strength than the latter.
MIR-3000 was a 70% solid solvent-based material as delivered; purged of solvents, it became brownish, resinous,
and tacky at room temperature, in contrast to HPC-8000 (Figure 6.11c in Chapter 6), which was a solid process-
able for powder coatings when solvent-free. As a result, MIR-3000 as presumably a crosslinking agent in resole
phenolic or BOX systems could not be evaluated; nevertheless, solvent-free MIR-3000 resin itself was thermally
characterized, as shown in Figure 7.22.

DSC histograms of a solvent-free MIR-3000 resin sample.
DSC exotherms (Figure 7.22) demonstrate that after complete melting at roughly 115.3 ∘C, MIR-3000 undergoes
self-crosslinking but requires a highly elevated temperature up to 350 ∘C (Tpeak = 279.3 ∘C at 7.0 ∘C/min),
corresponding to an Ea value up to 69.55 kJ/mol, a very high activation energy threshold. However, its homocures
did not result in a palpable Tg before 350 ∘C, which is rare for BMIs evaluated and indicative of a thermo-
plastic characteristic. It would be interesting to examine how it performs in the formulation of solvent-borne
coatings. In retrospect, when it comes to crosslinking between BMIs and resole phenolics, including BOX and
cyclic vinyl-bearing compounds such as Nadic esters (refer to Figure 7.5a), the progression of Diels−Alder
hetero-O-cycling reactions (refer to Figure 7.15a) is fundamentally based on Ph-OH functions in conjunction
with ortho-substitutions.
Debrief B UV/visible technique
A valid calibration curve should be created utilizing TBAH as a co-solvent and BPA monomers as the reference in
order to deploy an effective UV/visible method capable of accurately measuring phenolic resin concentrations at
trace levels as low as 0.00020 meq/ml in FBE formulations. The BPF reference that exhibits fingerprint absorption
at 288 nm is unsuitable. UV/visible can also be used independently of TBAH to differentiate epoxy resins. A char-
acteristic UV/visible absorption peak at 305 nm that is enhanced by TBAH does not always indicate the presence of
a phenolic component since it may be derived from an epoxy resin component (BPA-based or novolac) or combina-
tions thereof. UV/visible outperforms NMR substantially with regard to quantification of the Ph-OH content and
consequent EW-PhOHs for very limited loading levels of phenolic resins. As a result, the functionality (f) values
for any BPA-based phenolic resins can be obtained from independent MW data using GPC. Moreover, UV/visible
is vastly superior to analytical titrations when it comes to determining the Ph-OH content of phenolic resins with
MWs that vary widely. Anticipatively, the UV/visible technique, by itself or in tandem with other techniques such
as NMR, pyrolysis GC/MS, and DSC, among others as required, creates a facile and effective approach for reverse
engineering undefined coating products such as commercial FBEs.

7 Phenolic Coatings
Recaps and Highlights
Aromaticity and functionality of mildly cationic or acidic Ph-OHs constitute the foundation of phenolic reactivity
and chemistry. Epoxy-phenolic reactions are part of phenolic and benzoxazine (BOX) utilization within the scope
of adhesives and coatings, as exemplified by resole-dominated liquid coatings for direct-to-metal (DTM) can and
coil food packaging and BPA-phenolic-dominated FBE powder coatings for DTM pipeline, rebar, and valve, as
well as fusion bonded BOX-epoxy coating platforms compliant without a primer to ISO 12944-C5M specifications
and HTHP conditions. Mono-PhOH-functional nonyl phenol and similar compounds as effective epoxy curing
accelerators (refer to Figure 2.15a in Chapter 2 and Table 6.2 in Chapter 6) are rooted in the same chemical
mechanism. In addition, resole phenolics are preferred for conventional liquid primers on metal and non-metal
substrates owing to their superior adhesiveness. Isocyanate-cured phenolics can be utilized for a broader range of
applications requiring improved hardness and heat-/chemical-/scratch-resistance, mostly as a result of an increase
in crosslinking density. Particularly, resole phenolics and BOXs are ortho-substituted and PhOH-functional in
nature, and they readily react with BMIs, Nadic (di)esters, or the like via cationic Diels−Alder ring formation to
create an alloy or matrix coating with supreme impermeability and adhesion as the most promising option for
steel tank and pipe inner-diameter lining intended for hydrogen or ammonia storage and transportation, pend-
ing real-world validation. Alternately, Ph-OHs in phenolics can be crosslinked by melamine or a variety of its
derivatives (e.g., HMMM; refer to Figure 4.5b in Chapter 4) under acid catalysis, which will be discussed in depth
in Chapter 8 of microencapsulation. It is feasible to increase the toughness of brittle polybenzoxazines by suit-
ably reacting BOXs with an epoxy-phenolic blend, as investigated, with blocked isocyanates of preferably higher
de-blocking temperatures than 180–200 ∘C, with cyclic-vinyl-functional BMIs, and others.
Phenolic or PF resins continue to evolve globally to embrace a greater extent of green footprints, particularly
with modifications of lignin (i.e., an amorphous polyphenol and the second most abundant renewable resource
after cellulose from wood) in WB, SB, and powder coatings and adhesives in the direction of a circular economy.
From the standpoint of applied formulations, the EW-PhOH in g/eq of phenolics as crosslinkers and the overall
formulation index (or the stoichiometric ratio) determine the final performance of heterogeneous coating prod-
ucts. All multi-functional phenolic grades in largely liquid form, such as novolacs, resoles, polyvinyl-based, and
perhaps others, range from 110 to 150 g/eq in terms of EW-PhOHs and contain various amounts of free phenol.
In contrast, the uniquely di-functional BPA-based phenolic resins in solid form range from 250 to 710 g/eq and
contain a considerable amount of free BPA, depending on their MWs or EW-PhOHs; moreover, their strictly lin-
ear para-structures (refer to Figure 7.1f, where the aliphatic secondary hydroxyl encourages modifications, e.g.,
by isocyanates, melamine, or silicones, when necessary) confer advantageous flexibility and/or toughness. Over
time, an increasing number of high-performance phenolic-based coating and adhesive products, including itera-
tive enhancements, will be introduced to address emerging and expanding applications.
Referring to Figure 7.23 in greater detail, phenolic self-crosslinking relies predominantly on resoles due to the
fact that methylene and methylol ethers can undergo condensation and ring-forming reactions under heat (refer to
Figures 7.3a/b, respectively). BOXs, on the other hand, are subject to thermally or cationically driven ring-opening
reactions or self-crosslinking. Notably, when appropriately formulated using ZnAcAc or others as an effective cata-
lyst, ortho-substituted resole phenolic-BMI systems, particularly BOX-BMI coatings, serve as advanced functional
coatings with medium-high Tg up to 150–165 ∘C, toughness per impact resistance up to 160 lb-in, impermeability
down to zero water uptake at 95 ∘C for 28 days, and wet adhesion-sustaining three-phase autoclaves, all combined,
enabling perhaps the most challenging interior-oriented (due to color) applications, including energy storage sce-
narios in which the temperature and pressure are exploded to extremes.
In terms of crosslinking reactions and catalysis, phenolic- and BOX-associated ring-opening and ring-reforming
polymerizations are primarily catalyzed by cationic or acidic catalysts, whereas epoxy crosslinking (i.e.,
ring-opening of epoxides) is predominantly anionically catalyzed. Consequently, many Lewis acids and similar

compounds, in addition to organometallic complexes such as tin-based and others, and ZnAcAc, play crucial
roles as catalysts and/or accelerators for curing bulk phenolic systems, including BOX-BMI coatings.
In conclusion, when it comes to measurements of Ph-OH contents and EW-PhOHs for QC and reverse
engineering of particularly pure BPA-based phenolic resins or compounded formulations, UV/visible is capable
of producing an instantly recordable absorption signal at concentrations as low as 0.00020 meq/ml and below,
exceeding conventional NMR and titration techniques by a significant margin. Regardless of qualitative or quan-
titative objectives, it is essential to employ TBAH as an exclusive co-solvent or catalyst to enable the identification
and examination of significant UV/visible absorption signals ranging between 285 and 305 nm. Also described
as a catalyst in Michael Addition floor coatings [66] is TBAH as a strong base. High purity BPA monomers are
preferably utilized as a standard reference compound for accurate calibration and evaluations.

Microencapsulation
8.1
Morphology
Commonly used scalable encapsulation technologies are generally intended for the controlled or triggered release
of active components such as catalysts, intermediates, peroxides, active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), bioac-
tive compounds (e.g., antimicrobials [1]), and so forth. These typically unstable or sensitive liquid (oily or watery)
and solid substances are protectively enclosed as the core (or internal) material or the payload in microcapsules
consisting of a coating as the solid external shell, overall exhibiting a microsphere or core/shell morphology as
depicted in Figure 8.1. Either the core substance is hydrophobic (oil-soluble) or hydrophilic (water-soluble). In
addition to release on demand or delayed activation, matrix particles and core/shell capsules can serve two other
important purposes: shielding sensitive components from their surroundings and compatibility of the core mate-
rial with the formulation conditions (i.e., improved processibility, such as converting a 2K into a 1K). Release
methods include mechanical force (shear, pressure), diffusion, and change in environmental conditions such as
stimuli-responsive [2] and pH (e.g., Li et al. [3]), temperature, or moisture, among others. For example, according
to www.provivi.com and BASF, encapsulation of pheromones proven to protect crops from major crop-damaging
insects is preferred for sustainable pest management in agricultural fields around the world; the feasibility will
be reviewed in conclusion. Existing as a dry powder or dispersed slurry prior to formulation and application,
microcapsules have been and continue to be adopted as functional ingredients by industries such as pharmaceuti-
cal, agrochemical, food and feedstocks, paper, image products, cosmetic and personal care, construction, coatings
including corrosion inhibition or protection, and so on.
Table 8.1 lists the primary physical and chemical techniques used to produce microcapsules ranging from
approximately 1.0 μm to 1 mm (1,000 μm). Notably, microcapsules with a micro-spherical morphology can be
manufactured physically by means of atomization and chemically by means of solvent evaporation. Almost
all remaining processes and methods produce micro-/nano-capsules with a core/shell morphology. It should
be noted that core/shell rubber (CSR) technologies are widely used in industries, with the soft polymeric core
typically designed for impact resistance using butadiene/styrene (SBR), polybutadiene (PBR), acrylic, or siloxane
(supposedly to emerge as the second phase in the cured film of the bulk polymers), and the hard-shell material
intended to be compatible with the bulk thermosetting resins. To improve the toughness of coatings, adhesives,
and composites, CSR-modified (chemically) or -incorporated (physically) resins and prepolymers are commonly
utilized. For example, commercial CSR resin products include Kukdo’s KR-693 (EEW 850, acrylic CSR modified),
Olin’s Fortegra 310 (EEW 425–472, 10% CSR), Kaneka’s KaneAce MX 125 (EEW 243, 25% SBR), MX 156
(EEW 243, 25% PBR), MX 960 (EEW 243, 25% siloxane), and Alberdingk AC 2598 (acrylic CSR, OH-functional
dispersion), among many others. In terms of the processible viscosity of microcapsule precursor fluids (including
solutions), spinning disks can deal with hotmelts with a viscosity of up to 10,000 cPs, but all other processes
prefer viscosities below 1,000 cPs (Table 8.1). In terms of producible microcapsule sizes, EHD and microfluidic
approaches can produce smaller capsules than other physical techniques; nonetheless, all chemical mechanisms

allow capsules as small as one micron in size to be manufactured (Table 8.1). Nanoparticles are referred to those
having dimensions of less than 100–500 nm (0.1–0.5 μm), whereas nano- and macro-capsules are typically less
than 1 μm and greater than 1 mm (1,000 μm), respectively.
Consider alkyd resins, for example, which transition from solvent-borne to waterborne alkyds and alkyd emul-
sions. Due to the relatively high viscosity of alkyds, resin emulsification by hydrophilic non-ionic and/or anionic
surfactants as emulsifiers (refer to Figure 8.10a) to generate oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions is typically prepared by
mechanical agitation normally below 100 ∘C (e.g., at 80 ∘C) and under atmospheric pressure conditions via the
phase inversion method [4]. If the acidic groups of the resin are not already neutralized, a base (such as potassium
hydroxide or KOH) is added to neutralize them (refer to Figure 8.4). Weak bases, such as amine derivatives, are
recommended as neutralizers as they reduce the likelihood of alkyd hydrolysis, particularly when the emulsifica-
tion process is carried out at higher temperatures. Solids content, particle size, and viscosity are the process control
parameters for alkyd emulsification.
Separately, and in comparison to microcapsules, chemical, physical, and hybrid hydrogels, with water as their
main constituent, can be classified according to their particle sizes (not pore sizes) as macro- (>100 μm), micro-
(100 nm−100 μm), and nano-gels (< 100 nm), which may be different from capsule size definitions. There are
two varieties of hydrogel architecture: microgels and microcapsules, without and with core/shell morphology,
respectively [5]; morphology is fundamental for both microgels (such as PNIPAM-co-PEGMA) and microcapsules.
Hydrogels with effective pores are interconnected throughout the particle due to common or consistent chemical
compositions, such as poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) or PNIPAM [6]. As a result, water-swellable but -insoluble
hydrogels typically exhibit abrupt volume transitions, whereas microcapsules do not (due to their heterogeneous
and tightly closed shell layer). The release of hydrogels is pore size-dependent and triggered by manipulating, for
example, the network’s viscosity, while the release of microcapsules is triggered by controlling the shell’s perme-
ability to the incorporated payloads (for example, pharmaceuticals) [7]. In addition to drug delivery and tissue
engineering, hydrogels are used to manufacture contact lenses, hygiene products, and wound dressings.
Typically, the surfaces of spherical microcapsules and hydrogels are isotropic and chemically homogeneous, as
opposed to the surfaces of, for example, patchy particles, which are colloidal particles at the micro- or nano-scale,
which exhibit anisotropic patterns or orientations (to facilitate strong interactions) through physical shape modi-
fication, surface chemistry, or both. Patchy particles can have valency ranging from two (Janus particles) to at least

Physical Encapsulation
Equipment-intensive physical encapsulation, as led by atomization, spray coating, and co-extrusion of various
nozzles, does not involve chemical reactions to build a shell or wall encircling active ingredients as a protective
barrier. Microfluidic systems are likely the most promising physical method of microencapsulation for fabricat-
ing nano-capsules with an exact capsule size. It should be noted that i) atomization, including spray drying
(Figure 8.2a) and spinning disks, are capable of encapsulating active ingredients with hotmelts; ii) fluid bed
coating (Figure 8.2b) can produce core/shell microcapsules with a solid core of even irregular shapes; and iii)
EHD nozzles and microfluidic methods are capable of producing microcapsules of finer sizes ranging from one to
100 μm. Southwest Research Institute (SwRI; www.swri.org/industries/microencapsulation) is one of the leading
companies in physical microencapsulation technologies that bridge the gap between academia and industry.
Alternatively, active chemicals or molecules are simply absorbed onto or into an absorptive yet inert carrier
such as precipitated silica (e.g., typically 9–10 μm in particle size), zeolite, a pigment, or a filler (e.g., BaSO4) of

fine particles (i.e., large surface areas), among others, such as Ca(OH)2 capsules for pharmaceutical medications.
One of the primary objectives of these specialty physical encapsulations (or semi-encapsulations) is to transform
a liquid into a free-flowing powder that facilitates easier and more uniform processing, such as dispersing and
extruding. A large number of liquid ingredients, including resins, crosslinkers, catalysts, and additives, can be
readily encapsulated into a flowable powder for subsequent compounding, such as powder coatings. Companies
such as Estron Chemical, Synthron/Proxchem, and Sovereign Technologies offer commercially available encapsu-
lated products, such as Resiflow PF-67 (a polyacrylate at 67% by weight carried on amorphous silica) as a melting
flow and leveling agent, Butaflow BT-71 (dibutyltin dilaurate or DBTDL at 71% by weight) as a tin-based catalyst,
ESCAT 50 (2-isopropyl imidazole or 2IPI at 50% active) as a latent catalyst, ESCAT 60 (2-propyl imidazole or 2PI at
60% active) as a latent catalyst, and Curaid 246TA-P (i.e., DMP-30 at 65% active; refer to Table 2.5b in Chapter 2)
as a catalyst as well. 2IPI and 2PI are typically liquid and semi-solid, respectively, at ambient temperature. Many
resins and crosslinkers discussed previously are encapsulated components, such as Epikote 760 (70% active; refer
to Table 6.10 in Chapter 6), siloxane amine hardeners SH-120/-180/-240/-300 (90% active each; refer to Table 6.12),
Cyphos IL 169 (70% active; refer to Tables 6.21/6.22/6.31), jER YX7400 (90% active; refer to Table 6.25), and so on.
Moreover, bioactive pheromones should be physically encapsulated using a silica carrier for low-cost conversion,
distribution, and application, subject to validation.
Functional fillers, such as alumina ceramics treated with a silane before formulation, are an additional example
of physical encapsulation in a broader scope (or pseudo-encapsulation) from which silane release is expected
following heating or mixing. Silane-treated fillers and pigments are more compatible with bulk resins and other
coating ingredients in terms of mixing homogeneity; Table 8.2 describes the relevant calculations (please note,
the loaded vinyl, depending on MWs, may contribute to cure reactions in certain formulations). A speed mixer is
effective enough to carry out lab-scale surface treatment of fillers with silanes.
In addition, vacuum-capable speed mixers (e.g., Hauschild’s, FlackTek’s, etc.) are preferred for surface treatment
or carrier operations at a small scale, for example, in an industrial or academic laboratory; physical encapsulation
using silica carriers can be conducted at a large industrial scale utilizing a conventional planetary mixer with heat-
ing capacity, where the shear speed, heating if necessary, and the carrier particle size (associated with absorptive
surface areas) account for three processing variables. Optionally, a fluid (liquid or solid) may be added as a filler
or carrier media at a controlled loading rate under agitation and heat, or vice versa, depending on the viscosity

b) A-172 silane: vinyl functional, surface area of wettability: 278.0 m2/g, MW 280.4 g/mol
c) Theoretical amount of silane required to treat filler = grams filler * filler surface area/silane wetting surface
d) Thus, 1,000 g of A 3000 FL requires a minimum of 1,000*2.6/278.0 = 9.35 g of A-172 for surface treatment
of the fluid and wettability of the carrier by the fluid to be encapsulated. In a broader sense, fluidized bed coat-
ing refers to the physical encapsulation of substrates (e.g., sizable steel panels) by a liquid or powder paint using
heat. Encapsulation via a physical technique is straightforward and of a value proposition for particularly tempo-
rary protection, applicable to many fluids of interest but not all, notably those intermediates that are thermally
unstable and/or volatile. In consideration of encapsulating a substance in practice, simple physical encapsulation
may be first considered based on the purposeful capsule morphology, workable shell materials, and end release
application, unless it is absolutely required to resort to a chemical encapsulation technique.
8.3
Chemical Encapsulation
Chemical microencapsulation, despite being less labor- and cost-intensive than physical microencapsulation
methods, is perhaps more challenging to formulate due to the chemical reactions that must be appropriately
executed throughout the dynamic emulsification process. When it comes to homogenizing emulsions, rotor-stator
homogenizers typically produce microcapsules of a larger size, whereas high-pressure homogenizers produce
microcapsules of a smaller size. In Table 8.1, phase separation, coacervation, in-situ polymerization, and inter-
facial polymerization are categorized as emulsion techniques, along with solvent evaporation of homogeneous
or heterogeneous systems, which can be used to produce microcapsules with either microsphere or core/shell
morphology. Specifically, phase separation processes include i) coacervation involving polar and non-polar
repulsive forces where phases become rich in different polymers occurring in concentrated solutions, ii) complex
coacervation involving electrostatic attractive forces in that phases differ by being polymer rich or depleted
occurring at low concentrations (also salts suppress complex formation), and iii) flocculation (or precipitation)
where attractive forces dominate and insolubilize particles (on which both complex and simple coacervation
effects can play a role). Simple coacervation refers to the use of a single polymer, such as water-soluble gelatin
(i.e., cationic Type A or anionic Type B), chitosan (usually cationic), sodium alginate (2Na-alginate + CaCl2 →
Ca-alginate gel + 2NaCl salt, as depicted in Step 1 of Figure 1 by Zhu et al. [10]), oil-soluble ethyl cellulose,
and so on. Complex coacervation, on the other hand, requires the neutralization of two polymers with opposite
charges in an aqueous solution, such as negatively charged Arabic gum and positively charged gelatin [11].
Separately, in-situ polymerization with shell ingredients all dissolved in the aqueous phase is only applicable
to O/W (oil-in-water) systems. In the following subsections of this chapter, in-situ polymerization processing
via a propeller mixer and formulations of UF (urea-formaldehyde), MF (melamine-formaldehyde), and UMF
(urea-melamine-formaldehyde) microcapsules will be highlighted as an exhibition, followed by a detailed
discussion of other enabling processes and chemistry, such as interfacial polymerization via a homogenizer and
hybrid epoxy-amine-acrylate reactions. The particle size distribution of microcapsules resulting from interfacial
polymerization is amenably narrow, whereas that resulting from phase separation and in-situ shell formation by
high-shear mixers is typically broad. Microencapsulation is analogous, on a microscopical scale, to the polymer
surface coating of a flowable liquid, soft solid, or liquid droplet substrate in one way or another.
UFs and MFs (a.k.a., aminoplasts) are the two most common and viable amino resins and amino poly-
mers, including as a shell material for microcapsules, and perhaps the most important and widely used class
of amino-resin adhesives [14], competing with phenoplasts (i.e., phenolic resins). Note that urea (EW-NH

330
8 Microencapsulation
30.04 g/eq), melamine (i.e., 2,4,6-triamino-1,3,5-triazine, EW-NH 42.04 g/eq), and formaldehyde (HCHO, EW
30.04 g/eq) are chemically four-, six-, and two-fold reactive, respectively. UF and MF are the polymeric conden-
sation products of urea and melamine’s thermosetting reactions with formaldehyde, respectively. The major
weakness of UF is the degradation or hydrolysis of aminomethylenic linkages caused by water or moisture.
Therefore, pure UF coatings and adhesives are used for only interior applications. MF polymers have far greater
resistance to water and heat than UF polymers, making them ideal for exterior and semi-exterior uses such
as wood panels. The introduction of urea-glyoxal (UG) resins and derivatives is due to the absence of HCHO,
which will be discussed in Debrief B. Because MF-based adhesives are expensive, UMF resins and polymers are
developed by combining with a greater or lesser amount of urea. UF, MF, and UMF share a similar chemistry
of either acid- or alkaline-induced addition and subsequent condensation polymerization [15], as illustrated
in Figure 8.3a, in which both methylene and methylene ether linkages are readily formed. Note that novolac
and resole PF (phenol-formaldehyde) resins or polymers (refer to Figures 7.1g/h in Chapter 7) are produced
conditionally when phenol is substituted for urea or melamine in Figure 8.3a. Various urea to melamine to

formaldehyde molar ratios are applicable to acid-catalyzed UMF condensation; adverse acid etching (on metal
substrates) is avoided when pH is greater than 4.0; mildly acidic NH4CI and AlCl3 are exemplary UF and UMF
curing agents.
Notably, the self-crosslinking of methylol (−CH2OH) groups via condensation is not restricted to urea and
melamine prepolymers alone; it occurs in other compounds, such as N-methylolacrylamide (NMA), contain-
ing dual functions of −CH2OH and vinyl moieties, to produce methylene ether linkages (primary, which may
undergo additional ring-forming reactions; refer to Figure 7.3b in Chapter 7) and methylene bridges (secondary),
as reported by Chen et al. [13] and shown in Figure 8.3b, which are capable of film forming and therefore coating
applications. NMA co-polymerizes with acrylates through its vinyl functions (Figure 8.3c), and the resulting poly-
mers can further self-condensate (releasing H2O and HCHO) to produce a film-forming polymer with methylene
linkages (Figure 8.3d), similar to UF/UMF polymers. Heat-induced crosslinking between intermolecular CH2OH
and NH moieties (to release water) has been used to create 1K SB epoxy-free polyphenalkamine coatings [16].
HMMM (hexamethoxymethyl melamine, MW 390.44, theoretical EW 130.0, practical EW ∼150.0 g/eq; refer
to Figure 4.5b in Chapter 4, where −CH2OCH3 is the methoxymethyl group) resins have secured their own
place in both water- and solvent-borne coating compositions of particularly woodworking, coil, and automotive
applications, due to their superior adhesion, attainable flexibility, lower self-condensation tendency, and favorable
film-forming structure [17]. Although HMMM resins are accessible as pure waxy solids, they are most commonly
employed as slightly modified or condensed viscous liquids that are more manageable. To increase the solubility of
monomeric MF resins in solvents, they are frequently etherified using alcohols such as methanol and n-butanol.
Under acidic conditions, they readily react with thiol, hydroxyl, carboxyl, and amide groups at a relative reac-
tive rate (in descending order) of −SH > −OH (both primary and secondary) > −CONH2 > −COOH (including
anhydrides). Melamine and amino derivative crosslinkers are further discussed in Debrief A. If not etherified,
HMMM resins undergo crosslinking to form a network under heat alone, with or without acidification. Pure
melamine and modifications (such as HMMM) are used to crosslink alkyds (essentially polyesters), epoxies, and
polyester polyol resins for surface coatings with a wide range of properties, such as extremely slow to very fast cure
speeds. Intra-molecular self-condensation of amino resins is detrimental to adhesion development. The extent of
cure of amino resins has a substantial impact on the adhesion performance of coatings, such as coil coatings.
Major aminoplast manufacturers include Allnex, Prefere Resins/INEOS, BASF, Doorichem, and P&ID Co.; MF
resins are marketed under a variety of trade names, including Cymel, Resimene, Luwipal, Melcross, MM, and
CCP MR. In the meantime, the Nacure® line of acid catalysts from King Industries is recognized as exemplary of
aminoplast-related acid catalysts. Silver Fern Chemical also offers a range of acid and blocked acid catalysts for
amino-crosslinked coatings, adhesives, and inks.
8.3.1
Core/shell microcapsules via in-situ polymerization
Referring back to chemical encapsulation, Figure 8.4 exhibits an applied formulation and contingent process
breakdowns of UF microcapsules produced at an industrial scale, i.e., approximately 6,000 lbs per batch. In gen-
eral, the oil phase (or “FILL”) containing solvents (e.g., 30% benzyl benzoate and 70% hydrocarbon) and the active
ingredients (i.e., color-formers in this case) is prepared independently, as is the water or aqueous phase (or “PRE-
CON”) containing water-soluble urea and formaldehyde (i.e., HCHO), reactive ingredients, at a molar ratio of
1.012. The stoichiometric ratio of urea to HCHO is preferably slightly greater than one so that there are no residual
free formaldehyde concerns (recall that urea and HCHO have the same equivalent weight of 30.04), also resulting
in a theoretical capsule payload of approximately 58.2% as intended. Heat may be applied to ensure complete
dissolving of all components in the oil and water phases. As an excellent buffer, potassium tetraborate dehy-
drate (K2B4O7•4H2O) is used to prevent pre-curing reactions of UF from taking place during the “PRECON” step.
Deionized (DI) water is preferred in all processes to minimize unwanted seeds that may interfere with microen-
capsulation under high shear using a propeller mixer for breaking down the oil phase into small droplets with a

mean particle size of 12 μm (the smaller the capsule particle size, the larger the overall surface area is formed).
During in-situ polymerization, oil droplets or pre-cured microcapsules phase separate in a continuous water phase
in which highly water-soluble urea and HCHO as the intended capsule wall or shell reactants migrate and con-
dense onto oil droplets as individual substrate vehicles as soon as the pH condition under 2.0, preferably 1.6 to
1.9, is sustained by the controlled addition of the liquid hydrogen chloride (HCl) as the acid catalyst. Salt (NaCl)
charged prior to the loading of the “FILL” in the encapsulation stage is intended to adjust the density of the con-
tinuous water phase to be close to that of the oil phase so that it better prevents the discontinuous oil phase (i.e.,
oil droplets) from re-consolidating with each other, thereby allowing for sustainable dispersion or suspension of
the entire liquid mixture containing microcapsules.

8.3 Chemical Encapsulation
333
Quantitatively, there is a minor deficiency in HCHO or an excess of urea in the aqueous phase formulation used
to eliminate HCHO residues. The capsule core or payload consists of the entire oil phase; the capsule wall content,
which consists of HCHO and equivalent urea fully polymerized during polymerization, is not exactly known but
is supposedly less than 41.6% since the condensation reaction releases water; the total wall content should be
optimized by running DOEs while taking capsule particle sizes into account. The agitating shear regulates capsule
particle sizes; in general, the larger the capsule size, the thicker the capsule wall or shell. However, a thicker
shell resists premature breakages more effectively, whereas a larger size is more susceptible to cracking; there
is a balance between these two universal parameters. Other microcapsule parameters, such as the payload, and
processing variables, such as the cure schedule, are provided in Figure 8.4, which is a technically informative
showcase of both laboratory and industrial microencapsulation operations.
Using the formulation and processing of UF microcapsules as a model, robust MF and UMF microcapsules
with optional active ingredients (rather than color-formers) are readily developed by adhering to a similar wall
content and a molar ratio of urea/melamine from zero (i.e., melamine-free) to 100% of melamine (i.e., urea-free)
to formaldehyde at, for example, 1.012. For such 1K systems (reactive components, excluding the catalyst, are all
in a single phase), melamine derivatives such as HMMM are applicable alternatives; nevertheless, all is subject
to adjustments according to experimental verification, the feasible capsule size, and the release requirements of
actual applications.
8.3.2
Core/shell microcapsules via interfacial polymerization
Interfacial polymerization still entails emulsification, in which, if present, surfactants play an important role in
creating a dynamic interface between the oil and water phases. Specifically, unlike in-situ UF microencapsulation
and more similar to 2K liquid coatings, the capsule shell or wall components in interfacial polymerization are
selectively and separately dissolved in both the oil and water phases prior to emulsification (via mixing of the
two phases followed by immediate homogenization), which forms interfaces where polymerization develops the
capsule wall wrapping on the payload liquid emulsified as oil droplets (infant capsules).
As shown in Figure 8.6, microcapsules based on hybrid epoxy-acrylate chemistry were effectively developed
for the production of pressure-sensitive papers decades ago. As depicted in Figure 8.5a, primary and secondary
amines serve a crucial bridging role in the related curing mechanisms, in which Michael Addition reactions (i.e.,
Steps 1 and 2) drive co-polymerization. Crosslinking of epoxies by primary and secondary amines, including Steps
3 and 2′ in Figure 8.5a, also contributes to the overall cure reactions. In a hybrid system composed of epoxies and
acrylates as the bulk co-resins, the readily reactive amine co-crosslinker is required, as previously reported (refer
to Subsection 2.2.2.2 in Chapter 2 and Table 6.2 in Chapter 6). In addition, the highly water-soluble DETA is
perfectly incorporated in the water phase, whereas only oil- or solvent-soluble TMPTA and epoxy resins are applied
in the oil phase along with the active ingredients (color-formers in this case) to be encapsulated, preferably and
appropriately applying heat where necessary.
Given the chemistry fundamentals as described (Figure 8.5a), robust batchwise- and industrial scale (e.g.,
26,000 lbs per batch)-capable microencapsulation as outlined in Figure 8.6 explains the formulation and pro-
cessing details for producing viable microcapsules, which are aimed at 8.5% color-former loading, 12.0% wall
content, and 5 μm capsule size with uniform distribution via a homogenizer. In one aspect, pre-emulsification
is comparable to in-situ polymerization in that the pre-prepared oil and water phases are blended; however, the
bulk co-resins dissolved in the oil phase, along with BPA monomers as co-crosslinkers are not reactive until
DETA as the primary crosslinker and 2MI as the catalyst loaded in the water phase are diffused to the interfaces.
In another aspect, and in a different manner, the blended oil and water phases are emulsified at 30 ∘C using a
high-shear homogenizer following pre-mixing and agitation but prior to the post-curing step. Specifically, acrylate
(i.e., TMPTA or trimethylolpropane triacrylate) and epoxy (i.e., DEN 438) resins are dissolved in solvents (i.e.,
composed of benzyl benzoate/butyl diglyme/hydrocarbon at a ratio of 65/10/25 by weight) along with a package

of color-formers as the active ingredients in the oil phase. In addition, BPA monomers (refer to Figure 7.1b in
Chapter 7) are added as a co-crosslinker at 17.8% by weight of the epoxy resin in order to toughen the capsule
wall and accelerate the epoxy/amine cure speed; BPA reactions with primary or secondary amines are not a
concerned issue unless they are transition-metal catalyzed [18].
The oil phase is heated to approximately 93 ∘C for dissolving color-formers and then cooled to 60 ∘C before
loading BPA and the epoxy resin under mixing for 30 min and TMPTA for another 30 min, followed by charging
the temperature-sensitive hydrocarbon diluent when the phase temperature falls below 40 ∘C. Still specifically, in
the separate water phase, additives, that is, polyvinyl alcohol as a dispersing agent at ∼0.6% by weight and Tamol
SN (Figure 8.5b) as an anionic surfactant emulsifier at 4.0% of the total water phase, are loaded first, followed by
charging the 2MI catalyst into the aqueous phase at 82 ∘C under agitation for 30 min prior to loading the amine
crosslinker (i.e., DETA or diethylenetriamine) at 40 ∘C and admixing for another 30 min.
Following the independent preparation of the water and oil phases, a bulk oil-in-water (O/W) mixture is formed
by blending these two phases in a larger transition tank for a brief period of time (e.g., within 5 min) at a low
shear and temperature, for example, 500 rpm and 30 ∘C, respectively, prior to immediate emulsification using a
high-shear homogenizer or pump at, for example, 6,500–7,000 rpm for a capsule size objective of ∼5.0 μm. Due to
the introduction of amino protons into the color-formers from pending shell chemicals that are not yet building
the capsule shell layer, a color change is immediately visible upon blending. Due to minimized liquid/liquid inter-
facial tension, normal microcapsules are invariably spherical; the capsule size is determined by variables such as
the emulsification speed, solvent blend, oil-to-water phase ratio, mixed viscosity, temperature, and perhaps others.

Formulation (2K) and interfacial polymerization of hybrid epoxy-acrylate microcapsules.
The bulk blend is kept under constant and appropriate agitation until it is all emulsified into microcapsules for
conveniently undergoing interfacial polymerization while released into a post-cure hold tank where the micro-
capsule slurry (with an off-white color or colorless) is thermally cured by heating it up to 88 ∘C and being held for
at least six hours at this temperature before being discharged as a finished batch of a hybrid microcapsule product.
The pH of the completed capsule slurry is typically over 8.5 (i.e., anionic-ally charged) or can be adjusted by the
addition of ammonia (a Lewis base) to prevent settling during storage and transport.

DOE Example of Microcapsule Formulation and Processing Optimization
Color-former-containing microcapsules developed by companies such as 3M for the production of carbonless
(pressure-sensitive) paper were the single largest industrial application of microcapsules until the early 2000s.
Regardless of micro-emulsification by in-situ polymerization or interfacial polymerization, the capsule size, the
capsule wall content, and the active ingredient-containing payload were the most important and controllable fac-
tors (inputs) that affect the intended functional properties (outputs) of microcapsules (imaging properties in the

case of carbonless), which were subject to optimization for cost-effectiveness and the best possible performance.
Using the hybrid epoxy-acrylate microcapsule of color-formers (such as proton-accepting dyes supplied by Fukui
Yamada Chemical/Nagase) for carbonless applications as an example (refer to Figure 8.6), four formulation and
processing variables at two levels each were defined of interest, including the capsule wall content, the capsule
size (determined by the emulsifying shear rate), the dye ratio, and the dye loading, which were experimentally
designed into a total of nine batches.
The design of experiments (DOEs) is re-summarized in Table 8.3, where the dye “C” represents the “Current” dye
or color-former package with a high level of black dyes and “O” represents the “Original” package with a low level
of black dyes. Summarily, a fractional factorial DOE comprising four variables at two levels each was considered
and executed to evaluate the effects of such parameters, once again, the wall content, the capsule size, the dye ratio,
and the dye loading as specified, on the imaging performance and manufacturability of carbonless-oriented micro-
capsules. Batch #9 is included in Table 8.3 to represent the arithmetic mean of all variables (except the “Current”
dye ratio). Specifically, it was of interest to investigate which variables, if any, cause spotting (i.e., fisheyes) and/or
backgrounding defects on commercial CBs (coated backs; refer to Figure 8.7) of multi-part forms. The formulation

breakdowns of the first five batches in Table 8.3 are presented in Table 8.4, where the “std,” which is exactly the
formulation detailed in Figure 8.6, is included as a benchmark or reference, with a dye load of 8.5%, a wall content
of 12.2%, total solids of 48.4%, and active solids of 45.8%, respectively, differing slightly from the central point (or
Batch #9) in terms of the dye ratio and loading.
Two primary factors, capsule wall content and capsule size, constitute the performance metrics of color-forming
microcapsules. First, there was the characterization of microcapsules individually and as a bulk dispersion in terms
of the capsule size, the capsule slurry viscosity and solids content, the SRT (solvent-resistant test) indicated by the

L* value of a CIE color system, the sieving residue retained on a 25 μm screen, and the SCT (self-contained test)
indicated by the L* and/or b* value of the same CIE color system, respectively, as reported in Table 8.5, all with
greater or lesser variations based on actual formulation and processing. In general, the larger the SRT-L* value,
the greater the capsule’s resistance to solvents; similarly, the closer the SCT-b* is to zero, the better the capsule’s
resistance to solvents. However, data reveal that there was no association between SRT-L* or SCT-b* and spotting
or fisheye defects. According to a linear regression, SRT-L* = 29.8 + 3.62 x wall content indicates that increasing the
capsule wall content increased the SRT-L* value, which was indicative of more robust capsules for a given capsule
size. The regression equation sieve% = −3.83 + 1.01 x capsule size established a strong correlation of sieve results
to capsule size, revealing that larger capsule sizes gave rise to a greater population of capsules bigger than 25 μm.
It is believed that large capsules are to blame for spotting and backgrounding issues on commercial developer CF
(coated front) and CFB (coated front with a developer and back with microcapsules) sheets (Figure 8.7) because
they are more susceptible to breakage upon inadvertent abrasion or pressure.
In addition, there was the qualification of end-user-defined imaging attributes such as speed, ultimate density,
sensitivity, and scuff (resistant to capsule breakage) as performance metrics. These imaging properties as out-
puts were fully assessed and reported in Table 8.6, where each capsule slurry was converted into CBs at the same
active solids content using laboratory drawdowns. Conclusively, within the DOE’s scope, Batch #5 with a small
capsule size (3.7 μm), a low wall content (10%), but a high dye ratio and loading (10.2%) appeared to outperform
others in terms of overall imaging performance as opposed to commercial specifications. As anticipated, larger
capsule sizes (e.g., Batches #1/#2/#3/#7) resulted in faster imaging speed, denser ultimate, and more sensitive
to break, all corresponding to lower measured values. Degradation or stability of microcapsules over time was
primarily attributed to the capsule wall’s mechanical strength, not thickness. There exists a balance or crossover
point between the capsule size and the wall content for a particular microcapsule system to exhibit the greatest
performance and stability. Data were further analyzed using statistical ANOVA and MATLAB to generate corre-
lations between imaging qualities (Output 2) and designing variables (Inputs) with regression equations listed in
Table 8.6. Clearly, color-former ratios almost had little or no effect on the final image performance. Imaging speed,
ultimate sensitivity, and scuff were all affected, to a lesser or greater extent, by the dye loading, capsule size, and
wall content, as well as their interactions, in one way or another.
If applied, color-former microcapsules were nearly solely responsible for sporadic or patterned discoloration
defects of pressure-sensitive and thermal paper. It was defined as the presence of image specks or background-
ing on the front side of CFs and CFBs off coaters or during rewinding or storage prior to printing. In either case,

Δ(scuff-sensitivity)
Capsule wall content, %
microcapsules break prematurely, and the free dye or color-forming solution migrates onto CF sheets, establish-
ing close contact with the color-developing agents, resulting in an imaged color. Large variations in microcapsule
sizes were assumingly one of the causes, as was the capsule wall (basically a cured coating film) with weak sol-
vent retention or poor impermeability. For instance, vegetable oils (predominantly triglycerides, categorized as
fatty acid esters, typically exhibiting a small FTIR peak at 3,050 cm−1) with poor dye solubility were more likely
to induce post-coating and/or pre-printing discoloration if used as solvents for the same color-former microcap-
sules. Particularly, as a user-defined parameter, 𝛥(scuff-sensitivity) was determined to be linearly inverse to the
wall content, as illustrated by the graph in Table 8.6. The greater the 𝛥(scuff-sensitivity), the less likely it was for
backgrounding to occur. It was surprising but evident that a higher wall content was more likely to cause spotting,
as spots appeared anytime the wall content was at a high level (except for #6, which was straight at the low levels
of all variables) (Tables 8.3/8.4). As previously mentioned, backgrounding was an imaging defect that was largely
independent of spotting; SCT-b* turned out to be a robust indicator of backgrounding. If the wall content was
appropriately optimized, both backgrounding and spots almost always disappeared.

8 Microencapsulation
For clarification on Figure 8.7, the top CBs are C1S (coated one side) with microcapsules coated on the backside
using a roll coater, the middle CFBs are C2S (coated two sides) with developer coated on the front side using a
blade coater and microcapsules coated on the back, and the bottom CFs are C1S with also developer coated on
the front. Activated clay such as Copisil N210, phenolic resins such as Durez 33446, and zinc salicylate (ZS) resins
such as HRJ-14508 (supplied by SI Group) are the three major types of color developers, which are typically acidic
compounds in nature. All CFs will display a permanent color change or imaging upon application of an active
pressure that ruptures microcapsules to release color-formers in oil/solvents. Typically, color-formers are non-
ionic chromogenic materials (e.g., phthalide, fluoran, and triphenylmethane) that readily react with developers to
generate images via ring-opening reactions. Referring to Appendix for coating formulations, stilt particles of an
averaged particle size of 25–30 μm, that is, 2–5 times larger than microcapsules, are preferably uncooked starches
(e.g., Accu-GelTM) incorporated into the CB coating at about 30% (by weight) of the microcapsules of 100% solids
along with latex (e.g., CP 620NA) and cooked starch as the co-binders under an anionic condition (e.g., pH ∼8.5,
adjusted by ammonia).
Microencapsulation, comprising active intermediates or constituents, is a microscopic and precise coating tech-
nique dynamically implemented on conformal and soft “substrates.” Referring back to the hybrid epoxy-acrylate
formulation (Figure 8.6 and Table 8.4), microcapsules based on the polyurea chemistry of isocyanates reacting
with amines at a much faster cure speed can also be readily developed if a properly selected or suited isocyanate
precursor, either MDI monomers or prepolymers, is added to the oil phase in place of the resin package of epox-
ies and acrylates. For example, there is a publication on polyurea-microencapsulated latent catalysts [19]. Several
technical considerations should be made when implementing polyurea microcapsules or the like, including: i)
the molar ratio of isocyanates (in the oil phase) to amines or alternatively polyamines (in the aqueous phase) is
still preferably greater than one, subject to optimization, ii) isocyanate monomers or prepolymers should be cho-
sen to be as tolerable and water-compatible as possible, iii) amines and polyamines and amine chain extenders
(if present) or combinations in the water phase should be chosen to be responsive to the intended isocyanates,
but not necessarily the same as those employed in epoxy systems, and iv) the presence of surfactant emulsifiers
is optional. In addition, polyurea chemistry provides the advantages of a faster cure or a low-temperature cure;
processing parameters, such as emulsifying shear speed, and post-cure duration, should be tweaked accordingly.
Debrief A Melamine and amino derivative crosslinkers
Amino resins and their derivatives are extensively used to crosslink epoxy, polyester, acrylic, and alkyd resins in
order to achieve the required balance of flexibility, durability, chemical resistance, and film toughness. As summa-
rized in Table 8.7, a wide range of commercial amino-resin crosslinkers, such as melamine, urea, and derivatives,
are currently available for applications in thermoset coatings, adhesives, and inks, such as for OEMs (original
equipment manufacturers), automotive, kitchen cabinets, general metals, including food and beverage packag-
ing, coils, and electronics. HMMM and its derivatives are effective crosslinking agents for −SH, −OH, −CO-NH−,
−COOH, and −O-CO-NH2 (carbamates), typically exhibiting EW values between 130 g/eq and 180 g/eq under
strong acid catalysts and being bakeable at temperatures between 125 ∘C and 150 ∘C. Amino crosslinkers are
chosen based on their end-use applications, whereas acid catalysts are chosen based on their compatibility with
crosslinkers; both of these steps are crucial to obtaining robust formulation and final performance specifications.
On the one hand, as shown in Table 8.7, fully methylated (i.e., generally HS) amino resins, including HMMM,
require strong acid catalysts, as do fully alkylated (i.e., HS mixed ethers), highly butylated (i.e., low-to-medium
solids), benzoganamines, UF resins, and glycolurils. On the other hand, highly methylated (i.e., high imino) amino
resins, partially methylated (i.e., polymeric), and phenolic grades require only weak acids such as phosphates as
a catalyst. A general acid mechanism and a specific acid mechanism are responsible for the catalysis of various
amino resins [20]. Understanding the catalytic mechanism of amino resins is necessary for predicting the behavior
of a crosslinker in complex paint or coating systems. The most notable advantages and disadvantages of UF resins

are their quickest cure speed, low cost, and poor moisture resistance, respectively. Butylated UF resins are suitable
for use as bake enamels. The chemical resistance of phenolic resins makes them ideal for can coatings and drum
linings. Partially methylated or alkylated amino resins readily self-condense as well; however, they are limited
by high formaldehyde release during baking due to the presence of free methylol (−CH2OH). Benzoguanamine
resins have fast curing responses, are resistant to detergent, adhere well to metal, and are resistant to corrosion.
Methylated and butylated grades with high solids make up the majority of urea resins. Methylated urea resins are
compatible with both WB and SB for interior or non-UV-resistant applications. Alkylation improves compatibility,
stability, flow, and leveling, but results in a slower cure, requiring no acid for very low temperature cure (e.g., 70 ∘C)
systems such as wood finishes. For rapid cure, therefore, a 2K formulation with an acid added prior to application
is required. Butylated urea resins, such as Cymel U-80, are similar to methylated except that n-butanol is used for
alkylation; they are very hydrophobic and stable (i.e., they cure more slowly than methylated); they require strong
acids to bake at 125 ∘C; and they are also recommended for interior and SB systems. In addition, butylated urea
resins can be categorized as n-butylated and iso-butylated. The former (i.e., partially n-butylated and polymeric,
no acid requirement, EW 220–300) is primarily intended for 2K interior wood and container applications cured at
< 70 ∘C with acid added prior to use, whereas the latter (i.e., iso-butylated urea) cures faster, similar to polymeric
n-butylated except that they are iso-butylated.
Similar to UF, MF, and UMF microencapsulation, 2K liquid melamine-crosslinked coatings of OH-, COOH-,
and CONH-functional resins are used extensively for wood, automotive, coil, can, and general industrial finishes.
King Industries’ Nacure® line is one example of typical acid catalysts for such capable systems. Notably, as illus-
trated in Figure 8.8c, furfuryl alcohol (i.e., FFA), an additive or contaminant in numerous foods generated during
food processing, readily self-condenses in the presence of an acid catalyst (such as p-TSA) in a chemically similar
manner to melamine. FFAs, which are derived from furfural (Figure 8.8b) via hydrogenation and are frequently
used in conjunction with liquid phenol resins to improve their wetting properties and compatibility.
Concerning free formaldehyde (HCHO) concerns, a number of commercial grades claiming to be free of
monomeric HCHO are available, including Cymel NF 2000, Cymel NF 3041 (partially n-butylated), and Cymel
NF 3030, amongst others. Cymel NF 2000 crosslinks OH-functional resins (e.g., Duroftal PE 6163/66SNABG, a
slightly branched, oil-free, and saturated polyester) optionally in the absence of acids and at temperatures greater

344

than 125 ∘C for automotive topcoat, exterior can, and coil applications; it also crosslinks COOH-functional resins
at temperatures above 150 ∘C. Cymel NF 3041 reacts with primary OHs for 2K ambient or heat cure on wood and
plastic substrates; Cymel NF 3030 cures Viacryl SC-6834W/42WA as a 2K WB coating in ambient conditions.
Debrief B Urea-glyoxal resins and derivatives
Glyoxal (OCH-CHO, a crystalline solid, MW 58.0, EW 29.0 g/eq) and urea-glyoxal (UG) resins and their deriva-
tives have increasingly gained industrial interest, notably for wood adhesives, due to the absence of HCHO in
their compositions and the advantages of water resistance and adhesion. Glyoxal (white at low temperatures
and yellow around the melting point or liquid) is the smallest dialdehyde (two aldehyde groups) that is highly
soluble in water and reactive with urea to form UG resins or polymers, analogous to HCHO and UF resins, as
depicted in Figure 8.8a. Urea and glyoxal are capable of undergoing film-forming reactions at low temperatures.
As reported by Deng et al. and Cao et al. [21, 22], UG and HUG (i.e., urea-hexamethylenediamine-glyoxal) resins
exhibit excellent adhesion and water resistance as crosslinkers to replace UF resins (i.e., amino resins such as
HMMM) in HCHO-free wood, plywood, and foil bonding adhesives. In addition, lignocellulosic materials may
greatly contribute to the development of eco-friendly wood adhesives; glyoxal-phenolic resins for plywood utiliz-
ing organosolv lignin have been reported by Hussin et al. [23].
Notably, and in comparison, benzaldehyde crosslinks vinyl esters in the presence of an acid catalyst (refer to
Figure 3.11c in Chapter 3), and it is film-forming and HCHO-free as a coating, meaning that it is capable of fabri-
cating a viable microcapsule via an in-situ polymerization, subject to validation, but with both benzaldehyde and
vinyl esters dissolved in the oil phase alongside a hydrophobic acid catalyst (e.g., DNNSA; refer to Table 8.7) in place
of the hydrophilic HCl metering added in Figure 8.4. Furfural (Figure 8.8b) devoid of HCHO can react with urea
but is less reactive than formaldehyde [24]. Furthermore, furfural is structurally conjugated (Figure 8.8b), there-
fore it can react with vinyl esters comparable to benzaldehyde, including HCHO-free microcapsule fabrication by
in-situ polymerization if necessary.
Debrief C Michael Addition reactions and applications
Widely used in coating applications, including microcapsules, Michael Addition reactions are originally referred to
as vinyl (electron-deficit or a hydrogen acceptor)-functional acrylates reacting with primary or secondary amines
(electron-surplus or hydrogen donors) to form films, as re-illustrated in Figure 8.5a (also refer to Figure 3.9 in
Chapter 3). Common e−-donating groups generally follow the order of −C(CH3)3 > −CH(CH3)2 > −CH2CH3 >
−CH3 > −H, whereas common e−-withdrawing groups follow the order of −NO2 > −CN > −F > −Cl > −Br >
−I > C≡C > −OCH3 > −OH > −C6H5 > C=C > −H. In modified Michael Addition reactions, acidic malonate
and acetoacetate resins are utilized as precursors of electron donors rather than amines (refer to Figures 4.1b/d
in Chapter 4), which become activated under a strong base catalyst, as re-depicted in Figure 8.9a. As a result,
many unsaturated compounds, such as styrene (i.e., one of the aromatic C9’s), DCPD (i.e., one of the aliphatic
C5’s), polybutadiene or PBD, polyisoprene, etc., can be compatibly incorporated to improve the bulk adhesion,
cohesion, toughness, and flexibility of such coating systems. Similar to epoxies, Michael Addition chemistry is
applicable for adhesion to a variety of substrates. As represented by Nuplex/Allnex’s ACURE technology, it is
increasingly utilized in formulations of 2K liquid coatings for wood, floor, concrete, automotive, including lam-
ination adhesives [25], and other industrial applications preferentially free of isocyanates and/or non-isocyanate
polyurethanes (a.k.a., NISO and/or NIPU). Notably, ACURE systems cure very fast at ambient temperature (such
as with unblocked catalysts) and are highly competitive with a free-radical vinyl route, such as methyl-substituted
benzoyl peroxide, or MBPO [26]. Acure 500-300 (99.5% active, EW 175), a malonate-functional polyester as an
electron donor, Acure 500-100 (85% active, EW 210), a tri-functional acrylate as an electron acceptor, and Acure

extending the open time of Michael Addition reactions.
500, a strong base catalyst, are all liquid resins commercially available for 2K SB coatings. Other acrylate resins
that serve as hydrogen acceptors include Acure 550–100 (tri-functional TMPTA, EW 98.8) and Acure 550-105
(tetra-functional DiTMPTA, EW 116), among others. In addition, Ebecryl 7100, an acrylate-functional amine resin
that donates hydrogens and has a rapid UV/EB cure response, is intended for good adhesion to wood and plas-
tics such as treated PE, ABS, PC, and polyphenylene oxide (PPO). Omnirad 819 (Tm 130 ∘C) from IGM (www
.igmresins.com) is an effective photo-initiator or additive for UV-LED formulations, as required for energy cure
applications.
Additives of varying basicity were developed and are applicable to ACURE formulations for controlling or
adjusting reaction rates and open times, preferably in conjunction with blocked catalysts. These additives include
malonate (pKa 13.0), ethyl acetoacetonate (pKa 10.7), 1,2,4-triazole (pKa 10.2), succinimide (pKa 9.5, Figure 8.9b),
1H-benzotriazole (i.e., BTA, pKa 8.5), and so on. Regarding applied formulations and real-world applications,
a fast cure 2K SB formulation with VOCs less than 100 g/l is optionally comprised of Acure 500-302 (99.6% active,
malonate, EW 154) for improved durability and hardness, in addition to Acure 500-100 (acrylate) and −300
(malonate), which are intended for alkaline and porous concrete surfaces. Concerning ACURE-driven wood
paints, in one aspect, a very fast cure and short open time can be achieved by using unblocked catalyst regardless
of acrylic content, a fast cure but a longer open time can be achieved by recruiting a package of a blocked catalyst
combined with triazole and succinimide when the acrylic content is under 5%, and a very fast cure but an even
longer open time can be achieved by employing a blocked catalyst and 1,2,4-triazole when the acrylic content is
under 10%. In another aspect, a slower cure and an open time that increases and levels off proportionally with
the acrylic content can be formulated using an appropriately chosen blocked catalyst, while a very slow cure and
an extended open time when the acrylic content is low (5–10%) can be formulated utilizing a blocked catalyst and
succinimide, which allow the cure speed to accelerate when the acrylic content increases. In addition to prevalent
polyurethane, nitrocellulose, melamine-acid catalysts, acrylic, low-VOC solvent-borne (SB), and 1/2K water-borne
(WB) formulations, Guardian and Michael Addition are regarded as leading chemistries for industrial wood
coatings.
Notably, Allnex has developed Cyrez 400 (HMMM at ∼72% active by weight), a silica-encapsulated HMMM
powder resin. For either formulation of Cyrez 400 and Rucote 102 (hydroxyl value 40 or EW-OH 1,402.5) or Cyrez
400 and Crylcoat E 04712 (acid number 100 or EW-COOH ∼555.4) at a formulation index of 1.05 each (i.e., a molar
ratio of the OH- or COOH-functional polyester resin to HMMM in Cyrez 400), however, no cure was detected by
DSC or observed by physical post-cure oven testing, regardless of low or high cure temperatures. Still notably,
Allnex has also developed a Michael Addition powder technology [27] that can cure at low temperatures between
80 ∘C and 120 ∘C for heat-sensitive substrates including MDFs, wood, plastics, and alloys (refer to Table 6.28 in
Chapter 6).

8 Microencapsulation
Debrief D Microencapsulation via interfacial polymerization
Prepolymers and crosslinkers for constructing the capsule wall are required in interfacial polymerization for pro-
ducing microcapsules, while appropriate surfactants are also required in most formulations, if not all. These two
sets of chemical components must be compatibly incorporated into both or either of the water and oil phases, as
shown in the process flow charts in Figure 8.10, where surfactants are selected for establishing a robust oil-in-water
(O/W) or water-in-oil (W/O) interface. Additionally, a physical or mechanical processing condition, such as high
shear emulsification or homogenization, is necessary for microencapsulation by interfacial polymerization.
The process of interfacial polymerization is robustly scalable, requiring at least four holding tanks with agita-
tion capacity in an industrial setting. For instance, Tank 1 is to dispense an oil phase containing active ingredients
(such as color-formers) and reactive monomers, oligomers/resins, or prepolymers; Tank 2 is to prepare and hold
an aqueous phase made up of an anionic surfactant (hydrophilic) that serves as the emulsifier for an O/W system
(Figure 8.10a) and any remaining reactive wall components (such as amines); and Tank 3 is to receive, create, and
homogenize a mixture of the oil and aqueous phases. The oil/solvent phase (including therein-dissolved active
ingredients as the payload) from Tank 3 is continuously mixed and micro-emulsified as micro-oil droplets in a
continuous aqueous phase as it is transferred to Tank 4, where interfacial polymerization takes place while curing

and an O/W microcapsule dispersion is produced. After emulsification by vigorous agitation or high shear mixing
(for example, using a homogenizer), the reactants diffuse to meet at the oil-water interfaces, where they undergo
spontaneous and induced polymerization to form the microcapsule wall layer. The wall layer is structurally made
of a crosslinked polymer network that entraps the oil phase as the core or payload. In comparison to phase sep-
aration coacervation and in-situ emulsification techniques, interfacial polymerization can give tight capsule size
control (e.g., smaller in size and narrower in size distribution), although it may exhibit certain fill solvent con-
straints. It is always preferred to have uniformly sized microcapsules. Instead, Figure 8.10b describes analogous
processes for producing a W/O microcapsule dispersion in which an oil-compatible surfactant (hydrophobic) is
suitably incorporated in the oil phase.
In one aspect, microencapsulation technologies such as in-situ and interfacial polymerizations, which rely on
dynamically controllable processing and curing reactions, require an effective capsule wall or shell chemistry.
Table 8.8 lists the main economically feasible wall polymer chemistries, most of which can be produced batchwise
and continuously, including the previously discussed UF and hybrid epoxy-acrylate capsules. A polyurea wall is
tough but has a reduced crosslinking density and only low-to-modest solvent retention ability, whereas a UF wall
is rigid, has a high crosslinking density, and has great solvent retention. A polyurethane (PUR) wall’s tendency to
develop microcapsule agglomerations is a practical concern. MF capsules (such as produced by Lipo Technologies)
have a sweet smell, are tough, strong, and have a greater payload capacity. UF, PUR, and UMF microcapsules
are cost-effective alternatives. Following emulsification, guanidine carbonate and DETA as the crosslinkers are
slowly admixed (by a meter), allowing the removal of surfactants from the polyurea (PUA) microencapsulation, as
disclosed [28]. If a high-shear homogenizer rather than a propeller mixer is used, interfacial polymerization can
produce polyurea capsules that are rather robust in terms of controlling the capsule size and size distribution.
In another aspect, an efficient surfactant or mixture of surfactants is sometimes essential for interfacial polymer-
ization. In emulsion technology, Bancroft’s Rule asserts that water-soluble emulsifiers produce O/W emulsions,
whereas oil-soluble emulsifiers produce W/O emulsions, which are of the greatest interest to the food industry.
Accordingly, hydrophilic (i.e., water-soluble) surfactants, preferably anionic, are common emulsifying agents to
be dissolved in the water phase of an interfacial polymerization process for O/W microcapsules, as are lipophilic
(oil-soluble) surfactants, typically nonionic, to be dissolved in the oil phase for W/O microcapsules, as delicately
depicted in Figure 8.10, where these two types of surfactants assemble at oil-water interfaces in their own pattern.
In O/W systems with a continuous aqueous phase and a discontinuous oil phase, anionic surfactant emulsifiers not

8 Microencapsulation
only facilitate the formation of micro-oil droplets (i.e., precursors of microcapsules), but they also impart primarily
electro-repulsive and additionally steric forces that aid microcapsule dispersibility and stability overtime. These
surfactants satisfy two conditions to be effective emulsifiers: first, they reduce the oil-water interfacial tension,
and second, they diffuse rapidly to the newly formed interfaces surrounding oil droplets (preventing them from
re-convergence). Surfactants’ ability to migrate quickly is essential for both O/W and W/O emulsifications. As a
result, low-molecular-weight surfactants are superior in micro-emulsions, and polymeric surfactants are typically
undesirable since they cannot diffuse to interfaces rapidly. It is believed that novel polyol surfactants, such as alkyl
glucosides, have a high propensity to remain at oil-water interfaces due to their highly strong hydrophilic hydroxyl
groups and hydrophobic hydrocarbon chains. Surfactants with moderately long aliphatic hydrocarbon chains as
tails are best suited for preparing O/W micro-emulsions; however, those with excessively branched hydrophobic
tails should be avoided. Sodium 2-hexyldecylsulfate has very low solubility in both oil and water, allowing it to be
best confined to the oil-water interfaces; alkylphenol ethoxylates are believed to pack more efficiently than linear
fatty alcohol ethoxylates at interfaces and are therefore good emulsifiers; linear alcohol ethoxylates with the vol-
ume of hydrocarbon tails smaller than that of the polar head groups are typically used for O/W systems. By far,
sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and similar surfactants, such as Tamol SN (refer to Figure 8.5b), indicative of the
sulfonate type, are the most commonly used anionic surfactants for O/W emulsifications.
On the other hand, nonionic surfactants with HLB values ranging from 8 to 14 are good O/W emulsifiers, such
as Triton X-100 (HLB 9.5) and Tween 80 (i.e., poyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate, HLB 15.0), whereas those
with HLB values ranging from 3 to 6 are good W/O emulsifiers, such as Span 80 (i.e., sorbitan monooleate, HLB
4.3) and amphipathic lecithin (HLB 3–5). In most cases, a nonionic emulsifier or mixture with an overall HLB
value equivalent to that of the phase to be emulsified is preferred. Notably, polyoxyethylene, that is, (CH2CH2O)n
or poly-EO, is water-soluble among polyoxyalkylenes, but olyoxymethylene, that is, (CH2O)n, is water-insoluble
despite having a higher oxygen content. Shorter EO chains improve the oil solubility of a surfactant; during
micro-emulsification, the hydrophobic fraction of emulsifier molecules will preferentially partition into the oil
phase, whereas the fraction with long EO chains will dissolve to a greater extent in the aqueous phase. Poly-EO
nonionic emulsifiers produce O/W emulsions at ambient conditions but spontaneously transform into W/O at ele-
vated temperatures. Therefore, the stability of emulsions attributed to nonionic surfactants is strongly dependent
on temperature. Implementing interfacial polymerization-based microencapsulation requires primary considera-
tion of electrolytes in the aqueous phase, oil polarity, and the water-to-oil (or oil-to-water) ratio. If the oil phase is
more polar, the emulsifier(s) should be more hydrophilic, and vice versa. According to Bancroft’s rule, the addi-
tion of a polar, oil-soluble organic molecule increases the polarity of the oil phase, which in turn increases the oil
solubility of the surfactant in favor of a W/O emulsion. According to another rule, the critical packing parameter
(CPP) is slightly below unity (< 1) for an O/W fluid and above one for a W/O system [29]. Emulsifiers with large
CPP values, such as twin-tailed surfactants, favor W/O emulsions because they require more space on the oil side;
surfactants with large head groups, on the other hand, have the opposite CPP requirement and hence favor O/W
emulsions.
Particularly, and for clarification, when considering the capsule wall content and capsule size, two universal
parameters in chemical microencapsulation, at a given capsule wall material’s loading level (a constant total vol-
ume) in the formulation of, for example, an interfacial polymerization, the larger the capsule size (hence the
smaller the total surface area), the thicker the capsule wall (due to a constant total volume), which oppose each
other in release performance. As a result, there may always exist an optimal capsule size for optimal performance.
Lastly, adjusting the density of the formulated oil phase to be close to that of the paired aqueous phase enables
the mixture to be emulsified, dispersed, and stabilized with greater ease. This explains why salts are added to the
UF capsules’ water phase (refer to Figure 8.4). Electrostatic stabilization of emulsions using anionic surfactants is
a popular technique, whereas steric stabilization can be attained by nonionic surfactants with long EO chains serv-
ing as the polar heads. On hydrophobic surfaces, nonionic surfactants adsorb more strongly than anionic ones (e.g.,

Recaps and Highlights
349
SDS). Consequently, mixes of anionic and nonionic surfactants are most likely the optimal emulsifiers in microen-
capsulation of interfacial polymerization due to a synergistic effect provided by electrostatic and steric repulsion
between particles, subject to experimental validation. This combination, for instance, an alcohol ethoxylate and
SDS is referred to as electro-steric stabilization. PVAs (polyvinyl alcohols) are a preferred colloidal stabilizer for
microcapsule slurry systems, acting similarly to a nonionic surfactant; they should be partially hydrolyzed, of low
molecular weight, and adequately loaded (such as up to 4.0% by weight in the water phase; refer to Figure 8.6).
Recaps and Highlights
Microcapsules are thermodynamically ordered (entropy 𝛥S < 0) systems with a micro-spherical and/or core/shell
morphological structure that serve as temporary protection and controlled release vehicles. Microencapsulation
of an active payload protected by a wall or shell can be accomplished physically by means of atomization, fluid
bed coating, and others, such as a representative silica carrier, or chemically by means of solvent evaporation,
phase separation coacervation, in-situ polymerization, and interfacial polymerization, which are representative
of emulsification-based techniques. UF/UMF/MF microcapsule wall chemistries and processes are fundamen-
tally analogous, fast curing, and characteristic of in-situ condensation in that all reactive and water-soluble wall
ingredients are incorporated with additives in the aqueous phase; condensation reactions are deferred until an acid
catalyst is slowly charged upon high-shear mixing the discontinuous oil phase into the continuous water phase
(also regarded as dynamic phase separation). Active intermediates or components with functional groups (e.g.,
pheromones having unsaturated C=C bonds or vinyl in their structures) are more compatible and implementable
using such applied microencapsulation techniques. Hybrid epoxy-acrylate (coupled by amine-driven Michael
Addition reactions) shell technologies are more representative of interfacial polymerization because oil-soluble
(bulk resins) and water-soluble (amine crosslinkers and catalysts) reactants are unloaded into the oil and water
phases, respectively; microcapsules are not strongly produced until, preferably, a surfactant-driven emulsification
takes place and the polymeric shell layers are reinforced. The chemistry of polyurea microcapsule walls follows
a similar process, with the exception that a surfactant can be eliminated when amine crosslinkers are admixed
slowly. Polymeric wall content governed by the formulation index and capsule size are perhaps two of the most
critical parameters for the production of robust microcapsules, which only work as intended in end applications
(such as coatings) with open or mobile interfaces and not confined or closed surfaces.
Melamine essentially belongs to multi-functional amines, which are a considerable extension of generic amines
and are categorized as amino resins. Melamine and its derivatives and phenolics are thermosetting materials
that compete in performance and applications, as are MF and PF polymers (as addressed in Chapter 7) with
comparable and dissimilar mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties. Melamine-modified phenolics are
co-condensation products generated under an alkaline condition (pH 7.0 to 9.0). Free of isocyanates (i.e., NISO),
the chemistry of melamine and acid catalysts is functionally versatile but complex in terms of formulation
validation for a specific application, emphasizing structure-performance relationships and being driven by
them. Specifically, it may require a great deal of trials and errors to properly select a matrix of amino resin or
HMMM derivative crosslinkers, suitable catalysts, and bulk resins with OH- or COOH-functionality or the like in
terms of a desired cure speed, adhesion, toughness, flexibility, durability, and weatherability, depending on end
applications such as coatings, adhesives, varnishes and inks, and molding compounds. Notably, a hybrid coating
comprising benzoxazine, phthalonitrile, and melamine in the absence of silicones has been investigated to enjoy
super high dual Tgs (both greater than 240 ∘C) and is aimed at highly demanding heat-resistant applications.
This coating will be disclosed in the next chapter of hybrids and non-epoxy platforms (refer to Figure 9.17b in
Chapter 9). Glyoxal, furfural, and their derivatives, including bio-lignin modifications, which are film-forming
and devoid of HCHO, should be regarded as attractive alternatives for industrial applications, particularly wood
and automotive purposes.

8 Microencapsulation
Michael Addition reactions are versatile with low cure capacity, NISO, and highly practical in enriching and
advancing applied coating technologies, from amines to malonates or acetoacetates or the like, from automotive
to wood, from flooring to concrete, from general metal to plastics, and they continue to expand on both ends of raw
materials and end-use applications, including from 2K to UV/EB liquids to powders. Predictably, Michael Addi-
tion chemistry remains to be extended to include a wider variety of functional thermoplastics and thermosets, such
as styrene, PBD, BMIs, cyclic-vinyl-functional Nadic esters, and analogues as co-binders for even greater perspec-
tives of existing and emerging applications that seek enhanced performance in adhesion, cure speed, flexibility,
toughness, and durability, among others. Scale-up considerations for intended O/W and W/O microencapsulating
implementation involve a substantial emphasis on polymer chemistry robustness and, if desired, surfactant selec-
tion suitability. Characterization of microcapsules as a product and performance evaluation of microcapsules as
a functional component of heterogeneous coatings and adhesives for end-user applications are both essential for
short-term optimization and long-term sustainability, respectively.
Cross-disciplinarily, it has been reported that nano-structured encapsulation of polyisocyanates (core) and
acrylic polyols (shell) with core/shell morphology ensures homogeneous dispersion and VOC reduction of
waterborne clearcoats, resulting in high gloss film formation via water evaporation at 80 ∘C and coalescence
at 150 ∘C and subsequent curing [30]. To end by returning to pheromones for insect pest management, they
typically have one C=C bond in a hydrocarbon chain (for example, 4-vinylanisole [31]) and are soluble in
ethers, esters, and vegetable oils that can be employed as solvents. Physical semi-encapsulation utilizing a silica
carrier would be first considered for converting pheromones into a free-flowing powder due to its low cost
and ease of use, as proposed. Then, and chemically, in-situ urea-glyoxal, interfacial epoxy, or polyurea systems
could be evaluated for making pheromone-cored microcapsules in an aqueous slurry; nevertheless, the final
effectiveness of encapsulated pheromones must be validated for epoxy and polyurea chemistry since the unsat-
urated C=C bond from pheromones readily reacts with amines (present in both systems) via Michael Addition
reactions.

Hybrids and Non-Epoxy Platforms
In one sense, and for clarification, the term “hybrid” refers to not only a heterogenous system of epoxies dif-
fering from their self-crosslinking, but also a dual- or three-fold combination of epoxy and other major coating
chemistries such as polyurethane, acrylic, polyester, silicone, and perhaps further of significance like benzoxazine
(BOX, produced from reactions between BPA and amines and formaldehyde), BMI, phthalonitrile (PN), and so
forth, for niche properties and applications. In another sense, and as their names imply, non-epoxy platforms
refer to coating chemistries and formulations in which epoxy is no longer a bulk component or additive ingredi-
ent, including primarily polyurethanes (PURs) and polyureas (PUAs), silicones or siloxanes, acrylics, polyesters,
melamine and modifications, and phenolics, individually and in combination (i.e., non-epoxy hybrids).
When it comes to applied coatings and similar materials, hybrid formulations are often, if not always, a plau-
sible strategy for extracting synergies from coupled chemistries or technologies. For example, DAP, an adhesive
and sealant manufacturer, has developed a new line of wet-surface applicable hybrid silicone-polyurethane (also
known as advanced modified polymer or AMP) sealants that outperform traditional silicones and provide maxi-
mum performance in weatherability and durability for challenging projects, as disclosed on online resources [1]
to fast cure (30 min) in extreme temperatures ranging from 0 to 140 ∘F (for sealants) and prevent mold and mildew
growth for both interior and exterior applications. Hybrids may originate or develop differently, and as another
illustration, phosphorus epoxy resins cured by melamine-modified phenolic resins or by BOXs have better thermal
and flame-retardant properties. An example of a green formulation would be a 2K hybrid NIPU coating composed
of polycyclic carbonates and epoxy oligomers in Part A and an aliphatic or cycloaliphatic polyamine with 1∘amino
groups in the presence of a hydroxyl-urethane modifier in Part B.

Epoxy Hybrids
9.1.1
Epoxy-isocyanate systems
Epoxy-isocyanate hybrids are already widely used in industrial resins and coatings, including upstream
high-performance isocyanate-modified epoxy resins as previously discussed (refer to Figure 1.5 in Chapter 1),
such as Shin-A T&C’s SEY-5310 and Olin’s FortegraTM 310, as well as downstream epoxy-urethane coatings with
and without isocyanate incorporated in a solvent-borne (SB) or waterborne (WB) version, as reported by Pilawka
et al., Wazarkar et al., and Zhang et al. [2–4].
A compositional formulation of an applied hybrid epoxy-isocyanate powder coating for household white appli-
ance (e.g., Whirlpool’s washing machines and dryers) applications needing long-term detergent chemical resis-
tance is described and illustrated in Table 9.1. From formulation and structure-property relationship viewpoints, a
high MW epoxy resin (i.e., Type 7’s KER 7007 from Kumho PB Chemicals, analogous to Kukdo’s or Aditya Birla’s
Epokukdo YD-017, Nan Ya’s NPES 907, Olin’s DER 667E, and Hexion/Westlake’s EPON 1007F) with both epoxides

and aliphatic secondary-hydroxyls (OHs) serves as one of the two bulk resins and is paired with an e-capped iso-
cyanate (i.e., Vestagon B 1400 of an unblocking temperature > 160 ∘C) as the crosslinker under a slight organotin
catalysis, that is, at approximately 0.333 phr. Upon activation by thermal unblocking, the major curing reactions
are presumably two-fold, occurring between epoxides and NCOs (refer to Figure 1.5 in Chapter 1) and between
the aliphatic secondary-OH groups and NCOs (refer to Figure 2.11 in Chapter 2), with a formulation index (FI)
of 0.343 (epoxy in deficit) or 2.572 (epoxy in surplus) if the aliphatic secondary-OH groups are accounted for.
DSC revealed a negligible amount of exotherms, 𝛥H (enthalpy) = −9.64 J/mol, and Tg = 83.2 ∘C (lower than stan-
dard FBEs but greatly higher than regular polyesters or polyurethanes), consistent mostly with the formation of
urethane linkages between −OH and −NCO groups and the expectedly low crosslinking density. In other words,
the majority of epoxide functionalities may remain unreacted during the post-cure process at 190.6 ∘C for at least
15 min. This formulation was determined to have a kinetic Ea value as high as 54.0 kJ/mol and a reaction order n
as high as 2.40, indicating high latency and an extended cure time at a given cure temperature (or a higher cure
temperature for a given cure time) required to achieve an adequate cure level (such as > 90%). The formulation is
highly pigmented or filled with TiO2 to maintain the intended white color.
Although the product might perform well in terms of long-lasting chemical resistance (such as against laundry
detergents) from the perspectives of customers and end users, the contingent formulation could be improved in
the following ways: i) to optimize the isocyanate loading level or decrease the combined FI appropriately; ii) to
tune the cure temperature (without necessarily adhering to 375 ∘F) for maximum crosslinking density and bulk
toughness; iii) to increase the organotin catalyst loading level for cure acceleration and crosslinking density
increase; iv) to preferably introduce a tertiary amine (such as an imidazole) as a compatible co-catalyst for promot-
ing epoxide self-crosslinking (refer to Figure 3.2b in Chapter 3) to further increase crosslinking density and Tg for
stronger chemical-resistant performance, complementing existing urethane reactions; v) to optionally substitute
DABCO T-120 (in a liquid form that is difficult-to-disperse in powders) with TBAB (i.e., tetrabutylammonium
bromide, Tm 103 ∘C, Actylis) or Butaflow BT-71 (70% active free-flowing powder, Estron Chemical) at 2.93 pbw

(parts by weight) for improved homogenization, subject to validation; and vi) to optimize the formulation index
of 2.183 in terms of desired gel and cure times in the presence of a tin catalyst and an imidazole co-catalyst.
9.1.2
Epoxy-urethane/urea systems
Epoxy-urethane/urea hybrid or epoxy-urethane systems with high flexibility (serving as, for example, molding
compounds) can be formulated by combining a linear or branched urethane polymer with an epoxy resin to
be co-cured by a cycloaliphatic diamine for an application period of four hours and a drying cycle of approxi-
mately 17 hours at room temperature. A suitable urethane polymer is, for instance, Covestro’s branched Desmocap
11A (∼2.4% blocked NCO content, 100% solids), which is devoid of free isocyanate groups and inert to water
or OH-containing compounds. Figure 9.1 depicts the curing mechanisms, which involve polyaddition reactions
between epoxies and amines and polycondensation reactions between the urethane polymer and amines that
generate elastomeric segments with both urea and urethane linkages (resulting in a Tg of about −35 ∘C if 100%
Desmocap 11A is cured with 3, 3’-dimethyl-4, 4’-diaminodicycohexyl methane, i.e., Baxxodur® EC 331); the urea
and urethane functions reduce the high elastic modulus and brittleness of epoxy-amine linkages. Laromin® C 260,
a substitute for Baxxodur® EC 331, is a suitable amine, and Levepox K10 or Desmorapid T.P.L-2318 (i.e., DMP-30)
is a suitable catalyst for greatly accelerating condensation reactions; polyaddition can be accelerated by heating.
The optimum balance between mechanical properties (shear modulus, abrasion, tensile strength, and elongation)
and chemical resistance is attained with an epoxy-to-Desmocap 11A weight ratio ranging from 35/65 to 50/50.
Still advantageously, adhesion on sand-blasted iron according to ASTM D4541 can be increased by up to 2.5 times
by introducing Desmocap 11A at 40–50% of total resin parts by weight in addition to cold cure and subsequent
ambient aging [5].
9.1.3
Epoxy-acrylate/BMI systems
Epoxy-acrylate hybrids are increasingly utilized in coating formulations and applications for enhanced adhe-
sion, cure responses, and other advantageous returns. For instance, in prior discussion regarding food packaging-
oriented can and coil coatings, epoxies and acrylates are purposefully consolidated into a synergic formulation in
which epoxide-functional resins are directly crosslinked by COOH-functional acrylic acids on the one hand and

the remaining vinyl-functional groups are activated, for example, via free-radicals or UV radiation [6] (also refer
to Subsection 2.2.2.2 of acrylates in Chapter 2), for film formation on the other hand. FTIR can qualitatively
identify the participation of acrylic acids in cure reactions, with C=O-associated signals moving from 1,707 cm−1
in the initial acrylic acid to 1,730–1,750 cm−1 in the resultant acrylic polymers. Hybrids of epoxies and acrylates
can be alternatively achieved by combining epoxy-amine co-polymerization and acrylate-amine Michael Addition
reactions in one-pot (such as powder coatings using high-melting-temperature amines) and 2K systems (such as
liquid coatings with acrylate co-binder resins and low-melting-temperature amines in Parts A and B, respectively;
refer to Table 6.2 in Chapter 6). Similar hybrids of epoxies and BMIs are achievable. Notably, primary and/or sec-
ondary amines are required as co-crosslinkers in the validation of such hybrid epoxy-acrylate/BMI formulations
(refer to Figure 8.5a in Chapter 8).
Interfacial microencapsulation has already highlighted an effective hybrid formulation of epoxies and acrylates
(refer to Figure 8.6 in Chapter 8). Therefore, the author proposes to proceed directly to epoxy-BMI hybrids using
applied FBE formulation examples (which are, of course, universally relevant to epoxy-acrylate systems), with
a focus on crosslinking pathways and structural performance of practical significance. These may be noticeably
analogous to or different from systems comprising two independent crosslinking reactions of epoxies cured by, for
example, an active ester and acrylates/BMIs cured by, for example, dicumyl peroxide in a blended formulation, as
patented for dielectric coatings with low dielectric constant and loss tangent properties [7]. Regardless, it is highly
beneficial to review complete BMI chemistry prior to case studies.
BMIs are typically mono- or bi-functional (or multi-functional if pre-polymerized) in terms of cyclic vinyl, which
is more reactive than the aliphatic vinyl found in the majority of acrylates (refer to Figure 7.10 in Chapter 7).
In one aspect, BMIs readily self-polymerize via free-radicals or alternatively via suitable catalysts, as depicted in
Tables 9.2a/b (also refer to Figure 7.11a in Chapter 7), respectively. In another aspect, BMIs rapidly co-polymerize
with amines (particularly aromatic amines such as 4,4-DDS), excluding tertiary amines, by Michael Addition or
with another vinyl-functional molecule giving a new C=C bond via ene-reactions, as reviewed by Chandran et al.
[8] and illustrated in Tables 9.2c/d, respectively. Notably, Michael Addition (with amines) and self-crosslinking of
BMIs can take place concurrently, as represented in Figure 9.2, where R and R’ can consist of highly aromatic side
groups, such as a fluorenyl cardo or phthalide cardo group [9, 10].
In addition, BMIs undergo Diels−Alder ring formation reactions with ortho-substituted phenolics (including
BOXs and derivatives), as previously discussed (refer to Figure 7.15 in Chapter 7). As coating ingredients, BMIs
are analogous to acrylates but probably more reactively latent (until activated) than acrylates; nonetheless, BMIs
have color issues, turning dark brown (like BOXs) when fully cured, therefore they are primarily limited to interior
applications. Evonik’s Compimide MAHD (EW-vinyl 138, Tm 136 ∘C; refer to Figure 7.4f in Chapter 7) is a BMI in
solid powder form that is difunctional, aliphatic (indicative of the hydrocarbon chain in between two hetero-N’s),
and structurally more flexible. Nippon Kayaku’s MIR-3000-70MT (EW-vinyl 275 for 100% resin; refer to Figure 7.4g
in Chapter 7) is a solvent-based material (requiring minimally 130 ∘C and preferably vacuum or freezing dry to
expel out solvents as necessary), difunctional, and aromatic, making it mechanically more rigid or stiff. In addition
to HOS-Technik’s Homide 116 (EW-vinyl 140.5, Tm 75–85 ∘C) and Homide 250 prepolymer (Tm 90–125 ∘C), other
commercial BMI sources include Daiwakasei Industry of Japan or DKK’s BMI-TMH, Designer Molecules’ and
Wako Pure Chemical Industries’ BMI-3000 (aromatic, EW-vinyl 1500, Tm 80 ∘C) and series, Caplinq’s BMI-6000
(carboxyimide and imine-functional), Solvay’s Cycom 5250-4, etc. As effective catalysts for PURs, siloxanes, and
cyanate esters, organometallic complexes (such as organotin and ZnAcAc) are validly applicable to BMIs in the
same manner. It may be reiterated that in hybrid or dual cure systems composed of active phenyl esters [7] (refer
to Subsection 6.2.5 of active ester crosslinkers in Chapter 6) and BMIs or acrylates, the catalyst for active esters
(such as tertiary amines) do not interfere with free-radicals if present.

Illustrated in Table 9.3 are the compositions and general properties of an epoxy-BMI hybrid powder formulation
free of any crosslinker for bulk epoxy and BMI resins. Inasmuch as 15% of the bulk epoxy resin is substituted by
BMIs, the formulation design can effectively be termed as a crosslinker-free FBE system (refer to Table 6.4 in
Chapter 6). Specifically, the epoxy and BMI co-binder resins are a mixture of EPON 2005 and Compimide MAHD
combined in a mass ratio of 85 to 15. Cure reactions in the absence of crosslinkers are undeniably governed by
epoxy homo-polymerization catalyzed primarily by Epikure P-101, an imidazole adduct (refer to Table 2.5f in
Chapter 2), at 2.646 phr of the epoxy resin, and concurrently by BMI self-crosslinking promoted by Cyphos IL
169, an onium salt (refer to Figure 7.11b in Chapter 7), heavily at 15.0 phr of the BMI resin. Separate cure paths and
cure advancements of such a one-pot formulation agree invariably with the DSC exothermic profile (Figure 9.3).
Specifically, the major exothermic peak at 114.5 ∘C is associated with epoxy etherification, while the adjacent
shoulder peak at 133.9 ∘C is driven by BMI self-polymerization that yields saturated hydrocarbon chains (refer to
Table 9.2b), resulting in a single Tg at 105.3 ∘C as well as an overall heat of reactions up to 90.8 J/g to be released
during the co-curing process.

Figure 9.3
DSC exothermic curves as conducted at 7.0 ∘C/min for the epoxy-BMI formulation without crosslinkers
(presented in Table 9.3).
In terms of properties and performance, the formulation (Table 9.3) maintained its fast gel and cure nature in
the presence of BMIs, as gel times were measured at 10.0/5.1/3.0 sec at 350/400/450 ∘F, which were consistent
with a low Ea of 44.55 kJ/mol and a low onset temperature of 96.3 ∘C, respectively. Substitution of partial epoxy
resins with BMIs, even at an extremely high catalyst loading (i.e., 15.0 phr), did not necessarily boost or speed
up cure completion, as indicated by the reaction order n that was actually extended to as high as 3.52; in other
words, the formulation enables a cure level of 90% to be reached in five min at 450 ∘F, but it would take more
than three hours to reach full cure (e.g., 𝛼= 99%) according to kinetic data. On the other hand, both flexibility and
impact-resistant toughness were poor for this particular unfilled formulation; that is, they were greatly impaired by
the incorporation of BMI self-curing, which is likely ascribed to BMI’s incompatibility with epoxies. HWA findings
at 75 and 95 ∘C for 28 days (Table 9.3, including the tested panel pictures) reveal excellent wet adhesion and at
least four times better film impermeability compared to conventional FBEs (refer to weight gains in Table 6.4 of
Chapter 6). Epoxy cure in contact with substrate surfaces at the bottom was largely responsible for adhesion, while
BMI polymerization on top was responsible for water impermeability. The executed system of two independent
cures allowed the BMI domain to be stratified on top and the epoxy portion to settle at the bottom due to liquefying
and curing discrepancies between them, that is, the epoxy melts to flow and cure under 120 ∘C and the BMI does
not until over 140 ∘C.
FBE formulations consisting of epoxy-amine-BMI blends in which crosslinking of both epoxies and BMIs
occurred via mutually compatible amines chosen from dihydrazides with primary −NH2 reactive groups,
specifically ADH (adipic dihydrazide) and VDH (valine dihydrazide), were further investigated. That is, the
simultaneous curing of epoxies and BMIs is somewhat bonded via the same amine crosslinker molecules instead
of taking place individually, as detailed in Tables 9.4a/b, distinguished from the examples as disclosed to comprise
epoxy-active ester (as the crosslinker) co-polymerization and peroxide-activated BMI self-polymerization [7], and
from the case study as listed in Table 9.3, which is typical of epoxy homo-polymerization (crosslinker-free) and
organometallic complex-initiated BMI self-crosslinking, respectively.
For both formulations in Tables 9.4a/b, the formulation index (FI) was designed to be one to one, corresponding
to the molar amount of the epoxy and the BMI combined to that of the dihydrazide employed, namely, ADH for
(a) and VDH-J for (b), while the BMI loading accounted for 10% by weight of the epoxy resin in each formula.
The imidazole adduct catalyst (i.e., Epikure P-101) at approximately 1.70 phr was used exclusively for the epoxy,
whereas ZnAcAc was used as the co-catalyst at roughly 4.50 phr specifically for the BMI. Excellent adhesion,
toughness, and gloss were observed upon full cure, with the exception of the green-to-brown color change (see

the pictures on the left in Table 9.4: two on top are for ADH’s at 75 and 95 ∘C before and after, and the two at
the bottom are for VDH’s, respectively). Compared to generic FBEs cured by amines or phenolics, these two
formulations were competitive in practically all aspects, including gel times, pill flows, Tg, cure responses and
kinetic behaviors, flexibility, and toughness, with the exception of discoloration. By comparing DSC peaks and
onset temperatures performed at 20 ∘C/min, as exhibited in Figure 9.4a, low-melting VDH (Tm 120 ∘C) appears to
cure faster than high-melting ADH (Tm 180 ∘C) does while having comparable enthalpies at the given FI = 1; in
another aspect, dual diverged peaks occurred for both ADH and VDH, corresponding to epoxy and BMI-related
curing, respectively. In addition to co-polymerizations of epoxy-amines and BMI-amines, certain amounts of
homo-polymerizations of epoxies and BMIs also coexisted in the system. Dual onset/peak temperatures for VDH’s

were less separated at 83.6/111.6 ∘C and 123.5/143.9 ∘C, respectively, when DSC was conducted at 7.0 ∘C/min;
the dual exothermic peaks for ADH’s were more separated than those for VDH’s regardless of the heating rates,
because ADH has a higher melting point than VDH. HWA immersion performance at 75 and 95 ∘C for 28 days
(refer to the panel pictures on the right in Table 9.4 in the same stacking order) was generally comparable to
those of standard FBEs, if not better; mixed results in adhesion and water uptake (indicating film impermeability
and/or moisture resistance) were possibly attributed to panel surface prep at that time. Probably due to the
thermoplastic nature of BMI self-polymerization migrating on top, the cured coating films of these two products
were soft when heated in hot water.
Separately, the effects of BMIs as an additive resin introduced in low-temperature cure powders (refer to Table
6.29 in Chapter 6 for the original formulation) were evaluated utilizing the VDH-based FBE modification, as
well as its performance data, which are presented in Table 9.4c and Figure 9.4b. Regarding coating compositions,
YD-012Q, a Type 2 epoxy resin with a low-melting point, was still utilized, as was Compimide MAHD as an additive
resin at 2.44% by weight of the total epoxy plus the BMI resin at a given FI of one (i.e., the combined molar amount
of epoxy and BMI resins equal to that of the total VDH-J as an amine crosslinker) versus the original FI = 2.00.
ZnAcAc was charged at 21.0 phr (of the BMI additive resin) as the exclusive catalyst for the BMI, while the total
catalyst loading level of (Epikure P-101 and ZnAcAc) remained unchanged. The most noticeable effect was that
the addition of BMIs accelerated the overall curing response (due to reduced Ea), despite that fact that the onset
and peak temperatures increased slightly (e.g., 91.3/114.5 ∘C in Figure 9.4b versus 82.6/106.9 ∘C in Figure 6.30a
of Chapter 6, both conducted at 7.0 ∘C/min). The BMI, as a co-binder resin, modified the cure mechanisms, as
revealed by the pattern and trending profile of DSC exotherms. Other performance parameters, such as longer
gel times and pill flows, decreased Tg (106.1 versus 112.5 ∘C), reduced Ea (44.45 versus 45.75 kJ/mol), and the
increased reaction order m (0.80 versus 0.59), were considerably altered as a result of the modification. Therefore,
it would take approximately 523.2 sec to attain a cure level of 99%, as opposed to 648.0 sec for the original formu-
lation. Unfortunately, BMI has a negative effect on appearance, causing discoloration that is highly undesirable.
In conclusion, BMI-modified VDH-based low-cure FBE coatings conduct cure more effectively, although they are
not necessarily superior as applied formulation candidates.
Epoxy-BOX hybrids including a phenolic resin (such as KD-405) incorporated for cure temperature mitigation
have been elucidated earlier (refer to BOXs in Chapter 7). In addition, epoxy (such as Olin’s DER 672U)-BOX
(such as Shikoku Chemicals’ P-d) hybrids containing 2MI at 1.0 phr as the sole catalyst for the epoxy resin tended
to develop dual DSC exothermic peaks widely separated at 164.7 and 275.6 ∘C, corresponding to epoxy homo-cures

364

and BOX self-crosslinking (uncatalyzed), respectively. It reveals that the desired co-polymerization between epox-
ies and BOXs scarcely takes place because BOXs generate epoxy-reactive Ph-OH groups at a significantly higher
temperature than epoxy self-crosslinking. As a result, the coating stratifies with BOX on top, resulting in a cured
film that is dark brown and extremely brittle. Notably, and as a separate exhibition of epoxy hybrids from the mar-
ket, Carboxane 2100 BR is an epoxy-modified siloxane hybrid coating launched by Carboline in July 2022 to inhibit
the pronounced fungal growth of bacteria and fungi (such as Baudoinia), thereby providing great fungal-resistant
protection for coated assets.
9.2
Non-Epoxy Systems
Applied coatings and adhesives heavily rely on three primary high-strength bonding chemistries, notably epoxy,
polyurethane (PUR), and acrylic, to adhere crucial parts together in a cost-effective manner. Due to their outstand-
ing bonding, mechanical, chemical, and thermal properties [11–13], epoxies are highly competitive in a variety
of industrial applications. Particularly, aromatic epoxies with high Tgs and good heat resistance serve as effec-
tive structural adhesives (> 1,000 psi in terms of bonding strength). PURs that are hard and rigid (as opposed to
urethane, which is soft and flexible) are UV stable, abrasion-, wear-, and chemical-resistant. Acrylics can cure
in seconds upon UV or a free-radical-initiated polymerization process. PURs have higher and more sustainable
elasticity throughout a broader temperature range (i.e., are less temperature sensitive) than acrylics, for instance,
from −20 to 60 ∘C centered on room temperature. Polyesters, including alkyd coatings, can function between −60
and 150 ∘C. As leading polymer technologies in the coatings industry, PURs, acrylics, and polyesters are all infe-
rior to epoxies in terms of heat resistance, for example, > 150 ∘C. Typically, a PUR coating on top of an epoxy
primer provides sufficient adhesion and weatherability; ideally, a zinc primer applied below is regarded as the
most resilient for long-lasting corrosion protection [14]. In addition, silicones (i.e., siloxanes), because of their elas-
tomeric properties, offer unrivaled flexibility and high heat resistance (e.g., > 350 ∘C), despite their Tgs being vari-
ably close to or below –40 ∘C. Similarly, polyesters (PEs), especially those in high-performance grades, are ideally
suited for exterior applications in the electrical and electronics, automotive, aerospace, medical, and construction
industries.
9.2.1
Polyurethanes and polyols
Table 9.5 gathers and compares bulk non-epoxy polymer platforms, such as PURs, acrylics, and polyesters, as
competitive binder systems for a variety of coating and adhesive applications. Specifically, PURs are as versatile
as epoxies for widespread end applications, including but not limited to household (e.g., mattress, foam insula-
tion for refrigerators and freezers), construction, automotive (e.g., seats), marine, coatings, adhesives, fibers (e.g.,
Spandex), and composites (e.g., shoe soles). Typically, PURs are formulated and manufactured as 1/2K in WB,
SB, or powder form. As essential components (reacting with polyols) for PURs, isocyanates are fairly limited to
aromatic MDI, TDI, and aliphatic HDI, IPDI. However, as also essential components (reacting with NCO) for
PURs, polyols are available in a wide variety, such as polyether polyols, which include PEG (i.e., polyethylene gly-
col), PPG (i.e., polypropylene glycol), and PTMEG (i.e., polytetrahydrofuran or polytetramethylene ether glycol)
(Figures 9.5a/b/c), polyester polyols, and other polyols listed in Table 9.5. These polymeric polyols make it possible
to tailor a vast array of PUR characteristics. For instance, polycaprolactone polyester polyols, which are diols of typ-
ical molecular weights between 2,000 and 4,000, are produced from ring-opening polymerization of 𝜀-caprolactone
under catalysis (such as enzymes [15], 𝛽-cyclodextrin [16], or others) and/or a hydroxyl functional initiator. They
are increasingly utilized in reactive hotmelt PUR adhesives to replace SB platforms because they outperform con-
ventional non-reactive hotmelt adhesives in terms of heat resistance, chemical resistance, and adhesion to metal
and wood in particular [17]. Furthermore, it has been reported that cis/trans DHMTHF (from biomass)-derived
polyester polyols (similar to cyclic CHDM, TMCBDO, etc.; refer to Figure 9.6) are used in 2K PUR adhesives [18].

Water, alcohols, and amines are chain extenders in NCO-polyol reactions; BDO (i.e., 1,4-butanediol) is a widely
used chain extender that, when combined with MDI, contributes to the characteristic hard segments of PURs, as
is PDO (1,3-propanediol). For instance, water-blown flexible PUR foam can be formulated with MDI (e.g., PAPITM
27) in the A-side and a polyol in addition to other ingredients such as DBTDL, stannous octoate, surfactant, and
blowing agent (i.e., DI water) in the B-side. Particularly suited for adhesives, sealants, elastomers, molded foams,
flexible foams, reaction injection molded (RIM), furniture, bedding, and public building slab stock are polyether
polyols with MWs between 300 and 6,000. High-MW polyols are commonly defined as having MWs greater than
6,000 g/mol.

Chemical structures of representative diols, polyols, diacids, and anhydrides as building blocks for polyesters.
Still especially, PTMEG (Figure 9.5c)-based PURs are low in viscosity (or solid, difficult to handle if MW >
1,000), flexible at low temperatures, resilient, and resistant to noise, hydrolysis, and fungus; 16% of global PTMEG
consumptions is devoted to thermoplastic PUR (TPU), cast elastomers, adhesives, sealants, and surface coatings.
Regarding conventional polyols, diols are for flexibility, while triols and multi-functionals are for rigidity; substi-
tuted diols and polyols, such as PPG over PEG (Figures 9.5b/a), increase hardness. As a result, flexible, semi-rigid,
and rigid foams are custom-formulated by selecting polyols and their blends with appropriate MW and structural

properties. Additionally, the primary OHs of polyols are more reactive than their secondary counterparts. Royal
Dutch Shell, Cargill, Dow Chemicals, Covestro, Stepan, BASF (accounting for 50% of PTMEG, Dairen Chemicals),
and others are well-known polyol suppliers worldwide; Asia, Europe, and North America currently dominate
polyol consumer markets.
In general, PUR-oriented applications are the major consumers of polyols, accounting for 65% of the total mar-
ket. Asia, driven by China, consumes 80% of the total amount of high-performance PTMEG used to manufacture
Spandex, a TPU fiber. The greatest chance for polyols to expand globally is bio-based resources with green foot-
prints. More specifically, from a market perspective, two major segments, polyether polyols (accounting for ∼60%
of total PUR markets) dominating flexible foams with an 81.3% market share and polyester polyols (accounting
for ∼40% of total PUR markets) for both flexible and rigid foams, generated an estimated USD 28.36 billion in rev-
enue in 2019. Noteworthy is the fact that polyether backbones are unstable above 220 ∘C, necessitating the use of
flame retardants in foam; polyester backbones have higher thermal resistance but lower hydrolytic stability than
polyether’s.
CASEs (coatings, adhesives, sealants, and elastomers), especially adhesives and sealants, have been growing as
new applications emerge in the construction industry, such as flooring, water proofing, woodwork, and plumbing.
This is in addition to the growth of CASEs in the automotive industry, including lighter, more compact vehicles at
lower costs by using new materials such as plastic composites and fibers. Co-polyester-ether elastomers (COPE) are
also high-performance engineered materials for automotive and medical applications that bridge the gap between
flexible elastomers and rigid plastics.
9.2.2
Acrylics and acrylates
As used in architectural coatings and product finishes, including automotive OEM and refinish, special-purpose
coatings, and many others, acrylics and acrylic resins (Table 9.5) are among the leading polymer coating tech-
nologies that are replacing historically dominant alkyd finishes in industrial coatings. Acrylic resins are generally
derived from acrylate and methacrylate monomers (secondarily vinyl- and OH-functional resins), giving versatility
and good performance in outdoor applications, such as resistance to weather and hydrolysis, as well as gloss and
color retention. Acrylic coatings account for more than 25% of all coatings [20], and the global market for acrylic
coatings is estimated to grow substantially and lucratively, from USD 61.9 billion in 2023 to USD 78.6 billion by
2028 [21]. The increasing demand and utilization of acrylic coatings can be attributed to their notable attributes,
which include rapid dry time, broad pigment compatibility, and favorable environmental impact. Acrylic coatings
are favored in numerous sectors, including general industrial, automotive, and construction, due to their heat and
water resistance, adhesion, flexibility, and ease of application for a wide range of substrates (e.g., metal, plastic,
wood, and concrete). Acrylic resins can be thermoplastic primarily based on methacrylate, thermosetting derived
from self-crosslinking and co-polymerization, and functionalized such as carbamates and GMAs (i.e., glycidyl
methacrylate acids; refer to Figures 2.5a/b in Chapter 2), and they are widely employed in SB, WB (where DMEA
and AMP amines are frequently utilized for neutralization, if required), latex (dispersions or emulsions), powder,
and radiation-curable coatings, depending on the appropriateness for end-use applications.
As feedstocks for ultimately regenerative adhesives and coatings, acrylic acid and methyl acrylates are report-
edly produced highly selectively (96%) from biomass-derived methyl lactate using cyclic tertiary amine (such as
4,4′-trimethylenedipyridine or 44TMDP) impregnated Na-FAU (sodium-faujasite type) zeolite (Si/Al = 2.6) cata-
lysts at 300 ∘C, yielding up to 92% [22]. This new catalyst technology is presently being commercialized by Låkril
Technologies, a startup company based in Chicago, Illinois, United States, to manufacture inexpensive, renewable
acrylic acid and acrylates [23]. Acrylate monomers are generally more reactive for energy cure and have a lower Tg
than analogous methacrylate monomers, with functionality not appearing to be a factor. Polyacrylates are natu-
rally soft and hydrophobic, in contrast to polymethacrylates (PMA) and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), which
are hard and hydrophobic as building blocks (Table 9.6b and Figures 9.5d/e). Acrylics are generally resistant to

the environment, curing fast, and low in VOCs, although their acid resistance is poor. The ATR-IR signals at 1,635
(C=C stretch), 810 (H-C=C bending), and 1,510 cm−1 (aromatic ring stretch) are characteristic of vinyl monomers,
such as acrylate esters, for which Miwon Specialty Chemical and Sartomer Americas are leading suppliers. Acrylic
resins may contain additional vinyl monomers, such as styrene and vinyl acetate, for the primary purpose of cost
reduction.
To underline, isobornyl methacrylate (IBOMA, MW 222.32 g/eq, Table 9.6b), which is compatible with
other functional acrylates, including MMA, is regarded as a uniquely valuable acrylate monomer due to its
bulky polycyclic side chain with hydrophobicity [24]. When partially or completely incorporated into formu-
lations, IBOMA improves properties such as hardness for scratch and mar resistance, Tg (up to 110.5 ∘C for its
homopolymer) for heat resistance, flexibility for cracking and crazing resistance, adhesion (to meals, wood, and
plastics), hydrophobicity for moisture and corrosion resistance, and weatherability for UV resistance, which is
applicable to solvent-based (and low VOCs), waterborne (WB), and UV-curable coatings. Bio-based IBOMA,
such as Visiomer® Terra IBOMA by Evonik, is commercially available. There are three basic categories of liquid
coatings that incorporate acrylic resins: thermoplastic, thermosetting, and WB. Thermoplastic acrylic polymers

9.2 Non-Epoxy Systems
369
(TPA) generally have excellent properties, such as exterior hardness and durability, typically through the use
of a high concentration of methyl methacrylate; however, they require large quantities of organic solvents or
low solids (e.g., ∼20% by weight) to enable air-atomized spray application. As a result, their use in vehicle
OEM and refinish topcoats has decreased considerably. Thermosetting acrylic resins (TSA) are formulated with
functional monomers that either self-react when exposed to heat or moisture or create a co-polymerized film
with a crosslinker. TSAs have lower MWs and, hence, greater application solids. Once cross-linked, they provide
films with excellent resistance to organic solvents, moisture, and UV light, and they do not soften appreciably
when exposed to moderately high temperatures, unlike thermoplastics. As gathered in Table 9.6a, functional
groups, such as −OH and −COOH, can be utilized to functionalize acrylic polymers with enhanced properties
such as crosslinking, self-crosslinking, adhesion, and pigment wetting. Specifically, the ability to functionalize
an acrylic resin with a wide range of reactive moieties enables the performance of the resin backbone to be
tailored to provide improved adhesion to a variety of substrates, including metal, in addition to other reactivity
and/or utility, such as improved pigment wetting and/or the ability to crosslink or self-crosslink. There are other
acrylic monomers that can confer sulfonic acid or phosphoric acid functionality. It is also possible to produce
carbamate-functional acrylics by reacting an isocyanate-functional acrylic with hydroxypropyl carbamate. Many
functionalized acrylic resins are used to replace TPAs in vehicle OEM and refinish clearcoats because they provide
an excellent combination of mar resistance, chemical resistance, and light stability. In addition, as indicated in
Table 9.6b, Tgs of acrylic monomers can be chosen to improve a variety of properties, such as weathering and
moisture resistance, oxygen permeability, hardness and flexibility, and reactivity and curing. For example, when
Tg of a given acrylic polymer increases, the hardness increases, the flexibility decreases, the functional group
reactivity of ambient-curable coatings decreases, the rate of solvent evaporation for ambient coatings decreases,
and oxygen and water permeability decrease. Acrylic adhesives provide exceptional resistance to heat, chemicals,
and the environment from the perspective of adhesive products when adequately formulated. For example,
Mactac’s HSA440 is a versatile acrylic adhesive with an excellent balance of peel, tack, and shear, in addition to
exceptional moisture and chemical resistance. It adheres well to materials with M/HSE (medium/high surface
tensions), including textiles and textured surfaces. LSE427 from Mactac is a modified acrylic adhesive designed
for LSE (low surface tension) materials, while HBA724 is aggressively designed for service temperature resistance
up to 350 ∘F (177 ∘C).
Acrylics are also extensively employed to produce water-reducible and emulsion resins. Water-reducible acrylic
resins typically have an acid number between 40 and 60, for example, from a blend of acrylic monomers through
free-radical polymerization in a water-reducible solvent such as 2-butoxy ethanol with butyl alcohol, that is, solu-
tion polymerization. To convert them into coatings or paints, an appropriate amine, such as 2-(dimethyl amino)
ethanol (DMEA) or 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP), is employed to neutralize the acrylic acid in the resin
backbone in order to produce an acid salt. The next step in the paint-making process is the addition of water as a
reducer. In contrast, latexes or acrylic emulsion polymerization are carried out in water using acrylic monomers,
a water-soluble initiator, and surfactants, similar to interfacial polymerization as described in Chapter 8. Many
of the same monomers are used in emulsion polymerization as in solution polymerization; however, changes in
polymerization conditions, monomer structures and solubility, monomer concentrations, surfactant types and
levels, temperatures, initiator types and concentrations, and so on can have a significant impact on the properties
of latexes, such as the emulsion particle size, structural morphology, and molecular weight of the final polymer.
In addition to vinyl-functional acrylic resins for radiation-curable coatings, decorative powder coatings also uti-
lize acrylic polymers with OH- and COOH-functional groups. The underlying influence of monomer Tg, MW,
and functionality remain the same for all the applications described in this subsection. Notably, when it comes to
free-radical reactions of coatings where oxygen inhibition is detrimental to cure speed (thus a thin coating cures
more slowly), waxes such as BYK-S-781/-782 and others can be incorporated to prevent oxygen since wax migrates
onto surfaces during the curing process.

9.2.3
Polyesters and their monomers
Hydroxyl (OH)- and carboxyl (COOH)-functional polyester (PE) coatings account for a substantial portion of the
construction, automotive, and aerospace industries because they can be engineered to provide excellent mechan-
ical, impact-, UV-, and chemical-resistant properties for use in WB, high-solids low VOCs, and powder coat-
ings. PEs, when cured by melamine or blocked isocyanates, exhibit excellent flexibility, chemical resistance, and
lightfastness; linearly structured PEs make up a significant percentage of the resins used for coil coatings. Ther-
mosetting PEs typically impart superior adhesion to metal and impact resistance compared to TSAs (thermoset-
ting acrylics), which are typically superior in hydrolysis and weathering resistance. PEs are more sensitive to
hydrolysis, particularly at elevated temperatures, because of the ester linkages present in their backbones. In gen-
eral, amine (e.g., DICY)-cured epoxies have the highest hydrolysis resistance, followed by polyether-urethanes;
polyester-urethane, fluorinated polyacrylate, and anhydride-cured epoxy polymers have the lowest hydrolysis
resistance. Several thermosetting polymers are ranked in ascending order according to their hydrolysis stability:
aliphatic ester < aromatic ester < urethane < aliphatic amide < urea < aromatic amide. Eastman claims that 2K
SB protective coatings formulated with TetrashieldTM polyesters (derived from TMCBDO or TMCD for short, i.e.,
2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclobutanediol, Figure 9.6 and Table 9.7), as an alternative to fluoropolymer technology,
can withstand severe weather conditions due to enhanced hydrolytic stability, greater toughness, and improved
chemical resistance [25], as can polyesteramides or polyester blends containing TMCD for use in metal packaging
applications [26, 27]. Notably, toughening compounds are typically employed in DICY-cured epoxy systems.

PEs are frequently produced through step-growth polymerization or condensation (since water is a byprod-
uct) of an alcohol containing at least two hydroxyl groups and a carboxylic acid containing at least two carboxyl
groups, as viewed in detail [28]. Typically, PEs contain a blend of diols, triols, and dibasic acids with an excess of
polyols to form an OH-terminated polyester for reactions with melamine or isocyanates to produce a coating film,
or with an excess of dibasic acids to yield a COOH-terminated polyester for reactions with epoxy, melamine, or
2-hydroxyalkylamides (HAA, Figure 9.5f), as outlined in Table 9.5. For conventional PEs cured with melamine
or isocyanate prepolymers, the averaged MWs range between 2,000 and 6,000. Branched PEs are made from
monomers with functionality greater than two. Other PE synthesis routes include reactions of an ester with an
alcohol, an anhydride with an alcohol, and the ring opening reaction of a lactone. Figure 9.6 recollects com-
mon OH- and COOH-functional monomers and anhydrides for building corresponding polyesters [28]. Proper
selection of monomers (affecting hardness, flexibility, UV stability, chemical resistance, and hydrolytic stability)
and polymer architectural morphology (i.e., linear, branched, functionality, MW, and MWD) are required from
a structure-property relationship perspective to attain the desired end performance (respecting durability, hard-
ness, corrosion resistance, humidity resistance, cured speed, flexibility, stain resistance, chemical resistance, and
hydrolytic stability). In other words, a variety of structural attributes drive a variety of performance characteris-
tics, such as hydrolytic stability by NPG, sebacic acid, and CHDA, exterior weather-ability by NPG, DEPD, TMP,
TME, HHPA, and IPA, hardness by NPG, TME, CHDA, and TA, flexibility by AA, AzA, CHDA, sebacic acid, TA,
HDO (primarily by segments of acids), and so on, as described in Table 9.7. Last but not least, the architecture
of polyesters may be modified with one or more reactive moieties to generate, for instance, urethane-, oil-, or
acrylic-modified attributes, if desired or as required.
Comparing tetra-functional HAA (i.e., 𝛽-hydroxyl alkyl amide) as a non-TGIC crosslinker to tri-functional
TGIC (triglycidyl isocyanurate) typically used for curing COOH-functional polyester powder coatings (refer
to Figure 9.5f and Table 2.3e in Chapter 2), the former requires a higher processing and cure temperature of
minimally 145 versus 130 ∘C for the latter. HAA tends to yellow under overbaked conditions, whereas both are
UV resistant (weather neutral). In addition, HAA is for DFT (dry film thickness), preferably at 3.5–4.0 mils due
to water release (which otherwise causes outgassing), as opposed to 1.5–10 mils for TGIC, intended primarily
for, for example, decorative applications. Standard durable powders (i.e., PEs derived from para-structured TA,
Figure 9.6 and Table 9.7) of both TGIC and HAA can withstand approximately 18 months in South Florida before
degrading; super-durable versions (i.e., PEs made of meta-structured IPA, Figure 9.6 and Table 9.7) of each can
endure up to five years under the same exposure conditions. EMS-Griltech offers one commercial HAA product
under the registered brand name Primid®.
In practice, alkyd-based coatings are cured through both physical and chemical drying processes. The oils uti-
lized in alkyds are classified as drying (for air- and ambient-cured alkyd resins), semi-drying, and non-drying (for
baking systems). Low-molecular-weight alkyd natural oils would crosslink by oxidizing their unsaturated double
bonds through peroxide intermediates. Metals can aid in catalyzing or speeding up the oxidative-cure reaction
and are often referred to as driers. Initially, lead and mercury were used as catalysts, but they were phased out due
to environmental pressure. Other traditional replacements, such as cobalt carboxylates, manganese, and iron, are
also under pressure to be replaced in order to eliminate the health risks of heavy metals. In the form of an octoate
or hexanoate, organometallic calcium, zirconium, and cobalt were included in traditional alkyd drier recipes.
Air-dry alkyds require a consistent and balanced cure; therefore, a combination of driers, one to cure the surface
and the other to cure through the film, is desired [29]. Using non-drying oils while increasing the polyester con-
tent allows alkyds to be crosslinked by melamine-formaldehyde (MF) resins with a strong acid catalyst (typically
para-toluene sulfonic acid, or p-TSA; refer to Table 8.7 in Chapter 8) and under heat, resulting in a variety of bak-
ing coatings with significantly improved properties and performance. Two leading technologies to replace cobalt
driers are based on manganese (good drying activity but discoloration) and iron (poor drying activity, especially
at ambient temperature, and discoloration). An iron-bispidon complex, also referred to as high-performance cat-
alysts (HPC), increases catalytic activity at very low iron weight percentages (e.g., less than 0.0008 iron wt% on

372

resin solids) [30]. During the curing process, the presence of HPC results in fewer formations of typical-for-cobalt
ether and ester bonds and more C-C crosslinks, indicating less residual unsaturation and a higher conversion rate
for HPC-contained alkyd coatings. HPC-based alkyd coatings outperform both commercial alkyd coatings and
commercial acrylic paints in most tests.

Acrylate adhesive case studies
A couple of applied acrylate adhesive formulations are offered as examples of TIMs (thermal interface materials)
in Table 9.8 in order to provide valuable insights on acylate cure chemistry platforms, adhesive formulation strate-
gies, and ingredient selection that are primarily driven by practically viable solutions and end-use applications.
Specifically, Example 1 is a 1K free-radical with an activator (serving as a contingent primer) aimed at various
substrates and bond gaps, and Example 2 is a 2K UV-curable TIM with a thermal conductivity of 2.0 W/m-∘K due
to an overall alumina loading of close to 700 phr and a designed mixing ratio of Part A to Part B of 2: 1 by volume
and weight. Note that all alumina grades of different particle sizes were surface treated with silane A-137 (refer to
Table 8.2 in Chapter 8) for dispersing compatibility in both parts of Example 2.
More specifically, in Example 1 of greater than 99.6% solids and 59.3% filler loading, mono-functional THFMA
and HPMA serve as the bulk monomers cured by free-radicals (of cumene hydroperoxide) and accelerated by ben-
zoic sulfimide (i.e., saccharin, Tm 228.8 ∘C, Figure 9.7a). Saccharin, an artificial sweetener, presumably functions
as an effective curing agent for acrylate adhesives on metal substrates, as does aspartame (Figure 9.7b). Compat-
ible ethylene methacrylate copolymer (EMA, Figure 9.7c) was incorporated at 7.41% by weight as a carrier resin

and modifications for toughness, flexibility, and ATH filler acceptance; EMA is known for excellent thermal sta-
bility (the highest among ethylene acrylate copolymers, in fact) and adhesion across a broad temperature range.
Aldehyde-amine condensate (R-N=C<) was employed as the activator for this 1K adhesive in order to acceler-
ate curing under anaerobic conditions. For example, Henkel’s Loctite SF 736, as is suitable for applications with
passive metals or inert surfaces and with large bond gaps, is cured by an aldehyde-amine condensate. Similar to
heterocyclic secondary amines, the aromatic tertiary amine quinaldine (Figure 9.7d) serves to speed up curing.
Likewise, quinoline or quinoxaline is favored for anaerobic cure systems that are susceptible to oxygen inhibition.
In a laboratory setting, adhesives similar to Example 1 that contain a supplementary activator can be easily pro-
duced by a speed mixer without the use of a vacuum, as air prolongs the shelf life and viscosity can be measured
accordingly. When applying the activator to metal surfaces, one-side activation is recommended if the bond line
gap is less than 0.1 mm, but two-side activation (on both substrates to be joined) is preferred if the bond line gap
is equal to or greater than 0.5 mm. The lap-shear strength, upon appropriate and complete curing according to
a particular schedule, can subsequently be tested in accordance with ISO 4587 or other industrial standards as
required.
Still more specifically, in Example 2 of a 2K acrylate adhesive capable of UV energy curing, CN992 and SR238B,
both difunctional on the A-side, are aromatic building blocks for hardness and aliphatic building blocks for flexibil-
ity in energy-efficient coatings of free-radical polymerization, respectively. CN992 is a polyester-based diacrylate
oligomer (Tg 27 ∘C) with low viscosity (545 cPs at 60 ∘C) and thus excellent conformal properties; SR238B is a
fast-curing monomer with low viscosity, low volatility, a hydrophobic backbone, and good solvency. These acry-
lates are not only UV/EB-curable, but also peroxide-curable and amine-curable, and they can, if necessary, improve
the performance of 2K epoxy-amine coatings. TPP on the A-side serves as a catalyst since TPP and phosphonium
salts are good at accelerating a variety of polymerizing reactions, including the curing of epoxy resins and pho-
topolymerizations (refer to Table 2.6a and Figures 2.14a/b in Chapter 2). On the B-side of curing agents, di-TMP,
short for trimethylolpropane tris(3-mercaptopropionate), with triple primary (1∘)-SH groups, serves as the bulk
crosslinker in acrylates to enhance radiation curing by reducing air inhibition (refer to Figure 9.20c; note that
trimethylolpropane or TMP itself is widely used as a modifier via chain transfer reactions, refer to Figure 3.8 in
Chapter 3); DEAP serves as an effective photo-initiator with fast-curing, non-yellowing properties, and good shelf
stability. In addition, EMA or Vamac DP (Figure 9.7c) can be appropriately incorporated in both A- and B-sides for
applications requiring heat and chemical resistance, as can a silane (such as vinyl-functional Silquest A-174, best
suited in adhesive and sealant systems cured via a free-radical mechanism) for adhesion and cohesion promotion,
if necessary. At room temperature, the typical viscosity of this adhesive is 1,150,000 cPs for Part A and 1,300,000
cPs for Part B when measured with an F-t bar spindle at 2 rpm and 405,000 cPs for Part A and 170,000 cPs for Part B
when tested at 20 rpm, respectively. In addition to thermal conductivity, adhesive performance properties include
weatherability, chemical and water resistance, adhesion, hardness and abrasion resistance, and heat resistance, as
needed.
To conclude the discussions on PURs, acrylics, and PEs, PURs are equally super-durable and have more
crosslinker alternatives for adjusting crosslinking density, while PEs (typically cured by TGIC) have more raw
resin possibilities. Generally speaking, PUR coatings provide excellent mechanical and structural integrity at

374
9 Hybrids and Non-Epoxy Platforms
service temperatures, chemical resistance and remain firmly adhered to substrates. PURs with high thickness are
probably brittle. Because PURs are easier to sand than epoxies, they dominate the automotive primer market.
For coil coatings, an OH-functional PE liquid coating cured by, for example, melamine or isocyanates can be
utilized. Leading liquid topcoats are thermosetting polyesters (with unsaturated chains including styrene),
acrylics, and PURs, in which NMP is a common polar solvent, if necessary. Comparatively, epoxy acrylates cure
extremely fast at room temperature and have great chemical resistance, but not high strength; epoxy has poor
weathering or chalking resistance and is therefore only suitable for indoor uses. Physically, the finish gloss level
of powder coatings ranges from low to high, up to 100%, as follows: epoxy < PUR < hybrid < TGIC < HAA (refer
to Table 6.28 in Chapter 6); PUR powder coatings usually require two passes through extruding for acceptable
dispersing, but epoxies do not.
9.2.5
Polyurea coating case studies
Global polyurea coatings market size was USD 1.2 billion in 2021 and is projected to reach USD 2.79 billion
by 2030 [31]. As has been demonstrated, aromatic and aliphatic amines are versatile and nearly indispensable
crosslinkers in straight and hybrid formulations of epoxies and acrylates curable at ambient temperature or ele-
vated temperatures. Amines, especially aromatic and primary ones, are vital to applied polyurea coatings for sur-
face dielectric insulation of lithium-ion battery cells in electric vehicles, as described by Li et al. [32] and detailed in
Table 9.9.
It should not be overlooked that amines for crosslinking epoxies and isocyanates typically have different reac-
tive equivalent weights, respectively, because 1∘amines readily react with epoxides twice in epoxy formulations
but with isocyanates only once in most conditions, such as in a polyurea system, respectively, resulting in a
highly crosslinked network for the former and a weakly covalent thermoset typically referred to as an elastomer
for the latter. In contrast, hydrogen bonding in polyurea polymers is substantially stronger than in epoxies and
polyurethanes. Except for the chain extender of Polylink 4200, which is an aromatic secondary (2∘) amine with
relatively low reactivity for preferred gel and touch-free modification, all amine equivalent weights in Part B of
a crosslinker blend in this subsection are based on primary (1∘) amines reacting once and aimed exclusively at
polyurea formulations.
In general, the underlying 2K polyurea coatings were formulated with a volume ratio of 1: 1 (Part A to Part
B) and an NCO/amine ratio of 1.06, having viscosities as low as 100 cPs and densities of 1.094 for Part A and
0.939 for Part B, respectively, if unfilled or devoid of alumina. All variables changed drastically when it was highly
filled with Denka DAW-05 (spherical, 5.0 μm, 0.32 m2/g) at ∼200 phr to achieve thermal conductivity of up to
0.80 W/m-∘K (versus ∼0.25 for the unfilled formulation), while extra xylene had to be charged for dilution. As a
result, viscosity increased to 320–350 cPs, density increased to 1.86 for Part A and 1.76 g/ml for Part B, and gel and
tack-free times were settled at 30–50 and 120–240 sec, respectively, at ambient temperature. Part A’s constituent
elements are straightforward: p-TSI (i.e., Additive TI, OMG Borchers) is a highly reactive moisture scavenger to
be loaded ahead of MDI prepolymers that are commercially available or can be manufactured in-house using, for
example, polypropylene glycols and excessive isocyanates at 50–60 ∘C. Part B’s amine compositions are crucial to
the final elastomer’s properties: PEA D230 (MW 230) and D2000 (MW 2,000) are aliphatic polyether diamines
(refer to Table 2.2f in Chapter 2) as the main crosslinkers rendering soft blocks for primarily flexibility, whereas
T5000 is aliphatic polyether tri-amines enhancing crosslinking density; Lonzacure® DETDA 80 of primary (1∘)
and Polylink 4200 of secondary (2∘) amines are aromatic chain extenders as hard blocks serving to modify gel
times, hardness, and processing flowability. The ratio of primary chain extenders to difunctional amines affected
hardness, as did the ratio of secondary chain extenders to trifunctional amines; however, the loading levels or
ratios of primary to secondary, low to high MW, and aliphatic to aromatic amines in the underlying Part B were
not necessarily optimized.

ably primed with, for example, Sherwin-Williams’s P60-G2 industrial wash primer and R7K 44 catalyst reducer

ings are created and stored for over two weeks, it may be necessary to re-disperse both Parts A and B. Regarding
the application of the polyurea topcoat, it has been determined that an impingement spray at 1 gal/min flow rate,
2,500–3,000 psi, either a flat or round tip, and 150 ∘F heating of both components is suitable for a one-pass spraying

At 200 phr filler loading in each part, cured film tensile strength and elongation at RT averaged at 1,942 psi and
24.1%, respectively; Taber abrasion weight loss under CS-17 and 1,000 cycles was ∼58.0 mg; a smooth surface fin-
ish, including a SEM image, is shown in Figure 9.8b. Cohesion hardness reached 91 Shore A (equivalent to storage
modulus G′ ≈864 MPa, Figure 9.9), voltage breakdowns were up to 1.22 kV/mil, and thermal conductivity was
around 0.80 W/m-∘K, resulting in a thermal impedance of 4.41 ∘C/W at 8.7 mils. The modulus profiles of DMA
performed on free films employing a temperature ramp at a constant frequency of 1.0 Hz are comparable to those
of silicone elastomers. Specifically (Figure 9.9), the cured Tg was determined to be approximately −27 to −36.6 ∘C
based on the Tan𝛿and G′′ peaks, the coating system had a low crosslinking density and was predominantly amor-
phous, the cured polyurea demonstrated cold flexibility down to approximately −37 ∘C, the polymer began to
soften at approximately 110–125 ∘C, and its heat resistance beyond 125 ∘C became possibly unsustainable. In gen-
eral, the sprayed and cured coating should perform robustly without integrity failure at temperatures between −40
and 110 ∘C or possibly up to 125 ∘C (i.e., the end of the G′ plateau before the second Tan𝛿peak), consistent with

9.2 Non-Epoxy Systems
377
the results of thermal cycling tests carried out between −40 and 125 ∘C without voltage breakdown degradation
issues. In addition, deformation behaviors at low frequency via frequency sweep DMA revealed that the coating
maintains good cohesion to resist creep, as the elastic modulus (G′) remains approximately six times higher than
the viscous modulus (G′′ ≈125 MPa) at room temperature across all tested frequencies (from 0 to 20 Hz). The
use of reactive diluents, namely propylene carbonate in Part A of isocyanate prepolymers and aldimine (Arnox
6, Arnette Polymers) in Part B of amine blends, is the key to formulating highly fillable and sprayable polyurea
coatings. The important aspect of the dispersion of functional fillers is the application of vacuum.
Polyurea (PUA) coatings that undergo continuous and iterative development are revealed to be more durable,
resistant to stains, and emit fewer VOCs when modified with silicone and appropriately formulated [33]. Addi-
tionally, Everest Systems has introduced EverMax Polyurea, a flexible and tough coating for commercial roofing
applications, which is highly resistant to mechanical damage [34].
9.2.6
Silicones: silanes, TEOS, PDMS, elastomers
Silicone monomers, resins, and polymers as a unique non-epoxy platform besides PUR, acrylic, or polyester com-
plement epoxy systems in heat- and chemical-resistance (primarily associated with inorganic Si-O-Si polymers)
and in flexibility (primarily associated with elastomers), thereby diversifying and enriching industrial coating for-
mulation and applications. For clarification on definitions, silicon (Si) refers to an element, silanes (SiH4R4-x) of
hydrides (i.e., Si-H with a bond energy of 393 less than 413 kJ/mol for C-H) are silicon monomers with organic and
inorganic substituents, and silanols (Si-OH) and siloxanes of Si-O-Si linkages are functional groups, respectively.
The Si-O bond energy is 452 kJ/mol, which is significantly higher than the C-O bond’s 358 kJ/mol; this is one of
the reasons why silicones are stronger in thermal resistance. Siloxanes that are equal to silicones are referred to as
Si-O lattice-based polymers; silicates are reaction products of inorganic silanes (e.g., tetraethoxysilane or TEOS,
tetramethoxysilane or TMOS, etc.) with metal hydroxides. TEOS or similar compounds, and ethyl polysilicates
or similar compounds are representative of unhydrolyzed and partially hydrolyzed silane or silicate monomers,
respectively, as described in Figure 9.10.
There are a number of TEOS grades of increasing purity (i.e., minimally hydrolyzed levels), such as Evonik’s
Silbond® condensed (96.5%), pure (99.0%), electronic (e)-grade (99.8%), low boron e-grade (99.8%), and UHP
(ultra-high purity, 99.99%), which are all categorized as containing ≥28% silica. TEOS can be utilized to formulate
sol-gel systems for a variety of high-performance applications, including highly reflective coatings for LEDs (for
brighter and more efficient lighting) and solar (for cooling) reflection. On the other hand, for partially hydrolyzed
ethyl polysilicate grades or silicates (Figure 9.10), they are categorized in terms of VOC from free to high, which
corresponds to the silica content from minimal to maximal; accordingly, Evonik’s Dynasylan SIVO 140 is a
VOC-free variant with 15% SiO2, Silbond H-6C is a low-VOC with 18% SiO2, Silbond HT-33 is a high-VOC with
33% SiO2, and Silbond 40/50 is a higher VOC with 40/50% SiO2, respectively. Partially hydrolyzed silicates and
combinations can be employed to formulate zinc-rich primers and paints.
In addition, substituted and/or functionalized silanes and/or silicates (such as numerous PDMSs or poly-
dimethylsiloxanes) can be utilized to create organo-functional silanes as coupling agents and/or adhesion
promoters (such as for primers) and elastomeric coatings and adhesives, which will be discussed following
sol-gel and zinc-rich. Specifically, non-organo-reactive alkoxysilanes are those that can impart modifications
to inorganic surfaces, such as hydrophobicity, organic compatibility, and reduced surface energy. Moreover,
functionalized or substituted silanes, as organo-reactive types, are readily used as coupling agents in adhesives for
adhesion. Still specifically, and as outlined in Figure 9.10, organo-functional silanes (including amino-, epoxide-,
mercapto-reactivities, etc.) are also readily employed as crosslinking agents in coatings and elastomers. In
general, polymeric siloxanes and silanes with both carbinol (C-OH) and amine functionalities have a broad and
compatible application in bulk coating resin chemistry. After discussing zinc primer, a silane primer formulation
is described. This subsection concludes with chemistry and case studies on silicone adhesives and thermal

interface materials (TIMs) based on peroxide condensation between methylsilyol groups and hydrosilylation
addition reactions between silicon hydrides (SiH) and vinyl-functional (C=C) PDMS resins. TEOS and similar
compounds act as crosslinking agents for silicone polymers when SiH hydrides are present in the chemical
structure. Butyl carbitol, xylol, and others (e.g., PGMA, hexane) are typical solvents for silicone monomers,
resins, and prepolymers. Notably, Silikopon EF (100% solids, ∼1,500 cPs) with epoxide and hydrolysable Si-OR
groups is a siloxane-epoxy resin developed for 2K solvent-free silicone-epoxy hybrid topcoats, which are NISO,
to be cured by a dual functional amino alkoxy silane, such as AMEO (i.e., APTEOS; refer to Figure 9.15-d2), on
substrate surfaces, including DTM (direct-to-metal) in particular.
Since the 1980s, sol-gel technology has been attracting significant industrial attention and applications world-
wide. Sol-gel ceramic coatings are also referred to as silicon esters or alkyl silicates [35, 36] with or without the
addition of fillers; they involve the conversion of organic silica gels into an inorganic silica network full of Si-O-Si
linkages (i.e., siloxanes) under intended or controlled conditions. In other words, silicate sol-gels are a method for
preparing specialty metal oxide glasses and ceramics by hydrolyzing a chemical precursor (such as TEOS, TMOS,
and so on) or a mixture of these chemical precursors [37] that sequentially pass through a solution state and a gel
state before dehydrating to a solid state. End uses include protective coatings such as zinc dust paints for corrosion
resistance, dielectric and insulating materials such as UV reflective coatings for LED lighting and solar cooling,
high-heat resistance, and high-strength ceramics, among others.
TEOS (tetraethyl silicate) with the formula Si(OC2H5)4 and similar compounds are excellent and easy precur-
sors for sol-gel coatings, which involve three major steps: i) partial hydrolysis of TEOS that generates reactive
monomers, ii) polycondensation of the monomers that generates colloid-like silicate oligomers (sol formation),
and iii) additional hydrolysis that promotes polymerization and crosslinking, resulting in a three-dimensional
matrix (gel formation). According to the quantitative relationships summarized in Figure 9.11, and assuming

Mechanisms and molar/mass stoichiometries consolidated of TEOS hydrolysis, namely Si(OR)4 + 4H2O →

Si(OH)4 →SiO2 + 2H2O, which produces a silicate prepolymer at 100% and 50% hydrolysis, respectively.
100% solids or purity of the TEOS precursor, it is theoretically possible to calculate the amount of pure water in
moles, or pbw required to produce a silicate prepolymer at any given degree of hydrolysis (DH) from 0 to 100%,
including VOCs due to ethanol release from the entire process. However, it is more prudent to measure (as opposed
to calculate) actual VOCs at application in the field, given that mass changes of volatiles occur during the curing
process.
Table 9.10 showcases a real-world formulation in which the quantities of each and every ingredient necessary
for the effective manufacture of a sol-gel prepolymer are experimentally determined due to variations in purity,
solids, and conditions. Since water and TEOS are otherwise mutually immiscible, a volatile alcohol co-solvent
such as ethanol (which is also the byproduct) is commonly used in a sol-gel prepolymer system. The following
processing sequences and parameters are preferred: first, combine ethanol and water, then add acid; then, place
TEOS in a reactor (such as a beaker) and stir; last, add the acidified ethanol and water mixture and stir for 60 min.
Lastly, heat to 55 ∘C and stir gently with the top open until completion (which can take days depending on the
volume) in an air-circulating hood, that is, water- and ethanol-free at 100% solids. Hydrolysis must be properly
and quantitatively controlled, that is, by precise water loading and pH adjustment (e.g., a molar ratio of TEOS
to DI water to concentrated HCl at 1.00: 1.05: 0.05 is effective, Table 9.10) to yield a working prepolymer that is

typically viscous and transparent, readily used as a binder to make coatings by addition of solvents, pigments,
and additives, as required (also detailed in Table 9.10). Such prepolymers are often stable at room temperature for
a specific period of time if maintained in an airtight container; however, they are preferably stowed in a freezer
and transported in cold containers. If properly formulated, other substituted silanes and PDMSs can be utilized as
modifiers to improve the structural properties of sol-gel prepolymers.
Viscosity and stability (i.e., viscosity rise against temperature over time) of resultant sol-gel prepolymers (PPs)
can be evaluated in situ, for example, using an ARES G2 rheometer, isothermally, or according to a tempera-
ture ramp, if necessary, to simulate end-application circumstances. Viscosity is linearly proportional to the degree
of hydrolysis. KR® TTS from Kenrich Petrochemicals was discovered to stabilize the viscosity of PPs at ambient
temperature, but it slightly degraded reflectivity if overloaded, such as at more than 0.40% by weight of the final
coating. Additionally, the silica content of PPs can be readily determined by TGA analysis, which is then used to
specify the loading amount of the TiO2 white pigment at an optimal ratio of the silica content to TiO2 (Table 9.10)
for reflectivity greater than 91% of UV/visible light at 420–780 nm (Figure 9.12a). DGBE (i.e., diethylene glycol
butyl ether) is incrementally introduced at 7–10% depending on the coating viscosity desired for screen printing
(such as 180 mesh) onto panels. The final coating containing the PPs can be homogenized in small quantities
(such as one kilogram) using a speed mixer (such as at 800 rpm for 30 sec). In the event of a highly filled sol-gel
coating, a viscosity equal to or greater than 10,000 cPs is optimal for screenability (3–6 mils). Curing at 150 ∘C for

30–60 min in a ventilated oven is sufficient. It should be noted that the HCl acid is no longer a concern retained
in the uncured or cured systems because water and moisture are no longer present.
In this situation, hydrolysis is a precondition for application; however, actual hydrolysis may not be straightfor-
ward due to the fact that silica in the form of SiO2 is never created and various intermediate species of polysilicates
are synthesized instead. As the reaction proceeds, the MW and chain length of polysilicates increase until the
majority of ethyl groups are driven off and a non-linear network of Si-O-Si remains. This phenomenon can be
witnessed when the liquid silicate/water mixture becomes more viscous, gels, and transforms into white silica
flakes upon exposure to heat. Several parameters control hydrolysis, condensation, and polymerization, includ-
ing the molar ratio of water to alkoxides, choice of solvents, temperature, and pH (or the concentration of an
acid or base catalyst). Depending on these variables, either a linear polymeric gel or a branched polymeric gel
with greater crosslinking can be generated; as the polymerization reaction progresses, a homogeneous network is
developed. In the majority of instances, condensation commences before hydrolysis is complete; however, condi-
tions such as pH, the H2O/Si molar ratio (R), and catalysts can force hydrolysis to complete prior to condensation.
For example, at a pH = 7, the hydrolysis rate is typically the lowest (refer to Figure 10.11b in Chapter 10). An
increase in the R value encourages hydrolysis; moreover, under-stoichiometric addition of water (R ≪2) favors
the alcohol-producing hydrolysis, whereas R > 2.28 favors the water-forming condensation. The nature and con-
centration of the applied catalyst drive different reaction mechanisms. An acid catalyst (e.g., concentrated HCl)
involves a protonated silanol species at an e-donating group stabilized transition state, resulting in a primarily
linear and randomly branched polymer (flexible); on the other hand, a basic catalyst (e.g., ammonia) promotes
the attack of a nucleophilic deprotonated silanol on a neutral silicic acid, leading to highly branched clutter (very
brittle). In an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, (RO)3SiOH condenses more quickly than (RO)2Si(OH)2, which condenses
more quickly than (RO)Si(OH)3.
LED application testing demonstrated that these ceramic inks are superior to standard white solder masks,
which yellowed unfavorably when subjected to O2 plasma cleaning of wafers. Micro-morphology or surface pat-
terns were evident under SEM (Figures 9.12b/c), exhibiting excellent reflectance performance over a wide wave-
length range (Figure 9.12a). The direct-to-aluminum coating film was tough, developed excellent adhesion and
insulation, and was capable of maintaining thermal stability up to 600 ∘C and passing the 85/85 test of 1,000
hours. Nisdom/TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.) Lighting was one of the leading customers;
in addition to DuPont’s products, Furokawa’s RG-12-6 (2K, mixing ratio 50: 1) and Asahi Rubber’s PR-2903-7N
(4K, mixing ratio 125: 60: 15: 0.4) were also competitive products of a similar chemistry on the market. These
TEOS-derived sol-gel paints are alternatives for white solar reflecting coatings (consisting, from bottom to top, of
substrate, exterior hydrophilic putty, exterior primer, solar reflecting paint, and photocatalytic varnish) that have
the common problem of marginal adhesion. Notably, the worldwide solar energy market was estimated to be USD
52.5 billion in 2018 and was projected to reach USD 223.3 billion by 2026. In the United States alone, in 2020,
about 78 GW (gigawatts) of solar capacity have been installed, enough to power 14.5 million households.
Sol-gel coatings and moisture-curable siloxane coatings, such as zinc-rich primers and paints, share the same
fundamental chemistry. Following the initial processing state, hydrolysis and condensation proceed simultane-
ously under the catalysis of preferably acids or other substances such as borates. However, their reaction rates
can be affected independently. By decreasing the pH, condensation is inhibited, allowing hydrolysates to remain
stable for relatively extended periods (6–12 months) without gelling. The gelling time is dependent on a range of
factors, the most important of which are the SiO2 concentration, the DH, the kind of solvent(s), and the storage
temperature. The equilibrium can be maintained or disturbed by, for example, a change in pH or the evaporation
of solvent(s), causing condensation and the solution to solidify after a brief period of time. The optimal balance
between the highest possible hydrolysis rate and the lowest possible condensation rate range for the synthesis of
prepolymers is between pH values 4 and 5 [38]. Such mechanisms are utilized for 2K zinc dust paints, the simplest
instance in which the binder is a hydrolysate in an alcoholic solution. In accordance with this, zinc dust and, if

necessary, extenders, anti-settling agents, colorants, etc. are added. The pH increases as a result of the consump-
tion of acids by zinc (Zn + HCl →ZnCl2 + H2↑). As depicted in Figure 9.13, condensation occurs, and the mixture
solidifies into a silicate matrix containing Zn particles in covalently bonded and physically dispersed forms. Zinc
dust paints are particularly suited for applications involving high atmospheric humidity and high temperatures
since these conditions facilitate hardening, which explains their widespread use in maritime tropical locations for
corrosion protection.
Continuous efforts have been dedicated to the development and improvement of silicate binders for 1/2K paints
(1K is rare and challenging), which must be completely compatible with active pigments/fillers such as zinc dust
(e.g., supplied by US Zinc or Meadowbrook Co.) so that a 1/2K mixture of ethyl silicate or others and zinc can be
stored indefinitely without water. By employing partially hydrolyzed TEOS under controlled mixing conditions,
a robust 1/2K polysilicate coating can be produced; there are a few potential variations or variables when formu-
lating 1K batch systems (to be made on demand if possible) as opposed to 2K batch systems. The formulation
and manufacture of 1/2K zinc dust paints are exemplified in Table 9.11, where ingredients, including a trimethyl
borate (weak Lewis acid) curing agent, are loaded in the specified part. QC data and paint characteristics, includ-
ing solids, VOCs, PVC, and zinc dust in the cured film, are estimated for reference purposes, taking into account
alcohol-releasing silicate hydrolysis and condensation. Micronized silica quartz as part of the inert fillers might
be substituted by offsets such as Minusil 40 or Msil 1240. Step-by-step alkyl silicates, including Silbond® HT-28A
(or alternatively HT-33) and Silbond® 40, catalysts or hardeners, and solvents, are blended to the appropriate con-
centration. The resultant dispersions are sensitive to moisture; that is, the quantity of water present or exposed
impacts the DH of −OR groups, thus influencing reactivity and storage stability. Under steady stirring, zinc dust
is added slowly to the binder blend at a volumetric ratio of 4–5: 1 or as formulated to make a ready-to-use zinc
dust paint. Such self-curing inorganic zinc paints based on ethyl-silicates have been extensively used for many
years and, over time, have proven to be the most effective form of corrosion protection for large steel structures,
ship-building, and other large scale commercial applications in marine and other corrosive environments. These
properties and advantages include, but are not limited to, curing effectively over a wide range of temperatures and
humidity; providing excellent adhesion as the binder reacts chemically with the clean base steel; withstanding heat
up to 400 ∘C as a result of the inorganic zinc; resisting weather, UV, IR, rain, and nearly all organic solvents; being
simple to top coat with epoxy, alkyd, or acrylic as the coating is alkali free; continuing to provide protection even
after topcoats are abraded; and welding easily, even at lower film thickness. Overall, ethyl-silicate-based zinc-rich
primers and paints find widespread use in marine and industrial coatings, high-temperature applications, and the
lining of containers and tankers. Zinc dust paints can also be used as UV-resistant topcoats.
Organo-functional silanes and silicates are dual reactive (refer to Figure 10.9a in Chapter 10): in one regard,
Si-OR groups hydrolyze into silanols that form stable condensation products by reacting or coupling slowly with

NOTE: Zinc dust is optionally admixed before application; watertight for 1K
hydroxyls from water, moisture, and metal surfaces; in another regard, the organo-functional groups modify the
wetting and adhesion characteristics of bulk coatings by reacting with resins and other ingredients if added as an
additive, or with substrates if formulated and applied as a primer, or with both. In other words, organo-functional
silanes are extensively employed as additives and primers for interfacial adhesion and bulky cohesion to bind
biomaterials, immobilize catalysts, provide crosslinking, and enhance polymer and particle dispersion. Several
formulation case studies, regardless of crosslinking chemistry, as described earlier incorporate the use of silanes as
additives, such as A-187 in 2K epoxy (refer to Table 6.2 in Chapter 6), A-137 in 2K acrylate (refer to Table 9.8), and
A-187 in 2K polyurea (refer to Table 9.9), to name a few, as an integrally accepted formulation technique. Table 9.12
outlines a liquid primer made of silane and titanate blends at 10% active (by weight) for priming substrate surfaces
prior to bonding. Most white metals, glass, cured silicone rubber, silicone resin laminates, phenolics, and polyester
are applicable substrates.
For metal substrates such as steel and aluminum, this silane-mixed primer (Table 9.12) can be easily and effec-
tively applied using Kimwipe, a brush, spray, or dip, as needed, to the cleaned substrate surfaces (such as lap-shear
adherents) at room temperature for 90 min prior to the application of a topcoat or an adhesive. Specifically, ATMOS
is a vinyl functional silane or orthosilicate as an adhesion promoter best suited for vinyl polyaddition silicones
(which will be discussed next), TPOS is tetrapropyl orthosilicate, and Tyzor TBT is titanium (IV) butoxide, one of
the most versatile and highly reactive organic titanates, used synergically to promote adhesion and crosslinking
of polymers and/or to form a polymeric titanium dioxide layer on substrates and/or to function as a Lewis acid
catalyst in polymerization processes (if any).
The last topic of silicones as a non-epoxy platform in this subsection is silicone elastomers or rubber based pri-
marily on polycondensation of oxime-cured and peroxide-induced siloxanes as well as hydrosilylation reactions of

vinyl-functional siloxanes and silicon hydrides (SiH, as the crosslinker), as depicted in Figures 9.14a/b/c, respec-
tively. Oxime silane-based crosslinkers are commonly employed for producing neutral moisture-curing silicone
sealants, in which OH-functionalized (i.e., silanol-functional) silicone resins are crosslinked to obtain a silicone
elastomer under the effect of a catalyst or moisture (Figure 9.14a). Oxime crosslinking releases no acetic acid or
amines, but 2-butanone oxime; as a result, oximino crosslinkers can be utilized even on sensitive substrates such
as marble. Silicone elastomers can also be produced through condensations between Si-CH3 groups (with a strong
and sharp FTIR signal at around 1,260 cm−1) that are often initiated by organic peroxides and release the neces-
sary alcohol (Figure 9.14b). However, catalyzed (e.g., by Karstedt catalysts; refer to Figure 9.21m) poly-addition
hydrosilylation reactions (Figure 9.14c) gradually overtake peroxide-based formulation method. Because they are
often made by crosslinking linear PDMS precursors, SiH (such as the one depicted in Figure 9.14e)- vulcanized
elastomers are often highly flexible and soft. If multifunctional vinyl PDMS resins or prepolymers (such as the one
depicted in Figure 9.14d) are combined with the proper hydride-to-vinyl ratio in formulation, it is also possible
to create elastomeric materials with high hardness. Silicone elastomer chemistry is versatile, allowing thermal
interface materials (TIMs) of different softness or hardness to be formulated as 1/2K systems, if required, based
on specific compositional designs. Silicone elastomers are advantageously heat-stable and highly resistant to the
majority of chemicals, heat, ozone, UV light, and other aging processes; downsides include possibly low tensile
strength, being sensitive to fatigue from cycling loads, and incompatibility with organic polymers.
HCR (i.e., high-consistency silicone rubber) and FSR (i.e., fluorosilicone rubber) have emerged to withstand
temperatures up to 220 ∘C in order to keep up with changes in the automotive, aviation, and aerospace industries,
where high temperature and chemical resistance are required. As engineered FVMQ precursors (Figure 9.14f)
are thermally crosslinked, recent advancements in FSR technology have increased the upper service temperature
performance to 240 ∘C, with a peak temperature of 250 ∘C [41]. HCR is resistant to solvents and resilient after elon-
gation or compression; FSR is highly resistant to fuel, oil, and other chemicals and has excellent high-temperature
stability. HCR and FSR can be viably produced utilizing vinyl-specific peroxides (such as dicumyl peroxide) that
are O2 sensitive, hot air-curing peroxides that are O2 insensitive, or hydrosilylation of 1K (using encapsulated

Pt) and 2K cure. As for the most prevalent liquid silicone rubber (abbreviated LSR), the use of SiH crosslinkers
and incorporation of inhibitors (optional if 2K and required if 1K) via hydrosilylation is nearly the only formula-
tion chemistry implemented industrially, although peroxides are a possibility. 1-ethynylcyclohexanol (ETCH) is
representative of many effective inhibitors containing C≡C groups. Part A (or the A-side) of a 2K LSR formula-
tion typically consists of silicone prepolymers, Pt catalysts, and optionally inhibitors, while Part B (or the B-side)
consists of SiH crosslinkers and inhibitors, respectively.
Silicone materials, especially elastomers, have been widely accepted for use in automotive, food handling, elec-
tronics, medical (such as dentistry), and construction applications, among others, for a very long time. This is
because silicone rubber or elastomers with temperature-resilient siloxane linkages (Si-O-Si) have a broad working
temperature range (e.g., −75 to 260 ∘C), allowing them to withstand high and low temperatures. Silicone products
also exhibit weathering and chemical resistance comparable to or exceeding that of PURs and acrylics, mak-
ing them appropriate for a variety of outdoor and industrial applications; nevertheless, silicone adhesives and
sealants lack the tensile strength of epoxy and acrylic resins in general. Silicone resins are primarily supplied
by Shin-Etsu Silicone, AB Specialty Silicones, Nusil of Avantor, Dow Corning, and many more. Gelest Exsil-100
silica nanoparticle-reinforced elastomer without crosslinking is capable of being stretched fifty times its origi-
nal size before breaking. In addition, DC 2405 resins are regarded as room-temperature curable silicones for
high-temperature applications, for example, curing at 20 ∘C for 60 min when catalyzed by 0.5% TnBT (i.e., Tyzor
TBT; refer to Table 9.12), as is DC US-CF-2403, with the exception of inferior impact resistance. As previously
discussed, DowsilTM 3055 resins (refer to Table 2.2i and Figure 2.4 in Chapter 2) deliver amine functionality that
readily reacts with urethane, epoxy, polyester, or other organic resins. In addition, UBE America’s polytitanocar-
bosilanes are intended for super-high temperature (HT) resistance up to 800 ∘C (for instance, the liquid/xylene
Tyranno Coat is subjected to 5 min of air drying followed by 10 min of curing at a minimum temperature of 250 ∘C).
DowsilTM EG-4000, −4100, and −4120 are designed for 2K heat-resistant dielectric gels that are cured at 150 ∘C

for one hour and exhibit no cracking or delamination at 215 ∘C for up to 3,000 hours. Likewise, Bluestar Sili-
cones’ BluesilTM RES 6405 and 6405X are HT silicone resins (solvent-based, ∼52% solids) that can be formulated
as coatings curable at 200–300 ∘C for 1–2 hours in order to withstand temperatures up to 600 ∘C.
Silicone rubber adhesives and sealants that cure at room temperature (1K is referred to as RTV-1, and 2K as
RTV-2) are frequently used for electrical insulation, marine applications, sealing, and waterproofing. The tight,
flexible seal of silicone adhesives has made them a popular solution for a vast array of end-uses. For example,
aquarium silicone adhesives prevent tanks from leaking and attach rocks, curing in around seven days while
maintaining their barrier while tacky. One-component (1K) systems cure when exposed to air at a rate dependent
on DFT and retain their elasticity across a broad temperature range; two-component (2K) systems cure instantly
when mixed (though requiring good mixing and flow before gelling). FSR adhesives (1/2K) adhere well to all
substrate types, and their cure responses are comparable to those of standard silicone adhesives. Fast cure silicones
are usually 2K platinum systems that are vinyl-functional, requiring no air or moisture and curing for nearly
24 hours; the fastest silicone curing time is approximately 10 min. UV-curing silicone adhesives are solvent-free
systems with photo-initiators that activate the curing process in a matter of seconds; LED curing (with UV and
visible light ranges of 365 to 395 nm and 405 to 460 nm, respectively) offers uniform lighting throughout the process
and energy efficiency, similar to a UV process.
A 1K formulation of LSR adhesives as thermal interface materials (TIMs) is exemplified in Table 9.13, wherein
thermally conductive alumina was highly filled at 800 phr to provide a thermal conductivity of 2.0 W/m-∘K
(4.0 W/m-∘K expected if 1,200 phr), and DAM (i.e., diallyl maleate) was loaded at 0.20 phr as a cure inhibitor.
Notably, this formulation is comparable to Dow Corning 1-4173, which is also a 1K, solvent-free, thermally
conductive adhesive. In general, crosslinking will not commence until DAM flashes off under specified curing
conditions, such as being molded at 5 mil thickness and cured at 150 ∘C for 15 min. In other words, inhibitors of
choice are added in sufficient quantities to determine the desired pot life and cure times of LSR adhesives. MBO
(i.e., 2-methyl-3-butyn-2-ol), DEM (i.e., diethyl maleate), and TMVCTS (i.e., tetramethylvinylcyclotetrasiloxane)
[43] are all effective inhibitors in addition to ETCH and DAM (Table 9.13). It should be emphasized that silane
adhesion promoters can always be used optionally in formulations, subject to validation if required. Regarding
the other compositions in Table 9.13, low-viscosity Andisil VS 100 at 70 pbw functioned as the vinyl-functional
polymeric silicone precursor, and Andisil XL-1B at 30 pbw served as the hydride crosslinker, resulting in a
SiH to C=C ratio of 1.10: 1 and a cured Shore-oo hardness of 80. Hardness is determined by the hydride/vinyl
index, which ranges from 2.0–5.0: 1 and is always subject to optimization based on the intended hardness for
end uses. Andisil 172 is a silane that contains 25 ppm Pt as the catalyst, which is also a compositional variable

that determines the cure schedules of the formulation. The corresponding makeup process is as follows: the
DAM inhibitor is added into the solvents (if any are used depending on final viscosity for moldability), then
the vinyl-functional PDMS is loaded, followed by the Pt catalyst and the alumina filler (e.g., Almatis’ A 3500
SG of classified particle sizes ranging 1–10 μm), and the hydride crosslinker is loaded last, in the listed order.
The produced adhesive resembles a high-viscosity dough suitable for being pressed and molded. In addition
to Pt and tin catalysts, there are adhesives that are cured by peroxides (i.e., undergo free-radical reactions of
vinyl-functional groups), but they must be implemented as 2K systems. Dow Corning 3-6060, for instance, is a
2K silicone adhesive cured by a peroxide solution that boasts great adhesion on a range of substrates. Notably,
an offset resin package is included in Table 9.13 for reference; a 2K alternative can be reconstructed without
the addition of inhibitors using Andisil VS1000 at 90 pbw in Part A and Andisil XL-120 at 10 pbw in Part B,
respectively, with the basis of per 100 resin total staying unchanged.
Table 9.14 illustrates a 2K formulation of a thermally conductive silicone adhesive that may also be used as a
TIM or a potting compound utilizing the same hydride (SiH) and vinyl (C=C) cure chemistry. It was formulated
to have an overall mixing ratio of Part A to Part B of 1: 1 by volume (such as via 2-part tubes), to use alumina
(such as A 3000 FL of particle size/D50 = 2.7 μm) at 700 phr in each part to achieve a thermal conductivity of
up to 2.0 W/m-∘K, and to include O9818.3 as an adhesion promoter at 6.0 phr in each part. Prior to loading, the
surface of Almatis’ A 3000 FL alumina (i.e., the composition of a7) was treated with Silquest A-137 (refer to Table
8.2 in Chapter 8) to ensure compatibility. In place of A-137, a vinyl-functional silane (such as Silquest A-172),
simply O9818.3, or another appropriate silane can be utilized for alumina surface treatment. O9818.3 (i.e., the
compositions of a2/b1) refers to United Chemical Technologies’ (UCT) PETRARCH O9818.3, an octenyl functional

silane with a vinyl functionality of 4.3 meq/g that reacts with hydrides to contribute to the crosslinked structure.
In Part A, the catalyst (i.e., a3 PC-075) and the inhibitor (i.e., a4 PS-925) were combined with the vinyl-functional
silicone precursor (i.e., a1 VEB-100D), while in Part B, the crosslinker (i.e., b2 XL-1) and the chain extender (i.e.,
b3 SF-305) were loaded. Extra Pt catalyst can be added to accelerate the curing process (i.e., reduce the cure time
at a given cure temperature); however, this reduces the material’s hardness. Optionally, or if desired, the inhibitor
may be introduced concurrently with the crosslinker in Part B. Gelest’s DMS-V21 is an equivalent to VEB-100D, for
example, and all other ingredients are listed with commercial alternatives (in brackets of Table 9.14). Glass beads
with a diameter of 5 mils were used to ensure a bond line or a thickness of 5 mils under the molding pressure.
The hydride-to-vinyl ratio for this 2K formulation (Table 9.14) is determined to be 1.75 when Parts A and B are
combined at the intended mixing ratio of 1: 1, including 5.39 g of O9818.3 (corresponding to 23.177 meq C=C)
used to treat 700 phr of alumina in each part. The final adhesive density was approximately 2.80 g/ml. Defined by
time to gel (i.e., tgel), the pot life at room temperature was approximately 15 min, as dictated by the loading level of
the inhibitor at 0.20 phr, which corresponds to 1,000 ppm. The pot life can be correspondingly increased to 60 min
at 2,000 ppm, 90 min at 3,000 ppm, and 110 min at 4,000 ppm (equivalent to 0.80 phr of the PS-925 inhibitor),
respectively. Gel times were measured using Brookfield viscosity using an F-t bar spindle at 2 rpm or 20 rpm,
and tgel was recorded once the viscosity doubled. Alternately, tgel’s were determined by isothermal rheology DMA
conducted at 25 ∘C, 1.0 Hz, 1.0% strain, and 4-cm plates; the gap of 1,000 to 1,500 μm between plates was filled
without overflowing, and the tgel to reach Tan𝛿= 1 (i.e., G′ = G′′) or for the storage modulus (G′) to reach 90% of
its final (i.e., G′
max) was determined. Typically, adhesive samples were dispensed into the rheometer using 2-part
tubes produced in advance of Parts A and B. Notably, the addition of fumed silica would render the adhesive
rheologically thixotropic.
As coating binder resins, polysilazanes and polysiloxazanes are an additional class of silicone materials that
should be included under the topic of this subsection. These polymers have Si-NH-Si bonds in their backbone struc-
tures, as opposed to Si-O-Si linkages that are typical of polysiloxanes. Considering bonding strength and stability,
the recorded Si-N bond energy is 355 kJ/mol, which is lower than the evaluated Si-O bond energy of 452 kJ/mol.
Notably, there are two types of polysilazanes: inorganic PHPS (i.e., perhydropolysilazanes containing −SiH2-NH−,
such as IOTA-PHPS in Figure 9.15a) and organic polysilazanes (i.e., abbreviated OPSZ that are structurally dis-
tinguished by −SiR2-NH−, where pendent R groups are typically hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, and/or vinyl substitutions,
such as Durazane 1800 in Figure 9.15b). As depicted in Figure 9.15c, hydrophilic PHPS undergoes cure reactions
in air even at room temperature, including hydrolysis of Si-NH-Si with H2O releasing NH3 and oxidation of Si-H
with O2 releasing H2, which solidify into a hard and dense SiO2 network. In contrast, OPSZ can be cured in a
similar manner (when SiH is at least partially available), in addition to the fact that compositional APTEOS (i.e.,
3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane) simultaneously undergoes hydrolysis and condensation (as TEOS does; refer to
Figure 9.11) to produce a siloxane matrix as well, as illustrated in Figure 9.15d. Utilization of appropriate cata-
lysts aids in the promotion of supplemental curing reactions; for example, Pt or Pd salts or their complexes can be
employed to catalyze the hydrosilylation of SiH and Si-CH=CH2 groups in OPSZ (Figures 9.14c/9.15b).
Both PHPS or OPSZ grades are anticipated to shrink in their cured volume; however, polysilazanes tend to form
a hard, heat-stable, scratch- and weather-resistant coating layer with excellent adhesion to a variety of substrates,
including metals, glasses, ceramics, and plastics, when crosslinked at ambient (10–40 ∘C) or elevated temperatures
(100–200 ∘C and preferably 120–180 ∘C). Notably, PHPS are effective at filling gaps, and OPSZ provides long-lasting
surface protection; both are easy to clean and possess greater heat resistance and hardness than polysiloxanes
and fluoropolymers. In addition to free-radical initiators such as peroxides or azo compounds, polysilazanes can
be cured by irradiation with IR ideally in the range of 7–15 μm (i.e., the lower end of far-IR) or 1–3 μm (i.e.,
mid-IR) for substrate absorption or UV preferably in the range of 300–500 nm. Noteworthily, NIR (near-IR)-curable
(free-radically) aqueous coatings have been recently disclosed using cyanin and iodonium salts [44]. In many
aspects of performance, polysilazane-based coatings are comparable or superior to polysiloxane-based coatings.
Polysilazanes as a coating binder and polymeric ceramic precursor have been extensively studied and reported for

a variety of high-performing barrier applications, such as non-yellowing extreme high-temperature resistance over
300 ∘C up to 800 ∘C [45, 46], mold release or nonstick PTFE coatings [47], corrosion protection and anti-graffiti
properties [48], hydrophobicity and repellency derived particularly from OPSZ [49], hybrids with polybutadiene
for addressing brittleness to allow DFT up to 50 μm [50] (DFT is otherwise limited to 5–10 μm due to cracking),
etc., if formulation (alone or in combination), application, and curing are appropriately executed for desired end
uses. Novel resins, formulations (including hybrids), and applications of polysilazanes are expected to continue
to emerge; a comprehensive product portfolio of polysilazanes is commercially available, such as Merck KGaA’s
Durazane® series, durXtreme’s TPdur®, and IOTA Silicone Oil’s offsets, among others.
In conclusion, it is important to note that silanol-functional (Si-OH) silicones, such as DowsilTM Z-6018, readily
self-condensate during storage or baking, resulting in the formation of an insoluble haze. Those having methoxy
(Si-OCH3) functionality, such as DowsilTM 3037 and 3074, however, do not undergo direct self-condensation; they
only react with hydroxyl groups (i.e., hydrolysis), thereby generating co-polymers with more consistent quality.

Non-Epoxy Hybrids
Three factors are required for a coating formula to be practically effective, at least for its intended applica-
tions: competitive performance, reasonable cost, and simple manufacturability at production scales. With

formulation-driven performance in mind, the strategy of hybrid coatings on major non-epoxy platforms, that
is, isocyanates/PURs, acrylics/acrylates, polyesters/alkyds, silicones, BMIs, and possibly others, remains vital to
seek synergies out of dissimilar cure reactions. The synergies are improved or most durable possible physical and
chemical properties, such as adhesion, extreme high Tg and thermal stability, cohesive toughening, bulk flexibility,
fast cure responses, low-temperature cure capability, moisture and weathering resistance, reduced or eliminated
VOC concerns, and so forth. There are situations when it is not necessarily impossible to attain exceptional
or unmatched characteristics. For instance, hybrid BOX-BMI fusion-bonded powder coatings, especially when
formulated at a 2: 1 molar ratio and devoid of any epoxy constituents, have been unexpectedly uncovered to have
superior impermeability and wet adhesion (refer to Table 7.9 in Chapter 7 of phenolic coatings). In many hybrid
cases, incompatibility is a situational challenge that must be carefully addressed throughout the entire processing
cycle, from mixing/compounding to application through curing/baking; otherwise, phase separation and other
detrimental effects on eventual performance are likely to occur. There are a variety of epoxy-free value-added
hybrid formulations, but in this subsection, only a few refreshing examples from the author’s hands-on experience
are offered to highlight inspirational ideas and techniques and the integrity of critical thinking in this aspect.
9.3.1
Phthalonitrile (PN) and BOX-PN hybrids
Similar to the attainability of epoxy-urethane (refer to Figure 9.1) and epoxy-acrylate/BMI hybrids (refer to Figure
8.6 in Chapter 8 and Table 9.3, respectively), epoxy-absent isocyanate-acrylate hybrids can be readily formulated,
for example, by using thiols or amines as co-curing agents catalyzed by phosphines in tandem with photoly-
sis, as investigated by Matsushima et al. [51], despite the fact that isocyanates do not react directly with acry-
lates. These fast-curing systems consist of thiol-isocyanate coupling, thiol-acrylate Michael Addition, and acrylate
homo-polymerization, sequentially and/or concurrently, depending on the curing conditions. A hybrid malonate
polyester and diphenylmethane BMI coating has also been developed through Michael Addition reactions [52].
As additional examples [53, 54], tetra-functional fluorene-modified benzoxazine (BOX) monomers (Figure 9.16a)
are synthesized capable of self-crosslinking and achieving up to a minimum of 256 ∘C and a maximum of 333 ∘C
in terms of Tgs as a result of the synergistic effect of steric fluorene and multi-functional BOXs in the straight
monomeric molecules (i.e., uncatalyzed or unformulated), which appears to outperform fluorene-based epoxies
with regard to Tg (refer to Table 6.17 and Figure 6.19a in Chapter 6). Notably, and consistent with the hybrid
value chain, phthalonitrile (abbreviated PN)-modified BOXs and novolac resins (Figures 9.16b/c) are among the
engineered high-performance polymeric materials. PN (MW 128.1 g/mol, Tm 140–143.0 ∘C) containing two cyano
(−CN)-functional groups is regarded as one of the unique lightweight resins and polymers with metal-equivalent
properties [55], because its conjugated −CN’s undergo self-polymerization under heat, with or without catalysts,
creating phthalocyanines and triazines, as illustrated in Figure 9.16d, and perhaps other matrix structures if PNs
are modified [56].
As illustrated in Figure 9.17a, DSC thermal analysis can directly and explicitly characterize the self-crosslinking
of bulk PN. Specifically, the DSC histogram carried out at 7.0 ∘C/min up to 375 ∘C (i.e., the first scan or the
blue curve) reveals that pure PN melts at roughly 142.3 ∘C (corresponding to the first endothermic peak) and
immediately undergoes intense self-polymerization, which corresponds to the second outstanding endothermic
peak (𝛥H = +329.5 J/g absorbing phenomenal heat and the onset/peak temperatures at 168.4/207.0 ∘C, respec-
tively) while attaining a Tg as high as 345.8 ∘C. The second scan performed at 20 ∘C/min (i.e., the green curve
in Figure 9.17a) verifies not only the completed cure (i.e., there is no longer a discernible exo- or endo-thermic
profile) but also the final Tg, that is, ∼344.4 ∘C, achieved by the first curing scan. In accordance with the auto-
catalytic model, the kinetic parameters of A = 25,000, Ea = 61.60 kJ/mol, m = 0.15, and n = 0 indicate that PN
monomers undergo self-catalyzed crosslinking at a rate that is notably rapid once reactions are thermally initi-
ated, due to the low total reaction order of 0.15. According to the numerical solutions to the kinetic ODE, PN
is fully cured in just 110 sec at 450 ∘F or 232 ∘C. The DSC data presented here are technically valuable due to a

number of other factors: First, for homogeneous systems such as a straight PN precursor, it is conclusive with-
out a doubt that low-temperature cure to achieve a much higher Tg (above the cure temperature) is consistently
actual, which is the complete opposite of what was previously elucidated for heterogeneous epoxy coatings by
Lee [61]. Thus, diffusion-controlled vitrification, which is adversely concerned with heterogeneous epoxies, is
no longer a limiting factor in homogeneous polymeric systems. Second, PN self-crosslinking is an endothermic
(heat-absorbing) process, as opposed to an exothermic (heat-releasing) process, which is typical of epoxy coatings.
Third, PN homo-polymerization is predominately stepwise, unlike epoxy processes, which comprise both step-
wise and chain-growth mechanisms. Fourth, the reaction order n = 0 reveals that PN self-crosslinking is complete
as soon as the curing rate reaches its maximum at Tpeak = 207.0 ∘C, which is exactly what is desired for applied
coatings. Moreover, PN’s endo-/exo-thermic profile and final Tg can be detected simultaneously by a single DSC

test as long as the maximum temperature (e.g., 375 ∘C) to attain is high enough to encompass the finishing Tg
region (∼345.8 ∘C). As experimentally confirmed and in contrast to typical tertiary amine catalysts such as 2MI,
DMAP, and imidazole adducts for epoxies, PN with cyano-functional groups is inert as a curing agent either inde-
pendently or in combination with amine or phenolic crosslinkers in epoxy coatings because it has little or no effect
on thermal cure or gel behaviors. In addition, DSC findings appear to indicate that any anionic ingredients added
into these heterogeneous systems completely inhibit PN homo-polymerization.
However, 100% PN as a binder by itself is difficult to process due to its high crystallinity and low melting viscos-
ity; attempts to study the rheology of bulk PN were abandoned with no data collected because PN failed to adhere
to rheometer plates after melting and before gelation. Consistent with a patent disclosure [62], it was a natural
thought to combine benzoxazine (BOX) and PN for potential processing facilitation, given that BOXs are sticky
in practically all situations and compatible with PN. Consequently, a preliminary formulation of BOX (i.e., Lapox
ARBZ, bisphenol-F-based) and PN was developed, as listed in Table 9.15, with the addition of melamine at a spe-
cific molar ratio of 0.4: 1.0: 0.6, which corresponds to BOX to PN to melamine, respectively. Please note that cure
reactions may not necessarily take place in accordance with such a calculated stoichiometric ratio; the primary
objective of the initial formulation was to determine what, if anything, would happen. As for other components
in the formulation, ADH Pro Coup40 was a 𝛾-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (dual amino-functional)-converted
free-flowing powder offered by Sovereign Technologies LLC, and the post-add (i.e., Aerosil 380) was loaded into
chips after extrusion and before grinding, as is customary for powder coatings. As observed, extrudates from
the extruder (with low temperature settings at 85/85 ∘C for Zones III/IV) were still liquid with low viscosity
but extremely sticky, and upon solidification on the chiller rolls, they were remarkably rigid. The resulting
powder samples were characterized by DSC, as shown in Figure 9.17b, where kinetic parameters were also
determined (i.e., A = 25,000, Ea = 58,220 J/mol, m = 0.97, n = 1.54) for the underlying peak at 259.7 ∘C (i.e., the
fourth exothermic peak on the blue curve performed at 7.0 ∘C/min) of the first scan, which is almost exclusively
correlated to BOX self-crosslinking.
Specifically, the four peaks on the blue curve from the first DSC scan at 7.0 ∘C/min (Figure 9.17b), endothermic
for the first two but exothermic for the last two, are attributed to the melting of BOX at 133.4 ∘C and PN at 160.6 ∘C,
as well as the self-curing of PN at 208.0 ∘C and BOX at 259.7 ∘C, respectively. The interactions of these two bulk
resins more or less raise the onset/peak temperatures, that is, from 168.4/207.1 ∘C in Figure 9.17a to 176.7/208.0 ∘C
in Figure 9.17b for PN, and from 226.4/234.6 ∘C (refer to BX2 in Figure 7.13a of Chapter 7) to 250.9/259.7 ∘C for
BOX in Figure 9.17b, respectively. The overall PN self-curing peak changed from endothermic to exothermic due
to overlaps between PN’s self-curing and the highly exothermic BOX self-polymerization, which occurred partially

concurrently. The second DSC scan performed at 20 ∘C/min (i.e., the green curve in Figure 9.17b) detected dual
high Tgs at 315.8 and 244.6 ∘C, corresponding distinctively to a major domain of PN and a minor one of BOX,
respectively, in this cured hybrid network. BOX’s and PN’s Tgs obtained primarily from self-polymerization and to
a lesser extent from interactions were considerably elevated from 186.8 ∘C (refer to Figure 7.13a in Chapter 7) for
BOX and depressed from 344.4 ∘C (Figure 9.17a) for PN, respectively, when compared to the Tgs of their respective
individual monomers of 100% of their own. Notably, cyano-groups from PN are unreactive toward Ph-OHs from
BOX ring-opening until cationically (i.e., acidically) catalyzed to initiate Pinner reactions leading to the formation
of imino ester salts [63]. Melamine appears to remain intact across the whole range of heats and temperatures,
playing an inactive function in the hybrid formulation, because it does not self-crosslink unless converted into
an MF or HMMM, which are prone to self-curing by nature, as discussed previously. In lieu of melamine, it may
be worthwhile to use a cationic catalyst (such as p-TSA) or an organometallic salt or complex (such as ETPPI or
ZnAcAc) to modify BOX-PN hybrids effectively.
9.3.2
Miscellaneous high-performance polymers
PN-based matrix polymers can be used to develop coatings (including powders), adhesives, molding compounds,
prepregs, sealants, and many others that can withstand high temperatures free of vitrification concerns, such
as 250–350 ∘C, when properly modified, formulated, and cured at relatively low temperatures, for example,
200–250 ∘C and preferably 175–225 ∘C. The resulting coatings would be a viable choice for bridging temperature
gaps between high-performance epoxies (such as Tgs up to 250 ∘C via fluorene-based monomers; refer to Table
6.17 and Figure 6.17 in Chapter 6) and silicones (such as exceeding 350 ∘C via inorganic −Si-O-Si-O-Si−
matrices).
Other competitive composite polymers include, but are not limited to, the following: i) cyclotene (liquid at room
temperature, such as DOW’s CycloteneTM BCB, i.e., benzo cyclobutene resins, Figure 9.18a), which can develop
Tg up to 350–400 ∘C when fully cured (for example, at 250 ∘C for 60 min in an inert atmosphere), but is sensitive
to oxygen at elevated temperatures; ii) PBI (such as HOS-Technik’s Hozole, Figure 9.18b) that has a deflection
temperature of 435 ∘F; iii) PEEK (such as Evonik’s Vestakeep®, Figure 9.18c), a semi-crystalline thermoplastic with
tensile strength up to 145 GPa that can substitute metals; iv) PIs as a class of various polyimides (soluble in NMP or
cyclopentanone [64]) with flexible ether linkages, including PAI (such as Solvay’s Torlon 4000T, Figure 9.18e) and
PEI (such as Sabic’s Ultem® series, Figure 9.18f); and v) PPA (such as Evonik’s Vestamid® HTplus, Figure 9.18g),
a semi-crystalline aromatic amide. Other polyamides include PEA (i.e., polyetherimide, such as Arkema’s Pebax®
MH 1657) and Nylon PA12 (such as Evonik’s Vestamid® series with a maximum tensile strength of 1,400 MPa
or 1.4 GPa). There are a number of excellent references [65, 66] that cover a greater variety of high-performance
polymers.
Cyclotene resins are preferably paired with vinyl-functional silanes, such as AP3000, to achieve enough adhe-
sion to aluminum, copper, and nonmetallic substrates. For temperature stability up to 600 ∘F, PIs and PBIs are
favored over epoxies; PIs tend to lose tackiness as solvents (typically polar NMP, i.e., N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, and
DMA, i.e., dimethylacetamide) evaporate, but PBIs are structurally planar and extremely rigid. PIs and PAIs are
analogously produced from PAAs (Figure 9.18d), which form hetero-N-rings while releasing water upon heating.
Typically, thermoplastic matrices are glass- or fiber-reinforced discontinuously or continuously to increase ten-
sile strength and shear modulus. PPS (also known as polyphenylsulfone, or PPSU) is a thermoplastic with poor
chlorinated hydrocarbon resistance. Specialty acrylic Degaplast® resins are thermoplastics in addition to being
sealing resins for porous materials, including orthopedic applications. Total/Cray Valley’s’ Ricobond® family is
a class of maleic-anhydride-functionalized polybutadienes (i.e., PBDs) that promote adhesion to diverse sub-
strates of peroxide and sulfur-cured systems. Solvay’s Virantage® VW series polyethersulfone (PES) are amorphous
high-temperature sulfone polymers. Solvay’s Hyflon® perfluoropolymers are thermo-processable and universally

resistant to chemicals. Teflon (i.e., PTFE or pertetrafluoroethylene, Figure 9.18h) is a well-known thermoplastic
for coatings that are flexible, heat-resistant, and nonstick.
In addition, PFs (phenolic-formaldehyde) and carbon matrices excel in thermal insulation and stability for
friction and molding applications, ceramic matrices excel in thermal and chemical resistance and low dielectric
constant, and metal matrices (i.e., metal matrix composites, or MMC) excel in high thermal conductivity. Solvay’s
Xydar® G-930 is a glass-reinforced liquid-crystal polymer (LCP) intended for injection molding and electri-
cal/electronic applications. As depicted in Figure 9.18i, liquid crystalline poly(p-phenylene benzo-bis-oxazole)
or PBO nano-composite paper is thermally conductive up to 21.3 W/m-∘K (in-plane) and electrically insulative
up to 350 ∘C when combined with 10% by weight of boron nitride [67], making it potentially applicable for
high-power-density applications including 5G base stations and electronic devices. PBO-derived or Zylon fiber is
regarded as the super fiber of the 21st century, even superseding carbon fiber in terms of its high strength (tensile
and modulus up to 5.8 and 280 GPa, respectively, and even cut resistance) and flame retardancy in addition to its
high heat resistance (up to 600 ∘C).
Debrief A Silanes, silicates, and PDMSs
Sol-gel coatings derived from unhydrolyzed TEOS (refer to Table 9.10) and zinc-rich primers and paints derived
from partially hydrolyzed TEOS or silicates (refer to Table 9.11) are sometimes referred to as inorganic coatings
due to the formation of a dense ceramic or glass film in the form of non-organic SiO2 on substrates. Silicon dioxide,
or silica (SiO2), indicates zero degree of any alkyl substitution with Tg up to 1,500 ∘C, which, in conjunction with
strong Si-O bond strength and UV transparency, imparts super heat and weather resistance, two of silicone coat-
ings’ most significant advantages. Unhydrolyzed TEOS and similar compounds (such as TMOS) are monomers,

as are silanes; siloxanes are typical of those consisting of partial Si-O-Si linkages and higher MWs, such as linear
PDMSs (for example, as lubricants, wetting/leveling agents, etc.) when the repeating unit of n < 500 and gums
(for example, for mar/scratch resistance, anti-blocking, etc.) when n > 1,000, in addition to elastomers, resins, and
others, as structurally illustrated in Figure 9.19.
As discussed (refer to Tables 9.13/9.14), following curing of coatings and adhesives, silicone resins and
elastomers are film forming, flexible, and thermal-/UV-resistant. Other siloxanes include those with EO-/PO-
substituted R1/R2 groups as polyethers, phenyl-/alkyl-/amino-/glycidoxy-/sulfido-substituted organofunctional
grades, etc. Silanol- (such as DOWSILTM RSN-6018) and alkoxy-functional (such as DOWSILTM 3037) molecules
with relatively low MWs are intermediates; silanols readily self-condense, whereas alkoxy-functions do not until
hydrolysis has previously been fulfilled. DOWSILTM RSN-6018, unlike DOWSILTM 3037, can be thermally cured
for coil and can coatings in the absence of catalysts. In other words, alkoxy-functional TEOS or TMOS, silanes,
and siloxanes have a reduced self-condensation tendency, requiring moisture and tin or titanate catalysts such as
TPT (or TiPT) and DBTDL to initiate hydrolysis as a first step. In addition, SiH’s (i.e., silicon hydrides) crosslink
Si-vinyl in hydrosilylation addition reactions if they remain in the R group of silanes and/or in the R1/R2 groups
of siloxanes.
Silanols and alkoxy functionalities can react with specific functional moieties and hydroxyl groups on
organic resins (e.g., polyesters, alkyds, acrylics, phenolics, melamine derivatives, and epoxies) to form NISO
silicone-organic hybrid coatings (refer to Figures 2.4/2.12 in Chapter 2) with performance improvements, if any,
proportional to the level of siloxane modification. Organic compatibility and the desired hardness or flexibility
of the film are the primary determinants for selecting an acceptable silicone resin. Notably, DOWSILTM 2405
is methoxy-functional and ideally ambient-curable under catalysis, improving impact resistance and exhibiting
excellent wetting and adhesion on a broad range of substrates. Tyzor TnBT is more effective than DBTDL in
accelerating the curing of DOWSILTM 2405; additionally, a combination of 2.0% of Tyzor® TnBT and 0.65%

396

of pyrrolopyrimidine by weight appears to allow the hardness to develop to the greatest extent in situational
formulations. DOWSILTM 8016 of 60% active alkoxy functionalities is water-borne and 100% solvent-free and
offers silicone-acrylic synergy in adhesion and corrosion resistance comparable to solvent-borne counterparts if
optionally cured at 200 ∘C for one hour or air dried under a recommended titanate catalyst at 1–3% by weight. Still
notably, DOWSILTM 2080 in powder form is ethoxy-functional, contains 30–50% Si by weight, and is developed
for Si-polyester or silicone-modified polyester (SMP) powder coatings to deliver super compatibility, high heat
resistance (HTR), and durability; it may be cured, for example, at 230 ∘C for 10 min. In addition, silicones are
typically poor in fouling resistance and mechanical strength; it has been reported that a siloxane matrix grafted
with carbamates in the Si-O backbone and substituted with zwitterionic side chains has enhanced tensile strength
greater than 6.0 MPa and good fouling release performance (0.3–0.5 MPa) [68].
Debrief B Non-epoxy polymers and hybrids
Polyurea (PUA) cures rapidly, from immediately to 2 min, at temperatures as low as −20 ∘C, depending on formu-
lation, primer choice, and surface preparation, which are crucial for adhesion and applications. One-component
(1K) moisture-curable PURs (i.e., MCUs), two-component (2K) polyaspartics (i.e., essentially polyurea utilizing
aliphatic isocyanates and partially blocked amines known as polyaspartic esters), and 1K polysiloxane coatings
are all affected by water that can be scavenged with monomers such as p-TSI (for example, Additive TI sup-
plied by OMG Borchers; refer to Table 9.9). Supposedly, additives for 2K PURs are all suitable for 1K PURs,
although functional groups and moisture/water must always be monitored. Incompatibility is often the cause
of problems created by known materials in coatings. As illustrated in Figure 9.20b-1, NTI/HCT (i.e., Nanotech
Industries and Hybrid Coating Technologies) developed the first industrial line of PURs made without the use
of hazardous isocyanates in 2015, per report by Ritter et al. [69]. In such an NISO process, cyclic carbonates
and diamines are used to produce NIPU paints and coatings for flooring, cargo ships, and other applications
with performance that is even superior to that of conventional PURs (Figure 9.20a). This NIPU approach has
been recently extended to include variants of cyclic thiolcarbonates (CTC) by, for example, Rudolf et al. [70] of
BASF and Díez-Poza et al. [71], in addition to likely future combinations of cyclic carbonates and CTC. Other
viable NIPU methods include reactions between bis(cyclic carbonate)s and diamines (Figure 9.20b-1) as previ-
ously discussed, bis(alkyl) bis(carbamate)s and diols/polyols (Figure 9.20b-2) [72], including bio-based modifica-
tions [73, 74], bis(aryl) bis(carbonate)s and diamines (Figure 9.20b-3) [75], and bis(fluoroalkyl) bis(carbonate)s
(BFBCs) and diamines/polyamines [76]. Specifically, the last one (Figure 9.20b-4), as recently developed by AGC
and Kobe University in Japan, is functionally scalable at both the laboratory and industrial levels, where BFBCs
are quantitatively synthesized through base (e.g., CH3CN)-catalyzed fluoroalkyl carbonate esterification of diols
and bis(fluoroalkyl) carbonates (BFCs). The subsequent NIPUs (solvent-free, high MWs, colorless, and elastic) are
produced non-catalytically by polycondensation reactions of BFBCs and diamines under solvents or solvent-free
conditions.
Challenges with UV-LED curing polymer systems, such as vinyl-based materials, particularly acrylates, are
twofold: first, volumetric shrinkages and stress buildup that cause cracks at interfaces; and second, oxygen inhi-
bition that impairs cure responses, both of which are sometimes of grave concern for applications and end uses
such as medical adhesives, restorative dentistry materials, industrial wood varnishes, and 3D printing. Compared
to acrylates, thiol-ene formulations employing alkyl-thiols and vinyl esters, such as Hexion’s VeoVaTM vinyl esters
(neodecanoic acid derived, very hydrophobic, and highly branched to resist hydrolysis), have reduced oxygen
inhibition, significantly lower shrinkage, and improved mechanical properties, despite limited shelf-life stability
(with pyrogallol as a radical scavenger and phosphonic acid as an acid buffer) and odor (addressed by high MWs),
as reported by Ligon et al. [77]. In one sense, cationic ring-opening reactions of oxiranes (refer to Figures 3.7/3.8
in Chapter 3) or siloxiranes (i.e., mixtures of oxiranes and siloxanes) are considered alternatives for minimizing
cure-induced shrinkage. In another sense, reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) of allyl

sulfide is uncovered as a dominant mechanism to alleviate polymerization stress by delaying gelation of UV-cured
thiol-acrylates and -methacrylates [78]; more specifically, stress relaxation results from competing reactions of
chain-growth acrylate/methacrylate homo-polymerization versus chain transfer to thiol and simultaneously the
step-growth thiol-yne/vinyl sulfide polymerization if, for example, 1,6-heptadi-yne is added to constitute ternary
systems [79, 80]. Supposedly, 3M has commercialized this research for low-stress polymerization. Introduction

of multi-functional thiols (i.e., thiol-alcohols containing R-SH) at a low concentration, for example, 1.0%, or
active amines, is one way to increase surface cure when it comes to anti-oxygen inhibition, as depicted in
Figure 9.20c, where thiol-Michael click reactions occur with, for example, vinyl esters. Thiocure® series from
Bruno Bock are representative of such commercial resin products, which include, among others, TEMPIC (i.e.,
tris-mercaptopropionyloxy ethyl isocyanurate; refer to Figure 10.14e in Chapter 10), PETMP (i.e., pentaerythritol
tetramercaptopropionate, MW 488.7, tetra-functional SHs), and GST (i.e., bismercaptoethyl thio-propanethiol,
MW 260.5, tri-functional SHs). Another possibility is to add more photoinitiators, particularly Type II such as
ITX (i.e., isopropyl thioxanthone), as opposed to cleavable Type I such as TPO (i.e., trimethyl benzoyl diphenyl
phosphine oxide). Combinations of TPO and ITX photo-initiators are frequently used in LED-UV (or UV-LED)
curing varnishes of acrylates for industrial wood coatings, which are normally constructed from the bottom up
as wood, clear sealer, clear putty, sandy primer, and UV clear varnish. Fluorinated PUR coatings fabricated with
PETMP in combination with thiol-Michael click reactions exhibit anti-graffiti performance in an independent
embodiment [81].
Separately, silane, SiH4, is the simplest hydride generated from elemental silicon (which is more electropositive
than carbon) and provides the foundation for all silicon chemistry, such as silanols (Si-OH), siloxanes (Si-O-Si),
silicon esters or silicates (Si-OR), and silazanes (−SiR2-NH−). Organo-silanes (i.e., silanes having reactive organic
substitutions such as amine, olefin, methacrylate, mercaptan, epoxy, and cationic functionalities) are used as
coupling agents in thermosets, thermoplastics, and composites [82]. The most prominent silicon ester of alkoxy
derivatives is TEOS; initial unhydrolyzed TEOS contains at least 96.5% monomers and 28% SiO2 by weight, depend-
ing on purity from condensed to UHP (ultra-high purity). One version of sol-gel technologies is associated with the
complete hydrolysis of TEOS precursors under highly controlled conditions (in the absence of fillers); for sol-gel
prepolymer binder preparation from TEOS or similar precursors, diluted hydrochloric acid or acetic acids are
preferred because they facilitate the formation of stable silanol condensation products. Allyl (CH2=CH-CH2−,
not alkyl such as ethyl CH3CH2−) and vinyl (CH2=CH−)-functional silanes are capable of addition curing by
hydrides, preferably under tin catalysts, with the desired control of the hydride-to-vinyl molar ratio that determines
hardness.
Considering structure-property relationships, exclusive triazine skeletons developed in thermosetting materials
are essential for the high-temperature performance of advanced composites, adhesives, and coatings. As discussed,
triazine-forming resins and polymers include isocyanate trimerization (refer to Figure 1.5b in Chapter 1), cyanate
esters [83] and BMIs (refer to Figures 3.5a/b in Chapter 3), phenolics and derivatives (refer to Figure 7.3c in
Chapter 7), melamine and derivatives (refer to Figure 8.3 in Chapter 8), phthalonitrile or PN (refer to Figure 9.16c
in Chapter 9), suitable combinations, and others (such as TGIC partially; refer to Table 2.3e in Chapter 2). Bis-
maleimide triazine (a.k.a., BT) resins (for example, commercially available from Mitsubishi Gas Chemical) are
typically comprised of BMIs, a cyanate ester, and epoxy compounds and can be cured with peroxide initiators or
metal salt catalysts [84]. AMTU (that is, ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate and urea) as a catalyst enables PN to
convert into triazines at reduced cure temperatures, as reported by Weng et al. [85].
Remarkably, hybrids can appear in a variety of forms besides composition blends, such as a streamlined
product form or an integrated process or application approach installed with technical advancements and
functional enhancements. For instance, Belgian Acotec has recently launched Humidur®, a 2K, solvent-free, 100%
solids, polyamine-cured epoxy PFP (passive fire protection) coating that offers anti-corrosion and fire-resistant
properties by intumescent action in a single coat, a significant departure from the traditional PFP coating process,
which requires up to five coats. Competitively, Teknos introduces HENSOTHERM 920 KS, an all (four fire
classes)-in-one (product), 2K, 100% solids PFP coating for steel applications in indoor and outdoor environments
that supports the reduction and removal of VOCs in construction. BASF/Chemetall has also introduced VIANT,
a unique process that combines conversion coating and priming paint in a single coated layer, enabling reliable
corrosion protection on edges and inner surfaces, as well as a shorter process chain, resource savings, and reduced
operating costs.

Debrief C Dual UV/thermal curing silicones
PDMS-based polymers (Figure 9.21a) and their functional derivatives, utilizing dual UV (cationic or free-radical)
and thermal (including moisture) curing chemistries, are utilized extensively in coating, adhesive, and sealant
applications. In order for silicones to be UV-curable, they must be modified with mono- or di-f cyclic epoxide
(Figure 9.21b; also refer to Figure 1.9 in Chapter 1)-, acrylate (Figure 9.21c)-, or thiol (Figure 9.21d; also refer
to Figures 10.14b/c/e/f in Chapter 10)-functionality, which is capable of direct photoinitiated curing. Accord-
ing to a review by Jiang et al. [86], primary UV-curable thiol-ene-based silicone systems (refer to Figure 10.19b
in Chapter 10) cure rapidly in seconds to minutes with low cure shrinkage and no effect of oxygen inhibition,
both favorably; acrylate or (meth)acryloyloxy-based silicone polymers also cure rapidly in seconds to minutes
(favorable) but have high curing shrinkage and an issue with oxygen inhibition (unfavorably); in contrast, epoxide
cationic photopolymerization tends to cure slowly in minutes to hours (unfavorable), exhibiting very low curing
shrinkage and no oxygen inhibiting effect (most favorably).
In order to be thermally-curable, silicone precursors must contain silanes or silicates (which require water for
hydrolysis prior to thermal condensation, Figure 9.21e), silanols (which are capable of straight condensation under
heat with no further hydrolysis), di- or multi-f aliphatic epoxides (under catalysis, Figure 9.21f), or silicon hydrides
(which undergo hydrosilylation with vinyl-functional PDMSs, Figures 9.21g/h; also refer to Figure 9.14c). When it
comes to thermally curable hydrosilylation polyaddition between SiH and Si-vinyl groups in PDMSs, coordination
complexes, such as Karstedt catalysts, which are organoplatinum compounds derived from divinyl-containing

disiloxane (for example, Figure 9.21m, supplied by Johnson Matthey), are commonly employed to facilitate quick
and low-temperature curing.
In order for single 1/2K systems to be UV- and thermally-curable in combination, polysiloxanes must have
dual functions of silanes (or silicates) and acrylates or aliphatic/alicyclic epoxides, as shown structurally in
Figures 9.21i/j, or dual functions of an acrylate and an aliphatic epoxide on the same resins, as illustrated in
Figure 9.21k, or dual functions of, for instance, silanols and vinyl on the same resins, as depicted in Figure 9.21i.
Dual curing silicones typically require aliphatic epoxide- and vinyl-functional resins or polymers (including vinyl
esters; refer to Figures 1.11c/d in Chapter 1 and Figure 9.20c).
Recaps and Highlights
Polymer coatings and similar compounded systems are a category of protective and decorative materials. Two
important process metrics are cure responses and VOCs, and important application metrics are adhesion to spe-
cific and varying substrates, cohesion including toughness and modulus, Tg, flexibility, impermeability (relative to
moisture and chemicals), and a variety of other barrier properties such as weatherability, thermal resistance (rel-
ative primarily to Tg), and electrical resistance. Considering bulk polymer platforms (Figure 9.22), epoxies can be
formulated to have a Tg up to 250 ∘C (refer to fluorene monomers in Chapter 6), making them highly heat-resistant
and superior invariably to polyurethanes, acrylics, and polyesters in this regard, but generally poor in exterior
weatherability. PURs (aliphatic isocyanate grades) are lightfast and durable, but hazardous NCO concerns exist;
acrylics and acrylates are rapid cure and withstand weathering exposure, but do not resist acids well; polyesters
with dissimilar functional groups (hydroxyl or −OH, carboxyl or −COOH, and vinyl or −CH=CH−) perform
well in impact resistance but not hydrolysis resistance. Polysiloxane coatings, if properly formulated and cured,
such as organic-inorganic sol-gels upon hydrolysis/condensation and OPSZ subject to dual cure (vinyl-hydride
polyaddition and Si-NH−hydrolysis/oxidation), are capable of withstanding temperatures in excess of 350 ∘C up
to 600–800 ∘C. Quite a few matrix resins and polymers, including thermosets of PIs, PBI, PN, and cyclotene, as well
as thermoplastics of PEEK, PTFE, and others, occupy the remaining temperature gap spanning from 250 to 350 ∘C.

Following is a summary of specific, minute properties of individual systems. PTMEG-based polyurethanes
(PURs) are superior to commodity polyol-based PURs in terms of performance, such as low-temperature flexibility
and barrier properties. NIPUs derived from NISO resources and acrylates produced using Michael Addition
reactions devoid of isocyanates have gained market share and expanded the market. Acrylates are more reactive
than methacrylates, but less flexible or hydrophobic. 1/2K acrylic adhesives utilizing free radicals or UV curing
and TMP as a chain transfer agent for termination (refer to Table 9.8) should have an effective activator for surface
priming as preferred. Vinyl silanes are optimal for adhesion in acrylate systems that are cured by free radicals. In
addition, UV curing shrinkage and oxygen inhibition of acrylates and vinyl-functional systems can be mitigated
by chain transfer in conjunction with other formulation techniques, such as thiol-Michael click reactions and
wax additive addition. HAA-cured polyesters have the highest gloss, but their DFT is restricted to 3.5–4.0 μm due
to outgassing. TA-based polyesters are durable, whereas IPA-based polyesters are super-durable, including those
COOH-functional varieties crosslinked by epoxy-functional TGIC. With the aid of mono-functional isocyanates
as moisture scavengers and aldimines as reactive diluents, 2K polyurea formulations (refer to Table 9.9) can
be made highly filled, and the resulting elastomer is highly resistant to creep due to its low Tan𝛿(indicating
high cohesion) and high G′ (indicating good elasticity) at low frequencies. From the condensed grade to UHP,
unhydrolyzed silicate monomers contain at least 96.5% TEOS and 28% SiO2. TEOS, as the precursor for sol-gel
coatings, must be carefully prepared with water and an acid catalyst to control hydrolysis (refer to Table 9.10)
in order to provide a stable and functional prepolymer for high-performance surface coatings with super
adhesion. Partially hydrolyzed ethyl polysilicates or similar silicates are the preferred binders for 1/2/3K zinc-rich
primers and paints cured by moisture, where zinc particles are chemically bound to the silicate matrix (refer
to Table 9.11 and Figure 9.13). Organofunctional silanes are essential for coupling primer formulations where
vinyl-functional silanes and titanate additions are synergistic on challenging substrates. 1/2K solvent-based or
solvent-free silicone elastomer adhesives (LSR; refer to Tables 9.13/9.14) are primarily vinyl-functional PDMSs
cured by silicon hydrides (SiH) via hydrosilylation addition that may require inhibitors and tin catalysts, as well
as upgrades of HCR and FSR using FVMQ precursors for greater temperature resistance up to 240–250 ∘C. Silanol
(Si-OH)-functional siloxanes readily self-condense, whereas silicate esters (Si-OR) must undergo hydrolysis prior
to self-condensation. In addition, crosslinked LSR and polysiloxanes can function as antifouling additives in, for
example, roof coatings [87]. Last but not least, UF/MF/UMF through acid-catalyzed condensation, including WB
systems, enhances the competitiveness and utility of coating platforms.
Considering epoxy hybrids, epoxy-isocyanate powder coatings (refer to Table 9.1) under a tin catalyst boost Tg
and chemical resistance, and their performance can be further improved by the addition of a tertiary amine to
introduce epoxy homo-polymerization. Epoxy-urethane-urea coatings using Desmocap 11A (refer to Figure 9.1)
enhance adhesion and toughness. Epoxy-acrylate/BMI coatings via Michael Addition and/or individual
self-crosslinking (refer to Figure 8.6 in Chapter 8 and Tables 9.3/9.4) for, for example, microencapsulation and
surface protective lining, consistent with a report on biomaterials [88], tend to improve wet adhesion (attributed
to epoxy) and impermeability (ascribed to BMI) in addition to BMI’s native thermoplastic properties. Epoxy-BOX
hybrids (refer to BOXs in Chapter 7) are plausible to address the brittleness of pure PBZs. Epoxy-silicone
hybrids (refer to Table 6.12 in Chapter 6) appreciably impair the hardness and toughness of cured films unless
formulations are carefully optimized.
Considering non-epoxy hybrid systems, BOX-fluorene and BOX-PN (refer to Table 9.15 and Figure 9.17b)
appear to be excellent instances of structural synergy. Particularly, PN self-polymerization (refer to Figure 9.17a)
was carried out at a relatively low temperature of 175–225 ∘C (e.g., full cure in 136 sec at Tcure = 225 ∘C according to
the resultant ODE), developing triazine-oriented structures and remarkably achieving Tg as high as 344.4 ∘C, that
is, Tg ≫Tcure. In other words, PN homo-curing behaviors (small reaction orders m = 0.15 and n = 0) significantly
reveal that i) Tg < Tcure stands true if and only if vitrification plays a role in a later stage of curing, for example,
in all heterogeneous epoxy systems, and ii) cure completes upon gelation for certain polymer systems such
as homogenous PN’s, which is extraordinarily unique and highly desirable for applied formulations, although

402
9 Hybrids and Non-Epoxy Platforms
experimental rheology must verify it. Specifically, BOX-PN coatings can be formulated to take advantage of the
independent self-crosslinking of BOXs and PN for dual domain high Tgs containing any service temperature
between 250 and 310 ∘C; these coatings complement the materials toolbox for addressing the temperature gap
between 250 and 350 ∘C. Notably, hybrid polyurethane-polyurea (PUR/PUA) coatings are utilized commercially
[89, 90]; a PDMS-modified polyurethane-acrylate (PUR/AC) coating has been claimed to cure within 30 sec
(through UV light) and resist smudging regardless of substrates [91]; and the addition of vinyltrimethoxysilane
or VTMS, an organosilane monomer, to the acrylic monomer composition of water-reducible alkyd resins at
4–8% (by weight) has been found to enhance adhesion and thus corrosion resistance [92], amongst many others.
Considering forward-looking sustainability, biobased acrylic acid or its precursors (used to manufacture coatings
and paints) from 3-hydroxy-propionic acid (3-HP) by LG Chem and GS Caltex and from lactates (e.g., methyl
lactate, ethyl lactate, and lactic acid) by Låkril Technologies are slated to be produced starting in early 2024 [93].
Biobased PUR coatings with oxime-carbamate (>C=N-O-CO-NH−) linkages are being developed to facilitate fast
self-healing [94].
Coating formulations that drive adhesion (to be discussed in depth in Chapter 10) and structural performance
rely heavily on polymer chemistry and initial resin structures at the molecular level. Self-crosslinking, also known
as homo-polymerization, often plays a vitally constructive role in both cure responses and structure-property rela-
tionships. Epoxies, phenolics, acrylates, vinyl-functional polyesters, vinyl-/OH-functional silicones, HMMM and
derivatives (not the native melamine), BOXs, BMIs, PN, cyclotene, and cyanate esters, among others (such as
modifications), are self-crosslinkable resins and polymer platforms that add value to applied formulations based
on end applications. Self-curing of these materials is initiated or activated thermally, catalytically, free-radically,
and by UV light; catalyzing methods range from cationic, such as for BOXs, to anionic, such as for epoxies, to
organometallic, such as for cyanate esters. Interestingly, in addition to matrix resins like PN and cyclotene, cyclic
vinyl-functional BMIs and PhOH-functional BOXs on their own and in combination are representative of matrix
thermosets that perform outstandingly in terms of superior heat resistance, toughness, impermeability at elevated
temperatures, and direct-to-metal adhesion. Functional BOX-BMI coatings have validly exhibited supreme adhe-
sion and cohesive toughness (refer to Tables 7.8/7.9 and Figure 7.16 in Chapter 7), outperforming fluorene-based
epoxy monomers in terms of barrier properties such as impermeability and Tg.

Adhesiveness and Adhesion

Adhesion and Adhesion Promotion
In this section and throughout the rest of the chapter, the term “adhesive(s)” refers exclusively to those substances
employed to bond at least two substrates. Regarding coatings, adhesives, sealants, and other similar materials
intended for bonding or sealing surfaces and interfaces, adhesion is not only a material property defined by the
polymer and formulation of choice but also a system quality that is substrate-sensitive and dependent on end-use
applications. In terms of permanent and strong enough adhesion, it is unlikely that one single solution (either
an underlying adherent or formula) fits all (either a variety of substrates or applications). Adhesion, when con-
sidered at the molecular level, is a complicated cross-disciplinary phenomenon involving materials, mechanics,
chemistry, physics, surfaces/interfaces, rheology, mathematics, and perhaps other subjects such as engineering,
both directly and indirectly. Troubleshooting on-line adhesion issues via FMEA (failure mode and effects analysis)
can be difficult sometimes, unless a failure mode is attested, due to the individual roles of substrates, interfaces,
and polymers (especially reactive types), as well as their correlations or interactions under particular empirical
conditions of bonding gaps, moisture, temperature, and time eclipses.
Probably one of the most important but least appreciated attributes, adhesion is a science that deals with under-
standing and controlling the properties (such as chemistry and processes) of polymer coatings and adhesives
whose performance depends on the interface between two similar or dissimilar substrates to be adhered to, such
as adhesively bonded automobiles, ships, and aircraft, as well as the digital printing of toners on paper and ink
printing on food packaging. Understanding the fundamentals of adhesion enables the design and manufacture
of longer-lasting adhesives, paints, coatings, and inks with enhanced performance. Sometimes, or often, scien-
tists are able to create products that do not adhere at all, such as release coatings, non-stick cookware, and mold
releases, or that only temporarily adhere as required, such as peelable or removable packaging coatings [1, 2],
3M’s Post-it®, etc., by combining this understanding with their knowledge of materials chemistry. In an addi-
tional embodiment, a US patent [3] has been granted to a debondable PUR glue that is developed through a clever
utilization of retro Diels−Alder reactions between dienophiles (e.g., BMIs) and dienes (e.g., modified furan or
anthracene). This chapter focuses on a comprehensive discussion of adhesiveness and adhesion from the perspec-
tives of the major componential considerations, namely adhesives, substrates, interfaces, adhesion promoters, and
testing methods, utilizing real-world case studies and formulations collected exclusively in accordance with the
best value proposition.
10.1
Bulk Adhesives
On the one hand, the formulation and adhesion of surface coatings and interfacial adhesives rely heavily on
polymer chemistry and raw ingredients. On the other hand, adhesion is nearly always considered during the for-
mulation and development of reactive and non-reactive adhesives, such as structural adhesives, non-structural
hotmelts (HMs), and pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs), as overviewed in Figure 10.1. Structural adhesives are

typically liquid and reactive at ambient temperature and are composed primarily of acrylic/acrylate, epoxy, or PUR
chemistry. They always cure into a sealant capable of holding two or more substrates or parts (e.g., metal, glass,
plastic, and ceramics) together for the lifetime of the assembled product while resisting chemicals, heat, and weath-
ering. In terms of bonding strength, structural adhesives are typically referred to as crash-durable adhesives that
have tensile greater than 1,000 psi; for example, some single-component (1K) room-temperature or heat-curing
epoxy adhesives can develop tensile strength up to 5,100–6,000 psi, equating to 35–41 N/mm2 (or 35,000–41,000
kN/m2), one of the highest among all adhesive categories but likely second to cyanoacrylates.
10.1.1
Epoxy structural adhesives
1K epoxy adhesives can be formulated for structural bonding of metal-metal (such as aluminum-aluminum) and
metal-to-other materials in, for example, the automotive industry; however, they must possess latency at ambient
conditions and readily cure at elevated temperatures (without harming substrates) for initiating crosslinking and
establishing adhesion, such as at 180 ∘C for 30 min, before cooling down for subsequent handling or operations.
These 1K adhesives [4] may include a bulk liquid epoxy a toughening resin modified by isocyanates; DICY, a latent
curing agent at 10 phr; and Huntsman’s EP-796, that is, DMP-30, a widely used catalyst or accelerator (refer to
Table 2.5b in Chapter 2), at 1.2–2.0 phr, both dissolved in the resins. In addition, fibrous mineral fillers such as
wollastonite with a high aspect ratio, such as NYAD’s Nyglos 8 (an aspect ratio of 13, a diameter of 12 μm) or Nyglos
4W (an aspect ratio of 9, a size of 7 μm), are loaded at 7.5 to 15% by weight in the formulation to enhance elastic
modulus to a level exceeding 2,700 MPa versus otherwise maximally 2,000–2,200 MPa for general formulations
per DIN EN ISO 527-1 specifications at room temperature, while maintaining impact peel resistance of at least
20 N/mm per ISO 11343 at room temperature. Elastic modulus and impact peel resistance are preferably 2,500 MPa
and 25 N/mm, and even more preferably 3,000 MPa and up to 50 N/mm, respectively. Particularly, about 1.0 phr of
GLYEO (an oxirane-functional silane similar to GLYMO; refer to Figure 10.10a-3) is added to the formulation to
promote adhesion. Fusion bonded epoxy powder coatings appear to function effectively as 1K adhesives if the flow
and gel time at a given cure temperature and bond line thickness are sufficient and long enough to accommodate
sagging-free melting and component installation for adequate adhesion, respectively.

10.1 Bulk Adhesives
413
In contrast, 2K epoxy structural adhesives are formulations that readily cure at ambient temperature upon mix-
ing two components, and heating expedites their gelling and curing if applied. In other words, curing should
not necessitate heat. It is always desired for these epoxy adhesives to develop handling strength (i.e., lap shear)
rather quickly, such as reaching 0.30 MPa in 20 min, preferably to 0.34 MPa (i.e., 50 psi regarded as a tack-free
and handleable strength) in 30 min, consistent with Dahlquist Criterion in terms of tensile modulus E′ (refer to
Figure 10.4a). In addition, it is commonly sought for these epoxy adhesives to exhibit strong adhesion to certain
challenging substrates, particularly plastics such as nonpolar ABS and polar PC (refer to Table 10.4), which are
typically bonded with acrylic adhesives. When subjected to elevated service temperatures, it is always needed
that these epoxy adhesives develop a high shear strength and a high level of toughness, as well as the ability to
endure such temperatures. As presented in Table 10.1a, the 2K epoxy adhesive [5] is overall amine excessive and
highly toughened with modified epoxy resins, such as Kane-Ace MX-257 with a CSR of 37% by weight dispersed
and isocyanate-modified AER 4152 (equivalent to Shin-A T&C’s SEY-0165) in Part A and Epotuf G293-100, a
CTBN-modified epoxy resin in Part B, respectively. Cure and adhesion are significantly improved by the A-side
containing K-Flex XM-B301 (an acetoacetate or AcAc) and MCURE 201 (a multi-functional acrylate) via modified
Michael Addition (refer to Figure 4.1d in Chapter 4), as well as the use of DOWSIL Z-6040, an epoxy-functional
silane, at 1.0% by weight as an adhesion promoter. Gel times measured by ARES-LS2 rheology (i.e., the time taken
to attain the crossover of G′ and G′′) were decreased to 12.7 min or less with the AcAc component compared to
20–30 min in the absence of AcAc. Note that immediate AcAc-acrylate reactions will not take place until the A-side
is combined with the B-side, which serves as a strong base due to amines. Dual catalysts composed synergistically
of an organo-metallic compound, that is, calcium triflate or Ca(OTf)2, and a tertiary amine, that is, Ancamine K54
(equal to DMP-30; refer to Table 2.5b in Chapter 2) in the B-side are utilized to accelerate cure in this adhesive
formulation. Ca(OTf)2 is a Lewis acid (cationic) catalyst capable of promoting aminolysis of epoxies in this case;
organometallic complexes of this type also facilitate COOH-isocyanate reactions and Diels−Alder ring formation,
if involved. According to the patent, Sylothix 52, containing HDPE fiber and amorphous silica, was incorporated
as an additive filler in both parts, achieving an overlap shear strength of up to 3.60 MPa on PC panels (Emerge
8600) and greater than 9.50 MPa on PC/ABS substrates (Cycoloy 6600) at 0.5-inch overlap and 3–5 mil bond line
thickness until nominal substrate failure occurs. Part A of the resins is optionally speed mixed, for example, at
2,500–3,000 rpm for 2 min. Part B of pre-reactions and bulk amines can be processed under a nitrogen stream as
follows: Ancamine 1922A and 2678 are loaded and agitated at 350 rpm and heated to 71 ∘C at 350 rpm before
EPON 828 and Epotuf G293-100 are charged; the blend is then heated to 82 ∘C and Ca(OTf)2 is introduced under
mixing at 750 rpm for 30 min; the mixture is then cooled down to 71 ∘C before Ancamine K54 and fillers are added
and constantly mixed for a further 5–10 min.
10.1.2
Acrylic and PUR structural adhesives
Comparatively, both acrylic and PUR adhesives usually perform admirably when bonding surfaces with minimal
surface preparation. These non-epoxy adhesives are also intended to provide strong adhesion and high over-
lap shear strength even at high temperatures, as well as to improve the shelf life and cure of fillets in between
substrates. Acrylic adhesives have been previously discussed and focused on TIM (thermal interface material)
applications (refer to Table 9.8 in Chapter 9). Formulating concepts such as free-radicals or UV-curing and raw
resin selections are similar but are always subject to various modifications based on end applications when focus-
ing on adhesion.
Table 10.1b presents a patent-disclosed 2K acrylic adhesive formulation [6] as an additional illustration of the
development of strong adhesion and overlap shear strength on metals and plastics. As disclosed, in addition to the
bulk methyl methacrylate (MMA) monomers and Sartomer’s difunctional SR-541 (ethoxylated BPA dimethyl acry-
late), Part A is toughened by compatible styrene-butadiene-methacrylate triblock copolymers, such as Arkema’s
Nanostrength E21, and a vinyl-terminated butadiene, such as Hypro VTBN, chemically, and by a high aspect ratio

micro-fibrillated HDPE physically. Consequently, upon full cure under weights placed on panels for 24 hours
at 25 ∘C, the overlap shear strength can exceed 25.4 MPa at 0.5-inch overlap and 0.069 mm bond line thickness
(controlled by spacer beads) according to ASTM D1002 until cohesive failure occurs, as well as the peel strength
exceeding 4.46 kN/m according to ASTM D2651. In addition to a cationic catalyst, such as BTBACl (benzyl tributyl
ammonium chloride), and a metal complex catalyst, such as Cu-Nap (copper naphthenate, also a fungicide), Part A
is also loaded with a methacrylated phosphate adhesion promoter, such as Sipomer’s PAM-200, at 1.58% by weight.
Part B, or the free-radical polymerization accelerator, is formulated as a redox initiator system consisting of perox-
ides such as barbituric acid (equal to malonyl sulfamide) and peroxybenzoate in a plasticizer (such as Benzoflex
9-88). Notably similar to the epoxy adhesive containing Sylothix 52 with a high aspect ratio, a micro-fibrillated
(highly branched) HDPE powder is employed as a synergic filler in this acrylic adhesive, which is MiniFibers’
STUFF ESS50F (an aspect ratio of 20, hydrophobic), equivalent to Enhance/Fluoro-Seal’s INHANCE PEF. Addi-
tionally, optionally supportive ingredients such as Cabot’s Cab-O-Sil TS 720 and KaMin’s Polyfil WC (density 2.5
times that of HDPE) are surface-treated with vinyl silanes for bulk compatibility. Using 2-part syringe dispensers
with a static mixing tip, the mixing ratio of Part A to Part B is set at 10: 1. Commercially, Scott Bader has recently
introduced Crestabond M1-04 SL (SL stands for self-leveling), a new 2K 10: 1 acrylic structural adhesive used for
primer-less potting and bonding in EV (electric vehicle) batteries and suitable for applications including com-
posites (e.g., the most commonly used carbon fiber-reinforced plastics (CFRPs) or glass fiber-reinforced plastics

(GFRPs), thermoplastics, and metals in all market segments where self-leveling properties (such as gap-filling up
to 5 mm) are required, in addition to high strength and resistance to difficult environmental conditions.
Competitively, 2K PUR adhesives, including the one exhibited in Table 10.1c, should solidify rapidly upon mix-
ing their two components to establish a handling bond strength in a short period of time and to be easily de-bonded
later, if necessary, without damaging substrates such as metal, glass fiber, CFRPs, and so on. Part A of this iso-
cyanate adhesive [7] consists of two MDI components with radically varying NCO contents and MWs, one being
a modified MDI monomer containing 29.4% NCO and the other being an internally synthesized prepolymer with
2.1% NCO (refer to Table 10.1c for compositions). In addition to DABCO (refer to Table 2.5a in Chapter 2) at
0.3% by weight as the highly effective catalyst and a molecular sieve such as Sylosiv A3 from Grace at 3.5% as the
moisture scavenger, Part B comprises a triol (i.e., tri-functional and EO-end capped Voranol CP 4755, MW 4,700)
at 50.5%, two diols (i.e., low MW butanediol and relatively high MW Simusol BPIP/P) at 11.1% total, and a pri-
mary amine (i.e., MXDA) at 1.7% as an additional curing agent to boost up gel and cure, respectively. The specific
triol-to-diol and diol-to-diol ratios affect the bonding performance. Triols may be used in conjunction with Poly-
THF 2000 (EW-OH 75, f = 2), or Cerenol H2400 (EW-OH 100, f = 2), and Simusol BPIP/P, or propoxylated BPA
(EW-OH 200.4, f = 2). Such an adhesive formulation using exclusively ratioed polyols is designed to create adhe-
sion and bonding strength on a wide variety of substrates, sufficient to serve in a broader temperature range. The
mixing ratio of components A and B is 1.19, which corresponds to approximately a 19% surplus of isocyanate. Cure
schedules were recommended for 24 hours at 25 ∘C, followed by a post cure at 80 ∘C for three hours; debonding was
carried out at 150 ∘C for 20 min. The tensile strength and elongation at break for this PUR adhesive tested using
dumbbells according to ISO 527 were determined to be 41.0 MPa and 216% at −35 ∘C, 15.0 MPa and 249% at 23 ∘C,
and 7.0 MPa and 127% at 85 ∘C, respectively. In accordance with DIN EN 1465, the tensile shear strength on steel
panels after three hours at 80 ∘C was up to 7.1 MPa, depending on the polyol ratio. Substates may be extended to
include, but not limited to, glass, metal (aluminum, iron, steel, etc.), coated substrates, plastics (PVC, ABS, PC, PA,
PMMA, PO, PE, PP, etc.), and fiber-reinforced plastics, subject to experimental validation; plastics are preferably
oxygen plasma cleaned prior to bonding. In a commercial embodiment, SikaForce-840 L07, a flexible, structural
2K PUR adhesive that cures at room temperature and a CPI (the Center for the Polyurethanes Industry) finalist for
the 2023 Polyurethane Innovation Award [8], is suited for structural elastic bonding of composites (e.g., C/GFRPs)
or coated metals in transportation and general industry.
10.1.3
One-component (1K) moisture curable PUR and silicone adhesives
When properly formulated, 1K moisture-curing PURs as adhesives, coatings, and sealants are also structural,
providing adequate physical properties and commercially convenient bonding requirements for, for example, auto-
motive windshield glass. Technically, these single-composition adhesives must achieve rapid tack-free time and
fast physical property development (e.g., tensile, shear, weathering, flexibility, etc.) while maintaining a long shelf
life. 1K PURs tend to bond to damp substrates (such as wood) more quickly than to dry ones (such as glass).
Tabulated in Table 10.2a is a 1K moisture-curing PUR adhesive [9] for safety glass binding in the conventional
automotive industry. Importantly, one prepolymer and two stock solutions are optionally prefabricated in-house
as crucial components of the final adhesive. To produce the prepolymer, MDI monomers and selected polyols are
loaded in the sequence specified, and their complete reactions are ensured by constant mixing at 60 ∘C for four
hours under a stream of N2. Alternately, Isonate 125M (33.5% NCO, EW-NCO 125.5) or Multrathane M or ana-
logues may be used in place of Mondur M, as may Arcol 31-28 instead of LHT 28 as a triol with secondary (2∘) OH
groups and Teracol 2000 or analogues as an offset to originally Quaker Oats’ Polymeg 2000, that is, a diol with pri-
mary (1∘) OH functionality. The overall molar ratio of NCO to OH is 2: 1, resulting in NCO-terminated prepolymers
that are readily cured by water via chain transfer reactions upon contact with moisture. Measured by mixing it with
Niax A-99 at 0.26% by weight under controlled conditions, the tack-free and full cure times of the unfilled prepoly-
mer alone were roughly 2 min and less than one hour, respectively. Niax A-99, that is, bis(2-(N-N-dialkylamino)

0.15% in the finished adhesive, as was the silane solution of mercapto-functional Silane A-189 at 20.95% by weight
or 0.55% in the final adhesive as an adhesion and filler mixing additive. Desmodur N-75 is an aliphatic HDI biuret.
When the bonding thickness was maintained at 0.74 mm (or under 30 mils), the tack-free and full cure times of
the final adhesive product were 7 min and nearly 2.5 hours at 25 ∘C and 50% RH. Filler loadings, accordingly,
slow or delay the tack-free and cure times. At the time of the patent filing, the industrial standard acceptable to
automotive companies like Ford Motors for full bulk strength development was less than six hours. According
to the disclosure, this adhesive on GFRPs was tested in accordance with ASTM D-412 to achieve tensile strength
of up to 7.6 kg/cm2 in three hours, 18.3 kg/cm2 in 24 hours, and 27.2 kg/cm2 in 48 hours, respectively, until sub-
strate (glass) failure was observed. Delamination due to a glass substrate failure or a cohesive one typically takes
place between 21.0 and 31.6 kg/cm2 for these 1K PURs. If formulated to address primed or unprimed adhesion,
1K moisture-curable PUR structural adhesives are applicable not only to broader substrates such as metal, plas-
tic, wood, leather, concrete, and textiles, but also to non-structural bonding as hotmelts (HMs) for assembly and
manufacturing applications in which external heat may be applied.
Notably, formulations of 1K moisture-curable silicones as HM adhesives are also achievable, as exemplified
in Table 10.2b [10], where a ViMQ resin, a MQ reactive resin, and an alkoxy PDMS polymer may optionally be

pre-synthesized. Vi stands for vinyl-functional, while M and Q stand for the M and Q units, that is, the degree of
organic substitution at three for M and zero for Q per silicon, respectively, in the resin; according to the patent
disclosure, the preferred molar ratio of M to Q is 0.60 to one. Specifically, a ViMQ resin with 70% solids in xylene,
high vinyl at 2.0%, and low silanol at 0.8% by weight was produced from DC MQ 6-3444 (70% solids in xylene, Mw
17,000–22,000, high vinyl at 2.0% wt., and high silanol at 1.8% wt.) under stirring at 80 ∘C for four hours, and then
quenched by one part of IPA and five parts of water prior to the removal of volatiles via hot reflux. Subsequently,
an MQ reactive resin was prepared from the ViMQ resin that reacts with SiH-functional ETM (Figure 10.2b),
such as DC XCF 3-6105, as an alkoxy oxidizing agent, at a SiH to vinyl ratio of 0.30 (or preferably between 0.1
and 1.0 as recommended) via hydrosilylation (refer to Figure 9.13c in Chapter 9) under a Pt catalyst, such as
DC 2-0707, all combined at 100 ∘C for 60 min. Pt catalysts can also be substituted by DBTDL, zinc naphthenate,
dibutyltin diacetate, stannous octanoate, or similar compounds. The final moisture-curable adhesive is prepared
in the following manner: the resultant MQ resin of 61.5 pbw is homogenized with a linear alkoxy PDMS, such
as DC 3-0116, of 38.4 pbw by extruding at, for example, 160 ∘C; the mixture is then cooled to room temperature
and a crosslinker, such as DC OFS-2306 silane, at 1.34 pbw, is added; and lastly, 0.10 pbw of a hydrolysis and
condensation catalyst, such as Tyzor TnBT, is added. The weight ratio of the OFS silane to Tyzor TnBT is 93: 7,
and it functions as an adhesion promoter and moisture scavenger in addition to a crosslinker for hydrolysis and
condensation (refer to Figure 9.10 in Chapter 9).
Note that additional ingredients, such as tackifiers, rheological aids, diluents, thermal stabilizers, fillers, col-
orants, and corrosion inhibitors, can be added to the HM adhesive formulation as desired. A curing schedule of
120 ∘C for 24 hours enables the HM adhesive to transform into a non-tacky elastomer, achieving a 72.6% cure as
measured by IR peak signals at 2,173/2,550 cm−1 (corresponding to SiH/SiCH3, respectively) with stronger han-
dling (green) strength, enhanced creep resistance, and less extractable molecules, all of which are important for
automotive applications. As it turns out, under-curing silicone elastomers to achieve the desired hardness is not
an uncommon practice.

Anaerobic and instant adhesives
Notably, the world’s strongest adhesive is DELO Monopox VE403728, a high-temperature-resistant epoxy that
lifted 17.5 tons of loads with only three grams of mass on July 12, 2019, establishing a Guinness world record [11].

418
10 Adhesion and Adhesion Promotion
Other reactive systems, such as anaerobic and instant (refer to Figure 10.1), are important additions to structural
adhesives; 1K acrylates predominate among anaerobic and instant structural bonding adhesives. In a first aspect,
1K anaerobic adhesives are stable at room temperature for an extended period of time, and they polymerize only
when oxygen is excluded following the assembly of an article with such an adhesive. Anaerobic adhesives are
often formulated using a blend of monofunctional and multifunctional (meth)acrylate ester monomers or resins,
a redox radical initiator package, stabilizers or inhibitors, and modifiers. primarily for bonding materials such as
metals and glass and, to a lesser extent, wood and plastic (thermosets and some thermoplastics). For example, an
activator is typically applied to one or both joint surfaces before an anaerobic adhesive is applied to begin curing.
Their curing speeds are determined by their activators of choice; cure times range from less than 30 sec to greater
than 30 min. Advantages of anaerobic adhesives include single-part room temperature curing, cure-on-demand
capability, and high levels of durability; downsides include obviously restricted gap cure, unsuitability for porous
surfaces, and poor performance with certain thermoplastics.
In a further aspect, cyanoacrylate ester monomer (Figure 10.2c)-based 1K instant adhesives have excellent adhe-
sion and bonding strength on a wide variety of substrates and under forgiving application conditions (such as
requiring no heat or pressure), making them well-suited for all general purposes and instant bonding. Cyanoacry-
late adhesives are solvent-free, rapid-curing, and are used to affix components or panels together and retain them
permanently. The curing reactions of instant adhesives are driven by anionic polymerization that is readily initi-
ated by traces of alkaline material present on most substrates in conjunction with low surface moisture levels. In
addition to the original invention of superglues, that is, alkyl 2-cyanoacrylate polymers [14], 1K instant adhesives
are mostly composed of pure monomers with relatively small amounts of property-modifying additives and, prefer-
ably, an activator as well. As disclosed in Table 10.3a, an activator may comprise stabilizers such as propane sulfone
and hydroquinone at 0.5% and an accelerator such as N-oxydiethylene benzothiazole 2-sulfenamide (Figure 10.2d)
or alternatively bismuth dimethyl dithio-carbamate (Figure 10.2e) at 0.1%.

10.1 Bulk Adhesives
419
Cyanoacrylate adhesives have evolved to include a gel form containing alkoxy-alkyl ester monomers such as
MECA (Figure 10.2f), which bond virtually instantaneously to varied substrates, whether smooth or porous, and
can be applied both horizontally and vertically without sagging. Toagosei America represents a manufacturer and
supplier of cyanoacrylate adhesive products, in addition to urethane acrylates, polyester acrylate monomers and
oligomers, and thermally shrinking fillers. As exhibited in Table 10.3b as an exemplary formulation [13], instant
adhesives are typically formulated with appropriate thickeners, shear-thinning agents, stabilizers for production
and storage, adhesion promoters, plasticizers as needed, and other additives. Likewise, solid cyanoacrylate adhe-
sives have been created for solid application to a substrate, which polymerize into an adhesive polymer when
liquefied by mild heat, particularly at temperatures slightly above room temperature. As disclosed by Kotzey [15],
𝜀-caprolactones are utilized as a solidifying polymer along with cyanoacrylate monomers and other additives to
generate a solid adhesive composition that is especially stable, easy to apply, and usable in a wide variety of indus-
trial, consumer, and medical applications.
10.1.5
Titanate catalysts and formulation tips
Notably, Tyzor® TnBT (or TBT) is a tetra-n-butyl titanate liquid that is 100% active, extremely sensitive to moisture,
and rapidly decomposes in water. In addition to its use as a Ziegler-Natta catalyst in olefin polymerization, TnBT
is most frequently employed as a metal catalyst in the synthesis of polyester polyols, polybutylene terephthalate,
and polytrimethylene terephthalate, where it improves yield and eliminates undesirable byproducts. Tyzor® TnBT
is a non-toxic alternative to organo-stannanes, tin, and other hazardous metals used in organic synthesis and
adhesives. In addition, Tyzor® TnBT can be used to treat glass and metal surfaces in order to improve adhesion,
increase scratch resistance, and enhance light reflection. When applied directly to metal, it forms a continuous
metal oxide film layer that protects the metal surface from eroding. Thin polymeric films of titanium dioxide
can also be created on surfaces to increase iridescence and impart coloring effects. TnBT can also be additively
incorporated into paints and coatings in order to crosslink polymers with carboxyl or hydroxyl functionality. Tyzor®
TnBT can also bind corrosion-inhibiting pigments, which are commonly employed in metal corrosion-resistant
coatings.
For reactive adhesives, including all structural (such as 1/2K epoxies, 2K acrylics, and 1/2K PURs) and some
HMs (such as 1K moisture-curable PURs and silicones), as precedingly described, adhesion in terms of peel, shear,
and impact strength on substrates such as metal and plastic, even at elevated temperatures, is the mechanical
performance most important to applications. Regardless of structural or non-structural adhesives, bonding on
some plastic substrates, such as pure ABS and PC, can be more difficult than on others. From the perspective of
the structures of polymers, adhesive properties, including adhesion, are primarily determined by cure kinetics (if
reactive) and rheological behaviors; epoxies, for instance, can be applied to a wide variety of substrates with great
adhesion. Epoxy-crosslinker co-polymerization and epoxy-epoxy homo-polymerization (refer to Figures 3.2a/b in
Chapter 3) are fundamental to understanding epoxy curing, and it is the combination of these two-fold crosslink-
ing events that drives structural performance such as adhesion, Tg, cohesive modulus, and flexibility, among
others. To a certain extent, adjusting the two sets of reactions in epoxy adhesives for the desired attributes is a mat-
ter of selecting the correct compositions and formulation factors (such as the formulation index, or FI). Michael
Addition reactions (initially between amines and acrylates; refer to Figure 3.9 in Chapter 3 and Figure 8.5a in
Chapter 8) are applicable to a variety of substrates for strong adhesion, as another example; they cure very fast at
ambient temperature, comparable to the free-radical approach, and there is a growing trend to employ malonates
and acetoacetates (refer to Figure 4.1d in Chapter 4) when formulating wood, floors, and other industrial coatings
without isocyanates or polyurethanes. Thus, all types of unsaturated compounds (such as styrene—aromatic C9,
DCPD and adamantane—aliphatic C5, polybutadiene or PBD, and polyisoprene) can be compatibly incorporated
for enhanced adhesion, cohesion, toughness, and flexibility.

10.2
Characterization of Adhesives and Adhesion
10.2.1
Reactive adhesives
Cure kinetics defining crosslinking pathways is particularly important for epoxy adhesives, which nearly always
exhibit inherently characteristic enthalpy, exothermic histograms, Tg, and other properties, as are rheology
and dynamic viscosity associated with gel and cure behaviors for all reactive adhesives. As demonstrated in
Figure 10.3b, there are two adhesion-related characteristics that are representative of such low-temperature cure
systems when other variables, such as the substrate and the surface energy of the substrate and the coating or the
adhesive itself, remain essentially unchanged. First, 𝜂*min reveals that the coating flows and levels at its lowest
viscosity of 7,019.9 Pa-s at temperatures as low as 91.1 ∘C, rendering adhesion to substrates. Second, a half-height
line across the gel point represents a flow window; the wider the window, the greater the adhesion.
In this instance (Figures 10.3a/b), the reactive coating melts upon heating, reaches 𝜂*min, at which it is 18.3%
cured, arrives at Tpeak at 107.8 ∘C and 𝛼= 54.9%, and then immediately gels at 110.4 ∘C upon reaching a cure level of
𝛼= 61.2%. The gel point measures the open time of a coating or adhesive applied at a given temperature and mois-
ture conditions, as well as the lowest limit of green strength-related handleability. The dynamic viscosity from 𝜂*min
to gelation (i.e., where G′ = G′′) represents the VE liquid zone in which the viscous modulus G′′ (i.e., the dashpot
component in a Maxwell viscoelastic or VE model) dominates over the elastic modulus G′ (i.e., the spring com-
ponent in a Maxwell model), thereby governing adhesion. In this region, the parameters 𝜂*min, Tpeak, and the gel
point are crucial process control considerations. For example, in the critical panelizing process of insulated metal
substrate lamination (refer to Figure 4.6b in Chapter 4), a full press of up to 1,300 psi should be applied between
𝜂*min and Tpeak, close to the gel point, while the heating rate is also managed to prevent excessive flow from causing
overflow and bone line damage. As observed, the secondary shoulder peak at ∼140 ∘C in Figure 10.3a becomes

a result of the FI cut from 2.00 to 1.15 (i.e., from highly to slightly epoxy resin-rich), which kinetically results in a
much lower amount of epoxy homo-polymerization in the overall cure reactions. As necessary, Chapter 5 can be

(dielectric analysis) equivalently characterizes reactive adhesives in terms of ion viscosity progressing profiles ver-
sus time or temperature, from which the minimum ion viscosity indicates the best flow behavior (analogous but
not necessarily equivalent to 𝜂*min in rheology DMA), a steeper slope reveals stronger reactivity, and a horizontal
step signifies an increase in crosslinking density toward the end of cure, all of which are formulation driven.
10.2.2
Non-reactive adhesives
Non-structural adhesives are mostly HMs and PSAs with far lower bonding strengths than structural adhesives,
yet they can still be utilized for structural binding applications, such as a wide variety of de-/re-bondable
medical devices. HMs and PSAs are generally non-reactive; however, there are exceptions, such as the 1K
moisture-curable PUR and silicone adhesives discussed, as well as the UV-curable HMs and PSAs outlined
conceptually in Figure 10.1. Non-reactive HM polymers are thermoplastic, such as ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA),
styrene isoprene/butadiene styrene (SIS/SBS), and so forth. Due to the substitution of the methyl group, SBS
is stiffer than SIS. Polyesters and polyamides are sometimes considered structural HMs due to their superior
bonding strength and heat resistance (as a result of their higher Tgs) compared to other forms of HMs. Contact
adhesives are classified as non-structural adhesives alongside HMs because they are not necessarily HMs.
UV-curable HMs and PSAs consist of unsaturated double bonds. PSAs are the only adhesives that are not defined
by their chemistry or application, but rather by their characteristics, such as tackiness according to the Dahlquist
Criterion (Figure 10.4a); good PSAs must strike a balance between adhesiveness and surface wet-out. It has
become trending to fabricate PSAs from bio-based ingredients [16].
Noteworthy, the DMA responses of non-reactive HM and PSAs differ from those of reactive adhesives, as exhib-
ited in Figure 10.4a. Temperature ramps of DMA often result in three discrete crossovers of G′ and G′′ that divide
the modulus profiles into four distinctive zones, namely glass, transition, rubber plateau, and melt regions. It is
important to remember a viscous dashpot symbol for G′′ and an elastic spring symbol for G′. Specifically, the rub-
bery plateau region with G′ > G′′ indicates elastic dominance and cohesion, representing the service temperature
zone; tack refers to viscous adhesion, falling within the transition range and associated with Tg as indicated by
the Tan𝛿peak temperature; and flow refers to the breakdown of domain structures where G′′ > G′ as an adhesive
loses its VE properties at elevated temperatures. The Dahlquist Criterion stipulates a critical tensile modulus E′

less than 0.3 MPa (at room temperature), which is equivalent to a shear modulus G′ of 0.1 MPa or the creep compli-
ance that is the inverse of G′ for PSAs and non-woven adhesives to maintain their effective tackiness. It is obtained
equally from surface flow and roughness studies (Figure 10.4b). When the surface is sharp (small R’s) or deep (big
h’s), just a very low critical shear modulus G′
c is required to achieve strong adhesion. In the meanwhile, DMA
on cured adhesive film samples normally reports the tensile or Young’s modulus E′, which is approximately three
times the shear modulus G′, or E′ = 3G′. Notably, the trending pattern of cured film E′ at elevated temperatures is
associated with crosslinking density (refer to Figure 6.6a in Chapter 6); that is to say, the higher the crosslinking
density, the greater the heat resistance. Major performance parameters for HM adhesives are tack, peel, shear, and
heat resistance, which are closely correlated to their DMA modulus data. For instance, relatively modest variations
between G′ at low frequencies ( f low), that is, the tack modulus, and G′ at high frequencies (f high), that is, the peel
modulus, are indicative of good tack and peel performance.
DMA can provide a wide range of qualitative and quantitative characterizations of non-reactive adhesives, if
appropriately done and understood, including the following perspectives: i) capability to map non-reactive HM
resins and polymers in terms of G′, G′′ and Tan𝛿for the aim of driving VE properties into feasible operating win-
dows, for example, typically by selecting higher Tg compatible raw materials, such as polyesters and polyamides,
for heat resistance if required; ii) evaluation of the effects of tackifiers and plasticizers on formulation perfor-
mance, such as Tan𝛿peak temperature increases indicating less flexibility, G′ increases indicating higher peel
strength, and Tan𝛿peak height increases indicating better wet-out (i.e. lower surface tension) for tack and adhe-
sion; iii) compatibility of, for example, a 50/50 blend of SIS and SBS exhibiting dual Tgs as indicated by two separate
Tan𝛿peaks; iv) prediction of real-world performance of, for instance, a packaging HM adhesive or a road traffic
mark compound according to their low and high temperature resistance, aiding in evaluation of variables such
as open time, setting time, cohesion, hardness, flexibility, and heat resistance; and others. According to Research
Nester [19], HM adhesives are expected to grow substantially from USD 10.02 billion in 2022 to USD 24.68 billion
by 2035.
10.2.3
HM adhesives as TIMs: a case study
Figures 10.5/10.6 demonstrate a modified HM adhesive applied to aluminum substrates as thermal interface
materials (TIMs). It was specifically about a conformal and screen-/stencil-printable adhesive to be applied to alu-
minum base panels or adhering to the backside of PCB-oriented thermal substrates so that any heatsink attached
to the backside later is guaranteed to be in intimate contact with the base plate for improved heat dissipation. As a
result, the soft-face coating material must be compressible, compatible with solder reflow without delamination,
electrically non-conductive if possible, and have a bulk thermal conductivity of 2.0 W/m- ∘K at 3–6 mil DFT. In
the case where electrical conductivity is required for a particular end use, such as electromagnetic interference
(EMI) shielding (refer to Subsection 1.12 of Chapter 1), it is optional to utilize metal particles of suitable size, a
combination of metal additives, or intrinsically conductive polymers (ICPs). PEDOT:PSS, which stands for poly(3,
4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate), is an ICP that can be coated with a binder resin (e.g., epoxy or
polyester) on specific substrates to fabricate composites with tailorable electrochemical conductivity for applica-
tions such as anticorrosion [20, 21], polymeric solar cells [22], low-cost printed electronics [23], and so forth. An
example of a commercially accessible PEDOT:PSS is Clevios PH1000, which is supplied by Heraeus and has an
aqueous dispersion of 850 siemens/cm at 1.3% solids.
For improved heat resistance during reflow, a thermoplastic elastomer polyester HMPSA, such as Bostik’s Ther-
mogrip 2211 (softening point 121.1 ∘C, density 1.024 g/ml), was chosen as the bulk adhesive resin. Figure 10.6a
illustrates DMA temperature ramp curves typical of such polyesters, with an in-use temperature range of around
−20 to 90 ∘C (not necessarily Thermogrip 2211’s) correlating to the rubber plateau zone. Acetate solvents of 10%
by weight were employed to achieve highly filled ceramic alumina particles at 800 phr for thermal conductivity.
Therefore, the 100 pbw modified formulation included, for example, 9.98 pbw of Thermogrip 2211, 9.76 pbw of

black, resulting in a solids content of 90.2% by calculation or 89.0% by TGA, and a viscosity of 38.4 Pa-s
(or 38,400 cPs) at 36 ∘C.
The adhesion, screen-ability, and reflow compatibility of the HM-turned coating performed well in two pilot
trials conducted during its development. As briefed in the workflow chart (Figure 10.5), the compounded viscos-
ity allowed 60-mesh screen or stencil printing to achieve 5–6 mil DFT; with protection of a release paper liner
applied on top of the post-conditioned adhesive using a heated two-roll laminator, TGA weight loss following the
harsh reflow was only about 1%; the decomposition temperature (∼10% weight loss at 200 ∘C accounting for more
than 90% of the HM mass) and thermal impedance performance were essentially unchanged after reflow. Images
captured by SEM (Figure 10.6b) reveal that the HM layer was slightly stressed or dried. Nevertheless, it remained
challenging for the coated soft-face to withstand the hardships of succeeding panel fabrications, such as cleaning,
scoring, drilling, and punching.
10.3
Substrates and Interfaces
Adhesion is, at its core, the mechanical behavior of the interface between two solid materials or of one flow-
able material (the adhesive) joining the surfaces of two other solid materials (the adherends), similar or dis-
similar, involving mechanical responses of polymers and gels (such as constitutive stress-strain properties and
time-dependent viscoelasticity as previously discussed), as well as molecular structures and interactions between
the polymeric adhesive and the adherends [24]. Adhesiveness and adhesion are determined quantitatively using

overlap shear and butt tensile strengths of assembled objects and joints in terms of bonding (Figures 10.7a/b) and
peel strength of assembled objects and joints in terms of debonding (such as 180∘and T-peel or 90∘, Figure 10.7c).
Peel strength is also correlated to the flexibility and toughness of cured adhesives in terms of fractural debonding
at a particular temperature. The most commonly used application-specific testing is dynamic T-peel.
10.3.1
Surface energy and surface tension
From substrate and interfacial perspectives, adhesive manufacturers frequently provide only simplistic instruc-
tions on preparing surfaces prior to bonding, and this is a leading cause of bond failures because end users are
sometimes unsure of, overlook, or take for granted the need for sufficient surface cleaning and substrate activation.
The objective of substrate surface preparation is to re-establish predictable, consistent, and reliable interfaces, such
as surface roughness, micro- and macro-porosity, and surface energy, which influence an adhesive’s ability to flow
and adhere. Depending on the nature of the substrate, acceptable surface preparation techniques include, but are
not limited to, chemically, washing, solvent, chromic acid (for both metal and polymeric substrates), mechanically,
abrasion, blasting (surface profiling), energetically, ultrasound, corona, plasma, and flame. In terms of contam-
inant removal and surface topology measured by surface energy or contact angles, the effect of these cleaning
methods can vary considerably. The contact angle is an experimentally effective indicator of surface energy in
terms of wettability or non-wettability by a fluid with a lower or greater surface tension than the surface energy of
a solid substrate. For example, as-received aluminum panels normally have a contact angle of ∼70∘; cleaning with
IPA wipes can lower it to 55–60∘, plasma with an ionized gas can reduce it to 20–30∘, and abrasion can drastically
decrease it to ∼15∘. Note that the contact angle (𝜃) of a substrate’s surface should be low enough for adhesion, but
not too low.
Low viscosity and good flowability (i.e., good leveling; refer to Figure 10.3b) in conjunction with low surface
tension (i.e., good wet-out) of reactive or non-reactive adhesives at application improve adhesion to a specific
pretreated surface of a substrate, and these properties are also central to adhesion promotion of non-reactive adhe-
sives. Surface energy is useful for making preliminary selections, but it cannot replace real-world testing (such as
overlap shear, tensile, peel, and others like cleavage) for determining whether a specific adhesive is suitable for a
particular end application. According to the surface energy/tension data in Table 10.4, most MSE (medium surface
energy) adhesives and coatings (such as epoxies, PURs, and polyesters) bond most HSE (high surface energy) sub-
strates (such as metals, glass, and concrete) after cleaning; epoxy adhesives may have difficulty adhering to MSE
polymer, composite, and wood substrates. Rubber adhesives (such as EVA) and PSAs tend to bond most MSE sub-
strates, as do LSE (low surface energy) acrylics, but adhesion can be improved by applying a primer. LSE substrates
such as TPO (i.e., thermoplastic olefin) and PTFE (i.e., polytetrafluoroethylene) can be particularly challenging to
bond and often require specially developed adhesives and/or surface treatments (such as plasma) and primers to
achieve an effective bonding.
Due to carbene insertion reactions with C-H bonds (refer to Figure 3.12 in Chapter 3), it has been reported
that primers and adhesives based on diazirines (refer to Table 2.2k in Chapter 2) bond LSE plastics effectively
[28]. Scotch-WeldTM DP8010, a structural plastic adhesive, and 300LSE acrylic tapes, both manufactured by 3M,
are two examples of commercial adhesives designed to bind certain LSE substrates without requiring the use of
a primer. Also, for example, Toyobo’s Vylon co-polyester resins of balanced flexibility and hardness, if necessary,

in HM, SB, WB form, are said to have strong adhesion to PET, PVC, metal (including coil and can coatings), and

as PE (polyethylene) and PP (polypropylene); terpene phenol/SIS HM adhesives are reported to perform well on
challenging non-polar LSE plastic substrates. According to online product information [29], Elvacite® specialty
acrylic resins, which are supplied by Mitsubishi Chemical, are purported to promote adhesion directly to metals
(including aluminum and galvanized steel) and plastics (including PVC, ABS, nylon, and untreated PET or TPO)
when appropriately chosen and formulated. PP-modified acrylic resins and chlorinated polyolefin (CPO) rubber
boost adhesion on TPOs; silicone adhesives strongly bond to non-polar substrates, making them a very limited

choice for silicone adherends, despite the fact that they are rarely employed due to their high cost. Notably, it
is wiser and more likely to be effective to use acrylic or silicone adhesives rather than epoxies or PURs to bond
LSE substrates. Still noteworthy, polar PCBTF (i.e., para-chlorobenzotrifluoride, Figure 10.8b-1) is regarded as a
super solvent with low surface tension at 25.0 mN/m and VOC exemption (in comparison to xylene at 28.7 mN/m
and 100% VOC content). Inspiringly, a radical new method employing disilazide donors and an N-oxoammonium
acceptor for facilitating C—H activation (considered the Holy Grail of organic chemistry; refer to Rogge et al. [30]),
that is, cleaving aliphatic C—H bonds (tertiary, secondary, or primary), was recently disclosed [31] and was even
extended to amides, carboxylates, and alcohols by utilizing tailored catalysts [32]. In addition to surface energy,
adhesion and long-term bonding can be affected by physical and chemical factors such as surface roughness or
patterns (increasing area of contact), contamination and treatments, application temperatures, CTE (coefficient
of thermal expansion) match or mismatch between an adhesive and a substrate, active chemistry of adhesives,
diffusion of uncured adhesives, flexibility, permeability, and toughness of dried or cured adhesives, as well as
covalent bonding of bulk resins and additive adhesion promoters to substrates.
In addition, in terms of polarity and barrier performance, the accommodation and diffusion rate of water vapor
or moisture in polar molecular plastics (such as strongly polar PET, polar PVC, and weakly polar PS) are greater
than that of non-polar plastics (such as PE and PP), which are excellent moisture-proof packaging materials,
and the value of the moisture permeability coefficient is also greater for polar plastics than non-polar plastics.
Polarity is often advantageous for adhesion and cohesion due to intermolecular and intramolecular interactions,
including hydrogen bonding. Furthermore, aluminum has the lowest WVTR (water vapor transmission rate) of
0.03 g/m2-day (tested at 50 μm DFT under 38 ∘C and 90% RH), which explains why aluminum is likely the best
packaging material, followed by PP at 1.50 g/m2-day. When it comes to electrode potentials of HSE metals such
as aluminum, steel, zinc, and other conductors such as graphite, aluminum is more negative than zinc (−1.67 V
versus −0.76 V, Table 10.4), which suggests that aluminum is supposedly more appropriate as a sacrifice cathode
than zinc with respect to corrosion inhibition of steel. However, zinc is practically favored over aluminum, for
example, in zin-rich primers and paints (refer to Table 9.11 and Figure 9.12 in Chapter 9) due to the following
reasons: i) zinc tends to anchor to iron in steel, ii) zinc actively reacts into the siloxane matrices, and iii) zinc
creates white, insoluble ZnO powders as a barrier, whereas aluminum (unless anodized) can be washed out. In
contrast, where aluminum is the substrate of interest, such as for aerospace-oriented coatings, phosphoric acid
anodization, which results in more open micro-porous structures, is preferred over sulfuric acid or chromic acid
treatments. Micro-fibrous surfaces are notably more durable than microporous surfaces. Polyolefins and TPOs are
LSE, non-polar, and highly resistant to solvents.

10.3.2
Surface modiﬁcations
According to online resources, Eastman [33], modified PP polymers as adhesion promoters improve adhesion of
coatings, inks, and adhesives to LSE TPO plastics such as PE and PP in both primer and adhesive formulations of
two-/one-step systems to untreated surfaces through dipole-dipole interactions (forms of van der Waals, including
polar-nonpolar interactions known as induction force or Debye force). In addition, SI Group’s PolybondTM 3200
(Tm 157 ∘C), a polypropylene (PP)-based coupling agent derived from maleic anhydride (refer to Figure 2.9c in
Chapter 2)-modified PP homo-polymer, provides excellent adhesion for filled PP systems. Moreover, Hardlen®
adhesion promoters from Toyobo (such as chlorinated polyolefin, or CPO, and maleic anhydride modified, or
MAH-CPO/-PO) are competitive products. Figure 10.8a describes the non-chemical mechanisms by which com-
patibility, polarity, diffusive interactions, H-bonding (a strong intermolecular electrostatic force of attraction), and
mechanical anchoring between the substrate and the primer and between the primer and a topcoat are synergistic
as opposed to chemical bonding at interfaces. According to Nguyen et al. [34], MCOT (modified cyclic olefin ther-
moset) block copolymers are hydrophobic, have very low moisture absorption (typically less than 0.1%), and have
polar and non-polar segments (Figure 10.8b-2); paste adhesives of them as die-attach materials are reinforced to
impart adequate adhesion BGA (ball grid array) packages of semiconductors via compatible interactions, similar
to those illustrated in Figure 10.8a.
As a property of a system consisting of a bulk adhesive and at least two substrates with or without the use of a
primer, adhesion has deep historical roots in mechanical and specific theories, that is, those focusing on porous,
rough surface topology, and molecular adsorption of adhesives into the substrates, respectively [35]. According
to searchable online resources [36], there are still strong arguments disputing that surface tension (e.g., 0.05 N
in force), chemical bonding (e.g., 0.01 N), and even mechanical interlocking (e.g., nearly 0.0N) are insignificant;
rather, entanglement (e.g., 100 N) and dissipation (e.g., 100 N) at interphases play leading roles in adhesion while
intermingling (e.g., 1.0 N) complements. Regardless, and in practice, chemical bonds, such as silane coupling and
crosslinking (Figure 10.9a), and other covalent interactions (such as chelating on metal) have been extensively
studied and implemented in formulations of coatings, adhesives, and sealants, particularly for reactive systems
that are standalone or in addition to uncontroversial surface activation of substrates as discussed earlier, to improve
adhesion and its durability, directly and indirectly.

10 Adhesion and Adhesion Promotion
10.3.3
Monomeric and polymeric silanes
Silanes (such as the simplest SiH4), organo-silanes (containing at least one Si-C bond, such as Si-CH3),
organo-functional or hybrid silanes (i.e., covalently bonded, Figures 10.9b and 10.10a) [37], silane-terminated
or -modified polymers (STP), particularly STP-E, that is, STP-ether/polyether (or silyl-modified polyether or
MS-polymers, Figure 10.10b-4), and STP-U, that is, STP-urethane/polyurethane (or silyl-modified PURs or simply
SPUR or SPUR-polymers, Figure 10.10b-5), predominate in reaction-driven adhesion promotion as reactive
primers, additives, or bulk resins in adhesives. They are typically applied to inorganic substrates containing OH
groups, such as glass, metal, wood, and concrete, rather than organic substrates, such as PE or PP, unless the
surface is pretreated. Remarkably, and equally important, organo-functional silanes or similar compounds used
as a primer or additive should compatibly match the solubility parameter of the bulk resins to ensure smooth tran-
sitions in the interphase. Formation of an inter-penetrating network (IPN) at the interface appears to be essential
and probably explains the improved adhesion observed with thermoplastic substrates (refer to Figure 10.8a). On
the other hand, sustainability of adhesives and coatings in the long-term context of a burgeoning circular and
sustainable economy is also important. Conagen, for instance, has developed a de-bondable structural adhesive
[38] with reversibility based on biobased ingredients that exhibit the bonding strength of traditionally cured adhe-
sives and outperforms petroleum-based products with the added benefit of transitioning to a flowable material
upon heating (i.e., viscous debonding). It is also noteworthy that GluECO Adhesives, a manufacturer specializing
in sustainable adhesives, coatings, and binders, has been granted the United States Department of Agriculture
(USDA) Certification for its BondAmaizeTM adhesive, which is composed of 98% biobased material [39].
Monomeric silanes are those containing the stable and nonpolar carbon-silicon (C-Si) bond (318 kJ/mol), and
in the presence of an alkyl group (such as −CH3) they give rise to low surface energy and hydrophobic effects,
which are frequently leveraged in improving the barrier performance of coatings, if compatibly formulated, but
are not necessarily relevant to adhesion. When it comes to organo-functional or hybrid silanes as adhesion promot-
ers through covalent bond formation, the mechanisms are primarily two-fold, namely, i) suitable coupling with
substrates (Steps 3 and 4 including complementary H-bonding in Figure 10.11a) through hydrolysis and subse-
quent condensation (Steps 1 and 2 including self-polymerization in Figure 10.11a), and ii) concurrent crosslinking
with bulk adhesive resins via organo-functional groups, such as amino or epoxy groups in silanes (such as a-1/2/3
in Figure 10.10a) to react with epoxy resins or amine curing agents, if present, or a vinyl or methacrylate group

(such as b-2/3 in Figure 10.9b) in silanes to react with styrene or unsaturated polyester resins in the bulk adhe-
sive, respectively. For example, Dynasylan AMEO (Figure 10.10a-1), Siquest A-1170 (Figure 10.10a-2), GLYMO
(Figure 10.10a-3) and other silanes are claimed as adhesion promoters in epoxy powder coatings at loading levels
of 0.3–0.6% by weight [40]. It should be noted that GLYMO has a universal affinity for glass, metal, and concrete;
nevertheless, it can only be utilized on the epoxy side of 2K formulations due to its glycidyl activity, which cre-
ates stability concerns otherwise. In addition, substrates on which dipodal silanes, such as Dynasylan 1122, 1124
and Gelest SIB 1817.0, perform to synergically promote adhesion and surface modification in an excellent-to-poor
order are silica glass, aluminum, silicone, copper, steel, zinc, and marble/chalk, which are correlated to surface
tension, compatibility (act as a solvent), and amounts of OH groups on surfaces.
As seen in Figure 10.9b, larger alkoxy groups react more slowly, with t-butoxy hydrolyzing at the fastest rate,
followed by isopropoxy and ethoxy; however, there is also an alpha effect, that is, e−-donors result in faster hydrol-
ysis. As seen in Figure 10.11a, both initial hydrolysis with moisture to produce silanols (i.e., aqueous silanes)
and final condensation with OH groups to form siloxane bonds are required in the complete coupling process of
adhesion promotion; the relative reaction rates of hydrolysis and condensation are pH-dependent with regard to
process stability. As exhibited in Figure 10.11b, the lowest hydrolysis and condensation rates occur at pH 7.0 and
∼4.0, whereas the highest rates of hydrolysis and condensation occur at low pH’s (e.g., 1–2) and high pH’s ∼10.0,
respectively. The optimal pH range for hydrolysis and condensation is therefore between 3.6 and 5.0 [41]. The
presence of water typically delays silanol condensation while boosting silane hydrolysis.
In a limited sense, amino-, epoxy-, and vinyl-functional silanes are regarded as universal mono-podal silane
adhesion promoters. As listed in Table 10.5, Silquest A-1100, -187, and -174 are examples of such organo-functional
silanes with the appropriate compatibility and effectiveness, respectively. In specific, epoxy-functional Silquest
A-187 and comparable silanes are best suited for aqueous systems of acrylic (containing OH or COOH groups),
epoxy, phenolic, and polyurethane (PUR), as well as non-aqueous systems of epoxy, 1K PUR, and polysulfide.
Instead, Silquest A-1100 and alternatives are nearly universally applicable to non-aqueous systems, such as acrylic
(with OH- or COOH-functional groups), phenolic, 2K PUR, melamine, SPUR prepolymer, condensation-cure
silicone (where a silane requires moisture to activate), and filled RTV (room temperature vulcanized) silicone
systems. Silquest A-174 and substitutes, including methacryloxy-functional, are favored in unsaturated polyester
coatings and addition-cure silicone (such as silicon hydride and C=C; refer to Figure 9.13c in Chapter 9) sys-
tems. When coupled with amines or glycidyls, vinyl-functional silanes improve package stability due to their fast

formulations.
Polymeric silanes, particularly STP-E (such as Kaneka’s MS polymers) and STP-U (such as Momentive’s var-
ious SPUR+ prepolymers), are more effective than monomeric silanes for enabling high-performance adhesive
and sealant formulations with favorable 1K room temperature and moisture cure. MS polymers with a linear
polyether chain impart flexibility; slower cure reactions of them improve adhesion, toughness, and tear resis-
tance; high elongation at break is easily tailorable and achievable by employing di-alkoxy silyl types (such as
dimethoxy, Figure 10.10b-4) to crosslink to a lesser extent. Three alkoxy groups per silicon atom, resulting in a
highly crosslinked modulus (thus no more absorbing stresses, unfavorable for adhesives), are not always advan-
tageous, as they reduce tensile strength, lower elongation to break, and initiate skin formation much earlier.
Obviously, a single alkoxy group will behave as a thermoplastic polymer with no crosslinks between linear back-
bones and a crosslinking density (CD or xld) of zero (CD or xld = polymer density/MW of segments). Tear and
tensile properties improve as CD or xld continues to increase; however, the tear strength increases rapidly to a
maximum before decreasing slowly, while the tensile strength increases at a slower pace. SPUR prepolymers, on
the other hand, represent a host of appealing silane end-capped PURs that combine a silane-curing mechanism
with a cured (no longer reactive) PUR backbone. As a result of the properties derived from these prepolymers
as building blocks, formulators have a great deal of latitude to assemble products that meet the diverse and spe-
cific performance requirements of end users in industries such as construction, automotive, and others that face
sizeable challenges in developing durable sealants and adhesives. There is no need to use toxic aromatic iso-
cyanates to produce SPUR polymers, which also exhibit advantageous tear resistance (especially when fewer
hydrolysable silane groups are used), improved paint-ability compared to silicone, and significantly improved
non-bubbling curing compared to PURs; however, STP-U (Figure 10.10b-5) has a higher processing viscosity than
STP-E due to H-bonding between the urea units formed during end-capping. Recently, an attentive review of STP-U
from the perspective of structure-property relationships was published by Karna et al. [44]. Kaneka for STP-E or
MS-polymers, Covestro for Desmoseal STP-U, Incorez for Incorez-STP, Clariant for Licocene SI HMs, Evonik for
Vestoplast HMs, PCC for SiSiB silanes and silicones, and Dow-Dupont and TIB Chemicals for catalysts are among
the leading manufacturers and suppliers of STPs.
As an example, 100% thermoplastic APAO (amorphous poly alpha olefin; refer to Figure 10.1)-based HMs
can be bulkily modified with silanes to improve heat resistance and adhesion. A silane-modified APAO, a

10.3 Substrates and Interfaces
431
semi-crystalline solid at 100 ∘C, is generated by grafting vinyl-functional silanes onto olefin monomer blends
during free-radical polymerization. As a result, a suitable HM adhesive or sealant can be formulated as follows:
15% unmodified APAO by weight, 15% butyl rubber, 50% modified APAO, 10% carbon black, 7% moisture
scavenger such as zeolite 3A, 1.5% catalyst such as DBTDL, and 1.5% adhesion promoter such as GLYMO. Silane
modification increases green strength, tear strength, and melting point due to crosslinking of silane groups by
moisture upon application and overtime by days; as tested, chemical adhesion per lap shear strength increases
from ∼0.7 to 3.5 MPa on wood, from 0.1 to 1.8 MPa on glass, and from 0.4 to 0.6 MPa on aluminum, due to coupling
of the silane groups to each of the substrates after condensation. AMEO (i.e., APTES) at a loading of 0.1–2% and
dibutyltin di-acetylacetonate at a loading of 0.1–2% are optional adhesion promoters and catalyst substitutes,
respectively.
Curing (hydrolysis and condensation) rates of hybrid silane coupling agents are also dependent on catalysts
such as tin derivatives, which are, with few exceptions, known to be similarly effective for polyurethanes
(PURs) [45]. The following is a brief summary of the reactivity and compatibility of organometallic catalysts for
moisture-curable silane and silicone systems, with partial reference to Table 4.4 in Chapter 4 and in contrast
to Karstedt catalysts described for hydrosilylation (refer to Figure 9.20m in Chapter 9). Stannous octoate is
a crosslinking catalyst suited for 1K MS-silyl formulations with a slow crosslinking rate. Dioctyltin dilaurate
(DOTDL) is a common catalyst for silane-modified polyolefin (XPE) pipes and STPs with low toxicity. DBTDL is
a multi-purpose catalyst for silicone resins, XPE, and STPs. Dioctyltin diketonoate is excellent for 1/2K MS-silyl
systems due to its low toxicity. Dioctyltin stannoxane is more active than DBTDL and works well with 2K MS-silyl,
silicone elastomeric resins, and XPE. Dibutyltin diketonoate is a highly reactive and effective catalyst for 1K
MS-silyl formulations, as is a blend of dibutyltin diketonoate and VTMO (vinyl trimethoxysilane). Dioctyltin
diacetate (DOTA) is a low-toxicity alternative to TIB-Chemicals’ TIB KAT 233 for silicone resins and STPs, as is
dibutyltin diacetate (DBTA) with a higher activity than DBTDL. Bismuth and nickel octoates are environmentally
safe substitutes for DBTDL, increasing surface hardness, flexibility, and resistance to high temperatures. DABCO
(such as Evonik’s diazabicyclooctane), a highly nucleophilic amine catalyst for coatings, including PURs, is
allegedly effective in STP-based adhesives. In addition, titanates (refer to a7 Tyzor TnBT in Table 10.2b and
Table 9.12 in Chapter 9) are appropriate catalysts; for example, a patent [46] describes an adhesive composed
of epoxy-functional silanes (such as GLYEO) and Ti alkoxides (such as orthobutyl titanate) in a molar ratio
of Si to Ti ranging from 1–20 to one. Still, additionally, Zn(AcAc)2 (i.e., zinc acetylacetonate or ZnAcAc, Tm
138–140 ∘C), Al(AcAc)3 (Tm 190–193 ∘C), and Fe(AcAc)3 (red color, Tm 180–181 ∘C) may be effective for STPs
and silane systems, subject to validation in practice, as all are highly active for PURs and cyanate esters, assisting
in the reduction and elimination of hot spots in powder, adhesive, molding, building blocks, and packaging
systems.
Notably, and to reiterate, 1K moisture-curable PUR adhesives, including HMs (refer to Table 10.2), contain
isocyanate (not silane)-terminated prepolymers derived from polymerizing reactions between typically aromatic
isocyanates in excess and aliphatic polyols in advance, which differs from those 1/2K moisture-curing silicone
adhesives in terms of bulk composition. Residual −NCO groups at the end of PUR backbone chains readily react
further with water (as a chain extender for termination) upon exposure to moisture after application, which may
cause foaming due to the release of carbon dioxide (CO2). As noted, moisture-curable silicone adhesives are pre-
dominantly 1/2K elastic solutions utilizing active silane end-capped prepolymers, such as STP-E and STP-U. Still
notably, and as schemed in Figure 10.12 (also refer to Table 10.3a), cyanoacrylate-based superglues cure instantly
in the presence of small amounts of water or water vapor by producing intermediate ions that continue reacting
with other cyanoacrylate molecules until a long chain of them all connect as a polymer, firmly adhering to each
other and to substrates [47]. There are no detectable chemical reactions between cyanoacrylates and substrates,
but mechanical interactions play a vital role in adhesion. Summarily, moisture-curing adhesives are comprised
primarily of silane/silicone, PUR, and cyanoacrylate chemistry, with hybrid silanes self-crosslinking and reacting
with certain substrates containing OH groups.

10.3.4
Other adhesion promoters and adhesive polymers
Chemically similar to hybrid silanes, non-toxic/-carcinogenic organometallic coupling agents have been com-
mercially developed for use as adhesion promoters in coatings and adhesives that are compatible with them. As
illustrated in Figure 10.13a, the X and OH units in these complexes, which correspond to the organo-functional
and alkoxy silyl groups in silanes, are exclusively reactive with resins and substrates, respectively. Chartsil series
products represent such dual-functional adhesion promoters with various solvent carriers, such as water, ethylene
glycol (EG), propylene glycol (PG), and dipropylene glycol (DPG); for instance, Chartsil C-523.2H and B-515.1/2H
are hybrid OH-/COOH-functional adhesion promoters suited for polyesters and amino-functional adhesion pro-
moters suited for epoxy systems, respectively. Due to debonding or loss of adhesion over time, the lack of reliability
of adhesives and sealants poses the largest issue. For WB systems, adhesion promoters such as Chartsil, pyrogallic
acid, tannin acid (refer to Figure 7.1j in Chapter 7), and catechol (refer to Figure 10.14g) may be more stable than
silanes. Specifically, at a given loading level, Chartsil adhesion promoters tended to maintain adhesion ratings of
about 10, while silanes gradually degraded from 10 to less than six over a period of 12 months, as determined by

scrape testing in accordance with ASTM D2197. Notably, dipodal bis-trimethoxysilyl ethane (BTSE) is superior
to, for example, mono-podal AMEO (refer to Figure 10.10a-1) in developing barrier properties due to a massive
increase in polarization resistance after appropriate curing, resulting in a pinhole-free film [43]. Applicable to
elastomeric, thermoplastic, and thermosetting polymers, organic titanates and/or organic zirconates as coupling
agents and catalysts improve adhesion-promoting performance [48] in coatings, adhesives, and sealants due in
part to steric and polar effects. It is anticipated that these adhesion promoters will exhibit more advanced proper-
ties (including stability) than silanes, which are almost standard additives for covalent bonding to metal substrates,
as coupling agents for fillers, etc. Ken-React® KR-TTS from Kenrich Petrochemicals, also known as isopropyl tita-
nium IV tris(isostearate), is an example of such a titanate. Nonetheless, specific compatibility with all intended
systems should always be proactively addressed.
Trends in adhesion-focused adhesives and coatings include, but are not limited to, low VOCs, including pro WB,
new materials such as bio-based and ecologically friendly, novel formulations such as 1/2K, new methods such
as application-specific preference, and extremely adaptable hybrids. Examples of adhesive resins and polymers
include, but are not limited to, Kraton’s epoxidized di-block or Ep/Di (such as Kraton L207, Figure 10.13c) for
cationic UV-curable PSAs, Britrez’s Epilok epoxies for RTV, Adeka’s chelate-modified and low chlorine epoxies
(such as EP-49) for high adhesion and corrosion resistance, Hexion’s VeoVa vinyl esters and silanes (which are
free of isocyanates or NISO), and Dura Chemicals’ and Galata Chemicals’ metal-organic catalysts. Particularly,
UV-curable PSAs and HMPSAs are transitioning from free-radical to cationic; the epoxy to end-capped mono-ol
ratio in Kraton L207 is crucial for optimizing PSA performance, with a ratio of 2.5–1.5 by weight (by partially
substituting with low MW rosin alcohol) providing high peel, tack, and shear [49]. Regarding low VOCs (i.e.,
targets < 50 g/l, < 25 g/l most challenging), examples include, but are not limited to, acrylic polyols for acrylic latex
coatings, WB self-crosslinking technology for high-performance concrete coatings, NMP-free PURs, polyamide
polyol-based PURs (more polar than polyester polyols, thus more favorable for adhesion, Figure 10.13d), low
temperature application (LAT) WB epoxy coatings, 2K WB epoxy-modified cementitious self-levelers, and
Sherwin-Williams’ glass flake epoxy systems for excellent adhesion and weatherability.
Notably, semi-crystalline aliphatic polyamides have been developed, consisting of 35–100% by weight of
such polyamides (derived from metaxylene diamine or MXDA and C6-C12 aliphatic dicarboxylic acid), 0–25%
polyolefins, 25–60% glass fibers, and others, for high adhesion to metal substrates [51]. Still notably, water-soluble
chitosan (Figure 10.13b), a bio-compatible, naturally occurring, film-forming polysaccharide with dual OH- and
amino-functionalities, is introduced as an adhesive [52]. Examples of substrate pretreatments include, but are

not limited to, zinc phosphates, a dilute phosphoric acid solution for ferrous metals (converted to an integral
mildly protective layer of insoluble crystalline phosphate on the surface), and basic zinc chromate-vinyl butyral
as a wash primer for both adhesion improvement and rusting prevention. Regarding epoxy-modified self-leveling
cement-based coatings in particular, epoxy-modified concrete (EMC) is a subset of polymer-modified concrete
(PMC, such as thermoplastic PVAc, SBR, and acrylic) that uses a reactive epoxy emulsion or dispersion to
strengthen interfacial adhesion and durability. Industrial flooring (frequently exposed to aggressive environments
and traffic conditions) utilizing hydraulic cement (consisting of water, fine aggregates, coarse aggregates, and
additives such as white sugar) has poor chemical resistance to acids, which can be greatly improved along with
bonding strength by employing EMC that undergoes epoxy-amine reactions in tandem with regular cement hard-
ening (hydration). In general, the open times for high, medium, and low EMC binder formulations (equivalent to
22, 14, and 5%) are 25, 35, and 45 min, respectively. Noteworthily, dry shake hardeners, which are factory blended
materials consisting of a cementitious binder, admixtures, aggregates, and other additives, are intended to impart
a cost-effective and long-lasting finish for industrial concrete floors or flooring. The styrene acrylic polymer
Acronal NX 4627 from BASF is developed for pavement bonding coats with high adhesion and tracking reduction;
Acronal 4F (Tg −40 ∘C), a viscous acrylic liquid plasticizer, can also improve adhesion and flexibility. According
to Momentive, CoatOsil MP200 (EEW 250), an epoxy-functional silane oligomer, when incorporated at up to 1.0%
in 1K WB acrylic (such as Alberdingk® AS 2040) wood coatings or 2K WB epoxy concrete floor coatings, improves
wet adhesion and other properties including scrub resistance, staining, abrasion, and corrosion (per salt spray),
particularly when combined in 2K formulations with CoatOsil DRI at up to 10% on the side of amines while
MP200 is loaded on the other side of epoxies. CoatOsil DRI (Tg −41 ∘C) is a hydrophobic silane that is curable and
forms a film at room temperature; it improves water- and UV-resistance when used as a post-add co-binder (with
an acrylic latex) in wood coatings, for instance. Notably, chilled surfaces, such as those with temperatures as low
as −30 ∘C covering concrete surfaces and marine structures during the winter months, reduce corrosion rates but
worsen water condensation conditions [53], which are likely detrimental to adhesion. According to Deng et al.
[54], polymeric ionic liquids offer excellent dynamic adhesive strength on a variety of substrates under very cold
circumstances.
A multi-component self-leveler is described in Table 10.6 as a topcoat for floor substrates, such as wood bowl-
ing lanes, for generating a surface coating layer with excellent adhesion, a low coefficient of friction (COF) as
situationally preferred, and high impact resistance [55]. The proprietary 1K high-solids (HS) SB formulation,
which is toughened by CSR (core/shell rubber) particles of OH-functional Albidur PU 5640, employs melamine
(such as Resimene CE-7103, 98% solids) and acid (such as p-TSA) chemistry (refer to Table 8.7 in Chapter 8)
to cure an OH-functional styrene acrylic polymer (such as Joncryl 507, EW-OH 500, 80% solids by weight) in
a PCBTF-containing solvent, where HMMM self-condensation also occurs. With the weight ratio of polyol to
melamine falling preferably between 0.4 and 1.3, the self-leveling coating has a Brookfield viscosity as low as
63.0 cPs and a touch time of 2.5 min at room temperature, resulting in superior adhesion rated at 10, impact resis-
tance rated at 10, and COF rated at zero according to its QC and characterization (Table 10.6). Low VOCs, low
curing temperature, fast curing and return to service, chemical resistance, and lightfastness are the most impor-
tant requirements for flooring. For example, concrete flooring often incorporates an epoxy primer for adhesion,
an epoxy mid-coat (also known as a self-leveler), and a UV-resistant topcoat. Alternately, or additionally, aliphatic
polycarbamide (such as Evonik’s Amicure IC-221 with zero VOCs, viscosity 350 cPs, EW-NH 379) can be employed
in one part for top and middle coats by reacting with aliphatic polyisocyanate in the other part (such as an HDI
isocyanate trimer at 21.8% NCO) to rapidly develop a chemically resistant, non-yellowing, and abrasion-resistant
polyaspartic film of, for example, 5–20 mils. Asahi Kasei also supplies HDI-polyisocyanates with low viscosity for
super-HS formulations; this should be mentioned. UV absorbers such as Tinuvin 292/1130 (1: 1), molecular sieves
of Type 43 (such as MAPO-43), and optionally Acematt 3600 at a suitably set loading level for a matte finish (such
as 36% gloss at 60∘) may be added to the polycarbamide-containing part of crosslinkers.

It has been observed that photo-curable PA (phytic acid, hydrophobic)-GMA (glycidyl methacrylate) hybrids
(Figure 10.13e) greatly improve adhesion of UV-curable coatings to metal substrates [50], outperforming
commercial phosphate esters, including epoxy phosphates, for adhesion and corrosion protection. As is well
known, epoxy phosphate esters provide adhesion to difficult galvanized and aluminum surfaces by acid etching
and chelating interactions of phosphor-affiliated hydroxyl groups. In addition, VD-3, a dual tertiary amine- and
hydroxyl-functional molecule best suited for COOH-functional polyester/TGIC systems, and VD-5 (Tm 80–90 ∘C,
Figure 10.14d), a dual tertiary amine- and silane-functional compound (basically silane-modified melamine)
suitable for epoxies and PURs, both from Shikoku Chemicals, represent one of the hybrid adhesion-promoting
technologies that enhance adhesiveness to metal substrates via coordination bonding. Other effective hybrid
adhesion promoters perhaps include certain dual-functional surfactants, alkyl phosphate amine esters, and
amino-functional metal-organic complexes (as opposed to amino-functional silicones as previously discussed;
refer to Figure 2.4 in Chapter 2). Considering acids and salts, pyrogallic acid (PGA, Tm 132 ∘C; refer to Table 5.12
in Chapter 5, e.g., supplied by Wego Chemical Groups) and metal acetylacetonates supposedly promote adhesion
to metal substrates in a similar manner. As a patent discloses [56], aromatic compounds having pyrogallol
groups improve adhesion to metal surfaces. Chemically analogous to PGA, catechol (Figure 10.14g) also acts
as an adhesion promoter in adhesives due to its chelating properties [57]. Catechol moieties establish adhesion
specifically via chelating with metal ions (coordination bonds), covalently bonding with organic surfaces, and
H-bonding with inorganic surfaces. It has been discovered that mussel adhesives have DOPA-containing catechol
moieties that exhibit strong underwater adhesion, strong affinity to Cu2+ and Fe3+ ions (weaker affinity to Zn2+),
and mono(catecholamine) derivatives that improve selectivity to Fe3+ [58]. Mussel Polymers Inc. has created
poly-catechol-styrene (PCS, MW 20k–150k, Tg 126 ∘C) copolymers as an adhesion-promoting primer. Consider-
ing bases, a polydopamine (PDA) adhesive filled with zinc or graphene particles as a primer has been patented
[59] to boost adhesion to thermoplastic composite substrates. PDA has strong adhesion to biomaterials and
nanoparticles, requiring an alkaline condition (pH > 7.5) and oxygen for self-polymerization unless hydrothermal
conditions (i.e., high temperature and high pressure) are present (Figure 10.13f); PDA polymerization also takes
place in plasma-activated water at an acidic pH (< 5.5) and in the absence of oxygen (Figure 10.13g) [60]. Gelatin
(containing −NH2, −COOH, and −OH moieties) and/or DOPA-modified polyphenols, such as catecholamines,

436
10 Adhesion and Adhesion Promotion
phenolic amino acids, tannins, and lignins, are used as bioadhesives [61, 62]. Notably, reduced graphene oxide
(abbreviated rGo) is reportedly used as an adhesion promoter in FBE powder coatings [63].
In addition, most sulfur-containing (including primarily reactive −SH, i.e., thiols, and secondarily non-reactive
−S−) compounds demonstrate their ability to improve adhesion, flexibility, moisture, chemical resistance, and
toughening; thiols can serve as crosslinking of rapid cure responses to epoxies (refer to Table 2.3f in Chapter 2),
isocyanates, and acrylates/BMI via Michael Addition (refer to Figure 9.20c in Chapter 9) [64], among others.
TDPA (i.e., 3, 3′-thiodipropionic acid, Tm 132 ∘C, Figure 10.14a) can be employed as an adhesion promoter; PXDT
(i.e., 1, 4-benzenedimethanethiol, a primary thiol, f = 2, Tm 45 ∘C, Figure 10.14b, supplied by SC Organic Chem)
and BDMP (Figure 10.14c), that is, 1, 4-butane diol bis(3-mercaptopropionate), can be used as an epoxy curing
agent. Polyfunctional aliphatic thiols such as TEMPIC (Figure 10.14e, supplied by SC Organic Chem, Bruno Bock,
and Evans Chemicals) are primarily used as chain extenders in epoxide curing to impart advantageous prop-
erties such as moisture resistance, flexibility, and improved adhesion to difficult metals. Note that TEMPIC, a
tri-functional primary thiol liquid, has a completely different functionality from TEPIC (EEW 102–110), which
is epoxy-functional in powder form similar to TGIC (refer to Table 2.3e in Chapter 2) and is used primarily for
crosslinking COOH-functional polyesters. Showa Denko’s Karenz MT NR (EW-SH 189, f = 3, Figure 10.14f) and
PE1 (Figure 10.14f) are secondary thiol liquids that are photo-curable or as epoxy hardeners in combination with
DMP-30 (an accelerator; refer to Table 2.5b in Chapter 2) to provide adhesion, flexibility, acid/alkaline resistance,
and rapid cure despite a weak odor. On the market, TMTG, TMMP, PETG, and PETP (Figure 10.14f) are sup-
plied by companies such as SC Organic Chem, Evans Chemicals, and Bruno Bock. Waxy TS-G (refer to Figure
2.10b in Chapter 2), a unique tetra-functional thiol compound from Shikoku Chemicals, is capable of crosslink-
ing epoxy adhesives and sealants at low temperatures for high Tgs and barrier performance (resisting humidity,
acids, and alkalis); the typical molar ratio of epoxy to thiol in all start formulations is 1-to-1. Notably, Momentive’s
CoatOsil T-Cure (EW-SH ∼251, f = 3) is a sulfur and silane hybrid oligomer that enables formulators to leverage
the structural and mercapto-/silane-functional performance sought for certain demanding end applications. All of
these thiol compounds, however, have concerns with odor and decomposition; therefore, it is preferable to avoid
applying and curing them at elevated temperatures.
According to a recent survey [65], the global market for adhesion promoters was worth USD 3.40 billion in 2021
and is predicted to reach USD 3.87 billion by 2030. Rising and expanding demand for resins, polymers (including
rubber, inks, paints, coatings, adhesives, and sealants), and composites in the automotive, construction, and elec-
tronics industries are the primary growth drivers; for instance, multilayer packaging promotes rapid expansion in
the packaging sector. However, environmental issues with aromatic hydrocarbons and recycling are the greatest
impediments. The majority of formulation strategies are situationally determined by end-user applications. As an
illustration, dimethyl glutaric esters can be used as an additive or primer to improve the adhesion of coatings,
inks, adhesives, and sealants to substrates of interest, as can maleic anhydride (functioning similarly to PGA’s and
catechol’s chelating mechanisms) and derivatives (such as PolybondTM 3200 from SI Group) for chemicals, paints,
and plastics. Some dual-functional compounds, whether liquid or powder, such as anhydride acrylate adducts (e.g.,
H1206, H1217, and H1231 from DKSH/DM Healthcare Products) and acrylate phosphates (e.g., H1218, H1270,
and H1283 from DKSH/DM Healthcare Products), primarily di- or tri-f, are regarded as effective adhesion pro-
moters, subject to verification and specific end applications. Oxygen-containing magnesium (e.g., Mg-hydroxide)
interacts with phosphate compounds (e.g., K- or NH4-phosphate) to establish a chemical bond as an adhesive
primer, as recently disclosed by Leendertse et al. [66]. Additionally, chlorinated polyolefins (in hotmelt form, with
3M playing a leadership role in this regard) are the adhesion promoters of choice for sealants, adhesives, tap layers,
surface primers, and industrial coatings applied to non-polar and LSE substrates, as are titanates and zirconates
[67]. Still, additionally and alternatively, polyorganosiloxanes end-capped with latent ketimine catalysts have been
reported to improve the adhesion and storage stability of adhesives [68]. Nova-Plate® 360 by Sherwin-Williams is
an innovative 2K (a 2: 1 mixing ratio) HS solvent-free and self-priming epoxy coating for tank linings to reduce
voids or porosity and to improve edge coverage as a result of optimization of a high-functionality resin-derived

transient cure that is challenging to manage due to pot life or viscosity buildup. This product has a pot life of two
hours at 7 ∘C and cures to service at 8–50 mil DFT in seven days without delamination or blistering, as assessed
by an aggressive sour gas autoclave during development. Also described (refer to Figure 4.1a in Chapter 4) [69]
are fast- and ambient-curing direct-to-metal coatings with epoxy reacting and AcAc acrylic chelating combined by
amines for aerospace coatings on aluminum substrates. WB basecoats are developed with urethane acrylic hybrid
polymers to exhibit excellent wet and dry adhesion (per GMW 14729 and ISO 2409) to P30-SpectraPrime® primed
aluminum substrates for vehicle refinishing [70]; as a result of their improved sand-ability compared to epoxies,
100% solids PURs are commonly employed as primers for automotive finishes.
10.4
Adhesion Troubleshooting
Figure 10.15a outlines the FMEA (failure mode and effect analysis) and CAPA (corrective and preventive actions)
processes that should be followed for troubleshooting in the event that adhesion fails, regardless of how hard
surface cleaning and preparation are performed or how strongly an adhesive is intended to bond. In brief, the symp-
toms of delamination must be precisely identified (such as tenting cracking as an obvious sign of poor adhesion of
adhesives to substrates), and the failure mode (such as substrate, cohesion, and adhesion failures, Figure 10.15b)
must be diagnosed, identified, and verified step by step, with special attention paid to bonding failure patterns
(such as peeling always occurring at a particular location or under humid conditions), if any. For interfaces with
small bond joints, the use of a microscope is perhaps important.
Depending on specific end applications and value propositions, structural adhesives of high bonding strength,
including instant UV-curing adhesives, while aware of their shrinkage tolerance, should be optionally evaluated or
pre-qualified in lieu of hotmelt adhesives or even PSAs that encounter adhesion failures. Simultaneously, surface
preparation, including pretreatment and priming, of difficult-to-bond substrates, such as LSE plastics, should be
prioritized and adequately addressed. UV activation of thermoplastic surfaces (such as PEEK and PPS) remains an
effective step prior to curing under pressure and, optionally, heat, allowing a thermosetting coating or adhesive to
be properly bonded, as confirmed by a patent disclosure [71]. Note that most reactive coating systems, including

10 Adhesion and Adhesion Promotion
UV coatings, undergo volumetric shrinkage, which can result in a loss of adhesion, particularly when bonding is
primarily mechanical, as with UV systems [72].
To enable wetting by adhesives, the modified surface energy of substrates should be greater than 38 mN/m,
which is comparable to that of acrylic resins (refer to Table 10.4). Wetting (relative to surface tension), surface
morphology (relative to roughness), and surface structure of substrates all influence adhesion, with amorphous
materials generally being easier to adhere to than substrates with moderate or high degrees of crystallinity. The
crystalline structure of PET, which has a surface energy between 41.0 and 45.1 dynes/cm, makes it extremely
difficult to bond. As a general rule, processing factors such as assembly line speed, open time, cure temperature
(T) and time (t) if reactive, moisture concerns, and so on, are better streamlined for adhesive application. As a
general rule, when applying a moisture-curable PUR adhesive, the application temperature should be above 55 ∘F
(∼13 ∘C).
When it comes to improving adhesion to a given substrate, especially for small bonding gaps or joints, it is
wise and prudent to continuously seek incremental but solid improvements rather than perfection all at once.
Once substrate contamination, surface failures, and joint defects have been ruled out, full characterization of an
adhesive to investigate the root cause of adhesion failure should be conducted, as required. Complete qualification
against specifications includes, among others, viscosity at application temperature, softening or melting points if
hotmelts (which are sometimes crucial for delivering capable bonding strength), any impurity or contamination
by FTIR, constitutive viscoelastic (VE) behaviors (including Tg) [74] by DMA rheology, mechanical stress-strain
responses (including flexibility or elongation and toughness) by Instron (on a cured adhesive sample), thermal
stability by TGA, moisture penetration, aging and degradation (such as by color and/or odor), and any partial cure
by DSC. Note that fundamental causes are not always detectable, particularly in the cases of reactive adhesives,
as a result of the mixed factors and interactions that complicate even simple application and service scenarios.
From a rheological standpoint, adhesion is the transformation of a viscous liquid into an elastic solid that loses
its flowability, and delamination is the transformation of an elastic solid back into a viscous liquid that loses its
tackiness.
Debrief A Industrial rheology of adhesives and sealants
As described in Chapters 4 and 5, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) is an effective thermal analysis technique
for characterizing the viscoelastic properties of coatings and adhesives as a function of temperature (T, ∘C) or
frequency (f, Hz). DMA allows the investigation and quantification of physical properties such as a glass transition,
damping, relaxation, and decomposition under specific environmental conditions, as well as phase changes such
as melting, curing, and crystallization. For materials subjected to a very wide range of temperatures, frequencies,
or amplitudes, the time (t)-temperature (T) superposition technique (TTS) can be used to construct a master curve
that facilitates understanding of a material’s constitutive stress-strain responses under extreme conditions that are
otherwise impossible to measure under typical circumstances.
Industrial adhesives
Across industries, adhesives, such as HM adhesives, instant adhesives, PSAs, structural adhesives, and thread
lockers, among others, are utilized to join two substrates and seal and preserve the junction from environmental
degradation. Consequently, it is essential to quantify and compare the performance of adhesives in terms of their
appropriateness for intended applications and their behavior under normal use conditions. The rheology of adhe-
sives is also essential for formulators and engineers to comprehend the viscoelastic behaviors of adhesives and
discover characteristics that best suit their ultimate uses.
Table 10.7 outlines the rheological testing and characterization of industrial adhesives [75], including dynamic
temperature ramps. Temperature ramps are arguably one of highly versatile and technically useful tests to perform
for characterizing the physical and rheological properties of adhesives, such as non-reactive and reactive adhesives,

Tackiness, peel,

Tackiness (cohesion): the speed at which an adhesive
can form a bond to the substrate; Peel (adhesion): overall
strength of the bond between the substrate and adhesive
and PSAs in particular. In a plot of moduli (storage and loss) and Tan𝛿as a function of increasing temperature,
the glass transition (Tg) of an adhesive is the peak of Tan𝛿, indicating the lowest application temperature (if a
PSA); the last G′ and G′′ crossover point (beyond which G′′ > G′) indicates the maximum application temperature
of an adhesive. The storage modulus (G′) is often used as a measure of cohesive strength, and a high G′ at high
f’s typically indicates a high peel strength, while a high G′ at low f’s typically indicates a high shear resistance.
The loss modulus (G′′) is frequently employed as a measure of adhesive strength, and high G′′ at high f’s typically
indicates a strong peel strength at the interface, whereas high G′′ at low f’s typically indicates a high adhesion
shear resistance at the interface. A low Tan𝛿value suggests a high cohesive strength, while a high Tan𝛿value
indicates a high adhesion strength. Some reactive (e.g., UV-curing) adhesives are susceptible to shrinkage during
the hardening process, hence impairing their performance. As the adhesive material cures, dries, or hardens,
dynamic time sweeps can measure the change in axial force (i.e., normal force along the axis, N) or the change
in the gap over time, indicating shrinkage throughout the cure period. Notably, all of these tests (Table 10.7) are
prone to user and environmental mistakes, which can compromise their repeatability and reliability.

440
10 Adhesion and Adhesion Promotion
Each of these rheological tests is applicable to electronic adhesives (for electronics bonding, assembly, and man-
ufacture) as well. The market for electronic adhesives is anticipated to attain a value of USD 5.1 billion by 2023,
propelled by the advancements of smart home technologies. The trend is anticipated to generate new market
opportunities for electronic adhesives, with a projected value of USD 12.1 billion by 2033 [76, 77]. One primary
factor driving the growth of the electronics adhesives market is the rapid advancement and iterative innovation in
electronic devices. Adhesive materials that can robustly and reliably form bonds in miniature applications have
become essential due to the increased demand for electronic products that are smaller, lighter, and more com-
pact. The secure attachment of components and the seamless integration of complex electronic systems are both
dependent on electronics adhesives, which are becoming increasingly important due to the trend toward miniatur-
ization. For example, a low-VOC adhesive is utilized in the implementation of Mactac’s CleantapeTM PSA system
for the electronics and EV markets.
Industrial sealants
Silane-modified polymers (SMPs) are one of the industry’s fastest-growing sealant technologies for diverse
construction, automotive, component, and other outdoor applications, as these reactive sealants are solvent-
and isocyanate-free, paintable, and provide high-performance elastic bonding on a variety of substrates. Clariant
and Omya have recently partnered to introduce AddWorks IBC 760 [78], a micronized powder mixture of a
UV absorber, hindered amine light stabilizer (HALS), and antioxidant, for SMP sealants to afford effective light
and heat stabilization against current benzotriazole (BTA)-containing solutions (as one of the hazard-labeled
materials on the market). Specifically, SMP sealants are typically composed of silicone-based polymers (i.e.,
siloxane units of −R1-Si-O-Si-R2−) and are commonly used to prevent fluid infiltration. The majority of sealants
are usually viscous liquids with a rubbery texture when dried and are developed for kitchens and bathrooms
as household and building materials. Important sealant characteristics include resistance to water ingress,
resistance to moderate torsion (twisting), flowability under pressure while quickly regaining their structure
when the pressure is removed, and resistance to creep or sag. Typical household sealants are water-repellent,
durable, and can prevent microbial growth. Typically applied to the intended substrate using a caulk gun, sealants
have the following rheological requirements: i) yield stress must be overcome for flowability in the cartridge,
ii) extensional viscosity must be overcome for flowability through the small nuzzle, iii) structure must be
regained fast to prevent oozing (thixotropic recovery), and iv) being non-slumping or non-sagging.
Controlled rate viscosity profile (CRVP) can be used to rheologically characterize and compare the flowability,
structure, and thixotropic recovery of experimental and commercial sealants. The plot of viscosity (Pa-s) versus
shear or strain rate ( ̇𝛾, 1/s) reveals the absolute viscosity (indicating the stress to maintain flow, customer percep-
tion, and ease of use) as well as the viscosity trends or changes in viscosity in relation to shear rate (indicating
non-Newtonian and shear-thinning behaviors).
Oscillatory stress sweeps provide rheological data, including complex modulus (G*, Pa) and phase angle (𝛿, ∘).
The plot of G* versus oscillation stress (𝜎, Pa) allows comparison of absolute rigidity between sealant samples and
identification of the yield stress point (where G* begins to substantially decrease). Some sealants may require a
greater or lesser amount of stress to break down their structure before they can flow. If the yield stress is too low, the
applied sealant product may sag or slump. The phase angle data gathered during the same test can provide insight
into the material’s state under different stresses. Specifically, a phase angle below 45∘indicates solid dominance,
and a phase angle above 45∘indicates liquid dominance. The yield point is either the point at which the sealant
sample’s behavior begins to change (i.e., when the curve begins to deviate from the plateau) or the stress when the
phase angle is 45∘.
As described in Chapter 5 (refer to Figures 5.18/5.21a and Table 5.19), thixotropy is a time-dependent shear-
thinning property, and a thixotropy study allows for the monitoring of a material’s rheological behavior before
and after the application of an external stress, such as oscillatory or rotational shear. For example, by subjecting
samples to low oscillatory shear (0.1% strain) for 60 sec, followed by high shear (500% strain) for 60 sec to disrupt

10.4 Adhesion Troubleshooting
441
the structure, and then low oscillatory shear (0.1% strain) for 300 sec, a plot of G* versus time (t, sec) is developed
so that changes in the rigidity of the structure and how quickly the material recovers its original structure can be
observed. During high oscillation, all sealant samples should become less rigid, which corresponds to a decrease
in G* values.
Debrief B Reactive adhesives
Reactive adhesives co-exist in the structural, HM, and PSA categories (refer to Figure 10.1). According to a recent
study by Polaris Market Research [79] and a report by ASI [80], the worldwide market for epoxy adhesives (1/2K
and others) was valued at USD 7.2 billion in 2019 and is projected to reach USD 9.6 billion by 2024 and USD 11.6
billion by 2026, covering industries of building and construction (representing the largest share in 2019), trans-
portation, automotive, wind energy, marine, electrical and electronics, and aerospace, led by adhesive and sealant
manufacturers such as Henkel, 3M, HB Fuller, and Avery Dennison. Structural epoxy adhesives are increasingly
utilized in a variety of sectors due to their high shear strength and their ability to bond a wide range of sub-
strates, such as wood, glass, and metal, with minimal shrinkage, improved thermal and chemical resistance, and
cohesive strength. As customized solutions, epoxy adhesives can be adjusted or modified to deliver a broader spec-
trum of properties. For instance, toughened epoxy adhesives are becoming more and more popular in automotive,
construction, and aerospace applications that are increasingly seeking greater strength and chemical resistance.
Moreover, 1K epoxy adhesives are easy to apply (without requiring 2K’s premixing) via trowel or extrusion by
beads and capable of efficiently filling and sealing gaps between surfaces; they are typically cured at moderate tem-
peratures of 250–300 ∘F and exhibit superior adhesion and adhesiveness properties, higher strength, and greater
environmental and chemical resistance.
Notably, mechanical joining and fastening is a market experiencing technological expansion from mechan-
ical fasteners to structural adhesives, such as Click Bond’s adhesive-bonded fasteners (https://www.clickbond
.com/), in industries ranging from automotive to aerospace to energy and construction. Adhesive fastening pro-
vides advantages such as a higher strength-to-weight ratio, improved flexibility, and better fatigue life; however, its
susceptibility to environmental conditions must be considered [81]. As another illustration, when bonding glass
to steel at −20 to 100 ∘F outdoors, the flexibility of adhesives is advantageous because a compatible CTE (coeffi-
cient of thermal expansion) between dissimilar glass, steel, and adhesive is desired, whereas it is difficult to find
an adhesive with a CTE midway between glass and steel. CTE mismatch between substrates and the adhesive is
one cause likely to produce delamination especially when enduring thermal cycles. Epoxy adhesives are typically
rigid, resisting humidity and UV light because glass is exposed to sunlight outside; silicone adhesives are flexible,
minimizing bond line stresses, especially in low-temperature operation environments. PUR adhesives are rather
tough and ideal for bonding automotive windshields, while acrylic adhesives, including UV-curing, afford the right
degree of flexibility for glass bonding. Considering bond durability when exposed to the outdoors, silicone, PUR,
and acrylic adhesives are all viable choices except epoxy ones. Regarding withstanding high humidity, silanes, if
included properly in adhesive formulations, tend to avoid hydrolysis at interfaces.
Figure 10.16 illustrates two specialty acrylic resins that are deserving of introduction. Particularly, difunctional
methyl 2-allyloxymethylacrylate (abbreviated MeAoMA, Figure 10.16a) and structurally comparable compounds
are distinguished by their low viscosity and fast cure via free-radicals to produce flexibility, toughness, high Tgs,
and excellent adhesion. Still particularly, fluorene acrylate monomers, including OGSOL EA-0200 (95% solids
in toluene, f = 2, Figure 10.16b) and EA-0300 (100% solids liquid, f = 2, more flexible), sold commercially by
Osaka Gas Chemicals, are structurally unique. As reported and highly consistent with fluorene-structured epoxies
that exhibit outstanding performance in adhesion, high Tgs, flexibility, toughness, and impermeability (refer to
fluorene monomers in Chapter 6), these fluorene acrylates when using a 50/50 combination of EA0200/DPHA
(Figure 10.16c), as opposed to a similar combination of BPA-diacrylate/DPHA, demonstrate unanimous benefits
in cure shrinkage, heat resistance, water resistance, and thermal stability. Specific quantitative results are curing

shrinkage at 3.8% versus 6.0%, Tg by DMA greater than 220 ∘C versus less than 175 ∘C, water absorption of less than
0.08% versus 0.25%, and 5% weight loss at 416 ∘C versus 375 ∘C for bulk EA0200 and BPA-diacrylate, respectively.
In addition, fluorene acrylates have superior adhesion to ITO (indium tin oxide) films and glass, as well as a
high refractive index greater than 1.60 when employed as optical adhesives; all these structural properties are
fundamentally ascribed to the fluorene structure in related monomers.
Debrief C Organo-functional silanes
Organo-functional silanes denoted by mono-podal Y-R’-Si-(Me)n(OR)3-n (refer to Figure 10.9b) are dual func-
tional (i.e., crosslinkable Y and hydrolysable Si-OR), capable of crosslinking with the Y group and coupling
with hydroxyls (such as moisture absorbed on metal surfaces) via the Si-alkoxy groups, for bulk and interfacial
adhesion, moisture scavenging, and surface tension modifications (conferring compatibility and hydrophobicity).
Self-crosslinking between subsequent silanols (Si-OH) produces −Si-O-Si−linkages (i.e., siloxanes) for cohesion
while simultaneously generating covalent Si-O-M bonds (M = Si, Al, Fe, etc.) for adhesion (refer to Figure 10.11a).
Not the original silanes, but the resulting silanols (Si-OH) readily condense with each other and with metal
hydroxyl (M-OH) groups on the surface of glass, minerals, and metals to form polymeric structures with very sta-
ble Si-O-Si and Si-O-M bonds, allowing chemical surface treatment, coupling, and assembling of very dissimilar or
heterogeneous surfaces to promote adhesion while reducing surface tension for wetting (refer to Figure 10.9a). In
the production of inorganic silica-reinforced organic tire tread compounds, sulfur-functional and sulfur-enhanced
thiolcarboxylate-functional silanes (Figure 10.17a) are regarded as essential coupling agents and processing aids.
Amino acid (e.g., N-acetyl-L-cysteine with −SH, −COOH, and amide functions)-modified polysiloxanes become
vinyl-functional, which facilitates superior adhesion to metal via massive hydrogen bonding [82]. By grafting
vinyl-functional alkoxy silanes onto ethylene monomers with peroxide initiators, polyethylene (PE) with active
silane functionalities is produced. Similarly, crosslinking is employed to enhance the mechanical properties of
thermoplastic vulcanizates, in which silanes serve several roles, including crosslinkers, adhesion promoters, and
even intermediates for the production of in-situ fillers [83]. Organo-functional silanes, or hybrid silanes that
are not necessarily organo-silanes or vice versa, are well-known for their reactivity to various surfaces and their
ability to create interactions and a suitable transition interphase between the adhesive layer and the surface to
be bonded. AMEO-modified graphene oxide has been reported to enhance the toughness and VE properties of
epoxy coatings [84].
Addition of a silane as an additive to adhesive formulations normally begins at 1% by weight prior to performing
DOEs for optimization, if needed; amino silanes should be investigated first when seeking an adhesion promoter. If
minimal or no effect is found on adhesion, the compatibility of silane additives with bulk resins or polymers should
be examined first, followed by catalyst and moisture considerations, as these are required for silane hydrolysis and
condensation reactions. In order for appropriate silanes to be effective in WB systems, the emulsion pH must be

kept close to neutral. Compared to acrylic- and epoxy-polysiloxanes, vinyl-silane monomers provide cost-effective
coating solutions that are moisture-curable and devoid of isocyanates for numerous end markets, such as marine,
protective, and wood coatings.
As noted previously, dipodal silanes increase adhesion more effectively than mono-podal silanes. Gelest Sivate
E610 (Figure 10.17b) is both dipodal and amine-functional, with the ability to form up to six oxane bonds with
substrates as opposed to the three formed by its mono-podal base silane counterpart AMEO, as well as a tight
conformal network of siloxane bonds and reduced water absorption at interfaces. Sivate E610 is structurally iden-
tical to Silquest A-1170 (refer to Figure 10.10a-2) with the exception of ethoxy (C2H5O−)—as opposed to methoxy
(CH3O−)-functional substitutions on silicon atoms. Notably, the crosslinking density of cured siloxane networks
can be modified by substituting one or two of the three hydrolysable alkoxy groups per silicon to achieve adhesive
hardness varying from highly rigid to highly flexible (refer to the discussion on STP-E with two hydrolysable alkoxy
groups per silicon in Figure 10.10b-4). Nanomytept-20 from NEI is marketed as an adhesion promoter comprising
organo-functional silanes, but it functions differently, resulting in films with a graded structure consisting of an
inorganic oxide layer that bonds strongly to steel and a loosely crosslinked top layer containing organo-functional
groups that can react with topcoats. According to Iezzi [85], a 1K polysiloxane non-skid/non-slip coating com-
prises an organo-silane polymer, a polyamide wax rheology modifier (such as Coatex’s Crayvallac PA4 BA 20), and
abrasive aggregates (such as Potters Industries’ Blast-O-Lite glass beads), outperforming 2K epoxy-amine-abrasive
aggregate coatings that risk frequent delamination due to UV degradation. These organo-silane polymers are
essentially isocyanate adducts, resulting from the reaction of an amino-functional alkoxysilane (such as AMEO or
APTES; refer to Figure 10.10a-1) and a polyisocyanate (such as Covestro’s Desmodur N-3400, an aliphatic HDI
uretdione) with an aliphatic-cyclic diamine as the chain extender (such as Dorf Ketal’s Clearlink 1080). Sili-
conates such as Dow Corning’s Xiameter OFS-0772 and -0777 are reactive organo-silanes that are excellent for
acid-resistant WB concrete surfaces and automotive clear coatings. Major contamination concerns about silanes
and silicones are referred to as PDMS residuals, which transform elusively when heated.
Debrief D Anticorrosion of coatings on ferrous metals
According to research conducted by CC Technologies Laboratories, LLC, from 1999 to 2001 and published in
2002, the total estimated annual direct cost of corrosion in the United States (US) is a staggering USD 276 billion,
or approximately 3.1% of the US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1998 [86]. The global anticorrosion coatings
market reached approximately USD 11.81 billion in 2022 and is forecast to grow up to USD 17.75 billion in 2027
[87], including coating products of epoxy, PUR, acrylic, alkyd, sacrificial zinc, chlorinated rubber, and others for
end-user industries of marine, oil and gas, industrial manufacturing, construction, energy, automotive, and others,
as well as being led by companies such as 3M, Sherwin-Williams, PPG, AkzoNobel, RPM International, BASF, Dow
Chemical, Dupont, Hempel, Jotun, Wacker Chemie, and others. The architectural segment has been expanding
due to rising construction and infrastructure investments, as have the metal packaging (or metal coil coating)
and the automotive refinish sectors, owing to rising demand in the food and beverage industry and rising living
standards in emerging economies, respectively. Due to VOC reduction, powder and WB coatings will also continue

to acquire market share over the predicted period. It has been reported by Li et al. [88] that a highly strong WB
adhesive composed of PVA (polyvinyl alcohol)/PAA (polyacrylic acid) complexes can achieve adhesion strengths
of up to 5.9 MPa on glass and 14.3 MPa on wood substrates with long-term stability.
As seen in Figure 10.18a, steel corrosion electrochemically comprises a pseudo battery system consisting of
anodic (i.e., iron) and cathodic (i.e., water and solved oxygen) elements operating in a closed circuit. At the anode,
an oxidative half-reaction of iron (Reaction 1 in Figure 10.18b) produces iron (II) ions (Fe2+); simultaneously,
at the cathode, a reductive half reaction of water and dissolved oxygen combined (Reaction 2 in Figure 10.18b)
releases hydroxide ions (OH−) or the reduction of hydrogen, that is, 2H+(aq) + e−→H2(g) or the combination
of both as Reaction 4 (Figure 10.18b). As H+ ions are consumed, the pH increases and the system becomes less
acidic, causing OH−to exist in water and allowing Reaction 5 (Figure 10.18b) to take place. As shown in Reaction
3 (Figure 10.18b), the overall electrochemical reaction that consumes dissolved oxygen (O2), water, and iron (i.e.,
the substrate) initially produces soluble Fe2+ and OH−. Fe2+ ions can not only temporarily precipitate with OH−to
form greenish Fe(OH)2 but can also be further oxidized into Fe3+ and precipitate permanently as a reddish-brown
deposit of Fe(OH)3 (Reactions 6 and 7 in Figure 10.18b, respectively) or in a dehydrated form of Fe2O3 ⋅3H2O,
the ultimate formula of true iron rust. Such a circular system runs spontaneously unless it is stopped by severing
any or all of those three elements, resulting in the worldwide and daily occurrence of rusting holes in automotive
bodywork and metal roofing. Iron corrodes more rapidly in salt water (such as seawater having between 3.5 and
5.0% NaCl), which is a strong electrolyte solution that enables electrons (e−’s) to travel more freely as well as at
high temperatures. Seawater with a high concentration of chlorine ions (Cl−) is hence more corrosive than plain
water. Due to this, sea sand with a high Cl−content should not be used in construction; similarly, in terms of
chemistry, the CDT (cathodic disbondment test; refer to Figure 4.10a in Chapter 5) designated primarily for oil
and gas pipelines uses salt water to accelerate corrosion effects, from which a small amount of chlorine gas (CI2)
with an irritating odor is typically produced.
Wet adhesion and moisture resistance to deter the contact of moisture or oxygen with metal are the most impor-
tant performance indicators for surface coatings and adhesives that operate to resist or prevent corrosion. High
adhesion-sustaining bonding with substrates minimizes surface areas possibly in contact with moisture while pre-
venting or delaying the occurrence of moisture contact with substrates. Moisture resistance, or impermeability of
a coating, on the other hand, delays the passage of water molecules (containing dissolved oxygen) onto substrate
surfaces, preventing the formation of a closed circuit between metal and water and oxygen. Poor adhesion indicates
delamination one way or the other that puts metal in contact with water that diffuses into the interface, so corro-
sion occurs. As stated, corrosion occurs more frequently in the presence of salt water and at high temperatures.
In addition to the CDT, the autoclave with harsh HTHP settings, the 85/85 test, the HWA test, and maybe others

(depending on the application) are methods for measuring the wet adhesion and moisture impermeability of coat-
ings and adhesives. Epoxies via co-/homo-polymerization and acrylates via Michael Addition reactions are both
applicable to a wide range of substrates for superior adhesion performance, as previously indicated. According to
highlighted narratives in chapters and from the perspectives of bulk resin and polymer chemistry, fluorene epoxy
coatings (refer to relevant discussion in Chapter 6), hybrid BOX-BMI coatings (refer to relevant discussion and
Table 7.9 in Chapter 7), and certain silane- and/or thiol-enhanced formulations have so far demonstrated superior
wet/dry adhesion and impermeability, both desired for maximum corrosion protection at elevated temperatures,
if successfully implemented.
From the perspectives of additives and fillers, formulation strategies that promote anticorrosion performance
by enhancing adhesion include, but are not limited to, the integration of high aspect ratio (AR) fillers and cor-
rosion inhibitors, including corrosion-inhibiting pigments. Such high AR (e.g., > 10) fillers of plate or fibrous
morphology include talc, mica, glass flakes, mono-/bi-layer graphene, minerals such as NYAD’s Nyglos 8, fibril-
lated HDPE such as STUFF ESS50F (refer to Tables 10.1a/b), and others. These fillers and their combinations
are preferably surface-treated (e.g., by silanes) for compatibility and optimized for incorporation into a partic-
ular coating system in terms of the loading level, the microscopic particle size (e.g., 5–10 μm), leveling, and
other rheological effects so as to maximize barrier impermeability, cohesive toughness, and elongation at break,
which overall complement adhesion to eliminate or minimize cracking-related delamination. Zinc, lead, and
chromate are conventional corrosion inhibitors that impede corrosion reactions [89]. For instance, zinc galva-
nizes the surface of steel, forming a barrier that prevents oxygen and moisture from reaching steel and acting
as a sacrificial anode since zinc has a greater negative potential than steel (refer to Table 10.4). Lately, it has
been revealed that ZnAl alloys improve adhesion, impermeability, and passivation for corrosion resistance supe-
rior to spherical zinc with a loading level that is even one-third less [90]. Similar to lead, chromate produces
a mixed trivalent/hexavalent chromium oxo-hydroxide on metal surfaces, which inhibits or slows the oxygen
reduction (cathodic) reaction while raising the alloy’s pitting potential. It should be noted that lead and chro-
mate are regulated since, for example, hexavalent chromium or chromium (VI) is unequivocally toxic. Some
eco-friendly corrosion-inhibiting pigments are inorganic phosphate specialties, typically white and non-refractive,
with the ability to passivate metallic surfaces of substrates via polarization, in which the electrode potential of the
surface is shifted to an anodic or cathodic state, causing the surface to become more electropositive or electroneg-
ative. This effect actively inhibits corrosion reactions by interfering with the electrolytes essential to initiating
the corrosion process; that is to say, it encourages the natural growth of the metal’s protective oxide layer, ren-
dering the substrate inert. Inhibitive pigments can also guard against macroscopic defects through self-healing,
that is, by leaching into a defective area from adjacent areas. ICL’s low-oil-absorbing HALOX® SZP-391 is one
of the most efficient and versatile corrosion-inhibiting pigments, making it the pigment of choice for protective
primers with a dry film thickness (DFT) of less than one milliradian (or 1 mil) or 25.4 μm. At a loading level of,
for example, 5–10% by weight, Corrosion-inhibiting pigments are suitable for use in a wide range of resin prim-
ing systems, including alkyds (conventional, high solids, and water reducible), epoxies, latexes, high-acid-value
resins, and more. Heubach’s Heucophos ZPA (a modified orthophosphate), Heucophos ZAM+ (a broad-spectrum
anticorrosive), ICL’s Halox® 430 (a heavy metal-free calcium phosphate), and cerium oxide (against localized
corrosion) are examples of commercially available benign corrosion inhibitors. Zinc-based corrosion inhibitors
having one or more thiol moieties [91], such as InhibiCorTM 1000 (Figure 10.19a) by WPC Technologies, rep-
resent a class of commercially available specialties. Corrosion-resistant (2K) coatings can be formulated with
such corrosion resistant additives in combination with GLYMO (refer to Figure 10.10a-3), as reported by Kinlen
et al. [92]. Oxygen scavengers like sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) are also corrosion-inhibiting substances. Hexigone
has launched its Intelli-ion® technology and highly effective and environmentally friendly corrosion inhibitors to
the market to replace heavy metals, phosphates, and toxic chromates. EcoVadis has awarded Hexigone its Gold
Sustainability Rating for Intelli-ion® technology. Notably, amine (including 4-amino-antipyrine or AAP)-modified
graphene oxides (GOs), an important graphene derivative rich in hydrophilic groups such as COOHs, have been

reported to enhance the corrosion resistance of epoxy coatings (including WB) [93, 94], in addition to benzotri-
azole (BTA) in epoxy coatings disclosed for both corrosion inhibition and drag-reduction [95], aqueous zinc-rich
coatings in which the zinc particles are surface-treated with BTA for enhanced cathodic corrosion protection [96],
and tannic acid-modified cerium-montmorillonite nanofiller (refer to Tables 10.1a/b for nanoparticle containing
adhesives)-enhanced PUR coatings have demonstrated for long-term corrosion resistance [97]. The use of zeolite
imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), a subclass of MOFs (metal organic frameworks), particularly ZIF-8, as a superhy-
drophobic addition in anticorrosive coatings has been extensively reviewed by Zhang et al. [98]. Two-dimensional
(2D) materials, such as 2D-films and -nanosheets (primarily graphene, boron nitride, and MXene), have been
extensively studied for corrosion protection on metals, as reviewed by Wang et al. [99].
Increasing efforts are being made to microencapsulate corrosion inhibitors and other functional ingredients
for responsive smart coatings to combat corrosion [100−103], although the capability of microcapsules to release
from cured coating films effectively and economically is still a matter of debate. Microencapsulation of corrosion
inhibitors by a chemical process is technically achievable, depending on the initial form of the inhibitor to be
encapsulated. Interfacial polymerization can be employed to make W/O microcapsules for a WB inhibitor and
O/W microcapsules for a SB corrosion inhibitor (refer to details in Chapter 8), for instance. However, unless a
capsule size greater than 50 μm is required, physical processes, such as dip (or fluid bed) coating, are generally
unsuitable for microencapsulating corrosion inhibitors in solid form. Noteworthy, magnesium (Mg)-rich primers
have been reported by McMahon et al. [104] to improve the galvanic corrosion resistance of non-ferrous aluminum,
the most extensively used substrate in aerospace applications.
Finally, in terms of applied electrochemistry, modeling corrosion (such as galvanic, crevice, pitting, stress crack-
ing, and general uniform corrosion) and corrosion protection (such as anodic and cathodic protection) [105] is
a valuable technique. It involves primarily the Butler-Volmer equation (combining Faraday’s law and Arrhenius
expressions; NOTE: combining Faraday’s law and Gibbs equations results in Nernst equations) in terms of bulk
electrochemical reactions and the so-called Nernst-Planck equations in terms of transport phenomena of oxygen
and electrolyte domains as boundary conditions at the metal surfaces.
Debrief E Polythiol reactions
Oxygen (O) and sulfur (S) are Group VIa elements, with oxygen being more electronegative than sulfur; hence,
−OH anions are more basic than −SH anions, or H2O (water) is more basic than H2S. Acidic polythiols, that
is, R-SH’s, also referred to as polymercaptans, are structurally similar to but chemically more reactive than
polyols (primarily aliphatic R-OH’s, not Ph-OH’s or polyphenols). They are highly reactive toward epoxies
(amine-promoted; refer to Table 2.3f and Figure 2.10c in Chapter 2), isocyanates (Figure 10.19b), acrylates/vinyl
esters (refer to thiol-Michael Addition depicted in Figure 9.20c of Chapter 9), and general ene (C=C) bonds
(aliphatic and cyclic vinyl, such as BMIs; refer to Figure 10.19c), including vinyl-functional PDMSs [106] and

polythiols as chain extenders [107]. These polythiol-containing crosslinking reactions are applicable to various
curing systems (e.g., UV, thermal) of coatings and adhesives with high curing speed, low shrinkage, high
crosslinking density, good flexibility, reduced oxygen inhibition in UV curing, as well as excellent adhesion to a
wide range of substrates, including MSE and LSE plastics (PET, PC, PMMA, etc.).
Polymercaptans, especially modified ones with desirable low odor, are capable of curing epoxies (at an
epoxide-to-thiol molar ratio ≥1) of 2K formulations at ambient and low temperatures, bonding incompatible
materials (such as metal and glass), and customizing gel times from 40 sec to 60 min as needed. Thiol-ene click
polyaddition reactions, that is, hydrothiolation as opposed to hydrosilylation (refer to Figure 9.13c in Chapter 9),
may be fabricated for corrosion inhibition [108] and organosilicon compound synthesis [109]. Primary amines
(refer to Figure 2.10c in Chapter 2), tertiary amines such as imidazole and DBU, that is, 1, 8-diazabicyclo
[5.4.0] undec-7-ene, and others are viable catalysts for polythiol reactions. It would be interesting to compare the
structural performance of phenyl polythiols (Ph-SH’s) to that of phenyl polyols (Ph-OH’s) if Ph-SH-containing
resins were commercially available as crosslinkers. In addition to those already mentioned, Guangzhou Green
New Materials of China and Thin-A T&C of South Korea are also noteworthy polythiol suppliers.
Recaps and Highlights
Green and renewable resources, materials, and energy, sustainable and circular (long-lasting and low emission)
processes and products, and other social and economic megatrends such as digitalization and artificial intelligence
(AI) will continue to dynamically impact and transform the global market and technology for coatings, adhesives,
sealants, and elastomers (CASEs). For instance, more than 8,000 patent applications are filed daily on a global
scale, and at least a fraction of them almost always relate to adhesives and adhesion.
Epoxy, acrylate, and PUR that are irreversibly cured onto adherends predominate over other structural adhesives
such as silicone, anaerobic, and instant due to their reactive chemistries and high adhesion or bonding strength.
Each of them accepts viable 1K or 2K formulations, with the exception that, for example, 1K epoxies often require
heat to accelerate curing, and 1K acrylates require the incorporation of effective inhibitors to prevent premature
curing and activators to catalyze surfaces prior to application. Non-structural adhesives are predominately HMs,
constituting a significant and expanding category (such as for packaging and assembly) comprised of primarily 1K
non-reactive polymers that are thermally reversible and have a comparatively lower bonding strength than reactive
polymers. PSAs, which are also predominantly non-reactive and have an even lower bonding strength than HMs,
are in some ways indispensable to our daily lives (e.g., bandages and postage stamps), but their class is not defined
by their applications but rather by their characteristics of tacky and instant binding upon a nominal pressure. A
structural adhesive can be formulated with UV-curable acrylic, as can an HM, PSA, or HMPSA. Cure kinetics by
DSC (such as dynamic heating or isothermal) and rheological behaviors by DMA (such as temperature ramps at a
specific frequency and strain) are essential to the characterization of reactive adhesives and coatings. Specifically,
cure kinetics directs the application of appropriate cure schedules (refer to Figure 10.3a), while rheology reveals
the corresponding minimal viscosity (i.e., 𝜂*min) and gelation (e.g., Tgel indicating the gelling temperature and
tgel indicating the time to gel), two crucial processing parameters that determine adhesion development (refer to
Figure 10.3b). In general, a lower 𝜂*min and a longer tgel are conducive to stronger adhesion development; also,
a higher modulus at and beyond gelation is indicative of stronger bonding strength. As a rule of thumb, a green
lap shear strength of 50 psi (0.34 MPa) developed in 20 to 30 min is indicative of an acceptable tack-free state
and handleability. DMA analysis is adhesively instructive for non-reactive adhesives, including most HMs, by
dividing the temperature ramp profiles of G′, G′′, and Tan𝛿(i.e., G′′/G′) into four distinctive regions correlated
to a number of real-world performance metrics. These characteristics consist of low temperature flexibility (G′
close to G′′ at low temperatures close to Tg), high temperature resistance (G′ and G′′ at high temperatures close
to Tm), service temperature range (i.e., in-use temperature zone corresponding to the rubbery plateau; refer to

448
10 Adhesion and Adhesion Promotion
Figure 10.4a), peel strength (G′), cohesion (Tan𝛿plateau), hardness and flexibility (Tg as indicated by Tan𝛿peak
temperature—horizontal), wetting out (Tan𝛿peak value—vertical), open time (beyond Tm), setting time (to the
middle of Tan𝛿plateau), compatibility of a polymer blend (Tan𝛿peak divergence), and so on. For PSAs to remain
effectively tacky, Dahlquist Criteria (i.e., G′ < 0.1 MPa at room temperature and 1.0 Hz) is an acceptable rule of
thumb.
Reactive adhesives best suited for bonding composites (primarily CFRPs) are MMA, PURs, and epoxies, all of
which provide sufficient structural bonding strength in addition to individual advantages such as rapid cure and
low surface tension of acrylates, fast set time and good color match of PURs (e.g., ideal for interior auto trim),
and extremely high strength of epoxies (e.g., up to 38 N/mm2), respectively. In general, 1K structural adhesives
are more popular on the market than 2K counterparts, unless a fast cure rate is required, due to application sim-
plicity and the absence of premixing requirements; in particular, 1K ambient temperature-curable epoxies can
develop tensile strengths of up to 41 N/mm2 on metal substrates. Regardless of cure chemistry and applicable to
1/2K designs, adhesive formulations are almost always preferred to be toughened and reinforced with reactive
co-binder resins (e.g., Kane Ace MX-257 and AER 4152; refer to Table 10.1a) and non-reactive fillers or addi-
tives of high aspect ratios (e.g., fibrillar HDPE; refer to Table 10.1b) to make bond lines less susceptible to shear-
or tensile-induced cracking delamination. Considering UV curability and cure speed, cyanoacrylates, acrylates,
vinyl-functional compounds (such as styrene and PIB), and polymers (such as PUR and silicone) are superior in
this regard, with the shrinkage of the acrylate cure being able to be improved and oxygen inhibition being able to
be mitigated, as discussed in Chapter 9. Principal moisture-curable chemistries include cyanoacrylates utilizing
water as an initiator, PURs utilizing water as a chain extender, and silicones utilizing water for silane hydroly-
sis. From the perspectives of surface tension and substrate wetting, acrylates and silicones are superior to epoxies
and PURs for adhering onto non-polar and LSE substrates without pretreatments or preferably with appropriate
surface activation or priming, such as by chlorinated rubber or similar compounds containing both polar and
nonpolar units for non-reactive interactions (such as interlocking and diffusion) and by carbene insertion (refer
to Figure 3.12 in Chapter 3) for reactive interactions. Considering the molecular weights (MWs) of polymers,
cohesion and flexibility increases as MWs increase, while flexibility often decrease after reaching a maximum due
to random entanglements of macromolecules (i.e., fundamentally similar to epoxy coatings with an infinite FI;
refer to crosslinker-free formulations in Chapter 6). As Tg increases, crosslinking density increases and flexibility
decreases, and vice versa. As modulus rises, permeability and T-peel both decrease, but chemical and thermal
stability rise. In addition, tensile and shear strength initially increase and subsequently decrease after reaching a
maximum as modulus continuously rises.
Organo-functional or hybrid silanes are the most typical reactive coupling agents and adhesion promoters, fol-
lowed by silane-terminated polymers (STPs) such as STP-E and STP-U, metal-organic complexes such as Chartsil,
chelating aids such as pyrogallic acid (PGA) and catechol and the like, thiol-containing crosslinkers such as Karenz
MT, and combinations such as VD-5 (dual functional of thiols and silanes), among others. Hydrosilylation-based
beta-diketone primers for adhesion to metal are reported by Lee [110], as illustrated schematically in Figure 10.20,
where methylene (refer to structurally analogous AAEM in Figure 3.10a of Chapter 3) and oxirane groups remain
reactive with crosslinkers (such as amines, if any) in a bulk coating. STPs, which have a low modulus and improved
tensile strength while retaining good elongation properties, are eco-friendly, free of isocyanates or solvents (or
plasticizers), extremely flexible, provide excellent durability of adhesion (i.e., UV and heat resistance) with lim-
ited surface treatments, are easy-to-apply as a single component, and cure fast as industrial and engineering
adhesives, sealants, and coating systems. STP-U combines the benefits of silicone (such as high elasticity) and
PUR (such as paintability and mechanical strength). For example, Wacker’s proprietary 𝛼-silane-modified STP-U
polymers (refer to Figures 10.9b/10.10b) cure completely and rapidly while exhibiting outstanding adhesive prop-
erties, being tin-free, and, if required, plasticizer-free. Not to be forgotten, end-capped silanes must hydrolyze
into silanol, preferably under an appropriate catalysis (such as by organotin derivatives or titanates), which then
undergoes self- and co-condensation to form covalent bonds, that is, crosslinked Si-O-Si and Si-O-M, respectively.

Dipodal silanes (such as Sivate E610 and Silquest A-1170; refer to Figures 10.17b/10.10a-2, respectively) are supe-
rior to mono-podal silanes (such as ATPES, AMEO, or E610’s base silane; refer to Figure 10.10a-1) for developing
adhesion and flexibility. Highly flexible adhesives can be formulated utilizing STPs with one or two of the three
hydrolysable Si-OR with Si-R’ replacements per silicon; flexibility (related to CTE) is one of the performance vari-
ables enhancing adhesion.
Systematically synergic and synergically systematic adhesion is the outcome of the interaction between three
structural and functional bonding components: the substrate, the interface, and the film-forming adhesive. An
interface serving to bridge substrates and an adhesive is less physically visible and hence more difficult to define
than substrates and adhesives for a specific joint, laminate, or assembly. As a result, surface preparation by physical
and chemical means, such as mechanical roughing (if metal substrates), including laser texturing [111], energetic
plasma cleaning, organo-functional silane priming if polar HSE surfaces, and chlorinated rubber activation or
diazirine priming if nonpolar LSE surfaces, is a prerequisite for maximizing adhesion and other supporting proper-
ties. Note that F—H—F is the strongest H-bonding, which can be directly measured using high-resolution atomic
force microscopy (AFM) [112]. As exemplified in Table 10.8, an adhesive for structural bonding and a surface coat-
ing for anticorrosion should be selected so as to be compatible with the substrate and in line with the intended
end applications. Toughened epoxies, including 1/2K formulations, are the preferred adhesives for conventional
metals, as are toughened acrylates for TPO substrates. Thiols and polythiols are a class of strong crosslinkers
suitable for rapid curing at low temperatures, adhesion, and chemical and corrosion resistance. Optionally, zinc
primers and corrosion inhibitors are used for utmost corrosion protection, especially when combined with highly
adhesive and impermeable coatings, such as fluorene-based monomers, which are epoxy-functional for coatings
(refer to relevant discussion in Chapter 6), acrylic-functional for adhesives (refer to Figure 10.16b), and functional
BOX-BMI powder coatings (refer to relevant discussion in Chapter 7 of phenolic coatings).
When diagnosing adhesion failure, it is essential to have an equal understanding of the three systematic elements
of adhesion. This includes substrates, which are centered on polarity and surface energy; interfaces (surface prepa-
ration), which are centered on cleaning and activation, if any; and adhesives, which are centered on application
and end-use conditions such as application temperature, time, RH (especially if moisture-curable), viscosity, and
aging. Cohesion failure is often connected to adhesive toughness, whereas adhesion failure is primarily related
to the constitutive viscoelasticity of adhesives if substrates and interfaces are disregarded. Stress-strain correla-
tions, which are more typical of reactive adhesives, can also be utilized to evaluate bonding strength, including,
if applicable, the yield stress. Other bulk adhesive properties, such as resistance to moisture, chemicals, and heat,
compatibility with interfaces, degradation and fatigue, creep resistance, and partial cure, may contribute to adhe-
sion failure to varying degrees.
Unequivocally, no one force governs intrinsic adhesion bonds independently. Figure 10.21 comprehensively
explains how molecular bonding (such as covalence and ionic interactions), electrostatic interactions (such as
stronger H-bonds and weaker van der Waals forces), mechanical interlocking, situationally capillary and viscous
forces, and perhaps others all contribute to adhesion and cohesion. Adsorption and diffusion at interfaces are
a result of van der Waals attractions. Mechanical interlocking based on surface topology, including porosity, is
viewed as a viable variable on a macroscopic scale as opposed to a molecular scale, as is the case with other vari-
ables. According to Zhang et al. [113], a combination of H-bonding and ionic interactions introduced into siloxane

matrices using zwitterionic groups as side chains and carbamates in major Si-O chains increases adhesion up to
2.0 MPa, as assessed by a pull-off test on epoxy plates. As a performance element and a system quality, adhesion
is pervasive, a vast subject, and an applied science that requires convergence in order to discover a solution. For
instance, it may be more challenging to identify a broad-spectrum adhesive or solve the debonding problem when
it comes to medical adhesives [114] due to additional criteria such as regulation, biocompatibility, repeated ster-
ilization resistance, and tiny bonding joints. In addition, the biomedical and chemical communities appear to be
actively seeking molecular glues (beyond PROTACs) [115, 116] as well as nature-inspired polymers or biomimetic
adhesives [117, 118]. Nevertheless, it is vital to understand adhesive compositions and interfacial interactions, at
least on the molecular level, and to consider the particular application conditions. Quantitative analysis of adhe-
sives (such as DMA) can aid in identifying the fundamental reason for adhesion failure and aid in the development
of ever-better solutions or continuous improvements in a more practical manner, despite its inability to predict
when adhesion will fail.

Closing Remarks
The bulk of the narratives presented in the preceding five parts and ten chapters remain intact, complete,
self-contained, in good standing, and of sufficient integrity. As complimentary ending statements, summaries
and forecasts are provided hereunder. As the first section of this conclusion, the topics and viewpoints offered in
each chapter are condensed into an executive summary, which also includes any additional aspects that should
be stressed. In the second section of this conclusion, forward-looking comments are presented and supported by
concrete illustrations.
Wrap-Ups
Table 11.1 provides a summary of Part I of Materials and Chemistry, which discusses epoxy resins, curing
agents (including hardeners and catalysts), and the cure chemistry of epoxies in light of the value proposition of
structure-property relationships. It is crucial to understand the following about epoxies as materials: traditional
epoxies, also known as DGEBAs, are para-structured, difunctional, and aromatic, providing remarkable structural
performance such as toughness, flexibility, adhesion, and chemical resistance; unconventional epoxies such as
fluorene monomers with enhanced aromaticity elevate their performance to a new level; due to lower aromaticity,
DGEBFs and novolacs perform less well than their DGEBA counterparts (except for acid resistance). Epoxy
homo-polymerization in the absence of crosslinkers and co-polymerization in the presence of crosslinkers are
two additional crucial elements of epoxide ring-opening chemistry that require in-depth study. In addition, it is
essential to comprehend the appropriate cationic activation of epoxy homocures and the compatibility of acrylates
and nonyl phenols as epoxy curing accelerators.
In a similar fashion, Table 11.2 condenses Part II of Methodologies and Characterization, which discusses meth-
ods and illustrative applications, as well as quality control of uncured and cured coatings in accordance with
best practices and established protocols, including value-added thermal analyses of DSC kinetics and DMA rhe-
ology. Running a ladder DOE based on the formulation index (FI) represents a universal formulation strategy for
epoxies, especially when combined with applicable cure kinetics and rheology, with the ability to map out peak
performance (such as flexibility and lowest cure temperature etc.) within the formulation capacity for both exist-
ing products and new developments. In a sense, the quantitative DSC cure kinetics and DMA rheology upon cure
with defined parameters and behaviors, such as A, Ea, m, n, 𝜂*min, the gel point at which the elastic G′ ≅the viscous
G′′, the Tan𝛿peak(s), and vitrification, which provide unbiased insights into the optimal combinations of epoxy
co-cures and homo-cures from the perspectives of structure-property relationships and adhesion, are more than
half the battle in developing robust epoxy formulations and benchmarking competitors. The remainder consists
of physical tests on coating films and fabricated systems, validations, customer applications, aging and durability
tests, regulatory tests, and, if necessary, additional tests.

Other comments/reconciliations
1/Resins
DGEBA or BPA-based: aromatic, MW of the repeating unit
284, linearly structured, di-f exclusively, crosslinkable due
to 4-fold reactive intermediates, most widely used for all
purposes.
DGEBF or BPF-based: aromatic, MW of the repeating unit
256 g/mol, linearly structured, di-f exclusively, lower
melting point.
Novolacs: aromatic, branched BPF containing both para-
and ortho-structures, multi-f, varieties of MW and EEW
depending on original monomers (BPA, phenol, o-cresol,
etc.), better heat resistance.
Modified (aromatic and aliphatic): isocyanate modifications,
glycidyl carbamates (re-arrangement into OH-functional
oxazolidones), miscellaneous, including EPZ and LCPB.
Poly-functional or matrix (besides novolacs) and specialties
(di-f and multi-f), including fluorinated, fluorene,
phthalazinone-based, etc.. Chlorine content affects
corrosion.
Aliphatic and UV-curable: di-f and multi-f, hydrogenated,
alicyclic, etc. Dark cure.
Oxetanes: di-f, multi-f, catalyzed by OTf, slow to start but
fast to cure (versus oxiranes: fast to initiate but usually slow
to cure) forming both 1∘and 2∘aliphatic OHs (versus
oxiranes: either 1∘or 2∘OHs), synergic with aliphatic
epoxies by UV cure.
Other derivatives: self-crosslinkable, phenoxy (high MWs),
vinyl esters (BPA-based, novolac-derived), vitrimers
(recyclable, reprocessable, and reformable).
BPA-free and bio-based: TMBPF, TMBPF-DGE-HQ (di-f,
free of any BPA structure or functionality), for packaging
coatings.

4/Methods and
measurements
Liquids (SB, HS, WB) vs. e-coats vs. powders: powders
superior in terms of 100% solids, zero-VOC, ranges of wet
film thickness, etc.
SB coatings: 1K epoxy using ketimines, ACURE
(malonate/AcAc) and KETAC free of isocyanates, HS, and
solvent-free, typically 2K epoxy-polyamine systems.
WB epoxy coatings (LER, SER, LER/SER, and SER
dispersion): acrylic emulsions, hybrids,
concrete/topcoats/metal, unlikely to match SB in
performance.
E-coats: low VOCs at ∼6%, cathodic (preferred)/anodic, zero
waste, metal priming (thin and uniform).
Powder coatings: heat for compounding and cure, Tm’s of
resins (esp. high MWs) affect gel and cure.
End-uses: OD/ID surface coatings vs. structural laminates
vs. others (encapsulation, injection molding, self-contained
3D printing, etc.).
Wood coatings (ambient and elevated temperature and
radiant energy cure): PUR, acrylic PUR, styrene-free
polyester, melamine and derivative (acid curing), WB UV
1/2K; adhesion, TGIC- or GMA-powders, smoothness, etc.
Cargo and rail coatings: transitioning from SB to WB epoxies
for OD/ID, phosphates for steel and sulfate surfactants for
aluminum, Norsok M-501 offshore and UL2431 onshore,
thermoplastic PVDF vs. thermosetting FEVE; adhesion, OD
UV resistance, chemical resistance, etc.
Coil coatings: thin coat (25 μm priming and topcoat total),
high line speed (400–700 ft/min), requiring weatherability,
OH-functional polyesters or acrylics reacting with blocked
isocyanates or melamine/acid; adhesion, moisture/chemical
resistance, durability, etc.
Floor (epoxy priming, WB epoxy base, and urethane
topcoat) and concrete coatings: liquid epoxies and
cycloaliphatic amines (amine adducts, Mannich bases, and
phenalkamines), cracking resistance (barite and mica),
acrylate flooring (rapid and low temperature cure), vapor
permeability; PUR and polyaspartic for concrete fast return
to service; adhesion, self-leveling, ambient cure,
chemical/impact resistance, flexibility, preferably solvent
free, etc.
Intumescent coatings: vinyl acetates and acrylic
(peroxides—free radicals) for cellulosic fires; epoxies (along
with an acid source, carbon source, gas blowing agent, a
nucleating agent, char formation additive, and thixotropic
additive) exclusively for hydrocarbon fires; thin films for
construction and steel; thick films for oil and gas adhering
to urethane foam; topcoats (e.g., epoxy, PUR, alkyd, acrylic,
etc.) improve durability.
WB is unlikely yet to match
SB in bulk performance
(adhesion, cohesion)
Powder FBEs are superior to
liquid epoxies in almost all
properties (Tg, adhesion,
toughness, flexibility,
chemical resistance, etc.) but
require substantial heat
for cure
Epoxies play no role in liquid
coatings for wood substrates,
but low-melt epoxies are
promising for ultra-LAT
powders for wood (Chap 6)
Formulation index (FI)
represents half the battle in
applied epoxy powder coating
formulations; peak and
optimal performance of
concerns happen at a specific
FI (representing the best
balance of homo- and
co-polymerization
combinations) when
ingredients are fixed
Corrosion resistance: system
property, aluminum
anodization, steel
galvanization, surface
coatings to prevent O2 and
moisture from migration and
in touch with steel or iron
surfaces
Phenolic-cured epoxies are
strong in resisting acids but

Gel time model: tgel = (Ea/R)*(1/T), Ea estimation.
Tg model: Tg-𝛼curves, too conservative an approximation.
MFK kinetics: ̇𝛼= (−Ea/R)*(1/T) or Ea−𝛼(Ea changes with
𝛼), assuming iso-conversion, ignoring reaction orders,
requiring multiple DSc runs at varying heat rates, predicting
isothermal and dynamic cure.
nth-order model: three parameters (A, Ea, and n),
sub-methods estimate A and Ea such as Kissinger plot
(assuming ̇𝛼max takes place at Tpeak), BD approach (multiple
linear regression to approximate n that is always close to
1—first order reaction), Ozawa plot (𝛽∝1/T), and
Ozawa-Flynn-Wall method (𝛽∝1/T); isothermal to estimate
the reaction order n because 𝛼∝𝛥H (reaction heat
released); completed ODE for nth order kinetics establish
cure curves of any kind.
Arrhenius rate equation k(T)
Iso-conversion: Ea (J/mol) at
a certain 𝛼(%) is independent
of temp profiles, for example,
𝛼gel is constant for a specific
formula that won’t gel until
𝛼gel is reached regardless of
temp applied
Typical m and n values are
less than 1 and 2, respectively;
ideally, faster cure
formulations are typical of
small m (e.g., < 0.50) and n
(e.g., < 1.0) values; overall, A,
Ea, m, and n together
determine cure speeds

Autocatalytic model: four parameters (A, Ea, m, and n),
covering dynamic, isothermal, and diffusion (𝛼c) cure profiles,
making no additional assumptions but using experimental
data; MATLAB curve fitting of DSC exotherms or DCS (DSC
curve solutions) retrieves all parameters using a single DSC run
(either dynamically or isothermally); completed ODEs generate
cure curves (iso-α, iso-T, and dynamic heating, etc.); ideally,
fast-cure epoxy powder formulations are moderate Ea (e.g.,
∼50,000 J/mol when A = 25,000), small m (e.g., ∼0.30, a flat
slope before Tpeak), and small n (e.g., ∼0.60, a deep slope after
Tpeak). NOTES: the selection of the α level for establishing a
cure curve should be validated by physical oven testing, so
should the initial value (e.g., x(0) = 1E-6) when using MATLAB
or VisualLab to solve ODEs.
Correlations between kinetic parameters and DSC exotherms:
Ea and A are nominal because of association, Ea correlates to
the horizontal position of Tpeak that correlates to ̇𝛼max, Cp and
𝛥H correlate to the vertical position of Tpeak, m governs the
exothermic curve shape and slope before Tpeak, so does n after
Tpeak, for example, large m and n values indicate a sharper slope
prior to and a flatter slope behind Tpeak, respectively, translating
into slow cure behaviors associated with a high total reaction
order (m plus n).
Other cure kinetic applications: determine processing adequacy
and capability (e.g., post-cure oven settings), compare and
optimize formulations (any reactive ingredients such as resins,
crosslinkers, catalysts, and additives), mapping latent catalysts
for best performance in 1K, QC and stability, competitive
formulation studies, reverse engineering, applicable to both
powder and liquid coatings, etc.
Non-reactive fluids: Newtonian (1D: 𝜂= 𝜏/ ̇𝛾, 3D: 𝜂ue = 3𝜂s)—
purely viscous, linear VE, Bingham fluids (Newtonian with
yield τy); non-Newtonian—𝜂( ̇𝛾) such as shear-thickening/
thinning and 𝜂( ̇𝛾, t) such as VE (LVE—small strains,
NLVE—large strains)/rheopectic/thixotropic; purely elastic
solids (rubber) per Hooke’s Law (1D: G = 𝜏/𝛾, 3D: E = 3G

LVE behaviors: Maxwell (stress relaxation, 𝜆= 𝜂/G)/
Kelvin-Voigt (creep, 𝜆R = 𝜂/E) models; De# = 𝜆/t = 𝜆𝜔
(low—viscous liquids, high—elastic solids).
Non-Newtonian behaviors: 𝜂( ̇𝛾)—strain rate dependent such as
shear-thickening and shear-thinning, for example, per Power
Law or Cross Eqn., and yield stress liquids (pseudoplastic) per
Bingham Eqn.; 𝜂( ̇𝛾, t)—both strain rate and time dependent
such as rheopectic (thickening with time) and thixotropic (both
very large deviations from Newtonian); LVE associated
dynamic responses—G(t, 𝛾), 𝜂*, G′, G′′, Tan𝛿, and J(t) per
Boltzmann superposition, for example, step strain 𝛾, steady flow
( ̇𝛾= constant), etc.; TTS and WLF—dynamic responses at low f
and high T are mutually mirror images; NLVE behaviors—
nonlinear, disentanglement, and deformation (time and
amplitude)-dependent, constitutively described by S.O.F.,
UCM, etc.
The n value typically
increases with Tg of high Tg
formulations, for example,
>1.5 and >150 ∘C along with
𝛥H > |−80 J/g|; a large n

rheological parameters—irreversible gelation (tgel, Tgel, and
𝛼gel, Tan𝛿= 1 or G′ = G′′), minimal viscosity (𝜂*min,

Likewise, Table 11.3 outlines Part III of Formulations and Applications, which focuses on a variety of spe-
cific and novel compositions and end properties of epoxies and phenolics in a broader scope, targeting products
and performance that consumers and the market value. Specifically, cationic catalysts such as onium salts are
fairly compatible with weakly basic tertiary amines such as imidazoles but not with strongly basic primary or
secondary amines, allowing for viable dual cure anionic-cationic epoxy formulations using an imidazole or an
imidazole adduct in conjunction with an onium salt; preferably, an acidic crosslinker such as a phenolic or a
COOH-functional polyester is incorporated to accelerate cure completion in dual cure LAT systems. LAT, it should
be mentioned, refers primarily to rapid curing performance at conventional application temperatures. Discover-
ing and validating VDH (and MOCA) involves identifying an appropriate crosslinker with the lowest possible
melting point in order to produce ultra-LAT powder coatings. Epoxy resins are the decisive element when it
comes to high-Tg epoxy formulations; other components, such as crosslinkers, have a secondary role. Regardless
of whether muti-f amine or di-f phenolic hardeners are employed, appropriately formulated fluorene epoxies can
attain high Tg (e.g., 150–250 ∘C). However, cohesive toughness and flexibility depend heavily on both the resins
and crosslinkers. For instance, di-f and structurally linear BPA-based phenolics, SDH, and BAF can be used as
crosslinkers to cure typical DGEBAs in formulations for extremely flexible coatings. For exceptionally tough coat-
ings, however, conventional DGEBAs are preferably cured with BAF, BCF, BPF, or similar crosslinkers instead
of regular amines or phenolics, unless a specialty epoxy, such as fluorene monomers, is used in tandem as the
bulk resin. Furthermore, difunctional fluorene monomers of enhanced aromaticity and bulkiness likely represent
the highest level of epoxy formulation, imparting exceptional adhesion, toughness, hydrophobicity, and flexibility

1/2K SB: toughening, FIs (high for 1K and low for 2K), silane
couplers (0.3–0.5 phr in 1K or 0.5% in 2K), P/B ratios depending
on applications, dual functional crosslinkers (e.g., DMP-30 and
Mannich bases) preferred for 2K, compatibility of cure

volume (optionally by weight if very high viscosity).
FI-driven optimization: quantified by rheo-kinetics and
physical testing, capturing peak and boundary performance of
existing formulas, predictable trending patterns of concerned
attributes (e.g., gelation, flexibility, Tg, etc.).
Crosslinker-free (FI = ∞): applicable to novolac and DGEBA,
purely epoxy homo-cures (etherification), highest Tg and
shortest gel, good adhesion, tough but not the toughest,
flexibility not maximal due to entanglements of polymer chains
(maximum flexibility associated always with a certain FI level),
unique thermal behaviors (DSC and DMA), best heat resistance
generating super low cure powders (≤125 ∘C) when reinforced
by dual cure (anionic and cationic) catalysts at an optimized
ratio.
BPF-based epoxy formulations: EEW or MW matters, excellent
adhesion, better moisture resistance, comparable or better heat
resistance, lower Tg, poorer impact and flexibility than
BPA-based overall, and regardless of amine or phenolic
hardeners used, gelation occurs after η*min like BPA-based.
Aliphatic epoxies: slower gel and cure, lower Tg, poorer
flexibility/impact/adhesion/heat resistance/moisture resistance
than aromatic DGEBA except UV resistance, regardless of
amine or phenolic crosslinkers used.
Silicone-modified amines: EW-NH matters (EW-NH = 240
seems optimal in adhesion and compatibility, but EW-NH 120
offers competitive flexibility and impact), improve adhesion
and impermeability, but impair toughness and integrity.
Active esters: di- or multi-f, essentially phenolic-functional
derivatives, tertiary amine catalyzable, theoretically eliminating
formation of second OHs affecting polarity and hydrophilicity;
however, benefits in dielectric strength are inconclusive,
comparable or better dry adhesion, and degradable wet
adhesion/moisture resistance at elevated temperatures
(e.g., >75 ∘C) observed.
PBO crosslinkers: di-f, capable and viable, comparable or
slightly poorer impact, inferior flexibility, adverse moisture
resistance at elevated temperatures (e.g., ≥95 ∘C), but slightly
better than active esters.
Fluorene monomers and super heat resistance: Tg up to 250 ∘C
formulatable using di-f fluorene epoxies/amines/phenolics,
exhibiting outstanding adhesion/toughness/impermeability/
flexibility all together with high Tg in one (i.e., 5-in-1)

self-crosslinking (cationic), toughened by phenolic and epoxy
combined at a proper ratio, cure temperature lowered if catalyzed

in addition to steric entanglements that significantly increase Tg in a manner that cannot be achieved by chem-

In a similar fashion, Table 11.4 provides a summary of Part IV of Extended Formulations and Applications,
which discusses microencapsulation, hybrids, and non-epoxy platforms. In-situ (all wall materials in one phase,
either the aqueous or the oil phase) and interfacial (wall materials separated in two phases) polymerizations are
two chemical encapsulating (i.e., capsule wall forming) techniques that are significant because they are essentially
1/2K heterogeneous organic coatings on more challenging liquid (either oily or aqueous) surfaces or substrates and
on a microscopic scale. BOX-BMI and BOX-PN coatings are arguably part of the most advanced non-epoxy hybrid
formulations, outperforming fluorene epoxies in terms of impermeability at elevated temperatures and super dual
Tgs, respectively. As a remarkable exception, PN self-polymerization reveals that a low temperature-cure to gen-
erate exceptionally high Tgs, at least 250–300 ∘C exceeding the maximum limit of epoxies, is fully and audaciously
viable without vitrification concerns, despite the necessity to address processing issues.
Still, in a similar fashion, Table 11.5 presents a synopsis of Part V of Adhesiveness and Adhesion, which cov-
ers adhesives, adhesion, and adhesion promotion. According to one viewpoint, adhesion, cohesion, and Tg are all
required for coated and assembled components exposed to a specific service scenario in order to preserve system
performance over time. For instance, good adhesion to a substrate enhances flexibility and toughness, and vice
versa. It is appropriate to discuss flexibility and toughness in terms of DFT and substrates, as there are significant
differences between flexibility at 1 mil, as with coil coatings, and flexibility at 12 mils or above, as with industrial
coatings. According to another viewpoint, adhesion is promoted, maintained, and degraded by a variety of fac-
tors, such as film forming, close contact, mechanical deformation, chemical bonding (ionic and covalent, e.g., by
organo-functional silanes and versatile polythiols), physical interactions (electrostatic, melting, absorption, inter-
locking, dissipation, etc.), and aging at the molecular level under dry or wet service conditions, depending on the
polarity and surface energy of substrates and interfaces. VE behaviors of an adhesive that are characterized by
DMA prior to and upon cure and bonding strength tests (such as overlap shear), as well as stress-strain responses
post cure and debonding tests (such as T-peel), are the most effective methods for describing and predicting adhe-
sion, preferably relative to a benchmark.
Outlooks
In our ever-changing environment, no technology is ever conceived or invented to last forever. As a result, “We
have always done it this way” is acknowledged as one of the most dangerous statements, as an internet consen-
sus has been reached. At the core of energy consumption and environmental protection technologies, inventions
are always desired. Each day, breakthroughs, innovations, and continuous improvements are delivered in both
large and minor ways. For the first time in more than a century of the human history, a structurally modified
LK-99 (copper-doped lead-apatite) has been reported by Lee et al. [1–3] to exhibit superconductivity (zero elec-
trical resistance and magnetic levitation) at ambient temperature and pressure, the holy grail of physics, as of
August 19, 2023, despite the unencouraging news that replications and verifications are being denied worldwide
[4]. Coincidentally, and most recently, Taj Quantum (https://www.tajquantum.com) was granted a patent for a
Type II superconductor made from perforated graphite and graphene foam that operates at temperatures above
room temperature up to 150 ∘C [5]. On the other hand, US scientists have achieved a net energy gain (ignition) rev-
olution in a fusion power reactor for the second time as of July 30, 2023. From a Kaizen perspective, customers and
the market are always in quest of coating and adhesive products with improved performance, decreased costs, and
increased durability. This permanent trend motivates formulators to continue searching for technologies that are
purposely designed to be more adaptable, predictable, and implementation-efficient, constituting a never-ending
process of iterative innovations and improvements, whether small or substantial, inductive or deductive.

Green and circular
Green and circular is an enduring trend, including green energy and zero emissions. According to a report available
from online resources [6], the global MRO (maintenance, repair, and operations) protective coatings market size
was USD 6.29 billion in 2021 and is anticipated to reach USD 10.17 billion by 2027. This growth will be fueled by
sustainability, specifically, renewable raw materials and resources.
As a result of technological advancements associated with global sustainability, the breadth and depth of
chemical, physical, electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties of coatings and adhesives, which are utilized in
numerous industries, have expanded considerably. Companies are disclosing product carbon footprint (PCF) val-
ues that comply with new industrial standards and sustainability initiatives. Low emissions and environmentally
friendly footprints, including for both HS and WB applications, specifically VOCs less than 100 g/l, preferably
under 50 g/l, and most preferably less than 25 g/l, are one of the paint and coating industry’s ongoing efforts.
For instance, EPS® 2786 from Engineered Polymer Solutions is a new self-crosslinking acrylic resin for both
professional and do-it-yourself (DIY) formulations with near-zero VOCs. In addition to NISO (e.g., the ACURE

technology), including NIPU (e.g., carbamate-functional alkyds crosslinked by formaldehyde-free cyclohexane
dialdehyde [7]), APEO (alkylphenol ethoxylate)-free, styrene-free, BPA levels below 100 ppm, non-halogenated
(e.g., PCBTF-free), PFAS (−per and polyfluoroalkyl substances, such as PFOA-perfluorooctanoic acid)-free,
and primer-free direct-to-metal solutions (e.g., Dow’s MaincoteTM HG-300 latex for anticorrosion and water
resistance), significant efforts continue to be undertaken to achieve these and other objectives. Notably, neither
the performance of WB nor that of BPA-free substitutes is currently comparable to that of SB and BPA in terms of
adhesion, toughness, chemical resistance over time, etc. In addition to CO2 capture and removal landscapes such
as CO2-to-urea [8] and polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) plastic [9], single coats, rapid cure, low cure, bio-based
(such as lignin), and glyoxal are additional examples of green materials and coatings within a more limited
but realizable scope. Particularly, aldehydes, such as glyoxal (refer to Figure 8.8a in Chapter 8), are utilized to
substitute formaldehyde (HCHO) in phenolic and amino-resin systems. Lignin (refer to Figure 2.8a), tannin (refer
to Figure 2.8b in Chapter 2), and cardanol (refer to Figure 7.1e in Chapter 7), which are naturally occurring
organic components comprising reactive molecules (such as Ph-OHs), are utilized in lieu of and in conjunction
with phenols; instead, furfural (refer to Figure 8.8b in Chapter 8), glyoxal, and 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF)
are used to partially and completely replace HCHO [10, 11].
Bio-based materials and coating solutions that have minimal environmental impact continue to gain social and
technical interest, such as bio-based vitrimers [12], including bio-based epoxy vitrimers [13] and biopolymers
(e.g., chitosan, starch, dextran, inulin, or a combination) coupled with a rare earth element compound (e.g., one
or more of the lanthanide series) for anticorrosion [14], to randomly name a few. Particularly, and in relation
to the “green” paradigm, artificial CO2 fixation technologies embrace the synthesis of cyclic carbonate from a
catalyzed insertion reaction between CO2 and epoxides with 100% atom economy [15, 16], among others (e.g.,
one-step CO2-to-methanol [17] and two-step CO2-to-urea [18]). The resulting cyclic carbonate serves as an essen-
tial ingredient in one of the novel NIPU coatings, as previously discussed (refer to Figure 9.20b-1 in Chapter 9
and Figure 4.1 in Chapter 4).
Hybrid and smart
In addition, “go hybrid and smart” is a notable and escalating trend that is closely associated with and par-
tially driven by the ongoing “green and circular” movement. Hybrids are generally referred to as “two-in-one”
or “multiple-in-one” systems because they blend the best of at least two different worlds of materials, chem-
istry, formulations, processes, and applications, whereas “being smart” refers primarily to functionality, such as
self-healing, in addition to simplification and optimization. The global self-healing coatings market, led by compa-
nies like Arkema, BASF, Covestro, DuPont, Evonik Industries, NEI Corp., and Sika AG, is projected to grow from
USD 2.4 billion in 2023 to USD 10.4 billion by 2028 [19]. The following are a few illustrations within the scope of
this monograph that illustrate the proposed path and future outlook.
Polyurethane-acrylate (PUA) coatings, including biodegradable isosorbide-derived PUAs [20], are UV-curable,
self-healing, and have a high wear-resistant hardness and/or flexibility due to dynamic disulfide (−S-S−) bonds
and nano-silica modifications [21, 22], and alternatively modified with dihydroxy organo-montmorillonite
(OMMT) to form an exfoliated structure for enhanced adhesion and abrasion resistance [23]. A hyper-
branched polyester-urethane-acrylate resin (PEUA) has been synthesized from citric acid (CA)-based
polyester-polyol (CAP), which is then reacted with isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) and end-capped with
2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate (HEMA) to form a tetra-functional acrylate precursor (UCAP) for UV-curable coat-
ings on wood and metal substrates [24], as have elastomeric poly(ester amide urethane)s [25]. Epoxy-functional
polyesters (such as EPON 828 and CAPA 2077A-derived) with a fused ring anhydride crosslinker and a cyclic
guanidine accelerator have been studied for their great adhesion (with an overlap shear strength greater than 12
MPa according to ASTM D1002) to metal substrates, including galvanized steel [26]. Hybrid BOX-BMI copolymers

472
11 Closing Remarks
and functional powder coatings, as previously discussed (refer to Chapter 7), have demonstrated the highest
possible adhesion, impermeability, and toughness, in addition to heat resistance, as have BOX-PN hybrids.
Hybrid superhydrophobic-hydrophilic pattern surfaces have been formulated to enable fog harvesting effi-
ciency up to 362.5 mg/cm2-hr [29]. Expanding graphite covalently has been successfully grafted in polyvinyl
chloride chains to create reinforced intumescent polymer with molding fire-retardant structures, as depicted
in Figure 11.1a [27], as have epoxidized tung oils reinforced with graphene and CNTs as alternatives to BPA
[30]. Hybrid organic-inorganic polymeric coatings utilizing sol-gel precursors and epoxy or urea precursors have
been developed [31]. As published by Crawford et al. and per online resources [32, 33], Eastman TetrashieldTM
IC3020 (i.e., a tetramethyl-structured polyester resin; refer to Subsection 9.2.3 in Chapter 9) with the addition
of zinc-free corrosion inhibitors (such as Halox 430) enables DTM applications to have superior corrosion
resistance. Utilizing Hexion’s VeoVa (silane-vinyl esters) or Evonik’s room-temperature-curable Vestanat® EP-E
95 (a silane-polyurethane crosslinker), 1/2K NISO formulations are reached to self-crosslink for a variety of
applications, including protective, industrial, ACE, transportation, wood, and marine. In particular, VeoVa vinyl
silane technology (with excellent hydrophobicity and crosslinking density) provides a 1/2K moisture-curing
alternative to 2K polyurethane coatings for a variety of applications, including anti-graffiti and flooring [34].
In solvent-borne VeoVa systems, certain catalysts, such as tin octoate, are ineffective, dibutyltin diacetate
(DBTDA; refer to Table 4.4 in Chapter 4) is more efficient than DBTDL, and synergistic dual catalysts, such
as neodecanoic acid and AMP (2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol), are preferred for clearcoats. As described in
Figure 11.1b, siloxane-(meth)acrylate macromonomers were synthesized, as reported by Telgenhoff et al. [28],
using a combination of vinyl-hydride hydrosilylation and silane-hydrolysis/-condensation.

1K WB acrylic-epoxy (acrylic-modified epoxy ester in emulsion) paints dry rapidly, increase adhesion and
durability, and reduce VOCs. According to the report by Lutz [35], a hybrid PVDF-acrylic latex has been devel-
oped. Notably, air-drying biopolyurea dispersions strengthened by the addition of an alkyd polyol intermediate
and an aniline trimer as the chain extender appear promising for anticorrosion [36]. Maleic anhydride-modified
alkyd-acrylic hybrid WB coatings, which are COOH-functional and low in VOCs, have been reported to
have excellent water resistance [37], in contrast to conventional alkyds, which are OH-functional, with good
adhesion and gloss but poor water resistance. In another embodiment, a WB hybrid varnish composed of
silicone-acrylate-urethane polymers coupled with a phthalocyanine derivative (Zn- or Al-centered) has been
disclosed by Koˇrinková et al. [38].
Various dual cure-based formulations of coatings and adhesives, including FBE formulations catalyzed by
anionic-cationic catalyst combinations (refer to Chapter 6), UV/thermal curing silicones (refer to Debrief C in
Chapter 9), 1K dual UV/ambient-curing epoxy-acrylate and polythiol (NISO) liquids [39], and dual-cure NIPU
coatings [40, 41], are excellent hybrids. 2K UV acrylic-urethane coatings based on acrylated polyisocyanates
and unsaturated polyester polyols are also exemplary of clever hybrids in that the UV step is used to obtain
instantaneous tack-free handling while the final properties are achieved by dual cure; such systems are modified
by using acrylic oligomers to form acrylic polyols under UV for automotive OEM and refinish (metal) clearcoats
(unpigmented and unfilled) as well as for wood and plastics [42]. Competitively, 1K SB automotive OEM
clearcoats have been formulated with two acrylic resins (such as OH-functional Setalux C-91756 VS-60) of
differing Tgs, a polyester resin, a silicone-modified polyester hybrid resin, a melamine resin, and an acid catalyst
(such as Nacure-5543, a methanol solution of DDBSA at 25% active solids; refer to Table 8.7 in Chapter 8) [43].
Moreover, dual cure acrylic-urethane SB and WB coatings are an active field of research and development; their
WB hybrids (not UV-curing) are typically formulated with a high shear ICI viscosity, such as 3.0 poises (or 300 cPs)
at a shear rate of 10,000 1/s, allowing the fast dry time, non-yellowing, low odor, user-friendly application, and
cleanup of acrylics to be synergistically combined with the adhesion, flow and leveling, durability, and appear-
ance of alkyds. DIY-oriented paints and coatings must have a forgiving application. 1K dual cure PURs, option-
ally UV/moisture or isocyanate-polyol/free-radical [44], are acrylate-urethane prepolymers with end-capped C=C
and/or silane moieties; free-radical thiol-ene and cationic-ene systems use thiols and vinyl ethers to tailor Tg while
taking advantage of their low oxygen inhibition [45]; dual cure cycloaliphatic epoxy silicones use RTV to enhance
primary epoxide UV cure [46]. Hybrid dual cure sealants [47] employ free-radical-initiated thiol-ene chemistry
that is relatively insensitive to oxygen inhibition (than free-radicals through peroxide scission for vinyl); specifi-
cally, a metal complex and an organic peroxide are paired as redox catalysts; the resulting sealants have a short
tack-free time, a longer working time or pot life, a fast cure rate, and resistance to fuels and chemicals.
Noteworthily, it has been reported that hybrid sol-gel and NIPU adhesives exhibit remarkable adhesion to a
wide range of substrates, including glass, even when subjected to extreme conditions (e.g., −196 ∘C) [48]. Con-
currently, the sol-gel (refer to Table 9.10 in Chapter 9) and NIPU are fabricated using APTES (refer to Figure
10.10a-1 in Chapter 10) and tri-functional cyclic carbonate (refer to Figure 9.20b-1 in Chapter 9), respectively.
Additional studies have documented that a hybrid amphiphilic coating constructed of PDMS-PUR(IPDI)-PUA
structures [49, 50] or a fabrication of stratified PDMS-phenolic derivatives (such as eugenol, urushiol, and pyro-
gallic) [51] boosts underwater adhesion and mechanical strength as well as its self-healing, antifouling, and anti-
corrosion performance. Separately, amine-functional PDMS, IPDI, and carbon disulfide (CS2, clear liquid) are first
reacted and then combined with PhOH-functional tannic acid to fabricate PDMS-P(Ua-TUa)-TA composites, in
which hydrogen bonding between tannic acid and polyurea and polythiourea functions drives self-healing and
anti-fouling performance [52]. In addition, dynamically hindered urea bonds enable self-healing and corrosion
resistance in waterborne PUR urea composite coatings [53]. Still noteworthy, new hybrid materials consisting of a
solid acid (CsHSO4) and a coordination polymer and metal-organic framework (CP/MOF) glass with high proton
conductivity over a wide temperature range, including at a low temperature of 65 ∘C, while retaining processability
[54] are promising as solid-state acid fuel-cell electrolytes.
