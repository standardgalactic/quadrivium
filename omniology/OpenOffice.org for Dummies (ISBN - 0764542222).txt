Introduction
W
elcome to OpenOffice.org For Dummies, your friendly companion to
the free office suite. In this book, we explain in plain English how to
make the most of this feature-rich office suite. OpenOffice.org For Dummies
aims to give you all the information you need to start using OpenOffice.org
right away — with no hassle. 
About This Book
As though you hadn’t guessed, OpenOffice.org For Dummies covers the
OpenOffice.org office suite of programs, including Writer (word processor),
Calc (spreadsheet), and Impress (presentation program). We also explain
how to use the HTML editor and Draw, the drawing program.
We comprehensively explain OpenOffice.org’s features, including
 Switching to OpenOffice.org from other office suites
 Creating, editing, and formatting documents in Writer
 Creating form letters
 Working with graphics in all the OpenOffice.org applications
 Creating Web pages with the HTML editor
 Creating, editing, and formatting a spreadsheet in Calc
 Calculating and using functions
 Manipulating data
 Creating, editing, and formatting presentations in Impress
 Animating a presentation
 Creating graphics in Draw
How to Use This Book
You don’t have to read this book from cover to cover. OpenOffice.org For
Dummies provides just the information you need, when you need it. If you

need the spreadsheet, start with Part III, “Using Calc — The Spreadsheet.”
If you need to draw something, go to Part V, “Using Draw — The Graphics
Program.” Read what you need and save the rest for later.
For extra information, don’t pass up Part VI, “The Part of Tens,” where 
we explain ten reasons to use OpenOffice.org and ten places to look for 
support. Our appendixes help you install and configure OpenOffice.org.
Keep OpenOffice.org For Dummies by your computer while you work. You’ll
find it to be a loyal helper.
Foolish Assumptions
We assume that you know at least a little about what a word processor, spread-
sheet, and presentation program help you accomplish. We also assume that
you know the operating system you use. We wrote this book to cover Windows,
Linux, and the Mac OS, all at the same time. Talk about foolish! At any rate,
we assume that you can get over any minor differences due to your operating
system.
Conventions Used in This Book
Sometimes it helps to know why some text is bold and other is italic so that
you can figure out what we’re talking about. New terms are in italics to let you
know that they’re new. Messages and other text that come from OpenOffice.org
are in a special typeface, like this. 
When we say something like “Choose File➪Save As,” it means to click the File
menu at the top of your screen and then choose Save As from the menu that
opens. When we want you to use a toolbar or toolbox button (or tool), we tell
you to click it or choose it. 
How This Book Is Organized
We start by introducing you to OpenOffice.org and its environment. We also
give you some tips about switching to OpenOffice.org from another office suite.
Then we plunge right in and start telling you about each application.

OpenOffice.org For Dummies 

To be more specific, this book is divided into six parts. Each part contains
two or more chapters that relate to that part. Because some features of
OpenOffice.org apply to all the applications, you may find more detail in the
part on Writer, which comes early in the book. For example, we don’t explain
how to spell check three times; instead, we explain it once and then refer to
the first mention later on.
Part I: Introducing OpenOffice.org 
Part I contains important introductory information about OpenOffice.org,
including why it sounds like a Web site, why it’s free, how to get it (it’s on the
CD-ROM that accompanies this book), how it looks, and what applications it
includes.
Chapter 2 explains what OpenOffice.org can do for you at home and at work,
how OpenOffice.org compares to the other office suites out there, and how to
get help.
Part II: Using Writer —
The Word Processor
Part II covers everything you need to know about Writer. Chapter 3 explains
the basics of opening a document, laying out the page, entering and editing
text, navigating through a document, changing views, spell checking, saving,
and printing.
Chapter 4 goes more deeply into formatting, including how to use templates
and styles, choosing fonts, setting up paragraphs, as well as adding numbered
or bulleted lists. Chapter 5 covers how to create complex documents, including
setting up personalized form letters (mail merge); adding borders, frames, and
graphics; creating tables of contents and indexes; and dividing a page into
columns or tables.
Chapter 6 explains how to add hyperlinks and track changes to docu-
ments when you collaborate with others. Chapter 7 covers the HTML
editor that you use to create Web pages. There’s an extra chapter on the
CD-ROM with information on setting options, configuring preferences, and
making macros.

Introduction

Part III: Using Calc — The Spreadsheet
Part III covers the Calc application, which enables you to crunch all the numbers
in your life. Chapter 8 explains how to input data, navigate around your huge
spreadsheets, and save them for posterity. Chapter 9 explains how to select,
move, and copy data as well as how to format your data. Chapter 10 is all about
printing. Chapter 11 tells you how to make your data look good. Chapter 12
covers the details of calculating formulas and using Calc’s built-in functions.
On the CD-ROM, a bonus chapter explains how to use Calc to analyze data.
Part IV: Using Impress —
The Presentation Package
Part IV explains how to create impressive impressions using Impress.
Chapter 13 gives you the basics of creating a new presentation, using the 
various views, adding slides, and saving. Chapter 14 covers editing and 
formatting. Chapter 15 explains how to add images, create backgrounds, 
and work with 3-D effects. Chapter 16 is all about animation. Chapter 17
covers the process of delivering your slide show and printing. On the
CD-ROM, a bonus chapter gives you some tips for setting up Impress. 
Part V: Using Draw —
The Graphics Program
Draw creates great graphics that you can use alone or insert into the other
OpenOffice.org applications. Chapter 18 explains the basics of creating and
editing shapes. On the CD-ROM, a bonus chapter explains layers, curves, fills,
special effects, and 3-D.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
No For Dummies book is complete without its Part of Tens — it’s a tradition!
Chapter 19 gives you ten reasons to use OpenOffice.org, if you’re not already
convinced. Chapter 20 provides ten places to look for support, in addition to
this book, of course.

Appendix
Last, but not least, we come to the appendix. It adds some valuable informa-
tion to the end of this book, including instructions on installing and configur-
ing OpenOffice.org. 
About the CD-ROM
Don’t forget to check out the CD-ROM. It contains OpenOffice.org for
Windows, Linux and Mac OS X, so you don’t have to go far to get it. We
make it easy!
Icons Used in This Book
If you see little pictures in the margins, you have found an icon. Icons point
out special information in the text and quickly let you know if you need to
pay attention or can ignore it.
This icon alerts you to information that you need to keep in mind to avoid
wasting time or falling on your face.
OpenOffice.org has some advanced features you may want to know about —
or skip over entirely. This icon lets you know when we throw the heavier stuff
at you.
Tips help you finish your work more easily, quickly, or effectively. Don’t miss
out on these.
Uh-oh! “Watch out here!” is what this icon is telling you, or else you never
know what may happen.

Introduction

Where to Go from Here
If you don’t already have OpenOffice.org installed, get out the CD-ROM and
install it. Complete instructions for your operating system are in the appen-
dix. Then open OpenOffice.org, turn to Chapter 1 and take the plunge.
Enough of all this talk. Let’s move into the real content of this book and start
using OpenOffice.org!
Enjoy!

 Checking out the applications
 Facing the interface
 Closing OpenOffice.org
O
penOffice.org is an exciting new Office suite program that is extremely
powerful and completely free to everyone. It operates on Windows,
Linux, Macintosh, and Solaris, and it can easily read and write a plethora of
file formats, including Microsoft Office. It is currently available in more than
30 languages, and people all over the world are migrating to OpenOffice.org
for their entire office suite needs. Over sixteen million people currently use
the program, and the total is increasing daily!
You don’t have to pay a single dime to use OpenOffice.org — either now
or in the future! Sounds too good to be true? The more you learn about
OpenOffice.org, the more fascinated you’ll become.
What Is OpenOffice.org?
OpenOffice.org, the Office suite, includes the following four major applications:
 Writer: A full-featured word processor that also includes an HTML editor
for designing Web pages
 Calc: An extremely capable spreadsheet program that also allows you to
link to corporate databases
 Draw: An excellent drawing and graphics program for both 2-D and 3-D

 Impress: A very capable presentation program for creating electronic
slide shows
As its name suggests, OpenOffice.org is also a Web site. The Web site, at
www.openoffice.org, is the home of the project that creates, markets,
and distributes the applications.
What is Writer?
What do you use your word processor for? Jotting down notes to yourself?
Writing letters? Or publishing an entire book with style sheets, automated
indexing and table of contents generation, as well as bibliographies? Whether
your needs are large or small, Writer is up to the job. Figure 1-1 is an example
of a Writer document. Look familiar? This book was written in
OpenOffice.org.
Of course, Writer does all the basic things that word processors do, but it
also allows you to do much more including:
 Design and create your own Web pages.
 Create forms for automatically inputting data into databases.
 Create personalized documents with Mail Merge, and link to your e-mail
address book or external database.
 Use Text Frames and Linking to lay out such documents as newsletters
and flyers.
 Automatically generate standard documents such as letters, faxes, agen-
das, minutes, or import or create your own templates.
 Create your own Style Sheets
 Import seventeen different types of text documents with ease, including
“doc”, and “dot”; and export nineteen different file formats, including
“pdf”, “html” and three kinds of “doc”s.
 Automatic indexing, tables of contents, bibliographical references; plus
such details as custom headers, footers, footnotes, and endnotes.
 Track changes; compare documents, Automatic outlining, Spellchecking,
and Thesaurus. 
 Automatically correct words, or automatically complete words as you
type. (This is all completely customizable, of course.)
 Insert Dynamic fields (such as date and time) and hyperlinks.
 Connect to e-mail software.
 Create and use macros.
10
Part I: Introducing OpenOffice.org 

What is Calc?
Calc can calculate anything you hand it. It’s a full-featured spreadsheet pro-
gram with all the great bells and whistles you’d expect from the best. While
Calc is super at doing all the basic spreadsheet things, such as adding, sort-
ing, manipulating rows and columns, and inserting graphics, Calc also lets
you do the following:
 Link to external databases, such as dBase and MySQL (or even your
email address book) and view, query, sort, filter, generate automatic
reports and more, without affecting your original database.
 Use an intuitive graphical interface to organize your data from your
spreadsheets or database. 
 Filter your spreadsheet or database data to locate information quickly.
 Use automatic subtotaling with outlining capabilities to give you instant
information of the big picture, whenever you need it.
 Use any and all of 364 built-in functions for financial, mathematical,
statistical, database and other purposes. Or create your own formulas.

org.
11
Chapter 1: Getting to Know OpenOffice.org

 Use extensive formatting capabilities, including autoformatting, style
sheets, graphical backgrounds, fancy borders, as well as conditional
formatting.
 Freeze headings, create multiple sheets for a 3-D spreadsheet, use split
sheets, floating frames...
 Validate data (for example, require a specified format, such as a date)
 Save, print, and import and export a variety of formats (including your
favorites)
 Generate 3-D charts, try out goal seeking, protect your documents,
create macros, and lots more.
What is Impress?
Impress creates presentations (also known as slide shows) that you display
from your computer, often with a projector, so that people can see what is on
your screen. Each page of a presentation is called a slide. You add slides to a
presentation and then add text and graphics to each slide. You also have all you
need to create a masterful presentation. Impress allows you to do the following:
 Create a presentation quickly with AutoPilot or a template
 Add notes to each slide that are just for the presenter
 View your presentation in several ways using the Drawing, Outline, Slide,
Notes, Handout, and Slide Show views
 Save, print, and export and import in several formats (including your
favorites)
 Format text characters and paragraphs
 Create bulleted and numbered lists
 Control the look of the presentation with a master slide
 Insert graphics and control them using layers
 Create your own graphics, including 3-D graphics
 Add text animation and slide transitions
What is Draw?
Draw is well integrated with the other OpenOffice.org programs but stands
completely on its own as well. It’s a great drawing program. Of course, it
offers the basic drawing functions, such as the ability to automatically create
lines, curves, circles, squares, 3-D spheres and more, but you can also use the
following more advanced features with Draw:
12
Part I: Introducing OpenOffice.org 

 Customize your own glows, transparencies, gradients, bitmaps, or use
ready-made gradients and import bitmaps.
 Use floating toolbars for easy access to create shapes, curves, lines,
arrows, dimensional brackets, and more.
 Merge, subtract, intersect, rotate, and flip your graphics and otherwise
modify them in many ways.
 Edit points to fine-tune curves and polygons.
 Cross-fade images for animated dissolves and morphing.
 Create text animation for livening up your Web pages or presentations.
 Use smart connectors to create flow-charts and organizational charts.
 Add shadows and 3-D effects; create 3-D objects from 2-D objects.
(Careful, this is addicting.)
 Add shading, texture, lighting, and materials to 3-D graphics; rotate 3-D
objects in three dimensions
 Use layers and groups. 
 Import and export many formats, including SWF Flash Player format.

Chapter 1: Getting to Know OpenOffice.org
Why is OpenOffice.org free?
A few years ago, Sun Microsystems, Inc.
noticed that it was paying Microsoft millions of
dollars for the use of its software, and at the
same time, Sun needed office tools for its
Solaris operating system. Sun then bought a
company called StarDivision, which had cre-
ated an office suite that was competitive in fea-
tures with Microsoft Office, with one important
difference — the suite ran on GNU/Linux and
Solaris operating systems as well as Windows.
The product was called StarOffice.
Sun released the StarOffice programmers’
source code as an open source program and
called it OpenOffice. At the same time, Sun also
sells StarOffice as a proprietary program,
because some clients requested that Sun pro-
vide guarantees and support for the software.
StarOffice adds a few proprietary features 
to OpenOffice, such as licensed templates,
extra clip art, and the Adabas D database, along
with 24-hour support from Sun, and Sun offers
StarOffice at a reasonable price.
By making OpenOffice.org open source, Sun
generated a community of about 100,000 com-
puter programmers and enthusiasts to create
new features, improved documentation, and
provide great support for the program — and all
for free! Everyone is excited about OpenOffice.
org and wants to be a part of this historic
endeavor.
Everyone is welcome to participate in the pro-
ject if you want. If you are a programmer, or even
just an OpenOffice.org enthusiast, you might
find helping out to be almost irresistible.
If you would like a new feature, you can go to
OpenOffice.org, the Web site, and request it. If
you’re a programmer, you can even contribute
a new feature of your own.

OpenOffice.org, the organization, asks that all public communications use
OpenOffice.org when referring to the suite of applications, even though
simply using OpenOffice seems to make more sense. Leave it to the lawyers
and trademark laws to complicate things, but that’s okay, this way we can
always remember where to go for our free upgrades and online support.
Can OpenOffice.org replace
my current office suite?
With OpenOffice.org you can most likely do everything you currently do with
your office suite, and maybe even lots more. You may find OpenOffice.org
to be even more handy than your current Office suite. Users report that
OpenOffice.org is extremely robust and can handle very large, complex
documents with ease. And many users are fond of having their files take up
25 to 60 percent less space than that of the leading office suite. Also since
OpenOffice.org is open source, any security holes are dealt with extremely
quickly. Anyone in the OpenOffice.org community can find and fix any prob-
lem or potential problem in a flash! No waiting for one company to get around
to it. This means it is much less likely that anyone could take over your com-
puter from another location without your knowledge and consent through
OpenOffice.org.
OpenOffice.org was created as a Microsoft Office clone, so Microsoft Office
users generally experience little or no difficulty making the transition.
However some situations do exist where it is not recommended that you
switch to OpenOffice.org. They are as follows:
14
Part I: Introducing OpenOffice.org 
What is open source software?
In open source software, the source code of the
software is freely available to users. If you are a
programmer, you can use, modify, and redis-
tribute the code. (The distribution part has a
few rules.) You are encouraged to participate in
the OpenOffice.org project (actually, one of its
many projects) by contributing to the project —
writing new code, issuing bug reports, writing
documentation, and so on. (You don’t need to be
a programmer to contribute.) You can also join
mailing lists to read about various aspects of the
project on a regular basis.
The OpenOffice.org Web site shows you the
many ways that you can contribute to the pro-
ject and lets you know how to join one or more
of the mailing lists. 

 If your business requires the Exchange Server capabilities of Microsoft
Outlook, This feature allows you to have shared workspaces with other
people on other computers. OpenOffice.org has no substitute for it — at
least not on Windows or Mac. 
 VBA macros written in Microsoft Office, as well as other macros from
other office suites do not convert into OpenOffice.org and must be re-
programmed. (It is estimated that this may affect five percent of office
suite users.)
In other words, unless you are a power-user of another office suite with
special needs, converting to OpenOffice.org should be no problem.
Chapter 2 explains more about switching to OpenOffice.org.
To write this book with OpenOffice.org, we needed perfect compatibility
with Microsoft Word, because the publisher automatically converts Word
text and formatting into QuarkXPress to print the book that you are
reading. We imported Wiley’s custom Word template into OpenOffice.org
and wrote the entire book in OpenOffice.org. We checked the document
in Microsoft Word. Occasionally, we had to change the document format-
ting to match what the publisher wanted in Word. However, the actual
text transferred perfectly from OpenOffice.org to Word.
Getting Started with OpenOffice.org
Most people who use OpenOffice.org download the program from the Web
site of the same name. Other people get it from their friends. But you don’t
have to do either. The CD-ROM with the complete program for Windows, Mac,
and Linux accompanies this book. Check out Appendix A for Installation
Instructions.
If you need to go to Appendix A, go ahead. We’ll wait for you. Then come back
here to continue reading about opening and working in OpenOffice.org.
Once you have OpenOffice.org installed on your system, you are ready to
open it and get to work!
To open OpenOffice.org, follow these steps:
 Windows: Choose Start➪Programs (or All Programs)➪OpenOffice 1.1,
and then choose the application that you want from the submenu. For
example, to open the word processor, choose Text Document.
 Linux: The procedure depends on the Linux distribution that you have.
15
Chapter 1: Getting to Know OpenOffice.org

Linux has several different desktop environments. If you are using KDE,
then choose K➪OpenOffice.org 1.1.0 and then choose the application
that you want from the submenu. If you are using Gnome, then choose
Applications➪Office and then choose the application that you want from
the submenu. Most Linux desktop environments have a relatively
straightforward way of finding OpenOffice.org.
 Macintosh: Navigate to the folder that contains OpenOffice.org (which
should be called OpenOffice.org1.0.1), and double-click the Start
OpenOffice.org icon to open a blank Writer document. To open another
application, choose File➪New and choose the type of document that
you want to open.
Of course, you can place an alias on your desktop and double-click that
or drag the alias to your dock.
The first time you open OpenOffice.org, you see the OpenOffice.org
Registration dialog box. To register, choose Register Now and click OK.
The OpenOffice.org Web site opens, so that you can register.
Facing the Interface
Each application in OpenOffice.org has a somewhat different look, of course,
but many features of the interface are common throughout the suite of
applications.
In the following sections, we use Writer, the word processor, as an example.
However, the principles apply to all the applications. For more details, refer
to the parts of this book that explain the applications that you want to use.
Tooling through the toolbars
A toolbar is a bar of small buttons with pictures on them that you click to exe-
cute commands or otherwise complete the task that you are working on. All
applications have three commonly used toolbars: the Function toolbar, Main
toolbar, and Object toolbar, as shown in Figure 1-2. The toolbar buttons are
shown on the Cheat Sheet at the front of this book.
The following sections describe OpenOffice.org’s three main toolbars.
Function toolbar
The Function toolbar is the most similar toolbar across all the applications.
This toolbar contains basic commands that apply to most types of tasks. You
can find the toolbar at the top of the OpenOffice.org application window. 
16
Part I: Introducing OpenOffice.org 

When you open a window, such as Navigator, Stylist, Gallery, or Preview (in
Impress), you can let it float on the desktop or you can dock it. The following
points explain docking and undocking:
 To dock a window, press Ctrl and drag the window by its title bar to the
right side of the application window.
When docked, you can use the arrow icon in the window to collapse the
window to a tiny bar that takes up little screen space. Click the arrow
again when you need to see the window.
 To undock a window, use the same procedure (press Ctrl and drag the
window by its top toolbar).
 You can also click the Pin icon in the window to change the window from
floating to stick (docked).
Main toolbar
The Main toolbar resides along the left side of your screen and contains
many often-used commands.
You can turn any fly-out toolbar into a floating toolbar. Click the Insert button
on the Main toolbar and hold down the mouse button for a second. You can
then drag the fly-out toolbar from its title bar to any location.
Figure 1-2:
Like other
OpenOffice.
org appli-
cations,
Writer
contains
toolbars.
17
Chapter 1: Getting to Know OpenOffice.org

Object toolbar
The Object toolbar changes depending on the type of objects that you have
in your document or have selected. In general, the Object toolbar has tools
for formatting objects. In Writer, you usually see the Text Object toolbar,
because you most often work with text in Writer. The purpose of the Text
Object toolbar is to help you format text. Other Object toolbars have tools
for formatting other types of objects, depending on the application that you
are using and the object that you have selected.
Other toolbars
OpenOffice.org has the following additional toolbars:
 Hyperlink bar: Use the Hyperlink bar to search the Internet or edit
existing hyperlinks. To display or hide the Hyperlink bar, choose
View➪Toolbars➪Hyperlink Bar.
 Formula toolbar: Use the Formula toolbar to create formulas in your
documents. For example, you can create a table, enter numbers, and
then add the numbers. To display or hide the Formula toolbar, choose
View➪Toolbars➪Formula Bar or press F2.
 Status bar: The status bar at the bottom of the screen displays informa-
tion about your current document. You can change your display zoom,
change from insert to overwrite mode, and so on. If you have made
changes to your document since you last saved, you see an asterisk on
the status bar. You can display or hide the status bar by choosing
View➪Status Bar.
Working with toolbars
You can add buttons to or remove buttons from any toolbar so that you can
more easily find the tools that you need quickly. The easiest way to add or
remove buttons is to right-click the toolbar that you want to modify; then
choose Visible Buttons from the submenu that appears. Figure 1-3 shows the
menus button options for the Text Object toolbar in Writer. You can see, for
example, that you could add buttons for line spacing.
You can add your own buttons and create your own toolbars. For more infor-
mation about customizing toolbars, see Chapter 8.
Using the menus
A few details may help make your menu experience more fruitful. The follow-
ing menu items are standard across all the programs:
18
Part I: Introducing OpenOffice.org 

 File: Provides functions for the file as a whole, including open, save,
print, export, AutoPilot, and templates
 Edit: Provides editing functions, including cut, copy, paste, undo, redo,
AutoText, and Find & Replace
 View: Provides functions for viewing your document, including zoom,
the ruler, toolbars, and nonprinting characters
 Insert: Inserts such items as page breaks, special characters, hyperlinks,
headers, footers, tables of contents, indexes, tables, and graphics
 Format: Formats characters, paragraphs, and pages; adds numbering or
bullets; changes case (as in uppercase or lowercase); and specifies
styles (collections of formatting instructions)
 Tools: Provides Spellcheck, the thesaurus, hyphenation, AutoCorrect,
the Gallery, data sources, mail merge, macros, and customization
 Window: Switches among open documents so that you can see what is
in documents, copy data from one document to another, and so on
 Help: Get help!
Figure 1-3:

submenu.
19
Chapter 1: Getting to Know OpenOffice.org

Each major application has an additional menu, described as follows:
 Calc has a Data menu for sorting, filtering, and analyzing the data in your
spreadsheet.
 Impress has a Slide Show menu for specifying how your presentation
runs when you deliver it full-screen.
 Draw has a Modify menu for rotating, flipping, aligning, and otherwise
changing your drawing objects.
When you open a menu, you can tell whether a menu item has a submenu,
opens a dialog box, or simply executes a command, as shown in Figure 1-4.
Cutting it short with keyboard shortcuts
OpenOffice.org has a huge selection of keyboard shortcuts; you can also
create your own shortcuts. Keyboard shortcuts are especially useful in
Writer, where your hands are on the keyboard most of the time.
When you open a menu, you can see the keyboard shortcuts listed along the
right side of the menu. For example, in Figure 1-4, you can see that pressing
Ctrl+F10 toggles nonprinting characters on and off.

Part I: Introducing OpenOffice.org 

Closing OpenOffice.org
When you have finished creating a document, spreadsheet, or presentation,
you can close OpenOffice.org. It will be waiting for you when you return.
To close OpenOffice.org, do one of the following:
 Choose File➪Exit.

 Using Help
I
f you are using another office suite — a set of programs that includes a
word processor, spreadsheet, and probably a presentation program —
how easy is it to switch to OpenOffice.org? Do you have to learn a whole new
way of working? Does OpenOffice.org have as many features as Microsoft
Office, WordPerfect Office, or StarOffice? Finally, if you have questions about
how to accomplish a certain task, how do you get answers?
What OpenOffice.org Can Do for You
What does any office suite do for you? You need to write letters, reports, and
memos. You have to crunch numbers for your budget or sales projections.
You put it all into a presentation to show employees, prospective customers
and investors, or colleagues. OpenOffice.org can do all this and more.
Using OpenOffice.org at home
Unfortunately, you often need to take work home from the office. Or, fortu-
nately, you work at home all the time, but you need to e-mail documents,
spreadsheets, and so on to others. Perhaps you just want an office suite for
personal use at home. OpenOffice.org is a great option for home use because
it’s free and compatible with other office suites.
You can type letters to your friends and print and mail these letters. You
can also send your letters by e-mail to your friends. If your friends want a
document in Microsoft Word format, for example, you can save it that way,
and they can open it in Word. That’s pretty flexible, isn’t it?

If you take work home, you may have access to your company’s intranet or
database at home, e-mail documents to yourself as attachments, download
documents from a company FTP site, or bring home floppy disks or burned
CDs with the material that you need. In any event, you can access databases
or open documents in a number of other formats, write and edit documents
using OpenOffice.org, and then save the documents in the original format.
No one will ever know that you didn’t use Word, for example!
If the file you are importing has some advanced features listed below in this
chapter, your document may open but look different than what you expect.
Sometimes styles may change, or slight variations can occur which are easily
fixed, or in the worst case, some information is lost or your files won’t open
at all — but that is very unlikely. (OpenOffice.org Calc, for example, has been
reported to open Excel documents that even Excel couldn’t read!)
In January 2003, ACM Queue (www.acmqueue.com) tested Microsoft Word,
Excel, and PowerPoint files by opening them in other office suites. Out of
100 doc files collected at random from the Internet, OpenOffice.org Writer
opened 90 perfectly. Three had minor differences, four had less minor but
fixable differences, and three did not open at all — all were from older ver-
sions of Word. (Calc and Impress scored similarly.) This test, however, was
done using an earlier version of OpenOffice.org (version 1.0.1) and significant
improvements have been made to the new version to improve its compatibility.
As a matter of fact, if you really want all your documents to be in Microsoft
Word, Excel, and PowerPoint format, for example, you can set the default
format of OpenOffice.org files to be the same as those that are used in
Microsoft Office. That way, you never have to even think about multiple file
formats.
Again, if you always work at home (lucky you!), you can open documents that
people send you from other office suites and save documents in other formats
that others can open.
In Chapter 3, we provide details about opening documents that were created
in other formats, saving documents in other formats, and changing the
default file format for OpenOffice.org.
Using OpenOffice.org at work
So you want to take the plunge and use OpenOffice.org at work. This may
happen in one of the following situations:
24
Part I: Introducing OpenOffice.org 

 Your company lets you use whatever program you want (this is
unlikely).
 You are the person that makes the software decisions for the entire
company.
 Your board of directors has chosen to make OpenOffice.org the official
office suite for your company. 
 You are the company.
 You’re the boss, and everyone has to do what you say.
Whatever the situation, you need everything to work properly and be com-
patible so that you don’t drive your customers, suppliers, and employees
crazy. You also don’t want to spend two hours writing a letter when you
could accomplish the task in one hour. You need advanced features such as
mail merge, graphics, tables, hyperlinks, and revision tracking.
As we explained in the previous section about using OpenOffice.org at home,
compatibility is a hallmark of this wonderful program, even though the com-
patibility isn’t perfect. The techniques that we described in that section,
especially saving in another format, usually take care of any problems.
Advanced features abound in OpenOffice.org. Word processing has been
around for a long time, and by now, programmers have a good idea of the fea-
tures that people need. All the basics and most of the advanced features are
built right into OpenOffice.org. Sometimes you need to work a little differ-
ently, but that’s what this book is for, after all — to explain how to use
OpenOffice.org. OpenOffice.org was created as a Microsoft Office clone, so
anyone migrating from Office will feel pretty comfortable right from the start.
As with any new software, if you are introducing OpenOffice.org to your
employees, some training is helpful and will be appreciated. You’ll find many
small differences — sometimes they’re improvements! — so people may need
some time to get up to speed. 
Give employees this book to use as a reference.
Comparing OpenOffice.org to
other office suites
Because interacting with other office suites is a fact of life and most people
have used another office suite before coming to OpenOffice.org, we often
need to compare OpenOffice.org to those office suites.
25
Chapter 2: Switching to OpenOffice.org

Such a comparison is useful for the following cases:
 Deciding whether you should make the switch
 Justifying a company switch, including preparing a cost/benefit analysis
 Understanding questions that you may have, such as why the mail
merge isn’t working the way you expected it to
OpenOffice.org and Microsoft Office
Everyone knows that Microsoft Office is the heavy hitter among the office
suites. Office boasts the vast majority of users and is the standard against
which users usually compare another office suite. In the following tables, we
compare OpenOffice.org with Microsoft Office XP.
The system requirements of OpenOffice.org compared to those of Microsoft
Office XP are shown in Table 2-1. As you can see, OpenOffice.org gives you
more operating system choices and requires less memory.
Table 2-1

Even more important are the basic products that are included with
OpenOffice.org. Table 2-2 compares OpenOffice.org with Microsoft Office XP
Professional, which includes the presentation program PowerPoint.

everything else that Office does. In fact, not all versions of Office include
FrontPage, but OpenOffice.org has its own HTML editor. Also, OpenOffice.org
has its own drawing program, unlike Microsoft Office.
We can’t compare every possible feature or we wouldn’t have any room left
to tell you how to use the features — and which is more important? But Table

Chapter 2: Switching to OpenOffice.org

Although comparable programs in Microsoft Office and OpenOffice.org may
be similar, many details are different. For example, Microsoft Office has
AutoShapes, which are graphic objects that you can insert into your docu-
ments. OpenOffice.org has its own graphic shapes but doesn’t specifically
support Office’s AutoShapes. Therefore, if you open an Office file that con-
tains AutoShapes in OpenOffice.org, you may have trouble displaying these
AutoShapes. In our AutoShapes test, we had good success opening and dis-
playing Microsoft PowerPoint presentations in OpenOffice.org Impress, so
you may not have any problems!
In most cases, you will have problems with compatibility between Office 
and OpenOffice.org only if the formatting is quite complex. Although
OpenOffice.org says that the following items may not appear or function 
correctly, we had excellent experience with most of these items:
 AutoShapes
 Revision marks
 OLE (embedded) objects
 Form fields
 Indexes
 Tables, frames, and columns
 Hyperlinks
 Bookmarks
 WordArt graphics
 Animated text
 PivotTables (Excel)
 New chart types
 Conditional formatting (Excel)
 Some functions and formulas (Excel)
 Background graphics (PowerPoint)
 Tab, line, and paragraph spacing
 Grouped objects
 Some multimedia effects (PowerPoint)
Microsoft Office and OpenOffice.org cannot run the same macros.
28
Part I: Introducing OpenOffice.org 

If you are ready to ditch Microsoft Office, use the OpenOffice.org Document
Converter AutoPilot to convert all your Office files to OpenOffice.org files.
Choose File➪AutoPilot➪Document Converter to open the Document
Converter dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-1.
Select the Microsoft Office option button and then choose which types of
documents you want to convert. Then click Next. On the next screen, you can
specify the folders that you want to include (you don’t have to convert all
your files) and where you want to save them. You can convert templates and
regular application files.
You can specify the folder to be read and the folder where the converted files
are to be saved. You can limit the conversion to specific file types, such as
only Word files or only templates. You need to indicate the type of file and
location for each of the Microsoft Office applications that you choose. The
Document Converter confirms your choices. Click the Convert button to con-
vert the files.

org files.
29
Chapter 2: Switching to OpenOffice.org

You may think that the Document Converter actually converts your Office
files to OpenOffice.org files, but that’s not true. Your original files remain as
they are, and the Document Converter creates new files in the OpenOffice.org
format. You don’t have to worry about losing your original files!
Of course, you can open Microsoft Office documents in OpenOffice.org.
However, converting documents first ensures a more perfect fit within
OpenOffice.org.
OpenOffice.org and WordPerfect Office
How does OpenOffice.org compare to Corel WordPerfect Office? For the most
part, because WordPerfect Office has so many features that are similar to
Microsoft Office, you can use the tables that we provided in the previous sec-
tion. However, one important difference exists. As of now, you cannot open
WordPerfect files.
For word processing, you may find a workaround that exports WordPerfect
files to XML or OpenOffice.org’s .sxw format. Visit http://libwpd.source
forge.net/, a Web site that contains resources for importing and exporting
WordPerfect documents, and go to the Download page.
OpenOffice.org and StarOffice
StarOffice is an office suite that is distributed by Sun Microsystems.
OpenOffice.org and StarOffice are sisters (brothers?). OpenOffice.org is the
same program as StarOffice, with the following important differences:
 StarOffice costs $79.95, but OpenOffice.org can easily be obtained for
free. (For example, OpenOffice.org is included with this book!)
 OpenOffice.org is open source software. (We explain open source soft-
ware in Chapter 1.) It is free software as defined by the Free Software
Foundation in that users are free to run the program for any purpose,
free to study and modify the program’s source code, and free to redis-
tribute modified or unmodified copies of the program, either gratis or
for a fee, to anyone anywhere. Although StarOffice’s code is mostly the
same as OpenOffice.org’s, the StarOffice code is not publicly available.
 Because OpenOffice.org is free software that can be widely redistributed
for the public good, thousands of volunteers are attracted to developing
it. StarOffice uses the code that’s developed by these volunteers, but
adds certain features using proprietary code that is not available in
OpenOffice.org. Some of these features include a database program,
additional Asian fonts, more templates and clip art, and more file filters.
However, you can get some of these features by using third-party appli-
cations and resources. For more information on such OpenOffice.org
resources, see Chapter 20.
30
Part I: Introducing OpenOffice.org 

If you have an old version of StarOffice, you can convert it to the current ver-
sion of OpenOffice.org. See the instructions in the section “OpenOffice.org
and Microsoft Office,” earlier in this chapter.
Getting Help
If you have questions as you’re using OpenOffice.org, the Help feature is
always there for you. You can usually find what you’re looking for with little
difficulty. To start Help, choose Help➪Contents, as shown in Figure 2-2.
The four tabs in the Help window help you find your answer easily. The
Contents tab organizes help according to topics. The Index tab lists informa-
tion alphabetically. Use the Find tab to search for keywords. When you find a
page that you may want to refer to later, add it to the Bookmarks tab.
Using the Contents page
As you can see from Figure 2-2, you can use the Contents page to get help for
any OpenOffice.org application. After you decide which application you want,
double-click the appropriate book icon on the left side of the page to display
Figure 2-2:
Help is
there to
serve you.
31
Chapter 2: Switching to OpenOffice.org

the list of topics for that application. Many topics have subtopics and sub-
subtopics, so keep on double-clicking until you find what you want.
In Figure 2-3, you see the topic that discusses turning off the AutoCorrect
function. You get to this topic by choosing the following path in the left side
of the Contents page: Text Documents➪Automatic Functions➪Turning Off
AutoFormat and AutoCorrect.
The Help system also contains another complete set of instructions. Choose
the following path: Text Documents➪General Information and User Interface
Usage➪Instructions for Using OpenOffice.org Writer. Here you see a long list
of topics from which you can choose. You can probably find the answer you
need from either set.
At the bottom of many Help pages, you can find additional related topics that
may be just what you are looking for, so always scroll down to the bottom of
each page. You can also click on hyperlinked text for more information or to
go to another Help page.
Finding information from the index
If you find it cumbersome to search through a list that’s organized by topic,
try using the Index tab. The index contains an alphabetical list of Help pages.
Only the index items are actual topics. To get help on a particular topic,
double-click the indented topic.
Searching
If you’re really at a loss, try using the Find tab, where you can search for Help
by entering keywords. Type a word or phrase in the Search Term text box,
and press Enter. Double-click the topic that you want from the resulting list.
You cannot use Boolean search techniques that you use on the Web, such as
AND or a plus sign.
Saving bookmarks
If you find a page that you think you may use again, bookmark it. From that
point on, you can find the page quickly by clicking the Bookmarks tab, as
shown in Figure 2-4.

To bookmark a topic, follow these steps:
1. Display the topic.
2. Click the Add to Bookmarks button at the top of the Help page.
The Add to Bookmarks dialog box opens.
3. To change the name of the bookmark to something that means more
to you, type the new name in the Bookmark text box.
4. Click OK.
When the Help topics can’t answer your question, you can try visiting the
OpenOffice.org Web site or asking a question on one of the discussion
groups. For more information about online help, see Chapter 20.

Part II 
Using Writer —
The Word
Processor

In this part . . .
P
art II is all about processing — not food, but words.
Writer doesn’t mash up your words; instead, it makes
them look great. In any ofﬁce suite, the word processor is
the application that people use most, so you probably don’t
want to skip this part.
This part covers opening a document, entering and editing
text, checking your spelling, printing, formatting, complex
documents, and Web hyperlinks and HTML.

W
riter is a full-featured word processor. It sounds like you’re cooking
something delicious — and in a way, you are. You can add ingredients
(words) and then stir, whip, and flip them. Finally, you put them in the oven
and out comes a fully printed document!
In this chapter, you find out how to create and edit Writer documents. All the
basics are here, and everything else is like icing on the cake. If you’ve used
another word processor, much of the material will be familiar. Skim through
the chapter anyway. Writer has a few quirks and special features.
Opening a Document
You can’t do anything in Writer until you have a document to work with.
Writer files are called documents, because they document everything that
you want to write. You can start with a spanking-new blank document, open a
document that you have already created, or import a document.

38
Part II: Using Writer — The Word Processor 
Starting from scratch
When you open Writer, a new document awaits you automatically. You can
simply start typing away without further ado. To create a new document
while you’re already in Writer, choose File➪New➪Text Document or click
New on the Function toolbar. This looks like a blank sheet of paper with a rec-
tangle that represents your margins.
Writer formats new documents based on the default template. For more infor-
mation on using templates to control the formatting of documents, see
Chapter 4. Chapter 4 explains in detail how to format documents.
A vertical-line cursor is blinking patiently at you. This cursor represents the
location where text appears when you start to type.
Using what you have
To open an existing document, choose File➪Open to display the Open dialog
box, as shown in Figure 3-1. For faster access, click the Open button on the
Function toolbar or press Ctrl+O (Ô+O on the Mac). In the Open dialog box,
locate the file that you want and double-click it. The dialog box closes, and
your document opens at its beginning. If necessary, use the scroll bars to
move to another location. Later in this chapter, we explain how to quickly
navigate through your document with ease and grace.
The discussion on the Open dialog box in this section is based on the
Windows operating system. Other operating systems are either slightly or
radically different! If you know your operating system fairly well, you won’t
have any trouble finding files in this dialog box.
Figure 3-1:
Use the
Open dialog
box to open
existing
documents.

You can use one of the buttons on the left side of the Open dialog box to help
you find your file more easily. The Look in drop-down list displays the current
folder or directory. Click this list to display all the folders (or directories)
from the current folder back to the drive on which they are located. You can
then choose another location to find your file.
The buttons at the top help you navigate as well. These buttons are as follows:
 Back: Click to return to the previous location (folder or directory). This
button is only available after you first use some other method to navi-
gate from one location to another.
 Up One Level: Moves you one folder or directory closer to the root
directory of the drive.
 Create New Folder: Creates a new folder in the folder that’s currently
displayed in the Look in list box.
 View Menu: Choose a view from this drop-down list. You can choose to
view a thumbnail image, tiles (large icons), icons (smaller than tiles), a
simple list of filenames, or a detailed list of files.
Importing documents
You can open documents from any other format that OpenOffice.org accepts.
Follow these steps to import a document:
1. Choose File➪Open (or use one of the shortcuts that was mentioned in
the previous section).
2. In the Open dialog box, choose the format of the document from the
Files of Type drop-down list.
3. Navigate to the file’s location.
4. Double-click the file.
Some of the more common formats that OpenOffice.org can import are as
follows:
 Microsoft Word 97/2000/XP (.doc)
 Microsoft Word 97/2000/XP template (.dot)
 Rich Text Format (.rtf)
 Text/Text Encoded (.txt)
 HTML document (.html, .htm)
 DocBook (simplified) (.xml)
39
Chapter 3: Creating a Document

 Flat XML (.xml)
 Microsoft Word 2003 XML (.xml)
 StarWriter 1.0 (.sdw)
 StarWriter 2.0 (.sdw)
 StartWriter DOS (.txt)
If your format is not on the list, you may create one of these formats in your
application. For example, maybe you can save your document in .txt, .rtf,
or .html format and then import it. (You may lose some of the formatting.
In .txt format, you lose all the formatting.)
When you install OpenOffice.org, you can choose whether you want
OpenOffice.org to open various types of files. If you say yes, you can also
double-click any appropriate file to open it in OpenOffice.org. For example,
you can then double-click a .doc file, and that file opens in OpenOffice.org.
However, if you said no, when you double-click a .doc file, Word opens
(assuming that you still have Word on your computer). So in this case, you
first need to open OpenOffice.org and then open the .doc file as described in
the previous steps.
If you chose not to use OpenOffice.org to open .doc files when you installed
OpenOffice.org, you can change this option by following these steps:
1. Exit OpenOffice.org.
2. Start the OpenOffice.org Setup program, using the same procedure
that you used originally. (The procedure depends on your operating
system.)
The Setup window opens.
3. Select the Modify option button, and click Next.
4. Select the Modify option button again.
5. Choose the file types that you want to open in OpenOffice.org.
6. Click OK.
7. Continue through the Setup program to finalize your changes.
Laying Out the Page
Before typing too much of your word document, you should lay out the page.
Laying out a page means setting its size, margins, and orientation (whether
the page is oriented upright like a portrait or on its side like a landscape).
You can also create headers and footers, and you can number pages. When
40
Part II: Using Writer — The Word Processor 

you set up a page early in the game (isn’t typing just a game?), you get an
accurate idea of how the final document will look when printed.
Some types of layouts, such as tables, columns, and borders, are used only in
more complex documents. We discuss these layout elements in Chapter 5.
Setting paper size, margins, 
and orientation
The paper size specifies the paper’s size and type, of course. The margins
decide how much white space you have around the edges of your text. The
orientation determines whether the narrow or the wide edge of your paper is
on top. To change paper size, margins, and orientation, choose Format➪Page
to open the Page Style dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-2 with the Page tab
displayed.
The dialog box in Figure 3-2 is called Page Style: Default because the current
page uses the default page style. Chapter 4 explains styles in more detail.
Paper size and orientation
Use the Paper Format panel of the Page Style dialog box to specify the page
size and orientation. From the Format drop-down list, choose the paper type,
which generally means the paper size, although you can also choose various
envelope sizes. The default paper type is Letter, which is standard 81⁄2x11-inch
paper. When you choose a paper type, the dimensions automatically adjust.
Next, you define the exact paper size. The default is that same 81⁄2x11-inch
paper, so most of the time, you don’t have to change anything. To change the
Figure 3-2:
The Page
Style dialog
box offers

pages.
41
Chapter 3: Creating a Document

paper size, type new dimensions in the Width and Height list boxes or click
the arrow keys in the list boxes to change the dimensions.
You can create custom paper sizes. In fact, if you change the dimensions to
something unusual, the paper type automatically changes to User. Don’t
forget to put your special paper in the printer. If you choose an envelope
type, put the envelopes in your printer. Your printer usually comes with
instructions to let you know the proper direction for inserting envelopes.
Choose Portrait (the narrow edge is on top) or Landscape (the wide edge is
on top) to set the orientation. The image of the paper changes accordingly so
that you can be sure that you made the right choice. You can also choose the
paper tray that the printer uses, if your printer offers these options.
Margins
In the Margins panel of the Page Style dialog box, you set the left, right, top,
and bottom margins. You can type a number or click the arrow keys in the list
boxes to increase or decrease the current setting.
Specify whether to apply the formatting to odd pages, to even pages, or to
both odd and even pages that use the current page style.
Layout settings
In the Layout Settings panel of the Page Style dialog box, you specify settings
that determine how the page is laid out. These settings apply to all the other
formatting settings and allow you to apply different settings to odd and even
pages. In the Page Layout drop-down list box, you have the following options:
 Right and left: Applies the same formatting to both even and odd pages.
 Mirrored: Mirrors the formatting. For example, if you have a larger left
margin on the first page to leave room for binding, the second page will
have a larger right margin. The margin settings change from left and
right to outer and inner.
 Only right: Applies the formatting only to odd pages.
 Only left: Applies the formatting only to even pages.
The Format drop-down list applies to page numbering, which we explain in
later in this chapter.
Select the Register-true check box if you want to make sure that lines of text
on each page are at the same vertical position on the page. You may use this
feature if you want to create a two-page spread and you need text on both
pages to line up. Then choose a paragraph style to specify the size of the text
that OpenOffice.org uses to calculate the text line heights. Chapter 4 explains
styles in detail.
42
Part II: Using Writer — The Word Processor 

When you’re done specifying the settings for the Page Style dialog box, click
OK to return to your document.
Creating headers and footers
You can create headers and footers for your pages. The most common use for
headers and footers is to insert page numbers, which we explain in more
detail in the next section. However, you can insert any text that you want.
To create a header or footer, follow these steps:
1. Choose Format➪Page to open the Page Style dialog box.
2. Click the Header tab or the Footer tab.
The Footer tab is shown in Figure 3-3. The Header and Footer tabs are
sort of like Tweedledum and Tweedledee — they are identical except
that one creates headers and the other creates footers.
3. Select the Header on check box or the Footer on check box.
To turn off a header or footer, deselect the check boxes.
4. Specify the rest of the settings for the header or footer as follows:
• Same content left/right: Inserts the same header or footer content
on both even and odd pages
• Left margin: Sets the left margin between the page and the header
or footer
• Right margin: Sets the right margin between the page and the
header or footer
Figure 3-3:

Chapter 3: Creating a Document

• Spacing: Sets the space between the top or bottom of the page text
and the header or footer
• Use dynamic spacing: Allows the header or footer to expand
toward the text, overriding the spacing setting
• Height: Sets the height of the header or footer
• AutoFit Height: Adjusts the height of the header or footer accord-
ing to the amount of text that the header or footer contains
5. Click OK to return to your document.
You can now see the header or footer in your document.
6. Click inside the header or footer, and enter the text that you want to
place there.
You can use headers and footers to insert automatically calculated fields,
such as page numbers and today’s date. See the next section for information
on numbering pages. Chapter 5 explains how to insert other fields.
Numbering pages
The most common use for a header or footer is to insert page numbers.
OpenOffice.org uses fields (calculated data) to create page numbers. Follow
these steps to perfect page numbering:
1. To place page numbers at the top of the page, create a header. For
page numbers at the bottom of the page, create a footer.
See the previous section for the appropriate steps.
2. Click inside the header or footer.
3. Choose Insert➪Fields➪Page Number.
OpenOffice.org inserts page numbers in all the headers or footers.
4. To move the page number (left-align, right-align, or center it), select a
page number.
Any page number will do. You don’t have to (and can’t) select them all.
5. Choose the desired alignment on the Object toolbar.
Choose Align Left for a left-aligned page number, Centered for a centered
page number, or Align Right for a right-aligned page number.
You now have page numbers throughout your document. We explain more
about aligning text in Chapter 4.

Part II: Using Writer — The Word Processor 

Entering and Editing Text
Once you have your page all laid out and set up, you are ready to start creat-
ing your document. If you’ve used other word processors before, this is
child’s play and you can just skim the next sections. If you’re starting from
scratch, read the next sections carefully.
Starting to say something
When you start a new document, you can just start typing. All text appears at
the vertical blinking cursor. As you type, you may notice that the text auto-
matically wraps to the next line when you reach the right margin. You don’t
need to press Enter unless you want to create a new paragraph.
Pressing Enter twice is a quick way to create a blank line between para-
graphs. A cleaner way to work is to create a style that automatically creates
this blank line when you press Enter once. See Chapter 4 for more informa-
tion on styles. If you think your text looks boring, Chapter 4 also explains
how to format your text so that it doesn’t all look the same.
If you’re in a hurry and make some mistakes, you may also see OpenOffice.org
automatically correct the mistakes. We explain how this works later in this
chapter. For now, enjoy the fact that OpenOffice.org is taking good care of
you and trying to prevent you from making unnecessary errors.
Being selective
Without a doubt, before too long, you need to change something that you
have typed. Editing is an integral part of the document-creation process.
Before you can edit, you need to tell OpenOffice.org what to change; you do
that by selecting the text. OpenOffice.org highlights selected text, as shown in
Figure 3-4. Once you select text, you can make many changes to it — all you
have to do is choose.
Although you see the vertical cursor where typing appears, notice that
another cursor, the I-beam cursor, shows you your mouse location. Move the
mouse and you see the I-beam cursor move accordingly. The basic technique
for selecting text is to use the mouse: Click where you want to start selecting
and drag across the text. The I-beam cursor shows you where to start and
stop dragging. If you drag to the left or right, you select along the same line of
text. If you drag up or down, you add additional lines of text to the selection.
Stop dragging when all the text that you want to change is highlighted.
45
Chapter 3: Creating a Document

To drag means to hold the mouse button down as you move the mouse.
The mouse shortcuts can make short work of selecting:
 Select a word: Double-click the word
 Select a line of text: Triple-click the line
 Select the entire document: Choose Edit➪Select All (or press Ctrl+A
[Ô+A on the Mac])
If you like using the keyboard, use the following keyboard shortcuts to select
text:
 Select a word: Press Shift+Ctrl+→(Shift+Ô+→on the Mac)
 Select from the cursor to the end of the line: Press Shift+End
 Select from the cursor to the beginning of the line: Press Shift+Home
 Select from the cursor to one line up: Press Shift+↑
 Select from the cursor to one line down: Press Shift+↓
When you have selected the text, you are ready to move it, copy it, and
format it.
Figure 3-4:
Select the
text that you
want to edit,
and then
edit it.
46
Part II: Using Writer — The Word Processor 

Modifying text
To change some text, select it and type the new text. Whatever you type
replaces selected text. To insert text, you can also place the I-beam cursor
where you want to add text and type. By default, the new text that you type
appears at the cursor, and existing text politely moves over to the right. This
behavior is called Insert mode because the new text is inserted in front of the
existing text. If you instead want existing text to be overwritten, change to
Overwrite mode. To change to Overwrite mode, press Insert or click the Insert
button on the status bar. (If you don’t see the status bar, choose View➪
Status Bar to make it appear.) The Insert key is used to toggle between Insert
and Overwrite mode.
You should probably use Insert mode for most of your work. If you accidentally
press Insert, you find that all your existing text is nuked as you try to insert
text.
If you make a mistake, whether while typing or editing, you can undo your last
action. Click the Undo button on the Function toolbar, choose Edit➪Undo, or
press Ctrl+Z (Ô+Z on the Mac). To undo several previous actions, click the
Undo button’s down arrow and choose the actions that you want to undo. To
redo an action you have undone, click the Redo button, choose Edit➪Redo,
or press Ctrl+Y (Ô+Y on the Mac).
Moving and copying text
If you think your logic isn’t quite right, you can move some text to a different
location. If you think you got a sentence just right, why not copy it and use it
again somewhere else in the document? Moving and copying text are
common tasks, so you need to know all about these capabilities.
You can move and copy text in the following two ways:
 Drag and drop: This method uses the mouse to move or copy text. To
move text, select the text and drag it to a new location. To copy text,
press Ctrl as you drag the text (press Ô on the Mac). Use drag and drop
when you can see both the original location and the destination on-
screen at the same time.
From other word processing programs, you may expect an arrow cursor
when you point to selected text. You won’t find this cursor in
OpenOffice.org. However, just click and drag in the same way that you’re
used to, and the text moves.
47
Chapter 3: Creating a Document

 Cut, Copy, and Paste: You use the clipboard to move or copy text. To
move text, first select the text and choose Edit➪Cut. To copy text, first
choose Edit➪Copy. To place the text, click at the desired location and
choose Edit➪Paste. Use this method when the original location and the
destination are not both visible on-screen. You can also use this method
to move or copy text from document to document or even across
applications.
Cut, copy, and paste also have toolbar and keyboard shortcuts, as follows:
 Cut: Click the Cut button on the Function toolbar or press Ctrl+X (Ô+X
on the Mac).
 Copy: Click the Copy button on the Function toolbar or press Ctrl+C
(Ô+C on the Mac).
 Paste: Click the Paste button on the Function toolbar or press Ctrl+V
(Ô+V on the Mac).
Finding and replacing text
Sometimes you need to change a certain word in many places. For example,
you may want to reuse a document that you created for one client for
another client by substituting the new client’s name each time the name
appears. Or, you may want to change a word but can’t easily locate it. The
Find and Replace feature comes to the rescue! You can simply find a word or
use the Replace feature to automate changing the word. To find or replace
text, choose Edit➪Find & Replace to open the Find & Replace dialog box, as
shown in Figure 3-5.
Enter the text that you want to find in the Search for list box. To just find the
next instance of the text, click the Find button. To select all the instances of
the text, click the Find All button. You can then click the scroll bar and scroll
through the entire document — each instance of the text is highlighted.
To replace text, enter the new text that you want in the Replace with list box.
The careful way to work is to move to the next instance using the Find button
and then click the Replace button to replace just that instance. If you’re feel-
ing sure of yourself, you can click the Replace All button to replace all
instances of the text.
Use the Options panel of the dialog box to specify whole words (so that you
don’t get band if you only want and), to match the case (to find only House
but not house), or to search backward. You can also select the Search for
Styles check box to search for text in a specific text style. (Chapter 4 explains
text styles.) Click the Format button to search for text using specified format-
ting. For example, you can search for text in a particular font.
48
Part II: Using Writer — The Word Processor 

The Regular Expressions option enables you to fine-tune your search. For
example, you can use wildcard characters, find only text at the beginning or
end of a paragraph, and so on. Click the Help button in the Find & Replace
dialog box, and look for the List of Regular Expressions link under the
Regular Expressions heading.
When you have finished finding and replacing, click the Close button to
return to your document.
Correcting mistakes automatically
For some sophisticated editing, try the AutoCorrect feature, which lets you cor-
rect commonly misspelled words automatically. You can also use AutoCorrect
to create typing shortcuts. Do you think we typed OpenOffice.org each time it
appears in this book? Certainly not! Instead, we created an AutoCorrect entry
so that when we typed ooo, Writer instantly inserted OpenOffice.org. We saved
countless seconds that way! You need to save seconds, too, so read on.
Figure 3-5:
The Find &
Replace
dialog box
helps you
find what
you have
lost.
49
Chapter 3: Creating a Document

To create an AutoCorrect entry, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪AutoCorrect/AutoFormat.
The AutoCorrect dialog box opens.
2. Click the Replace tab, as shown in Figure 3-6.
You see two columns, Replace and With, including a long list of existing
entries. Before adding an entry, check that it doesn’t already exist.
3. To add an entry, enter the spelling to replace in the Replace text box.
If you clicked an existing entry, you see it in the Replace and With text
boxes. You can simply select this entry and type your new one — this
action doesn’t delete the existing entry. Suppose that you often type
dialog as dilaog (we’re confessing). In this case, you would type dilaog
in the Replace text box.
If you are using AutoCorrect to create a shortcut, make sure that you
won’t use the shortcut in another context, and keep it as short as possi-
ble. As we just mentioned, we type ooo to get OpenOffice.org. It’s easy to
type, and we won’t use it for anything else. Perhaps we could have even
used oo.
4. Enter the correct spelling in the With text box.
5. Click the New button.
To add another entry, repeat Steps 3 through 5.
6. When you’re done, click OK to close the dialog box.
(Is the word dialog in the previous sentence misspelled? No. So
AutoCorrect must have worked!)
Figure 3-6:
The

50
Part II: Using Writer — The Word Processor 

As you type, OpenOffice.org automatically corrects incorrectly spelled items
when you press the spacebar after the word or add a period.
Setting AutoCorrect options
Click the Options tab in the AutoCorrect dialog box to set a whole slew of
options that change your text in one way or another. The first option relates
to the Replace tab. If you deselect the Use Replacement Table check box,
OpenOffice.org ignores the entries that are on the Replace tab.
The next two items on the Options tab correct two initial capital letters and
capitalize the first letter of a sentence. Read the list and decide which options
you want. Some are pretty annoying; you may find others helpful.
Making exceptions to the rule
You can make exceptions to two of the rules on the Exceptions tab in the
AutoCorrect dialog box:
 Abbreviations: The rule on the Options tab that capitalizes the first
letter of a sentence determines when a new sentence starts by the exis-
tence of a period. But what if you are typing an abbreviation (that ends
with a period) in the middle of a sentence? The word after the abbrevia-
tion is automatically capitalized. You take care of this problem by listing
common abbreviations so that OpenOffice.org knows not to start the
next word with a capital letter. OpenOffice.org comes with a long list of
common abbreviations. To add your own, enter the abbreviation and
click the New button.
If you type an abbreviation that’s not on the exceptions list and
OpenOffice.org capitalizes the first letter of the next word, you can just
select the capital letter and retype it as a lowercase letter.
 Words with Two Initial Capitals: The rule on the Options tab that cor-
rects two initial capital letters in a word can be pretty frustrating if you
use certain terms that are supposed to be that way. OpenOffice.org comes
with a few examples, such as PCs and CDs. You can add your own terms
so that OpenOffice.org doesn’t correct what you don’t want it to correct.
Using AutoText
The AutoText feature provides another way to create shortcuts to phrases
that you use often. We prefer AutoCorrect because it is easier to use, but you
can try both and judge for yourself.
One great advantage of AutoText is that you can use it to insert graphics,
tables, and other objects.
51
Chapter 3: Creating a Document

To create AutoText, follow these steps:
1. Type the full version of the text, and select it in your document.
2. Choose Edit➪AutoText.
The AutoText dialog box opens.
3. In the Name text box, enter a name for the shortcut.
This name can be anything that you can recognize if you read through
the list of AutoText entries.
4. In the Shortcut text box, enter your shortcut.
Notice that OpenOffice.org has suggested a shortcut for you. You can
use that one or make up another one. Keep it short!
5. Choose AutoText➪New or AutoText➪New (text only).
Use the Text Only option to ignore any selected graphics.
6. Click the Close button to return to your document.
To use AutoText, type the shortcut and then press F3 to change the shortcut
to the longer version.
Putting words in your mouth 
with Word Completion
Did you notice that OpenOffice.org tries to complete your words as you type?
Does this drive you crazy? One of the first things that we do when we install
OpenOffice.org is to get rid of this feature. Being helpful can go too far.
To get rid of the Word Completion feature, follow these steps:
1. Click the Word Completion tab in the AutoCorrect dialog box.
2. Deselect the Enable Word Completion check box.
3. Click the OK button.
Whew!
If you like Word Completion, you can refine it by limiting the number of words
that it collects (remembers) or by telling OpenOffice.org not to collect words.
You can also set the minimum word length.
52
Part II: Using Writer — The Word Processor 

Making it go away
Wrote too much? Deleting words is easy. Select the text and press Delete or
Backspace. If you cut text to the clipboard, as explained earlier in this chap-
ter, and never paste it, you effectively delete the text.
Navigating Through Your Document
We know that you have a lot to say, so your documents can get quite long.
After a while, the typical scrolling method may get tedious. A few speedy nav-
igation techniques would be helpful! We provide mouse and keyboard tech-
niques and explain the Navigator panel, which is especially helpful for finding
your way through long documents.
Hiking with your mouse
The most common way to navigate is with the mouse using the scroll bars.
You may be surprised to know that the scroll bars have a few tricks and
can be quite efficient. Use the following scroll bar items to increase your
productivity:
 Click the Up arrow: Moves the display up one line.
 Click the Down arrow: Moves the display down one line.
 Click the Double Up arrow: Moves the display up one page, that is, to
the top of the previous page.
 Click the Double Down arrow: Moves the display down one page, that
is, to the top of the next page.
 Click the space between the scroll box and the Up arrow: Moves the
display up one screen (displays the preceding screen of your document).
You can quickly scan an entire document by using this method, and you
won’t miss a thing.
 Click the space between the scroll box and the Down arrow: Moves
the display down one screen (displays the next screen of your document).
 Drag the scroll box up or down: Scrolls you through the document.
53
Chapter 3: Creating a Document

For longer documents, you can create bookmarks. A bookmark is simply a
saved location in a document. You can then go to any bookmark. To create a
bookmark, follow these steps:
1. Place the cursor where you want the bookmark.
2. Choose Insert➪Bookmark.
The Insert Bookmark dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 3-7.
3. Type a name for the bookmark in the top text box.
4. Click OK.
You cannot use the following characters in a bookmark name: / (slash), \
(backslash), @ (at sign), : (colon), * (asterisk), ? (question mark), “ (double
quotation mark), ; (semicolon) , (comma), . (period), and # (pound sign).
To use your bookmark, right-click (Control+click on the Mac) the page listing
at the left end of the status bar. All your bookmarks pop up. Click the one
that you want. You can also use the Navigator and the Navigation floating
toolbar to find bookmarks, as discussed later in this chapter.

54
Part II: Using Writer — The Word Processor 

Sailing with the keyboard
The keyboard offers a number of shortcuts for navigating through a docu-
ment. These shortcuts are very useful and precise, and you don’t need to
leave them for the occasional emergency when your mouse isn’t working.
The shortcuts are as follows:
 Left-/right-arrow key: Moves the cursor one character to the left or
right. Press Ctrl+→or Ctrl+←(Ô+→or Ô+←on the Mac) to move one
word to the left or right.
 Up-/down-arrow key: Moves the cursor one line up or down.
 Home/End: Moves the cursor to the beginning/end of the line. Press
Ctrl+Home/End (Ô+Home/End on the Mac) to move to the beginning/
end of the document.
 Page Up/Page Down: Moves the cursor up or down one screen. The
display changes only if necessary. Press Ctrl+Page Up or Ctrl+Page Down
(Ô+Page Up or Ô+Page Down on the Mac) to move to the header or
footer.
Try out these shortcuts, and you’ll soon be moving around like a pro.
Flying with the Navigator
You can walk, you can run, and you can fly. The Navigator panel and
Navigation floating toolbar help you fly through long documents. You can
quickly go to any of the following items:
 Headings
 Hyperlinks
 Tables
 References
 Graphics
 Indexes
 OLE (embedded) objects
 Notes
 Bookmarks
 Draw objects
 Sections
The Navigator panel, shown in Figure 3-8, is larger and a little easier to use
than the Navigation toolbar. To open the Navigator, choose Edit➪Navigator.
You can also click the Navigator button on the Function toolbar or press F5.
55
Chapter 3: Creating a Document

In Figure 3-8, you see a plus sign to the left of the Headings item; this indicates
that headings are available. Click any plus sign to expand the list, and then
double-click any item to go there. You can also see that the Bookmarks item
is already expanded (it has a minus sign next to it), showing the three book-
marks in the document.
To go to any item, double-click the item.
You can dock the Navigator by pressing Ctrl (Ô on the Mac) and dragging to
the left or right of your screen. You can also press Ctrl (Ô on the Mac) and
double-click any empty gray space on the Navigator to alternately dock and
undock it automatically.
To use the Navigation floating toolbar, click the Navigation button on the ver-
tical scroll bar. The Navigation toolbar opens as shown at the bottom of
Figure 3-9. This toolbar has the same features as the Navigator, but in iconic
form. Hover your mouse over any button, and a tooltip pops up to tell you
what the button does.
To use the Navigation toolbar, follow these steps:
1. Click the item that you want to look for, such as Headings or
Bookmarks.
2. To find the next instance of that item, such as the next heading, click
the Next item button.
This button changes its name according to the item that you have
selected. If you choose Bookmarks, the button’s tooltip says Next
Bookmark.
3. Continue to click the Next item button until you find the item that 
you want.
Figure 3-8:
The
Navigator
flies you
around the
world — or

56
Part II: Using Writer — The Word Processor 

As you can see, you can’t choose a specific item as you can in the Navigator;
you can only blindly go to the next item and hope that it’s the one you want.
(Eventually it will be.)
Viewing Your Words
If you find yourself squinting at the computer monitor, maybe your text is too
small. On the other hand, if your text is too big, you may spend a lot of time
scrolling around to see what’s on the screen.
Zooming in and out
You can change the size of the display of your text. This feature is called
zooming; you can zoom in to make text look bigger or zoom out to make it
look smaller. Zooming doesn’t change the actual size of your text as it will
print. (If you want to do that, see Chapter 4, where we explain how to change
font size.)
Figure 3-9:
The
Navigation
toolbar
is small,
but it takes
you far.
57
Chapter 3: Creating a Document

The easiest way to change the zoom is to use the Zoom button on the status
bar. Right-click (Control+click on the Mac), and choose an option from the
shortcut menu that appears. You can choose from several zoom factors (50%,
75%, 100%, 150%, and 200%), Optimal (which doesn’t look very optimal to
us), Page Width (to display the entire width of the document), or Entire Page
(to show the entire page, did you guess?).
For more control, double-click the Zoom button or choose View➪Zoom to open
the Zoom dialog box. Choose Variable, and enter the zoom that you want.
You can change the default zoom for an OpenOffice.org document. See
Chapter 8 for more information.
Viewing full-screen
If you really want to see the maximum information on your screen, you can
hide all the menus and toolbars. You probably don’t want to do this for all
your work, but it could certainly help when you have a complex structure
that you want to see all at once.
To view your document full-screen (without menus or toolbars), choose
View➪Full Screen. A Full Screen On/Off button appears, which you can click
to go back to your menus and toolbars.
In full-screen mode, you can still access menus using keyboard shortcuts. For
example, you can press Alt (Option on the Mac) plus the underlined letter of
any menu (such as f for the File menu) to display that menu. You can use all
your favorite keyboard shortcuts — such as Ctrl+C (Ô+C on the Mac) to copy
selected text to the clipboard.
Seeing secret characters
Sometimes you can get frustrated trying to get your text just right. Your word
processor seems to know something that you don’t know, and you want in on
the secret. OpenOffice.org can display characters that don’t print, such as
hard returns (to move text to the next line) and spaces between words. You
can use these characters to help you troubleshoot — we don’t want you to
be frustrated for long.
To display these nonprinting characters, click the Nonprinting Characters
On/Off button on the Main toolbar or choose View➪Nonprinting Characters.
The keyboard shortcut is Ctrl+F10 (Ô+F10 on the Mac). Nonprinting characters
clutter up your text mightily, so you’ll probably want to turn them off, using
the same procedure, when you’ve figured out what the problem was.
58
Part II: Using Writer — The Word Processor 

Spelling It Correctly
Misspelled words look unprofessional in your document, so take the time to
check the spelling. These days, you don’t have to find the dictionary to check
your words; your word processor has its own dictionary.
To check any word, select it and choose Tools➪Spellcheck➪Check or press
F7. If the word is not misspelled, OpenOffice.org informs you that the
Spellcheck is complete. Click OK to return to your document.
Using the Spellcheck dialog box
To check the entire document, use the procedure described in the previous
section but don’t select any text. If you are not at the beginning of the docu-
ment, OpenOffice.org asks you whether you want to start at the beginning of
the document. Click Yes to start at the beginning. Either way, the Spellcheck
dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 3-10. (Strangely enough, if you type
Spellcheck in a document, it comes up as a misspelled word — and rightly
so. (So why name a spell-checking dialog this way?)
The Spellcheck dialog box displays the misspelled word (if Spellcheck finds
any) at the top, along with a list of suggested words with similar spellings. To
use one of the suggested words, select it and click the Replace button.
 To always replace the misspelled word this way in this document, click
the Always Replace button.
 To always replace the misspelled word in every document, click the
AutoCorrect button to add an AutoCorrect entry. (AutoCorrect is
explained in the section “Correcting mistakes automatically,” earlier in
this chapter.)
Figure 3-10:
Use the
Spellcheck
dialog box
to clean up

errors.
59
Chapter 3: Creating a Document

 If you think the word is fine as it is (you’re the boss), click the Ignore
button.
 To ignore this word throughout the document, click the Always Ignore
button.
 To add the word to the current dictionary (see the Dictionary drop-
down list), click the Add button. The word will never appear as being
misspelled again.
If you’re not sure which word to choose, try one and click the Thesaurus
button to get a list of synonyms. You can choose a different language from
the Language drop-down list. Click the Options button to specify how spell-
checking works. For more information on setting language and spelling
options, see Chapter 8.
If you’re checking the entire document, when you choose an option for a mis-
spelled word, OpenOffice.org automatically goes to the next word, until the
spell-check is complete. At any time, you can click the Close button to close
the dialog box and return to your document.
Checking spelling as you type
To correct spelling as you type, turn on Auto Spellcheck. Click the
AutoSpellcheck button on the Main toolbar, or choose Tools➪Spellcheck➪
AutoSpellcheck. When AutoSpellCheck is on, OpenOffice.org places wavy red
lines under misspelled words. When you see a wavy red line, right-click
(Control+click on the Mac) and choose one of the suggested words from 
pop-up list that appears. You can also choose one of the following:
 Spellcheck: Opens the Spellcheck dialog box
 Add: Opens a submenu of dictionaries to which you can add the word
 Ignore All: Ignores all instances of the word in the document
 AutoCorrect: Creates an AutoCorrect entry for one of the suggested words
If you don’t mind the wavy red lines, AutoSpellCheck is a nice feature and
enables you to quickly correct words as you work.
Saving Your Opus
You’ve created your document, edited it, and now you should save it. In fact,
you should save it often. Don’t wait until you’re finished working on it. You
60
Part II: Using Writer — The Word Processor 

can save in OpenOffice.org format or in another format. You can also export
your document to PDF and other graphic formats. In this section, we explain
all you need to know about saving and exporting.
Saving for OpenOffice.org
To save a document, choose File➪Save, click the Save button on the Function
toolbar, or press Ctrl+S (Ô+S on the Mac). The first time you save, the Save
As dialog box opens, because the document does not yet have a name or
location. From the Save in drop-down list, navigate to the desired location.
You can use the buttons on the left side to go to specific locations, such as
the My Documents folder or a network location.
The Save As dialog box is similar to the Open dialog box, which was discussed
at the beginning on this chapter. (See Figure 3-1.) It has the same buttons at
the top that can help you navigate and change the views in the dialog box.
In the File Name list box, type a name for the document. Click the Save
button. The OpenOffice.org format adds an .sxw extension to the filename.
Once you have saved the document one time, subsequent saves happen
invisibly. You can know if you have unsaved changes by looking at the
Document Modified section of the status bar. When you make a change, a tiny
asterisk (*) appears to let you know that you haven’t saved. As soon as you
save, the asterisk disappears. Add so much as a space, and the asterisk re-
appears to nag you until you save again.
If you tend to forget about saving, set the AutoSave feature to save every 5
minutes or so. For more information, see Chapter 8.
If you save in OpenOffice.org’s native .sxw format, you can protect the docu-
ment with a password. Select the Save with Password check box. In the Enter
Password dialog box, enter the password twice and click OK. If you give the
document to someone, be sure to include the password. And don’t forget the
password!
Saving in other formats
Let’s face it. The whole world doesn’t use OpenOffice.org — at least not yet.
So you sometimes have to give your documents to people who don’t have
OpenOffice.org. You can easily share your documents with others by saving
the documents in another format.
61
Chapter 3: Creating a Document

To save your document in another format, choose File➪Save As. In the Save
As Type drop-down list, choose a file type. If you have already saved your
document in OpenOffice.org format, you now have two copies of your docu-
ment. Of course, if you make further changes, the two documents become 
different.
If you are saving in another format only for the purpose of sending it to
another person, complete the document first and then save it in the new
format. Otherwise, you may have two different versions of the document and
get confused about which is the final version.
You can also choose to always save your documents in another format. For
example, you can set the default file type to be Microsoft Word’s .doc format.
You can save in the following formats:
 Microsoft Word 97/2000/XP (.doc).
 OpenOffice.org 1.0 Text Document (.sxw), OpenOffice.org’s native
format.
 OpenOffice.org 1.0 Text Document Template (.stw), OpenOffice.org’s
template format. For more information on using templates, see Chapter 4.
 Microsoft Word 95 (.doc).
 Microsoft Word 6.0 (.doc).
 Rich Text Format (.rtf).
 StarWriter 5.0 (.sdw).
 StarWriter 5.0 Template (.vor).
 StarWriter 4.0 (.sdw).
 StarWriter 4.0 Template (.vor).
 StarWriter 3.0 (.sdw).
 StarWriter 3.0 Template (.vor).
 Text (.txt).
 Text Encoded (.txt).
 HTML document (OpenOffice.org Writer) (.html, .htm).
 DocBook (simplified) (.xml).
 Flat XML (.xml).
As you can see, you have lots of options. So save away!

Exporting to other formats
When you export an OpenOffice.org document, you save it in a format that
isn’t really a text format anymore. For example, you can save to Adobe
Acrobat PDF format, which is a graphic file format. To export a file, follow
these steps:
1. Choose File➪Export to open the Export dialog box.
This dialog box looks just like the Save As dialog box.
2. In the Save as Type drop-down list, choose one of the following
options:
• PDF - Portable Document Format (.pdf): A graphic format that
can be viewed with the free Adobe Reader
• XHTML (.xhtml): An XML markup language that’s designed for dis-
play on the Web, or HTML that is written in XML
For quicker access, click the Export Directly as PDF button on the
Function toolbar or choose File➪Export to PDF.
3.In the File Name text box, enter a filename.
4.Click the Save button.
If you choose the PDF option, the PDF Options dialog box opens. If you have
selected part of your document, you can choose the Selection option.
Otherwise, select the All option button or the Range option button. You can
enter a range of pages, such as 1-3 or 7;9;11-13. You can also choose a com-
pression option, depending on the intended use of the PDF (printing or view-
ing). Click the Export button to create the file.
Printing
In most cases, the final product of your work is a printed document. Some
variations may exist based on your operating system and printer, but the
basic process is the same.
Previewing your work and saving a tree
Before you commit to paper, preview the document to see what it will look
like. You can avoid wasting paper this way. To preview a document, choose
63
Chapter 3: Creating a Document

File➪Page Preview. The Object toolbar changes to provide you with the tools
that are appropriate to the Page Preview mode, as shown in Figure 3-11.
If you like what you see, click the Print Page View button and print away.
Otherwise, click the Close Preview button and make any changes that you
want before printing. You just saved a tree.
Getting the words on paper
Printing is very simple, and you are no doubt familiar with the process from
other programs. Use one of the following options to print your document:
 Choose File➪Print to open the Print dialog box if you want to make any
adjustments in your printer settings. For example, you can change the
number of copies that you print or choose to print only a portion of the
document. You can also click the Options button to fine-tune which
types of objects you want to print.
 Click the Print button on the Function toolbar to immediately print your
document using the settings in the Print dialog box.

Sending your document as an
e-mail attachment
You can quickly send your document as an e-mail attachment using your
default e-mail program. (This doesn’t work if you have a Web-based e-mail
program, such as Yahoo! or Hotmail. Some OS X and open source e-mail 
doesn’t work with this feature.)
Follow these steps to send your document as an e-mail attachment:
1. Choose File➪Send➪Document as E-mail.
Your default e-mail program opens, with the document already inserted
as an attachment.
2. Enter the recipient, the subject, and a message.
3. Click the Send button to send the e-mail.
You can also send your document as a PDF attachment. For more information
about the PDF format, see the section “Exporting to other formats,” earlier in
this chapter. Choose File➪Send➪Document as PDF Attachment. The PDF
Options dialog box opens, as explained in that earlier section. Then follow
the steps that precede this paragraph.

 Creating lists
 Using styles
T
yping and editing is not enough — you want your document to look good,
too. OpenOffice.org has excellent tools to help you format your docu-
ment so that it looks professional and is easy to read. You can keep it simple
and just choose the right font and paragraph alignment. Or you can stream-
line your work using templates and styles. Either way, OpenOffice.org makes
it easy to get the results that you want.
Molding the New Document
Well done is half begun. If you start your document out right, the entire
process is smoother. You can use AutoPilot, which guides you through the
creation of documents automatically, or you can use a template to structure
the look of the fonts and possibly include some of the text.
Creating new documents with AutoPilot
AutoPilot is a set of screens that guides you through the process of creating
a document. You may have worked with wizards in other word processing
programs — the concept is the same. When you use AutoPilot, you end up
with a document that includes fonts and some of the text. You just fill in the

details. Okay, you fill in most of the document. AutoPilot can just give you the
basics. The nice thing about AutoPilot is that it creates a template that you
can then use repeatedly. (See the next section of this chapter for the low-
down on templates.) You can create AutoPilot documents for the following
items:
 Letters
 Faxes
 Memos
 Agendas
To create one of the preceding documents, choose File➪AutoPilot and
choose the type of document that you want to create from the submenu that
opens. AutoPilot opens. The choices vary according to your choice, but in all
cases, you complete the information on each screen and then click the Next
button. For example, to create a memo, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪AutoPilot➪Memo.
The first screen appears.
2. Choose the layout that you want: Modern, Classic, or Decorative.
Unfortunately, the preview doesn’t change to show you how your
choices change the layout.
3. Choose whether you want the title of your memo to be text or a
graphic.
If you choose text, enter the title of your memo (such as Memorandum).
If you choose a graphic, click the Select Graphics button and choose a
graphic. Click Next.
OpenOffice.org doesn’t come with any graphics for you to use. You need
to find or create your own. For information on creating your own graph-
ics, see Part V of this book.
Save graphics that you may want to use for this purpose in the folder
where you keep your templates. To find your templates, choose Tools➪
Options. Click the OpenOffice.org option to expand it (if necessary) and
then click Paths. Look for the Templates item in the list. Click OK to
close the Options dialog box.
4. Choose the elements that you want your memo to contain, and then
click Next.
Include such items as the date (choose the desired date format from the
drop-down list) and the To and From lines. Click Next.
5. Choose items that you want to see in the headers of continuation
pages (if any) and in the footers. Click Next.
68
Part II: Using Writer — The Word Processor 

6. You can specify Doc information, whether to automatically assign a
filename, and how to name the template.
Doc information refers to properties that appear when you choose
File➪Properties. Choose the source of the title and subject from the
drop-down lists. Click Next.
7. Click the Create button to create the document.
The new document opens, as shown in Figure 4-1.
Once you create your document using AutoPilot, you can reuse the template
that it creates to create more documents. See the next section of this chapter
for instructions on creating a document from a template.
Starting out with a template
A template contains formatting and perhaps text. You use a template as a
basis for a new document. The template and the document are separate files;
the template just functions to structure the formatting of the document.
When you create a new document based on a template, the template is never
changed, although you make changes in the document. By default, docu-
ments open with the Default template.

Chapter 4: Formatting to Perfection

A template is a great way to ensure consistency in your documents. If you
create memos or letters on letterhead, you can start with the same template,
and the repeated content (such as a logo) and the font formatting are always
the same. Templates also save a lot of time. You don’t have to change the for-
matting each time you create a document. Instead, you format once, save a
template, and then create documents from the template, knowing that your
formatting is already there for you.
Unfortunately, OpenOffice.org doesn’t come with much of a supply of 
templates for Writer. You can find a few templates at http://ooextras.
sourceforge.net/. Click the link for your language. Later in this chapter, we
explain how to create your own templates.
To create a new document based on a template, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪New➪Templates and Documents.
2. The Templates and Documents dialog box opens, with the Templates
option selected.
You may see a list of folders or a list of templates, depending on what
you displayed the last time you used this dialog box.
3. If you see a list of folders, double-click the Default folder to display
the templates in that folder, as shown in Figure 4-2.
Figure 4-2:

70
Part II: Using Writer — The Word Processor 

If you have saved templates in another location, navigate to that loca-
tion. To find the default location for templates, choose Tools➪Options.
Expand the OpenOffice.org option and click Paths. Look for the
Templates item in the list.
4. Choose the template that you want to use.
5. To see a preview of the template, click the Preview button.
6. Click the Open button.
A new document opens. You can now use the document. Don’t forget to
save it!
Refining a template
You can modify any template by editing it as you would edit any document.
OpenOffice.org templates have a filename extension of .stw. You open STW
files in the same way that you open Writer documents. (See Chapter 3 if you
need instructions.)
If the template contains text, you can format the text any way you want. See
the next major section of this chapter for information on formatting text. You
can place the following items in templates:
 Styles: Styles are sets of formatting for text, paragraphs, and pages. See
the section “Styling with the Stylist” later in this chapter. Styles are the
most common formatting that is used in templates.
 Graphics: You can add a logo or any other graphic. See Chapter 5 for the
lowdown on inserting graphics in documents. The same steps apply to
templates.
 Tables: You can set up a table but leave the content blank so that you
can easily complete the table.
 Columns: Perhaps you create a newsletter each month. You can set up
the banner heading and the columns. Then all you have to do is add the
text for the columns.
Creating your own templates
To create the template when you have finished refining it, you save the tem-
plate. Follow these steps to save a template
1. Choose File➪Templates➪Save.
The Templates dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 4-3.
71
Chapter 4: Formatting to Perfection

2. In the New Template text box, type a name for the template.
3. In the Categories box, choose Default.
4. Click OK.
What do you do if you don’t want to start with an existing template? You start
from a document. If you have created the perfect newsletter, you can save it
as a template. Delete the text or leave it in — it’s up to you. Saving it as a tem-
plate ensures that you’ll always have the right starting point for your new
newsletter.
When the document has the text and formatting that you want, follow the
previous steps to save it as a template.
To use a template that you created as the default, you can change the default
by following these steps:
1. Choose File➪Templates➪Organize.
The Template Management dialog box opens.
2. In the Category list, double-click the Default folder.
The list of templates appears.
Figure 4-3:
Use the
Templates
dialog box

72
Part II: Using Writer — The Word Processor 

3. Right-click (Option+click on the Mac) the template that you want to
use, and choose Set as Default Template from the shortcut menu that
appears.
4. Click the Close button.
Importing templates
You can use templates from Microsoft Word and use them as the basis for
documents in OpenOffice.org. Follow these steps to import a template from
Microsoft Word:
1. Choose File➪Templates➪Organize.
The Template Management dialog box opens.
2. Click the Imported Templates folder.
3. Choose Commands➪Import Template.
The Open dialog box opens.
4. In the Files of Type drop-down list, choose All Files.
5. Navigate to the template, select it, and click the Open button.
You are returned to the Template Management dialog box.
6. Click the Close button.
Fiddling with Fonts
Most of your document is probably text, so you want the text to look good.
Fonts define the shapes of the letters. You can choose from all the fonts that
you have on your computer, make them any size, make them boldface or
italic, underline them, and generally have a good time with them.
Choosing a font
You can choose a font before or after you type. To choose a font before you
type, follow these steps:
1. Choose Format➪Character.
The Character dialog box opens.
73
Chapter 4: Formatting to Perfection

2. Click the Font tab, as shown in Figure 4-4.
3. From the Font list, choose a font.
You can immediately see what the font looks like in the Preview box at
the bottom of the dialog box.
4. From the Typeface list, choose Regular, Italic, Bold, or Bold Italic.
You can also make text bold, italic, or underlined by clicking the appro-
priate button on the Object toolbar.
5. From the Size list, choose a font size.
Font sizes are measured in points. A point is 1⁄72 of an inch. The most
common point sizes for paragraph text are 12 and 10. Headings are usu-
ally larger.
6. Click OK.
7. Start typing.
To apply a font to existing text, first select the text. Then follow Steps 1
through 6.
Figure 4-4:

Part II: Using Writer — The Word Processor 

Adding character to your characters
If you think that the plain old fonts are boring, you can add some font effects
to your text. Don’t overdo it, though — make sure that people can still read
what you write! To add font effects, use the various tabs of the Character
dialog box, as follows:
 Font Effects: You can add several kinds of underlining, use strikethrough
text, change text color, make small capitals, add an embossing or engrav-
ing effect, add a shadow, add outlining, and add blinking (please don’t!).
You can also change the font color by clicking the Font Color button on
the Object toolbar.
 Position: You can create superscript or subscript text, rotate text, scale
the width of text, and expand or condense text.
 Hyperlink: You can attach a hyperlink to text. For details, see Chapter 6.
 Background: You can add a colored background to selected text.
When you’re done making your text look fancy, click OK.
You can also highlight text to make it stand out. Highlighting is usually a 
temporary effect that is used to remind you (or someone else) that some
text needs further attention. To highlight text, select the text and click
the Highlighting button on the Object toolbar. Click the down arrow next
to the Highlighting button to display a color palette, where you can choose
your favorite highlighting color. To get rid of the highlighting, select the text
again and choose No Fill from the Highlighting color palette.
Planning Your Paragraphs
Part of document layout involves aligning paragraphs and setting line spac-
ing. These tasks are easy in OpenOffice.org.
Aligning paragraphs
Do you want your paragraphs to be lined up on the left or right side of the
page or centered on the page? Or are you a control freak who likes both sides
to be perfectly aligned? You can choose any of these options.
You can set paragraph alignment before or after you type. To set the align-
ment after you type, select the text first. The easiest way to set paragraph
alignment is to use the following buttons on the Object toolbar:
75
Chapter 4: Formatting to Perfection

 Align Left: Aligns the text along the left margin of the page.
 Centered: Centers a line of a text on the page. This option is not nor-
mally used for long paragraphs. Paragraphs look weird when the
Centered option is chosen.
 Align Right: Aligns the text along the right margin of the page.
 Justified: Makes each line of text reach the left and the right margin of
the page.
You can also use the ruler to set margins, tabs, and indentation. If the ruler is
not visible, choose View➪Ruler to make it appear. You can use the ruler,
shown in Figure 4-5, to perform the following tasks:
 Change margins: Drag the border of the gray areas at the left and right.
 Insert or delete tabs: To insert a tab, click in the paragraph that you
want to change and click the ruler where you want to add the tab. To
delete a tab, click in the paragraph and drag the tab off the ruler.
You can set the type of tab by clicking the Tab button at the left end of
the horizontal ruler. You can set left, right, centered, and decimal tabs.
 Set indentation: Click in the paragraph that you want to change. Drag
the left indent marker to change the left indentation. Drag the right
indent marker to change the right indentation. Drag the first-line indent
marker to change the indentation of the first line of the paragraph.
Figure 4-5:
Use the
ruler to

margins,
tabs, and

76
Part II: Using Writer — The Word Processor 

To create a hanging indent, where the first-line margin is to the left of the
margin for the rest of the paragraph — such as for numbered items — drag
the first-line indent marker to the left of the left indent marker. To indent the
first line of a paragraph, drag the first-line indent marker to the right of the
left indent marker.
For more control, choose Format➪Paragraph to open the Paragraph dialog
box. Use the tabs to set the indents, spacing, alignment, text flow, numbering,
tabs, drop caps, borders, and background.
Spacing your lines
Remember double-spacing your book reports in school to make them look
longer? You can still do that. In fact, double-spacing is actually preferred for
academic papers. (And you thought you were getting away with something!)
You can set line spacing before or after you type. If you have already typed
your text, select the text first. The easiest way to set line spacing is to use the
buttons on the Object toolbar, but they are not displayed by default. To dis-
play these buttons, right-click (Option+click on the Mac) the Object toolbar
and choose Visible Buttons from the shortcut menu that appears. From the
list, click one or more of the three line-spacing buttons (1, 1.5, and 2).
You can also select text, right-click it (Option+click it on the Mac), and
choose Line Spacing from the shortcut menu that appears. Then choose one
of the line-spacing options from the submenu.
Making Lists
Everyone makes lists these days. You’re probably tired of lists, but you can’t
get away from them, either. For the times when you need to make lists,
OpenOffice.org can help.
Bulleting lists
Use bulleted lists when the items in the list don’t have to be completed in
sequential order. Most bullets look like little dots, but you can create other
types of bullets. (The bullets in this book look like check marks.)
You can set your bullets before you start typing or change regular text to bul-
leted text. OpenOffice.org adds a bullet for each paragraph, which means that
each time you press Enter (Return on the Mac), you get another bullet. To
bullet existing text, select the text first.
77
Chapter 4: Formatting to Perfection

To create bulleted text, click the Bullets On/Off button on the Object toolbar.
Do the same to get rid of bullets for selected text.
To change the way that your bullets look, choose Format➪Number/Bullets.
Choose the type of bullets that you want from the examples, and click OK.
Still bored? OpenOffice.org has the most amazing collection of picture bul-
lets. You can create bullets of balls, stars, or diamonds, or use your own
graphic file. How about bullets made from a photo of yourself? (Not vain
enough?) Okay, just because you can do it doesn’t mean you should do it.
To add pizzazz to your bullets, choose Format➪Number/Bullets and click the
Graphics tab. Choose one of the graphical bullets, and click OK. To go even
further, follow these steps:
1. Choose Format➪Number/Bullets.
2. Click the Options tab.
3. From the Numbering drop-down list, choose Graphics.
4. From the Graphics drop-down list, choose From File.
You can also choose Gallery to see the same bullets that you see on the
Graphics tab. If you choose From File, the Link dialog box opens.
5. Choose a graphic file, and click the Open button.
You are returned to the Number/Bullets dialog box. You probably need
to change the size of the graphic to make it fit next to a line of text.
6. Change the size of the image using the Width and Height text boxes.
To keep the image’s proportions the same, select the Keep Ratio
check box.
7. If you want, set the alignment of the bullet in relation to the line of
text.
8. Click OK.
Numbering lists
Create numbered lists when you want the items in the list to be performed in
order. You can set your numbers before you start typing or change regular
text to numbered text. OpenOffice.org adds a number for each paragraph,
which means that each time you press Enter (Return on the Mac), you get
another number. To number existing text, select the text first.
To create numbered text, click the Numbering On/Off button on the Object
toolbar. Do the same to get rid of numbering for selected text.
78
Part II: Using Writer — The Word Processor 

To specify how your numbers look, choose Format➪Number/Bullets and click
the Numbering Type tab. Choose one of the numbering types, and click OK.
When you number text, you see a gray box around each of the numbers. You
can ignore this box — it doesn’t show up when you print.
Styling with the Stylist
Styles are collections of font or paragraph settings that define how your text
looks. You can ignore styles for short documents, but they are indispensable
for longer documents, especially ones with repeated features such as head-
ings. Styles make sure that all your headings look the same. They also help
you make global changes if you need to do so. Imagine a 30-page school
paper with lots of headings. You hand it in, and your teacher says that the
headings need to look different. Do you really want to individually format
each heading? Probably not!
If you created the headings with a style, you can just redefine the style,
and presto, they all now look just the way your teacher wants them to. You
get an A+.
Understanding styles
In the previous sections, we covered just the basics of formatting, but with
styles, you can include many more features. For example, you can specify
how much space comes after each paragraph. Specify spacing equal to the
size of your font, and you don’t need to press Enter (Return on the Mac)
twice to create a paragraph. Just press Enter (Return) once, and the style cre-
ates the space between the paragraphs. You can also create complex format-
ting for a paragraph, such as borders and background fills. (For more
information on borders and fills, see Chapter 5.)
OpenOffice.org offers the following kinds of styles:
 Paragraph: Formats entire paragraphs. This is the most common style
type. In fact, it may be the only type that you need.
 Character: Formats one or more characters.
Use character styles when you need to vary the formatting of characters
within a paragraph.
 Frame: Formats text frames and frames for graphics. (Chapter 5 explains
these concepts in more detail.)
79
Chapter 4: Formatting to Perfection

 Page: Formats the structure of a document, including such elements as
page numbers and margins.
Page styles are great for long, complex documents with varying types of
page layouts.
 Numbering: Formats numbers and bullets for lists.
Using a style
OpenOffice.org comes with many styles already set up for you, so you can
just start creating a basic document without any preliminary setup.
The most efficient method of selecting a style depends on how much of your
document has been created, as follows:
 The Stylist panel accesses all styles or a selected set of styles.
 The Apply Style drop-down list on the Object toolbar accesses styles
that are already used in the document. It’s not a good place to start, but
it’s convenient once you have already applied a number of styles.
Drop-down list
The Apply Style drop-down list is found on the Object toolbar. This list, as
shown in Figure 4-6, only includes styles that you have already used in your
document.
To apply a style from the Apply Style drop-down list, select the text and
choose the style you want from the list.
Stylist panel
The Stylist panel is devoted to styles. You can open the Stylist panel with any
of the following actions:
 Choose Stylist On/Off on the Function toolbar.
 Press F11.
 Choose Format➪Stylist.
The Stylist panel opens, as shown in Figure 4-7.
You can dock the Stylist panel so that it doesn’t cover your document. Press
Ctrl (Ô on the Mac), and drag the panel to the right side of your screen.

81
Chapter 4: Formatting to Perfection

A drop-down list at the bottom of the Stylist panel specifies which kinds of
styles you see, as follows:
 Automatic: Displays the styles that OpenOffice.org thinks are appropriate
for the current use. (How does OpenOffice.org know?) This is the default.
 All Styles: Gives you access to every available style.
You can limit the Stylist panel to specific sets of styles, such as the following:
 Custom styles that you have created
 List styles for creating numbered or bulleted lists
To apply a style from the Stylist, select some text, and double-click a style in
the Stylist panel.
Creating a style
You don’t have to use the styles that are included in OpenOffice.org. In fact,
most people design their own styles. You can define a style by using one of
the following methods:
 Formatting some text and using that text as an example
 Specifying the style settings
Create a style by example
When you create a style by example, you format some text first. You can use
the ruler, the buttons on the Object toolbar, and the options on the Format
menu to format the example text. When the text is picture-perfect, follow
these steps to create a style:
1. Open the Stylist panel (press F11).
2. Click the type of style that you want to create.
The icons for the style types are along the top of the Stylist panel. For
example, to create a paragraph style, click the Paragraph icon. If the
Paragraph icon is already selected, you don’t need to do anything for
this step.
3. Either click in the text that you formatted (for example, in the para-
graph) or select one character or object that you formatted. (For page
and frame styles, just select one object in the page or frame.)
4. If you clicked in the text, click the New Style from Selection button in
the Stylist panel. If you selected text or an object, drag the text or
object into the Stylist panel.
The Create Style dialog box opens.
82
Part II: Using Writer — The Word Processor 

5. Type a name in the Style Name text box.
6. Click OK.
You can now use your style for other text.
Create a style by specifying settings
If you want to be very precise about your settings, you may want to start by
naming a style and then specifying all its settings. You have more control
over the settings using this method. Follow these steps:
1. Choose Format➪Styles➪Catalog.
The Style Catalog dialog box opens.
2. From the drop-down list at the top of the dialog box, choose the type
of style that you want to create.
3. Click the New button.
The dialog box that opens is named according to the type of style that
you chose from the drop-down list. For example, if you chose Paragraph
styles, the Paragraph Style dialog box opens. The settings that are avail-
able in each dialog box are appropriate for each type of style. The
Organizer tab is displayed, as shown in Figure 4-8.

5. From the Next Style drop-down list, choose which style should come
after the new style.
OpenOffice.org applies the next style when you press Enter (Return on
the Mac) after typing a paragraph using this style. This setting applies to
paragraph and page styles only.
6. From the Linked With drop-down list, choose a style to use as a basis
for your new style.
If you think that your new style resembles an existing style, choose it
here. Then, when you specify your settings, many of them are already
set for you on the various tabs. This means that you have to make fewer
changes, and you can finish more quickly. To start from scratch (the set-
tings for the Default style), choose None.
7. From the Category drop-down list, choose a category.
Choose a category to help you find the style more easily in the Stylist
panel. If you usually work with the Applied Styles list and plan to apply
the style (otherwise why create it?), the category is not very important.
8. Go through each tab, and specify the settings for your style.
For example, if you are creating a paragraph style, you have Indents &
Spacing, Alignment, Text Flow, Font, Font Effects, Position, Numbering,
Tabs, Drop Caps, Background, Borders, and Condition tabs. Whew!
That’s a lot of settings. If you have questions on any tab, click the Help
button to see a description of the functions on that tab.
9. Click OK.
You are returned to the Style Catalog dialog box. Your new style appears
on the list.
10. Click the Close button to return to your document.
Changing and organizing styles
You can modify an existing style and all text using that style is automatically
updated. This feature is one of the great advantages of styles. You can also
copy styles from another template or document.
To modify an existing style, follow these steps:
1. Choose Format➪Styles➪Catalog.
The Styles Catalog dialog box opens.
2. Choose the style that you want to modify.
84
Part II: Using Writer — The Word Processor 

3. Click the Modify button.
The dialog box that opens depends on the type of style that you chose
and the style’s name. Each dialog box has the settings that you need for
that style.
4. Go through the tabs, and change any settings that you want to.
5. Click OK to change the style.
6. Click the Close button to close the Styles Catalog dialog box and
return to your document.
Suppose that you have a very nice style in another document or template
that you want to use in your current document or template. Why re-create
the wheel? Instead you use the Style Manager. Follow these steps:
1. Open the documents that you want use.
For example, if you want to copy a style from one document to another,
both documents should be open.
2. Display the document that is to receive the style.
3. Choose Format➪Styles➪Catalog.
The Styles Catalog dialog box opens.
4. Click the Organizer button.
The Template Management dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 4-9.
5. At the bottom of the dialog box, choose Templates or Documents,
depending on the type of file that you want to use.
For example, to copy a style from one document to another, choose
Documents from both drop-down lists. If you’re copying from a template
to a document, it doesn’t matter which side lists the templates and
Figure 4-9:
Use the
Template

ment dialog
box to 
copy styles

or template
to another.
85
Chapter 4: Formatting to Perfection

which side lists the documents. If you chose Documents on either side,
you see a list of open documents. If you chose Templates on either side,
you see the template folders.
6. If you’re copying from a template, double-click the appropriate tem-
plate folder and choose the template that has the style that you want.
If you’re copying from a document, choose the document that has the
style that you want.
7. Double-click the template or document name to display the word
Styles.
8. Double-click the word Styles to display the list of all the styles.
When the styles are displayed, choose Commands➪Print to print a list
of all the styles and their settings for the selected document or template.
This is a great way to troubleshoot and analyze styles.
9. On the other side of the dialog box, display the template or document
that is to receive the style.
10. Choose the style that you want to copy.
11. Press Ctrl (Ô on the Mac), and drag the style to the other side of the
dialog box. When you see a horizontal line below the file or template,
release the mouse button.
If you just drag, you move the style. This means that the style is
removed from its original source. You rarely want to do this, so be sure
to press Ctrl (or Ô) as you drag!
12. Click the Close button to return to the Style Catalog dialog box.
13. Click OK to return to your document.
Try out your new style. You should find it in the Stylist panel.

Designing Complex Documents

 Creating tables and columns

 Working with long documents
 Creating personalized documents
S
ometimes your work gets complicated. You need to add graphics, create
a newsletter, or insert a table. You may be writing your thesis and need
to add a table of contents and an index. Or perhaps you want to send out let-
ters (or invoices) to your customers. OpenOffice.org is up to all these tasks,
and in this chapter, we explain how to do them.
Dividing Text into Tables and Columns
After a while, plain paragraph text can get boring. And if you’re working with
lots of numbers, you may need to organize them into a neat, orderly table. In
writing a newsletter, you may want to split up the page into columns. Laying
out the page into a table or into columns is a common task for many people.
Tabling the issue
A table is a grid of rows and columns that creates cells where you can place
text or numbers. Tables are an easy way to make complex data clear, and
they are easy to create in OpenOffice.org Writer.
To create a table, follow these steps:
1. Choose Insert➪Table.
The Insert Table dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 5-1.

2. In the Size panel, set the number of columns and rows in the Columns
and Rows text boxes.
3. In the Options panel, set the basic options for the table, as follows:
• Header: Creates a header row at the top of the table. The header
text is centered, italic, and boldface.
• Repeat Header: Repeats the header text on the next page if the
table continues to the next page.
• Don’t Split Table: Prevents the table from being split to more than
one page.
• Border: Creates a border around the table. (If you deselect this
check box, the table is invisible, which makes it difficult to work
with. You can always turn off the border when you’re finished.)
• AutoFormat: Opens the AutoFormat dialog box, where you can
choose one of the preset table formats. Click OK after you choose a
format.
4. Click OK.
To quickly create a table with the default settings, choose Insert➪Insert Table.
You see a small grid. Drag across the grid to specify the number of rows and
columns.
To enter data in the table, click in the upper-left cell and type. Press Tab to go
to the next cell to the right. Continue in this way throughout the entire table.
Formatting the table
To format the table, you can use the Object toolbar, which has an entirely
new set of buttons when the cursor is inside the table, as shown in Figure 5-2.
Figure 5-1:
Use the
Insert Table
dialog box
to set up a
table.
88
Part II: Using Writer — The Word Processor 

Most of these items are self-explanatory, but a couple require some explana-
tion, as follows:
 The table display mode specifies what happens to the entire table when
you adjust the number or size of a row or column, as follows:
• Fixed: The width of the table remains the same. Changes to a cell
affect only the adjacent cell.
• Fixed proportional: The width of the table remains the same, but
changes affect the entire table, so changes affect adjacent cells
proportionally.
• Variable: Changes affect the size of the entire table.
 The Optimization setting has four options that automatically set the
spacing of the rows and columns, as follows:
• Space columns equally: Makes all the columns the same width
• Space rows equally: Makes all the rows the same height
• Optimal row height: Sets the row height so that it’s just high
enough for the contents
• Optimal column width: Sets the column width so that it’s just wide
enough for the contents

toolbar to

89
Chapter 5: Designing Complex Documents 

Another way to format a table is to choose Format➪Table. This opens the
Table Format dialog box. Use the tabs in this dialog box to finesse your table.
When you’re done, click OK. Many of the settings are also on the Object tool-
bar, but some settings have more options in the dialog box.
Writing in columns
Columns are ideal for newsletters and whenever you have a long list of short
items and want to save space. Follow these steps to perfect columns:
1. Choose Format➪Columns to create columns in your document. 
The Columns dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 5-3.
2. Choose the number of columns that you want in the Columns list box
(or use the up and down arrows), or click the type of columns that you
want in the sample boxes.
You see the result in the Preview box.
3. To make additional adjustments, use the Width and Spacing panel to
individually set the width of each column and the spacing between
the columns.
4. To add a separator line between the columns, use the Separator Line
panel to specify a line type, height, and position.
5. If you have created page styles, specify the page style for which you
want the columns in the Apply to list box.
6. Click OK.
Figure 5-3:

Columns
dialog box

Part II: Using Writer — The Word Processor 

Working with sections
What do you do if you want one part of your document to have one column
and another part to have two columns? You use sections. Sections divide your
text. You can use sections to vary the numbers of columns.
Another way to lay out columns for part of a document is to put the text in a
frame. We explain frames in the section “Using Borders and Frames,” later in
this chapter.
To insert a section, follow these steps:
1. Click where you want to insert a section. You can also select existing
text to convert it to a section.
The text must be one or more complete paragraphs.
2. Choose Insert➪Section.
The New Section dialog box opens.
3. In the New Section text box, enter a name for the section.
You can link a section to another file so that the section is automatically
updated when that file changes, you can write-protect the section so
that no one else can change it (with or without a password), and you
can hide the section.
4. Click the Columns tab and set the columns, as described in the previ-
ous section.
5. Click the Insert button.
You now have a new section, shown by two horizontal lines. If you selected
text before inserting the section, the lines are around the text. If you are cre-
ating a spanking-new section, be sure to place the cursor inside the section
before you type.
You can also modify a section. Choose Format➪Sections, and make any
adjustments that you want. Click the Options button to find the settings for
columns. Click OK when you’re done.
Creating Long, Long Documents
Okay, you have a lot to say. Maybe you’re writing a novel or your Ph.D. thesis.
In any case, you need some hard-core tools to help you out. You may need to
91
Chapter 5: Designing Complex Documents 

divide your book into chapters, create a table of contents, or index the book.
In this section, we explain how to format your magnum opus.
When you need to create long documents with many parts, you can create a
master document. A master document is a holder for other documents, such
as the chapters of a book. Working with one very long document can get
unwieldy, so you can create separate documents for each chapter and then
pour all the smaller documents into your master document. Finally, you can
add page numbers as well as create a table of contents and index for the
whole shebang.
The master document contains only its own text and links to the subdocu-
ments. You make changes to your subdocuments directly and then update
the master document so that it is always current. Master documents have
their own filename extension, .sxg.
Heading up your text
Usually, you start by creating all your subdocuments (for example, your
chapters). When the subdocuments are all ready, you create a new master
document. However, you can also turn an existing document into a master
document.
Creating a new master document
If you already have all your subdocuments, choose File➪New➪Master
Document. The Navigator automatically opens. (See Chapter 3 for more
about the Navigator.) However, you have a special toolbar for working with
master documents.
The Navigator starts by showing one item, Text. To add other files, follow
these steps:
1. Choose Insert➪File from the Navigator toolbar.
The Insert dialog box opens.
2. Choose the file that you want to insert.
3. Click the Insert button.
Figure 5-4 shows a master document with some text and two subdocuments.
To reorder the contents of a master document, select a subdocument or any
text in the Navigator and drag it up or down. You can also select any item and
use the Move Up or Move Down button.
92
Part II: Using Writer — The Word Processor 

To insert text into the master document, place the cursor in the section
below where you want the text and choose Insert➪Text from the Navigator
toolbar.
If you move a subdocument, right-click the subdocument in the Navigator
and choose Edit Link from the shortcut menu that appears. You can then
specify a new location for the subdocument.
To delete a subdocument, right-click it in the Navigator and choose Delete
from the shortcut menu that appears.
Turn an existing document into a master document
If you have an existing document, you can convert it to a master document.
OpenOffice.org creates a new subdocument at each Heading 1 style. Use this
method if you thought you were creating a short story but things got out of
hand and you now have a full-fledged novel. You can also insert documents.
This method also works well if you want to use a document that was created
from your own template and turn it into a master document.
Choose File➪Send➪Master Document. Name the document, and click the Save
button. Don’t worry, OpenOffice.org doesn’t delete your original document.

93
Chapter 5: Designing Complex Documents 

Creating a table of contents
The easiest way to create a table of contents is to use the heading styles
that come with OpenOffice.org; these are Heading 1, Heading 2, and so on.
You can redefine these headings to look the way you want (as explained in
Chapter 4) and save the result as a template (also discussed in Chapter 4).
Then use the template to create your document. To create the table of con-
tents, follow these steps:
1. Click where you want to create the table of contents.
Usually you create the table of contents near the beginning of your 
document.
2. Choose Insert➪Indexes and Tables➪Indexes and Tables.
The Insert Index/Table dialog box opens.
3. Click the Index/Table tab, as shown in Figure 5-5.
4. From the Type drop-down list, choose Table of Contents.
5. In the Create Index/Table section, choose whether you want to create
a table of contents for the entire document or for just one chapter.
Also, in the Evaluate Up to Level list box, choose what level of head-
ing you want to include.
If you have four levels of headings, you may only want to include two
levels in your table of contents. In that case, you would evaluate up to
level 2.
6. Click OK.
Figure 5-5:
Define a
table of
contents in
the Insert
Index/Table
dialog box.
94
Part II: Using Writer — The Word Processor 

If you don’t want to use the preset heading names, you can use other styles
for your headings. In the Create From panel of the Insert Index/Table dialog
box, select the Additional Styles check box and then click the adjacent ellip-
sis button. In the Assign Styles dialog box, choose a style and use the double-
left and -right arrow buttons to assign a level to the style. For example, if you
have MainHeading and SubHeading styles, move MainHeading to level 1 and
move SubHeading to level 2. Click OK to finish assigning your styles to levels.
Although you should create your table of contents when your document is
finished, is a document ever finished? If your document changes yet one
more time, you need to update the table of contents. Just right-click in the
table of contents, and choose Update Index/Table from the shortcut menu
that appears.
If you find that you cannot place your cursor in the table of contents, choose
Tools➪Options➪Text Document➪Formatting Aids. Then select the Enable
check box in the Cursor in Protected Areas panel.
To modify the table of contents setting, right-click in the table of contents
and choose Edit Index/Table from the shortcut menu that appears. The Insert
Index/Table dialog box opens, where you can modify your settings.
To delete a table of contents, right-click in the table of contents and choose
Delete Index/Table from the shortcut menu that appears.
Indexing your book
Indexing is a little different from creating a table of contents, because you
cannot use standard headings. Instead, you have to specify each place that
you want to use as an index entry.
Inserting an index entry
To create an index entry, follow these steps:
1. Select the text that you want to put in the index, or click in front of a
word that you want to put in the index.
2. Choose Insert➪Indexes and Tables➪Entry.
The Insert Index Entry dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 5-6.
You can insert an index entry from the Main toolbar. Long-click the
Insert button until the floating toolbar remains open. Place your cursor
or select your text, and click the Insert Index Marker button.
95
Chapter 5: Designing Complex Documents 

3. If you want the word to be a subentry to a main entry, type the main
entry word in the 1st Key list box.
You can even create a sub-subentry. Place the main entry in the 1st Key
list box and the subentry in the 2nd Key list box.
4. Select the Apply to All Similar Texts check box to insert an index
entry to the same text where it occurs elsewhere in your document.
To use this feature, you must have selected the text before you started.
Select the Match Case check box to insert an index entry only if the text
matches the case of the current entry. Select the Whole Words Only
check box to mark only whole words that match the current entry.
5. Click the Insert button to insert the index entry.
The dialog box stays open so that you can enter other index entries if
you want. You can select words while the dialog box is open.
6. Click the Close button to close the Insert Index Entry dialog box.
To edit an index entry, place the cursor in front of the entry and choose
Edit➪Index Entry. The Edit Index Entry dialog box opens, which is just like
the Insert Index dialog box. Make your changes, and click OK.
Creating the index
When all your index entries are ready, it’s time to create the index. Follow
these steps to do so:
1. Click where you want to insert the index; this is usually at the end of
the document.
2. Choose Insert➪Indexes and Tables➪Indexes and Tables.
3. Click the Index/Table tab.
4. From the Type drop-down list, choose Alphabetical Index.
5. In the Create Index/Table section, choose whether you want to create
an index for the entire document or for just one chapter.
Figure 5-6:
Define an
index entry
in the Insert
Index Entry
dialog box.

Part II: Using Writer — The Word Processor 

6. In the Options panel, set the following items:
• Combine identical entries: Combines all instances of an entry and
lists the pages numbers on one line.
• Combine identical entries with p or pp: Combines all instances of
an entry that occur on one page, followed by the page number and
the letter p (for example, Mars 3p). Combines all instances of an
entry that occur on consecutive pages, followed by the first of the
consecutive pages and the letters pp (for example, Mars 3pp, if
Mars occurs on pages 3 and 4).
• Combine with -: Combines all instances of an entry on consecutive
pages with a hyphen, as in Mars 3-4.
• Case sensitive: Distinguishes between uppercase and lowercase
words.
• AutoCapitalize entries: Capitalizes the first letter of each entry.
• Keys as separate entries: Keys are used to create subentries. This
option places the subentries on a separate line, indented below the
main entries.
• Concordance file: Lets you create a separate file that contains
index entries. Then choose File➪New to create the file. (To modify
the file, choose File➪Edit.) The Edit Concordance File dialog box
opens, where you can create the concordance file using a preset
grid.
7. Click OK to create the index.
To update an index, right-click in the index and choose Update Index/
Table from the shortcut menu that appears. You can also delete or edit 
the index from the shortcut menu that appears when you right-click (or
Control+click) the index.
Creating Personalized Form Letters
Sometimes you just want to get personal. If you’re sending out the same
letter to many people, it’s nice to address each letter (and envelope) individ-
ually. The process of combining a letter with a list of names and addresses
(or any other set of data) is called mail merge, and the letter that you create
is called a form letter.
To create personalized letters, follow these steps:
1. Create the form letter.
2. Create or register a data source.
97
Chapter 5: Designing Complex Documents 

A data source is a database that contains the data that you use to person-
alize the letters. The data source often contains names and addresses but
could contain any information that you want. To register a data source
means to let OpenOffice.org know the location and format of the data.
3. Drag fields from the data source into the form letter.
A field is a column name in the database. For example, FirstName and
Address are typical fields.
The term field in OpenOffice.org also means any calculated information
that you insert into a document. For example, you use a field to insert a
page number or today’s date.
4. Output the form letter to your printer or individual documents.
Outputting the form letter also merges the individual rows of data
with the form letter.
Creating the form letter
You create the form letter from any document. At first, don’t worry about
where the personalized information will go. Just type the letter (or invoice or
other document). When you’re done, save the letter.
Creating and registering a data source
This step is a little more complex, because you can use many types of data-
bases. We begin with a simple example. Suppose that you want to maintain a
simple text database of your friends. Follow these steps:
1. Type your headings, tabbing between each heading. Press Enter, and
add your names and addresses. Place tabs between each column. Save
the document in .txt format.
For example, your headings could be FirstName, LastName, Address,
City, State, and ZipCode. To save a document in .txt format, choose
File➪Save As and choose Text (.txt) from the Files of Type drop-down
list. Click the Save button.
2. Choose File➪AutoPilot➪Address Data Source.
The Address Data Source AutoPilot opens.
3. To choose the type of data source, choose one of the options. In our
example, choose Other External Data Source. Click Next.
98
Part II: Using Writer — The Word Processor 

4. On the next screen, click the Settings button to open the Create Data
Source dialog box.
5. In the Name text box, type the name of the data source file.
Use the filename of the database.
6. From the Database Type drop-down list, choose a type. In our exam-
ple, choose Text.
If you have your data in a spreadsheet, such as Calc (see Part III of this
book), choose Spreadsheet as the type of database.
7. To the right of the Data Source URL, click the ellipsis button to browse
for your database file. Find the folder (directory), and click OK.
Your screen should appear similar to what is shown in Figure 5-7.
8. Click the Text tab, and specify the row and file format. In our exam-
ple, the fields are separated by tabs (the other separators don’t
matter) and the file is in .txt format. Click OK.
You are returned to the Address Data Source AutoPilot.
9. Click the Field Assignment button to assign field names to specific
types of preset fields.
10. In the Address Data - Field Assignment dialog box, choose each type
of field that you use and then choose your actual field (column) names
from the field’s drop-down lists, as shown in Figure 5-8.
Scroll down to the bottom of this screen to find four user fields that you
can use as necessary. For example, if you have an Address2 field for
apartment or suite numbers, you can use one of these user fields.
Figure 5-7:
In the

99
Chapter 5: Designing Complex Documents 

11. Click OK.
12. Click the Create button.
13. Click OK, and accept the message that you can now access this
address data.
The steps and screens will differ somewhat for different types of databases.
For example, you can use an address book from Microsoft Outlook and other
types of address book data.
Inserting fields into your form letter
You are now ready to add the fields in your data source to your form letter.
Follow these steps to do so:
1. Display your form letter.
2. Choose View➪Data Sources, or press F4.
The Data Sources window opens at the top of your document. At the left,
you see your registered data sources.
3. Double-click the data source that you want to use to expand it. If nec-
essary, double-click the Tables item until you see a table listed, as
shown in Figure 5-9.
4. Double-click the table to display it.
The data in that table displays in the right side of the Data Sources
window, as shown in Figure 5-9. This window has its own toolbar that
lets you sort and filter the data in your database.
You can double-click any field heading to widen it so that you can see all
the data in that column.
Figure 5-8:
Use the
Address
Data - Field

Part II: Using Writer — The Word Processor 

5. If necessary, scroll through your form letter so that you can see the
area where you want to insert the fields. Then drag the field name
(that is, the column head) of the first field to the desired location in
your form letter.
6. Continue to drag field names into your form letter. Be sure to add
spaces where necessary, such as between a first name and a last
name.
Your letter should look something like what is shown in Figure 5-10.
Creating the output
You’re ready to print your letters! You can also save them to a file. The rows
in your database will be merged with your form letter at the same time.
Follow these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Mail Merge.
The Mail Merge dialog box opens.
Figure 5-9:
The Data

101
Chapter 5: Designing Complex Documents 

2. Choose From This Document, and click OK.
If you created a template from your form letter, choose From a Template.
The Mail Merge dialog box opens. (Okay, you see two Mail Merge dialog
boxes. This is the big one.)
3. To sort or filter the records, use the toolbar in the dialog box.
Otherwise, choose the records that you want to include in the
Records section. (The default is All.)
4. In the Output section, choose either the Printer or File option.
If you choose File, click the adjacent ellipsis button to choose a location
for the files. (OpenOffice.org creates a separate file for each row and
numbers the files sequentially.) Choose to name the file according to one
of the database fields (which you can choose from the drop-down list)
or manually (you get to name the file).
5. Click OK.
If the Save As dialog box opens, choose the location and filename again
and click the Save button. Your letters are either printed or saved.

Using Borders and Frames
You’ve written enough. Now it’s time to liven up your documents a little. One
simple way is to put a border around text and graphics. You can also add col-
ored backgrounds.
Boxing text
Boxing text is a great way to make it stand out. You can also place lines above
and below the text — or on any side, for that matter. To add a box, use the
border feature. Usually, you add a border to an entire paragraph. Follow
these steps:
1. Select the paragraph.
2. Choose Format➪Paragraph and click the Borders tab, as shown in
Figure 5-11.
The Borders tab of the Paragraph dialog box displays.
3. In the Line Arrangement panel of the dialog box, click the border
arrangement that you want from the small boxes near the top of the
panel.
You see the result in the Preview pane in the User-Defined area. Use the
left, blank box near the top of the panel to delete all borders. (This box
is selected in Figure 5-11.)

4. In the Style area of the Line panel, choose the width and style of the
line.
5. From the Color drop-down list, choose a border line color.
6. Use the Shadow Style panel to create a shadow effect, if you want one.
7. In the Spacing to Contents panel, specify the distance between the
border line and the text (or other contents).
8. Click OK.
You can click individual sides of the border in the User-Defined area and set
different settings for each side.
To give your box a colored background, click the Background tab of the
Paragraph dialog box. Choose Color from the As drop-down list, and choose a
color. To create a background of an image, choose Graphic from the As drop-
down list and browse for the graphic file that you want to use.
Framing text
When you add a border to text, the text stays in the confines of the page’s
alignment and column settings. But suppose that you want to move a box of
text anywhere on your page? For example, if you create a two-column
newsletter, you may want a box of text that straddles the middle of the page.
This type of text is called a callout or a sidebar. You use frames to create a
movable box of text. Framed text acts like a graphic — you can drag a frame
anywhere, resize it, and so on.
To frame text, follow these steps:
1. Select the text that you want in the frame.
To create an empty frame, skip this step.
2. From the Main toolbar, long-click the Insert button and click the
Insert Frame Manually button.
You see a preview of columns.
3. Choose the number of columns that you want for the framed text.
Using a frame is one way to specify columns for part of a document. The
other way is to use sections. Using sections is explained in “Working
with sections,” earlier in this chapter.
4. Click at one corner of the selected text, and drag to the diagonally
opposite corner.
104
Part II: Using Writer — The Word Processor 

The text appears with a box and eight handles, which are small boxes
that you can use to resize the frame. To create an empty frame, drag
across an empty area of your page.
5. Click anywhere outside the frame to deselect the frame.
You can manipulate a frame in the following ways:
 Move it: Click the frame to select it. Move the cursor so that you see a
four-headed arrow, and drag in any direction.
 Resize it: Click the frame. Drag any of the handles.
 Delete it: Click the frame and press Delete.
 Edit the text: Click inside the frame, and edit the text as you would any
other text.
For more options, right-click any frame and choose one of the formatting
options from the shortcut menu that appears.
Linking text frames
You can link text frames so that the text flows from one frame to another.
This is a cool desktop publishing trick and looks great in a newsletter, as long
as the frames are not too far apart. Follow these steps to link text frames:
1. Create some framed text, following the steps that we described in the
previous section.
2. Create an empty frame, also using the previous steps.
3. Click the edge of the first frame.
4. Click the Link Frames button on the Object toolbar.
This button only appears when you have selected a frame that does not
already have a next link.
5. Click the edge of the second frame.
OpenOffice.org draws a line from the first frame to the second frame.
6. Type more text in the first frame.
When the first frame is full, it spills into the second frame. Cool!
To unlink frames, select a frame and choose the Unlink Frames button from
the Object toolbar.

Chapter 5: Designing Complex Documents 

Inserting Graphics
A picture is worth a thousand words, they say, and you would rather add one
graphic than type those thousand words. Why waste time? OpenOffice.org
offers lots of features for adding graphics.
Clipping art
The easiest way to insert art is to find some and insert it. Why create it your-
self? Of course, don’t use copyrighted art without permission. But you can
find lots of art that is available for anyone to use — often for free. To insert
an image, follow these steps:
1. Click in your document where you want the graphic to appear.
2. Choose Insert➪Graphics➪From File. Or, long-click the Insert button
on the Main toolbar and choose Insert Graphics.
3. In the Insert Graphics dialog box, locate and click the graphic file that
you want.
4. Click the Open button.
The graphic appears with eight square handles that show you that the
graphic is selected. Click outside the graphic to deselect it.
Editing graphics
When you select a graphic, you can do the following things:
 Move it: Point to the graphic so that you see a four-headed arrow cursor.
Drag the graphic to a new location.
 Resize it: Click one of the eight handles and drag inward (to make the
graphic smaller) or outward (to make it bigger).
 Delete it: Press Delete.
When you select a graphic, the Object toolbar changes to provide tools for
editing the graphic. You can make the following edits:
 Filter: Adds special effects. You have to try the different filters to see
what they do.
 Graphics mode: Changes a graphic from its default to grayscale, 
black and white, or a watermark (a faint image that’s often used as a
background).
 Red, green, and blue: Changes the coloring of the graphic.
106
Part II: Using Writer — The Word Processor 

 Brightness: Makes the graphic lighter or darker.
 Contrast: Increases or decreases the contrast.
 Gamma: Increases or decreases the gamma, which determines contrast
in dark areas of a graphic.
 Transparency: Sets the percentage of transparency.
 Flip horizontally or vertically: Mirrors the graphic along a horizontal or
vertical axis.
 Graphic properties: Opens the Graphic dialog box, where you can set
even more properties.
Using the Gallery
The Gallery is a place to hold graphics for later use. OpenOffice.org comes
with a selection of 3-D shapes, bullets, and other graphics, but no clip art. If
you have clip art that you may want to reuse, you can add it to the Gallery.
To use the Gallery, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Gallery.
The Gallery appears at the top of your screen, as shown in Figure 5-12.
Figure 5-12:
The Gallery

107
Chapter 5: Designing Complex Documents 

2. Choose one of the themes in the Gallery.
3. Drag a graphic into your document.
You can create your own themes, which are just categories of graphics. Then
you can add graphics files to the themes. Follow these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Gallery.
2. Choose New Theme.
The Properties of New Theme dialog box opens.
3. Click the General tab, and enter a name for the theme.
4. Click the Files tab.
5. Click the Add button. Locate the file, select it, and click the Open
button to add that file to the Gallery.
6. Click OK.
Adding shapes
OpenOffice.org has an excellent supply of tools for creating your own shapes.
You can fill the shapes with all sorts of cool fills and otherwise manipulate
them as you want.
If you want to create your own graphics, the Draw program offers the most
options, including 3-D effects. See Part V of this book for more details on the
Draw program. You can create a drawing in Draw and then copy and paste it
into your Writer document.
Creating shapes
When you start to draw, you should display the Draw Functions toolbar for
easy access to all the tools. Long-click the Show Draw Functions button on
the Main toolbar. Then drag the Draw Functions toolbar to a new location so
that it stays open, as shown in Figure 5-13.
The Draw Functions toolbar offers the following tools:
 Selection: Click to select all objects within a rectangular boundary. Drag
from one corner to the diagonally opposite corner of the boundary.
Then you can move all the selected objects by placing the cursor inside
the boundary and dragging. You can also resize all the objects at once
by dragging on any of the square handles.
You can press and hold Shift and click to select additional objects.
108
Part II: Using Writer — The Word Processor 

 Line: Click, drag in the desired direction, and release the mouse button
where you want the line to end. To constrain lines to 45-degree angles,
press and hold Shift as you drag.
 Rectangle: Click and drag from one corner to the diagonally opposite
corner. To create a perfect square, press and hold Shift as you drag.
 Ellipse: Click and drag from one corner to the diagonally opposite
corner. Ellipses don’t have corners, but try it and you’ll get the idea. To
create a perfect circle, press and hold Shift as you drag.
 Polygon: Click at the start point and drag; then release the mouse
button at the next point. To continue, click at the next point and keep
clicking away. Double-click to end the polygon.
 Curve: Click and drag at the start point; then release the mouse button
where you want to start defining the curve. Move the cursor to the
curve’s endpoint and click. Continue this process to create more curves.
You can simply click at a new point to create a straight segment. Double-
click to end the curve. You have to try this a few times to get used to
how it works.
 Freeform Line: Click and drag wherever you want. Just scribble. It’s fun!
Release the mouse button to stop scribbling.

Chapter 5: Designing Complex Documents 

 Arc: Follow the instructions to draw an ellipse or circle. When you stop,
you see a radius line. Click where you want the arc to start; then move
counterclockwise and click where you want the arc to end.
 Ellipse Pie: This works just like the arc, but you get a closed shape that
looks like a slice of pie. The closed shape is bounded by the arc (a line
from the arc’s center to the start point and a line from the arc’s center to
the endpoint).
 Circle Segment: This works like the ellipse pie, but the closed shape
is bounded by the arc and a line from the start point to the endpoint of
the arc.
 Text Frame: Drag diagonally to define the text frame, and then type your
text inside. To modify the frame’s properties, right-click and choose
from the options on the shortcut menu that appears.
 Text Animation: This inserts text that scrolls horizontally, like a ticker
tape.
 Callouts: This creates a callout with a line that points to something and
a rectangular box. Double-click inside the callout to type your text. You
can change the box to a circle by dragging inward on the largest corner
handle when the cursor becomes a hand.
Editing shapes
You can edit shapes like graphics. Click shapes to select them, and follow the
instructions that were presented in the section “Editing graphics,” earlier in
this chapter.
When you select a graphic, the Object toolbar changes to provide tools for
editing the graphic. You can do the following:
 Edit Points: Some types of shapes display points when you click this
button so that you can individually drag each point to modify the shape.
 Line: Opens the Line dialog box, where you can change the line style,
color, and width.
 Line Style: Offers a choice of line styles, such as dashed and dotted.
 Line Width: Offers a choice of line widths.
 Line Color: Lets you choose the line color.
 Area Style/Filling: Lets you choose the type of fill for closed shapes.
You can choose invisible, color, gradient, hatching, or bitmap. For more
options, right-click any filled shape and choose Area from the shortcut
menu that appears to open the Area dialog box. Use this dialog box to
define the fill. You’ll find lots of options here!
110
Part II: Using Writer — The Word Processor 

 Area Style/Filling 2: This drop-down list lets you choose the specific fill
based on the type of fill that you chose in the first Area Style/Filling
drop-down list. For more options, use the Area dialog box, as explained
in the previous item.
 Object rotation mode: Select a shape, click this button, and then drag
one of the corner handles to rotate a shape.
 Change anchor: Changes the connection of the shape to a paragraph or
page, or places it as a character.
 To Foreground: Moves the selected shape in front of text.
 To Background: Moves the selected shape behind text.
 Bring to Front: Places the selected shape in front of other shapes.
 Send to Back: Places the selected shape behind other shapes.
 Arrange Object: If you select more than one object (press and hold Shift
and click to select additional objects), this tool aligns the objects verti-
cally or horizontally for a nice, neat look.

Keeping Control of 
Your Documents
In This Chapter
 Hyperlinking text
 Tracking changes in a document
 Managing versions of a document
 Password-protecting documents
Your documents do not live on an isolated island. Instead, they have con-
nections with other documents, Web pages, Calc spreadsheets, and all
sorts of other files. Managing all these relationships can be tricky, but hyper-
linking is one way to make your documents friendly with all their relations.
If you’re the type that edits, re-edits, and then edits again, you may want to
keep track of all your changes. Also, people who work on documents in a col-
laborative environment often need to know who is changing what. In this
chapter, we explain two techniques for keeping control of your documents
and their relationships with the outside world.
Linking to the World
A hyperlink is a connection to another file. You may want to tell your readers
where they can find more information or learn about something new. Either
way, you can link text to any other file, whether that file is on your hard drive,
on a network or intranet, or on the World Wide Web. Readers who are looking
at your document on a computer (as opposed to on paper) can click the
hyperlink and immediately view the other file.

Creating a hyperlink
Hyperlinks are easy to create. Follow these steps to create a hyperlink:
1. Select the text that you want to hyperlink.
2. Choose Insert➪Hyperlink, or click the Hyperlink Dialog button on the
Function toolbar.
The Hyperlink dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 6-1.
If you prefer, you can also use the Hyperlink Bar. Choose View➪
Toolbars➪Hyperlink Bar. It’s quicker for creating several hyperlinks, 
but you have to type in the URLs or filenames.
3. In the left side of the dialog box, choose the type of link that you want
to create — to the Internet, to an e-mail address or newsgroup, to a
document, or to a new (as yet uncreated) document.
The Hyperlink dialog box changes according to your choice.
4. Specify the location of the Web page, document, or whatever you
choose.
You can browse to find the document, so you don’t have to remember its
location by heart. If you hyperlink to a document, you can specify a
bookmark in the document. For more information on creating book-
marks, see the section “Hiking with your mouse,” in Chapter 3.
5. If you want, change the text that the hyperlink displays.
6. From the Form drop-down list, choose to add the hyperlink to the
selected text or to create a cute little button next to the text.
As of this writing, a bug keeps buttons in Design mode after you first
create them — and they don’t work! To turn off Design mode, select the
button. A new toolbar appears. On that toolbar, choose Design Mode
On/Off. Now your button works. Future buttons that you create in that
document will also work.

114
Part II: Using Writer — The Word Processor 

7. Click the Apply button.
8. Click the Close button.
To use a hyperlink, click it. When the cursor is over the hyperlink, the cursor
becomes a hand.
Editing a hyperlink
You can edit hyperlinks to change their address or the text that they display.
Editing a text hyperlink is somewhat different from editing a button hyperlink.
Editing text hyperlinks
Text hyperlinks are easy to edit. To edit the hyperlink, follow these steps:
1. Select the hyperlink by pressing and holding Alt and then clicking the
hyperlink. (This avoids activating the hyperlink.)
You can also click the hyperlink box on the status bar (the box display
changes from HYP to SEL) so that you can select a hyperlink.
2. Choose Insert➪Hyperlink.
The Hyperlink dialog box opens.
3. Make any changes that you want in the Hyperlink dialog box.
See the instructions in the previous section for information on using the
Hyperlink dialog box.
4. Click the Apply button.
5. Click the Close button.
Editing button hyperlinks
Editing button hyperlinks is slightly more involved than editing text hyper-
links, because the button is a form, a structure that is used to create inter-
faces that help you work with your computer software. Follow these steps to
edit a button hyperlink:
1. On the Main toolbar, long-click the Show Form Functions button so
that the Form Functions floating toolbar remains open.
2. Choose Design Mode On/Off.
You can now select the buttons in your document.
3. Click the button hyperlink that you want to edit.
115
Chapter 6: Keeping Control of Your Documents 

4. Right-click (Control+click on the Mac) and choose Control from the
shortcut menu that appears to open the Properties: Button dialog box,
as shown in Figure 6-2.
5. Use the URL box to change the URL, and use the Label list box to
change the text that appears on the button.
6. Click the Close button in the Properties: Button dialog box.
7. To activate the button hyperlink again, choose Design Mode On/Off
from the Object toolbar.
Tracking Changes in Documents
You may want to keep track of changes that you or another person makes to
a document. Perhaps you are not sure that you want to keep the changes and
want a way to easily undo them. You may need to show the changes to your
boss and get approval before finalizing them. Or maybe you are suggesting
changes to a subordinate or colleague but want that person to clearly see
what has been changed and then respond to your suggestions. If many
people are collaborating on a document, wouldn’t you like to know who is
suggesting which changes? You have many reasons to want to know exactly
what has changed in a document.
The Record Changes feature of OpenOffice.org Writer enables you to mark
each change that was made in a document and distinguish the author of all
changes. Once a document has changes marked, you can easily
 See exactly what has changed and how.
 Know who made the change.
Figure 6-2:

116
Part II: Using Writer — The Word Processor 

 Accept or reject any change.
 Enter a comment for a change — perhaps to explain it to yourself later.
 Merge changes into the original document.
Displaying changes
To start displaying changes in your document, choose Edit➪Changes➪Record.
 Any subsequent additions that you make are underlined and have a dif-
ferent color that depends on the author of the change.
 Deletions have a horizontal line through them.
 Lines that contain changes show a vertical line in the left margin, as
shown in Figure 6-3.
To stop marking changes, choose Edit➪Changes➪Record again.
Figure 6-3:
A paragraph
shows some
additions
and
deletions.
117
Chapter 6: Keeping Control of Your Documents 

You can specify how changes are marked. Choose Tools➪Options➪
Text Document➪Changes.
Working with changes
When you start recording changes, you simply edit your document as you
normally would and you see the changes automatically. However, you may
want to add a comment to explain why you added text. To add a comment,
follow these steps:
1. Select the addition.
You can’t comment on deletions.
2. Choose Edit➪Changes➪Comment.
The Comment dialog box opens.
3. In the Text box, enter the comment.
4. Click OK.
When you create a comment, the comment appears in the Accept or Reject
Changes dialog box, which is discussed next and shown in Figure 6-4. If you
have Extended Tips turned on (choose Help➪Extended Tips), the comment
also appears when you place the cursor over the change.
The most common task that you need to accomplish with a document that
marks changes is to accept or reject the changes. (You can follow a simple
Figure 6-4:
Use the
Accept or
Reject
Changes
dialog box
to decide
the fate of
marked
changes 
in your
document.
118
Part II: Using Writer — The Word Processor 

rule — accept those that you make and reject those that others suggest!) To
accept or reject changes, follow these steps:
1. Choose Edit➪Changes➪Accept or Reject.
The Accept or Reject Changes dialog box, shown in Figure 6-4, opens,
with the List tab displayed.
2. On the List tab, click the first item.
OpenOffice.org highlights the insertion or deletion in your document.
3. Click the Reject button or the Accept button to reject or accept the
change.
Click the Reject All button or the Accept All button to process all the
changes at once.
4. Click the Close button in the Accept or Reject Changes dialog box.
Click the Filter tab to filter the list of changes. You can filter changes by date,
author, action (insertion or deletion), or comment.
Suppose that you want to make sure that no one makes changes without
marking them. You can password-protect the Record Changes feature so that
no one can turn it off or accept or reject changes. You want complete and
final control!
To password-protect the Record Changes feature, choose Edit➪Changes➪
Protect Records. Enter a password (and confirm it), and click OK. Repeat this
process — this time entering the password — to turn off password protection.
In the section “Password-Protecting Documents,” later in this chapter, we
explain how to password-protect an OpenOffice.org document so that only
authorized people can open it.
Comparing and merging documents
If you forget to use the Record Changes feature and send a document to
others for editing, you need a way to find their changes. Proofreading the two
documents side-by-side would take forever! OpenOffice.org comes to the
rescue with its Compare Documents feature, which essentially creates the
addition and deletion markings for you. You can then decide whether to
incorporate the changes into your original document. Follow these steps:
1. Open your original document.
We’ll call the original document Document 1.
2. Choose Edit➪Compare Document.
The Insert dialog box opens.
119
Chapter 6: Keeping Control of Your Documents 

3. In the Insert dialog box, choose the document that contains the
changes and click the Insert button.
We’ll call this changed document Document 2. You now see, in
Document 1, markings that show all the differences between the 
two documents. The Accept or Reject Changes dialog box opens.
Read carefully now. Text that’s in Document 1 but not in Document 2
(text that someone else deleted in Document 2) appears as inserted
text (with an underline). Text that’s in Document 2 but not in
Document 1 (text that someone else added in Document 2) appears
as deleted text. (This is the opposite of what we expected.)
4. To accept the changes that the other person made in Document 2, you
reject the insertions and deletions. To keep Document 1 in its original
form, accept the insertions and deletions.
You can find further instructions on using this feature in the previous
section of this chapter.
5. Click the Close button to close the dialog box.
Managing Versions
Sometimes you need to keep several versions of a document so that you can
quickly go back to an earlier version if necessary. Version management keeps
track of successive states of a document within one file. If you want, you can
eventually merge your versions.
The Versions feature only works if you save your files in OpenOffice.org’s
native .sxw format.
To save versions of a document, follow these steps:
1. Create and save a document. Name it Letter to Joanne. Then make
further changes to it so that you have an original document and a ver-
sion of the document that differs from the original.
2. Choose File➪Versions.
The Versions of Letter to Joanne dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 6-5.
3. Click the Save New Version button to save a new version of the 
document.
The Insert Version Comment dialog box opens.
4. In the Insert Version Comment dialog box, enter a comment that
explains what you have added or deleted and click OK.
OpenOffice.org automatically includes the date and time of the version
as well as the name of the person who saves the version.
120
Part II: Using Writer — The Word Processor 

5. To be sure that you always save a version for this document, select the
Always Save a Version on Closing check box.
6. To save the version and return to your document, click the Close
button.
You can manage your versions in the following ways:
 To revert to one of the previous versions, choose File➪Versions, select the
version and click the Open button. OpenOffice.org opens the version as a
read-only file. Choose File➪Save As to save the version as a separate file.
 To display a long comment that doesn’t fit in the Versions of [filename]
dialog box, click the Show button to open the Insert Version Comment
dialog box.
 To delete a version, select the version and click the Delete button.
 To compare versions, click the Compare button. OpenOffice.org marks
the changes in your document so that you can see what you have added
or deleted, as compared to previous versions. In the Accept or Reject
Changes dialog box, accept or reject the changes, as explained in the
section “Tracking Changes in Documents,” earlier in this chapter.
Accepting changes does not delete your versions, so you can still revert to a
previous version.
If you use the File➪Save As command to save a copy of a file, OpenOffice.org
does not save version information.
Inserting Notes
If you need to remind yourself about a task that you need to complete (I need
to complete this chapter!) or if you want to leave a note for a colleague who
Figure 6-5:
When 
you save
versions of
a document,
OpenOffice.
org keeps
track of your
changes
within 
one file.
121
Chapter 6: Keeping Control of Your Documents 

will read the document, you can insert a note. A note is a place to store com-
ments that shouldn’t go in the text of the document itself. A note shows up as
a small yellow rectangle, so you can easily see where the notes are.
To insert a note, follow these steps:
1. Place the cursor where you want the note to appear.
2. Choose Insert➪Note.
The Insert Note dialog box opens.
3. Type the text for the note. If you want to add the author’s name, the
date, and the time, click the Author button.
4. Click OK.
A thin yellow rectangle appears where you placed the cursor.
To read the note, place the cursor over the rectangle. The note appears as a
tooltip. To edit the note, double-click the note and make any changes that
you want in the Edit Note dialog box. If you have more than one note in a doc-
ument, press ←or →to navigate from note to note.
Password-Protecting Documents
For the ultimate in protection, you can make sure that only people who have
your special, secret password can open your documents.
You can only password-protect documents that you save in OpenOffice.org’s
native .sxw format.
To password-protect a document, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Save As.
The Save As dialog box opens.
2. Select the Save with Password check box.
3. Click the Save button.
If you have already saved the document once and want to resave it with
a password but without changing its name or location, confirm that you
want to replace the original file. The Enter Password dialog box opens.
4. Enter the password twice, once in the Password text box and again in
the Confirm text box.
5. Click OK.
122
Part II: Using Writer — The Word Processor 

The next time that you or someone else tries to open the document, the
Enter Password dialog box opens. Enter the password and click OK to open
the document.
When you password-protect a document, you obviously can’t open it without
the password. So — don’t forget the password!
To remove the password protection, choose File➪Save As and deselect the
Save with Password check box.

Creating Web Pages
In This Chapter
 Laying out your Web page
 Adding pictures and backgrounds
 Linking
 Viewing your HTML code
O
penOffice.org Writer allows you to create great-looking Web pages with
astonishing ease. Generate your own Web pages for business or pleasure,
and make your presence known in the virtual reality of the World Wide Web.
Plunging into HTML Land
With just a few steps, you, too, can be in HTML land, viewing your own Web
page on your browser.
To create a simple Web page, choose View➪Online Layout or choose File➪
New➪HTML Document. Then create your Web page by typing what you want
and inserting any graphics you like. Insert graphics by choosing, oddly
enough, Insert➪Graphics.
To save your Web page, choose File➪Save As, type in the filename, choose
HTML Document from the File type combo box, and click OK. That’s all there
is to it! OpenOffice.org automatically generates the HTML code that Web
browsers require to display Web pages. HTML is short for HyperText Markup
Language, which is the standard language of the World Wide Web.
You can now view your Web page with a browser. When you do this, notice
that Writer automatically lines up your graphics vertically and left-justifies
them. Also, all your text gets lined up and is left-justified automatically.

You probably want a more detailed layout than just the simplest Web page.
Fortunately, OpenOffice.org’s Writer allows you to create sophisticated-
looking Web sites quickly and easily — without a B.S. in computer science!
Keeping your Web browser window open all the time gives you instant feed-
back about what your page looks like in a browser window. Just save your
HTML document each time you want to take a look at it, and reload the page
in your browser to view it.
Setting the Table
For some reason, HTML likes to use tables — that’s right, the same kind of
tables that are in a spreadsheet. But with HTML, you don’t need as many
cells as you have in a spreadsheet, and you can merge cells and split cells so
that your table can have a different number of cells in each row. For example,
Figure 7-1 has three cells on the first row, six cells on the second row, and
then three cells in each of the remaining rows. In a Writer table, unlike a
spreadsheet table, your text always wraps in the cell, and when you press
Return you can start a new paragraph in the same cell of your table. So any
cell in an HTML table can hold as many rows of text as you want. That is why
Figure 7-1 has only a total of 12 cells. Neat, huh?
Figure 7-1:

create Web
page that

Part II: Using Writer — The Word Processor 

Inserting a table
The first thing that you typically do to create a Web page is to create a
table, unless all you want to do is just upload some pictures of your kids
so that your mother can see them. In this latter case, you can skip the table.
But to create a professional-looking Web site to impress your boss, client,
customers — or even your mother — you need to use a table.
To create a table, perform the following steps:
1. Choose File➪New➪HTML Document.
A new blank HTML document appears, filling your window.
2. Click the Insert Table icon on the Main toolbar. It’s the topmost icon
and looks like a grid. (If you long-click the icon, the Insert toolbar
appears. Then click the Insert Table icon on the Insert toolbar.)
The Insert Table dialog box appears.
3. Choose a name for your table, if you want, or just use the name that
Writer inserts.
4. Enter the number of columns and rows into the spin boxes.
In Figure 7-1, we chose three rows and three columns. We chose one row
for the title, one row for the buttons, and one row for the body of the
Web page. You can always create more cells or merge cells in any row,
and you can always add rows or columns later. Or you can insert
another table below this table later on.
5. Select or deselect the Header check box and the Repeat Header
check box.
You’ll probably want a header for each Web page. A header automati-
cally chooses the table heading style in the first row of boxes and allows
you to repeat the header at the top of every page (if your table is more
than one page and if you select the Repeat Header check box).
6. Select the Border check box, if you want a border.
This is a personal preference. You can always put borders in or take
them out later. We always select the Border check box because we like
to see exactly where our cells are.
7. To AutoFormat your table, click the AutoFormat button, choose a style
from the list box in the AutoFormat dialog box, and click OK.
Unless you have lots of columns and rows, like a spreadsheet, you prob-
ably don’t want to AutoFormat your table.
127
Chapter 7: Creating Web Pages 

8. Click OK.
If you do not select the Borders check box in Step 6, you don’t see much
change in your page. The only difference is that the ruler now has set-
tings for your cells.
If you select the Borders check box in Step 6, you see your table with
borders. Don’t be surprised by how small your table is. Remember, as
you type text and insert graphics into your cell, the cell (and the entire
row) expands vertically to hold it all. That’s how just a few cells can
become an entire Web page — even a whole Web site!
Save your Web page to a separate folder. Save any graphics for your docu-
ment in that folder, too. If you have lots of files, you may want to organize
them in multiple folders, but keep all the folders within a single main folder
that’s dedicated to that Web site or that Web page. This keeps everything
together as a unit for easy uploading to the Web server.
Formatting a table
Tables with no formatting are like grids. And grids are not very aesthetically
pleasing. So, Writer offers ways to format your table. You can change the
column width if you want a small column for links on one side of the page and
a much larger column for the body of your Web page. Also, with the ease of
clicking the mouse, Writer lets you merge cells together or split cells apart. In
Figure 7-1, the cells in the second row, which contains the buttons, were split
several times.
You may want to insert or delete rows or columns, or you may want to display
some nicely aligned graphics. As a result, you may want to equalize some
column widths and/or row widths. Writer can do all that for you and more.
Resizing columns
Pass your mouse over the border between two columns (even if it is invisi-
ble), and when your mouse pointer changes to a double-headed arrow, click
and drag to resize the column.
Getting the right look for your table
Your Table Object toolbar provides easy access to those many useful table
features, such as splitting cells, merging cells, adding or deleting rows or
columns, spacing rows and columns equally, and so on.
If your Table Object toolbar does not already appear, click the small triangle.
If that does not produce the Table Object toolbar, click in a cell of the table,
making sure that you do not select a graphic, and look again, or click the
small triangle again.
128
Part II: Using Writer — The Word Processor 

You can get the right look for your table by following these tips:
 To split a cell, click inside the cell and click the Split Cell icon on the
Table Object toolbar. In the Split Cells dialog box, enter the number of
cells that you want to split your cell into, and click the direction:
Horizontally or Vertically. Then click OK. Your cell is split into the
number of parts you specified.
 To merge two cells, select the cells that you want to merge and click the
Merge Cell icon on the Table Object toolbar.
 To insert a row, select a cell in the row above the row that you want to
insert and click the Insert Row icon on the Table Object toolbar.
 To insert a column, select a cell in the column to the left of the column
that you want to insert and click the Insert Column icon on the Table
Object toolbar.
 To optimize your column width, long-click the Optimize icon on the
Table Object toolbar to view the Optimizing toolbar. Then click in the
column that you want to optimize, and click the Optimal Column Width
icon. Writer shrinks the column to fit the largest entry.
 To space some columns equally, select the columns that you want to
evenly space and long-click the Optimize icon on the Table Object tool-
bar to make the Optimizing toolbar appear. Then click the Space
Columns Equally icon.
 To space all rows equally, select the rows that you want to evenly space
and long-click the Optimize icon on the Table Object toolbar to make the
Optimizing toolbar appear. Then click the Space Rows Equally icon.
After clicking the Space Rows Equally icon, the Optimal Row Height icon
becomes available. You can click that icon to optimize the row height, as
well, to get the rows spaced equally.
 To delete a row or column, click in a cell of the row or column that you
want to delete. Be careful, of course, not to select a graphic. Then click
the Delete Row icon or the Delete Cell icon on the Table Object toolbar.
Selecting your cells
To select more than one cell, click in a corner cell of the range of cells that
you want to select. Hold down the mouse button so that a cursor appears,
and without releasing the button, drag to select the entire range of cells.
To select a single cell, click in the cell that you want to select. Hold down the
mouse button so that a cursor appears, and without releasing the button,
drag to an adjacent cell and then drag back to the original cell.
Adding and modifying borders and colored backgrounds
Borders and backgrounds add flair to your Web page. You can also use a
border to help you begin designing your Web page and then delete the border.
129
Chapter 7: Creating Web Pages 

You can use the buttons on the Table icon bar to select your background,
background color, and so on, but using the Table Format dialog box gives you
more detailed options.
To insert, delete, or modify borders, perform the following steps:
1. Select the cell or cells in which you want to insert, delete, or modify a
border. Or, click in any cell to modify the entire table.
2. Choose Format➪Table, and click the Borders tab.
The Table Format dialog box appears, with the Borders tab displayed.
3. Choose an arrangement from one of the Line Arrangement boxes, or
click a line in the User-defined list box to define your own border.
Then choose your line style from the Style list box, and choose a color
from the Color combo box. You can even adjust the Spacing to con-
tents (or you can keep the defaults).
4. Click OK.
Your new border appears (if you chose a line arrangement with no lines
or the line style None, your border disappears).
To fill your table cell or cells with a background color, perform the following
steps:
1. Click in the cell, row, or table that you want to fill with a background
color.
2. Choose Format➪Table, and click the Background tab.
The Table Format dialog box appears, with the Background tab 
displayed.
3. To apply the background to the entire row or entire table, choose
Row or Table from the For combo box. Otherwise, choose the default
of Cell.
4. Click the color that you want for your background, or click the No Fill
button.
5. Click OK.
The background color fills your cell. Save your document, and check it
out in your browser. Like it?
Getting Your Web-Safe Colors
Some computers out in Web land are still showing only 256 colors
instead of millions of colors. If you don’t mind your colors changing a bit
130
Part II: Using Writer — The Word Processor 

to accommodate the browsers in these computers, you can skip this section.
But, if you want all users to see the same colors that you see, you need to
change your color palette to Web-safe colors.
To change your color palette to Web-safe colors, perform the following steps:
1. Click the Text Animation icon on the Main toolbar. (It’s a T with a
double arrow under it.)
This makes the Standard Draw Object bar appear; you need this bar to
change your colors. (It has nothing to do with animating text.)
2. Click the Paint Can icon on the Object bar beside the Color combo
box. Or choose Format➪Area.
The Area dialog box appears.
3. Click the Colors tab. (Don’t click the Colors button; click the tab at the
top of the dialog box.)
The Colors tab appears.
4. Click the Load Color List button. It’s the small button below the Delete
button.
The Open dialog box appears and displays a list of files with the .soc
extension.
5. Choose web.soc, and click the Open button.
The Open dialog box closes, and the colors on the Colors tab in the Area
dialog box now show the Web-safe colors. You can tell because when
you click any color, that color’s name appears in the Name box, and it is
a set of numbers. For example, bright yellow is 255 255 0, turquoise blue
is 0 255 255, and olive green is 153 204 0.
6. Click OK.
The Area dialog box closes. Now, whenever the color palette appears, it
only offers Web-safe colors.
Dealing with Text
Browsers often change fonts, so don’t get attached to any beautiful lettering.
If you want your text to look exactly how you create it, you need to open a
Draw document, type in your text, and then export the document to a GIF file.
Then return to your HTML document, choose Insert➪Graphics, and insert
your GIF file into your cell. Having some of your text as GIF files looks nicer,
but it takes longer for your browser to read them in, so it may not be practi-
cal for your whole Web page. Just a few titles here and there are usually
enough to give your page the right touch. In Figure 7-1, the title Fabulous
Flowers is a GIF file.
131
Chapter 7: Creating Web Pages 

Writer allows you to toggle back and forth between the Text Object bar and
the Table Object bar in the table, by clicking the button with the triangle on
the left side of the Object bar. Select the text, and use the Text Object bar to
change the color of your text, change the justification, or change the type
size. Refer to Chapter 4 for the scoop on formatting text.
HTML styles
Writer automatically uses the Table Heading style when you click in the first
row. This is boldface and centered. The lower rows all have Table Contents
style — not boldface and left-justified. Any of these styles can be changed, of
course, but the HTML styles help to create the same look for your text in the
browser as in your HTML document window.
Aligning text
Aligning text horizontally is easy — just use the Align buttons on the Text
Object bar. But sometimes you also want to center your text vertically, espe-
cially when your cell’s row height is large enough to hold more than one line
of text. To center text vertically, click in the cell in which you want to center
your text vertically and then choose Format➪Table. Then click the Text Flow
tab of the Table Format dialog box, select the Centered check box in the
Vertical Alignment panel, and click OK. Your text centers vertically in the cell,
but you need to save your document and check it out in a browser to really
see the effect.
Check out your finished Web page on as many browsers as you can to make
sure that it looks good on all of them. Include the Internet Explorer, Netscape,
and Safari browsers. Sometimes something that works perfectly in one browser
doesn’t work another. For example, the vertical alignment of text does not
work in the Konquerer browser. This is not Writer’s fault. This happens
because perfect compliance with evolving HTML standards does not exist in
the World Wide Web. Some things may always appear different in different
browsers. Webmasters spend much of their time inserting code into HTML
documents to adjust for these irregularities.
Adding Pretty Pictures
Pictures are a huge part of Web pages today. Web designers used to need to
keep pictures to a minimum in order for Web pages to load quickly, but now
many people have DSL or faster connections, and even videos can be down-
loaded. So, if you want pictures, go ahead and add them. Place your pictures
where you want by inserting them or copying and pasting them from a Draw
132
Part II: Using Writer — The Word Processor 

document or by dragging them in from the gallery. You can also use pictures
as backgrounds for your cells. In Figure 7-1, the flowers are imported from the
gallery as backgrounds.
To import a graphic from a file or from the gallery into your Web page, per-
form the following steps:
1. Copy the graphic file to the folder that contains your HTML document
(if they’re not already in the same folder).
• You can do this in Windows by right-clicking a file in Windows
Explorer, dragging the file from one folder to the other, and then
choosing Copy Here from the shortcut menu that appears.
• On the Mac, you can do this by Option+clicking the file in the
Finder and dragging the file from one folder to another.
• The way to copy a file in Linux varies depending on your particular
window manager, but the procedure is usually similar.
2. Click in the cell that you want to import the graphic to.
A cursor appears in the cell.
3. Choose Insert➪Graphics.
The Insert Graphic dialog box appears.
4. Browse through your files to the folder that contains your HTML docu-
ment, and select the image file that you placed there in Step 1.
5. Click the Open button.
The image fills the cell and is selected, and it may even expand the cell’s
size vertically. The Graphics object bar replaces the Text Object bar or
Table Object toolbar.
6. Resize the image by clicking and dragging the green handles around
the edges of the image.
The image resizes and centers itself.
7. Select the text wrapping option:
• To wrap your text around the image on the left, select your image,
click the Align Right icon on the Graphics Object bar, and then
click the Wrap Left icon.
• To wrap your text around your image on the right, select your
image, click the Align Left icon, and then click the Wrap Right icon.
The image moves to the left or the right, and the text flows around it in
the space. Notice that there is no icon for centering the image. To recen-
ter the image, you need to do a Ctrl+Z or two immediately, or delete the
image and insert it again.
133
Chapter 7: Creating Web Pages 

8. To vertically align your image in a cell, click the Anchor icon on the
Graphics Object bar and choose As character. Then click the Align
Vertical Center icon.
Your image vertically aligns to the cell. Notice that two of the vertical
alignment icons on the Graphics Object bar are now highlighted and
active: Align Top and Align Vertical Center. To activate the Align Bottom
button, click the Anchor icon and choose Page.
9. Add borders to your graphic by clicking the Borders icon and choos-
ing your border style. Then refine it by clicking the Line Style icon
and the Line Color of Border icon and Background Color.
That’s it!
You can also copy and paste an image into your document, such as an image
from Draw. Just copy the object, and then click in your HTML document
where you want the image to appear. Make sure that a cursor appears, and
then press Ctrl+V to paste the image. Your object appears. Now you can per-
form Steps 6 through 9.
To insert a gallery item, open the gallery by choosing Tools➪Gallery. If the
gallery is already open, click the Show triangle on the far left above the
Object toolbar. Then drag any item into a cell in the table, and perform Steps
6 through 9.
Keep track of how your graphics look with different Web browsers. Some
irregularities may be lurking out there.
To create a background in your cell, row, or table by using an image from a
file or from the gallery, perform the following steps:
1. Copy the graphic file to the folder that contains your HTML document
(if they’re not already in the same folder).
• You can do this in Windows by right-clicking a file in Windows
Explorer, dragging the file from one folder to the other, and then
choosing Copy Here from the shortcut menu that appears.
• On the Mac, you can do this by Option+clicking the file in the
Finder and dragging the file from one folder to another.
• The way to copy a file in Linux varies depending on your particular
window manager, but the procedure is usually similar.
The path to the gallery files is OpenOffice.org1.1Beta/share/
gallery/www-back.
2. Click in the cell in which you want to create your background.
3. Choose Format➪Table, and click the Background tab.
The Table Format dialog box appears, with the Background tab showing
a grid of colors.
134
Part II: Using Writer — The Word Processor 

4. Choose Cell from the For combo box if you want the background
to appear in just the selected cell, choose Row to have the background
appear in a row, or choose Table if you want the background
to appear in the whole table.
5. Choose Graphic from the As combo box.
The grid of colors closes and a new window appears.
6. Click Browse to select the file that you want to import.
The Find Graphics dialog box appears.
7. Select the file that you want to import. (This is the file that you moved
into the same folder as your HTML document in Step 1.)
The image appears in the Preview area at the far right of the dialog box.
8. Click the Open button.
The Find Graphics dialog box closes, and the image appears in the
Preview area of the Table Format dialog box. (If it does not, select the
Preview check box.)
9. You usually tile a background, so select the Tile check box. If you
don’t want to tile it, select the Position check box and click in one of
the nine circles to specify where it should be in the cell.
10. Click OK.
Your background now fills your cell, row, or table, depending on what
you specified in Step 4.
Creating Lots of Links
Links are one of the most dazzling features of Web design, yet they are also
one of the simplest features to add. You can use buttons for links or you can
use text — whichever suits your fancy.
Follow these steps to create a link:
1. Select the text that you want to transform into a link.
2. Open your Web browser, and browse to find the Web page that you
want to link to. Then copy the entire URL.
This URL can be from your own files or from the Internet.
3. Return to your OpenOffice.org document, and choose Insert➪
Hyperlink. Or, click the Hyperlink Dialog icon on the Function 
toolbar.
The Hyperlink dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 7-2. The selected
text appears in the Text input box.
135
Chapter 7: Creating Web Pages 

4. Select the Internet option button, if it is not already selected. Then
paste your URL into the Target input box.
5. From the Frame combo box, choose _blank to open a new window
with your link. Or, choose _self to open the link in the same browser
window.
The commands parent and top are useful only when using frames.
(Frames are HTML documents that can be displayed together in a single
Web page so that the browser appears to contain a single document,
when it actually contains more than one document. And these frames
can link to other frames. So part of your Web page can change when
someone clicks a link, and the rest can stay the same.)
6. Type a unique name into the Name box.
HTML needs a name for the link. Any name will do; just be sure that it’s
different from the name of any other link.
7. Click the Apply button.
The text that you selected is now underlined and is now active in your
HTML document. So don’t try selecting it again, unless you want things
to happen.
To modify a hyperlink, click the hyperlink box on the status bar. (If the status
bar is not visible, choose View➪Status Bar to make it appear.) Clicking this
box toggles the hyperlink box between HYP and SEL. The SEL option allows
you to select a hyperlink without activating it. Be sure that this box displays
SEL, and then return to Step 2.
To use buttons as links instead of text, refer to Chapter 6.
Figure 7-2:

Hyperlink
dialog box.

Seeing Your HTML Code
The question is, “Do you really want to see your HTML code?” If you do, click
the HTML Source icon on the Main toolbar. Your HTML code appears. Scroll
down to get a good look. Like it? If so, you may want to consider a career in
computer programming. The typical reaction is to close the window again as
soon as possible.
Actually, some reasons exist to fiddle with the code. One reason is that not all
browsers work the same. For a specific item in the Web page that is not dis-
playing well on a lone browser, a programmer can modify the code to work
for that specific browser. But that kind of fine-tuning is beyond the scope of
this book.

Using Calc — The
Spreadsheet

In this part . . .
S
preadsheets are a nifty tool for organizing data. They
are perfect for keeping track of money, information,
all kinds of things. Anything that requires a list is a good
candidate for putting into a spreadsheet.
Not only does your spreadsheet store your data, but it can
also do wonderful, almost magical things with it. Want to
see a pie chart of how you spend your money? Or to ﬁgure
out your monthly payments on a new home you want to
purchase? It’s easy in a spreadsheet. How about storing a
mailing list for your business and printing out labels in Zip
code order? And while you’re at it, why not automatically
keep track of your inventory, accounts receivable, accounts
payable, budgets, payroll, ﬁnancial statements, and more!
And if your business uses a database program, such as
dBase, MySQL, or many other types, you can link to your
database using Calc to ﬁnd the information you need or to
create the reports and charts. The number of things that
can be done using this program is amazing.  
In this part you experience the awesome power of Calc.

Chapter 8
Creating a Spreadsheet
In This Chapter
 Creating your spreadsheet
 Moving around in your spreadsheet
 Editing your data
 Saving your spreadsheet
I
n this chapter, you find out how to create a spreadsheet in Calc and navi-
gate around your document. We show you how to easily input and edit
your data, and how to add, delete, or hide your columns and rows. And, most
importantly, you read about how to save your handiwork.
Getting the Basics Down
A spreadsheet is a grid of boxes. Each box is called a cell. Each cell is
located in a particular row and column in the grid, as you can see in Figure
8-1. Your spreadsheet’s ability to store numbers (and text) is enormous.
The spreadsheet can contain 32,000 rows and 255 columns. If each row were
about 1⁄4 inch tall, Calc could produce a single sheet in your spreadsheet as
tall as a 40-story skyscraper!
Each cell is available to store data. You can store a single number in a cell or
an entire book (although that is rare). Or, the cell can be empty. Whatever
use you make of your cells is up to you.
More than one cell is called a range of cells. You can select a range of cells
and move them, copy them, format them, and so on as easily as a single cell.
Usually you use spreadsheets to store a table or groups of tables. A table is a
range of cells with related data. For example, a grocery list with quantities is
a table. Your spreadsheet may have only one table in it, or it may have a hun-
dred tables or more. Tables can be as small as two cells or as big as, well, a
40-story skyscraper.

If you have more than one table that is related, such as a monthly budget,
you can stack the tables into sheets. By using sheets, you have the ability to
add or otherwise manipulate your data in three directions: vertically, hori-
zontally, and by depth.
Inputting Your Data
To open your spreadsheet, choose File➪New➪Spreadsheet. A grid of cells
appears, with toolbars and a main menu, as shown in Figure 8-1. This is your
spreadsheet.
Notice that one cell has a dark frame around it. This is your active cell. When
you type and enter data into your spreadsheet, Calc places the data in the
active cell. The dark frame around the cell is called the active cell pointer.
Calc assigns each cell an address, which is the column name of the cell, fol-
lowed by the row name — for example, A1 or Z4026. You refer to a range of
cells by using the cell names of the upper-left cell and the lower-right cell,
separated by a colon — for example, A1:Z4026.
Entering your data
To enter data into a cell, just start typing. Your data appears within the active
cell. When you press Enter, Calc moves the active cell pointer to the cell
Figure 8-1:
The basic
anatomy of
a Calc
spread-
sheet.
142
Part III: Using Calc - The Spreadsheet 

below. To enter your data in a different direction, press an arrow key instead
of pressing Enter after entering your data. The active cell pointer relocates
accordingly.
Want to type a whole lot of text in a single cell? Calc handles text in clever
ways. Don’t worry if your text is longer than the width of the cell. The text
shows in the next cell, as long as that cell is empty. And, if that cell is not
empty, you can always double-click the cell with your text, and your full line
of text appears.
Editing your data
Entering data is easy with Calc, but what if you want to change what you
entered? Fortunately, editing data is just as easy.
To edit the contents of the active cell, follow these steps:
1. Double-click the cell that you want to edit.
This transforms the cell into the active cell and causes a cursor to
appear within the cell.
2. Move the cursor with the arrow keys to where you want to edit.
You can also click anywhere in your data, and the cursor repositions itself.
3. Type in your change.
4. Press Enter.
Using Insert mode and Overwrite mode
Do you like to click buttons, even when you don’t know what they do? If the
answer is yes, you need to know about Insert and Overwrite modes. Getting
stuck in Overwrite mode is no fun. But read on to understand more about the
two modes.
Calc has two modes of editing: Insert mode and Overwrite mode. In Insert
mode, the text is inserted at the location of the cursor, pushing existing text
to the right. In Overwrite mode, text overwrites other text that exists at the
location of the cursor. Insert mode is the default mode. You can toggle
between Insert mode and Overwrite mode by clicking the mode box in the
status bar (the bar at the bottom of your window). The box shows INSRT or
OVER; the latter is shown in Figure 8-2.
143
Chapter 8: Creating a Spreadsheet 

If INSRT or OVER is not displayed in the status bar, double-click a cell so that a
cursor appears. This causes either INSRT or OVER to appear in the status bar.
Deleting the contents of the active cell
To delete the contents of a cell, click the cell that you want to delete and
press Delete. The entire contents of the cell are deleted.
Filling cells automatically
Calc has a nifty feature for automatically inputting values. If you want to enter
numbers sequentially or in regular multiples (such as 2, 4, 6, 8, and so on) but
you don’t want to type each one individually, that’s no problem. Put Calc to
work for you.
To automatically input numbers sequentially into your spreadsheet, perform
the following steps:
1. Type the number that you want to begin with in the active cell.
For example, if you want your numbers to read 5, 6, 7, 8, and so on, type 5.
Figure 8-2:
The 
status bar
indicates
whether you
are in Insert
mode or
Overwrite
mode. The
latter is
shown here.
144
Part III: Using Calc - The Spreadsheet 

2. Return the active cell to the cell that contains your number.
Your active cell moved when you typed your number. Just press the
appropriate arrow key, or click the cell with the number that you just
typed.
3. Click and drag the small square in the lower-right corner of the active
cell pointer, as shown in Figure 8-3, and drag either up, down, or
across the cells.
Dragging up or to the left counts backward. Dragging down or to the right
counts forward. Your range is outlined in red, and a box appears showing the
value for the farthest cell. When you stop dragging, your numbers appear.
Once you have a row or column of numbers, you can select the numbers by
clicking in the top cell and dragging the mouse to the bottom cell. Selected
cells appear shaded. Once your numbers are selected, you can automatically
fill a whole table, if you want. Just pull on the Autofill tab of the active cell
and drag. Of course, few people really need a whole table of sequential num-
bers, but you may be the exception.
Your numbers can be in multiples instead of being sequential. To automati-
cally input numbers in multiples, perform the following steps:
1. In two adjacent cells, type the multiple that you want to use.
For example, type 5 in cell A1 and 10 in cell A2.
Figure 8-3:
The Autofill
tab is a
small
square that
is located in
the lower-
left corner
of the 
active cell. 
Clicking and
dragging the
square

sequential
numbers.
145
Chapter 8: Creating a Spreadsheet 

2. Select cells A1 and A2 by clicking cell A1 and dragging the mouse to
cell A2.
3. Click and drag the small square in the lower-right corner of the active
cell pointer.
4. Drag the mouse down over the rows.
When you release the mouse button, the multiples are entered into your
cells.
Moving and Grooving in the Grid
Spreadsheets can range in size from the smallest four-cell miniatures to gar-
gantuan, but friendly beasts. Fortunately, getting around even the biggest
spreadsheets is no problem. You can navigate with either the mouse or the
keyboard.
Scurrying around your
grid with your mouse
Mouse movements give you three navigation options:
 Dragging the scroll bars shows rows and columns that are out of view.
 Clicking and holding the arrow symbol on a scroll bar allows you to pro-
ceed line by line through rows or columns.
 Clicking and holding the space that’s adjacent to the arrow symbol on a
scroll bar allows you to proceed page by page through rows or columns.

Using your arrow keys to navigate through your document cell by cell gets you
around your document easily. But if your document is large, you need more
than just the arrow keys to reach your destination efficiently. Press the follow-
ing keys or key combinations to quickly navigate through your document:
 Page Up or Page Down: Pages through your document.
 Home: Moves the active cell pointer to the first column of a row.
 End: Moves the active cell pointer to the last column of a row.
 Ctrl+Backspace: Finds the active cell.
146
Part III: Using Calc - The Spreadsheet 

 Ctrl+arrow (Ctrl plus any arrow key): Zips around your spreadsheet.
If the active cell is in a table (and not the last entry in the direction that
you want to head), Calc moves to the last filled cell of the table in the
direction of the arrow. If the active cell is empty, Calc moves to the first
filled cell that it encounters in the direction of the arrow. If no more filled
cells exist in the direction of the arrow, Calc moves the active cell to the
last (or first) cell of the spreadsheet. This is either row 32000 or row 1,
or column IV or column A.
If pressing Ctrl+arrow mysteriously stops you at an empty cell when you
expect it to take you to the beginning or end of a column or row, or to stop at
a cell with data, the cell where it stopped may look empty but actually con-
tain unseen blank spaces or other invisible items. You can clear the cell by
pressing Delete.
Managing Columns and Rows
When you create a new spreadsheet, Calc assigns each column a standard
width of about 9⁄10 of an inch (on our monitor, anyway). But, needless to say,
your data does not always conform to those dimensions. Some columns may
contain lots of text. Other columns may have only a single digit in them. Calc
allows you to easily change the widths of your columns and even change the
heights of your rows.
Also, creating a spreadsheet can be a very organic process: One column or
row may need to grow into three or five — like the trunk of a tree becoming
branches and twigs. You’ll no doubt want to add or even prune some rows or
columns.
Changing column widths and row heights
To change column widths and row heights using the mouse, perform the fol-
lowing steps:
1. Click the line that separates two column names or row names, as
shown in Figure 8-4. Choose the line that is to the right of the column
that you want to resize (or below the row that you want to resize).
For example, the line between columns D and E resizes column D, and
the line between rows 3 and 4 resizes row 3. The mouse pointer changes
to a double-headed arrow.
2. While holding down the mouse button, drag the line to the desired
column width or row height.
147
Chapter 8: Creating a Spreadsheet 

We know a quick mouse method for changing column widths and row
heights. We give it two thumbs up! Double-click the line separating the two
column names or row names that is to the right of the column that you want
to resize (or below the row that you want to resize), as shown in Figure 8-4.
Calc optimizes the column width or row height according to the data that’s
currently in that column or row.
To change column widths and row heights using the main menu, follow these
steps:
1. Click a cell in the column or row that you want to resize.
2. Choose Format➪Column➪Width to open the Column Width dialog box.
Or choose Format➪Row➪Height to open the Row Height dialog box.
3. Enter the desired size of your column or row.
4. Click OK.
Make sure that you like the new column or row size.
To change column widths and row heights using a faster main menu method,
perform the following steps:
1. Click a cell in the column or row that you want to resize.

148
Part III: Using Calc - The Spreadsheet 

2. Choose Format➪Column➪Optimal Width, or choose Format➪Row➪
Height.
Calc optimizes the column width or row height according to the data
that’s currently in that column or row. 
Restoring column widths and row heights
Want to change the formatting of your columns or rows back to their default
dimensions? Just double-click the line that separates the two column names
or row names, as shown in Figure 8-3. Be sure that the line is to the right of
the column or below the row that you want to resize. Your column or row
resizes to the default size.
You can also perform the following steps to return your columns and rows to
their default sizes:
1. Place the active cell pointer in a cell in the column or row that you
want to restore to the default size.
2. Choose Format➪Column➪Width, or choose Format➪Row➪Height.
The Column Width dialog box or Row Height dialog box appears.
3. Select the Default Value check box.
4. Click OK.
Adding columns and rows
To add columns or rows in between other columns or rows, follow these steps:
1. Select a cell or a range of cells to the right of the column that you
want to add, or below the row that you want to add.
Calc inserts one row or column for each row or column that you
selected.
2. Choose Insert➪Column, or choose Insert➪Row. You can also click the
Insert Cells icon, which is the second icon from the top on the Main
toolbar.
A pop-up menu of icons appears.
3. Choose the Insert Column icon or the Insert Row icon. If the Main
toolbar is not visible, choose View➪Toolbars➪Main Toolbar to make it
appear.
Calc renames all the columns or rows so that they are still in alphabeti-
cal or numerical order.
149
Chapter 8: Creating a Spreadsheet 

Deleting columns and rows
Perhaps you want to prune a few twigs here and there. To delete columns or
rows, follow these steps:
1. Select at least one cell in each column or row that you want to delete.
2. Choose Edit➪Delete Cells to open the Delete Cells dialog box.
3. Select the Delete Entire Column(s) check box or the Delete Entire
Row(s) check box.
4. Click OK.
Calc then renames all the columns or rows as though the deleted rows
never existed.
Hiding columns and rows
Just for fun, try making a column or row disappear. Yes, this is possible. It is
formally known as hiding. This can be useful when you want to print different
versions of your spreadsheet for different clients, but you don’t want go to
the trouble of creating new tables.
To hide a column or row, follow these steps:
1. Click and drag the line that separates the two column or row names.
2. Drag the column or row line beyond the line of the preceding column
or row.
For example, click the line between rows H and I, and drag that line to
column C.
Your columns now read A, B, C, I, J, and so on. Don’t worry, Calc has not
devoured your columns. You can get them back whenever you want —
we hope. (Just kidding.)
You can also hide a column or row by following these steps:
1. Select the cells in the columns or rows that you want to hide.
2. Choose Format➪Column➪Hide, or choose Format➪Row➪Hide.
Hidden columns or rows are restored to the default size. If your rows or
columns are resized and you don’t want to resize them a second time, do not
hide them.
150
Part III: Using Calc - The Spreadsheet 

Restoring hidden columns and rows
Hidden columns or rows are easy to find.
 If spreadsheet column rows or numbers are missing, such as in the
sequence A, B, C, D, J, K, the missing rows or numbers are hidden.
 Calc highlights the line between two columns where hidden columns
exist.
 To restore hidden columns, use one of the following methods:
• Double-click slightly to the right of the highlighted line between the
two visible column names that surround the hidden columns.
• Select a group of cells on both sides of the hidden columns, and
choose Format➪Column➪Show.
For example, if columns D and E are hidden, select cells in column
C and column F and then choose Format➪Column➪Show.
 To restore hidden rows, use one of the following methods:
• Double-click slightly below the highlighted line between the two
visible row names that surround the hidden rows.
• Select a group of cells on both sides of the hidden rows, and then
choose Format➪Row➪Show.
For example, if rows 12 and 13 are hidden, select cells in row 11
and row 14 and then choose Format➪Column➪Show.
If your double-headed arrow is centered directly on the line and not slightly
off center to the right for columns or below for rows, you could double-click
forever and not see those hidden columns or rows. (Gulp!)
1. Select at least two cells, one in each adjacent column or row of the
hidden columns or rows.
For example, if columns D through F are hidden, select cells C1 and G1.
2. Choose Format➪Column➪Show, or choose Format➪Row➪Show.
Crash! Boom! Quick, Save!
Now that you’ve created, formatted, and edited your spreadsheet, you proba-
bly want to save it as well. Saving is easy in Calc.
151
Chapter 8: Creating a Spreadsheet 

Choosing File➪Save opens the Save As dialog box the first time that you
choose this command. Type in a name for your file in the File name text box.
Be sure that the Automatic File Name Extension check box is selected. And
unless you are exporting your final data to Microsoft Excel, you probably
want the File type to be OpenOffice.org 1.0 Spreadsheet.
Does more than one person use your computer? Want to keep your spread-
sheet safe, secure, and secret? If so, select the Save with Password check box.
When you enter Save, a dialog box appears requesting you to enter a pass-
word twice. Be sure to remember this password, because the next time that
you open your spreadsheet, you will be asked for it.
Be sure to save frequently while using OpenOffice.org. You never know when
a bolt of lightning may strike or when a tennis ball may land on the on/off
switch of your surge protector. For faster saving, press Ctrl+S.
For those who just can’t remember to save (and have paid the price by losing
hours of work), Calc offers an AutoSave option. And why not always create a
backup copy of your spreadsheet, as well? Calc offers this option, too.
To activate the AutoSave and the backup options, perform the following
steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Options➪Load/Save➪General.
This opens the Options-Load/Save-General dialog box, as shown in
Figure 8-5.
2. To activate AutoSave, select the AutoSave Every check box and type
in or scroll to enter the appropriate AutoSave interval, in minutes.
Select the Prompt to Save check box if you want your computer to ask
you for permission to save each time.
Prompting can be annoying, but if you like to revert to a previous ver-
sion of your spreadsheet, prompting may be the ideal option for you.
3. To automatically save a backup copy every time you save your spread-
sheet, select the Always Create Backup Copy check box.
If some calamity occurs and you need to access this backup copy, you
can find it in a folder called backups. If you do not readily see this folder
on your computer, choose Tools➪Options➪OpenOffice.org➪Paths. Then
search for Backups in the list of paths to see where your Backups folder
is located.
4. Click OK.

At Home on the Range
In This Chapter
 Selecting ranges
 Dragging and dropping
 Formatting numbers and adding styles
 Understanding the ins and outs of sheets
S
preadsheets are famous for having beautiful columns of numbers — all
with two decimal places and maybe some with dollar signs or other cur-
rency signs. Spreadsheets often have nice-looking titles and column headings
where the text may be enlarged or in boldface. How do we get the look we
want? We format.
To format large ranges of cells, you need to know how to readily select
the ranges. Once you select your range, you can manipulate all those cells
in one fell swoop. Whether you want to drag and drop, format, or make other
changes, knowing the ways to select your cells is important. And, because
your ranges may not just be on a single sheet but may span many sheets, we
discuss how to select sheets and provide a basic understanding of sheets as
well in this chapter.
Selecting Your Cells
Suppose that you want to edit large groups of data at the same time. You may
also want to delete the contents of many cells all at once. Calc allows you to
select large blocks of cells and move them around your spreadsheet — or
format them in different ways. You can apply formulas to selected cells. You
can even select several blocks of cells at the same time. For faster selection,
try using the keyboard method of selecting cells. Two keystrokes can select
even the largest table of data.

Selecting a range of cells
Calc allows you to select cells in a variety of ways. To select a range of cells
using the mouse, follow these steps:
1. Click one of the four corner cells of the range that you want to select.
2. Hold the mouse button down, and drag the mouse to the diagonal
corner cell of the range.
The cells that are selected appear shaded, as shown in Figure 9-1.
Do not drag the active cell from its lower-right corner. This is the Autofill
handle, and cells that are selected when you release the mouse are autofilled
with new data.
To select a range of cells using the keyboard, follow these steps:
1. Position your active cell pointer at a corner of a range of cells that
you want to select.
2. Press and hold Shift while moving the arrow keys in the directions of
the cells that you want to select.
The selected cells appear shaded, as shown in Figure 9-1.
Selecting a large range of cells
When your spreadsheet is quite large, clicking and dragging the mouse or
using arrow keys while pressing Shift to select cells is not practical.
(Remember, you could have a 40-story-high spreadsheet.)
Figure 9-1:
Calc offers 
a variety 
of ways 
to select
your range.
Choose the
one that fits
your mood.
156
Part III: Using Calc — The Spreadsheet 

To select a large range of cells while using the mouse, follow these steps:
1. Click one of the four corner cells of the range that you want to select.
2. Click the box in the status bar until the box displays EXT. The box may
display ADD, or it may show STD (as shown in Figure 9-1).
3. Use the scroll bars to locate the opposite diagonal corner of the range
of cells that you want to select, and click it.
Calc selects the range.
To select a large range of cells using the keyboard, follow these steps:
1. Position your active cell pointer at the upper-left corner of a range of
cells that you want to select.
2. Press Shift+Ctrl+→. This automatically selects all cells in the first row
up to the first empty cell.
3. Press Shift+Ctrl+↓.
This automatically selects all the rows of your table down to the first
empty cell in the last column.
To select a large range of cells with the keyboard using a different method,
follow these steps:
1. Locate the sheet area to the right of the input line.
2. Type in the cell addresses of two diagonal corners of the range of
cells that you want to select.
A colon must separate the two addresses. Addresses may also refer to
sheets. Calc allows you to select cells in more than one sheet at a time.
Selecting noncontiguous ranges of cells
To select a noncontiguous range of cells using the mouse, follow these steps:
1. Click the box in the status bar until it displays ADD.
2. Click and drag to select a block of cells.
3. Repeat the preceding step to select as many noncontiguous cells as
you want.
If you select a cell that has already been selected, this method deselects
that cell.
Using the ADD feature, you can easily select any cells you want in any
arrangement you desire — even the checkerboard pattern that’s shown in
Figure 9-2.
157
Chapter 9: At Home on the Range

To select a noncontiguous range of cells using both the keyboard and the
mouse (a hybrid method), follow these steps:
1. Click the active cell, hold down the mouse button, and drag the active
cell.
2. Press Ctrl while repeating the preceding step.
Selecting one row or column,
or many, or all of them
To select a single row or column, click the row number or column name.
To select several rows or columns, follow these steps:
1. Click the first row or column that you want to select.
2. Press and hold Shift, and click the last row or column that you want to
select.
To select the entire active sheet, choose Edit➪Select All or press Ctrl+A. You
can also click the square at the upper-left corner of your sheet, which is the
junction of both the column names and row names.

Copying, Pasting, Cutting, Dragging,
and Dropping Your Cells
Now that you have your cells selected, it’s child’s play to cut and paste them,
drag and drop them, and move them all around.
Copying and pasting cells
To copy and paste a range of cells, follow these steps:
1. Select the range of cells that you want to copy.
2. If the Function toolbar is not visible, choose View➪Toolbars➪
Function Bar to make it appear.
3. Choose Edit➪Copy, press Ctrl+C, or click the Copy icon on the
Function toolbar.
4. Click the cell that you want to paste the upper-left corner of your
range into.
5. Choose Edit➪Paste, press Ctrl+V, or click the Paste icon on the
Function toolbar.
Cutting and pasting cells
To cut and paste a range of cells, follow these steps:
1. Select the range of cells that you want to copy.
2. Choose Edit➪Cut, press Ctrl+X, or click the Cut icon on the Function
toolbar. (If the Function toolbar is not visible, choose View➪Toolbars➪
Function Bar to make it appear.)
3. Click the cell that you want to paste the upper-left corner of your
range into.
4. Choose Edit➪Paste, press Ctrl+V, or click the Paste icon on the
Function toolbar.
Dragging and dropping cells
You may find this is the most enjoyable way to cut and paste. Once you know
how to drag and drop, you may want to do nothing else.
159
Chapter 9: At Home on the Range

1. Click the box in the status bar until the box displays STD.
Dragging and dropping can only be performed with single cells or stan-
dard rectangular ranges.
2. Click and drag the active cell to create a selected range.
3. Click anywhere in the selected area, and drag the entire range to a
new location.
Formatting Your Numbers and Text
One of the first things that you probably want to do when you create
your spreadsheet is to format your numbers. Your numbers may be quanti-
ties, dollars, or percentages. If they are dollars, you may want to see the
dollar signs — or maybe you don’t — but you probably don’t want to see
more than two numbers after the decimal points. A tenth of a penny just clut-
ters your beautiful spreadsheet. Calc’s formatting abilities are as impressive
as they are easy to use.
You can format your numbers in two ways: using the toolbar or using the Cell
Attributes dialog box.
Formatting numbers with the toolbar
Locate the toolbar that is shown in Figure 9-3. This toolbar, called the Object
toolbar, appears just above the input line in your window. If the Object tool-
bar is not visible, choose View➪Toolbars➪Object Bar to make it appear.
To format numbers with the toolbar, follow these steps:
1. Select the cell or range of cells that you want to format. To format
more than one cell, select several cells (a range of cells) by placing
the mouse pointer in the center of the active cell and clicking and
dragging the mouse.
The selected cells appear shaded.
2. Click the icon of the formatting style that you want to use, as follows:
• Currency icon: Shows your numbers with dollar signs and two
decimal places. This format is commonly used on the top row of a
table and in the Total rows. Dollar signs throughout an entire table
may just look messy.
160
Part III: Using Calc — The Spreadsheet 

• Percentage icon: Places a percentage sign after your number,
along with two decimal places. If you do not want the decimal
places, you can omit them by clicking twice on the Number
Format:Delete Decimal Place icon (three icons to the right).
• Number Format:Standard icon: If you goof using the other formats
and want things to look the way that they did from the start, use
this icon to return the cell to the standard format. This is impor-
tant because simply deleting data does not delete the underlying
format of the cell. This icon must be used to eliminate a format
from a cell.
• Add Decimal Place icon: Adds an additional decimal place for
each click of the mouse button. To format currency without cur-
rency signs, click twice to add two decimal places to your number.
• Delete Decimal Place icon: Deletes a decimal place for each click
of the mouse button.
• Decrease Indent icon: Allows you to line up your numbers with
your text. Remember, Calc left-justifies text in the cell and right-
justifies numbers. If you don’t want that crooked look in your
columns, you need to either left-justify your numbers or right-justify
your text. Or you could choose a happy medium. This may sound
fishy, but it does not change your numbers’ ability to act as 
numbers.
• Increase Indent icon: Allows you to properly line up data in a
column.
Figure 9-3:
Calc’s
Object
toolbar.
161
Chapter 9: At Home on the Range

Once you format your numbers, any subsequent change of the data in that
cell also reflects that same format. Even if you delete the contents of the cell,
the next time that you enter data into the cell, the same format will appear.
To return a cell to its original format, you must select the cell and click the
Number Format:Standard icon.
Adding style with the toolbar
Want to change your font type, size, and style right from the toolbar? Calc
makes it easy to format text. To choose your font type, size, and style, follow
these steps:
1. Click the cell that you want to format. Or, select a range of cells —
you can do this by clicking the active cell and dragging.
The selected cells appear shaded.
2. Select your font from the list of fonts in the combo box on the Object
toolbar. If the fonts combo box is not visible, choose View➪Toolbars➪
Object bar to make it appear.
3. Select the size of your type from the combo box on the Object toolbar.
Calc resizes the rows to accommodate the larger or smaller sizes of type.
4. Choose your style.
Choose either boldface, italic, or underline, or choose the color for your
type.
5. Deselect your cells, which you can do by simply moving your active
cell. If moving your active cell does not deselect your cells, click the
box on the status bar until the box displays STD. Then try moving your
active cell again.
Your change occurs automatically once you deselect your cells.
Formatting using the Cell
Attributes dialog box
The Cell Attributes dialog box can do everything that the toolbar can do —
and more. For example, if you are from Finland and your spreadsheet is show-
ing the American dollar sign, this is probably not what you want. Or, suppose
that you are a scientist, and you need to view your numbers in scientific nota-
tion. What if you just want to know what day of the week that you were born
on? The Cell Attributes dialog box, shown in Figure 9-4, can do all that and
more.
162
Part III: Using Calc — The Spreadsheet 

Choosing scientific notation or what day were you born
To open the Cell Attributes dialog box, follow these steps:
1. Select the cell or range of cells that you want to format.
2. Choose Format➪Cells or right-click anywhere in the selected area,
and choose Format Cells from the shortcut menu that appears.
3. Click the Numbers tab.
4. Choose All from the Category list.
5. To view the formats, scroll through the Format list.
6. Click the format that suits your needs. For scientific notation, click
one of the numbers with the E in the middle of it. (If you’re a scientist,
you’ll recognize it.) And, more importantly, to find out what day you
were born on, click Friday, December 31, 1999.
7. Click OK.
8. Type in your birthday to test your new format.
For example, type 6/12/71, and Calc automatically displays Saturday,
June 12, 1971. Maybe you will find, like we did, that your whole family
was born on the same day of the week!
Figure 9-4:
The Cell
Attributes
dialog box
offers more
formatting
options than
the Object
toolbar, such
as scientific
notation and
many date
and time
options. It
can even tell
you what
day of the
week you
were 
born on.
163
Chapter 9: At Home on the Range

You may be disappointed to see that instead of your birthday, the symbol
### may appear. Don’t fret. Calc is just informing you that it cannot fit every-
thing it needs to display in your narrow column. Just make your column
wider to see everything. To make your column wider, click and drag the line
between two column headings. For example, if your formatted cell is in
column B, drag the line between heading B and heading C.
Getting the right look for your money
Another great function of the Cell Attributes dialog box is its ability to change
currency signs.
Want to use the Dutch guilder? Or Euros instead of boring dollars? If you live in
beautiful Holland or elsewhere in Europe, you probably want to do that. And
while you’re at it, you probably don’t want to read English dates if you are
Russian or Norwegian, or if you speak Spanish. Fortunately Calc allows you to
choose from a wide array of currencies and languages. Follow these steps:
1. Select the cell or range of cells that you want to format.
2. Choose Format➪Cells.
3. In the Cell Attributes dialog box, click the Numbers tab.
4. Choose your language from the Language combo box.
5. Choose All from the Category list.
6. Scroll through the Format list, and choose your currency format.
The correct currency symbols automatically appear in the list.
You can also choose a date format. Notice that even your Boolean values
(TRUE or FALSE) have also been translated.
To AutoCorrect or not to AutoCorrect
As you type your text into the cells of your active sheet, you may notice that
once you move to the next cell, the text that you typed may change. Perhaps
the first letter suddenly becomes capitalized. Or perhaps you typed abotu
and Calc changed it to about.
Hopefully, Calc is changing things to your liking. But if abotu is the name of a
Brazilian butterfly and you do not want it changed, or if you are in a particu-
larly touchy mood and you feel like your computer is criticizing you, you may
want to modify the options of AutoCorrect.
Turning off automatic capitalization
Some options you probably want to keep, for example, COrrect TWo INitial
CApitals. But other options, such as Capitalize the first letter of every 
164
Part III: Using Calc — The Spreadsheet 

sentence, may drive you batty. The problem is that many words that you type
into your spreadsheet are not sentences, but data items. And you may not
want all your data items capitalized.
To turn off automatic capitalization, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪AutoCorrect to open the AutoCorrect dialog box, as
shown in Figure 9-5.
2. Click the Options tab.
A list of options appears.
3. To change any option, select or deselect the appropriate check box.
4. Deselect the Capitalize first letter of every sentence check box.
Adding a shortcut or common misspelling to the replacement table
While you have the AutoCorrect dialog box open, select the Replace tab and
glance at the replacement table. Or, perform Steps 1 and 2 of the following
instructions to make this tab visible.
Figure 9-5:
The
AutoCorrect
dialog box

Chapter 9: At Home on the Range

The replacement table is not just for misspellings. In fact, the first entry in
the list is an easy way of getting the copyright symbol. In your spreadsheet,
you can simply type (C) and the copyright symbol © appears automatically.
Another use for this table is to create shortcuts. Suppose that you need to
type the word supermarket many times in a spreadsheet. You can create a
shortcut for it by typing su.
To add to the replacement table, follow these steps:
1. To open the replacement table, choose Tools➪AutoCorrect.
The AutoCorrect dialog box appears.
2. Click the Replace tab.
Glance at the replacement table, as shown in Figure 9-6. See how com-
monly misspelled words are listed in the list box on the left and their
correct spellings in the list box on the right.
3. If the replacement list is empty, choose English (USA) from the
combo box.
A replacement table appears that contains many common misspellings.
Other languages may need to be entered manually.

166
Part III: Using Calc — The Spreadsheet 

4. Type your new commonly misspelled word or shortcut into the
Replace text box.
If a term is already in that box, just select the term and delete it. (This
does not delete it from the replacement list.)
5. Type the text that you want to use as the replacement into the With
text box.
6. Click the New button to enter your words into the replacement list.
If the New button is unavailable, your new shortcut or common mis-
spelling is probably already in the replacement list. When this happens,
the term’s replacement is automatically entered into the With text box.
To replace the term, type your new replacement into the With text box
and click the Replace button.
Want to play a practical joke? Type the in the Replace box, and type turtle in
the With box. Click the New button, and then click OK. Then let someone use
your program. Every time he or she types the, the computer automatically
changes it to turtle. Pretty funny? Maybe not, but you didn’t learn it from us.
Deleting items from the replacement table
If your name happens to be a commonly misspelled word, or if you just
played a practical joke on someone and now need to fix it, you may want to
delete items from the replacement table, which you can do by performing
these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪AutoCorrect, and click the Replace tab in the
AutoCorrect dialog box.
2. Select the item that you want to delete from the table. Or, just type the
item into the Replace box, and AutoCorrect selects it for you.
3. Click the Delete button.
Clicking the Reset button (instead of the Delete button) does not delete
your additions to the replacement table; it only erases your current entry.
Spell-checking
If you are like we are, you may make lots of spelling mistakes. You appreciate
a subtle hint from the computer that something may be awry. A simple red
underline of a misspelled word is a nice feature. Of course, if your data con-
sists of text-like product codes instead of complete words, you may be seeing
lots of red.
To toggle the Automatic Spellchecking feature on or off, simply click the
Automatic Spellchecking icon on the Main toolbar, as shown in Figure 9-7.
You can also choose Tools➪Spellcheck➪AutoSpellcheck.
167
Chapter 9: At Home on the Range

You also have the option to spell-check the entire document with the help of
a dialog box and an automatic dictionary that suggests revisions. Just click
the Spellchecking icon on the Main toolbar or choose Tools➪Spellcheck➪
Check to open the Spellcheck dialog box.
Seeing Sheer Simplicity in Sheets
When you create your spreadsheet (also called a worksheet), Calc creates a
three-dimensional workbook that is a collection of stacked sheets. The sheets
are given default names of sheet1, sheet2, and sheet3, and tabs with the
names of each sheet are located near the lower-left corner of the spreadsheet
window. Click the appropriate tab, and a new spreadsheet appears.
The maximum number of sheets that Calc allows in a single workbook is 256.
You can add sheets, delete sheets, name sheets anything you like, and manip-
ulate sheets in a variety of ways. You can enter data into one sheet and have
the data simultaneously be entered into all the selected sheets. Knowing how
to use sheets can make life a breeze — instead of a tornado.

Adding sheets
When you use up the three sheets that Calc supplies in every new spread-
sheet document, you need to add some more.
To add a sheet, follow these steps:
1. Click a sheet name that is located either before or after where you
want to add new sheets.
Sheet names are located on tabs near the lower-left corner of the spread-
sheet window, as shown in Figure 9-8.
2. Choose Insert➪Sheet to open the Insert Sheet dialog box. You can also
right-click the sheet name and choose Insert from the shortcut menu
that appears.

3. Mark the box to position the new sheet(s) either before or after the
active sheet.
4. Indicate how many sheets you want to add.
You can also specify the name of a single sheet. (If you already have a
spreadsheet in another file that you want to insert into your workbook,
select the From File check box and type in the file address, or click
Browse and select your file.)
Scrolling through sheets
Once you have more than just three sheets in your workbook, some of the
sheet name tabs may be out of view. To scroll through your tabs, click the
arrow buttons that are to the left of the tabs. You can also display more tabs
at once by moving the vertical bar between the sheet names and the active
sheet scroll bar. Move the vertical bar to the right, making the scroll bar
shorter.
Entering data into more than
one sheet simultaneously
You can enter data into more than one sheet simultaneously when more than
one sheet is selected. Simply select more than one sheet at a time, as we
describe in the next section. Then type your data into any cell of the active
sheet. The data is recorded in the same place on all selected sheets.
Selecting sheets
Sheet names appear on tabs that are located near the lower-left corner of the
spreadsheet.
Selected sheet tabs appear white, and deselected sheet tabs are shaded, as
shown previously in Figure 9-8.
Selecting a single sheet
To select a single sheet, simply click its name, and that sheet becomes the
active sheet.
170
Part III: Using Calc — The Spreadsheet 

Selecting several sheets simultaneously
To select several sheets simultaneously, press and hold Ctrl while clicking
the name tab for each sheet that you want to select.
Each tab that you click appears white, indicating that it has been selected.
Selecting a large group of sheets
If you have lots of sheets and want to select many of them, follow these steps:
1. Click the first sheet name of a group of sheets that you want to select.
This becomes the active sheet.
2. Press and hold Shift, and click the last sheet name that you want to
select.
Calc selects all the sheets between the active sheet and the sheet name
that you Shift+click on.
Selecting all sheets
If you have lots of sheets and want to select them all, follow these steps:
1. Right-click any sheet name.
2. Choose Select All Sheets from the shortcut menu that appears.
Deselecting one sheet at a time
To deselect one sheet at a time, press Ctrl while clicking the sheet name that
you want to deselect.
Deselecting a large group of sheets
To deselect a large group of sheets, press and hold Shift while clicking the
last sheet that you want to remain selected. Calc keeps all sheets between
the active sheet and the sheet that you Shift+click selected, while deselecting
all other sheets.
171
Chapter 9: At Home on the Range

Deselecting all sheets except
the active sheet
To deselect all sheets except the active sheet, Shift+click the active
sheet name.
Renaming sheets
To rename sheets, follow these steps:
1. Select the sheet that you want to rename.
2. Choose Format➪Sheet➪Rename.
The Rename Sheet dialog box appears. You can also right-click any sheet
name tab and choose Rename from the shortcut menu that appears.
(If the Rename option does not appear on the Sheet menu or the short-
cut menu, you have more than one sheet selected. Calc can only rename
one sheet at a time. In this case, you need to first deselect all but the one
sheet that you want to rename.)
3. In the Rename Sheet dialog box, type in the new name and click OK.
Moving and copying sheets
To move sheets using the mouse, follow these steps:
1. Select the sheet name or names.
2. Drag the sheet or sheets to a new location within the sheet name tabs.
To copy sheets using the mouse, follow these steps:
1. Select the sheet name or names.
2. Ctrl+click and drag the copied sheet or sheets to a new location within
the sheet name tabs.
To move or copy sheets using the main menu, follow these steps:
1. Select the sheet name or names that you want to move or copy.
2. Choose Edit➪Move/Copy Sheet.
The Move/Copy Sheet dialog box appears.
172
Part III: Using Calc — The Spreadsheet 

3. In the Move/Copy dialog box, select the Copy check box to copy your
sheet(s). Deselect this check box to move your sheet rather than copy it.
4. Click the name of the sheet that you want to insert — either the origi-
nal sheet or its copy — and click OK.
Deleting sheets
To delete one or more sheets, follow these steps:
1. Select one or more sheets that you want to delete.
2. Choose Edit➪Delete Sheet.
A dialog box appears asking whether you are sure that you want to per-
manently delete the current sheet(s).
3. If you are sure that you want to delete those sheets that are selected,
click the Yes button.
When deleting sheets, Calc deletes all the sheets that are selected. Double-
check to make sure that only the sheets that you want to delete are selected.
Selected sheet tabs appear white, and deselected sheet tabs appear shaded.

ouldn’t it be convenient if all you needed to do was press a button
and your spreadsheet would print exactly how you wanted it? Calc
spreadsheets are easy to print, but you still need to learn some basics. Once
you do that, printing can be fast and fun.
Previewing Your Printout
Ready to print? The first thing that you want to do is preview your printout.
Even if your spreadsheet is Lilliputian, you still want to see what it looks like
before you print it.
To preview your spreadsheet before printing, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Page Preview.
Your window changes to show the first page of your printout.
2. To see each subsequent page, click the Next Page icon.
Look at your page carefully. The header probably says sheet1, unless you
specified otherwise. You probably want to change that to something more
relevant. And while you’re at it, you can automatically add the time and date
to your printout.

Once you get to the Page Preview window, you may find it difficult to return
to your spreadsheet. Ideally a Back to Spreadsheet button or a Spreadsheet
button would exist. The button that actually takes you to your spreadsheet is
labeled — oddly enough — Page Preview. Now you know. Every great pro-
gram has at least a few foibles.
Alternatively, you could choose File➪Page Preview to exit Page Preview.
Customizing Your Headers and Footers
You can customize your headers and footers, either from the Page Preview
window or from the main menu.
To customize your headers or footers, perform the following steps:
1. Choose Edit➪Headers & Footers. Or, if you are viewing a Page
Preview window, click the Page Format icon on the toolbar to the left
of the Page Preview button.
The Page Style Dialog Box appears.
2. Click the Header tab or Footer tab, depending on which one you want
to customize.
Several check boxes and margin settings appear.
3. Deselect the Header on check box or Footer on check box to suppress
the header or footer. Or, deselect the Same Content Left/Right check
box if you want a different header or footer for left pages and right
pages.
4. Click the Edit button.
The Header dialog box or Footer dialog box appears, as shown in Figure
10-1, depending on your choice in Step 2. The Header dialog box or
Footer dialog box contains three text boxes: Left Area, Center Area, and
Right Area. It also contains seven buttons.
5. Enter your text into any of the three text boxes, or select one of the
three text boxes by clicking in it so that a cursor appears. Then click
on one of the following buttons: File Name, Sheet Name, Page, Pages,
Date, or Time. These buttons are described as follows:
• The File Name button inserts your filename on each page in the
text area that you select.
• The Sheet Name button inserts Sheet1 as a heading on the pages
of your first sheet, Sheet2 on the pages of your second sheet, and
so on.
• The Page button inserts the page number on each page in the text
area that you select.
176
Part III: Using Calc — The Spreadsheet 

• The Pages button inserts the total number of pages on each page.
• The Date button inserts the current date on each page.
• The Time button inserts the current time on each page.
Perform Steps 6 through 8 to format any of the text in the three text
boxes.
6. Select the text that you want to format, and click the A button.
The Text Attributes dialog box appears.
7. Specify the font type, size, and style. You can even choose a color for
your text.
8. Click OK in the Text Attributes dialog box.
9. Click OK in the Header dialog box or Footer dialog box.
10. Click OK in the Page Style dialog box. Or, click the More button and
specify fancy backgrounds and borders for your printout.
11. Inspect your handiwork in the Page Preview window.
Does the page appear like you wanted it to?
Dealing with Page Breaks
When printing your spreadsheet, a major consideration is dealing with page
breaks. With a little manipulation, you can sometimes squeeze all your
Figure 10-1:
The Header
dialog box
allows you
to enter
what you
want to
appear at

page.
177
Chapter 10: Knock on Wood and Print!

columns or rows onto a single page. Or, you can break your pages at logical
points. A little preparation before printing can make all the difference.
The first thing to do is find out where Calc is planning to automatically place
the page breaks. You can view automatic page breaks by using Page Preview.
Previewing page breaks
To view the page breaks for the entire document — or at least several pages
at a time — perform the following steps:
1. Choose View➪Page Break Preview.
This shrinks the view so that your entire spreadsheet is visible. The
page breaks are clearly marked, as shown in Figure 10-2.
2. Choose View➪Page Break Preview again to deselect Page Break
Preview and return to normal mode.
The automatic page breaks are indicated on your spreadsheet as slightly
darkened lines between certain rows and columns. If these page breaks are
not suitable, apply the next set of instructions for inserting manual page
breaks. Or, you can resize your rows or columns to fit either inside or outside
the page breaks. Page breaks change according to the widths and heights of
your columns and rows.

allows you
to see your
entire

178
Part III: Using Calc — The Spreadsheet 

Inserting manual page breaks
To manually insert page breaks, follow these steps:
1. Place the active cell pointer either above your desired horizontal
page break or to the left of your desired vertical page break.
2. Choose Insert➪Manual Break➪Row Break, or choose Insert➪Manual
Break➪Column Break.
3. Repeat Steps 1 and 2 as necessary, and preview your page breaks
again to be sure that your desired result has been attained. Be nice;
save a tree.
Orienting your printout sideways
Suppose that your spreadsheet is wider than it is long. And, suppose that it
would fit into a single sheet of paper if it were oriented sideways. To orient
your printout sideways, follow these steps:
1. Choose Format➪Page.
The Page Style dialog box appears.
2. Click the Page tab.
The Paper Format and Margins settings appear, if they were not already
visible.
3. In the Paper format section, select Landscape Orientation.
Note that the Page Format width and height values adjust to their
proper sizes.
Scaling your printout
What if your spreadsheet is just too large, and nothing that you do can get it
to print onto a single piece of paper? Calc offers a solution for everything.
Just scale it down.
With a high-resolution printer and a magnifying glass, you’re all set.
To scale your printout, repeat the following steps until you like the look of
your printout:
1. Choose File➪Print Preview to enter the Print Preview mode (if you
are not already in Print Preview).
179
Chapter 10: Knock on Wood and Print!

2. Click the Page Format icon.
The Page Style dialog box appears.
3. Click the Sheet tab in the Page Style dialog box.
4. In the Scale section, select the Fit Printout on Number of Pages check
box.
5. Click the up or down arrows to assign the number of pages.
Try starting with 1. If you have a large spreadsheet, it’s good for a laugh.
6. Click OK.
Printing a Selection
Suppose that your spreadsheet is humongous and you only want to print
a small section of it. Calc makes this easy. To print a section — called a 
selection — follow these steps:
1. Select the range of cells that you want to print.
2. Choose File➪Print.
The Print dialog box appears.
3. In the Print Range section, select Selection.
If the Selection option button does not appear, you are probably in Page
Preview mode.
4. Click OK to start printing.
Printing or Suppressing Sheets
Calc prints all your nonempty sheets, unless you specify the sheets that you
want to print. To specify the sheets that you want to print, follow these steps:
1. Select the sheets that you want to print.
2. Choose File➪Print.
The Print dialog box appears.
3. Click the Options box.
The Print Options dialog box appears.
4. Select the Print Only Selected Sheets check box.
180
Part III: Using Calc — The Spreadsheet 

5. Click OK to return to the Print dialog box.
6. Click OK to start printing.
Printing the Grid — or Not
The majority of people who print spreadsheets consider the grid to be extra-
neous clutter. But you may be different. If you want to print the grid — and
why not the row and column headers, too? — follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Page Preview to enter the Page Preview mode.
2. Click the Page Format icon.
3. Click the Sheet tab.
4. In the Print panel, select the Grid check box.
5. To print the row and column headers, select the Column and Row
Headers check box.
6. Click OK, and look at your preview.
Are you sure you want that grid?
Expressing or Suppressing Those Doodles
Want to doodle all over your spreadsheet and still print a clean copy with no
trace of your artistic endeavor? To doodle all over your spreadsheet like we
did in Figure 10-3, follow these steps:
1. If the Main toolbar is not visible, choose View➪Toolbars➪Main
Toolbar.
2. Click the Show Draw Functions icon (on the Main toolbar in the left
column of the window).
3. Choose from the assortment of drawing tools, and have fun drawing
on your spreadsheet.
If you draw over a cell or cells, it does not affect any data that’s con-
tained within those cells.
To print your spreadsheet minus all the doodles, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Page Preview.
The window changes to the Page Preview window.
181
Chapter 10: Knock on Wood and Print!

2. Click the Page Format icon on the Object toolbar.
The Page Style dialog box appears.
3. Click the Sheet tab.
4. In the Print panel, deselect the Drawing Objects check box.
5. Click OK, and look at your preview.
It may have lost some pizzazz, but at least you still have a job.
Printing Formulas
If you are like we are, you end up putting lots of formulas in your spread-
sheet, but then you forget if the number you are looking at is a formula or an
entry. Normally, formulas are suppressed in a printout, but to keep things
straight, you can print your spreadsheet twice: first showing your numbers
as usual and then showing your formulas.
To print your formulas, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Page Preview.
The window changes to the Page Preview window.
2. Click the Page Format icon on the Object toolbar.
The Page Style dialog box appears.
3. Click the Sheet tab.

182
Part III: Using Calc — The Spreadsheet 

4. In the Print panel, select the Formulas check box.
5. Click OK, and look at your preview.
Formulas can sometimes be quite large. You may want to change your
column widths to accommodate them. See Chapter 9 for handy instructions
on changing column widths.
Printing Your Spreadsheet
Finally, you are ready to print. You have previewed your pages, and everything
looks great. And you’ve loaded your printer cartridge with a hypodermic
needle full of ink (and cleaned up the extra squirts that dripped on your key-
board, mouse, table, and floor). Follow these steps to print your spreadsheet:
1. Choose File➪Print.
The Print dialog box appears.
2. Select the printer that you are using. If your printer does not appear
on the drop-down list, you need to install the printer driver according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Click the Properties button to open the Properties of Your Printer
dialog box.
This dialog box varies among printers, but you can generally continue
with the next steps.
4. Choose your paper size (81⁄2×11 inches is standard U.S. letter size), ori-
entation (landscape is sideways, of course), and scale (normally 1).
5. Choose the pages that you want to print, or print all the pages.
Refer to the instructions in the section “Printing a Selection,” earlier in
this chapter, to print just a selection.
6. Click OK.
7. Hold your breath, cross your fingers, knock on wood, and listen for
that soothing sound of whirling gizmos that magically make numbers
and letters appear on paper right in front of your eyes.

aybe the next logical chapter for this spot is “Making Calculations.”
But all those formulas on plain-looking spreadsheets seem too dull. So,
first we discuss how to dress up those spreadsheets. This chapter covers the
AutoFormat feature as well as adding borders and backgrounds, freezing
column headings, splitting windows, adding your art, and more.
Just a few touches can make all the difference. It can set you apart from the
crowd by giving your spreadsheet that professional look it needs in today’s
highly competitive business world — and perhaps even get you that richly
deserved promotion.
Getting That Professional 
Look with AutoFormat
AutoFormat is a quick and easy method for beautifying your spreadsheet and
getting it the attention it deserves — even if it just includes your grocery list.
See Figure 11-1 for an example of a table that was created with the AutoFormat
feature. To AutoFormat your spreadsheet, follow these steps:

1. Select the cells that you want to AutoFormat.
Be sure that you select enough cells. AutoFormat does not appear on the
Format menu unless you select a range that’s at least three cells wide
and three cells high.
2. Choose Format➪AutoFormat.
The AutoFormat dialog box appears.
3. Choose your format type from the format list.
Calc shows an example of the format in the center of the dialog box.
Take a look at all the formats. Which do you like best? Our favorite is the
Yellow.
If your cells are specifically formatted in any way, you could be in danger
of losing those formats unless you tell AutoFormat not to change the 
formats.
4. To retain your formats, open the AutoFormat dialog box, click the
More button, and deselect the Number Format check box and Font
check box. You could also deselect the Autofit Width and Height
check box if you don’t want your columns and rows to change sizes.
5. Click OK, and view your new table.
Like it? If not, it’s easy to change.

Going Bananas with Backgrounds
and Borders
Some people like to buy flowers in arrangements. Others like to arrange their
own. If the AutoFormat feature does not provide precisely what you envi-
sioned for your tables, you can design your own look.
Adding background colors
We never work on a spreadsheet without changing the background color of
the table that we’re working on. Somehow a soft golden glow on the screen is
more soothing to the eyes than glaring white. To change the background
color of the table, follow these steps:
1. Select the cells of your table.
2. Click the Background Color icon, and select your color from the 
pop-up swatches.
Alternatively, you can follow these steps to change the background color of
the table:
1. Choose Format➪Cells.
The Cell Attributes dialog box appears.
2. Click the Background tab.
3. Select your color.
4. Click OK.
Choose a light shade for your background color so that you don’t have to
strain to see the numbers clearly. Or, choose a dark background and change
your font color to white or yellow — how about pink? Read on for more
details.
Choosing font colors
It’s no secret that black is not our favorite color, so we never display our
numbers in black. Of course, we don’t want them in red, either, but the world
is a rainbow of colors. It’s fun to explore. To change your font colors, follow
these steps:

188
Part III: Using Calc — The Spreadsheet 
1. Select the range of cells to be formatted.
2. Click the Font Color icon, and select your color from the pop-up
swatches.
Alternatively, you can follow these steps to change the font colors:
1. Choose Format➪Cells.
The Cell Attributes dialog box appears.
2. Click the Font tab.
3. Select your font color.
4. Click OK.
Adding borders and printable grids
Suppose that you want to border your table with dark lines, or you may want
grid lines in your tables, but nowhere else.
To add a black border or black grid lines to your table, perform the following
steps:
1. Select the range of cells to be bordered or gridded.
2. Click the Border icon, and select from the range of line arrangement
options.
To add a colored border or grid lines, follow these steps:
1. Select the range of cells to be bordered or gridded.
2. Choose Format➪Cells.
The Cell Attributes dialog box appears.
3. Click the Borders tab.
4. Select your line arrangement. Click the four boxes for a full grid
effect.
5. Choose the line type and color.
6. Select a shadow style, position, and color if you want.
7. Click OK.
Now that you have grid lines formatted on your table, you may want to do
away with them elsewhere on your screen, as shown in Figure 11-2. Or, you
could choose File➪Page Preview and preview your printout with no grid lines
except those that you formatted. If grid lines still appear everywhere in Page
Preview and you don’t want them to print, follow the instructions in the sec-
tion “Printing the Grid — or Not,” in Chapter 10.

189
Chapter 11: Snazzing Up Your Spreadsheet
Hiding or showing the screen grids
Want to change the color of the grid on your screen? Or do away with it alto-
gether? Or get it back if it’s already done away with? Follow these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Options.
The Options dialog box appears.
2. Click Spreadsheet from the list on the left side of the dialog box.
A drop-down menu appears.
3. Click the View button.
The Options-Spreadsheet-view dialog box appears.
You may be tempted to click the Grid button instead of the View button,
but restrain yourself. The Grid option only applies to printing the grid
and does not affect the viewing of the grid on-screen.
4. In the Visual aids panel, select the grid color from the combo box. You
can also deselect the Grid lines check box to make the grid disappear.
Select the check box to make the grid reappear.
Functional Fun
Another way to impress your boss — or just make your spreadsheet more
functional — is to split your windows and/or freeze your headings.
Figure 11-2:
You can
format
tables and
hide grid
lines to give
them your
own look.

Freezing column and row headings
Ever scroll down a very large spreadsheet and suddenly not know which
column pertains to what data, because your column headings scrolled off the
top of the screen? Or maybe it was your row headings that scrolled off to the
left. Calc can freeze those headings so that you never have that problem. And
it looks cool.
To freeze column or row headings, follow these steps:
1. Place your active cell in the row below the column headings that you
want to freeze and in the column to the right of the row headings that
you want to freeze.
If you don’t want to freeze your row headings, place your active cell in
column A.
2. Choose Window➪Freeze.
3. To unfreeze your headings, choose Window➪Freeze again to halt the
effect.
Splitting your window
Splitting your window is similar to freezing your headings, except Calc also
splits the scroll bars and allows you to see all columns and rows in each
window. You can use this feature to line up and compare data from different
tables. To split your windows, follow these steps:
1. Place your active cell in the row where you want to split your window
and in the column where you want the split to occur.
If you don’t want to split your columns, place your active cell in column A.
2. Choose Window➪Split.
Note that you now have more than one scroll bar on at least one side of
your window. And you can scroll through the entire sheet using either
adjacent scroll bar.
Typing data into a field on one side of the split automatically records in
the other side of the split. In other words, it is still just one sheet; you
just see it as if it were two.
3. To deactivate your split window, choose Window➪Split again.

Using floating frames
Want to work in more than one spreadsheet at a time? Use floating frames to
read in another spreadsheet and float it in a draggable window inside your
spreadsheet window, as shown in Figure 11-3. You can work inside your float-
ing frame just as you can work in your main window. Changes are saved to
the original file of the floating frame (if you want them to be) as well as to the
file of the main window.
To open a floating frame, follow these steps:
1. Place your active cell where you want your floating frame to appear.
2. Choose Insert➪Floating Frame.
The Floating Frame Properties dialog box appears.
3. Type in a name for your floating frame.
4. Click the Browse icon next to the contents line.
The Select File for Floating Frame browser window appears.
5. Browse through your files, and double-click the spreadsheet file, text
file, presentation file, or graphic that you want in your floating frame.
6. Click the Open button.
7. Click OK in the Floating Frame Properties dialog box.

To move your floating frame
To move your floating frame, follow these steps:
1. If the eight handles (green dots) on the perimeter of the floating
frame are not showing, move your pointer over the edge of the float-
ing frame so that the pointer sits just slightly outside of the floating
frame. Click once.
The handles should appear. If the handles don’t appear, try again, posi-
tioning the mouse either slightly closer to or farther from the outer
perimeter of the frame.
2. Now that the handles are showing, move your mouse over the perim-
eter (or just outside of the perimeter) so that the pointer changes to a
four-directional arrow symbol.
3. Drag the floating frame to its desired location.
To resize your floating frame
To resize your floating frame, follow these steps:
1. If the handles are not showing, move your pointer over the edge of
the floating frame so that the pointer sits slightly outside of the float-
ing frame. Click once.
The handles should appear. If the handles don’t appear, try again, posi-
tioning the mouse either slightly closer to or farther from the outer
perimeter of the frame.
2. Now that the handles are showing, click and drag on a handle of your
choice to resize your floating frame.
To save your floating frame
To save your floating frame, follow these steps:
1. Make any changes to your floating frame.
2. Choose File➪Save All.
This saves all your changes in every floating frame and your workbook.
If the Save All option does not appear in the File menu, choose Save.
Save All only appears when more than one window needs to be saved.

Making Terrific Text
You can make lots of nice effects with text. You can use the Object toolbar to
select your font type and size, and you can choose boldface, italic, under-
lined, or colored text. You can center your text horizontally or vertically
within its cell, indent it, or justify it to the left, right, top, or bottom. You can
give your cells borders or background color — all this can be done from the
Object toolbar. If the Object toolbar is not visible, choose View➪Toolbars➪
Object Bar.
You can also use styles in Calc. Just set up your styles. With one click, your
font type, font size, indentations, and so on are all formatted for you. You can
create different styles for different headings, titles, and data.
You can do even more things with your text. How about typing several lines
of text in one cell? Or you can get fancy with moving text, blinking text, or
upside-down text. With Calc, the sky’s the limit — almost.
Multiline text
Want to put a whole book into a single cell? With Calc, anything is possible.
You can add line breaks in two ways: automatically or manually.
To manually enter line breaks within a cell, follow these steps:
1. Type your text into a cell.
2. To insert a line break, press Ctrl+Enter.
The row enlarges to accommodate the extra line of text.
As far as we can tell, you can have as many line breaks as you want in a row.
To automatically enter line breaks within a cell, follow these steps:
1. Choose Format➪Cell.
The Cell Attributes dialog box appears.
2. Click the Alignment tab.
3. Select the Line Break check box.
4. If you want automatic hyphenation, select the Hyphenation Active
check box.
5. Click OK.

Slanted or upside-down text
Feeling like the whole world is topsy-turvy? Display how you feel with slanted
or upside-down text or numbers. To create slanted or upside-down text or
numbers, follow these steps:
1. Select the cell or range of cells that you want to format as slanted or
upside-down.
2. Choose Format➪Cell.
The Cell Attributes dialog box appears.
3. Click the Alignment tab.
4. Turn the wheel in the Degrees box to the alignment that you want,
type the number of degrees in the Degrees box, or use the arrow keys
in the Degrees box to scroll though the numbers.
5. To align upside-down text to the top of the box, open the Vertical list
box in the Text Alignment panel and choose Top.
Your upside-down text looks a bit better if you align it to the top of the
box, instead of the bottom, as shown in Figure 11-4.

6. Click OK.
7. Enter text into a cell, and press Enter.
Your text slants or flips — whatever you designated.
Ready for another practical joke? Select all the cells in the sheet and format
them for upside-down data. Then let a coworker use your spreadsheet.
Funny? Hopefully that coworker is not your boss.
Using OpenOffice.org Writer 
as an OLE object
OLE stands for object linking and embedding. One of the best features of
OpenOffice.org is how it can integrate all its various modules. With a click or
two of the mouse, you can have the writing program, the drawing program, or
the presentation program function embedded within your spreadsheet, as
shown in Figure 11-5.
It is especially useful to open the Writer program within OpenOffice.org’s Calc
program. You then have the power to fine-tune your text without the restric-
tions of dealing with cells. Suppose that you have several pages of charts and
you want text to appear above, below, and around them. By typing your text
into the Writer program and dragging the text to its precise location, you
have more power to fine-tune the look of your spreadsheet and your printout.
Figure 11-5:
Calc allows
Writer to be
inserted as
an OLE
object.

Follow these steps:
1. Choose Insert➪Object➪OLE Object.
The Insert OLE Object dialog box appears.
2. From the list of OLE objects, choose OpenOffice.org 1.0.1 Text.
A miniature text window appears.
3. Drag and resize the new text window as you want.
4. While the window is selected, you can type your text and access the
full menu items of OpenOffice.org’s Writer program.
5. To return to Calc, click outside of the text window.
The main menu returns to Calc. The text that you inserted is now free of
the text window and can be resized or dragged anywhere in Calc.
6. If you need to edit the text again, just double-click it.
The OpenOffice.org Writer window reappears.
If the OpenOffice.org Writer window does not appear, another object must be
on top of it. Simply move the other objects off of the text and double-click the
text again.
Adding the Art
Calc’s formulas and database abilities are fabulous, but its graphics are amaz-
ing. Why settle for ordinary spreadsheets when you can insert all kinds of
graphic aids into them? Import some animations, resize them, and drag them
wherever you want. Or, open a miniature drawing window and create your
drawings while in Calc. Just click outside the window; your drawings stay
within the spreadsheet and can be dragged and resized.
Your graphics only print if you choose the option to print them. So why not
check that now, and save yourself the trouble of having to remember it later?
To format your graphics to print, follow these steps:
1. Choose Format➪Page.
The Page Style dialog box appears.
2. Click the Sheet tab.
3. In the Print panel, select the Objects/Graphics check box.

Going in for the gallery
The gallery has lots of nifty stuff to check out. To use the gallery, follow these
steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Gallery.
The gallery appears.
2. Select 3D Effects, Backgrounds, Bullets, or Rulers.
3. Drag the art of your choice from the gallery to your active sheet.
If your gallery window covers your active sheet window completely,
resize the gallery window by clicking and dragging on the first gray bar
below the gallery items. The cursor changes to a double arrow with a
short perpendicular bar in the center.
4. Resize and position your gallery art, or make the art a background by
following the steps that are presented in the next section.
Importing your art
If levitating donuts and other items in the gallery are not your cup of tea, you
can import your own art. Follow these steps to import your art:
1. Choose Insert➪Graphics➪From File.
The Insert Graphics browser appears.
2. Browse through your files and select a file, or type in the address of
the graphic that you want to insert.
3. To specify a file type, click the File Type combo box and select a
format.
Your file can be one of the following formats: BMP (Windows bitmap), DXF
(AutoCAD Interchange), EMF (Enhanced Metafile), EPS (Encapsulated
Postscript), GIF, JPEG, MET (OS2 Metafile), PBM (Portable Bitmap), PCD
(Kodak), PCX (zsoft Paintbrush), PGM (Portable Graymap), PNG, PPM,
PSD, RAS, SGF, SVM, TGA, TIFF, WMF, XBM, or XPM.
4. Click the Open button, and your graphic appears in the spreadsheet.
Resizing your graphic
Several dots appear around the edges of each graphic. These dots are called
handles. To resize your graphic, follow these steps:

198
Part III: Using Calc — The Spreadsheet 
1. Place your pointer on a handle.
A double-headed arrow symbol appears.
2. Click and drag the handle to the new size.
Moving your graphic
To position your graphic, simply click anywhere within your graphic and
drag it to a new location.
Creating a background with a graphic
Want to use that great picture of yours as a background for your table, like
the one that’s shown in Figure 11-6? To create a background with a graphic,
follow these steps:
1. Import your graphic into your spreadsheet.
2. Resize the graphic, and position it where you want it to become the
background.
3. Choose Format➪Arrange➪To Background.
Your grid lines should appear, if they are visible in your spreadsheet, as
should any data that was beneath your graphic.
Figure 11-6:
Add
backgrounds
to tables to
emphasize
your
statement.

199
Chapter 11: Snazzing Up Your Spreadsheet
At the time of this writing, background graphics cannot be modified or
deleted from a spreadsheet easily. To modify or delete your graphic, select
and copy all the cells in your sheet. Then open another sheet, and paste your
data there. When you do this, your graphics are not pasted. If you have a lot
of graphics in your spreadsheet that are not background images, select and
copy them and paste them into your new sheet.
Drawing your own masterpieces
Calc gives you the ability to open the drawing program within your spread-
sheet and draw whatever you need to make your point — even doodle, if you
want. You can draw in Calc by using the draggable Draw Functions toolbar or
by inserting the drawing program as an OLE object.
Using the Draw Functions floating toolbar
To draw in Calc by using the Draw Functions toolbar, follow these steps:
1. Click the Show Draw Functions icon on the Main toolbar to open the
Draw Functions floating toolbar.
2. Click the top bar of the Draw Functions toolbar, and drag the toolbar
anywhere — or you can leave it where it is.
3. Click a drawing function icon, such as a rectangle, and draw, just as
you would in the drawing program.
For a more powerful drawing program, you can use OpenOffice.org Draw as
an OLE object. Refer to the section “Using OpenOffice.org Draw as an OLE
object,” later in this chapter, for more details.
Creating callouts
Callouts are a particularly useful tool in a spreadsheet. They can point to
cells in a table and describe the data in more detail. And because your
spreadsheet may change in size and shape, you undoubtedly want to anchor
your callouts to cells. Follow these steps:
1. Click the Show Draw Functions icon on the Main toolbar to open the
Draw Functions floating toolbar.
2. Click the Callouts icon.
3. Click and drag, starting from the beginning of the callout and ending
where you want the box to be located.
4. Adjust the size of the box by clicking and dragging the handles on
the box.
5. Double-click inside the box, and insert your text.
Calc automatically anchors the callout to the cell.

200
Part III: Using Calc — The Spreadsheet 
Repositioning your callout
To reposition your callout to refer to another cell, click and drag on the
handle of the callout.
To move the callout box, click and drag on the callout box. The handle of the
callout remains positioned in the cell while you drag the box.
Anchoring your art
Sometimes you want your art to refer to a cell, such as a callout. Other times,
you may want it to show near the top of each page or be positioned on a page
regardless of how you manipulate the data in your tables.
To anchor your art, follow these steps:
1. Click your art to select it.
Backgrounds cannot be selected in this manner.
2. Right-click your art, and choose Anchor from the shortcut menu that
appears.
3. Click Page if you want your art to remain where it currently is on the
page. Or, choose Cell if you want it to move accordingly when rows or
columns are added.
Using OpenOffice.org Draw as an OLE object
The fully operable OpenOffice.org Draw program can be used in a mini-
window within a Calc spreadsheet, just as OpenOffice.org Writer can. Follow
these steps:
1. Choose Insert➪Object➪OLE Object.
2. From the list of OLE objects, choose OpenOffice.org 1.0.1 Draw.
A miniature Draw window, which can be dragged and resized, appears.
3. Use the drawing toolbars to draw to your heart’s content.
4. When you are finished, click outside of the Draw window.
The menus and toolbars change to Calc, and the drawing window disap-
pears. Only the drawing remains in your spreadsheet.
5. You can now resize and drag your drawing anywhere in Calc.
6. To edit your art, just double-click it.
The OpenOffice.org Draw window reappears.
If the OpenOffice.org Draw window does not appear, another object must be
on top of it. Simply move the other objects off of the drawing and double-
click the drawing again.

ow it’s time to explore the deep power of Calc. Calc takes you far
beyond addition and subtraction. Its ready-made functions span a
whole range of statistics, business, mathematics, and computing. And you
can combine functions with such speed and diversity that Calc rivals power-
ful programming languages — and it’s easy.
Formula Basics
Formulas are found in almost every spreadsheet. Some spreadsheets use for-
mulas just to generate totals. Other spreadsheets use formulas more often,
such as for subtracting cost of goods sold from sales to generate net income,
and for multiplying net income by the tax rate to roughly calculate taxes.
Other spreadsheets, like the mortgage tables that are shown in Figure 12-3,
are almost entirely generated by formulas.
Calc begins each formula with an equal sign. Creating a formula can be as
simple as typing =1+1. Formulas can contain numbers, or they can refer to
cell addresses. For instance, the formula =1+1 returns the same value, 2, as
the formula =A1+A2 if cells A1 and A2 both contain the number 1.
When you type in a formula and press Enter, the formula seems to disappear.
What you see is the value that the formula generates. Even though the for-
mula seems to disappear, Calc remembers it. You can see the formula in the
input line of the Formula toolbar. To edit your formula, you do so from the
input line when the cell is selected. Or, you can double-click the cell, and the
value changes to the formula.

Formulas can also be ready-made functions. The AutoPilot:Functions dialog
box lists 365 different functions (if I counted correctly) in ten different cate-
gories, such as Financial, Statistical, Mathematical, and Date&Time. These
functions offer a wide range of applications. You can create your own mort-
gage tables, calculate standard deviations, manipulate text, and manipulate
data in a variety of ways. You can even find out the date of Easter Sunday in
the year 5032! (It’s always good to plan ahead.)
Then when you start putting formulas together to create more complex for-
mulas, the sky is the limit. Calc offers an infinite range of possibilities.
Adding, Subtracting, and More
Learning to add and subtract is the core of your mastery of the formulas and
functions of Calc. The basic skills that are necessary to unleash the awesome
power of Calc can be learned from the ins and outs of simple addition.
Adding and other arithmetic
Basic addition and subtraction can be performed in a cell simply by typing
=4+6+9+7+3–2–5+1 and so on.
Multiplication and division are not much different, although you can incorpo-
rate parentheses into your equation. An example would be to type
=(2+(5*3)–4)/2. Nesting parentheses is fine. You can make your formula as
short or as long as you want.
You can mix and match cell addresses with numbers. For example, you can
enter the formula =C3/(2*D6). Calc easily distinguishes between numbers
and cell addresses.
If ### appears in your cell instead of your expected value, you need to make
the column wider. Calc needs more space to enter the value.
Adding with the Sum function
When adding a long column of numbers, it can be tedious to type each cell
address followed by a plus sign, so Calc provides the Sum function. This func-
tion can be used in two ways: by using its icon on the Formula toolbar or by
typing the function into a cell.
202
Part III: Using Calc — The Spreadsheet 

203
Chapter 12: Making Calculations
Using the Sum icon
To add or subtract using the Summation icon, perform these steps:
1. If the Formula toolbar is not visible, choose View➪Toolbars➪Formula
to make it appear.
The Formula toolbar is shown in Figure 12-1. The toolbar contains the
following items:
• The sheet area combo box: This box displays the addresses of
selected cell(s) and stores any ranges that you name.
• The input line: This line shows the formula that resides in the
active cell, if there is one; otherwise it displays the value.
• Three icons — AutoPilot:Functions, Sum (which looks like a
crooked E), and Function (=): The AutoPilot:Functions icon and
Sum icon are discussed in the next section of this chapter. The
Functions icon just types an equal sign.
2. Place your active cell in an empty cell where you want your total to
appear.
3. Click the Sum icon.
A blue box appears bordering the cells that Calc guesses that you want
to add. For instance, if your active cell is below a column of numbers,
the blue box borders the column of numbers.
Figure 12-1:
Keep your
Formula
toolbar
visible while
working
with
formulas.

204
Part III: Using Calc — The Spreadsheet 
Also, the formula is visible in your active cell. All formulas begin with an
equal sign followed by the formula type — in this case, SUM. Then the
range of cells is listed in parentheses.
4. If Calc has not guessed correctly and the blue box does not border
any or all of the cells that you want to add, place your cursor over the
box so that the cursor changes to a pointing hand (not a plus sign).
Click and drag the blue box to the first value that you want to include
in your sum.
Don’t worry if your box extends downward and you want to sum rows
(across) instead. Changing the shape of the box is discussed in the next
step.
5. Click and drag the tiny square at the lower-right corner of the blue
box over the cells that you want to add.
Your cursor changes to a plus sign (+) as you position it over the tiny
square. As you drag, the box expands or contracts to border the range
of cells that you desire.
Be sure that the range of the blue box does not include the active cell. If
it does, it means that you are trying to use your sum as a value in your
sum. This is known as a circular reference. Just like everyone else, com-
puters don’t like to go around in circles. In this case, Calc gives you an
error message.
6. Press Enter.
Your sum appears in the active cell.
#REF! appearing in your active cell instead of your total indicates that Calc
found some invalid data that it could not add. Calc ignores text and empty
cells, but it does not always ignore formulas. If #REF appears, look for an
invalid formula in the summation range. Then delete or move the invalid for-
mula. Let’s keep Calc happy.
Canceling the Sum icon
If you are in the middle of creating a sum and decide to cancel it, just click
the red X icon on the Formula toolbar. This icon only shows when you are in
the middle of creating a sum. Clicking the icon causes the blue summation
rectangle to vanish, and the formula disappears from the active cell.
If you have already finished creating a sum and want to delete it, click the cell
that the total is in and press Backspace. Poof! The sum vanishes.
Entering the Sum function manually
Some people like things automated, and some don’t. Calc caters to both
predilections. If you would rather just type in the formula and not have to
pull on tiny blue squares and resize rectangles, you can do that. (This is the

205
Chapter 12: Making Calculations
method that we prefer.) (We got off on the wrong foot with that blue square
and hard-heartedly have never forgiven it.) To enter the Sum function manu-
ally, follow these steps:
1. Click in the cell where you want your total to appear and perform the
following steps:
1. Type =Sum(
2. Type A1:A5 (the range of cells that you want to add)
3. Type )
2. Press Return.
Your formula disappears from the cell (but not the input line), and in its
place is the total.
Rocketing into Orbit with Functions
Now it’s time to blast off and really have fun. Don’t worry about the ins and
outs of the laws of aerodynamics; your AutoPilot takes care of everything.
Walking on the moon is no less stunning than the heights to which Calc can
take you.
Using the AutoPilot:Functions dialog box
The AutoPilot:Functions dialog box, shown in Figure 12-2, has scads of formu-
las to choose from. And all of them are infinitely useful. The formulas cover
the following topics:
 Database
 Date&Time
 Financial
 Information
 Logical
 Mathematical
 Array
 Statistical
 Spreadsheet
 Text

We count 365 functions in all. One for each day of the year? Plus, you can add
functions as well. Combinations and permutations of these functions provide
Calc with a scope of computational abilities that is almost unlimited.
To use a function from the AutoPilot:Functions dialog box, perform the fol-
lowing steps:
1. Select a cell that does not have a formula in it.
To modify a function instead of inserting a new one, follow the steps for
modifying a formula, which are presented later in this chapter.
2. Choose Insert➪Functions, or click the AutoPilot icon on the Formula
toolbar. If the Formula toolbar is not visible, choose View➪Toolbars➪
Formula bar to make it appear.
The dialog box should look similar to Figure 12-2, which shows the
Functions tab displayed. If the Structure tab is active instead of the
Functions tab, your active cell probably contains a formula. Click the
Cancel button to return to your active sheet and either choose another
active cell or press Backspace to delete the contents of the active cell.
Then return and perform Step 2.
3. Choose a category from the Category combo box, and select a function
from the Function list.
Figure 12-2:
The
AutoPilot:
Functions
dialog box
offers 365
functions.
206
Part III: Using Calc — The Spreadsheet 

207
Chapter 12: Making Calculations
The name and description of that function appear, as shown in Figure
12-2. Also, the list of arguments that the function needs to return a value
appears. For instance, the PMT function returns the periodic payment of
an annuity. That’s bank jargon for “calculates mortgage payments and
other similar investments.” As shown in Figure 12-2, this function
requires Rate, NPER, PV, FV, and Type to return a value. The following
step provides more information about these arguments.
4. Double-click a function from the Function list.
Input boxes appear so that you can insert values into the function. Some
functions, such as Now in the Date&Time category, do not require informa-
tion to return a value. No input box appears. Just click OK, and you see
the date and time in the active cell. (However, you may need to enlarge
the column width to see the date and time.) Other functions require many
values, such as the PMT function that is shown in Figure 12-3.
5. Insert your values or cell references into the input boxes for your
function.
Sometimes figuring out exactly what the function expects can be tricky.
For instance, Rate, as shown in Figure 12-3, applies to the rate for the
monthly period, not the yearly period. In this case, an annual rate of 6.25
percent can be entered as .0625/12. Calc is more than happy to divide or
multiply (or perform other actions) in the input boxes.
Figure 12-3:
You can 
use the
AutoPilot:
Functions
dialog box
to quickly
create
formulas.

208
Part III: Using Calc — The Spreadsheet 
Other values that are entered in Figure 12-3 are as follows:
• NPER: The number of periods for a 30-year loan is 360 monthly 
periods.
• PV: The present value is the amount of the loan — from the bank’s
point of view that is a negative number.
• FV: This is the future value. For a mortgage, this is always 0.
• Type: This indicates whether your payment is made at the begin-
ning or end of the period. For a mortgage, this is 0 as well. For
other types of investments, 0 indicates that the payment is at the
end of the period; 1 means that it’s at the beginning.
Notice the button that’s labeled fx next to each argument name in
Figure 12-3. Don’t click this button unless you want to nest your formulas.
Nesting formulas is covered in the section “Creating Magic Formulas,”
later in this chapter. If you click the fx button, just remember that glori-
ous invention known as the Back button.
When you type your value or cell reference in an input box, do not press
Enter, unless it is the last value or address that you need to enter. Calc
interprets pressing Enter as if you had clicked OK in the dialog box.
If Err502 — or some other error number — appears, you can find out
what the error means by clicking the Help button and typing the error
number into the input line. Most common errors are invalid parameters.
For example, Calc displays an error message when it finds an array when
it expects to find a single cell, or when the wrong number of parameters
is listed. (This can occur if you use a comma instead of a semicolon, use
a colon instead of a semicolon, or forget to enter all the parameters.) We
often forget to enter all the parameters, because we forget to scroll
down the parameter input lines in the AutoPilot:Functions dialog box.
To enter a cell reference instead of typing a value, you can either type
the address of the cell or use the shrink box.
To use the shrink box, follow these steps:
1. Place your cursor in the input box in which you want to enter
the cell reference.
2. Click the shrink box.
The AutoPilot:Functions dialog box shrinks to include just the
input line, the drag bar and close box, and the Unshrink button.
Your active sheet is now accessible.
3. Click the cell that you want to refer to in your formula. Or click
and drag from one diagonal corner to the other corner of a
range of cells.
A red box borders the selected cell(s). This box turns blue when
you release the mouse button.

209
Chapter 12: Making Calculations
4. Click the unshrink box.
The AutoPilot:Functions dialog box reappears.
6. Repeat Step 5 until all values have been entered, ensure that the
Array check box is deselected, and click OK.
The Array check box is an option for creating matrix arrays. We gener-
ally don’t use this check box. An easier and just as powerful way of deal-
ing with arrays is listed in the section “Creating formula arrays,” later in
this chapter.
7. Click OK.
The result that appears in the Result box of the AutoPilot:Functions
dialog box now appears in your cell.
Editing functions
You can edit functions in the following ways:
 Use the AutoPilot:Functions dialog box.
 Double-click the cell where the function resides. The function appears
and is editable.
 Select the cell where the function resides and edit it in the input line of
the Formula toolbar.
To edit functions using the AutoPilot:Functions dialog box, select the cell
where the function resides and click the AutoPilot:Functions icon on the
Formula toolbar, or choose Insert➪Functions. This opens the AutoPilot:
Functions dialog box with the Structure tab displayed. Your list of parameters
appears in their input boxes, and a graphic representation of your function
appears in the structure box. This is useful to see what functions are nested.
Nested functions are covered later in this chapter.
To edit a function manually, perform the following steps:
1. Select the cell that contains your function.
Your formula appears in the Formula toolbar’s input line.
2. Click the input line on the Formula toolbar (or double-click the cell).
If you double-click the cell, your formula appears in the cell and
becomes editable. If you click the input line, the input line is editable.
Color-coded boxes appear in the spreadsheet bordering each cell or
range that is referred to in your formula. Your formula also becomes a
rainbow of colors — one color for each cell or range.

210
Part III: Using Calc — The Spreadsheet 
3. Reposition the colored borders as you desire, or type in the new
addresses that you want to use.
If you reposition the colored borders, the cell and range addresses
change in the formula to reflect their new position. If you type the new
addresses into the formula, the borders move to reflect your new formula.
4. Press Enter.
This is important. Otherwise, whenever you click on your spreadsheet,
you are inadvertently inserting new addresses into your formula and
moving colored borders around by mistake. You will feel like you are lost
like Alice in Wonderland.
Entering functions manually
If you don’t want to deal with the AutoPilot:Functions dialog box, you can
simply type your function into any cell. It’s easy. The only trick is knowing
what to type. If your function has no parameters, such as =NOW() or
=TODAY(), why not just type it in? And if your function is more complicated,
you can look up the parameters using the AutoPilot:Functions dialog box,
and then return to the active sheet and type the function into the cell. Just be
careful to follow these rules:
 Start with an equal sign.
 Place semicolons between the parameters.
 Be sure that you list the correct number of parameters between the
parentheses.
 Don’t misspell anything.
Copying and pasting formulas
Formulas containing values can be copied and pasted just like numbers. For
example, typing =EasterSunday(2004) produces the same value no matter
where you copy and paste it. The same is true for typing =Now( ), which
requires no parameters.
If your formula contains a cell reference, for example =SQRT(A1), which
returns the square root of the number in cell A1, to copy that formula, you
need to understand relative addressing. For the example shown in Figure 12-4,
Calc always looks one row up and three columns back to find the value to use
in the SQRT formula, no matter what cell the formula is moved or copied to.

To move or copy a formula that contains a relative address, you may want to
move or copy the cell that it is addressing as well.
Relative addressing is very useful, especially in extending totals.
To extend a single total to a whole row of totals for a table, perform the fol-
lowing steps:
1. Copy the total that you want to extend.
2. Select the range of cells that you want to paste your totals into.
3. Paste the totals.
The ranges in the Sum functions change to reflect the columns where
the newly pasted formula resides.
Creating formula arrays
If you copy and paste formulas, making use of relative addressing , just add
one more step, and you can create tables of formulas, such as the mortgage
tables shown in Figure 12-4. That one step that you need to add is called
absolute addressing.
Figure 12-4:

references

relative and

whenever

is moved.
211
Chapter 12: Making Calculations

212
Part III: Using Calc — The Spreadsheet 
An absolute address is easier to understand than a relative address. An
absolute address is one that does not move. For example, in Figure 12-4, if the
formula =SQRT(A1) referred to an absolute address of cell A1, whenever you
moved or copied that formula, it would always refer to cell A1 for its value.
Calc uses dollar signs to denote absolute addresses. The formula with an
absolute address would read =SQRT($A$1).
The dollar sign in front of the A fixes column A as nonchanging for this for-
mula, and the dollar sign in front of the 1 fixes Row 1 as nonchanging.
To create a column, row, or array of formulas, perform the following steps:
1. Type in the variables for your column and/or row headings.
For example, the column headings for the mortgage table in Figure 12-5
are the number of years for the mortgage. And the row headings are the
annual interest rates.
2. Make a corner cell of your table (or end cell for a single column
or row) the active cell. Then insert your formula by using the
AutoPilot:Functions dialog box or by typing the formula in the cell.
The AutoPilot:Functions dialog box creates formulas with relative
addresses. During this step, don’t concern yourself with relative or
absolute addressing. Just get the formula to work using the column
Figure 12-5:
Mortgage
tables are
arrays of
formulas.

213
Chapter 12: Making Calculations
heading and row heading as parameters. In Figure 12-5, the PV (present
value) function (–$B$2) is also a cell reference, and because it is sup-
posed to be a negative number, it contains a negative sign in the for-
mula. Parameters that don’t change can be entered as values, such as
the fifth and sixth parameters of the mortgage formula in Figure 12-5.
3. Double-click the cell with your formula.
Your formula appears in the cell.
4. Determine what parameters refer to stationary cells, if any, and type a
dollar sign ($) in front of the column name and in front of the row
name for that parameter.
The PMT function that is used in Figure 12-5 has the following parameters:
• PMT
• Rate
• Number of periods
• Present value
• Future value
• Type
The rate changes with each row, and the number of periods changes
with each column, but the present value is in a single cell that does not
change. Only the present value cell address needs to have dollar signs
placed in front of both the row and the column name; that is, $B$2.
If you forget the parameters of a function, you can always open the
AutoPilot:Functions dialog box to remind you. Be sure that your active
cell is empty or contains no formula, choose Insert➪Function, and click
the function that you need. Write down the parameter(s) so that you
don’t forget them.
5. Determine what parameter refers to a row heading, if any, and type a
dollar sign in front of the cell address for that parameter.
In Figure 12-5, the Rate parameter becomes $A5/12 instead of A5/12.
(Remember, you must divide the yearly interest rate by 12 to get the
interest rate for a month.) You need to keep the column stationary
because the interest rate is always in column A.
6. Determine what parameter refers to a column heading, if any, and
type a dollar sign in front of the row address for that name.
.
In Figure 12-5, the column heading is the number of years, which is
the number of months times 12. A dollar sign is placed in front of the
row name. B4 becomes B$4. Row four needs to be stationary because
the number of years is always in row 4.
7. Press Enter.
Your formula disappears, and in its place is the value that it returns.

214
Part III: Using Calc — The Spreadsheet 
8. Copy the cell with the formula, and paste it into every cell of the
table, or row or column.
All cells below the number of years and to the right of the interest rates
now show their corresponding values.
Recalculating formulas
Recalculating is generally automatic for formulas. When you change a value
in a table, the total automatically changes. But some formulas and functions
do not recalculate automatically. For instance, the NOW function places the
time and date into a cell. If you want the current time — not the time that you
happened to have inserted that function into the cell — you need to recalcu-
late. Also, very large spreadsheets may require recalculation to produce reli-
able results.
Recalculating is easy. Just choose Tools➪Cell Contents➪Recalculate. Recal-
culation occurs immediately. Your Now() function should show the correct
time and date.
If your spreadsheet is not recalculating automatically, be sure that the
Automatic Recalculation feature is turned on. Choose Tools➪Cell Contents,
and be sure that the Automatic Recalculation check box is selected.
Creating Magic Formulas
The functions of Calc, which are listed in the AutoPilot:Functions dialog box,
are basic formulas. These functions are building blocks that can be placed and
stacked together to create more complex formulas that can perform almost
any calculation in a spreadsheet. Functions may nest within other functions,
making complex formulas, or they may refer to conditions, creating condi-
tional formulas. Regardless of what you call them, formulas and functions are
like fairy dust particles that turn your rug into a flying carpet.
Nesting functions
Functions within functions are called nested functions. One function’s output
is the other function’s input. For example, to find out what today’s week
number is — from 1 to 52 — you could use a calendar and count the weeks or
your could create the function =WEEKNUM(TODAY();2). The function TODAY
returns the current date, and the number 2 specifies to start counting the
new week with Monday, not Sunday.

215
Chapter 12: Making Calculations
You can nest functions with the AutoPilot:Functions dialog box, or you can
just type functions into a cell. Remember to start with an equal sign, use the
right number of parameters, use semicolons instead of commas between
parameters, make no spelling mistakes, and drive carefully.
To nest functions using the AutoPilot:Functions dialog box, perform these
steps:
1. Click the empty cell where you want your function to reside.
2. Choose Insert➪Function.
The AutoPilot:Functions dialog box appears.
3. Choose your category, and double-click the desired function.
In the preceding example, you would double-click WEEKNUM. The input
boxes appear for your function.
4. Click in the first input box.
5. Click the fx button to the left of the input box.
The input boxes disappear, but the Category combo box and the
Function list box remain.
6. Choose All for the category, and in the Function list box, double-click
the function that you want to insert.
For this example, double-click Today. The information for the double-
clicked function appears and if the function has parameters; the input
boxes for the parameters also appear.
7. Fill in the parameters of your function (if any), and then click the Back
button to return to your original function.
8. Enter values, cell references, equations, or nested formulas into each
input box for the formula.
9. Press Enter, or click OK.
The number of weeks from the beginning of the year to the current date
is entered in your active cell.
Creating conditional formulas
Conditional formulas are commonly used in Calc. Suppose that you sell nurs-
ery plants and you give free gifts to customers who buy a certain quantity of
plants. If your customer buys over $40 worth of plants, you add a free rhodo-
dendron plant to his order. This is a conditional formula. An example of this
conditional formula is shown in Figure 12-6.

216
Part III: Using Calc — The Spreadsheet 
To create a conditional formula, perform the following steps:
1. Click the cell where you want your result to reside.
For example, in Figure 12-6, the formula resides in cell A12.
2. Choose Insert➪Function.
The AutoPilot:Functions dialog box appears.
3. Choose All or Logical from the category list, and double-click IF in
the function list.
The input boxes appear for the parameters of the IF function.
4. Click in the first input box, labeled Test, and click the shrink box to
the left of the input box.
Your dialog box shrinks, and your spreadsheet is accessible.
5. Click the cell that contains or will contain the data that you need to
evaluate.
In Figure 12-6, the cell that contains the subtotal is the desired cell.
6. Click the Unshrink box.
The AutoPilot:Functions dialog box reappears. The cell that you chose
appears in the Test input box.
Figure 12-6:
An
automated
invoice
makes use
of a
conditional
formula.

7. Press ←.
This deselects the cell address. If you did not press ←, your cell address
would be replaced by whatever you typed next. The cursor should now
be blinking to the left of the cell address.
8. Type your conditional statement.
In Figure 12-6, the conditional statement is D11>40. The operators: <, >,
>=, <=, and = are all good candidates for conditions.
You can also place AND or OR into your statement, for example, D11>40
AND D11<200. This would be the case if you wanted to give an even
bigger gift to people who bought over $200 worth of items. In that case,
you would have to nest another IF statement into the ELSE portion of
the IF statement. It can seem complex at first, but programmers do this
kind of thing every day.
9. Click in the input box labeled Then value, and type your value into
the box. Use quotes for text.
In Figure 12-6, this value is “Rhododendron”.
10. To place a different value into your cell if the condition is not met,
click in the input box labeled Otherwise value, and type in your value.
For example, in Figure 12-6, instead of leaving the cell blank if a cus-
tomer does not order over $40 worth of goods, you could insert some-
thing like, “Sorry, no rhododendrons for you” — or maybe not.
11. Press Enter, or click OK.
The value that your formula returns appears in the active cell.

Part IV
Using Impress —
The Presentation
Package

In this part . . .
T
his part tells you all you need to know about creating
a great presentation. Step by step, it starts with the
basics, such as starting a presentation, editing a presen-
tation, creating bullets and paragraphs, and helping your
audience with graphics, animation, and handouts. 

Chapter 13
Creating a Presentation
In This Chapter
 Opening a new or existing presentation
 Understanding presentation views
 Inserting slides
 Saving a presentation
I
n this chapter, we cover the basics of using Impress, OpenOffice.org’s pre-
sentation application. You discover how to open a presentation, move
around in its various views, add some slides, and save the presentation.
These skills are the basis for all your presentation creation.
Starting a Presentation
When creating a new presentation, you can start from scratch or use
AutoPilot to help you along the way. Of course, you can also open an existing
presentation and continue to work on it.
Using AutoPilot to start quickly
By default, when you open Impress, AutoPilot opens to let you start from
scratch, use a template, or open an existing presentation, as shown in Figure
13-1. Impress has two kinds of templates. Presentation backgrounds, or design
templates, include only a background, and you add all the text. Presentations,
or content templates, include both a background and suggested ideas for
text. On the other hand, the current version has two templates of either kind.

222
Part IV: Using Impress – The Presentation Package 
For more templates, go to www.ooextras.org and click Impress.
Even if you start from scratch, you get to choose a design or content tem-
plate, the type of output (such as overheads or on-screen), and a transition
type. Using the Template option offers you the additional opportunity to
specify the name of your company, a subject, and the specific pages (slides)
that you want to include if you choose a content template.
AutoPilot varies depending on your choices. The following steps show you
how if you choose the Template option. The Empty Presentation option is
similar.
1. From the drop-down list on the first screen, choose Presentation
Backgrounds to start a new presentation with a background, or
choose Presentations to choose one of the content templates that pro-
vide an outline structure for various kinds of presentations. Choose
one of the templates, and click Next.
For this step, we chose one of the Presentation options, Recommendation
of a Strategy.
2. On the second screen, choose a slide design.
If this sounds repetitive, it is. You can choose the same presentation back-
grounds and presentations. However, if you’ve already chosen a back-
ground (see Step 1), you can choose a presentation (content template)
here to combine the two; that is, the content on the background that you
chose. For this step, we chose a custom template that we created.
Later in this chapter, we explain how to add a template to the list of pre-
sentation backgrounds. In Chapter 14, we explain how to use Master view,
where you design repeating elements of a presentation or a template.
Figure 13-1:
The

you on your
way to a 
new pre-
sentation.

223
Chapter 13: Creating a Presentation
3. In the Select an Output Medium panel of the second screen, choose
the type of output that you want to create. Click Next.
This selection determines the size and orientation of your slides. The
Original option uses a size that is based on the template that you chose.
Use Screen if you plan to use an LCD projector or present from your com-
puter screen. Use Slide to print individual slides (for a carousel projector).
4. On the third screen, choose a slide transition effect and speed from
the drop-down lists.
A slide transition effect determines how each slide appears. Select the
Preview check box so that when you choose an effect, you can see what
the transition looks like in the Preview box.
5. In the Select a Presentation Type panel of the third screen, choose
Default, which runs the presentation under your control, or choose
Automatic, which loops the presentation repeatedly. Click Next.
If you choose Automatic, set the timing for each slide and the pause
after each run-through of the presentation.
6. In the fourth screen, you can add the name of your company, the
main subject of the presentation, and other ideas that you want to
convey. Click Next.
The items that you enter appear on the title slide of the presentation.
You can change them later if you want. This screen does not appear if
you chose to create an empty presentation.
7. On the fifth screen, choose the pages that you want and click the
Create button.
This screen only appears if you chose a content template.
Figure 13-2 shows the presentation that results from the choices we made.
Opening an existing presentation
To open an existing presentation, you can do one of the following, depending
on your circumstances:
 Start OpenOffice.org, and click the File menu. Choose one of the presen-
tations at the bottom of the menu.
 From any OpenOffice.org application, choose File➪Open.
 Start OpenOffice.org Impress and choose File➪New➪Presentation. From
the AutoPilot screen, choose Open Existing Presentation.

224
Part IV: Using Impress – The Presentation Package 
Viewing Your Presentation
When you have a presentation on-screen, you need to know how to display
your presentation in the best way to get your work done and how to navigate
through it.
Using Impress’s views
Impress has six views, each of which displays your slides differently. You
choose a view based on what you need to see at the moment. The view but-
tons are at the upper-right corner of your screen. The various views are
described as follows:
 Drawing view: Shows one slide at a time so that you can easily focus on
perfecting that slide, as shown in Figure 13-3.
 Outline view: Shows the text of your presentation only so that you can
work on your content and see how it flows. To see a small preview of the
current slide at the same time, choose View➪Preview.

225
Chapter 13: Creating a Presentation
 Slides view: Shows small views of your slides so that you can see many
of them at once, reorder them, delete them, and so on. Figure 13-2 shows
a presentation in Slides view.
 Notes view: Shows one slide with a space at the bottom to add notes for
yourself or for someone else who will review the presentation.
 Handout view: Enables you to format handouts that you can print and
give to your audience. Handouts can display from one to six slides per
page.
 Slide show view: Displays the presentation full-screen, slide by slide.
You use this view when you deliver your presentation to an audience.
Understanding Impress’s modes
In addition to views, Impress has three modes that display different aspects
of the infrastructure of a presentation. Okay, what does that mean and how
do you change from one mode to another? In this section, we explain the
modes and how they relate to the views. The mode buttons are at the lower-
left corner of your screen. The modes are as follows:
Figure 13-3:
Drawing
view shows
one slide at
a time.

 Slide mode: This is the mode that you normally use to work on creating
your presentation. You can only use Drawing or Notes view when you
are in Slide mode, because these views are the only views that let you
actually add graphics and objects to a slide.
 Master mode: This mode formats the overall structure of the presenta-
tion. For example, you set the font types and colors for the entire pre-
sentation in Master mode. You can also add a graphic, such as a logo,
that you want to appear on every slide. Master mode with Drawing view
sets the structure for the slides. Master mode with Notes view sets the
structure of the Notes view. Master mode with Handout view lays out
handouts that you print and give to your audience.
 Layers mode: This mode enables you to access the layers of a slide.
When you enter Layers mode, tabs appear, one for each layer. Click a tab
to make its layer current. Layers mode is not exclusive to the other
modes — you use the Layers mode button to turn Layers mode on and
off with either Slide mode or Master mode active. The default layers are
as follows:
• Layout: Contains all the normal objects on a slide, such as text and
graphics. You use this layer most often.
• Controls: Holds buttons that you have created. You usually create
buttons to execute a macro.
• Dimension Lines: Holds dimensions that you create to measure
objects on the screen.
You use dimension lines to measure objects. To draw a dimension
line, choose the Dimension Line button from the Lines and Arrows
toolbar of the Object toolbar. Click and drag to draw the line. Press
Ctrl to snap to an object, and press Shift to hold the dimension line
to an exact multiple of 45 degrees. Figure 13-4 shows an example of
a dimension line.
You can lock a layer to prevent editing and hide a layer to make it invisible.
For example, you may want to measure an object with a dimension line, but
you probably don’t want that dimension to appear in your presentation. You
can also add new layers to help you organize the objects on your slides. Use
the following when working with layers:
 Add a layer: In Layers mode, right-click (Control+click on the Mac) any
layer tab and choose Insert Layer from the shortcut menu that appears.
Name the layer, set its properties (whether the layer is visible, printable,
or locked), and click OK.
226
Part IV: Using Impress – The Presentation Package 

227
Chapter 13: Creating a Presentation
 Lock or hide a layer: In Layers mode, right-click (Control+click on the
Mac) any layer tab and choose Modify Layer from the shortcut menu
that appears. Select the Locked check box to lock the layer. Deselect the
Visible check box to hide the layer. You can also deselect the Printable
check box to ensure that the layer is not printed.
 Delete a layer: In Layers mode, right-click (Control+click on the Mac)
any layer tab and choose Delete Layer from the shortcut menu that
appears. Click the Yes button to confirm. Deleting a layer deletes any
object on that layer.
Click the Layers mode button to leave Layers mode.
Adding a template to an 
existing presentation
If you start a new presentation using the Empty Presentation option, you can
add a template at any time. Follow these steps:
1. Switch to Master mode.
We explain Master mode in the previous section of this chapter.
Figure 13-4:
Use
dimension
lines to
measure
your
objects.

2. Choose Format➪Styles➪Slide Design.
The Slide Design dialog box opens.
3. Click the Load button.
The Load Slide Design dialog box opens.
4. From the Categories list, choose Presentation Backgrounds.
5. Choose one of the templates from the Templates list.
6. Click OK twice to close both dialog boxes and return to your 
presentation.
7. Return to Slide mode.
The slide design appears on your slides. (We explain Slide mode in the
previous section of this chapter.)
Navigating through a presentation
As soon as you have more than one slide, you need to know how to navigate
through a presentation. You can navigate in the following ways:
 In Slide mode, each slide has a tab at the bottom of the screen. Click the
tab to display the slide. If the tab is not visible, click the left and right
arrows to the left of the tabs to scroll through the tabs.
 Display the Navigator (click the Navigator button on the Function tool-
bar). Each slide is listed, as shown in Figure 13-5. Double-click any slide
in the Navigator to display that slide.
For details about navigating through a presentation in Slide Show view, when
you deliver it, see Chapter 17.

presen-
tation.

Part IV: Using Impress – The Presentation Package 

229
Chapter 13: Creating a Presentation
Adding Slides
To build your presentation, you need to add slides. Usually, you build a pre-
sentation slide by slide, so when you finish one slide, you add the next. Of
course, if you used AutoPilot to create a presentation using a content tem-
plate, you may already have the slides that you need. Then again, you may
need additional slides.
To add a slide, follow these steps:
1. Display the slide after which you want to insert a slide.
2. Choose Insert➪Slide.
The Insert Slide dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 13-6.
To display the Presentation toolbar, which contains several often-used
commands, include Insert Slide. Choose View➪Toolbars➪Presentation.
3. In the Name text box, enter a name for the slide.
If you don’t enter a name, OpenOffice.org inserts Slide 2, depending on
the slide number. A name that relates to the topic of the slide, ideally the
title of the slide, is more helpful for navigating.
4. From the Select an AutoLayout panel, choose a layout.
A layout provides you with a structure for laying out a slide. Choose the
layout that best matches what you want to have on the slide.
5. Click OK.
Figure 13-6:

Part IV: Using Impress – The Presentation Package 
Later in this chapter, we explain how to add text to a slide. Chapters 14 and
15 explain how to edit text and add graphics.
Creating an outline in Impress
To focus on your content at first and go back and fill in the graphics later,
create your presentation using Outline view. To create a presentation in
Outline view, follow these steps:
1. Click the Outline view button on the toolbar.
You now see a white space where you can start to type. To also see a
small view of each slide, choose View➪Preview. The cursor is next to a
slide icon.
2. Type the title of the slide next to the slide icon, as shown in Figure 13-7.
Figure 13-7:
Starting a

in Outline
view.

231
Chapter 13: Creating a Presentation
3. Press Enter, and type the next line of text for the slide. Press Enter
again.
A new slide icon appears at the left of the new line of text, indicating that
this text will appear on a new slide. You see a new slide if you have a pre-
view. However, you want this text to be on the same slide as the first line
of text.
4. Select the new line of text and click the Demote button on the Object
toolbar, or press Tab.
The new line of text moves to the right, under the first line of text. If you
have a preview, you can see that the new line of text is now on the same
slide as the first line.
5. If you want, continue to type more text for the slide.
6. To start a new slide, type the slide title and press Enter.
This line of text appears at the end of the previous slide that you were
working on.
7. To move the new text to a new slide, select the text and click the
Promote button on the Object toolbar or press Shift+Tab.
The new text now appears on a new slide.
8. Repeat Steps 4 through 6 to create more slides, as shown in Figure 13-8.
Figure 13-8:
Creating a
presentation
in Outline
view.

You can move any slide in Outline view by clicking its slide icon and dragging
up or down. You can also use the Move Up and Move Down buttons on the
Object toolbar.
Creating an outline in Writer
You can create your outline in Writer and then send it to Impress. You may
simply find it easier to write in Writer, or you may have an outline that some-
one already created.
To create the outline in Writer, you need to format it specially so that Impress
knows how to divide the text into slides, which text should be a slide title,
and which text should be bulleted text on the slide. This is easy:
 Text that uses a heading style becomes a slide title and starts a new
slide.
 Any text that uses a paragraph style, such as Text Body, becomes 
bulleted text.
If you’re not familiar with styles in Writer, see Chapter 4.
If someone gives you an outline that was created in Microsoft Word, open the
outline in Writer and format it as we just described. Then save it as a Writer
document.
To create the presentation with this outline, follow these steps:
1. In Writer, choose File➪Send➪AutoAbstract to Presentation.
The Create AutoAbstract dialog box opens.
2. In the Included Outline Levels text box, enter the number of levels of
heading styles that you want to include.
3. In the Subpoints per Level text box, enter the number of bulleted
items that you want to include.
To include all the text, use a high number here. Use lower numbers to
use only the first one or two points in your presentation.
4. Click OK.
OpenOffice.org creates a new presentation from your outline.
You can now add a template as described earlier in this chapter, and further
refine your presentation.

233
Chapter 13: Creating a Presentation
Adding text to a slide
In the previous section, we explained how to add text to a presentation using
Outline view. However, you may prefer to add text to each slide individually.
When you add text to each slide, you can see how the text looks on the slide
more clearly. If you already have graphics on the slide, you can get a better
idea of the entire layout of the slide.
Using text placeholders
The most common way to add text to a slide is to use text placeholders.
When you add a slide and choose an AutoLayout, as explained in the section
“Adding Slides,” earlier in this chapter, you can choose a slide that includes a
text placeholder for bulleted text, such as the one that’s shown in Figure 13-9.
Inserting a text frame
You don’t need to limit yourself to the text placeholders. You can add text
wherever you want. OpenOffice.org offers the following types of text frames:
Figure 13-9:
The Title,

and bulleted

234
Part IV: Using Impress – The Presentation Package 
To add the title of the slide, click the Click to add title text and start typing. To
add bulleted text, click the Click to add an outline text and type away. Press
Enter to add a new bulleted item.
 Text Frame: Click the Text Frame button on the Text floating toolbar on
the Object toolbar. Drag a frame to the desired width. You see a frame
that is the width that you dragged but with a height of only one line, no
matter how you dragged. Don’t worry! Start to type, and the frame
increases in height as you type to adjust to the amount of text. If you
later adjust the width of the frame, the text rewraps to fit the new width.
You should probably use this type of frame most of the time.
 Fit Text to Frame: Click the Fit Text to Frame button on the Text floating
toolbar on the Object toolbar. Drag a frame to the desired width. You see
four handles indicating the frame size and a cursor that is the full height
of the frame! Plunge ahead and start typing. The text is probably huge,
unless you dragged a very short frame. When you think you want a new
line, press Enter. To finish, press Esc. Only now does the text adjust to
the size of the frame. If you later adjust the size of the frame, the text
changes size (both height and width), just as a graphic object scales
when you adjust its selection border. Use this type of frame when you
want text to act like a graphic object.
Chapter 14 explains how to edit and format text in more detail.
Saving Your Presentation for Posterity
Before you create too many slides — or even after creating the first slide —
you should save your presentation. You can save in OpenOffice.org format or
save to several other presentation formats. You can also export your presen-
tation to a host of other formats, such as PDF (Adobe Reader), SWF (Flash
Player), HTML, and many graphic formats.
Saving in OpenOffice.org format
To save a presentation for the first time, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Save, click the Save button on the Function toolbar, or
press Ctrl+S (Ô+S on the Mac).
The Save As dialog box opens (but only if you are saving the presenta-
tion for the first time).
2. In the Save in drop-down list, choose a location for the presentation.
3. In the File Name text box, enter a name for the presentation.
4. Click the Save button.

After you save your presentation for the first time, you should save every few
minutes, using the same method. Now, the Save As dialog box doesn’t open
because the presentation already has a name and location. The saving
process occurs without much fanfare, but you can rest easy knowing that you
won’t lose your work if your computer crashes or the electricity goes off.
Saving in other presentation formats
To share your presentation with others who don’t have OpenOffice.org (is
anybody left out there who doesn’t have OpenOffice.org?), you can save your
presentation in Microsoft PowerPoint format. In fact, you can save in all the
following formats:
 OpenOffice.org presentation (.sxi): Of course.
 OpenOffice.org Presentation Template (.sti): Save your presentation as
a template for future reuse.
 Microsoft PowerPoint 97/2000/XP (.ppt, .pps): The PPT format is the
regular PowerPoint format. The PPS format is the slide show format,
which is used when you are delivering a presentation full-screen.
 Microsoft PowerPoint 97/2000/XP Template (.pot): Save your presenta-
tion as a PowerPoint template for future use in PowerPoint.
 OpenOffice.org Drawing (.scd): Save in OpenOffice.org Drawing format.
 StarDraw (.sda, .sdd): Save in two possible versions of StarOffice’s
Draw format.
 StarImpress (.sdd): Save in two possible versions of StarOffice’s Impress
format.
 StarImpress Template (.vor): Save in two possible versions of
StarOffice’s Impress template format.
To save your presentation in one of these formats, choose File➪Save As. In
the Save As dialog box, choose the format that you want from the Save As
Type drop-down list. Click the Save button. OpenOffice.org creates a copy of
your presentation in the new format.
If you save your presentation as a template, you should save the template in
a location that you can easily find when you want to create a new presenta-
tion based on the template. Follow these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Options➪Paths and look for Templates. Write down the
location or locations for templates.
235
Chapter 13: Creating a Presentation

236
Part IV: Using Impress – The Presentation Package 
You’ll probably find more than one location. In that case, look in those
locations to find out where the templates that are used in AutoPilot
reside. On our Windows system, these templates are in the C:\Program
Files\OpenOffice.org1.1\share\template\english\layout
folder. If necessary, start AutoPilot again (choose File➪New in Impress)
and choose the template option to see the names of the templates there.
The filenames don’t necessarily exactly match the names that appear in
AutoPilot, but they are similar.
To save a content template, look for the location of the presentations
that appear in AutoPilot. On our Windows system, the location is the
same as that for the design templates, but the last folder is presnt
instead of layout.
2. Choose File➪Save As, and choose the OpenOffice.org Presentation
Template (.sti) option from the Save as Type drop-down list. Give
your template an easy-to-recognize name.
3. From the Save in drop-down list, choose the desired location for the
template.
4. Click the Save button.
5. Choose File➪New➪Templates and Documents.
The Templates and Documents dialog box opens.
6. In the left panel, choose Templates.
You see in the template folders in the Title panel.
7. Double-click the folder that contains your template.
The templates appear in the Title panel.
8. Choose the template that you want, and click the Open button.
Exporting to other formats
You can also export your presentation to graphic formats. You may want to
use a graphic format to insert an image of a slide into a Writer document or
onto a Web page. You can also use this format to send a copy of your presen-
tation to other people who don’t have a presentation program. Table 13-1
lists the most common export formats.

Exporting to HTML format
When you export to HTML format, as described in the previous section, the
HTML Export AutoPilot opens so that you can specify settings that relate to
your HTML file. Follow these steps to export to HTML:
1. Choose File➪Save As, and choose HTML from the Save as Type drop-
down list. Click the Save button.

238
Part IV: Using Impress – The Presentation Package 
2. In the first screen of the HTML Export AutoPilot, choose New Design
to create a design in the AutoPilot, or choose Existing Design (if any
are listed).
If you choose Existing Design, choose a design and click Next.
The next steps assume that you chose New Design.
3. On the second screen, shown in Figure 13-10 with the Standard HTML
format option, choose the publication type, as follows:
• Standard HTML format: Creates a regular HTML page for each
slide, along with navigation tools.
• Standard HTML with frames: Creates HTML pages so that the
slides are in the main frame. A frame on the left side contains a
table of slides with hyperlinks to each slide.
• Automatic: Creates an HTML presentation that advances automati-
cally. You can use existing timings for each slide or set a timing
here. You can also loop the presentation.
• WebCast: Creates Active Server Pages (ASPs) or Perl programming
code so that you can deliver the presentation in real-time over the
Internet and change the slides in the audience’s Web browsers.
To use the WebCast option, you need access to a server that sup-
ports ASPs or Perl.
Depending on the type of publication that you choose, the options
change accordingly. Choose the options that you want. In the steps that
follow, we chose the Standard HTML format option. For this option, you
can choose to create a title page and decide whether you want to dis-
play notes that you have written for each slide.

4. Click Next.
5. On the next screen, choose the type of graphic format you want to use
for the slides: GIF or JPEG. Also, choose the desired resolution. Click
Next.
6. If you chose to create a title page, insert information for the title page.
Click Next.
7. On the next screen, choose one of the button styles for navigating
from slide to slide. Click Next.
8. On the next screen, choose colors for text and hyperlinks. Click the
Create button.
The Name HTML Design dialog box opens.
9. To save the parameters that you chose for the HTML document so that
you can use them again in the future, enter a name and click the Save
button. Otherwise, click the Do Not Save button.
OpenOffice.org creates the HTML presentation in the same folder as your reg-
ular presentation. To see the presentation run, find the HTML file and open it.
Use the navigation buttons to run through the presentation.
When you create an HTML presentation, you end up with a large number of
files. If your presentation is in a folder with many other files, you will proba-
bly have a hard time figuring out which files belong to the presentation.
Because you need to upload the files to your Web server, you should save
your presentation in a new folder before you export it to HTML format.
Exiting Impress
When you finish your working session in Impress and save your presentation,
it’s time to exit Impress. To exit a presentation, choose File➪Close. Other pre-
sentations or other OpenOffice.org files remain open.
To close OpenOffice.org, choose File➪Exit or click the Close button on the
toolbar.

Modifying a Presentation
In This Chapter
 Editing text
 Formatting text
 Using bullets
 Formatting paragraphs
 Using Master view
O
nce you have started a presentation, you always need to edit and
change it. In this chapter, we explain how to edit text and make it look
good, too. We cover the tricks of the trade for using bullets (the kind that
communicate peacefully) and lining up your paragraphs. Finally, we explain
how to use Master view to control the design of your entire presentation and
give it consistency.
Editing Text
Editing text in Impress is not much different from editing text in Writer, but
you should know about the few differences that exist. These differences
mainly occur because of the graphical nature of a presentation.
Selecting text
To edit text, you need to select it. You use the same techniques that you use
in Writer. You can do any of the following to select text:
 Drag across text
 Double-click a word to select the word
 Triple-click a line to select the entire line of text

When you select text in a text placeholder or a separate text frame that you
added to a slide, you also select the placeholder or frame itself — you see a
border and square handles, as shown in Figure 14-1.
Most of the techniques for selecting text in Writer also apply to Impress. For
a more detailed list of techniques, including keyboard shortcuts, see the sec-
tion “Entering and Editing Text,” in Chapter 3.
When you select text, you can’t see its color because of the highlighting. So
sometimes you want to deselect text. The easiest way to deselect text is to
simply click on the edge of the slide or even completely off the slide, on the
gray background.
Changing text
After you select text, you can type over it to replace what is selected. You can
also click between words or letters and type to insert text. These techniques
are the same as the ones that you use in Writer.
Figure 14-1:
When you
select text
in Impress,
you also
select its
placeholder
or frame.
242
Part IV: Using Impress — The Presentation Package 

To copy text, you can use the standard techniques of drag and drop and
copying to the clipboard, and then pasting. Dragging and dropping text from
slide to slide works best in Outline view. Copying and pasting works in
Outline view as well as in Slide view. You can also move text using drag and
drop or by cutting to the clipboard and then pasting.
To delete text, select it and press Delete. You can also place the cursor after
the text and press Backspace.
For more details about changing text, see the section “Entering and Editing
Text” in Chapter 3.
If you have text in a placeholder or frame and don’t want any text there, you
can delete the placeholder or frame instead. By default, when you click in a
text placeholder or text frame, you are in text edit mode, so pressing Delete
or Backspace deletes only the text. So how do you delete the placeholder or
frame? You need to click the border of the placeholder or frame and then
press Delete or Backspace. When you click the border, OpenOffice.org under-
stands that you want to deal with the whole object, not just its text.
Using Text with Style
The presentation template and its Master view control the default font type,
font size, and font color. (The Master view is explained more fully in the sec-
tion “Using Master View,” later in this chapter.) Overall, you should stay as
consistent as possible. Using many fonts and font sizes in a presentation
yields a chaotic impression. However, you may want some variety or to make
an exception for a particular slide. You can easily change the look of any text.
When you change the font of some text, you should choose a font that looks
good with other fonts that you are using. Serif fonts have small horizontal
lines added to their edges and are ideal for paragraph text. Most of the text in
this book is in a serif font. Sans-serif fonts have simpler shapes — use them
for headings. For bulleted text you can choose either a serif or a sans-serif
font. Legibility is the most important principle; however, you may also want
to match the look of your font with your overall design.
To change the font, select the text and choose the font that you want from
the Font drop-down list on the Object toolbar. To change the font’s size,
choose the size that you want from the Font Size drop-down list on the
Object toolbar. 
On the same Object toolbar, you can continue to format your text, adding
bold, italic, or underline formatting and changing the color.
243
Chapter 14: Modifying a Presentation 

In Chapter 16, we explain how you can add animation effects to text in text
frames.
Playing with Bullets
The most common type of text in a presentation is a bulleted list. Contrary to
popular opinion, these bullets are not dangerous — they don’t hurt you, your
audience, or even the text.
Why are these benign bullets so popular in presentations? Bulleted lists are
usually partial sentences that contain just enough content to remind you and
your audience of the concept that you are trying to get across. You don’t
want your audience to read the slide while you’re talking — you want them to
listen to you. So you use bulleted text to help you keep your presentation on
track, but not to read word for word.
Creating a bulleted list
When you create text in a text placeholder by choosing one of the text lay-
outs, your text is automatically formatted with bullets. (Chapter 13 explains
how to choose a layout for a slide.) You just type away and press Enter to
insert a new bullet.
If you create text in a text frame, you need to select the text and click the
Bullets button on the Object toolbar. To remove the bullets, select the text
and click the Bullets button again.
Choosing bullets
You can format the bullets to match your presentation design or bring atten-
tion to an item. The bullets automatically follow the style that is used in the
Master view, which we explain later in this chapter. To create bullets that
differ from those in the Master view, follow these steps:
1. Select the bulleted text.
2. Choose Format➪Numbering/Bullets, and click the Bullets tab.
The Numbering/Bullets dialog box, shown in Figure 14-2 with the Bullets
tab on top, opens.
244
Part IV: Using Impress — The Presentation Package 

3. Choose the type of bullets that you want.
4. Click OK.
To further format your bullets, click the Customize tab of the
Numbering/Bullets dialog box. On the Customize tab, you can change the
color and size of the bullets. You can also create a new bullet by choosing a
character from any font set.
Finally, you can click the Graphics tab to choose some graphic bullets.
Choose the one that you want, and click OK.
Creating numbered lists
If the text on your slide is part of a sequence, you can number the text
instead of bulleting it. Follow these steps to number your text:
1. Select the text.
2. Choose Format➪Numbering/Bullets.
The Numbering/Bullets dialog box opens.
3. Click the Numbering Type tab.
4. Choose the type of numbering that you want.
5. Click OK.
You can click the Customize tab to change the color, size, and format of the
numbers.

Chapter 14: Modifying a Presentation 

Formatting Paragraphs
Just as you can format paragraphs in a word processor, you can format para-
graphs in Impress. You can change the margins, alignment, and line spacing.
Because a presentation is so graphical in nature, you want to make sure that
your paragraphs look orderly.
Lining up with the ruler
The easiest and most direct way to set the margins is to use the horizontal
ruler that’s above each slide. If you don’t see this ruler, choose View➪Rulers to
make it appear. You also use the ruler to set indents, as shown in Figure 14-3.
The gray area at the left and right edges of the horizontal ruler defines the
slide’s margins. You can drag the edges of the gray area to change the margins.
To change indents, use the indent markers. The top marker sets the indent
for the first line only. For bulleted lists, this marker is to the left of the bottom
marker and creates a hanging indent. The top marker determines the position
of the bullets. To change the bullet position, click and drag the top marker to
the left or right.
Figure 14-3:
Use the
horizontal
ruler to 
set your
margins and
indents.
246
Part IV: Using Impress — The Presentation Package 

The bottom marker sets the indent for the rest of the lines of the paragraph.
In bulleted text, this marker sets the position of the left side of the text,
which is to the right of the top marker. To move the text, press Ctrl and drag
the bottom marker to the left or right. Use this technique to move the text in
relation to the bullets.
Aligning text
While most text is left-aligned — that is, the text along the left margin lines
up — headings are often centered. Occasionally, you may want to right-align
text. You can also justify text. This forces the text to reach both the left and
right margins on each line, but justified text sometimes places too much
space between the words and may look strange for bulleted text.
To align text, select the text and choose one of the alignment buttons on the
Object toolbar.
Spacing your lines
If you need to fit just a little more text on a slide or expand your text so that it
doesn’t look lost, you should adjust the line spacing. Select the text and
choose Format➪Paragraph to open the Paragraph dialog box. Click the
Indents & Spacing tab, as shown in Figure 14-4.
Use the Spacing panel to change the spacing before or after a paragraph. This
panel affects the spacing between paragraphs.
Figure 14-4:
The Indents
& Spacing
tab of the
Paragraph
dialog box.
247
Chapter 14: Modifying a Presentation 

Use the Line Spacing panel to change the line spacing within a paragraph.
Choose one of the options from the drop-down list. To set exact line spacing,
use the At Least option and enter a distance in the text box. You can experi-
ment with various spacing until you get the look that you want.
Using Master View
The Master view is the key that controls the look of your entire presentation.
In Chapter 13, we explain the various modes, one of which is Master view. To
enter Master view, click the Master view icon at the lower-left corner of your
screen or choose View➪Master➪Drawing, as shown in Figure 14-5.
Typically, you would specify the following items in Master view:
 Background: Choose Format➪Page and click the Background tab. You can
use a solid color, gradient, bitmap image, or hatch (repetitive pattern).
 Fonts: Choose Format➪Character or use the Object toolbar to choose
font type, size, and color. You can separately format the title and the bul-
leted text.
Figure 14-5:
Use Master
view mode
to set up the
design of
your entire
presen-
tation.
248
Part IV: Using Impress — The Presentation Package 

 Bullets: Choose Format➪Numbering/Bullets. We explain how to format
bullets in the section “Choosing bullets,” earlier in this chapter.
 Graphics: Choose Insert➪Graphics➪From File to insert logos or other
graphics. You can also use the drawing tools to create your own.
In the same way, you can specify the look for title slides, notes pages, and
handouts. Choose View➪Master➪Title, Notes, or Handout.
When you have completed setting up your master slide, you may want to
save the presentation as a template so that you can use it again easily. For
detailed instructions on saving a presentation as a template, see Chapter 13.
If you start with a template, your master slide may be just what you need
already. If not, go to Master view before you design your presentation to
create the overall look in advance. It’s better to make changes on the master
slide than on individual slides. If you later decide to change the bullets, for
example, you can change them once on the master slide, instead of changing
them on each slide.

 Using graphics
 Editing graphics
 Working with colors
 Adding 3-D effects
T
ext alone is not enough for a presentation. To effectively communicate,
you should add graphics and choose color to enhance your message.
Most professional presentations include graphics on at least 50 percent of
the slides. As you compose your presentation, think about what kind of art,
photos, and drawings could add an extra element of interest and detail.
Adding Images
Inserting a photo of a product helps your audience visualize what you’re
trying to sell them. Placing a colored rectangle behind some text makes the
text stand out. Adding some clip art of a flower livens up your presentation,
especially if you’re trying to sell florist’s ribbon. Each type of graphic has a
different effect, depending on how you use it.
To decide what type of graphics you should use, pay attention to other pre-
sentations. Look at brochures and Web sites, and get a feel for the effect of
combining various types of art with text.
Clipping art
Clip art is drawn artwork that you can insert onto any slide. You can find clip
art on the Web, both for free and for purchase. You can also buy collections

of clip art on CD-ROMs or DVDs. Clip art can be humorous, such as when you
use a light bulb to represent creativity, or iconic, such as when you use an
arrow to depict a process. Clip art can also evoke a theme or certain feelings.
For example, if you’re selling garden furniture, you may want clip art of flow-
ers and plants on each slide to set the right mood.
You need to be careful that you don’t use copyrighted artwork without per-
mission. If you find art on a Web site, be sure to read the terms of use.
If you find clip art on the Web, you can download it to your computer. If you
have the clip art on a CD-ROM or DVD, you can insert the clip art directly
from the disc. Each image is a separate file.
The procedure for inserting a graphic is the same in Impress as it is in Writer.
For detailed steps, see the section “Inserting Graphics,” in Chapter 5.
When you insert clip art, the image appears at the center of your slide, with
eight small square handles around it, as shown in Figure 15-1.
You can immediately drag the image to a new location on the slide and resize
the image if you want.
You can use any of OpenOffice.org’s editing tools to recolor, rotate, filter, and
flip the clip art, among other possibilities. We explain how to edit graphic
images in Chapter 5.

inserted

252
Part IV: Using Impress — The Presentation Package 

Drawing objects
OpenOffice.org has a full complement of drawing objects that you can place
on a slide. Impress users often use rectangles, circles, and other shapes
behind text to emphasize text and hold text together. Arrows can point out
important points, and connectors can create flow charts and other diagrams.
You should adjust the color of these objects to match the colors of your
background and text. Always make sure that text is clearly visible on a shape.
You can change both the fill and line colors of a shape such as a circle or a
rectangle. Of course, arrows and lines don’t have a fill color.
You can find all the information you need about creating and editing these
drawing objects in the section “Inserting Graphics,” in Chapter 5. Don’t forget
to check out the section “Using the Gallery,” also in Chapter 5, for informa-
tion on saving your drawing objects for future use.
You can also create objects using OpenOffice.org’s Draw program and insert
them into your presentations. We cover Draw in Chapter 18.
Coloring Backgrounds
An important part of the look of your presentation is the background of your
slide. People often think of the background as the main part of the template,
although a template also includes font formatting and may include some text
content. However, regardless of the background of your template, you can
add new backgrounds to your heart’s content.
Be careful when adding backgrounds. You typically don’t want to use a differ-
ent background for each slide. However, a little variety can keep your audi-
ence awake and emphasize certain slides.
To change a background for the entire presentation, use Master view mode.
Choose View➪Master➪Drawing. Then follow the directions in the next few
sections for changing a slide background. When you change a background in
Slide mode, OpenOffice.org asks you whether you want to change the back-
ground for the entire presentation or for just one slide. If you choose to
change the background for the entire presentation, OpenOffice.org changes
the master slide for you.
If you change the background for one slide and then change the background
for the entire presentation, the background for the one slide that you
changed remains unchanged. Changes to individual slides override changes
to the master slide.
253
Chapter 15: Making Presentations Picture Perfect 

Creating a plain-colored background
You can simply choose a color as a background for a slide. Maybe it’s a little
boring, but it’s certainly simple. To use a colored background, follow these
steps:
1. Display the slide.
2. Choose Format➪Page, and click the Background tab.
The Page Setup dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 15-2.
3. In the Fill panel, select the Color option button.
4. Choose a color from the list of colors.
5. Click OK.
A message appears asking whether you want to use these background
settings for all the pages.
6. To change the background for all the slides, click Yes. To change only
the slide that you displayed, click No.
If you can find the color that you are looking for, you can define your own
color. For detailed instructions on how to define a color, see “Coloring con-
summately” in Chapter 18.
Creating a gradient background
A gradient gradually changes from one color to another. Gradients are often
used as backgrounds for presentations. However, make sure that your text
shows up well against both colors. To use a gradient background, follow
these steps:
Figure 15-2:
The
Background
tab of the
Page Setup
dialog box.
254
Part IV: Using Impress — The Presentation Package 

1. Display the slide.
2. Choose Format➪Page, and click the Background tab.
The Page Setup dialog box opens, as shown previously in Figure 15-2.
3. In the Fill panel, select the Gradient option button.
4. Choose a gradient from the list of gradients.
5. Click OK.
A message appears asking whether you want the background settings
for all the pages.
6. To change the background for all the slides, click Yes. To change only
the slide that you displayed, click No.
You can create your own gradients in a number of styles from any two colors.
For detailed steps, see Chapter 18. Once you create and save your gradient, it
appears in the Page Setup dialog box so that you can choose it.
Hatching a background
A hatch is a pattern made up of parallel lines. You can change the pattern by
changing the spacing, angle, and color of the lines. Hatches rarely work well
on a slide because they interfere with the legibility of text. To create a
hatched background, follow these steps:
1. Display the slide.
2. Choose Format➪Page, and click the Background tab.
The Page Setup dialog box opens, as shown previously in Figure 15-2.
3. In the Fill panel, select the Hatching option button.
4. Choose a hatch from the list of hatches.
5. Click OK.
A message appears asking whether you want the background settings
for all the pages.
6. To change the background for all the slides, click Yes. To change only
the slide that you displayed, click No.
You can create custom hatches, as explained in Chapter 18. A hatch that you
create and save appears in the list of hatches so that you can choose it as a
background.
255
Chapter 15: Making Presentations Picture Perfect 

Using a bitmap image as a background
Perhaps the most common type of background is an image or photo. The
photo is often recolored to match the presentation’s color scheme and soft-
ened so that it doesn’t take attention away from the text. OpenOffice.org
includes a set of repetitive bitmap images that are soft enough to use as slide
backgrounds. To use one of these bitmaps as a background, follow these steps:
1. Display the slide.
2. Choose Format➪Page, and click the Background tab.
The Page Setup dialog box opens, as shown previously in Figure 15-2.
3. In the Fill panel, select the Bitmap option button.
4. Choose a bitmap from the list of bitmaps.
5. To fit the bitmap over the entire slide, in the Position panel, deselect
the Tile check box and select the AutoFit check box.
6. Click OK.
A message appears asking whether you want the background settings
for all the pages.
7. To change the background for all the slides, click Yes. To change only
the slide that you displayed, click No.
Importing your own image file as a background
To use your own image file, you need to open the Area dialog box and import
the image there. The image then appears in the Page Setup dialog box list.
Follow these steps to import a bitmap image for use as a background:
1. Choose Format➪Area, and click the Bitmaps tab.
The Area dialog box opens, with the Bitmaps tab on top.
2. Click the Import button.
The Import dialog box opens.
3. Locate the file that you want to use, and click Open.
You are returned to the Area dialog box.
4. Click OK to return to your presentation.
Customizing your image
You can use OpenOffice.org to colorize an image so that it works better as a
background. For example, you may want to use the floor plan that’s shown in
Figure 15-3 as a background.
256
Part IV: Using Impress — The Presentation Package 

The problem is that the floor plan has both light and dark areas, so some text
won’t show clearly. You need to color the image, so that it’s mostly blue, and
soften it a bit. This procedure involves a number of steps, but they’re all easy.
Follow these steps to colorize and soften the bitmap:
1. With any slide displayed, choose Insert➪Graphics.
The Insert Graphics dialog box opens.
2. Locate the file that you want to use, choose it, and click Open.
The image appears on your slide, selected.
3. Use the following controls on the Object toolbar to edit the photo or
other image:
• Red RGB: Adjust the value to vary the amount of red in the image. To
make a blue image, reduce this value close to nearly 0%.
• Green RGB: Adjust the value to vary the amount of green in the image.
To make a blue image, reduce this value to nearly 0%.
• Blue RGB: Adjust the value to vary the amount of blue in the image. To
make a blue image, increase this value to nearly 100%.
• Brightness: Adjust the value to make the image lighter (brighter) or
darker. For a dark blue image, reduce the value below 0%.
Figure 15-3:
You can use
this floor
plan as a
background.
257
Chapter 15: Making Presentations Picture Perfect 

• Contrast: Increase the contrast to make the lights lighter and darks
darker (more contrast) or decrease the contrast to make the image more
monochrome. For a blue image, reduce the value below 0%.
• Gamma: Increase the gamma to make the medium and dark tones
brighter and decrease it to make them darker. For a dark blue image,
decrease the gamma. You need to fiddle with the gamma to get the right
value, which varies with the image.
You can also crop the image. Click the Crop button at the right end of
the Object toolbar, and use the Crop dialog box to cut off unwanted
edges of the image.
• Filter: Choose one of the effects from the Filter floating toolbar. You can
click the Soften button to get a softer effect for a background. The result
of our editing is shown in Figure 15-4.
4. With your image still selected, choose File➪Export.
The Export dialog box opens.
5. From the File Format drop-down list, choose the file format that you
want. Select the Selection check box to export only the selected
image.
The JPEG format is often used for photographs. Other common bitmap
formats are GIF and PNG.
6. In the File Name text box, enter a name for the image.
7. Click Save.
Depending on the format that you chose, a dialog box offering save
options may appear. These options control the quality and features of
the image.
8. Specify the settings that you want, if applicable, and click OK.
9. To import the image into the bitmap list, choose Format➪Area and
click the Bitmaps tab.
The Area dialog box opens.
10. Click the Import button, find the file that you want, and click Open.
The Name dialog box opens.
11. Enter a name for the bitmap, and click OK twice to return to your 
presentation.
OpenOffice.org adds the bitmap image to the list of bitmaps. 
12. Choose Format➪Page, and select the Bitmap option button.
13. Choose your bitmap from the bitmap list.
Set the parameters that you want in the Size and Position panels of the
Page Setup dialog box. For example, to fit the image over the entire slide,
deselect Tile and select AutoFit.
258
Part IV: Using Impress — The Presentation Package 

14. Click OK.
A message appears asking whether you want to use the background for
all the pages (slides).
15. Click Yes to place the image on all the slides, or click No to place the
image on the displayed slide only.
You now have a suitable image that you can use as a background for your
presentation.
Applying a design template
You can also add a background by applying a different design template.
Follow these steps to apply a design template:
1. Choose Format➪Styles➪Slide Design.
The Slide Design dialog box opens.
2. Click the Load button.
The Load Slide Design dialog box opens.

7. Click OK to return to your presentation.
Adding a Coolness Factor with 3-D
OpenOffice.org has a great complement of 3-D objects and features that you
can use to make your presentations pop out from its slides. You can use 3-D
effects for both text and graphic objects. You can also create shadows to add
a subtle 3-D effect.
Creating 3-D text
A shadow on text gives the impression that the text is slightly above the
slide. Figure 15-5 shows some text with and without a shadow.
To add a shadow, follow these steps:
1. Select the text.
2. Choose Format➪Character.
The Character dialog box opens.
3. Click the Font Effects tab.
4. Select the Shadow check box.
5. Click OK.
You can also right-click and choose Style➪Shadow from the shortcut menu
that appears.

Chapter 15: Making Presentations Picture Perfect 

You can convert text to a 3-D object. However, once you do this, you cannot
edit the text — it becomes a graphic object. The text must be in a text frame,
not a text placeholder. For more information on creating text in text frames,
see Chapter 12. To convert text to 3-D text, follow these steps:
1. Click the text frame.
2. The text displays a border, and you see the cursor inside the text.
3. Click the border to remove the cursor and display only the eight 
handles.
4. Right-click the text, and choose Convert➪To 3D from the shortcut
menu that appears.
Figure 15-6 shows some text before and after converting to 3-D. Be careful —
text can be hard to read in 3-D. You can adjust the depth and other features of
your 3-D text to help make it more readable. For exact instructions, see the
section “3-D Basics” in Chapter 16.
Inserting 3-D objects
You can insert 3-D objects, such as boxes and cylinders, onto your slide using
the 3D Objects floating toolbar. Long-click the 3D Objects icon on the Main
toolbar to find these objects. Click any 3-D object, and drag on your slide to
insert the shape. You can place a text frame on top of a 3-D shape so that the
3-D shape appears to have text on it, as shown in Figure 15-7.
For advanced techniques on using 3-D objects, see the section “3-D Basics” in
Chapter 18.
You can add shadows to your 3-D objects. OpenOffice.org comes with some
preset shadow styles that you can quickly apply to your objects. Follow these
steps to add shadows to your 3-D objects:
1. Select the 3-D object.
2. Click the 3D Effects button on the Main toolbar, or choose
Format➪3D Effects.
The 3D Effects dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 15-8.
3. Click the Favorites button (the leftmost button at the top of the
dialog box).
4. Click one of the effects that includes a shadow.
5. Click Apply.
6. Close the 3D Effects dialog box.
OpenOffice.org applies the shadow effect to your 3-D shape.

Animating Impressively
In This Chapter
 Adding effects to text
 Incorporating sound
 Animating objects
 Animating GIF files
 Adding slide transitions
M
ovement catches the eye and wakes up your audience. Animation can
be very effective when used appropriately. You can also add sound or
music to a presentation or a specific slide. In this chapter, we explain how to
add motion to text, objects, and the transition from slide to slide.
Using Text Effects Effectively
OpenOffice.org offers two types of animation for text. One type creates
moving text like you would see in a ticker tape — the text moves across the
screen. We explain this type of animation in this section.
The other type of animation applies to both text and objects and governs
how these items appear. Text and objects can fly in from the left, simply
appear, or dissolve into existence. We discuss this type of animation in the
next section.
Text effects are simple but you should use them judiciously. These effects
only apply to text in text frames; you can’t apply these text effects to text in
placeholders. OpenOffice.org offers the following text effects:
 Blink: The text blinks on.
 Scroll Through: Scrolls into view and continues through to the other
side, disappearing there.

 Scroll Back and Forth: Scrolls into view, continues to the other side,
and then scrolls back in the opposite direction. You need to specify at
least two cycles for this effect to work.
 Scroll In: Scrolls into view and remains in view.
To add a text effect, follow these steps:
1. Create text in a text frame.
2. With the text frame selected, choose Format➪Text.
This menu item is only available if you have selected a text frame. The
Text dialog box opens.
3. Click the Text Animation tab, as shown in Figure 16-1.
4. From the Effect drop-down list, choose one of the effects.
5. Click one of the arrows to specify the direction of the scroll.
6. In the Properties panel, choose the properties that you want for the
effect.
You may have to test a few property options to get the results that you
want. For example, the Scroll Through effect normally starts the text
from the edge of the text frame, but if you select the Start inside check
box, the text starts from the middle of the frame, completely visible, and
then scrolls in the direction that you choose. Under Animation cycles,
you can repeat the effect. You can also specify a delay in milliseconds.
7. Click OK to return to your presentation.
8. Click the Slide Show View button to view the animation.
Figure 16-1:

266
Part IV: Using Impress — The Presentation Package 

9. When you are done previewing the animation, press Esc to return to
Drawing view.
Creating Animation Effects
You can animate how both text and objects appear on a slide. For example,
you can make bulleted text appear line by line as you click the mouse so
that your audience sees each line as you discuss it. After the animation, you
can make the object change color or disappear. You can even move an object
along a path. To animate an object, follow these steps:
1. Select the object that you want to animate.
For text in a text placeholder, select the entire placeholder — you don’t
need to highlight the text itself.
2. Choose Slide Show➪Effects or click the Animation Effects button on
the Main toolbar.
The Animation Effects dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 16-2.
3. Click the Effects button in the Animation Effects dialog box.
4. Choose an effect from the Effects drop-down list or from the icons in
the large panel (Favorites), or choose Other from the drop-down list
for another set of available effects.
When you click an icon, the name of its animation appears at the bottom
of the Animation Effects dialog box.
Figure 16-2:

267
Chapter 16: Animating Impressively 

5. If a set of variations appears in the large panel, choose a variation.
6. From the Speed drop-down list at the bottom of the dialog box, choose
a speed.
7. If you selected text, click the Text Effects button and choose an effect
for the text, using the same method as described in Steps 4 through 6.
These text effects are like the text effects for objects. They are not the
blinking or scrolling effects that you can create for text frames.
8. To specify sound effects and aftereffects, click the Extras button at the
top of the Animation Effects dialog box.
Many animations automatically come with a sound. If you don’t want the
sound, click the Extras button to turn off the sound.
9. To add an aftereffect, in the Extras panel, either
• Click the Object Invisible button to make the object disappear after
animation.
• Click the Fade Object with Color button to change the object’s
color after animation.
If you fade the object, choose a color from the drop-down list.
10. To add a sound that plays during the animation, click the Sound
button and choose a sound from the drop-down list. To add your own
sound file, click the Open button, locate the sound file, and click
Open.
OpenOffice.org comes with a good assortment of sounds. When you
click the Open button, you are automatically in the folder that contains
the OpenOffice.org sound gallery.
11. To remove a sound, click the Sound button so that it does not appear
selected (indented).
12. To assign the sound to the selected object, click Assign.
13. To view the animation in Slide Show view, click the Slide Show View
button in the upper-right corner of your screen.
You can go into Slide Show view, view your animation, and return to
Drawing view without closing the Animation Effects dialog box. Leaving
the dialog box open allows you to go back and make adjustments as you
work.
To change the order of animation, click the Order button in the Animation
Effects dialog box. Select an object, and drag it to a new position.
To remove animation from an object, select the object and choose the first
icon, called No Effect, from the Favorites collection of icons in the Animation
Effects dialog box.
268
Part IV: Using Impress — The Presentation Package 

Adding Sound Bytes
Sounds can create a mood or add humor to a presentation. You can add a
simple sound or play music. As described in the previous section, you can
add a sound to an animation effect. You can also add a sound to a slide transi-
tion, as explained later in this chapter. In this section, we explain how to
insert a sound object into a slide.
You can add a sound to a slide in the following formats:
 .au/.snd (SUN/NeXT audio)
 .wav (Microsoft Windows audio)
 .voc (Creative Labs/Soundblaster audio)
 .aiff (SGI/Apple audio)
 .iff (Amiga audio)
To insert a sound, follow these steps:
1. Choose Insert➪Object➪Sound.
The Insert Sound dialog box opens.
2. Locate the sound that you want, and select it.
3. Click the Insert button.
A sound icon appears on your slide.
Creating Animated GIF Files
A GIF file is a bitmap graphic file. An animated GIF file is a series of small GIF
files that differ slightly from each other. An application or browser displays
the GIF files quickly in order, giving the appearance of animation. Many ads
that you see on the Internet are created using animated GIF files.
OpenOffice.org contains a GIF animator that you can use to create animations
for your presentations. You can create drawing objects using OpenOffice.org’s
tools, or you can import bitmap images. The overall process is simple — you
put all the images on a slide, add each image in order to the animation, and
set the timing for each image. Follow these steps to create an animated GIF
for your presentation:
269
Chapter 16: Animating Impressively 

1. Create or insert all the images that you want to use on a slide.
To create an animation effect, the images are usually similar, with just
slight differences. You don’t have a great deal of control over the place-
ment of the objects, so your animation needs to emphasize shape
changes rather than movement.
2. Choose Slide Show➪Animation.
The Animation dialog box opens.
3. Select the first object for the animation.
You can select objects on your slide while the Animation dialog box is
open.
4. Click the Apply Object button to add the image as one frame in the
animation.
The object appears in the Preview pane, as shown in Figure 16-3.
If you line up all your images in the order that you want to insert them in
the animation, you can select them all at once by dragging across them
all and then clicking the Apply Objects Individually button, which is to
the right of the Apply Object button. In this way, you can create an
entire animation in one fell swoop.
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 to add additional objects to the animation until
you have all the objects that you need.
As you add objects, you see the frame number increase in the middle of
the Animation dialog box.
6. In the Animation group panel, select the Bitmap object option button.
7. To set the timing for each frame, click the small down arrow to the
right of the frame number to return to Frame 1.
Figure 16-3:
The
Animation
dialog box
allows you
to create
animated
GIF files.
270
Part IV: Using Impress — The Presentation Package 

8. Set the timing for Frame 1 in the Duration box to the right of the
frame number.
The frames must be short to give the appearance of animation. The unit
of the Duration box is seconds, so a setting of 1.00 is 1 second. You can
try setting each frame to 0.05 or 0.1 as a start.
9. Increase the frame number by 1, and set the duration for each of the
frames in your animation.
10. To repeat (loop) your animation, set the number of times in the Loop
Count box, which is to the right of the Duration box.
11. Click the Create button to create the animated GIF file.
The new animation appears on your screen.
12. You can now delete all the objects that you used for your animation,
or you can drag them off the slide if you want to save them.
13. To play the animation in the Animation dialog box, set the frame
number in the Frame box to 1 and click the Play button. To see the
slide in Slide Show view, click the Slide Show View button in the
upper-right corner of your screen.
As you work, you can delete an image in a frame by displaying it in the
Animation dialog box and clicking the Delete Current Image button. To
change an animation after you have created it, select the animation, choose
Slide Show➪Animation to open the Animation dialog box, make the changes
that you want, and resave it (by clicking Create) as a new animation.
Adding Slide Transition Effects
You can add effects that determine how a slide appears. For example, the
slide can move in from the left or right or materialize into view. You can add a
different transition to each slide (it’s a little nerve-racking!) or add one transi-
tion to all your slides. Use discretion with slide transitions, and keep them
simple. Follow these steps to add a transition:
1. Use one of these options to select one or more slides:
• Switch to Slides view and drag across the slides to select them (or
choose Edit➪Select All).
• Select the slide that you want to work with.
2. Choose Slide Show➪Slide Transition to open the Slide Transition
dialog box, as shown in Figure 16-4.
271
Chapter 16: Animating Impressively 

3. Click the Animation Effects button in the Slide Transition dialog box.
4. Choose an animation by doing one of the following:
• Choose one of the animations in the pane.
• Choose an animation from the Effects drop-down list.
• Choose Other from the Effects drop-down list, and then choose
one of the animations in the pane.
When you click an animation in the pane, the title appears at the bottom
of the dialog box.
5. If you choose an animation from the drop-down list and variations
appear in the pane, choose one of the variations.
6. Click the Additional Options button in the Slide Transition dialog box.
7. In the Extras panel, choose one of the following options:
• Automatic: The slide advances automatically after the time that
you set in the text box. Animation effects for objects also play
automatically.
• Semiautomatic: The slide advances automatically after the time
that you set in the text box, but animation effects for objects only
play when you click the mouse.
Figure 16-4:
The Slide
Transition
dialog box.
272
Part IV: Using Impress — The Presentation Package 

• Manual: Both slide animation and object animation occur only
when you click the mouse.
8. To choose a sound for the slide transition, click the Sound button and
choose a sound from the drop-down list.
Most transitions come with a sound. If the Sound button is selected
(indented), you have a sound. To remove the sound, click the Sound
button (so that it is no longer indented).
A sound that plays each time you advance a slide can get annoying. In
most cases, you want to remove the sound.
9. Click the Apply button to apply the slide transition and any effects to
the selected slides.
If you are in Slides view, you see a small icon at the lower-left corner of
each selected slide, indicating that it has a slide transition.
Play your presentation in Slide Show view to check out your new slide 
transitions.
To delete slide transitions, follow these steps:
1. Select the slide or slides.
2. Choose Slide Show➪Slide Transition.
3. Choose Favorites from the drop-down list.
4. Choose the first icon, No Effect.
5. Click Apply.

Chapter 17
Showing a Presentation
In This Chapter
 Preparing to deliver your presentation
 Presenting your slide show
 Printing slides, notes, and handouts
You have worked hard and finally completed a beautiful and compelling
presentation. Now you need to deliver it to your audience. Before you
jump right in, you should practice several times until your delivery is smooth
and comfortable. Only then should you get in front of an audience.
Preparing to Deliver a Slide Show
Practice makes perfect. Your presentation is important, and the quality of
your delivery is a major factor in the success of your presentation. (The
other two factors are your content, including its organization, and the
look/layout of the presentation.)
To practice, start by going into Slide Show view (choose Slide Show➪
Slide Show) and run through the presentation, speaking out loud to your
computer, which is your imaginary audience. (Don’t worry about what your
neighbors think.) The expression slide show is often used to indicate a pre-
sentation in Slide Show mode but slide show and presentation can also be
used as synonyms.
The second step is to practice with the equipment that you plan to use,
including the computer and projector, for example. This step is crucial. We’ve
seen too many disasters, or near disasters (staying up late the night before
trying to find a computer that is powerful enough to play a large presenta-
tion), that could have been prevented by practicing the entire presentation in
advance using the final equipment.
The final step is to practice in your final venue, if possible. This step gives
you the opportunity to check out the seating, determine where to put the

projector, see where to stand, know how to set the temperature of the room,
and so on.
Setting slide timing
If you want your presentation to advance automatically, you need to set the
time for each slide to be viewed. If you are delivering a presentation yourself,
you may not want to set slide times. You typically set timings for self-running
presentations, such as those that you may use at a convention or in lobbies.
To set slide timing, follow these steps:
1. Choose View➪Workspace➪Slides View to enter Slides view.
If necessary, click the first slide so that you start from the beginning.
2. Click the Rehearse Timings button on the Object toolbar.
OpenOffice.org automatically places you in Slide Show view so that you
see your presentation full-screen. You see a timer at the lower-left corner
of your screen.
3. Start speaking out loud if you plan to use the automatic timings for a
presentation that you plan to deliver. Pretend that you are talking to
an audience.
To determine the timings for a self-running presentation, you can read
the presentation to get an idea of how much time your audience will
need to read each slide.
4. When you think it’s time to move to the next slide, click the timer.
Don’t just click the slide — you have to click the timer itself.
OpenOffice.org advances to the next slide.
5. Continue Steps 3 and 4 until you finish the presentation.
You now return to Slides view. You can click any slide and see its timing on
the Object toolbar. You can manually change the setting for any slide by
changing the number in the Timings text box of the Object toolbar.
You don’t need to use the timings that you set. As explained in the section
“Specifying slide show settings,” later in this chapter, you can decide to
advance each slide manually if you want.
Hiding slides
You may want to create variations of your presentation for different audi-
ences or to include slides that you plan to show only if your audience indi-
cates some interest in a specific topic. To hide a slide, follow these steps:
276
Part IV: Using Impress — The Presentation Package 

1. Go into Slides view (choose View➪Workspace➪Slides View).
2. Click the slide that you want to hide.
3. Choose Slide Show➪Show/Hide Slide.
Specifying slide show settings
You can specify a number of settings that determine what happens when you
present your slide show. For example, you may have created timings for your
slides for practice purposes, but you may not want to use these timings when
you actually present. Follow these steps:
1. Choose Slide Show➪Slide Show Settings.
The Slide Show Settings dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 17-1.
2. In the Range panel, click From and choose a slide if you don’t want to
start from the first slide.
Otherwise, keep the default setting of All Slides.
3. In the Type panel, choose Default, which plays the presentation once
full-screen.
To play the presentation in the OpenOffice.org application window,
choose Window. To automatically loop the slide, choose Auto. If you want
a delay between repetitions, enter an amount in the Timing text box.
4. In the Options panel, specify the following settings:
• Change slides manually: Select this check box to ensure that
OpenOffice.org ignores timings that you have set and only
advances slides when you use the mouse or a keyboard shortcut
to advance a slide.
Figure 17-1:

Chapter 17: Showing a Presentation

• Mouse pointer visible: Selected by default, this setting displays
the mouse pointer in Slide Show view. Deselect this check box to
hide the mouse pointer. If you have hyperlinks or other objects
that you need to click, you should leave the mouse pointer visible;
otherwise, you may not need it.
• Mouse pointer as pen: If you display the mouse pointer, you can
initially display it as a pen so that you can annotate a slide. We
explain how to annotate a slide later in this chapter.
• Navigator visible: Starts the slide show with the Navigator visible.
We explain how to use the Navigator during a slide show later in
this chapter.
• Animations allowed: Plays any animations that you created.
Deselect this check box to disable animations.
• Change slides by clicking on background: Advances a slide when
you click it. This is the default.
• Presentation always on top: Disallows other application windows
from appearing in front of your presentation.
5. Click OK.
Delivering a Slide Show
You’re all ready to go. Now you just need to get up in front of that audience
and speak. Easier said than done, yes? Actually, it’s not that bad. If you have
practiced and are well prepared, everything will go more easily. If possible,
spend a couple of minutes chatting with individual members of the audience
as they come into the room so that it doesn’t seem like you’re addressing a
faceless crowd.
Have your presentation already open and in Slide Show view before you start.
You can black out the screen by pressing B, as we explain later, until you are
ready to start. Then press B again to display your first slide.
Using a mouse and keyboard
to run your slide show
When you go into Slide Show view to deliver a presentation, you don’t have
any menus or toolbars, so you need to know how to navigate. Usually, you
just need to click the mouse to advance to the next animation or next slide.

You can also use the Navigator when you present. Press F5 to open the
Navigator, as shown in Figure 17-2.
To go to any slide listed, double-click the slide. If you plan to use the
Navigator, you should name your slides. Slide 1, Slide 2, and so on are not
helpful names. To name a slide, right-click a slide’s tab in Drawing view and
choose Rename Slide from the shortcut menu that appears. A good practice
is to name the slide based on its title text.
You probably don’t want to use the Navigator all the time because it
obstructs part of your slides, but for special situations, the Navigator can be
a lifesaver.

Annotating a slide
You can temporarily draw on a slide to emphasize a point, as shown in Figure
17-3. Okay, it’s hard to make it look good, but maybe your audience doesn’t
mind. This type of annotation doesn’t last — if you go to the next slide and
then return to the annotated slide, your annotation marks are gone.

Part IV: Using Impress — The Presentation Package 

To annotate a slide, click the Annotation Pen button in the Navigator. You can
then close the Navigator if you want. However, to get rid of the pen cursor,
you need to reopen the Navigator and click the Annotation Pen button again.
Editing in Slide Show view
A nice feature enables you to edit slides while in Slide Show view. You may
find this invaluable in an informal situation such as a brainstorming session.
For example, you can include a slide with a text placeholder and start writing
down the ideas that your group comes up with.
Because you don’t have menus or toolbars, your options are somewhat lim-
ited. For example, you can’t insert a new text frame. But you can edit what’s
already on the slide, and if you have a slide with an empty placeholder, you
can add text to the placeholder. Just click to select the placeholder and start
typing.
You can access the shortcut (context) menu, however. The shortcut menu
contains commands to cut, copy, and paste as well as commands for many
formatting options. For example, you can change the font of the text that you
have entered.
To edit in Slide Show view, click the Live Mode button in the Navigator. You
don’t need to keep the Navigator open while you edit your slide. Press F5 to
close the Navigator.
Printing presentations
You may never need to print a presentation. On the other hand, printing a
presentation has many uses. You can print
 Handouts to give to your audience that contain images of each slide.
 Notes for yourself to help tell you what to say for each slide.
 The outline (the text without any graphics).
 A paper presentation to give to someone for review, if the person doesn’t
have Impress or another presentation program.
For information on saving your Impress presentation in another format, see
Chapter 15. For example, if a colleague has PowerPoint, you can save a copy
of the presentation in PowerPoint format and e-mail the presentation as an
attachment instead of printing and mailing the presentation.

Printing slides
You can simply print your slides. To print one or more slides in your presen-
tation, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Print.
The Print dialog box opens. By default, OpenOffice.org prints the entire
presentation, one slide on each sheet of paper.
2. To specify specific slides, click Pages in the Print Range panel of the
Print dialog box and enter the pages that you want to print.
3. Click OK.
4. Click the Options button, as shown in Figure 17-4, in the Print dialog
box to open the Printer Options dialog box.
5. In the Contents panel, choose what you want to print, as follows:
• Drawing: Prints the slides.
• Notes: Prints the presentation as it looks in Notes view. This
includes the slide at the top and an area for text at the bottom.
• Handouts: Prints one or more handouts on a page. To change 
the number of slides that print on a page, choose Format➪
Modify Layout while you are in Handouts view.
• Outline: Prints only the text.
6. In the Quality panel of the Printer Options dialog box, choose
whether to print in color (the default mode), in grayscale, or in black
and white.
7. In the Print panel, choose whether to add the page name, date, and
time to each slide.
You can also choose whether to include hidden slides. (We explain
hidden slides earlier in this chapter.)
8. In the Print Options panel, choose whether to print one slide per
page, scale slides to fit the page, tile pages (if your slides are larger
than your paper), or create a brochure.
9. Click OK when you are finished setting the printer options to return
to the Printer dialog box.
10. Click OK to print.

Using Draw — The

In this part . . .
O
penOfﬁce.org Draw is a serious drawing program for
serious artists, yet it’s easy enough even for a child to
use. With Draw, you can make those images that are crystal
clear in your mind become a reality on the computer screen.
It’s never been easier to become an artist. 
Draw has an enormous number of uses. It can be used for
Web design, graphic design, architectural drawings and so
much more. You can use it to create and edit 3-D images and
map textures onto them. You can design your own logo. You
can import and manipulate photographic images. You can
choose from millions of colors and create customized lists
of colors, or use ready-made lists of colors. You can also
specify your own gradient colors and use them to make
your art look so real you feel you can reach in and touch
it. Or generate gradient transparencies to create glowing
effects. You can animate text and use the cross-fade tool
to create images that can be animated in Impress. You can
use layers, which enable you to trace shapes and objects.
The uses of Draw are inﬁnite. And the best thing about it
is that it’s all easy, and in this part we show you how.

I
n this chapter, you enter the amazing world of Draw. Even if you have no
training in art, with Draw you can create beautiful graphics for memos,
presentations, or brochures; for posters or Web sites; or even for books. You
don’t need to buy disks of clip art and search through huge piles of images.
You don’t need to feel guilty about swiping an image from someone’s Web site
for your own use. Make your own images! It’s easy. Even combining a few
lines, shapes, and colors or gradients is enough to make some beautifully
expressive designs.
In this chapter, we show you how to use Draw to “get graphic,” using lines
and arrows and shapes, and how to combine, subtract, and intersect shapes
to make complex images. We show you how to use the Distort tool to create
wavy curves without even touching the curve tool, and we show you the
secret powers of the Duplication tool and many others.
Finally, we discuss how to define your own colors and how to use gradients,
bitmaps, hatchings, glows, and transparencies to give a polished, profes-
sional look to your art.
Getting Graphic
A great way to get acquainted with Draw is to start playing around with lines
and arrows.

Lines and arrows
Draw offers you the ability to draw almost any kind of line or arrow that you
could possibly imagine. You can specify the thickness, color, and transparency
of each line, and you can choose whether you want the line to be continuous,
dotted, or dashed. You can even choose the exact number of dots/dashes/
spaces combinations and transparencies of your lines or arrows.
 When you long-click (click and hold for a moment) the Lines and Arrows
icon on the Main toolbar, the draggable toolbar appears with two line-
option icons and several arrow-option icons. (If the Main toolbar is not
visible, choose View➪Toolbars➪Main Toolbar.)
 The \ icon lets you draw lines at any angle that you want. Click this icon,
and then click and drag in the drawing window to create your line.
To make your line larger or smaller, just select it and pull the handles to
readjust the size of the line.
 The size and position of the line are shown on the status bar at the
bottom of the Draw document. If the status bar is not visible, choose
View➪Status Bar.
If you want straight lines, choose the + icon. This is definitely a timesaver if
you just want some straight lines that go across, up, or down — or slanted
halfway between. Arrows can be one-directional or two-directional, they can
begin or end with a circle or square, or they can be dimensional brackets that
are useful for blueprints, as shown in Figure 18-1.
Figure 18-1:
Elevation

OpenOffice.
org Draw.
288
Part V: Using Draw – The Graphics Program 

Lines and arrows are especially useful for drawing blueprints. We drew most
of the plans for our home in OpenOffice.org Draw. We worked with design
experts, but we drew almost everything ourselves, and it saved us a lot of
expense. And it was easy!
Do you want to change the look of your lines and/or arrows? Make them
fatter? Make them more colorful? Make them dots or dashes or both? Just
draw the line or arrow, and then select it and use the combo boxes on the
Object toolbar to adjust the line style, width, and color.
Swapping arrowheads
Do you want to customize your arrows? Notice that the dimensional brackets
in Figure 18-1 do not contain double arrows like the default dimensional line
icon. Draw offers an easy way to edit the arrows and customize them to the
precise look that you need.
To edit arrows, perform the following steps:
1. Long-click the Lines and Arrows icon on the Main toolbar.
The floating Lines and Arrows toolbar appears.
2. Choose the icon that most closely suits your needs.
For instance, if you want to have a dimensional line without the arrows,
click the Dimensional Line icon.
3. Click the Arrow Style icon on the Object toolbar (the third icon from
the left).
The floating Arrow Style toolbar appears.
4. From the left column of arrow styles, click the style that you want to
use for the left part of the arrow. And from the right column, click the
style that you want for the right part of the arrow.
To modify the dimensional lines, as in Figure 18-1, click the left bracket
and then the right bracket. The new style takes effect. Every time you
click on the Lines and Arrows icon, the new style continues.
Changing arrow styles can be perplexing if you inadvertently change the
wrong line or arrow icon. For instance, when we first started, we accidentally
opened the Arrow Style toolbar and made a few wrong clicks. Afterward,
every time we tried to draw a straight line, we got a square on one end and a
circle on another. Aargh! To undo your arrow styles, click the icon that needs
fixing and open the Arrow Style toolbar. Then click the correct line or arrow
styles from both the left and right columns.
Drawing to scale
To make sure that everything is correctly proportioned, you need to select a
unit of measure and a drawing scale.
289
Chapter 18: Unleashing the Artist Within 

To select a drawing scale and unit of measure for the status bar, choose
Tools➪Options➪Drawing➪General. The General dialog box appears. Select
the drawing scale from the 23 options that are available in the combo box.
You only need to do this if you are creating plans or blueprints, such as 
drawings for a house. We used a scale of 1:100 so that our drawing would fit
on 8 1⁄2 x 11-inch paper and be faxable. Select a unit of measurement from the
combo box. For our home drawing, we selected Foot.
When you create a line, the size of each line is shown in the status bar. When
drawing your lines to scale, remember that the status bar shows feet, tenths
of feet, and hundredths of feet — not feet and inches.
The dimensional brackets automatically insert the scaled dimension to the
nearest foot and no inches (when the line is drawn precisely horizontal). But
that’s okay. Just select the dimensional line, and click the Text icon. A cursor
appears on the dimension above the line. Type in the correct number of
inches. You can even change the “ft” to “'”.
Changing the look of your lines, arrows, and dimensional brackets
To do something more fancy, such as adding transparency to your lines or
arrows or varying the size of the arrowheads independent of the line thick-
ness, as shown in Figure 18-2, you use the Line icon on the Object toolbar.
Transparency can also be adjusted by using the Line icon.
Figure 18-2:
Editing lines
and arrow
styles.
290
Part V: Using Draw – The Graphics Program 

To modify line and arrow thickness, color, transparency, or style using the
Line icon, perform the following steps:
1. Draw or select the line that you want to modify, and click the Line
icon on the Object toolbar (it looks like the tip of a calligraphy pen).
The Line dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 18-2.The line that
is selected in the main drawing window also appears in the Line
dialog box.
2. Choose a color, width, and/or transparency from the combo box and
list boxes.
Watch the image change in the display box as you do so.
3. From the Line properties Style combo box, choose a style for your
line. If you can’t find a style that suits your needs, click the Line Styles
tab and create a unique line style.
In Figure 18-2, we wanted a striped pencil, so we chose Ultrafine 2 dots 3
dashes.
4. Click the Arrow styles options, and set them to your liking.
5. Click OK.
The line or arrow that you had originally selected is now transformed to
your specifications.
The trick to getting those fine details looking good is to use the Zoom
tool. Long-click the Zoom icon to see the draggable toolbar with the icons.
The Zoom In tool is useful for adding those fine touches, and then you can
use the Zoom Out tool to see the finished product. Other icons include Zoom
100%, Zoom Previous (which takes you to your previous zoom setting),
Zoom Next, Zoom Page, Zoom Width (which fills the width of the window
with the width of the page), and Optimal Zoom (which is great when some
of your page is empty). Also, Object Zoom is ideal when you have an object
or objects selected.
Rectangles and squares
Rectangles and squares are your basic building blocks. Calc provides eight
options. Long-click the Rectangle icon to view the four icons of rectangles
and four icons of squares, each with straight or rounded corners or filled.
These icons are used just like the line and arrow icons. Click the icon, and
then click and drag in the drawing page to create your rectangle. And if you
want to edit the rectangle, select it and pull the handles to resize.
The color of the lines and the fill color are both changeable. Just select the
square or rectangle and use the combo boxes on the Object toolbar. You can
291
Chapter 18: Unleashing the Artist Within 

also change the line size of your box or make it dotted — or even invisible.
And you can fill your rectangle with an interesting gradient, hatching, bitmap,
and so on. You can also make the fill invisible.
Circles and ellipses
The Ellipses icon on the Main toolbar offers some fun options on its drag-
gable toolbar. You have the choice of filled or unfilled circles and ellipses.
These are used and modified just like the rectangles and squares that we dis-
cussed in the previous section. Draw also offers a circle pie, ellipse pie, circle
segment, and ellipse segment. These tools require two extra clicks to define
your segments and pies.
To create a circle or ellipse pie, perform the following steps:
1. Click the circle or ellipse pie icon, either filled or unfilled, and draw
your circle or ellipse in the drawing page.
A line appears from the center of the circle or ellipse to the edge. When
you move your mouse around the outside of the circle or ellipse, the
radius line moves.
2. Position the radius line at the angle that you want, and click.
The circle or ellipse disappears, and when you move the mouse, either a
wedge or a Pacman (if you used a circle) appears. You can move the
mouse and watch the Pacman’s mouth open wider or close.
3. Position the mouse so that the pie is as small or large as you want, and
click.
Your pie is complete. You can apply different colors, fills, line sizes, or
styles from the combo boxes on the Object toolbar.
Circle and ellipse segments are created just like pies, but instead of being
wedge-shaped or Pacman-shaped, they are bowl-shaped or globe-shaped and
slightly flat on one side.
Arcs are also created like pies and segments. Two extra clicks are required to
define arcs.
Polygons
Draw gives you four options for Polygon tool options: regular, 45-degree, filled,
and unfilled. You can use the filled 45-degree option to make amazingly com-
plex cityscape silhouettes with just a few clicks of the mouse. The 45-degree
angle is perfect for rooftops. Use it when you want to make triangles, too.
292
Part V: Using Draw – The Graphics Program 

The Polygon icon is on the Curves toolbar. Long-click the Curves icon on the
Main toolbar to view the Curves icons, and then click the polygon icon of
your choice. Then when you click and drag in the Draw document, a line
appears. As you release the mouse button, the line stays put, and another
line starts from the end of the original line. Each time you click, you create
another corner point for your polygon. Double-clicking ends the process and
closes the polygon.
Natural selection
You may want to select two or more objects at the same time. For instance, to
merge two or more shapes, as described later in this chapter, you need to
select all the shapes. This can be done in two ways:
 Shift+click the objects that you want to select.
 Click the Select icon (the arrow at the top of the Main toolbar) and then
click in an empty area and drag the mouse so that a rectangle of dashed
lines appears.
Keep dragging the rectangle to surround the objects that you want to
select. Objects that are only partially encompassed in the selection area
are not selected.
Text
Well-designed text can make your words jump off the pages of your
brochures, posters, Web pages, and more. Draw has awesome powers to
transform any boring old text into fabulous-looking text.
To type text into your Draw document, click the Text icon on the Main tool-
bar (it’s the big T ). Then choose the font, size, style (bold, italic, or under-
line), and color from the Object toolbar. (If the Object toolbar is not visible,
choose View➪Toolbars➪Object Bar.) Click in the document, and type in your
text. Use the handles of your text box to resize the text box, or click between
the handles to drag your text box where you want it to go. Other options,
such as centering, left justifying, line spacing, and so on, are available as
options on the Object toolbar.
Click outside the text box to deselect your text. To go back and change
things, double-click your text. To resize your text box or drag it, click it.
Long-clicking the Text icon makes a draggable toolbar of text icons visible.
The two new icons are Fit Text to Frame and Callouts.
293
Chapter 18: Unleashing the Artist Within 

Use the Fit Text to Frame tool when you know what size rectangular or
square shape that your text needs to fit into. Once you define the size of the
text box, any text that you insert automatically resizes to fit the text box.
Click the icon, and then click and drag to create a text box in the size that
you want it to be in the document. A cursor appears. Type your text. The text
does not resize itself until you deselect the text box. When you finish, click
outside the text box to deselect it. Your text then resizes so that it fits inside
the text box. (The text can get smaller to fit the text box, or it can get larger
to expand to fill the text box.)
Callouts are great for pointing at and describing what you are pointing
out. Callouts are described in Chapter 11 in the section “Creating Callouts.”
Building with Shapes
A powerful feature of Draw is its ability to merge, subtract, and intersect
shapes. This is your ticket to using basic shapes as building blocks to create
your own skyscraper of artwork. Figure 18-3 shows an image of flowers in a
flowerpot; the image uses these shapes features. The flowerpot is made up of
three rows of the same repeated Pacman shape (the unfilled circle pie), all
merged together. The stems of the flowers are each made of two ellipses, one
subtracting the other. And the flowers are a single petal shape that was cre-
ated by simply intersecting two ellipses. The same petal is used repeatedly. In
other words, just two shapes — a Pacman pie and an ellipse — are the basis
of the entire image.
Figure 18-3:
The vase
and flowers
are all
merged,
subtracted,
and

shapes.
294
Part V: Using Draw – The Graphics Program 

Merging shapes
Merging shapes is a fantastic tool for creating complex images in a simple
way. It allows you to have a single border line around multiple shapes. And,
your new shape can be selected with the ease of a single click.
If you merge shapes with thickened borders or lines that are 0.02 inches thick
or more, any fill that the shape may have disappears and only the border(s)
and/or line(s) remain. These borders and lines are cleverly transformed into
fills, which means that they can now have gradients, hatchings, or bitmaps
applied to them.
To merge shapes, perform the following steps:
1. Select the two or more shapes and/or lines that you want to merge.
Oddly enough, the shapes do not have to be touching each other.
2. Choose Modify➪Shapes➪Merge.
If the shapes overlap, the outline of the top shape disappears at the area
of intersection, and the two shapes appear and act as one. Also, if the
original shapes are two different colors, the merged shape is trans-
formed into the color, gradient, and so on of the bottom shape.
Once you merge your shapes, you can merge them repeatedly, building more
complex shapes, such as the flowerpot shown in Figure 18-3, which is essen-
tially a single unfilled circle pie.
To apply a gradient, hatching, or bitmap to lines, such as straight lines,
arrows, or the lines of unfilled shapes, choose Modify➪Shapes➪Merge to
transform the lines and/or unfilled shapes into fills. The lines must be at least
0.02 inches thick to transform into a fill.
Subtracting shapes
You may have noticed that Draw does not have an eraser tool, as do many art
programs. This is because any shape can become an eraser by simply posi-
tioning it over the shape or object that you want to erase (or subtract). Select
both shapes, and then choose Modify➪Shapes➪Subtract. The stems of the
flowers in Figure 18-3 were created by overlapping one oval with another
oval, just leaving a sliver uncovered, and then selecting them both and
choosing Modify➪Shapes➪Subtract.
295
Chapter 18: Unleashing the Artist Within 

Intersecting shapes
The Intersect feature of the Shapes tool is fun to use when you are searching
for imagery that is really striking. Intersecting can create unusual and appeal-
ing shapes. The petals of the flower in Figure 18-3 are a simple intersection of
two ovals. To create a new shape from the intersection of two shapes, select
the shapes and then choose Modify➪Shapes➪Intersect.
Combining shapes and lines
The Combine feature is basically the opposite of the Intersect feature. Instead
of having the intersections of two shapes remain, the intersections disappear.
The Combine feature is not just limited to shapes; it can also be used for
intersecting lines and arrows.
 To combine shapes or lines, select your shapes and then choose
Modify➪Combine.
 To undo your combination, select it and then choose Modify➪Split.
Editing Exceptionally
Draw has exceptional abilities to edit basic shapes. Transforming shapes by
distorting them or using Set in circle produces a variety of unique shapes.
And those unique shapes — or even ordinary shapes — can be duplicated,
rotated, and manipulated in various ways to create fascinating fractal images
of varying simplicity or complexity.
Moving, flipping, and rotating
Now that you know the basic shapes that Draw offers, it’s time to do some-
thing with them. Moving, rotating, and flipping are the three most basic, yet
powerful options. Rotating an object is described later in this section. Moving
and flipping are accomplished as follows:
 To move a shape that you created (or any object), simply click and drag.
To move the shape more precisely in a single direction, click to select it
and use the arrow keys.
 To flip an object vertically, select it and choose Modify➪Flip➪Vertically.
 To flip an object horizontally, select it and choose Modify➪Flip➪
Horizontally.
296
Part V: Using Draw – The Graphics Program 

You can also use the Flip icon on the Effects draggable toolbar of the
Main toolbar. To use this icon, select the object that you want to flip
and then click the Flip icon. A red line indicates where Draw intends
to flip the object. If that line is not to your liking, you can move it. To
perform the flip, drag a handle of the object from one side of the red
bar to the other side.
To rotate an object, perform the following steps:
1. Select the object or objects that you want to rotate.
2. Long-click the Effects icon on the Main toolbar, and click the Rotate
icon (which looks like a U-turn arrow). (The Rotate icon on the Main
toolbar may or may not be the same as the Effects icon.) Or, choose
Modify➪Rotate.
The handles of the selected object or objects change from green to red.
A circle with short lines projecting horizontally and vertically appears in
the center.
3. Click a corner handle and drag.
The cursor changes to a horseshoe shape, and the object rotates around
the center in the direction that you drag. The number of degrees of rota-
tion is shown in the lower bar of the Draw window.
To achieve a 3-D effect for your rotation, click and drag on a side handle
instead of a corner handle.
Sometimes you want to rotate an object around something other than its
center. To do this, move the circle that appears in the middle of the selection.
The object or objects then rotate around wherever that circle is positioned.
Arranging, aligning, and grouping
Three handy ways of moving and grooving in Draw are arranging, aligning,
and grouping. These terms are described as follows:
 Arranging allows you to specify what image goes on top and what stays
underneath.
 Aligning allows you to align your objects for the professional look that
they deserve. (A wise person once told us that half of good graphic
design is simply getting everything lined up perfectly.)
 Grouping makes it easy to move complex shapes around with a
single click. It is similar to choosing Modify➪Shapes➪Merge, but
slightly different.
297
Chapter 18: Unleashing the Artist Within 

Arranging
You probably already noticed that your artwork can get lost if you have too
many shapes and things piled on top of each other. The natural order of
stacking is that the first object that’s placed on the page stacks on the
bottom, the last object stacks on the top, and everything else stacks in order
of its arrival on the page.
If that order does not suit you, Draw offers ways to change it by using the
draggable Arrange toolbar, keyboard shortcuts, or the Arrange options of the
Modify menu.
Open the Arrange toolbar by long-clicking the Arrange icon on the Main tool-
bar. The icons on the Arrange toolbar are Bring to Front, Bring Forward, Send
Backward, Send to Back, In Front of Object, Behind Object, and Reverse.
Bring to Front and Bring Forward perform the same function when only two
objects are involved. The same is true of Send to Back and Send Backward.
In Front of Object and Behind Object are great when you want to specify what
object the selected object is to be in front of or behind. These two icons
require an extra click to specify what objects the selected object needs to be
in front of or behind.
Reverse requires more than one object to be selected, and simply reverses
the order.
These options are all accessible from the main menus as well as the Arrange
toolbar. Choose Modify➪Arrange, and then choose the desired option. Most
of the arrange options also have keyboard shortcuts, which are listed on the
drop-down Arrange menu.
The simplest way to bring an object to the front is to just cut and paste the
object. That makes your object the most recent on the page and gives it top
billing.
Aligning
To align your objects on the page, long-click the Alignment icon on the Main
toolbar. The draggable Alignment toolbar appears. (Alternatively, you could
choose Modify➪Alignment from the main menu.) The alignment options are
Left, Centered, Right, Top, Center, and Bottom. Select all the objects that you
want to align, and then choose the alignment option that suits you best. (Do
each row and each column separately, unless you want one big mishmash.)
For even spacing between columns and rows, you can estimate column spac-
ing and row spacing visually. To be more precise, you can select one object
from each row and/or column and note their position in the coordinates that
298
Part V: Using Draw – The Graphics Program 

are shown in the status bar at the bottom of the Draw window. (If the status
bar is not visible, choose View➪Status Bar.) The first coordinate is the X
coordinate and the second is the Y coordinate. Write down the coordinates
for each object. Then it is just a matter of adding and subtracting (and maybe
some multiplication and division and a little quantum physics — just kidding)
to get those columns and rows even.
You can also find the position of an object by choosing Format➪Position and
Size. Figure 18-4 shows the Position and Size dialog box. The added benefit of
using this dialog box is that you can also type a new position for the object
into the text boxes and your object moves to the location that you specify.
This gives you pinpoint accuracy.
Grouping
Grouping allows you to combine objects so that you can manipulate them
as if they were a single object. Grouping is similar to Merging shapes, but
grouping is reversible, whereas Merging shapes requires that you choose
Edit➪Undo to reverse a change. Notice that the Modify menu contains the
option Ungroup as well as Group. These options may be hard to read when
an object is not selected, but they become accessible when a grouped object
is selected.

299
Chapter 18: Unleashing the Artist Within 

To group two or more objects, select the objects and choose Modify➪Group,
or press Control+Shift+G. To ungroup the objects, select the grouped object
and choose Modify➪Ungroup, or press Alt+Control+Shift+G.
It’s not necessary to ungroup a set of objects to edit a single component. Just
double-click the grouped object, and the objects that comprise the group
appear normally on-screen (whereas all ungrouped objects appear faded).
Edit the grouped objects as you want, and then choose Modify➪Exit Group,
or press Control+F3 to return to normal editing mode.
When you double-click a group, you may be surprised to find that not all the
objects are ungrouped. This is because groups may be within groups. If you
grouped an object in several grouping sessions and you want to edit that
object, you may need to ungroup the object in the reverse order that you
grouped it until you free the group that you want to edit.
Duplicating
In addition to duplicating an object, the Duplicate feature also allows you to
rotate your object a specific number of degrees and move your object left or
right, up or down, or a specific distance for each duplication. You can enlarge
the object or make it smaller. You can morph from a starting color to an ending
color. And you can specify the number of duplications of your object. Using
this tool can easily add beauty and complexity to your art. And if you just want
to resize your object with precision, you can also use the Duplicate tool.
Figure 18-5 shows the values that we entered to create the flower in Figure
18-3. The original shape that we duplicated was a two-petal, propeller-like
shape. When you rotate an object with the Duplicate tool, the rotation occurs
around the center of the object. You can’t change the center of rotation, so a
single petal does not rotate into a flower.
To duplicate objects, perform the following steps:
1. Create and select the object or objects that you want to duplicate.
Remember, if you plan to rotate the object, it will rotate around its
center, so you may need to duplicate and flip your object and then select
both objects if you want them to appear to rotate around an edge
instead.
2. Choose Edit➪Duplicate.
The Duplicate dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 18-5.
3. Enter the number of copies into the list box.
For the flower in Figure 18-3, we entered 24 copies.
300
Part V: Using Draw – The Graphics Program 

4. Enter the distance that you want the X axis of the rotation and Y axis
of the rotation to move after each duplication, and enter the angle of
rotation.
Inserting 0 in the X- and Y-axis list boxes fixes your image in place and
allows your image to rotate around a constant point. Entering nonzero
values in these list boxes sometimes creates a spiral-like image when
you rotate. To duplicate in a straight line at any angle that you choose,
enter nonzero values in the X- and Y-axis list boxes and enter 0 in the
Angle list box. For instance, entering a nonzero value in the X-axis list
box, 0 in the Y-axis list box, and 0 in the Angle list box simply duplicates
your image in a horizontal line.
5. In the Width and the Height list boxes, enter the increment by which
you want each successive duplication to enlarge or reduce.
To maintain the scale as the image size changes, be sure that the width
and height that you choose are in the same proportion as the width and
height of your selected image. For the flower in Figure 18-3, we did not
change the width or height setting.
6. Select the colors that you want to start and end with in the combo
boxes.
Gradations of colors can give a nice effect.
7. Click OK.
Check out your duplication. Is it what you expected? If not, press Ctrl+Z
to undo the duplication and give it another try. It usually takes a few
tries to get it exactly how you like it. To get the effect of a flower, we
copied the top double petal, pasted it, and then flipped it horizontally.

Chapter 18: Unleashing the Artist Within 

If duplication does not work as expected, the scale of your Draw window may
not be 1:1. The values in the list boxes are sensitive to the scale that is set
when you choose Tools➪Options➪Drawing➪General. For example, if your
scale is 1:10 you need to type 10 instead of 1 into the list boxes to create the
desired effect.
Distorting and setting in circles
Does it ever feel like your artwork is sometimes a little too neat and tidy? No
problem. Draw has tools to change all that. These tools are Distort, Set in
Circle (slant), and Set in Circle (perspective). They all distort and create inter-
esting curves in slightly different ways. Using any or all of these three tools
allows you to easily warp all that unwanted symmetry out of existence. Figure
18-6 shows an image that was created by subtracting and merging ellipses,
and then applying the Distort tool to get a more organic look and feel.
To use the Distort, Set in Circle (slant), or Set in Circle (perspective) tool, per-
form the following steps:
1. Select the object or objects that you want to distort.
Figure 18-6:
Break the

302
Part V: Using Draw – The Graphics Program 

2. Long-click the Effects icon of the main menu to view the draggable
Effects toolbar. Then click the Distort icon, the Set to Circle (slant)
icon, or the Set in Circle (perspective) icon.
A dialog box may appear asking whether you want to convert your
selected object to a curve. If so, click Yes. If you click No, almost no
effect will take place when you use the tool.
3. Click and drag a handle of the object to achieve your desired shape.
The Set in Circle icon or one of the Distort icons appears when the
mouse passes over a handle. And when you click, a grid appears over
your object. Dragging your mouse distorts the grid. When you release
the mouse button, your image maps itself according to the final shape of
the grid.
Using these icons involves a bit of trial and error. If you use Distort or the
other two tools and your result is not what you hoped, choose Edit➪Undo
and try again. After some practice, you’ll be able to visualize better what the
final result will be from viewing the warping of the grid.
Cross-fading
Cross-fading offers yet another tool for creating appealing and complex
images. With the Cross-fading tool, you select two images and specify how
many iterations you want. The Cross-fading tool then creates copies that
gradually change from the first image into the second image. One major use
of cross-fading is to create animations within Impress. These animations can
add pizzazz to your Web site or presentation.
To cross-fade two objects, perform the following steps:
1. Position both shapes where you want your cross fade to start and end,
and select both shapes.
Cross fades can be performed on normal shapes and on merged, inter-
sected, and subtracted shapes. Grouped shapes and lines and arrows do
not cross-fade, and shapes must either be unfilled or filled with color,
not with a gradient, bitmap, or hatching.
2. Choose Edit➪Cross-fading from the main menu.
The Cross-fading dialog box appears.
3. Enter the number of increments in which you want the cross-fading to
take place. Also, select the Cross-fade attributes and Same orientation
check boxes.
303
Chapter 18: Unleashing the Artist Within 

The Cross-fade attributes option allows the attributes such as line
widths and colors to cross-fade properly. The Same orientation option
keeps your cross fade from twisting and turning in a way that seems
unnatural.
4. Click OK.
The cross fade appears in your drawing page as a grouped object. To
select a single shape in the cross fade, you need to ungroup it.
Coloring Your World
A wide range of colors, gradients, bitmaps, and hatchings are provided in the
combo boxes on the Object toolbar, but they are small drops in the ocean of
possibilities. Draw allows you to explore the millions of colors that exist and
to choose the precise colors and gradients that suit your needs. It also allows
you to define your own hatchings, import your own bitmap images, specify
transparencies, and create your own glows. This all adds up to infinite flexi-
bility for your artwork.
You may want to create your own palette — you can specify what colors, gra-
dients, hatchings, or bitmaps appear in the combo boxes. And these lists may
be different for different artworks, so you may want to load and save these
lists. Fortunately, Draw allows you to do all this. It even provides you with
several samples of different color, gradient, and hatching palettes, such as a
Web-safe palette.
Coloring consummately
Draw allows you to choose any color from the millions of colors that are
available. You can also limit yourself to the 256-color range. You can add
colors by inputting their RGB (red-green-blue) numbers, or you can pick your
colors from a rainbow of possibilities.
To add or modify a color in the combo box lists or to apply a new color to a
line or area, perform the following steps:
1. Select the object to which you want to apply the new color. The object
must be an object that can accept a fill — not a line or arrow.
To change the color of a line or arrow, don’t select anything. The new
color will be added to the line color combo box list, and you can change
the line color after performing the following steps.
2. Click the Paint Can icon on the Object toolbar, or choose Format➪
Area.
The Area dialog box appears.
304
Part V: Using Draw – The Graphics Program 

3. Click the Colors tab.
The Colors window appears.
4. To modify a color, select it from the Color combo box.
5. Click the Edit button.
The Color dialog box appears, containing two large multicolored
squares. The left square offers some colors in the 256-color range. You
can also change the values in the list boxes to derive any of the 256
colors. The right square provides millions of colors. And, of course, the
values in the boxes below the right square can be changed to create
colors as well.
6. Click anywhere in either box, or input values into the boxes to select
a new color.
The color that you select or input appears in a rectangular box in the
lower-right corner of the window. The color in the box beside it is the
color that you chose in Step 3. Keep clicking, or click and drag or input
new values until the perfect color appears.
7. Click OK.
The Color dialog box closes. The Area dialog box is visible once again.
8. If you are adding a new color, type a new name for your color in the
Name box and click Add. If you are modifying a color, click Modify.
The new color is added or changed in the drop-down lists of the Color
combo box.
9. Repeat Steps 3 through 8 to add or modify colors to your heart’s 
content.
10. After you have added or modified your last color, click OK.
The Area dialog box closes. The color of your selected item changes to
the last color that you added or modified. (If nothing was selected, noth-
ing changes color, of course.) Also, if you click Cancel instead of OK, the
color of your selected item does not change, but the colors that you
added or modified are still in the color combo boxes.
Adding great gradients
Gradients are great for creating amazingly real-looking 3-D objects and adding
flourish to your creations. Figure 18-7 shows an example of using two gradients
to portray a glowing sun. Draw offers some ready-made gradients in the Fills
combo box on the Object toolbar, but the actual number of possible gradi-
ents is, of course, infinite. And, it is likely that the particular gradient that you
need for your masterpiece is not found in the Gradient combo box list.
305
Chapter 18: Unleashing the Artist Within 

Draw allows you to specify the increments of the gradation. That means, if
you want your gradient to take place in 5 or 6 steps — instead of 60 or so, as
it sometimes does automatically — you can produce an interesting effect.
Figure 18-8 is an example of a gradient that has only eight increments. It is
made from four triangles that have the same gradient applied to them.
To add or modify a gradient in the combo box list or to apply a new gradient
to an object, perform the following steps:
1. Select the object to which you want to apply the new gradient.
2. Click the Paint Can icon on the Object toolbar, or choose Format➪Area.
When the Area dialog box appears, click the Gradients tab.
The Gradients panel of the Area dialog box appears.
3. Apply one of these steps to define the gradient:
• To modify a gradient, choose the gradient that you want to modify.
• To add a new gradient, select the gradient that most closely resem-
bles the gradient that you want to create.
4. Choose the type of gradient you want from the Type combo box, if it
is different from the gradient that you already selected.
Draw offers Linear, Axial (slanted linear), Radial, Ellipsoid, Square, and
Rectangular gradients. If you are not sure what each of these do, select
each type one at a time and watch how the gradient changes in the
Preview window.
Figure 18-7:
This glowing
sun uses
two
gradients.
306
Part V: Using Draw – The Graphics Program 

5. Enter values into the Center X, Center Y, Angle, and Border boxes to
modify the gradient.
Watch how your gradient changes with the different values that you
enter. The Center X and Center Y boxes are only active for Radial,
Ellipsoid, Square, and Rectangular gradient types. And the Angle box, of
course, has no effect on Radial gradient types.
6. Choose the starting and ending colors as well as their intensity values.
Keep your eyes on the gradient to see whether you like what you
choose. Also, if the exact color that you need doesn’t exist on the list,
feel free to click the Colors tab and add your color to the combo box list.
7. Click Add if you are adding a gradient, or click Modify if you are mod-
ifying an existing gradient.
A Name dialog box appears, requesting a name for your new gradient. If
you clicked Modify, the name of the gradient that you are modifying is in
the name input box.
8. Type in a new name, if desired, and click OK.
The Name dialog box closes.
9. Repeat Steps 3 through 8 to add new or modify gradients.

307
Chapter 18: Unleashing the Artist Within 

10. After you finish, click OK.
The Area dialog box closes. The gradient of the item that you selected in
Step 1 changes to the last gradient that you added. If you click Cancel,
the gradient of your selected item does not change, but the gradients
that you added or modified are still listed in the combo box.
To change the increments of gradation, as in Figure 18-8, select the object
with the gradient that you want to modify and click the Paint Can on the
Object toolbar to open the Area dialog box. Click the Area tab, and select the
Gradient button check box. The Gradient list appears as well as a box labeled
Automatic. Deselect the Automatic check box, and choose the number of
increments from the spin box. Watch the gradient change in the viewing rec-
tangle as the numbers get lower. When you see the gradient that you like,
click OK. The gradient fills the selected object.
Hatching handily
Hatching is a great way to get lots of lines in your artwork without having to
draw them. Remember that hatchings don’t have to be devoid of color. You
can either put your hatched object on top of a background with a gradient fill
or color of your choice, or you can specify a background color. Figure 18-9 is
an example of a handy use for hatching. Creating the tennis racket strings
would be a tedious chore without the hatching tool.
To create a customized hatching, perform the following steps:
1. Select the object to which you want to apply the hatching, and click
the Paint Can icon on the Object toolbar.
The Area dialog box appears.
2. Click the Hatching tab.
The Hatching panel appears in the Area dialog box.
3. Fill in the Spacing, Angle, Line Type, and Color input boxes to gener-
ate your new hatching.
Watch the hatching change as you modify the parameters. If you want a
horizontal, vertical, or 45-degree angle, you can click the line of your
choice below the Angle input box, instead of entering the number of
degrees.
4. Click the Add button, and type in a new name.
You can instead click the Modify button. Both the Add and Modify but-
tons open the Name dialog box. The Add button suggests a new name in
the name field, whereas the Modify button suggests the name of the
already existing hatching that is selected.
308
Part V: Using Draw – The Graphics Program 

5. Click OK.
The new hatching is applied to the selected object and added to the list
of hatchings in the combo box.
To assign a background color to a hatching, select the object that you want
to hatch with a background, and click the Paint Can icon on the Object tool-
bar to open the Area dialog box. Click the Area tab, and select the Hatching
option button. The hatchings list and the Background color check box
appear. Select this box, choose the background color from the combo box list
of colors, select the hatching of your choice, and click OK.
Glorious glows and transparencies
Transparencies can add fascination and sophistication to your work. They
are used in a myriad of ways. Transparencies can be used to allow layers to
show through other layers, as shown in Figure 18-10. A Christmas tree is
depicted with simple see-through triangles. Another use for transparencies is
glows. Glows are created by applying a gradual transparency to a color.
Glows are similar to gradients, but glows involve the color becoming more
transparent instead of gradually changing to another color. The glow on the
sun in Figure 18-7 was created by using yellow changing to white. But it could
also have been created by fading out the yellow.
Figure 18-9:
Tennis
strings are
drawn with

309
Chapter 18: Unleashing the Artist Within 

To apply a transparency to a selected object, click the Paint Can icon or
choose Format➪Area to open the Area dialog box. Click the Transparency
tab. In the Transparency panel, select the Transparency check box and
choose the amount of transparency that you want. The higher the number,
the more transparent your object is.
To create a glow, perform the following steps:
1. Select the object or objects that you want to fill with a glow.
Your object may already be filled with a color, gradient, bitmap, or
hatching. (Yes, even a hatching can have a glow applied to it.)
You probably want the lines of your shape(s) to be invisible.
2. Click the Paint Can icon or choose Format➪Area to open the Area
dialog box, and click the Transparency tab.
The Transparency window of the Area dialog box appears. The fill of
your selected object appears in the rectangle of the window. If a different
fill appears, you probably selected two or more objects with different
fills. You may want to start over and select objects with the same fill so
you can edit it.
3. Select the Gradient check box, and select the type, angle, border, start
value, and end value.
Figure 18-10:
A simple

using
transparent

310
Part V: Using Draw – The Graphics Program 

Watch your fill change as you specify the parameters. You should
choose a high start value and a low end value for a nice glowing effect.
And check out the Quadratic gradient type, along with a 45-degree angle.
Keep changing the values until you achieve the desired result.
4. Click OK.
The transparency gradient fills your selected shape — hopefully in the
way you expected. If not, try again. With a little practice, your work will
be glowing with perfection.
Bitmapping brilliantly
Draw offers some interesting bitmaps, such as water, fire, metal, and so on.
But you will probably want to import and create your own bitmaps as well.
You can import all the most common bitmap file types into Draw.
Importing bitmaps
To import a bitmap, perform the following steps:
1. Select the object to which you want to apply the bitmap, and click the
Paint Can icon on the Object toolbar.
The Area dialog box appears.
2. Click the Bitmaps tab to open the Bitmaps window.
3. Click the Import button.
The Import dialog box appears.
4. Browse your files until you find the file that you want to import.
To show only the folders and files of the same type that you are looking
for, select the file type from the File Type combo box; otherwise select
All Formats (the default). Be sure that the Preview box is marked so that
you can see your image in the large rectangular box in the right side of
the window.
5. Click Open.
The Name dialog box appears, requesting a name for your bitmap.
6. Type in a name, and click OK.
The image appears in the rectangle below the list box in the Bitmaps
window.
7. Click OK.
The image is applied to the object(s) that you selected.
311
Chapter 18: Unleashing the Artist Within 

Customizing the sizing and tiling of your bitmap
If you import an image, and the image is not exactly how you expected it to
look when you apply it, it’s easy to size, position, and tile the image to your
liking. Even the bitmaps that are provided by Draw may need a bit of editing
to work for you.
To customize the sizing and tiling of your bitmap, perform the following steps:
1. Select the object that contains the bitmap.
2. Choose Format➪Area, or click the Paint Can icon on the Object 
toolbar.
The Area dialog box appears.
3. If the Area tab is not selected, click it and mark Bitmap.
Your bitmap appears in a rectangle in the Area dialog box. Underneath
your bitmap are check boxes and spin boxes for various parameters.
4. Deselect the Original Size check box to adjust the size, and click in the
Relative box. Then adjust the size according to the percentage of
width and height.
The bitmap adjusts accordingly in the window.
5. If you do not want to tile the bitmap, deselect the Tile check box. If
tiling is not marked and you want the bitmap to fit the size of your
object, select the Autofit check box and go to Step 6. However, to tile
the bitmap, select the Tile check box and adjust the tiling to your
liking.
Click the X Offset and Y Offset boxes to offset the tiling, or mark the row
or column boxes and select a percentage in the offset spin box to stag-
ger the tiling. The changes are shown in the box that displays your
selected bitmap.
6. Click OK.
Your bitmap fills the selected area in the manner that you specified.
Creating a unique bitmap
Draw allows you to fill in each pixel of an 8×8–pixel grid with two different
colors of your choice. This grid is then repeated to make a new bitmap.
Figure 18-11 shows an example of a customized bitmap. The sunflower seeds
are created by using this 8×8–pixel grid.
To customize a bitmap, perform the following steps:
1. Select the object to which you want to apply the bitmap, and click the
Paint Can icon on the Object toolbar.
The Area dialog box appears.
312
Part V: Using Draw – The Graphics Program 

2. Click the Bitmaps tab to open the Bitmaps window.
Notice that an 8×8 grid, labeled Pattern Editor, appears in the left side of
the window.
3. Select the colors that you want for your foreground and background,
and click in the grid.
Each click changes a cell from the background color to the foreground
color. Or, if the foreground color is already in the cell, clicking the cell
reverts the color to the background color.
Watch the pattern develop and change in the rectangular viewing screen
below the list box.
4. Click Add.
The Name dialog box appears, requesting a name for your bitmap.
5. Type in a name, and click OK.
The image appears in the rectangle below the list box in the Bitmaps
window.
6. Click OK.
The image is applied to the object(s) that you selected.
Figure 18-11:

313
Chapter 18: Unleashing the Artist Within 

Your bitmap pattern can be resized using the Area window of the Area dialog
box. Suppose that you want your 8×8 grid to be the letter T and you want it
large enough to be seen. Just create your T, and use the Area window to
resize and tile the T according to your needs, as previously described.
Customizing your color, gradient, 
hatching, and bitmap lists
Do you want to have your colors list contain just those colors that are opti-
mized for the Web? Or do you want your gradient list to be more colorful and
outrageous? You can specify your own colors and add them to the lists, or
you can use the different color lists, gradient lists, and hatching lists that
Draw offers.
To load a different color, gradient, or hatching list, choose Format➪Area or
click the Paint Can icon to open the Area dialog box. Then click the Colors
tab, the Gradients tab, or the Hatching tab. Each of these three windows con-
tains a Load List icon. Click the icon to open the browser to view the avail-
able lists. The color lists use the suffix .soc, the gradients end with .sog,
and the hatchings use the suffix .soh. Select your new list, and click Open.
Notice that the colors, gradients, or hatchings in the Area dialog box are now
changed to the new lists.
To save a different color, gradient, hatching, or bitmap list, perform the steps
described earlier in this chapter to customize your colors, gradients, hatch-
ings, or bitmaps. Notice that you can delete items from the lists by clicking
the Delete button. When your list is complete, click the Save icon and type in
a new name. Then click OK, and you now have a new list to access as you
please.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
T
he arguments for using OpenOfﬁce.org are exciting and
compelling, and here we explain the top ten reasons
why. No more worrying about restrictive licenses. No more
feeling guilty about using any unauthorized copy. No need
to pay for frequent upgrades, or even the program itself.
And this just scratches the surface.
The technical support you can get for OpenOfﬁce.org is also
amazing, and in this section we show you how. Imagine
having thousands of people ready and willing to help 
you with any problem you may have — and all for free.
That sums up the support that you can expect from the
OpenOfﬁce.org community. The e-mail lists and online
forums are awesome with their experienced volunteers
providing deep insight into the nuts and bolts of the entire
program. Everyone is excited about this ground-breaking,
new open source program, and eager to welcome newbies
and give them a helping hand, if they need it.

Chapter 19
Ten Reasons to Use OpenOffice.org
In This Chapter
 Pay no money now, or ever
 Used with great satisfaction by millions of people around the world
 Compatible with every major platform
 Easy upgrades
 Launched as an open source and maintained by Sun Microsystems, Inc.
 No worries about end-user license agreements
W
hy use OpenOffice.org? Maybe this question should be why not use
OpenOffice.org? In fact, so many reasons abound for using this pro-
gram that once you read this chapter, you may wonder why anyone would
want to use anything else.
It’s Free!
OpenOffice.org is free to all users. It’s free now, and it’s free forever. Every
time a new version of OpenOffice.org is released, that upgrade is free (unlike
almost all proprietary software, which forces you to pay every year or so to
keep up with the most current version).
If you want to have an extra copy for your home or office, that’s free. If you
want to give a copy to a friend, that’s free. If you need 1,000 copies for every-
one in your company, they’re all free. It also costs nothing to upgrade those
1,000 copies.
Compare that to the cost of acquiring Microsoft Office XP Standard, which is
currently being sold at Amazon.com for $354.99. Even if you have an older
version of Microsoft Office, the upgrade to Microsoft Office XP Standard costs
$200! All this adds up to lots of money now and lots of money later (and for
some, lots of money already spent in the past).
We can think of other ways to spend all that money, can’t you?

You’re Free!
You’re free from any guilty conscience that you may have if you accidentally —
or purposely — install some extra copies and violate an end-user license agree-
ment (EULA).
You’re free from worrying about your version being too old and incompatible
because you don’t want to shell out money for upgrades.
You’re free from wondering if the proprietary software that you just purchased
contains spyware that permits a company to eavesdrop on your activities (or
audit your license compliance) without your being aware of it.
You’re free from worrying about violating an EULA that is too long, too
boring, and too legalized to read, yet may contain unusual clauses such as
the one that Microsoft included in its FrontPage 2002 software: “You may not
use the Software in connection with any site that disparages Microsoft, MSN,
MSNBC, Expedia, or their products or services . . .” In this case, you’re free to
use your freedom of speech.
You’re free from having to choose between your bank account and your repu-
tation or conscience when deciding whether to use a bootleg copy of propri-
etary software.
You’re free from the guilt of not being a good example to your children and
insisting that they buy their own copies (or that you buy more copies) of a pro-
prietary program, instead of making illegal copies of your software for them.
You are free from the peer pressure of being asked by friends to borrow your
copy of a proprietary program to install on their computer. They may even
insist that you help them install it!
You’re free from trying to remember where you put your activation code
for your installation disk when you need to reinstall a proprietary program on
your new computer.
Because the source code is freely available, you’re free from being at the
mercy of a single company to fix bugs that you find. You are free because you
can hire any programmer of your choice to fix these bugs. Okay, you proba-
bly aren’t going to hire someone to fix bugs, but you could, and some compa-
nies will.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Sun Powers It
One of the world’s largest computer manufacturers and software developers,
Sun Microsystems, Inc., bought the StarOffice code from StarDivision in 1999
and launched it as a free Microsoft Office alternative in May 2002. Sun is a
multibillion-dollar international corporation that is heavily committed to
making OpenOffice.org a success. Sun provides training for OpenOffice.org
and support in the form of migration assistance. It also sells StarOffice, an
office suite that is based on the source code for OpenOffice.org, with a few
extra proprietary features. According to an interview with Danese Cooper
from Sun Microsystems, Inc. that was published on the OpenOffice.org Web
site, Sun is pleased with the success of OpenOffice.org. OpenOffice.org has
“wildly exceeded distribution projections.”
Sun views OpenOffice.org as a way to break Microsoft’s ever-expanding grip on
the world software market. OpenOffice.org also runs on Solaris, Sun’s propri-
etary operating system, and on GNU/Linux, which Microsoft Office does not.
Upgrades and Reinstallations Are Easy
To upgrade your copy of OpenOffice.org, follow these steps:
1. Pay no money now. (Also, pay no money later.)
You don’t need to order the product (and you obviously don’t need to
get a purchase order approved). Furthermore, you don’t need to worry
about product activation. (So far, you haven’t had to do anything.)
2. Wait for the right moment. That can be any time you like.
In the middle of the night, if you decide that you want to upgrade, you
can do it right then and there.
3. Go to www.openoffice.org/download, and click a few items.
Refer to our installation instructions in Appendix A for more details.
Follow the same easy instructions to upgrade OpenOffice.org as you
would to install it.
OpenOffice.org downloads on its own; it may take anywhere from 15 min-
utes to two and a half hours, depending on which version you need for
your operating system, and whether you have a fast connection like DSL
or a slower dial-up modem. You then click a few more things and it’s done.
If you’re in a hurry, skip all these steps except Step 3.

Commercial Support Is Available,
If You Want It
If you want to convert a medium-sized or large business, or educational insti-
tute, or even an entire government to OpenOffice.org and need some help,
Sun Microsystems, Inc. would be a good place to start looking for commercial
support. Sun, the company that launched OpenOffice.org as a free open
source program, provides training and migration assistance for OpenOffice.
org as well as its proprietary version, Star Office. Sun offers on-site support
during the installation and importation process as well as training for employ-
ees, all with minimal disruption to an organization. With Sun’s help, even
large companies can easily convert to OpenOffice.org. And training can be
tailored to the needs of your company (or your government, for example).
The URL for Sun’s training and support is www.theofficeworkshop.com.
If you need someone to help you work out any problems with OpenOffice.org,
you can hire a consultant. OpenOffice.org is widely used, with an estimated
8 million users at this writing, and its usage is growing by leaps and bounds.
Many computer consultants use it themselves and are fully experienced with
it. Also, if you want to modify the program to your liking, you can do that as
well. OpenOffice.org uses easy-to-understand XML-based file formats, and the
source code is freely available. Also, OpenOffice.org has a community of
100,000 people, many of whom are volunteer programmers working on the
code. Hiring someone to do something that he is already doing for free
should be no problem.
Community Support Is Excellent
One of the main reasons for the success of OpenOffice.org is its community
support. Since the launch of the OpenOffice.org Web site on May 1, 2002, an
estimated 8 million people have adopted the product and 100,000 people
have joined the community project. Sun Microsystems substantially funds
the project, but it is the volunteer community that controls most of the
coding and documentation contributions. The community also provides free
online support in the form of documentation, e-mail discussion lists, and
forums on the Web. Support comes readily from this active community. Also,
OpenOffice.org has gained much success around the globe because the com-
munity helps translate it into many different languages.
The OpenOffice.org community is made up of generous volunteers who are
willing to give their time and energy to further the cause of free software. A
large and very active segment of the community is even devoted to marketing
OpenOffice.org, even though this segment has nothing to gain from the
endeavor — because it’s free!
320
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

The volunteer spirit that abounds around OpenOffice.org is a boon to every
OpenOffice.org user.
File Formats Are Open Standards
OpenOffice.org uses XML-based file formats that are easy for programmers to
understand and easy for computer programs to interoperate with. Unlike
Microsoft Office and other proprietary office suites, the OpenOffice.org file
formats are publicly documented instead of being trade secrets. As a result,
you never have to worry about a file format becoming obsolete or being
unable to access your data. With open source software, you can always
access your data.
Not only are the file formats open standards, but you can also acquire the
source code for the entire program. This allows you to reconfigure and
recompile the program to suit your own tastes. All the tools that are needed
to build a new version of the software are free and open to everyone. However,
OpenOffice.org is a huge program with over 75 million lines of code, so few
people attempt to substantially redesign the software.
Anyone can redistribute OpenOffice.org for free, or sell it in any format,
for example, on a CD-ROM. Also, anyone can modify the program and sell his
or her own version. In short, anyone can do whatever he or she wants with
the program as long as that person complies with the terms of the licenses
under which it is distributed. These licenses basically require you to allow
anyone else to modify, distribute, and sell any copies of OpenOffice.org that
you publish.
The availability of the source code also ensures that no secret back doors or
spyware is built into your program that could permit a company to eaves-
drop on your activities. 
It’s on Every Major Platform
What if you want to communicate seamlessly with people who work on other
platforms?
OpenOffice.org works on every Windows and every UNIX platform, plus Linux,
Solaris, Mac OS X (via X11), FreeBSD, LinuxPPC, IRIX, Linux S/390, and TRU64.
Microsoft Office only works on Windows and Mac operating systems. And at
any time, Microsoft could decide to discontinue its versions for the Mac, just
as it has decided to discontinue making new versions of Internet Explorer for
the Mac.
321
Chapter 19: Ten Reasons to Use OpenOffice.org

To date, OpenOffice.org has been translated into 23 languages, and it uses
internationally standardized technology that is reported to be remarkably
robust. It can also import and export virtually every major word processing,
spreadsheet, presentation, and graphics file format. In fact, according to one
testimonial on the OpenOffice.org site, someone who was unable to open his
corrupted Excel file with Excel could open it with OpenOffice.org!
With 16 million downloads of OpenOffice.org and operation on so many plat-
forms, what other software package is poised to become so ubiquitous?
Lock In Is Locked Out
Microsoft Office uses proprietary file formats that it often changes when it
publishes major new versions of its programs. Older versions of Office are
often unable to read the formats that are created by newer versions. Therefore,
even if you don’t care about (or need) the new features of Microsoft Office, you
must constantly buy the upgrades, just to be able to read other people’s files
(unless they take pity on you and export their files to a previous file format). In
this way, you are locked in to always buying the most current upgrade of
Microsoft Office. As one Microsoft Office user remarked, “Microsoft’s office
suite seems less and less like a suite and more and more like a tollbooth.”
Using OpenOffice.org breaks the cycle of everyone having Microsoft Word,
thus requiring you to have it, too. You can almost flawlessly import from and
export to Microsoft Word formats, although some styles and macros could be
lost. And other formats can just as easily be read by Calc, Impress, and Draw.
You don’t need to worry about having to buy new upgrades just to read new
files. The volunteers at OpenOffice.org can supply new upgrades to import
and export any new Word file formats. With 8 million people currently using
OpenOffice.org and depending on this service, it will happen.
Choice Is Good
For years, Microsoft has systematically worked to become the de facto stan-
dard in as many software categories as possible. This has been an immensely
profitable strategy for the company, but do you really want all your software
to come from a single monopoly?
OpenOffice.org competes in a way that’s very difficult for Microsoft to crush,
because OpenOffice.org is free. Thanks in no small part to the power of the
Internet, OpenOffice.org can incorporate the good ideas, the development
and debugging talents, and the marketing skills of tens of thousands of volun-
teers from around the world to create a product with an amazing range of 
features.
322
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

You never have to fear that the product will become extinct because its
source code will always be available, and programmers even in the distant
future will always be able to revise and revive it. Growth and evolution occur
in a marketplace when people can make choices, and in a monopoly market,
no choice exists. And choice is good.

 Getting commercial support
Getting Help on Your Desktop
By now, you have probably noticed that almost every dialog box in
OpenOffice.org has a Help button. These buttons take you straight to the
appropriate section in the Help system.
You can also access Help by choosing Help➪Contents. Click the Contents tab
to look through the table of contents, click the Find tab to search for your
topics, or click the Index tab to find your topic in the index. Help covers a
wide range of topics and is quite “help”ful. See Chapter 2 for more informa-
tion on Getting Help.
Searching the E-Mail Archives
at OpenOffice.org
The best way to find support for OpenOffice.org, besides hiring someone to
fix your problem for you, is to check out the e-mail lists. These lists involve
thousands of people and are extremely active. Since joining in September,
2002, I’ve received 33,751 messages to date. That’s about 3,000 per month. So,
keep in mind the fact that your question may have already been asked before.

Rather than immediately posting questions to an e-mail list, the proper eti-
quette is to check the archives first.
To search the e-mail lists archives, perform the following steps:
1. In your Web browser, go to Open.Office.org’s home page,
www.openoffice.org.
2. Click Mailing lists on the main menu, which is in a column in the left
side of the window.
The Mailing Lists Guidelines page appears. If you are considering post-
ing to an e-mail list, read these guidelines.
3. Click Mailing Lists.
The General & Project Mailing Lists page appears.
4. Scroll down to General Mailing Lists, and locate the list of your
choice.
The lists include users, announce, and discuss. Other lists in the general
mailing lists are devoted to the project of developing the program. You
probably want to search the users or the discuss lists. The users list
addresses specific problems that need fixing, whereas the discuss list is
more general and provides a broader discussion of topics that pertain to
OpenOffice.org.
If English is not your native language, check out the foreign language
lists in the Project section.
5. Click Search for the mailing list of your choice.
The Search Messages window appears, with a Search field.
6. Choose whether you want to summarize your search results by date,
author, subject, or thread.
Unless you are searching for time-sensitive material, we recommend
summarizing by subject or thread.
7. Enter your topic in the Search field.
You can type in a general one-word description of your topic and then
browse through the results. Or, you can choose a more specific descrip-
tion with multiple words, by using the plus sign (+) as a logical AND
between words or by placing multiple words in quotation marks.
8. Select whether you want to search the subject or the body of the 
messages.
9. Click Search.
Your results are listed.
326
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Posting to the E-Mail Lists
at OpenOffice.org
If you searched the archives and didn’t find the answer to your question, try
posting your question on a list. You don’t have to join any list in order to post
a question, although e-mails sent by non-subscribers are moderated to avoid
spam.
To post a message, send an e-mail to the address of the list. The address of
the users list is users@openoffice.org, and the address of the discuss list
is discuss@openoffice.org. Then search or browse the archives periodi-
cally for your answer. Expect to wait at least 24 hours for a response. If you
don’t receive one after a few days, your question was probably passed over
because it had been asked many times before and the answer lies in the
archives. Or, it may have been vague or not readily understandable. Check
the archives again, and rewrite the question as clearly as you can.
Searching the Newsgroups
You can also find the OpenOffice.org e-mail lists in the newsgroups that
are carried by Google Groups. The newsgroup is called mailing.comp.open-
office. Google has a different search engine than the one at OpenOffice.org,
and you may want to use it instead. To access the OpenOffice.org mailing lists
at Google, perform the following steps:
1. In your Web browser, surf over to www.google.com.
2. Click the Groups tab.
3. Click Advanced Groups Search.
4. Type in search criteria that briefly describe your question in one of
the four input fields.
5. In the Newsgroup text box, type mailing.comp.open-office.
6. Click Sort by relevance (unless your question is time-sensitive, in
which case you may want to sort by date instead).
If you get too many answers, you can repeat the procedure from Step 3
and narrow your search criteria.
Newsgroups, of course, are also accessible by newsgroup readers, which are
sometimes bundled with your e-mail software. If you haven’t already set up a
newsgroup reader, using Google Groups as described above is easier.
327
Chapter 20: Ten Places to Look for Support

Using Online Forums
In addition to the e-mail lists (which also post to Newsgroups), online forums
are very helpful. They are available at www.oooforum.org. The forums are as
follows:
 Setup and Troubleshooting
 OpenOffice.org Writer
 OpenOffice.org Calc
 OpenOffice.org Impress
 OpenOffice.org Draw
 OpenOffice.org Math
 OpenOffice.org Macros and API
Questions that are posted on the forums are often answered within just a few
hours.
Before you post your question, it is proper etiquette to search the archives to
see whether the question has already been answered. Type a keyword into
the search box, or click Advanced Search. In the Advanced Search dialog box,
type your search query, set your search options, and then click Search. If too
few or too many results appear, either browse through the results or click the
Search button at the top of the window and change your search criteria.
If the answer to your question is not in a previous thread, consider posting a
new topic. To post a question on the forum, click the forum that you want to
post to and then click the New Thread button. A Post a new topic page
appears. Type in a user name, a topic, and your message. Try to formulate
your question clearly and completely. Spend some time on it, because lots of
people may read it. When you’re satisfied with your message, click Preview to
preview the message or click Submit to submit your message.
Surfing the OpenOffice.org Web Site
The OpenOffice.org Web site primarily provides downloads of OpenOffice.org
and organizes the community for refining and improving the program. The site
also hosts the wonderful e-mail lists. But some other goodies exist as well. If
you’re excited about OpenOffice.org, and want to make other people excited
about it too, direct them to the Product Description link on the Home page.
This Web page, along with its links, thoroughly describes the features of each
program in the Suite in a fascinating way, and also offers reviews, case studies
328
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

and testimonials. Links to fifteen foreign language sites are accessible by click-
ing the Site Map link on the Home page. And, if you need some extra guidance
installing the program, the Setup Guide for OpenOffice.org 1.1 offers detailed
installation instructions; the URL is as follows:
http://documentation.openoffice.org/setup_guide/index.html
For more information on installing OpenOffice.org, see Appendix A.
OO Extras: Extras for OpenOffice.org
The OO Extras Web site, located at http://ooextras.sourceforge.net/,
offers clip art galleries such as a Flow Chart Symbol gallery as well as some
nice icons and graphics. It also offers Impress templates and has some for-
eign language goodies. Everything is community generated and free to use.
Using Other Online Resources
Because OpenOffice.org is free, it inspires others to give freely as well. The
following sections outline some goodies that are available from the Web.
The OpenOffice.org Unofficial
FAQ v0.1.5a
A nice list of FAQs for OpenOffice.org is available at the following URL:
http://www.bytebot.net/openoffice/faq.html
This site has useful frequently asked questions, including “Is there a grammar
checker?” and “How do I get my scanner to work under OpenOffice.org?” If
you don’t want to type in the entire URL, you can find a link to it at www.
oooforums.org.
Useful macro information for OpenOffice
by Andrew Pitonyak
This free 241-page online book can be found at www.pitonyak.org/oo.php.
The book is in OpenOffice.org’s .sxw format, of course. Pitonyak’s Web site
also has lots of good stuff about macros and some great links.

Community-based tech support: How to
get help with OpenOffice.org
You can find a nice online reference, in PDF format, at the following URL:
www.mackmoon.com/OOoHelpOutline.html
This 19-page document covers mailing lists, forums, and other useful topics.
Signing Up for Classes and Training
Training for OpenOffice.org is offered by many consultants. You’ll probably
want to find someone in your area — or at least in your country. If you live in
the United States or Canada, you can visit http://getOpenOffice.org for
information on training by Solveig Haugland, the author of OpenOffice.org
Resource Kit and The StarOffice 6.0 Companion.
You may find training through these resources:
 Search the Web for OpenOffice.org training.
 Post a message on the e-mail list at OpenOffice.org and see whether
anyone in your area gives lessons, especially if you are searching for
individual training.
 Inquire at your local computer store.
Make sure that you get references and recommendations before you sign up
for training.
For languages other than English, check out the e-mail lists at OpenOffice.org
that are in your language. You can always check the archives and see who is
offering training, or you can post an e-mail.
Getting Commercial Support
Third-party commercial support is widely available as well for migration assis-
tance or for general support. To find commercial support in your area, use the
same techniques as you would to find training instructors. In fact, your training
instructor may also offer commercial support. You can search the Web, post a
message on the e-mail list, or even inquire at your local computer store. Lots of
programmers use OpenOffice.org and know its ins and outs. Someone who
lives near you may volunteer with the community OpenOffice.org project and
be a veritable expert. Again, always check references.

 Installing for Windows
 Installing for the Mac
 Installing for Linux
 Downloading upgrades
I
nstalling OpenOffice.org is easy and simple. You can either download the
program from the OpenOffice.org Web site, or you can find it on the CD-ROM
that accompanies this book — how much more convenient can you get?
OpenOffice.org is an ongoing project, so it is always changing and evolving.
As a result, you may want to download the latest beta version from the Web
site to get the newest features. But because beta software is not finalized and
formally released, you can expect it to have a few bugs. Many OpenOffice.org
users are the adventurous type and like participating in testing the software
and reporting bugs so that the programmers can improve OpenOffice.org.
If you don’t like taking risks, you can stick to version 1.1, on the CD-ROM, or
version 1.0.3 for the Mac. Then, you can always update to the next fully
tested version when it is released.
Installing on Windows
If you install OpenOffice.org from the CD-ROM that accompanies this book,
you should check the system requirements, discussed in the next section,
and then skip to the section “Starting installation.” To download OpenOffice.
org from the Web site (www.openoffice.org), keep reading.
System requirements
You should make sure that your system can handle OpenOffice.org. If you
have another office suite up and running, you shouldn’t have any problem.

However, if you have an older, rickety computer, be sure that you have the
following items:
 A Pentium-compatible processor.
 Microsoft Windows 98, NT, 2000, or XP (2000, Me, or XP is required for
Asian/CJK versions).
 64MB of RAM (more is recommended).
 250MB of hard drive space. The OpenOffice.org file is a little more than
60MB.
 An Internet connection, if you intend to download the program from the
OpenOffice.org Web site.
 A decompression utility, such as WinZip, if you intend to download the
program from the OpenOffice.org Web site.
Downloading from the Web site
Download OpenOffice.org from the Web site if you want the latest beta ver-
sion. To download OpenOffice.org, follow these steps:
1. Go to www.openoffice.org.
2. Click the hyperlink for the version of the software that you want.
You are sent to the download page of the version that you chose. 
3. Scroll down and read the information on this page.
Partway down, you see the list of all the language versions of
OpenOffice.org. 
4. Scroll to the bottom of the page, where you can see the download
sites.
If you click the Windows link on the home page, you go directly to these
download sites.
5. Click a link under the geographic area and language that you want. If
you see several links, you can choose any one.
Your browser starts the download. You may have to choose a location in
which to save the file. If you are given a choice to open or save the
download file, choose to save. Now all you have to do is wait! When the
download is complete, you may see your decompression utility (such as
WinZip) open.
332
OpenOffice.org For Dummies 

6. If your decompression utility is open with a list of all the files, choose
File➪Copy and copy the downloaded file to a temporary folder.
Create a temporary folder for the purpose of decompressing all the files.
Later, you can delete all these files and keep only the compressed (.zip)
file. If you saved the downloaded file to a specific location, you can skip
this step.
7. Navigate to the file that you downloaded, and decompress it.
For example, in Windows Explorer, double-click the file to open it in your
decompression program. Then follow the instructions for your decom-
pression program to extract all the files to a temporary folder.
You are now ready to install OpenOffice.org.
Starting installation
After you decompress the installation file, you are ready to start installation.
You should have a long list of files in your temporary folder. Follow these
steps to begin the installation:
1. From all the files that you extracted, find the readme.txt file and
double-click it.
The readme document opens. This document contains information that
didn’t make it into the formal Help system or other information that you
should read before installing. When you’re done reading this document,
you can close it.
2. Find the setup.exe file, and double-click it.
The OpenOffice.org installation program opens. The first installation
screen appears. At this point, you should close other programs that you
have open.
To perform a multiuser installation, go to the following Web site for
instructions:
www.openoffice.org/dev_docs/instructions.html
3. Click Next.
The next screen appears, displaying some information about
OpenOffice.org. For example, OpenOffice.org encourages you to register
your software and tells you that you can register at any time at the fol-
lowing Web site:
www.openoffice.org/welcome/registration-site.html
333
Appendix: Installing OpenOffice.org

A list of mailing lists also appears. We recommend that you at least sub-
scribe to the users’ group, because that’s a great way to get help when
you need it.
Subscribe to the digest version only; otherwise you’ll get dozens of
e-mails a day.
4. Read the information, and click Next.
The Software License Agreement screen appears. You’re supposed to
read it! Scroll down or press Page Down as you read.
5. When you finished reading the agreement, click the I Accept the
Terms of This Agreement button. To check the agreement in more
detail later, click the Print button. Then click Next.
The Enter User Data screen appears.
6. In the Enter User Data screen, complete the information about your-
self and click Next.
Some of this information may already be filled in, taken from the user
information on your computer. OpenOffice.org uses this information for
templates (such as your name and address at the top of letterhead), to
identify who makes changes to documents, and for other similar, legiti-
mate purposes. You don’t have to fill out all the information. When you
click Next, the Select Installation Type dialog box appears.
7. In the Select Installation Type dialog box, choose the type of installa-
tion that you want and click Next.
Most people can choose Typical installation. Choose Custom if you’re
picky, and choose Minimal if you’re short on hard drive space. The
screen informs you how much space each type of installation requires.
When you click Next, the Select Installation Directory dialog box
appears.
8. In the Select Installation Directory dialog box, accept the default, type
a new directory, or click the Browse button to navigate to a new loca-
tion. Click Next.
Directory is geek talk for folder. If your folder doesn’t exist, OpenOffice.
org asks permission to create the folder. It’s fine to say yes. OpenOffice.
org displays the Start Copying dialog box.
9. Click the Install button.
The Setup Program dialog box appears.
Pay attention here. Some people end up making the wrong decision in
this dialog box. It’s not easy to change this decision later on.
334
OpenOffice.org For Dummies 

10. If you have Microsoft Office documents on your computer and you
want OpenOffice.org to open these documents when you double-click
them in Windows Explorer, select the check boxes. If not, deselect
these check boxes. If you want OpenOffice.org’s HTML editor to be
your default editor, select the Default HTML Editor check box. If not,
deselect the check box. Click OK.
You can always open Microsoft Office documents in OpenOffice.org by
opening OpenOffice.org first and then choosing File➪Open. At some
point, the Java Setup dialog box appears.
11. If you have a Java Runtime Environment listed, choose it. If not, select
the Do Not Use Java with OpenOffice.org check box. Click OK.
So what is a Java Runtime Environment? Java is a programming lan-
guage. OpenOffice.org uses Java for advanced features such as database
connectivity and form creation. You don’t need Java, but it’s nice to
have it if you want to use OpenOffice.org’s advanced capabilities. You
can always get it later, at http://java.sun.com. Double-click the 
jvmsetup.exe file, which is located in your OpenOffice.org Program
folder. When you click OK, the installer starts to copy files.
12. When you see the message Installation Complete, click OK.
You’re done! Now choose Start➪Programs➪OpenOffice.org 1.1 and have fun
with your new, full-featured, free office suite!
Installing on the Mac
In June 2003, OpenOffice.org 1.0.3 was released for the Mac OS X (pro-
nounced Mac O S Ten) operating system. However, OpenOffice.org is not writ-
ten as a native program for the Mac. It requires an open source program
called X11, which is a layer of graphics software that most Unix and Linux
graphics applications use. Using X11 made it easier for programmers to adapt
OpenOffice.org for the Mac. The native version for the Mac that does not
require X11 is being developed but is probably a year or two away from being
released.
To run OpenOffice.org 1.0.3 on the Mac, you need to first install X11. It’s an
easy program to install and run. X11 makes OpenOffice.org look more like a
Linux program than a Mac program, so it may be a little disorienting at first,
but you get used to it quickly. The biggest challenge may be remembering to
press Control+C, Control+X, and Control+V instead of Ô+C, Ô+X, and Ô+V.
335
Appendix: Installing OpenOffice.org

X11 is included on the CD-ROM that accompanies this book. To install X11
and OpenOffice.org using the CD-ROM, check out the system requirements
that we discuss in the next section, and then skip to the section “Starting
installation for OpenOffice.org 1.0.3.” However, if you misplaced the CD-ROM —
or your daughter ran over it with her tricycle (or Festiva) — and you want to
download X11 and OpenOffice.org from the OpenOffice.org Web site, keep
reading.
System requirements
OpenOffice.org 1.0.3 for the Mac OS X operating system using X11 requires
the following to run: 
 Mac OS X 10.2 or higher or Darwin 6.0 or higher
 256MB of RAM (memory) (512MB is recommended)
 300MB free hard drive space
 600MB additional hard drive space for installation of auxiliary applica-
tions that are required to run OpenOffice.org
 1GB additional free space on your system drive for use as a swap file
during installation and execution
 G4/400 or higher processor
Downloading X11
Skip this section if you intend to use the program that is provided on the
CD-ROM that accompanies this book.
Downloading and installing X11 is a piece of cake. Follow these steps to do so:
1. Open your browser window, and go to www.apple.com/macosx/x11/.
The X11 for Mac OS X page appears.
2. Click the Download X11 Public Beta button.
The Get X11 for Mac OS X page appears. Read this for additional infor-
mation on X11.
3. Scroll down to the Tell Us Who You Are (Optional). Either deselect the
I Would Like to Receive Apple News, Software Updates check box or
enter your e-mail address in the input box. (You can also enter your
name.)

4. Scroll down, and click the Download X11 button.
It takes about 10 minutes to download X11 through our DSL connection.
To monitor the download progress, open the Download Manager
window on Internet Explorer (or the equivalent on the browser that you
are using). In Internet Explorer, choose Window➪Download Manager.
Installing X11
To install X11, perform the following steps:
1. If you downloaded the X11 file, double-click the X11UserForMacOSX.
dmg file. Internet Explorer places the file on the desktop. Otherwise,
search for the file on your computer or use the file that’s on the
CD-ROM.
A few copying progress bars appear and disappear. Then a folder
window opens that contains the following two files: Readme.rtf and
X11UserForMacOSX.mpkg. You don’t need to read Readme.rtf. That
information is incorporated into the installer program. You get to see it
later.
2. Double-click the Open Box icon.
An Authenticate dialog box appears, asking you for the password of the
administrative user. If you install software on your Mac, you’re probably
the administrative user, so this is typically the same password that you
type to log on.
3. Type your password, and click OK.
The Welcome to the Mac OS X X11 Installer window appears. Okay, you
can breathe a sigh of relief now, especially when you see the message
You will be guided through the steps necessary to install
this software. It’s always nice when your computer takes good care of
you.
4. Click the Continue button.
The Important Information window appears. This is where you find the
Readme file. It’s always fun to see what’s considered “important,” but
don’t worry if it sounds too technical. You don’t need to know most of
this material.
5. Click the Continue button.
The Software License Agreement appears. Fortunately for us, it is a great
license agreement. 
337
Appendix: Installing OpenOffice.org

6. Select the Agree check box.
The Destination dialog box appears. If you have more than one hard
drive, more than one icon appears from which you can choose your
destination drive. However, if you have just one hard drive, this is a 
no-brainer.
7. Click the icon of the hard drive where you want to install X11, and
click the Continue button.
The Easy Install dialog box appears.
8. Click the Install button.
A progress bar appears. On our computer it takes about 5 minutes to
install X11. You then see the message Software was successfully
installed.
9. Click the Close button.
Congratulations! Now you have X11 installed. It’s time to download and
install OpenOffice.org.
Downloading OpenOffice.org 1.0.3
Skip this section if you plan to use the enclosed CD-ROM for your installation.
To Download OpenOffice.org 1.0.3 for the Mac OS X (X11) operating system,
follow these steps:
1. Using your browser, go to www.openoffice.org.
The Web page appears as shown in Figure A-1.
2. Under the Download OpenOffice.org 1.1 RC3 heading, click the Mac
OS X (X11) link.
Don’t be surprised when the download does not take place. Instead, a
new window appears, with a list of links to News, Notes, FAQs, and
Screenshots. This is worth reading only if you’re interested.
3. Click the Download link.
A list appears with different countries and various bits of information.
Because OpenOffice.org is so big (173MB) and so many people down-
load it (at this writing, over 16 million have downloaded it since 2002),
one location can’t handle all the downloads. So computers around the
world share the job.
4. Click a location that’s near you. (Don’t worry about whether the Type
is HTTP or FTP. For now, either of them is okay.) You can also select
the language that you want for your version.
338
OpenOffice.org For Dummies 

Another window appears with links to some files and possibly a greeting
and some technical information. Don’t spend much time reading it. All
you need is the link to the file to be downloaded.
5. Click the download link, ooo103darwingm.dmg.gz.
Your download begins.
6. If you are using Internet Explorer, choose Window➪Download
Manager if the Download Manager window is not visible. If you use
another Web browser, open the equivalent of the Download Manager
window to see how long your download is expected to take.
If your Download Manager reports a lengthy download — 6 hours or
so — cancel the download and delete the partial file that you down-
loaded. Then click the Back button in your browser to choose another
site from which you can download the file.
With a DSL connection, our computer downloads the 170MB file in about
an hour.
Starting installation for 
OpenOffice.org 1.0.3
To install OpenOffice.org for the Mac OS X operating system, perform the fol-
lowing steps:
1. Close all programs that you have running on your computer.
If other programs are running, they may interfere with the installation.
2. If you are using the enclosed CD-ROM, insert the CD-ROM into your
CD-ROM drive and go to the next step. Otherwise, follow these steps:
• If you downloaded the program, locate the OOo 1.0.3 X11 folder
on your desktop. This folder contains the Install_OpenOffice.org
icon.
• If you can’t find this folder, locate the ooo103darwingm1.dmg.gx
file, which is probably on the desktop, and double-click it.
3. Yep, you guessed it. Double-click the Install_OpenOffice.org icon. This
file is either on your desktop or on your CD-ROM, depending on what
method you are using to install OpenOffice.org.
The Introduction dialog box appears, and the following message is dis-
played: ZeroG Install Anywhere will guide you through the
installation of OpenOffice.org. Okay, go ahead and breathe a
sigh of relief here.
339
Appendix: Installing OpenOffice.org

Don’t worry when you see the message For full functionality,
XFree86, dlcompat, freetype and ghostscript are also
required. These items are all included with the download and on the
CD-ROM.
4. Click Next.
The Software License Agreement dialog box appears.
5. Click the I Accept the Terms of the License Agreement button. (Feel
free to read the license agreement, of course.) Click Next.
The Important Information window opens.
6. Read through the important information (or skip it, if you’re not 
interested).
Don’t worry when you see the following message: Who should use
this build? It is ideally targeted to developers and
advanced Mac OS X and Darwin users who are comfortable
using X11. You don’t have to know anything about X11.
7. Click Next.
The Choose Install Folder dialog box appears.
8. You should probably click the Restore Default Folder button, but if
you want to place OpenOffice.org somewhere else, click the Choose
button. Then designate the folder of your choice in the dialog box that
appears, and click OK.
9. Click Next.
The Choose Default Paper Size dialog box appears.
10. Select the US Letter check box or the A4 check box, and click Next.
The Choose Subcomponents dialog box appears with its typical list of
programs that it plans to install: OpenOffice.org 1.0.3, fondu, dlcompat,
and ESPGhostscript. The installer leads you through the installation of
each of these programs. Fortunately, the installation is similar for all of
them.
11. Select the Typical option button, and click Next.
The Preinstallation Summary window appears, showing a summary of
what you requested and how much space it will take as well as how
much hard drive space is available on your computer.
12. Click the Install button.
A window appears stating that the Darwin PPC version is intended for
users who are comfortable using the X11 program. This is just a
reminder that it’s not going to look like a normal Mac program — but
you already knew that.
340
OpenOffice.org For Dummies 

13. Click OK.
The following message is displayed: The dlcompat installer will
now be started. You may need to bring the dlcompat installer to the
front after it is started by clicking its icon in the Dock.
14. Click OK.
The Authenticate dialog box appears, requesting your password.
15. Type in your password, and click OK.
A progress bar appears with the following message: Executing 
dlcompat installer. However, if you take no action at this point,
you could wait for hours or days. This progress bar actually represents
nothing!
16. Click the Install Dlcompat window behind the progress bar.
The window comes to the front, and the progress bar disappears
behind it.
The message Welcome to the DLCompat Installer is displayed.
17. Feel free to ignore all the Geekese on this page, and click the
Continue button.
The Important Information window appears.
18. Forget about reading this stuff. Just click the Continue button.
The license agreement appears.
19. Click the Continue button.
The dialog box asks you to choose Agree or Disagree.
20. It’s a good license, so click the Agree button.
The Select a Destination dialog box appears.
21. Click the icon of the drive on which you want to install OpenOffice.
org. (It’s safest to choose the same drive that your system files are on.)
Then Click the Continue button.
The Easy Install dialog box appears.
22. Click the Install button.
A progress bar appears along with a message indicating that the soft-
ware has been successfully installed.
23. Click the Close button.
A new window appears, displaying the message The ESP Ghostscript
Installer will now be started.
24. Click the Launch Installer button.
The Authenticate dialog box appears.
341
Appendix: Installing OpenOffice.org

25. Perform Steps 15 through 23 for the EPS Ghostscript program. (Note
that the ESP Ghostscript program contains no Important Information
page, so you can skip Step 18.)
A new window appears, displaying the message The fondu Installer
will now be started.
26. Click the Launch Installer button.
The Authenticate dialog box appears.
27. Perform Steps 15 through 23 for the fondu program.
A new window appears, displaying the message XDarwin does not
exist in Applications directory. Don’t worry about this.
28. Click OK.
A progress bar appears in the Installing Open Office window. A new
window appears, displaying the message Install complete.
29. Click the Done button.
Hurray! You did it! Now see if it works. (Don’t worry — it will.)
To start OpenOffice.org for the first time, perform the following steps:
1. Open the file Applications/OpenOffice.org1.0.3/Start OpenOffice.org.
The Choose Application dialog box appears, displaying the question
Where is your preferred XWindows Server? (If this dialog box
does not appear, your computer is smarter than ours.)
2. In the list box, scroll down and select X11. Click the Choose button.
The X11 menu appears and a strange-looking window, labeled xterm,
appears. Fortunately, the only thing that you need to do is to close this
window (and only if the sight of it really annoys you).
A blank OpenOffice.org Writer document appears, and the OpenOffice.
org Registration dialog box appears.
3. By now you are probably so tired of installing the program that you
most likely want to mark the “Never register” button. But maybe the
“Remind me to register later” button is a more rational choice.
4. Click OK.
That’s it! Now you have OpenOffice.org on your Mac! It’s a great program!
Enjoy!
Everything about installing OpenOffice.org is straightforward — except for
one thing. After typing a password in the Authenticate dialog box and seeing
the progress bar that appears, you must click the Install dialog box again and
click the Continue button. Otherwise, the progress bar continues churning

forever. (This is mentioned in the installation instructions, but with the reams
of material that are provided during the installation, it’s easy to overlook that
point.)
Installing on Linux
Most people who run the Linux operating system also use OpenOffice.org.
The two go together like pizza and pineapple.
To install OpenOffice.org using the enclosed CD-ROM, first review the system
requirements that are presented in the next section. Then skip to the section
“Installing OpenOffice.org on Linux.”
System requirements
If you are running Linux on a newer computer, probably you don’t have to
worry about meeting the requirements for OpenOffice.org. For the record,
these requirements are as follows:
 Linux Kernel version 2.2.13 or higher
 Glibc2 version 2.2.0 or higher
 Pentium-compatible processor
 64MB RAM (memory)
 300MB available hard drive space (350MB for the CJK version)
 X Server with 800×600 or higher resolution, with at least 256 colors
 Gnome 2.0 or higher required for Assistive Technology Tools
 Window Manager
Downloading OpenOffice.org for Linux
You can skip this section if you plan to use the enclosed CD-ROM.
To download OpenOffice.org from the Web site, follow these steps:
1. Go to www.openoffice.org.
The OpenOffice.org Web page opens.
343
Appendix: Installing OpenOffice.org

2. Under the Download OpenOffice.org 1.1 RC3 heading, click Linux.
A new page opens, with a list of links to sites that offer the OpenOffice.
org Linux download.
3. Click a link that’s close to your location.
A window appears from your browser asking whether you want to open
or save the download.
4. Click the Save As button.
The Save As dialog box appears, with the name of the download,
OOo_1.rc3_LinuxIntel_install.tar.gz, in the Location input box.
5. Navigate to any directory using the up arrows and/or list box at the
top of the dialog box, and then click the Save button.
The Save As dialog box closes. The Download Manager window appears,
showing the progress of the download. (If the Download Manager
window does not appear, you can open it, for example, in Mozilla by
choosing Window➪Download Manager.)
The OOo_1.rc3_LinuxIntel_install.tar.gz file is downloaded to
your computer. (At about 77MB, the download takes 15 minutes on our
computer with a DSL connection.)
6. When the Download Manager indicates that your download is com-
plete, open the Ark KDE utility application (or some other application
that decompresses files).
If you are using Ark, a blank window appears, displaying the message No
files in current archive.
The following steps assume that you are using Ark.
7. Choose File➪Open.
The Open dialog box appears.
8. Navigate to the folder in which you saved the download. Then select
the OOo_1.rc3_LinuxIntel_install.tar.gz file and click OK.
A number of files appear in the Ark window.
9. Click the Extract icon.
A window dialog box appears
10. Enter the folder name that you want to extract to, or choose the
default. In the Files to be Extracted panel, select the All check box and
click OK.
The files are extracted into a new folder, called OOo 1.1rc3 LinuxIntel
install (which Ark creates), and Ark places the new folder within the
folder that you specified (or the default that is specified).
344
OpenOffice.org For Dummies 

Installing OpenOffice.org on Linux
Now that you have downloaded and uncompressed the OpenOffice.org files,
you can install the program. Or, if you plan to use the CD-ROM that accompa-
nies this book, you already saved yourself the trouble of downloading and
uncompressing the files. Just pop the CD-ROM into your CD-ROM drive.
To install OpenOffice.org, follow these steps:
1. Open the OOo 1.1rc3 LinuxIntel Install folder by double-clicking
it. (In some configurations, you can single-click to open the folder.)
(The folder is found either on the enclosed CD-ROM or in the direc-
tory that you specified in Step 10 of the previous section.)
The open folder contains a number of files, from f0001 to f426, plus some
Readme, and Setup, and Install files.
2. Double-click the Setup file.
Several progress bar windows appear and disappear. Then the
OpenOffice.org 1.1.0 installation window appears, displaying the mes-
sage Welcome to the OpenOffice.org 1.1.0 Setup.
3. Click Next.
The Important Information window appears. This may or may not be
important information to you.
4. Click Next.
The Software License Agreement appears. (Read the agreement if you
choose.)
5. Scroll down, click the Accept the License Agreement button, and click
Next.
A window appears that requests personal information. (No, this is not
online dating.)
6. You can fill in the information or leave the text boxes blank. Then
click Next.
The Select Installation Type dialog box appears.
7. Select the Standard check box (which is the default), and click Next.
The Select Installation Directory dialog box appears. This dialog box
suggests a new directory: /home/myDirectory/OpenOffice.org1.1.0.
(This varies according to your directory arrangement.)
8. Click Next.
A dialog box appears, indicating that the folder does not exist. You see
the message Create it now? If this message does not appear, skip to
Step 10.
345
Appendix: Installing OpenOffice.org

9. Click the Yes button.
The Start Copying dialog box appears.
10. Click the Install button.
The Java Setup dialog box appears. (The AutoPilot Data Source Reports
feature does not work without this program.)
11. Follow one of these steps:
• If you do not have a Java Runtime environment on your computer,
select the Install New Java Runtime Environment check box or select
the Do Not Use Java Runtime Environment check box. Click OK.
• If you already have a Java Runtime Environment, select a version in
the list box and click OK.
If you already have a Java Runtime Environment, if you chose not to
install a Java Runtime Environment, or if you have already proceeded
through the Java Runtime Environment installer, a progress bar appears
in the Installation dialog box. On our computer, this process takes 2 to 3
minutes.
A Confirm File Replacement dialog box appears if a file already exists.
12. Click the Replace All button.
After a few moments, the Installation Completed dialog box appears with
the good news.
13. Click the Complete button.
Now celebrate! Take a break, and help yourself to a bowl of your favorite
ice cream!
Downloading Upgrades
Upgrading OpenOffice.org is not much different from downloading and
installing it in the first place. For Windows and Linux versions, the installa-
tion program of the new version creates a new folder and installs everything
into the new folder, just like it did in the previous version. When the installa-
tion is complete, just click the new version to start your program. 
Upgrading the Mac is also similar to installing on it, although you can most
likely skip the downloading and installing of X11, unless the new version of
OpenOffice.org requires a new version of that, too.
After you download and install the program once, it is much easier to do it
again. And once you do it a second time, it becomes a snap to do it a third
time — and so on. All in all, it’s much easier to download and upgrade
OpenOffice.org than it is to order and buy an upgrade of any other leading
office program. And it’s easier on your bank balance, too.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the
copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.
The “Program”, below, refers to any such program or work, and a “work based on the
Program” means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to
say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modiﬁcations
and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limita-
tion in the term “modiﬁcation”.) Each licensee is addressed as “you”.
Activities other than copying, distribution and modiﬁcation are not covered by this License;
they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output
from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
(independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends
on what the Program does.
1.
You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you receive it,
in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that
refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option
offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
2.
You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work
based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modiﬁcations or work under the terms
of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
a)
You must cause the modiﬁed ﬁles to carry prominent notices stating that you changed
the ﬁles and the date of any change.
b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains
or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no
charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
c)
If the modiﬁed program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must
cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print
or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that
there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may
redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy
of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print
such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an
announcement.)
These requirements apply to the modiﬁed work as a whole. If identiﬁable sections of that
work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and
separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sec-
tions when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same
sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the
whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to
the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written
entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of deriva-
tive or collective works based on the Program.
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program
(or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium
does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.
3.
You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object
code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also
do one of the following:
a)
Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily
used for software interchange; or,
b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party,
for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a com-
plete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under
the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software inter-
change; or,
c)
Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute correspond-
ing source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and
only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
accord with Subsection b above.)
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modiﬁcations to
it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it
contains, plus any associated interface deﬁnition ﬁles, plus the scripts used to control compila-
tion and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code
distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a desig-
nated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place
counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to
copy the source along with the object code.
4.
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly pro-
vided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute
the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not
have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
5.
You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing
else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works.
These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modify-
ing or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your
acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing
or modifying the Program or works based on it.

6.
Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient
automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the
Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
on the recipients’ exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing
compliance by third parties to this License.
7.
If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other
reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court
order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then
as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license
would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies
directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this
License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circum-
stance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended
to apply in other circumstances.
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property
right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of
protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by
public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range
of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software
through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of
the rest of this License.
8.
If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by
patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program
under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In
such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
9.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General
Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present
version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program speciﬁes a version
number of this License which applies to it and “any later version”, you have the option of fol-
lowing the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this
License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
10.
If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution
conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserv-
ing the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and
reuse of software generally.

STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE

INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND

MANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU

12.
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY
COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GEN-
ERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAIL-
URE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
