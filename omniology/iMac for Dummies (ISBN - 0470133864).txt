About the Author
Mark L. Chambers has been an author, computer consultant, BBS sysop, pro-
grammer, and hardware technician for more than 20 years — pushing comput-
ers and their uses far beyond “normal” performance limits for decades now. His
first love affair with a computer peripheral blossomed in 1984 when he bought
his lightning-fast 300 BPS modem for his Atari 400. Now he spends entirely too
much time on the Internet and drinks far too much caffeine-laden soda.
With a degree in journalism and creative writing from Louisiana State University,
Mark took the logical career choice: programming computers. However, after
five years as a COBOL programmer for a hospital system, he decided there must
be a better way to earn a living, and he became the Documentation Manager for
Datastorm Technologies, a well-known communications software developer.
Somewhere in between writing software manuals, Mark began writing computer
how-to books. His first book, Running a Perfect BBS, was published in 1994 —
and after a short decade or so of fun (disguised as hard work), Mark is one of
the most productive and best-selling technology authors on the planet.
Along with writing several books a year and editing whatever his publishers
throw at him, Mark has also branched out into Web-based education, design-
ing and teaching a number of online classes — called WebClinics — for
Hewlett-Packard.
His favorite pastimes include collecting gargoyles, watching St. Louis
Cardinals baseball, playing his three pinball machines and the latest computer
games, supercharging computers, and rendering 3-D flights of fancy with
TrueSpace — and during all that, he listens to just about every type of music
imaginable. Mark’s worldwide Internet radio station, MLC Radio (at www.
mlcbooks.com), plays only CD-quality classics from 1970 to 1979, including
everything from Rush to Billy Joel to the Rocky Horror Picture Show.
Mark’s rapidly expanding list of books includes MacBook For Dummies; Apple
TV For Dummies; iMac For Dummies, 5th Edition; Mac OS X Leopard All-in-One
Desk Reference For Dummies; Building a PC_ For Dummies, 5th Edition;
Scanners For Dummies, 2nd Edition; CD & DVD Recording For Dummies, 2nd
Edition; PCs All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies, 2nd Edition; Mac OS X
Tiger: Top 100 Simplified Tips & Tricks; Microsoft Office v. X Power User’s
Guide; BURN IT! Creating Your Own Great DVDs and CDs; The Hewlett-Packard
Official Printer Handbook; The Hewlett-Packard Official Recordable CD
Handbook; The Hewlett-Packard Official Digital Photography Handbook;
Computer Gamer’s Bible; Recordable CD Bible; Teach Yourself the iMac Visually;
Running a Perfect BBS; Official Netscape Guide to Web Animation; and the
Windows 98 Troubleshooting and Optimizing Little Black Book.

His books have been translated into 14 different languages so far — his
favorites are German, Polish, Dutch, and French. Although he can’t read
them, he enjoys the pictures a great deal.
Mark welcomes all comments about his books. You can reach him at
mark@mlcbooks.com, or visit MLC Books Online, his Web site, at www.

Dedication
This book is dedicated to my youngest daughter, Rose Chambers — she of
the Cleo Beast, the Book at Bedtime, and the Barbie blankets — with all the
love and happiness I can give her.
Author’s Acknowledgments
A guide to Apple’s iMac should be as elegantly designed and straightforward
as the computer itself . . . and luckily, I had just the right mix of folks to make
sure that it turned out that way!
First, my thanks are due to my technical editor, Greg Willmore, who kept
watch on the accuracy of my facts, comments, and step-by-step procedures
concerning both the Apple iMac and Mac OS X Leopard. As always, copy
editor Teresa Artman leant both a superb eye and a ready sense of humor.
I’ve often said that Wiley’s Production team is the best in the business, and
the layout and composition of this book is proof positive — my appreciation
to everyone who leant a hand with the graphics, proofing, and cover work for
iMac For Dummies, 5th Edition.
As with all my books, I’d like to thank my wife, Anne; and my children, Erin,
Chelsea, and Rose; for their support and love — and for letting me follow 
my dream!
Lastly, I’d like to thank the two editorial professionals at Wiley who made 
this book happen: my good friend Bob Woerner, the acquisitions editor who
has guided my way through the jungle of technology yet again; and Paul
Levesque, my hard-working project editor. Gentlemen, it’s folks like you who
make this the greatest career on the planet — my heartfelt thanks to you
both from a very grateful Mac owner!

Introduction
S
keptical about your new anodized aluminum iMac, with that super-
charged Intel Core 2 Duo processor? Perhaps you’re thinking it’s too dog-
gone thin, or you’re wondering where all the buttons are. Shouldn’t there be
places to plug cables? And where the heck is the DVD drive you paid for?
(Oh, there it is, on the side, at the top right.)
Ladies and gentlemen, I have great news for you: Not only did you make The
Right Decision about which computer to buy — you shot a hole in one! 
The aluminum iMac does indeed look much different from the boring beige
and black boxes of the Windows bourgeoisie, but it also has everything a
computer power user could want: speed, the latest in hardware and standards,
a top-of-the-line LCD screen, and all the connectors you need to add just about
any device meant for today’s computers. And all packaged in a svelte, foxy
form that borders on modern art. This is one looker of a computer.
In addition to your iMac Core 2 Duo having doggone nearly everything you
could ever want (okay, I still don’t see a frozen yogurt dispenser), here’s what
it doesn’t have: bulk. Boasting the smallest footprint — the amount of desk-
top space — of any high-end computer available today, your iMac can practi-
cally fit on an end table!
I wrote this book especially for the proud Core 2 Duo iMac owner who wants
to make the most of this new stunning aluminum computer, so this book is a
guide to both the iMac hardware and Leopard, the latest version of Apple’s
superb Mac OS X (operating system). I start by describing the basics that
every iMac owner should know and then move on to chapters devoted to the
software that comes with your iMac. Along the way, you come across a gener-
ous sprinkling of power user tips and tricks that save you time, effort, and
money.
Like my half-dozen other For Dummies titles, I respect and use the same English
language you do, avoiding jargon, ridiculous computer acronyms, and confus-
ing techno-babble whenever possible. (Plus, I try to bring out the humor that’s
hidden inside every computer. Discovering how to use your iMac should be fun
and not a chore! )

What’s Really (Not) Required
If you’re not an engineer with a degree in Advanced Thakamology — imagine
that — no need to worry! Here’s a reasonably complete list of what’s not
required to use this book:
 I make no assumptions about your previous knowledge of computers
and software. I start at the beginning, where every book should start.
 Still considering buying an iMac? Heck, you don’t even need the com-
puter! If you’re evaluating whether the new iMac is right for you, this
book is a great choice. I introduce you to both the hardware and soft-
ware you get so you can easily determine whether the iMac is the
machine for you. (It is. Trust me.)
 Upgrading from the monster that is Windows XP (or the black hole that
is Vista)? I’ve got tips, tricks, and entire sections devoted to those hardy
pioneers called Switchers! You can see all about the similarities and dif-
ferences between the two operating systems as well as how you can
make the switch as easy and quick as possible.
 If your friends and family told you that you’re going to spend half your
life savings on software — or that no “decent” software is available for
Mac computers — just smile quietly to yourself! These are two persis-
tent myths about Mac computers, and those same folks are going to be
blown away by the images, music, movies, and documents you produce.
(Oh, by the way, the iMac comes complete with about a ton more soft-
ware than any Windows box, and the iLife ’08 suite of applications is
better than anything available on a PC!) To sum it up: You can do virtu-
ally everything in this book with the software that came with your iMac!
So what is required? Only your aluminum iMac computer and the desire to
become a power user (someone who produces the best work in the least
amount of time, and has the most fun doing it)!
This book was written using the latest Intel Core 2 Duo iMac computer, so
owners of older iMac computers might not be able to follow along with every-
thing I cover. If you upgraded an older iMac G5 or Intel iMac with Mac OS X
Leopard and the iLife ’08 application suite, you should be able to use most of
the book with no problem!
About This Book
Each chapter in this book is written as a reference on a specific hardware or
software topic. You can begin reading anywhere you like because each chap-
ter is self-contained. However, I recommend that you read the book from
front to back because the order of this book makes a great deal of sense.

iMac For Dummies,5th Edition 

Conventions Used in This Book
Even with a minimum of techno-speak, this book needs to cover the special
keys that you have to press or menu commands that you have to choose in
order to make things work — hence this short list of conventions.
Stuff you type
If I ask you to type (or enter) something, like in a text box or field, that text
appears in bold, like this:
Type me.
If I ask you to type a command within Mac OS X, that text appears like this:
Type me.
You usually have to press the Return key before anything happens when
entering a manual command.
Menu commands
I list menu paths and commands, using this format:
Edit➪Copy
This example of shorthand menu instruction indicates that you should click
the Edit menu and then choose the Copy menu item.
Web addresses
No up-to-date book on a computer would be complete without a bag full of
Web addresses for you to check out. When you see these in the text, they
look like this: www.mlcbooks.com.
For the technically curious
Your iMac is an elegant and sophisticated machine — and as easy-to-use as a
computer can be — but from time to time, you might be curious about the
technical details surrounding your hardware and software. (You probably 
disassembled alarm clocks as a kid, like I did.) Tangential techy stuff is pre-
3
Introduction

sented in sidebars, and you don’t have to read them unless you want to know
what makes things tick. (Pun by accident.)
How This Book Is Organized
After careful thought (read that flipping a coin), I divided this book into seven
major parts — plus an index, just because you deserve one! For your conve-
nience, cross-references to additional coverage of many topics are also sprin-
kled liberally throughout the book.
The Seven Parts Shall Be the following.
Part I: Know Your iMac
This part introduces you to the important features of your iMac — like where
all the cables connect (or don’t) — and helps you set up your system. I also
introduce Mac OS X Leopard, the Apple operating system that comes prein-
stalled on your aluminum iMac.
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X
Time to familiarize you with Leopard — how to take care of mundane chores
(like moving your stuff) as well as how to customize and personalize your
system until it fits like the proverbial glove! Switchers from the PC world will
be especially interested in mastering the ins and outs of Mac OS X. (Psst.
Friends, it ain’t hard. The Mac started out easier to use than a Windows PC,
and that has not changed.)
Part III: Connecting and Communicating
Time to jump into the one application you’re likely to use every single day:
your Safari Web browser! You can also read here about Apple’s .Mac Internet
subscriber service and how to connect your iMac for printing, scanning,
videoconferencing, and faxing. (I told you this thing was powerful, didn’t I?)
Part IV: Living the iLife
Ah, readers, you can begin humming happily to yourself right this second!
Yep, this part provides coverage of the latest iLife ’08 release, with the names
that are the envy of the Windows crowd: iTunes, iPhoto, iMovie, iDVD, and
4
iMac For Dummies, 5th Edition 

GarageBand. You see how to turn your iMac into the hub for all your digital
media. Whether you listen to it, display it, compose it, or direct it, this part of
the book explains it!
Part V: Sharing Access and Information
In Part V, I discuss how to share your iMac among a group of people or how to
connect your iMac to a network. (Wired or wireless, makes no difference to me!)
Part VI: The Necessary Evils: Trouble-
shooting, Upgrading, Maintaining
This is the stuff my Dad used to call the “Justin Case Guide.” That is, just in
case you want to upgrade your iMac with more memory or new hardware. If
you need to troubleshoot a problem with your hardware or software, my
should-be-patented troubleshooting guide resides in this part. Finally, I
describe what you can do to help keep your iMac running as fast and as 
trouble free as the day you took it out of the box!
Part VII: The Part of Tens
The three chapters that make up the famous “Part of Tens” section are served
in classic Late Night style: Each chapter contains a quick reference of tips
and advice on a specific iMac topic. Each list has ten concise tips, and one or
two readers have told me that they make excellent tattoos. (Personally, I’m
not that much of a Mac guru.)
If you're dying to find out how to share data among wireless devices via
Bluetooth technology and iSync –– or how to broadcast your music around
your house like Wolfman Jack –– check out the handy Bluetooth and Wireless
bonus chapter at the MLC Books Online Web Site (www.mlcbooks.com).
Icons Used in This Book
Like other technology authors, I firmly believe that important nuggets of
wisdom should stand out on the page! With that in mind, this For Dummies
book includes a number of margin icons for certain situations:
This is the most popular icon in the book, and you find these parked next to
suggestions that I make to save you time and effort (and even cash!).
5
Introduction

You don’t have to know this stuff, but the technologically curious love high-
tech details. (Of course, we’re great fun at parties, too.)
Always read the information for this icon first! I’m discussing something
that could actually harm your hardware or throw a plumber’s helper into
your software.
Consider these nuggets as highlighter stuff — not quite as universally
accepted (or as important to the author) as a Mark’s Maxim but good
reminders nonetheless. I use these icons to reinforce what you should
remember.
These nuggets are easily spotted; just look for the likeness of my rugged,
iMac-lovin’ mug. These are My Favorite Recommendations. In fact, I’ll bet just
about any iMac power user would tell you the same. Follow my Maxims to
avoid the quicksand and pitfalls that I’ve encountered with all sorts of Macs
for well over a decade!
Where to Go from Here
My recommendations on how to proceed? You know, I just happen to have
three:
 If you’re thinking about buying a new iMac, the box is still unopened in
your living room, or you’d like help setting things up, I would start with
Part I.
 If your iMac is already running but you’d like guidance with running 
Mac OS X — Windows Switchers, take note — start with Part II.
 For all other concerns, use the index or jump straight to the chapter you
need. (You can always return later, at your leisure.)
A Final Word
I’d like to thank you for buying this book, and I hope that you find iMac For
Dummies, 5th Edition, valuable! With this book in hand, I believe that you and
your aluminum iMac supercomputer will bond together as I have with mine.
(That sounds somewhat wrong, but it’s really not.) And with that in mind, a
concluding Mark’s Maxim (and the first in the book):
Take your time. Finding out how to use your computer isn’t a race. And don’t
worry if you’re not a graphic artist, a professional photographer, a video
editor, a programmer, or a mind reader. With your iMac and its software, you
don’t have to be!TM

iMac For Dummies, 5th Edition 

Part I
Know Your iMac

In this part . . .
Your iMac odyssey begins with a description of the
computer itself, as well as the details you need to
know when unpacking and setting up your newest family
member. You also find an introduction to Mac OS X
Leopard, the latest version of Apple’s super-popular 
operating system.

 Playing with your bundled software
 Buying additional stuff that you might need
Y
ou bought a brand-new iMac, and there it sits, in the box. Waiting.
Waiting for you.
If you’re a little nervous about unpacking that shiny aluminum-and-glass rec-
tangle, I completely understand. Face it: The latest iMac follows in the foot-
steps of many revolutionary iMac designs that have come before it. (In other
words, it doesn’t look like a computer at all, and that can be a bit disconcert-
ing.) And if you’re switching from a Windows PC to the Apple universe, you
might find yourself floating weightlessly in your office or your living room
without a familiar bulky beige box to anchor yourself. Hence the reluctance
you might be feeling.
However, dear reader, let me assure you that you’ve indeed made The Right
Choice. I commend you! The aluminum Intel iMac is the fastest, leanest, and
easiest-to-use self-contained all-in-one computer ever built. Practically every-
thing’s in one shining panel (except for your keyboard and mouse). You’ve
got one of the best liquid crystal display (LCD) screens on the planet, a
super-fast processor, room for a ton of RAM (memory), and a regular laundry
list of the latest technology. Best of all, you don’t have to be a techno-nerd to
use all that power!
In this chapter, I introduce you to your new dream machine, giving you an
overview of the more important locations within iMac City. I show you how 
to unpack your new computer, what wires go where, and where your iMac

should set up housekeeping. I preview the awesome software that’s waiting
within that powerful panel. Finally, I list the accessories that help keep both
you and your new iMac computing smoothly.
An Introduction to the Beast
The Intel iMac might look like a sculpture straight out of your local museum
of modern art, but it still sports everything that it needs to function as a com-
puter. In this section, I identify the important stuff that you need to live your
life — you know, write a term paper in Pages, hear the music you down-
loaded, or manage the affairs of those lazy Sims.
Major parts of your major appliance
Every computer requires some of the same gizmos. Figure 1-1 helps you track
them down. Of course, as you’d expect, a computer has a “body” of sorts in
which all the innards and brains are stored (the screen, in this case), a dis-
play screen, a keyboard, a mouse/pointing device, and ports for powering
and exchanging data with peripherals.

Part I: Know Your iMac 

That magnificent screen
Talk about efficiency: With the iMac, the 2"-thick border surrounding the dis-
play is actually your computer’s case! And what a view you’ve got because an
aluminum iMac is graced with either a 20" or 24" LCD display.
Once upon a time, LCD screens were strictly limited to notebook and laptop
computers, whilst desktop computer owners were saddled with huge, heavy
cathode ray tube (CRT) monitors. Luckily, the LCD panel has migrated to vir-
tually all the Apple computer product line, so notebook owners can no longer
be snobbish (at least about their screens, anyway). LCD screens use far less
electricity than their antique CRT ancestors, and they emit practically no
radiation.
Both sizes of iMac screens offer a widescreen aspect ratio (the screen is con-
siderably wider than it is tall), which augurs well for those who enjoy watch-
ing DVD movies. (A favorite editor of mine loves it when I use the antique
word augur, meaning to predict or foretell.) For example, the 24" screen boasts
a whopper 1920 x 1200 resolution.
That reminds me: Throw away your printed dictionary! You won’t need it
because Mac OS X Leopard includes the fantastic Dictionary widget that uses
the Internet to retrieve definitions from Dictionary.com. More on the
Dictionary widget in Chapter 7 . . . and yes, it does contain augur.
11
Chapter 1: Okay, This Machine Looks Really, Really Weird
Umm . . . my iMac isn’t aluminum
Believe me, I feel your pain. It seems like only
yesterday that Apple introduced its first gener-
ation of flat-panel iMac G4 models. (You know,
the ones that look like a milky-white, half-
basketball at the base.) The crew at Cupertino
tends to update their product line pretty often,
so if you have an older flat-panel iMac, you
might be feeling like an Edsel owner on his way
to catch Vertigo at the drive-in.
Ah, but friend, there’s good news on your hori-
zon: Those first-generation flat-panel iMacs are
still powerful personal platforms for productiv-
ity programs and peripherals! Don’t give up on
your older iMac yet (unless you just plain want
to upgrade). You still have a great LCD screen of
the same quality, a reasonably fast processor,
virtually all the same ports and options, and that
spiffy chrome-plated gooseneck to boot.
The same rule applies for the more recent (and
much more powerful) iMac G5, which can easily
run Mac OS X Leopard and handles just about
anything except the latest games and the most
in-depth video editing. Keep it and follow along,
and you’ll be able to use just about every bit this
book with aplomb.

The keyboard and mouse
Hey, here’s something novel for the Intel iMac — something external (outside
the computer’s case). Gotta have a keyboard and mouse, right? And you gotta
love the options with iMac: You can fly a little cheaper and remain entangled
in a corded world, or you can go nomadic . . . um, that is, wireless and free.
Getting wired
The iMac comes standard with a wired Apple keyboard and Mighty Mouse
optical mouse. The keyboard is a particular favorite of mine because from here
 You can either control the sound volume (using the volume control but-
tons F11 and F12) or mute all that noise completely (using the Mute
button F10).
 A handy-dandy Media Eject key lets you eject a CD or DVD.
Read about connecting your keyboard and mouse in the upcoming section,
“Absolutely essential connections.”
Going wireless
If you’re really fancy, you can opt for a truly 21st century computer and order
the Apple wireless keyboard ($79) and mouse ($69) combo! This dynamic
duo lets you sit back and relax with your keyboard in your lap, without being
tied down by a cord. (Say it with me: “Death to cords, death to cords.”) Just
stay within about 30 feet of your iMac screen, and sweet freedom is yours.
You can also feel safe using these wireless peripherals because they offer
secure 128-bit, over-the-air encryption, which helps keep sensitive informa-
tion safe while you type and click away. One downside about the wireless
keyboard, though: Unlike the standard Apple wired keyboard, the wireless
model doesn’t include any USB ports.
The wireless mouse needs a flat surface, but that’s what TV trays are for, right?
The disc slot
You’ll notice a long groove on the right edge of your iMac. No, it’s not for your
credit card. (If you order online often enough, you’ll memorize your card
number.) This slot accepts CDs and DVDs into your optical drive. If the drive is
empty, loading a disc is as simple as sliding it in an inch or so; the drive sucks
in the disc automatically. (And we don’t need no stinkin’ floppy drive. Macs
haven’t had floppy drives for years now, and the PC types are just beginning 
to follow.)
“Luke, the printed label side of the disc should always be facing you when
you load a disc. Always.”
12
Part I: Know Your iMac 

Yes, your computer has a foot . . . just one
You and I — normal human beings — would say that the iMac is supported
by a sturdy aluminum stand, but Apple calls it a foot. The foot lets you tilt the
iMac LCD panel up and down for the best viewing angle. Most important,
though, the foot minimizes the computer’s desk space requirements (or its
footprint). (Engineers . . . sheesh.) And yes, that foot is perfectly balanced and
quite stable, so there’s no danger of your treasured iMac taking a dive.
If you decide to get really snazzy and mount your 24-inch iMac to the wall,
you can remove the foot and install the VESA mounting adapter (available
separately for about $30). You can use any VESA standard mounting bracket
on your wall, too. You can be positioned within 30 yards or so of your wall-
mounted iMac with a wireless Apple keyboard and mouse.
Hey, Hewlett-Packard or Dell, can you mount one of those monolithic PCs to
the wall? I think not.
Food for your ears
A machine this nice had better have great sound, and the iMac doesn’t disap-
point. You have a couple of options for iMac audio:
 The iMac sports built-in stereo speakers (and a microphone to boot)
 Use built-in ports to connect your iMac audio to either
• More powerful (and more expensive) external speaker systems
• A home stereo system
The power cable
Sorry, but you can’t get a wireless power system . . . yet. (Apple’s working hard
on that one.) If you opt for the wireless keyboard and mouse setup (see the
earlier section, “Going wireless”), the power cable is actually the only required
cable that you need to run your computer! Now that’s sassy.
The power button
Yep, you’ve got one of these, too. It’s on the back of the case.
Those holes are called ports
Our next stop on your tour of Planet iMac is Port Central — that row of holes
on the back of your computer (see Figure 1-2). Each port connects a different
type of cable or device, allowing you to easily add all sorts of extra function-
ality to your computer.
Each of these stellar holes is identified by an icon to help you identify it.
Here’s a list of what you’ll find as well as a quick rundown on what these
ports do.
13
Chapter 1: Okay, This Machine Looks Really, Really Weird

 FireWire: These ports are the standard in the Apple universe for connect-
ing external hard drives and DVD recorders, but they do double duty as
the connector of choice for most digital video (DV) camcorders. (A periph-
eral is another silly techno-nerd term, meaning a separate device that you
connect to your computer.) Note that the iMac offers two FireWire ports:
one is the older FireWire 400 specification, and the other is the much-
faster FireWire 800 port. The ports are shaped differently, so you can’t
plug a FireWire 400 device into a FireWire 800 port in error.
 USB: Short for Universal Serial Bus, the familiar USB port is the jack-of-
all-trades in today’s world of computer add-ons. Most external devices
(such as portable hard drives, scanners, or digital cameras) that you
want to connect to your iMac use a USB port. The iMac sports three 
USB 2.0 ports on its back, and you’ll find an additional two USB ports
lurking at each end of your keyboard. USB 2.0 connections are much
faster than the old USB 1.1 standard.
For the specs on connecting your keyboard and mouse, see the upcoming
section, “Absolutely essential connections.”
For more on FireWire and USB ports, get the lowdown in Chapter 19.
 Ethernet: The iMac includes a standard 10/100/1000 Ethernet port, so
it’s ready to join your existing wired Ethernet network. (Alternatively,
you can go wireless for your network connection; find more on that in
the next section and in Chapter 17.)
Apple no longer includes a built-in modem on the iMac, so if you need 
a dialup connection to the Internet, you need an external 56K v.92 USB
modem. (Apple sells a USB modem, which can send and receive faxes, too.)

Part I: Know Your iMac 

 Mini-DVI: In case that splendid screen isn’t quite big enough, you can
add an adapter to this port and send the video signal from your iMac to
another LCD monitor or flatscreen TV with a DVI port. (Apple also offers
different adapters that can connect your iMac to standard VGA moni-
tors, projectors, and displays that use S-video or composite jacks.)
Connections for external audio
Your Intel iMac comes equipped with two pretty powerful stereo speakers on
the bottom of the case, but you’re certainly not limited to them. Apple pro-
vides a number of connectors to add a wide range of audiophile equipment to
your system.
 Headphone/Optical Output: You can send the high-quality audio from
your rectangular beast to a set of standard headphones or to an optical
digital audio device, such as a high-end, home theater system.
 Line In: Last (but certainly not least) is the audio Line In jack, which
allows you to pipe the signal from another audio device into your iMac.
This one comes in particularly handy when you record MP3 files from
your old vinyl albums or when you want to record loops within
GarageBand, which you can read more about in Chapter 15. This jack
supports both analog and digital input.
Important Hidden Stuff
When you bought your new digital pride and joy, you probably noticed 
a number of subtle differences between the low-end iMac and the uber-
expensive top-end model. I call these differences the Important Hidden 
Stuff (or IHS, if you’re addicted to acronyms), and they’re just as important 
as the parts and ports that you can see.
 Hard drive: The aluminum iMac uses the latest in hard drive technol-
ogy: namely, serial ATA hard drives, which are significantly faster than
the EIDE hard drives used in previous iMac models. (You don’t need to
worry about what ATA and EIDE mean here. Really.)
As I type these words, the iMac Core 2 Duo product line offers five differ-
ent hard drive sizes, depending on the processor speed and screen size
you choose: 250GB, 320GB, 500GB, 750GB, or an immense 1TB (yes,
friends and neighbors, that means terabyte, or 1000GB). The bigger, the
better.
 Optical drive: Okay, I’m cheating a little here. I mention the optical drive
in an earlier section, but all you can see is the slot, so it qualifies as an
IHS item. All new iMac models include a DVD-R SuperDrive (which can
play and record both CDs and DVDs).

Chapter 1: Okay, This Machine Looks Really, Really Weird

Time for a plug: If you’re interested in recording your own audio and
data CDs, or you’ve got an itch to burn DVD movies, I can highly recom-
mend the bestselling CD & DVD Recording For Dummies, 2nd Edition
(Wiley). (And written by yours truly; hence, the solid recommendation.)
Anyway, within its pages, you’ll find information on Roxio’s Toast record-
ing software. After a scant few minutes of study, you’ll be using that
information to burn your own shiny digital treasures.
 Wireless Ethernet: “Look, Ma, no wires!” As I mention earlier, your iMac
can join an existing wireless Ethernet network with its built-in AirPort
Extreme card. With wireless connectivity, you can share documents with
another computer in another room, share a single high-speed Internet
connection betwixt several computers, or enjoy wireless printing. Truly
sassy!
Although Apple would want you to build your wireless wonderland with
an Apple AirPort Extreme Base Station — go figure — you can actually use
your iMac with any standard 802.11g or 802.11n wireless network. And
yes, PCs and Macs can intermingle on the same wireless network without
a hitch. (Scandalous, ain’t it?)
 Bluetooth: Let’s get the old “digital pirate” joke out of the way: “Arrgg,
matey, I needs me a wireless parrot.” (Engineers again . . . sheesh.)
Although strangely named, Bluetooth is actually another form of wire-
less connectivity. This time, however, the standard was designed for
accessories like your keyboard and mouse, and devices like your per-
sonal digital assistant (PDA) and cellphone. Bluetooth is now built in 
to every aluminum iMac. 
 Video card: If your applications rely heavily on high-speed 3-D graphics,
you’ll be pleased as punch to find that your iMac comes equipped with
either an ATI Radeon HD 2400 XT card (for the lower-end model) or an
ATI Radeon HD 2600 Pro card (for the more expensive models). Both
cards are well suited to 3-D modeling, video editing, and well, honestly,
blasting the enemy into small smoking pieces with aplomb.
Choosing a Home for Your New Pet
If you pick the wrong spot to park your new iMac, I can guarantee that you’ll
regret it later. Some domiciles and office cubicles obviously don’t offer a
choice — you’ve got one desk at work, for example, and nobody’s going to
hand over another one — but if you can select a home for your iMac, con-
sider the important placement points in this section.
16
Part I: Know Your iMac 

Picking the right location
You know the mantra: Location, location, location.
 There’s always the wall. Your iMac can disguise itself as a particularly
interesting digital picture frame. With the right mounting adapter, you
can hang your computer right on the wall and snub your desk altogether.
This wall-mounted solution has two big problems:
• Your VESA mounting plate must be installed safely and correctly
(for example, using the studs within your walls).
The iMac is slim and trim, but it’s no lightweight, and it doesn’t
bounce well. You don’t want it to take a high dive!
• External peripherals aren’t happy campers — that includes any
FireWire and USB devices, which must either camp out on the floor
or on a nearby (and conspicuous) shelf. (Personally, I think the
cables for external devices tend to spoil the appearance of a wall-
mounted computer.)
Your iMac must be mounted at the proper height on the wall. It’s not
good ergonomic practice to sit more than two feet away from your iMac’s
screen, and the screen should be placed at (or slightly below) eye level.
I see two major requirements for a wall-mounted iMac:
• Don’t plan on using any external devices. Instead, opt for a wire-
less network with a remote printer and remote backup storage
space, like a Time Capsule unit on your network.
• Buy the wireless keyboard and mouse option when you buy your
computer!
 Keep things cool. Your new iMac is nearly silent, but that super-fast Intel
Core 2 Duo processor generates quite a bit of heat. Fans inside the case
draw the heat away. (Nothing like an overheated processor to spoil an
evening of Call of Duty 4.)
Follow these three rules to keep your cool. Make sure that
• The location you choose is far from heating vents.
• The location you choose is shielded from direct sunlight.
• Allow plenty of room below the machine (where the air enters the
case) and above the machine (where heated air escapes from 
the slot at the top of the case).
Hot air from a wall-mounted iMac can discolor the wall.

Chapter 1: Okay, This Machine Looks Really, Really Weird

Considering the convenience factor
Technology is nothing if you can’t make it convenient:
 Outlets, outlets, outlets! Your computer needs a minimum of at least
one nearby outlet, and perhaps as many as three:
• A standard AC outlet
• A telephone jack (if you use an external USB modem for connecting
to the Internet or sending and receiving faxes)
• A nearby Ethernet jack (if you use the iMac’s built-in Ethernet port
for connecting to a wired Ethernet network)
If you prefer to send your data over the airwaves, consider wire-
less networking for your iMac. I discuss everything you need to
know in Chapter 17.
 Don’t forget the lighting. Let me act as your Mom. (I know that’s a
stretch, but bear with me.) She’d say, “You can’t possibly expect to work
without decent lighting! You’ll go blind!” She’s right, you know. At a mini-
mum, you need a desk or floor lamp.
 Plan to expand. If your iMac hangs out on a desk, allow an additional
foot of space on each side. That way, you have space for external periph-
erals, more powerful speakers, and that wired keyboard and mouse.
Unpacking and Connecting
You are going to love this section — it’s short and sweet because the installa-
tion of an aluminum iMac on your desktop is a piece of cake. (Sorry about the
cliché overload, but this really is easy.)
Unpacking your iMac For Dummies
Follow these guidelines when unpacking your system:
 Check for damage. I’ve never had a box arrive from Apple with shipping
damage, but I’ve heard horror stories from others (who claim that King
Kong must have been working for That Shipping Company). Check all
sides of your box before you open it.
Take a photograph of any significant damage (just in case).
 Search for all the parts. When you’re removing those chunks o’ Styro-
foam, make certain that you check all sides of each foam block for parts
that are snuggled therein or taped for shipment.
18
Part I: Know Your iMac 

 Keep all those packing materials. Do not head for the trash can with
that box and those packing materials. Keep your box intact and also
keep all packing materials for at least a year until your standard Apple
warranty runs out. If you have to ship it to an Apple service center, the
box and the original packing is the only way for your iMac to fly.
And now, a dramatic Mark’s Maxim about cardboard containers:
Smart computer owners keep their boxes far longer than a year.TM
For example, if you sell your iMac or move across the country, you’ll
want that box. Trust me on this one.
 Store the invoice for safekeeping. Your invoice is a valuable piece of
paper, indeed.
Save your original invoice in a plastic bag, along with your computer’s
manuals and original software, manuals, and other assorted hoo-hah.
Keep the bag on your shelf or stored safely in your desk, and enjoy a
little peace of mind.
 Read the iMac’s manual. “Hey, wait a minute, Mark — why do I have to
read the manual from Apple along with this tome?” Good question, and
here’s the answer: There might be new and updated instructions in the
documentation from Apple that override what I tell you in this book.
(For example, “Never cut the red wire. Cut the blue wire instead.” Or
something to that effect.)
Besides, Apple manuals are rarely thicker than a restaurant menu.
Connecting cables like a true nerd
The iMac makes all its connections really simple, but your computer depends
on you to get the outside wires and thingamabobs where they go.
Absolutely essential connections
After your new iMac is resting comfortably in its assigned spot (I assume that’s
a desktop), you need to make a couple of connections:
 The power cable
Plug the cable into the corresponding socket on the iMac first; then plug
’er in to that handy AC outlet.
 The (wired) keyboard and mouse
• Plug the USB cable from your keyboard into one of the USB 2.0
ports on the back of the iMac.
• Plug the mouse into one of the USB 2.0 ports on the sides of your
keyboard.
19
Chapter 1: Okay, This Machine Looks Really, Really Weird

See the earlier section, “Those holes are called ports,” to see how
these ports are marked — and the connector fits only one way, due
to a blazing moment of inspired thinking by the designers of the
USB port!
If you bought your iMac equipped with the wireless keyboard and
mouse options, your batteries might need to be installed. After the
batteries are in, you’re set to go.
Adding the Internet to the mix
If you have Internet access or a local computer network, you need to make at
least one of the following connections.
If you don’t already have any Internet service, you’ll probably want to start
with local dialup Internet access (if you have an external USB modem for
your iMac). If you decide to investigate your high-speed options immediately,
your local cable and telephone companies can provide you with more infor-
mation on DSL or cable Internet service.
Dialup Internet access
If you get on the Internet by dialing a standard phone number, you’ll need an
external USB modem to connect your iMac. Follow these steps:
1. Plug your external USB modem into one of the USB ports on the back
of your iMac.
2. Plug one of the telephone cable’s connectors into your modem’s line
port.
3. Plug the other telephone cable connector into your telephone line’s
wall jack.
Networks and high-speed Internet access
If you have high-speed Internet service or if you’re in an office or school with
a local computer network, you can probably connect through the iMac’s
built-in Ethernet port. You make two connections:
1. Plug one end of the Ethernet cable into the Ethernet port on the iMac.
2. Plug the other end of the Ethernet cable into the Ethernet port from
your network. It’s probably one of the following:
• An Ethernet wall jack
• An Ethernet hub or switch
• A cable or DSL Internet router (or sharing device)

Will you be joining a wireless network? If so, you find all the details you need
in Chapter 17 to configure Leopard for wireless networking.
Discovering All the Cool 
Things You Can Do
This section answers the most common of all novice computer questions:
“What the heck will I do with this thing?” You find additional details and excit-
ing factoids about the software that you get for free, software you’ll want to
buy, and stuff you can do on the Internet.
What software do I get?
Currently, all iMac computers ship with these major software applications
installed and ready to use:
 The iLife suite: You know you want these applications! They turn your
iMac into a digital hub for practically every kind of high-tech device on
the planet, including DV camcorders, digital cameras, portable music
players, PDAs, and even cellphones.
Chapters 11–15 of this book focus on the five major applications that
make up iLife: iMovie, iDVD, iTunes, iPhoto, and GarageBand.
 The iWork suite: A demo version of Apple’s powerful office productivity
suite is included with your iMac. You can create documents, spread-
sheets, and presentations within Pages, Numbers, and Keynote. It’s much
like that Other Office Suite (the one that costs a bundle) from those guys
in Redmond.
Figure 1-3 illustrates a flyer under construction in Pages.
 Front Row: This onscreen menu system makes it easy to watch movies,
listen to your music, and display your favorite photos on that gorgeous
iMac screen . . . all remotely, using the supplied Apple Remote! I go into
the details of Front Row in Chapter 10.
The installed software on your iMac might change as new programs become
available.
21
Chapter 1: Okay, This Machine Looks Really, Really Weird

Looking forward to fun on the Internet
What is a modern computer without the Internet? Apple gives you great tools
to take full advantage of every road sign and offramp on the Information
Superhighway, right out of the box:
 Web surfing: I use Leopard’s Safari Web browser every single day. It’s
faster and better designed than Internet Explorer, with unique features
like tabbed browsing and built-in RSS feeds.
If tabbed browsing and RSS feeds sound like ancient Aztec to you, don’t
worry. Chapter 8 is devoted entirely to Safari.
 Web searches: Your Dashboard widgets can search the entire Internet
for stocks, movie listings, business locations, and dictionaries.
 Chat: iChat lets you use your iMac to chat with others around the world
for free via the Internet — by keyboard, voice, or (with your built-in
iSight Web camera) full-color video. This is awesome stuff straight out of
Dick Tracy and Buck Rogers. If you’ve never seen a video chat, you’ll be
surprised by just how good your friends and family look!
Always wear a shirt when videoconferencing.

Part I: Know Your iMac 

 E-mail: Soldier, Apple’s got you covered. The Mail application is a full-
featured e-mail system, complete with defenses against the torrent of
junk mail awaiting you. (Imagine a hungry, digital, saber-toothed tiger
with an appetite for spam.) Send pictures and attached files to everyone
else on the planet, and look doggone good doing it.
Applications that rock
Dozens of small applications are built into Mac OS X. I mention them in later
chapters, but here are three good examples to whet your appetite:
 iCal: Keep track of your schedule and upcoming events, and even share
your calendar online with others in your company or your circle of
friends. See how to keep your life in order in Figure 1-4.
 DVD Player: Put all that widescreen beauty to work and watch your
favorite DVD movies with DVD Player! You have all the features of
today’s most expensive standalone DVD players, too, including a spiffy
onscreen control that looks like a remote.
 Address Book: Throw away that well-thumbed collection of fading
addresses. Leopard’s Address Book can store, search, and recall just
about any piece of information on your friends, family, and acquaintances.
Figure 1-4:
Hey, isn’t
that iCal

your iMac?
You are
iTogether!
23
Chapter 1: Okay, This Machine Looks Really, Really Weird

You can use the data you store in your Address Book in other Apple
applications that are included with Leopard, such as Apple Mail and
iChat.
Would you like to play a game?
“All productivity and no play. . . .” Hey, Steve Jobs likes a good challenging
game as much as the next guy, so you can look forward to playing Chess on
your iMac right out of the box — ah, but this isn’t the chessboard your Dad
used! Play the game of kings against a tough (and configurable) opponent —
your iMac — on a beautiful 3-D board. Heck, your iMac even narrates the
game by speaking the moves!
Stuff You Oughta Buy Right Now
No man is an island, and no computer is either. I always recommend the same
set of stuff for new PC and Mac owners. These extras help keep your new
computer clean and healthy (and some make sure you’re happy as well):
 Surge suppressor or UPS (uninterruptible power supply): Even an all-
in-one computer like your iMac can fall prey to a power surge. I recom-
mend one of these:
• A basic surge suppressor with a fuse can help protect your iMac
from an overload.
• A UPS costs a little more, but it does a better job of filtering your
AC line voltage to prevent brownouts or line interference from
reaching your computer.
A UPS provides a few minutes of battery power during a blackout
so you can save your documents and safely shut down your iMac.
 Screen wipes: Invest in a box of premoistened screen wipes. Your iMac’s
screen can pick up dirt, fingerprints, and other unmentionables faster
than you think.
Make sure your wipes are especially meant for LCD or laptop computer
screens.
 Blank CDs and DVDs: Depending on the type of media you’re recording —
like computer data CDs, DVD movies, or audio CDs — you’ll want blank
discs for
• CD-R (record once)
• CD-RW (record multiple times)
24
Part I: Know Your iMac 

• DVD-R (record once)
• DVD-RW (record multiple times)
 Cables: Depending on the external devices and wired network connec-
tivity you’ll be using, these are
• A standard Ethernet cable (for wired networks or high-speed
Internet)
• FireWire or USB cables for devices you already have
Most hardware manufacturers are nice enough to include a cable
with their products, but there are exceptions, especially USB print-
ers. Shame on those cheapskates!
 A wrist rest for both your keyboard and mouse: You might have many
reasons to buy a new iMac, but I know that a bad case of carpal tunnel
syndrome is not one of them. Take care of your wrists by adding a key-
board and mouse rest (even for a wireless keyboard/mouse combo, even
on a TV tray).

I
f you’ve already been through Chapter 1, you got as far as unpacking your
iMac and connecting a number of cables to it. And unless you solely
bought this computer as a work of modern art, it’s time to actually turn on
your iMac and begin living The Good Life. (Plus, you still get to admire that
Apple design whilst using iTunes.) After you get your new beauty powered
on, I help you here with an initial checkup on your iMac’s health.
I also familiarize you with the initial chores that you need to complete — such
as using Mac OS X Setup as well as moving the data and settings from your
existing computer to your iMac — before you settle in with your favorite 
applications.
In this chapter, I assume that Mac OS X Leopard (version 10.5) was preinstalled
on your iMac or that you just completed an upgrade to Leopard from an ear-
lier version of Mac OS X. (If you’re upgrading, your iMac is already turned on,
and you can skip the next section!)
Throwing the Big Leaf Switch
Your iMac’s power switch is located on the back of the computer, at the
lower-left corner of the case (as you look at the screen). Press it now to turn
on your iMac, and you hear the pleasant startup tone that’s been a hallmark
of Apple computers for many years now. Don’t be alarmed if you don’t imme-
diately see anything onscreen because it takes a few seconds for the initial
Apple logo to appear.

In my experience, a simple quick press of the power button on some iMacs
sometimes just doesn’t do it. Instead, you actually have to hold down the
button for a count of two or so before the computer turns on. However, if
your iMac ever locks up tight (and you can’t quit an application, as I demon-
strate in Chapter 4), the power button gives you another option. Just hold it
down for a count of five, and your iMac shuts off. (Yep, this trick works even
if your iMac is locked up tight.)
While the Apple logo appears, you see a twirling, circular high-tech progress
indicator appear that looks like something from a Star Wars movie. That’s the
sign that your iMac is loading Leopard and checking your internal drive for
problems. Sometimes the twirling circle can take a bit longer to disappear. 
As long as it’s twirling, though, something good is happening.
Next, Leopard displays the soon-to-be-quite-familiar Aqua Blue (yup, that’s its
name) background while it loads certain file sharing, networking, and print-
ing components (and such). This time, you get a more conservative progress
bar, but the end result is the same. Just wait patiently a bit longer.
At last, your patience of a whole 10–15 seconds is rewarded, and after a short
(but neat) video, you see the Leopard Setup Assistant appear.
Mark’s Favorite Signs of a Healthy iMac
Before you jump into the fun stuff, don’t forget an important step — a quick
prelim check of the signs that your iMac survived shipment intact and happy.
(Although the shipping box that Apple uses for the aluminum iMac series is
one of the best I’ve ever encountered in 20-plus years of shipping computer
hardware, your computer could still have met with foul play.)
If you can answer Yes to each of these questions, your iMac likely made the
trip without serious damage:
1. Does the computer’s chassis appear undamaged?
It’s pretty easy to spot damage to your iMac’s svelte metal and glass
design. Look for scratches, puncture damage, and misalignment of the
screen.
2. Does the LCD screen work, and is it undamaged?
I’m talking about obvious scratches or puncture damage to your screen.
Additionally, you should also check whether any individual dots (or
pixels) on your LCD monitor are obviously malfunctioning. Bad pixels
either appear black or in a different color than everything surrounding
them.
28
Part I: Know Your iMac 

Techs call these irritating anarchists dead pixels. Unfortunately, many
new LCD screens include one or two. After all, a 20" iMac screen sports
literally more than one million pixels.
3. Can you feel a flow of air from the vent on top?
Your iMac’s Intel processor generates quite a bit of heat, so the fan
system never turns off completely. If you don’t feel warm air from the fan
system after your iMac has been on for a minute or two, you might have
a problem.
4. Do the keyboard and mouse work?
Check your iMac’s USB (Universal Serial Bus) ports by moving the mouse;
the cursor should move on your screen. To check the keyboard, press the
Caps Lock key on the left and observe whether the green Caps Lock light
turns on and off.
If you do notice a problem with your iMac (and you can still use your Safari
browser and reach the Web), you can make the connection to an Apple sup-
port technician at www.apple.com. If your iMac is lying on its back with its
foot in the air and you can’t get to the Internet, you can check your phone
book for a local Apple service center, or call the AppleCare toll-free number
at 1-800-275-2273. Chapter 18 also offers troubleshooting information.
Harriet, It’s Already Asking 
Me Questions!
After your iMac is running and you’ve given it the once-over for obvious ship-
ping damage, your next chore is to set up your iMac. Unlike other tasks in
this book, I won’t cover the setup process step by step. Apple constantly
“tweaks” the questions that you see during setup on a regular basis, and the
questions are really very easy to answer. Everything is explained onscreen,
complete with onscreen Help if you need it.
However, I do want you to know what to expect as well as what information
you need to have at hand. I also want you to know about support opportuni-
ties, such as the AppleCare Protection Plan and the Apple .Mac Internet ser-
vices. Hence this section: Consider it a study guide for whatever your iMac’s
setup procedure has to throw at you.
Setting up Mac OS X Leopard
After you start your iMac for the first time — or if you just upgraded from an
earlier version of Mac OS X — your iMac will likely automatically launch 
the Leopard set-up procedure. (Note that some custom install options, like
29
Chapter 2: Life! Give My iMac Life!

the Archive and Install option, might not launch the Setup procedure.) The
set-up process takes care of a number of different tasks:
 Setup provides Leopard with your personal information.
As I mention in Chapter 1, your iMac ships with a bathtub full of different
applications, and many of those use your personal data (like your address
and telephone number) to automatically fill out your documents.
If that personal stored information starts you worrying about identity
theft, I congratulate you. If you’re using your common sense, it should.
However, in this case, Apple doesn’t disseminate this information any-
where else, and the applications that use your personal data won’t send
it anywhere, either. And Safari, the Apple Web browser, fills out forms on
a Web page automatically only if you give your permission.
 Setup configures your language and keyboard choices.
Mac OS X is a truly international operating system, so Setup offers you a
chance to configure your iMac to use a specific language and keyboard
layout.
 Setup configures your e-mail accounts within Apple Mail.
If you already have an e-mail account set up with your Internet service
provider ( ISP), keep that e-mail account information that the ISP pro-
vided handy to answer these questions. (The list should include the
incoming POP3 and outgoing SMTP mail servers you’ll be using, your
e-mail address, and your login name and password. Don’t worry about
those crazy acronyms — your ISP will know exactly what you mean when
you ask for this information.) Leopard can even automatically configure
many Web-based e-mail accounts for you (including Google Mail, Yahoo!
Mail, and AOL Mail) if you supply your account ID and password. Sweet.
 Setup allows you to open a trial subscription with Apple’s .Mac service.
A .Mac subscription service provides you with online file storage, iSync
capability across multiple computers, backups to your online storage,
Apple e-mail accounts (through both Web mail and the Apple Mail appli-
cation), and your own acre of Web site on the Internet. I go into all these
in detail in Chapter 9. For now, just sign up and take the opportunity to
feel smug about owning an Apple computer.
 Setup sends your registration information to Apple.
As a proud owner of an iMac, take advantage of the year of hardware
warranty support and the free 90 days of telephone support. You have 
to register to use ’em, but rest assured that all this info is confidential.
 Setup launches Migration Assistant.
This assistant guides you through the process of migrating (an engineer’s
term for moving) your existing user data from your old Mac or PC to your
new iMac. Naturally, if your iMac is your first computer, you can skip this
step with a song in your heart! (Read more on Migration Assistant in the
section, “Importing Documents and Data from Your Old Mac.”)
30
Part I: Know Your iMac 

Registering your Mac
I’ll be honest here: I know that many of us, myself included, don’t register
every piece of computer hardware we buy. For example, I didn’t register my
wireless Bluetooth adapter that I bought for my older iBook because the total
expenditure cost was only around $40, the gizmo has no moving parts, and
I’m never likely to need technical support to use it or get it fixed.
However, your iMac is a different kettle of fish altogether, and I strongly rec-
ommend that you register your purchase with Apple during the setup
process. You spent a fair amount on your computer, and it’s an investment
with a significant number of moving parts.
Even the hardiest of techno-wizards would agree with this important Mark’s
Maxim:
If you don’t register your iMac, you can’t receive support.TM
And rest assured that Apple is not one of those companies that constantly
pesters you with e-mail advertisements and near-spam. I’ve registered every
Apple computer I’ve owned, and I’ve never felt pestered. (And I have an
extremely low tolerance for pester.)
Importing Documents and 
Data from Your Old Mac
If you’re upgrading from an older Mac running Mac OS X to your new iMac, I
have great news for you: Apple includes the Migration Assistant utility appli-
cation that can help you copy (whoops, I mean, migrate) all sorts of data from
your old Mac to your new machine. The list of stuff that gets copied over
includes
 User accounts: If you set up multiple user accounts (so that more than
one person can share the computer), the utility ports them all to your
new iMac.
 Network settings: Boy, howdy, this is a real treat for those with manual
network settings provided by an ISP or network administrator! Migration
Assistant can re-create the entire network environment of your old Mac
on your new iMac.
 System Preferences settings: If you’re a fan of tweaking and customizing
Mac OS X to fit you like a glove, then rejoice. The Assistant actually
copies over all the changes that you’ve made within System Preferences
on your old Mac! (Insert sound of angelic chorus of cherubim and
seraphim: Hallelujah!)
31
Chapter 2: Life! Give My iMac Life!

 Documents: The files in your Documents folder(s) are copied to your
new iMac.
 Applications: Migration Assistant tries its best to copy over the third-
party applications that you’ve installed in your Applications folder on the
older Mac. I say tries its best because you might have to reinstall some
applications, anyway. Some developers create applications that spread
out all sorts of files across your hard drive, and the Assistant just can’t
keep track of those nomadic files. Too, some other applications make the
trek just fine, but you might have to reenter their serial numbers.
Setup launches its Migration Assistant automatically if you indicate that you
need to transfer stuff during the Setup process, but you can always launch
Migration Assistant manually at any time. You’ll find it in the Utilities folder
inside your Applications folder; just double-click the Migration Assistant icon.
To use Migration Assistant to copy your system from your older Mac, you
need a FireWire 400 cable (compatible with most Macs made within the last
five years or so) to connect the computers. If you don’t already have one, you
can pick up a standard FireWire cable at your local Maze o’ Wires electronics
store or at your computer store. (This cable will probably come in handy in
the future as well, so it’s not a one-use wonder.)
Follow these steps to use Migration Assistant:
1. Click Continue on the opening screen.
Migration Assistant prompts you for your account name and password
that you create during the Setup procedure, as shown in Figure 2-1. Your
account is an admin account, meaning that you have a higher security
level that allows you to change things within Leopard. (Much more
detail on user accounts is covered in Chapter 16.)

Characters in your password are displayed as bullet characters for secu-
rity. After you’ve successfully entered your admin account name and
password, this dialog disappears and you get to play in the real
Migration Assistant dialog.
3. Select the From Another Mac radio button and then click Continue.
You can also restore your iMac’s data from a Time Machine backup
drive, using Migration Assistant.

Continue.
5. Restart your older Mac while holding down the T key.
This restarts your older computer in FireWire Target Disk mode, in which
your older Mac essentially becomes a huge external FireWire hard drive.
(Neat trick.)
You must hold down the T key until you see the FireWire symbol (which
looks like a stylized Y) appear on your older machine.

to copy (see how in Figure 2-3) and then click Continue.
9. Select the check boxes next to the settings that you want to transfer
(as shown in Figure 2-4).
Typically, you want to migrate all three of these settings groups:
Network Settings, Time Zone, and Sharing Settings.

Importing Documents and 
Data from Windows
If you’re a classic Windows-to-Mac Switcher, you made a wise choice, espe-
cially if you’re interested in the creative applications within the iLife ’08 suite!
Although you can choose to start your Apple computing life anew, you proba-
bly want to migrate some of your existing documents and files from that tired
PC to your bright, shiny, new iMac.
Unfortunately, no Windows Migration Assistant exists within Mac OS X.
However, if you’re moving from a Windows PC to an iMac, you can copy your
files manually from a CD or DVD, from a USB Flash drive, or over a network.
(Note, however, that the iMac doesn’t come with a floppy drive. And trust
me, you wouldn’t want to use one to move anything that matters, anyway.)
The Mac OS X Help system contains an entire subsection on specific tricks
that you can use when switching from Windows to Mac, including how to con-
nect to a Windows network and how to directly connect the two computers.
Because Leopard can’t run Windows programs (at least, not without extra
software), moving applications (think Paint Shop Pro) won’t do you any good.
In general, however, you can move documents, movies, photos, and music
without a problem. Table 2-1 illustrates what can be moved between Windows
and Mac OS X as well as the application that you use in Leopard to open those
files and documents.
35
Chapter 2: Life! Give My iMac Life!
Switching from a PC to . . . an Apple PC?
With the Leopard Boot Camp feature, you can
actually create a full Windows XP or Vista
system on your Intel iMac. Yup, Windows and
Leopard coexist peacefully on the same com-
puter. As you can read later in the book in
Chapter 21, you have to reboot your computer to
use your iMac as a Windows system.
This brings a whole new meaning to the term
Switcher because some iMac owners are
moving their stuff from Windows (running on
their old PC) to . . . well, Windows (running 
on their new iMac) rather than Leopard. If you
do decide to create a Windows system on your
iMac by using Boot Camp, the files and folders
on your existing PC can be copied directly by
using the Files and Settings Transfer Wizard (in
Windows XP) or the Windows Easy Transfer
utility (in Windows Vista). In effect, you’re copy-
ing your settings and data between your old PC
and your new Apple-based PC! (That sounds a
little skewed, but die-hard Apple apostles will
have to forgive me.)

If you don’t mind investing around $50, try using the Move2Mac software util-
ity, which does most of the work of Migration Assistant for those switching from
a Windows PC. From Detto Technologies (www.detto.com/mac-file-transfer.
html), Move2Mac comes complete with a special USB-to-USB cable that
connects your two computers for high-speed copying. With Move2Mac, you
can choose what you want to transfer to your new iMac (use Table 2-1 as a
guide), and the copying is done automatically for you. Plus, Move2Mac also
transfers goodies like your home page and bookmarks from Internet Explorer,
desktop backgrounds, and even your Address Book contacts and account set-
tings from Outlook Express. Move2Mac makes switching much easier, and I
can highly recommend it.

Introducing the Apple 
of Your iMac
In This Chapter
 Introducing Mac OS X Leopard
 Appreciating the Unix core underneath Leopard
 Recognizing similarities between Windows XP and Leopard
 Getting help while exploring Leopard
I
n the other books that I’ve written about Mac OS X Leopard, I use all sorts
of somewhat understated phrases to describe my operating system of
choice, such as elegantly reliable, purely powerful, and supremely user friendly.
But why is Leopard such a standout? To be specific, why do creative profes-
sionals and computer techno-wizards across the globe hunger for the very
same Mac OS X that runs your iMac? Why is Leopard so far ahead of Windows
Vista in features and performance? Good questions, all!
In this chapter, I answer those queries and satisfy your curiosity about your
new big cat. I introduce the main elements of the Leopard Desktop, and I
show you the fearless Unix heart that beats underneath Leopard’s sleek exte-
rior. I also point out the most important similarities between Leopard and
Windows Vista, and I outline the resources available if you need help with
Mac OS X.
Oh, and I promise to use honest-to-goodness English in my explanations, with
a minimum of engineer-speak and indecipherable acronyms. (Hey, you’ve got
to boast about Leopard in turn to your family and friends. Aunt Harriet might
not be as technologically savvy as we are.)

A Quick Tour about the Premises
Leopard is a special type of software called an operating system. You know,
OS, as in Mac OS X? That means that Leopard essentially runs your iMac and
also allows you to run all your other applications, such as iTunes or Photo-
shop CS3. It’s the most important computer application — or software — that
you run.
Think of a pyramid, with Leopard as the foundation and other applications
running on top.
You’re using the OS when you aren’t running a specific application, such as
these actions:
 Copying files from a CD to your hard drive
 Choosing a different screensaver
Sometimes, Leopard even peeks through an application while it’s running. For
example, actions like these are also controlled by Leopard:
 The Open, Save, and Save As dialogs that you see when working with
files in Photoshop CS3
 The Print dialog that appears when you print a document in Microsoft
Word
In this section, I escort you personally around the most important hotspots
in Leopard, and you meet the most interesting onscreen thingamabobs 
that you use to control your iMac. (I told you I wasn’t going to talk like an
engineer!)
The Leopard Desktop
This particular desktop isn’t made of wood, and you can’t stick your gum
underneath. However, your Leopard Desktop does indeed work much like the
surface of a traditional desk. You can store things there, organize things into
folders, and take care of important tasks like running other applications.
Heck, you’ve even got a clock and a trash can.
Gaze upon Figure 3-1 and follow along as you venture to your Desktop and
beyond.

Part I: Know Your iMac 

Meet me at the Dock
The Dock is the closest thing to the dashboard of a car that you’re likely to
find on a Macintosh. It’s a pretty versatile combination — it’s one part orga-
nizer, one part application launcher, and one part system monitor. From here,
you can launch applications, see what’s running, and display or hide the win-
dows shown by your applications.
Each icon in the Dock represents one of the following:
 An application that you can run (or that is running)
 An application window that’s minimized (shrunk)
 A Web page
 A document or folder on your system
 A network server or shared folder
 Your Trash

Figure 3-1:

39
Chapter 3: Introducing the Apple of Your iMac

I cover the Dock in more detail in Chapter 5.
The Dock is highly configurable:
 It can appear at different sides of the screen.
 It can disappear until you move your mouse pointer to the edge to call it
forth.
 You can resize it larger or smaller.
Dig those crazy icons
By default, Leopard always displays at least one icon on your Desktop: your
Mac’s internal hard drive. To open a hard drive and view or use the contents,
you double-click the icon. Other icons that might appear on your Desktop
can include
 CDs and DVDs
 An iPod
 External hard drives or USB Flash drives
 Applications, folders, and documents
 Files you downloaded from the Internet
 Network servers you access
Chapter 4 provides the good stuff on icons and their uses within Leopard.
There’s no food on this menu
The Finder menu isn’t found in a restaurant. You find it at the top of the
Desktop, where you can use it to control your applications. Virtually every
application that you run on your iMac has a menu.
To use a menu command, follow these steps:
1. Click the menu group (like File or Edit).
2. Choose the desired command from the list that appears.
Virtually every Macintosh application has some menu groups, such as File,
Edit, and Window. You’re likely to find similar commands within these
groups. However, only two menu groups are in every Mac OS X application:
 The Apple menu (which is identified with that jaunty Apple Corporation
icon, Ú).
 The application menu (which always bears the name of the active appli-
cation). For instance, the DVD Player menu group appears when you run
the Leopard DVD Player, and the Word menu group appears when you
launch Microsoft Word.
40
Part I: Know Your iMac 

I cover these two common groups in more detail in Chapters 4 and 5.
You can also display a contextual menu — regular human beings call it a right-
click menu — by right-clicking your Leopard Desktop, or on an application,
folder, or file icon. I discuss right-click menus in detail in the next chapter.
There’s always room for one more window
You’re probably already familiar with the ubiquitous window itself. Both
Leopard and the applications that you run use windows to display things like
 The documents that you create
 The contents of your hard drive
The window in Figure 3-1 is a Finder window, where Leopard gives you access
to the applications, documents, and folders on your system.
Windows are surprisingly configurable. I cover them at length in Chapter 4.
What’s going on underneath?
How the core is designed makes more of a difference than all the visual bells
and whistles, which tend to be similar between Windows XP and Mac OS X
Leopard (and Linux as well, for that matter). Time for a Mark’s Maxim:
Sure, Leopard’s elegant exterior is a joy to use, but Mac OS X is a better OS
than Windows because of the unique Unix muscle that lies underneath!TM
41
Chapter 3: Introducing the Apple of Your iMac
Isn’t Windows Vista the latest thing?
You’ve seen highly customized “pocket rocket”
compact cars with the flashy paint jobs, huge
noisy mufflers, and aerodynamic fiberglass stuff.
You might think that these cars are real road
racers, but what’s underneath is different. The 4-
cylinder engine that you don’t see is completely
stock. These cars don’t perform any better than
a mundane model straight from the factory.
The same holds true for Microsoft Windows
Vista, which was another attempt by the folks at
Redmond to put a modern face on an antique OS.
Forget the flashy colors and the visual effects:
Windows Vista is simply more of the same (at
least it’s newer than Windows XP, which was
beginning to creak). Sure, it’s more reliable and
faster than older versions of Windows, but
there’s not a boatload of innovative features in
Vista. (Unfortunately, if you’re running PC hard-
ware, the only other practical choice for a com-
puting novice is Linux, which is still regarded as
too complex by major manufacturers like Dell
and Hewlett-Packard. Therefore, with a PC,
you’re usually stuck with Windows XP or
Windows Vista — or you’ve picked up a very
expensive paperweight.)

So what should you and I look for in an OS? Keep in mind that today’s com-
puter techno-wizard demands three requirements for a truly high-powered
software wonderland — and Mac OS X Leopard easily meets all three:
 Reliability: Your OS has to stay up and running reliably for as long as
necessary — I’m talking months here — without lockups or error mes-
sages. If an application crashes, the rest of your work should remain
safe, and you should be able to shut down the offending software.
 Performance: If your computer has advanced hardware, your OS must
be able to use those resources to speed things up big-time. The OS has
to be highly configurable, and it has to be updated often to keep up with
the latest in computer hardware.
“Mark, what do you mean by advanced hardware?” Well, if you’re already
knowledgeable about state-of-the-art hardware, examples include
• True 64-bit computing
• Multiple processors (like more than one Intel chip in your com-
puter)
• A huge amount of RAM (4GB on the iMac, or far more on today’s
Power Mac computers)
• Enough hard drive space to make use of a RAID array
If all that sounds like ancient Sumerian, gleefully ignore this technical
drabble and keep reading.
 Ease of use: All the speed and reliability in the world won’t help an OS if
it’s difficult to use.
DOS was the PC OS of choice before the arrival of Windows. It was
doomed because it wasn’t intuitive or easy to master, requiring a PC
owner to remember all sorts of commands that looked like hieroglyph-
ics. (This is one of the reasons why the Macintosh was so incredibly
popular in the days of DOS-based PCs. Macs had a mouse, and they 
were a snap to master and use.)
Similarities with That Windows Behemoth
You might have heard of the Windows Switcher: a uniquely intelligent species
that’s becoming more and more common these days. Switchers are former PC
owners who have abandoned Windows and bought a Macintosh, thereby join-
ing the Apple faithful running Mac OS X. (Apple loves to document this migra-
tion on its Web site.) Because today’s Macintosh computers are significantly
faster than their PC counterparts — and you get neat software, such as
Leopard and the iLife suite when you buy a new Mac — switching makes per-
fect sense.
42
Part I: Know Your iMac 

Switchers aren’t moving to totally unfamiliar waters. Windows XP, Windows
Vista, and Leopard share a number of important concepts. Familiarizing your-
self with Leopard takes far less time than you might think.
Here’s an overview of the basic similarities between the two operating 
systems:
 The Desktop: The Leopard Desktop is a neat representation of a real
physical desktop, and Windows uses the same idea:
• You can arrange files, folders, and applications on your Desktop to
help keep things handy.
• Application windows appear on the Desktop.
 Drives, files, and folders: Data is stored in files on your hard drive(s),
and those files can be organized in folders. Both Leopard and Windows
use the same file/folder concept.
43
Chapter 3: Introducing the Apple of Your iMac
It’s Apple to the rescue!
Unix is the established, super-reliable OS that
powers most of the high-performance servers
that make up the Internet. Unix has built-in sup-
port for virtually every hardware device ever
wrought by the hand of Man (including all the
cool stuff that came with your iMac), and Unix is
well designed and highly efficient.
Unfortunately, standard Unix looks as hideous as
DOS, complete with a confusing command line,
so ease-of-use for normal human beings like you
and me goes out the door. Enter the genius types
at Apple, who understood several years ago that
all Unix needed was a state-of-the-art, novice-
friendly interface! To wit: Mac OS X was devel-
oped with a Unix foundation (or core), so it
shares the same reliability and performance as
Unix. However, the software engineers at Apple
(who know a thing or two about ease-of-use)
made it good-looking and easy to use.
This is the secret to the worldwide fever over
Mac OS X: It blends the best of Unix with the
best of earlier Macintosh operating systems like
Mac OS 9. Mac OS X is not only easy to use, but
it also runs tight, concentric sassy rings around
anything that Microsoft has to offer today.
That’s as far as I delve into the foundation of
Leopard in this volume — understandably,
because there’s lots more iMac to cover! It’s my
job to help you use the features and controls
within Leopard, not turn you into a bearded Unix
nerd with a pocket protector and suspenders.
In fact, you never see the Unix running under-
neath Leopard (unless you want to, by running
the Terminal application). Instead, iMac owners
can stay safely in the elegant world of drag-
and-drop and point-and-click.
If you’re interested in all the details about what
makes Mac OS X tick, as well as its settings and
features, I can heartily recommend another of
my books, the bestselling (and extremely heavy)
Mac OS X Leopard All-in-One Desk Reference
For Dummies (Wiley). It comprehensively
covers everything Leopard — over 700 pages
devoted entirely to Mac OS X and its compan-
ion applications!

 Specific locations: Both Windows and Leopard provide every user with
a set of folders to help keep various types of files organized. For exam-
ple, the My Videos folder that you can use in Windows XP corresponds
to the Movies folder that you find in your Home folder within Leopard.
 Running programs: Both Leopard and Windows run programs (or appli-
cations) in the same manner:
• Double-clicking an application icon launches that application.
• Double-clicking a document runs the corresponding application
and then automatically loads the document.
 Window control: Yep, both operating systems use windows, and those
windows can be resized, hidden (or minimized), and closed in similar
fashions. (Are you starting to see the connections here?)
 Drag-and-drop: One of the basics behind a GUI (a ridiculous acronym
that stands for graphical user interface) like Windows and Leopard is the
ability to drag documents and folders around to move, delete, copy, and
load them. Drag-and-drop is one of the primary advantages of both of
these operating systems because copying a file by dragging it from one
window to another is intuitive and easy enough for a kid to accomplish.
 Editing: Along the same lines as drag-and-drop, both Leopard and
Windows offer similar cut-and-paste editing features. You’ve likely 
used Cut, Copy, and Paste for years, so this is familiar stuff.
Calling for Help
You can call on these resources if you need additional help while you’re dis-
covering how to tame the Leopard.
Some of the help resources are located on the Internet, so your Web browser
will come in handy.
The Leopard built-in Help system
Sometimes the help you need is as close as the Help group on the menu. You
can get help for either
 A specific application: Just click Help. Then, click in the Search box and
type a short phrase that sums up your query (such as startup keys).
You’ll see a list of help topics appear on the menu. Just click a topic to
display more information.
44
Part I: Know Your iMac 

 Actions and functions (topics): Click a Finder window and then click
Help on the menu. Again, you’ll see the Search box, and you can enter 
a word or phrase to find within the Help system. To display the Help
viewer window, click the Mac Help item under the Search box.
The Apple Web-based support center
Apple has online product support areas for every hardware and software
product that it manufactures. Visit www.apple.com and click the Support
tab at the top of the Web page.
The Search box works just like the Mac OS Help system, but the Knowledge
Base that Apple provides online has a lot more answers.
Magazines
Many magazines (both in print and online) offer tips and tricks on using and
maintaining Mac OS X Leopard.
My personal online favorites are Macworld (www.macworld.com) and
MacAddict (www.maclife.com).
Mac support Web sites
A number of private individuals and groups offer support forums on the Web,
and you can often find help from other Mac owners on these sites within a
few hours of posting a question.
I’m very fond of MacFixIt (www.macfixit.com), Mac OS X Hints (http://
forums.macosxhints.com), and MacMinute (www.macminute.com).
Mac newsgroups on Usenet
If you’re familiar with Usenet newsgroups, you can find lots of help (typically
dispensed with a healthy dose of opinion) in newsgroups like comp.sys.
mac.system and comp.sys.mac.applications. Simply post a message
and then check back within a few hours to read the replies.

Chapter 3: Introducing the Apple of Your iMac

Local Mac user groups
I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention your local Mac user group. Often, a user group
maintains its own Web site and discussion forum. If you can wait until the next
meeting, you can even ask your question and receive a reply from a real-live
human being . . . quite a thrill in today’s Web-riffic world!

A
h, the Finder — many admire its scenic beauty, but don’t ignore its
unsurpassed power nor its many moods. And send a postcard while
you’re there.
Okay, so Leopard’s Finder might not be quite as majestic as the mighty
Mississippi River, but it’s the basic toolbox that you use every single day
while piloting your iMac. The Finder includes the most common elements of
Mac OS X: window controls, common menu commands, icon fun (everything
from launching applications to copying files), network connections, keyboard
shortcuts, and even emptying the Trash. In fact, one could say that if you
master the Finder and find how to use it efficiently, you’re on your way to
becoming a power user! (My editor calls this the Finder “window of opportu-
nity.” She’s a hoot.)
That’s what this chapter is designed to do: This is your Finder tour guide,
and we’re ready to roll.
Working within the Finder
This is a hands-on tour, with none of that, “On your right, you’ll see the historic
Go menu” for you! Time to get off the bus and start the tour with Figure 4-1, in
which I show you around the most important elements of the Finder. (In the

upcoming section, “Performing Tricks with Finder Windows,” I give you a
close-up view of window controls.)
The popular attractions include
 The Apple menu (Ú): This is a special menu because it appears both in
the Finder and within every application menu that you run. It doesn’t
matter whether you’re in iTunes or Photoshop or Word: If you can see a
menu bar, the Apple menu is there. The Apple menu contains common
commands to use no matter where you are in Leopard, such as Restart,
Shut Down, and System Preferences.
 The Finder menu bar: Whenever the Finder itself is ready to use (or, in
Mac-speak, whenever the Finder is the active application, rather than
another application), the Finder menu bar appears at the top of your
screen. You know the Finder is active and ready when the word Finder
appears at the left of the menu bar.

Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 

If you’re brand new to computers, a menu is simply a list of commands.
For example, you click the File menu and then choose Save to save a
document. When you click a menu, it extends down so that you can see
the commands it includes. While the menu is extended, you can choose
any enabled menu item (just click it) to perform that action. You can tell
that an item is enabled if its name appears in black. Conversely, a menu
command is disabled if it is grayed out — clicking it does nothing.
When you see a menu path, like this example — File➪Save — it’s just a
visual shortcut that tells you to click the File menu and then choose
Save from the drop-down menu that appears.
 The Desktop: Your Desktop serves the same purpose as your physical
desktop: You can store stuff here (files, alias icons, and so on), and it’s 
a solid, stable surface where you can work comfortably. Application 
windows appear on the Desktop, for example, as do other applications,
such as your Stickies notes and your DVD player. Just click an applica-
tion there to launch it.
Your Desktop is easily customized in many ways. For example, you can
use your own images to decorate the Desktop, organize it to store new
folders and documents, arrange icons how you like, or put the Dock in
another location. Don’t worry — I cover all this in other areas of the
book — I just want you to know that you don’t have to settle for what
Apple gives you as a default Desktop.
 All sorts of icons: This is a Macintosh computer, after all, replete with
tons of make-your-life-easier tools. Check out the plethora of icons on
your Desktop as well as icons within the Finder window itself. Each icon
is a shortcut of sorts to a file, folder, network connection, or device in
your system, including applications that you run and documents that
you create. Refer to Figure 4-1 to see the icon for my iMac’s hard drive
icon, labeled Wolfgang. (I’m a huge Mozart fan.) Sometimes you click an
icon to watch it do its thing (like icons in the Dock, which I cover next),
but usually you double-click an icon to make something happen.
 The Dock: The Dock is a launching pad for your favorite applications,
documents, folders, network connections, and Web sites. You can also
refer to it to see what applications are running. Click an icon there to
open the item. For example, the postage stamp icon represents the
Apple Mail application, and clicking the spiffy compass icon launches
your Safari Web browser.
 The Finder window: Finally! The basic Finder window in Figure 4-1 dis-
plays the contents of my Applications folder. You use Finder windows to
launch applications; perform disk chores, such as copying and moving
files; and navigate your hard drive.
51
Chapter 4: Opening and Closing and Clicking and Such

Mousing in a Mac World
Leopard takes a visual approach to everything, and what you see in Figure 4-1
is designed for point-and-click convenience because the mouse is your pri-
mary navigational tool while you’re using your iMac. You click an item, it
opens, you do your thing, and life is good. If you’ve grazed on the other side
of the fence — one of Those Who Were Once Windows Users — you’re proba-
bly accustomed to using a mouse with at least two buttons. This brings up
the nagging question: “Hey, Mark! Where the heck is the right mouse button?”
In a nutshell, the right mouse button on your iMac’s Mighty Mouse is the
entire right side of the mouse! Although you won’t see any separate buttons
for right or left click, your Mighty Mouse can tell when you’re pushing down
on the left or right side of the mouse. There are also two discrete buttons on
either side of the Mighty Mouse that perform the same action when you click
them — press either one, and you’re performing a third action.
Unlike older Apple ancestors of your Mighty Mouse, you even have a scrolling
ball that allows you to move in any direction within a document window . . .
and the scroll ball acts as a fourth mouse button, too! (So while you’re rolling
the scroll ball to move up and down through the pages of a document or to
move up and down through a long Web page, you can also press down on the
ball to perform another action.)
Clicking the right mouse button performs the same default function in Leopard
that it does in Windows. Namely, when you click the right mouse button on
most items — icons, documents, even your Desktop — you get a contextual
menu of things. That is, you get more commands specific to that item. (Boy,
howdy, I hate that word contextual, but that’s what engineers call it. I call it the
right-click menu, and I promise to refer to it as such for the rest of the book.)
Figure 4-2 illustrates a typical convenient right-click menu within a Finder
window. I have all sorts of cool items at my disposal on this menu because of
the applications I installed that make use of a right-click menu.
To configure everything Mighty Mouse — including all your buttons and your
double-click/tracking/scrolling speeds — visit the Keyboard & Mouse pane
within System Preferences. You can also configure your wireless mouse from
here as well. (More on the System Preferences window in the next section.)
52
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 

Launching and Quitting for 
the Lazy iMac Owner
Now it’s time for you to pair your newly found mouse acumen with Leopard’s
Finder window. Follow along this simple exercise. Move your mouse cursor
over the iTunes icon in the Dock (this icon looks like an audio CD with a
green musical notes on it) and click once. Whoosh! Leopard launches (or
starts) the iTunes application, and you see a window much like the one in
Figure 4-3.
If an application icon is already selected (which I discuss in the next section),
you can simply press Ô+O to launch it. The same key shortcut works with
documents, too.
Figure 4-2:
Well-
adjusted

53
Chapter 4: Opening and Closing and Clicking and Such

Besides the Dock, you have several other ways to launch an application or
open a document in Leopard:
 From the Apple menu (Ú): A number of different applications can
always be launched anywhere within Leopard from the Apple menu:
• System Preferences: This is where you change all sorts of settings,
such as your display background and how icons appear.
• Software Update: This uses the Internet to see whether update
patches are available for your Apple software, as I discuss in
Chapter 20.
• Mac OS X Software: This launches the Safari browser and displays
software that you can download for your iMac.
 From the Desktop: If you have a document that you created or an appli-
cation icon on your Desktop, you can launch or open it here by double-
clicking that icon (clicking the mouse twice in rapid succession when the
mouse cursor is on top of the icon).

Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 

Double-clicking a device or network connection on your Desktop opens
the contents in a Finder window. This works for CDs and DVDs that
you’ve loaded as well as for external hard drives and USB Flash drives.
Just double-click ’em to open them and display their contents in a Finder
window. Applications and documents launch from a CD, a DVD, or an
external drive just like they launch from your internal drive (the one
that’s named Macintosh HD), so you don’t have to copy stuff from the
external drive just to use it. (You can’t change the contents of most CDs
and DVDs; they’re read-only, so you can’t write to them.)
 From the Recent Items selection: When you click the Apple menu and
hover your mouse over the Recent Items menu item, the Finder displays
all the applications and documents that you used over the past few com-
puting sessions. Click an item in this list to launch or open it.
 From the Login Items list: Login Items are applications that Leopard
launches automatically each time you log in to your user account.
I cover Login Items in detail in Chapter 16.
 From the Finder window: You can also double-click an icon within the
confines of a Finder window to open it (for documents), launch it (for
applications), or display the contents (for a folder).
The Quick Look feature that debuted with Leopard can display the contents
of just about any document or file — without actually opening the corre-
sponding application! Sweet. To use Quick Look from a Finder window, click 
a file to select it and then click the Quick Look button (which bears an eye
icon) on the Finder window toolbar.
After you finish using an application, you can quit that application to close its
window and return to the Desktop. Here are a number of different ways to
quit an application:
 Press Ô+Q. This keyboard shortcut quits virtually every Macintosh
application on the planet. Just first make sure that the application that
you want to quit is active!
 Choose the Quit command from the application’s menu. To display the
Quit command, click the application’s name — its menu — from the
menu bar. This menu is always to the immediate right of the Apple (Ú)
menu. For example, Safari displays a Safari menu, and that same spot in
the menu is taken up by iCal when iCal is the active application. In
Figure 4-3, look for the iTunes menu, right next to Ú.
 Choose Quit from the Dock. You can Control-click (or right-click) an
application’s icon on the Dock and then choose Quit from the right-click
menu that appears.
A running application displays a small black triangle under its icons on
the Dock.
55
Chapter 4: Opening and Closing and Clicking and Such

 Click the Close button on the application window; refer to Figure 4-3.
Some applications quit entirely when you close their window, like the
System Preferences window or the Apple DVD Player. Other applications
might continue running without any window, like Safari or iTunes; to
close these applications, you have to use another method in this list.
 Choose Force Quit from the Apple menu. This is a last-resort measure!
Use this only if an application has frozen and you can’t use another
method in this list to quit. Force-quitting an application doesn’t save any
changes to any open documents within that application!
Juggling Folders and Icons
Finder windows aren’t just for launching applications and opening the files
and documents that you create. You can also use the icons within a Finder
window to select one or more specific items or to copy and move items from
place to place within your system.
A field observer’s guide to icons
Not all icons are created equal. Earlier in this chapter, I introduce you to your
iMac’s hard drive icon on the Desktop, but here is a little background on the
other types of icons that you might encounter during your iMac travels:
 Hardware: These are your storage devices (such as your hard drive and
DVD drive) as well as external peripherals (such as your iPod and
printer).
 Applications: These icons represent the applications (or programs) that
you can launch. Most applications have a custom icon that incorporates
the company’s logo or the specific application logo, so they’re very easy
to recognize, as you can see in Figure 4-4. Double-clicking an application
usually doesn’t load a document automatically; you typically get a new
blank document, or an Open dialog box from which you can choose the
existing file you want to open.
 Documents: Many of the files on your hard drive are documents that can
be opened within the corresponding application, and the icon usually
looks similar to the application’s icon. Double-clicking a document auto-
matically launches the required application (that is, as long as Mac OS X
recognizes the file type).
56
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 

 Files: Most of the file icons on your system are mundane things (such as
preference and settings files, text files, log files, and miscellaneous data
files), yet most are identified with at least some type of recognizable icon
that lets you guess what purpose the file serves. You also come across
generic file icons that look like a blank sheet of paper (used when Leopard
has no earthly idea what the file type is).
 Aliases: An alias acts as a link to another item elsewhere on your system.
For example, to launch Adobe Acrobat, you can click an Adobe Acrobat
alias icon that you can create on your Desktop rather than clicking the
actual Acrobat application icon. The alias essentially acts the same way
as the original icon, but it doesn’t take up the same space — only a few
bytes for the icon itself, compared with the size of the actual application.
Plus, you don’t have to go digging through folders galore to find the origi-
nal application icon. (Windows Switchers know an alias as a shortcut, and
the idea is the same although Macs had it first. Harrumph.) You can
always identify an alias by the small curved arrow at the base of the icon,
and the icon might also sport the tag alias at the end of its name.
You have two ways to create an alias. Here’s one:
a. Select the item.
The following section has details about selecting icons.
b. Choose File➪Make Alias, or press Ô+L.
Figure 4-5 illustrates a number of aliases, arranged next to their
linked files.
Figure 4-4:
A collection
of some of
my favorite
application
icons.
57
Chapter 4: Opening and Closing and Clicking and Such

Here’s another way to create an alias:
a. Hold down Ô+Option.
b. Drag the original icon to the location where you want the alias.
Note that this funky method doesn’t add the alias tag to the end
of the alias icon name!
So why bother to use an alias? Two good reasons:
Launch an application or open a document from anywhere on your
drive. For example, you can start Pages directly from the folder where
you store the documents for your current Pages project. Speed, organi-
zation, and convenience . . . life is good.
Send an alias to the Trash without affecting the original item. When
that school project is finished, you can safely delete the entire folder
without worrying about whether Keynote will run the next time you
double-click the application icon!
If you move or rename the original file, Leopard is actually smart enough to
update the alias, too! However, if the original file is deleted (or if the original
is moved to a different volume, such as an external hard drive), the alias no
longer works. (Go figure.)

Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 

Selecting items
Often, the menu commands or keyboard commands that you perform in the
Finder need to be performed on something: Perhaps you’re moving an item 
to the Trash, or getting more information on the item, or creating an alias for
that item. In order to identify the target of your action to the Finder, you need
to select one or more items on your Desktop or in a Finder window. In this
section, I show you just how to do that.
Selecting one thing
Leopard gives you a couple of options when selecting just one item for an
upcoming action:
 Move your mouse pointer over the item and click. A dark border (or
highlight) appears around the icon, indicating that it’s selected.
 If an icon is already highlighted on your Desktop or within a window,
move the selection highlight to another icon in the same location by
using the arrow keys. To shift the selection highlight alphabetically,
press Tab (to move in order) or press Shift+Tab (to move in reverse
order).
Selecting items in the Finder doesn’t actually do anything to them by itself.
You have to perform an action on the selected items to make something
happen.
Selecting a whole bunch of things
You can also select multiple items with aplomb by using one of these methods:
 Adjacent items
• Drag a box around them. If that sounds like ancient Sumerian, here’s
the explanation: Click a spot above and to the left of the first item;
then hold down the mouse button and drag down and to the right.
(This is dragging in Mac-speak.) A box outline like the one in Figure
4-6 appears, indicating what you’re selecting. Any icons that touch
or appear within the box outline are selected when you release the
mouse button.
• Click the first item to select it and then hold down the Shift key while
you click the last item. Leopard selects both items and everything
between them.
 Nonadjacent items: Select these by holding down the Ô key while you
click each item.
59
Chapter 4: Opening and Closing and Clicking and Such

Check out the status line at the bottom of a Finder window. It tells you how
much space is available on the drive you’re working in as well as how many
items are displayed in the current Finder window. When you select items, it
shows you how many you highlighted.
Copying items
Want to copy items from one Finder window to another, or from one location
(like a CD-ROM) to another (like your Desktop)? Très easy. Just use one of
these methods:
 On the same drive
• To copy one item to another location: Hold down the Option key
(you don’t have to select the icon first) and then click and drag 
the item from its current home to the new location.
To put a copy of an item within a folder, just drop the item on top
of the receiving folder. If you hold the item that you’re dragging
over the destination folder for a second or two, Leopard opens up
a new window so you can see the contents of the target.
Figure 4-6:
Drag a box
around
icons to
select them.
60
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 

• To copy multiple items to another location: Select them all first (see
the earlier section, “Selecting a whole bunch of things”), hold down
the Option key and then drag and drop one of the selected items
where you want it. All the items that you selected follow the item
you drag. (Rather like lemmings. Nice touch, don’t you think?)
To help indicate your target when you’re copying files, Leopard high-
lights the location to show you where the items will end up. (This works
whether the target location is a folder or a drive icon.) If the target loca-
tion is a window, Leopard adds a highlight to the window border.
 On a different drive
• To copy one or multiple items: Click and drag the icon (or the
selected items if you have more than one) from the original
window to a window you open on the target drive. (No need to
hold down the Option key whilst moving.) You can also drag one
item (or a selected group of items) and simply drop the items on
top of the drive icon on your Desktop.
The items are copied to the top level, or root, of the target drive.
If you try to move or copy something to a location that already has an item
with the same name, Figure 4-7 illustrates the answer: You get a dialog that
prompts you to decide whether to replace the file or to stop the copy/move
procedure and leave the existing file alone. Good insurance, indeed.
61
Chapter 4: Opening and Closing and Clicking and Such
My, what an attractive Sidebar . . . and so useful!
The Sidebar, which occupies the left side of
every Finder window, is a pane of links to
common locations and devices that you can use
to jump like a flash to a specific spot on your
hard drive. For example, click the Applications
link under the Places heading, and you’re there
in an instant. The Sidebar also contains a
Search For heading that displays the applica-
tions, files, and folders that you accessed today,
yesterday, and during the past week. (Heck, you
can even search for all the images, movies, and
documents on your system from this same
Search For section!)
Here’s a great example of Sidebar magic: I like
as few icons on my Desktop as possible, so
each book I’m working on gets its own folder. All
the items for that project that might otherwise
end up on my Desktop are saved into that folder
instead. In fact, I make a point of adding my cur-
rent book project folder to my Finder window
Sidebar so that it’s available immediately from
any Finder window. To do this, just drag the
folder into the column at the left side of the
Finder window and drop it under the Places
heading in the Sidebar’s list.

Moving things from place to place
Moving things from one location to another location on the same drive is the
easiest action you can take. Just drag the item (or selected items) to the new
location. The item disappears from the original spot and reappears in the
new spot.
Duplicating in a jiffy
If you need more than one copy of the same item within a folder, use the
Leopard Duplicate command. I use Duplicate often when I want to edit a 
document but ensure that the original document stays pristine, no matter
what. I just create a duplicate and edit that file instead.
To use Duplicate, you can
 Click an item to select it and then choose File➪Duplicate.
 Right-click the item and choose Duplicate from the menu.
 Hold down the Option key and drag the original item to another spot
in the same window. When you release the mouse button, the duplicate
file appears like magic!
Figure 4-7:
Replace 
the existing
file only if
you’re sure.
62
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 

The duplicate item has the word copy appended to its name. A second copy
is named copy2, a third is copy3, and so on.
Duplicating a folder also duplicates all the contents of that folder, so creating
a duplicate folder can take some time to create if the original folder was stuffed
full. The duplicate folder has copy appended to its name, but the contents of
the duplicate folder keep their original names.
Keys and Keyboard Shortcuts 
to Fame and Fortune
Your iMac keyboard might not be as glamorous as your mouse, but any
Macintosh power user will tell you that using keyboard shortcuts is usually
the fastest method of performing certain tasks in the Finder, such as saving
or closing a file. I recommend committing these shortcuts to memory and
putting them to work as soon as you begin using your iMac so that they
become second nature to you as quickly as possible.
Special keys on the keyboard
The Apple standard keyboard has a number of special keys that you might not
recognize — especially if you’ve made the smart move and decided to migrate
from the chaos that is Windows to Mac OS X! Table 4-1 lists the keys that bear
strange hieroglyphics on the Apple keyboard as well as what they do.

Using Finder and application 
keyboard shortcuts
The Finder is chock-full of keyboard shortcuts that you can use to take care
of common tasks. Some of the handiest shortcuts are in Table 4-2.
But wait, there’s more! Most of your applications also provide their own set
of keyboard shortcuts. While you’re working with a new application, display
the application’s Help file and print out a copy of the keyboard shortcuts as 
a handy cheat sheet.

Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 

If you’ve used a PC before, you’re certainly familiar with three-key shortcuts —
the most infamous being Ctrl+Alt+Delete, the beloved shut-down shortcut
nicknamed the Windows Three-Finger Salute. Three-key shortcuts work the
same way in Leopard (but you’ll be thrilled to know you won’t need to reboot
by using that notorious Windows shortcut)! If you’re new to computing, just
hold down the first two keys simultaneously and then press the third key.
You’re not limited to just the keyboard shortcuts listed above, either. Within
System Preferences, visit the Keyboard & Mouse pane and then click the
Keyboard Shortcuts button to change an existing shortcut or add another.
Performing Tricks with Finder Windows
In this section of your introduction to Mac OS X, I describe basic windows
management within Leopard: how to move things around, how to close win-
dows, and how to make ’em disappear and reappear like magic.
Scrolling in and resizing windows
Can you imagine what life would be like if you couldn’t see more than a single
window’s worth of stuff? Shopping would be curtailed quite a bit — and so
would the contents of the folders on your hard drives!
That’s why Leopard adds scroll bars that you can click and drag to move
through the contents of the window. You can either
 Click the scroll bar and drag it.
 Click anywhere in the empty area above or below the bar to scroll pages
one at a time.
 Hold down the Option key and click anywhere in the empty area above
or below the bar to scroll to that spot in the window.
Of course, you can also use the scroll wheel on your Mighty Mouse to scroll
the contents of a window (both vertically and horizontally). To control the
scroll wheel’s behavior, open System Preferences, click the Keyboard &
Mouse pane, and then click the Mouse button.
Figure 4-8 illustrates both vertical and horizontal scroll bars in a typical
Finder window.
65
Chapter 4: Opening and Closing and Clicking and Such

Often, pressing your Page Up and Page Down keys moves you through a doc-
ument one page at a time. Also, pressing your arrow keys moves your inser-
tion cursor one line or one character in the four compass directions.
You can also resize most Finder and application windows by enlarging or
reducing the window frame itself. Move your mouse pointer over the Resize
handle in the lower-right corner of the window (which smartly bears a number
of slashed lines to help it stand out) and then drag the handle in any direction
until the window is the precise size you need.
Minimizing and restoring windows
Resizing a window is indeed helpful, but maybe you simply want to banish
the doggone thing until you need it again. That’s a situation for the Minimize
button, which also appears in Figure 4-8. A minimized window disappears

from the Desktop but isn’t closed: It simply reappears in the Dock as a minia-
ture icon. Minimizing a window is easy: Move your mouse pointer over the
Minimize button at the top-left corner of the window — a minus sign appears
in the button to tell you that you’re on target — and then click.
Hold down the Shift key whilst you minimize, and prepare to be amazed when
the window shrinks in slow motion like Alice in Wonderland!
To restore the window to its full size again (and its original position on the
Desktop), just click its window icon on the Dock.
Moving and zooming windows
Perhaps you want to move a window to another location on the Desktop so
you can see the contents of multiple windows at the same time. Click the
window’s title bar (that’s the top frame of the window, which usually includes
a document or application name) and drag the window anywhere you like.
Then release the mouse button. (Don’t click the icon in the center of the title
bar, though. You won’t move the window, just the icon itself.)
Many applications can automatically arrange multiple windows for you.
Choose Window➪Arrange All menu item (if it appears).
To see all that a window can show you, use the Zoom feature to expand any
Finder or application window to its maximum practical size. Note that a
zoomed window can fill the entire screen, or (if that extra space isn’t applica-
ble for the application) the window might expand only to a larger part of the
Desktop. To zoom a window, move your mouse pointer over the button (as
shown in the earlier Figure 4-8) at the top-left corner of the window. When the
plus sign appears in the Zoom button, click to claim the additional territory
on your Desktop. (You can click the Zoom button again to automatically
return the same window to its original dimensions.)
67
Chapter 4: Opening and Closing and Clicking and Such
Only one can be active at onceTM
Yes, here’s a very special Mark’s Maxim in the
Mac OS X universe.
Only one application window can be
active in Leopard at any time.TM
You can always tell which window is active:
 The active window is on top of other 
windows.
Tip: You can still use a window’s Close,
Minimize, and Zoom buttons when it’s 
inactive.
 Any input you make by typing or by moving
your mouse appears in the active window.
 Mac OS X dims inactive windows that you
haven’t minimized.

Closing windows
When you’re finished with an application or no longer need a window open,
move your mouse pointer over the Close button at the top-left corner of the
window. When the X appears in the button, click it. (And yes, I can get one
more reference out of Figure 4-8, which I’m thinking of nominating as Figure 
of the Year.)
If you have more than one window open in the same application and you want
to close ’em all in one swoop, hold down the Option key whilst you click the
Close button on any of the windows.
If you haven’t saved a document and you try to close that application’s
window, Leopard gets downright surly and prompts you for confirmation.
“Hey, human, you don’t really want to do this, do you?” If you answer in the
affirmative — “Why, yes, machine. Yes, indeed, I do want to throw this away
and not save it.” — the application discards the document that you were
working on. If you decide to keep your document (thereby saving your poste-
rior from harm), you can either save the document under the same filename
or under a new name.
68
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 
Toggling toolbars the Leopard way
Time to define a window control that’s actually
inside the window for a change. A toolbar is a
strip of icons that appears under the window’s
title bar. These icons typically perform the most
common actions within an application; the effect
is the same as if you use a menu or press a key-
board shortcut. Toolbars are very popular these
days. You see ’em within everything from the
Finder window to most application windows.
You can banish a window’s toolbar to make
extra room for icons, documents, or whatever it
happens to be holding. Just click the little
lozenge-shaped button at the right corner of the
window. (You guessed it — the Toolbar button
is also shown in Figure 4-8.) Note: If you toggle
the Finder toolbar off, you also lose the Finder
window Sidebar.

hen you’re no longer a novice to Leopard and the basics of the Finder,
turn your attention to a number of more advanced topics ’n tricks to
turn you into an iMac power user — which, after all, is the goal of every civi-
lized consciousness on Planet Earth.
Consider this chapter a grab bag of Leopard knowledge. Sure, I jump around
a little, but these topics are indeed connected by a common thread: They’re
all surefire problem-solvers and speeder-uppers. (I can’t believe the latter is
really a word, but evidently it is. My editors told me so.)
Home, Sweet Home Folder
Each user account that you create within Leopard is actually a self-contained
universe. For example, each user has a number of unique characteristics and
folders devoted just to that person, and Leopard keeps track of everything
that user changes or creates. (In Chapter 16, I describe the innate loveliness
of multiple users living in peace and harmony on your iMac.)
This unique universe includes a different system of folders for each user
account on your system. The top-level folder uses the short name that
Leopard assigns when that user account is created. Naturally, the actual
folder name is different for each person, so Mac techno-types typically refer
to this folder as your Home folder.

Each account’s Home folder contains a set of subfolders, including
 Movies
 Music
 Pictures
 Downloads (for files you download via Safari)
 Sites (for Web pages created by the user)
 Documents (created by the user)
Although you can store your stuff at the root (top level) of your hard drive,
that gaggle of files, folders, and aliases can get very crowded and confusing
very quickly. Here’s a Mark’s Maxim to live by:
Your Home folder is where you hang out and where you store your stuff. Use
it to make your computing life much easier!TM
Create subfolders within your Documents folder to organize your files and
folders even further. For example, I always create a subfolder in my
Documents folder for every book that I write so that I can quickly and 
easily locate all the documents and files associated with that book project.
I discuss security within your Home folder and what gets stored where in
Chapter 16. For now, Figure 5-1 shows how convenient your Home folder is 
to reach because it appears in the Finder window Sidebar. One click of your
Home folder, and all your stuff is in easy reach.
In addition to the Finder window Sidebar, you can also reach your Home
folder in other convenient ways:
 From the Go menu: Choose Go➪Home to display your Home folder
immediately from the Finder window. Alternatively, you can press
Ô+Shift+H to accomplish the same thing.
 From within Open and Save dialogs: Leopard’s standard File Open and
File Save dialogs also include the same Home folder (and subfolder)
icons as the Finder window Sidebar.
 Within any new Finder window you open: If you like, you can set every
Finder window that you open to open automatically within your Home
folder.
a. Choose Finder➪Preferences to display the dialog that you see in
Figure 5-2.
b. Click the arrow button at the right side of the New Finder Windows
Open pop-up menu.
A menu pops up (hence, the name).

c. Click the Home entry in the menu.
d. Click the Close button at the top-left corner of the dialog.
You’re set to go. From now on, every Finder window you open 
displays your Home folder as the starting location!
Here’s another reason to use your Home folder to store your stuff: Leopard
expects your stuff to be there when you migrate your files from an older Mac
to a new Mac.
Arranging Your Desktop
Most folks put all their documents, pictures, and videos on their Leopard
Desktop because the file icons are easy to locate! Your computing stuff is
right in front of you . . . or is it?
Call me a finicky, stubborn fussbudget — go ahead, I don’t mind — but I
prefer a clean Leopard Desktop without all the iconic clutter. In fact, my
Desktop usually has just three or four icons even though I use my iMac sev-
eral hours every day. It’s an organizational thing; I work with literally hun-
dreds of applications, documents, and assorted knickknacks daily. Sooner or
later, you’ll find that you’re using that many, too. When you keep your stuff
crammed on your Desktop, you end up having to scan your screen for one
particular file, an alias, or a particular type of icon, which ends up taking you
more time to locate it on your Desktop than in your Documents folder!
Plus, you’ll likely find yourself looking at old icons that no longer mean any-
thing to you or stuff that’s covered in cobwebs that you haven’t used in
years. Stale icons . . . yuck.
I recommend that you arrange your Desktop so you see only a couple of
icons for the files or documents that you use the most. Leave the rest of the
Desktop for that cool image of your favorite actor or actress.
Besides keeping things clean, I can recommend a number of other favorite
tweaks that you can make to your Desktop:
 Keep Desktop icons arranged as you like.
a. From the Finder menu, choose View➪Show View Options.
b. Select the Arrange By check box.
c. From the pop-up menu, choose the criteria that Leopard uses to auto-
matically arrange your Desktop icons, including the item name, the
last modification date, or the size of the items.
I personally like things organized by name.
72

 Choose a favorite background.

Putting the Dock to the Test
If the Dock seems like a nifty contraption to you, you’re right again — it’s like
one of those big control rooms that NASA uses. From the Dock — that icon
toolbar at the bottom of Leopard’s Desktop — you can launch an application,
monitor what’s running, and even use the pop-up menu commands to control
the applications that you launch. (Hey, that NASA analogy is even better than
I thought!)
By default, the Dock hangs out at the bottom of your screen, but you can move
it to another edge, change the size of the icons, or even hide it until it’s neces-
sary. (You can find more details on customizing your Dock in Chapter 6.)
When you launch an application — either by clicking an icon on the Dock or
by double-clicking an icon in a Finder window or the Desktop — the icon
begins to bounce hilariously on the Dock to indicate that the application is
loading. (So much for my Mission Control analogy.) After an application 
is running, the application icon appears on the Dock with a shiny blue dot
underneath. Thusly, you can easily see what’s running at any time just by
glancing at the Dock.
You can hide most applications by pressing Ô+H. Although the application
itself is still running, it might not appear on the Dock.
Some applications run in the background — that is, they don’t show up on the
Dock. You generally don’t even know that these applications are working for
you. However, if you need to see in detail what’s going on, you can always use
the Activity Monitor utility to view everything that’s happening on your iMac.
(For example, an Apple support technician might ask you to run Activity
Monitor to help troubleshoot a problem.) To run the Activity Monitor
1. Open a Finder window.
2. Click the Applications folder in the Sidebar.
3. Double-click the Utilities folder to open it.
4. Double-click the Activity Monitor icon.
Adding Dock icons
Ah, but there’s more: The Dock can offer more than just a set of default icons!
You can add your own MIS (or Most Important Stuff) to the Dock, making it the
most convenient method of taking care of business without cluttering up
your Desktop. You can add
74
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 

 Applications: Add any application to your Dock by dragging the applica-
tion icon into the area to the left of the separator line (the vertical dotted
line on the Dock which appears between applications and folders or
documents). The existing Dock icons move aside so that you can place
the new neighbor in a choice location.
Do not try to add an application anywhere to the right of the separator
line. You can’t put applications there — and Leopard might even think
that you want the application dumped in the Trash!
 Folders: Here’s where you want to add things to the area to the right of
the separator line. A folder or volume icon that you drag to the Dock is
called a Stack in Leopard, and you can display the contents with a single
click. (The contents of the folder “fan out” into a half-circle or grid
arrangement, depending on the number of items in the folder.) To open
or launch an item, just click it in the Stack display.
Leopard already includes two Stacks in the Dock by default: your
Documents folder and your Downloads folder.
 Web URLs: Sure, you can add your favorite Web site from Safari! Drag it
right from the Safari Address bar into the area to the right of the separator
line. When you click the URL icon, Safari opens the page automatically.
Removing Dock icons
You can remove an icon from the Dock at any time (as long as the application
isn’t running). In fact, I always recommend that every Leopard user remove
the default icons that never get used to make more room available for your
favorite icons. The only two icons you can’t remove are the Finder and the
Trash icons. To remove an icon from the Dock, just click and drag it off 
the Dock. You’re rewarded with a ridiculous puff of smoke straight out of 
a Warner Brothers cartoon! (One of the Mac OS X developers was in a fun
mood, I guess.)
When you delete an icon from the Dock, all you delete is the Dock icon: The
original application, folder, or volume is not deleted.
Using Dock icon menus
From the Dock menu, you can open documents, open the location in a Finder
window, set an application as a Login Item, control the features in some appli-
cations, and other assorted fun, depending on the item.
75
Chapter 5: A Plethora of Powerful Fun

To display the right-click Dock menu for an icon
1. Move your mouse over the icon.
2. Right-click.
Note that you can also press the Control key and click the icon, or even
hold down the left mouse button for a second or two.
I cover the Dock settings that you can change within System Preferences in
Chapter 6. You can also change the same settings from the Apple menu if you
hover your mouse over the Dock item, which displays a submenu with the
settings.
What’s with the Trash?
Another sign of an iMac power user is a well-maintained Trash bin. It’s a
breeze to empty the discarded items you no longer need, and you can even
rescue something that you suddenly discover you still need!
The Leopard Trash bin resides on the Dock, and it works just like the Trash
has always worked in Mac OS X: Simply drag selected items to the Trash to
delete them.
Note one very important exception: If you drag an external device or remov-
able media drive icon on your Desktop to the Trash (such as an iPod, iPhone,
DVD, or an external hard drive), the Trash bin icon automagically turns into a
giant Eject icon, and the removable device or media is ejected or shut down —
not erased. Repeat, not erased. (That’s why the Trash icon changes to the Eject
icon — to remind you that you’re not doing anything destructive.)
Here are other methods of chunking items you select to go to the wastebasket:
 Choose File➪Move to Trash.
 Click the Action button on the Finder toolbar and choose Move to Trash
from the list that appears.
 Press Ô+Delete.
 Right-click the item and choose Move to Trash from the right-click menu.
You can always tell when the Trash contains at least one item because the
basket icon is full of crumpled paper! However, you don’t have to unfold a wad
of paper to see what the Trash holds: Just click the Trash icon on the Dock to
display the contents of the Trash. To rescue something from the Trash, drag
the item(s) from the Trash folder to the Desktop or to any other folder in a
Finder window. (If you’re doing this for someone else who’s not familiar with
Leopard, remember to act like it was a lot of work, and you’ll earn big-time
DRP, or Data Rescue Points.)
76
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 

When you’re sure that you want to permanently delete the contents of the
Trash, use one of these methods to empty the Trash:
 Choose Finder➪Empty Trash.
 Choose Finder➪Secure Empty Trash.
If security is an issue around your iMac and you want to make sure that
no one can recover the files you’ve sent to the Trash, using the Secure
Empty Trash command takes a little time but helps to ensure that no
third-party hard drive repair or recovery program could resuscitate the
items you discard.
 Press Ô+Shift+Delete.
 Right-click the Trash icon on the Dock and then choose Empty Trash
from the right-click menu.
Working Magic with Dashboard, 
Exposé, and Spaces
iMac power users tend to wax enthusiastic over the convenience features
built into Leopard. In fact, we show ’em off to our PC-saddled friends and
family. Three of the features that I’ve demonstrated the most to others are
Leopard’s Dashboard display, the brand-new Spaces Desktop manager, and
the amazing convenience of Exposé. In this section, I show ’em off to you as
well. (Then you can become the Leopard evangelist on your block.)
Using Dashboard
The idea behind Dashboard is deceptively simple yet about as revolutionary
as it gets for a mainstream personal computer operating system. Dashboard
is an alternate Desktop that you can display at any time by using the key-
board or your mouse; the Dashboard desktop holds widgets (small applica-
tions that each provide a single function). Examples of default widgets that
come with Leopard include a calculator, a world clock, weather display, and 
a dictionary/thesaurus.
Oh, did I mention that you’re not limited to the widgets that come with
Leopard? Simply click the plus button at the bottom of the Dashboard display
and drag new widgets to your Dashboard from the menu at the bottom of the
screen. To remove a widget while you’re in this mode, click the X icon that
appears next to each widget. When you’re done with your widgets — 
that sounds a bit strange, but I mean no offense — press the Dashboard key
again to return to your Desktop.
77
Chapter 5: A Plethora of Powerful Fun

Widgets can also be rearranged any way you like by dragging them to a new
location.
Simple applications like these are no big whoop — after all, Mac OS X has
always had a calculator and a clock. What’s revolutionary is how you access
your widgets. You can display and use them anywhere in Leopard, at any
time, by simply pressing the Dashboard key. The default key is F12 although
you can change the Dashboard key via the Exposé & Spaces pane within
System Preferences (or even turn it into a key sequence, like Option+F12).
You can also click the Dashboard icon on the Dock to summon your
Dashboard widgets and then banish the Dashboard when you’re done.
78
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 
Previewing images and documents the Leopard way
Leopard’s new Quick Look feature (available on
the Finder window toolbar) has garnered a lot
of attention within the technology press, and
rightly so. Just select a file and click the Quick
Look button (or just press the space bar), and
Leopard instantly displays the contents of the
document or image, without opening the appli-
cation. Heck, I’ve been waiting for such a magic
lamp for two decades now!
However, don’t forget that Mac OS X has always
offered a Swiss Army knife application for view-
ing image files and documents: namely, Preview.
You can use Preview to display digital photos in
several popular image formats, including TIFF,
GIF, PICT, PNG, JPEG, and Windows Bitmap.
I know, if that were the sum total of Preview’s
features, it wouldn’t deserve coverage here. So,
what else can it do? Here’s a partial list (just my
favorites, mind you):
 Use Preview to add a bookmark at the cur-
rent page within a PDF document by choos-
ing Bookmarks➪Add Bookmark.
 Fill out a form in a PDF document by choos-
ing Tools➪Text Tool.
Click an area that’s marked as an input field,
and you can type text into that field. After you
complete the form, you can fax or print it.
 Take a screen snapshot (saving the con-
tents of your screen as a digital photo) by
choosing File➪Grab➪Timed Screen.
Preview launches the Grab utility, which
displays an onscreen timer and then snaps
the image for you after ten seconds. (This
gives you time to get things just right before
saying, “Cheese!”)
 Convert an image into another format or
into a PDF file by choosing File➪Save As.
If a PDF document can be edited, you can
delete or insert pages at will.
 Resize or rotate an image by using the com-
mands on the Tools menu.
Leopard automatically loads Preview when you
double-click an image in a format that it recog-
nizes or when you double-click a PDF file. It also
acts as the Print Preview window, as you can
read elsewhere in this chapter. However, if you
want to launch Preview manually, open a Finder
window, click the Applications folder in the
Sidebar, and then double-click the Preview icon.

Click the scroll ball on your Mighty Mouse to display your Dashboard.
A WebClip widget can include text, graphics, and links, which Dashboard
updates every time you display your widgets. Think about that for a second:
Dynamic displays, such as weather maps, cartoons, and even the Free Music
Download image from the iTunes Store are all good sources of WebClip wid-
gets! (That last one is a real timesaver.)
Leopard even allows you to create your own Dashboard widgets! That’s right,
this new feature is sure to be a winner amongst the In Crowd. Follow these
steps to create a new WebClip Dashboard widget from your favorite Web site:
1. Run Safari and navigate to the site you want to view as a widget.
2. Click the Open This Page in Dashboard button on the Safari Toolbar,
which bears a pair of scissors and a dotted box.
3. Select the portion of the page you want to include in your widget.
Most Web pages use frames to organize and separate sections of a page,
so this step allows you to choose the frame with the desired content.
4. Drag the handles at the edges of the selection border to resize your
widget frame to the right size and then click Add.
Bam! Leopard displays your new WebClip widget within Dashboard.
When you click a link in a WebClip widget, Dashboard loads the full Web page
in Safari, so you can even use WebClips for surfing chores with sites you visit
often.
Switching between apps with Exposé
In Chapter 4, you can read about using the Ô+Tab keyboard shortcut switches
between your open applications. If you’ve moved to the iMac from a PC run-
ning Windows, you might think this simple shortcut is all there is to it. Ah,
dear reader, you’re in Leopard territory now!
Exposé is a rather racy-sounding feature, but (like Dashboard) it’s really all
about convenience. If you typically run a large number of applications at the
same time, Exposé can be a real timesaver, allowing you to quickly switch
between a forest of different application windows (or display your Desktop
instantly without those very same windows in the way). The feature works in
three ways:
 Press the All Windows key (or key sequence) to display all your applica-
tion windows on a single screen, as shown in the truly cool Figure 5-4.
(By default, F9 is the All Windows key.)
Then just click the window that you want to make active.
79
Chapter 5: A Plethora of Powerful Fun

 Press the Application Windows key (or key sequence) to display all
the windows that have been opened by the active application. (By
default, F10 is the Application Windows key.)
This comes in handy with those mega-applications, such as Photoshop
Elements or FileMaker Pro, in which you often have three or four win-
dows open at one time. Again, you can click the window that you want
to make active.
 Press the Desktop key (or key sequence) to move all your application
and Finder windows to the sides of your Desktop so you can access
your Desktop icons. (The default Desktop key is F11.)
After you’re done with your Desktop and you want to restore your win-
dows to their original locations, press the Desktop key (F11) again to put
things back.
Switching between desktops with Spaces
Ah, but what if you want to switch to an entirely different set of applications?
For example, suppose that you’re slaving away at your pixel-pushing job,
designing a magazine cover with Pages. Your page design desktop also includes
Photoshop and Aperture, which you switch between often using one of the
Figure 5-4:
With
Exposé, 
you can

every open
application’s
window(s).
80
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 

techniques I just described. Suddenly, however, you realize you need to sched-
ule a meeting with others in your office using iCal, and you also want to
check your e-mail in Apple Mail. What to do?
Well, you could certainly launch those two applications on top of your graph-
ics applications, and then minimize or close them. With Leopard’s new Spaces
feature, though, you can press the Control+←or Control+→sequences to
switch to a completely different “communications” desktop, with iCal and
Apple Mail windows already open and in your favorite positions! Figure 5-5
illustrates the Spaces screen, showing two available desktops.
After you’re done setting up your meeting and answering any important
e-mail, simply press Control+←or Control+→again to switch back to your
“graphics” desktop, where all your work is exactly as you left it!
Now imagine that you’ve also created a custom “music” desktop for Garage-
Band and iTunes . . . or perhaps you joined iWeb, Safari, and iPhoto as a
“Webmaster” desktop. See why everyone’s so excited? (Let’s see Windows
Vista do that out of the box.)
Unlike Exposé, Spaces has to be enabled and configured before you can use
it. You can create new desktops, customize your desktops, and even choose 
a different set of key sequences to activate Spaces from within System
Preferences. For the complete story on configuring Spaces, see Chapter 6.

81
Chapter 5: A Plethora of Powerful Fun

You can activate Exposé, Spaces, and Dashboard by using your mouse instead
of the keyboard:
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock.
2. Click the Exposé & Spaces icon to display the settings.
3. Click the desired Screen Corner pop-up menu to choose what function
that screen corner will trigger.
4. Press Ô+Q to save your changes and then exit System Preferences.
When you move your mouse pointer to that corner, the feature you’ve
specified automatically kicks in.
Printing within Mac OS X
Leopard makes document printing a breeze. Because virtually all Mac print-
ers use a Universal Serial Bus (USB) port, setting up printing couldn’t be
easier. Just turn on your printer and connect the USB cable between the
printer and your iMac; Leopard does the rest.
Printer manufacturers supply you with installation software that might add
cool extra software or fonts to your system. Even if Leopard recognizes your
USB printer immediately, I recommend that you still launch the manufacturer’s
Mac OS X installation disc. For example, my new Epson printer came with
new fonts and a CD/DVD label application, but I wouldn’t have ’em if I hadn’t
installed the Epson software package.
After your printer is connected and installed, you can use the same procedure
to print from within just about every Mac OS X application on the planet! To
print with the default page layout settings — standard 8 1⁄2-x-11" paper, portrait
mode, no scaling — follow these steps:
1. Within the active application, choose File➪Print or press the Ô+P
shortcut.
Mac OS X displays the Print sheet, as shown in Figure 5-6.
2. From this dialog, you can
• Print from a different printer connected to your iMac or print over a
network connection to a shared printer on another computer.
Click the Printer pop-up menu. In this pop-up menu, Leopard dis-
plays all the printers that you can access.
82
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 

• Check what the printed document will look like.
Click Preview to open it within the very same Preview application I
discuss earlier in this chapter.
If you have to make changes to the document or you need to change the
default print settings, click Cancel to return to your document. (You have
to repeat Step 1 again to display the Print dialog again.)
If everything looks good at this point and you don’t need to change any set-
tings (like multiple copies or to print only a portion of the document), click
Print — you’re done! If not, click the Expand button next to the Printer pop-
up menu. (It bears a downward-pointing arrow.) Now you can proceed with
these steps:
1. (Optional) For more than one copy, click in the Copies field and type
the number of copies that you need.
Collation (separating copies) is also available, and it doesn’t cost a thing!
2. (Optional) To print a range of selected pages, select the From radio
button and then enter the starting and ending pages.
To print the entire document, leave the default Pages option set to All.

Chapter 5: A Plethora of Powerful Fun

3. (Optional) If the application offers its own print settings, such as col-
lating and grayscale printing, make any necessary changes to those
settings.
To display these application-specific settings, click the pop-up menu in
the Print dialog and choose the desired settings pane that you need to
adjust. (You can blissfully ignore these settings and skip this step
entirely if the defaults are fine.)
4. When you’re set to go, click Print.
You can also save an electronic version of a document in the popular Adobe
Acrobat PDF format from the Print dialog — without spending money on
Adobe Acrobat. (Slick.)
1. Click the PDF button to display the destination pop-up menu.
2. Click Save as PDF.
Leopard prompts you with a Save As dialog, where you can type a name
for the PDF document and specify a location on your hard drive where
the file should be saved.
Heck, if you like, you can even fax a PDF (with an external USB modem) or
send it as an e-mail attachment! Just choose these options from the destina-
tion list rather than Save as PDF.

emember the old TV series Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea? You always
knew you were on the bridge of the submarine Seaview because it had
an entire wall made up of randomly blinking lights, crewmen darting about
with clipboards, and all sorts of strange and exotic-looking controls on every
available surface. You could fix just about anything by looking into the camera
with grim determination and barking out an order. After all, you were On The
Bridge. That’s why virtually all the dialog and action inside the sub took
place on that one (expensive) set: It was the nerve center of the ship, and a
truly happenin’ place to be.
In the same vein, I devote this entire chapter to the System Preferences
window and all the settings within it. After all, if you want to change how
Leopard works or customize the features within our favorite operating
system, this one window is the nerve center of Mac OS X, and a truly hap-
penin’ place to be. (Sorry, no built-in wall of randomly blinking lights — but
there are exotic controls just about everywhere.)
A Not-So-Confusing Introduction
The System Preferences window (as shown in Figure 6-1) is a self-contained
beast, and you can reach it in a number of ways:
 Click the Apple menu (Ú) and choose the System Preferences menu item.
 Click the System Preferences icon in the Dock.

 Click the Apple menu (Ú), choose Dock, and then choose the Dock
Preferences menu item.
 Click the Time and Date display in the Finder menu and then choose the
Open Date and Time menu item.
 Control-click (or right-click) any uninhabited area of your Desktop and
then choose Change Desktop Background.
 Click most of the Finder menu status icons and then choose the Open
Preferences menu item. (This includes the Bluetooth, AirPort, Display,
Modem, and Clock icons.)
When the System Preferences window is open, you can click any of the group
icons to switch to that group’s pane; the entire window morphs to display the
settings for the selected pane. For example, Figure 6-2 illustrates the Sound
pane, which allows you to set a system alert sound, configure your iMac’s
built-in microphone, and choose from several different output options.
Many panes also include a number of tabbed buttons at the top — in this
case, Sound Effects, Output, and Input. You can click these tabs to switch to
another panel within the same pane. Many panes within System Preferences
have multiple panels. This design allows our friends at Apple to group a large
number of related settings together in the same pane (without things getting
too confusing).
To return to the top-level System Preferences panel from any pane, just click
the Show All button (top left) or press Ô+L. You can also click the familiar
Previous and Next buttons to move backward through the panes you’ve
already visited and then move forward again, in sequence. (Yep, these but-
tons work just like the browser controls in Safari. Sometimes life is funny 
that way.)
You won’t find an OK button that you have to click to apply any System
Preference changes — Apple’s developers do things the right way. Your
changes to the settings in a pane are automatically saved when you click
Show All or when you click the Close button on the System Preferences
window. You can also press Ô+Q to exit the window and save all your
changes automatically . . . a favorite shortcut of mine.
If you see an Apply button in a pane, you can click it to immediately apply
any changes you made, without exiting the pane. This is perfect for some 
settings that you might want to try first before you accept them, like many 
of the controls on the Network pane. However, if you’re sure about what you
changed and how those changes will affect your system, you don’t have to
click Apply. Just exit the System Preferences window or click Show All as you
normally would.

and slider controls — from one place? Even when you’re not quite sure
exactly what it is you’re looking for?

Figure 6-3 illustrates exactly that kind of activity taking place. Just click in the
System Preferences Spotlight Search box (upper right, with the magnifying
glass icon) and type in just about anything. For example, if you know part of
the name of a particular setting you need to change, type that. Leopard high-
lights the System Preferences panes that might contain matching settings.
And if you’re a Switcher from the Windows world, you can even type in what
you might have called the same setting in Windows XP or Vista!
The System Preferences window dims, and the group icons that might con-
tain what you’re looking for stay highlighted. Slick.
You can also search for System Preferences controls by using the Spotlight
menu and Spotlight window. Find more on this cool feature in Chapter 7.
If you need to reset the Search box to try again, click the X icon that appears
at the right side of the box to clear it.
Popular Preference Panes Explained
Time to get down to brass tacks. Open up the most-often-used panes in System
Preferences to see what magic you can perform! I won’t discuss every pane
because I cover many of them in other chapters. (In fact, you might never need
to open some System Preferences panes at all, like the .Mac pane.) However,
this chapter covers just about all the settings that you’re likely to use on a reg-
ular basis.

The Displays pane
If you’re a heavy-duty game player or you work with applications like video
editing and 3-D modeling, you probably find yourself switching the character-
istics of your monitor on a regular basis. To easily accomplish switching, visit
the Displays pane (see Figure 6-4), which includes two panels:
 Display: Click a screen resolution to choose it from the Resolutions list
on the left. Leopard displays the number of colors (or color depth)
allowed at that resolution, and you can pick a color depth from the
Colors pop-up menu. (Typically, it’s a good idea to use the highest reso-
lution and the highest number of colors.) If you have an external moni-
tor connected to your iMac, click the Detect Displays button to scan for
that monitor. Because iMacs running Leopard have a flat-panel LCD, the
refresh rate is disabled. However, if you’re using a CRT display, I recom-
mend choosing the highest refresh rate allowed. Drag the Brightness
slider to change the brightness level of your display.
When you enable (mark) the Show Displays in Menu Bar check box, you
can switch resolutions and color levels right from the Finder menu!
 Color: Your iMac can use a color profile file that controls the colors on
your display. This setting comes in handy for graphic artists and illustra-
tors who need color output from their printers that closely matches the
colors displayed by the iMac. Click the Calibrate button to launch the
Display Calibrator, which can create a custom ColorSync profile and 
calibrate the colors that you see on your monitor.

The Desktop & Screen Saver pane
Hey, no offense to the awesome Aurora background (new with Leopard), but
who doesn’t want to choose their own background? And what about that
nifty screen saver you just downloaded from the Apple Web site? You can
change both your background and your screen saver by using these options
on the Desktop & Screen Saver pane.
The settings on the Desktop panel (as shown in Figure 6-5) include
 Current Desktop picture: To change your Desktop background, click 
a thumbnail. You can also drag a picture from a Finder window or the
desktop and drop it into the well (the fancy Apple word for the square
box with the sunken look). Leopard automatically updates your Desktop
so you can see the results. To open another collection of images from
Apple, click the desired collection folder in the list on the left of the
panel. (I recommend the stunning images in the Nature folder.) If you
want to open a different folder with your own images, click the Add
button (which bears a plus sign) at the lower left of the panel and then
navigate to that folder.
 Arrangement: You can automatically fit an image to your screen, tile
your background image (repeat it across the Desktop), center it, and
stretch it to fill the screen. Because the images from Apple are all sized
correctly already, the Arrangement control appears only when you’re
using your own pictures.

select the Change Picture check box. You can click the drop-down list

 Screen Savers: Click the screen saver that you want to display from 
the Screen Savers list. Leopard displays an animated preview of the
selected saver on the right. You can also click the Test button to try 
out the screen saver in full-screen mode. (Move your mouse a bit to 
end the test.)
If the selected screen saver has any settings you can change, the
Options button displays them.
 Start Screen Saver: Drag this slider to choose the period of inactivity
that triggers the screen saver. Choose Never to disable the screen saver
entirely.
 Use Random Screen Saver: Another chance to rebel against conformity!
Enable this check box, and Leopard picks a different screen saver each
time.
 Show With Clock: Enable this check box, and Leopard adds a smart
clock display to your screen saver. (A great help for those of us who
spend many minutes on the phone.)
 Hot Corners: Click this button to display a drop-down sheet, and then
click any of the four pop-up menus at the four corners of the screen to
select that corner as an activating hot corner. (Moving your mouse
pointer there immediately activates the screen saver.) You can also spec-
ify a corner as a disabling hot corner — as long as the mouse pointer
stays in that corner, the screen saver is disabled. Note that you can also
set the Dashboard, Spaces, and Exposé activation corners from here.
(Read on for the entire lowdown.)
For additional security, check out the Security pane in System
Preferences, where you’ll find the Require Password to Wake This
Computer from Sleep or Screen Saver check box. Enable the check box,
and Leopard will require your user account password before allowing
anyone to turn off the screen saver.

Chapter 6: A Nerd’s Guide to System Preferences

The Exposé & Spaces pane
The pane you see in Figure 6-6 illustrates the settings that control Leopard’s
Spaces, Dashboard, and Exposé features (features I discuss in more detail in
Chapter 5). The settings on the Exposé tab include
 Active Screen Corners: The screen corners pop-up menus that I describe
in the preceding section operate just like those in the Screen Savers panel.
Click a corner’s list box to set it as
• An Exposé All Windows corner (displays all windows on your
Desktop).
• An Exposé Application Windows corner (displays only the windows
from the active application).
• An Exposé Desktop corner (moves all windows to the outside of
the screen to uncover your Desktop).
• A Spaces corner (activates the Spaces Desktop selection feature).
• A Sleep Display corner (immediately turns off your display, putting
your screen in Sleep mode).
• A Dashboard corner (displays your Dashboard widgets). Widgets
are small applications that each perform a single task; they appear
when you invoke the awesome power of Dashboard.
These pop-up menus can also set the Screen Saver activate and disable
hot corners.
 Keyboard and mouse shortcuts: Pretty straightforward stuff here. Click
each pop-up menu to set the key sequences (and mouse button settings)
for all three Exposé functions as well as Dashboard.
If you hold down a modifier key (Shift, Control, Option, or Ô) while a
shortcut pop-up menu is open, Leopard adds that modifier key to the
selections you can choose! (Perfect for those folks who already have the
F11 key in use by another application. Make your Desktop shortcut key
the Shift+F11 key sequence instead.)
One of Leopard’s hottest new features is Spaces, which is the system you use
to configure and control multiple “prefabricated” desktops that you can switch
between at will! The settings on the Spaces tab include
 Enable Spaces: Enable this check box to use Spaces. (Go figure.)
 Show Spaces in Menu Bar: When this check box is enabled, Leopard dis-
plays the Spaces desktop number you’re currently using in the Finder
menu bar. You can click the number in the menu bar to switch to another
Spaces desktop or to open the Spaces Preferences pane.
92
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 

 Rows buttons: To add a row of Spaces desktops to the Spaces grid, click
the Add button with the plus sign. (By default, Spaces starts with two
desktops enabled, so new rows and columns are numbered beginning
with three.) To delete a row, click the Delete button (which bears a
minus sign).
 Columns buttons: To add a column of Spaces desktops to the Spaces
grid, click the Add (plus) button. Click the Delete (minus) button to
remove a column from the grid.
If you choose to remove a column or row, Leopard alerts you that the
bindings (the specific applications linked to the deleted columns or
rows) will be reassigned.
 Add/Remove Application: Click the Add Application button (the button
with the plus sign under the Application Assignments list) to add an
application to one of your Spaces desktops. You can select which desk-
top should include an application by clicking the up/down arrows next
to the Space column for that application’s entry — just click the desired
desktop from the pop-up menu that appears. To remove an application,
click it in the Application Bindings list to select it and then click the
Remove Application button (which sports a minus sign).
Spaces can even add an application to all your desktops — choose
Every Space from the pop-up menu.

Chapter 6: A Nerd’s Guide to System Preferences

 Keyboard and mouse shortcuts: Click each pop-up menu to set the key
sequences (and mouse button settings) for all three Spaces functions.
Like with Dashboard and Exposé keyboard and mouse shortcuts, you
can press Shift, Control, Option, and Ô keys while the box is open to 
display modified choices.
The Appearance pane
The talented Appearance pane (as shown in Figure 6-7) determines the look
and operation of the controls that appear in application windows and Finder
windows. It looks complex, but I cover each option here.
The settings include
 Appearance: Click this pop-up menu to specify the color Leopard uses
for buttons, menus, and windows.
 Highlight Color: Click this pop-up menu to choose the color that high-
lights selected text in fields, pop-up menus, and drop-down list boxes.
 Place Scroll Arrows: Select a radio button here to determine whether the
arrows that control the scroll bar in a window appear together at 
the bottom of the scroll bar, or separately at the top and bottom of the
scroll bar.
Figure 6-7:
Appearances
might not be

Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 

 Click in the Scroll Bar To: By default, Leopard scrolls to the next or pre-
vious page when you click in an empty portion of the scroll bar. Select
the Jump to Here radio button to scroll the document to the approxi-
mate position in relation to where you clicked. (Smooth scrolling slows
down scrolling, which some people prefer.)
You can minimize a Finder or application window by simply double-
clicking the window’s title bar. To enable this feature, mark the Minimize
When Double Clicking a Window Title Bar check box.
 Number of Recent Items: By default, Leopard displays ten recent appli-
cations, documents, and servers within Recent Items in the Apple menu.
Need more? Just click the corresponding pop-up menu and specify up to
50 items.
 Font Smoothing Style: This feature performs a little visual magic that
makes the text on your monitor or flat panel look more like the text on a
printed page. Most iMac owners should choose Automatic or Medium
(for a typical flat-panel LCD display).
 Turn Off Text Smoothing for Font Sizes: Below a certain point size, text
smoothing doesn’t help fonts look any smoother onscreen. By default,
any font displayed at 8 point or smaller isn’t smoothed, which is a good
choice for an iMac with a flat-panel LCD screen.
The Energy Saver pane
I’m an environmentalist — it’s surprising how many techno-types are colored
green — so these two panels are pretty doggone important. When you use
them correctly, you not only save electricity but also even invoke the Power
of Leopard to automatically start and shut down your iMac whenever you like!
The panels (as shown in Figure 6-8) include
 Sleep: To save electricity, drag the Put the Computer to Sleep When It Is
Inactive For slider to a delay period that triggers sleep mode when you’re
away from the keyboard for a significant period of time. (I prefer 30 min-
utes.) If your iMac must always remain alert and you want to disable sleep
mode entirely, choose Never. You can set the delay period for blanking
your monitor separately from the sleep setting with the Put the Display to
Sleep When the Computer Is Inactive For slider. To conserve the maximum
juice and cut down on wear, enable the Put the Hard Disk(s) to Sleep
When Possible check box to power-down your hard drives when they’re
not needed. (This might cause a delay of a second or two while loading or
saving files because the drives must spin back up.)
95
Chapter 6: A Nerd’s Guide to System Preferences

You can set Leopard to start or shut down your iMac at a scheduled
time. Click the Schedule button and then select the desired schedule
(the Start Up or Wake check box and the Shut Down/Sleep pop-up menu)
to enable them. Set the trigger time by clicking the up and down arrows
next to the time display for each schedule. Click OK to return to the
Energy Saver pane.
 Options: From this panel, you can specify events that can awake your
iMac from sleep mode, like a ring signal from your modem. If you prefer
to send your iMac to sleep by pressing the Power button, enable the
Allow Power Button to Sleep the Computer check box. By default, your
iMac’s display will dim to indicate that sleep mode is approaching, but
you can disable the Automatically Reduce the Brightness of the Display
check box to maintain full brightness until sleep mode actually kicks in.
Leopard can also restart your iMac automatically after a power failure —
a good feature for those running Apache Web server, because your Web
site will automatically come back online after power is restored.
The Dock pane
I’ll come clean: I think the Dock is the best thing since sliced bread! (I wonder
what people referred to before sliced bread was invented?) You can use the
settings, as shown in Figure 6-9, to configure the Dock’s behavior until it fits
your personality like a glove:
 Size: Pretty self-explanatory. Just drag the slider to change the scale of
the Dock.
 Magnification: When you select this check box, each icon in your Dock
swells like a puffer fish when you move your mouse cursor over it. (Just
how much it magnifies is determined by the Magnification slider.) I really
like this feature because I resize my Dock smaller, and I have a large
number of Dock icons.
Figure 6-8:

96
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 

 Position on Screen: Select a radio button here to position the Dock on
the left, bottom, or right edge of your iMac’s Desktop.
 Minimize Using: Leopard includes two cool animations that you can
choose from when shrinking a window to the Dock (and expanding it
back to the Desktop). Click the Minimize Using pop-up menu to specify
the genie-in-a-bottle effect or a scale-up-or-down-incrementally effect.
If animation isn’t your bag or you want to speed up the graphics perfor-
mance of an older G4 or G5 iMac, you can turn off these minimizing
effects.
 Animate Opening Applications: Are you into aerobics? How about punk
rock and slam dancing? Active souls who like animation likely get a kick
out of the bouncing application icons in the Dock. They indicate that
you’ve launched an application and that it’s loading. You can turn off
this bouncing behavior by disabling this check box.
 Automatically Hide and Show the Dock: Select this check box, and 
the Dock disappears until you need it. (Depending on the size of your
Dock, the Desktop that you gain can be significant.) To display a 
hidden Dock, move your mouse pointer over the corresponding edge 
of the Desktop.
The Sharing pane
So you’re in a neighborly mood, and you want to share your toys with others
on your local wired or wireless network. Perhaps you’d like to start your own
Web site, or protect yourself against the Bad Guys on the Internet. All these
fun diversions are available from the Sharing pane in System Preferences, as
shown in Figure 6-10.
Click the Edit button to change the default network name assigned to your
iMac during the installation process. Your current network name is listed in
the Computer Name text field.
Figure 6-9:
Customize
your Dock
by using
these
controls.
97
Chapter 6: A Nerd’s Guide to System Preferences

Each entry in the services list controls a specific type of sharing, including
Screen Sharing, File Sharing (with other Macs and PCs running Windows),
Printer Sharing, Web Sharing, Remote Login, Remote Management (using
Apple Remote Desktop), Remote Apple Events, Xgrid Sharing, Internet
Sharing and Bluetooth Sharing. To turn on any of these services, enable the
On check box for that service. To turn off a service, click the corresponding On
check box to disable it.
From a security standpoint, I highly recommend that you enable only those
services that you actually use — each service you enable automatically
opens your Leopard firewall for that service. (Chapter 17 discusses your fire-
wall in more detail.) A Mark’s Maxim to remember:
Poking too many holes in your firewall is not A Good Thing.TM
When you click one of the services in the list, the right side of the Sharing
pane changes to display the settings you can specify for that particular ser-
vice. To display all the details on these options, click the Help button at the
lower-right corner of the System Preferences dialog.
The Time Machine pane
Mac users are excited about the new Time Machine automatic backup feature
that debuts with Leopard, and you can easily configure how Time Machine
handles your backups from this pane (as shown in Figure 6-11). Chapter 20
covers how to use Time Machine — of course, you’ll need an external hard
drive (or a Time Capsule wireless backup station) for the best backup secu-
rity. Note that Time Machine won’t work with your CD or DVD rewriteable
drive . . . it’s got to be a hard drive.
Figure 6-10:
Share your

others by

pane.
98
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 

It is actually possible to use a second partition on your existing internal hard
drive to hold your Time Machine data, but what happens if your internal hard
drive is hit with a hardware failure? You’d lose both your original data and
your backup in one fell swoop! For this reason, I strongly recommend that
you add an external hard drive to your iMac for use with Time Machine. 
(I don’t know why Apple even made this an option . . . sigh.)
To enable Time Machine, click the Back Up This Computer check box to enable
it and then click the Choose button to select a disk (or partition) that holds
your Time Machine backup data. You have the option of encrypting your
backup for extra security, but remember that this slows down the backup
and restore process slightly.
You can specify the amount of time that your backup data remains on the
target drive with the Keep Backups pop-up menu, which appears at the
bottom of the pane after you’ve turned on Time Machine and selected a
target drive or partition. Note that the Indefinitely option provides an ongo-
ing backup, allowing you to restore your files and folders from any point after
you enable Time Machine.
Time Machine can automatically begin a backup session whenever necessary
(working in the background), or you can choose to back up at scheduled
times. Click the Back Up pop-up menu to set a schedule.
Your Mac must be turned on to allow a scheduled backup to run!
If you’re running low on hard drive space to store your backup data (or you
want to minimize the amount of time required for a backup), click the Do Not
Backup System Files check box to enable it. Time Machine will back up only
those items that you created or edited yourself — for example, your docu-
ments, digital media, and applications you installed.
Figure 6-11:
Put Time
Machine to
work, and
your data 
is always

99
Chapter 6: A Nerd’s Guide to System Preferences

By default, Time Machine backs up all the hard drives on your system; how-
ever, you might not need to back up some hard drives or folders on your iMac.
To save time and hard drive space, Time Machine allows you to exclude spe-
cific drives and folders from the backup process. Click the Options button;
then click the Add button (with the plus sign) to select the drives or folders
you want to exclude, and they appear in the Do Not Back Up list.
To remove an exclusion, select it in the list and click the Delete button (with
the minus sign); note the Total Included figure increases, and Time Machine
adds the item you deleted from the list to the next backup.
After you make your changes, you can elect to back up your Mac immediately
by clicking the Back Up Now button.

 Understanding how Spotlight works
 Searching for data, files, and folders via Spotlight

 Searching with the Find dialog and the Search box
 Searching for stuff on the Internet with Dashboard widgets
W
hat would you say if I told you that you could search your entire
system for every single piece of data connected with a person — and
in only the short time it takes to type that person’s name? And I’m not just
talking about files and folders that might include that person’s name. I mean
every e-mail message and every iCal calendar or event that references that
person — and even that person’s Address Book card to boot? Heck, how
about if that search could dig up every occurrence of the person’s name
inside your electronic PDF documents?
You’d probably say, “That makes for good future tech — I’ll bet I can do that
in five or ten years. It’ll take Apple at least that long to do it . . . and just in
time for me to buy a new iMac! (Harrumph.)”
Don’t be so hasty: You can do all this, right now. The technology is the Mac
OS X feature named Spotlight, built right into Leopard. In this chapter, I show
you how to use it like an iMac power guru. I also show you how to take
advantage of Internet search widgets you can display within Dashboard.
(From what I hear, there’s good stuff on the Internet, too.)
Spotlight Explained
Invoking the magic of Spotlight is a snap. As you can see in Figure 7-1, the
Spotlight search field always hangs out on the right side of the Finder menu
bar. You can either click once on the magnifying glass icon or just press
Ô+spacebar. Either way, Leopard displays the Spotlight search box.

Spotlight works by indexing — in other words, searching for and keeping track
of keywords within your files. (In case you’ve never heard the term before, a
keyword is a word in the title or innards of a document that describes the 
contents, like leopard, music, or soda. That last one turns up a lot in my 
documents.)
In fact, Leopard indexes the contents of your iMac hard drives into one huge
file, which it constantly maintains while you create new files and modify exist-
ing files. Leopard can search this index file in a fraction of a second after you
enter your search criteria. Your index file contains all sorts of data, including
quite a bit of information from inside various documents: hence, Spotlight’s
ability to present matching data inside your files and application records.
When you first boot Leopard, it spends anywhere from a few minutes to an
hour or two creating the initial Spotlight index file. A blue dot appears in the
middle of the magnifying glass icon while indexing is underway. Creating this
full index happens only once, so it’s no great burden to bear.
You can search for any string of text characters in Spotlight, and you’ll be
surprised at everything this plucky feature will search. For example, Spotlight
searches through your Address Book contacts, Mail messages, iCal calendars,
iChat transcripts, temporary Web page cache, and even System Preferences!
Yep, you can even use it to find specific settings in all those System
Figure 7-1:

a very good
friend of
yours — the

search box.
102
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 

Preferences panes, such as printer sharing or Dashboard. Of course, Spotlight
includes matching files and folders — like that other operating system — but
it does it in the blink of an eye.
Spotlight matches all the items that include all your search text: Therefore, if
you enter just the word horse, you’re likely to get far more matches than if you
enter a word string, such as horse show ticket.
If you add metadata to your documents — such as a Comment field in a Word
document (which you can display in the Get Info dialog box) or keywords
embedded in a Photoshop image — Spotlight matches that information as
well. Other recognized file formats include iWork documents, Excel spread-
sheets, Keynote presentations, and third-party applications that offer a
Spotlight plug-in.
Spotlight works so seamlessly — and so doggone fast — because it’s literally
built into the core of Leopard (unlike that other operating system that begins
with a W, which uses a separate program to search and can take a couple of
minutes to return just matching filenames). Spotlight’s integration into the
heart of Leopard allows those high-IQ Apple developers (and even smart
folks outside the company) to easily use it elsewhere within Leopard — more
on this later in the chapter.
Searching with Spotlight
To begin a Spotlight topic search, display the Spotlight box and start typing.
As soon as your finger presses the first key, you see matching items start to
appear. Check out Figure 7-2, in which I only typed a single character (L). (No
need to press Return to start the process, by the way.) When you type more
characters, Spotlight’s results are updated in real time to reflect those more-
restrictive qualifiers. (Of course, if I had typed three characters, like Leo,
my results would be far more specific: everything from Leopard to Leonard
Bernstein, for example.)
Spotlight displays what it considers the top 20 matching items within the
Spotlight menu itself. These most relevant hits are arranged into categories,
such as Documents, Images, and Folders. You can change the order in which
categories appear (via the Spotlight pane within System Preferences, which I
cover a bit later in this chapter).
With its internal magic, Spotlight presents the category Top Hit (with what it
considers the single, most-relevant match) at the top of the search results, as
also shown in Figure 7-2. You’ll find that the Top Hit is often just what you’re
looking for. To open or launch the Top Hit item from the keyboard, click the
entry or press the down-arrow key (↓) to select Top Hit; then press Return.
103
Chapter 7: Searching amidst iMac Chaos

Didn’t find what you were after? Click the X icon that appears at the right side
of the Spotlight box to reset the search box and then start over.
If all you know about the item you’re searching for is what type of file it is —
for example, you know it’s a QuickTime movie, but you know nothing about
the title — just prefix the keyword with the text kind: in front of the file type —
for example, kind:movies — in the Searchlight field. This trick also works with
image files (kind:images), contacts (kind:contacts), applications (kind:appli-
cations), and audio files (kind:music), too.
Here’s another trick that’s built into Spotlight: You can type in a date a file
was created or received — such as modified:=>01/01/08 — to match all items
modified on or after January 1 of 2008. Heck, you can even combine criteria —
such as kind:music created:07/18/07 (note the space between the criteria) —
and Spotlight matches every audio file that was created on that date. One-hun-
dred-percent sassy!
To allow even greater flexibility in your searches, Apple has added those
helpful Boolean friends that you may already be familiar with: AND, OR, and
NOT. For example, in Leopard, you can perform Spotlight searches, such as
 Horse AND cow: Collects all references to both those barnyard animals
into one search
Figure 7-2:

104
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 

 Batman OR Robin: Returns all references to either Batman or Robin, but
not both
 Apple NOT PC: Displays all references to Apple that don’t include any
information on dastardly PCs
Working with Spotlight matches
After you run a fruitful search, and Spotlight finds the proverbial needle in
your system’s haystack, what’s next?
Just click the item — that’s all it takes. Depending on the type of item, Leopard
does one of four things:
 Launches an application
 Opens a specific pane in System Preferences (if the match is the name of
a setting or contained in the text on a Preferences pane)
 Opens a document or data item, such as an Address Book card
 Displays a folder within a Finder window
To see all sorts of useful info about each Spotlight menu item (filtering), click
the Show All item (above the Top Hit listing; refer to Figure 7-2) to expand
your Spotlight menu into the Results window, as shown in Figure 7-3. From
the keyboard, you can press the Results window shortcut key, which you 
can set from System Preferences (more on this in a page or two).
105
Chapter 7: Searching amidst iMac Chaos
Is Spotlight secure?
So how about all those files, folders, contacts,
and events that you don’t want to appear in
Spotlight? Say you’re sharing your Mac as a
multiuser computer, or accessing other Macs
remotely. Can other folks search for and access
your personal information through Spotlight?
Definitely not! The results displayed by
Spotlight are controlled by file and folder per-
missions as well as your account login, just like
the applications that create and display your
personal data. For example, you can’t access
other users’ calendars by using iCal, and they
can’t see your Mail messages. Only you have
access to your data, and only after you log in
with your username and password. Spotlight
works the same way. If a user doesn’t normally
have access to an item, it simply doesn’t appear
when that user performs a Spotlight search. (In
other words, only you get to see your stuff.)
However, you can even hide certain folders and
disks from your own Spotlight searches if nec-
essary. Perhaps you’d prefer keeping your tax
and financial records away from Spotlight’s all-
searching eye? Check out the last section of this
chapter for details on setting private locations
on your system.

To further filter the search, click one of the buttons on the Spotlight Results
window toolbar or create your own custom filter. Click the button with the
plus sign to display the search criteria bar and then click the pop-up menus
to choose from criteria, such as the type of file, text content, or the location
on your system (such as your hard drive, your Home folder, or a network
server). You can also filter your results listing by the date when the items
were created or last saved. To add or delete criteria, click the plus and minus
buttons at the right side of the search criteria bar. To save a custom filter
that you created, click Save.
After you locate the item you want, click it to open, launch, or display it, just
like you would in the Spotlight menu.
Heck, Spotlight can even look for matching items on other Macs on your 
network — but only if those remote Macs are configured correctly. To allow
another Mac to be visible to Spotlight on your system, enable File Sharing 
on the other Mac within the Sharing pane in System Preferences. (Oh, and
remember that you need an admin-level account on that Mac to enable file
sharing — or access to a good friend who has an admin-level account on 
that Mac.)
Fine-tuning Spotlight in 
System Preferences
The System Preferences window boasts a Spotlight pane, which you can use
to customize what search matches you see and how they are presented. To
adjust these settings, click the System Preferences icon on the Dock (look for
the Three Gears of Justice) and then click the Spotlight icon (under Personal).

Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 

Configuring the Search Results settings
Figure 7-4 illustrates the Search Results tab of the Spotlight Preferences pane.
From here, you can
 Pick your categories. To disable a category (typically because you don’t
use those types of files), select the check box next to the unnecessary
category to clear it.
 Specify the order that categories appear within Spotlight. Drag the cat-
egories into the order that you want them to appear in the Spotlight
menu and Results window.
 Select new Spotlight menu and Spotlight Results window keyboard
shortcuts. In fact, you can enable or disable either keyboard shortcut, 
as you like. Click the pop-up menu to choose a key combination.
Marking stuff off-limits
Click the Privacy tab (as shown in Figure 7-5) to add disks and folders that
should never be listed as results in a Spotlight search. The disks and folders
that you add to this list won’t appear even if they actually match your search
string. This safeguard can come in handy for organizations (such as hospi-
tals) that are required by law to protect their patient or client data. However,
you can select a removable hard drive here, which is often stored in a safe
after business hours.

Chapter 7: Searching amidst iMac Chaos

To add a private location, click the Add button (which bears a plus sign) and
navigate to the desired location. Then click the location to select it and click
Choose. (If you already have the location open in a Finder window, you also
can drag folders or disks directly from the window and drop them into the list.)
Searching the Old-Fashioned Way
The Finder window toolbar has featured a Search box for a few years now
(and Leopard includes a Find dialog), but even the older Search features
within Leopard have been updated to take advantage of Spotlight technology.
Now you can even use file types (such as image or movie) and relative time
periods (such as yesterday and last week) in the Finder window Search box
and Find displays!
Typically, I use the Finder window Search box if I need to do a simple file or
folder name search: It works the same as using the Spotlight search field. Just
begin typing. To reset the field and start anew, click the X button in the Search
box. To choose a specific location for your search — say, your Home folder or
a hard drive volume — click the desired button along the top of the Search
results display. The Finder window automatically turns into a Results display.
Leopard also includes the oldest Search method in the book: the Find display.
(It used to be a dialog all by itself, but Find controls are now displayed in the
Finder window, so it’s more of an extension to the Finder window.) Choose
File➪Find or press Ô+F to display the Find controls. From here, you can click
pop-up menus to choose a specific filename or portion of a filename. Other
Figure 7-5:

108

modifiers include the file type, content, the label color you assign to a file, file
size, and the most recent date when the file was opened. Again, click the loca-
tion buttons at the top of the window to choose where to search.
The Find display, however, is a little more sophisticated than the toolbar
Search box. You can click the plus (+) button next to a search criterion field
in the Find display to add another field, allowing for matches based on more
than one condition. Click the minus (–) button next to a search criterion field
to remove it.
After you find a match, both older Search methods work the same: Click the
item once to display its location, or double-click it to launch or open it. Files
can also be moved or copied, respectively, from the Results and Find displays
with the standard drag or Option+drag methods. You can return to the more
mundane Finder window display by clicking the Back button on the toolbar.
These older Search methods can also do one thing that Spotlight doesn’t
offer: You can use them to create a new Smart Folder (a folder with contents
that Leopard automatically updates according to the criteria you set). Click
the Save button in either the Finder window Search Results or Find display.
You’re prompted to specify the name and location for the new Smart Folder
and whether it should appear in the Finder window Sidebar. After you create
the folder, Leopard automatically updates the contents of the Smart Folder
with whatever items match the criteria you saved. You never have to search
by using the same text or criteria again because the search is saved as part 
of the Smart Folder! (Each icon in a Smart Folder is a link to the actual file or
folder, so nothing gets moved, and no extra space is wasted with multiple
copies of the same items.) You can work with the files and folders inside a
Smart Folder as if they were the actual items themselves.
With Widgets, the Internet 
is Your Resource
No chapter on searching within Mac OS X would be complete without the
Internet resources available through your Leopard Dashboard. (I describe
widgets in illuminating detail in Chapter 5.) Figure 7-6 illustrates many of
these widgets:
 Dictionary: This multipurpose widget can display the Oxford American
dictionary or thesaurus entry for the word you enter.
 Weather: Check out the six-day forecast for a specific ZIP code or
city/state combination at a glance.
To enter the location data, click the tiny i button that appears when you
mouse over the right corner of the widget. This trick works with just
about every widget, allowing you to set any options it offers.

Chapter 7: Searching amidst iMac Chaos

 Flight Tracker: Keep tabs on the arrival and destination time for the
flight you specify.
 Google: Yep, it’s a shortcut to the King of all Internet search engines.
Just type in the words you want to search for and then press Return.
The widget automatically launches Safari with the results!
 Business: Put your local Yellow Pages to work by typing in a business
name or category. This widget displays matching telephone numbers
and addresses. Click an entry to get directions or a map from the Web.
Okay, I know you’re going to roll your eyes, but I have to remind you that you
need an Internet connection to use these widgets. Otherwise, Business and
Flight Tracker are about as useful as a pair of swim fins in the Sahara Desert.
Naturally, you’ll find countless other Internet-enabled widgets on the Apple
Web site, in the Download area. For all the details on adding built-in widgets
to your Dashboard, visit Chapter 5.

L
ooking for that massive Microsoft monster of a Web browser on your
iMac? You know, the one that practically everyone uses in the Windows
world. What’s it called? I forget the name.
You see, I use an iMac, and I proudly surf the Web via a lean, mean — and
very fast — browser application. That’s Safari, of course, and it just keeps get-
ting better with each new version of Mac OS X. Safari delivers the Web the
right way, without the wait.
If you need a guide to Safari, this is your chapter. Sure, you can start using it
immediately, but wouldn’t you rather read a few pages in order to surf like a
power user?
It Doesn’t Even Look Like 
That Other Web Browser
Figure 8-1 illustrates the Safari window. You can launch Safari directly from
the Dock, or you can click the Safari icon (which looks like a compass dial)
within your Applications folder.

Major sections of the Safari window include
 The Toolbar: You find the most-often-used commands on this toolbar for
everyday tasks, such as navigation, adding bookmarks, and searching
Google. Plus, here, you can type or paste the address for Web sites that
you’d like to visit. You can hide the Toolbar to open up more real estate
in your browser window for Web content. To toggle hidden mode, press
Ô+| (the vertical bar right above the backslash) or choose
View➪Hide/Show Toolbar.
 The Bookmarks bar: Consider this a toolbar that allows you to jump
directly to your favorite Web sites with a single click. I show you later, 
in the section “Adding and Using Bookmarks,” how to add and remove
sites from your Bookmarks bar. For now, remember that you can toggle
the display of the Bookmarks bar by choosing View➪Hide/Show
Bookmarks Bar, or by pressing Ô+Shift+B.
 The Content window: Congratulations! At last, you waded through all
the pregame show and reached the area where Web pages are actually
displayed. Like any other window, the Content window can be scrolled;
when you minimize Safari to the Dock, you get a thumbnail (minimized)
image of the Content window.

Part III: Connecting and Communicating 

The Content window often contains underlined text and graphical icons
that transport you to other pages when you click them. These under-
lined words and icons are links, and they make it easy for you to move
from one area of a site to another or to a completely different site.
 The status bar: The status bar displays information about what the mouse
pointer is currently resting upon, like the address for a link or the name of
an image; it also updates you on what’s happening while a page is loading.
To hide or display the status bar, press Ô+/ (forward slash).
Visiting Web Sites
Sure, you’re likely saying, “Mark, I already know this stuff. I can operate a Web
browser blindfolded — while listening to The Best of Air Supply, even.” I agree
wholeheartedly, but I get paid by the word, and some folks might just not be
aware of all the myriad ways of visiting a site. You can load a Web page from
any of the following methods:
 Type (or paste) a Web site address into the Toolbar and then press
Return.
If you’re typing in an address and Safari recognizes the site as one that
you already visited, it helps by completing the address for you. If this is
a new site, just keep typing.
 Click a Bookmarks entry within Safari.
 Click the Home button, which takes you to the home page that you
specify.
More on this in the section, “Setting Up Your Home Page,” later in this
chapter.
 Click a page link in Apple Mail or another Internet-savvy application.
 Click a page link within another Web page.
 Use the Google box in the Toolbar.
Click in the Google box, type the contents that you want to find, and
then press Return. Safari presents you with the search results page on
Google for the text that you entered. (In case you’ve been living under
the Internet equivalent of a rock for the last couple of years, Google.com
is the preeminent search site on the Web. People use Google to find
everything from used auto parts to ex-spouses.)
 Click a Safari page icon on the Dock or in a Finder window.
For example, Mac OS X sports an icon in the default Dock that takes you
to the Mac OS X page on the Apple Web site. Drag a site from your
115
Chapter 8: Let’s Go on Safari!

Bookmarks bar and drop it on the right side of the Dock. Clicking the
icon that you add launches Safari and automatically loads that site.
This trick works only on the side of the Dock to the right of the vertical
line.
If you minimize Safari to the Dock, you see a thumbnail of the page with the
Safari logo. Click this thumbnail in the Dock to restore the page to its full glory.
Basic Navigation While on Safari
A typical Web surfing session is a linear experience — you bop from one page
to the next, absorbing the information that you want and discarding the rest.
However, after you visit a few sites, you might find that you need to return to
where you’ve been or head to the familiar ground of your home page. Safari
offers these navigational controls on the Toolbar:
 Back: Click the Back button (the left-facing arrow) on the toolbar to
return to the last page that you visited. Additional clicks take you to pre-
vious pages, in reverse order. The Back button is disabled if you haven’t
visited at least two sites.
 Forward: If you’ve clicked the Back button at least once, clicking the
Forward button (the right-facing arrow) takes you to the next page (or
through the pages) where you were, in forward order. The Forward
button is disabled if you haven’t used the Back button.
 Home: Click this button (look for the little house) to return to your
home page.
Not all these buttons and controls might appear on your Toolbar. To dis-
play or hide Toolbar controls, choose View➪Customize Toolbar. The
sheet that appears works just like the Customize Toolbar sheet within a
Finder window: Drag the control you want from the sheet to your Toolbar,
or drag a control that you don’t want from the Toolbar to the sheet.
 AutoFill: If you fill out a lot of forms online — when you’re shopping at
Web sites, for example — you can click the AutoFill button (which looks
like a little text box and a pen) to complete these forms for you. You can
set what information is used for AutoFill by choosing Safari➪Preferences
and the clicking the AutoFill toolbar button.
To be honest, I’m not a big fan of releasing any personal information to
any Web site, so I don’t use AutoFill often. If you do decide to use this
feature, make sure that the connection is secure (look for the padlock
icon in the upper-right corner of the Safari window) and read the site’s
Privacy Agreement page first to see how your identity data will be treated.
116
Part III: Connecting and Communicating 

 Text Size: Use this to shrink or expand the text on the page, offering
smaller, space-saving characters (for the shrinking crowd) or larger,
easier-to-read text (for the expanding crowd). Hence the button, which
is labeled with a small and large letter A.
 Stop/Reload: Click Reload (which has a circular arrow) to refresh
(reload) the contents of the current page. Although most pages remain
static, some pages change their content at regular intervals or after you
fill out a form or click a button. By clicking Reload (look for the curvy
arrow), you can see what’s changed on these pages. (I use Reload every
hour or so with CNN.com, for example.) While a page is loading, the
Reload button turns into the Stop button — with a little X mark — and
you can click it to stop the loading of the content from the current page.
This is a real boon when a download takes foorrevverr, which can
happen when you’re trying to visit a very popular or very slow Web site
(especially if you’re using a dialup modem connection to the Internet).
Using Stop is also handy if a page has a number of very large graphics
that are going to take a long time to load.
 Open in Dashboard: Click this button to create a Dashboard widget
using the contents of the currently displayed Web page. Safari prompts
you to choose which clickable section of the page to be included within
the widget’s borders (like the local radar map on your favorite weather
Web site). Click Add, and Dashboard loads automatically with your new
widget. (More on widgets in Chapter 5.)
 Add Bookmark: Click this Toolbar button (which carries a plus sign) to
add a page to your Bookmarks bar or Bookmarks menu. (More on this in
a tad.)
 Google Search: As I mention earlier, you can click in this box, type text
that you want to find on the Web via the Google search engine, and then
press Return to display the results. To repeat a recent search, click the
down arrow in the Google Search box and select it from the pop-up
menu.
 Print: Click this convenient button to print the contents of the Safari
window. Dig that crazy printer icon!
 Report Bug: A rather strange creature, the Safari Bug button makes it
easy to alert Apple when you encounter a page that doesn’t display
properly in Safari. (Software developers call such glitches bugs: hence,
the name.) When you click the Bug button, you see a sheet with the set-
tings shown in Figure 8-2; there, you can enter a short description of the
problem that you’re having. (I also enable the Send Screen Shot of
Current Page and the Send Source of Current Page check boxes to give
the Apple folks more to work with while they’re debugging Safari.) Then
click the Submit button to send the bug report to Apple.

Setting Up Your Home Page
Choosing a home page — the page that initially appears when you launch
Safari — is one of the easiest methods of speeding up your Web surfing, espe-
cially if you’re using a dialup modem connection. However, a large percentage
of the Mac owners with whom I’ve talked have never set their own home
page, simply using the default home page provided by their browser! With
Safari running, take a moment to follow these steps to declare your own free-
dom to choose your own home page:
1. Display the Web page you want as your new home page, in Safari.
I recommend electing a page with few graphics or a fast-loading 
popular site.
2. Choose Safari➪Preferences or press Ô+, (comma).
3. Click the General button.
You see the settings shown in Figure 8-3.
4. Click the Set to Current Page button.
5. Alternatively, click the New Windows Open With pop-up menu and
choose Empty Page if you want Safari to open a new window with a
blank page.
This is the fastest choice of all for a home page (and a good choice for
those using a dialup modem connection because Safari doesn’t have to
download anything upfront).

Chapter 8: Let’s Go on Safari!
Lean, fast, and mean — That’s RSS
Well, maybe not mean — after all, I don’t want
you to be afraid of RSS (RDF Site Summary, or
really simple syndication) pages! RSS Web sites
display updated information by using a short-
ened list format, rather like a newspaper head-
line, without unnecessary graphics or silly
advertisements. You can tell when a Web site
has RSS pages available because Safari dis-
plays an RSS icon at the right side of the
Address box. (When you click the RSS icon, the
Web address switches to a feed:// prefix —
another indication that you’re not in Kansas
reading HTML pages anymore.)
To display more information about a news item
on an RSS page, click the item headline. Safari
opens the corresponding Web page — yep,
once again you’re back in the world of HTML —
where you can read the full story. To return to
the RSS feed, click the Back button on the
Toolbar. Naturally, RSS feed pages can be book-
marked. In fact, Apple gives you a number of
RSS sites that you can explore immediately.
To customize your RSS display, choose Safari➪
Preferences and then click the RSS tab. By
default, Safari checks for updated RSS headlines
on your bookmarked feeds every 30 minutes, but
you can change this to an hourly or daily check.
(Of course, you can also check for updates man-
ually by reloading the RSS page, just like you
would any other Web page.) New articles can be
assigned any color you like, and you can specify
the amount of time an item should remain on the
RSS page after it’s published.

Adding and Using Bookmarks
No doubt about it: Bookmarks make the Web a friendly place. When you set
bookmarks in Safari, you can immediately jump from one site to another with
a single click of the Bookmarks menu or the buttons on the Bookmarks bar.
(The Bookmarks menu opens up in a separate pane on the left side of the
Safari window, and the Bookmarks bar appears right below the Toolbar. The
method you use is up to your preference.)
To add a bookmark, first navigate to the desired page and then do any of the
following:
 Choose Bookmarks➪Add Bookmark.
 Press the Ô+D keyboard shortcut.
Safari displays a sheet where you can enter the name for the bookmark
and also select where it appears (on the Bookmarks bar or the
Bookmarks menu).
 Drag the icon next to the Web address from the Toolbar to the
Bookmarks bar.
You can also drag a link on the current page to the Bookmarks bar, but note
that doing this only adds a bookmark for the page corresponding to the link —
not the current page.
To jump to a bookmark
 Choose it from the Bookmarks menu.
If the bookmark is contained in a folder, which I discuss later in this sec-
tion, move your mouse pointer over the folder name to show its contents
and then click the bookmark.
 Click the bookmark on the Bookmarks bar.
If you’ve added a large number of items to the Bookmarks bar, click the
More icon on the edge of the Bookmarks bar to display the rest of 
the buttons.
 Click the Show All Bookmarks button (which looks like a small, opened
book) on the Bookmarks bar and then click the desired bookmark.
The Bookmarks window that you see in Figure 8-4 appears, where you
can review each collection of bookmarks at leisure.
120
Part III: Connecting and Communicating 

The more bookmarks that you add, the more unwieldy the Bookmarks
menu and the Bookmarks window become. To keep your bookmarks
organized, choose Bookmarks➪Add Bookmark Folder and then type a
name for the new folder. With folders, you can organize your bookmarks
into collections, which appear in the column at the left of the Bookmarks
window (or as separate submenus within the Bookmarks menu). You
can drag bookmarks into the new folder to help reduce the clutter.
To delete a bookmark or a folder from the Bookmarks window, click it and
then press Delete.
Downloading Files
A huge chunk of the fun that you find on the Web is the ability to download
images and files. If you’ve visited a site that offers files for downloading, you
typically just click the Download button or the download file link, and Safari
takes care of the rest. You see the Downloads status window, which keeps
you updated with the progress of the transfer. While the file is downloading,
feel free to continue browsing or even download additional files; the status
window helps you keep track of what’s going on and when everything will be
finished transferring. To display the Download status window from the key-
board, press Ô+Option+L.
Figure 8-4:

121
Chapter 8: Let’s Go on Safari!

By default, Safari saves any downloaded files to your Mac OS X Download
folder on the Dock, which I like and use. To specify the location where down-
loaded files are stored — for example, if you’d like to scan them automatically
with an antivirus program — follow these steps:
1. Choose Safari➪Preferences or press Ô+, (comma).
2. Click the General tab and then click the Save Downloaded Files To
pop-up menu.
3. Choose Other.
4. Navigate to the location where you want the files stored.
5. Click the Select button.
6. Click the Close button to exit Preferences.
To download a specific image that appears on a Web page, move your mouse
pointer over the image and hold down Control while you click (or right-click,
if you’ve got the button to spare). Then choose Download Image to Disk from
the pop-up menu that appears. Safari prompts you for the location where you
want to store the file.
You can choose to automatically open files that Safari considers safe — things
like movies, text files, and PDF files that are very unlikely to store a virus or a
damaging macro. By default, the Open “Safe” files After Downloading check
box is enabled on the General pane. However, if you’re interested in prevent-
ing anything you download from running until you manually check it with
your antivirus application, you can disable the check box and breathe easy.
Luckily, Safari has matured to the point that it can seamlessly handle virtually
any multimedia file type that it encounters. However, if you’ve downloaded a
multimedia file and Safari doesn’t seem to be able to play or display it, try
loading the file within QuickTime. QuickTime is the Swiss Army knife of multi-
media players, and it can recognize a huge number of audio, video, and image
formats.
Using Subscriptions and History
To keep track of where you’ve been, you can display the History list by click-
ing the History menu. To return to a page in the list, just choose it from the
History menu. Note that Safari also arranges older history items by the date
you visited the site, so you can easily jump back a couple of days to that page
you forgot to bookmark!
122
Part III: Connecting and Communicating 

In fact, Safari also searches the History list automatically, when it fills in an
address that you’re typing. That’s the feature I mention in the earlier section,
“Visiting Web Sites.”
If you’re worried about security and you’d rather not keep track of where
you’ve been online, I show you how to clear the contents of the History file 
in the upcoming section, “Handling ancient history.”
Tabs Are Your Browsing Friends
Safari also offers tabbed browsing, which many folks use to display (and orga-
nize) multiple Web pages at one time. For example, if you’re doing a bit of
comparison shopping for a new piece of hardware between different online
stores, tabs are ideal.
When you hold down the Ô key and click a link or bookmark using tabs, a 
tab representing the new page appears under the Bookmarks bar. (Choose
File➪New Tab or press Ô+T to work the same magic.) Just click the tab to
switch to that page. (If you don’t hold down Ô, things revert to business as
usual, and Safari replaces the contents of the window with the new page.)
Figure 8-5 illustrates a number of pages that I opened in Safari, using tabs.
To turn on tabbed browsing, choose Safari➪Preferences to display the
Preferences dialog; then click Tabs. From here, select the Ô-Click Opens a
Link in a New Tab check box to enable it. After you turn on tabs, your brows-
ing experience will never be the same.
Done with a page? You can remove a tabbed page by clicking the X button
next to the tab’s title.

Searching for pointed sewing implements
Looking for a certain word or phrase on a huge
Web page that seems to be 47 screens long?
Don’t despair! You can always press Ô+F (or
choose Edit➪Find➪Find) to display the Find bar
(which appears directly under the Safari tool-
bar). Type the word or phrase that you’re look-
ing for in the Find box — no need to press
Return — and Safari highlights any matches
that it finds!
Click the Next button in the Find bar to advance
to each spot within the page in order, all the way
to the bottom of the page. To search upward to
the top of the page, click Previous. When you’re
finished searching, click the Done button to
banish the Find bar.
Convenient, indeed. Consider that needle found!

Saving Web Pages
If you encounter a page that you’d like to load later, you can save it to disk in
its entirety as a Web archive (which stores all the page content, including the
text and images). Follow these steps:
1. Display the desired page.
2. Choose File➪Save As, or press Ô+S.
3. In the Export As text field, type a name for the saved page.
4. From the Where field, navigate to the location where you want to
store the file on your system.
To expand the sheet to allow navigation to any location on your system,
click the button with the downward arrow.
5. Click the Format pop-up menu to choose the format for the saved page.
Usually, you’ll want to choose a Web Archive, which saves the entire
page and can be displayed just as you see it. However, if you want to
save just the HTML source code, choose Page Source.
6. Click Save to begin the download process.
After the Save file is created, double-click it to load it in Safari.

Part III: Connecting and Communicating 

A quick word about printing a page within Safari: Some combinations of back-
ground and text colors might conspire together to render your printed copy
practically worthless. In a case like that, use your printer’s grayscale setting
(if it has one). Alternatively, you can simply click and drag to select the text
on the page, press Ô+C to copy it, and then paste the text into Word or Pages,
where you can print the page on a less-offensive background (while still keep-
ing the text formatting largely untouched).
If you’d rather mail the contents of a Web page to a friend — or just a link to
the page, which is faster to send over a dialup Internet connection — choose
File➪Mail Contents of this Page/Mail Link to this Page. (From the keyboard,
press Ô+I to send the contents in an e-mail message, or press Ô+Shift+I to
send a link in e-mail.) Mail loads automatically, complete with a prepared
e-mail message. Just address it to the recipients and then click Send!
Protecting Your Privacy
No chapter on Safari would be complete without a discussion of security, both
against outside intrusion from the Internet and prying eyes around your Mac.
Hence, this last section, which covers protecting your privacy.
Although diminutive, the tiny padlock icon that appears in the top-right corner
of the Safari window when you’re connected to a secure Web site means a great
deal! A secure site encrypts the information that you send and receive, making
it much harder for those of unscrupulous ideals to obtain things like credit
card numbers and personal information.
Yes, there are such things as bad cookies
First, a definition of this ridiculous term: A cookie, a small file that a Web site
automatically saves on your hard drive, contains information that the site
will use on your future visits. For example, a site might save a cookie to pre-
serve your site preferences for the next time or — in the case of a site such
as Amazon.com — to identify you automatically and help customize the offer-
ings that you see.
In and of themselves, cookies aren’t bad things. Unlike a virus, a cookie file
isn’t going to replicate itself or wreak havoc on your system, and only the
original site can read the cookie that it creates. However, many folks don’t
appreciate acting as a gracious host for a slew of little snippets of personal
information. Also, if you do a large amount of surfing, cookies can occupy a
significant amount of your hard drive space over time. (Not to mention that
some cookies have highly suggestive names, which could lead to all sorts of
conclusions. End of story.)
125
Chapter 8: Let’s Go on Safari!

You can choose to accept all cookies — the default — or you can opt to dis-
able cookies altogether. You can also set Safari to accept cookies only from
the sites you choose to visit. To change your Cookie Acceptance Plan (or CAP,
for those who absolutely crave acronyms), follow these steps:
1. Choose Safari➪Preferences.
2. Click the Security toolbar button.
Safari displays the preference settings shown in Figure 8-6.
3. Choose how to accept cookies via these radio button choices:
• Never: Block cookies entirely.
• Always: Accept all cookies.
• Only from Sites You Navigate To: Personally, I use this default
option, which allows sites like Amazon.com to work correctly with-
out allowing a barrage of illicit cookies.
4. To view the cookies currently on your system, click the Show Cookies
button.
If a site’s cookies are blocked, you might have to take care of things man-
ually, such as providing a password on the site that used to be read
automatically from the cookie.
5. Click the Close button to save your changes.

Cleaning your cache
Safari speeds up the loading of Web sites by storing often-used images and
multimedia files in a temporary storage, or cache, folder. Naturally, the files in
your cache folder can be displayed (hint), which could lead to assumptions
(hint, hint) about the sites you’ve been visiting (hint, hint, hint). (Tactful,
ain’t I?)
Luckily, Safari makes it easy to dump the contents of your cache file. Just
choose Safari➪Empty Cache; then click Empty to confirm that you want to
clean up your cache.
Handling ancient history
As you might imagine, your History file leaves a very clear set of footprints
indicating where you’ve been on the Web. To delete the contents of the
History menu, choose History➪Clear History.
The latest version of Safari also allows you to specify an amount of time to
retain entries in your History file. Open the Safari Preferences dialog, click
the General tab, and then click the Remove History Items pop-up menu to
specify the desired amount of time. Items can be rolled off daily, weekly,
biweekly, monthly, or yearly.
Avoiding those @*!^%$ pop-up ads
I hate pop-up ads, and I’m sure you do, too. To block most of those pop-up
windows with advertisements for everything from low-rate mortgages to
“sure-thing” Internet casinos, click the Safari menu and verify that Block Pop-
Up Windows is checked. (If it’s not checked, click the menu item to toggle the
menu item on.)
From time to time, you might run across a Web site that actually does some-
thing constructive with pop-up windows, like present a download or login
prompt. If you need to temporarily deactivate pop-up blocking, press Ô+
Shift+K to toggle it off. Then press Ô+Shift+K again to turn pop-up blocking
back on after you’ve finished with the site.

eaders often ask me to name my favorite reasons why they should
switch — that is, why should a Windows user who thinks all is well
move to the Apple universe? Of course, I always mention the superior hard-
ware and how much better of a job Leopard does as an operating system.
Here’s my favorite selling point: “Apple simply does things right the first time,
and everyone else plays catch-up.”
And then I pose this question: “What if you could reach a hard drive with 10GB
of your files over any Internet connection — anywhere in the world — and it
just showed up on your Desktop automatically?” Usually, I get a thoughtful
silence after that one, and another person decides to find out more — about
the Apple .Mac online hosting service, that is.
In this chapter, I save you the trouble of researching all the benefits of .Mac.
Heck, that’s one of the reasons why you bought this book, right?
Wait a Minute: Where Exactly 
IS My .Mac Storage?
Yep, that’s the question everyone asks. Best that I answer this one first.
I’ll begin with a definition. The online hard drive offered to .Mac subscribers
(read about subscribing in the following section) is an iDisk, and it’s well inte-
grated into Mac OS X. In fact, if you didn’t know the background, you might

think that iDisk were simply another internal hard drive. Figure 9-1 illustrates
my iDisk icon on my Desktop. The Finder window displays the contents;
notice the folders visible there. (More on these folders later in the chapter.)
The files that I add to my iDisk are stored on an Apple server, location
unknown. Literally. The physical storage (a massive file server that holds
uncounted gigabytes of data) could be in Cupertino, or it might be in
Timbuktu. There’s a whole bunch of ’em, too. You and I don’t need to care
about the where part because
 Your iDisk is always available. Oh, yes. 24/7, your files are waiting 
for you.
 Your iDisk is secure. Apple goes to great lengths to guarantee the secu-
rity of your data, encrypting the transfer of files and folders whenever
you use your iDisk. You can also password-protect any data that you
want to offer to others, just in case.
 Your iDisk works even when you aren’t on the Internet. Yep, you read
that right: You can create new documents and modify files to your heart’s
content while you’re on a flight or relaxing on the beach. iDisk automati-
cally updates whatever’s changed the next time you connect to the
Internet.
Now that I’ve piqued your interest (and answered the most common question
about iDisk), return to the .Mac service for a moment so I can show you how
to set up your account.

Opening a .Mac Account
If you haven’t already opened your .Mac account, you get a chance to sign up
when you turn on your iMac for the first time and also when you install (or
upgrade) Mac OS X. However, if you decided to pass on .Mac at that time, you
can always join in the fun by following these steps:
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock.
2. Click the .Mac icon.
3. Click the Learn More button.
This launches Safari and displays the Apple .Mac Welcome page (www.
mac.com/dotmac). Click Free Trial and then follow the onscreen
instructions to choose a member name and password.
When you’re done with the clicking and you’re rewarded with your login
information, close Safari and then enter your name and password into
the text boxes in the .Mac System Preferences pane.
Figure 9-2 illustrates an example login that I created.
Like the convenient operating system that it is, Leopard handles all your .Mac
login chores automatically from this point on.
If you’re a dialup Internet user, you were likely dreading this moment, but
here it is. I’m truly sorry, but in my opinion, a high-speed broadband connec-
tion is a real requirement in order to take full advantage of a .Mac subscrip-
tion. You can certainly still use all the functionality of .Mac with any type of
Internet connection, but you’re going to spend from now until the next Gone
With the Wind sequel waiting for files to copy and things to happen.

Chapter 9: Moving to .Mac

If you decide to sign up for a full year’s .Mac membership, I salute you for
your discerning taste in online services. However, you can opt for a 60-day
trial subscription at this point, which is only fair because Apple wants you 
to check out things at your leisure. Table 9-1 shows the major differences
between a free trial subscription and a full $100 yearly subscription to .Mac.

A .Mac subscription also allows you to synchronize your e-mail, Address
Book contact information, and your Safari bookmarks between multiple
Macs. What a real boon if you spend time on the road with a MacBook or 
a MacBook Pro laptop!
Both trial and subscriber .Mac users can read .Mac e-mail through the Web-
based browser offered on the .Mac Web site. That’s neat, certainly, and you
can use Web mail from any computer with an Internet connection. However,
you can also send and receive .Mac e-mail seamlessly from Leopard’s Mail
application, which is the preferred method of checking your messages. In
fact, Leopard automatically creates a matching Mail account for your trial
.Mac account!
If you decide that you want the extra functionality of a .Mac subscription,
upgrading is easy. When you open the .Mac pane within System Preferences
and click the Account button, Leopard displays a countdown reminder telling
you how many days remain on your trial period. To upgrade, visit the .Mac
Web site at any time and click the Join Now button.
iDisk . . . iGetIt!
So how do you open your iDisk? Leopard gives you a number of different
avenues:
 Choose Go➪iDisk from the Finder menu and then choose My iDisk
from the submenu.
Keyboard types can press Ô+Shift+I instead.
 Click the iDisk icon in the Finder window Sidebar.
132
Part III: Connecting and Communicating 

 Click the iDisk button on your Finder toolbar.
It’s easy to add an iDisk button. Open a Finder window, click View, and
then click Customize Toolbar. Drag the iDisk icon up to the toolbar 
and click Done.
After you open your iDisk, an iDisk volume icon also pops up on your Desktop.
You can open the little scamp later in your computing session by simply
double-clicking the Desktop icon. The Desktop iDisk icon hangs around until
you log out, restart, eject the iDisk, or shut down your iMac.
It’s all in the folders
Your iDisk contains a number of different folders. Some of them are similar to
the subfolders in your Home folder, and others are unique to the structure of
your iDisk. In this section, I provide the details on the iDisk folder family.
iDisk storage folders
Although you can store files and create folders in the root (or top level) of an
iDisk, the same organizational tips apply as those dealing with the root of
your iMac’s internal hard drive. In other words, most things that you copy to
or create on your iDisk should be stored in one of these six folders (refer to
Figure 9-1 to see them):
 Documents: Store the documents that you create with your applications
in this folder, which only you can access.
 Movies: This folder stores your QuickTime movies (including any that
you might use in your .Mac Web pages).
 Music: iTunes music and playlists go here.
133
Chapter 9: Moving to .Mac
Is .Mac an ISP?
.Mac is many things, but it isn’t an ISP (techno-
nerd shorthand for Internet Service Provider).
You need to join an ISP first because you need
an existing Internet connection to use the 
services and features included in .Mac mem-
bership. This makes a lot of sense, considering
that most of us already have Internet access.
(Plus, Apple doesn’t have to worry with all the
support and hardware headaches that an ISP
has to deal with.)
.Mac works with the ISP that you already have,
so you don’t have to worry about AOL or
EarthLink conflicting with .Mac. (However, I
can’t guarantee that your system administrator
at work will allow .Mac traffic across his or her
pristine network. Perhaps a steak dinner would
help your argument.)

 Pictures: The digital images that you store in this folder can be used
with other .Mac services (like your Web pages) or within iPhoto.
 Public: The files that you store in this folder are meant to be shared with
other people (as well as offered on your .Mac Web pages). You can also
allow others to copy and save files to your Public folder as well (more
on this later in this section).
 Sites: You can use HomePage to create Web pages in this folder, or you
can add Web pages that you’ve created with your own applications. You
can read more about HomePage, the Apple Web page-creation applica-
tion, in the upcoming section, “Publishing a Web Site with HomePage.”
These folders can be opened in a Finder window just like any typical folder
on your iMac’s internal hard drive, and you can open and save documents to
your iDisk folders, using all your applications. In other words, these six iDisk
folders act just like normal, everyday folders. Pretty doggone neat!
Funky specialized iDisk folders
Your iDisk contains three folders that you can’t use to store stuff (directly,
anyway):
 Backup: This is the storage vault for the backup files created with the
.Mac Backup application.
Because you have Read access to the Backup folder, you can copy the
backup files from this folder to a CD, DVD, or removable drive on your
iMac. (I cover backing up later in this chapter.)
 Library: Like the Library folders that you find in the root of your hard
drive (and in your Home folder), this folder stores all sorts of configura-
tion settings for the .Mac features that you’re using, like your Backup
settings.
 Software: This read-only folder is a special case. Apple stuffs this folder
full of a wide variety of the latest in freeware and shareware as well as
commercial demo software. You can copy whatever you like from the
Software folder to your iMac’s Desktop and then install your new toy
from that local copy. (Oh, and the contents of the Software folder don’t
count against your total storage space limit.) Enjoy!
Mirror, mirror, on your drive . . .
You can use your iDisk even if you aren’t connected to the Internet. This
magic is accomplished through a mirror, or local copy of your iDisk, that’s
stored on your local hard drive. (“Hey, wasn’t I supposed to be getting away
134
Part III: Connecting and Communicating 

from storing things locally?”) If you choose to use a mirror — and you can
enable this feature if you like. The next time you connect to the Internet,
Leopard automatically synchronizes any files that you created or changed on
your local iDisk copy. This is a great feature if you have more than one Mac in
different locations because you can update and synchronize your iDisk files
from any of your computers — all automatically!
Without a mirror, you must have an active Internet connection to use your
iDisk.
To enable (or disable) the mirror feature, open System Preferences, click the
.Mac icon, and then click the iDisk tab to display the settings you see in
Figure 9-3. Click the Start button, and — after a moment of preparation, 
complete with its own dialog — the text above the button reads iDisk
Syncing On.
If you use a local copy of your iDisk — and I recommend it — choose to syn-
chronize automatically. This ensures that your files get updated even if you’re
somewhat forgetful, like I am.
A mirror makes things much faster when you browse your iDisk or when you
save and load documents from your iDisk. Leopard actually uses your local
copy from your hard drive, and then updates your remote iDisk files in the
background while you work. (Leopard is updating your iDisk whenever you
see that animated circular-yin-yang-thinglet rotating next to your iDisk icon 
in the Finder window. You’ll know it when you see it.)
Figure 9-3:

135
Chapter 9: Moving to .Mac

Monitoring and configuring your iDisk
The iDisk pane in System Preferences groups together all the configuration
settings you can make to your iDisk and your .Mac account. In this section, I
review the controls that you can find here.
Disk space
Concerned about how much of your 100MB (for trial users) or 10GB (for sub-
scribers) remains? The iDisk panel (refer to Figure 9-3) includes the Disk
Space bar graph, which always displays how much of your iDisk space is free.
(The bar actually totals only half of your storage because the other half of
your iDisk is reserved for e-mail use.)
Public folder
The Finder Go menu includes a shortcut to access another .Mac member’s
Public folder.
Password
I strongly recommend that you set a password to protect the contents of
your Public folder.
This password must be entered by anyone trying to open your Public folder.
If you haven’t supplied that person with the proper password, he can’t open
your Public folder. Just that simple. (There’s nothing more embarrassing than
discovering the bikini shots from your vacation are available for every .Mac
user to peruse.)
Here’s one drawback to this extra level of security: If you password-protect
your Public folder, it can’t be used to store anything that you offer on your
.Mac Web pages.
Settings
While you’re in the iDisk panel, you can configure your Public folder security
settings. You can decide whether others should be able to
 Only read the contents of your Public folder.
By default, the Public folder is set to read-only.
 Copy documents to your Public folder.
To give others the ability to save and copy, select the Read & Write radio
button.
136
Part III: Connecting and Communicating 

Backing Up Your Treasured Stuff
My editors have heard me drone on and on long enough about how impor-
tant it is to back up your hard drive. They probably rub their eyes when they
encounter yet another instance of my preaching about the wages of backup
sloth and losing everything but hindsight.
Well, you’re lucky, because I was just about to launch into another round 
of backup warnings. .Mac subscribers get a great utility application called
Backup when they join the club. Backup is a great application that saves a
copy of your treasured data on just about any media on the planet, including
 Your iDisk (using the Backup folder that I discuss earlier in this chapter)
 An external USB or FireWire hard drive
 Recordable CD or DVD media
 Network servers
 Your iPod
Before you get too enthusiastic about backing up to your iPod, heed this: You
can indeed back up to your iPod (or I wouldn’t have listed it as an option),
but your iPod’s tiny hard drive isn’t meant to handle the same serious thrash-
ing as a full-size external hard drive. Personally, I’ve never used my iPod as a
backup destination, and I don’t recommend that you do, either, unless no
other recording media is handy and you absolutely have to have a backup.
If you’d like an offline copy of your data that would survive a catastrophe like
a fire or theft, consider using both Time Machine and Backup. That way, your
stuff is covered in the WCS (short for worst case scenario).
Installing Backup
Backup isn’t built into Leopard; you have to download it from the .Mac site at
www.mac.com/dotmac. After the image file is mounted on your Desktop, you
see the Backup installation folder. Double-click the Backup.pkg file to begin
the installation. After installation is complete, you can find Backup in your
Applications folder.
Saving your stuff
Nothing is more important to a proud iMac owner than a secure backup; in
this section, I demonstrate how you can produce both manual backups 
137
Chapter 9: Moving to .Mac

(produced whenever you like) and automated backups (which are scheduled
at regular intervals). Do it!
Remember, you’re limited to 100MB with a trial membership! (We’re still talk-
ing about several hundred JPEG images that can fit in 100MB, but that total
isn’t much when you consider digital video or your iTunes Library.)
Beginning a backup is as easy as marking the check boxes next to the items
that you want to safeguard. These are the default Backup Plans available, and
they are already scheduled to start automatically.
After you enable the check boxes for the items you want to back up, follow
these steps to start a manual backup:
1. Click Continue to display the Backup main window.
Notice that each backup plan you selected on the previous screen has a
scheduled time assigned to it for automatic operation.
2. Click the plan you want to select it; then click Back Up.
The rest is cake as your irreplaceable stuff is saved to your iDisk. 
If you ever need to restore from your backup, click the desired plan to select
it, and then click the Restore button. Backup leads you through the restore
process with the same aplomb.
The Backup application itself doesn’t need to be running for the automated
backup to kick off, but keep in mind that your iMac must remain awake! Make
sure that
• You’re logged in.
• Sleep mode is completely disabled on the Energy Saver pane
within System Preferences.
• Your computer has an active Internet connection.
Publishing a Web Site with HomePage
HomePage is a very popular feature for .Mac members. Most iMac owners
aren’t Web page designers, after all, and HomePage is extremely easy to use.
Apple is smart enough to let trial .Mac members use HomePage; you can try
it before you decide to invest in a .Mac subscription.
Follow these steps to create a new Web page on your .Mac site with HomePage:
1. Launch Safari and visit www.apple.com/dotmac.
138
Part III: Connecting and Communicating 

2. Click the Log In link, and enter your .Mac member name and pass-
word when prompted.
3. Click the HomePage link at the top of the .Mac Welcome page.
The HomePage top-level page that you see in Figure 9-4 appears.
4. Choose a theme for your page from the tabbed display at the left of
the screen.
Some of the categories are specially designed for certain chores. For
example, the Photo Album theme collection is perfect for showing off
your digital photographs online, and the File Sharing category presents
an easy downloading format for your visitors. Each of these different 
categories displays different onscreen instructions that are specific to
their use.
For an elegant site where you show off your best photography online,
click the Formal frame in the Photo Album category.
5. Choose the folder with the photos you want to include on the page.
This can be either your iDisk Pictures folder or a subfolder that you cre-
ated within it.
6. Click Choose.
HomePage loads all the images in the selected folder.
Figure 9-4:
Good call —

139
Chapter 9: Moving to .Mac

7. Mark the Show check box for each image that you want to appear.
8. Drag the image thumbnails to the order that you want.
9. Click in the text boxes to add
• The Web page title
• An introductory sentence (or two)
• The titles for each photo
You can display a counter (which tallies how many visitors came to 
your page) and an e-mail button (so your visitors can send a message 
to your .Mac e-mail account). To use either of these features, just mark
the corresponding Show check box to enable it.
10. Click Preview in the toolbar at the top of the page to see what your
page will look like.
If the page you see in Preview mode isn’t up to snuff, click the Back
button on the Safari Toolbar to edit it.
11. If you like what you see, click the Publish button.
Huzzah! You’re a Web page designer! (Insert sound of champagne cork
popping here.)
HomePage displays your new Web page address, which you can click to
jump directly to your new work of art.
The steps to create a page vary by category. However, the only category that
really requires any rocket science is the Advanced tab, which allows you 
to use your own HTML files that you copy to your iDisk Sites folder. Not to
worry, though: Just follow the onscreen instructions for creating a Web site
with your own HTML files, and you’ll be fine.

In This Chapter
 Adding a printer or a scanner to your system
 Using Photo Booth
 Putting your Apple Remote to work
 Watching cable or satellite TV on your iMac
T
his chapter is all about getting interesting things into — and out of —
your iMac. Some are more common (almost mundane these days) and
pretty easy to take care of, such as scanners and printers. Then I might sur-
prise you with something new to you, like your iMac’s built-in video camera.
I also show you how to turn your iMac into a photo booth, and how to use
that wonderful Apple Remote that came with your computer. Heck, I’ll even
describe how you can pull that fancy satellite or cable TV signal into your
iMac.
It’s perfectly okay to tell everyone else that you’re watching the financial
channel. But watching a little football never hurt anyone. . . .
Connecting Printers
All hail the USB port! It’s the primary connection point for all sorts of good-
ies. In this section, I concentrate on adding a local USB printer and the basics
of adding a network printer to your system. (Find more on connecting a wire-
less Bluetooth printer in the Bonus Chapter at www.mlcbooks.com.)
USB printers
Connecting a USB printer to your iMac is duck soup. Don’t you wish all things
in life were this easy? You might very well be able to skip most of the steps in
this section entirely, depending on whether your printer came with an 

installation disc. (Virtually all do, of course, but you might have bought yours
used, say from eBay.)
Your printer needs to be fully supported within Mac OS X:
 If the software is designed for earlier versions of Mac OS X (say, v. 10.3
or v. 10.4), it probably works with Leopard.
 I always recommend visiting the manufacturer’s Web site to download
the latest printer driver and support software before you install your
printer. That way, you know that you’re up to date. (Don’t forget to
check the Read Me file that accompanies your new software to make
sure there are no new system requirements!)
Save and close open files and applications before installing your printer. You
might have to restart your iMac to complete the installation.
The physical connections for your printer are pretty simple:
 Make sure that your printer’s USB cable is plugged in to both your iMac
and the printer itself. (For a printer, I recommend using one of the iMac’s
USB ports on the back of the computer.)
 After the USB connection is made, plug the printer in to an AC wall
socket and turn it on.
Don’t forget to add the paper and check the ink cartridge(s)!
The finishing printer installation steps depend on whether you have a manu-
facturer’s installation CD for your printer.
Sure, I’ve got the install disc
If your printer comes with its manufacturer’s installation disc, follow these
steps when everything is connected and powered on:
1. Insert the installation disc in the iMac.
The disc contents usually appear in a Finder window. If they don’t, double-
click the installation disc icon on the Desktop to open the window.
2. Double-click the installation application to start the ball rolling.
3. Follow the onscreen instructions.
Files get copied to your hard drive.
You might have to restart your iMac.
You’re ready to print!
142
Part III: Connecting and Communicating 

Don’t forget to visit your printer manufacturer’s Web site to check whether
any driver updates are available for your particular model.
Whoops, I’ve got diddly-squat (Software-wise)
Didn’t get an installation CD? Try installing the printer without software, or
download the software from the manufacturer’s Web site.
Installing without software
If you didn’t get an installation CD with your printer, you might be lucky
enough that your printer’s driver was included in your installation of Mac OS
X. First, press Ô+P within an application to display the Print dialog, where
you can check see whether the printer you connected is already recognized.
If it’s not displayed, here’s how to check for that pesky driver after you con-
nect the printer and switch it on:
1. Open the System Preferences window.
2. Click the Print & Fax icon.
3. Click the Add button (which sports a plus sign).
4. Check the Printer list in the Printer Setup Utility window to see whether
your printer has already been added automatically within Leopard.
If your printer appears here, dance a celebratory jig. You can close System
Preferences and choose that printer from the Print dialog in your appli-
cations. (You can even set it as the default from the System Preferences
Print & Fax pane. Just click the Default Printer pop-up menu to select
your new printer.)
Downloading software
If you don’t have installation software and your iMac doesn’t automatically
match your USB printer with a driver, it’s time to check the Internet to locate
a Leopard-compatible driver for your printer.
Check the manufacturer’s Web site for your printer’s software. Look for
 Special software drivers that the printer might need
Install any drivers you find before you run an installation application.
Otherwise, the installation app might not be able to recognize or config-
ure the printer if the driver hasn’t been installed first.
 Installation application
If the manufacturer offers an installation application for your printer,
download the application and run it.
143
Chapter 10: Hooking Up with Handy Helpers

Network printers
Your wired or wireless Ethernet network provides a quick-and-easy way to
share any printer that’s connected to your iMac. Follow these steps to share
your printers across the network with others:
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock.
2. Click the Sharing icon.
3. Select the On check box next to the Printer Sharing service entry.
4. Click Close to exit System Preferences.
In most cases, a printer that you share automatically appears in the Print
dialog on other computers connected to your network. Therefore, if you want
to access a printer being shared by another Mac across your network, open
the Print dialog within your application and click the Printer pop-up menu to
select it.
If the remote printer isn’t listed automatically, you can dig a little further. To
add a printer that another Mac on your network is sharing to your list of
printers, follow these steps:
1. Click System Preferences on the Dock.
2. Click the Print & Fax icon.
3. Click the Add button (which carries a plus sign).
4. Click the Default button on the toolbar.
Leopard displays all the available local shared printers. Click the desired
printer and then click Add.
Connecting Scanners
USB and FireWire scanners practically install themselves. As long as the
model is listed as Mac OS X-compatible and it supports the TWAIN device
standard (just about all scanners do), things really are plug-and-play. (Not
sure if a scanner is Mac OS X-compatible? Check the system requirements 
on the scanner’s box or on the manufacturer’s Web site.)
If you have the scanner manufacturer’s installation disc, go ahead and use it.
However, most scanners don’t require specialized drivers, so even that orphan
model that you picked up from Uncle Milton last year should work (if it’s 
144
Part III: Connecting and Communicating 

recognized by Mac OS X). It doesn’t hurt to check the manufacturer’s Web
site to see whether any of the software has been updated since the disc was
produced.
If Mac OS X doesn’t support your older scanner, a third-party application
might be able to help. Get thee hence to Hamrick Software at www.hamrick.
com and download a copy of the latest version of VueScan. This great scan-
ning application supports over 750 scanner models, including a number that
don’t work with Leopard otherwise. At $40, it’s a world-class bargain to boot.
Ready to go? Make sure that your scanner is powered on and connected to
your iMac (and that you load a page or photograph to scan). If your scanner’s
installation disc provided you with a proprietary scanning application, I rec-
ommend that you use that application to test your scanner. In fact, it’s Mark’s
Maxim time!
If your printer or scanner includes bundled applications, use them! TM
Sure, Mac OS X has the Print & Fax pane within System Preferences for print-
ers and the Image Capture application for scanners and digital cameras, but
these are bare-bones tools compared with the print manager and image
acquisition software that comes bundled with your hardware. I turn to
Leopard’s built-in hardware handling stuff only when I don’t have anything
better.
Hey, I’m not saying that anything’s wrong with Image Capture, which is in
your Applications folder, if you need to use it. However, don’t expect Image
Capture to support any specialized features offered by your scanner (like
one-button e-mail or Web publishing). You have to use the application espe-
cially designed for your manufacturer and model to take advantage of any
extras that it offers.
Using Photo Booth and Front Row
Many Apple switchers and first-time owners quickly notice two rather unusual
items that accompany the latest iMacs: One appears to be a tiny square lens
and LED light at the top of the iMac’s svelte frame, and the other looks like a
stick of chewing gum sporting buttons. What gives?
First, allow me to identify these toys. The former is the lens of your iMac’s
built-in iSight camera, which allows you to capture video or snap a quick fun
series of photos via Leopard’s Photo Booth application. The latter is your
Apple Remote, which you can use to control your iMac from the comfort of
your lounge chair or breakfast nook via Leopard’s Front Row software.
145
Chapter 10: Hooking Up with Handy Helpers

Capturing the moment with Photo Booth
What’s that you say? You’ve never used a computer video camera? Well then,
good reader, you’ve come to the right place!
The iSight camera’s indicator light glows green whenever you’re taking a
snapshot or recording video . . . which, when you think about it, is A Good
Thing (especially if you prefer chatting at home in Leisure Mode).
If you need a quick picture of yourself for use on your Web page, or perhaps
your iChat icon needs an update to show off your new haircut, use Photo
Booth to capture images at 640 x 480 resolution and 32-bit color. Although
today’s digital cameras can produce a much higher-quality photo, you can’t
beat the built-in convenience of Photo Booth for that quick snapshot!
To snap an image in Photo Booth, follow these steps:
1. Launch Photo Booth from the Dock or from the Applications folder.
Check out that glowing LED!
2. (Optional) Click the Effects button to choose an effect you’d like to
apply to your image.
Photo Booth displays four screens of thumbnail preview images (see
Figure 10-1) so that you can see how each effect changes the photo. To
move through the thumbnail screens, click the Previous and Next arrow
buttons that appear around the Effects button.
You can produce some of the simple effects you might be familiar with
from Photoshop, such as a black-and-white image or a fancy, colored
pencil filter . . . but it can also deliver some mind-blowing distortion
effects, and even an Andy Warhol–style pop-art image!
Of course, you can always launch your favorite image editor afterward
to use a filter or effect on a photo — for example, the effects available in
iPhoto — but Photo Booth can apply these effects automatically as soon
as you take the picture.
3. (Optional) Click a thumbnail to select the desired effect.

The image appears in the film strip at the bottom of the window. Photo Booth
keeps a copy of all the images you take in the film strip so that you can use
them later. After you click a photo in the filmstrip, a series of buttons appear,
inviting you take any one of a series of actions, including
 Sending the photo in an e-mail message
 Saving the photo directly to iPhoto
 Using the image as your Leopard user account icon
 Using the image as your iChat Buddy icon
To delete an image from the Photo Booth filmstrip, click the offending photo
and then click the X button that appears underneath.
If you’re itching to connect a USB digital camera for use with iPhoto, let me
redirect you to Chapter 12, where I cover the iPhoto experience in depth.
To capture a video clip, click the Movie Clip button (which bears frames from
an old-fashioned movie reel) at the lower left of the Photo Booth window. Click
the Big Red Movie Button to start recording, and click again to end the clip.

Controlling your iMac remotely 
with Front Row
Okay, you’ve seen some neat stuff so far, but things get really cool about now!
With Apple’s Front Row software, you can turn your iMac into a multimedia
presentation center that can show off all your digital media to your adoring
public (and friends and family to boot). In fact, with the Apple Remote, you
don’t even have to leave the comfort of the couch to start the show.
The Front Row application performs four different functions:
 Watching DVD movies with DVD Player: If you already loaded a DVD
into your optical drive, you can watch it. (Sorry, your iMac doesn’t load
the DVD for you. I guess some things have to remain manually driven for
a few years yet.)
 Viewing photos and slideshows: Front Row calls upon iPhoto so that
you can see your albums, film rolls, and slideshows.
 Displaying videos in QuickTime Player: You can choose any video you
download from the iTunes Music Store or save to your Movies folder.
 Coaxing your favorite music, podcasts, and TV shows from your
iTunes library: Find your media and playlists available from Front Row.
All this is accomplished by using the awesome, infrared Apple Remote you
see in Figure 10-2. If your last computer — the beige box — didn’t have a
remote control, don’t panic. It’s as simple to use as an iPod Shuffle!

Note that Front Row has no complex configuration. Front Row is what design-
ers call a front-end application; that is, it launches the Leopard applications
necessary to display or play the media you select. (There is a simple Settings
menu in Front Row, offering you the chance to toggle your screen saver and
menu sound effects off or on. Both options are turned on by default.)
Your Apple Remote isn’t designed to work with any other third-party applica-
tions at the time of this writing. For example, you can’t use it as a presentation
aide in PowerPoint. However, some Apple applications do recognize the Apple
Remote (like Keynote), and it’s a sure bet that Apple will continue to add
functionality to the Apple Remote in the future. Check the Apple Remote 
section of Leopard’s online Help system to keep tabs on what’s happening!
Turning Your iMac into 
a TV — And More
Your iMac’s beautiful LCD screen would seem to be the perfect artist’s canvas
for watching cable or satellite TV broadcasts, but there’s no co-ax input on
the back of your computer. Therefore, unless you invest in some additional
hardware, you’re restricted to watching DVD movies.
Such an obvious need is going to be filled quickly, and a number of different
hardware manufacturers have produced external devices that can merge
your iMac and your TV signal. Most are USB or FireWire peripherals, and
many have all the features of today’s TiVo and digital video recorders.
My favorite example is the EyeTV Hybrid, from Elgato Systems (www.elgato.
com), which uses a USB connection. Check out what this superstar includes
for your investment of $150:
 Built-in NTSC (analog) and ATSC (digital TV) tuners, cable-ready with a
coaxial connector
 The ability to pause, fast-forward, record, or even edit the video you
stored on your iMac’s hard drive
 Capability to schedule recordings with an onscreen program guide
 Full-screen TV display or in a window anywhere on your Desktop
 No external power supply required
I really love the ability to fast-forward through commercials, and I can take
anything that I record on my iMac and use it in iDVD and iMovie. The addi-
tion of TV under your control sorta finalizes the whole digital hub thing, now
doesn’t it?

 Playing music with your iMac

 Buying the good stuff from the iTunes Store
S
ometimes, words just aren’t enough. iTunes is that kind of perfection.
To envision how iTunes changes your iMac, you have to paint the picture with
music — music that’s easy to play, easy to search, and easy to transfer from
place to place. Whether it be classical, alternative, jazz, rock, hip-hop, or folk, 
I can guarantee you that you won’t find a better application than iTunes to 
fill your life with your music. And podcasts. And video. And TV shows. And
Internet radio. (See how hard it is to pin down this wonderful application?
Along with your iMac, iTunes really does form the hub of your digital lifestyle.)
In this chapter, I lead you through all the features of my absolute favorite
member of the iLife suite . . . and it’s going to be pretty doggone obvious 
how much I appreciate this one piece of software.
What Can I Play on iTunes?
Simply put, iTunes is a media player: It plays audio and video files. These files
can be in many different formats. Some of the more common audio formats
that iTunes supports are
 MP3: The small size of MP3 files has made them popular for file trading
on the Internet. You can reduce MP3 files to a ridiculously small size
(albeit at the expense of audio fidelity), but a typical CD-quality, three-
minute pop song in MP3 format has a size of 3–5MB.

 AAC: AAC (short for Advanced Audio Coding) is an audio format that’s
very similar to MP3; in fact, AAC files offer better recording quality at
the same file sizes. However, this format also supports a built-in, copy-
protection scheme that prevents AAC music from being widely distrib-
uted on Macs. (Luckily, you can still burn AAC tracks to an audio CD,
just like MP3 tracks.) The tracks that you download from the iTunes
Store are in AAC format.
The iTunes Store’s recently introduced iTunes Plus tracks are also in AAC
format, but these tracks are not copy-protected, and they’re encoded at a
higher-quality 256 Kbps rate. You can listen to your iTunes Plus tracks on
as many Macs as you like.
 Apple Lossless: Another format directly from Apple, Apple Lossless
format provides the best compromise between file size and sound qual-
ity. These tracks are encoded without loss of quality (hence, the name,
as opposed to lossy compression schemes, such as MP3). However,
Apple Lossless tracks are somewhat larger than AAC files, so they’re
generally the favorite of the most discerning audiophile for their entire
music library.
 AIFF: This standard Macintosh audio format produces sound of the
absolute highest quality. This high quality, however, also means that 
the files are pretty doggone huge. A typical pop song in AIFF format 
has a size of 30–50MB.
 WAV: Not to be outdone, Microsoft created its own audio file format (WAV)
that works much like AIFF. It can reproduce sound at higher quality than
MP3, but the file sizes are very large, like AIFF.
 CD audio: iTunes can play audio CDs. Because you don’t usually store
CD audio anywhere but on an audio CD, file size is no big whoop.
 Movies and video: You can buy and download full-length movies, TV
shows, music videos, and movie trailers from the iTunes Store. And, with
an Apple TV unit connected to your home theater system, you can watch
those movies and videos from the comfort of your sofa on the other side
of your house.
 Podcasts: These relatively new programs are like radio programs for
your iPod, but iTunes can play and organize them, too. Some podcasts
also include video and photos, to boot.
 Audiobooks: No longer do you need cassettes or audio CDs to enjoy
your spoken books. iTunes can play them for you, or you can send them
to your iPod for listening on the go.
 Streaming Internet radio: You can listen to a continuous broadcast of
songs from one of tens of thousands of Internet radio stations, with 
quality levels ranging from what you’d expect from FM radio to the 
full quality of an audio CD. You can’t save the music in iTunes, but it’s
still great fun. (In fact, I run my own station . . . more on MLC Radio later
in the chapter.)

Part IV: Living the iLife 

Playing an Audio CD
Playing an audio CD in iTunes is simple. Just insert the CD in your computer’s
disc tray, close the tray, start iTunes by clicking its icon on the Dock, and
click the Play button. (Note that your iMac might be set to automatically
launch iTunes when you insert an audio CD.) The iTunes interface resembles
that of a traditional cassette or CD player. The main playback controls of the
iTunes are Previous Song, Play, Next Song, and the volume slider, as shown in
Figure 11-1.
Click the Play button to begin listening to a song. While a song is playing, the
Play button toggles to a Pause button. As you might imagine, clicking that
button again pauses the music. If you don’t feel like messing around with a
mouse, you can always use the keyboard. The spacebar acts as the Play and
Pause buttons. Press the spacebar to begin playback; press it again to stop.
Click the Next Song button to advance to the next song on the CD. The
Previous Song button works like the Next Song button but with a slight twist:
If a song is playing and you click the Previous Song button, iTunes first
returns to the beginning of the current song (just like an audio CD player). 
To advance to the previous song, double-click the Previous Song button. To
change the volume of your music, click and drag the volume slider.

Like other Macintosh applications, you can control much of iTunes with the
keyboard. Table 11-1 lists some of the more common iTunes keyboard short-
cuts. (Note that iTunes must be the active application for these shortcuts to
work.)

Playing Digital Audio and Video
In addition to playing audio CDs, iTunes can also play the digital audio files
that you download from the Internet or obtain from other sources in the WAV,
AAC, Apple Lossless, AIFF, and MP3 file formats. Enjoying a digital audio file 
is just slightly more complicated than playing a CD. After downloading or
saving your audio files to your iMac, open the Finder and navigate to wher-
ever you stored the files. Then simply drag the music files (or an entire folder
of music) from the Finder onto the Music entry in the iTunes Source list, on
the left side of the iTunes window. (The added files appear in the iTunes
Music Library. Think of the Library as a master list of your music.
To view the Music Library, select the Music entry in the left-hand column of
the iTunes player, as shown in Figure 11-2. Go figure.) Heck, you can also drag
a song file from a Finder window and drop it on the iTunes icon in the Dock,
which adds it to your Music Library as well.
If you drop the file on top of a playlist name in the Source list, iTunes adds it
to that particular playlist as well as the main Library. (More about playlists 
in a bit.)
156
Part IV: Living the iLife 

To play a song, just double-click it in the Music Library list. Alternatively, you
can click the song once to select it and use the playback controls (Previous
Song, Play, and Next Song) that I discuss earlier in this chapter. (Refer to
Figure 11-1.)
The Source list of iTunes can list up to six possible sources for audio:
 Library: This section includes Music, Movies, TV Shows, Podcasts,
Audiobooks, iPod Games, and Radio. (Think Internet radio, which I 
discuss further in the section, “iTunes Radio.”)
 iPod: If an iPod is connected, it appears in the list. (And yes, Virginia,
other models of MP3 players from other companies also appear in the
list if they support iTunes.)
 iTunes Store: I discuss this later in the section, “Buying Digital Media
the Apple Way.”
 Audio CD: A standard audio CD . . . anything from the Bee Gees to Fall
Out Boy.
 Shared music: If another Mac on your local network is running iTunes
and is set to share part (or all) of its library, you can connect to the
other computer for your music. (Shared music on another Mac appears
as a separate named folder in the Source list.) Of course, you can elect
to share your music with others as well.
 Playlists: Think of playlists as folders that you use to organize your
music. (More on playlists later in this chapter.)

Chapter 11: The Multimedia Joy of iTunes

If you’ve invested in an Apple TV, it will appear in the list, but it doesn’t actu-
ally provide media for you to enjoy on your iMac. Instead, content flows in
the other direction, with iTunes streaming or synchronizing media to your
Apple TV, which in turn sends it to your EDTV or HDTV.
Notice also that the Library lists information for each song that you add to it,
such as
 Name: The title of the song
 Time: The length of the song
 Artist: The artist who performs the song
 Album: The album on which the song appears
Most MP3 files have embedded data — title, album, or artist information, for
example — that iTunes can read, but don’t panic if those fields are blank or
generic right now. If a song doesn’t include any data, you can always add the
information to these fields manually. I show you how later in the section,
“Setting or changing the song information manually.”
Clicking any of the column headings in the Library causes iTunes to reorder
the Library according to that category. For example, clicking the Name
column heading alphabetizes your Library by song title (and another click
reverses the order). I click the Time heading often to sort my Library accord-
ing to the length of the songs. Oh, and you can drag column titles to reorder
them any way you like.
iTunes can display your Music Library in three ways: By default, the applica-
tion uses the list view that you see in Figure 11-1, where each song is one
entry. Click the second View button (at the top of the iTunes window) to
group tracks together by album. Click the third View button (Cover Flow),
and you’re browsing by album cover, complete with reflective surface!
In fact, you can even browse full-screen in Cover Flow mode. Click the Full-
Screen button at the lower right of the cover pane — it looks like a box with
arrows at each corner — and iTunes switches to full-screen mode, complete
with those familiar play controls.
Browsing the Library
After you add a few dozen songs to iTunes, viewing the Library can become a
task. Although a master list is nice for some purposes, it becomes as cumber-
some as an elephant in a subway tunnel if the list is very long. To help out,
iTunes can display your Library in another format, too: namely, browsing
mode. To view the Library in browsing mode, click the Browse button at the
lower-right corner of the iTunes window, which carries an eye icon.
158
Part IV: Living the iLife 

The Browse mode of iTunes displays your library in a compact fashion, orga-
nizing your tunes into four sections:
 Genre
 Artist
 Album
 Name
Selecting an artist from the Artist list causes iTunes to display that artist’s
albums in the Album list. Select an album from the Album list, and iTunes dis-
plays that album’s songs in the bottom section of the Browse window. (Those
Apple software designers . . . always thinking of you and me.) Note that the
Browse button is disabled in Cover Flow view mode.
Finding songs in your Music Library
After your collection of audio files grows large, you might have trouble locat-
ing that Swedish remix version of “I’m Your Boogie Man.” To help you out,
iTunes has a built-in Search function. To find a song, type some text into the
search field of the main iTunes window. While you type, iTunes tries to find a
selection that matches your search text. The search is quite thorough, show-
ing any matching text from the artist, album, song title, and genre fields in 
the results. For example, if you type Electronic into the field, iTunes might
return results for the band named Electronic or other tunes that you classi-
fied as electronic in the Genre field. (The upcoming section, “Know Your
Songs,” tells you how to classify your songs by genre, among other options.)
Click the magnifying glass at the left side of the Search field to restrict the
search even more: by Artists, Albums, Composers, and Songs.
159
Chapter 11: The Multimedia Joy of iTunes
Will I trash my Count Basie?
Novice iTunes users, take note: iTunes watches
your back when you trash tracks.
To illustrate: Suppose you try to delete a song
from the Library that’s located only in the iTunes
music folder (which you didn’t copy into iTunes
from another location on your hard drive). That
means you’re about to delete the song entirely,
with no copy remaining on your iMac. Rest
assured, though, that iTunes will prompt you to
make sure that you really want to move the file
to the Trash. (I get fearful e-mail messages all
the time from readers who are loath to delete
anything from iTunes because they’re afraid
they’ll trash their digital music files completely.)
Remember: If you delete a song from the Library
that exists elsewhere on your hard drive (out-
side the reach of the iTunes music folder), it isn’t
deleted from your hard drive. In fact, if you mis-
takenly remove a song that you meant to keep,
just drag it back into iTunes from the Finder, or
even from the Trash. ’Nuff said.

Removing old music from the Library
After you spend some time playing songs with iTunes, you might decide that
you didn’t really want to add 40 different versions of “Louie Louie” to your
Library. (Personally, I prefer either the original or the cast from the movie
Animal House.) To remove a song from the Library, click the song to select it
and then press the Delete key on your keyboard. (If that sounds a bit daunt-
ing, check out the sidebar earlier in the chapter, titled “Will I trash my Count
Basie?”)
Watching video
Watching video in iTunes is similar to listening to your music. To view your
video collection, click one of these entries in the Source list:
 Movies
 Music Videos
 Video Podcasts
 TV Shows
If you select Movies or TV Shows, iTunes displays your videos as thumbnails.
Music Videos appear as a standard playlist.
From your collection, you can
 Double-click a video thumbnail or an entry in the list.
 Drag any QuickTime-compatible video clip from the Finder window to
the iTunes window.
These typically include video files ending in .mov or .mp4.
iTunes plays video full-screen, but when you move your mouse, a control strip
appears, sporting a standard slider bar that you can drag to move through the
video (as well as a volume control and Fast Forward/Reverse buttons). You
can also pause the video by clicking the Pause button.
Keeping Slim Whitman and Slim Shady
Apart: Organizing with Playlists
Given time, your iTunes Music Library can quickly become a fearsomely huge
beastie. Each Library can contain thousands upon thousands of songs: If
your Library grows anywhere near that large, finding all the songs in your 
160
Part IV: Living the iLife 

lifelong collection of Paul Simon albums is not a fun task. Furthermore, with
the Library, if you just click Play, you’re stuck listening to songs in the order
that iTunes lists them.
To help you organize your music into groups, use the iTunes playlist feature.
A playlist is a collection of some of your favorite songs from the Library. You
can create as many playlists as you want, and each playlist can contain any
numbers of songs. Whereas the Library lists all available songs, a playlist dis-
plays only the songs that you add to it. Further, any changes — deleting a
song, for example — that you make to a playlist affect only that playlist, leav-
ing the Library intact.
For example, suppose that you want to plan a party for your polka-loving
friends. Instead of running to your computer after each song to change the
music, you could create a polka-only playlist. Select and start the playlist at
the beginning of the party, and you won’t have to worry about changing the
music the whole night. (You can concentrate on the accordion.)
To create a playlist, you can do any of the following:
 Choose File➪New Playlist.
 Press Ô+N.
 Choose File➪New Playlist from Selection. This creates a new playlist
and automatically adds any tracks that are currently selected in the
Library. iTunes also attempts to name the playlist automatically for you.
 Click the New Playlist button in the iTunes window (the plus sign
button in the lower-left corner). You get a newly created empty playlist
(the toe-tappin’ untitled playlist).
All playlists appear in the Source list. To help organize your playlists, it’s a
good idea to . . . well . . . name them. (Aren’t you glad now that you have this
book?) To load a playlist, select it in the Source list; iTunes displays the
songs for that playlist. Click the playlist entry in the source list again to type
a new name for the playlist.
To add a song from the Library to your new playlist, click the Library and
find the song you want to include, and then drag it to the desired playlist
entry in the Source list.
The same song can appear in any number of playlists because the songs in a
playlist are simply pointers to songs in your Music Library — not the songs
themselves. Add and remove them at will to any playlist, secure in the knowl-
edge that the songs remain safe in the Library. As for removing playlists
themselves, that’s simple, too. Just select the playlist in the Source list and
then press Delete.
Removing a playlist doesn’t actually delete any songs from your Library.
161
Chapter 11: The Multimedia Joy of iTunes

Click the Party Shuffle playlist, and you encounter a random selection of
songs taken from your iTunes Music Library — perfect for your next party!
You can change the order of the songs in the Party Shuffle playlist, add songs
from your Library, or delete songs that don’t fit the scintillating ambience of
your gathering. Enjoy!
Know Your Songs
Besides organizing your music into Elvis and non-Elvis playlists, iTunes gives
you the option to track your music at the song level. Each song that you add
to the Music Library has a complete set of information associated with it.
iTunes displays this information in the Info dialog, including
 Name: The name of the song
 Artist: The name of the artist who performed the song
162
Part IV: Living the iLife 
Some playlists are smarter than others
From the File menu, take a look at a menu com-
mand for creating a smart playlist. The contents
of a smart playlist are automatically created
from a specific condition or set of conditions
that you specify via the Smart Playlist dialog:
You can limit the track selection by mundane
things, such as album, genre, or artist; or, you
can get funky and specify songs that were
played last, or by the date you added tracks, or
even by the sampling rate or total length of the
song. For example, iTunes can create a playlist
packed with songs that are shorter than three
minutes, so you can fill your iPod Shuffle with
more stuff! Ah, but wait! You’re not limited to a
single criterion. If you want to add other crite-
rion, click the plus sign at the right side of the
dialog, and you get another condition field to
refine your selection even further.
You can choose the maximum number of songs
to add to the smart playlist; or limit the size of the
playlist by the minutes or hours of play, or the
number of megabytes or gigabytes the playlist
will occupy. (Again, great for automatically gath-
ering as much from your KISS collection that will
fit into a specific amount of space on a CD or
your iPod.) Mark the Live Updating check box for
the ultimate in convenience. iTunes automati-
cally maintains the contents of the smart playlist
to keep it current with your conditions at all times
in the future. (If you remove tracks manually from
a smart playlist, iTunes adds other tracks that
match your conditions.)
Now think about what all these settings mean
when combined . . . whoa. Here’s an example
yanked directly from my own iTunes library. I
created a smart playlist that selects only those
songs in the Rock genre. It’s limited to 25 songs,
selected by least often played, and live updat-
ing is turned on. The playlist is named “Tracks
I’ve Gotta Hear” because it finds the 25 rock
songs (from my collection of 1,654 songs) that
I’ve heard least often! After I listen to a song
from this smart playlist, iTunes automatically
“freshens” it with another song, allowing me to
catch up on the tracks I’ve been ignoring.
Completely, unbelievably sweet — and another
reason why iTunes is the best music player on
Planet Earth!

 Composer: The name of the astute individual who actually wrote the song
 Album Artist: The name of the artist responsible for a compilation or
tribute album
 Album: The album where the song appears
 Grouping: A group type that you assign
 Year: The year the artist recorded the song
 BPM: The beats per minute (which indicates the song’s tempo)
 Track Number: The position of the song on the original album
 Disc Number: The original disc number in a multi-CD set
 Comments: A text field that can contain any comments on the song
 Genre: The classification of the song (such as rock, jazz, or pop)
You can display this information by clicking a song name and pressing Ô+I —
the fields appear on the Info tab. Alternately, you can click File➪Get Info.
Setting the song information 
automatically
Each song that you add to the iTunes Music Library might have song informa-
tion included with it. If you add music from a commercial audio CD, iTunes
connects to a server on the Internet and attempts to find the information for
each song on the CD. If you download a song from the Internet, it often comes
with some information embedded in the file already; the amount of included
information depends on what the creator supplied. (And believe me, it’s often
misspelled as well — think Leenard Skeenard.) If you don’t have an Internet
connection, iTunes can’t access the information and displays generic titles
instead.
Internet connection restored? You can download the information on a CD at
any time by choosing Advanced➪Get CD Track Names.
Setting or changing the song 
information manually
If iTunes can’t find your CD in the online database or someone gives you 
an MP3 with incomplete or inaccurate information, you can change the 
163
Chapter 11: The Multimedia Joy of iTunes

information yourself — believe me, you want at least the artist and song
name! To view and change the information for a song, perform the following
steps:
1. Select the song in either the Music Library list or a playlist.
2. Press Ô+I or choose File➪Get Info.
3. Edit the song’s information on the Info tab, as shown in Figure 11-3.
Keep in mind that the more work you put into setting the information of the
songs in your Music Library, the easier it is to browse and use iTunes.
Incomplete song information can make it more difficult to find your songs in a
hurry. If you prefer, you don’t have to change all information about a song. (It
just makes life easier later if you do.) Normally, you can get away with setting
only a song’s title, artist, and genre. The more information you put in, how-
ever, the faster you can locate songs and the easier they are to arrange.
iTunes tries to help by automatically retrieving known song information, but
sometimes you have to roll up your sleeves and do a little work. (Sorry, but
the Data Elves are out to lunch.)

“What about cover art, Mark?” Well, I’m overjoyed that you asked! iTunes dis-
plays the artwork in a number of different places (including Album view and
Cover Flow view), and the application can try to locate artwork automatically
for the tracks you select. (Note that adding large images can significantly
increase the size of the song file.) Follow these steps:
1. Select the desired songs from the track list.
2. Choose Advanced➪Get Album Artwork.
You can set iTunes to automatically attempt the addition of album artwork
every time you rip tracks from an audio CD, or when you add songs without
artwork to your Music Library. Click iTunes and choose Preferences. Click
the General button and then select the Automatically Download Missing
Album Artwork check box to enable it.
Unfortunately, the Get Album Artwork feature often doesn’t pull in any art-
work for little-known artists. Luckily, you can always add album covers to
your song info manually! Select one (or all) of the songs from a single album
in the track list, display the Info dialog, and click the Artwork tab. Now
launch Safari, visit Amazon.com, and do a search on the same album. Drag
the cover image from the Web page right into the Info dialog and then drop 
it on top of the image well. When you click OK, the image appears in the
Summary pane, and you can display it while your music is playing by press-
ing Ô+G, or by pressing the Show or Hide Song Artwork button at the lower
left of the iTunes window! (Again, adding large images can significantly
increase the size of the song file.)
By the way, if you buy tracks or an album from the iTunes Store, Apple
always includes album covers automatically. Thanks, Steve!
Ripping Audio Files
You don’t have to rely on Internet downloads to get audio files: You can create
your own MP3, AAC, Apple Lossless, AIFF, and WAV files from your audio CDs
with iTunes. The process of converting audio files to different formats is rip-
ping. (Audiophiles with technical teeth also call this process digital extraction,
but they’re usually ignored at parties by the popular crowd.) 
Depending on what hardware or software you use, you’re likely to encounter
differences in formats. For example, most iPod owners prefer MP3 or AAC
files, but your audio CDs aren’t in that format. Being able to convert files from
one format to another is like having a personal translator in the digital world.
You don’t need to worry if you have the wrong format: You can simply con-
vert it to the format that you need.
165
Chapter 11: The Multimedia Joy of iTunes

The most common type of ripping involves converting CD audio to MP3
format. To rip MP3s from an audio CD, follow these simple steps:
1. Launch iTunes by clicking its icon on the Dock.
Alternatively, you can locate it in your Applications folder.
2. Choose iTunes➪Preferences.
3. In the Preferences window that appears, click the Advanced toolbar
button.
4. Click the Importing tab.
5. Choose MP3 Encoder from the Import Using pop-up menu.
6. Choose High Quality (160 Kbps) from the Setting pop-up menu and
then click OK.
This bit rate setting provides the best compromise between quality
(better than CD quality, which is 128 Kbps) and file size. (Tracks that
you rip will be significantly smaller than “audiophile” bit rates, such 
as 192 Kbps or higher.)
7. Load an audio CD into your iMac.
The CD title shows up in the iTunes Source list, which is on the left side
of the iTunes interface. The CD track listing appears on the right side of
the interface.
If iTunes asks you whether you want to import the contents of the CD
into your Music Library, you can click Yes and skip the rest of the steps.
However, if you disabled this prompt, just continue with the remaining
two steps.
8. Clear the check box of any song that you don’t want to import from
the CD.
All songs on the CD have a check box next to their title by default.
Unmarked songs aren’t imported.
Notice that the Browse button changes to Import CD.
9. After you select the songs that you want added to the Library, click
the Import CD button.
Tweaking the Audio for Your Ears
Besides the standard volume controls that I mention earlier in this chapter,
iTunes offers a full equalizer. An equalizer permits you to alter the volume of
various frequencies in your music, allowing you to boost low sounds, lower
high sounds, or anything in between. Now you can customize the way that
your music sounds and adjust it to your liking.
166
Part IV: Living the iLife 

To open the Equalizer (as shown in Figure 11-4), do one of the following.
 Choose Window➪Equalizer.
 Press Ô+Option+2.
 Choose View➪Show Equalizer.
The Equalizer window has an impressive array of 11 sliders. Use the leftmost
slider (Preamp) to set the overall level of the Equalizer. The remaining sliders
represent various frequencies that the human ear can perceive. Setting a
slider to a position in the middle of its travel causes that frequency to play
back with no change. Move the slider above the midpoint to boost that fre-
quency; conversely, move the slider below the midpoint to reduce the
volume of that frequency.
Continue adjusting the sliders until your music sounds how you like it. When
you close the Equalizer window, iTunes remembers your settings until you
change them again. If you prefer to leave frequencies to the experts, the iTunes
Equalizer has several predefined settings to match most musical styles. Click
the pop-up menu at the top of the Equalizer window to select a genre.
After you adjust the sound to your satisfaction, close the Equalizer window
to return to the iTunes interface and relax with those funky custom notes
from James Brown.

A New Kind of Radio Station
Besides playing back your favorite audio files, iTunes can also tune in Internet
radio stations from around the globe. You can listen to any of a large number
of preset stations, seek out lesser-known stations not recognized by iTunes,
or even add your favorite stations to your Playlists. This section shows you
how to do it all.
iTunes Radio
Although it’s not a radio tuner in the strictest sense, iTunes Radio can locate
virtual radio stations all over the world that send audio over the Internet — a
process usually dubbed streaming amongst the “In” Internet crowd. iTunes
can track down hundreds of Internet radio stations in a variety of styles with
only a few mouse clicks.
To begin listening to Internet radio with iTunes, click the Radio icon located
beneath the Library icon in the Source list. The result is a list of more than 
20 types of radio stations, organized by genre.
When you expand a Radio category by clicking its triangle, iTunes queries a
tuning server and locates the name and address of dozens of radio stations
for that category. Whether you like Elvis (or those passing fads, such as new
wave, classical, or alternative), something’s here for everyone. The Radio
also offers news, sports, and talk radio.
168
Part IV: Living the iLife 
What’s with the numbers next 
to the station names?
When choosing an Internet radio station, keep
your Internet connection speed in mind. If you’re
using a broadband DSL or cable connection —
or if you’re listening at work over your company’s
high-speed network — you can listen to stations
broadcasting at 128 Kbps (or even higher). The
higher the bit rate, the better the music sounds.
At 128 Kbps, for example, you’re listening to
sound that’s as good as an audio CD.
However, if you’re listening over a dialup modem
connection, iTunes can’t keep up with audio
streaming at higher bit rates, so you’re limited to
stations broadcasting at 56 Kbps or lower.

After iTunes fetches the names and descriptions of radio stations, double-
click one that you want to hear. iTunes immediately jumps into action, loads
the station, and begins to play it.
Tuning in your own stations
Although iTunes offers you a large list of popular radio stations on the Web,
it’s by no means comprehensive. Eventually, you might run across a radio 
station that you’d like to hear, but it’s not listed in iTunes. Luckily, iTunes 
permits you to listen to other stations, too. To listen to a radio station that
iTunes doesn’t list, you need the station’s Web address.
In iTunes, choose Advanced➪Open Stream (or press Ô+U). In the Open Stream
dialog that appears (as shown in Figure 11-5), enter the URL of your desired
radio station and then click OK. Within seconds, iTunes tunes in your station,
and the station name is added as an entry in your Library.

Radio stations in your Playlists
If you find yourself visiting an online radio station more than once, you’ll be
glad to know that iTunes supports radio stations in its Playlists. To add a
radio station to a Playlist, do the following:
1. Open the category that contains the station that you want to add to
your Playlist.
2. Locate the station that you want to add to your Playlist and drag it
from the Radio list to the desired Playlist on the left.
If you haven’t created any Playlists yet, see the section, “Keeping Slim
Whitman and Slim Shady Apart: Organizing with Playlists,” earlier in 
this chapter to find out how.
Adding a radio station that doesn’t appear in the Radio list is a bit trickier but
possible nonetheless. Even though iTunes allows you to load a radio station
URL manually by using the Open Stream command in the Advanced menu, it
doesn’t give you an easy way to add it to the Playlist. Follow these steps to
add a specific radio station to a Playlist:
1. Add any radio station from the Radio list to your desired Playlist.
Any station in the list will do because you’ll immediately change both the
station’s URL and name to create your new station entry in the Playlist.
2. Press Ô+I or choose File➪Get Info to bring up the information dialog
for that station.
3. Click the Summary section and change the URL by clicking the Edit
URL button.

I have an itch to hear “Kung Fu Fighting”!
This particular technology author has a prefer-
ence for a certain hot Net jam spot: MLC Radio,
the Internet radio station I’ve been running for
several years now. I call my station a ’70s Time
Machine because it includes hundreds of clas-
sic hits from 1970–1979, inclusive. You hear
everything from “Rock and Roll Hoochie Koo”
by Rick Derringer to “Moonlight Feels Right” by
Starbuck. (Hey, I’m summing up a decade here,
so be prepared for both Rush and the Captain
and Tennille, too.) The station broadcasts at 128
Kbps (audio CD quality), so you need a broad-
band connection to listen. For the radio’s Internet
address or help connecting to MLC Radio, visit
my Web site at www.mlcbooks.com — then
follow the steps in the next section to add MLC
Radio to your playlists!

4. Enter the desired URL and then click OK.
5. Click the Info tab, type the new station name, and then click OK.
iSending iStuff to iPod
If you’re lucky enough (like me) to own an iPod, you’ll be happy to know that
iTunes has features for your personal audio and video jukebox as well. iPods,
Apple’s MP3 players, comprise an entire family of portable devices (ranging
from $79 to about $399) that can hold anywhere from about 300 songs to lit-
erally thousands of songs, as well as podcasts, photos, and video. This great
gadget has become known worldwide as the preferred portable digital media
player.
You connect your iPod to any Macintosh with USB 2.0 ports with the included
cable. After the iPod is connected, iTunes automatically synchronizes the
media on your iPod to match the Playlists in iTunes. The iPod and the iTunes
software communicate with each other and figure out what items are in your
iTunes Library (as compared with the iPod Library). If they discover songs,
podcasts, and video in your iTunes Library that are missing from your iPod,
the items automatically transfer to the iPod. Conversely, if the iPod contains
stuff that’s no longer in iTunes, the iPod automatically removes those files
from its drive.
Go back and reread that last sentence above about the iPod automatically
removing files from its drive. (I’ll wait here.) Apple added this feature in an
effort to be attentive to copyright concerns. The reasoning is that if you 
connect your iPod to your friend’s computer, you can’t transfer songs from
the iPod to that computer. Of course, you could always look at it from the
marketing perspective as a feature that makes sure your iMac and iPod are
always in total sync. Whatever the case, pay close attention and read all
warning dialogs when connecting to a Mac other than your own, or you might
wipe out your iPod’s library.
The best thing I can say about the iPod and iTunes combination is . . . well . . .
that there isn’t anything else to say about them. The auto-sync feature is so
easy to use, you forget about it almost immediately. You can also specify
what types of media are synced, and even whether specific playlists are
transferred.
This chapter — even as long as it is — just can’t explain all the ins and outs
of the iTunes/iPod relationship! For a complete look at both iTunes and the
iPod, I can heartily recommend a fellow Dummies book, iPod & iTunes For
Dummies, 5th Edition, by Tony Bove and Cheryl Rhodes (Wiley).

Sharing Your Media across Your Network
Ready to share your music, podcasts, and video — legally, mind you — with
other folks on your local network? You can offer your digital media to other
iTunes users across your home or office. Follow these steps:
1. Choose iTunes➪Preferences to open the Preferences dialog.
2. Click Sharing.
3. Select the Share My Library on My Local Network check box.
4. Specify whether you want to share your entire library or only
selected playlists and files.
Sharing selected playlists is a good idea for those Meatmen and Sex
Pistols fans who work at a cubicle farm in a big corporation.
5. If you want to restrict access to just a few people, select the Require
Password check box; then type a password in the text box.
6. Click OK.
Your shared folder appears within the Source list for all iTunes users who
enabled the Look for Shared Libraries check box on the same pane of the
Preferences dialog. Note that the music you share with others can’t be
imported or copied, so everything stays legal.
Want to change that frumpy default name for your shared media library to
something more exotic, like “Dan’s Techno Beat Palace?” No problem. Just
display the Preferences dialog again, but this time, click the General button,
and select the Shared Name text box. Edit your network entertainment per-
sona to your heart’s content.
Have you picked up an Apple TV for your home entertainment system? This
new device can send your digital media wirelessly from iTunes on your iMac
or PC straight to your widescreen TV and high-tech audio system. In fact,
there’s enough to cover there for a whole book . . . hence, my Mac how-to
guide, Apple TV For Dummies, (Wiley) by yours truly! If you need help under-
standing every Apple TV cable and configuration setting, pick up a copy today.
Burning Music to Shiny Plastic Circles
Besides being a great audio player, iTunes is adept at creating CDs, too.
iTunes makes recording songs to a CD as simple as a few mouse clicks —
now, putting together the modern version of a compilation (or mix) tape is
easier than getting a kid to eat ice cream. iTunes lets you burn CDs in one of
three formats:
172
Part IV: Living the iLife 

 Audio CD: This is the typical kind of commercial music CD that you buy
at a store. Most typical music audio CDs store 700MB of data, which
translates into about 80 minutes of music.
 Data CD or DVD: A standard CD-ROM or DVD-ROM is recorded with the
audio files. This disc can’t be played in any standard audio CD player
(even if it supports MP3 CDs, which I discuss next). Therefore, you can
listen to these songs only by using your iMac and an audio player, like
iTunes or a PC running Windows.
 MP3 CD: Like the ordinary computer CD-ROM that I describe, an MP3 CD
holds MP3 files in data format. However, the files are arranged in such a
way that they can be recognized by audio CD players that support the
MP3 CD format (especially boom boxes, personal CD players, and car
stereos). Because MP3 files are so much smaller than the digital audio
tracks found on traditional audio CDs, you can fit as many as 160 typical,
four-minute songs on one disc. These discs can also be played on your
iMac via iTunes.
MP3 CDs aren’t the same as the standard audio CDs that you buy at the store,
and you can’t play them in older audio CD players that don’t support the MP3
CD format. Rather, this is the kind of archival disc that you burn at home for
your own collection.
First things first: Before you burn, you need to set the recording format. Open
the iTunes Preferences dialog by choosing iTunes➪Preferences. Click the
Advanced button, click the Burning tab, and select the desired disc format by
enabling the corresponding radio button. Click OK to close the Preferences
window when you’re finished.
173
Chapter 11: The Multimedia Joy of iTunes
Sending music elsewhere with AirTunes
If your iMac has built-in AirPort Extreme wire-
less hardware (all recent models do) and you’re
using an AirPort Express portable wireless Base
Station, you can ship your songs right to your
Base Station from within iTunes — and from
there to your home stereo or boom box! (I get
into some serious discussion of AirPort Express
in Chapter 17.)
After your AirPort Express Base Station is
plugged in and you connect your home stereo
(or a boom box, or a pair of powered stereo
speakers) to the stereo mini-jack on the Base
Station, you see a Speakers pop-up list button
appear at the bottom of the iTunes window. (If
the Speakers button doesn’t appear, choose
iTunes➪Preferences to open the Preferences
dialog and click the Advanced tab. Make sure
that the Look for Remote Speakers Connected
with AirTunes check box is enabled.)
Click the Speakers button, and you can choose
to broadcast the music you’re playing in iTunes
across your wireless network. Ain’t technology
truly grand?

The next step in the CD creation process is to build a playlist (or select an
existing playlist that you want to record). If necessary, create a new playlist
and add to it whatever songs you would like to have on the CD. (See the ear-
lier section, “Keeping Slim Whitman and Slim Shady Apart: Organizing with
Playlists,” if you need a refresher.) With the songs in the correct order, select
the playlist. Click the Burn Disc button at the bottom of the iTunes window to
commence the disc burning process. iTunes lets you know when the record-
ing is complete.
Feasting on iTunes Visuals
By now, you know that iTunes is a feast for the ears, but did you know that it
can provide you with eye candy as well? With just a click or two, you can
view mind-bending graphics that stretch, move, and pulse with your music,
as shown in Figure 11-6.
To begin viewing iTunes visuals, choose View➪Turn On Visualizer (or press
Ô+T). Immediately, most of your iTunes interface disappears and begins dis-
playing groovy lava lamp-style animations (like, sassy, man). To stop the visu-
als, choose View➪Turn Off Visualizer (or press Ô+T again). The usual sunny
aluminum face of iTunes returns.
Figure 11-6:
iTunes can
display
some
awesome
patterns!
174
Part IV: Living the iLife 

You can also change the viewing size of the iTunes visuals in the View menu.
From the View menu item, choose Full Screen (or press Ô+F). To escape from
the Full Screen mode, click the mouse or press Esc.
You can still control iTunes with the keyboard while the visuals are zooming
around your screen. See Table 11-1, earlier in this chapter, for a rundown on
common keyboard shortcuts.
The iTunes Visualizer has many hidden features. While viewing the Visualizer,
press H for Help to see a list of hidden Visualizer settings. Press H again (or ?),
and the list changes to reveal more hidden functions.
But wait, more Easter eggs are to be found! Again, while viewing the Visualizer,
press one of following keys:
 A: Changes the Visualizer pattern
 Z: Changes the Visualizer color scheme
Press either of these keys repeatedly to cycle through the various patterns
and color schemes lurking deep within the Visualizer. (Personally, I’m a
random Visualizer guy . . . with so many patterns and schemes, I just let my
iMac do all the work, and spend my time gazing at that beautiful 20-inch
widescreen display.) Additionally, you’ll find third-party Visualizer plug-ins
available for downloading on Apple’s Web site and other Mac-related down-
load sites.
175
Chapter 11: The Multimedia Joy of iTunes
Backing up within iTunes
iTunes offers a built-in backup feature for your
media library. (I told you this was the best media
player ever designed!) Choose File➪Back Up to
Disc to start the process. You can choose to
back up your entire iTunes library and all your
playlists (which I recommend) or just the con-
tent you purchased from the iTunes Store.
Personally, if I lost everything in my collection
except for what I’ve bought from the iTunes
Store, I’d be just as crushed. Back it all up, and
you won’t be sorry.
Click Back Up, and iTunes will prompt you for
blank CDs or DVDs. If you need to restore from
your completed backup, just launch iTunes and
load the first backup disc into your drive.
How often is often enough when it comes to
backing up your content? That depends com-
pletely on how often your media library
changes. The idea is to back up often enough
so that you always have a recent copy of your
media files close by.

Buying Digital Media the Apple Way
Before we wave goodbye to the happy residents of iTunes iSland, I won’t
forget to mention the hottest spot on the Internet for buying music and video:
the iTunes Store, which you can reach from the cozy confines of iTunes. (That
is, as long as you have an Internet connection. If you don’t, it’s time to turn
the page to a different chapter.)
Figure 11-7 illustrates the lobby of this online audio/video store. Click the
iTunes Store item in the Source list, and after a few moments, you’re pre-
sented with the latest offerings. Click a link in the Store list to browse accord-
ing to media type; or, click the Power Search link to search by song title, artist,
album, or composer. The Back/Forward buttons at the top of the iTunes Store
window operate much like those in Safari, moving you backward or forward
in sequence through pages that you’ve already seen. Clicking the Home
button (which, through no great coincidence, looks like a miniature house)
takes you back to the Store’s main page.
To display the details on a specific album or track, just click it. If you’re inter-
ested in buying just certain tracks (for that perfect road warrior mix), you 
get to listen to 30 seconds of any track — for free, no less, and at full sound
quality. To add an item to your iTunes Store shopping cart, click the Add
Song/Movie/Album/Video/Podcast button (sheesh!). When you’re ready to
buy, click the Shopping Cart item in the Source list and then click the Buy
Now button. (At the time of this writing, tracks are 99 cents a pop, and an
entire album is typically $9.99 . . . what a bargain! As I mention earlier in the
chapter, Apple now offers iTunes Plus tracks, which are higher in quality and
aren’t hobbled with copy protection. These tracks are also 99 cents each.)
The iTunes Store creates an account for you based on your e-mail address,
and it also keeps secure track of your credit card information for future pur-
chases. After you use the iTunes Store once, you never have to log in or
retype your credit card information again — iTunes identifies you by your
user account, and saves your buying method and information for future 
purchases.
The tracks and files that you download are saved to a separate playlist called
Purchased. After the download is finished, you can play ’em, move ’em to
other playlists, burn ’em to CD or DVD, share ’em over your network, or ship
’em to your iPod, just like any other item in your iTunes Library.
Remember all those skeptics who claimed that buying digital audio and video
could never work over the Internet because of piracy issues and high costs?
Well, bunkie, hats off to Apple: Once again, our favorite technology leader has
done something the right way!

The Masterpiece That Is iPhoto
In This Chapter
 Importing pictures from your hard drive or digital camera
 Organizing images with iPhoto
 Tweaking the appearance of photographs
 Sharing photos with your friends
V
irtually every Mac owner is likely to have a digital camera or a scanner.
Digital video (DV) camcorders have certainly grown more plentiful over
the past three or four years, and the iPod is the hottest piece of music hard-
ware on the planet at the time of this writing. The digital camera, however,
has reached what those funny (strange) marketing people refer to as satura-
tion, and iPhoto was written to address the needs of every person with a digi-
tal camera and an iMac!
With iPhoto, you organize, edit, and even publish your photographs. (It
sports more features than a handful of Swiss Army knives.) After you shoot
your photos with a digital camera, you can import them into iPhoto, edit
them, and publish them. You’re not limited to photos that you take yourself,
either; you can edit, publish, and organize all kinds of digital image files. You
can even create a photo album and use the iPhoto interface to order a hand-
some hard-bound copy shipped to you.
To sum it all up, I’m willing to bet that iPhoto is either the first or the second
iLife application that you fall in love with (running neck and neck with
iTunes). In this chapter, I show you how you can work digital image magic
with true Apple panache!
Delving into iPhoto
In Figure 12-1, you can see most of the major controls offered in iPhoto. Other
controls automatically appear when you enter different modes, I cover them
in upcoming sections of this chapter.

Although I cover these controls as well as the various parts of the window in
more detail in the following sections, here’s a quick rundown of what you’re
looking at:
 Source list: This list of image locations determines which photos iPhoto
displays.
• You can choose to display either your entire image library or just
the last “roll” of digital images that you downloaded from your
camera.
• You can display photos grouped by events — for example, a birth-
day party or family vacation. Each event covers a specific period 
of time.
• You can create new albums of your own that appear in the source
list; albums make it much easier to organize your photos.
• You can create books, calendars, cards, and slideshows as well.

 Viewer: This pane displays the images from the selected photo source.
You can drag or click to select photos in the Viewer for further tricks,
such as assigning keywords and image editing.
 Create button: Click this button to add a new blank album, book, calen-
dar, Web Gallery (for .Mac subscribers), greeting card, postcard, or
slideshow to your source list.
 Get Info button: Click this button to display information on selected
photos.
 Enter Full Screen button: Click this button to switch to a full-screen dis-
play of your photos. In full-screen mode, the images in the selected album
appear in a film strip across the top of the screen, and you can click one
to view that image using your iMac’s entire screen real estate. You can
also use the same controls that I discuss later in this chapter for editing
and adjusting images. Just move the mouse cursor to the top edge of the
full-screen display to show the menu or to the bottom edge to show 
the toolbar.
 Play Slideshow button: Select an event, album, book, or slideshow in
the Source list and then click this button to start a full-screen slideshow
using those images.
 Search box: Click the button next to the Search text box to locate photos
by specific criteria, or just click in the box and start typing to search by
description and title.
 Toolbar buttons: This group of buttons selects an operation that you
want to perform on the images you select in the Viewer.
 Thumbnail Resize slider: Drag this slider to the left to reduce the size of
the thumbnails in the Viewer. This allows you to see more thumbnails at
once, which is a great boon for quick visual searches. Drag the slider to
the right to expand the size of the thumbnails, making it easier to differ-
entiate details between similar photos in the Viewer.
Working with Images in iPhoto
Even a superbly designed image display and editing application (like iPhoto)
would look overwhelming if everything were jammed into one window. Thus,
Apple developers provide different operation modes (such as editing and
book creation) that you can use in the one iPhoto window. Each mode allows
you to perform different tasks, and you can switch modes at just about any
time by clicking the corresponding toolbar button.
In this section, I discuss three of these modes — import, organize, and edit —
and what you can do when you’re in them. Then I conclude the chapter with
sections on publishing and sharing your images.
181
Chapter 12: The Masterpiece That Is iPhoto

Import Images 101
In import mode, you’re ready to download images directly from your digital
camera — that is, as long as your specific camera model is supported in
iPhoto. You can find out which cameras are supported by visiting the Apple
iPhoto support page at
www.apple.com/iphoto/compatibility
Follow these steps to import images:
1. Connect your digital camera to your iMac.
Plug one end of a USB cable into your camera and the other end into
your iMac’s USB port, and then prepare your camera to download
images.
2. Launch iPhoto.
Launch iPhoto by clicking its icon on the Dock (or in your Applications
folder). Note that iPhoto will automatically launch by itself if your
camera or media card reader is recognized. Thumbnails of the images on
your camera or card reader appear in the iPhoto window, and the
bottom of the window displays the Import text fields and buttons.
The first time that you launch iPhoto, you have the option of setting its
auto-launch feature. I recommend this feature, which starts iPhoto auto-
matically whenever you connect a camera to your iMac.
3. Click in the Event Name field at the bottom of the window and type an
event name for the imported photos, such as Birthday Party or Godzilla
Ravages Tokyo.
Keep in mind that the images you’re seeing on your screen haven’t actu-
ally been copied over to your iMac yet — the photos are still on your
camera or card reader.
4. Click in the Description box and type a description for the event.
5. To allow iPhoto to automatically separate images into events based on
the date they were taken, select the Autosplit Events after Importing
check box to enable it.
If you want to keep all these photos in a single event — even though the
event spans multiple days — leave the Autosplit Events After Importing
check box disabled.
6. Click the Import button to import your photographs from the camera.
The images are added to your Photo Library, where you can organize
them into individual albums or Events.
To select specific images to import, hold down the Ô key and click each
desired photo. Then click Import Selectedrather than Import All.

7. Specify whether the images you’re importing should be deleted from
the camera afterward.
If you don’t expect to download these images to another computer or
another device, you can choose to delete the photos from your camera
automatically by clicking Delete Originals. This saves you a step and
helps eliminate the guilt that can crop up when you nix your pix. (Sorry,
I couldn’t resist.)
If you prefer to keep your images on your camera as a safeguard, click
the Keep Originals button. Nothing’s deleted, and you can delete the
photos later by using your camera’s built-in delete feature.
“What’s that about an Event, Mark?” After you download the contents of your
digital camera, those contents count as a virtual Event in iPhoto, based on
the date they were taken. For example, you can always display the last
images you imported by clicking Last Import. If you want to see photos from
your son’s graduation, they appear as a separate Event. (Both of these organi-
zational tools will appear in the source list). Think about that . . . it’s pretty
tough to arrange old-fashioned film prints by the moment in time that they
document, but iPhoto makes it easy for you to see just which photos are part
of the same group! I’ll explain more about Events in the next section.
Organize mode: Organizing 
and sorting your images
In the days of film prints, you could always stuff another shoebox with your
latest photos or buy another sticky album to expand your library. Your digital
camera, though, stores images as files instead, and many folks don’t print
their digital photographs. Instead, you can keep your entire collection of digi-
tal photographs and scanned images well ordered and easily retrieved in
183
Chapter 12: The Masterpiece That Is iPhoto
Importing images from your hard drive
If you have a folder of images that you collected
on your hard drive, a CD, a DVD, an external
drive, or a USB Flash drive, adding them to your
library is easy. Just drag the folder from a Finder
window and drop it into the source list in the
iPhoto window. iPhoto automatically creates a
new album using the folder name, and you can
sit back while the images are imported into that
new album. iPhoto recognizes images in several
formats: JPEG, GIF, RAW, PNG, PICT, and TIFF.
You can drag individual images as well. Select
the images in a Finder window and then drag
them into the desired album in the source list.
To add them to the album displayed in the
Viewer, drag the selected photos and drop them
in the Viewer instead.
If you’d rather import images via a standard
Mac Open dialog box, choose File➪Import to
Library. Simplicity strikes again!

iPhoto organize mode. Then you can display them as a slideshow, print them
to your system printer, use them as Desktop backgrounds, or burn them to
an archive disc.
The two methods of organizing photos are the album, which you might be
familiar with from older versions of iPhoto; and Events, which is new in
iPhoto ’08.
A new kind of photo album
The key to organizing images in iPhoto is the album. Each album can repre-
sent any division you like, be it a year, a vacation, your daughter, or your
daughter’s ex-boyfriends. Follow these steps:
1. Create a new album.
Choose File➪New Album or click the plus (+) button at the bottom of the
source list. The New Album sheet appears, as shown in Figure 12-2.
2. Type the name for your new photo album.
If you want to create an empty album (without using any images that
might be selected), make sure you deselect the Use Selected Items in
New Album check box to disable it.
Figure 12-2:
Add a new
album in
iPhoto.
184
Part IV: Living the iLife 

3. Click Create.
iPhoto also offers a special type of album — a Smart Album — which you can
create from the File menu. A Smart Album contains only photos that match
certain criteria that you choose, using the keywords and rating that you
assign to your images. Other criteria include recent film rolls, text within
photo filenames, dates when the images were added to iPhoto, and any com-
ments you might have added. Now here’s the really nifty angle: iPhoto auto-
matically builds and maintains Smart Albums for you, adding new photos
that match the criteria (and deleting those that you remove from your Photo
Library)! Smart Albums carry a gear icon in the source list.
You can display information about the selected item in the information panel
under the source list. Just click the Show Information button at the bottom of
the iPhoto window, which sports the familiar i-in-a-circle logo. You can also
type a short note or description in the Description box that appears in the
Information pane. For more in-depth information, select the desired item and
then press Ô+I.
You can also change information on an image by selecting it in the Viewer and
clicking the Show Information button. Click on any of the headings in the
pane (Title, Date and Time) to display a text edit box. Then simply click in
the box to make your edits: Type in a new name, for example, or alter the
photo’s date stamp.
You can drag images from the Viewer into any album you choose. For exam-
ple, you can copy an image to another album by dragging it from the Viewer
to the desired album in the Source list.
To remove an album photo that has fallen out of favor, follow these steps:
1. In the Source list, select the desired album.
2. In the Viewer, select the photo (click it) that you want to remove.
3. Press Delete.
When you remove a photo from an album, you don’t actually remove the photo
from your collection (which is represented by the Photos entry under the
Library heading in the source list). That’s because an album is just a group of
links to the images in your collection. To completely remove the offending
photo, click the Photos entry under the Library heading to display your
entire collection of images and delete the picture there, too.
To remove an entire album from the source list, just click it in the source list
to select it — in the Viewer, you can see the images that it contains — and
then press Delete.
185
Chapter 12: The Masterpiece That Is iPhoto

To rename an album, click the entry under the Albums heading in the Source
list to select it, and then click again to display a text box. Type the new album
name and then press Return.
Change your mind? Daughter’s ex is back in the picture, so to speak? iPhoto
comes complete with a handy-dandy Undo feature. Just press Ô+Z, and it’s
like your last action never happened. (A great trick for those moments when
you realize you just deleted your only image of your first car from your
Library.)
Arranging stuff by Events
As I mention earlier, Events are essentially a group of images that you shot at
the same time. iPhoto figures that those images belong together (which is
usually a pretty safe assumption). Figure 12-3 illustrates the Events that I 
created in my iPhoto collection.
Like an album, an Event can be renamed just by using a different procedure.
Click the Events entry under the Library heading in the Source list to display
your Events in the Viewer, and then click the existing Event name in the cap-
tion underneath the thumbnail. A text box appears in which you can type a
new name. Then press Return to update the Event.
Figure 12-3:
Events help
you organize 
by what
happened,
not when it
happened.
186
Part IV: Living the iLife 

Try moving your mouse cursor over an Event thumbnail in the Viewer, and
you’ll see that iPhoto displays the date range when the images were taken as
well as the total number of images in the Event. Ah, but things get really cool
when you move your mouse cursor back and forth over an Event with many
images. The thumbnail animates and displaysall the images in the Event,
without using old-fashioned scroll bars or silly arrows! (Why can’t I think of
this stuff? This is the future, dear readers.)
To display the contents of an Event in the Viewer, just double-click the Event
thumbnail. To return to the Events thumbnails, click the All Events button at
the top of the Viewer.
Decided to merge those Prom Event pictures with your daughter’s Graduation
Event? No problem! You could drag one Event thumbnail on top of another,
but that’s the easy way. Alternatively, click the Events entry under the
Library heading in the Source list to display your Events and then hold down
Ô while you click the Events that you want to merge. Click the Merge button
in the toolbar at the bottom of the window, or choose Events➪Merge Events.
(Forgot about that menu bar, didn’t you?) Click Merge in the confirmation
dialog that appears.
While you’re organizing, you can create a brand-new empty Event by choos-
ing Events➪Create Event. Feel free to drag photos from albums, other Events,
or your Photo library into your new Event.
Organizing with keywords
“Okay, Mark, iPhoto albums and Events are great ideas, but do you really
expect me to look through 20 albums just to locate pictures with specific
people or places?” Never fear, good iMac owner. You can also assign descrip-
tive keywords to images to help you organize your collection and locate cer-
tain pictures fast. iPhoto comes with a number of standard keywords, and
you can create your own as well.
To illustrate, suppose you’d like to identify your images according to special
events in your family. Birthday photos should have their own keyword, and
anniversaries deserve another. By assigning keywords, you can search for
Elsie’s sixth birthday or your silver wedding anniversary (no matter what
Event or album they’re in), and all related photos with those keywords appear
like magic! (Well, almost like magic. You need to choose View➪Keywords,
which toggles the Keyword display on and off in the Viewer.)
iPhoto includes a number of keywords that are already available:
 Favorite
 Family
 Kids
187
Chapter 12: The Masterpiece That Is iPhoto

 Vacation
 Birthday
 Checkmark
What’s the Checkmark all about, you ask? It’s a special case. Adding this key-
word displays a tiny check mark icon in the bottom-right corner of the image.
The Checkmark keyword comes in handy for temporarily identifying specific
images because you can search for just your check-marked photos.
To assign keywords to images (or remove keywords that have already been
assigned), select one or more photos in the Viewer. Choose Window➪Show
Keywords or press Ô+K to display the Keywords window, as shown in 
Figure 12-4.
Click the keyword buttons that you want to attach to the selected images to
mark them. Or, click the highlighted keyword buttons that you want to remove
from the selected images to disable them.
Figure 12-4:
Time to add
keywords 
to these
selected

188
Part IV: Living the iLife 

Digging through your library with keywords
Behold the power of keywords! To sift through your entire collection of images
by keywords, click the magnifying glass button next to the Search box at the
bottom of the iPhoto window and then choose Keyword from the pop-up
menu. iPhoto displays a pop-up Keywords panel, and you can click one or
more keyword buttons to display just the photos that carry those keywords.
The images that remain in the Viewer after a search must have all the key-
words that you specified. For example, if an image is identified by only three
of four keywords you chose, it isn’t a match and won’t appear in the Viewer.
To search for a photo by title, or by words in its description (which you can
add by clicking the Info button at the lower-left corner of the window), just
click in the Search box and start typing. You can also click that same magnify-
ing glass by the Search box to search through your images by date and rating
as well. (And speaking of ratings. . . .)
Playing favorites by assigning ratings
Be your own critic! iPhoto allows you to assign any photo a rating of anywhere
from zero to five stars. I use this system to help me keep track of the images
that I feel are the best in my library. Select one (or more) image and then
assign a rating by using one of the following methods:
 Choose Photos➪My Rating and then choose the desired rating from the
pop-up submenu.
 Use the Ô+0 (for your average snapshot) through Ô+5 (front-page mate-
rial) shortcuts.
189
Chapter 12: The Masterpiece That Is iPhoto
You’re gonna need your own keywords
I’ll bet you take photos of other things besides
just kids and vacations — and that’s why iPhoto
allows you to create your own keywords. Display
the iPhoto Keywords window by pressing Ô+K,
click the Edit Keywords button in the toolbar, and
then click Add (the button with the plus sign).
iPhoto adds a new unnamed keyword to the list
as an edit box, ready for you to type its name.
You can rename an existing keyword from this
same window, too. Click a keyword to select it
and then click Rename. Remember, however,
that renaming a keyword affects all the images
that were tagged with that keyword. That might
be confusing when, for example, photos origi-
nally tagged as Family suddenly appear with the
keyword Foodstuffs. To remove an existing key-
word from the list, click the keyword to select it
and then click the Delete button, which bears a
minus sign.

Sorting your images just so
The View menu provides an easy way to arrange your images in the Viewer
by a number of different criteria. Choose View➪Sort Photos and then click
the desired sort criteria from the pop-up submenu. You can arrange the dis-
play by date, keyword, title, or rating. If you select an album in the source
list, you can also choose to arrange photos manually, which means that you
can drag and drop thumbnails in the Viewer to place them in the precise
order you want them.
Naturally, iPhoto allows you to print selected images, but you can also send
photos directly to iWeb for use on your .Mac Web site. Click the iWeb button
in the toolbar and choose either a Photo page or a Blog page. iPhoto auto-
matically sends the selected images or album to iWeb and launches the appli-
cation! You can also use the iPhoto Web Gallery feature to get your photos on
the Web. (Find more on the Web Gallery at the end of this chapter.)
Edit mode: Removing and 
fixing stuff the right way
Not every digital image is perfect. Just look at my collection if you need proof.
For those shots that need a pixel massage, iPhoto includes a number of edit-
ing tools that you can use to correct common problems.
The first step in any editing job is to select the image you want to fix in the
Viewer. Then click the Edit button on the iPhoto toolbar to switch to the Edit
panel controls, as shown in Figure 12-5. Now you’re ready to fix problems,
using the tools that I discuss in the rest of this section. (If you’re editing a
photo that’s part of an Event or an album, note the spiffy scrolling photo 
strip at the top, which allows you to switch to another image to edit just by
clicking.)
Rotating tipped-over shots
If an image is in the wrong orientation and needs to be turned to display cor-
rectly, click the Rotate button to turn it once in a counterclockwise direction.
Hold down the Option key while you click the Rotate button to rotate in a
clockwise direction.
Crop ’til you drop
Does that photo have an intruder hovering around the edges of the subject?
You can remove some of the border by cropping an image, just like folks once
did with film prints and a pair of scissors. (We’ve come a long way.) With
iPhoto, you can remove unwanted portions of an image, which is a great way
to get Uncle Milton’s stray head (complete with toupee) out of an otherwise
perfect holiday snapshot.
190
Part IV: Living the iLife 

Follow these steps to crop an image:
1. Click the Crop button in the Edit panel.
2. Select the portion of the image that you want to keep.
In the Viewer, click and drag the handles on the square to outline the
part of the image that you want. Remember, whatever’s outside this rec-
tangle disappears after the crop is completed.
When you drag a corner or edge of the outline, a semiopaque grid (famil-
iar to amateur and professional photographers as the nine squares from
the Rule of Three) appears to help you visualize what you’re claiming.
(Check it out in Figure 12-6.)
3. (Optional) Choose a preset aspect ratio.
If you want to force your cropped selection to a specific aspect ratio —
such as 4 x 3 for an iDVD project — select the Constrain check box and
then select the size from the Constrain pop-up menu.
4. Click the Apply button.
Oh, and don’t forget that you can use iPhoto’s Undo feature if you mess
up and need to try again — just press Ô+Z.
Figure 12-5:

Chapter 12: The Masterpiece That Is iPhoto

iPhoto features multiple Undo levels, so you can press Ô+Z several times to
travel back through your last several changes.
Enhancing images to add pizzazz
If a photo looks washed out, click the Enhance button to increase (or decrease)
the color saturation and improve the contrast. Enhance is automatic, so you
don’t have to set anything.
Removing rampant red-eye
Unfortunately, today’s digital cameras can still produce the same “zombies
with red eyeballs” as traditional film cameras. Red-eye is caused by a camera’s
flash reflecting off the retinas of a subject’s eyes, and it can occur with both
humans and pets.
iPhoto can remove that red-eye to turn frightening zombies back into your
family and friends. Click the Red-Eye button and then select a demonized eye-
ball by clicking in the center of it. To complete the process, click the X in the
button that appears in the image.
Figure 12-6:

Part IV: Living the iLife 

Retouching like the stars
The iPhoto Retouch feature is perfect for removing minor flecks or lines in an
image (especially those images from scanned prints). Click Retouch, and the
mouse cursor turns into a crosshair. Just drag the cursor across the imper-
fection. (Actually, you’re matching the pixels in the selected area with the
pixels surrounding it, which “smooths” out the imperfection.)
Switching to black and white, or sepia
Ever wonder whether a particular photo in your library would look better as
a black-and-white (grayscale) print? Or perhaps an old-fashioned sepia tone
in shades of copper and brown? Just click the Effects button to convert an
image from color to shades of gray or shades of brown, respectively. (To return
to the original image, just click in the center square of the Effects window.)
Adjusting brightness and contrast manually
Click Adjust to perform manual adjustments on brightness and contrast (the
light levels in your image). To adjust the brightness and contrast, make sure
that nothing’s selected in the image and then drag the Brightness/Contrast
sliders until the image looks the way that you want.
While you’re editing, you can use the Next button to move to the next image in
the current album (and the Previous button to revert to the previous image).
Producing Your Own Coffee-Table
Masterpiece
Book mode unleashes what I think is probably the coolest feature of iPhoto:
the chance to design and print a high-quality, bound photo book! After you
complete an album — all the images have been edited just the way you want,
and the album contains all the photos you want to include in your book —
iPhoto can send your images as data over the Internet to a company that
prints and binds your finished book for you. (No, they don’t publish For
Dummies titles, but then again, I don’t get high-resolution color plates in most
of my books, either.)
At the time of this writing, you can order many different sizes and bindings,
including an 81⁄2 x 11" softcover book with 20 double-sided pages for about
$20 and a hardbound 81⁄2 x 11" keepsake album with 10 double-sided pages 
for about $30 (shipping included for both). Extra pages can be added for 
70 cents and $1 per pop, respectively.
193
Chapter 12: The Masterpiece That Is iPhoto

iPhoto ’08 can also produce and automatically order calendars and greeting
cards, using a process similar to the one I describe in this section for produc-
ing a book. Who needs that stationery store in the mall anymore?
If you’re going to create a photo book, make sure that the images have the
highest quality and highest resolution. The higher the resolution, the better
the photos look in the finished book. I personally always try to use images
with more than 1,000 pixels in both the vertical and horizontal dimensions.
Check your camera’s manual for instructions on how to choose the maximum
quality and resolution settings.
To create a photo book, follow these steps:
1. Click the desired album in the source list to select it.
2. Click the Book toolbar button.
3. Select the size of the book and a theme.
Your choices determine the number of pages and layout scheme, as well
as the background graphics for each page.
4. Click Choose.
iPhoto displays a dialog box indicating that you can lay out your photos
manually or allow iPhoto to do everything automatically (by clicking the
Autoflow button on the toolbar). Automatic mode is fine, but I’m a thor-
ough guy, so I’ll lay out this book manually. You see the controls shown
in Figure 12-7.
In Book mode, the Viewer changes in subtle ways. It displays the current
page at the bottom of the display and adds a scrolling row of thumbnail
images above it. This row of images represents the remaining images
from the selected album that you can add to your book. You can drag
any image thumbnail into one of the photo placeholders to add it to the
page. You can also click the Page button at the left of the thumbnail strip
— it looks like a page with a turned-down corner — to display thumb-
nails of each page in your book. (To return to the album image strip,
click the Photos button under the Page button.)
5. Rearrange the page order to suit you by dragging the thumbnail of
any page from one location to another in the strip.
6. In the Book toolbar below the page view, you can adjust a variety of
settings for the final book, including the book’s theme, background,
page numbers, and text fonts.
At this point, you can also add captions and short descriptions (about a
dozen words) to the pages of your photo album. Click any one of the
text boxes in the page display and begin typing to add text to that page.
7. When you’re ready to publish your book, click the Buy Book button.
194
Part IV: Living the iLife 

8. In a series of dialog boxes that appear, iPhoto guides you through the
final steps to order a bound book.
Note that you’re asked for credit card information
I wouldn’t attempt to order a book through a dialup modem connection. The
images are likely far too large to be sent successfully. If possible, use a broad-
band or network connection to the Internet while you’re ordering. If your
only connection to the Internet is through a dialup modem, I recommend
saving your book in PDF format and having it printed at a copy shop or print-
ing service instead. (Choose File➪Print and then click the Save as PDF
button.)
Introducing Web Gallery!
iPhoto ’08 introduces a new feature — Web Gallery — that does for images
what podcasting does for audio: You can share your photos with friends,
family, business clients, and anyone else with an Internet connection! (Your
adoring public doesn’t even require a Mac; they can use That Other Kind of
Computer.) iPhoto automatically uploads the selected images and leads you
through the process of creating a new Web page to proudly display your
Figure 12-7:

photos. However, you must be a .Mac subscriber to use the Web Gallery fea-
ture. If you haven’t heard the news on the Apple .Mac service yet, see
Chapter 9 for the details.
To create a Web Gallery, you designate one or more albums to share by select-
ing them in the source list and then clicking the Add button at the bottom left
of the iPhoto window. (Hold down Ô while you click to select multiple albums.)
Click the Web Gallery toolbar button in the sheet that appears to display the
Web Gallery settings, as shown in Figure 12-8.
196
Part IV: Living the iLife 
I really need a slideshow
You can use iPhoto to create slideshows! Click
the album you want to display. Click the Add
button to display the Add sheet. Choose
Slideshow from the sheet toolbar, and then click
Create; iPhoto adds a Slideshow item in the
Source list. The same scrolling thumbnail strip
appears at the top of the Viewer — this time,
displaying the images in the album. Click and
drag the thumbnails so that they appear in the
desired order.
The toolbar at the bottom of the iPhoto window
now displays slideshow-specific buttons. (Go
figure.) To choose background music for your
slideshow, click the Music button in the
Slideshow toolbar to display the tracks and
playlists from your iTunes library. Choose a
single track or a playlist to select it, and then
click OK to accept your music.
By default, iPhoto uses a familiar dissolve effect
during the transitions between photos — how-
ever, click the Transition pop-up menu, and you
can choose from a number of alternate transi-
tions. Select Random from the menu to use a
different transition between every photo, or turn
off transitions altogether by choosing None.
To configure your slideshow, click the Settings
button in the Slideshow toolbar. In the sheet that
appears, you can specify the amount of time
that each slide remains on the screen, as well
as an optional title and rating displays. I can
recommend the Automatic Ken Burns effect —
yep, the same one as in iMovie — which lends
an animated movement to each image. Savvy
iMac owners (like yourself) appreciate the
Slideshow Format pop-up menu, which allows
you to choose a 16:9 widescreen display for
your slideshow.
Click the Adjust button to modify the settings for
a specific slide (useful for keeping a slide
onscreen for a longer period of time or for set-
ting a different transition than the default tran-
sition you choose from the Slideshow toolbar).
To display a preview of a single slide and its
transitions, click the desired slide and then click
Preview. This is a handy way of determining
whether your delay and transition settings are
really what you want for a particular slide.
When you’re ready to play your slideshow, click
the Play button, and iPhoto switches to full-
screen mode. You can share your completed
slideshow by clicking Share in the iPhoto menu,
from which you can send the slideshow to iDVD
(for later burning onto a DVD), export it as a
QuickTime movie, or send it through e-mail.

Type a name for your new Web Gallery. You can elect to show the title of each
photo, allow your visitors to download your images or upload their own, and
even allow photos to be uploaded by other Mac owners using Apple Mail!
By default, any visitor to your .Mac Web site can see your gallery. But what if
you prefer a little security for those images? In that case, click the Album
Viewable By pop-up menu, where you can limit your viewing audience. (You
can even require that your visitors enter a login name and password before
they can receive your photos.)
Click Publish, and you see that iPhoto indicates your images are being up-
loaded with a cool twirling progress icon to the right of the album in the source
list. When the process is complete, iPhoto indicates that the album is being
“photocasted” with a special networky-looking icon to the right of the album,
and even a new Web Gallery heading in the Source list. You’re on the air!
Now for the other side of the coin: By selecting your Web Gallery in the Source
list and clicking Tell a Friend in the iPhoto toolbar, iPhoto automatically pre-
pares an e-mail message in Apple Mail that announces your new Web Gallery!
Just add the recipient names and click Send. This spiffy message includes
instructions for

Chapter 12: The Masterpiece That Is iPhoto

 Folks using iPhoto ’08 on a Mac: As you can imagine, this is the easiest
Receive option to configure. After these folks are subscribed, they get an
automatically updated album of the same name that appears in their
source list, and they can use those images in their own iPhoto projects.
From within iPhoto, your visitors can subscribe to your Web Gallery by
choosing File➪Subscribe to Photo Feed and entering the subscription
URL from the e-mail message.
 Folks using Windows or an older version of iPhoto: These subscribers
can use any Web browser with really simple syndication (RSS) support
(like the Safari browser that comes with Leopard) or any RSS reader. 
(In effect, your Web Gallery becomes an RSS feed for those without
iPhoto ’08.)
By default, any changes you make to the contents of the albums in your Web
Gallery are updated automatically on your .Mac account, and in turn, are
updated automatically to everyone who receives your images. You can turn
this feature off, however, if you have a large number of images and you update
often (which can result in your sister’s computer downloading a lot of data).
To display the Check for New Photos setting for Web Gallery, choose iPhoto➪
Preferences and then click the Web Gallery button on the Preferences
window toolbar. (You can also change the title for your Gallery and monitor
your iDisk usage from this pane.)
Mailing Photos to Aunt Mildred
iPhoto can help you send your images through e-mail by automating the
process. The application can prepare your image and embed it automatically
in a new message.
To send an image through e-mail, select it and then click the Email button in
the toolbar. The dialog shown in Figure 12-9 appears, allowing you to choose
the size of the images and whether you want to include their titles and com-
ments as well.
Keep in mind that most Internet service provider (ISP) e-mail servers don’t
accept an e-mail message that’s larger than 1MB or 2MB, so watch that Size
display. If you’re trying to send a number of images and the size goes over
2MB, you might have to click the Size pop-up menu and choose a smaller size
(reducing the image resolution) to get them all embedded in a single message.
When you’re satisfied with the total file size and you’re ready to create your
message, click the Compose button. iPhoto automatically launches Apple
Mail (or whatever e-mail application you specify) and creates a new message
containing the images, ready for you to click Send!

R
emember those home movies that you used to make in high school? They
were entertaining and fun to create, and your friends were impressed. In
fact, some kids are so downright inspired that you’re not surprised when you
discover at your high school reunion that they turn out to be graphic artists,
or they’re involved in video or TV production.
iMovie, part of the iLife ’08 suite, makes moviemaking as easy as those home-
made movies. Apple simplified all the technical stuff, such as importing video
and adding audio, leaving you free to concentrate on your creative ideas. In
fact, you won’t find techy terms such as codecs or keyframes in this chapter
at all. I guarantee that you’ll understand what’s going on at all times. (How
often do you get a promise like that with video editing software?)
With iMovie, your digital video (DV) camcorder, and the other parts of the
iLife suite, you can soon produce and share professional-looking movies, with
some of the same creative transitions and titles used by Those Hollywood
Types every single day.
If you turn out to be a world-famous Hollywood Type Director in a decade or
so, don’t forget the little people along the way!
Shaking Hands with the iMovie Window
If you’ve ever tried a professional-level, video editing application, you proba-
bly felt like you were suddenly dropped in the cockpit of a jumbo jet. In
iMovie, though, all the controls you need are easy to use and logically placed.

Video editing takes up quite a bit of desktop space. In fact, you can’t run
iMovie at resolutions less than 1024 x 768, nor would you want to.
To launch iMovie, click the iMovie icon on the Dock. (It looks like a star from
Hollywood’s Walk of Fame, which I find very fitting.) You can also click the
Application folder in any Finder window Sidebar and then double-click 
the iMovie icon.
To follow the examples that I show you here, follow these strenuous steps
and create a new movie project:
1. Click the Create a New Project button (the one with the plus sign)
located under the Project Library list.
iMovie displays the window that you see in Figure 13-1.
2. Type a name for your project.
3. Select the aspect ratio (or screen dimensions) for your movie.
You can select a widescreen display (16:9), a standard display (4:3), or a
display especially suited for an iPhone (3:2). If compatibility with the
familiar SDTV format is important, I always recommend that you choose
the standard (4:3) ratio.

4. Click Create.
You’re on your way! Check out Figure 13-2: This is the whole enchilada,
in one window.
Here are the controls and displays that you’ll use most often:
 Monitor: Think of this as being just like your TV or computer monitor.
Your video clips, still images, and finished movie play here.
 Browser toolbar: This row of buttons allows you to switch between
your media clips (video clips, photos, and audio) and the various tools
that you use to make your film. The selected items fill the browser pane
below the toolbar. For example, Figure 13-2 illustrates the Transitions
pane, which appears when you click the Transitions Browser button 
(go figure).
 Event pane: All the video clips that you use to create your movie are
stored in the Event pane.

 Project pane: In this pane, iMovie displays the elements that you add to
your movie project.
 Playhead: The red vertical line that you see in the Event and the Project
panes is the playhead, which indicates the current editing point while
you’re creating your movie. When you’re playing your movie, the play-
head moves to follow your progress through the movie.
 Editing toolbar: This strip of buttons allows you to control editing func-
tions such as cropping, audio and video adjustments, voiceovers, and
selecting items.
 Camera Import button: Click this switch to import DV clips from your
DV camcorder or iSight camera.
Those are the major highlights of the iMovie window. A director’s chair and
megaphone are optional, of course, but they do add to the mood.
A Bird’s-Eye View of Moviemaking
I don’t want to box in your creative skills here — after all, you can attack the
moviemaking process from a number of angles. (Pun unfortunately intended.)
However, I’ve found that my movies turn out the best when I follow a linear
process, so before I dive into specifics, allow me to provide you with an
overview of moviemaking with iMovie.
Here’s my take on the process, reduced to seven steps:
1. Import your video clips into iMovie, directly from your DV camcorder,
your iSight camera, or your hard drive.
2. Drag your new selection of clips from the Event pane to the Project pane
and arrange them in the desired order.
3. Import or record audio clips (from iTunes; GarageBand; or external
sources, such as audio CDs or audio files you recorded) and add them 
to your movie.
4. Import your photos (directly from iPhoto or from your hard drive) and
place them where needed in your movie.
5. Add professional niceties — such as audio, transitions, effects, and text —
to the project.
6. Preview your film and edit it further if necessary.
7. Share your finished film with others through the Web, e-mail, or a DVD
that you create and burn with iDVD.
204
Part IV: Living the iLife 

That’s the first step-by-step procedure in this chapter. I doubt that you’ll even
need to refer to it, however, because you’ll soon see just how easy it is to use
iMovie.
Importing the Building Blocks
Sure, you need video clips to create a movie of your own, but don’t panic if
you have but a short supply. You can certainly turn to the other iLife applica-
tions for additional raw material. (See, I told you that integration thing would
come in handy.)
Along with video clips you import from your DV camcorder, iSight camera,
and hard drive, you can also call on iPhoto for still images (think credits) and
iTunes for background audio and effects. In this section, I show you how.
Pulling in video clips
Your iMac is equipped already with the two extras that come in handy for
video editing: namely, a large hard drive and a FireWire port. Because virtu-
ally all DV camcorders today use a FireWire connection to transfer clips,
you’re all set. (And even if your snazzy new DV camcorder uses a USB 2.0
connection, you’re still in the zone! ) Oh, and of course your iMac has an
iSight camera on board, so you’re a self-contained movie studio!
Here’s the drill if your clips are on your DV camcorder:
1. Plug the proper cable into your Mac.
2. Set the DV camcorder to VTR (or VCR) mode.
Some camcorders call this Play mode.
3. Click the Camera Import button (labeled in Figure 13-2).
iMovie opens a new window.
4. Click the Camera pop-up menu and select your DV camcorder or
iSight camera.
Playback controls appear under the Camera Import window, mirroring
the controls on your DV camcorder. This allows you to control the unit
from iMovie. Keen! You also get Import All and Import Checked buttons
as a bonus.
205
Chapter 13: Making Film History with iMovie

5. To import selected clips, set the Automatic/Manual switch to Manual.
To import all clips, set the Automatic/Manual switch to Automatic, and
click Import All.
6. Select the check boxes next to the clips that you don’t want to import
to disable them.
7. Click the Import Checked button.
8. Click the Save To pop-up menu and choose the drive that should store
your clips.
You can choose to add the new clips to an existing Event, or create a
new Event. Heck, if the Event spanned more than one day, you can
create a new Event for each day. (How do they think up these things?)
9. Click OK and admire your handiwork.
iMovie begins transferring the footage to your Mac and automatically
adds the imported clips to your Event Library. Note that the footage
remains pristine on your camera, and is not deleted.
If your clips are already on your hard drive, rest assured that iMovie can
import them, including those in high-definition video (HDV) format. iMovie
also recognizes a number of other video formats, as shown in Table 13-1.

To import a movie file, follow this bouncing ball:
1. Choose File➪Import Movies.
2. If you’re importing 1080i video clips, choose the quality setting.
The Large setting (960 x 540 resolution) will save you a significant amount
of hard drive space. (If you’re not importing 1080i video, use the default
Large setting and click OK.)
206
Part IV: Living the iLife 

If you are indeed importing 1080i (HD, or high definition) video and you
want to take advantage of the whopping 1920 x 1080 resolution it pro-
vides, choose the Full setting. (And prepare to lose a nice-sized patch of
free space on your hard drive!)
3. Click the Save To pop-up menu and choose the drive that should store
your clips.
4. Specify whether you want to add the imported video to an existing
Event, or whether you’d like to create a new Event.
If you want to add the video to an existing Event, click the pop-up menu
and choose an Event.
5. Specify whether you want to copy the video (leaving the original movie
intact), or whether the original movie should be deleted after a suc-
cessful import.
6. Click Import.
Alternatively, you can also drag a video clip from a Finder window and
drop it in the Project pane.
Making use of still images
Still images come in handy as impressive-looking titles or as ending credits to
your movie. (Make sure you list a gaffer and a best boy to be truly profes-
sional.) However, you can also use still images to introduce scenes or to sepa-
rate clips according to your whim. For example, I use stills when delineating
the days of a vacation within a movie or different Christmas celebrations
over time.
Here are two methods of adding stills to your movie:
 Adding images from iPhoto: Click the Photo Browser button on the
Browser toolbar (or press Ô+2), and you’ll experience the thrill that is
your iPhoto library, right from iMovie (as shown in Figure 13-3). You can
elect to display your entire iPhoto library or more selective picks, such
as specific albums or Events. When you find the image you want to add,
just drag it to the right spot in the Project pane.
 Importing images from your hard drive: If you’re a member of the
International Drag-and-Drop society, you can drag TIFF, JPEG, GIF, PICT,
PNG, and PSD images directly from a Finder window and drop them into
the Project pane as well.
207
Chapter 13: Making Film History with iMovie

Importing and adding audio 
from all sorts of places
You can pull in everything from Wagner to Weezer as both background music
and sound effects for your movie. In this section, I focus on how to get those
notes into iMovie and then how to add them to your movie by dragging them
to the Project pane.
You can add audio from a number of sources:
 Adding songs from iTunes: Click the Show Music and Sound Effects
button on the Browser toolbar (or press Ô+1) to display the contents of
your iTunes library. Click the desired playlist in the scrolling list, like the
Dinah Washington playlist I selected in Figure 13-4. (If you’ve exported
any original music you composed in GarageBand to your iTunes Library,
you can use those songs in your own movie!) You can add a track to your
movie by dragging the song entry from the Music and Sound Effects
browser to the desired spot in the Project pane.
Figure 13-3:
Pulling still

208
Part IV: Living the iLife 

 Adding sound effects: Yep, if you need the sound of a horse galloping
for your Rocky Mountain vacation clips, click the Show Music and Sound
Effects button and then click either the iMovie ’08 Sound Effects or iLife
Sound Effects folders at the top of the scrolling list. To add a sound
effect, drag it to the perfect spot in the Project pane.
If you have several gigabytes of music in your iTunes Library, it might be
more of a challenge to locate “Me and Bobby McGee” by Janis Joplin,
especially if she’s included in a compilation. Let your Mac do the digging
for you! Click in the Search box below the track list and begin typing a
song name. iMovie narrows down the song titles displayed to those that
match the characters you type. To reset the search box and display all
your songs in the library or selected playlist, click the X icon that appears
to the right of the box.
 Ripping songs from an audio CD: Load an audio CD and then choose
Audio CD from the scrolling list. iMovie displays the tracks from the CD,
and you can add them at the current playhead position the same way
that you would an iTunes songs.
 Recording directly from a microphone: Yep, if you’re thinking voiceover
narration, you’ve hit the nail on the head. Check out the sidebar,
“Narration the easy way,” for the scoop.

Chapter 13: Making Film History with iMovie

You can fine-tune both the audio within a video clip or the audio clips that
you add to your project. With the desired clip selected, click the Adjust
Audio button on the Editing toolbar. The Audio Adjustments window that
appears includes an array of audio controls that allow you to change the
volume of the selected clip, or give that audio priority over other audio play-
ing simultaneously (such as a sound effect that needs to be clearly heard
over background music and the video clip).
If your clips dramatically vary in volume, follow along:
1. Click the Normalize Clip Volume button.
2. Select each clip that you want to set to the same volume.
3. Click Normalize Clip Volume again for each clip.
210
Part IV: Living the iLife 
Narration the easy way
Ready to create that award-winning nature doc-
umentary? You can add voiceover narration to
your iMovie project that would make Jacques
Cousteau proud. In fact, you can record your
voice while you watch your movie playing, allow-
ing perfect synchronization with the action! To
add narration, follow these steps:
1. Click the Voiceover button on the Editing
toolbar — it sports a microphone icon —
to open the Voiceover window.
2. Click the Record From pop-up menu and
select the input device.
Your iMac sports a decent internal micro-
phone, but you can always add a USB
microphone to your system.
3. Drag the input volume slider to a comfort-
able level.
You can monitor the volume level of your
voice with the left and right input meters.
Try to keep the meters at 50% or so for the
proper volume level.
4. To block out ambient noise levels around
you, drag the Noise Reduction slider to the
right if necessary.
If you’d like iMovie to enhance your voice
electronically for a more professional sound,
select the Voice Enhancement check box. If
you need to hear the audio from your movie
project while you speak, select the Play
Project Audio While Recording check box.
Note, however, that you need to listen to the
audio while using a set of headphones
(plugged into your iMac’s headphone jack)
to avoid feedback problems.
5. Click in the desired spot within the Project
pane where the narration should begin.
6. Begin speaking when prompted by iMovie.
7. Watch the video while you narrate so that
you can coordinate your narration track
with the action.
8. Click anywhere in the iMovie window to
stop recording.
iMovie adds a purple icon to the Project pane
underneath the video with the voiceover.
9. Click the Close button in the Voiceover
window.

4. When you’re done tweaking, click Done.
You can always return the clip to its original volume. Just open this
window again and click Revert to Original.
Building the Cinematic Basics
Time to dive in and add the building blocks to create your movie. Along with
video clips, audio tracks, and still images, you can add Hollywood-quality
transitions, optical effects, and animated text titles. In this section, I demon-
strate how to elevate your collection of video clips into a real-life furshlug-
giner movie.
Adding clips to your movie
You can add clips to your movie by using the Project pane and the Event
pane. The Dynamic Duo work like this:
 Project pane: This pane displays the media you added to your project,
allowing you to rearrange the clips, titles, transitions, and still images in
your movie.
 Event pane: This pane displays your video clips arranged by Event (the
date they were shot), acting as the source repository for all your clips.
Movies pulled into iMovie, imported to iPhoto, or added manually from
the Finder appear here.
To add a clip to your movie
1. Move your mouse pointer across clips in the Event pane to watch a
preview of the video.
The clip’s thumbnail actually displays the video in real time as you move
your pointer across it. Nice.
2. When you decide what to add to your project, you can add the entire
clip or a selection:
• To select an entire clip: Right-click the clip thumbnail and choose
Select Entire Clip from the menu that appears.
• To select a portion of a clip: Drag your mouse cursor across the
thumbnail. A yellow frame appears around your selection. 
To change the length of the selected video, drag the handles that
appear on either side. If you make a mistake while selecting video,
just click any empty space within the Event pane to remove the
selection frame, and then try again.
211
Chapter 13: Making Film History with iMovie

3. Drag the selection from the Event pane to the spot where it belongs in
the Project pane.
Alternatively, you can press the E key, or click the Add to Project button
(the first button on the Editing toolbar).
Do this several times, and you have a movie, just like the editors of old used
to do with actual film clips. This is a good point to mention a moviemaking
Mark’s Maxim:
Preview your work — and do it often.TM
iMovie offers two Play Full Screen buttons: one under the Event Library, and
one under the Project Library. Select the project or Event you want to play,
and then click the corresponding button. You can also choose View➪Play Full
Screen to watch the selection. Press the space bar to pause, and press the
Esc to return to iMovie. You can also move your mouse to display a filmstrip
that you can click to skip forward or backward in the project or Event.
To play a selection from the Playhead position, press Ô+G. (If you’ve ever
watched directors at work on today’s movie sets, they’re constantly watching
a monitor to see what things will look like for the audience. You have the
same option in iMovie!)
While you’re moving through clips in the Event pane, you might decide that 
a certain clip has a favorite scene . . . or that another clip has material you
don’t want, like Uncle Ed’s shadow puppets. (Shudder.) iMovie ’08 introduces
Favorite and Rejected scenes, allowing you to view and use your best camera
work (and ignore the worst stuff). To mark video, select a range of frames or
an entire clip; then click the Mark as Favorite button on the Editing toolbar.
Click the Reject button to hide the selected video or frames from view. (You
can always unmark a Favorite scene by using the Unmark button on the
Editing toolbar.)
Removing clips from your movie
Don’t like a clip? Begone! To banish a clip from your movie project
1. Click the offending clip in the Project pane to select it.
2. Press Delete.
Alternatively, you can right-click the clip (or a selection you made by
dragging) and choose either Delete Entire Clip or Delete Selection from
the menu that appears.
212
Part IV: Living the iLife 

The clip disappears — only from the project, not from your hard drive — and
iMovie automatically rearranges the remaining clips and still images in your
movie.
If you remove the wrong clip, don’t panic. Instead, use the iMovie Undo feature
(press Ô+Z) to restore it.
Reordering clips in your movie
If Day One of your vacation appears after Day Two in your movie, you can
easily reorder your clips and stills by dragging them to the proper space in
the Project pane. When you release the mouse, iMovie automatically moves
the rest of your movie aside with a minimum of fuss and bother.
Editing clips in iMovie
If a clip has extra seconds of footage at the beginning or end, you don’t want
that superfluous stuff in your masterpiece. Our favorite video editor gives
you the following functions:
 Crop: Removes unwanted material from a video clip or still image, allow-
ing you to change the aspect ratio of the media
 Rotate: Rotates a clip or image on its center axis
 Trim: Trims frames from a video clip
Before you can edit, however, you have to select a section of a clip:
1. Click a clip or image in either the Project pane or the Event pane to
display it in the Monitor (refer to Figure 13-2).
2. To select the entire clip or image, simply click it.
3. Drag your mouse cursor across the thumbnail to select the section of
the media you want to edit.
Some editing functions automatically apply to the entire clip, such as
Crop and Rotate.
The selected region is surrounded by a yellow frame. You’re ready to
edit that selected part of the clip.
Note the handles that appear at the beginning or ending of the selection. You
can make fine changes to the selected section by dragging them.
213
Chapter 13: Making Film History with iMovie

 To crop: Click the Crop button on the Editing toolbar to display the frame
in the Monitor pane, and then click Crop at the top of the Monitor pane.
Drag the edges of the frame and the handles to select the section you
want to keep. To preview your selection, click the Play button at the top
of the monitor. When you’re ready, click Done, and everything but the
selected region is removed.
 To rotate: Click the Crop button on the Editing toolbar, and then click one
of the two rotation buttons (which carry a curved arrow icon). Each click
rotates the media 90 degrees in that direction. Click Done when the clip
or image is properly oriented.
 To trim: Choose Edit➪Trim to Selection. iMovie removes the frames
from around the selected video.
Edits that you make to one clip or still image can actually be copied to multi-
ple items! Select the edited clip and choose Edit➪Copy from the iMovie menu.
Then you can select one or more clips and use the Edit➪Paste Adjustments
menu to apply Video, Audio, or Crop edits. (To apply all three types of edits,
just choose All.)
Transitions for the masses
Many iMovie owners approach transitions as visual bookends: They merely
act as placeholders that appear between video clips. Nothing could be far-
ther from the truth, though, because judicious use of transitions can make or
break a scene. For example, which would you prefer after a wedding cere-
mony — an abrupt, jarring cut to the reception or a gradual fadeout to the
reception?
Today’s audiences are sensitive to transitions between scenes. Try not to
overuse the same transition. Also weigh the visual impact of a transition 
carefully.
iMovie includes a surprising array of transitions, including old favorites (such
as Fade In and Dissolve) and some nifty stuff you might not be familiar with
(such as Cube and Page Curl). To display your transition collection (see
Figure 13-5), click the Show Transitions button on the Browser toolbar (or
press Ô+4).
To see what a particular transition looks like, move your mouse pointer over
the thumbnail to display the transition in miniature.
214
Part IV: Living the iLife 

Adding a transition couldn’t be easier: Drag the transition from the list in the
Transitions Browser pane and drop it between clips or between a clip and a
still image in the Project pane. In iMovie ’08, transitions are applied in real
time — you don’t end up checking your mail or tapping your fingers on your
desk waiting for a transition to render (a fancy word for calculate, which
means that older versions of iMovie required you to wait while a transition
was generated).
Even Gone with the Wind had titles
The last stop on our iMovie Hollywood Features Tour is the Titles Browser, as
shown in Figure 13-6. You find it by clicking the Title button on the Browser
toolbar (which bears a big capital T), or by pressing Ô+3. You can add a title
with a still image, but iMovie also includes everything you need to add basic
animated text to your movie.
Most of the controls you can adjust are the same for each animation style.
You can change the font, size, and color of the text.
Figure 13-5:

215
Chapter 13: Making Film History with iMovie

To add a title
1. Select an animation thumbnail from the browser pane and drag it to
the desired spot in the Project pane.
2. Click the Show Fonts button to make any changes to the fonts or text
attributes.
3. Click in a text box to type your own line of text.
4. Click the Play button to preview your title.
iMovie displays a preview of the effect in the monitor with the settings
that you choose.
5. Click Done.
The title appears in the Project pane.
Sharing Your Finished Classic with Others
Your movie is complete, you saved it to your hard drive, and now you’re won-
dering where to go from here. Click Share on the application menu bar, and
you’ll see that iMovie can unleash your movie upon your unsuspecting family
and friends (and even the entire world) in a number of ways:

216
Part IV: Living the iLife 

 iTunes: Send your movie to your iTunes Library as a movie. iMovie
offers recommended settings for your iPod, iPhone, Apple TV, and 
viewing on your iMac.
 .Mac Web Gallery: Share your movie with the world at large by posting
it within a Web Gallery on your .Mac Web site. (I provide more .Mac
details to chew on in Chapter 9.)
 Media Browser: Make your iMovie project available within other iLife
’08 applications, in four different sizes suited to different display devices.
 Export Movie: Create a copy of your movie on your hard drive, in one of
four different sizes.
 Export via QuickTime: You can create a QuickTime movie with your
project by using the QuickTime encoding engine, which allows you
greater control over the export process and the attributes of the fin-
ished movie file.
If you use this option, any computer with an installed copy of QuickTime
can display your movies, and you can use QuickTime movies in Keynote
presentations as well.
 YouTube: Yep, you read right, you can send your iMovie directly to the
YouTube Web site! Can it get more convenient than that? (I think not.)
 Export to Final Cut XML: If you’d like to transfer your iMovie ’08 project
to Final Cut Pro, use this option to create a compatible XML file.
When you choose a sharing option, iMovie displays the video quality for the
option, and makes automatic changes to the movie attributes. For example,
choosing Tiny will reduce the finished movie as far as possible in file size,
and the audio is reduced to mono instead of stereo.
Need to take a movie offline or stop sharing it? You can also remove a project
from iTunes, your iLife Media Browser, your .Mac Web site, or the YouTube
Web site from the Sharing menu as well. Just click the corresponding Remove
menu item. (Of course, you can share the project again at any time.)
If you’re worried about permanently reducing the quality of your project by
sharing it in a smaller size, fear not! When you choose a sharing option to
export your movie, your original project remains on your hard drive,
unchanged, so you can share a better quality version at any time in the
future!
After you adjust any settings specific to the desired sharing option, click
Publish (or Save) to start the ball rolling.

 Doing things automatically with OneStep DVD and Magic iDVD
 Burning a DVD for your friends and family
H
ow does the old adage go? Oh, yes, it’s like this:
Any DVD movie must be a pain to create. You’ll need a ton of money for
software, too. And you’ll have to take hours of training that will cause
your brain to explode.
Funny thing is, DVD authoring — designing and creating a DVD movie —
really was like that for many years. Only video professionals could afford the
software and tackle the training needed to master all the intricacies of DVD
Menu design.
Take one guess as to the company that changed all that. (No, it wasn’t Coca-
Cola.) Apple’s introduction of iDVD was (quite literally) a revolution in DVD
authoring. Suddenly you, your kids, and Aunt Harriet could all design and
burn DVD movies and picture slideshows. Dear reader, this iDVD thing is huge.
Plus, you’ll quickly find out that iDVD ’08 is tightly connected to all the other
slices of your digital hub. In plain English, you can pull content from iTunes,
iPhoto, and iMovie as easily as a politician makes promises. And that, friends
and neighbors, is the quintessential definition of cool.
In this chapter, I show you how your iMac can take on Hollywood as well as
how you can produce a DVD movie with content that’s as good as any you’d
rent at the video store!

Hey, Where’s the Complex Window?
Figure 14-1 shows iDVD in all its glory. The iDVD ’08 window was designed by
the same smart people who brought you the iMovie window. You have to
supply your own digital video clips, background audio, and digital photo-
graphs, of course.
Take a moment to appreciate iDVD — no half-a-dozen secondary windows to
fiddle with or silly palettes strung out everywhere. (Can you tell that I’ve had
my fill of old-style DVD authoring applications?) Allow me to list the high-
lights of the iDVD window:
 Menu display: This section takes up the largest part of the iDVD window,
with good reason. You create your project here. In this case, Menu refers
to your DVD Menu, not the menu at the top of your Mac’s display.
 Media pane: You add video, still images, and audio to your project from
here, as well as tweak and fine-tune things. The Media pane actually
comprises three separate panes. To choose a new pane, click one of
these buttons at the bottom of the screen:
• Themes: You apply themes (such as Travel Cards, Wedding White,
and Baby Mobile) to your DVD Menu to give it a certain look and
feel.
• Buttons: These options apply to the selected item, such as drop
shadows on your text titles or the appearance of your menu 
buttons.
• Media: From here, you can add media items, such as video clips
and photos, to your menu.
 Add button: Clicking this opens a pop-up menu (which sports a dapper
plus sign) from which you can choose one of three types of buttons to
add to a project. The choices are
• Add Submenu: Choose this item to add a new submenu button to
your DVD Menu. The person using your DVD Menu can click a
button to display a new submenu that can include additional
movies or slideshows. (If that sounds like ancient Greek, hang on.
All becomes clearer later in the chapter in the section, “Adding
movies.”)
In iDVD ’08, a Menu can hold up to 12 buttons, so submenus let
you pack more content on your DVD. (Older versions of the appli-
cation only allowed 6 buttons, so don’t feel too cheated.) Anyway,
each submenu you create can hold another 12 buttons.
220
Part IV: Living the iLife 

• Add Movie: Yep, this is the most popular button in the whole shoot-
ing match. Click this menu item to add a new movie clip to your
menu.
• Add Slideshow: If you want to add a slideshow to your DVD — say,
using photos from your hard drive or pictures from your iPhoto
library — click this menu item.
 Inspector button: Click this button to display the Inspector window for
the current menu or a highlighted object. From this window, you can
change the look of an individual submenu button or an entire menu.
 Motion: Click this button (which bears two arrows in a circular shape)
to start or stop the animation cycle used with the current iDVD theme.
The animation repeats (just like it will on your finished DVD) until you
click the Motion button again.

Need a visual indicator of the length of your menu’s animation cycle?
Just follow the animation playhead, which moves below the Menu dis-
play to indicate where you are in the animation cycle. Like other play-
heads in the iLife suite, you can click and drag the diamond-shaped
playhead button to move anywhere in the animation cycle. Choose
View➪Hide Motion Playhead to turn off the playhead display.
 DVD Map: Click the DVD Map button to display the organizational chart
for your DVD Menu. Each button and submenu that you add to your top-
level DVD Menu is displayed here, and you can jump directly to a partic-
ular item by double-clicking it. Use this road map to help design the
layout of your DVD Menu system or to get to a particular item quickly.
To return to the Menu display, click the DVD Map button again.
 Edit Drop Zones: Clicking this button allows you to edit the look and
contents of a drop zone on your menu. Don’t worry; I explain more
about drop zones in the sidebar titled, “Taking advantage of drop
zones,” later in this chapter.
 Preview: To see how your DVD Menu project looks when burned to a
DVD, click Preview. You get a truly nifty onscreen remote control that
you can use to navigate your DVD Menu, just as if you were watching
your DVD on a standard DVD player. To exit Preview mode, click the
Stop button on the remote control. Read more about this control in the
upcoming section, “Previewing Your Masterpiece.”
 Burn: Oh, yeah, you know what this one is for — recording your com-
pleted DVD movie to a blank disc.
That’s the lot! Time to get down to the step-by-step business of making movies.
Starting a New DVD Project
When you launch iDVD ’08 for the first time (or if you close all iDVD windows),
you get the sporty menu shown in Figure 14-2. Take a moment to discover
more about these four choices.
Creating a new project
If you choose Create a New Project, iDVD prompts you to type a name for
your new DVD project and to set a location where the project files should be
saved. By default, the very reasonable choice is your Documents folder. You
also get to choose whether your project will display in a Standard (full-
screen) aspect ratio of 4:3, or a Widescreen aspect ratio of 16:9. If you’ve
been watching DVD movies for some time, you recognize these two terms.
222
Part IV: Living the iLife 

You’ll probably crave Widescreen format if you have a widescreen TV — go
figure — but both formats will display on both types of televisions.
Click Create, and the iDVD window appears in all its glory.
Opening an existing project
If you’ve used iDVD and had a DVD project open the last time you quit the
application, iDVD automatically loads the DVD project you were working on.
However, you can open any DVD you created by clicking Open an Existing
Project. (To choose a different existing project from the iDVD window, press
Ô+O, or choose File➪Open Recent.)
Automating the whole darn process
If you’re a fan of click-it-and-forget-it (or are in a hurry), you can throw caution
to the wind and allow iDVD to create your latest epic for you! iDVD offers two
automated methods of creating a DVD movie disc.
Using OneStep DVD
With OneStep, iDVD does most of the work automatically by using the media
clips and photos that you specify. To allow iDVD to help you create a movie,
click the OneStep DVD button on the top-level menu (refer to Figure 14-2). If
Figure 14-2:
Will that 
be create 
or edit,
manual or
automatic?
223
Chapter 14: iDVD — Your DVD Movie Factory

you already opened a project, choose File➪OneStep DVD from the applica-
tion menu bar (to import clips directly from your camera) or File➪OneStep
DVD from Movie (to select a clip to import from your hard drive). I tell you
more about the OneStep DVD feature later in the section, “A Word about
Automation.”
Using Magic iDVD
Magic iDVD is the newcomer on the block, and it falls neatly between total
automation (with OneStep DVD) and total manual control. Click the Magic
iDVD button on the top-level menu (as shown in Figure 14-2). If you already
opened a project, you can choose File➪Magic iDVD from the menu bar to
choose a theme, drop specific movies and specific photos into filmstrips, 
and choose an audio track.
Unlike OneStep DVD, you get to preview the finished product. If it’s to your
liking, you can choose to either burn the disc directly or save a full-blown
iDVD project to your hard drive with the results. Sweet.
You can find out more about the new Magic iDVD feature later in the section,
“A Word about Automation.”
Creating a DVD from Scratch
Doing things the old-fashioned, creative, and manual way (following the
examples in this section) involves four basic steps:
1. Design the DVD Menu.
Choose a theme and any necessary buttons or links.
2. Add media.
You can drag movie files from iMovie HD, still images from iPhoto, and
music from iTunes.
3. Tweak.
Adjust and fine-tune your DVD Menu settings.
4. Finish things up.
Preview and burn your DVD, or save it to your hard drive.
Choosing just the right theme
The first step to take when manually designing a new DVD Menu system is 
to add a theme. In the iDVD world, a theme is a preset package that helps
determine the appearance and visual appeal of your DVD Menu, including a
224
Part IV: Living the iLife 

background image, menu animation, an audio track, and a group of settings
for text fonts and button styles.
iDVD helps those of us who are graphically challenged by including a wide
range of professionally designed themes for all sorts of occasions, ranging
from old standbys such as weddings, birthdays, and vacations to more
generic themes with the accent on action, friendship, and technology. To
view the included themes, click the Themes button in the lower-right corner
of the iDVD window (see Figure 14-3).
To choose a theme for your project — or to see what a theme looks like on
your menu — click any thumbnail and watch iDVD update the Menu display.
If you decide while creating your DVD Menu that you need a different theme,
you can change themes at any time. iDVD won’t lose a single button or video
clip that you add to your DVD Menu. You’ll be amazed at how the look and
sound of your DVD Menu completely changes with just the click of a theme
thumbnail.
Figure 14-3:
Select a
new theme
from the
Themes
pane.
225
Chapter 14: iDVD — Your DVD Movie Factory

Adding movies
Drop zones and themes are cool, but most folks want to add video to their
DVD. To accomplish this, iDVD uses buttons as links to your video clips. In
fact, some iDVD Movie buttons display a preview of the video they’ll display!
To play the video on a DVD player, you select the Movie button with the
remote control, just like you do for a commercial DVD.
To add a Movie button, drag a QuickTime movie file from the Finder and drop
it onto your DVD Menu display. (Note that only MPEG-4 QuickTime movies
are supported. MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 movie clips may be rejected, or con-
verted when possible.) Alternatively, drag a clip from the iDVD media pane
into the iDVD window, or click the Add button and choose Add Movie from
the pop-up menu.
226
Part IV: Living the iLife 
Taking advantage of drop zones
Most of Apple’s animated themes include special
bordered areas marked as drop zones. These
locations have nothing to do with skydiving;
rather, a drop zone is a placeholder in the Menu
that can hold a single video clip or photograph.
When you drag a video clip or an image to a drop
zone, that clip or picture is added to the anima-
tion in Apple’s theme! Think about that for a
moment; I know I did. You can actually personal-
ize a Hollywood-quality animated DVD menu with
your own photos and video!
Most of the themes included with iDVD ’08
include at least one drop zone, and some are
practically jampacked with drop zones. For
example, the amazing Forever theme has a
whopping six drop zones! If you think a menu
looks just fine without anything in a drop zone,
however, you don’t have to put anything there.
The words Drop Zone disappear when you pre-
view or burn your DVD. (Empty frames do tend to
look a bit silly in some themes, though.)
To add a video clip or image to a drop zone,
simply drag the clip or photo from a Finder
window and drop it on the desired drop zone. You
can also drag clips or photos from other sources,
including the Movie and iPhoto panes in iDVD,
the iMovie window, or the iPhoto window.
(Remember, Apple is anything but strict on these
matters.) Remember, drop zones don’t act as
links or buttons to other content; the stuff you
add to a menu’s drop zones appears only as part
of the theme’s animation cycle. You can even
drag an iPhoto event or album to a drop zone,
and it will continuously cycle through the images.
Wowsers!
To see all the drop zones at one time (without
cycling through the animation), click the new Edit
Drop Zones button at the bottom center of the
iDVD window; you see a thumbnail display of
each zone. You can drag items to these thumb-
nails, or you can jump right to one in the anima-
tion by clicking on the thumbnail. To delete the
contents of a drop zone, click the thumbnail in
the editor and press Delete.
If you’re adding something to a dynamic drop
zone (which disappears and reappears during
the menu animation cycle), click the Motion
button to activate the animation and then click it
again to stop the animation cycle. Now click and
drag the animation playhead until the desired
drop zone is in view. To delete the contents of a
dynamic drop zone, Control-click (or right-click)
the drop zone and choose Clear Drop Zone
Contents.

iDVD and iMovie are soul mates, so you can also display the iDVD Media pane
and then click Movies from the pop-up menu. Now you can drag clips from
your Movies folder.
No matter the source of the clip, when you drop it onto your DVD Menu, iDVD
adds a Movie button, as you can see in Figure 14-4. Note that some buttons
appear as text links rather than actual buttons. The appearance of a Movie
button in your DVD Menu is determined by the theme you choose.
A Movie button doesn’t have to stay where iDVD places it! By default, iDVD
aligns buttons and text objects on an invisible grid. However, if you don’t
want such order imposed on your creativity, just drag the object wherever
you’d like to turn on Free Positioning. (You can also right-click the object and
choose the Free Positioning item from the menu that appears.) iDVD ’08 even
provides cool new automatic guides that help you align objects when you’re
using Free Positioning. You see them as yellow lines that appear when
objects are aligned along a vertical or horizontal plane.
As I mention earlier, you can have up to 12 buttons on your iDVD Menu. To
add more content than 12 buttons allow, add a submenu by clicking the Add
button and choosing Add Submenu from the pop-up menu. Now you can click
the submenu button to jump to that screen and drag up to another 12 movie
files into it.

Chapter 14: iDVD — Your DVD Movie Factory

Keep in mind your target audience while you create your DVD. Standard TV
sets have a different aspect ratio (height to width) and resolution (number of
pixels on the screen) than a digital video clip, and a standard TV isn’t as pre-
cise in focusing that image on the tube. If you select the Standard aspect ratio
when you create the project, you can make sure that your DVD content looks
great on a standard TV screen by following these steps:
1. Click View on the old-fashioned iDVD menu (the one at the top of the
screen).
2. Choose the Show TV Safe Area command.
You can also press the convenient Ô+T shortcut. iDVD adds a smaller
rectangle within the iDVD window to mark the screen dimensions of a
standard TV.
3. Place your content within the safe area.
If you take care that your menu buttons and (most of) your background
image fit within this smaller rectangle, you’re assured that folks with a
standard television can enjoy your work.
To toggle off the TV Safe Area rectangle, press Ô+T again.
If your entire family is blessed with a fleet of HDTVs (or you chose the Wide-
screen aspect ratio for this project), leave the Show TV Safe Area option off.
Today’s widescreen displays can handle just about any orientation.
228
Part IV: Living the iLife 
A word on image dimensions
For best playback results on a standard TV, make
sure that your background image has the same
dimensions as standard digital video — 640 x 480
pixels. If the dimensions of your image don’t
match the dimensions of digital video, iDVD will
stretch or shrink the image to fit, which might
have undesirable effects. When your image is
stretched and skewed to fit the DVD Menu, Aunt
Harriet might end up looking like Shrek (or per-
haps Fiona).
You can use QuickTime player or iPhoto to
change the dimensions of your background
image for import into iDVD. For example, you can
use the iPhoto crop feature to alter the overall
shape of the image and then resize it within
iPhoto. Use the Size setting when you export 
the image from iPhoto; then save the file in the
Pictures folder located in your Home folder so
that you can find it easily later. (For more on
working in iPhoto, see Chapter 12.)
If you enjoy a cutting-edge widescreen (16:9) or
HD (high-definition) TV display, you naturally
might not have the same problem. And because
iDVD ’08 supports HD video and 16:9 video with
a number of widescreen themes, be prepared to
kiss the phrases pan-and-scan and full-screen
goodbye and forget about the Show TV Safe
Area feature. If your completed DVD projects are
purely for your own enjoyment, that’s a great
idea. However, don’t forget that if you distribute
your discs to others with old-fashioned TVs
dating back to the archaic 1980s and 1990s, they
might not be pleased with what they see!

Great! Now my audience 
demands a slideshow!
Many Mac owners don’t realize that iDVD can use not only video clips but
also digital photos as content. In fact, you can add a group of images to your
DVD Menu via the Slideshow buttons, which allow the viewer to play back a
series of digital photographs. iDVD handles everything for you, so there’s no
tricky timing to figure out or weird scripts to write. Just click the Add button
at the bottom of the iDVD window and choose Add Slideshow. iDVD places a
Slideshow button on your DVD Menu.
After the Slideshow button is on tap, add the content — in this case, by
choosing the images that iDVD adds to your DVD Menu. Follow these steps 
to select your slideshow images:
1. Double-click the Slideshow Menu button — the one you just added to
the menu — to open the Slideshow display (see Figure 14-5).
2. Click the Media button (bottom right of the screen).
3. Click the Photos button (top right of the screen) to display your iPhoto
library and photo albums.

229
Chapter 14: iDVD — Your DVD Movie Factory

4. Drag your favorite image thumbnails from the Photos list and drop
them into the My Slideshow window.
You can also drag images straight from a Finder window or the iPhoto
window itself. (Those Apple folks are sooooo predictable.)
5. Drag around the photos in the My Slideshow window to set their
order of appearance in your slideshow.
6. To add audio to these pictures, drag your favorite audio file from the
Finder and drop it in the Audio well in the My Slideshow window.
The Audio well is the box bearing the speaker icon, next to the volume
control below the My Slideshow window.
Alternatively, click the Audio button (top right of the screen) to select an
audio track from your iTunes library, iTunes playlists, or GarageBand
creations.
7. Click the Return button to return to your DVD Menu.
If you’re using a menu with animated buttons that display an image (rather
than text buttons), you can choose which image you want to appear on 
the Slideshow button. Click the Slideshow button that you added and see the
slider that appears above the Slideshow button. Drag this slider to scroll
through the images you added. When you find the image that you want to use
for the Slideshow button in the DVD Menu, click the Slideshow button again
to save your changes.
Now for the music. . . .
Most of the Apple-supplied themes already have their own background music
for your menu, so you might not even need to add music to your DVD Menu.
However, if you want to change the existing background music (or if your
menu currently doesn’t have any music), adding your own audio to the cur-
rent menu is child’s play!
1. Click the Media button.
2. Click the Audio button to reveal the musical Shangri-La, as shown in
Figure 14-6.
3. Drag an audio file from the iTunes playlist or GarageBand folder dis-
play and drop it on the menu background.
iDVD ’08 accepts every sound format that you can use for encoding in
iTunes: AIFF, MP3, AAC, Apple Lossless, and WAV audio files.
4. Click the Motion button to watch your DVD Menu animation cycle set
to the new background audio.
5. Click the Motion button again to stop the animation and return to seri-
ous work.

Part IV: Living the iLife 

Giving Your DVD the Personal Touch
You can easily make changes to the default settings provided with the theme
you choose. iDVD offers all sorts of controls that allow you to change the
appearance and behavior of buttons, text, and the presentation of your con-
tent. In this section, I show you how to cast out iDVD’s (perfectly good)
defaults and then tweak things to perfection.
Using Uncle Morty for your 
DVD Menu background
Hey, Uncle Morty might not be a supermodel, but he has birthdays and
anniversaries, and iDVD is more than happy to accommodate you in docu-
menting those milestones! Follow these steps to change the background of
your DVD Menu:
1. Click the Inspector button (refer to Figure 14-1).
iDVD displays the Menu Info dialog.
Figure 14-6:
Will it be 
the Beach
Boys or 
the B-52s?
231
Chapter 14: iDVD — Your DVD Movie Factory

2. Get an image, using one of the following methods:
• Drag an image from the Finder and drop it into the Background
well, which appears as a square with a white outline at the top 
of the Menu Info dialog.
• Drag the image directly into the Menu display.
• Use an image from your iPhoto library by clicking the Media button,
choosing Photos, and then dragging the desired image into the
Menu display.
iDVD updates the DVD menu to reflect your new background choice.
Adding your own titles
The one tweak you’ll probably have to perform in every iDVD project is
changing titles. Unfortunately, the default labels provided by iDVD are pretty
lame, and they appear in two important places:
 Menu title: Your large main title usually appears at the top of the DVD
Menu.
 Button captions: Each Submenu, Movie, and Slideshow button that you
add to your menu has its own title.
To change the text in your Menu title or the titles below your buttons, follow
these steps:
1. Select the text by clicking it.
2. Click it again to edit it.
A rectangle with a cursor appears to indicate that you can now edit the
text.
3. Type the new text and then press Return to save the change.

Give my creation motion!
Earlier in this chapter, you can read how to use a different image for your
background, but what about using an animated background? You can use any
QuickTime movie from your iMovie library to animate your DVD Menu back-
ground! Didn’t I tell you that this iDVD thing was huge?
Keep in mind that your background movie should be a short clip; 20–30 sec-
onds is optimal. A clip with a fade-in at the beginning and a fade-out at the
end is the best choice because iDVD loops your background clip continu-
ously, and your animated background flows seamlessly behind your menu.
I’m not talking drop zones here. (See the sidebar, “Taking advantage of drop
zones.”) You can add a movie to a drop zone, of course, but by using a movie
clip as a background, you’re replacing the entire animation sequence rather
than just a single area of the background.
233
Chapter 14: iDVD — Your DVD Movie Factory

Follow these steps to add a new animated background:
1. Click your old friend, the Inspector button (refer to Figure 14-1).
Make sure that no individual objects are highlighted so that the
Inspector window displays the Menu properties instead.
2. Drag a movie from the Finder and drop it into the Background well.
You can click the Movies button in the Media pane to instantly display
your iMovie collection.
3. Click the Motion button in the iDVD window to try out your new 
background.
4. Click the Motion button again to stop the animation cycle.
Previewing Your Masterpiece
Figure 14-7 captures the elusive Preview remote control — truly an awesome
sight. When you click Preview, the Media pane disappears, and your DVD
Menu appears exactly as it will on the finished DVD.
Figure 14-7:

mode — an
incredible

indeed.
234
Part IV: Living the iLife 

Ah, but appearances aren’t everything: You can also use your DVD Menu!
Click the buttons on the remote control to simulate the remote on your DVD
player, or think outside the box and click a menu button directly with your
mouse pointer. iDVD presents the video clip, runs the slideshow, or jumps to
a submenu, just as it will with the completed disc.
This is a great time to test-drive a project before you burn it to disc. To make
sure you don’t waste a blank DVD, make certain that everything you expect
to happen actually happens. Nothing worse than discovering that Aunt
Edna’s slideshow from her Hong Kong trip actually displays your family’s
summer trip to the zoo (whoops). If you made a mistake or something needs
tweaking, click the Exit button on the controller, and you’re back to the iDVD
window proper, where you can edit or fine-tune your project.
iDVD ’08 allows you to save your project as a standard Mac OS X disc image
rather than as a simple project file (or a physical DVD) — a good idea if you’re
out of blank media, because you can use the Apple Disk Utility to open and
mount the disc image as if it were a burned disc. To save an iDVD project as 
a disc image, choose File➪Save as Disc Image (or press Ô+Shift+R).
Interested in tweaking settings across your entire project? Perhaps you’d like
to improve the quality of your recorded video, or you’d like to switch video
modes from NTSC to PAL for a DVD that’s to be sent overseas. If you’d like to
view or change the overall settings for your entire DVD, click Project➪Project
Info to display the Project Info dialog. Heck, you can even switch aspect
ratios, or change the project name. . . . Thanks, Apple!
A Word about Automation
At the beginning of the chapter, I mention the easy way to produce an iDVD
disc or project, using either OneStep DVD (for complete automation) or Magic
iDVD (for partial automation). In this section, I provide you with the details.
One-click paradise with OneStep DVD
If you’re in a hurry to create a DVD from clips on your DV camcorder and you
don’t mind losing your creative input, OneStep DVD is just the ticket. In short,
iDVD ’08 allows you to plug in your DV camcorder, answer a question or two,
and then sit back while the application does all the work. iDVD ’08 imports the
DV clips, creates a basic menu design, and burns the disc automatically!
235
Chapter 14: iDVD — Your DVD Movie Factory

Using OneStep DVD will appeal to any iMac owner. Why not produce a DVD
right after a wedding or birthday that you can give as a gift? Photographers
who cover those same special events might consider selling a DVD made with
OneStep DVD. If you happen to capture something incredibly unique — say, a
UFO landing or an honest politician — you can use OneStep DVD to create an
instant backup of the clips on your DV camcorder. You could even keep your
friends and family up to date with the progress of your vacation by sending
them a daily DVD of your exploits! (You gotta admit that even Grandma would
consider that eminently sassy!)
Follow these steps to start the OneStep DVD process:
1. Click the OneStep DVD button on the iDVD ’08 top-level menu (refer
to Figure 14-2).
Alternatively, choose File➪OneStep DVD. iDVD displays the dialog
shown in Figure 14-8.
If you want to use OneStep DVD with an existing movie on your iMac’s
hard drive, choose File➪OneStep DVD from Movie instead. iDVD
prompts you for the video clip to use.
2. Following the prompts, connect the FireWire cable from your DV cam-
corder; then turn on the camcorder and set it to VCR mode.
3. Click OK.
4. Load a blank DVD when prompted.
Exercising control with Magic iDVD
Got a little extra time? For those who prefer to make just a few choices and
let iDVD do the rest, the new Magic iDVD feature just plain rocks! However,
you can’t import clips directly from your DV camcorder like you can with
OneStep DVD. Instead, you select the following:

soundtrack.
7. Click Preview to see a preview of the finished project, complete with
remote control. To exit Preview mode, click Exit.
8. To open the project in its current form in the main iDVD window,
click Create Project.
Opening your Magic iDVD work as a full iDVD project gives you full cre-
ative control over what’s been completed so far. (In effect, Magic iDVD
has acted as an assistant and helped you to quickly build the foundation
for an iDVD project.)
9. To record your completed project directly to DVD, load a blank DVD,
and then click Burn.
To return to the iDVD main window at any time, just click the Close button on

Recording a Finished Project 
to a Shiny Disc
When you’re ready to record your next Oscar-winning documentary on family
behaviors during vacation, just follow these simple words.
1. Click the Burn button at the bottom of the iDVD window.
I have to admit, the Burn button that appears has to be my favorite
single control in all my 20-plus years of computing! It looks powerful, it
looks sexy . . . it wants to burn. (Sorry about that. Rather wanton of me.)
2. After iDVD asks you to insert a blank DVD-R into the SuperDrive, load
a blank DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD+R, or DVD+RW (depending on the
media your Mac can handle).
Your SuperDrive might be able to burn and read a DVD+R, DVD-RW, or
DVD+RW, but what about your DVD player? Keep in mind that only DVD-
Rs are likely to work in older DVD players. The latest generation of DVD
players are likely DVD+R compatible as well, but I’ve seen only a handful
of DVD players that can handle rewriteable media at the time of this
writing. Therefore, remember the destination for the discs you burn and
choose your media accordingly.
After a short pause, iDVD begins burning the DVD. The application
keeps you updated with a progress bar.

Part IV: Living the iLife 

Hey, while you’re waiting, how about a timely book recommendation? If you
want to discover how to burn all sorts of data, audio, and exotic CD and DVD
formats, I can heartily recommend another of my books, CD & DVD Recording
For Dummies, 2nd Edition (Wiley). It’s a comprehensive manual for recording
on the Mac. You’ll find coverage of the popular Toast Titanium recording
application from Roxio, too.
When the disc is finished, you’re ready to load it into your favorite local DVD
player, or you can load it back into your iMac and enjoy your work, using the
Apple DVD Player.
Either way, it’s all good!

o you dream of making music? I’ve always wanted to join a band, but I
never devoted the time nor learned to play the guitar. You know the
drill: Those rock stars struggled for years to gain the upper hand over an
instrument, practicing for untold hours, memorizing chords, and. . . . Wait a
second. I almost forgot. You don’t need to do any of that now!
Apple’s GarageBand ’08 lets a musical wanna-be (like yours truly) make
music with an iMac — complete with a driving bass line, funky horns, and a
set of perfect drums that never miss a beat. In fact, the thousands of prere-
corded loops on tap in this awesome application even allow you to design
your music to match that melody running through your head, from techno 
to jazz to alternative rock.
Oh, and did I mention that you can also use GarageBand ’08 to produce pod-
casts? That’s right! You can record your voice and easily create your own
show, and then share it with others from your iWeb site! Heck, add photos if
you like. You’ll be the talk of your family and friends and maybe even your
Mac user group.
This chapter explains everything you need to know to create your first song. I
also show you how to import your hit record into iTunes so you can listen to
it on your iPod with a big silly grin on your face (like I do) or add it to your
next iMovie or iDVD project as a royalty-free soundtrack.

Don’t be too smug when you think of all that practicing and hard work you
missed out on. What a shame!
Shaking Hands with Your Band
As you can see in Figure 15-1, the GarageBand window isn’t complex at all,
and that’s good design. In this section, I list the most important controls so

Part IV: Living the iLife 

Your music-making machine includes
 Track list: In GarageBand, a track is a discrete instrument that you set
up to play one part of your song. For example, a classical piece for string
quartet would have four tracks — one each for violin, viola, cello, and
bass. This list contains all the tracks in your song arranged so that you
can easily see and modify them, like the rows in a spreadsheet. A track
begins in the list, stretching out to the right all the way to the end of the
song. As you can see in the upper left of Figure 15-1, I already have one
track defined — a Grand Piano.
If you’re creating a podcast, a Podcast Artwork track like the one you see
at the very top of the list in Figure 15-1 can also appear.
 Timeline: This scrolling area holds the loops (see the following bullet)
that you add or record, allowing you to move and edit them easily. When 
a song plays, the timeline scrolls to give you a visual look at your music.
(Bear with me; you’ll understand that cryptic statement in a page or two.)
 Loop: This is a prerecorded clip of an instrument being played in a spe-
cific style and tempo. Loops are the building blocks of your song. You
can drag loops from the loop browser to a track and literally build a bass
line or a guitar solo. (It’s a little like adding video clips to the timeline in
iMovie HD to build a film.)
 Playhead: This vertical line is a moving indicator that shows you the
current position in your song while it scrolls by in the timeline. You can
drag the playhead to a new location at any time. The playhead also acts
like the insertion cursor in a word processing application: If you insert a
section of a song or a loop from the Clipboard, it appears at the current
location of the playhead. (More on copying and inserting loops later, so
don’t panic.)
 Create a New Track button: Click this button to add a new track to your
song.
 Track Info button: If you need to display the instrument used in a track,
click the track to select it and then click this button. You can also con-
trol settings, such as Echo and Reverb, from the dialog that’s displayed.
 View/Hide Loop Browser button: Click the button with the striking eye
icon to display the Loop Browser at the bottom of the window; click it
again to close it. You can see more tracks at a time without scrolling by
closing the Loop Browser.
 View/Hide Media Browser button: Click this button (which bears icons
of a filmstrip, slide, and musical note) to display the Media Browser at
the right side of the window; click it again to close it. When you close
the media browser, you can see more of your tracks. If you’re already
familiar with iDVD or iMovie HD, you recognize this pane in the
GarageBand window. Use it to add media (in this case, still images or
video clips) to your GarageBand project for use in a podcast.
243
Chapter 15: Recording Your Hits with GarageBand

 Return to Beginning button: Clicking this button immediately moves
the playhead back to the beginning of the timeline.
 Play button: Hey, old friend! At last, a control that you’ve probably used
countless times before, and it works just like the same control on an
audio CD player. Click Play, and GarageBand begins playing your entire
song. Notice that the Play button turns blue. To stop the music, click
Play again; the button loses that sexy blue sheen, and the playhead
stops immediately. (If playback is paused, it begins again at the playhead
position when you click Play.)
 Time/Tempo display: This cool-looking LCD display shows you the 
current playhead position in seconds. You can also click the time/tempo
indicator (the blue LED numeric display at the bottom of the window) to
change the tempo (or speed) of your song.
GarageBand ’08 expands the abilities of the default Time/Tempo display.
Click the icon at the left of the display to choose other modes, such 
as Time (to show a more precise absolute time display) and Project 
(to show the key, tempo, and signature for the song). The signature is
often mistaken for a fraction, but it’s actually shorthand describing the
rhythm of a song — the top number indicates the number of beats in
each bar, and the bottom number indicating the beat as a division of a
whole note. (Luckily, you won’t be tested on this, and GarageBand auto-
mates as much of the music theory required for composition as possible!) 
 Volume slider: Here’s another familiar face. Just drag the slider to raise
or lower the volume.
Of course, more controls are scattered around the GarageBand window, but
these are the main controls used to compose a song . . . which is the next stop!
Composing and Podcasting Made Easy
In this section, I cover the basics of composition in GarageBand, working
from the very beginning. Follow along with this running example:
1. Press Ô+N.
GarageBand displays the Project Select dialog.
2. Click Create New Music Project to create a new song.
GarageBand displays the New Project dialog, as shown in Figure 15-2.
244
Part IV: Living the iLife 

3. Type a name for your new song and then drag the Tempo slider to
select the beats per minute (bpm).
A GarageBand song can have only one tempo (or speed) throughout,
expressed as beats per minute.
4. If you want to adjust the settings for your song, you can select the
• Time signature: The Time pop-up
• Key: The Key pop-ups
If you’re new to music theory (the rules/syntax by which music is created
and written), just use the defaults. Most of the toe-tappin’ tunes that you
and I are familiar with fit right in with these settings.
5. Click the Create button.
You see the window shown in Figure 15-1. (The Ballad Piano 01 section
in the middle of Figure 15-1 — which I show you how to add in the next
section — is an example of a typical loop.)
Adding tracks
Although I’m not a musician, I am a music lover, and I know that many classi-
cal composers approached a new work in the same way you approach a new
song in GarageBand: by envisioning the instruments that you want to hear. 
(I imagine Mozart and Beethoven would’ve been thrilled to use GarageBand,
but I think they did a decent job with pen — quill? — and paper, too.)

Chapter 15: Recording Your Hits with GarageBand

If you’ve followed along to this point, you’ve likely noticed two problems with
your GarageBand window:
 The tiny keyboard in the middle of your GarageBand window ain’t
the greatest. You can record the contents of a software instrument track
by “playing” the keyboard: that is, clicking the keys with your mouse.
(As you might imagine, this isn’t the best solution.) If you’re a musician,
the best method of recording your own notes is with a MIDI instrument,
which I discuss later in the chapter. For now, you can banish the key-
board window by clicking the window’s Close button. To display it again
at any time, press Ô+K.
Even if you’re not interested in using the point-and-click keyboard,
GarageBand now offers a musical typing keyboard, where you press the
keys on your keyboard to simulate the keys on a musical keyboard. (Hey,
if you don’t have a MIDI instrument, at least it’s better than nothing.) To
display the musical typing keyboard window, press Shift+Ô+K. You can
toggle between the regular piano keyboard and the musical keyboard by
clicking on the buttons at the top left of the keyboard window.
 The example song has only one track. If you want to write the next clas-
sical masterpiece for Grand Piano (the default track when you create a
new song in GarageBand), that’s fine. Otherwise, you could start with a
clean slate by choosing Track➪Delete Track on the GarageBand menu
bar. It’s up to you, you’re the composer!
These are the four kinds of tracks you can use in GarageBand ’08:
 Software instrument tracks: These tracks aren’t audio recordings.
Rather, they’re mathematically precise algorithms that your iMac renders
(builds) to fit your needs. If you have a MIDI instrument connected to
your aluminum supercomputer, you can create your own software
instrument tracks — more on MIDI instruments later in this chapter.
In this chapter, I focus on software instrument tracks, which are the 
easiest for a non-musician to use.
 Real instrument tracks: A real instrument track is an actual audio
recording, such as your voice or a physical instrument without a MIDI
connection. (Think microphone.)
 Podcast artwork track: You get only one of these, which holds photos
that appear on a video iPod (or a window on your iWeb site) when your
podcast is playing.
 Video tracks: The video sound track appears if you’re scoring (adding
music) to an iMovie movie. Along with the video sound track, you get a
cool companion video track that shows the clips in your movie. (More
on this in the sidebar, “Look, I’m John Williams!,” later in this chapter.)
246
Part IV: Living the iLife 

Time to add a software instrument track of your very own. Follow these steps:
1. Click the Create a New Track button (which carries a plus sign,
labeled in Figure 15-1).
GarageBand displays the New Track sheet.
2. In the New Track sheet, select the Software Instrument Track radio
button and then click Create.
The New Track sheet disappears, and you’re presented with all those
great instruments in the Track Info pane on the right.
3. Choose the general instrument category by clicking it.
I chose Drum Kits.
4. From the right column, choose your specific style of weapon, such as
Jazz Kit for a jazzy sound.
If you haven’t installed the extra kits along with GarageBand, note that
you may see disabled instruments appear in the list. Click the right
arrow to install the complete set of instruments and loops.
Figure 15-3 illustrates the new track that appears in your list when you
follow these steps.

Chapter 15: Recording Your Hits with GarageBand

If you’re creating a podcast and you want to add a series of still images that will
appear on a video iPod’s screen (or on your iWeb page), follow these steps:
1. Click the View Media Browser button (labeled in Figure 15-1).
2. Click the Photos button.
GarageBand displays all the photos in your iPhoto library and film rolls.
3. Drag an image from your iPhoto library in the media browser to the
Track list.
The Podcast track appears at the top of the Track list, and you can add
and move images in the list at any time, just like the loops that you add
to your instrument tracks. (More on adding and rearranging the con-
tents of a track later in this section.)
Choosing loops
When you have a new, empty track, you can add something that you can hear.
You do that by adding loops to your track from the Loop Browser — Apple
provides you with thousands of loops to choose from — and photos from
your Media Browser. Click the Loop Browser button (which bears the all-
seeing eye) to display your collection, as shown in Figure 15-4.
If your browser looks different from what you see in Figure 15-4, that’s
because of the view mode you’re using, just like the different view modes
available for a Finder window. The three-icon button in the lower-left corner
of the Loop Browser toggles the browser display between column, musical
button, and podcast sounds views. Click the middle of the three buttons to
switch to button mode.
Looking for just the right loop
The track in this running example uses a jazz drum kit, but I haven’t added 
a loop yet. (Refer to Figure 15-3.) Follow these steps to search through your
loop library for just the right rhythm:
1. Click the button that corresponds to the instrument you’re using.
In this example, use the Kits button (which appears as the second
button in the second row within the Loop Browser). Click it, and a list of
different beats appears in the pane to the right of the browser window.
(Check out Figure 15-4 for a sneak peek.)
2. Click one of the loops with a green, music note icon.
Go ahead; this is where things get fun! GarageBand begins playing the
loop nonstop, allowing you to get a feel for how that particular loop
sounds.
248
Part IV: Living the iLife 

Because I’m using only software instruments in this track (and in exam-
ples throughout this chapter), you should choose only software instru-
ment loops, which are identified with a green, music note icon.
3. Click another entry in the list, and the application switches immedi-
ately to that loop.
Now you’re beginning to understand why GarageBand is so cool for both
musicians and the note-impaired. It’s like having your own band, with
members that never get tired and play whatever you want while you’re
composing. (Mozart would’ve loved this.)
If you want to search for a particular instrument, click in the Search field
(labeled in Figure 15-4) and type the text you want to match.
GarageBand returns the search results in the list.
4. Scroll down the list and continue to sample the different loops until
you find one that fits like a glove.
For this reporter, it’s Lounge Jazz Drums 01.

Chapter 15: Recording Your Hits with GarageBand

5. Drag the entry to your Jazz Kit track and drop it at the very beginning
of the timeline (as indicated by the playhead).
Your window will look like Figure 15-5.
If you want that same beat throughout the song, you don’t need to add any
more loops to that track (more on extending that beat in the next section).
However, if you want the drum’s beat to change later in the song, you add a
second loop after the first one in the same track. For now, leave this track as is.
Whoops! Did you do something that you regret? Don’t forget that you can
undo most actions in GarageBand by pressing the old standby Ô+Z immedi-
ately afterward.
Second verse, same as the first
When you compose, you can add additional tracks for each instrument that
you want in your song:
 Each track can have more than one loop.
 Loops don’t have to start at the beginning; you can drop a loop any-
where on the timeline.
For example, in Figure 15-6, you can see that my drum kit kicks in first, but
my bass line doesn’t begin until some time later (for a funkier opening).
Figure 15-5:
A track with
a loop

250
Part IV: Living the iLife 

You put loops on separate tracks so they can play simultaneously on different
instruments. If all your loops in a song are added on the same track, you hear
only one loop at any one time, and all the loops use the same software instru-
ment. By creating multiple tracks, you give yourself the elbow room to bring in
the entire band at the same time. It’s uber-convenient to compose your song
when you can see each instrument’s loops and where they fall in the song.
Click the Reset button in the loop browser to choose another instrument or
genre category.
Resizing, repeating, and moving loops
If you haven’t already tried listening to your entire song, try it now. You can
click Play at any time without wreaking havoc on your carefully created
tracks. Sounds pretty good, doesn’t it?
But wait: I bet the song stopped after about five seconds, right? (You can
watch the passing seconds by using either the Time/Tempo display or the
second rule that appears at the very top of the timeline.) I’m sure that you
want your song to last more than five seconds! After the playhead moves past
the end of the last loop, your song is over. Click Play again to pause the play-
back; then click the Return to Beginning button (labeled in Figure 15-1) to
move the playhead back to the beginning of the song.

Chapter 15: Recording Your Hits with GarageBand

The music stops so soon because your loops are only so long. Most are five
seconds in length, and others are even shorter. To keep the groove going, you
have to do one of three things:
 Resize the loop. Hover your mouse cursor over either the left or right
edge of most loops, and an interesting thing happens: Your cursor
changes to a vertical line with an arrow pointing away from the loop.
That’s your cue to click and drag — and while you drag, most loops
expand to fill the space you’re making, repeating the beats in perfect
time. By resizing a loop, you can literally drag the loop’s edge as long 
as you like.
 Repeat the loop. Depending on the loop that you chose, you might find
that resizing it won’t repeat the measure. Instead, the new part of the
loop is simply dead air. In fact, the length of many loops is limited to
anywhere from one to five seconds. However, if you move your cursor
over the top-right corner of a loop that you want to extend, it turns into
a vertical line with a circular arrow, which tells you that you can click
and repeat the loop. GarageBand actually adds multiple copies of the
same loop automatically, for as far as you drag the loop. In Figure 15-7, 
I repeat the bass loop in Figure 15-6.
 Add a new loop. You can switch to a different loop to change the flow 
of the music. Naturally, the instrument stays the same, but there’s no
reason why you can’t use a horn riff loop in your violin track (as long 
as it sounds good played by a violin)! To GarageBand, a software instru-
ment track is compatible with any software instrument loop that you
add from the Loop Browser as long as that loop is marked with our old
friend, the green music note.
252
Part IV: Living the iLife 
Look, I’m John Williams!
You, too, can be a famous composer of sound-
tracks. Well, perhaps not quite as famous as Mr.
Williams, but even he had to start somewhere.
To add a GarageBand score to an iMovie, click
the Track menu and then click Show Movie
Track to display the Movie track in the list.
Choose a movie to score from the familiar con-
fines of the Media Browser, and drag it to the
Movie track. (Note that your project can’t have
both a Movie track and a Podcast track at the
same time.)
At this point, you add and modify instrument
tracks and loops just like you would any other
GarageBand project. The existing sound for the
iMovie project appears in the Movie Sound
track. A Video Preview pane appears on top of
the Track Info pane on the right side of the
GarageBand window. When you click the Play
button, the video is shown as well so that you
can check your work and tweak settings (as I
describe later in the chapter).
After you finish composing, click Share on the
menu bar and choose whether to export your
work to iDVD, as a QuickTime movie directly to
your hard drive, or to iTunes as a movie. Note
that you can’t return to iMovie with your project,
so scoring should be a final step in the produc-
tion of your movie.

You can also use the familiar cut (Ô+X ), copy (Ô+C) and paste (Ô+V ) short-
cuts to um, cut, copy, and paste loops from place to place, both on the time-
line and from track to track. Hold down Option and drag a loop to repeat it,
and click a loop and drag it anywhere to move it. After all, you’re working
under Mac OS X — the Leopard breed of cat.
Each track can be adjusted so that you can listen to the interplay between
two or more tracks or hear how your song sounds without a specific track:
 Click the tiny speaker button under the track name in the list, and the
button turns blue to indicate that the track is muted. To turn off the
mute, click the speaker icon again.
 You can change the volume or balance of each individual track by using
the mixer that appears next to the track name. This comes in handy if
you want an instrument to sound louder or confine that instrument to
the left or right speaker.
A track doesn’t have to be filled for every second with one loop or another.
As you can see in Figure 15-8, my first big hit — I call it Turbo Techno — has a
number of repeating loops with empty space between them as different
instruments perform solo. Not bad for an air guitarist who can barely whistle.
Listen for it soon at a rave near you!

Chapter 15: Recording Your Hits with GarageBand

Using the Arrange track
GarageBand ’08 adds another method you can use to monkey with your
music: Use the Arrange track to define specific sections of a song, allowing
you to reorganize things by selecting, moving, and copying entire sections.
For example, you’re probably familiar with the chorus (refrain) of a song, and
how often it appears during the course of the tune. In an Arrange track, you
can reposition the entire chorus within your song, carrying all the loops and
settings within the chorus along with it! If you need another chorus, just copy
that arrangement.
To use an Arrange track, display it by choosing Track➪Show Arrange Track.
It appears as a thin strip at the top of the track list. Click the Add Region
button in the Arrange track (which carries a plus sign), and you see a new
untitled region appear (as shown in Figure 15-9). You can drag the right side
of the Arrange region to resize it, or drag it to move it anywhere in the song.
Figure 15-8:

Who wants an arrangement full of regions named untitled? To rename an
Arrangement region, click the word untitled to select it (the Arrange track
turns blue), and then click the title again to display a text box. Type a new
name for the region and then press Return.
Now, here’s where arrangement regions get cool:
 To move an entire arrangement region, click the region’s title in the
Arrange track and then drag it anywhere you like within the song.
 To copy an arrangement region, hold down the Option key and drag
the desired region’s title to the spot where you want the copy to appear.
 To delete an arrangement region, select it and press Ô+Option+Delete.
 To replace the contents of an arrangement region with those of
another arrangement region, hold down the Ô key and drag the
desired region’s title on top of the offending region’s title.
 To switch two arrangement regions in your song — swapping the con-
tents completely — drag one of the arrangement region titles on top of
the other and then release the mouse button.

Tweaking the settings for a track
You don’t think that John Mayer or U2 just “play and walk away,” do you? No,
they spend hours after the recording session is over, tweaking their music 
in the studio and on the mixing board until every note sounds just like it
should. You can adjust the settings for a track, too. The tweaks that you can
perform include adding effects (pull a Hendrix, and add echo and reverb to
your electric guitar track) and kicking in an equalizer (for fine-tuning the
sound of your background horns).
To make adjustments to a track, follow these steps:
1. Click the desired track in the track list to select it.
2. Click the Track Info button (labeled in Figure 15-1).
3. Click the Details triangle at the bottom to expand the pane and show
the settings shown in Figure 15-10.
4. Select the check box of each effect you want to enable.
Each of the effects has a modifier setting. For example, you can adjust
the amount of echo to add by dragging its slider.

GarageBand ’08 provides a new Visual Equalizer window that you can
use to create a custom equalizer setting for each track. You can display
the Visual EQ window by clicking the Edit button at the far right of the
Visual EQ controls in the expanded Track Info pane. To change the Bass,
Low Mid, High Mid, or Treble setting for a track, click and drag the
equalizer waveform in the desired direction. And, yep, you can do this
while your song is playing, so you can use both your eyes and ears to
define the perfect settings!
5. To save the instrument as a new custom instrument (so that you can
choose it the next time you add a track), click the Save Instrument

Chapter 15: Recording Your Hits with GarageBand
Join in and jam . . . or talk!
As I mention elsewhere in this chapter,
GarageBand is even more fun if you happen to
play an instrument! (And yes, I’m envious, no
matter how much I enjoy the techno and jazz
music that I create. After all, take away my
iMac, and I’m back to playing the kazoo.)
Most musicians use MIDI instruments to play
music on the computer. That pleasant-sounding
acronym stands for Musical Instrument Digital
Interface. A wide variety of MIDI instruments
are available these days, from traditional MIDI
keyboards to more exotic fun, such as MIDI
saxophones. For example, Apple sells a 49-key,
M-Audio MIDI keyboard for around $100, which
uses a USB connection to your iMac.
Most MIDI instruments on the market today 
use a USB connection. If you have an older
instrument with traditional MIDI ports — they’re
round, so you’ll never confuse them with a USB 
connector — you need a USB-to-MIDI converter.
You can find this type of converter on the Apple
Web site for around $50. (If you’re recording your
voice for a podcast, things are easier because
you can use your iMac’s built-in microphone.)
After your instrument is connected, you can
record tracks by using any software instrument.
Create a new software instrument track as I
demonstrate in this chapter, select it, and then
play a few notes. Suddenly, you’re playing the
instrument you chose! (If nothing happens,
check the MIDI status light — which appears in
the time display — to see whether it blinks with
each note you play. If not, check the installation
of your MIDI connection and make sure that you
loaded any required drivers.)
Drag the playhead to a beat or two before the
spot in the timeline where you want your
recording to start. This gives you time to match
the beat. Then click the big red Record button
and start jamming or speaking! When you’re fin-
ished, click the Play button to stop recording.

Automatic Composition with 
Magic GarageBand
In a hurry? Too rushed to snag loops and tweak effects? Never fear,
GarageBand ’08 can even compose a song automatically! The new Magic
GarageBand feature provides a wide range of eight different genres of music
to choose from — everything from blues to reggae to funk and rock.
To create a new song automatically, follow these steps:
1. Press Ô+N to start a new project.
If you’re working on a song, GarageBand prompts you to save it before
closing the window.
2. Click the Magic GarageBand button on the Project Select dialog.
You see an imposing curtain, with a button for each song genre.
3. Click the desired genre button.
4. To hear the entire song with the default instruments, click Entire 
Song and then click the Play button.
Alternatively, to hear a short sample of the song, click Snippet and then
click the Play button.
5. Click Audition to switch instruments or use the default musical
arrangement.
The curtains open (as shown in Figure 15-11), and you see each 
individual instrument on stage. To choose a different musical style 
for an instrument (or a different variation of the instrument), click it, 
and then select the desired sound from the menu below the stage.
Click My Instrument (the empty space in the middle of the stage) to 
add your own voice or instrumental, using a microphone or MIDI 
instrument.
6. After the song fits like a glove, click Create Project to open the song 
as a project in GarageBand.
Now you can edit and tweak the song to your heart’s delight like any
other GarageBand project, adding other software or real instrument
tracks as necessary.

Sharing Your Songs and Podcasts
After you finish your song, you can play it whenever you like through
GarageBand. But then again, that isn’t really what you want, is it? You want to
share your music with others with an audio CD or download it to your iPod
so that you can enjoy it yourself while walking through the mall!
iTunes to the rescue! Just like the other iLife applications that I cover in this
book, GarageBand can share the music you make through the digital hub that
is your iMac.
Creating MP3 and AAC files
You can create digital audio files in MP3 or AAC format from your song or
podcast project in just a few simple steps:
1. Open the song that you want to share.
2. Choose Share➪Send Song to iTunes.
GarageBand displays the settings you see in Figure 15-12.

3. Click in each of the four text boxes to type the playlist, artist name,
composer name, and album name for the tracks you create.
You can leave the defaults as is, if you prefer. Each track that you export
is named after the song’s name in GarageBand.
4. From the Compress Using pop-up menu, choose the encoder that
GarageBand should use to compress your song file.
The default is AAC, but you can also choose MP3 encoding for greater
compatibility.
5. From the Audio Settings pop-up menu, choose the proper audio qual-
ity for the finished file.
The higher quality, the larger the file.
GarageBand displays the approximate file size and finished file informa-
tion in the description box.
6. Click Share.
After a second or two of hard work, your iMac opens the iTunes window and
highlights the new (or existing) playlist that contains your new song.

Sending a podcast to iWeb or iTunes
If you’ve prepared a new podcast episode in GarageBand, you can send it
automatically to iWeb or iTunes by following these steps:
1. Open the podcast that you want to export to iWeb.
Make sure that the Podcast track is displayed — if necessary, choose
Track➪Show Podcast Track to display it.
2. Choose Share➪Send Podcast to iWeb (or Share➪Send Podcast to
iTunes).
3. From the Compress Using pop-up menu, choose the encoder
GarageBand should use to compress your podcast file.
Your choices are AAC or MP3 format.
4. From the Audio Settings pop-up menu, choose the proper audio qual-
ity for the finished file.
5. Click Share.
Burning an audio CD
Ready to create a demo CD with your latest GarageBand creation, using your
iMac’s built-in optical drive? Follow these steps to burn an audio disc from
within GarageBand:
1. Open the song that you want to record to disc.
2. Choose Share➪Burn Song to CD.
3. Load a blank disc into your optical drive.
GarageBand includes an entire book’s worth of features, settings, and other
stuff, so there just isn’t enough space in a single chapter of this iMac-driven
tome to cover it all. If you’d like to dive in to everything that GarageBand
offers, I heartily recommend GarageBand For Dummies (Wiley), written by
fellow Mac guru Bob LeVitus. He can take you from one end of GarageBand to
the other in no time flat!

verybody wants a piece. (Of your iMac, that is.)
Perhaps you live in a busy household with kids, significant others, grandpar-
ents, and a wide selection of friends — all of them clamoring for a chance to
spend time on the Internet, take care of homework, or enjoy a good game.
On the other hand, your iMac might occupy a classroom or a break room at
your office — someplace public, yet everyone wants his own Private iDaho
on the iMac, complete with a reserved spot on the hard drive and his own
hand-picked attractive Desktop background.
Before you throw your hands up in the air in defeat, read this chapter and
take heart! Here you find all the step-by-step procedures, explanations, and
tips to help you build a safe multiuser iMac that’s accessible to all.
(Oh, and you still get to use it, too. That’s not being selfish.)
Once Upon a Time (An Access Fairy Tale)
Okay, so you don’t have Cinderella, Snow White, or that porridge-loving kid
with the trespassing problem. Instead, you have your brother Bob.

Every time Bob visits your place, it seems he needs to do “something” on the
Internet, or he needs a moment with your iMac to bang out a quick message,
using his Web-based e-mail application. Unfortunately, Bob’s forays onto your
iMac always result in stuff getting changed, like your Desktop settings,
Address Book, and Safari bookmarks.
What you need, good reader, is a visit from the Account Fairy. Your problem
is that you have but a single user account on your system, and Leopard
thinks that Bob is you. By turning your iMac into a multiuser system and
giving Bob his own account, Leopard can tell the difference between the two
of you, keeping your druthers separate!
With a unique user account, Leopard can track all sorts of things for Bob,
leaving your computing environment blissfully pristine. A user account keeps
track of stuff such as
 Address Book contacts
 Safari bookmarks and settings
 Desktop settings (including background images, screen resolutions, and
Finder tweaks)
 iTunes libraries, just in case Bob brings his own music (sigh)
 Web sites that Bob might ask you to host on your computer (resigned sigh)
Plus, Bob gets his own reserved Home folder on your iMac’s hard drive, so
he’ll quit complaining about how he can’t find his files. Oh, and did I mention
how user accounts keep others from accessing your stuff? And how you can
lock Bob out of where-he-should-not-be, such as certain applications, iChat,
Mail, and Web sites (including that offshore Internet casino site that he’s
hooked on)?
Naturally, this is only the tip of the iceberg. User accounts affect just about
everything you can do in Leopard and on your iMac. The moral of my little
tale? A Mark’s Maxim to the rescue:
Assign others their own user accounts, and let Leopard keep track of every-
thing. Then you can share your iMac with others and still live happily ever
after!™
Big-Shot Administrator Stuff
Get one thing straight right off the bat: You are the administrator of your
iMac. In network-speak, an administrator (or admin for short) is the one with
the power to Do Unto Others — creating new accounts, deciding who gets
access to what, and generally running the multiuser show. In other words,
think of yourself as the Monarch of Mac OS X. (The ruler, not the butterfly.)
266
Part V: Sharing Access and Information 

I always recommend that you have only one (or perhaps two) accounts with
administrator-level access on any computer. This makes good sense because
you can be assured that no one can monkey with your iMac while you’re
away from the keyboard. So why might you want a second admin account?
Well, if you’re often away on business, you might need to assign a second
administrator account to a trusted individual who knows as much about your
iMac as you do. (Tell ’em to buy a copy of this book.) That way, if something
breaks or an account needs to be tweaked in some way, the other person can
take care of it whilst you’re gone (but without giving that person access to
your personal data).
In this section, I explain the typical duties of a first-class iMac administrator.
Deciding who needs what access
Leopard provides three levels of individual user accounts:
 Admin (administrator): See the beginning of this section.
 Standard level: Perfect for most users, these accounts allow access to
just about everything but don’t let the user make drastic changes to
Leopard or create new accounts.
 Managed with Parental Controls level: These are standard accounts
with specific limits that are assigned either by you or by another admin
account.
Another Mark’s Maxim is in order:
Assign other folks standard-level accounts and then decide whether each new
account needs to be modified to restrict access as a managed account. Never
assign an account admin-level access unless you deem it truly necessary.™
Standard accounts are quick and easy to set up, and I think they provide the
perfect compromise between access and security. You’ll find that standard
access allows your users to do just about anything they need to do, with a
minimum of hassle.
Managed accounts (with Parental Controls) are highly configurable so you
can make sure that your kids don’t end up trashing the hard drive, sending
junk mail, or engaging in unmonitored chatting. (Note: Parents, teachers, 
and those folks designing a single public access account for a library or 
organization — this means you.)
Leopard also provides Group and Sharing Only accounts, but shy away from
these advanced levels. Stick with the Big Three levels to ensure that every-
one has the proper access to your iMac.
267
Chapter 16: Creating a Multiuser iMac

Adding users
All right, Mark, enough pregame jabbering — show this good reader how to
set up new accounts! Your iMac already has one admin-level account set up
for you (created during the initial Leopard set-up process), and you need to
be logged in with that account to add a user. To add a new account, follow
these steps:
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock and then click the
Accounts icon to display the Accounts pane that you see in Figure 16-1.
2. Click the New User button — the one with the plus sign at the bottom of
the accounts list — to display the new user sheet shown in Figure 16-2.
Figure 16-2:
Fill out those
fields, and
you have a
new user.
Figure 16-1:

268
Part V: Sharing Access and Information 

If your New User button is grayed out, your Accounts pane is locked.
Remember that you can toggle the padlock icon at the lower-left corner
of most of the panes in System Preferences to lock or allow changes. To
gain access, do the following:
a. Click the padlock icon to make changes to the Accounts pane.
b. When Leopard prompts you for your admin account password (the
account you’re currently using), enter it.
c. Click OK.
Now you can click the New User button.
3. Click the New Account pop-up menu and specify the account level
status.
Choose from Administrator, Standard, or Managed with Parental
Controls.
You should have only one or two administrator-level users, and your
account is already an admin account.
4. Type the name that you want to display for this account in the Name
text box. Press Tab to move to the next field.
Leopard displays this name on the Login screen, so behave! (For exam-
ple, Bob has only one “o” the last time I checked.)
5. (Optional) Although Leopard automatically generates the user’s short
name (for use in iChat, and for naming the user’s Home folder), you
can type a new one. (No spaces, please.) Press Tab again.
6. In the Password text box, type the password for the new account.
Press Tab to move to the next field.
Generally, I recommend a password of at least six characters, using a
mixture of alpha and numeric characters.
Run out of password ideas? No problem! Click the key button (to the
right of the Password text box) to display the Password Assistant, from
which Leopard can automatically generate password suggestions of the
length you specify. Click the Suggestion pop-up menu, or type directly
into the field, and Leopard automatically adds the password you’ve gen-
erated into the Password field.
7. In the Verify text box, retype the password you chose. Press Tab again
to continue your quest.
8. (Optional) Leopard can provide a password hint after three unsuccess-
ful login attempts. To offer a hint, type a short question in the
Password Hint text box.
269
Chapter 16: Creating a Multiuser iMac

From a security standpoint, password hints are taboo. (Personally, I
never use ’em. If someone is having a problem logging in to a computer 
I administer, you better believe I want to know why.) Therefore, despite
the recommendation Leopard shows here, I strongly recommend that
you skip this field — and if you do offer a hint, keep it vague! Avoid
hints like, “Your password is the name of the Wookie in Star Wars.” Geez.
9. Click the Create Account button.
The new account shows up in the list at the left of the Accounts pane.
Each user’s Home folder has the same default subfolders, including Movies,
Music, Pictures, Sites, and such. A user can create new subfolders within his
or her Home folder at any time.
Here’s one more neat fact about a user’s Home folder: No matter what the
account level, most of the contents of a Home folder can’t be viewed by other
users. (Yes, that includes admin-level users. This way, everyone using your
iMac gets her own little area of privacy.) Within the Home folder, only the
Sites and Public folders can be accessed by other users — and only in a 
limited fashion. More on these folders later in this chapter.
Modifying user accounts
Next, consider the basic modifications that you can make to a user account,
such as changing existing information or selecting a new picture to represent
that user’s unique personality.
To edit an existing account, log in with your admin account, display the
System Preferences window, and click Accounts to display the account list.
Then follow these steps:
1. Click the account that you want to change.
Don’t forget to unlock the Accounts pane if necessary. See the earlier
section, “Adding users,” to read how.
2. Edit the settings that you need to change.
For example, you can reset the user’s password, or (if absolutely neces-
sary) upgrade the account to admin level.
3. Click the Picture well and then click a thumbnail image to represent
this user (as shown in Figure 16-3).
270
Part V: Sharing Access and Information 

An easy way to get an image is to use one from your hard drive. 
Click Edit Picture and then drag a new image from a Finder window 
into the Picture well. (Alternatively, you could click Edit Picture and 
then click the Snapshot button — which bears a tiny camera — to 
grab a picture from your iSight video camera. After you capture the
essence of your subject as a photo, click Set to return to the Accounts
pane.)
Leopard displays this image in the Login list next to the account 
name.
4. When everything is correct, press Ô+Q to close the System Preferences
dialog.
Remember, there’s no need to save your changes (as a separate step)
within System Preferences. Leopard does that automatically when you
close the System Preferences window.
Standard-level users have some control over their accounts — they’re not
helpless, ya know. Standard users can log in, open System Preferences, and
click Accounts to change the account password or picture, as well as the My
Card assigned to them in Leopard Address Book. All standard users can also
set up Login Items, which I cover later in this chapter. Note, however, that
managed users might not have access to System Preferences at all, so they
can’t make changes. (Read about this in the upcoming section, “Managing
access settings for an account.”
Figure 16-3:

271
Chapter 16: Creating a Multiuser iMac

I banish thee, Mischievous User!
Not all user accounts last forever. Students graduate, co-workers quit, kids
move out of the house (at last!), and Bob might even find a significant other
who has a faster cable modem. We can only hope.
Anyway, no matter what the reason, you can delete a user account at any
time. Log in with your admin account, display the Accounts pane in System
Preferences, and then follow these steps to eradicate an account:
1. Click the account that you want to delete.
2. Click the Delete User button (which bears the Minus Sign of Doom).
Refer to Figure 16-2.
Leopard displays a confirmation sheet, as shown in Figure 16-4. By
default, the contents of the user’s Home folder are saved in a disk image
file — which you can restore with Disk Utility — in the Deleted Users
folder. (This safety is a good idea if the user might return in the future,
allowing you to retrieve their old stuff. However, this option is available
only if you have enough space on your hard drive to create the Home
folder image file.)
3. To clean up completely, select the Delete the Home Folder radio
button and then click OK.
Leopard wipes everything connected with the user account off your
hard drive.
4. Press Ô+Q to close the System Preferences dialog.
Figure 16-4:
This is your
last chance

272
Part V: Sharing Access and Information 

Time once again for a Mark’s Maxim:
Always delete unnecessary user accounts. Otherwise, you’re leaving holes in
your iMac’s security.™
Setting up Login Items 
and Parental Controls
Every account on your iMac can be customized. Understandably, some set-
tings are accessible only to admin-level accounts, and others can be adjusted
by standard-level accounts. In this section, I introduce you to the things that
can be enabled (or disabled) within a user account.
Automating with Login Items
Login Items are applications or documents that can be set to launch or load
automatically as soon as a specific user logs in — for example, Apple Mail or
Address Book. In fact, a user must be logged in to add or remove Login Items.
Even an admin-level account can’t change the Login Items for another user.
A user must have access to the Accounts pane within the System Preferences
window in order to use Login Items. As you can read in the following section,
a user can be locked out of System Preferences, which makes it more difficult
for Login Items to be added or deleted for that account. (Go figure.)
To set Login Items for your account, follow these steps:
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock and then click the
Accounts icon.
2. Click the Login Items tab to display the settings that you see in 
Figure 16-5.
3. Click the Add button (with the plus sign) to display a file selection
sheet.
4. Navigate to the application you want to launch each time you log in,
click it to select it, and then click Add.
If you’re in the mood to drag and drop, just drag the applications you
want to add from a Finder window and drop them directly into the list.
5. Press Ô+Q to quit System Preferences and save your changes.
Login Items are launched in the order that they appear in the list, so feel free
to drag the items into any order you like.
273
Chapter 16: Creating a Multiuser iMac

Managing access settings for an account
A standard-level account with restrictions is a managed account. (You can
read about these accounts earlier in this chapter.) With these accounts, you
can restrict access to many different places within Leopard and your iMac’s
applications via Parental Controls. (Naturally, admin-level accounts don’t need
Parental Controls because an admin account has no restrictions.)
In short, Parental Controls come in handy in preventing users — family mem-
bers, students, co-workers, friends, or the public at large — from damaging
your computer, your software, or Leopard itself. If an account has been
restricted with Parental Controls, the account description changes from
Standard to Managed in the Accounts list.
To display the Parental Controls for a standard account, start here:
1. Log in with an admin-level account.
2. Open System Preferences and then click Accounts.
3. Click the Standard account in the list and then select the Enable
Parental Controls check box.
Now click the Open Parental Controls button to display the specific cate-
gories (tabs) that you see in Figure 16-6:
 System: These settings (which I discuss in more detail in a second)
affect what the user can do within Leopard as well as what the Finder
itself looks like to that user.
Figure 16-5:

Items list.
274
Part V: Sharing Access and Information 

 Content: These settings control the Dictionary and Safari applications. If
you prefer that profane terms be hidden within the Dictionary for this
user, select the Hide Profanity in Dictionary check box to enable it.
Leopard also offers three levels of control for Web sites:
• Allow Unrestricted Access: Select this radio button to allow unfet-
tered access for this user.
• Try to Limit Access: You can allow Safari to automatically block
Web sites that it deems “adult.” To specify particular sites that
Safari should allow or deny, click the Customize button.
• Allow Access to Only These Websites: Select this radio button to
specify which Web sites that the user can view. To add a Web site,
click the Add button (which bears a plus sign); Leopard then
prompts you for a title and the Web site address.
 Mail & iChat: Select the Limit Mail and the Limit iChat check boxes to
specify the e-mail and instant-messaging addresses that this user can
communicate with. To add an address that the user can e-mail or chat
with, click the Add button.
If you want a notification if the user is attempting to send an e-mail to
someone not in the list, select the Send Permission Requests To check
box to enable it and then type your e-mail address in the text box.

Chapter 16: Creating a Multiuser iMac

 Time Limits: Parents, click the Time Limits button, and you’ll shout with
pure joy! You can limit an account to a certain number of hours of usage
per weekday (Weekday Time Limits), limit to a specified number of
hours of usage per weekend day (Weekend Time Limits), and set a bed-
time computer curfew time for both weekdays and weekend days.
 Logs: Leopard keeps a number of different types of text log files (which
track where the user goes on the Internet, which applications are
launched by the account, and the contents of any iChat conversations
where the user was a participant). From this central pane, you can moni-
tor all the logs for a particular account. Note that these logs are enabled
or disabled from other locations within Leopard: For example, the log
showing the Web sites visited and blocked is enabled from the Content
panel that I describe a little earlier, whereas the applications log is
enabled from the System panel. iChat logging is turned on from the
Preferences dialog within the iChat application.
You can always tell whether an account has been assigned Parental Controls
because the account description changes from Standard to Managed in the
Accounts list.
Of particular importance are the System controls. Click the System tab to
modify these settings:
 Use Simple Finder: The Simple Finder is a great idea for families and
classrooms with smaller children. For the ultimate in restrictive Leopard
environments — think public access or kiosk mode — you can assign
the Simple Finder to an account. Even the Dock itself is restricted, sport-
ing only the Finder icon, Trash, the Dashboard, and those folders that
allow users to access their documents and applications.
 Only Allow Selected Applications: When this option is enabled, you can
select the specific applications that appear to the user. These restric-
tions are in effect whether the user has access to the full Finder or just
the Simple Finder.
• To allow access to all the applications of a specific type: Select the
check box next to the desired group heading to enable it. This
includes iLife, iWork, Internet, Widgets, Other, and Utilities.
• To restrict access to all applications within a group: If a group head-
ing check box is enabled and you want to deny access to all the
applications in that group, clear the check box next to the heading
to disable it.
• To toggle restriction on and off for specific applications within these
groups: Click the triangle icon next to each group heading to
expand its list and then either mark or clear the check box next 
to the desired applications. Leopard denotes partial access within
a group — a mixture of full and restricted applications — with a
dash mark in the group heading check box.
276
Part V: Sharing Access and Information 

To locate a specific application, click in the Search box and type
the application name.
• To add a new application to the Allow list: Drag its icon from the
Finder and drop it in the list within the Other group. After you add
an application, it appears in the Other group, and you can toggle
access to it on and off like the applications in the named groups.
 Can Administer Printers: With this check box enabled, the user can
modify the printers and printer queues within the Print & Fax pane in
System Preferences. If disabled, the user can still print to the default
printer and switch to other assigned printers, but can’t add or delete
printers.
 Can Burn CDs and DVDs: Disable this check box to prevent the user
from recording CDs or DVDs via the built-in disc recording features in
Mac OS X. (Note: If you load a third-party recording program, such as
Toast, the user can still record discs with it.)
 Can Change Password: Enable this check box to allow the user to
change the account password.
If you’re creating a single standard-level account for an entire group of
people to use — for example, if you want to leave the machine in kiosk
mode in one corner of the office or if everyone in a classroom will use
the same account on the machine — I recommend disabling the ability
to change the account password. (Oh, and please do me a favor . . . don’t
create a system with just one admin-level account that everyone is sup-
posed to use! Instead, keep your one admin-level account close to your
bosom and create a standard-level account for the Unwashed Horde.)
 Can Modify the Dock: Enable this check box, and the user can add or
remove applications, documents, and folders from the Dock in the full
Finder. (If you don’t want the contents of the Dock changing according
to the whims of other users, it’s a good idea to disable this check box.)
Multiuser Rules for Everyone
After you’re hip on user accounts and the changes you can make to them,
turn to a number of topics that affect all users of your iMac — things like how
they log in, how a user can share information with everyone else on the com-
puter, and how each user account can be protected from unscrupulous out-
siders with state-of-the-art encryption. (Suddenly you’re James Bond! I told
you Leopard would open new doors for you.)
277
Chapter 16: Creating a Multiuser iMac

Logging on and off in Leopard 
For Dummies
Hey, how about the login screen itself? How do your users identify them-
selves? Time for another of my “Shortest books in the For Dummies series”
special editions. (The title’s practically longer than the entire book.)
Leopard offers four methods of logging folks in to your multiuser iMac:
 The username and password login: This is the most secure type of
login screen you’ll see in Leopard because you have to actually type
your account username and your password. (A typical hacker isn’t going
to know all the usernames on your iMac.) Press Return or click the Log
In button to compete the process.
When you enter your username and password, you see bullets instead 
of your password because Leopard displays bullet characters to ensure
security. Otherwise, someone could simply look over your shoulder and
see your password.
 The list login: This login screen offers a good middle of the road
between security and convenience. Click your account username in the
list and type your password when the login screen displays the pass-
word prompt. Press Return or click the Log In button to continue.
 Fast User Switching: This feature, as shown in Figure 16-7, allows
another user to sit down and log in while the previous user’s applica-
tions are still running in the background. This is perfect for a fast e-mail
check or a scan of your eBay bids without forcing someone else com-
pletely off the iMac. When you turn on Fast User Switching, Leopard 
displays the currently active user’s name at the right side of the Finder
menu bar.
To switch to another account
a. Click the current user’s name in the Finder menu (refer to Figure 16-7).
b. Click the name of the user who wants to log in.
Leopard displays the login window, just as if the iMac had been
rebooted.
The previous user’s stuff is still running, so you definitely shouldn’t
reboot or shut down the iMac!
To switch back to the previous user
a. Click the username again in the Finder menu.
b. Click the previous user’s name.
For security, Leopard prompts you for that account’s login password.
278
Part V: Sharing Access and Information 

 Auto login: This is the most convenient method of logging in but offers
no security whatsoever. Leopard automatically logs in the specified
account when you start or reboot your iMac.
I strongly recommend that you use auto login only if
• Your iMac is in a secure location.
• You are the only one using your iMac.
• You’re setting up a public-access iMac, in which case you want
your iMac to immediately log in with the public account.
Working in a public environment? Never set an admin-level account as
the auto login account. This is the very definition of ASDI, or A
Supremely Dumb Idea.
To set up a username/password or list login, open System Preferences, click the
Accounts icon, and then display the Login Options settings (see Figure 16-8).
Select the List of Users radio button for a list login screen, or select the Name
and Password radio button to require your users to type their full username 
and password.

Chapter 16: Creating a Multiuser iMac

To enable Fast User Switching, mark the Enable Fast User Switching check
box (as shown in Figure 16-8).
To set Auto Login, choose the account that Leopard should use from the
Automatic Login pop-up menu (as shown by the now-legendary Figure 16-8).
Logging out of Leopard all the way (without Fast User Switching) is a cinch.
Just click the Apple menu (Ú) and then choose Log Out. (From the keyboard,
press Ô+Shift+Q.) A confirmation dialog appears that will automatically log
you off in one minute — but don’t forget that if someone walks up and clicks
Cancel, he’ll be using your iMac with your account! Your iMac returns to the
login screen, ready for its next victim. Heed this Mark’s Maxim:
Always click the Log Out button on the logout confirmation dialog before you
leave your iMac.™
Interesting stuff about sharing stuff
You might wonder where shared documents and files reside on your iMac.
That’s a good question. Like just about everything in Leopard, there’s a
simple answer. The Users folder on your iMac has a Shared folder within 
it. To share a file or folder, it should be placed in the Shared folder.
You don’t have to turn on File Sharing in the Sharing pane of System
Preferences to use Shared folders on your iMac. Personal File Sharing 
affects only network access to your machine by users of other computers.
Figure 16-8:

280
Part V: Sharing Access and Information 

Each user account on your iMac also has a Public folder within that user’s
Home folder. This is a read-only folder that other users on your iMac (and
across the network) can access: They can only open and copy the files that it
contains. (Sorry, no changes to existing documents from other users, or new
documents from other users.) Every user’s Public folder contains a Drop Box
folder, where other users can copy or save files but can’t view the contents.
Think of the Drop Box as a mailbox where you drop off stuff for the other user.
Encrypting your Home folder can be fun
Allowing others to use your iMac always incurs a risk — especially if you
store sensitive information and documents on your computer. Although your
login password should ensure that your Home folder is off limits to everyone
else, consider an extra level of security to prevent even a dedicated hacker
from accessing your stuff.
To this end, Leopard includes FileVault, which automatically encrypts the con-
tents of your Home folder. Without the proper key (in this case, either your
login password or your admin’s master password), the data contained in your
Home folder is impossible for just about anyone to read. (I guess the FBI or
NSA would be able to decrypt it, but they’re not likely a worry at your place!)
The nice thing about FileVault is that it’s completely transparent to you and
your users. In other words, when you log in, Leopard automatically takes
care of decrypting and encrypting the stuff in your Home folder for you. You
literally won’t know that FileVault is working for you — which is how comput-
ers are supposed to work.
To turn on FileVault protection for a specific account, follow these steps:
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock and then click the
Security icon.
2. Click the FileVault button.
3. If necessary, click Set Master Password to create a master password.
You need to be logged in with an admin-level account to set a master
password. However, this needs to be done only once, no matter how
many accounts you’re hosting on your iMac. Using this master pass-
word, any admin-level user can unlock any Home folder for any user.
Before you move to Step 4, note that you must be logged in using the
account that requires the FileVault protection. (Therefore, if you had to
log in using your admin-level account to set a master password, you
have to log out and log in again using the account you want to protect.
Arrgh.)
281
Chapter 16: Creating a Multiuser iMac

4. Click the Turn on FileVault button.
5. Enter your account’s login password when prompted and then click OK.
6. Click the Turn on FileVault button on the confirmation screen.
7. After Leopard encrypts your Home folder and logs you out, log in
again normally.
You’re done!
Remember those passwords. Again, do not forget your account login pass-
word, and make doggone sure that your admin user never forgets the master
password! If you forget these passwords, you can’t read anything in your
Home folder, and even the smartest Apple support technician will tell you
that nothing can be done.

n my book, network access ranks right up there with air conditioning and
the microwave oven. Like other “I can’t imagine life without them” kinds of
technologies, it’s hard to imagine sharing data from your iMac with others
around you without a network. Sure, I’ve used a sneakernet (the old-fashioned
term for running back and forth between computers with a floppy disk), but
these days, Apple computers don’t even have floppy drives.
Nope, networking is here to stay. Whether you use it to share an Internet con-
nection, challenge your friends to a nice relaxing game of WWII battlefield
action, or stream your MP3 collection to other computers that use iTunes,
you’ll wonder how you ever got along without one. In this chapter, I fill you in
on all the details you need to know to get your iMac hooked up to a new (or
an existing) network.
What Exactly Is the Network Advantage?
If you have other family members with computers or if your iMac is in an
office with other computers (including those rascally PCs), here’s just a
sample of what you can do with a network connection:
 Share an Internet connection. This is the major reason why many families
and most small businesses install a network. Everyone can simultaneously

use the same digital subscriber line (DSL) or cable Internet connection
on every computer on the network.
 Share a printer. You say your fellow employee — or even worse, your
big sister — has a great printer connected to their computer? Luckily,
that printer can be shared with anyone across your network.
 Copy and move files of all sizes. Need to get a large iDVD project from
one Mac to another? With a network connection, you can accomplish
this task in just minutes. Otherwise you’d have to burn that file to a
DVD-R or use an external hard drive. A network connection makes copy-
ing as simple as dragging the project folder from one Finder window to
another.
 Share documents across your network. Talk about a wonderful collabo-
ration tool. For example, you can drop a Word document or Keynote pre-
sentation file in your Public folder and ask for comments and edits from
others in your office.
 Stream music and video. With iTunes, you can share your audio and
video media collection on your iMac with other Macs and PCs on your
network. Your eyes and ears can’t tell the difference!
 Play multiplayer games. Invite your friends over and tell ’em that you’re
hosting a LAN party (the techno-nerd term for a large gathering of game
players, connected through the same network, all playing the same mul-
tiplayer game. (Suddenly you’ll see firsthand just how devious a human
opponent can be.) Each participant needs to buy a copy of the same
game, naturally, but the fun you’ll have is worth every cent you spend.
Don’t forget the chips!
If your iMac isn’t within shouting distance of an existing network or you don’t
plan on buying any additional computers, stop right here — a lone iMac hang-
ing out in your home with no other computers around won’t need a network.
If you have just your iMac and an Internet connection (either through a
dialup modem or a high-speed DSL/cable modem) and you have no plans to
add another computer or a network printer, a network isn’t necessary.
The Great Debate: Wired versus Wireless
After you decide that you indeed need a network for your home or office, you
have another decision to make: Should you install a wired network (running
cables between your computers) or a wireless network? Heck, should you
throw caution completely to the wind and build a combination network with
both wireless and wired hardware?
284
Part V: Sharing Access and Information 

Your first instinct is probably to choose a wireless network for convenience.
After all, this option allows you to eliminate running cables behind furniture
(or in the ceiling of your office building). Ah, but I must show you the advan-
tages to a wired network as well. Table 17-1 shows the lowdown to help you
make up your mind.

As I call it, here are the advantages of choosing a wired or a wireless network
setup:
 Wired: Using a wired network offers two significant perks over a wire-
less network:
• Faster speeds: In general, wired networks that are compatible with
your iMac are many times faster than the fastest 802.11n wireless
connections.
The performance of a wireless connection can be compromised by
interference (from impeding structures, such as concrete walls;
and from household appliances, such as some wireless phones and
microwave ovens) and by distance.
• Better security: A wired network doesn’t broadcast a signal that can
be picked up outside your home or office, so it’s more secure.
Hackers can attack through your Internet connection. Hence the
section, “USE YOUR FIREWALL!,” later in this chapter.
 Wireless: A wireless connection really has only one advantage, but it’s a
big one: convenience (which, in this case, is another word for mobility for
all your networked devices).
Accessing your network anywhere within your home or office — without
cables — is so easy. You can also easily connect a wireless printer. And
when using an AirPort Express mobile Base Station, even your home
stereo can get connected to your MP3 collection on your iMac. Read
more about Base Stations later on.
285
Chapter 17: Building (Or Joining) a Network

Sharing Internet Access
Time to see what’s necessary to share an Internet connection. In this section,
I cover two methods of connecting your network to the Internet. (And before
you open your wallet, keep in mind that you might be able to use your iMac
to share your broadband connection across your network!)
Using your iMac as a sharing device
Figure 17-1 illustrates how you can use your iMac to provide a shared
Internet connection across a simple wireless network, using either
 A broadband DSL or cable connection
 An external USB dialup modem
I recommend sharing a dialup modem Internet connection only if you
have no other option. A dialup modem connection really can’t handle
the data transfer speeds for more than one computer to access the
Internet comfortably at one time. (In plain English, an external USB
modem that you add to your iMac isn’t fast enough for both you and
your significant other to surf the Web at the same time.) Sharing a dialup
connection just isn’t practical.
286
Part V: Sharing Access and Information 
Grafting wireless access to a wired network
Maybe you’re caught in the middle, choosing
between wired and wireless networking? Or
perhaps you’re already using a wired network
but would be absolutely thrilled by the idea of
sitting on your deck in the sunshine whilst
checking your e-mail on your laptop, unteth-
ered. By combining both technologies, you can
get the faster transfers of a wired network
between all the computers in your office and the
freedom you crave.
That is the configuration I use in my home office.
I use a wireless base station that also includes
a built-in wired switch, which is a very common
feature in today’s wireless routers and base sta-
tions. My family gets all the convenience a wire-
less network offers, and everyone can connect
to the Internet from anywhere in our house. On
the other hand, my office computers have the
faster performance and tighter security of a
wired network. Sassy indeed!

In either configuration, your iMac uses the Mac OS X Leopard built-in Internet
connection–sharing feature to get the job done, but your iMac must remain
turned on to allow Internet sharing. I show you how to do this in the upcoming
section, “Network Internet connections,” later in this chapter.

Chapter 17: Building (Or Joining) a Network

Using a dedicated Internet sharing device
Figure 17-2 illustrates how a broadband connection works if you use a dedi-
cated Internet sharing device (often called an Internet router) to connect to
your cable or DSL modem. You have to buy this additional hardware, but
your iMac doesn’t have to remain turned on just so everyone can get on the
Internet.
Internet routers usually include either wired or wireless network connections —
and many include both.
Setting up an Internet router is usually a pretty simple matter, but the config-
uration depends on the device manufacturer and usually involves a number
of different settings in System Preferences that vary according to the model
of router you’re installing. Grab a diet cola, sit down with the router’s manual,
and follow the installation instructions you’ll find there. (In some cases, you
may need to set up your cable or DSL modem as a bridge between your ISP
and your router, which should be covered in your modem and router manu-
als as well.)
Most Internet routers offer a DHCP server, which automatically assigns
Internet protocol (IP) addresses, and I strongly recommend that you turn on
this feature! (You can read more on DHCP later in the chapter, in the sidebar
titled, “The little abbreviation that definitely could.”)

What Do I Need to Connect?
Most normal folks — whom I define as those who have never met a network
system administrator, and couldn’t care less — think that connecting to a net-
work probably involves all sorts of arcane chants and a mystical symbol or
two. In this section, I provide you with the shopping list that you need to set
up a network — or connect to a network that’s already running.
Wireless connections
Today’s iMacs come complete with a built-in AirPort Extreme wireless card,
so if you already have an AirPort Extreme or Express Base Station, you’re set
to go. Otherwise, hold on tight while I lead you through the hardware require-
ments for wireless networking. (Kinda ironic, don’t you think?)
The maximum signal range — and effectiveness — of any wireless network
can be impeded by intervening walls or by electrical devices, such as
microwave ovens and some wireless phones, all of which can generate 
interference.
Connecting an iMac to an existing wireless network
Connecting an Intel iMac to an existing wireless network requires no extra
hardware because your hardware is already built in. (Whew. That was easy!)
Using a base station to go wireless
If you decide that you want to build your own wireless network, you eschew
cables, or you want to add wireless support to your existing wired network,
you need a base station. The base station can act as a bridge between com-
puters using wireless and your existing wired network. Such a wireless base
station will have either
 A port that can connect to your existing wired network’s switch
 A full built-in switch for wired connectivity (which means you can sell
your old wired Ethernet switch to your sister in Tucson)
And, of course, a base station can simply act as a central switch for your
wireless network (with no support for a wired network at all).
You can use either a cool Apple Base Station or a boring 802.11n generic wire-
less base station; however, the Apple hardware requires less configuration
and tweaking. (Sounds like a Mark’s Maxim!)
289
Chapter 17: Building (Or Joining) a Network

If you don’t want the hassle of tweaking PC hardware to accommodate your
aluminum iMac, buy Apple hardware and software.™
Apple Base Station models
As listed in Table 17-2, your iMac can work with four different Apple Base
Station models for wireless networking:
 AirPort Extreme
I recommend using AirPort Extreme if your network needs an enhanced
antenna, which provides greater range. You can read about connectivity
ranges in the upcoming Table 17-2.
 AirPort Express (as shown in Figure 17-3)
I recommend using AirPort Express if you want to
• Carry your wireless base station with you. Express is much smaller
than the other Apple Base Station models. (Think “party on the
patio” or a LAN gaming get-together at a friend’s house.)
• Connect your home stereo for wireless music streaming. You can use
the AirTunes feature in iTunes.
 Time Capsule
Apple’s Time Capsule unit isn’t just a wireless remote hard drive: It can
also act as a full AirPort Extreme Base Station. In fact, the wireless speci-
fications for a Time Capsule unit and an AirPort Extreme Base Station
are almost identical.
 AirPort (discontinued)
You might find an original 802.11b or 802.11g AirPort Base Station on
eBay or at a garage sale. Go ahead and pick it up if you want to save
cash unless you’re considering multiplayer gaming or using high-speed
file transfers over your wireless network.

Part V: Sharing Access and Information 

The 802.11n standard used by the AirPort Extreme, Time Capsule, and
AirPort Express Base Stations delivers a connection that’s several times
faster than the old AirPort Base Station’s 802.11b/802.11g standards.
802.11n is also compatible with all the older standards — 802.11b/a/g —
so I highly recommend that you stick with 802.11n in the future. It plays
well with others, and at warp speed to boot!

291
Chapter 17: Building (Or Joining) a Network

Installing an Apple Base Station is simple:
1. If you have a DSL or cable modem, connect it to the Ethernet LAN port
on the Base Station with an Ethernet cable.
2. If you have an existing wired Ethernet computer network using a
switch or router, connect it to the WAN (wide area network) port on
the Base Station with an Ethernet cable.
Only the AirPort Extreme and Time Capsule stations have a WAN port.
3. If you have a USB printer, connect it to the USB port on the Base Station.
As I mention in Table 17-2, older AirPort base stations didn’t have USB
ports.
I cover the steps to share a printer in the upcoming section, “Sharing a
network printer.”
4. Connect the power cable from the AC power adapter.
The AirPort Express and Time Capsule units have a built-in AC adapter,
so if you’re using one of these models, just plug the device itself into 
the wall.
5. Switch on your Base Station.
6. Run the installation software provided by Apple on your iMac.
Using non-Apple base stations
If any company other than Apple manufactured your wireless base station,
the installation procedure is almost certainly the same. (Naturally, you
should take a gander at the manufacturer’s installation guide just to make
sure, but I added many different brands of these devices and used the same
steps for each one.)
However, I should note that Apple wireless hardware uses a slightly different
security encryption standard than most PC wireless hardware, which results
in an extra hurdle when connecting to a non-Apple base station with your
iMac. (More on this in the next section. For now, just remember that I recom-
mend using Apple wireless hardware with your iMac whenever possible. It’s
just a little easier!)
Joining a wireless network 
As far as I’m concerned, the only two types of base stations on the planet are
Apple and non-Apple (which includes all 802.11n and 802.11g Base Stations
and access points). In these two sections, I relate what you need to know to
get onboard, using either type of hardware.
Apple AirPort Base Stations
To join a wireless network that’s served by any flavor of Apple Base Station,
follow these steps on each Mac with wireless support:
292
Part V: Sharing Access and Information 

1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock.
2. Click the Network icon.
3. From the Connection list on the left, click AirPort.
4. Mark the Show AirPort Status in Menu Bar check box.
5. Click the Apply button.
6. Press Ô+Q to quit System Preferences and save your settings.
7. Click the AirPort status icon (which looks like a fan) on the Finder
menu bar.
8. From the AirPort menu, choose an existing network connection that
you’d like to join.
The network name is the same as the network name you chose when
you set up your AirPort Base Station.
9. If you set up a secure network, enter the password you assigned to the
network during setup.
By the way, security is always A Good Thing, and I strongly recommend that
you enable the password encryption features of your Apple Base Station
while installing it! (Luckily, the Apple Base Station setup application leads
you through this very process.) In the words of an important Mark’s Maxim
Keep uninvited guests out of your network! Use your base station’s security
features and encrypt your data!™
Some wireless networks might not appear in your AirPort menu list. These
are closed networks, which can be specified when you set up your AirPort
Base Station. You can’t join a closed network unless you know the exact net-
work name (which is far more secure than simply broadcasting the network
name). To join a closed network, follow these steps:
1. Select Join Other Network from the AirPort menu.
To open the menu, click the AirPort status icon (which looks like a fan)
on the Finder menu bar.
2. Type the name of the network.
3. If the network is secured with WEP or LEAP encryption — the two
most popular security standards for protecting your data through
encryption — click the Security pop-up menu and select which type of
encryption is being used.
4. Enter the network password, if required.
293
Chapter 17: Building (Or Joining) a Network

To disconnect from an AirPort network, click the AirPort menu and either
 Choose Turn AirPort Off.
 Connect to another AirPort network.
In other words, if you choose another available AirPort network from the
AirPort menu, your iMac will automatically drop the previous connec-
tion. (You can only be connected to one wireless network at a time,
which makes Good Sense.)
Using non-Apple Base Stations
If you’re using your iMac to connect to a non-Apple base station, you might
need to follow a specific procedure that takes care of the slightly different
password functionality used by standard 802.11b/g/n hardware.
Leopard can take care of many potential wireless “language barriers” caused
by security encryption — the two most common forms are WEP and LEAP —
so whether you need to massage your password to connect to your non-Apple
base station depends on the specific hardware and encryption system that it
uses.
To read or print the latest version of this procedure, fire up Safari and visit
http://kbase.info.apple.com/index.html, searching on the number
106250. (This is the Apple Knowledge Base article number, which you can
type in the first search field.) This article provides the details on how to con-
vert a standard wireless encrypted password to a format that your AirPort
Extreme hardware can understand.
Wired connections
If you’re installing a wired network, your iMac already comes with most of
what you need for joining your new cabled world. You just connect the hard-
ware and configure the connection. Don’t forget that you also need cables
(check the sidebar, “Can I save money by making my own cables?”) and an
inexpensive Ethernet switch. (If you’re using an Internet router or other hard-
ware sharing device, it almost certainly has a built-in 4 or 8-port switch.)
Connecting iMac hardware to a wired network
Your Ethernet 10/100/1000 port (which looks like a slightly oversized modem
port) is located in the line of ports on the back of your iMac, ready to accept a
standard Ethernet Cat5/Cat5E cable with RJ-45 connectors. If you’re connecting
to an existing wired network, you need a standard Cat5/Cat5E Ethernet cable of
the necessary length. I recommend a length of no more than 25 feet because
cables longer than 25 feet are often subject to line interference (which can slow
down or even cripple your connection). You also need a live Ethernet port from
the network near your iMac. Plug the cable into your iMac, and then plug the
other end into the network port.
294
Part V: Sharing Access and Information 

Wired network hardware
If you don’t know your switch from your NIC, don’t worry. Here, I provide you
with a description of the hardware that you need for your wired network.
Wired network components
If you’re building your own wired network, you need
 A switch: This gizmo’s job is to provide more network ports for the
other computers in your network. They typically come in 4- and 8-port
configurations.
As I mention earlier in this chapter, most Internet routers (sometimes
called Internet sharing devices) include a built-in switch, so if you’ve
already invested in an Internet router, make doggone sure that it doesn’t
already come equipped with the ports you need before you go shopping
for a switch!
 A number of Ethernet cables: Exactly how many cables you need is
determined by how many computers you’re connecting. If you’re work-
ing with a gigabit Ethernet system, you need Cat5E or Cat6 cables. Cat6
cables provide better performance, but they are more expensive.
295
Chapter 17: Building (Or Joining) a Network
Can I save money by making my own cables?
You can either purchase premade Cat5 cables
(or Cat5E for gigabit Ethernet), or you can try to
make your own. However, you most definitely
don’t save money by making your own cables —
at least, not if you’re connecting computers that
are located within 25 feet or so of one another.
I strongly recommend that you buy premade
Cat5/5E Ethernet cables (which come in a
number of standard lengths) for two very impor-
tant reasons:
 You can be guaranteed that your cables
work.
 You don’t have to build the things yourself.
Nothing is harder to troubleshoot than a
shorted or faulty Ethernet cable — that’s
the voice of experience talking there.
If you’re wiring multiple rooms in your house or
office, you have to install your own cabling.
That’s when I suggest you either call your local
computer store for help or enlist the aid of
someone you know who has successfully
installed Ethernet cable. If you’re building a
home, you can get your home wired for an
Ethernet network at the same time as the AC
wiring is installed. (This route is expensive, 
but if you’re a computer maven, you’ll budget
that cost!)

Naturally, if you’re using a broadband Internet connection, you also have a
DSL or cable modem. These boxes always include a port for connecting to
your wired Ethernet network. (If you have one of the new breed of wireless
modems — which acts as a wireless base station — don’t panic because it
should also have a wired port for connecting to your existing switch.)
Wired network connections
After you assemble your cables and your router or switch, connect the
Ethernet cables from each of your computers to the router or switch, and
then turn on the device. (Most need AC power to work.) Check the manual
that comes with your device to make sure that the lights you’re seeing on the
front indicate normal operation. (Colors vary by manufacturer, but green is
usually good.)
Next, connect your cable or DSL modem’s Ethernet port to the WAN port on
your switch with an Ethernet cable. If your modem isn’t already on, turn it on
now and check for normal operation.
When your router or switch is powered on and operating normally, you’re
ready to configure Mac OS X for network operation. Just hop to the upcoming
section, “Connecting to the Network.” (How about that? Now you can add
network technician to your rapidly growing computer résumé!)
Joining a wired Ethernet network
After all the cables are connected and your central connection gizmo is
plugged in and turned on, you’ve essentially created the hardware portion of
your network. Congratulations! (Now you need a beard and suspenders.)
With the hardware in place, it’s time to configure Leopard. In this section, I
assume that you’re connecting to a network with an Internet router or switch
that includes a DHCP server. (Jump to the sidebar, “The little abbreviation
that definitely could,” for more on DHCP.)
Follow these steps on each Mac running Mac OS X that you want to connect
to the network:
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock.
2. Click the Network icon (under Internet & Network).
3. From the Connection list on the left, click Ethernet.
4. Click the Configure pop-up menu (see Figure 17-4) and choose Using
DHCP.

5. Click the Apply button.
The Apply button is grayed out in the figure because my Status (in this
dialog) is Connected.
Enjoy the automatic goodness as Mac OS X connects to the DHCP server
to obtain an IP address, a subnet mask, a gateway router IP address, and
a Domain Name System (DNS) address. (Without a DHCP server, you’d
have to add all this stuff manually. Ugh.)
A few seconds after clicking the Apply button, you should see the infor-
mation come up. You might also notice that the DNS Server field is
empty, but fear not because Mac OS X is really using DNS Server infor-
mation provided by the DHCP server.
6. Press Ô+Q to quit System Preferences and save your settings.
You’re on!
Connecting to the Network
All right! The hardware is powered up, the cables (if any) are installed and
connected, and you configured Leopard. You’re ready to start (or join) the
party. In this section, I show you how to verify that you’re connected as well
as how to share data and devices with others on your network.

Verifying that the contraption works
After you have at least two computers on a wired or wireless network, test
whether they’re talking to each other over the network by pinging them. (No,
I didn’t make up the term, honest.) Essentially, pinging another computer is
like yelling, “Are you there?” across a crevasse.
To ping another computer on the same network from any Mac running
Leopard, follow these steps:
1. Open a Finder window, click Applications, and then click Utilities.
2. Double-click the Network Utility icon to launch the application.
3. Click the Ping tab; see upcoming Figure 17-5.
4. In the Please Enter the Network Address to Ping text field, enter the
IP address of the computer that you want to ping.

You know, some technologies are just peachy.
(So much for my uber-tech image.) Anyway,
these 
well-designed 
technologies 
work
instantly, you don’t have to fling settings around
like wrapping paper on Christmas day, and
every computer on the planet can use them: Mac,
Windows, Linux, and even the laptops used by
funny-looking folks from Roswell, New Mexico.
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, or DHCP
for short, is about as peachy as it gets. This pro-
tocol enables a computer to automatically get
all the technical information necessary to join a
network. Let me hear you say, “Oh yeah!” Just
about every network device on the planet can
use DHCP these days, including Internet
routers, hubs, switches, and (go figure) Mac OS
X. Today’s networking hardware and operating
systems provide a DHCP server, which flings the
proper settings at every computer on the net-
work all by itself. Your Mac just accepts the set-
tings and relaxes in a placid networking nirvana.
In this book, you can bet the farm that I assume
you want to use DHCP and that your network
hardware supports it as well. That way, I won’t
spend 30 pages of this book leading you through
the twisting alleyways of manual network set-
tings. (If you’re really into such things, I spend
those 30 pages and explain every single techno-
wizard detail in my book Mac OS X Leopard All-
in-One Desk Reference For Dummies, [Wiley].
It’s about 800 pages long — hence the compre-
hensive angle.)
If you’re connecting to an existing network, tell
the network administrator that you’re taking the
easy route and using DHCP. One word of warn-
ing, however: Adding more than one DHCP server
on a single network causes a civil war, and your
system will lock up tight. Therefore, before adding
hardware with a DHCP server to an existing net-
work, ask that network administrator to make
sure that you aren’t making a mistake.

• If you’re pinging another Mac running Mac OS X, you can get the IP
address of that machine by simply displaying its Network pane within
System Preferences, which always displays the IP address.
• If you’re trying to ping a PC running Windows and you don’t know the IP
address of that machine, follow these steps:
a. Click Start, right-click My Network Places (XP)/Network (Vista) and
then choose Properties.
b. From the Network Connections window, right-click your Local Area
Network connection icon and then choose Status.
c. Click the Support tab.
The IP address of that PC is proudly displayed.
5. Select the Send Only x Pings radio button and enter 5 in the text field.
6. Click the Ping button.
• Yay!: If everything is working, you should see results similar to those
shown in Figure 17-5, in which I’m pinging my Windows server at IP
address 192.168.1.103, across my wired Ethernet network.
The address 192.168.1.xxx is a common series of local network IP
addresses provided by Internet routers, hubs and switches with
DHCP servers, so don’t freak if you have the same local IP address.
• Nay: If you don’t get a successful ping, check your cable connec-
tions, power cords, and Mac OS X settings. Folks using a wireless
connection might have to move closer to the network base station
to connect successfully, especially through walls.

Look, Ma,
I’m pinging!

Sharing stuff nicely with others
It works . . . by golly, it works! Okay, now what do you do with your all-new
shining chrome network connection? Ah, my friend, let me be the first to con-
gratulate you, and the first to show you around! In this section, I cover the
most popular network perks. (And the good news is that these perks work
with both wired and wireless connections.)
Network Internet connections
If your DSL or cable modem plugs directly into your iMac (rather than a dedi-
cated Internet sharing device or Internet router), you might ponder just how
the other computers on your network can share that spiffy high-speed broad-
band connection. If you’re running a wireless network, it comes to the rescue!
Follow these steps to share your connection wirelessly:
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock.
2. Click the Sharing icon (under Internet & Network).
3. Click the Internet Sharing entry in the Services list to the left of 
the pane.
4. From the Share Your Connection From pop-up menu, choose Ethernet.
5. Mark the AirPort check box (in the To Computers Using list).
Leopard displays a warning dialog stating that connection sharing could
affect your Internet service provider (ISP) or violate your agreement
with your ISP. I’ve never heard of this actually happening, but if you want
to be sure, contact your ISP and ask the good folks there.
6. Click Start in the warning dialog to continue.
7. Select the On check box next to the Internet Sharing entry in the
Services list.
8. Click the Close button to exit System Preferences.
Sharing an Internet connection (without an Internet router or dedicated hard-
ware device) through Mac OS X requires your iMac to remain on continu-
ously. This is no big deal if you’re using your iMac as a Web server — and
your iMac has absolutely no problem remaining on ad infinitum — but tell
others in your office or your home that the svelte iMac must remain on, or
they’ll lose their Internet connection!
If your iMac has an external USB modem, you can indeed share a dialup
modem Internet connection. Just don’t be too surprised if you quickly decide
to shelve the idea. Those dinosaurs are s-l-o-w beyond belief.
300
Part V: Sharing Access and Information 

Don’t forget that you won’t need to configure Internet sharing if your DSL or
cable modem connects to a dedicated sharing device or router. That snazzy
equipment automatically connects your entire network to the Internet.
Network file sharing
You can swap all sorts of interesting files with other Macintosh computers on
your network. When you turn on Personal File Sharing, Leopard lets all Macs
on the network connect to your iMac and share the files in your Public folder.
(Note: Sharing across a network is different from sharing a single computer
betwixt several people. I cover that environment in Chapter 16.)
Follow these steps to start sharing files and folders with others across your
network:
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock.
2. Click the Sharing icon.
3. Select the On check box next to the File Sharing service entry to
enable the connections for Mac and Windows sharing.
Other Mac users can connect to your computer by clicking Go in the
Finder menu and choosing the Network menu item. The Network window
appears, and your iMac is among the choices. If the other Macs are run-
ning Leopard, your iMac’s shared files and folders appear in a Finder
window, and they’re listed under the Shared heading in the Sidebar.
Windows XP users should be able to connect to your Mac from their 
My Network Places window, and Vista users can use the Network
window. (Users of pre-XP versions of Windows, head to the Network
Neighborhood.) Those lucky Windows folks also get to print to any shared
printers you’ve set up. (The following section covers shared printers.)
4. Click the Close button to exit System Preferences.
Leopard conveniently reminds you of the network name for your iMac at the
bottom of the Sharing pane.
Sharing a network printer
Boy, howdy, do I love describing easy procedures, and sharing a printer on a
Mac network ranks high on the list! You can share a printer that’s connected
to your iMac (or your AirPort Extreme, Time Capsule, or AirPort Express
Base Station) by following these very simple steps:
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock.
2. Click the Sharing icon.
301
Chapter 17: Building (Or Joining) a Network

3. Select the On check box next to the Printer Sharing service entry.
4. From the list at the right of the System Preferences window, select the
printer you want to share.
5. Click the Close button to exit System Preferences.
A printer that you share automatically appears in the Print dialog on other
computers connected to your network.
Running a Web site from a network
Web jockeys tell you that Mac OS X is a great platform for running a Web site
that you can access from either the Internet or your local network. In fact, it’s
ridiculously easy to engage the mind-boggling power of Leopard’s built-in
Apache Web server. (Keep in mind, however, that your iMac must always be
on and connected to the Internet, or your Web pages won’t be available to
your folks in Schenectady.)
To begin serving Web pages, follow these steps:
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock.
2. Click the Sharing icon.
3. Select the On check box next to the Web Sharing service entry.
4. Click the Close button to exit System Preferences.
To check out the default HTML page that ships with Apache, open the System
Preferences Sharing pane again and click the link that appears under the
heading Your Computer’s Website. Note that Leopard also creates a personal
Web site under your username, which is different from the default Web site
created by Apache. Click the link under the heading Your Personal Website to
display this page.
To add pages to your Web server, navigate to the Sites folder that resides in
your Home folder. Because this is the root of your Apache Web server, the
files that you add to this folder are accessible from your Web server.
Don’t forget that folks connecting to your Web site across the Internet must
use your public IP address! Your iMac’s IP address appears in the Built-in
Ethernet description on the Network pane in System Preferences. If you’re
using an Internet router or Internet connection sharing device, your public IP
address might be different, so the links on the Web Sharing pane might not
work for folks outside your local network. Check the documentation for the
device to determine how to find your actual public IP address. Also, your
router or sharing device might require you to specify which computer on
your network is to receive HTTP (Web) page requests and send the pages.
Again, this should be covered in the device manual.

Part V: Sharing Access and Information 

USE YOUR FIREWALL!
Yep. That’s the only heading in this entire book that’s all upper case. It’s that
important.
The following Mark’s Maxim, good reader, isn’t a request, a strong recommen-
dation, or even a regular Maxim — consider it an absolute commandment
(right up there with Get an antivirus application now).
Turn on your firewall now.™
When you connect a network to the Internet, you open a door to the outside
world. As a consultant to several businesses and organizations in my home-
town, I can tell you that the outside world is chock-full of malicious individu-
als who would dearly love to inflict damage on your data or take control of
your iMac for their own purposes. Call ’em hackers, call ’em delinquents, or
call ’em something I can’t repeat, but don’t let them in!
Leopard comes to the rescue again with the built-in firewall within Mac OS X.
When you use this, you essentially build a virtual brick wall between you and
the hackers out there (both on the Internet, and even within your local net-
work). Follow these steps:
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock.
2. Click the Security icon.
3. Click the Firewall tab.
4. Select the Allow Only Essential Services radio button to activate your
firewall.
5. Click the Advanced button.
6. Select the Enable Stealth Mode check box.
This is an important feature that prevents hackers from trolling for your
iMac on the Internet — or, in normal-speak, searching for an unprotected
computer — so it’s much harder for them to attack you.
7. Click OK.
8. Click the Close button to exit System Preferences.
Leopard even keeps track of the Internet traffic that you do want to reach
your iMac, such as Web page requests and file sharing. When you activate
one of the network features that I demonstrate in the preceding section,
Leopard automatically opens a tiny hole (called a port by net-types) in your
firewall to allow just that type of communication to your iMac.
303
Chapter 17: Building (Or Joining) a Network

For example, if you decide to turn on Web Sharing (as I demonstrate earlier),
Leopard automatically allows incoming Web access.
You can also add ports for applications that aren’t on the firewall’s Allow list.
This includes third-party Instant Messaging clients, multiplayer game servers,
and the like. Depending on the type of connection, Leopard will often auto-
matically display a dialog prompting you for confirmation before allowing
certain traffic, so most folks won’t need to do anything manually.
However, you can add a program manually to your list of allowed (or
blocked) Firewall ports. Follow these steps:
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock.
2. Click the Security icon.
3. Click the Firewall tab.
4. Click the Add button.
Leopard displays a standard File browsing sheet.
5. Browse to the application that requires access to the outside world — or
the application that you want to block from outside communication —
and click it to select it.
6. Click the Add button in the File sheet.
The application appears in the Firewall list. By default, it’s set to Allow
Incoming Connections.
7. If you want to block any incoming communication to the application,
click the Allow Incoming Connections pop-up menu and choose Block
Incoming Connections instead.
8. Click the Close button to exit System Preferences.

I
wish you weren’t reading this chapter.
Because you are, I can only surmise that you’re having trouble with your
iMac, and that it needs fixing. (The other possibility — that you just like read-
ing about solving computer problems — is more attractive, but much more
problematic.)
Consider this chapter a crash course in the logical puzzle that is computer
troubleshooting: namely, the art of finding out What Needs Fixing. You also see
what you can do when you just plain can’t fix the problem by yourself.
Oh, and you’re going to encounter a lot of Tips and Mark’s Maxims in this
chapter — all of them learned the hard way, so I recommend committing
them to memory on the spot!
Can You Troubleshoot? Yes, You Can!
Anyone can troubleshoot. Put these common troubleshooting myths to rest:
 It takes a college degree in computers to troubleshoot. Tell that to my
troubleshooting kids in junior high. They’ll think it’s a hoot because they
have Apple computers of their own in the classroom. You can follow all
the steps in this chapter without any special training.
 I’m to blame. Ever heard of viruses? Failing hardware? Buggy software?
Any of those things can be causing the problem. Heck, even if you do

something by accident, I’m willing to bet it wasn’t on purpose. It’s Mark’s
Maxim time:
Don’t beat yourself up — your iMac can be fixed.™
 I need to buy expensive utility software. Nope. You can certainly invest
in a commercial testing and repair utility if you like. My favorite is TechTool
Pro from Micromat (www.micromat.com), but a third-party utility isn’t
a requirement for troubleshooting. (I would, however, consider an
antivirus application as a must-have, and you should have one already.
Hint, hint.)
 There’s no hope if I can’t fix it. Sure, parts fail, and computers crash,
but your Apple Service Center can repair just about any problem. And
(ahem) if you backed up your iMac (like I preach throughout this book),
you’ll keep that important data (even if a new hard drive is in your future).
 It takes forever. Wait until you read the Number One Rule in the next
section; the first step takes but 30 seconds and often solves the prob-
lem. Naturally, not all problems can be fixed so quickly, but if you follow
the procedures in this chapter, you should fix your iMac (or at least
know that the problem requires outside help) in a single afternoon.
With those myths banished for good, you can get down to business and start
feeling better soon.
Basic Troubleshooting 101
In this section, I walk you through my Should-Be-Patented Troubleshooting
Tree as well as the Leopard built-in troubleshooting application, Disk Utility. I
also introduce you to a number of keystrokes that can make your iMac jump
through hoops.
The Number One Rule: Reboot!
Yep, it sounds silly, but the fact is that rebooting your iMac can often solve a
number of problems. If you’re encountering these types of strange behavior
with your iMac, a reboot might be all you need to heal
 Intermittent problems communicating over a network
 A garbled screen, strange colors, or screwed-up fonts
 The Swirling Beach Ball of Doom that won’t go away after several minutes
 An application that locks up
 An external device that seems to disappear or can’t be opened
308
Part VI: The Necessary Evils: Troubleshooting, Upgrading, Maintaining 

To put it succinctly, here’s a modest Mark’s Maxim:
Always try a reboot before beginning to worry. Always.™
If you’re in the middle of a document, try to save all your open documents
before you reboot. That might not be possible, but try to save what you can.
If you need to force a locked application (one that’s not responding) to quit
so you can reboot, follow these steps to squash that locked application:
1. Click the Apple (Ú) menu and choose Force Quit.
The dialog that you see in Figure 18-1 appears on your screen.
2. Click the offending application and then click the Force Quit button.
If you can get everything to quit, you should be able to click the Apple
menu and choose Shut Down (not Restart) without a problem.
If your iMac simply won’t shut down (or you can’t get the offending applica-
tion to quit), then do what must be done:
1. Press and hold your iMac Power button until it shuts itself off.
You have to wait about four seconds for your iMac to turn itself off.
2. Wait about ten seconds.
3. Press the Power button again to restart the computer.
Note that you should not simply pull your iMac’s power cord out of the AC
socket (or turn off your power strip) to turn it off — pressing and holding the
power switch on your iMac is a less destructive path to the same end.
Figure 18-1:

309
Chapter 18: It Just . . . Sits . . . There

After everything is back up, check whether the problem is still apparent. If
you use your iMac for an hour or two and the problem doesn’t reoccur, you
likely fixed it!
Special keys that can come in handy
A number of keys have special powers over your iMac. No, I’m not kidding!
These keys affect how your iMac starts up, and they can really come in handy
whilst troubleshooting.
Using Safe Boot mode
You can use Safe Boot mode to force Leopard to run a directory check of
your boot hard drive and disable any Login Items that might be interfering
with Leopard. Use the Shut Down menu item from the Apple (Ú) menu to
completely turn off your iMac, press the Power button to start the computer.
Then press and hold down the Shift key immediately after you hear the
startup tone. After Leopard has completely booted, restart your iMac again
(this time without the Shift key) to return to normal operation.
Startup keys
Table 18-1 provides the lowdown on startup keys. Hold the indicated key
down either when you push your iMac Power button or immediately after the
screen blanks during a restart. (As I just mentioned, the Shift key is the excep-
tion; it should be pressed and held down after you hear the startup tone.)

Why is rebooting so darned effective?
Rebooting fixes problems because it resets
everything. Your network connection, for exam-
ple, might be acting up or have timed out, and
rebooting restores it. Rebooting also fixes prob-
lems due to brownouts or those notorious AC
power flickerings that we all notice from time to
time. Such interruptions in constant juice might
not bother you or me (or your less-intelligent
toaster), but they can play tricks on your iMac
that rebooting will fix.

Some of the keys/combinations in Table 18-1 might never be necessary for
your machine, but you might be instructed to use them by an Apple techni-
cian. I’ll warrant that you’ll use at least the C startup key fairly often.
All hail Disk Utility, the 
troubleshooter’s friend
Leopard’s Disk Utility is a handy tool for troubleshooting and repairing your
hard drive. You can find it in the Utilities folder within your Applications folder.
Fire up Disk Utility and click the First Aid tab to bring up the rather powerful-
looking window shown in Figure 18-2.
311
Chapter 18: It Just . . . Sits . . . There
Danger, Will Robinson!
Many Disk Utility functions can actually wipe
your hard drives clean of data instead of repair-
ing them! These advanced functions aren’t
likely to help you with troubleshooting a prob-
lem with your existing volumes anyway.
Remember: Don’t use these Disk Utility functions
unless an Apple technician tells you to use them:
 Partitioning and erasing drives
 Setting up RAID arrays
 Restoring files from disk images

In the left column of the Disk Utility window, you can see
 The physical hard drives in your system (the actual hardware)
 The volumes (the data stored on the hard drives)
You can always tell a volume because it’s indented underneath the phys-
ical drive entry.
 Any CD or DVD loaded on your iMac
 USB or FireWire Flash drives
For example, in Figure 18-2, I have one hard drive (the 298.1GB entry) and
one USB Flash drive (the 3.7GB entry). The hard drive has two volumes
(Wolfgang and Mother), and the USB drive has one volume (MLC USB).
The information at the bottom of the Disk Utility window contains the specifi-
cations of the selected drive or volume . . . things like capacity, free space,
and the number of files and folders for a volume, or connection type and total
capacity for a drive.
Repairing disk permissions
Because Leopard is built on a Unix base, lots of permissions can apply to the
files on your drive — that is, who can open (or read or change) every applica-
tion, folder, and document on your hard drive. Unfortunately, these permissions
Figure 18-2:
The
physician 
of hard
drives —
Leopard’s
Disk Utility.
312
Part VI: The Necessary Evils: Troubleshooting, Upgrading, Maintaining 

are often messed up by wayward applications or power glitches or applica-
tion installers that do a sub-par job of cleaning up after themselves. And if
the permissions on a file are changed, often applications lock up or refuse to
run altogether.
I recommend repairing your disk permissions with Disk Utility once weekly.
Figure 18-3 shows a permissions repair sweep on my internal hard drive’s
volume.
Use these steps to repair permissions on your iMac’s hard drive:
1. Make sure that you’re logged in with an admin account.
2. Save and close any open documents.
Chapter 16 shows you how to log in as an admin user.
3. Double-click the Disk Utility icon in the Utilities folder.
4. Click the volume that you want to check.
5. Click the Repair Disk Permissions button.
I don’t worry about verifying. If something’s wrong, you end up clicking
Repair Disk Permissions, anyway. Just click Repair Disk Permissions; if
nothing pops up, that’s fine.
Figure 18-3:
A

Repair Disk
Permissions.
313
Chapter 18: It Just . . . Sits . . . There

6. To finish the process, always reboot after repairing permissions.
This shows you whether a problem has been corrected!
Repairing disks
Disk Utility can check the format and health of both hard drives and volumes
with Verify Disk — and, if the problem can be corrected, fix any error with
Repair Disk.
Using Disk Utility to repair your hard drive carries a couple of caveats:
 You can’t verify or repair the boot disk or the boot volume. This actu-
ally makes sense because you’re using that disk and volume right now.
To verify or repair your boot hard drive, you need to boot from your
Mac OS X installation disc by using the C startup key. (Refer to Table
18-1 for keys that come in handy.) After your iMac boots from the Mac
OS X installation disc, choose the Utilities menu and click Disk Utility.
You should be able to select your boot hard drive or volume, and the
Verify Disk and Repair Disk buttons should be enabled.
 You can’t repair CDs and DVDs. CDs and DVDs are read-only media and
thus can’t be repaired at all (at least by Disk Utility).
If your iMac is having trouble reading a CD or DVD, wipe the disc with a
soft cloth to remove dust, oil, and fingerprints. Should that fail, invest in
a disc-cleaning contrivance of some sort.
If you need to verify and repair a disk or volume, follow these steps:
1. If you need to repair your boot drive and volume, save all your open
documents and reboot from either an external drive or your Mac OS
X Installation disc.
2. Double-click the Disk Utility icon in the Utilities folder.
3. In the list at the left side of the Disk Utility window, click the disk or
volume that you want to check.
4. Click the Repair Disk button.
5. If changes were made (or if you had to boot from a disc or external
drive), reboot after repairing the disk or volume.
Mark’s iMac Troubleshooting Tree
As the hip-hop artists say, “Alright, kick it.” And that’s just what my iMac
Troubleshooting Tree is here for. If rebooting your iMac hasn’t solved the
problem, follow these steps in order (until either the solution is found, or you
run out of steps — more on that in the next section).
314
Part VI: The Necessary Evils: Troubleshooting, Upgrading, Maintaining 

Step 1: Investigate recent changes
This is a simple step that many novice Mac owners forget. Simply retrace
your steps and consider what changes you made recently to your system.
Here are the most common culprits:
 Did you just finish installing a new application? Try uninstalling it by
removing the application directory and any support files that it might
have added to your system. (And keep your applications current with
the most recent patches and updates from the developer’s Web site.)
From time to time, an application’s preference file — which stores all the
custom settings you make — can become corrupted. Although the appli-
cation itself is okay, it might act strangely or refuse to launch. To check
your preference files for signs of corruption, try scanning your iMac
applications with Preferential Treatment, a freeware AppleScript utility
by Jonathan Nathan, available from his Web site at www.jonn8.com/
html/pt.html. (Preferential Treatment will flag any dicey preference
files, setting them up for a quick trip to the Trash.)
 Did you just apply an update or a patch to an application? Uninstall
the application and reinstall it without applying the patch. If your iMac
suddenly works again, check the developer’s Web site or contact its
technical support department to report the problem.
 Did you just update Leopard by using Software Update? Updating
Leopard can introduce problems within your applications that depend
on specific routines and system files. Contact the developer of the appli-
cation and look for updated patches that bring your software in line with
the Leopard updates. (And use Software Update in automatic mode to
check for Mac OS X updates at least once weekly.)

This question seems to get a lot of attention on
Mac-related Internet discussion boards and
Usenet newsgroups — and the answer is a
definitive perhaps. (I know. That’s really helpful.)
Here’s the explanation. You shouldn’t lose a
single byte of data by reinstalling Mac OS X, 
so it’s definitely okay to try it. However, rein-
stalling Mac OS X isn’t a universal balm that
fixes all software errors because the problem
that you’re encountering might be due to a
buggy application, or a hard drive that’s going
critical, or a video card with faulty memory mod-
ules. If the trouble you’re having is due to a cor-
rupted Mac OS X System folder, reinstalling
Leopard might or might not fix the problem.
Therefore, the debate rages on. I would cer-
tainly follow the iMac Troubleshooting Tree all
the way to the end before I would even consider
reinstalling Leopard, and I would recommend
contacting an Apple support technician via the
Apple Web site before you take this step.

 Did you just make a change within System Preferences? Return the
options that you changed back to their original settings; then consult
Chapter 6 for information on what might have gone wrong. (If the setting
in question isn’t in Chapter 6, consider searching Leopard’s online Help
or the Apple support Web site for more clues.)
 Did you just connect (or reconnect) an external device? Try unplug-
ging the device and then rebooting to see whether the problem disap-
pears. Remember that many peripherals need software drivers to run —
and without those drivers installed, they won’t work correctly. Check
the device’s manual or visit the company’s Web site to search for soft-
ware that you might need.
If you didn’t make any significant changes to your system before you encoun-
tered the problem, proceed to the next step.
Step 2: Run Disk Utility
The preceding section shows how to repair disk permissions on your
Leopard boot drive.
If you’re experiencing hard drive problems, consider booting from your Mac
OS X Installation CD or DVD to run a full-blown Repair Disk checkup on your
boot volume.
Step 3: Check your cables
Cables work themselves loose, and they fail from time to time. Check all your
cables to your external devices — make sure that they’re snug — and verify
that everything’s plugged in and turned on. (Oh, and don’t forget to check for
crimps in your cables or even Fluffy’s teeth marks.)
If a FireWire or USB device acts up, swap cables around to find whether you
have a bad one. A faulty cable can leave you pulling your hair out in no time.
Step 4: Check your Trash
Check the contents of your Trash to see whether you recently deleted files or
folders by accident. Click the Trash icon on the Dock once to display the con-
tents. If something’s been deleted by mistake, drag it back to its original
folder, and try running the application again.
I know this one from personal experience. A slight miscalculation while
selecting files to delete made an application freeze every time I launched it.
Step 5: Check your Internet and network connections
Now that always-on DSL and cable modem connections to the Internet are
common, don’t forget an obvious problem: Your iMac can’t reach the Internet
because your ISP is down, or your network is no longer working!
316
Part VI: The Necessary Evils: Troubleshooting, Upgrading, Maintaining 

A quick visual check of your DSL or cable modem will usually indicate whether
there’s a connection problem between your modem and your ISP — for exam-
ple, my modem has a very informative activity light that I always glance at first.
However, if your iMac is connected to the Internet through a larger home or
office network and you can’t check the modem visually, you can check your
Internet connection by pinging www.apple.com, as shown in Figure 18-4.
1. Open your Utilities folder (inside your Applications folder).
2. Double-click Network Utility.
3. Click the Ping button.
4. Enter www.apple.com in the Address box.
5. Click Ping.
You should see successful ping messages similar to those in Figure 18-4.
If you don’t get a successful ping and you can still reach other comput-
ers on your network, your ISP is likely experiencing problems. If you
can’t reach your network at all, then the problem lies in your network
hardware or configuration.
Step 6: Think virus
If you made it to this point, it’s time to run a full virus scan — and make sure
that your antivirus application has the latest updated data files, too. Figure
18-5 illustrates my antivirus application of choice, Virus Barrier X from Intego
(www.intego.com), performing a full system scan. (If a virus is detected and
your antivirus application can’t remove it, try quarantining it instead, which
basically disables the virus-ridden application and prevents it from infecting
other files.)

Step 7: Disable your Login Items
Mac OS X might encounter problems with applications that you’ve marked as
Login Items within System Preferences. In this step, I show you how to iden-
tify login problems and how to fix ’em.
Checking for problems
It’s time to use another nifty startup key (refer to Table 18-1). This time, hold
down Shift after you hear the startup tone.
This trick disables your account’s Login Items, which are run automatically
every time you log in to your iMac. If one of these Login Items is to blame,
your iMac will simply encounter trouble every time you log in.
Finding the Login Item that’s causing trouble
If your iMac works fine with your Login Items disabled, follow this procedure
for each item in the Login Items list:
1. Open System Preferences, click Accounts, and then click the Login
Items button.
2. Delete the item from the list; then reboot normally.
You can delete the selected item by clicking the Delete button, which
bears a minus sign.
When your iMac starts up normally with Login Items enabled, you dis-
covered the perpetrator. You’ll likely need to delete that application and
reinstall it. (Don’t forget to add each of the working Login Items back to
the Login Items list!)

Part VI: The Necessary Evils: Troubleshooting, Upgrading, Maintaining 

Step 8: Turn off your screen saver
This is a long shot, but it isn’t unheard of to discover that a faulty, bug-ridden
screen saver has locked up your iMac. (If you aren’t running one of the Apple-
supplied screen savers and your computer never wakes up from Sleep mode
or hangs while displaying the screen saver, you found your prime suspect.)
Open System Preferences, click Desktop & Screen Saver, click the Screen
Saver button, and then either switch to an Apple screen saver or drag the Start
slider to Never.
If this fixes the problem, you can typically remove the screen saver com-
pletely by deleting the offending saver application in the Screen Savers folder
inside your Mac OS X Library folder. If you can’t find the screen saver applica-
tion, try typing the saver name in the Spotlight search box.
Step 9: Run System Profiler
Ouch. You reached Step 9, and you still haven’t uncovered the culprit. At this
point, you narrowed the possibilities to a serious problem, like bad hardware
or corrupted files in your Mac OS X System Folder. Fortunately, Leopard pro-
vides System Profiler, which displays real-time information on the hardware
in your system. Click the Apple menu and choose About This Mac; then click
More Info. Figure 18-6 illustrates a typical healthy result from one of the
Hardware categories, Disc Burning. Click each one of the Hardware categories
in turn, double-checking to make sure that everything looks okay.

Chapter 18: It Just . . . Sits . . . There

You don’t have to understand all the technical hieroglyphics. If a Hardware
category doesn’t return what you expect or displays an error message,
though, that’s suspicious. (If your iMac doesn’t have a specific type of hard-
ware onboard — including Bluetooth, Fibre Channel, PC Cards, PCI Card, or
Parallel SCSI hardware — you won’t get information from those categories.)
Diagnostics shows whether your iMac passed the Power On self-test.
Okay, I Kicked It, and It 
Still Won’t Work
Don’t worry, friendly reader. Just because you’ve reached the end of my iMac
tree doesn’t mean you’re out of luck. In this section, I discuss the online help
available on the Apple Web site as well as local help in your own town.
Apple Help Online
If you haven’t visited the Apple iMac Support site yet, run — don’t walk — to
www.apple.com/support/imac, where you can find
 The iMac Troubleshooting Assistant, which queries you on the symp-
toms being displayed by your iMac and offers possible solutions
 The latest patches, updates, and how-to tutorials for the iMac
 iMac and Mac OS X discussion boards, moderated by Apple
 Tools for ordering spare parts, checking on your remaining warranty
coverage, and searching the Apple Knowledge Base
 Do-it-yourself instructions (PDF files) that you can follow to repair or
upgrade your iMac
Local service, at your service
In case you need to take in your iMac for service, an Apple Store or Apple
Authorized Service Provider is probably in your area. To find the closest 
service, launch Safari and visit

I Want to Add Stuff
In This Chapter
 Adding memory
 Upgrading your hard drive
 Adding USB and FireWire devices
 Reviewing what add-ons are available
“N
o iMac is an island.” Somebody famous wrote that, I’m sure.
Without getting too philosophical — or invoking the all-powerful Internet yet
again — the old saying really does make sense. All computer owners usually
add at least one peripheral (external device), such as a joystick, an iPod, a
backup drive, or a scanner. I talk about the ports on your iMac in Chapter 1.
Those holes aren’t there to just add visual interest to the back end of your
treasured iMac. Therefore, I cover your USB and FireWire ports (and what
you can plug into them) in detail in this chapter.
Ah, but what about the stuff inside your aluminum supercomputer? That’s
where things get both interesting and scary at the same time. In this chapter,
I describe what you can add to the innards of your computer as well as how
to get inside there if you work up the courage to go exploring. (Don’t tell your
family or your friends, but adding memory to an aluminum iMac is as simple
as loosening a screw and pulling on a plastic tab. There’s actually nothing to
fear whatsoever.)
Here’s the trick: Just make it sound like an adventure from Mission:
Impossible, and folks will crown you their new resident techno-wizard!
More Memory Will Help
Hey, wait a second. No however stuck on the end? You mean for once, there
isn’t an exception? Aren’t all computers different? Hard as it is to believe, just
keep in mind this Mark’s Maxim:

More memory helps.™
Period. End of statement. No matter what type of computer you own, how old
it is, or what operating system you use, adding more memory to your system
(to the maximum it supports) significantly improves the performance of your
operating system (and practically every application that you run).
Memory maximizes the power of your computer: The more memory you
have, the less data your iMac has to temporarily store on its hard drive.
Without getting into virtual memory and other techno-gunk, just consider
that extra memory as extra elbowroom for your applications and your docu-
ments. (You can read how in Chapter 22.) Believe me, both Mac OS X and
Windows XP/Vista efficiently make use of every kilobyte of memory that you
can provide.
Figuring out how much memory you have
To see how much memory you have in your computer, click the Apple menu
(Ú) and choose About This Mac. Figure 19-1 shows the dialog.
At the time of this writing, the current crop of iMacs has sockets for two
PC2-5300 DDR2 SDRAM memory modules. (Don’t fret over what all the abbre-
viations mean. Rest assured that this memory type is fast.) Each module can
range up to 2GB of memory, so you can install as much as 4GB of memory on
your iMac.
How you plan memory upgrades depends on how much memory you want. If
your iMac uses the single default 1GB module supplied by Apple, you have a
couple of options:
Figure 19-1:
Find out
how much

has.
324
Part VI: The Necessary Evils: Troubleshooting, Upgrading, Maintaining 

 Add up to 2GB of RAM by inserting a 1GB or a 2GB memory module in
the empty slot. At the time of this writing, a gigabyte memory module
should set you back about $100 or so.
2GB of memory is plenty for running applications from the iLife and
iWork suites as well as any of the applications bundled with Leopard.
 Install up to 4GB of total memory by removing the standard 1GB
module and inserting high-capacity 2GB modules in both slots.
If your primary applications include video editing, game playing, or
image editing, you can use all the memory your iMac can hold.
Unfortunately, Apple’s prices for RAM are . . . well . . . outrageous. (As in, “Boy
howdy, I can’t afford that!”) Therefore, I can heartily recommend any one of
these online sources that cater to Mac owners:
 MacMall (www.macmall.com)
 CDW (www.cdw.com/content/brands/apple/default.aspx)
 Newegg (www.newegg.com)
Installing memory modules
I’m happy to report that adding extra memory to your system is one of the
easiest internal upgrades that you can perform. Therefore, I recommend that
you add your own memory yourself unless you simply don’t want to mess
with your iMac’s internal organs. Your local Macintosh service specialist will
be happy to install new RAM modules for you (for a price).
325
Chapter 19: I Want to Add Stuff
Getting inside your iMac
Apple designed the world’s best all-in-one com-
puter. That even includes making it EZ-Open.
(Forgive me if your treasured work of art now
reminds you of a longneck beer bottle. Come to
think of it, the level of technical knowledge
required to gain access to either one is about
the same.)
Unlike earlier “picture frame” iMac models,
however, you can’t remove the back completely.
In fact, Apple allows the owner of an iMac to
perform only one kind of upgrade, and there’s
only one opening you need to worry about.
(Note: You’ll void your warranty by removing the
back of your iMac, so don’t even think about it.)
Naturally, an Apple repair technician can get
deeper into the machine, but I hope that you
never need aid from those folks.

To add memory modules to an aluminum iMac, follow these steps:
1. Get ready to operate.
a. Spread a clean towel on a stable work surface, like your kitchen
table. The towel helps protect your screen from scratches.
b. Find a Phillips screwdriver.
c. Shut down your iMac.
d. Unplug all cables from the computer.
2. Tilt the computer over and lay the screen flat (face-down) on top of
the towel.
3. Loosen the screw at the bottom of the computer’s case.
Apple thought of everything! There’s only one tiny screw, and you can’t
lose said screw because it’s captive. It actually stays in the door, so don’t
try to remove it completely.
4. Remove the RAM access door.
5. Stow the RAM access door safely out of reach of kids and cats.
Tah-dah! That wasn’t much of a challenge, was it? Here’s your chance to gaze
with rapt fascination at a small portion of the bare innards of your favorite
computer.
1. Ground thyself!
Check out the sidebar, “Let’s get grounded!”.
326
Part VI: The Necessary Evils: Troubleshooting, Upgrading, Maintaining 
Let’s get grounded!
Follow one cardinal rule when the unguarded
insides of any computer are in easy reach:
Always ground yourself before you touch any-
thing! Your body can carry enough static elec-
tricity to damage the RAM you’re installing or
removing, and touching those modules without
grounding yourself is an invitation for disaster.
Grounding yourself is easy to do: Just touch any
metal surface around your work table, such as
a chair leg or your local metal sink. After you
ground yourself, you can then safely handle
RAM chips that you remove (if any) as well as
the new ones that you’re installing.
If you walk anywhere in the room — say, hunt-
ing for a screwdriver, or taking a sip of liquid
reinforcement that you stashed a comfortable
and safe distance away — you must ground
yourself again before you get back to work.
Remember: You can actually pick up a static
charge by simply walking. Go figure.

2. If you need to remove a module for your upgrade, untuck the tab over
the existing module.
3. Gently pull on the tab to remove the module (as shown in Figure 19-2).
Save the old module in the static-free packaging that held the new
module. Your old RAM (which you can now sell on eBay) will be pro-
tected from static electricity.
4. Position the new module(s) in the socket(s).
a. Line up the module’s copper connectors toward the socket.
b. Line up the notch in the module aligned with the matching spacer in
the socket. See what I mean in Figure 19-3.
5. Press gently (but firmly) on both ends of the module until the
module’s tabs click into place on both ends of the socket.
6. Tuck any loose tabs back into the body of your iMac.
7. Replace the RAM access door, reversing Steps 3–5 of the preceding
step list.
Waxing nostalgic: This is rather like changing the oil on my Dad’s 1970
Ford pickup truck.

Congratulations! You’ve done it — you’re now an iMac memory guru! To
verify that all is well with your iMac, boot the computer and once again click
the Apple menu and choose About This Mac. Your iMac should report the
additional memory.
Can I Upgrade My Hard Drive?
Asking whether you can upgrade your hard drive is a trick question. Yes, you
certainly can upgrade your hard drive. But before you start cruisin’ the
Internet for a 500GB monster, though, I have two suggestions:
 Be sure you really need a hard drive upgrade.
Apple is pretty generous when configuring hard drive storage for its
base systems. (Current models run with anywhere from a 250GB to a
whopping 1TB drive — yep, that’s 1 terabyte, or 1000GB! Something tells
me that your prized walnut brownie recipe will have plenty of elbow
room on a 1TB drive, as will a huge amount of digital video.)

328
Part VI: The Necessary Evils: Troubleshooting, Upgrading, Maintaining 

I’ll be honest here: Most folks simply don’t need more than 250GB of
hard drive space. You’re likely to find that you still have plenty of wide
open spaces for a typical family’s needs on your hard drive unless you’re
heavily into
• Digital video (DV)
• Cutting-edge video games
• Tons of high-quality digital audio
 If you decide that you do need to upgrade, don’t install your internal
hard drive yourself.
Read more about this in the upcoming section, “Gotta have internal.”
If you’re short on hard drive space, clean up your existing hard drive by
deleting all the crud you don’t need, such as game and application demos,
duplicate or “work” copies of images and documents, archived files you
downloaded from the Internet, and the contents of your Trash. You can read
how in Chapter 20.
Consider your external options
If you do need additional hard drive space, I recommend using an external
drive! Use a high-speed FireWire or USB port to connect a second hard drive
the quick and easy way.
Most of today’s FireWire and USB peripherals don’t even require the driver
software that Mac old-timers remember with such hatred. You simply plug in
a FireWire or USB device, and it works. You can move your external drive
between different Macs with a minimum of fuss and bother.
An external hard drive can do anything that your internal hard drive can do.
You can boot from it, for example, or install a different version of Mac OS X
(great for beta testers like me).
Apple’s Time Capsule unit is an external hard drive with a difference — it
stores the huge Time Machine backup files created by the Macs running
Leopard on your network, and it uses a wireless connection to transfer data!
(In fact, if you’re thinking of adding a wireless base station to your wired net-
work, your Time Capsule actually acts as a full AirPort Extreme base station,
complete with USB port for connecting a USB printer.) At the time of this writ-
ing, Time Capsule is available with either a 500GB ($299) or 1TB ($499) drive.
329
Chapter 19: I Want to Add Stuff

Here’s one problem with external drives: Data transfers more slowly this way
than via an internal drive (even with a FireWire 800 connection). That’s why
most Mac owners use their external drives for storing little-used documents
and applications. Their favorite applications and often-used documents are
housed on the internal drive.
Putting a port to work
An aluminum iMac carries three kinds of high-speed ports, any of which is a
good match for connecting any external device.
USB 2.0
The USB standard is popular because it’s just as common in the PC world as
in the Mac world. (Most PCs don’t have a FireWire port.) Your iMac carries 
its USB 2.0 ports on the back of the case and on the ends of the keyboard.
Hardware manufacturers can make one USB device that works on both types
of computers.
I heartily recommend that you avoid using any USB 1.1 devices (except, per-
haps, a USB 1.1 keyboard or mouse). USB 1.1 is very slow compared with the
USB 2.0 standard although you can connect a USB 1.1 device to a USB 2.0 port
with no problem at all. You should buy only USB 2.0 external hard drives,
CD/DVD recorders, or Flash drives. ’Nuff said.
FireWire 400
The original FireWire (also called IEEE 1394) is the best port for most digital
video camcorders. Use your FireWire port for connecting external devices to
your iMac — you’ll find it on the back of your iMac’s case.
FireWire 800
A FireWire 800 drive offers much better performance than either a FireWire
400 or a USB 2.0 drive, and today’s FireWire 800 drives are getting cheaper
every day. Your iMac proudly sports a FireWire 800 port on the back.
The physical FireWire 800 connector is shaped differently than the FireWire
400 port, so don’t try to force the wrong connector into the wrong port!
Connecting an external drive
With FireWire or USB, you can install an external hard drive without opening
your iMac’s case. With your iMac turned on and the external drive discon-
nected from the AC outlet, follow these steps:
1. Connect the FireWire or USB cable betwixt the drive and your computer.
2. Plug the external drive into a convenient surge protector or UPS
(uninterruptible power supply).
3. Switch on the external drive.
330
Part VI: The Necessary Evils: Troubleshooting, Upgrading, Maintaining 

4. If the drive is unformatted (or formatted for use under Windows), par-
tition and format the external drive.
The drive comes with instructions or software for you to do this. (Don’t
worry, your external drive comes from the factory completely empty,
and you won’t damage anything by formatting it.) Partitioning divides
the new drive into one (or more) volumes, each of which is displayed 
as a separate hard drive under Leopard.
If the drive comes preformatted for use with a Windows PC, I strongly
suggest reformatting it for use with Mac OS X — this will result in faster
performance and more efficient use of space.
After the drive is formatted and partitioned, it immediately appears on the
Desktop. Shazam!
Gotta have internal
If you decide that you have to upgrade your existing internal hard drive — 
or if your internal drive fails and needs to be replaced — you must take your
iMac to an authorized Apple service center and allow the techs there to sell
you a drive and make the swap. Here are four darned good reasons why:
 Warranty: As I mention in the sidebar, “Getting inside your iMac,” you’re
very likely to void your iMac’s warranty by attempting a drive upgrade
yourself.
 Selection: If you’re worried about picking the proper drive, an Apple
technician can order the right drive type and size for you . . . no worries.
 Difficulty: Swapping a hard drive in your iMac is nothing like adding
RAM modules. It’s complex and involves breaking into your iMac — not
A Good Thing, even for the knowledgeable Mac guru.
 Backup: That very same Apple service technician can back up all the
data on your existing drive and move it to the new drive, saving you
from losing a single document. That will save you time and possible
angst.
To those who truly won’t be satisfied with their lives until they upgrade an
internal drive in an iMac: Yes, I’m sure you can find a magazine article that
purports to show you how. Even better, I’ve seen many how-to articles on the
Web that will lead you down a rosy path to a hard drive upgrade. Here’s my
take on those savvy instructions: You’re walking into a field of land mines
with someone else’s map, so you had better have complete faith in your tech
skills. (And a darn good backup.)
331
Chapter 19: I Want to Add Stuff

Attractive Add-Ons
The USB and FireWire toys I cover in this section might add a cord or two to
your collection at the back of your iMac, but they’re well worth the invest-
ment. And they can really revolutionize how you look at technologies, such
as television, digital audio, and computer gaming.
Game controllers
If you’re ready to take a shot at the enemy — whether they be Nazi soldiers,
chittering aliens, or the latest jet fighters — you’ll likely find your keyboard
and mouse somewhat lacking. (And if that enemy happens to be a friend of
yours playing across the Internet, you’ll be ruthlessly mocked while you’re
fumbling for the right key combination.) Instead, either pick up a USB joystick
(for flying games) or a gamepad (for arcade and first-person shooting games)!
Video controllers
For armchair directors, specialized USB digital video controllers make editing
easier. The ShuttleXpress from Contour Design (www.contourdesign.com)
provides a five-button jog control that can be configured to match any DV
editor. For $60, you’ll have the same type of editing controller as do those
dedicated video-editing stations that cost several thousand dollars.
Audio hardware
Ready to put GarageBand to the test with your favorite version of Chopsticks?
You need a USB piano keyboard, and I recommend the Keystation 49e from 
M-Audio (www.m-audio.com), which retails for a mere $130. It provides 49
keys and uses a USB connection.
Another neat audio favorite of mine is the USB-powered radio SHARK 2 from
Griffin Technology (www.griffintechnology.com), which allows you to
add AM/FM radio to your iMac, complete with recording capability, a pause
feature, and scheduled recording, all for $50.

Tackling the Housekeeping
In This Chapter
 Cleaning unnecessary stuff off your hard drive
 Backing up your data
 Fixing permission errors
 Automating tasks in Leopard
 Updating Mac OS X automatically
N
othing runs better than a well-oiled machine, and your iMac is no
exception. With a little Leopard maintenance, you can ensure that your
iMac is performing as efficiently as possible.
In this chapter, I demonstrate how you can make good use of every byte of
storage space provided by your hard drive, as well as how to back up and
restore that hard drive to an external drive, using Time Machine. Your hard
drive also benefits from a periodic scan for permission errors.
Leopard’s Automator application is a great housekeeping tool: It allows your
iMac to perform tasks automatically that used to require your attention. I
show you how you can create Automator applications and set them up to run
by themselves. (It sounds a little spooky, but you’ll have a ball!)
And it’s important to never forget about updating Mac OS X itself. But then
again, if you configure Software Update to run automatically, you can live life
free and easy, watching your favorite soaps and eating ice cream (or yogurt —
your pick).
Cleaning Unseemly Data Deposits
Criminy! Where does all this stuff come from? Suddenly that spacious 250GB
hard drive has 19GB left, and you start feeling pinched.

Before you consider buying a new internal or external hard drive (which you
can read about in Chapter 20), take the smart step: “Sweep” your hard drive
clean of unnecessary and space-hogging software.
Getting dirty (or, cleaning 
things the manual way)
If you’re willing to dig into your data a little, there’s no reason to buy addi-
tional software to help you clean up your hard drive. All you really need is
the willpower to announce, “I simply don’t need this application any longer.”
(And, sometimes, that’s tougher than it might seem.)
Unnecessary files and unneeded folders
Consider all the stuff that you probably don’t really need:
 Game demos and shareware that you no longer play (or even remember)
 Movie trailers and other QuickTime video files that have long since
passed into obscurity
 Temporary files that you created and promptly forgot
 Log files that chronicle application installations and errors
 StuffIt archives that you downloaded and no longer covet
 iTunes music that no longer appeals to your ear
How hard is it to clean this stuff off your drive? Easier than you might think!
 You can easily delete files.
 You can get rid of at least the lion’s share of any application (often the
whole application) by deleting its application folder that was created
during the installation process.
Removing an application or file from your hard drive is usually two simple
steps:
1. Display the file or application folder in a Finder window.
2. Delete the file or folder with one of these steps:
• Drag the icon to the Trash.
• Press Ô+Delete.
• Right-click the icon and choose Move to Trash.
• Select the icon and click the Delete button on the Finder toolbar (if
you added one).

Truly, no big whoop.
Mac owners like you and me can once again feel superior to the XP and Vista
Zombies because most Mac OS X applications don’t need a separate, silly
“uninstall” program. In fact, Macintosh software developers have always fol-
lowed a simple general rule: All (or virtually all) of an application’s support
data should reside in a single folder.
Don’t forget to actually empty the Trash, or you’ll wonder why you aren’t
regaining any hard drive space. (Leopard works hard to store the contents 
of the Trash until you manually delete it, just in case you want to undelete
something.) To get rid of that stuff permanently and reclaim the space, do 
the followng:
1. Click the Trash icon on the Dock and hold down the mouse button —
or right-click — until the pop-up menu appears.
2. Choose Empty Trash.
Associated files in other folders
Some applications install files in different locations across your hard drive.
(Applications in this category include Microsoft Office and Photoshop.) How
can you clear out these “orphan” files after you delete the application folder?
The process is a little more involved than deleting a single folder, but it’s still
no big whoop. Here’s the procedure:
1. Click the Search text box in a Finder window.
You can read more about Search and Finder windows in Chapter 7.
2. Type the name of the application in the Search text box.
Figure 20-1 shows this search. I want to remove Toast Titanium, so I
search for every file with the word toast in its name.
3. Decide which of these files belong to the to-be-deleted application. 
Be sure that the files you choose to delete are part of the deleted appli-
cation. For example, a text file with the name Instructions on Making a
Perfect Piece of Toast might not be part of Toast Titanium.
Many associated files either
• Have the same icon as the parent application
• Are in the Preferences, Caches, or Application Support folders
335
Chapter 20: Tackling the Housekeeping

4. In the Search Results window, click the associated file(s) that you
want to delete and just drag them to the Trash.
Don’t empty the Trash immediately after you delete these files. Wait a
few hours or a day. That way, if you realize that you deleted a file that
you truly need, you can easily restore it from the Trash.
Using a commercial cleanup tool
If you’d rather use a commercial application to help you clean up your 
hard drive, a number of them are available, but most are shareware and 
perform only one task. For example, Tidy Up! from Hyperbolic Software
(www.hyperbolicsoftware.com) finds only duplicate files on your hard
drive, matching by criteria such as filename, size, and extension. It’s a good
tool at $30.
For a truly comprehensive cleanup utility, I recommend Spring Cleaning, from
Smith Micro Software (my.smithmicro.com), the same company that pro-
duces the archiving utility StuffIt. Figure 20-2 illustrates the main menu of
Spring Cleaning, which sells for $50. Not much crud squeaks by all those
search routines, including duplicates, orphan preference files, and log files.
Spring Cleaning even includes a separate feature called MacUninstaller that
can help automate the steps that I cover in the preceding section.

Backing Up Your Treasure
Do it.
I’m not going to lecture you about backing up your hard drive . . . well, per-
haps just for a moment. Imagine what it feels like to lose everything — names,
numbers, letters, reports, presentations, saved games, photographs, and
music. Then ask yourself, “Self, isn’t all that irreplaceable stuff worth just a
couple of hours every month?”
Time for a Mark’s Maxim:
Back up. On a regular basis. Then store those DVDs or that external backup
device somewhere safe, away from calamities.™
Take my word for it — you will thank me some day!
You can back up your files either by saving them to external media or by
using Leopard’s awesome new Time Machine feature.

Chapter 20: Tackling the Housekeeping

Saving Files
The simplest method of backing up files is simply to copy the files and fold-
ers to an external hard drive or a CD or DVD. Nothing fancy, but it works.
Backing up to an external hard drive
If you have an external hard drive on your iMac, you can easily drag backup
files to it from your internal hard drive:
1. Open separate Finder windows for
• The external hard drive
• The internal hard drive
2. Select the desired files that you want to back up from your internal
drive.
3. Drag the selected files to the external drive window.
Chapter 19 covers external hard drives.
Backing up to CD and DVD
You can burn backup files to a recordable CD or DVD.
Burning backups from the Finder
To use the Finder’s Burn feature with a CD or DVD, follow these steps:
1. Load a blank disc into your iMac’s optical drive.
If you’re using the default settings in the CDs & DVDs pane in System
Preferences, a dialog asks you for a disc name.
2. Into the disc’s Finder window, drag the files and folders that you want
to back up.
They can be organized any way you like. Don’t forget that the total
amount of data shouldn’t exceed 4GB or so (on a standard recordable
DVD) or 8GB (on a dual-layer recordable DVD). You can see how much
free space remains on the disc at the bottom of the disc’s Finder
window. 
338
Part VI: The Necessary Evils: Troubleshooting, Upgrading, Maintaining 

3. Click File and then choose Burn Disc from the menu.
You can also click the Burn button on the Recordable DVD bar — it
appears at the top of the disc’s Finder window. 
4. Choose the fastest recording speed possible.
5. Click Burn.
Burning backups from other recording applications
If you’ve invested in Toast Titanium from Roxio (www.roxio.com) or
another CD/DVD recording application, you can create a new disc layout to
burn your backup disc. (Think of a layout as a “road map” indicating which
files and folders Toast should store on the backup.)
You can save that disc layout and use it again. This simplifies the process of
backing up the same files in the future (if you don’t move folders or files from
their current spot).
Putting Things Right with Time Machine
If you enable backups via Leopard’s new Time Machine feature, you can liter-
ally move backward through the contents of your iMac’s hard drive, selecting
and restoring all sorts of data. Files and folders are ridiculously easy to
restore — and I mean easier than any restore you’ve ever performed, no
matter what the operating system or backup program. Time Machine can
even handle such deleted items as Address Book entries or photos you sent
to the Trash from iPhoto!
Because Time Machine should be an important and integral part of every
Mac owner’s existence, the Time Machine icon is included on the Dock.
(Apple is not messing around!)
Apple’s Time Capsule device is designed as a wireless storage drive for your
Time Machine backup files — if you’re interested in a single Time Machine
backup location for multiple Macs across your wireless network, Time
Capsule is a great addition to your home or office.
Before you can use Time Machine, it must be enabled within the Time
Machine pane in System Preferences. I cover the Time Machine configuration
settings (and how to turn the feature on) in more detail in Chapter 6. 
Here’s how you can turn back time, step by step, to restore a file that you
deleted or replaced in a folder.
339
Chapter 20: Tackling the Housekeeping

1. Open the folder that contained the file you want to restore.
2. In a separate window, open your Applications folder and launch the
Time Machine application, or click the Time Machine icon on the
Dock (which bears a clock with a counter-clockwise arrow).
The oh-so-ultra-cool Time Machine background appears behind your
folder, complete with its own set of buttons at the bottom of the screen
(as shown in Figure 20-3). On the right, you see a timeline that corre-
sponds to the different days and months included in the backups that
Leopard has made.
3. Click within the timeline to jump directly to a date (displaying the
folder’s contents on that date).
Alternatively, use the Forward and Back arrows at the right to move
through the folder’s contents through time. (You should see the faces 
of Windows users when you “riffle” through your folders to locate some-
thing you deleted several weeks ago!)
The backup date of the items you’re viewing appears in the button bar
at the bottom of the screen.
Figure 20-3:
Yes, Time
Machine

this!
340
Part VI: The Necessary Evils: Troubleshooting, Upgrading, Maintaining 

4. After you locate the file you want to restore, click it to select it.
5. Click the Restore button at the right side of the Time Machine 
button bar.
If you want to restore all the contents of the folder, click the Restore All
button instead.
Time Machine returns you to the Finder, with the newly restored file now
appearing in the folder. Out-standing!
To restore specific data from your Address Book or images from iPhoto,
launch the desired application first and then launch Time Machine. Instead 
of riffling through a Finder window, you can move through time within the
application window.
For simple backup and restore protection, Time Machine is all that a typical
Mac owner at home is likely to ever need. Therefore, a very easy Mark’s
Maxim to predict:
Turn on Time Machine. Do it now. Don’t make a humongous mistake.™
Maintaining Hard Drive Health
Shifty-eyed, sneaky, irritating little problems can bother your hard drive: per-
missions errors. Incorrect disk and file permissions can
 Make your iMac lock up
 Make applications act screwy (or refuse to run at all)
 Cause weird behavior within a Finder window or System Preferences
To keep Leopard running at its best, I recommend that you fix permissions
errors at least once per week.
To fix any permissions errors on your system, follow these steps:
1. Open a Finder window, click Applications, and then click Utilities.
2. Double-click the Disk Utility icon.
3. Click the volume at the left that you want to check. (Volume is just
computer-speak for a named partition, like Macintosh HD, which
appears under your physical hard drive.)
4. Click the Repair Disk Permissions button.
Disk Utility does the rest and then displays a message about whatever it
has to fix. (When will someone invent a car with a Repair Me button?)
341
Chapter 20: Tackling the Housekeeping

Automating Those Mundane Chores
One popular feature in Leopard — Automator — has generated a lot of 
excitement. You use Automator (as shown in Figure 20-4) to create applica-
tions with a compiled form of AppleScript. (In case you’re not familiar with
AppleScript, it’s the simple programming language that you can use to auto-
mate tasks and applications within Leopard.)
Of course, that might sound daunting — akin to building your own nuclear
submarine single-handedly over a long weekend — but Automator is actually
easy to use. Heck, you might find it downright fun!
You can also create workflows, which are sequential (and repeatable) opera-
tions that are performed on the same files or data, and then your Automator
application can automatically launch whatever applications are necessary to
get the job done.
Here’s a great example: You work with a service bureau that sends you a CD
every week with new product shots for your company’s marketing depart-
ment. Unfortunately, these images are flat-out huge — taken with a 12-
megapixel camera — and they’re always in the wrong orientation. Before you
move them to the Marketing folder on your server, you have to laboriously
resize each image and rotate it, and then save the smaller version.
With help from Automator, though, you can build a custom application that
automatically reads each image in the folder, resizes it, rotates it, and even
generates a thumbnail image or prints the image, and then moves the mas-
saged images to the proper folder. You’d normally have to manually launch
Preview to perform the image operations and then use a Finder window to
move the new files to the right location. But now, with Automator, a single
double-click of your custom application icon does the trick.
342
Part VI: The Necessary Evils: Troubleshooting, Upgrading, Maintaining 
What causes permissions errors?
Permission errors are usually introduced on your
system when a faulty installer makes a mistake
copying files to your system. Sometimes, the
application itself has a bug that produces errors
when it tries to open or close files or use Mac OS
X system functions. Fortunately, you don’t really
have to investigate what causes a permission
error. (That’s good because you and I aren’t likely
to understand such techno-gibberish, anyway.)
You just need to know that Disk Utility fixes the
errors.
Didn’t I tellyou this operating system was the best
on planet Earth?

You’ll find Automator in your Applications folder. Currently, Automator can
handle specific tasks within about 30 or 40 applications (including the
Finder), but both Apple and third-party developers are busy adding new
Automator task support to all sorts of new and existing applications.
Creating an application in Automator
To create a simple application with Automator, launch the application and
follow these steps:
1. Select Custom and click Choose.
2. Click the desired item in the Library list.
Automator displays the actions available for the item you’ve selected.
Some of these items are media files, while others include Address Book
contacts, files and folders in the Finder, PDF documents and even Apple
Mail messages.
3. Drag the desired action from the Library window to the workflow
window.
4. Modify any specific settings provided for the action you chose.
5. Repeat Steps 1–3 to complete the workflow.
Figure 20-4:
Automator

come true
for those

tasks.
343
Chapter 20: Tackling the Housekeeping

6. Click Run (upper right) to test your script.
Use sample files while you’re fine-tuning your application lest you acci-
dentally do something deleterious to an original (and irreplaceable) file!
Figure 20-5 illustrates an application that will take care of the earlier
example — resizing and rotating a folder full of images, and then moving
them to the Pictures folder.
7. When the application is working as you like, press Ô+Shift+S to save it.
8. In the Save dialog that appears, type a name for your new application.
9. Click the Where pop-up menu and specify a location where the file
should be saved.
10. Click the File Format pop-up menu and choose Application.
11. Click Save.
Your new Automator application icon appears, sporting an Automator
robot standing on a document.
Why, most normal human beings would now call you a programmer, so
make sure you’re inscrutable from now on! If you’re going to use your
new Automator application often, don’t forget that you can make it more
convenient to use by dragging the application icon to your Dock, or to
your desktop.
To find all the actions of a certain type within the Library list, click in the
Search box at the bottom of the Library window and type in a keyword, such
as save or burn. You don’t even need to press Return!

Part VI: The Necessary Evils: Troubleshooting, Upgrading, Maintaining 

Running applications at start up
If your Automator application should run every time you log in, follow these
steps to set it up as a Login Item:
1. Open System Preferences.
2. Display the Accounts pane.
3. Click the Login Items button.
4. Click the plus button at the bottom of the list.
5. Navigate to the location of your new Automator application.
6. Click Add.
Now your Automator application is really automatic. Watch your signifi-
cant other gape in amazement as your iMac begins to work without you
touching the keyboard! (If you’ve added the application icon to your
Dock, you can also simply right-click on the icon and choose Open at
Login from the right-click menu that appears. Either way, your iMac gets
the message.)
Many third-party applications have their own Automator actions after instal-
lation. Check the developer’s Web site often to see whether additional
Automator applications have been added that you can download.
Updating Mac OS X Automatically
I prefer my iMac to take care of cleaning up after itself, so updating Leopard
should be automatic as well. In Mac OS X Leopard, operating system updates
are performed by the Software Update application.
Software Update uses the Internet, so you need an Internet connection to
shake hands with the Apple server and download any updates.
Software Update can be found in two convenient spots:
 The Apple menu: Click the Apple menu (Ú) and then click Software
Update, which displays the Update dialog and alerts you to anything
new that’s available.
 System Preferences: Click the Software Update icon to display the
Software Update pane that you see in Figure 20-6.
345
Chapter 20: Tackling the Housekeeping

If you take the System Preferences route, you can set Software Update to
check for updates automatically:
a. Mark the Check for Updates check box to enable it.
b. Choose the time period from the Check for Updates pop-up menu.
Software Update covers every Apple application, so I usually check once
daily just to make sure that I don’t miss anything.
If something needs to be updated, the program alerts you, either auto-
matically downloading the update(s) or displaying a dialog letting you
know what you can update (depending on the settings you choose in the
System Preferences Software Update pane).
You can even check for updates immediately from System Preferences. That,
dear reader, is just plain thoughtful design.

 Reaching Unix inside Leopard
A
pplications make the world go around! It’s the truth! And although
Leopard gets much of the glory for its elegant design and power, you
can’t really do much productivity-wise from your Desktop without a snappy
application. I’m sure that the Laws of Gravity, Magnetism, and Murphy are 
all controlled somewhere in the cosmos by one heck of a piece of software.
(Who owns the Celestial Supercomputer, I don’t know . . . but I’ll bet it uses
an Intel Core 2 Duo processor.)
I dedicate this Part of Tens chapter to listing those applications every Mac
owner should know about. Even if you don’t use one or two of these great
tools now, you’ll likely realize that you need and want them in the future.
Applications
This section presents a regular smorgasbord of six applications, running the
gamut from DVD entertainment to productivity software. (I’ve even heard tell
that you can run Windows XP or Vista on your iMac, without requiring a
reboot like the Leopard Boot Camp feature.)

Some of these applications are built in to Mac OS X — read that as free —
whilst others you must buy. I note here which is which and give you a ball-
park price for the commercial stuff.
DVDs and CDs
Half the time we’re watchin’ ’em, and half the time we’re burnin’ ’em — DVDs,
that is. Apple has always had superior support for DVD hardware; after all,
the SuperDrive has been a feature (or featured upgrade) for Macintosh com-
puters for years now. Come explore the best two DVD applications around for
your Leopard machine.
Watching DVD movies with aplomb
Face it — that gorgeous widescreen 20" or 24" flat-panel monitor on your Core
2 Duo iMac is perfect for watching DVD movies. (Psst . . . it’s okay . . . you can
fib to your significant other and your friends that you’re using your new super-
computer for work. I own an iMac, too, so I understand. It’s an iMac thing.)
Thanks to our good friends in Cupertino, you’ll find that the Leopard DVD
Player does a great job at screening all your favorite DVD films:
 You can display your movie in a window or use the entire screen 
(especially nice for widescreen titles).
 If your movie includes different audio tracks, subtitles, and camera
angles, you can control them all from the spiffy remote control that
appears onscreen whenever you move your mouse.
 You can step through the video frame by frame or in slow motion to 
see the martial arts action that you missed in the theater.
By default, DVD Player runs automatically when you load a DVD-Video 
(DVD-V), including those that you create yourself with iDVD or Roxio Toast.
I especially like the feature that remembers whether you viewed a disc already
and also gives you the opportunity to restart the film where you left off.
Yes, they really named it Toast
Until the advent of Mac OS X and the iLife suite, recording audio and data
CDs or DVD-Vs on your Mac required using a third-party application. The
Cadillac of recording software for the Mac was, is, and will likely always be
the unlikely named Toast, from Roxio (www.roxio.com). The latest version
is Toast 8 Titanium, available online for about $80.
350
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

The built-in recording features in iTunes and iDVD are certainly fine, and the
discs that these two applications produce are compatible with any audio CD
player or DVD player that you’re likely to find. However, you’ll need Toast to
 Produce specialized types of discs.
This includes
• Hybrid discs that store both Mac and PC data
• ISO 9660 discs for Unix and Linux machines
• Mixed-mode and enhanced CDs that carry both audio and data
• Video CDs and Super Video CDs
 Directly copy an existing CD or unprotected DVD.
 Mount a DVD image as if it were a physical disc that you loaded into
your iMac’s optical drive.
This is definitely a plus if you
• Play games.
• Restore from backup images.
 Recognize older external optical drives that might not be supported
within Leopard or the iLife suite.
For a comprehensive guide to using Toast to create all these types of special-
ized discs, look no farther than my book CD & DVD Recording For Dummies,
2nd Edition (Wiley). It covers Toast Titanium like a layer of syrup.
Management and communication
Both iCal and Apple Mail are mighty applications, bent on organizing things:
your time, calendar, and/or your Internet e-mail traffic. (They do a great job,
too.) Apple provides both in Mac OS X, so you can keep your credit card in
your pocket or purse.
Coverage of iLife applications isn’t in this chapter because I cover ’em in
depth elsewhere in the book. See all the chapters in Part IV.
Staying on top of things with iCal
iCal is one of those oddities in the computer world. Unlike iTunes or iMovie,
it’s not particularly sexy (in a multimedia way), and it doesn’t get oodles of
coverage in the glossy Macintosh magazines. Still, everybody eventually ends
up using it. Sooner or later, every Mac owner appreciates iCal as an unsung
hero. (And a free unsung hero to boot.)
351
Chapter 21: Ten Applications You Can’t Do Without

Unfortunately, iCal can’t enter events for you. And take my word for it: The
Data Elves aren’t going to show up and magically type for you, so you have to
create events manually. After they’re in the iCal database, however, you can
 Set alarms for specific events.
 Add notes for each event.
 Print a calendar.
 Import some data automatically from Mail messages and iChat text.
 Set repeating events on a regular schedule.
By default, iCal includes two calendars — Home and Work — but you can set
up as many separate calendars as you like, for scheduling everything from
soccer seasons to DVD releases.
Oh, and don’t forget about the To Do items, which keep you focused on the
tasks that really matter. You can easily sort To Do items by priority or due date;
you can also hide items with due dates outside the current calendar page.
If you’re a .Mac member, you can publish any calendar online that other folks
can then subscribe to (great for clubs and organizations). Or, you can publish
your calendar on any Web server that supports WebDAV functionality. Check
with your site’s Webmaster (or call your Internet service provider; ISP) to see
whether you can offer an iCal calendar on your Web site. I discuss the Apple
.Mac service at length in Chapter 9.
One doggone good e-mail application
Ask yourself this question: “Am I taking my e-mail application for granted?”
Sure, e-mail might not take center stage in the computer magazines these
days, but consider what your life would be like with a substandard, whip-
and-buggy e-mail application — almost as bad as no e-mail at all.
The best e-mail applications (like Apple Mail) have powerful, trainable 
spam filters that improve automatically as you manually check your junk
mail. A first-class performer (like Apple Mail) offers fully automated scripting
for common tasks, snazzy backgrounds, fonts and colors, and the ability to
create HTML-format messages with embedded images and objects. Are you
seeing a pattern here?
One of my favorite recent additions to Apple Mail is the ability to organize
your messages by threads. (In plain English, a thread groups replies so that
they can be read as an actual discussion.) Anyone who frequents Usenet
newsgroups or Web discussion sites recognizes a threaded view as easier to
read than a traditional sequential display, especially when your mail is heavy
on replies and includes ongoing conversations with several folks involved.
It’s free, it’s fun, and it’s fashionable — go, Apple Mail, go!
352
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

Productivity
Sooner or later, you’re going to need the ability to create grown-up,
respectable documents from your iMac, or you might need to run an
absolutely-gotta-have-it-application-that’s-not-available-for-Macs. (I actually
run into very few of those.) In this section, I cover two of my favorite produc-
tivity applications — Parallels Desktop and iWork ’08 — and the serious stuff
they can do.
Sweet! Windows Vista on my iMac without rebooting!
Okay, even I’ll admit that there are fewer applications available to Macs than
PCs running Windows, and practically every Mac owner on the planet has
one or two PC programs that make life easier. Sure, you can use the Leopard
Boot Camp feature to set up an XP or a Vista system on your iMac, but you
have to reboot to use Windows, and it’s very difficult to share Mac data with
your Windows applications (even though they’re actually on the same com-
puter). More information on Boot Camp is always available from the Mac OS
X Help system, but you can start the ball rolling by double-clicking the Boot
Camp Assistant icon in your Utilities folder (which is tucked inside your
Applications folder). The Assistant provides step-by-step onscreen instruc-
tions. Just make sure that you have your Windows XP Service Pack 2 or
Windows Vista installation discs handy.
What if you don’t want to reboot, and you want to share data easily between
your Mac and Windows applications? Luckily, Parallels offers a solution:
Parallels Desktop for Mac (www.parallels.com). The program sells for
about $80, but this doesn’t include a licensed copy of Windows XP or Vista.
(Yeah, you have to provide your own.) However, this nifty program can easily
run virtually all Windows XP and Windows Vista programs — without reboot-
ing your iMac — complete with support for external USB devices, Ethernet
networks, the Internet, and your iMac printer.
Windows programs don’t even know the difference because Parallels Desktop
simulates an entire PC (complete with a “software-based” — virtual — video
card and sound card), all while using your iMac’s Intel processor, USB key-
board, and mouse)!
Parallels Desktop also makes it very easy to share files and data between
your Mac and Windows applications because your aluminum supercomputer
is still running Leopard. Copying files from one system to another is as easy
as drag-and-drop, or you can use the shared folder created on your XP or
Vista desktop to pick up your Mac goodies.
353
Chapter 21: Ten Applications You Can’t Do Without

Parallels Desktop does have some limitations, though:
 You won’t be running the latest 3-D games. To run PC games at their
full speed, you have to use Boot Camp and reboot into a native Windows
system.
 Parallels Desktop requires a fair chunk of your iMac’s hard drive
space to store your Windows “hard drive-in-a-file.”
 Your Windows applications will run slightly slower compared with a
Boot Camp installation of XP or Vista.
However, with the Core 2 Duo processor in your iMac and at least a 
gigabyte of memory, Parallels Desktop runs surprisingly well. And 
it’s better than rebooting every time you need to run that must-have
Windows program, right?
The more memory you install in your iMac, the better Parallels Desktop 
will run!
You can install
 More than one version of Windows
I have Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 2000 running within
Parallels Desktop, each with its own machine.
 Almost any other operating system that’s ever been produced for the PC
I have a Red Hat Linux drive as well.
Parallels Desktop for Mac makes it easy to shut down a simulated computer —
akin to a laptop computer going into hibernation — while keeping your open
documents intact. When you reload your “virtual” Windows machine, you’re
right back at the exact same point when you shut down.
You can quote me: I like the iWork ’08 Suite
I wish I had a dime for every time I’ve read or heard about how the Macintosh
version of Office is so indispensable to every Mac owner and how it should
be an automatic purchase at the moment you buy your computer. I admit
that the applications that make up Office are superb — I’m writing with Word
at this moment — but every new Mac owner should try iWork ’08 before
jumping onto the Microsoft productivity bandwagon.
Why? Well, to be honest, most computer owners simply don’t use or need all
the features and hoo-hah that’s built into the Mac Office applications! For
example, if all you produce on paper are simple letters, typical schoolwork,
or brochures for your home business, Word might be an expensive case of
overkill.
354
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

As an author, I confess that I use all the power that Word has to offer — and
my publisher requires me to use it, so I shelled out the cash. However, I
exchange Word documents all the time with my friends who use the Pages
word processing application, which is part of the iWork suite.
The same goes for Excel and PowerPoint. Respectively, Numbers and
Keynote are powerful alternatives to their Microsoft counterparts. In fact, 
all iWork ’08 applications offer the same ease-of-use and simplicity you’ve
come to expect from Mac OS X Leopard and iLife ’08 programs such as
iPhoto, iTunes, and iDVD.
The only core Mac Office application that iWork doesn’t match is Entourage,
but the combination of Apple Mail, iCal, and Address Book does the same job.
iWork applications offer templates and assistants that are similar to those in
Office, so creating all sorts of specialized business and personal documents
is easy. New templates and clip art are always available online as well.
So go ahead — visit your Applications folder and give iWork ’08 a try. It’s fast,
it’s inexpensive, and I think you’ll be pleasantly surprised.
System Stuff
Ah, utilities. . . . I love ’em almost as much as I crave games. I think that most
iMac power users would agree with me when I say that a well-maintained Mac
is a wonderful machine. To that end, the utilities you find in this last section
help keep your hardware, software, and files in tiptop shape.
Maintenance
Although I devote Chapter 20 to the joys of maintenance, I want to mention
the following two applications again, just to make sure you remember them.
(The alternative is a tattoo, which is probably overkill.)
Disk repair and so very much more
If you’re not already using Disk Utility, you should. On a regular basis. Really.
Most Mac owners think of Disk Utility only for checking internal and external
hard drives. But don’t forget the most important function (in my opinion)
that Disk Utility offers: the ability to fix file and folder permission problems.
This is why I recommend that you launch Disk Utility and check your Mac OS
355
Chapter 21: Ten Applications You Can’t Do Without

X startup drive on a weekly basis. Permission problems can cause your appli-
cations to act like they’re on mind-altering drugs or even lock you out of
using those applications altogether! (Chapter 18 shows you how to squash
permission errors.)
Of course, there’s more to Disk Utility, but you’re not likely to use heavy-duty
functions very often, such as partitioning or RAID management. These are
advanced features that one typically uses only when initializing a new hard
drive.
“Back, you viruses! Stay back!” I say!
Blah, blah, blah. . . . Unless you’ve been living in a cave in the Himalayas for
the last decade, you already know what I’m going to say about how important
it is to protect your iMac from viral infection. I’ll save the keystrokes for the
next application.
Get yourself an antivirus application — one that automatically checks the
discs that you load as well as the stuff that you download. I use VirusBarrier
X4 from Intego (www.intego.com, about $80 online). Set it to automatically
download the latest virus definition files from the Internet and scan your
entire system once monthly.
Now you can relax.
Files
Care to compress a folder full of files to save space on your hard drive or
maybe send them via e-mail? Perhaps you’d like to use the keyboard and the
power of Unix to perform file manipulation miracles that are practically
impossible by using the mouse. Either way, the applications in this final sec-
tion have you covered.
When a Zip file isn’t enough
In the Windows universe, the WinZip archive file is king, followed by WinRAR
and a host of other different archiving formats. Leopard has built-in support
for compressing and decompressing Zip archives.
However, for Mac owners Zip files have never been hot stuff (horrible pun
intended). Leopard can unarchive a Zip file when necessary — just double-
click the archive icon — and you can right-click a file or folder and then
choose Compress from the menu to create a Zip archive.
356
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

“So what do you recommend, Mark?” Easy call, good reader: the smallest 
and most Mac-friendly archive format has long been the StuffIt format, from
Allume Systems (www.stuffit.com).
The latest version 12 of StuffIt Deluxe will set you back $80, but it’s worth
every penny for the convenience and flexibility that archives bring to your
Desktop:
 Smaller archive file sizes than comparable Zip archives
 Industrial-strength data encryption to secure your archives
 Support for files that normally don’t compress well, like JPEG images
 Archive browsing without actually expanding (a real timesaver)
 Direct burn of archived data to CD or DVD
Oh, by the way, StuffIt Deluxe also opens and creates Zip files. You know, just
in case you have to share files with The Great Unwashed Windows Horde.
Doing the command line dance
This must-have application is a little different from the others: You have to
type your commands manually, and there are no icons or fancy graphics.
You’re in the character-based Twilight Zone, and only the bravest of Mac
novices will venture there.
However, when you launch the Terminal application, you open a window into
the Unix core that lies underneath Mac OS X. Suddenly you can do wondrous
things that you can’t do from the Finder menu:
 You can manipulate hidden and hard-to-reach files, like preference files.
 You can work with Unix applications like File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
and the Apache Web server.
357
Chapter 21: Ten Applications You Can’t Do Without
Archives explained in a small space
An archive is a single file that can hold data in a
compressed format. Archives offer these
advantages:
 Take less disk space
 Download faster
 Can hold multiple files and folders
This is great for easily creating backups or
sending a number of images through e-mail
as a single attachment.
When you’re ready to use the data, you simply
unarchive the file, which expands the items and
restores them to their original form.

 If you’re familiar with wildcards and the command line hieroglyphics that
make up Unix, you can manage your files with a speed that no graphical
user interface (GUI) can match. (That’s a DOS feature I still miss.)
Before you make your move into Unix, I highly recommend that you grab 
a companion and guide for the journey. A good pick is UNIX For Dummies, 
5th Edition, by John R. Levine and Margaret Levine Young (Wiley). Without 
a learning tool that you can use to teach yourself, Terminal is a very lonely
window indeed.

Ten Ways to Speed Up Your iMac
In This Chapter
 Adding memory
 Using spoken commands
 Defragmenting your drive
 Banishing the desktop background
 Using column mode
 Customizing the Dock
 Using keyboard shortcuts
 Customizing your Finder windows
 Launching recent applications and documents
 Using the Go menu
E
ven an iMac with a Core 2 Duo processor can always go just a bit faster . . .
or can it? There’s actually a pretty short list of tweaks that you can apply
to your iMac’s hardware to speed it up, and these suggestions are covered in
this chapter.
You can also work considerably faster within Leopard (the latest Mac OS X
version) by customizing your Desktop and your Finder windows, which
makes it easier to spot and use your files, folders, and applications. That’s in
this Part of Tens chapter, too.
Finally, you can enhance your efficiency and make yourself a power user by
tweaking yourself. (Sounds a bit tawdry or even painful, but bear with me,
and you’ll understand.) If you haven’t delved into the realm of keyboard
shortcuts, the Recent menu, and the Go menu, you’ll find that you’re taking 
a number of extra steps that you can eliminate. Soon, you’ll be the fastest

component in your whole system! I recommend how you can speed yourself
up in this chapter as well.
Nothing Works Like a Shot of Memory
Okay, maybe shot is the wrong word, but adding additional memory to your
iMac (by either replacing or adding a memory module) is the single surefire
way to speed up the performance of your entire system. That includes every
application as well as Leopard itself.
Why does additional memory provide such a boost? With more memory, your
iMac can hold more of your documents and data in memory, and thus has to
store less data temporarily on your hard drive. It takes your iMac much less
time to store, retrieve, and work with data when that data is in RAM (short
for random access memory) rather than on your hard drive. That’s why your
system runs faster when you can fit an entire image in Photoshop CS3 in your
iMac’s system memory.
By the way, this tweak works on any computer running Mac OS X, Windows
XP/Vista, or Linux/Unix — they all automatically take advantage of as much
memory as you can toss their way. My aluminum iMac has a full 4GB of
memory, and you can sure tell the difference from the 1GB that it originally
shipped with. It’s like comparing a Humvee with a Ferrari! (For details on
installing more memory, visit the friendly confines of Chapter 19.)
Hold a Conversation with Your iMac
Your iMac can speak any text to you through the Services menu, but that’s
generally not a big timesaver. (Neat for the kids, I admit, just like spoken
alerts — more on this later in this section.) However, many Mac owners will
attest that you can significantly increase your own efficiency by using the
Speakable Items feature, which allows you to speak common commands
within applications and Finder windows. Your voice is indeed faster than
either your mouse or your fingers! Common commands in the Speakable
Items folder include “Log me out,” “Get my mail,” “Hide this application,” and
“Open my browser.” You won’t find them on your local radio station’s Top 40
countdown, but they’re popular among the Mac set.
360
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

To enable Speakable Items, choose System Preferences➪Speech and then
select the On radio button next to Apple Speakable Items to enable speech
recognition. You see the feedback window appear, which includes a conve-
nient sound level meter that you can use to adjust the volume of your voice.
Remember, by default, that the speech recognition system is active only
when you press and hold the Esc key.
It takes a little practice to enunciate the King’s English properly — your iMac
is a bit finicky when it comes to recognizing a Texas drawl — but the effort
pays off when you realize just how much faster things are moving when
you’re sitting at your computer.
When you’re looking at the Speech pane, click the Text to Speech tab and
then select the Announce When Alerts Are Displayed check box to enable it.
This activates spoken alerts. I think they’re cool. (Any message that’s dis-
played in a dialog will now be spoken automatically.) Enable the Speak
Selected Text When the Key is Pressed check box to specify a key that will
speak highlighted text in your applications, which is perfect for messing with
your co-worker’s minds in the office.
Vamoose, Unwanted Fragments!
Apple would probably prefer that I not mention disk fragmentation because
Leopard doesn’t come with a built-in defragmenting application. (Go figure.)
To keep your hard drive running as speedily as possible, I recommend defrag-
menting at least once monthly. You can use third-party applications like
Micromat’s TechTool Pro (www.micromat.com) to defragment your drive.
361
Chapter 22: Ten Ways to Speed Up Your iMac
Defraggle rocks
What’s fragmentation? Here’s the short version:
The longer you use your hard drive (and the
more often you create and delete files), the more
fragmented those files become on your hard
drive, and the longer they take to read. A disk-
defragmenting application reads all the files on
your drive and rewrites them as continuous,
contiguous files, which your machine can read
significantly faster. (In other words, your iMac
doesn’t have to “piece together” the contents
of a file to read it.)
I understand this because I have no patience
with puzzles myself.

Keep Your Desktop Background Simple
It’s funny that I still include this tip in a chapter dedicated to improving per-
formance. After all, I recommended using a solid color background in my first
books on Mac OS 8 and Windows 98! Just goes to show you that some things
never change.
Even with the high-powered video cards in today’s iMacs, it still takes time
for Leopard to redraw your Mac OS X background when you close or hide an
application window. And if you’re running a number of heavy-duty applica-
tions (like Final Cut Pro and Photoshop CS3), you can actually see the block of
video memory “blank out” for a few seconds while things grind along. The
slowdown is worse when you’re using a huge true-color image as a back-
ground at 1920 x 1200 on your iMac with the 24-inch screen. Think about all
those pixels, and you’ll likely get a headache, too.
Therefore, if you’re interested in running your system as fast as it will go,
choose a solid-color background from the Desktop & Screen Saver pane in
System Preferences. (In fact, there’s even a separate category that you can
pick called Solid Colors.)
Column Mode Is for Power Users
One of my favorite features of Mac OS X is the ability to display files and fold-
ers in column view mode. Just click the Column button in the standard Finder
window toolbar, and the contents of the window automatically align in well-
ordered columns.
So why is column mode so doggone fast? Just imagine drilling through sev-
eral layers of folders to get to a specific location on your hard drive — for
example, Users/mark/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music, which I visit on a
regular basis. If you use icon view, you have to double-click so often that
you’ll have to give your mouse button a rest. List view really isn’t that much
better because the folder contents keep expanding, and you have those dog-
gone expanding/collapsing triangles to deal with.
In column mode, however, a single click drills a level deeper, and often you
won’t even have to use the Finder window’s scroll bars to see what you’re
looking for. Files and folders appear in a logical order (unlike icon mode)
without changing the layout of the window (unlike list mode). Plus, it’s much
easier to move a file (by dragging it from one location on your hard drive to
another) in column mode. I think you’ll find column mode both faster and
less confusing, which will move you a little closer to your ultimate goal of
power-user status.
362
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

Make the Dock Do Your Bidding
Every Mac owner considers the Mac OS X Dock a good friend: It’s a control
center, a status display, and an organizer all rolled into one. But when’s the
last time you customized it — or have you ever made a change to it at all?
You can drag files and folders to the Dock, as well as Web URLs, applications,
and network servers. You can also remove applications and Web URLs just as
easily by dragging the icon from the Dock and releasing it on your Desktop
(producing that cool puff of animated smoke that someone in Cupertino is
likely still very proud of to this very day).
I find that I make a significant change to my Dock icons at least once every
week. I find nothing more convenient than placing a folder for each of my cur-
rent projects on the Dock or adding applications to the Dock that I might be
researching for a book or demonstrating in a chapter.
You can position the Dock at either side of the Desktop or even hide the Dock
from sight entirely to give yourself an extra strip of space on your Desktop
for application windows. Click the Apple menu (Ú) and choose Dock. From
the submenu that appears, you can choose either Position on Left or Position
on Right, or you can choose Turn Hiding On to instruct the Dock to perform
its vanishing act. You can also toggle the Dock’s magnifying feature on and off
from this menu.
It All Started with Keyboard Shortcuts
Ask a computing dinosaur like me (who started computing before the arrival
of the IBM-PC) how you can spot a true power user, and you’re likely to get
the same answer: Watch how the person uses keyboard shortcuts. A real
power user makes use of every keyboard shortcut available, committing
those key sequences to memory.
Heck, keyboard shortcuts have been around since the days of WordStar and
VisiCalc, back when a mouse was still a living rodent. Although selecting a
command from a menu might be intuitive, it’s also very time-consuming 
compared with a simple press of a few keys. The same action gets performed,
but if you add up all those seconds of mouse-handling that you save by using
keyboard shortcuts, you’ll see that you can save hours of productive time
every year.
363
Chapter 22: Ten Ways to Speed Up Your iMac

You’re likely already using some keyboard shortcuts, like the common editing
shortcuts Ô+C (Copy) and Ô+V (Paste). When I’m learning a new application,
I often search through the application’s online help to find a keyboard short-
cut table and then print out that table as a quick reference. Naturally, you 
can also view keyboard shortcuts by clicking each of the major menu groups
within an application. Shortcuts are usually displayed alongside the corre-
sponding menu items.
Hey, You Tweaked Your Finder!
Here’s another speed enhancer along the same lines as my earlier tip about
customizing your Dock: You can also reconfigure your Finder windows to pre-
sent you with just the tools and locations that you actually use (rather than
what Apple figures you’ll use).
For example, you can Control-click (or right-click) the toolbar in any Finder
window and choose Customize Toolbar. By default, Leopard’s Finder toolbar
includes only the default icon set that you see at the bottom of the sheet, but
you can drag and drop all sorts of useful command icons onto the toolbar:
Burn (for CDs and DVDs), Delete (which sends the highlighted files or folders
to the Trash), and Get Info (the same result as pressing Ô+I ). You can save
space by displaying small-sized icons, too.
The Sidebar — which hangs out at the left side of every Finder window — is a
healthy, no-nonsense repository for those locations that you constantly visit
throughout a computing session. For example, I have both a Games folder
and a Book Chapters folder that I use countless times every day — it’s impor-
tant to balance work with pleasure, you know — and I’ve dragged both of
those folders to the Sidebar. Now I can immediately jump to either folder
from any Finder window or Open/Save File dialog with a single click of the
mouse . . . speedy indeed!
Keep in Touch with Your Recent Past
Click that Apple menu (Ú) and use that Recent Items menu! I know that
sounds a little too simple, but I meet many new Apple computer owners
every year who either don’t know that the Recent Items menu exists or forget
to use it. You can access both applications and documents that you’ve used
within the last few days.
364
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

Most computer users turn to the same applications over and over, and to the
same documents several times in each computing session. You can put these
items in your Dock or your Sidebar, but they’re also available from the Recent
Items menu (and you don’t have to physically drag things willy-nilly around
your Desktop). Consider the Dock and Finder Sidebar as permanent or semi-
permanent solutions, and the Recent Items menu as more of a temporary
solution to finding the stuff that you’re working on right now.
Go Where the Going Is Good
To round out this Part of Tens chapter, I recommend another little-known
(and under-appreciated) Finder menu feature (at least among Macintosh
novices): the Go menu, which is located on the Finder menu.
The Go menu is really a catchall, combining the most important locations on
your system (like your Home folder and your iDisk) with folders that you’ve
used recently. Plus, the Go menu is the place where you can connect to
servers or shared folders across your local network or across the Internet.
Pull down the Go menu today — and don’t forget to try out those spiffy key-
board shortcuts you see listed next to the command names. (For example,
press Ô+Shift+H to immediately go to your Home folder.) And if a Finder
window isn’t open at the moment, a new window opens automatically — 
such convenience is hard to resist!

I
f you’ve read other books that I’ve written in the For Dummies series, you
might recognize the title of this chapter: It’s a favorite Part of Tens subject
of mine that appears often in my work. I don’t like to see any computer owner
fall prey to pitfalls. Some of these pitfalls are minor — like keeping your iMac
clean — but others are downright catastrophic, like providing valuable infor-
mation over the Internet to persons unknown.
All these potential mistakes, however, share one thing in common: They’re
easily prevented with a little common sense — as long as you’re aware of
them. That’s my job. In this chapter, I fill in what you need to know. Consider
these pages as experience gained easily!

Man, That Is the Definition of Sluggish
Let’s see, what could I be talking about? Oh, yes . . . only a USB 1.1 external
hard drive or CD-ROM drive could be as slow as a turtle on narcotics.
Unfortunately, you’ll still find countless examples of USB 1.1 storage hard-
ware hanging around. eBay is stuffed to the gills with USB 1.1 hard drives,
and your family and friends will certainly want to bestow that old 4X CD-RW
drive to you as a gift. (This is one that you should politely refuse immedi-
ately, just like your Aunt Harriet’s woebegone fruitcake.) These drives were
considered cool in the early days of the colorful iMac G3, when USB was a
brand-new technology. Today, however, a USB 1.1 hard drive is simply a slow-
as-maple-syrup-in-January embarrassment.
Plenty of great USB 1.1 devices are still around these days (such as joysticks,
keyboards, mice, and other controllers), along with printers and scanners
that work just fine with slower transfer rates. But if a peripheral’s job is to
store or move data quickly — I’m talking hard drives, network connections,
CD-ROM, drives, and USB Flash drives — then give any USB 1.1 connection a
wide berth, opting instead for a USB 2.0 or FireWire device.
Phishing Is No Phun
No, that’s not a misspelling. In the latest Internet lingo, phishing refers to an
attempt by unsavory characters to illegally obtain your personal information.
If that sounds like an invitation to identity theft, it is — and thousands of
sites have defrauded individuals like you and me (along with banks and
credit card companies) out of billions of dollars.
A phishing scam works like this: You get an e-mail purporting to be from a
major company or business, such as eBay, a government agency, or a major
credit card company. The message warns you that you have to update your
login or financial information to keep it current, or that you have to validate
your information every so often — and even provides you with a link to an
official-looking Web page. After you enter information on that bogus page, it’s
piped directly to the bad guys, and they’re off to the races.
Here’s a Mark’s Maxim that every Internet user should take to heart:
No legitimate company or agency will solicit your personal information
through an e-mail message!™
368
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

Never respond to these messages. If you smell something phishy, open your
Web browser and visit the company’s site (the real one) by typing in the
address directly; then contact the company’s customer support department.
(Remember: Don’t use the link provided in the phishing e-mail!) They’ll
certainly want to know about the phishing expedition, and you can help by
providing them with the e-mail and Web addresses used in the scam.
In fact, sending any valuable financial information through unencrypted
e-mail — even to those whom you know and trust — is a bad idea. E-mail
messages can be intercepted or can be read from any e-mail server that
stores your message.
Put Floppy Disks to Rest
Did you know that the Apple iMac was the first model produced by a major
computer manufacturer that didn’t include a floppy drive? Apple always
looks ahead five years when it develops a new computer model, and the 
good folks in Cupertino accurately predicted the demise of the stodgy
1.44MB floppy disk. Why kill off such a computing icon? For a number of 
very good reasons:
 Like the weather: Floppy disks are downright unreliable because they
are easily demagnetized.
 Compatibility: A floppy disk that reads and writes fine on one machine
might not be readable in another.
 Capacity: Floppies don’t store much, either.
 Germ-ridden: Floppies make great “tour buses” for viruses.
 Lack of speed: Oh, and don’t forget that floppies are the slowest form of
storage around.
Unfortunately, most PC owners have a shoebox full of floppies with data that
might (or might not) still be important, so the floppy continues to persist,
like the human appendix. I’m just doing my part to help the evolution of the
personal computer by letting you know just how lousy the floppy really is.
If you still need a portable storage bin of some sort to carry from computer
to computer, I heartily recommend that you pick up a USB Flash drive. These
drives hold anywhere from 128MB to 8GB, and they work in any USB port.
(And they’re downright warp-drive fast when compared with a floppy disk,
especially the USB 2.0 variety.)
369
Chapter 23: Ten Things to Avoid Like the Plague

Do You Really Want a Submerged
Keyboard?
Your answer should be an unequivocal “No!” — and that’s why everyone
should make it a rule to keep all beverages well out of range of keyboards,
speakers, mice, backup drives, and any other piece of external hardware.
Especially when kids or cats are in close proximity to your iMac.
Cleaning up a hazardous soda spill is hard enough in the clear, but if that
liquid comes in contact with your iMac, you’re likely to be visited with inter-
mittent keyboard problems (or, in the worst-case scenario, a short in an
external peripheral or your iMac’s motherboard).
Suffice it to say that 12 inches of open space can make the difference between
a simple cleanup and an expensive replacement!
Don’t Use Antiquated Utility Software
Older iMacs running earlier versions of Mac OS X can use utility software
that’s a generation or two back, but if you’re using Leopard you should turn
in your older utility programs — for example, an older copy of a disk repair
application that supports only Mac OS X Panther. These older disk utility
applications can actually do more damage than good to a hard drive under
Mac OS X Leopard.
A number of things changed when Apple made the leap to Leopard, including
subtle changes to disk formats, memory management within applications,
and the maximum supported size of a hard drive. With an out-of-date utility,
you could find yourself with corrupted data. Sometimes a complete operating
system reinstall is necessary.
Now that you’re using Mac OS X Leopard, make sure that you diagnose and
repair disk and file errors by using only a utility application that’s specifically
designed to run in Leopard, like TechTool Pro from Micromat (www.micromat.
com). Your iMac’s hard drive will definitely thank you.
(Oh, and while you’re at it, don’t forget to check the manufacturer’s Web site
for any updates to drivers or application software for your third-party exter-
nal hardware! ’Nuff said.)
370
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

Don’t Endorse Software Piracy
This one’s a real no-brainer — remember, Apple’s overall market share among
worldwide computer users currently weighs in at little more than 10 percent.
Software developers know this, and they have to expect (and receive) a
return on their investment, or they’re going to find something more lucrative
to do with their time. As a shareware author, I can attest to this firsthand.
Pirated software seems attractive — the price is right, no doubt about it —
but if you use an application without buying it, you’re cheating the developer,
who will find Macintosh programming no longer worth the time and trouble.
An iMac is a great machine, and Leopard is a great operating system, but
even the best hardware and the sexiest desktop won’t make up for an
absence of good applications. Pay for what you use, and everyone benefits.
Call It the Forbidden Account
You might never have encountered the root, or System Administrator, account
within Mac OS X — and that’s always A Good Thing. Note that I’m not talking
about a standard administrator (or admin) account here. Every iMac needs at
least one admin account (in fact, it might be the only visible account on your
computer), and any standard user account can be toggled between standard
and admin status with no trouble at all.
The root account, though, is a different beast altogether, and that’s why it’s
disabled by default. All Unix systems have a root account; because Leopard 
is based on a Unix foundation, it has one, too. Anyone logging in with the 
root account can do anything on your system, including deleting or modifying
files in the System folder (which no other account can access). Believe me:
Deliberately formatting your hard drive is about the only thing worse than
screwing up the files in your System folder.
Luckily, no one can accidentally access the root/System Administrator
account. In fact, you can’t assign the root account with System Preferences;
you must use the Terminal application in Utilities (within your Applications
folder). Unless an Apple support technician tells you to enable and use it, you
should promptly forget that the root account even exists.
371
Chapter 23: Ten Things to Avoid Like the Plague

Don’t Settle for a Surge Suppressor
Technically, there’s nothing wrong with using a surge suppressor to feed
power to your iMac and all your external peripherals, but it doesn’t do the
entire job. Your system is still wide open to problems caused by momentary
brownouts, not to mention a full-fledged blackout. Losing power in the
middle of a computing session will likely lead to lost documents and might
even result in disk or file errors later. With a uninterruptible power supply
(UPS), you can rest easy knowing that your iMac will have a few minutes
more of “ilife,” running on battery power until you can close your documents
normally and shut down your computer without trauma.
Most Mac owners know about the backup battery power that a UPS provides,
but they don’t know about the extra work performed by most UPS units:
namely, filtering your AC current. Without a filtering UPS, your iMac’s power
is susceptible to electronic noise (think about a vacuum being used next to a
TV set) and momentary current spikes that can eventually cause problems
over time. A simple surge suppressor doesn’t provide this feature.
These days, you’ll find good UPS models for under $100, so there’s no reason
not to give your iMac the AC power protection that it deserves!
Refurbished Hardware Is No Deal at All
Boy, howdy, do I hate refurbished stuff. To quote someone famous, “If the
deal sounds too good to be true, it probably is.”
Examine what you get when you buy a refurbished external hard drive. It’s
likely that the drive was returned as defective, of course, and was then sent
back to the factory. There, the manufacturer probably performed the most
cursory of repairs (just enough to fix the known problem), perhaps tested the
unit for a few seconds, and then packed it back up again. Legally, retailers
can’t resell the drive as a new item, so they have to cut the price so low that
you’re willing to take the chance.
Before you spend a dime on a bargain that’s remanufactured — I can’t get
over that term — make sure that you find out how long a warranty you’ll
receive, if any. Consider that the hardware is likely to have crisscrossed the
country at least once, and that it’s likely to have picked up a few bumps and
bruises during its travels. Also, you have no idea how well the repairs were
tested or how thoroughly everything was inspected.
I don’t buy refurbished computers or hardware, and most of the tales that
I’ve heard of such behavior have ended badly. Take my advice and spend the
extra cash on trouble-free, brand-new hardware that has a full warranty.

Part VII: The Part of Tens 

iMacs Appreciate Cleanliness
Clean your machine. Every computer (and every piece of computer hard-
ware) appreciates a weekly dusting. Remember, many older iMac models
didn’t have internal fans, so a shroud of insulating dust (or cooling vents
blocked by accumulated crud) could raise the internal temperature to a dan-
gerous level. Even with a fan, dust is an insidious enemy within the confines
of your computer’s case; I know Mac owners who celebrate each passing year
by opening up their machines to blow them clean of dust bunnies with a can
of compressed air. (I’m one of them, as a matter of fact.)
Adding memory to your aluminum iMac, as I demonstrate in Chapter 19?
Take advantage of the chance and use that trusty can of compressed air to
clean up things.
On the outside of your iMac, your screen should be cleaned at least once
every two or three days — that is, unless you like peering through a layer 
of dust, fingerprints, and smudges. Never spray anything — cleaners, water,
anything! — directly on your screen or your iMac’s case. I highly recommend
using premoistened LCD cleaning wipes typically used for notebook comput-
ers, which safely clean your iMac monitor.
Your iMac case really doesn’t need a special cleaning agent — in fact, you
shouldn’t use any solvents at all — but a thorough wiping job with a soft
cloth should keep your case in spotless shape. Those cleaning wipes do a
great job on a keyboard too, but it’s a good idea to turn your Aluminum
Supercomputer off first so that a stray keyboard shortcut doesn’t wreak
havoc with your system.
