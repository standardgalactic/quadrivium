the eLectricaL sYsteM in your home may seem 
like a complicated, mysterious beast, ready to breathe 
fire or deliver shocks at any time. It is somewhat 
complicated, and in an older home it may actually be 
a dangerous beast, but the system itself is mostly 
straightforward. Even if you never intend to attempt a 
wiring project more complicated than changing out a 
ceiling fixture, it is important to understand how the 
electrical system in your home works. HomeSkills: 
Wiring explains the current standards in home 
wiring and explains how to test and evaluate your 
home’s system. 
Illustrations of all the most common types of 
electrical cables, receptacles, and switches are 
provided, with explanations of how they function. 
You will learn why it is important to update a service 
panel or install AFCI protection. You will learn what 
it means to blow a fuse or trip a circuit, how to 
remedy the problem, and whether something should 
be done as a longer‑term solution.
Detailed directions for installing in either new 
construction or finished areas are given. Most wiring 
tasks do not require high levels of skill. They do, 
however, require a great deal of attention to the 
details of meeting the current codes which protect us 
from dangerous and costly misuse of wiring. Safety is 
very important when dealing with something as 
powerful as electricity. Hundreds of people die each 
year from electrocution, or from fires started by 
improper wiring. Make sure that your wiring project 
is safe and appropriate by getting a permit and 
having your work inspected.

the onLY waY you can possibly manage home 
wiring projects safely is to understand how electricity 
works and how it is delivered from the street to the 
outlets in your home. 
The most essential quality to appreciate about 
electricity is that the typical amounts that flow 
through the wires in your home can be fatal under 
certain conditions if you contact it directly. Sources 
estimate that up to 1,000 people are electrocuted 
accidentally in the U.S. every year. In addition, as many 
as 500 die in fires from electrical causes. Home wiring 
can be a very satisfying task for do‑it‑yourselfers, but if 
you don’t know what you’re doing or are in any way 
uncomfortable with the idea of working around 
electricity, do not attempt it.
This chapter is intended to explain the fundamen‑
tal principles behind the electrical circuits that run 
through our homes. It also includes some very basic 
tips for working safely with wiring, and it details the 
essential tools you’ll need for the job. For the beginner 
it should be considered mandatory reading. Even if 
you have a good idea of electrical principles, take 
some time to review the material. A refresher course 
is always useful.
Knowing which tools are safest to use is one of the keys to successful work. Touchless circuit testers let you 
diagnose voltage without exposing wires.

Safety should be the primary concern of anyone 
working with electricity. Although most household 
electrical jobs are simple and straightforward, always 
use caution and good judgment when working with 
electrical wiring or devices. Common sense can 
prevent accidents.
Use only UL-approved electrical parts or devices. 
These devices have been tested for safety by 
Underwriters Laboratories.
wiring saFetY
The basic rule of electrical safety is: Always 
turn off power to the area or device you are 
working on. At the main service panel, remove the 
fuse or shut off the circuit breaker that controls the 
circuit you are servicing. Then check to make sure 
the power is off by testing for power with a 
voltage tester. 
Follow the safety tips shown on these pages. 
Never attempt an electrical project beyond your skill 
or confidence level. Never attempt to repair or replace 
your main service panel or service entrance head. 
These are jobs for a qualified electrician and require 
that the power company shut off power to 
your house.
Shut power OFF at the main service panel or the main 
fuse box before beginning any work.
Create a circuit index and affix it to the inside of the 
door to your main service panel. Update it as needed.
Confirm power is OFF by testing at the outlet, switch, 
or fixture with a voltage tester.

tips For working with eLectricitY
safety tip
Always test a live circuit with the voltage tester 
to verify that the tester is working before you 
rely on it. Restore power only when the repair or 
replacement project is complete.

8
Do not penetrate walls or ceilings without first 
shutting off electrical power to the circuits that may 
be hidden.
Wear rubber-soled shoes while working on electrical 
projects. On damp floors, stand on a rubber mat or dry 
wooden boards.
Use fiberglass or wood ladders when making routine 
household repairs near the service mast.
Extension cords are for temporary use only. Cords 
must be rated for the intended usage.
Breakers and fuses must be compatible with the panel 
manufacturer and match the circuit capacity.
Never alter the prongs of a plug to fit a receptacle. 
If possible, install a new grounded receptacle.

A household electrical system can be compared with 
a home’s plumbing system. Electrical current flows in 
wires in much the same way that water flows inside 
pipes. Both electricity and water enter the home, are 
distributed throughout the house, do their “work,” 
and exit.
In plumbing, water first flows through the 
pressurized water supply system. In electricity, 
current first flows along hot wires. Current flowing 
along hot wires also is pressurized. The pressure of 
electrical current is called voltage.
Large supply pipes can carry a greater volume of 
water than small pipes. Likewise, large electrical 
wires carry more current than small wires. This 
current‑carrying capacity of wires is called amperage.
Water is made available for use through the faucets, 
spigots, and showerheads in a home. Electricity is made 
available through receptacles, switches, and fixtures.
Water finally leaves the home through a drain 
system, which is not pressurized. Similarly, electrical 
current flows back through neutral wires. The 
current in neutral wires is not pressurized and is said 
to be at zero voltage.

parts of the electrical system
The service mast is the metal pole and weatherhead 
that create the entry point for electricity into your home. 
The mast is supplied with three wires carrying 240 volts 
and originating from the nearest transformer.
The electric meter measures the amount of electrical 
power consumed. It is usually attached to the side of 
the house, and connects to the service mast. A thin 
metal disc inside the meter rotates when power is used. 
The electric meter belongs to your local power utility 
company. If you suspect the meter is not functioning 
properly, contact the power company.
Light fixtures attach directly to a household electrical 
system. They are usually controlled with wall switches. 
The two common types of light fixtures are incandescent 
and fluorescent.
A grounding wire connects the electrical system to the 
earth through a metal grounding rod driven next to the 
house, eliminating shock hazards from equipment and 
metallic objects.

11
The main service panel, in the form of a fuse box or 
breaker box, distributes power to individual circuits. 
Fuses or circuit breakers protect each circuit from short 
circuits and overloads. Fuses and circuit breakers also 
are used to shut off power to individual circuits while 
repairs are made.
Electrical boxes enclose wire connections. According 
to the National Electrical Code, all wire splices or 
connections must be contained entirely in a covered 
plastic or metal electrical box.
Receptacles, sometimes called outlets, provide 
plug‑in access to electrical power. A 120‑volt, 15‑amp 
receptacle with a grounding hole is the most typical 
receptacle in wiring systems installed after 1965. Most 
receptacles have two plug‑in locations and are called 
duplex receptacles.
Switches control electrical current passing through 
hot circuit wires. Switches can be wired to control light 
fixtures, ceiling fans, appliances, and receptacles.

An electrical circuit is a continuous loop. Household 
circuits carry power from the main service panel, 
throughout the house, and back to the main service 
panel. Several switches, receptacles, light fixtures, or 
appliances may be connected to a single circuit.
Current enters a circuit loop on hot wires and 
returns along neutral wires. These wires are color 
coded for easy identification. Hot wires are black or 
red, and neutral wires are white or light gray. For 
safety, most circuits include a bare copper or green 
insulated grounding wire. The grounding wire 
conducts current in the event of a ground fault, and 
helps reduce the chance of severe electrical shock. 
The service panel also has a grounding wire 
connected to a metal water pipe and metal ground‑
ing rod buried underground.
If a circuit carries too much power, it can 
overload. A fuse or a circuit breaker protects each 
circuit in case of overloads.
Current returns to the service panel along a 
neutral circuit wire. Current then becomes part of a 
main circuit and leaves the house on a large neutral 
service wire that returns it to the utility 
pole transformer.

Electricity always seeks to return to its source and 
complete a continuous circuit. In a household wiring 
system, this return path is provided by white neutral 
wires that return current to the main service panel. 
From the service panel, current returns along a 
neutral service wire to a power pole transformer.
A grounding wire provides an additional return 
path for electrical current. The grounding wire is a 
safety feature. It is designed to conduct electricity if 
current seeks to return to the service panel along a 
path other than the neutral wire, a condition known 
as a ground fault.
A ground fault is a potentially dangerous 
situation. If an electrical box, tool, or appliance 
becomes short‑circuited and is touched by a person, 
the electrical current may attempt to return to its 
source by passing through that person’s body.
However, electrical current prefers the path of 
least resistance. A grounding wire provides a safe, 
easy path for current to follow back to its utility 
transformer. If a person touches an electrical box, 
tool, or appliance that has a properly installed 
grounding wire, any chance of receiving a severe 
electrical shock is greatly reduced.
In addition, household wiring systems are 
required to be connected directly to the earth. This 
helps to ensure that all equipment and metallic 
objects are held at Earth’s potential (zero volts) to 
eliminate shock hazards. A short circuit can also 
occur when a hot and a neutral conductor come in 
contact. When your electrical system is functioning 
properly, the fuses or circuit breaker will de‑energize 
the circuit to clear the fault.
Grounding of the home electrical system is 
accomplished by wiring the household electrical 
system to a metal cold water pipe and metal ground‑
ing rods that are buried in the earth.
After 1920, most American homes included 
receptacles that accepted polarized plugs. The 
two‑slot polarized plug and receptacle was designed 
to keep hot current flowing along black or red wires, 
and neutral current flowing along white or gray wires.
grounding & poLarization
Normal current flow: Current enters the electrical 
box along a black hot wire, then returns to the service 
panel along a white neutral wire. Any excess current 
passes into the earth via a grounding wire attached to 
grounding rods or a metal water pipe.
Short circuit: Current is detoured by a loose wire in 
contact with the metal box. The grounding wire picks it 
up and channels it safely back to the main service panel. 
There, it returns to its source along a neutral service 
cable or enters the earth via the grounding system.

Armored cable and metal conduit, widely installed 
in homes during the 1940s, provided a true grounding 
path. When connected to metal junction boxes, it 
provided a metal pathway back to the service panel.
Modern cable includes a green insulated or bare 
copper wire that serves as the grounding path. This 
grounding wire is connected to all three‑slot recepta‑
cles and metal boxes to provide a continuous 
pathway for any ground faulted current. By plugging 
a three‑prong plug into a grounded three‑slot 
 receptacle, people are protected from ground faults 
that occur in appliances, tools or other 
electric devices.
Use a receptacle adapter to plug three‑prong plugs 
into two‑slot receptacles, but use it only if the 
receptacle connects to a grounding wire or grounded 
electrical box. Adapters have short grounding wires 
or wire loops that attach to the receptacle’s coverplate 
mounting screw. The mounting screw connects the 
adapter to the grounded metal  electrical box.
Modern NM (nonmetallic) cable, 
found in most wiring systems 
installed after 1965, contains a bare 
copper wire that provides grounding 
for receptacle and switch boxes.
Armored cable is sold pre‑
installed in a flexible metal housing. 
BX, Greenfield, and MC are three 
common types. Metal‑clad cable 
Type MC is shown here. It contains 
a green insulated ground wire along 
with black and white conductors.
Polarized receptacles have a 
long slot and a short slot. Used with 
a polarized plug, the polarized 
receptacle keeps electrical current 
directed for safety.
Three-slot receptacles are 
required by code for new homes. 
They are usually connected 
to a standard two‑wire cable 
with ground.
Receptacle adapter allows 
three‑prong plugs to be inserted into 
two‑slot receptacles. The adapter 
can be used only with grounded 
receptacles, and the grounding 
loop or wire of the adapter must be 
attached to the coverplate mounting 
screw of the receptacle. Use of these 
adapters is generally discouraged.
Double-insulated tools have 
non‑conductive plastic bodies to 
prevent shocks caused by short 
circuits. Because of these features, 
double‑insulated tools can be used 
safely with ungrounded receptacles.

To complete the wiring projects shown in this book, 
you need a few specialty electrical tools as well as a 
collection of basic hand tools. As with any tool 
purchase, invest in good‑quality products when you 
buy tools for electrical work. Keep your tools clean, 
and sharpen or replace any cutting tools that have 
dull edges.
The materials used for electrical wiring have 
changed dramatically in the last 20 years, making it 
much easier for homeowners to do their own 
 electrical work.

Hand tools you’ll need for home wiring projects include: Stud finder/laser level (A) for locating framing 
members and aligning electrical boxes; Tape measure (B); Cable ripper (C) for scoring NM sheathing; Standard (D) and 
Phillips (E) screwdrivers; Utility knife (F); Side cutters (G) for cutting wires; Channel‑type pliers (H) for general gripping 
and crimping; Linesman pliers (I) combine side cutter and gripping jaws; Needlenose pliers (J); Wire strippers (K) for

Electrical tape is never actually used to splice 
or repair electrical wires. If you see electrical 
tape used on any wiring in your home without 
a wire cap, the problem needs to be corrected 
immediately by re‑making the connection with 
a cap.

19
Use a tool belt to keep frequently used tools within easy 
reach. Electrical tapes in a variety of colors are used for 
marking wires and for attaching cables to a fish tape.
A fish tape is useful for installing cables in finished wall 
cavities and for pulling wires through conduit. Products 
designed for lubrication reduce friction and make it 
easier to pull cables and wires.
Diagnostic tools for home wiring use include: Touchless circuit tester (A) to safely check wires for current 
and confirm that circuits are dead; Plug‑in tester (B) to check receptacles for correct polarity, grounding, and circuit 
protection; Multimeter (C) to measure AC/DC voltage, AC/DC current, resistance, capacitance, frequency, and duty 
cycle (model shown is an auto‑ranging digital multimeter with clamp‑on jaws that measure through sheathing and 
wire insulation).

Wires are made of copper, aluminum, or aluminum 
covered with a thin layer of copper. Solid copper wires 
are the best conductors of electricity and are the most 
widely used. Aluminum and copper‑covered aluminum 
wires require special  installation techniques.
A group of two or more wires enclosed in a metal, 
rubber, or plastic sheath is called a cable (photo, 
opposite page). The sheath protects the wires from 
damage. Metal conduit also protects wires, but it is 
not considered a cable.
Individual wires are covered with rubber or plastic 
vinyl insulation. An exception is a bare copper ground‑
ing wire, which does not need an insulation cover. The 
insulation is color coded (chart, left) to identify the 
wire as a hot wire, a neutral wire, or a grounding wire.
In most wiring systems installed after 1965, the 
wires and cables are insulated with plastic vinyl. This 
type of insulation is very durable and can last as long 
as the house itself.
Before 1965, wires and cables were insulated 
with rubber. Rubber insulation has a life expectancy 
of about 25 years. Old insulation that is cracked or 
damaged can be reinforced temporarily by wrapping 
the wire with plastic electrical tape. However, old 
wiring with damaged insulation should be 
inspected by a qualified electrician to make sure it 
is safe.
Wires must be large enough for the amperage 
rating of the circuit (chart, right). A wire that is too 
small can become dangerously hot. Wire sizes are 
categorized according to the American Wire Gauge 
(AWG) system. To check the size of a wire, use the 
wire stripper openings of a combination tool as 
a guide.

Individual wires are color‑coded to identify 
their function. In some circuit installations, the 
white wire serves as a hot wire that carries voltage. 
If so, this white wire may be labeled with black 
tape or paint to identify it as a hot wire.
Wire sizes (shown actual size) are categorized by 
the American Wire Gauge system. The larger the

uF (underground feeder) cable has 
wires embedded in a solid‑core 
plastic vinyl sheathing and includes 
a bare copper grounding wire. it is 
designed for installations in damp 
conditions, such as buried circuits.
knob and tube wiring, so called because of the shape of 
its porcelain insulating brackets, was common before 
1940. wires are covered with a layer of rubberized 
cloth fabric, but have no additional protection.
Metal‑clad (Mc) armored cable has been around since the 1920s. early versions had no grounding 
function, but existed solely to protect the wires that were threaded into it. Later armored cable products 
either had ground wire twisted in with the flexible metal cover or relied on the metal cover itself for 
connecting to ground. Modern Mc contains an insulated ground wire along with the conductors.
Metal conduit was installed during the middle of the 20th century as a way 
to protect hot and neutral conductors. the conduit itself often was employed 
for connecting to ground. Modern conduit (both metal and pVc) should be 
filled with insulated thhn conductors, including an insulated ground wire.
early nM (nonmetallic) cable was used from 1930 until 1965. it features a 
rubberized fabric sheathing that protects individual wires. nM cable greatly 
simplified installations because separate wires no longer had to be pulled by 
hand through a conduit or armored cable. early nM cable had no grounding wire.
nM (nonmetallic) cable was developed around 
1930. the first version had rubberized sheathing 
that degraded rapidly and had no ground wire. 
Modern versions with a hard pVc shell came onto 
the market in the 1960s. sheathing is now color‑
coded by gauge (the yellow seen here is 12 awg).
uF (underground feeder) cable has 
wires embedded in a solid‑core 
plastic vinyl sheathing and includes 
a bare copper grounding wire. it is 
designed for installations in damp 
conditions, such as buried circuits.
knob and tube wiring, so called because of the shape of 
its porcelain insulating brackets, was common before 
1940. wires are covered with a layer of rubberized 
cloth fabric, but have no additional protection.
Metal‑clad (Mc) armored cable has been around since the 1920s. early versions had no grounding 
function, but existed solely to protect the wires that were threaded into it. Later armored cable products 
either had ground wire twisted in with the flexible metal cover or relied on the metal cover itself for 
connecting to ground. Modern Mc contains an insulated ground wire along with the conductors.
Metal conduit was installed during the middle of the 20th century as a way 
to protect hot and neutral conductors. the conduit itself often was employed 
for connecting to ground. Modern conduit (both metal and pVc) should be 
filled with insulated thhn conductors, including an insulated ground wire.
early nM (nonmetallic) cable was used from 1930 until 1965. it features a 
rubberized fabric sheathing that protects individual wires. nM cable greatly 
simplified installations because separate wires no longer had to be pulled by 
hand through a conduit or armored cable. early nM cable had no grounding wire.

Wire “ampacity” is a measurement 
of how much current a wire can carry 
safely. Ampacity varies according to 
the size of the wires, as shown at left. 
When installing a new circuit, choose 
wire with an ampacity rating matching 
the circuit size. For dedicated 
appliance circuits, check the wattage 
rating of the appliance and make 
sure it does not exceed the maximum 
wattage load of the circuit.

reading nM (nonmetallic) cable
NM (nonmetallic) cable is labeled with the number of 
insulated wires it contains. The bare grounding wire is 
not counted. For example, a cable marked 14/2 G (or 14/2 
WITH GROUND) contains two insulated 14‑gauge wires, 
plus a bare copper grounding wire. Cable marked 14/3 
WITH GROUND has three 14‑gauge wires plus a grounding 
wire. NM cable also is stamped with a maximum voltage 
rating, as determined by Underwriters Laboratories (UL).
reading unsheathed, individual wire
Unsheathed, individual wires are used for conduit 
and raceway installations. Wire insulation is coded with 
letters to indicate resistance to moisture, heat, and gas or 
oil. Code requires certain letter combinations for certain 
applications. T indicates thermoplastic insulation. H stands 
for heat resistance and two Hs indicate high resistance (up 
to 194° F). W denotes wire suitable for wet locations. Wire 
coded with an N is impervious to damage from oil or gas.
Use wire connectors rated for the wires you are connecting. Wire connectors are color‑coded by size, but the coding 
scheme varies according to manufacturer. The wire connectors shown above come from one major manufacturer. To 
ensure safe connections, each connector is rated for both minimum and maximum wire capacity. These connectors can 
be used to connect both conducting wires and grounding wires. Green wire connectors are used only for grounding wires.
Use plastic cable staples to fasten cables. Choose 
staples sized to match the cables. Stack‑It® staples (A) hold 
up to four 2‑wire cables; ¾" staples (B) for 12/2, 12/3, and 
all 10‑gauge cables; ½" staples (C) for 14/2, 14/3, or 12/2 
cables; coaxial staples (D) for anchoring television cables; 
bell wire staples (E) for attaching telephone cables.
Push-in connectors are a relatively new product for 
joining wires. Instead of twisting the bare wire ends 
together, you strip off about ¾" of insulation and insert 
them into a hole in the connector. The connectors come 
with two to four holes sized for various gauge wires. These 
connectors are perfect for inexperienced DIYers because 
they do not pull apart like a sloppy twisted connection can.

 Peel back the plastic sheathing 
and the paper wrapping from 
the individual wires.
4 
 Cut away the excess plastic 
sheathing and paper wrapping, 
using the cutting jaws of a 
combination tool.
5 
 Cut individual wires as needed 
using the cutting jaws of the 
combination tool. Leave a 
minimum of 6" of wire running 
past the edge of the box.
6 
 Strip insulation for each wire, 
using the stripper openings. 
Choose the opening that 
matches the gauge of the wire, 
and take care not to nick or 
scratch the ends of the wires.

 Strip about ¾" of insulation from each wire using a combination tool. Choose the stripper opening that matches the 
gauge of the wire, then clamp the wire in the tool. Pull the wire firmly to remove plastic insulation.
2 
 Form a C‑shaped loop in the end of each wire using a needlenose pliers or the hole of the correct gauge in a pair of 
wire strippers. The wire should have no scratches or nicks.
3 
 Hook each wire around the screw terminal so it forms a clockwise loop. Tighten screw firmly. Insulation should 
just touch head of screw. Never place the ends of two wires under a single screw terminal. Instead, use a pigtail wire 
(page 27).
1 
 Mark the amount of insulation to be stripped from each wire using the strip gauge on the back of the switch or 
receptacle. Strip the wires using a combination tool (step 1, above). Never use push‑in fittings with aluminum wiring.
2 
 Insert the bare copper wires firmly into the push‑in fittings on the back of the switch or receptacle. When inserted, 
wires should have no bare copper exposed. Note: Although push‑in fittings are convenient, most experts believe 
screw terminal connections (above) are more dependable.
3 
 Remove a wire from a push‑in fitting by inserting a small nail or screwdriver in the release opening next to the wire. 
Wire will pull out easily.

 Ensure power is off and test for power. Grasp the wires to be joined in the jaws of a pair of linesman’s pliers. The 
ends of the wires should be flush and they should be parallel and touching. Rotate the pliers clockwise two or three 
turns to twist the wire ends together.
2 
 Twist a wire connector over the ends of the wires. Make sure the connector is the right size (see page 23). 
Hand‑twist the connector as far onto the wires as you can. There should be no bare wire exposed beneath the collar 
of the connector.
 
 Option: Reinforce the joint by wrapping it with electrician’s tape. By code, you cannot bind the wire joint with tape 
only, but it can be used as insurance. Few professional electricians use tape for purposes other than tagging wires 
for identification.
 
 Option: Strip ¾" of insulation off the ends of the wires to be joined, and insert each wire into a push‑in connector. 
Gently tug on each wire to make sure it is secure.

Strip ¾" of insulation from each end of the insulated 
wire. 
2 
 Join one end of the pigtail to the wires that will share 
the connection using a wire nut (see previous page).
3 
 Connect the pigtail to the appropriate terminal on 
the receptacle or switch. Fold the wires neatly and 
press the fitting into the box.
pigtaiLing wires
tip
Pigtailing is done mainly to avoid connecting 
multiple wires to one terminal, which is a code 
violation.
alternative:
If you are pigtailing to a grounding screw or 
grounding clip in a metal box, you may find it easier 
to attach one end of the wire to the grounding screw 
before you attach the other end to the other wires.

NM cable is used for all indoor wiring projects 
except those requiring conduit. Cut and install the 
cable after all electrical boxes have been mounted. 
Refer to your wiring plan to make sure each length 
of cable is correct for the circuit size 
and  configuration.
Cable runs are difficult to measure exactly, so 
leave plenty of extra wire when cutting each length. 
Cable splices inside walls are not allowed by code. 
When inserting cables into a circuit breaker panel, 
make sure the power is shut off.
nM caBLe
Pulling cables through studs is easier if you drill 
smooth, straight holes at the same height. Prevent kinks by 
straightening the cable before pulling it through the studs. 
Use plastic grommets to protect cables on steel studs (inset). 
After all cables are installed and all the ground 
wires spliced, call your electrical inspector to arrange 
for the rough‑in inspection. Do not install wallboard 
or attach light fixtures and other devices until this 
inspection is done.

This framing member chart shows the maximum sizes for holes and notches that can be cut into studs and joists 
when running cables. When boring holes, there must be at least 1¼" of wood between the edge of a stud and the hole, 
and at least 2" between the edge of a joist and the hole. Joists can be notched only in the end ⅓ of the overall span; never 
in the middle ⅓ of the joist. If 1¼" clearance cannot possibly be maintained, you may be able to satisfy code by installing 
a metal nail plate over the point of penetration in the stud.

 Drill ⅝" holes in framing members for the cable runs. This is done easily with a right‑angle drill, available at rental 
centers. Holes should be set back at least 1¼" from the front face of the framing members.
2 
 Where cables will turn corners (step 6, page 30), drill intersecting holes in adjoining faces of studs. Measure and cut 
all cables, allowing 2 ft. extra at ends entering the breaker panel and 1 ft. for ends entering the electrical box.
3 
 Shut off power to circuit breaker panel. Use a cable ripper to strip cable, leaving at least ¼" of sheathing to enter the 
circuit breaker panel. Clip away the excess sheathing.
4 
 Open a knockout in the circuit breaker panel using a hammer and screwdriver. Insert a cable clamp into the 
knockout, and secure it with a locknut. Insert the cable through the clamp so that at least ¼" of sheathing extends 
inside the circuit breaker panel. Tighten the mounting screws on the clamp so the cable is gripped securely but not 
so tightly that the sheathing is crushed.

 Anchor the cable to the center of a framing member within 12" of the circuit breaker panel using a cable staple. 
Stack‑It® staples work well where two or more cables must be anchored to the same side of a stud. Run the cable to 
the first electrical box. Where the cable runs along the sides of framing members, anchor it with cable staples no 
more than 4 ft. 6 in. apart.
6 
 At corners, form a slight L‑shaped bend in the end of the cable and insert it into one hole. Retrieve the cable through 
the other hole using needlenose pliers (inset).

 Staple the cable to a framing member 8" from the box. Hold the cable taut against the front of the box, and mark a 
point on the sheathing ½" past the box edge. Remove sheathing from the marked line to the end using a cable ripper, 
and clip away excess sheathing with a combination tool. Insert the cable through the knockout in the box.

13  At each recessed fixture and metal electrical box, connect one end of a grounding pigtail to the metal frame using a 
grounding clip attached to the frame (shown above) or a green grounding screw.
14  At each electrical box and recessed fixture, join grounding wires together with a wire connector. If the box has 
internal clamps, tighten the clamps over the cables.
15  Label the cables entering each box to indicate their destinations. In boxes with complex wiring configurations, also 
tag the individual wires to make final hookups easier. After all cables are installed, your rough‑in work is ready to

If there is no access space above and below a wall, cut openings in the finished walls to run a cable. This often 
occurs in two‑story homes when a cable is extended from an upstairs wall to a downstairs wall. Cut small openings in 
the wall near the top and bottom plates, then drill an angled 1" hole through each plate. Extend a fish tape into the joist 
cavity between the walls and use it to pull the cable from one wall to the next. If the walls line up one over the other 
(left), you can retrieve the fish tape using a piece of stiff wire. If walls do not line up (right), use a second fish tape. After 
running the cable, repair the holes in the walls with patching plaster or wallboard scraps and taping compound.

If you don’t have a fish tape, use a length of sturdy string and a lead 
weight or heavy washer. Drop the line into the stud cavity from above, then 
use a piece of stiff wire to hook the line from below.
Use a flexible drill bit, also called 
a bell‑hanger’s bit, to bore holes 
through framing in finished walls.

 From the unfinished space below the finished wall, look for a reference point, like a soil stack, plumbing pipes, or 
electrical cables, that indicates the location of the wall above. Choose a location for the new cable that does not 
interfere with existing utilities. Drill a 1" hole up into the stud cavity.
2 
 From the unfinished space above the finished wall, find the top of the stud cavity by measuring from the same fixed 
reference point used in step 1. Drill a 1" hole down through the top plate and into the stud cavity using a drill bit extender.
3 
 Extend a fish tape down through the top plate, twisting the tape until it reaches the bottom of the stud cavity. From 
the unfinished space below the wall, use a piece of stiff wire with a hook on one end to retrieve the fish tape through 
the drilled hole in the bottom plate.
4 
 Trim back 2" of sheathing from the end of the NM cable, then insert the wires through the loop at the tip of the fish tape.
5 
 Bend the wires against the cable, then use electrical tape to bind them tightly. Apply cable‑pulling lubricant to the 
taped end of the fish tape.
6 
 From above the finished wall, pull steadily on the fish tape to draw the cable up through the stud cavity. This job 
will be easier if you have a helper feed the cable from below as you pull.

If you don’t have access to a ceiling from above, 
you can run cable for a new ceiling fixture from an existing 
receptacle in the room up the wall and into the ceiling 
without disturbing much of the ceiling. To begin, run cable 
from the receptacle to the stud channel that aligns with 
the ceiling joists on which you want to install a fixture. Be 
sure to plan a location for the new switch. Remove short 
strips of drywall from the wall and ceiling. Make a notch 
in the center of the top plates, and protect the notch with 
metal nail stops. Use a fish tape to pull the new cable up 
through the wall cavity and the notch in top plates. Next, 
use the fish tape to pull the cable through the ceiling to the 
fixture hole. After having your work inspected, replace the 
drywall and install the fixture and switch.

Electrical wiring that runs in exposed locations must 
be protected by rigid tubing called conduit. For 
example, conduit is used for wiring that runs across 
masonry walls in a basement laundry and for 
exposed outdoor wiring. THHN/THWN wire 
normally is installed inside conduit, although UF or 
NM cable can also be installed in conduit.
There are several types of conduit available, so 
check with your electrical inspector to find out which 
type meets code requirements in your area. Conduit 
installed outdoors must be rated for exterior use. 
Metal conduit should be used only with metal boxes, 
never with plastic boxes.
At one time, conduit could only be fitted by using 
elaborate bending techniques and special tools. Now, 
however, a variety of shaped fittings are available to 
let a homeowner join conduit easily.
Electrical Grounding in Metal Conduit: Install 
a green insulated grounding wire for any circuit that 
runs through metal conduit. Although code allows the 
metal conduit to serve as the grounding conductor, 
most electricians install a green insulated wire as a 
more dependable means of grounding the system. The 
grounding wires must be connected to metal boxes with a 
pigtail and grounding screw (left) or grounding clip (right).

codes may vary—check with your 
electrical inspector.
Metal Conduit: EMT is lightweight 
and easy to install. IMC has thicker 
galvanized walls and is a good choice 
for exposed outdoor use. Rigid 
metal conduit provides the greatest 
protection for wires, but it is more 
expensive and requires threaded 
fittings. EMT is the preferred metal 
conduit for home use.

conduit is allowed by many local 
codes. It is assembled with solvent 
glue and PVC fittings that resemble 
those for metal conduit. When 
wiring with PVC conduit, always 
run a green grounding wire.

work with conduit
Conduit types used most in homes are EMT (electrical metallic tubing), IMC (intermediate metallic conduit), 
RNC (rigid nonmetallic conduit), and flexible metal conduit. The most common diameters by far are ½" and ¾", but 
larger sizes are stocked at most building centers.
Nonmetallic conduit fittings typically are solvent 
welded to nonmetallic conduit, as opposed to metal 
conduit, which can be threaded and screwed into threaded 
fittings or attached with setscrews or compression fittings.
A thin-wall conduit bender is used to bend sweeps 
into EMT or IMC conduit.

 Cut the rigid nonmetallic conduit (RNC) to length with a fine‑tooth saw, such as a hacksaw. For larger diameter 
(1½" and above), use a power miter box with a fine‑tooth or plastic cutting blade.
2 
 Deburr the cut edges with a utility knife or fine sandpaper such as emery paper. Wipe the cut ends with a dry rag. 
Also wipe the coupling or fitting to clean it.
3 
 Apply a coat of PVC cement to the end of the conduit and to the inside walls of the coupling (inset). Wear latex 
gloves to protect your hands. The cement should be applied past the point on the conduit where it enters the fitting 
or coupling.
4 
 Insert the conduit into the fitting or coupling and spin it a quarter turn to help spread the cement. Allow the joint 
to set undisturbed for 10 minutes.

The National Electrical Code requires that wire connec‑
tions and cable splices be contained inside an approved 
metal or plastic box. This shields framing members and 
other flammable materials from electrical sparks.
Electrical boxes come in several shapes. Rectan‑
gular and square boxes are used for switches and 
receptacles. Rectangular (2 × 3") boxes are used for 
single switches or duplex receptacles. Square (4 × 4") 
boxes are used any time it is convenient for two 
switches or receptacles to be wired, or “ganged,” in 
one box, an arrangement common in kitchens or 
entry hallways. Octagonal electrical boxes contain 
wire connections for ceiling fixtures.
All electrical boxes are available in different depths. 
A box must be deep enough so a switch or receptacle 
can be removed or installed easily without crimping 
and damaging the circuit wires. Replace an undersized 
box with a larger box using the Electrical Box Chart 
(right) as a guide. The NEC also says that all electrical 
boxes must remain accessible. Never cover an electri‑
cal box with drywall, paneling, or wallcoverings.
eLectricaL Boxes
Octagonal boxes usually contain wire connections for 
ceiling fixtures. Cables are inserted into the box through 
knockout openings and are held with cable clamps. 
Because the ceiling fixture attaches directly to the box, 
the box should be anchored firmly to a framing member. 
Often, it is nailed directly to a ceiling joist. However, 
metal braces are available that allow a box to be mounted 
between joists or studs. A properly installed octagonal 
box can support a ceiling fixture weighing up to 35 
pounds. Any box must be covered with a tightly fitting 
cover plate, and the box must not have open knockouts.

Notes: 
• 
 R = Round; O = Octagonal;  
S = Square or rectangular
• 
 Each hot or neutral wire entering the box is 
counted as one conductor. 
• 
 Grounding wires are counted as one conductor 
in total—do not count each one individually.
• 
 Raceway fittings and external cable clamps 
do not count. Internal cable connectors and 
straps count as either half or one conductor, 
depending on type.
• 
 Devices (switches and receptacles mainly) each 
count as two conductors. 
• 
 When calculating total conductors, any 
nonwire components should be assigned the 
gauge of the largest wire in the box.

Plastic boxes are common in new 
construction. They can be used only 
with NM (nonmetallic) cable. The 
box may include preattached nails 
for anchoring it to framing members. 
Wall switches must have grounding 
screws if installed in plastic boxes.
common electrical Boxes
Rectangular boxes are used with 
wall switches and duplex receptacles. 
Single‑size rectangular boxes 
(shown above) may have detachable 
sides that allow them to be ganged 
together to form double‑size boxes.
Square 4 × 4" boxes are large 
enough for most wiring applications. 
They are used for cable splices and 
ganged receptacles or switches. To 
install one switch or receptacle in a 
square box, use an adapter cover.
Braced octagonal boxes fit 
between ceiling joists. The metal 
braces extend to fit any joist spacing 
and are nailed or screwed to 
framing members.
Outdoor boxes have sealed seams 
and foam gaskets to guard a switch 
or receptacle against moisture. 
Corrosion‑resistant coatings protect 
all metal parts. Code compliant 
models include a watertight hood.
Retrofit boxes can be installed to 
upgrade older boxes or to allow you 
to add new additional receptacles 
and switches. One type (above) has 
built‑in clamps that tighten against 
the inside of a wall and hold the box 
in place.

3½"-deep plastic boxes with preattached mounting nails are used for any wiring project protected by finished walls. 
Common styles include single‑gang (A), double‑gang (B), and triple‑gang (C). Double‑gang and triple‑gang boxes require 
internal cable clamps. Metal boxes (D) should be used for exposed indoor wiring, such as conduit installations in an 
unfinished basement. Metal boxes (E) also can be used for wiring that will be covered by finished walls. Plastic retrofit 
boxes (F) are used when a new switch or receptacle must fit inside a finished wall. Use internal cable clamps.
Additional electrical boxes include: Cast aluminum box (A) for use with outdoor fixtures, including receptacles 
that are wired through metal conduit. These must have in‑use covers if they house receptacles; retrofit ceiling box (B) 
used for light fixtures; light‑duty ceiling fan box (C) with brace that spans ceiling joists; heavy‑duty retrofit ceiling fan 
box (D) designed for retrofit; PVC box (E) for use with PVC conduit in indoor or outdoor setting; wall‑mounted in‑use 
cover (F) for exterior receptacle.

High-quality nonmetallic boxes are rigid and don’t 
contort easily. A variety of adapter plates are available, 
including junction box cover plate (A), single‑gang (B), 
double‑gang (C), and light fixture (D). Adapter plates 
come in several thicknesses to match different 
wall constructions.
Box specifications
Boxes larger than 2 × 4" and all retrofit boxes 
must have internal cable clamps. After installing cables 
in the box, tighten the cable clamps over the cables so 
they are gripped firmly, but not so tightly that the cable 
sheathing is crushed.
Metal boxes must be grounded to the circuit 
grounding system. Connect the circuit grounding wires 
to the box with a green insulated pigtail wire and wire 
connector (as shown) or with a grounding clip (page 32).
Cables entering a metal box must be clamped. 
A variety of clamps are available, including plastic 
clamps (A, C) and threaded metal clamps (B).

Nonmetallic boxes for home use include: Single‑gang, double‑gang, triple gang, and quad boxes (A); thermoset 
and fiberglass boxes for heavier duty (B); round fixture boxes (C) for ceiling installation (nail‑in and with integral 
metal bracket).
nonmetallic Boxes
Nonmetallic electrical boxes have taken over much of 
the do‑it‑yourself market. Most are sold prefitted 
with installation hardware—from metal wings to 10d 
common nails attached at the perfect angle for a 
nail‑in box. 
In addition to cost and availability, nonmetallic 
boxes hold a big advantage over metal boxes in that 
their resistance to conducting electricity will prevent 
a sparking short circuit if a hot wire contacts the box. 
Nonmetallic boxes generally are not approved for 
exposed areas, where they may be susceptible to 
damage. Their lack of rigidity also allows them to 
compress or distort, which can reduce the interior 
capacity beyond code minimums or make outlets 
difficult to attach.
Low cost is the primary reason that blue PVC 
nail‑in boxes are so popular. Not only are they 
inexpensive, they also feature built‑in cable clamps so 
you may not need to buy extra hardware to install 
The bulk of the nonmetallic boxes sold today are 
inexpensive blue PVC. You can also purchase heavier‑duty 
fiberglass or thermoset plastic models that provide a 
nonmetallic option for installing heavier devices.
them. The standard PVC nail‑in box is prefitted with 
a pair of 10d common nails for attaching to exposed 
wall studs. These boxes, often called handy boxes, are 
too small to be of much use (see fill chart, page 40).

Integral ribs cast into many nonmetallic boxes are 
used to register the box against the wall studs so the 
front edges of the box will be flush with the wall surface 
after drywall is installed. Most are set for ½" drywall, 
but if your wall will be a different thickness you may be 
able to find a box with corresponding ribs. Otherwise, 
use a piece of the wallcovering material as a reference.
tips for working with nonmetallic Boxes
Do not break off the tabs that cover cable entry holes in plastic boxes. 
These are not knockouts as you would find in metal boxes. In single‑gang 
boxes (right), the pressure from the tab is sufficient to secure the cable as 
long as it enters with sheathing intact and is stapled no more than 8" from 
the box. On larger boxes (left), you will find traditional knockouts intended 
to be used with plastic cable clamps that resemble metal cable clamps. Use 
these for heavier gauge cable and cable with more than three wires.
Nail-in boxes (A) are prefitted 
with 10d nails that are attached 
perpendicular to the face of 
single‑gang boxes and at an 
inward angle for better gripping 
power on larger boxes. Side‑mount 
boxes (B) feature a nailing plate 
that is attached to the front of 
the stud to automatically create 
the correct setback; adjustable 
side‑mount boxes (C) are installed 
the same way but can be moved 
on the bracket.
Distortion can occur in nonmetallic boxes when 
nails or other fasteners are overdriven or installed at 
improper angles, or when the semiflexible boxes are 
compressed into improperly sized or shaped openings. 
This can reduce the box capacity and prevent devices 
and faceplates from fitting.

Install electrical boxes for receptacles, switches, 
and fixtures only after your wiring project plan has 
been approved by your inspector. Use your wiring 
plan as a guide, and follow electrical code height 
and spacing guidelines when laying out 
box positions.
Always use the deepest electrical boxes that are 
practical for your installation. Using deep boxes 
ensures that you will meet code regulations regard‑
ing box volume and makes it easier to make the 
wire connections.
Some electrical fixtures, like recessed light 
fixtures, electric heaters, and exhaust fans, have 
built‑in wire connection boxes. Install the frames for 
these fixtures at the same time you are installing the 
other electrical boxes.
Electrical boxes in adjacent rooms should be 
positioned close together when they share a common 
wall and are controlled by the same circuit. This 
simplifies the cable installations and also reduces the 
amount of cable needed.
Install Boxes
Fixtures that Do not need electrical Boxes
Recessed fixtures that fit inside wall cavities have built-in wire connection boxes and require no additional 
electrical boxes. Common recessed fixtures include electric blower-heaters (left), bathroom vent fans (right), and recessed 
light fixtures. Install the frames for these fixtures at the same time you are installing the other electrical boxes along the 
circuit. Surface-mounted fixtures like electric baseboard heaters (pages 106 to 109) and under-cabinet fluorescent lights 
also have built-in wire connection boxes. These fixtures are not installed until it is time to make the final hookups.

 Mark the location of each box on studs. Standard receptacle boxes should be centered 12" above floor level. GFCI 
receptacle boxes in a bathroom should be mounted so they will be about 10" above the finished countertop.
2 
 Position each box against a stud so the front face will be flush with the finished wall. For example, if you will be 
installing ½" wallboard, position the box so it extends ½" past the face of the stud. Anchor the box by driving the 
mounting nails into the stud.
3 
 If installing square boxes, attach the adapter plates before positioning the boxes. Use adapter plates that match the 
thickness of the finished wall. Anchor the box by driving the mounting nails into the stud.
4 
 Open one knockout for each cable that will enter the box, using a hammer and screwdriver. Always introduce the 
new cable through the knockout that is farthest way from the wall stud.
5 
 Break off any sharp edges that might damage vinyl cable sheathing by rotating a screwdriver in the knockout.

 Position the light fixture box for a vanity light above the frame opening for a mirror or medicine cabinet. Place the 
box for a ceiling light fixture in the center of the room. Position each box against a framing member so the front face 
will be flush with the finished wall or ceiling, then anchor the box by driving the mounting nails into the framing.
B 
 To position a light fixture between joists, attach an electrical box to an adjustable brace bar. Nail the ends of the brace 
bar to joists so the face of the box will be flush with the finished ceiling surface. Slide the box along the brace bar to the 
desired position, then tighten the mounting screws. Use internal cable clamps when using a box with a brace bar. Note: 
For ceiling fans and heavy fixtures, use a metal box and a heavy-duty brace bar rated for heavy loads (inset photo).
A 
 Install switch boxes at accessible locations, usually on the latch side of a door, with the center of the box 48" from 
the floor. The box for a thermostat is mounted at 48" to 60". Position each box against the side of a stud so the front 
face will be flush with the finished wall, and drive the mounting nails into the stud.
B 
 To install a switch box between studs, first install a cross block between studs, with the top edge 46" above the 
floor. Position the box on the cross block so the front face will be flush with the finished wall, and drive the 
mounting nails into the cross block.

Consider the thickness of finished walls when mounting electrical boxes against framing members. Code 
requires that the front face of boxes be flush with the finished wall surface, so how you install boxes will vary depending 
on the type of wall finish that will be used. For example, if the walls will be finished with ½" wallboard (A), attach 
the boxes so the front faces extend ½" past the front of the framing members. With ceramic tile and wall board (B), 
extend the boxes ⅞" past the framing members. With ¼" Corian® over wallboard (C), boxes should extend ¾"; and with 
wallboard and laminate (D), boxes extend ⅝".
Heights of electrical boxes vary depending on use. In the kitchen shown here, boxes above the countertop are 
45" above the floor, in the center of 18" backsplashes that extend from the countertop to the cabinets. All boxes for wall 
switches also are installed at this height. The center of the box for the microwave receptacle is 72" off the floor. The 
centers of the boxes for the range and food disposer receptacles are 12" off the floor, but the center of the box for the 
dishwasher receptacle is 6" off the floor.

 Turn off power to circuit wires at the main service panel. Carefully remove any tape or wire connectors from the 
exposed splice. Avoid contact with the bare wire ends until the wires have been tested for power.
2 
 Test for power. The tester should not glow. If it does, the wires are still hot. Shut off power to the correct circuit at 
the main service panel. Disconnect the illegally spliced wires.
3 
 Open one knockout for each cable that will enter the box, using a hammer and screwdriver.
Ceiling boxes for lights are generally round or 
octagonal in shape to fit typical lamp mounting plates. 
The easiest way to install one is by nailing the brace to 
open ceiling joists from above. If the ceiling is insulated, 
pull the insulation away from the box if the fixture you’re 
installing is not rated IC for insulation contact.

Attaching an electrical box to a wall stud during new 
construction is relatively easy. The task becomes 
complicated, however, when you’re working in finished 
walls during remodeling or repair. In most cases, it’s 
best to use an electronic stud finder, make a large 
cutout in the wall, and attach a new box directly to a 
framing member or bracing (and then replace and 
refinish the wall materials). But there are occasions 
when this isn’t possible or practical and you just need to 
Install pop‑in retrofit Boxes
Pop‑in boxes for remodeling come in variety of 
styles. For walls, they include plastic retrofit boxes 
with flip-out wings (A), metal or plastic boxes with 
compression tabs or brackets (B), metal retrofit boxes 
with flip-out wings (C), and metal boxes with bendable 
brackets, also known as F-straps, (D). For ceilings, plastic 
fixture boxes with flip-out wings (E) are available.

 To install a dimmer switch or GFCI 
receptacle, you may have to replace 
an old, overcrowded box. Shut off 
power and remove the old switch or 
receptacle. Identify the location of 
nails holding the box to the framing 
member and cut the nails with a 
hacksaw or reciprocating saw with a 
metal blade inserted between the box 
and the stud.
2 
 Bind the cable ends together and 
attach string in case they fall into 
the wall cavity when the old box is 
removed. Disconnect the cable clamps 
and slide the old box out. Install a new 
pop-in box (see next page).

Every home has a main service panel that distributes 
electrical current to the individual circuits. The main 
service panel usually is found in the basement, garage, 
or utility area, and can be identified by its metal 
casing. Before making any repair to your electrical 
system, you must shut off power to the correct circuit 
at the main service panel. The service panel should be 
indexed (page 7) so circuits can be identified easily.
Service panels vary in appearance, depending on 
the age of the system. Very old wiring may operate on 
30‑amp service that has only two circuits. New 
homes can have 200‑amp service with 30 or more 
circuits. Find the size of the service by reading the 
amperage rating printed on the main fuse block or 
main circuit breaker.
Regardless of age, all service panels have fuses or 
circuit breakers that control each circuit and protect 
them from overloads. In general, older service panels use 
fuses, while newer service panels use circuit breakers.
In addition to the main service panel, your electri‑
cal system may have a subpanel that controls some of 
the circuits in the home. A subpanel has its own circuit 
breakers or fuses and is installed to control circuits 
that have been added to an existing wiring system.
The subpanel resembles the main service panel but is 
usually smaller. It may be located near the main panel, or 
it may be found near the areas served by the new circuits. 
Garages and basements that have been updated often 
have their own subpanels. If your home has a subpanel, 
make sure that its circuits are indexed correctly.
When handling fuses or circuit breakers, make 
sure the area around the service panel is dry. Never 
remove the protective cover on the service panel. 
After turning off a circuit to make electrical repairs, 
remember to always test the circuit for power before 
touching any wires.
The main service panel is the heart of your wiring 
system. As our demand for household energy has 
increased, the panels have also grown in capacity. 
Today, a 200-amp panel is considered the minimum for 
new construction.
electrIcal panels
tip
Every house should have a properly labeled service panel. This makes it much easier to find a circuit that has been 
tripped. If the same circuit is regularly tripped, you are either overloading the circuit, or there is a problem with 
the wiring or the circuit breaker.

55
A circuit breaker panel providing 
100 amps or more of power is common in 
wiring systems installed during the 1960s 
and later. A circuit breaker panel is housed 
in a gray metal cabinet that contains two 
rows of individual circuit breakers. The 
size of the service can be identified by 
reading the amperage rating of the main 
circuit breaker, which is located at the top 
or bottom of the main service panel.
A 200-amp service panel is now the 
minimum standard for all new housing. It 
is considered adequate for a medium-sized 
house with no more than three major 
electric appliances. However, larger houses 
with more electrical appliances often are 
equipped with a 400-amp service panel.
To shut off power to individual circuits 
in a circuit breaker panel, flip the lever 
on the appropriate circuit breaker to the 
OFF position. To shut off the power to the 
entire house, turn the main circuit breaker 
to the OFF position.
A 60‑amp fuse panel often is found in 
wiring systems installed between 1950 and 
1965. It usually is housed in a gray metal 
cabinet that contains four individual 
plug fuses, plus one or two pull-out fuse 
blocks that hold cartridge fuses. This 
type of panel is regarded as adequate for 
a small, 1,100-sq. ft. house that has no 
more than one 240-volt appliance. Many 
homeowners update 60-amp service to 100 
amps or more so that additional lighting 
and appliance circuits can be added to 
the system. Home loan programs also may 
require that 60-amp service be updated 
before a home can qualify for financing.
To shut off power to a circuit, carefully 
unscrew the plug fuse, touching only its 
insulated rim. To shut off power to the 
entire house, hold the handle of the main 
fuse block and pull sharply to remove it. 
Major appliance circuits are controlled 
with another cartridge fuse block. Shut off 
the appliance circuit by pulling out this 
fuse block.

The circuit breaker panel is the electrical distribution 
center for your home. It divides the current into 
branch circuits that are carried throughout the house. 
Each branch circuit is controlled by a circuit breaker 
that protects the wires from dangerous current 
overloads. When installing new circuits, the last step 
is to connect the wires to new circuit breakers at the 
panel. Working inside a circuit breaker panel is not 
dangerous if you follow basic safety procedures. 
Always shut off the main circuit breaker and test for 
power before touching any parts inside the panel, and 
never touch the service wire lugs. If unsure of your 
own skills, hire an electrician to make the final circuit 
connections. (If you have an older electrical service 
with fuses instead of circuit breakers, always have an 
electrician make these final hookups.)

If the main circuit breaker panel does not have 
enough open slots to hold new circuit breakers, 
install a subpanel. This job is well within the skill 
level of an experienced do‑it‑yourselfer, although you 
can also hire an electrician to install the subpanel.
Before installing any new wiring, evaluate your 
electrical service to make sure it provides enough 
current to support both the existing wiring and any 
new circuits. If your service does not provide enough 
power, have an electrician upgrade it to a higher 
amp rating. During the upgrade, the electrician will 
install a new circuit breaker panel with enough 
extra breaker slots for the new circuits you want 
to install.
safety Warning
Never touch any parts inside a circuit breaker panel until you have checked for power. Circuit breaker panels 
differ in appearance, depending on the manufacturer. Never begin work in a circuit breaker panel until you 
understand its layout and can identify the parts.

Fuses and circuit breakers are safety devices 
designed to protect the electrical system from short 
circuits and overloads. Fuses and circuit breakers are 
located in the main service panel.
Most service panels installed before 1965 rely on 
fuses to control and protect individual circuits. Screw‑in 
plug fuses protect 120‑volt circuits that power lights and 
receptacles. Cartridge fuses protect 240‑volt appliance 
circuits and the main shutoff of the service panel.
Inside each fuse is a current‑carrying metal alloy 
ribbon. If a circuit is overloaded, the metal ribbon 
melts and stops the flow of power. A fuse must match 
the amperage rating of the circuit. Never replace a 
fuse with one that has a larger amperage rating.
In most service panels installed after 1965, circuit 
breakers protect and control individual circuits. 
Single‑pole circuit breakers protect 120‑volt circuits, 
and double‑pole circuit breakers protect 240‑volt 
circuits. Amperage ratings for circuit breakers range 
from 15 to 100 amps.
Each circuit breaker has a permanent metal strip 
that heats up and bends when voltage passes through 
Circuit breakers are found in the majority of panels 
installed since the 1940s. Single-pole breakers control 
120-volt circuits. Double-pole breakers rated for 20 to 
60 amps control 240-volt circuits. Ground-fault circuit 
interrupter (GFCI) and arc-fault circuit interrupter 
(AFCI) breakers provide protection from shocks and 
fire-causing arcs for the entire circuit.
Fuses & circuit Breakers
Fuses are used in older service panels. Plug fuses 
usually control 120-volt circuits rated for 15, 20, or 30 
amps. Tamper-proof plug fuses have threads that fit 
only matching sockets, making it impossible to install 
a wrong-sized fuse. Time-delay fuses absorb temporary 
heavy power loads without blowing. Cartridge fuses 
control 240-volt circuits and range from 30 to 100 amps.
it. If a circuit is overloaded, the metal strip inside the 
breaker bends enough to “trip” the switch and stop 
the flow of power. Circuit breakers are listed to trip 
twice. After the second trip they weaken and tend to 
nuisance trip at lower currents. Replace breakers that 
have tripped more than twice—they may fail. Worn 
circuit breakers should be replaced by an electrician.
When a fuse blows or a circuit breaker trips, it is 
usually because there are too many light fixtures and 
plug‑in appliances drawing power through the circuit. 
Move some of the plug‑in appliances to another 
circuit, then replace the fuse or reset the breaker. If 
the fuse blows or the breaker trips again immediately, 
there may be a short circuit in the system. Call a 
licensed electrician if you suspect a short circuit.

1 
 Locate the blown fuse at the main service panel. If the metal ribbon inside is cleanly melted (right), the circuit was 
overloaded. If window is discolored (left), there was a short circuit.
2 
 Unscrew the fuse, being careful to touch only the insulated rim of the fuse. Replace it with a fuse that has the same 
amperage rating.
1 
 Remove cartridge fuses by gripping the handle of the fuse block and pulling sharply.
2 
 Remove the individual cartridge fuses from the block using a fuse puller.
3 
 Test each fuse using a continuity tester. If the tester glows, the fuse is good. If not, install a new fuse with the same 
amperage rating.
1 
 Open the service panel and locate the tripped breaker. The lever on the tripped breaker will be either in the OFF 
position, or in a position between ON and OFF.
2 
 Reset the tripped circuit breaker by pressing the circuit breaker lever all the way to the OFF position, then pressing 
it to the ON position.
3 
 Test AFCI and GFCI circuit breakers by pushing the TEST button. The breaker should trip to the OFF position.  
If not, the breaker is faulty and must be replaced by an electrician.

The last step in a wiring project is connecting circuits 
at the breaker panel. After this is done, the work is 
ready for the final inspection.
Circuits are connected at the main breaker panel, 
if it has enough open slots, or at a circuit breaker 
subpanel. When working at a subpanel, make sure 
the feeder breaker at the main panel has been turned 
off, and test for power (photo, right) before touching 
any parts in the subpanel.
Make sure the circuit breaker amperage does not 
exceed the ampacity of the circuit wires you are 
connecting to it. Also be aware that circuit breaker 
styles and installation techniques vary according to 
manufacturer. Use breakers designed for your type of 
panel. For most rooms in a home, in addition to the 
kitchen, basement, and bathroom, an AFCI breaker 
needs to be installed.
Test for current before touching any parts inside a 
circuit breaker panel. With main breaker turned off but all 
other breakers turned on, touch one probe of a neon tester 
to the neutral bus bar, and touch the other probe to each 
setscrew on one of the double-pole breakers (not the main 
breaker). If tester does not light for either setscrew, it is safe 
to work in the panel. Note: Touchless circuit testers are 
preferred in most situations where you are testing for current 
because they’re safer. But in some instances you’ll need a 
tester with individual probes to properly check for current.
connecting circuit Breakers
1 
 Shut off the main circuit breaker in the main circuit breaker panel (if you are working in a subpanel, shut off the 
feeder breaker in the main panel). Remove the panel cover plate, taking care not to touch the parts inside the panel. 
Test for power (photo, top).
2 
 Open a knockout in the side of the circuit breaker panel using a screwdriver and hammer. Attach a cable clamp to 
the knockout.
3 
 Hold cable across the front of the panel near the knockout, and mark sheathing about ½" inside the edge of the 
panel. Strip the cable from the marked line to the end using a cable ripper. (There should be 18 to 24" of excess 
cable.) Insert the cable through the clamp and into the service panel, then tighten the clamp.

around the inside edge of the panel.
5 
 For 120-volt circuits, bend the white circuit wire around the outside of the panel to an open setscrew terminal on 
the neutral bus bar. Clip away excess wire, then strip ½" of insulation from the wire using a combination tool. Insert 
the wire into the terminal opening, and tighten the setscrew.
6 
 Strip ½" of insulation from the end of the black circuit wire. Insert the wire into the setscrew terminal on a new 
single-pole circuit breaker, and tighten the setscrew.
7 
  Slide one end of the circuit breaker onto the guide hook, then press it firmly against the bus bar until it snaps into 
place. (Breaker installation may vary, depending on the manufacturer.) Fold excess black wire around the inside 
edge of the panel.

 120/240-volt circuits (top): Connect red and black wires to the double-pole breaker. Connect white wire to the neutral 
bus bar, and grounding wire to the grounding bus bar. For 240-volt circuits (bottom), attach white and black wires to 
the double-pole breaker, tagging white wire with black tape. There is no neutral bus bar connection on this circuit.
9 
 Remove the appropriate breaker knockout on the panel cover plate to make room for the new circuit breaker. A 
single-pole breaker requires one knockout, while a double-pole breaker requires two knockouts. Reattach the cover 
plate, and label the new circuit on the panel index.

An average wall switch is turned on and off more 
than 1,000 times each year. Because switches receive 
constant use, wire connections can loosen and 
switch parts gradually wear out. If a switch no longer 
operates smoothly, it must be repaired or replaced.
The methods for repairing or replacing a switch 
vary slightly, depending on the switch type and its 
location along an electrical circuit. When working on 
a switch, use the photographs on pages 64 to 67 to 
identify your switch type and its wiring configura‑
tion. Individual switch styles may vary from 
manufacturer to manufacturer, but the basic switch 
types are universal.
It is possible to replace most ordinary wall 
switches with a specialty switch, like a timer switch 
or an electronic switch. When installing a specialty 
switch, make sure it is compatible with the wiring 
configuration of the switch box.
Wall sWItches
A typical wall switch has a movable metal arm that opens and closes the electrical circuit. When the switch is ON, 
the arm completes the circuit and power flows between the screw terminals and through the black hot wire to the light 
fixture. When the switch is OFF, the arm lifts away to interrupt the circuit, and no power flows. Switch problems can 
occur if the screw terminals are not tight or if the metal arm inside the switch wears out. The switch above has had 
part of its housing removed so the interior workings can be seen. Switches or fixtures that are not in original condition 
should never be installed.

Electronic motion‑sensor 
switches have an infrared eye that 
senses movement and automatically 
turns on lights when a person 
enters a room. Motion-sensor 
switches can provide added security 
against intruders.
Rotary snap switches are found 
in many installations completed 
between 1900 and 1920. The handle 
is twisted clockwise to turn light on 
and off. The switch is enclosed in a 
ceramic housing.
Push‑button switches were 
widely used from 1920 until about 
1940. Many switches of this type are 
still in operation. Reproductions of 
this switch type are available for 
restoration projects.
Toggle switches were introduced 
in the 1930s. This early design has a 
switch mechanism that is mounted 
in a ceramic housing sealed with a 
layer of insulating paper.
Toggle switches were improved 
during the 1950s and are now the 
most commonly used type. This 
switch type was the first to use a 
sealed plastic housing that protects 
the inner switch mechanism from 
dust and moisture.
Mercury switches became 
common in the early 1960s. They 
conduct electrical current by means 
of a sealed vial of mercury. No longer 
manufactured for home use, old 
mercury switches are considered a 
hazardous waste.

64
Wall switches are available in three general types. To 
repair or replace a switch, it is important to identify 
its type.
Single‑pole switches are used to control a set of 
lights from one location. Three‑way switches are used 
to control a set of lights from two different locations 
and are always installed in pairs. Four‑way switches 
are used in combination with a pair of three‑way 
switches to control a set of lights from three or 
more locations.
Identify switch types by counting the screw 
terminals. Single‑pole switches have two screw 
terminals, three‑way switches have three screw 
terminals, and four‑way switches have four. Most 
switches include a grounding screw terminal, which 
is identified by its green color.
When replacing a switch, choose a new switch 
that has the same number of screw terminals as the 
old one. The location of the screws on the switch 
body varies depending on the manufacturer, but 
these differences will not affect the switch operation.
Whenever possible, connect switches using the 
screw terminals rather than push‑in fittings. Some 
specialty switches have wire leads instead of screw 
terminals. They are connected to circuit wires with 
wire connectors.
types oF Wall sWItches
A wall switch is connected to circuit 
wires with screw terminals or with 
push-in fittings on the back of the switch. 
A switch may have a stamped strip gauge 
that indicates how much insulation must 
be stripped from the circuit wires to 
make the connections.
The switch body is attached to a metal 
mounting strap that allows it to be 
mounted in an electrical box. Several 
rating stamps are found on the strap and 
on the back of the switch. The abbreviation 
UL or UND LAB INC LIST means that the 
switch meets the safety standards of the 
Underwriters Laboratories. Switches also 
are stamped with maximum voltage and 
amperage ratings. Standard wall switches 
are rated 15A or 125V. Voltage ratings 
of 110, 120, and 125 are considered to be 
identical for purposes of identification.
For standard wall switch installations, 
choose a switch that has a wire gauge 
rating of #12 or #14. For wire systems with 
solid-core copper wiring, use only switches 
marked COPPER or CU. For aluminum 
wiring, use only switches marked CO/ALR. 
Switches marked AL/CU can no longer be 
used with aluminum wiring, according to 
the National Electrical Code.

A single‑pole switch is the most common type of wall 
switch. It has ON‑OFF markings on the switch lever 
and is used to control a set of lights, an appliance, or 
a receptacle from a single location. A single‑pole 
switch has two screw terminals and a grounding 
screw. When installing a single‑pole switch, check to 
make sure the ON marking shows when the switch 
lever is in the up position.
In a correctly wired single‑pole switch, a hot 
circuit wire is attached to each screw terminal. 
However, the color and number of wires inside the 
switch box will vary, depending on the location of the 
switch along the electrical circuit.
If two cables enter the box, then the switch lies in 
the middle of the circuit. In this installation, both of 
the hot wires attached to the switch are black.
If only one cable enters the box, then the switch lies 
at the end of the circuit. In this installation (sometimes 
called a switch loop), one of the hot wires is black, but 
the other hot wire usually is white. A white hot wire 
should be coded with black tape or paint.
typical single‑pole switch Installations
A single‑pole switch is essentially an interruption in 
the black power supply wire that is opened or closed with 
the toggle. Single-pole switches are the simplest of all 
home wiring switches.
Two cables enter the box when a switch is located 
in the middle of a circuit. Each cable has a white and a 
black insulated wire, plus a bare copper grounding wire. 
The black wires are hot and are connected to the screw 
terminals on the switch. The white wires are neutral and 
are joined together with a wire connector. Grounding 
wires are pigtailed to the switch.
single‑pole Wall switches
One cable enters the box when a switch is located at 
the end of a circuit. The cable has a white and a black 
insulated wire, plus a bare copper grounding wire. In 
this installation, both of the insulated wires are hot. The 
white wire may be labeled with black tape or paint to 
identify it as a hot wire. The grounding wire is connected 
to the switch grounding screw.

One cable enters the box if the switch lies at the end 
of the circuit. The cable has a black wire, red wire, and 
white wire, plus a bare copper grounding wire. The black 
wire must be connected to the common screw terminal, 
which is darker than the other two screw terminals. The 
white and red wires are connected to the two traveler 
screw terminals. The white wire is taped to indicate that 
it is hot. The bare copper grounding wire is connected to 
the grounded metal box.
Two cables enter the box if the switch lies in the 
middle of a circuit. One cable has two wires, plus a bare 
copper grounding wire; the other cable has three wires, 
plus a ground. The black wire from the two-wire cable is 
connected to the dark common screw terminal. The red 
and black wires from the three-wire cable are connected 
to the traveler screw terminals. The white neutral wires 
are joined together with a wire connector, and the 
grounding wires are pigtailed to the grounded metal box.
Three‑way switches have three screw terminals and 
do not have ON‑OFF markings. Three‑way switches 
are always installed in pairs and are used to control a 
set of lights from two locations.
One of the screw terminals on a three‑way switch 
is darker than the others. This screw is the common 
screw terminal. The position of the common screw 
terminal on the switch body may vary, depending on 
the manufacturer. Before disconnecting a three‑way 
switch, always label the wire that is connected to the 
common screw terminal. It must be reconnected to 
the common screw terminal on the new switch.
The two, lighter‑colored screw terminals on a 
three‑way switch are called the traveler screw 
terminals. The traveler terminals are interchangeable, 
so there is no need to label the wires attached to them.
Because three‑way switches are installed in pairs, it 
is sometimes difficult to determine which of the 
switches is causing a problem. The switch that receives 
greater use is more likely to fail, but you may need to 
inspect both switches to find the source of the problem.

 Turn off the power to the switch at the main service panel, then remove the switch cover plate and mounting 
screws. Holding the mounting strap carefully, pull the switch from the box. Be careful not to touch the bare wires or 
screw terminals until they have been tested for power.
2 
 Test for power by touching one probe of the circuit tester to the grounded metal box or to the bare copper 
grounding wire, and touching the other probe to each screw terminal. Tester should not glow. If it does, there is still 
power entering the box. Return to the service panel, and turn off the correct circuit.
3 
 Locate the dark common screw terminal, and use masking tape to label the “common” wire attached to it. 
Disconnect wires and remove the switch. Test the switch for continuity. If it tests faulty, buy a replacement. Inspect 
wires for nicks and scratches. If necessary, clip damaged wires and strip them.
4 
 Connect the common wire to the dark common screw terminal on the switch. On most three-way switches, the 
common screw terminal is black. Or it may be labeled with the word COMMON stamped on the back of the switch. 
Reconnect the grounding screw; connect it to the circuit grounding wires with a pigtail.
5 
 Connect the remaining two circuit wires to the screw terminals. These wires are interchangeable and can be 
connected to either screw terminal. Carefully tuck the wires into the box. Remount the switch, and attach the cover 
plate. Turn on the power at the main service panel.

A dimmer switch makes it possible to 
vary the brightness of a light fixture. 
Dimmers are often installed in dining 
rooms, recreation areas, or bedrooms.
Any standard single‑pole switch 
can be replaced with a dimmer, as 
long as the switch box is of adequate 
size. Dimmer switches have larger 
bodies than standard switches. They 
also generate a small amount of heat 
that must dissipate. For these reasons, 
dimmers should not be installed in 
undersized electrical boxes or in boxes 
that are crowded with circuit wires. 
Always follow the manufacturer’s 
specifications for installation.
In lighting configurations that use 
three‑way switches (pages 66 to 67), 
replace the standard switches with 
special three‑way dimmers. If replac‑
ing both the switches with dimmers, 
buy a packaged pair of three‑way 
dimmers designed to work together.
Dimmer switches are available in 
several styles (photo, right). All types 
have wire leads instead of screw 
terminals, and they are connected to 
circuit wires using wire connectors. 
Some types have a green grounding 
lead that should be connected to the 
grounded metal box or to the bare 
copper  grounding wires.

Toggle‑type dimmer 
resembles standard switches. 
Toggle dimmers are available 
in both single-pole and 
three-way designs.
Dial‑type dimmer is the most 
common style. Rotating the dial 
changes the light intensity.
Slide‑action dimmer has an 
illuminated face that makes the 
switch easy to locate in the dark.
Automatic dimmer has an 
electronic sensor that adjusts 
the light fixture to compensate 
for the changing levels of natural 
light. An automatic dimmer also 
can be operated manually.

 Turn off the power to the switch at the main service panel, then remove the cover plate and mounting screws. 
Holding the mounting straps carefully, pull the switch from the box. Be careful not to touch bare wires or screw 
terminals until they have been tested for power.
2 
 Disconnect the circuit wires and remove the switch. Straighten the circuit wires, and clip the ends, leaving about ½" 
of the bare wire end exposed.
3 
 Connect the wire leads on the dimmer switch to the circuit wires using wire connectors. The switch leads are 
interchangeable and can be attached to either of the two circuit wires.
4 
 A three-way dimmer has an additional wire lead. This “common” lead is connected to the common circuit wire. 
When replacing a standard three-way switch with a dimmer, the common circuit wire is attached to the darkest 
screw terminal on the old switch.

A switch that does not work properly may have 
worn or broken internal parts. Test switches 
with a battery‑operated continuity tester. The 
continuity tester detects any break in the metal 
pathway inside the switch. Replace the switch 
if the continuity tester shows the switch to 
be faulty.
Never use a continuity tester on wires that might 
carry live current. Always shut off the power and 
disconnect the switch before testing for continuity.
Some specialty switches, like dimmers, cannot be 
tested for continuity. Electronic switches can be tested 
for manual operation using a continuity tester, but the 
automatic operation of these switches cannot be tested.

 Attach the clip of the tester to one of the screw terminals. Touch the tester probe to the other screw terminal. Flip 
the switch lever from ON to OFF. If the switch is good, the tester glows when lever is ON, but not when OFF.
B 
 A continuity tester uses battery-generated current to test the metal pathways running through switches and other 
electrical fixtures. Always “test” the tester before use. Touch the tester clip to the metal probe. The tester should 
glow. If not, then the battery or lightbulb is dead and must be replaced.

 Attach the tester clip to the dark common screw terminal. Touch the tester probe to one of the traveler screw terminals, and 
flip the switch lever back and forth. If the switch is good, the tester should glow when the lever is in one position, but not both.
2 
 Touch the probe to the other traveler screw terminal, and flip the switch lever back and forth. If the switch is good, 
the tester will glow only when the switch lever is in the position opposite from the positive test in step 1.
1 
 Test the switch by touching the probe and clip of the continuity tester to each pair of screw terminals (A-B, C-D, A-D, B-C, A-C, 
B-D). The test should show continuous pathways between two different pairs of screw terminals. Flip the lever to the opposite 
position, and repeat the test. The test should show continuous pathways between two different pairs of screw terminals.
2 
 If the switch is good, the test will show a total of four continuous pathways between screw terminals—two pathways 
for each lever position. If not, then the switch is faulty and must be replaced. (The arrangement of the pathways may 
differ, depending on the switch manufacturer. The photo above shows the three possible pathway arrangements.)

A 120‑volt duplex receptacle can be wired to the 
electrical system in a number of ways. The most 
common are shown on these pages.
Wiring configurations may vary slightly from 
these photographs, depending on the kind of recepta‑
cles used, the type of cable, or the technique of the 
electrician who installed the wiring. To make 
dependable repairs or replacements, use masking 
tape and label each wire according to its location on 
the terminals of the existing receptacle.
Receptacles are wired as either end‑of‑run or 
middle‑of‑run. These two basic configurations are 
easily identified by counting the number of cables 
entering the receptacle box. End‑of‑run wiring has 
only one cable, indicating that the circuit ends. 
Middle‑of‑run wiring has two cables, indicating that 
the circuit continues on to other receptacles, 
switches, or fixtures.
Two cables entering the box indicate middle‑of‑run 
wiring. Black hot wires are connected to brass screw 
terminals, and white neutral wires to silver screw 
terminals. The grounding wire is pigtailed to the 
grounding screws of the receptacle and the box.
Receptacle WiRing
A split‑circuit receptacle is shown on the next 
page. Each half of a split‑circuit receptacle is wired to a 
separate circuit. This allows two appliances of high 
wattage to be plugged into the same receptacle 
without blowing a fuse or tripping a breaker. This 
wiring configuration is similar to a receptacle that is 
controlled by a wall switch. Code requires a 
switch‑controlled receptacle in any room that does not 
have a built‑in light fixture operated by a wall switch.
Split‑circuit and switch‑controlled receptacles are 
connected to two hot wires, so use caution during 
repairs or replacements. Make sure the connecting 
tab between the hot screw terminals is removed.
Two‑slot receptacles are common in older homes. 
There is no grounding wire attached to the recepta‑
cle, but the box may be grounded with armored cable 
or conduit. Tamper‑resistant receptacles are now 
required in all new residential installations.
Single cable entering the box indicates end‑of‑run 
wiring. The black hot wire is attached to a brass screw 
terminal, and the white neutral wire is connected to a 
silver screw terminal. If the box is metal, the grounding 
wire is pigtailed to the grounding screws of the 
receptacle and the box. In a plastic box, the grounding 
wire is attached directly to the grounding screw terminal 
of the receptacle.

A split‑circuit receptacle 
is attached to a black hot wire, a red 
hot wire, a white neutral wire, and 
a bare grounding wire. The wiring 
is similar to a switch-controlled 
receptacle. The hot wires are 
attached to the brass screw 
terminals, and the connecting tab 
or fin between the brass terminals is 
removed. The white wire is attached 
to a silver screw terminal, and the 
connecting tab on the neutral side 
remains intact. The grounding wire 
is pigtailed to the grounding screw 
terminal of the receptacle and to 
the grounding screw attached to 
the box.
A two‑slot receptacle is often 
found in older homes. The black 
hot wires are connected to the 
brass screw terminals, and the 
white neutral wires are pigtailed 
to a silver screw terminal. Two-slot 
receptacles may be replaced with 
three-slot types, but only if a means 
of grounding exists at the receptacle 
box. In some municipalities, you 
may replace a two-slot receptacle 
with a GFCI receptacle as long as the 
receptacle has a sticker that reads 
“No equipment ground.”

The standard duplex receptacle has two halves for receiving plugs. Each 
half has a long (neutral) slot, a short (hot) slot, and a U-shaped grounding 
hole. The slots fit the wide prong, narrow prong, and grounding prong of a 
three-prong plug. This ensures that the connection between receptacle and 
plug will be polarized and grounded for safety.
Wires are attached to the receptacle at screw terminals or push-in 
fittings. A connecting tab between the screw terminals allows a variety of 
different wiring configurations. Receptacles also include mounting straps for 
attaching to electrical boxes.
Stamps of approval from testing agencies are found on the front and 
back of the receptacle. Look for the symbol UL or UND LAB INC LIST to make 
sure the receptacle meets the strict standards of Underwriters Laboratories.
The receptacle is marked with ratings for maximum volts and amps. The 
common receptacle is marked 15A, 125V. Receptacles marked CU or COPPER 
are used with solid copper wire. Those marked CU-CLAD ONLY are used with 
copper-coated aluminum wire. Only receptacles marked CO/ALR may be used 
with solid aluminum wiring. Receptacles marked AL/CU no longer may be 
used with aluminum wire, according to code.
The ground‑fault 
circuit‑interrupter, 
or GFCI receptacle, is a modern 
safety device. When it detects slight 
changes in current, it instantly shuts 
off power.

Household receptacles, also called outlets, have no 
moving parts to wear out and usually last for many 
years without servicing. Most problems associated 
with receptacles are actually caused by faulty lamps 
and appliances, or their plugs and cords. However, 
the constant plugging in and removal of appliance 
cords can wear out the metal contacts inside a 
receptacle. Any receptacle that does not hold plugs 
firmly should be replaced. In addition, older 
receptacles made of hard plastic may harden and 
crack with age. They must be replaced when 
this happens.
A loose wire connection with the receptacle box is 
another possible problem. A loose connection can 
spark (called arcing), trip a circuit breaker, or cause 
heat to build up in the receptacle box, creating a 
potential fire hazard.
Wires can come loose for a number of reasons. 
Everyday vibrations caused by walking across floors, 
or from nearby street traffic, may cause a connection 
to shake loose. In addition, because wires heat and 
cool with normal use, the ends of the wires will 
expand and contract slightly. This movement also 
may cause the wires to come loose from the screw 
terminal connections.
Not all receptacles are created equally. When 
replacing, make sure to buy one with the same amp 
rating as the old one. Inadvertently installing a 
20‑amp receptacle in replacement of a 15‑amp 
receptacle is a very common error.

A GFCI wired for single‑location protection (shown 
from the back) has hot and neutral wires connected only 
to the screw terminals marked LINE. A GFCI connected 
for single-location protection may be wired as either an 
end-of-run or middle-of-run configuration.
The ground‑fault circuit‑interrupter (GFCI) recepta‑
cle protects against electrical shock caused by a 
faulty appliance, or a worn cord or plug. It senses 
small changes in current flow and can shut off power 
in as little as 1⁄40 of a second.
GFCIs are now required in bathrooms, kitchens, 
garages, crawl spaces, unfinished basements, and 
outdoor receptacle locations. Consult your local 
codes for any requirements regarding the installation 
of GFCI receptacles. Most GFCIs use standard screw 
terminal connections, but some have wire leads and 
are attached with wire connectors. Because the body 
of a GFCI receptacle is larger than a standard 
receptacle, small crowded electrical boxes may need 
to be replaced with more spacious boxes.
The GFCI receptacle may be wired to protect only 
itself (single location), or it can be wired to protect all 
receptacles, switches, and light fixtures from the GFCI 
“forward” to the end of the circuit (multiple locations).
Because the GFCI is so sensitive, it is most 
effective when wired to protect a single location. The 
more receptacles any one GFCI protects, the more 
susceptible it is to “phantom tripping,” shutting off 
power because of tiny, normal fluctuations in current 
flow. GFCI receptacles installed in outdoor locations 
must be rated for outdoor use and weather resistance 
(WR) along with ground fault protection.
A GFCI wired for multiple‑location protection 
(shown from the back) has one set of hot and neutral 
wires connected to the LINE pair of screw terminals, 
and the other set connected to the LOAD pair of 
screw terminals. A GFCI receptacle connected for 
multiple-location protection may be wired only as a 
middle-of-run configuration.
gFcI receptacles
Modern GFCI receptacles have tamper-resistant slots. 
Look for a model that’s rated “WR” (for weather resistance) 
if you’ll be installing it outdoors or in a wet location.

For testing receptacles and other devices for power, 
grounding, and polarity, neon circuit testers are 
inexpensive and easy to use. But they are less 
sensitive than auto‑ranging multimeters. In some 
cases, neon testers won’t detect the presence of lower 
voltage in a circuit. This can lead you to believe that a 
circuit is shut off when it is not—a dangerous 
mistake. The small probes on a neon circuit tester 
also force you to get too close to live terminals and 
wires. For a quick check and confirmation, a neon 
circuit tester (or a plug‑in tester) is adequate. But for 
the most reliable readings, buy and learn to use 
a multimeter. 
The best multimeters are auto‑ranging models 
with a digital readout. Unlike manual multimeters, 
auto‑ranging models do not require you to preset the 
voltage range to get an accurate reading. Unlike neon 
testers, multimeters may be used for a host of 
additional diagnostic functions such as testing fuses, 
measuring battery voltage, testing internal wiring in 
appliances, and checking light fixtures to determine 
if they’re functional.

testIng receptacles
Use a touchless circuit tester to verify that power 
is not flowing to a receptacle. Using either a no-touch 
sensor or a probe-style circuit tester, test the receptacle 
for current before you remove the cover plate. Once the 
plate is removed, double-check at the terminals to make 
sure there is no current.
Use a plug‑in tester to test a three-slot receptacle. With 
the power on, insert the tester into the suspect outlet. The 
face of the tester has three colored lights that will light 
up in different combinations, according to the outlet’s 
problem. A reference chart is provided with the tester, and 
may have a chart on the tester itself.

 Insert the test ends of the probe into the receptacle

you will see a voltage reading on the readout screen.
3 
 If the multimeter reads 0 or gives a very low reading 
(less than 1 or 2 volts), power is not present in the 
receptacle and it is safe to remove the cover plate 
and work on the fixture (although it’s always a good 
idea to confirm your reading by touching the probes 
directly to the screw terminals on the receptacles).

power off, remove the receptacle and separate the 
wires. Restore power. Touch one probe to the bare 
ground or the grounded metal box and touch the 
other probe to the end of each wire. The wire that 
shows current on the meter is hot.

eVen tHOuGH tHIS BOOk does not cover a major 
wiring construction project in detail, here are some 
guidelines for a major project, should you decide to 
pursue one. 
Careful planning of a wiring project ensures you 
will have plenty of power for present and future 
needs. Whether you are adding circuits in a room 
addition, wiring a remodeled kitchen, or adding an 
outdoor circuit, consider all possible ways the space 
might be used, and plan for enough electrical service 
to meet peak needs.
A large wiring project adds a considerable load 
to your main electrical service. In about 25 percent 
of all homes, some type of service upgrade is 
needed before new wiring can be installed. This 
chapter gives an easy five‑step method for 
determining your electrical needs and planning 
new circuits.
Five Steps for Planning a Wiring Project
1 
 Examine your main service panel. The amp rating of the electrical service and the size of the circuit breaker panel 
will help you determine if a service upgrade is needed.
2 
 Learn about codes. The National Electrical Code (NEC), and local electrical codes and building codes, provide 
guidelines for determining how much power and how many circuits your home needs. Your local electrical 
inspector can tell you which regulations apply to your job.
3 
 Prepare for inspections. Remember that your work must be reviewed by your local electrical inspector. When 
planning your wiring project, always follow the inspector’s guidelines for quality workmanship.
4 
 Evaluate electrical loads. New circuits put an added load on your electrical service. Make sure that the total load of 
the existing wiring and the planned new circuits does not exceed the main service capacity.
5 
 Draw a wiring diagram and get a permit. This wiring plan will help you organize your work.

The first step in planning a new wiring project is to 
look in your main circuit breaker panel and find the 
size of the service by reading the amperage rating on 
the main circuit breaker. As you plan new circuits 
and evaluate electrical loads, knowing the size of the 
main service helps you determine if you need a 
service upgrade.
Also look for open circuit breaker slots in the 
panel. The number of open slots will determine if you 
need to add a circuit breaker subpanel.
Find the service size by opening the main service 
panel and reading the amp rating printed on the main 
circuit breaker. In most cases, 100‑amp service provides 
enough power to handle the added loads of projects like 
the ones shown in this book. A service rated for 60 amps 
or less may need to be upgraded.
Older service panels use fuses instead of circuit 
breakers. Have an electrician replace this type of panel 
with a circuit breaker panel that provides enough power 
and enough open breaker slots for the new circuits you 
are planning.

examine Your Main Service Panel
Look for open circuit breaker slots in the main circuit breaker panel or in a circuit breaker subpanel, if your home 
already has one. You will need one open slot for each 120‑volt circuit you plan to install and two slots for each 240‑volt 
circuit. If your main circuit breaker panel has no open breaker slots, install a subpanel to provide room for connecting 
new circuits.

To ensure public safety, your community requires 
that you get a permit to install new wiring and have 
the completed work reviewed by an appointed 
inspector. Electrical inspectors use the National 
Electrical Code (NEC) as the primary authority for 
evaluating wiring, but they also follow the local 
Building Code and Electrical Code standards.
As you begin planning new circuits, call or 
visit your local electrical inspector and discuss 
the project with him. The inspector can tell you 
which of the national and local code requirements 
apply to your job, and may give you a packet of 
information summarizing these regulations. 
Later, when you apply to the inspector for a work 
permit, he will expect you to understand the local 
guidelines as well as a few basic National Electrical 
Code  requirements.
The National Electrical Code is a set of standards 
that provides minimum safety requirements for wiring 
installations. It is revised every three years. The national 
code requirements for the projects shown in this book 
are thoroughly explained on the following pages. For 
more information, you can find copies of the current 
NEC, as well as a number of excellent handbooks based 
on the NEC, at libraries and bookstores.
In addition to being the final authority of code 
requirements, inspectors are electrical professionals 
with years of experience. Although they have busy 
schedules, most inspectors are happy to answer 
questions and help you design well‑planned circuits.

Electrical Code requirements for living areas: Living areas need at least one 15‑amp or 20‑amp basic lighting/receptacle 
circuit for each 600 sq. ft. of living space and should have a dedicated circuit for each type of permanent appliance, like an air 
conditioner, computer, or a group of baseboard heaters and within 6 ft. of any door opening. Receptacles on basic lighting/
receptacle circuits should be spaced no more than 12 ft. apart. Many electricians and electrical inspectors recommend even 
closer spacing. Any wall more than 24" wide also needs a receptacle. Every room should have a wall switch at the point of 
entry to control either a ceiling light or plug‑in lamp. Kitchens and bathrooms must have a ceiling‑mounted light fixture.

Selected neC Standards & tips
Measure the living areas of your home, excluding 
closets and unfinished spaces. A sonic measuring tool 
gives room dimensions quickly and contains a built‑in 
calculator for figuring floor area. You will need a 
minimum of one basic lighting/receptacle circuit for 
every 600 sq. ft. of living space. The total square footage 
also helps you determine heating and cooling needs for 
new room additions.
Stairways with six steps or more must have lighting 
that illuminates each step. The light fixture must 
be controlled by three‑way switches at the top and 
bottom landings.
Kitchen and bathroom receptacles must be 
protected by a ground‑fault circuit‑interrupter (GFCI). 
Also, all outdoor receptacles and general‑use receptacles 
in an unfinished basement or crawl space and garages 
must be protected by a GFCI.
Cables must be protected against damage from 
nails and screws by at least 1¼" of wood (top). When 
cables pass through 2 × 2 furring strips (bottom), protect 
the cables with metal nail guards. Nail guards also may 
be used to protect cable that cannot meet the 1¼" of 
wood protection standard.

Label new circuits on an index attached to the circuit 
breaker panel. List the rooms and appliances controlled 
by each circuit. Make sure the area around the panel is 
clean, well lighted, and accessible.
Closets and other storage spaces 
need at least one light fixture that 
is controlled by a wall switch near 
the entrance. Prevent fire hazards 
by positioning the light fixtures so 
the outer globes are at least 12" away 
from all shelf areas.
Hallways more than 10 ft. long 
need at least one receptacle. 
All hallways should have a 
switch‑controlled light fixture.
Amp ratings of receptacles 
must match the size of the circuit. 
A common mistake is to use 
20‑amp receptacles (top) on 15‑amp 
circuits—a potential cause of 
dangerous circuit overloads because 
it allows you to plug in appliances 
that draw over 15 amps.
A metal brace attached to framing members 
is required for ceiling fans and large light fixtures that 
are too heavy to be supported by an electrical box. All 
ceiling fans must be installed in a box that is fan‑rated.

GFCI & AFCI Breakers
unDeRStAnDInG tHe DIFFeRenCe between GFCI 
(ground‑fault circuit interruption) and AFCI (arc 
fault circuit interruption) is very tricky for most 
homeowners who do not have a degree in electrical 
engineering. Essentially, it comes down to this: 
Arc‑fault protection keeps your house from burning 
down; ground‑fault protection keeps people from 
being electrocuted.
The National Electric Code (NEC) requires that an 
arc‑fault circuit‑interrupter (AFCI) breaker be installed 
on all branch circuits that supply outlets or fixtures in 
newly constructed homes. They’re a prudent precau‑
tion in any home, especially if it has older wiring. AFCI 
breakers will not interfere with the operation of GFCI 
receptacles, so it is safe to install an AFCI breaker on a 
circuit that contains GFCI receptacles.

AFCI or GFCI breaker
A GFCI breaker is an important safety device that 
disconnects a circuit in the event of a ground fault 
(when current takes a path other than the neutral 
back to the panel).
On new construction, GFCI protection is 
required on outlets in laundry and utility rooms, 
garages and unfinished basements, and near 
kitchen or bathroom sinks. In general it is a good 
practice to protect all receptacle and fixture 
locations that could encounter damp or wet 
circumstances. Typically, a GFCI receptacle is 
installed at each location, but in some cases—
outdoor circuits or older homes with boxes too 
shallow for GFCI receptacles, for instance—it is 
advisable to protect the entire circuit with a 
GFCI breaker.
AFCI breakers (right) are similar in appearance to GFCI breakers (left), but 
they function differently. AFCI breakers trip when they sense an arc fault. 
GFCI breakers trip when they sense fault between the hot wire and the ground.

120/240‑Volt Dryer Receptacles
MAnY DRYeRS require both 120‑ and 240‑volt power. 
If you are installing this type of electric dryer, you will 
need to install a 30‑amp, 120/240‑volt receptacle that 
feeds from a dedicated 30‑amp double‑pole breaker in 
your service panel. Verify your dryer’s electric require‑
ments before wiring a new receptacle.
Begin the installation by identifying a location 
for the dryer receptacle. Run 10/3 NM cable from

conduit and secure the box and conduit with 
masonry screws. If you are mounting the receptacle 
box in finished drywall, cut a hole, fish the cable 
through, and mount the receptacle in the 
wall opening.
A 240‑volt installation is no more complicated than wiring a single‑pole 
breaker and outlet. The main difference is that the dryer circuit’s double‑pole 
breaker is designed to contact both 120‑volt bus bars in the service panel. 
Together, these two 120‑volt circuits serve the dryer’s heating elements with 
240 volts of power. The timer, switches, and other dryer electronics utilize the 
circuit’s 120‑volt power.

120/240‑Volt Range Receptacles
MAnY eLeCtRIC RAnGeS require both 120‑ and 
240‑volt power. If you are installing this type of 
electric range, you will need to install a 40‑ or 50‑amp 
120/240‑volt receptacle that feeds from a dedicated 
40‑ or 50‑amp breaker in the service panel. Breaker 
amperage depends on the amount of power the range 
draws. Verify requirements before wiring a receptacle.
A range receptacle and breaker installation is no 
more complicated than wiring a single‑pole breaker 
and outlet. The main difference is that the range 
circuit’s double‑pole breaker is designed to contact 
both 120‑volt bus bars in the service panel. Together 
these two 120‑volt circuits serve the range’s heating 
elements with 240 volts of power. The timer, switches, 
and other range electronics utilize the circuit’s 
120‑volt power.
Modern range receptacles accept a four‑prong 
plug configuration. The cable required is 
four‑conductor service entrance round (SE or NM‑B) 
cable, containing three insulated wires and one 
ground. The two hot wires might be black and red 
(shown below) or black and black with a red stripe. 
The neutral wire is generally white or gray. The 
grounding wire is green or bare. The size used for a 
kitchen range is usually 6/3 grounded SE or NM‑B 
copper cable. The receptacle itself is generally surface 
mounted for easier installation (shown below), 
though flush‑mounted units are also available.

Ceiling Lights
CeILInG FIxtuReS don’t have any moving parts and 
their wiring is very simple, so, other than changing 
bulbs, you’re likely to get decades of trouble‑free 
service from a fixture. This sounds like a good thing, 
but it also means that the fixture probably won’t fail 
and give you an excuse to update a room’s look with a 
new one. Fortunately, you don’t need an excuse. 
Upgrading a fixture is easy and can make a dramatic 
impact on a room. You can substantially increase the 
light in a room by replacing a globe‑style fixture with 
one that has separate spot lights, or you can simply 
install a new fixture that matches the room’s décor.
Installing a new ceiling fixture can provide more light to a space, not to 
mention an aesthetic lift. It’s one of the easiest upgrades you can do.

If the new fixture is much heavier than the original 
fixture, it will require additional bracing in the ceiling 
to support the electrical box and the fixture. The 
manufacturer’s instructions should specify the size 
and type of box. If the ceiling is finished and there is no 
access from above, you can remove the old box and use 
an adjustable remodeling brace appropriate for your 
fixture (shown). The brace fits into a small hole in the 
ceiling (inset). Once the bracing is in place, install a new 
electrical box specified for the new fixture.
No matter what a ceiling light fixture looks like 
on the outside, they all attach in basically the same way. 
An electrical box in the ceiling is fitted with a mounting 
strap, which holds the fixture in place. The bare wire 
from the ceiling typically connects to the mounting 
strap. The two wires coming from the fixture connect to 
the black and the white wires from the ceiling.
Inexpensive light fixtures have screw terminals 
mounted directly to the backside of the fixture plate. 
Often, as Seen here, they have no grounding terminal. 
Some codes do not allow this type of fixture, but even 
if your hometown does approve them, it is a good idea 
to replace them with a better quality, safer fixture that 
is UL‑approved.

 Shut off power to the ceiling light and remove the shade or diffuser. Loosen the mounting screws and carefully 
lower the fixture, supporting it as you work (do not let light fixtures hang by their electrical wires alone). Test with a 
voltage sensor to make sure no power is reaching the connections.
2 
 Remove the twist connectors from the fixture wires or unscrew the screw terminals and remove the white neutral 
wire and the black lead wire (inset).
3 
 Before you install the new fixture, check the ends of the wires coming from the ceiling electrical box. They 
should be clean and free of nicks or scorch marks. If they’re dirty or worn, clip off the stripped portion with your 
combination tool. Then strip away about ¾" of insulation from the end of each wire.

Recessed Ceiling Lights
ReCeSSeD LIGHtS are versatile fixtures suited for 
a variety of situations. Fixtures rated for outdoor 
use can also be installed in roof soffits and 
overhangs for accent and security lighting. Recessed 
fixtures can also be installed over showers or tubs. 
Be sure to use fixture cans and trims rated for 
bathroom use.
There are recessed lighting cans in all shapes and 
sizes for almost every type of ceiling or cabinet. Cans 
are sold for unfinished ceilings (new construction) or 
for finished ceilings (retrofit installation). Cans are 
also rated as insulation compatible or for 
un‑insulated ceilings. Be sure to use the correct one 
for your ceiling to prevent creating a fire hazard.
Choose the proper type of recessed light fixture for your project. There 
are two types of fixtures: those rated for installation within insulation (left), 
and those which must be kept at least 3" from insulation (right). Self‑contained 
thermal switches shut off power if the unit gets too hot for its rating. A 
recessed light fixture must be installed at least ½" from combustible materials.
Recessed ceiling lights often are installed in series to provide exacting 
control over the amount and direction of light. Spacing the canisters in every 
other ceiling joist bay is a common practice.

 Mark the location for the light canister. If you are installing multiple lights, measure out from the wall at the start 
and end of the run, and connect them with a chalkline snapped parallel to the wall. If the ceiling is finished with a 
surface (wallboard), See next page.
2 
 Install the housing for the recessed fixture. Housings for new construction (or remodeling installations where the 
installation area is fully accessible from either above or below) have integral hanger bars that you attach to each 
joist in the joist bay.
3 
 Run electric cable from the switch to each canister location. Multiple lights are generally installed in series so 
there is no need to make pigtail connections in the individual boxes. Make sure to leave enough extra cable at each 
location to feed the wire into the housing and make the connection.
4 
 Run the feeder cables into the electrical boxes attached to the canister housings. You’ll need to remove knockouts 
first and make sure to secure the cable with a wire staple within 8" of the entry point to the box.

 Make the hole for the can. Most fixtures will include a template for sizing the hole. Fish 14/2 cable from the switch 
location to the hole. Pull about 16" of cable out of the hole for making the connection.
2 
 Remove a knockout from the electrical box attached to the can. Thread the cable into the box; secure it with a cable 
clamp. Remove sheathing insulation. Connect the black fixture wire to the black circuit wire, the white fixture wire 
to the white circuit wire, and then connect the ground wire to the grounding screw or grounding wire attached to 
the box.
3 
 Retrofit cans secure themselves in the hole with spring‑loaded clips. Install the can in the ceiling by depressing 
the mounting clips so the can will fit into the hole. Insert the can so that its edge is tight to the ceiling. Push the 
mounting clips back out so they grip the drywall and hold the fixture in place. Install the trim piece.

Hard‑wired Smoke & CO Detectors
SMOke AnD CARBOn MOnOxIDe (CO) alarms are 
an essential safety component of any living facility. 
All national fire protection codes require that new 
homes have a hard‑wired smoke alarm in every 
sleeping room and on every level of a residence, 
including basements, attics, and attached garages. A 
smoke alarm needs to be protected with an AFCI 
circuit if it is installed in a bedroom.
Most authorities also recommend CO detectors 
on every level of the house and in every 
sleeping area.
Heat alarms, which detect heat instead of smoke, 
are often specified for locations like utility rooms, 
basements, or unfinished attics, where conditions 
may cause nuisance tripping of smoke alarms.
Hard‑wired alarms operate on your household 
electrical current but have battery backups in case of 
a power outage. On new homes, all smoke alarms 
must be wired in a series so that every alarm sounds 
regardless of the fire’s location. When wiring a series 
of alarms, be sure to use alarms of the same brand to 
ensure compatibility. Always check local codes before 
starting the job.
Ceiling‑installed alarms should be 4 inches away 
from the nearest wall. Smoke alarms always need to 
be protected with an AFCI circuit.

Smoke detectors and carbon monoxide (CO) detectors are required in 
new construction. Hard‑wired carbon monoxide detectors (A) are triggered 
by the presence of carbon monoxide gas. Smoke detectors are available in 
photoelectric and ionizing models. In ionizing detectors (B), a small amount 
of current flows in an ionization chamber. When smoke enters the chamber, 
it interrupts the current, triggering the alarm. Photoelectric detectors (C) rely 
on a beam of light, which when interrupted by smoke triggers an alarm. Heat 
alarms (D) sound an alarm when they detect areas of high heat in the room.

3 
 Wire the remaining alarms in the series by connecting the like‑colored wires in each outlet box. Always connect 
the red traveler wire to the odd‑colored (in this case, red) alarm wire. This red traveler wire connects all the alarms 
together so that when one alarm sounds, all the alarms sound. If the alarm doesn’t have a grounding wire, cap the 
ground with a wire connector. When all alarms are wired, install and connect the new 15‑amp breaker.

Baseboard Heaters
BASeBOARD HeAteRS are a popular way to provide

Heaters are generally wired on a dedicated 
240‑volt circuit controlled by a thermostat. Several 
heaters can be wired in parallel and controlled by a 
single thermostat.
Baseboard heaters are generally surface‑mounted 
without boxes, so in a remodeling situation, you only 
need to run cables before installing wallboard. Be 
sure to mark cable locations on the floor before 
installing drywall. Retrofit installations are also not 
difficult. You can remove existing baseboard and run

In‑heater and wall‑mount are the two types of 
baseboard thermostats you can choose from. If you 
are installing multiple heaters, a single wall‑mount 
thermostat is more convenient. Individual in‑heater 
thermostats give you more zone control, which can result 
in energy savings.

Baseboard thermostats
Single‑pole and double‑pole thermostats work in 
a similar manner, but double‑pole models are safer. The 
single‑pole model will open the circuit (causing shutoff) in 
only one leg of the power service. Double‑pole models have 
two sets of wires to open both legs, lessening the chance 
that a person servicing the heater will contact a live wire.
How Much Heater Do You need?
If you don’t mind doing a little math, determining how many lineal feet of baseboard heater a room requires 
is not hard. 
1. 
Measure the area of the room in square feet (length × width): 
 
2. 
Multiply the area by 10 to get the baseline minimum wattage: 
 
3. 
Add 5% for each newer window or 10% for each older window: 
 
4. 
Add 10% for each exterior wall in the room: 
 
5. 
Add 10% for each exterior door: 
 
6. 
Add 10% if the space below is not insulated: 
 
7. 
Add 20% if the space above is not well insulated: 
 
8. 
Add 10% if ceiling is more than 8 ft. high: 
 
9. 
Total of the baseline wattage plus all additions: 
 
10. Divide this number by 250 (the wattage produced per foot of standard baseboard heater): 
 
11. Round up to a whole number. This is the minimum number of feet of heater you need. 
Note: It is much better to have more feet of heater than is required than fewer. Having more footage of heater does 
not consume more energy; it does allow the heaters to work more efficiently.
Planning tips for Baseboard Heaters
• 
 Baseboard heaters require a dedicated circuit. A 20‑amp, 240‑volt circuit of 12‑gauge copper wire will power 
up to 16 ft. of heater.
• 
 Do not install a heater beneath a wall receptacle. Cords hanging down from the receptacle are a fire hazard.
• 
 Do not mount heaters directly on the floor. You should maintain at least 1" of clear space between the 
baseboard heater and the floor covering.
• 
 Install heaters directly beneath windows.
• 
 Locate wall thermostats on interior walls only, and do not install directly above a heat source.

 At the heater locations, cut a small hole in the drywall 3 to 4" above the floor. Pull 12/2 NM cables through the first 
hole: one from the thermostat, the other to the next heater. Pull all the cables for subsequent heaters. Middle‑of‑run 
heaters will have two cables, while end‑of‑run heaters have only one cable.
2 
 Remove the cover on the wire connection box. Open a knockout for each cable that will enter the box, then feed the 
cables through the cable clamps and into the wire connection box. Attach the clamps to the wire connection box, 
and tighten the clamp screws until the cables are gripped firmly.
3 
 Anchor the heater against the wall about 1" off the floor by driving flathead screws through the back of housing and 
into studs. Strip away cable sheathing so at least ½" of sheathing extends into the heater. Strip ¾" of insulation from 
each wire using a combination tool.
4 
 Make connections to the heating element if the power wires are coming from a thermostat or another heater 
controlled by a thermostat. See next page for other wiring schemes. Connect the white circuit wires to one of the 
wire leads on the heater. Tag white wires with black tape to indicate they are hot. Connect the black circuit wires to 
the other wire lead. Connect a grounding pigtail to the green grounding screw in the box, then join all grounding 
wires with a wire connector. Reattach cover.

One heater with end‑cap 
thermostat. Run both power leads 
(black plus tagged neutral) into the 
connection box at either end of the 
heater. If installing a single‑pole 
thermostat, connect one power 
lead to one thermostat wire and 
connect the other thermostat wire 
to one of the heater leads. Connect 
the other hot LINE wire to the other 
heater lead. If you are installing 
a double‑pole thermostat, make 
connections with both legs of the 
power supply.
Multiple heaters. At the first 
heater, join both hot wires from the 
thermostat to the wires leading to 
the second heater in line. Be sure 
to tag all white neutrals hot. Twist 
copper ground wires together and 
pigtail them to the grounding 
screw in the baseboard heater 
junction box. This parallel wiring 
configuration ensures that power 
flow will not be interrupted to the 
downstream heaters if an upstream 
heater fails.
Wall‑mounted thermostat. 
If installing a wall‑mounted 
thermostat, the power leads should 
enter the thermostat first and then 
be wired to the individual heaters 
singly or in series. Hookups at the 
heater are made as shown in step 4. 
Be sure to tag the white neutral as 
hot in the thermostat box as well as 
in the heater box.

Ceiling Fans
CeILInG FAnS are installed and wired like ceiling 
fixtures. They always require heavy‑duty bracing and 
electrical boxes rated for ceiling fans.
Most standard ceiling fans work with a wall 
switch functioning as master power for the unit. Pull 
chains attached to the unit control the fan and lights. 
In these installations, it’s fairly simple to replace an 
existing ceiling fixture with a fan and light.
If you will be installing a new circuit for the fan, 
use three‑wire cable so both the light and the motor 
can be controlled by wall switches.
Because ceiling fans generally weigh more than 
ceiling lights and the motion of the blade creates 
more stress, it is very important that the ceiling box 
is securely mounted and is rated for ceiling fans. 
Ceiling boxes rated for ceiling fans are marked with 
the phrase “For ceiling fan support.” If your existing 
ceiling box is not fan‑rated, replace it with one that is. 
And be sure to inspect the manner in which the box 
is mounted to make sure it is strong enough.
Installation varies from fan to fan, so be sure to 
follow the manufacturer’s instructions.

A ceiling fan helps keep living

easy project with big payback.

Ceiling Fan types
Bracket‑mounted ceiling fans are hung directly from 
a mounting bracket that is attached to the ceiling box. A 
canopy conceals the motor and the connections.
Downrod mounted ceiling fans are supported by a 
metal rod that’s hung from the ceiling mounting bracket. The 
length of the rod determines the height of the fan. Downrod 
fans are used in rooms with ceilings 8 ft. high or higher.

Fans that Heat
The first generation of ceiling fans did one job: they spun 
and moved air. As the technology advanced, light kits were 
added to replace the light source that is lost when a fan‑only 
appliance is installed. Now, some ceiling fans are manufac‑
tured with electric heating elements that can produce up to 
5,000 BTUs of heat, comparable to a small space heater. 
Located in the fan canopy, the ceramic heat elements direct 
heat out the vents and force it down to the living level in the 
room, along with the heated air that naturally rises. 
Fan‑mounted heaters are relatively light duty, so they 
generally do not require a dedicated circuit. In most 
cases, you can supply power to the heater/fan with any 
15‑amp room light circuit that has extra capacity.

Install an adjustable fan brace if the ceiling is closed 
and you don’t want to remove the wallcoverings. Remove 
the old light and the electrical box and then insert the 
fan brace into the box opening (inset photo). Twist the 
brace housing to cause it to telescope outward. The brace 
should be centered over the opening and at the right 
height so the ceiling box is flush with the ceiling surface 
once it is hung from the brace.
Wallboard
Mounting bracket
Supporting Ceiling Boxes
Add a wood brace above the ceiling box if you have 
access from above (as in an attic). Cut a 24" brace to fit 
and nail it between the ceiling joists. Drive a couple of 
deck screws through the ceiling box and into the brace. If 
the box is not fan‑rated, replace it with one that is.
Bracket‑mounted Fans
Ball‑and‑socket fan units have a downrod, but 
instead of threading into the mounting bracket, the 
downrod has an attached ball that fits into a hanger 
“socket” in the mounting bracket. This installation 
allows the fan to move in the socket and find its own level 
for quiet operation.
Direct‑mount fan units have a motor housing with 
a mounting tab that fits directly into a slot on the 
mounting bracket. Fans with this mounting approach are 
secure and easy to install but difficult to adjust.

Repairing Light Fixtures
LIGHt FIxtuReS are attached permanently to 
ceilings or walls. They include wall‑hung sconces, 
ceiling‑hung globe fixtures, recessed light fixtures, 
and chandeliers. Most light fixtures are easy to repair 
using basic tools and inexpensive parts.
If a light fixture fails, always make sure the light 
bulb is screwed in tightly and is not burned out. A 
faulty light bulb is the most common cause of light 
fixture failure. If the light fixture is controlled by a 
wall switch, also check the switch as a possible 
source of problems.
Light fixtures can fail because the sockets or 
built‑in switches wear out. Some fixtures have 
sockets and switches that can be removed for minor 
repairs. These parts are held to the base of the fixture 
with mounting screws or clips. Other fixtures have 
sockets and switches that are joined permanently to 
the base. If this type of fixture fails, purchase and 
install a new light fixture.
Damage to light fixtures often occurs because 
homeowners install light bulbs with wattage ratings 
that are too high. Prevent overheating and light 
fixture failures by using only light bulbs that match 
the wattage ratings printed on the fixtures.

In a typical incandescent light fixture, a black 
hot wire is connected to a brass screw terminal on the 
socket. Power flows to a small tab at the bottom of the 
metal socket and through a metal filament inside the 
bulb. The power heats the filament and causes it to glow. 
The current then flows through the threaded portion of 
the socket and through the white neutral wire back to the 
main service panel.

Repairing Fluorescent Lights
FLuOReSCent LIGHtS are relatively trouble free 
and use less energy than incandescent lights. A 
typical fluorescent tube lasts about three years and 
produces two to four times as much light per watt as 
a standard incandescent light bulb.
The most frequent problem with a fluorescent 
light fixture is a worn‑out tube. If a fluorescent light 
fixture begins to flicker or does not light fully, 
remove and examine the tube. If the tube has bent or 
broken pins or black discoloration near the ends, 
replace it. Light gray discoloration is normal in 
working fluorescent tubes. When replacing an old 
tube, read the wattage rating printed on the glass 
surface, and buy a new tube with a matching rating. 
(See information below on new standards for fluores‑
cent bulbs.) Never dispose of old tubes by breaking 
them. Fluorescent tubes contain a small amount of 
hazardous mercury. Check with your local environ‑
mental control agency or health department for 
disposal guidelines.
Fluorescent light fixtures also can malfunction if 
the sockets are cracked or worn. Inexpensive replace‑
ment sockets are available at any hardware store and 
can be installed in a few minutes.
If a fixture does not work even after the tube and 
sockets have been serviced, the ballast probably is 
defective. Faulty ballasts may leak a black, oily 
substance and can cause a fluorescent light fixture to 
make a loud humming sound. Although ballasts can 
be replaced, always check prices before buying a new 
ballast. It may be cheaper to purchase and install a 
new fluorescent fixture rather than to replace the 
ballast in an old fluorescent light fixture.
new Fluorescent Standards
New efficiency standards for fluorescent fixtures 
have recently been enacted. The old four‑foot fluores‑
cent tubes, sometimes called “fat fours” are no longer 
available for general use. Those tubes were called 
T12s, because the tube diameter was 12⁄8 of an inch, or 
1½ inches. The new tubes are called T8s and are 1 
inch in diameter. The T8s use the same sockets, but 
do not illuminate in an old fixture because they 
require different ballasts. The new ballasts are 
electronic, as opposed to the old that were electro‑
magnetic. A big plus of the new electronic ballasts is 
that they cycle much faster than the old ones. This 
eliminates the flicker of fluorescents that can be so 
annoying to some people. Another plus is that the 
new fixtures and bulbs produce brighter, better 
quality light using less power. 
When your current fluorescent bulbs begin to 
burn out, you will need to either retrofit your fixtures 
with new ballasts, or purchase new fixtures. The new 
bulbs, ballasts, and fixtures may be slightly more 
expensive, but the lifespan and operating costs will 
be less than the older units. Simply replacing the 
whole fixture will require less time wiring than 
removing and re‑wiring ballasts and sockets. If you 
do decide to do a re‑wire, it may be easier to remove 
the fixture and perform the tasks on a tabletop, 
rather than over your head.

tip
Recent changes to efficiency regulations mean older fluorescent tubes will soon cost more. As tubes burn out, 
it will make more sense to replace old fixtures with the more efficient new fixtures. The new tubes are not 
compatible with old fixtures.

Older fluorescent lights may have a small cylindrical 
device, called a starter, located near one of the sockets. 
When a tube begins to flicker, replace the entire fixture 
with an updated one.

Fluorescent tubes
A fluorescent light works by directing electrical current through a special gas‑filled tube that glows when energized. 
A white translucent diffuser protects the fluorescent tube and softens the light. A cover plate protects a special 
transformer, called a ballast. The ballast regulates the flow of 120‑volt household current to the sockets. The sockets 
transfer power to metal pins that extend into the tube.
Another advantage of the electronic ballast is that 
they are more sophisticated in the way they illumi‑
nate the bulb. Previous ballasts were labeled as rapid 
start or instant start, but now, with electronic 
ballasts, a programmable option is available. This 
technicality is probably only important in commer‑
cial settings, which use thousands of fluorescent 
fixtures. If you purchase separate ballasts and 
sockets for a retrofit, you do need to match the socket 
to the ballast as well as to the wattage bulb used.

Flourescent bulbs and ballasts are both hazardous 
waste. Check with your local waste agency for

Converting temperatures
Convert degrees Fahrenheit (F) to degrees Celsius (C) by following 
this simple formula: Subtract 32 from the Fahrenheit temperature 
reading. Then mulitply that number by 5⁄9. For example, 77°F ‑ 32 = 45. 
45 × 5⁄9 = 25°C.
To convert degrees Celsius to degrees Fahrenheit, multiply the Celsius 
temperature reading by 9⁄5, then add 32. For example, 25°C × 9⁄5 = 45. 
45 + 32 = 77°F.
